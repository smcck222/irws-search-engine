THE PETTER PRINCIPLE; 
</P>
<P>
MENTALLY ILL CHILDREN FIND ANIMALS A SOURCE OF LOVE AND THERAPY 
</P>

In a classroom at Camarillo State Hospital, an 11-year-old boy with sad, dark 
eyes sat in a corner, quietly petting his friend Echo, a golden retriever. 
</P>
<P>
"Echo takes away my sad feelings," said the boy, who is confined to a ward for 
mentally ill children. "And I've learned that animals have more feelings than I 
thought." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers and psychologists at the hospital, which has about 1,200 
developmentally disabled and mentally ill patients, say they are using animals 
more and more in therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is no structured pet therapy program at Camarillo, the idea of 
allowing patients time to cuddle animals is quickly catching on. About half a 
dozen teachers and psychologists bring their pets to work every day, a practice 
encouraged by hospital officials. A few other employees have adopted cats that 
have wandered onto the spacious grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something they can cuddle and love," said Dee Press, a special education 
teacher who owns Echo. "A lot of the kids we have here have been abused 
mentally and physically. An animal is non-threatening." 
</P>
<P>
Employees stay close by when patients are with the animals. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very careful not to leave them alone. Some of the patients would kill 
the animals," said Jerry Scheurn, coordinator of volunteer services at the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
But no abuse has occurred yet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Press, who teaches children ages 8 through 13, said she is delighted with how 
her students react to her dog. She has been bringing Echo since the 7-year-old 
retriever was a puppy, she said, and she is always impressed with her students' 
reactions. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had kids who don't talk very much," Press said. "But sometimes when the 
kids are sad they will ask to spend a little time with Echo." 
</P>
<P>
One time a young boy was visibly upset when he came to class but he refused to 
discuss his troubles. When Press allowed the child to pet Echo, the boy started 
to hug the dog and cry. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Why don't you tell Echo what's wrong?' " Press said. The boy quietly 
explained that he was afraid his mother would forget to visit him at the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo hospital is not alone in using animals during psychiatric treatment. 
It is becoming a common practice in hospitals throughout the state, and 
Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena even has a team of trained therapy 
dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Westwood therapist Janet Ruckert describes "petcology" the value of using pets 
to help people overcome their anxieties -- in her book titled, "The Four-Footed 
Therapist." 
</P>
<P>
According to Ruckert, animals are natural therapists. By being warm and 
sympathetic listeners, they allow a patient to express deep emotions and needs. 
</P>
<P>
The Camarillo hospital has a petting zoo with a goat and rabbits, but the 
children visit them sporadically. Therapists say patients relate better to cats 
and dogs because they usually are more affectionate. 
</P>
<P>
Connie Westphal, a special education teacher at the hospital, said her students 
get upset if she doesn't bring her dog Frankie, a dachshund, to class. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to know where he is," Westphal said. "They seemed to have bonded 
with him." 
</P>
<P>
A white and gray cat, often found under a tree outside the children's ward, 
constantly receives attention. 
</P>
<P>
"She does stuff that's neat," said a blond 11-year-old boy, scratching the cat 
behind the ears. "She rolls around in the grass and she catches mice. But the 
kids like her because she respects us. That's important."

HIRE AUTHORITIES SAY SUMMER JOBS WILL BE PLENTIFUL; 
</P>
<P>
EMPLOYMENT: YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND WORK IN RESTAURANTS, STORES, 
OFFICES AND PARKS.

<P>
Summer jobs are expected to be plentiful in Ventura County this year, according 
to people in a position to know. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking forward to a great summer," said Joyce Waldron, executive 
director of the Ventura Youth Employment Service, a nonprofit organization that 
placed 4,000 applicants ages 13 through 25 in full- and part-time positions 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Starting in mid-June, when most school summer vacations begin, Waldron expects 
"lots of young people eager to work" to start filling jobs in restaurants, 
stores, offices and parks. 
</P>
<P>
Other agencies that match youthful applicants with employers, including the 
Private Industry Council and employment offices at local colleges and high 
schools, said they, too, expect a strong job market this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Most summer jobs for students pay the minimum wage, $4.25 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County has strong retail and service industries and low unemployment. 
Its jobless rate in March was 4%, said Linda Reed, a state employment analyst. 
</P>
<P>
The figure compares with 5.9% in the Los Angeles-Long Beach metropolitan area 
and 5.3% in the state as a whole. All the rates are unadjusted for seasonal 
trends. "Certainly, the Ventura County jobless rate is one of the lowest in the 
state," Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Fillmore, manager of the McDonald's at 2137 E. Harbor Blvd. in Ventura, 
said he expects to hire 15 to 20 people this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"The sooner the better, so we can get their training started," he said. "We're 
near the beach, so our business picks up a lot during the summer." 
</P>
<P>
Lisa McInally, personnel coordinator of Paschen Management Corp., a 
Camarillo-based company that operates six McDonald's restaurants in the county, 
including Fillmore's, said all the restaurants will be hiring this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Annette Sparks, manager of the Employment Development Department's south Oxnard 
office, said her office and one in north Oxnard usually place about 500 young 
people in summer jobs each year. The Oxnard offices serve the western part of 
the county, and an office in Simi Valley serves the eastern county. 
</P>
<P>
At the J. C. Penney department store in Ventura's Buenaventura Fashion Center, 
Manager James W. Word says he'll be hiring too. He said his career with the 
company started with a summer job in Ventura 37 years ago.

COMPUTERS CROPPING UP IN EFFORT TO COUNTER THE DROUGHT; 
</P>
<P>
FARMING: ONLY A FEW GROWERS HAVE GONE HIGH-TECH, BUT OFFICIALS EXPECT WIDER USE 
OF DATA TO DETERMINE WATER USE.

At 5 every morning Santa Rosa Valley lemon farmer Will Gerry gets up and checks 
his computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
Without looking outside to see if it is cloudy or bright, Gerry can check the 
soil moisture in his groves through sensors electronically linked to his 
terminal. Monitors tell him how much water he is pumping from a well and how 
much water he needs to keep his plants alive on his 93-acre ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting it down so that I know how many gallons I'm putting on each 
orchard," Gerry, 44, said. 
</P>
<P>
After four years of below-average rainfall, growers are turning to computers to 
help them conserve the county's dwindling water supplies. Farmers and water 
agencies are deploying an arsenal of computerized data as a weapon in the 
battle against the drought. 
</P>
<P>
Each day, computers linked to weather stations around the county measure wind, 
rain and temperatures and send that information by computer to farmers. 
</P>
<P>
So far, only a few of Ventura County's farmers have purchased computers to 
reduce their water consumption. But with the drought an ongoing concern, water 
agency officials say it is only a matter of time before the rest fall in line. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pushing whatever is required to get the efficiency upgraded in 
irrigation systems," said Dick Barnett, engineering manager for the Casitas 
Municipal Water District. 
</P>
<P>
The district's computers have begun auditing water consumption at a number of 
farms and have turned up many cases in which farmers were over-irrigating 
crops, Barnett said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, water conservation measures are voluntary. District officials recently 
voted to try to reduce demand at least 20% by requesting that customers, 
including farmers, try to cut water consumption. 
</P>
<P>
But if the drought continues, water conservation may become mandatory. The 
district has been compiling information on water needs for various crops. Such 
computerized information will be used to enforce rationing plans if they are 
imposed next year, Barnett said. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Waddle, who runs the mobile irrigation management laboratory for the 
Ventura County Resource Conservation District, said fewer than 10% of farmers 
use computers to help them reduce water consumption on their fields. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers have been getting by so far "by the seat of their pants," he said. The 
typical farmer, he said, takes a shovel to his fields to determine whether the 
soil is saturated or dry. 
</P>
<P>
But the increasing price and scarcity of water no longer permits haphazard 
practices, he said. Today's farmer, he said, has to take advantage of the best 
of technology and combine that with experience and common sense. "You still 
have to go outside," Waddle said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of increased interest in conservation, the United Water Conservation 
District and Casitas Municipal Water District have plans to set up three new 
weather stations linked by computer to the state Department of Water Resources 
in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The county's only existing station is part of the California Irrigation 
Management Information Systems, which gathers weather readings from an orchard 
in Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
The station is unsophisticated: a sensor attached to a 50-square-inch plot of 
turf. But it is one of 60 used in the state used to determine 
"evapotranspiration rates," a component in formulating watering plans, Waddle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Within six months, two more stations will be added by the United Conservation 
Water District, one in Piru and another at an undetermined site in the county, 
hydrologist Greg Middleton said. 
</P>
<P>
Middleton said computers help water managers compile huge banks of weather data 
into information that farmers can use. They also will be used to scientifically 
prove to farmers that they are over-irrigating. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are entrenched in their system of irrigation," Middleton said. 
The more scientific the approach, "the better conservation we can have." 
</P>
<P>
But computers have not always lessened the load for some farmers, said Waddle, 
who analyzes irrigation schedules for the Ventura County Resource Conservation 
District. 
</P>
<P>
Numbers gathered by computers can give farmers data, but they must do 
calculations to use them in a watering plan, and the math has intimidated many 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Calculations may be easy for permanent crops, but there are other factors, 
including the age and type of crop, its location and how deeply it is planted, 
Waddle said. 
</P>
<P>
Fruit Growers Laboratories in Santa Paula is a private company that about 280 
farmers pay to compile data so they do not have to invest in their own 
computers. For many farmers and managers, using computers is not as easy as it 
looks, one company official said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the problem here of many small farms, a lot of absentee owners," said 
Darrell Nelson, president of the company. "So the actual farming gets left up 
to a laborer, and he's not about to use that level of technology." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said he charges farmers $16 per acre per year to come up with 
computerized version of weekly or monthly irrigation programs. 
</P>
<P>
Although the drought has caused some farmers to lose money, the Santa Paula 
company has made money from helping farmers ration their water, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers have also turned to his company because water agencies have become more 
complicated in the way they deliver water, Nelson said. Some allow agricultural 
customers to use water only on certain days, making it difficult for farmers to 
match the availability of supplies to the time when plants are getting dry. Not 
all of his clients are told to use less water. Some are told to use more, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the increased interest in irrigating by computer, most agricultural 
officials agree that there is no substitute for visiting the fields. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers "are ultimately responsible," Nelson said. "We're just scheduling 
irrigation, we're not running the farm for them." 
</P>
<P>
Gerry, the Santa Rosa Valley lemon grower, is one of the few farmers to strike 
out on his own with computers. He has invested thousands of dollars into 
high-tech gadgetry to inform him of what his forefathers tried to gauge by 
experience and luck. 
</P>
<P>
Gerry bought a terminal, software and other computer hardware about a month 
ago. He said he was planning to buy the equipment anyway, but the drought made 
it imperative. 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of whether you have your own well or whether you're purchasing it, 
the more finely tuned you can get your watering system, the better your trees 
will grow," Gerry said.

IT'S REPORT CARD TIME FOR SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first statewide attempt to make schools more accountable to parents will 
turn up beginning today in the mailboxes of almost 120,000 residents with 
children in San Diego city schools. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego district -- the state's second-largest -- is sending out its 
version of the "accountability report card," a performance snapshot of each of 
the district's 152 schools that is mandated under Proposition 98, approved by 
California voters in November, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In return for guaranteeing California public schools a fixed percentage of 
state revenues each year, Proposition 98 promised parents they would receive 
annual reports of how well the schools are carrying out their educational 
mission with the almost $17 billion allotted them. 
</P>
<P>
Already, smaller districts throughout the county have disseminated their report 
cards, which must include comments in 13 educational areas at any given school, 
including student test achievement, dropout rates, class sizes, teacher 
evaluations and use of special money. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the reactions of teachers, principals and parents have been mixed, with 
a consensus that while the documents provide useful information, overall they 
do not represent real "report cards" in the sense that schools admit specific 
weaknesses as well as touting their strengths. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're informative, especially if parents haven't gone to school 
meetings and aren't really involved with the schools," said Mary Lou Renckly, 
whose child attends San Pasqual High School in Escondido, which has already 
issued its four-page document. "We are involved but I think we learned some 
things about test scores, for example. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's not really a report card in that they are not grading teachers or 
discussing the actual curriculum," added Renckly, who also substitutes at the 
elementary level in Escondido. "I think that might be real touchy and might not 
go over well at all." 
</P>
<P>
A San Diego middle school principal admitted that some parents probably will 
see the district's standardized six-page cards as "a whitewash" because in many 
areas schools avoid being specific, especially regarding declining test scores 
or teacher evaluations. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we would have improved our credibility if we had made these 'warts and 
all' ", said the principal, who asked not to be identified. "Let's be up front 
about both our problems and our successes." 
</P>
<P>
State School Supt. Bill Honig, who sponsored Proposition 98 and pointedly 
included the report card provision, said that districts still have "some work 
to do" on the best way to carry out the requirement. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, I think people believe it is a good idea to be held accountable in 
exchange for a guarantee of funds," Honig said. "Accountability is a great 
management tool because over time, it requires you to examine what is not 
working if, for example, writing test scores do not go up. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think we are still in the developmental stages" in finding out how 
schools should be rewarded if they do a good job and what hard questions to 
raise if they do not, Honig said. He said the difficulty in sending out a true 
picture of school performance reflects the larger debate going on in many 
districts -- including San Diego -- over how to better hold principals and 
teachers accountable for achievements and failures. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of spirited debate within many districts when the state sent 
out its suggested guidelines," said Doug Langdon, a trustee of the South Bay 
school district and public information officer for the San Diego County Office 
of Education. 
</P>
<P>
"Compare them to corporate annual reports, when those with poor earnings try to 
put the best face on the situation . . . . It stands to reason that those 
schools with poor 'earnings' will try to put forward the best possible face." 
</P>
<P>
A sample of report cards countywide show that some districts -- and some 
schools within districts -- are being more candid than others. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego Unified, scores on Carver Elementary's statewide achievement 
tests, known as CAP, have declined over the past several years, and the trend 
lines on testing charts required on all city schools' cards show Carver is 
below districtwide levels. 
</P>
<P>
But in its text, the school says nothing about any decline, stating only that 
Carver "strives toward academic excellence . . . test scores are only one 
reflection of student progress towards becoming a literate and thinking person 
. . . many teachers are exploring core literature and reviewing learning 
styles. As a result, we hope to see improvement in all academic areas." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Adams Elementary admits in its text that its scores have dropped 
during the past two years, and tells parents that its loss in 1988 of special 
federal money to hire extra teachers and materials may be one factor. 
</P>
<P>
"That year -- 1987 -- scores reached an all-time high, the school was 
designated a Distinguished School by the state, and then the federal money was 
withdrawn. Hopefully, we are anticipating renewal of that program in the fall 
of 1990." 
</P>
<P>
The cards in the Oceanside Unified School District were handled differently, 
with the district rephrasing the state reporting indicators into questions that 
parents often ask. 
</P>
<P>
At San Rafael Elementary, the report offers detailed information on test scores 
for the past three years, not only comparing the school's trends but also 
comparing the school against all state schools. The report also offers details 
about teacher training, about student reward plans, about the school's 
discipline plan and drug education program, and about sixth graders with poor 
attendance who are using a new plan to improve achievement. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted more than just boiler-plate," said Bruce Cunningham, Oceanside's 
coordinator of instruction. "You don't want them too long," Cunningham said, 
noting that the district's cards run 14 pages, among the bulkier in the state. 
"But we do want parents to understand what we are doing and understand that we 
are supposed to be improving, and our focus should be on what our next steps 
are going to be. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of our schools were uncomfortable about reporting test trends since they 
do not score high, but our task force (which drew up the format) felt that it 
is helpful nevertheless to see comparisons." 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Boyle, president of the San Diego Teachers Assn., which represents San 
Diego Unified, said the cards "now look like public-relations gloss" but 
cautioned that they are only a first attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"They do need to get better and to say more things, such as breaking down class 
size numbers more precisely so that a parent can tell if the smallest classes 
are for gifted students, for example, or for English classes, or whatever," 
Boyle said. 
</P>
<P>
But Boyle expressed concern with any move to specify how many teachers at a 
school receive "needs improvement" evaluations, although parents who advised 
the district in drawing up their cards suggested that data. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, we have some bad teachers, but I don't think the district has a good 
evaluation system existing today" that fairly indicates who is good or bad, and 
therefore would not want such information on the cards, Boyle said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego city schools Supt. Tom Payzant hopes that parents will read the cards 
and attend special meetings that each school will be holding later this month. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, the question of honesty has come up because the prose is upbeat and 
positive," Payzant said. "But in several categories, the quantifiable data 
speaks for itself, good or bad, and can't really be masked. 
</P>
<P>
"So if parents come out to meetings and ask questions, they can be a real 
catalyst to push schools to do better and the cards will have real value, and 
not something that everyone will see as simply an annual ritual to be 
resented."

BATTLING FOR A BOULEVARD'S SOUL; 
</P>
<P>
MINI-BOOM: A FAMILIAR LAND-USE FIGHT IS BEING WAGED BETWEEN HOMEOWNERS 
DEFENDING THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE AND DEVELOPERS DETERMINED TO CHANGE THE 
CITYSCAPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
A burst of towering steel, marble and smoked glass is rising along Sepulveda 
Boulevard in Van Nuys, quickly transforming the broad thoroughfare from a 
hodgepodge commercial and industrial district into a slick business center. 
</P>
<P>
The two-mile-long mini-boom includes more than 1.5 million square feet of 
office and commercial space either under construction or on the drawing board. 
And it has been hailed and decried -- depending on one's perspective -- as a 
new northern tributary of the San Fernando Valley's glitzy Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"It's perfectly located, it's right on top of the San Diego Freeway, near 
Sherman Oaks, Encino and the Galleria," said John Battle, executive vice 
president of Beitler Commercial Realty Services, echoing the enthusiasm of 
other business leaders and developers. "It's a good alternative to Ventura 
Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
But Don Schultz, president of the Van Nuys Homeowners Assn., countered: "We 
don't want Sepulveda to turn into another Ventura Boulevard. We don't want the 
traffic, the high density. The community can't handle it all." 
</P>
<P>
The disparate views have provoked a familiar land-use battle in which 
homeowners, intent on preserving the quality of life in their communities by 
limiting growth, are pitted against developers, determined to change the 
cityscape in the name of progress. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, the developer of the largest project is negotiating with a group 
of Van Nuys homeowners demanding traffic and aesthetic improvements to relieve 
the impact of the sprawling seven-building development proposed for their 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Other homeowner groups are voicing broader and stronger objections to the 
growth along Sepulveda, especially between Ventura and Victory boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
A cadre of homeowner associations in Van Nuys, Reseda and Encino are calling on 
Councilman Marvin Braude, who represents the area, to initiate an immediate 
building moratorium until a detailed, long-term planning strategy for the 
boulevard can be drafted. But Braude is not prepared to delve into such a plan 
at this time. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict over the future of Sepulveda Boulevard is the latest example in 
the Valley of how community plans -- legal documents that guide future 
development drafted by the Los Angeles Planning Department in the early and 
mid-1970s -- can be sorely out of touch with the rapidly changing and diverse 
interests of a community. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the Van Nuys-North Sherman Oaks Community Plan, which includes 
Sepulveda Boulevard, allows for industrial uses such as metal manufacturing and 
auto reconditioning and storage yards along a half-mile swath centered on 
Oxnard Street. The industrially designated parcels are directly across the 
street from single-family homes in some blocks. 
</P>
<P>
It is the industrially zoned plots that have become the prime sites for the 
intense office development. City zoning laws permit such construction in most 
industrial zones because it is considered to be less intrusive development. 
Homeowners contend that industrial zoning is an obsolete land-use designation 
for the heart of the Valley and complain that controls to regulate commercial 
development in those zones are weak. 
</P>
<P>
Apartment and office buildings along Sepulveda can rise as high as six stories 
in some areas and are limited to three stories in others. Such buildings may be 
small by Ventura Boulevard standards, but Sepulveda has become increasingly 
attractive to developers for a number of other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Developers have turned northward in the past two years as building restrictions 
have tightened on prestigious -- and more expensive -- Ventura Boulevard. After 
more than three years of often bitter debate, a detailed zoning blueprint along 
Ventura, called a specific plan, is headed for city council review next fall. 
Among other items, the plan limits commercial construction to an additional 8.6 
million square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Land prices along Sepulveda generally run between $35 and $50 a square foot, 
about half the $100 per square foot commanded on Ventura Boulevard, according 
to developers and real estate agents. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons Sepulveda is taking off is because all the other prime 
corridors in the Valley are shutting down as a result of specific plans or 
expensive land," said Larry J. Kosmont, president of Kosmont and Associates in 
Burbank, a real estate and development consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
"It's logical and makes clear sense for developers to turn to Sepulveda. It's a 
major artery, a wide street and there is no specific plan," Kosmont said. "It's 
what I call 'a developer no-brainer.' " 
</P>
<P>
The danger, however, Kosmont and others said, is that without stricter controls 
and long-term planning along the Sepulveda corridor, the cumulative impact of 
each project will create a traffic nightmare even worse than the current 
peak-hour crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Already six Sepulveda intersections -- nearly every major cross street between 
Victory and Ventura boulevards -- are rated "F" by the city Department of 
Transportation because of severe traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The congestion and development troubles on Sepulveda could get worse if the 
$1.3-billion Valley Metro Rail extension is built. The proposed line, approved 
in March by county transit officials, would extend from North Hollywood to Van 
Nuys and is slated to end at ground level roughly at the site of the Sepulveda 
Drive-In Theater, between Erwin and Oxnard streets. 
</P>
<P>
The theater land is also the site of the largest project to be proposed to date 
along Sepulveda, a cluster of seven mid-rise office buildings -- dubbed the 
"Sepulveda Concourse" -- that could bring about 750,000 square feet of office 
space to the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an urgent need for a specific plan to deal with development that is 
hemorrhaging onto Sepulveda Boulevard," said Gerald Silver, president of 
Homeowners of Encino, who also called for immediate building controls while 
long-term plans are drafted. "If we don't, we will wind up with the kind of 
problems we now have on Ventura." 
</P>
<P>
Braude believes that imposing a building moratorium along Sepulveda would be 
premature because recent rezoning throughout Van Nuys reduced allowable 
densities in some areas and placed height limits along Sepulveda Boulevard, 
said Cindy Miscikowski, Braude's chief planning deputy. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now we are concentrating on Ventura Boulevard. If we succeed in getting 
that through council we would like to look elsewhere," Miscikowski said. 
</P>
<P>
Further distracting city planners and some community leaders is the preparation 
of a specific plan for Van Nuys Boulevard, the neglected cousin of Sepulveda 
and Ventura. That plan, which calls for revitalizing Van Nuys Boulevard into a 
modern business and administrative center, is nearing completion. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, we can't throw too much into the hopper," Miscikowski said. 
</P>
<P>
Braude is also satisfied that city policy calling for environmental reviews of 
major projects will enable him to examine the impact of pending developments 
along Sepulveda Boulevard whether or not there is a moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
"Projects are not just given a green light," Miscikowski said. "The 
environmental review gives us the ability to look at the project and enables us 
to better serve the needs of the community." 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners contend that the cumulative impact of these projects has not been 
assessed by city planners and the mini-boom is creating a regional business 
center. 
</P>
<P>
At least six major office complexes and retail centers have been recently 
completed, are under construction or on the drawing board along the Sepulveda 
corridor in Van Nuys, according to city building records. 
</P>
<P>
The largest project under construction is the six-story, 146,000-square-foot 
Tri Center Plaza being built by Woodland Hills-based Saunders Development Corp. 
on the southeast corner of Oxnard Street and Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
But the development that has ignited the most community concern is the 
Sepulveda Concourse, which will be developed by National Prudential Inc. of 
Century City. The project covers more than 12 acres and plans show that it 
would include seven four- to six-story buildings and two parking garages with 
2,609 spaces. 
</P>
<P>
Robert J. Abernethy, a former Los Angeles planning commissioner, is a partner 
in the development. 
</P>
<P>
Because the site is zoned for industrial uses, the developer does not need a 
zoning change to build offices and must only seek approval from the Building 
and Safety Department and the Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
A traffic study contracted by a consultant hired by the developer showed that 
the project would attract about 3,800 cars a day. The additional traffic along 
the boulevard could be mitigated if the developer made several street 
improvements, including traffic signal synchronization, the study stated. 
</P>
<P>
"It may not mean that traffic gets better, but as a result of our project it 
will not get worse," said George J. Mihlsten, an attorney for the developer. 
</P>
<P>
On March 13, the two city agencies approved the project, declaring that it 
would have no significant impact on traffic or the surrounding area. After a 
public comment period the developer would be clear to take out building 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
The public notice that the project would have no negative impact on the 
environment caught the eye of a Van Nuys homeowner. The scramble began. 
Homeowners petitioned for and were granted an extension to review and raise 
concerns about the agencies' positive declaration. Braude intervened and called 
for more detailed environmental reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Last month Abernethy asked city building officials to put the project on hold 
to allow the developer to meet with the community, particularly representatives 
of the 189-home neighborhood adjacent to the project. 
</P>
<P>
Residents want the project scaled back to two-story buildings and would like 
brick and wood building materials instead of glass and steel. They want lush 
landscaping to screen the development and traffic controls to prohibit 
shortcutting through their quiet streets. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to put together some responses and we will continue our dialogue 
with the community," Mihlsten said. "We will try and come up with a series of 
protection measures." But the developer has not formally responded to requests 
from neighborhood representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives from other groups said the Concourse project, which they are 
pleased to have caught before it was too late, is a prime example of the 
immediate need for tougher building controls along Sepulveda. They said they 
will begin a petition drive to urge Braude to call for further studies. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to be a day late and a dollar short," said Rob Glushon, 
president of the Encino Property Owners Assn. "I don't want to say it's too 
late now, but a lot of damage has already been done."

On Sunday, a dog day of its own, about 40 young canines, their tongues 
sometimes lolling, took part in guide dog trials on a grassy lawn in Sylmar. 
The Labrador, German shepherd and golden retriever puppies, adopted and trained 
by volunteers for 15 to 18 months, were being returned to International Guiding 
Eyes Inc., a nonprofit organization for the blind, for further instruction. But 
first, they showed off their prowess by running an obstacle course filled with 
such distractions as a hot dog, a live burro and a ceramic dog.

ANIMAL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your declaration of contempt for the animal rights movement (editorial, 
"Animals or Humans?" April 27) is so filled with warped reasoning, 
anthropocentric piety, and loaded rhetoric that I scarcely know where to begin 
to object. Perhaps with your silly claim that "to save the life of the lowliest 
child . . . in the furthest reaches of Bangladesh" you would sacrifice any 
animal "from hamster to great whale." As though animal rights advocates -- 
those diabolical, "hot-eyed," "unthinking zealots" -- prefer hamsters to dying 
children and positively salivate at the thought of depopulating the hinterlands 
of Bangladesh. 
</P>
<P>
Of course there are "unthinking zealots" in the animal rights movement (as 
there are on editorial staffs), but animal rights advocates on the whole are 
law-respecting, humane people who have nothing to gain except the hope of 
correcting what they perceive to be a terrible injustice. Moreover, their 
purpose is not, as you claim, "to force a halt to the use for medical 
research." Only a small percentage of laboratory animals are used for medical 
research. Estimates vary from 6% to 33%. In this country alone, tens of 
millions of animals whose only crime consists in their failure to be members of 
the human species are caged, pinioned, irradiated, shocked, poisoned, shot, cut 
open, implanted with diodes, and inevitably killed and discarded in 
laboratories for purposes that have nothing to do with saving human lives or 
reducing human suffering. 
</P>
<P>
Thus the question is not "Animals or Humans?" but "Do we humans really want 
cosmetics and toilet bowl cleaners at the cost of blinding rabbits and 
torturing hamsters?" Do we really want to shoot hundreds of cats in the head in 
order to discover what has been known since 1894 about brain injuries? Do we 
really want biology and psychology students to go on repeating routine, 
painful, death-dealing experiments with animals in order to learn what they 
could easily discover from watching a film? 
</P>
<P>
And do we really want to go on diminishing our own humanity on the arrogant 
assumption that we have the right to exploit anything and everything on this 
planet that can serve our self-declared higher interests?

F-117A STEALTH FIGHTER UNVEILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The lead sentence in "Stealth Fighter Comes Out of Hiding in Show" (by 
Associated Press, Part A, April 22) really made me burn. Calling the F-117A 
"one of America's worst-kept secrets" is not only false, but belittles the 
sacrifices of the thousands of people, military and civilian, who kept the 
secret for over eight years. 
</P>
<P>
As a member of the 4450th Tactical Group (later the 37th Tactical Fighter 
Wing), I can tell you firsthand about the constant, unrelenting pressure on the 
pilots, support personnel, factory workers, and their families from before the 
first flight in 1981 to the official Air Force announcement in November, 1988. 
While there was some speculation in the aviation press, even the most basic 
information on the project was never uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
Our silence has given our country an enormous technological edge.

FEDERAL CLEAN AIR BILL STANDARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pardon us if we don't share David Broder's celebration of the Senate's passage 
of a new clean air bill ("Clean Air Survives the Deal-Breakers," Op-Ed Page, 
April 11). 
</P>
<P>
While a milestone for the rest of the nation, the Senate bill does little for 
California -- we're way ahead of the Senate and everybody else. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, it is even weaker than the present law. Most disappointing, the 
bill continues to absolve the federal government from any responsibility in the 
cleanup effort. This is true even where the federal government alone has 
authority to control emissions: from trains, planes and ships, and from Defense 
Department activities. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate bill still requires Los Angeles to meet federal clean air standards. 
Thus, by allowing the federal government to shirk its own cleanup 
responsibility, the Senate is dumping a greater burden on Southland residents 
and industries, who must make up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble with the Senate's approach on clean air is that, like the weakest 
link in the chain, the bill is only as strong as the least likely senator to 
support it. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Broder, we applaud the efforts of California Sens. Pete Wilson and Alan 
Cranston to seek amendments to help California -- and other urban areas -- meet 
the standards mandated in the bill.

<P>
Your editorial placed human life above animal life. I congratulate you on 
making the only possible moral decision. 
</P>
<P>
However, since human life is more valuable than animal life, it requires that 
we ask and answer this question: What is the moral justification for animal 
rights groups spending millions of dollars on saving experimental animals while 
human beings die of hunger, war and pestilence? 
</P>
<P>
The answer to this question is really an eye-opener!

FIRST LADY VS. WELLESLEY: GOOD DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Talmudic expositor once observed, "I have spent my life among the sages, and 
from them I have learned that nothing is to be preferred to silence." Good 
advice, but here we go anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Students of Wellesley College in Massachusetts voted to invite Barbara Bush to 
deliver the commencement address. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bush was selected, according to the senior class president, because "she's 
a very interesting and successful lady." 
</P>
<P>
But 150 other students disagreed. In a letter of protest, they argued that the 
First Lady "has gained recognition through the achievements of her husband." 
Wellesley, they wrote, "teaches that we will be rewarded on the basis of our 
own merit, not on that of a spouse." 
</P>
<P>
The protesters did not demand that Mrs. Bush not speak. So Nan Keohane, 
Wellesley's president, called their disagreement a useful debate on feminism's 
meaning. She summarized the issue this way: Must women define themselves 
through careers or can they also seek a "multifacted life with many kinds of 
rewards?" That's the right question, and a pretty good answer -- all in one. 
</P>
<P>
For her part, Mrs. Bush said she thought the protesters "were very reasonable," 
but that "I don't think they understand where I'm coming from. I chose to live 
the life I've lived." 
</P>
<P>
If young Wellesley students are puzzled by her choice, it may be because 
they're uncertain about the nature of choice itself. But they sure are asking 
the right questions right now.

In your editorial does the reference to "the arrogant cant of unthinking 
zealots" include the criticisms of countless medical doctors who have spoken 
out against animal experimentation? 
</P>
<P>
Among these enlightened physicians was Dr. Charles Mayo, founder of the 
world-renowed Mayo Clinic, who said, "I abhor vivisection. It should at least 
be curbed. Better, it should be abolished. I know of no achievement through 
vivisection, no scientific discovery, that could not have been obtained without 
such barbarism and cruelty. The whole thing is evil."

The weakness of your argument lies in couching it in "either-or" terms. 
</P>
<P>
You view life as a hierarchy. It's not -- it's a monarchy. When we seek to 
advance humankind by experimenting, inflicting pain, and, ultimately killing a 
fellow creature we do so by sacrificing all semblance of human character. We 
are called as stewards, not despots. To advocate that these must die that we 
may live is the mentality that has turned the earth into a dunghill.

CRACKDOWN IS STEMMING CREDIT FLOW; 
</P>
<P>
BANKS ARE NOW UNDER INTENSE SCRUTINY AND SMALL BUSINESSES ARE FEELING THE 
PRESSURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KUTTNER, Robert Kuttner is economics correspondent of the New 
Republic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many small businesses are being harmed by something that supposedly no longer 
happens: a credit crunch caused by a wave of banking failures. 
</P>
<P>
The crunch is most severe in the Northeast, which is on the brink of a regional 
recession, and in the South, which absorbed more than its share of bank and 
thrift collapses. 
</P>
<P>
Evidently, the regulators in charge of banking standards are not the same 
regulators responsible for making sure that sound businesses can get credit. 
The Federal Reserve sets monetary policy nationally. But banks fail regionally. 
And though the Federal Reserve is organized by region, the 12 regional Federal 
Reserve banks don't operate independent credit policies. 
</P>
<P>
Before 1913, when the Federal Reserve was created, banking panics regularly led 
to loans being called and a sharp contraction of the supply of credit. 
Perfectly sound businesses went under because they couldn't roll over their 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
The creation of a central banking system was hailed as the solution to the 
problem. But in the Great Depression, despite the Federal Reserve, loan 
defaults and runs on banks pushed thousands of banks into insolvency. The 
solution to that problem was federal deposit insurance, invented in 1933. 
Together, a central bank and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
supposedly relegated credit crunches to the history books. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, the old dilemma of credit crunch is beginning to reappear. And 
this time, ironically, the federal banking agencies may be part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, President Reagan's bank regulators jumped on the 
deregulation bandwagon. Federally insured banks were permitted to engage in all 
sorts of speculative transactions. After insured lenders piled up hundreds of 
billions of dollars in losses, the chastened regulators finally cracked down on 
the banks -- as well they should. 
</P>
<P>
But many small businesses find themselves caught in the middle. In 
Massachusetts, surveys show that 150 healthy manufacturing firms are having 
difficulty rolling over normal operating loans. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial and industrial loan volume grew at a robust 17% in 1985, 24% in 
1986, 8% in 1987, and turned negative in 1989. Consumer loans also shrank by 
12% last year, after several years of high growth. Real-estate loans grew by an 
astounding 42% in 1985, 51% in 1986, and 32% in 1987. They barely grew at all 
in 1989 and actually began to shrink last winter. 
</P>
<P>
It is normal for credit to shrink somewhat in a recession. In the case of real 
estate, the problem isn't mainly higher bank standards but overbuilding in the 
mid-1980s. When unsold condos and unrented offices pile up, developers stop 
building -- not for lack of credit but for lack of customers. 
</P>
<P>
But there is also evidence that a credit crunch is beginning to contribute to 
the economic distress of ordinary businesses. Several of the large banks of the 
Northeast and Southeast have had to sell off or write off loans in order to 
satisfy bank regulators. 
</P>
<P>
When loans go bad, a bank finds itself with too many loans on its books 
relative to the bank's own capital. The bank examiners demand that shaky banks 
either raise additional capital (which is usually impossible) or get rid of 
some loans in order to restore a prudent ratio of capital to loans. 
</P>
<P>
In the Northeast, the largest regional banks have just come through a searing 
going-over by teams of bank examiners. The same intense scrutiny is now being 
applied to the banks of the Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
In such times, loan officers pull in their horns. They don't want any more 
trouble occurring on their watch. Banks feel under pressure to improve the 
quality of their loan portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
Blue-chip bank customers make out fine, but many small businesses with good 
credit ratings complain that they suddenly can't get credit. In a financial 
squeeze, banks find that it costs almost as much to make a $20,000 loan as a 
$20-million loan -- and the small loan isn't worth the trouble. 
</P>
<P>
It is understandable that the first priority of the bank examiners is to limit 
further drains on taxpayer-supported deposit insurance. But somehow, they have 
to reconcile that goal with the goal of keeping credit flowing. 
</P>
<P>
When Wall Street went into cardiac arrest in October, 1987, the Federal Reserve 
ordered the money spigots turned wide open to keep the financial crash from 
becoming a full-blown recession. If the Fed did that for Wall Street, it should 
do no less for Main Street.

WHITSON PADRES' COMPLETE MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Someone's got to tell Padre pitcher Ed Whitson that it's not supposed to work 
this way. Come on, where's the man's etiquette? 
</P>
<P>
Everyone knows that if you're a big-league starting pitcher these days, you've 
got to be sitting on the disabled list, struggling to find your control, or at 
the very least, bailing out of games after six or seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
The spring-training lockout was the perfect excuse, anyway, remember? Hey, it's 
the owners who wanted to play hard ball. So they were going to have be the ones 
suffering the consequences when their pitchers spent the first couple of months 
with sore arms, ERAs soaring higher than the consumer price index, and complete 
games becoming as common as solidarity in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is that Eddie Lee Whitson never has been one to conform to the 
status quo, and what he's doing now -- with all due respect to Dave Stewart of 
Oakland, Frank Viola of the New York Mets and Nolan Ryan of Texas -- is showing 
up just about every starting pitcher in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson pitched an 8-3 complete-game victory Sunday afternoon over the Chicago 
Cubs in front of a subdued sellout crowd of 34,077, enabling the Padres to 
leave town with as many victories (two) at Wrigley Field in 21 hours as they 
had obtained in their previous three years at the so-called friendly confines. 
</P>
<P>
Heck, the last time the Padres even won a series at Wrigley was July 16-18, 
1984, and never had they won a game by such a lopsided margin at Wrigley since 
June 1, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson, the man who will turn 35 years old in two weeks, has now thrown three 
complete games. 
</P>
<P>
To lend a little perspective to that feat, consider this: Whitson not only has 
more complete games than every pitcher in the major leagues, but has more 
complete games than 24 entire major-league pitching staffs. 
</P>
<P>
The secret to Whitson's success, you ask? Wait until you get a load of this 
one. 
</P>
<P>
"The lockout," Whitson says. "If it wasn't for the lockout, I don't think I'd 
be pitching like this. See, I was working out all winter, two times a day, five 
days a week. So when the Players Association told us to stop working out, I was 
way ahead of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going through my worst time in spring training, that's when I had my 
dead arm. I think other guys are going through that now, and that's giving me 
the advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel better now than any time I ever have in my life. I feel like a kid 
again, only I'm pitching better." 
</P>
<P>
Whitson (3-1) has been so dominant this season that he has yet to throw more 
than 100 pitches in a single game, and what he did Sunday afternoon simply was 
obscene. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson, who allowed eight hits and three runs, threw a career-equalling low 84 
pitches the entire game, and not once did he throw more than 14 pitches in a 
single inning. In contrast, Cub starter Mike Bielecki threw 38 pitches alone in 
the first inning, lasting just 4 2/3 innings, leaving with a 5-1 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson's control was so sharp in this game that he threw just 19 balls, 
including six in the final four innings. He threw 25 first-pitch strikes to the 
35 batters he faced, resulting in nine first-pitch outs, and four first-pitch 
hits. Not only didn't he walk anyone, he never even reached a full-count on any 
batter. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us have a lot of fun playing behind Whitson," said Padre shortstop 
Garry Templeton, who went three for four. "He pitches so fast, he keeps you 
right on your toes. In the past, he tried to throw 95 mph and knock the bat out 
of everyone's hands, but now he's learned that you don't have to strike out 
everyone to win." 
</P>
<P>
Said Whitson: "I just wish I had learned that 10 years ago. The bottom line is 
winning, that's why I'm out there. I don't care if I throw 160 pitches, just 
give me that W." 
</P>
<P>
And certainly the way the Padres have fared at Wrigley in their history, 
they'll take that 'W" any way they can get it. The Padres had lost 16 of their 
past 18 games at Wrigley entering the weekend, and 26 of 34 since the 1984 
World Series. Yet, here they were Sunday, scoring four runs in the first inning 
and recording their first laugher at Wrigley in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Second baseman Roberto Alomar, who was batting third for just the second time 
of his professional career because of the back injury to first baseman Jack 
Clark, was the offensive catalyst by going four for five with two RBIs and a 
stolen base. It was the third four-hit game of Alomar's career. 
</P>
<P>
"I would really like to hit third because I get a chance to drive people in," 
Alomar said. "It makes me a more aggressive hitter, and that's the way I want 
to be." 
</P>
<P>
But as much as Whitson relished his complete game, Alomar enjoyed his four-hit 
game, and Santiago admired his two-run homer, perhaps no one was more thrilled 
by this victory than right fielder Tony Gwynn. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn was taunted and ridiculed throughout the series by the bleacher bums, 
most focusing on his weight. Some of it, he could tolerate. He even grinned 
when a guy yelled out, 'Why don't you put some butter between those buns?" But 
most of it was cruel. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it was Gwynn who got the last laugh, going six for 13 in the series, 
including a three-for-five outing Sunday with three runs. 
</P>
<P>
"They really get on me here, ever since the '84 playoffs," Gwynn said. "It's 
really tough to concentrate. You try to do your job, but they still yell at 
you, calling you every name in the book. 
</P>
<P>
"But this time, everything worked out Ok. I can't even remember the last time 
we were able to leave here with a smile on our face. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me tell you, it's a nice feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mike Dunne of the Padres' triple-A club in Las Vegas threw a no-hitter Sunday 
night against Portland. Dunne is in Las Vegas on a rehabilitation assignment 
and is expected to join the Padres within three weeks.

JOHNSON TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING; 
</P>
<P>
TWO-SPORT STANDOUT: VENTURA COLLEGE BASEBALL AND FOOTBALL STAR IS HAVING 
TROUBLE DECIDING WHERE TO FOCUS HIS TALENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many who know John Johnson believe the two-sport standout at Ventura College 
can become a major college running back or a major league baseball player. What 
he can't do -- at the moment, at least -- is make a major decision: Should he 
focus his considerable talent on baseball or football? 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who is completing his freshman year at Ventura, had a chance to play 
football at the University of Arizona this past season. He also had an 
opportunity to play minor league baseball in the Seattle Mariner organization. 
Instead, the 1989 Channel Islands High graduate stayed home and attended 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"At this time in my life, Ventura is the best place for me," said Johnson, who 
in the past year saw his chance to attend a four-year school undermined by his 
performance on college-entrance tests. 
</P>
<P>
"It's giving me time to figure out what I want to do, and allowing me to get a 
better feel for what is expected of me in the classroom. Right now, I'd say 
people can probably expect me to be back here next year doing the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
But a few moments later, Johnson admitted he "very well could be in a minor 
league uniform by this summer." Then, shortly after that, he spoke glowingly of 
his longtime dream of becoming a star running back for a major college. 
</P>
<P>
It seems the closer Johnson gets to deciding what to do with his life, the more 
confused he becomes. Although he considers himself a "kid at heart," some of 
the decisions he will have to make in the near future are anything but kids' 
stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura baseball Coach Gary Anglin, who played football and baseball at Ventura 
from 1970-71, understands Johnson's dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely a tough spot to be in," Anglin said. "When you decide to go 
out for a sport on the college level, the coaches expect you to give it 110 
percent. You also have to worry more about academics than you did in high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"So when you decide to do two sports, the demands are even greater. It doesn't 
leave a young man much free time." 
</P>
<P>
Anglin has told Johnson that he would help him weigh his options but that he 
wouldn't make a decision for him. 
</P>
<P>
Former Ventura football Coach Phil Passno, who resigned at the end of the 1989 
season, said: "John goes out for a sport for all of the right reasons. He wants 
to help his team, he loves sports, and he's very competitive. Those are the 
reasons we have athletics, and that's why John has a hard time giving any of it 
up. He's having too much fun. And there's nothing wrong with that." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 19, is the youngest of four brothers who had outstanding athletic 
careers at Channel Islands. Bruce (who graduated in 1977), Hilria ('80) and 
Steve ('83) all played football and earned all-league honors. Joel Gershon, who 
is in his 16th year as Channel Islands' football coach, said everyone in 
Johnson's family kept telling him John would be the best. 
</P>
<P>
"John certainly lived up to everyone's expectations," Gershon said. "He made a 
tremendous impact on our program." 
</P>
<P>
In three years as a starting running back, Johnson rushed for 3,475 yards and 
scored 42 touchdowns and 264 points. He was voted to the all-league team three 
times and the all-Southern Section team twice. With Johnson in the backfield, 
the Raiders won two Marmonte League titles and a Southern Section championship. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson had his share of injuries, including severe wounds sustained in an 
unprovoked shooting last November, but he has learned to play with pain. One 
week after undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery midway through his senior 
season, Johnson rushed for 104 yards in a victory over Huntington Park. He 
missed only one game that season and finished with 1,185 yards and eight 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to the knee surgery, the list of colleges trying to sign him was long. 
After the setback, only UCLA and Arizona were interested. And when Johnson was 
having trouble getting 700 points on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, the score 
necessary to be eligible for athletics as a freshman, only Arizona maintained 
contact. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson never received the needed SAT score; Arizona officials told him to 
attend a junior college, and said that if he performed well academically they 
would give him a scholarship for his final two years of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
"If we made John Johnson a deal, then it still stands," said Bill Logan, 
football recruiting coordinator at Arizona. "In fact, we have two players on 
our team who play baseball, so the fact that John is a two-sport athlete 
doesn't bother us a bit." 
</P>
<P>
Upset over his dwindling prospects in football, Johnson turned to baseball and 
excelled in his senior season at Channel Islands. He batted .412 in 24 games 
with five home runs and 15 runs batted in. Johnson, an infielder, was selected 
in the 54th round of June's amateur draft by Seattle and was promised a signing 
bonus if he had an all-star season in the minors.

"It wasn't a total surprise to be drafted," said Johnson, 5-feet-10 1/2, 206 
pounds. "But baseball had always been my second sport to football. Now I was in 
a position of contemplating a career in the sport. I love baseball and 
considered going right into it. But then I thought I should wait and take more 
time to decide." 
</P>
<P>
That decision led him to Ventura, for which his brother Steve was the most 
valuable player in football in 1984. Initially, Johnson planned to go out only 
for the baseball team to try to improve his prospects in this year's amateur 
draft. But as football season approached he had a change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
"We had already been practicing for 10 days when John came by and said he felt 
he could make a contribution to the team and wanted to play," Passno said. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, Johnson was a third-string tailback in a scrimmage against 
Hancock College. The first time he touched the ball he went 60 yards for a 
touchdown. He finished with 88 yards on four carries. 
</P>
<P>
Five games into the season, Johnson was starting and rolling up yardage. He 
helped the Pirates to a 7-0 record and what promised to be their best season in 
years. Then came a major setback. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 9, two days before a showdown against Moorpark College, Johnson was one 
of five youths injured in a drive-by shooting in the parking lot of a Moorpark 
shopping center. Johnson had just attended a high school game and was with some 
friends when the shooting occurred. Johnson was hit by three shotgun pellets in 
his left leg and took four in his right leg. 
</P>
<P>
He missed the rest of the football season, and Ventura lost its four remaining 
games. Johnson finished with 553 yards on 98 carries (a 5.6-yard average), 
scored three touchdowns, and was voted to the Western State Conference first 
team. He went through rigorous rehabilitation for the next three months to be 
ready for baseball season, and was able to finish his fall courses and 
participate in some winter baseball drills. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said that his right foot and shin have continued to bother him, but 
that he feels "99 percent back to normal." He started at second base in 24 of 
35 games for Ventura this season, batting .274 with 18 runs scored and 12 RBIs 
as the Pirates finished 21-14. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle is still interested in him but is evaluating whether it will draft him 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"We like John and are deciding where he fits and what we want to do with him," 
said Ken Compton, the Mariners' Southern California scout. "He's got potential 
with a bat, but he needs to find a position. He's definitely not an infielder." 
</P>
<P>
Even if Johnson is drafted again and receives a lucrative contract, he might 
not play baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I have to say I'm leaning toward baseball because there's less 
contact, and I envision a longer career in the sport because of that," Johnson 
said. "The knee injuries really forced me to re-evaluate things. I look at the 
future and wonder how long my knees will hold up. 
</P>
<P>
"But it would be hard not to play football again. I've been playing the game 
since I was 6, so it's difficult to think I'll never carry the ball again. At 
this point, I guess you could say I'm still very undecided."

TALMI SHOWS SKILL AT TRYING CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Now that Yoav Talmi is about to take over the long-vacant helm of the San Diego 
Symphony, he appears eager to flesh out his identity on the podium. Aspiring 
music directors are ever eager to please, but Talmi is beyond the stage of 
putting his best foot forward. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night at Copley Symphony Hall, Talmi bounded on stage to dazzle his 
ample audience with a rousing -- almost raucous -- rendition of Smetana's 
Overture and "Dance of the Comedians" from his opera "The Bartered Bride." The 
usually mild-mannered Israeli conductor made a point of saber rattling with a 
pair of light-hearted works that readily respond to that approach, although 
Talmi's breakneck tempo pushed the orchestra just beyond its ability to 
maintain a tight ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
In the Prokofiev First violin Concerto, however, the maestro's task was not as 
simple. The mercurial, asymmetrical Concerto is elusive under the best 
conditions, and Talmi had to cope with a soloist who did not appear to have the 
work confidently in his fingers. The symphony drafted American violinist Mark 
Kaplan late Monday after the scheduled violinist Nigel Kennedy canceled due to 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan started with a sterling, well-focused sound and graceful line, but the 
formidable technical demands of the Scherzo kept the soloist scrambling for 
notes. To his credit, Talmi stayed with Kaplan and coaxed a sympathetic 
response from the orchestra. But the Concerto's abundant humor and 
tongue-in-cheek parody of concerto conventions rarely emerged from this overly 
earnest endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
There probably is not much more that can be added to the interpretive lore of 
Tchaikovsky's Sixth Symphony ("Pathetique"), but this hoary relic remains 
sacred to a certain stripe of orchestra aficionado. Talmi preferred to err on 
the side of calm elegance, and he demonstrated that he knows how to let out all 
the stops without destroying the work's basic contours. The Symphony proved to 
be the orchestra's finest hour of the evening, especially in the waltzing 
second movement. Only the finale "Adagio lamentoso" lacked the pathos that is 
usually the work's emotional talisman.

'DARKSIDE' A CLEVER CUT ABOVE HORROR FARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a conformist time, horror stories are often the dark twitches underlying 
complacent society's frozen smiles. Take "Tales From the Darkside: The Movie" 
(citywide), a bloodier version of the horror anthology TV series. On the 
surface, it's another slash-and-bash-a-thon. But we're also treated, sometimes 
cleverly, to an eerie mating of Gothic sadism and contemporary upscale 
amorality. 
</P>
<P>
The movie keeps coming up with cautionary tales about evil modern life: the 
greed, lies, villainy and killing rage lying just below polished exteriors. 
Rich, dumb college students take advantage of their poor competitors and get 
paid in kind, a sleazy old pharmaceuticals king is plagued by a murderous 
cat-vendetta, and a SoHo artist achieves dubious happiness by making a pact 
with a monster. 
</P>
<P>
In all these movies, the Gothic devices of the past -- hellcats, murderous 
mummies, winged, gargoyle-devils -- descend upon malefactors of the present, 
tumbling right out of the old E. T. A. Hoffman-Edgar Allen Poe fantasy bag. 
</P>
<P>
And, in the framing story, the cue is "The Arabian Nights." Like Sheherazade, 
the desperate Timmy (Matthew Lawrence), imprisoned in a dungeon by his 
rich-witch captor (Debbie Harry), who wants to cook and eat him, tries to stave 
off the oven with increasingly horrific tales. In all these stories, it's 
suggested that modern life is amoral, full of treachery and evil. With one 
notable exception, there is no justice. Both good and evil suffer in the grip 
of fate or irony. 
</P>
<P>
"Tales From the Darkside" was mostly whipped up by George Romero's horror team. 
His producer is the "Darkside" TV show's Richard Rubinstein; the director, John 
Harrison, was Romero's assistant on "Day of the Dead." Romero himself wrote 
"Cat From Hell" -- adapted from a Stephen King story; everything else was 
written or adapted by Michael McDowell, co-scenarist of "Beetlejuice." 
</P>
<P>
As a horror show, it's a cut -- or a slash or a bloody whack -- above most 
movies of this type: cleverly written, cleverly cast. Harry exudes cheerfully 
vicious yuppie smugness, Christian Slater and Steve Buscemi are properly bent 
as college students involved in a mummy's curse rampage. William Hickey and 
David Johansen are stylishly rotten as the pharmaceuticals king and the hit man 
he's hired to rid him of a possibly demonic cat. James Remar and Rae Dawn Chong 
make an edgy love-binds-all-wounds SoHo artist's couple in "Lover's Vow" the 
most passionate of the pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison, making his directorial debut, uses too much ritzy film noir styling 
and self-conscious comic book frames; his mood is often too jagged and nervous 
and tongue-in-cheek. And that post-'80s horror movie disease -- the sense that 
a yuck or an upchuck is preferable to a frisson or shiver -- is present here, 
too. But there's more brain than usual beneath the blood and guts of "Tales 
From the Darkside" (MPAA rated R, for violence, language and sex). And Johansen 
makes such a terrific foul-mouthed ape of a hired killer that it's almost worth 
it to see his expression when the hell-cat takes its penultimate pounce.

Ex-Priest Accuses Sitcom Theft: Mystery writer William X. Kienzle is accusing 
ABC-TV and 20th Century Fox of stealing an idea for a sitcom based on life in a 
Roman Catholic rectory. Kienzle and five Detroit-area Roman Catholic priests 
have filed suit in a Detroit federal court, seeking more than $1 million in 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
Kienzle is an ex-priest turned author whose priest-sleuth character, Father 
Koesler, is featured in several books and the movie "The Rosary Murders." With 
the help of his priest friends, Kienzle said, he wrote a treatment for a 
proposed comedy series involving four priests in an inner-city rectory. The 
idea was submitted to ABC and rejected in 1980. According to the suit, ABC and 
Fox used Kienzle's outline to create the short-lived show "Have Faith" last 
year. BETH KLEID

Getty Won't Get Sculpture: The J. Paul Getty Museum was denied a license to 
export a $12-million sculpture after the British government announced new 
guidelines to keep art treasures in Britain. The Department of Trade and 
Industry announced Friday that works of art considered important to Britain's 
heritage cannot be exported if a British buyer can be found. The Getty Museum 
applied to export Canova's "Three Graces," a 19th-Century statue of three 
standing nude women, from Britain in March 1989, after its $12.4-million bid 
was accepted by the sculpture's owners, a trust in Britain's Caribbean Cayman 
Islands colony. BETH KLEID

BROWN BRINGS RETROSPECTIVE PROGRAM TO ROYCE HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Time can be unkind to radicals. Take post-Cunningham dance doyenne Trisha 
Brown, whose company wound up a retrospective 20th-anniversary tour with two 
different programs over the weekend at Royce Hall, UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
In the early '70s, when it was new, Brown's "Sticks" impressed observers as a 
serious, laborious task-oriented piece in which five women, lying head-to-foot 
in a line, made a daisy chain of poles held above their bodies. The job was to 
complete a revolution without breaking the connections. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, when the piece was viewed as incorporated into the composite work, 
"Line Up," the audience laughed. And why not? Seen after Brown's high-energy 
"Set and Reset" (sets by Robert Rauschenberg; music by Laurie Anderson), such 
intense fixation on basic activity struck many as a deliberate joke. 
</P>
<P>
Only as "Line Up" continued its prolonged abstract movement demands did 
audience members succumb to its severity. People begin to leave steadily, a 
sign of Brown's ability to challenge audiences. 
</P>
<P>
No one laughed at Brown's "Astral Convertible" (1989), which received its Los 
Angeles premiere on Saturday, however. But neither did the piece work as well 
as intended. 
</P>
<P>
Rauschenberg again provided a set, this one consisting of eight metal frames, 
ranging from 2 to 8 feet in height, supporting headlights, speakers and 
sensors. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in metallic silvery tights to activate the sensors and thus change Ken 
Tabachnick's lighting designs and Richard Landry's sound score were four men 
(Lance Gries, Gregory Lara, Wil Swanson and David Thomson) and five women 
(Nicole Juralewicz, Carolyn Lucas, Diane Madden, Lisa Schmidt and Shelley 
Senter). 
</P>
<P>
Changes did occur, but the connections with the dancers' movements remained 
unclear (one man could cross the stage without noticeable changes). Any notion 
of confrontation with technology had to be taken on faith. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, there were movement dividends. "Astral" opened with emphasis on 
gravity, with two lines of dancers on the floor, rolling over, extending arms 
upward in parallel or wave movements, eventually rising. The tempo picked up 
and soon the dancers were making flying bounds and leaps, occasional deliberate 
collisions or, in a striking image, a unison cartwheel by a man and a woman. 
Before ending, the work offered a sequence of interlocking shapes and piled-on 
constructions. 
</P>
<P>
The dancers here, as elsewhere in the engagement, looked terrific. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's "Newark (Niweweorce)" (1987), on the Friday program, also was new to 
Los Angeles audiences. (The title is a pun on "New Work" and a reference to a 
Newark in England spelled in Anglo-Saxon times as Niweweorce.) Geography, 
however, plays little part in the piece except as Donald Judd's brightly 
colored backdrops rise and fall to redefine the stage space (Judd also created 
the sound score, which alternates buzzing drones and silence). 
</P>
<P>
Rather, Brown seemed intent upon juxtaposing and ultimately integrating 
contrasting movement qualities, with Gries and Lara initially executing slow, 
heavy parallel movements as Juralewicz, Lucas, Madden and Senter darted in and 
out; and ending in weighty athletic partnering challenges. 
</P>
<P>
"Lateral Pass" and "Opal Loop," seen on previous company tours, completed the 
programs. CHRIS PASLES

MORCA DANCE THEATRE AT BECKMAN AUDITORIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELLEY BAUMSTEN WAGERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Teodoro Morca brought what seemed incomparable power, grace and technique 
Friday to Beckman Auditorium at Caltech, where Morca Dance Theatre presented an 
evening of flamenco in concert. Take the dynamic contrasts of his writhing, 
strutting, percussive "Solea por Bulerias", ornamented with glyphic arms and 
hands, and informed with his evident pride and joy in performing. 
</P>
<P>
Or "Cantina de Gracia," with the rhythmic complexity of his soft and staccato 
riffs unaccompanied except by clapping hands, and his nailed-to-the-floor 
footwork flung into traveling steps that redefined space. 
</P>
<P>
Morca's farruca in the "Cuadro Flamenco" was dazzling in its command of space 
and in footwork that recalled the rhythmic intricacies of Indian kathak 
dancing. 
</P>
<P>
His partnering of Isabel Morca, wife and co-director, breathed life into 
courtly cliches in "Cantina de Gracia," "Ay, Ay, la Cana," and "La Coqueteria." 
He seemed to live only to admire her, and she only to be adored by him. A 
flamenco dancer lacking a fluid line and distinct personality, she contributed 
little more to the performance. 
</P>
<P>
Not so Gerardo Alcala and Roberto Zamora. Alcala's fluttering and sobbing "Solo 
de Guitarra" evoked the glaring light and deep shadows of southern Spain. 
Zamora's chanting, wailing songs gave fluent voice to flamenco longing. The 
interplay between them, and the gradual unleashing of their reserve lent a 
sense of improvisation on familiar forms. SHELLEY BAUMSTEN WAGERS

Calling Vera Lynn. 
</P>
<P>
The British singer, whose distinctive voice and mellow songs saw thousands of 
Britons through the blitz and bombs of World War II and who became the 
unofficial emblem of an era, is about all that's missing from Craig Noel's 
tender production of "And a Nightingale Sang" at the Old Globe. 
</P>
<P>
It's nostalgia time. 
</P>
<P>
C. P. Taylor's wartime reminiscence, which opened Thursday, will remind older 
viewers of such World War II film sagas as Noel Coward's "In Which We Serve" or 
the throbbing Vivien Leigh-Robert Taylor starrer, "Waterloo Bridge": 
bittersweetness with an edge. 
</P>
<P>
The edge here is a solid-gold ensemble of Old Globe familiars, headed by Kandis 
Chappell (who would brighten a recitation of the Yellow Pages on a rainy day) 
and including the superior character skills of Katherine McGrath, Mitchell 
Edmonds, Jonathan McMurtry and Lynne Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
The staging is beautifully calibrated by Noel and lovingly detailed by scenic 
designer Kent Dorsey, Jeff Ladman's vivid sound score, Lewis Brown's 
period-perfect costumes and Peter Maradudin's pools of light. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey cleverly sets his working-class interior within a cut-out of the house 
-- complete with chimney tops -- backed by a sky made up of headlines of the 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Would that such stylishness all around served a less predictable script. For 
all of Taylor's fondness, "Nightingale" is sitcom with a touch of soap, a 
well-made comedy that chronicles the eccentricities of a spunky working-class 
family in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne during the war years, long on individual quirks 
and short on surprises. 
</P>
<P>
We follow the fortunes of the Stott family mostly through the eyes and voice of 
the lame older daughter, Helen (Chappell). The madcap household (what do they 
work at?) consists of Helen's ever-cheerful if quite enigmatic father, George 
(Edmonds), who seems to live and develop spontaneous political theories at his 
piano; Helen's giddy younger sister, Joyce (Griffin), who can't decide if she 
wants to marry soldier-boy Eric (James Lancaster) or stay married to him after 
the fact; Helen's itinerant grandfather Andie, who mopes around, punctuating 
the comedy with truisms as he sashays in and out of their lives (McMurtry in 
one of his more delicious old-man takes) -- and Helen's "Mam" Peggy (McGrath), 
a devoutly hysterical churchwoman born to worry about the lot of them. 
</P>
<P>
No such play would be complete without a taciturn stranger (played with 
tenderness and just enough mystery by Alan Brooks), entering the household as 
Eric's buddy and invading Helen's plucky heart. It's a bittersweet romance with 
foreseeable turns of events. Which is precisely the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its individually touching funny or spirited scenes (there's no lack of 
spirit in this production), "Nightingale" as a play sails too smoothly from 
point A to point Z. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Helen -- and, arguably, of her lover -- the characters 
neither grow nor reveal much more of themselves by the end than they did at the 
start. 
</P>
<P>
This complacency shrinks the show to the level of feel-good theater -- 
palliative panorama. Nothing requires that we participate -- or be moved. We 
watch, smile, laugh, go home, forget. Might as well turn on the telly. 
</P>
<P>
Nice. But the Old Globe usually demands better and more from its audience. And 
should.

USIU BALLET SHINES DESPITE SCHOOL'S WOES

<P>
United States International University's International Ballet launched five new 
works during a three-performance weekend run at the Lyceum Theatre. It was the 
first concert of the 1989-90 season for the University-based ensemble (two 
scheduled dates were canceled in a desperate cost-cutting measure by the 
beleaguered institution). 
</P>
<P>
But despite the dark clouds that continue to hover over the university, there 
was a surge of creativity in the dance department during this tumultuous year 
-- judging from the bounty of ambitious new works unveiled at the Lyceum. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's program alone featured three major premieres, all with strong dance 
values. Among them was an emotion-charged work by James Kelly, titled "Elgar 
Cello Concerto," which probed the devastating impact of AIDS on the family. 
</P>
<P>
An austere approach to set and costume design for all but one of the premieres 
was the only serious reminder of the company's financial crunch. 
Black-and-white Balanchine-style leotards and tights dressed the new balletic 
offerings, and Kelly's dance drama was played out with only a mere suggestion 
of decor. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the mournful mahogany tones of Edward Elgar's Cello Concerto were 
enough to set the mood for this urgent elegy to the extended victims of AIDS. 
This complex study of grief and pain focused on relationships -- mother and 
son, boy and lover, even other siblings -- as it unfolded in an evanescent 
series of changing groupings on the near-empty stage. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly resisted the obvious temptation of wallowing in mimed movement and 
melodrama to tell his tale. Instead, he let the dance vocabulary spell out the 
tragedy on its own terms. Edgar Zendejas (as the son), and the choreographer 
himself were standouts in this mixed cast. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Rowe Wistrich, who choreographed three of the four works on Friday's 
roster, came out of retirement to lend her dramatic presence to the 
heart-wrenching role of the mother. And she gave a riveting performance, 
although Rowe Wistrich is well past her prime as a dancer. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, a troubled sound system marred the music that drove the 
impassioned work to its inevitable conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
Not all the dancers in Rowe Wistrich's "Piano Concerto 2" were fleet- footed 
and technically secure enough to keep up with the choreographer's unflinching 
demands. But the well-rehearsed ensemble never flagged in its attempt to stay 
on top of the mercurial rhythms of Dimitri Shostakovich's score. And several of 
the dancers showed laudable promise and performing brio as they whizzed through 
its neo-classic moves. 
</P>
<P>
A male shortfall brought artistic director Steve Wistrich into the act Friday 
night to flesh out the ranks and partner Cindy Ricalde in the lyrical second 
movement. Wistrich too has traded in his ballet shoes for a teaching role. 
Happily, vestiges of his expressive movement style remained beautifully intact 
as he played porter to the aspiring ballerina. 
</P>
<P>
Rowe Wistrich challenged her young charges again in the enigmatic "Straw Feet," 
set to an original percussive score by Brian Kohn. 
</P>
<P>
This inspired kinetic work was chock full of invention, and the ensemble was at 
its best in the 12-part ballet. A predatory solo for long-legged Angela Rivera 
-- etched against an eerie green projection on the backdrop -- set the wheels 
of the dance in motion. 
</P>
<P>
Following closely on Rivera's heels was a series of hurried duets that echoed 
the ominous undercurrent in the music. Jeanne Uy and Hugo Carreon were 
particularly well suited to the organic moves of the Third Theme. 
</P>
<P>
Zendejas showed his stuff to excellent advantage as well, spinning like a top 
to the percolating rhythms with the outstretched finger motif that ran rampant 
through the piece. 
</P>
<P>
Rowe Wistrich made no concessions to the cast's student status in "Straw Feet," 
and created a work worthy of any serious dance troupe. 
</P>
<P>
The finale on Friday's program, Rowe Wistrich's staging of the classic 
"Raymonda Variations," was danced with a live orchestra in the pit. Despite 
some obvious weak spots, USIU's International Orchestra (under the careful 
baton of Kerry Duse), was a welcome improvement over the poorly-delivered 
canned music heard during the rest of the concert. 
</P>
<P>
This standard repertory work featured a tutued corps in complex designs, 
juxtaposed with the glorious sounds of Alexander Glazounov's ballet music. 
</P>
<P>
Anna Wilcoxson -- a pixie of a dancer -- is not quite the temptress the role 
demands, and Kelly lacks the line of a classic danseur but they made an 
appealing pair in the Grand Pas de Deux. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad the troupe could not muster a more sinewy dancer for the sensuous 
female variation. However, the spritely folk dancing by four lively couples was 
delightful, and the opening waltz was well danced. 
</P>
<P>
The International Ballet Company has come a long way this year, even if most of 
the growing took place out of sight of an audience.

ROMANIANS FLOOD INTO MOLDAVIA FOR REUNION;

SOVIET UNION: REPUBLIC'S BORDER CROSSINGS OPENED. ANOTHER DIVIDED PEOPLE 
TESTIFIES TO DESIRE FOR UNITY.

<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Romanians surged across the border with Soviet 
Moldavia on Sunday in what was intended as a ceremony of friendship but 
testified to a strong demand for unity among another of Europe's divided 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Eight border crossings were thrown open to Romanians without visas, allowing 
the first unhindered movement in 50 years between the divided halves of 
Moldavia. 
</P>
<P>
The scene was as joyful as the mingling of East and West Germans when the 
Berlin Wall was opened last Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
The six-hour reunion was billed as an occasion for cultural reunion among 
Moldavians divided in 1940, when Soviet dictator Josef Stalin seized part of 
the region under a secret deal with Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's revelers threw flowers into the Prut River that divides the region, 
and hundreds, frustrated by the wait to press across crowded bridges, jumped 
into the chilly waters to swim across for impromptu reunions. More than 300,000 
were reported at Leuseny, about 40 miles west of the Moldavian capital of 
Kishinev. 
</P>
<P>
Political changes in the Soviet Union under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and 
in Romania since the toppling and execution of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu made 
Sunday's events possible. 
</P>
<P>
For decades, the Kremlin strove to limit contacts between Moldavia and Romania 
and steadfastly maintained that the Moldavians were a separate nation with a 
separate language. One of the Soviet officials who carried out that 
"de-Romanification" policy was the late President Leonid I. Brezhnev, who 
served as Communist Party first secretary in Moldavia before being brought to 
Moscow under Nikita S. Khrushchev. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet government agreed to the open-border event at the urging of 
Moldavian cultural organizations, which wanted to celebrate the republic's 
switch from Moscow time to that of Bucharest, which is one hour earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Moldavians won other concessions from the Kremlin last fall, including 
restoration of the Latin alphabet to write the language that they share with 
Romanians but which for 50 years they had been forced to spell with Cyrillic 
letters. They also have adopted Romania's red, yellow and blue colors for the 
Soviet republic's official flag. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Moldavians began agitating for reunion with their Romanian brothers last 
year, and the campaign has intensified since Ceausescu's fall. 
</P>
<P>
Romanian television Sunday night showed masses gathered along the tree-lined 
banks of the Prut, waving flags and flowers and chanting support for "a greater 
Romania." The call to expand Romania's borders to include the Soviet republic 
has also been a theme of the perpetual anti-government demonstration that has 
been staged in Bucharest's Central University Square for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
However, interim Romanian President Ion Iliescu and other leaders of the 
National Salvation Front favored to win elections May 20 have carefully skirted 
the Moldavian question, fearing accusations from opponents that they foster 
nationalist and expansionist aims that could disrupt relations with both Moscow 
and Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Local officials in Iasi sought to avoid a conflict with Moscow by inviting 
Soviet Moldavian officials to the border crossing for ceremonies marking the 
day of unity. Peasant women from the Soviet side brought loaves of bread and 
baskets of salt -- traditional gifts of welcome in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Moldavia's official ATEM news agency said that people from both sides of the 
river chanted, "Down with the border on the Prut! Let the border be on the 
Dniester!" calling for Moldavia to be reunited with Romania and the border 
shifted to the river that marks Moldavia's present frontier with the Ukraine, 
another Soviet republic. 
</P>
<P>
Moldavian People's Front leader Yuri Rozhko said that at Leuseny and at seven 
other border crossings, more than 500,000 people from both sides came together. 
</P>
<P>
"This is unique," Rozhko said by telephone from the Moldavian capital of 
Kishinev. "Hundreds of relatives have met at last who hadn't seen each other 
for 40 years and more." 
</P>
<P>
Williams reported from Bucharest, and Dahlburg reported from Moscow.

EX-HOSTAGE REED TELLS OF BEATINGS; 
</P>
<P>
LEBANON: THE ANGRY AMERICAN EDUCATOR SAYS HE MADE TWO ESCAPE ATTEMPTS. HIS

<P>
Former hostage Frank H. Reed, appearing stronger and angrier at the end of a 
week of freedom, said Sunday that his kidnapers in Lebanon beat him severely, 
broke his jaw, his nose, some ribs and his feet after two unsuccessful escape 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
In what he described as "four days of hell" after his first attempt, Reed said 
he was struck more than 200 times about his head and body, and his legs and 
feet were beaten with a metal rod. 
</P>
<P>
"As part of my punishment, and I won't go into the details of that, they tried 
to break my feet and hit my feet many, many times with . . . a cement 
reinforcement rod, and my feet have been slightly broken, which is an Arab way 
of punishing you to remind you of what you did," he said. "I did everything in 
my power not to cry out." 
</P>
<P>
After a second escape attempt and a beating with a rifle two days later, he 
said he was kept in solitary confinement for at least two years. He did not 
clearly outline the dates involved, but he noted that following his release 
from solitary confinement, he was chained to the wall or a radiator in an 
apartment, blindfolded and forced to lie on his back 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
Reed lost 45 pounds and said he is suffering from severe anemia and still feels 
pain as a result of the beatings. 
</P>
<P>
"Twice I tried to escape from the clutches of Hezbollah and twice, obviously, I 
was caught," he said. "The first time that I was caught I spent about four days 
of hell. Thank God it didn't kill me." 
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old educator from Massachusetts was freed by his Islamic kidnapers 
last Monday, eight days after the release of another American hostage, Robert 
Polhill. 
</P>
<P>
Reed provided the first details of his ordeal at a press conference in a 
suburban Washington hotel in which he called on the U.S. government to open 
talks to free the remaining six Americans and 10 other Westerners held in 
Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"The duty . . . is to negotiate even if you have to get in bed with the devil," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats from Iran and Syria, which assisted in freeing Reed and Polhill, said 
Sunday that further hostage releases depend on "goodwill gestures" from the 
United States, specifically pressure on Israel to release an estimated 500 
Shiites imprisoned in Southern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"The easiest gesture is to release these hostages," Kamal Kharrazi, Iran's U.N. 
ambassador, said. "And I believe it's very easy for the United States 
government to contact Israel and encourage them to release these hostages." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N. Y.), one of three senators who attended 
Reed's press conference, urged Israel to release its prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
"Any nation that wishes to be treated as a law-abiding nation must show respect 
for the laws to which it is bound," Moynihan said. "That applies to Israel. 
They cannot hold hostages. We hope they hear us." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush has refused to open direct negotiations with hostage takers and 
has rebuffed Iranian suggestions that the United States must take some action 
to reward Iran and Syria for their part in winning the release of Reed and 
Polhill. Instead, Bush has said, the United States will offer goodwill gestures 
only after all the American hostages are released. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bush has encouraged the release of "all hostages," the White House has 
refused to say whether it considers the prisoners held by Israel to be 
hostages. Other Administration officials have suggested that the United States 
might welcome Israeli action, but as one Administration source closely involved 
with hostage negotiations put it, Israel "knows exactly what to do. We don't 
need to bang them over the head." 
</P>
<P>
The remaining American hostages are Terry A. Anderson, chief Mideast 
correspondent for the Associated Press, Thomas Sutherland, Joseph J. Cicippio, 
Edward Austin Tracy, Alann Steen and Jesse Jonathan Turner. 
</P>
<P>
During his 44 months in captivity, Reed said he crossed paths with Anderson and 
was held in the same apartment house as Irishman Brian Keenan and Briton John 
McCarthy. He said all three men were in excellent physical condition when he 
last saw them. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 3 1/2 years, Reed said he was on his back, except when he was 
exercising, eating or making trips to the toilet. 
</P>
<P>
The beatings and abuse "went on and on and on for a long time," he said. "Then 
sometime about a year (after his second escape attempt), one pig of a man who 
constantly haggled me broke my ribs, kicked my ribs in on the right side. I'd 
managed somehow to push them back lying on my back." 
</P>
<P>
Along with the beatings, Reed said the ordeal of a hostage is worse than that 
of a prisoner because of the uncertainty and isolation. 
</P>
<P>
"Prisoners have a sentence," he said. "What we were faced with was endless 
time. Prisoners have visitors, exercise. We had none of those things. I have 
been lying on my back for 3 1/2 years, chained to a wall or a radiator." 
</P>
<P>
He said he used matches to draw a picture of his 9-year-old son, Tarek, on the 
back of his door and a picture of his wife, Fahima, on the ceiling above his 
bed. 
</P>
<P>
Reed and Polhill were the first American hostages released since 1983, when 
three others were freed as part of the secret arms-for-hostages deal between 
the United States and Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Polhill said at the press conference that he was not mistreated during more 
than three years in captivity. "I was as shocked as you were to hear what Frank 
was saying," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Reed, smiling and singing, arrived at the press conference with his wife and 
son and two daughters. With his arm around Tarek, Reed said he was looking 
forward to a fishing trip with his son at Sebago Lake in Maine. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to catch some salmon, we hope," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Reed was beaming and cheerful. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm feeling OK," he said. "I'm a little weak from not having lived very much, 
no living muscles." 
</P>
<P>
Reed's doctors reported Saturday they were pleased with how he looked even 
though his weight had dropped from about 185 pounds to about 140. Doctors said 
their early evaluations were good and they expected Reed to remain at the 
Andrews Air Force Base, Md., medical center probably until the end of the week.

LATEST WAVE OF CAMPAIGN REFORM HOMES IN ON MEDIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid mounting disgust with what many consider the distorted and trivial nature 
of recent political campaigns, a new wave of reform is building to clean up 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
But while previous reform efforts were aimed largely at campaign financing, the 
new ones focus on the media, both on how the candidates use television and on 
how the press covers -- or fails to cover -- the political process. 
</P>
<P>
Implicit in these ideas is recognition of the increasing importance of the 
media in politics, and of the 30-second TV spot as a focal point of American 
political discourse. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no firm consensus that this current spate of ideas actually will 
make campaigns more relevant. Some consider the proposals illegal, impractical 
or just plain inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
Others question the basic premise behind the reforms, contending that the 
deplorable state of campaigning today is not the cause of bad government, but 
only the symptom. 
</P>
<P>
These analysts believe the country is in a period of political drift, with 
governing institutions and leaders in both parties gridlocked. Under these 
circumstances, they argue, the proposed reforms would help clean up politics 
only at the margins. 
</P>
<P>
"I think before campaigns can change, the political environment has to change," 
pollster Andrew Kohut said in an interview at a conference on media and 
politics at UC Davis -- one of several such recent meetings. "There has to be a 
clear picture of differences between the parties and the candidates on the 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
One of the new wave of proposals calls for requiring political candidates to 
make their television commercials longer in an effort to break the grip of the 
30-second spot. Another would require candidates to appear in their own 
commercials -- at least at the end, where the sponsor of the ad is supposed to 
be identified. Still another suggests that the news media become more 
aggressive in policing campaigns -- even to the point where they deliberately 
shape candidates' agendas. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the solutions, dissatisfaction with the present system is widespread 
-- and intense. "Political campaigns turn the stomach of the average voter," 
complained Sen. John C. Danforth (R-Mo.), in a sentiment echoed by other 
political leaders in both parties. 
</P>
<P>
Examples abound: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the Texas Democratic gubernatorial primary last March, State Treasurer 
Ann Richards was accused of using illegal drugs. She countered by charging her 
chief rival, Mark White, a former governor, with using taxpayers' money to 
"line his pockets." She won the nomination hands down.

<P>
 -- Last autumn's New Jersey gubernatorial contest became known as the 
"Pinocchio campaign" after Republican and Democratic candidates spent 85% of 
their advertising budgets calling each other liars. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In a Wyoming special election for Congress this past spring, the normally 
conventional Casper Star-Tribune got so fed up with "the acid of negativism" 
that was being spread by the major Republican and Democratic candidates that it 
endorsed a Libertarian. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, nasty and distorted campaigning is nothing new to American 
politics. As far back as 1800, presidential candidate Thomas Jefferson was 
attacked as a threat to private property, female chastity and the sanctity of 
religious worship. 
</P>
<P>
But concern over such tactics has increased recently, in part because of 
growing worry about declining voter turnout, which critics blame partly on 
voter turnoff as a result of negative ads. The proportion of Americans who vote 
in presidential elections plunged to 50% in recent years, from 63% in 1960, 
while the turnout in congressional races now is only 37%, compared to 48% three 
decades ago. "Television in general and demagogic advertising in particular" 
are "substantial" factors in that decline, suggests Curtis Gans, head of the 
nonpartisan Committee for the Study of the American Electorate. 
</P>
<P>
Reformers argue that the cleanup also is important because changes such as 
declining U.S. economic clout and the emerging democracies in Eastern Europe 
make it more important than ever that the American electoral process produce 
effective leaders. "Eastern Europeans would be well-advised not to import . . . 
the increasingly shallow nature of electoral campaigns," said Massachusetts 
Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, whose failed 1988 presidential campaign seemed 
incapable of responding to criticisms from George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, politicians contend that criticizing an opponent over issues is a 
legitimate way of campaigning. But critics worry that today's negativism goes 
far beyond that. "Instead of being issue-driven, they focus on what is wrong 
with the character of a candidate," Thomas C. Griscom, a former White House 
communications director, said. 
</P>
<P>
The difference is significant. Analysts say the attacks on a candidate's 
character are more emotional and more prone to distortion, treating issues 
mainly as symbols rather than as the substance of the campaign message. 
</P>
<P>
And most agree that a major reason for this shift is the increasing dominance 
of television in political communication -- particularly through campaign 
advertising. With its propensity for drama, emotion and personalization of 
issues, TV has accentuated the focus on character. 
</P>
<P>
But negative campaigning is on the rise for one simple reason: It works. 
</P>
<P>
One factor is what communications experts call the "information overload" -- 
the plethora of interests competing for public attention, support and money in 
the United States today. "There is a sensory bombardment, and the mind has the 
tendency to get numb," said Mary Matalin, chief of staff of the Republican 
National Committee. As a result, politicians "have to scream louder. And the 
screaming tends to get personal or negative." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, political consultants say the rapid increase in TV 
advertising rates -- which have doubled during the past six years -- 
intensifies the pressure on them to invest campaign funds where they will have 
the most impact. That means greater use of attack ads, whose simple message 
hits home more quickly -- and less expensively -- than so-called "positive" 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the blame, too, may rest with the way the news media cover campaigns, 
critics say, particularly in the case of presidential elections. Network news 
stories average about one minute and 30 seconds -- too short to allow even 
well-meaning candidates to provide much depth. 
</P>
<P>
To make things worse, the time being alloted to the candidates' own words in 
political commercials is shrinking steadily. A study by Daniel Hallin, a 
University of San Diego professor, found that the average "sound bite" -- or 
quotation from a candidate -- has been cut over the past six presidential 
elections, from 43.1 seconds in 1968 to 8.9 seconds in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is television the sole culprit. A study to be released this week by the 
Markle Foundation on how major newspapers and magazines covered the 1988 
presidential election found that only 10% of stories actually dealt with 
issues. Almost 40% focused on who was winning, another 20% highlighted 
conflicts or attacks between candidates, and another 20% highlighted 
qualifications or character. 
</P>
<P>
When the campaign for Texas governor turned nasty this spring, "the press down 
here in Texas just fed on it," State Democratic Chairman Robert Slagle said. 
</P>
<P>
The new ideas for upgrading the campaign process center on four 
</P>
<P>
major factors -- forcing candidates to appear in person in their ads, making 
the commercials longer, offering candidates free or cheaper air time and 
prodding the press into becoming a more forceful referee. 
</P>
<P>
One modest proposal backed in the Senate by Danforth would alter the 
regulations on disclosure of campaign financing to require that candidates show 
their faces in part of their commercials, thus making it plain who is 
responsible for the ads. Current rules require only that the commercial contain 
a statement showing who paid for it. Often these disclosure lines are so small, 
they are all but unreadable. 
</P>
<P>
A more far-reaching approach would impose stringent restrictions on the content 
of ads in exchange for free time for candidates, either donated by the TV 
stations or paid for with federal funds. The government currently can order TV 
stations to give up some air time as part of the requirement for obtaining a 
broadcast license. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Squier, a Democratic media consultant who produced Ann Richards' 
personal attack ads in the Texas campaign, suggests that any new rules forbid 
candidates from even mentioning their opponents in their ads. He also wants to 
see candidates agree not to air 30-second spots -- the shortest, and the 
most-suited-to-attack advertising -- in the final two weeks of a campaign. 
</P>
<P>
With the idea of providing free or federally financed TV time (possibly through 
the use of income-tax checkoffs) gaining momentum on Capitol Hill, some 
reformers also are calling for regulations that would require any candidates 
who accept such free time to appear on camera -- talking -- in their 
commercials. 
</P>
<P>
The hope is that having to appear on camera would give candidates pause about 
attacking their opponents too harshly, and ultimately would prod them into 
using the time to focus on issues. "We should do everything we can that will 
get candidates to articulate their views, or for them to be embarrassed if they 
can't," said Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no guarantee that the new proposals to control the content of 
campaign ads would work -- or even would be legal. Skeptics point out that the 
courts still might declare that such restrictions violate constitutional 
guarantees of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
And some worry that such efforts could backfire. "If you have a system that 
mandates candidates to look into the camera and give the answer," said former 
Republican political consultant Douglas Bailey, "you are mandating that 
candidates must be good at this medium or they will lose the election." 
</P>
<P>
TV executives and political professionals also suspect that the media companies 
that own TV stations will lobby hard against any proposal that might force them 
to lose lucrative advertising time. And some analysts doubt whether taxpayers 
would want to foot the bill for political advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Critics also see problems with the third group of proposals -- those that would 
offer new incentives such as free TV time to encourage the production of ads 
longer than 30 seconds. If Congress adopted one plan, designed to make free ads 
five minutes long, the result (in some crowded primaries) might require 20 to 
40 minutes of free air time each night. And some analysts question whether the 
free time alone would be sufficient to drown out the heavier volume of paid 
ads, many of them negative. 
</P>
<P>
And not all consultants agree that 30-second spots discourage meaningful 
discourse. "I think 30 seconds is fine . . . depending on what your message 
is," said Roger Ailes, President Bush's media adviser, whose negative ads in 
the 1988 presidential campaign have helped fuel some of the debate. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the simplest idea for reform is one championed by Washington Post 
political columnist David Broder: That the press should do a more vigorous job 
of covering politics. In a sense, Broder argues that reporters should no longer 
use the pretense of "objectivity" to remain passive recorders of a campaign; 
instead, they should immediately debunk a candidate's statements on their own 
-- without waiting for the candidate's opponent to do it for them. (The idea of 
reporters pointing out candidates' inaccuracies is not without precedent. It 
has been most recently apparent in the campaign for the California Democratic 
gubernatorial nomination, where some reporters have cited misleading statements 
in TV commercials.) 
</P>
<P>
"The press should be just as willing to set the agenda on issues as it is on 
candidates' private lives," agreed Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the 
Annenberg School of Communications, recalling the coverage of former Colorado 
Sen. Gary Hart's extramarital affairs, which drove him out of the race for the 
1988 Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
But politicians worry that excessive zeal by some reporters could lead to a 
form of journalistic vigilantism. "With all due respect, (increased press 
monitoring) is sort of analogous to judges without juries," the GOP's Matalin 
said. "Who are journalists to set the moral standards for politics?" 
</P>
<P>
But to many analysts, the real weakness with the reform proposals is that they 
fail to address the root of what is wrong with American politics -- a deepening 
malaise that has its roots in the failure of Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society, 
the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal of the Richard M. Nixon 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's Hallin argues that these events brought on a "weakening of 
political consensus and authority" and produced a new political era in which 
neither Democrats nor Republicans have been able to establish an effective 
majority. "The real problem is that the whole process is stalemated," said 
Cornell University political scientist Ben Ginsberg. 
</P>
<P>
Hallin agrees. "There is confusion about what the country stands for and what 
the political process ought to be," he said. "Television is shaped by the 
politics of the country, and so we have the kind of television news we have 
because of the politics we have."

CALIFORNIA IS HEADING TOWARD A NONWHITE MAJORITY. BUT ELECTORAL VICTORIES DO 
NOT AUTOMATICALLY FOLLOW POPULATION GAINS.

Sifting through the embers of his defeat, Jim Hsieh tried to make sense of a 
Cerritos City Council election in which all four nonwhite candidates lost in a 
town so ethnically diverse it has been described as a microcosm of California 
in the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not think of race as a handicap here. But to be honest, image-wise, the 
fact that so many Asians were running might have hurt a little bit," said 
Hsieh, who is Chinese-American. 
</P>
<P>
Hsieh lost in a place where Asians represent nearly 40% of the population. 
Latino candidates suffered defeats in nearby Bell Gardens where Latinos make up 
75% of the population. Late last year, three Latino candidates suffered the 
same fate in Watsonville in Northern California despite a court decision there 
that people thought would pave the way for Latino electoral victories. 
</P>
<P>
By early in the next century, California is expected to be the first state in 
the nation with a nonwhite majority -- more than 30% Latino, 13% Asian and 7% 
black. The balance has already been tipped in Los Angeles where the 1993 
mayoral race could consist of an Asian and two Latinos running for an office 
held by a black. 
</P>
<P>
"Latinos will control California politics. That is what the battle of the '90s 
will be all about," said Stuart Spencer, a Republican Party strategist who has 
advised Ronald Reagan and George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, California politics in the 1990s may reflect its white past as often as it 
heralds the future. Electoral setbacks in Cerritos, Bell Gardens, Watsonville 
and elsewhere in the state should not be taken lightly, analysts warn. As their 
numbers swell, ethnic groups still face roadblocks to political power. Big 
gains in population are not automatically followed by a corresponding rise in 
electoral victories. 
</P>
<P>
Here and there, mostly on city councils and school boards, the complexion of 
California politics is bound to change over the next decade. The Los Angeles 
County Board of Supervisors is likely to gain a Latino member as a result of a 
lawsuit challenging the board's ethnic makeup. The City Council could make room 
for two more Latinos and one more Asian. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, however, say the experts, the political reins in California 
will stay in the hands of whites -- giving a shrinking segment of the 
population a disproportionate share of power. 
</P>
<P>
"The character of the populace and the character of the electorate will draw 
further apart -- the voters increasingly old and white, the people younger and 
nonwhite," said Alan Heslop, director of the Rose Institute, a political 
research center in Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
The barriers to ethnic political power in California are many and varied: 
discrimination; mistrust of politics by refugees fleeing totalitarian regimes; 
the apathy of newcomers who are preoccupied with moving up the economic ladder; 
tension among ethnic groups fighting for jobs and opportunities; the power of 
incumbent politicians and the prohibitive costs of running for office these 
days. 
</P>
<P>
The state's political geography is also a factor. Latino activists believe that 
their advancement continues to be thwarted by gerrymandered electoral districts 
that split Latino voting blocs into ineffectual fragments. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the tendency of some groups, Asians and, increasingly, 
blacks, to spread out into the suburbs weakens their ability to marshal their 
forces behind a particular candidate or issue. 
</P>
<P>
Many Latino leaders believe they will score their most important political 
victories in the courts where they will continue to mount challenges to 
legislative districts that dilute Latino voting strength. 
</P>
<P>
Even the threat of a legal action can be helpful, said Richard Alatorre, a Los 
Angeles city councilman and former state legislator. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to be able to hold something over their heads," Alatorre said. "You 
can't just go to the Assembly and say 'please be good to Mexicans' because they 
don't give a damn." 
</P>
<P>
Asians, like Nghia Tran, a legislative aide in the Assembly, believe that 
deep-seated contempt for politics must be changed before people will 
participate in greater numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"When I told my parents I was going to pursue a career in politics they told me 
that I would be poor for the rest of my life and that no one would marry me," 
Tran said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, attitudes are changing. In Arcadia, where Asians make up about 15% of the 
population, Sheng Chang, a doctor, and his wife decided to take part in civic 
affairs, joining the PTA and other local groups, because of small imbalances 
and injustices that rankled them. 
</P>
<P>
Chang said he would like to see more Asian language books and magazines in the 
local library. But what really got his goat was a bureaucratic decision about 
the height of a wall. 
</P>
<P>
After allowing a non-Asian to ignore the city's height limit for residential 
walls, said Chang, city officials refused to give the same break to an Asian 
homeowner. 
</P>
<P>
A variety of leaders -- Latino, black and Asian -- argue that coalition 
politics offers the best chance for political gain in the '90s and many believe 
that a common concern about economic survival offers the most effective 
rallying point. 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, the success of Hispanics, of Asians, of blacks will be through 
coalitions," said Alatorre. "Sure, there are differences, but we don't have to 
fall in love with each other in order to work together." 
</P>
<P>
But by and large, Asian and Latino political experts do not expect to reap a 
large share of political power in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the numbers, the people, but I don't see a dramatic shift in political 
power before the turn of the century," said Richard Santillan, who directs the 
department of ethnic and women's studies at California Polytechnic University 
at Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Santillan pointed out that with close to one-quarter of the state's population, 
Latinos account for only 6% of state and local elected officials in California. 
</P>
<P>
Two other Southwestern states with substantially smaller Latino populations, 
Texas and New Mexico, have more Latino elected officials than California, 
according to the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project, an 
organization devoted to increasing Latino political influence. 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, at least, blacks have the highest proportional 
representation among the state's nonwhite ethnic groups. Seven percent of the 
state's population is black as are 11% of the elected officials. However, many 
political scientists believe that black representation in government may 
decline as black neighborhoods continue to absorb large numbers of Asian and 
Latino immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
The slow assimilation of ethnic groups into the state's political life is 
unique in American history. Life was very different for the first great wave of 
immigrants in the 19th Century who came ashore on the East Coast. In New York 
and Boston, many European immigrants were courted by political bosses ready to 
hand out jobs, distribute food baskets, find lodging or pay home heating bills 
in return for political support. 
</P>
<P>
Out of necessity, the newcomer quickly became a political animal. The European 
immigrants depended on the big-city machines for survival and vice versa. From 
that mutual dependency grew new constituencies of Irish, Italian, Polish and 
German voters and a degree of ethnic political clout that has not been equaled 
in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Machine politics have never flourished in California, and politicians have 
never relied on the immigrant vote the way they did in the East. Moreover, 
Chinese-Americans were barred from voting until 1943 and Japanese until 1952. 
It was not until 1974 that the first Japanese-American, California Democrat 
Norman Mineta, was elected to Congress from the U.S. mainland. 
</P>
<P>
Today, many experts say that immigrant groups continue to be ignored by 
political parties. 
</P>
<P>
But with few jobs to pass out or favors to dispense, the parties lack the 
leverage they enjoyed with 19th-Century immigrants. It is harder to answer the 
newcomer's time-honored question: "What's in if for me if I vote for you?" 
Party strategists have found that while they can persuade many people to 
register, they are much less successful in getting them to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Studies over the decade have shown that Asians and Latinos vote at a 
significantly lower rate than other citizens. A study by political scientists 
at Caltech found that 11% fewer Asians and 20% fewer Latinos voted in the 1984 
presidential election, compared to blacks and whites who voted at virtually the 
same rate. 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to figures like those, the parties, and especially the Republicans, 
are focusing their efforts on people most likely to vote -- those who already 
have a stake in the economic system. For Republicans, it can mean targeting 
middle-class Latino voters in the San Gabriel Valley who have generally 
conservative views on family values and law and order. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mexican-American we get is the upwardly mobile, someone who appreciates 
what we have to offer," said Spencer. "We look at the kind of precinct in the 
San Fernando Valley or the San Gabriel Valley where you find them living 
alongside Anglos. You knock on the door and a blonde answers, but she is 
married to someone named Lopez." 
</P>
<P>
Aimed at a limited number of Latinos, the strategy that Spencer describes means 
a lot of immigrants don't get courted the way they used to. But party 
strategists, like Spencer, admit they don't need everybody to win. 
</P>
<P>
"The way the demographics work we don't need 55% of the Mexican-Americans to 
win because we have other coalitions to put together with, say, 40% of the 
Mexican-Americans," Spencer said. 
</P>
<P>
There is good news for Republicans in the voting habits of Latinos and Asians. 
It appears that the state's trend toward conservatism is reflected in the 
political preferences of many newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
Although Republican registration remains below 10% among Latinos, the tendency 
to vote for Republican candidates often is much higher. Nearly 50% of Latino 
voters in California favored Republican George Bush in the 1988 presidential 
election, said Hernandez of the Southwest Voter Registration Project. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, 54% voted against then-California Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird, 
who was tagged a liberal opponent of the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
"Latinos tend to have a higher incidence of voting for and identifying with 
Republicans in California than elsewhere in the Southwest," said Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
With Asians, the tendency to register Democrat and vote Republican can be even 
more pronounced. According to the Caltech study, 42% of Asian-Americans were 
registered Democratic, but 67% of them voted for Republican Ronald Reagan in 
the 1984 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
Eschewing party loyalty, registering one way and voting another are signs of 
alienation from traditional American politics. A large number of Asian voters, 
in fact, refuse to identify with either party. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts warn that the skepticism some voters feel toward both major 
parties could hurt them. It could leave them without strong advocates in 
Sacramento during next year's legislative redistricting -- a process that will 
largely determine how much political clout ethnic groups will have during the 
next decade. 
</P>
<P>
Asians could be especially vulnerable in the process since there is not now a 
single Asian member of the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
There are other reasons why redistricting looms like a storm cloud on the 
political horizon. 
</P>
<P>
Many politicians are worried that the 1990 census, which is off to a rocky 
start, won't yield accurate data on ethnic groups in California. If the people 
doing the redistricting don't know how large a group is or where its members 
live, it will be hard to draw districts that maximize ethnic voting strength. 
</P>
<P>
But the greatest threat posed by redistricting is that it will spark 
hostilities among ethnic groups that need each other. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, where Latinos are moving into inner-city neighborhoods long 
represented by blacks, could be the site of the state's most bitter 
redistricting battle. Several black seats in Congress, in the state Legislature 
and in the Los Angeles City Council could be subject to change as new Latino 
residents seek to carve out districts for themselves. Moreover, as strategies 
are hatched and compromises conceived, neighboring seats, long the domain of 
the city's white liberal congressional delegation, could be vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an obvious potential for clashes," said Alatorre. "It's going to take 
a delicate balancing act. People could easily get lost fighting over crumbs." 
</P>
<P>
If the quest for more equitable political representation has been a slow one, 
there has been progress. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty years ago, there were only two blacks and one Latino and no Asians among 
the state's top 300 elected officials. Today, there are 30 blacks, 17 Latinos 
and six Asians, according to a study by Fernando Guerra, who heads the Chicano 
studies department at Loyola Marymount University. 
</P>
<P>
The gains, while modest, helped assure that issues such as bilingual education 
and reparations for Japanese internment victims were part of the political 
dialogue. The rise of ethnic politicians has also brought new government 
contracts and business opportunities to their constituents. As a young Latino 
population reaches adulthood, as hundreds of thousands of immigrants become 
citizens through the federal amnesty program, as more and more newcomers learn 
the connection between politics and economic advancement, the state's emerging 
nonwhite majority will assert itself. 
</P>
<P>
"Demography is destiny," said Erie at UC San Diego. "At some point, 20 or 30 
years from now, the day of ethnic political reckoning is coming." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ETHNIC MINORITIES IN STATE OFFICES 
</P>
<P>
A study by Fernando Guerra, assistant professor of political science and 
director of the Chicano Studies Department at Loyola Marymount University, 
found that blacks have made the largest gains in holding statewide political 
offices. Although Latinos now make up nearly one-quarter of California's 
population, they hold less than 6% of top state offices. And while Asians 
constitute nearly 10% of the population, their share of state officeholders has 
actually declined slightly in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
The study surveyed 288 elected offices, including the top seven constitutional 
offices in the state; the four members of the State Board of Equalization; the 
47 members of Congress and the U.S. Senate from California; the 120 members of 
the state Legislature; the 35 members of the boards of supervisors of the 
state's seven most populous counties, and the 75 mayors and city councils of 
the seven most populous cities.

SANTA BARBARA RESIDENTS TAKE UNUSUAL STEPS TO KEEP GRASS GREEN IN THE 
DROUGHT-STRICKEN CITY

SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dawn Clark's cat gingerly walked across the newly painted lawn, stopped 
suddenly and looked bewildered. The cat sniffed tentatively, then bolted off 
the grass and spent the next few minutes trying to lick flecks of paint off its 
paws. 
</P>
<P>
The lawn was recently mowed and as green as a billiard table. But while it 
looked like a typical lawn, it didn't feel like one. 
</P>
<P>
"Scratchy," Clark said, after taking off her shoes and walking across the 
grass. "It doesn't feel quite right." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara residents have devised a number of innovative ways to keep their 
yards green since the city, faced with a nearly 50% water shortage for the 
year, declared a "drought emergency" in late February and became the first city 
in Southern California to ban lawn watering. 
</P>
<P>
Clark's cat had just experienced one: Several landscape companies now offer 
lawn painting services and local nurseries are stocking their shelves with 
green paint and pump sprayers. 
</P>
<P>
"At least once a day someone comes in and buys green paint," said Martin Senn, 
a manager at La Sumida Nursery. "After working hard all day, some people don't 
want to come home to a brown lawn." 
</P>
<P>
Other residents are spreading a variety of green substances over their brown 
lawns, using shower water for irrigation or paying one of the numerous water 
companies now in business in Santa Barbara to pull up to their houses in tanker 
trucks and spray their yards with fire hoses. 
</P>
<P>
These companies buy water from private wells, and don't use city water, so the 
three "drought officers" from the Public Works Department can't stop them from 
watering lawns. More than a dozen water companies have sprung up in Santa 
Barbara since the lawn-watering ban began. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the high price for the service -- up to $100 or more for each 
watering -- the drought has created a class structure and divided the community 
between those who can afford to buy water or dig wells on their estates, and 
those whose lawns will die. 
</P>
<P>
Companies that sell building material also have been doing a booming business. 
It appears that many Santa Barbarans would rather cover their yards with a 
variety of inorganic substances -- including green concrete -- than have a 
blemished lawn. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents have removed their lawns, and others have just covered them with 
green gravel, stone or bark in the hopes that when the drought is over they can 
revive the lawns, said Bob McNall, owner of McNall Building Material. 
</P>
<P>
During the last few months a number of new businesses have opened that install 
gray water systems -- water piped from sinks, showers and washing machines -- 
to landscaping. And as water bills rise dramatically, plumbers say, those who 
once found used water offensive, suddenly have overcome their aversion. 
</P>
<P>
In affluent communities such as Hope Ranch and Montecito -- also hit hard by 
the drought -- an increasing number of residents are digging wells in their 
back yards so they will be assured a constant source of water for landscaping. 
Santa Barbara prohibits residents from drilling wells, but because it is legal 
in many nearby cities drilling companies from throughout the county have been 
flooded with calls. 
</P>
<P>
"People are getting pretty paranoid . . . they're afraid that one of these days 
they won't be able to get any water at all," said Jim Beane, manager of 
Southern Deep Well Drilling. "At least with a well, you don't have to rely on 
outside sources." 
</P>
<P>
But some residents with wells have flaunted their abundance of water and 
angered neighbors, who have been watching their lawns die. In Hope Ranch, Saudi 
Arabian financier Essam Khashoggi created a stir by building on his large 
estate a 1 1/4-acre pond -- with a dock for rowboats -- that he intends to fill 
with well water. But the pond was built last year without all the required 
permits, and county zoning officials will decide later in the month whether he 
can fill it with water. 
</P>
<P>
In Montecito, almost 100 people have received county permits to drill wells in 
the last few months, including billionaire corporate raider Harold Simmons, who 
ignored the worsening water shortage last year and drowned his 23-acre estate 
in a continuous cascade of water. He was fined $25,000 in 1989 by the Montecito 
Water District, which estimated he used enough water to supply an average 
family of four for 28 years. And Simmons is based in Dallas and only spends 
about 10 days a month at his Montecito estate. 
</P>
<P>
The water district last year finally was forced to sharply restrict the flow of 
water to his home. But since Simmons recently drilled a well on his property 
and started receiving regular shipments of water from a tanker company, he has 
been able to keep his estate lush and green -- legally. 
</P>
<P>
Dawn Clark decided to hire a landscaper to paint her front lawn after she saw 
the grass slowly deteriorate from green, to yellow, to a pale sienna. Her 
husband, Duke, she said, is very meticulous and "likes a lawn to look like a 
lawn." 
</P>
<P>
Walter Barrows, a landscaper who painted the lawn, said he has received more 
than 30 calls a week since he began advertising his grass-painting service. He 
charges $45 to paint the average-size lawn with an "environmentally safe" 
vegetable dye, which will stay green, he said, for about six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of thing is done all over the country with football fields, lawn 
tennis courts and golf greens," Barrows said. "But this is only a very 
temporary solution . . . we've got to have water within the next year or all 
the landscaping and rare trees in this city are going to be in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
While all of Southern California is suffering from a water shortage, the 
drought in the Santa Barbara area may be the most severe. Unlike Los Angeles 
and other areas in the state that have access to water from Northern California 
and the Colorado River, Santa Barbara relies almost entirely on ground-water 
supplies and rainwater. And Santa Barbara is entering its seventh year without 
adequate rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are considering a number of unusual proposals for emergency 
supplies, including bringing in water by rail car from Colorado, importing 
Canadian water by barge, building a large seawater desalination plant and using 
an oil pipeline to transport water from Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
The city hopes to have several alternative sources of water by the fall of 
1991, said Pete Ramsdell, drought awareness manager for Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
And since the city increased water rates, banned lawn watering and prohibited 
residents from using hoses on trees and shrubs -- only drip irrigation systems 
and watering by hand-held buckets are allowed -- water use has decreased by 
about 40%, Ramsdell said. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents have chosen simply to pay premium prices for water rather than 
conserve. Companies obtain their water supplies from private wells on ranches 
throughout the county and then charge homeowners between $100 and $200 -- 
depending on the size of the house -- for a good soaking. Some residents and 
local motels pay for the service every other week. 
</P>
<P>
"For our business, it's worth the money to keep our lawns green and our 
landscaping looking good," said Debbie Neer, manager of the Franciscan Inn. 
"People come to Santa Barbara because it's so beautiful. . . . We can't afford 
to lose that reputation." 
</P>
<P>
John Price had a water truck that supplied the carwashes he owns, but people 
who wanted their lawns irrigated stopped him so many times during the last two 
months that he decided to go into the water business. He opened a company 
called Channel Water Service and now has five trucks and 350 regular customers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his tanker trucks, Price has 10 water trailers that he 
temporarily connects directly to customers' sprinkler systems. He also paints 
lawns, fills swimming pools and rents water storage tanks -- with pumps and 
hoses -- that he refills regularly so customers can do the watering themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"This wasn't something I planned to get into," said Price, as he watched one of 
his employees hose down a front lawn. "But I figured if people wanted my water 
so bad that they'd stop me on the street, it had to be a decent business."

Archbishop Marcos G. McGrath of Panama attended a burial service Sunday for 123 
people killed during the U.S. invasion whose bodies were exhumed from a mass 
grave and identified by relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the bodies, which included several children, had been buried in 
green plastic and canvas bags used by the U.S. armed forces. They were killed 
in the Dec. 20 invasion that ousted strongman Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, the 
officials added.

PHILIPPINES: U.S. OFFICIALS WORRY THAT LEFTISTS WILL KEEP ATTACKING AMERICANS 
TO PROTEST FOREIGN BASES ON THEIR SOIL.

U.S. officials said Sunday that they fear additional attacks on American 
diplomats or military personnel in the Philippines following the shooting death 
of a U.S. Marine sergeant by suspected Communist assassins outside Subic Bay 
Naval Base. 
</P>
<P>
With sensitive talks due to begin May 14 on the future of the six U.S. military 
facilities in the Philippines, the officials fear the Friday night shooting may 
signal a new campaign of leftist violence to force the bases out. 
</P>
<P>
"The expectation is this attack will be followed by others in the next several 
weeks," one analyst said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Said a second official: "Everybody is very nervous." 
</P>
<P>
About 40,000 U.S. military personnel, civilian base workers and their families 
remained confined to their bases Sunday, and Subic Bay spokesman Lt. Cmdr. 
Kevin Mukri said that Americans connected to the Defense Department who live 
off the bases were ordered not to stop while driving to and from work. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy warned American tourists and business travelers to stay away 
from U.S. installations and from more than a dozen rural provinces. Officials 
also restricted travel for about 300 Peace Corps workers in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to alert American citizens of the increased risk," Victoria 
Middleton, an embassy spokeswoman, said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials here said the State Department is considering adding the Philippines 
to its list of "most dangerous" countries for U.S. diplomats. The list now 
includes Lebanon, Afghanistan, El Salvador, Colombia and Peru. 
</P>
<P>
The designation, which would add 20% hazardous-duty pay for about 400 
diplomats, could have political ramifications since the Bush Administration 
remains committed to President Corazon Aquino's struggling four-year-old 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Several U.S. diplomats have been transferred or have sent their families home 
in recent months because of the increased threats. For security, embassy 
officials now are urged to vary their routes when they go to work, to change 
license plates, use different cars or ride in armored embassy vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
By early today, no group had claimed responsibility for the killing of Gunnery 
Sgt. John S. Fredette, 34, of Buena Park, Calif., who was shot once in the back 
of the neck. But police and U.S. Embassy officials said they strongly suspect 
the New People's Army. The Communist group had repeatedly threatened to attack 
American officials before the talks and had named Subic Bay as a target. 
</P>
<P>
Tensions were heightened last week after tens of thousands of people marched 
against the U.S. bases in annual May Day demonstrations. The protests drew 
widespread publicity after Philippine military police severely beat several 
protesters and local reporters at the gates of Clark Air Base. 
</P>
<P>
Clark and Subic Bay are among America's largest overseas bases. 
</P>
<P>
Fredette was killed as he walked down a dimly lit residential street near the 
raucous nightclub district in Olongapo, about 50 miles northwest of Manila. He 
had arrived at Subic Bay one week earlier on a training mission with Marine 
Fighter/Attack Squadron 323 based in El Toro, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
"He was not robbed, so that makes it more likely it was a political murder," 
one analyst said. "It looks like the poor guy was in the wrong country at the 
wrong time." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the Communist rebels had said they would target only those 
Americans involved with counterinsurgency or intelligence operations. Analysts 
said the latest shooting suggests that enlisted men and women may be targets 
now as well. 
</P>
<P>
If the rebels were responsible, Fredette would be the sixth American killed by 
guerrillas since Army Col. James (Nick) Rowe, a counterinsurgency expert, was 
assassinated in suburban Quezon City in April, 1989.

AMERICAN ALBUM: CRACKERS, FISH EGGS -- ALL PART OF NEW KEY WEST; 
</P>
<P>
ISLAND'S BECOMING A CHIC AND PRICEY RESORT. BUT MANY WONDER WHETHER IT'S LOSING 
ITS FUNKY SOUL.

KEY WEST, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the city at the end of the road, the southernmost spot in the 
continental United States, the last island in an archipelago that dangles off 
the Florida mainland like beads on an aquamarine strand. 
</P>
<P>
The remoteness has suited it well, for Key West has always been something of a 
rogue's paradise, even through a sequence of identity changes: fishing village, 
artists' colony, naval base, marijuana port, raucous tourist town. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the city is busy changing identities again, this time toward a chic 
and pricey resort, and many here worry that their free-spirited island is 
finding its fortune only to lose its funky soul. 
</P>
<P>
Condos and hotels are rising up to take the best view of the waterfront, and 
Duval Street, the heart of the city, is increasingly the home of trendy 
boutiques and restaurants. Homes routinely sell for $500,000 and up. 
</P>
<P>
"The island's full of high caliber, hoi polloi types -- you know, eating 
crackers with fish eggs on them and all that crap," says Tony Tarracino, once 
the city's best-known saloon keeper and now its newly elected mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"Big Money," Tarracino says, threatens to turn the island into the one thing it 
has never been before: dull. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, when Key West first began courting tourists seriously, it offered 
a freewheeling, anything-goes vitality that welcomed the outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
This was the Margaritaville of the Jimmy Buffett song, where people walked in 
flip-flops, "wasting away again." A reckless attitude wafted in the breeze: 
bawdy, laid back, independent, a little soused. 
</P>
<P>
But with that attitude also came scruffiness -- noise and litter and street 
hustling. This was not entirely compatible with $200 a night hotel rooms, and, 
inevitably, city big shots wanted to strap on some restraints. 
</P>
<P>
In the present climb toward upscale, Key West regulates street vendors and 
street performers. In the last few weeks, it has also put a muzzle on the 
late-night rock 'n' roll that customarily blares from popular open-air bars. 
</P>
<P>
The new noise ordinance bans any sound after 10 p.m. that can be heard 150 feet 
from its source, a move that has silenced many of the city's live bands. 
"They're rolling up the carpet at 10 p.m. to make the streets safe for their 
Mercedeses and Rolls Royces," complains Mark Rossi, who owns Rick's Bar. 
</P>
<P>
Like many others, Rossi blames the quieting of Key West on the one man who has 
come to symbolize Big Money here, the 37-year-old, turban-wearing developer 
Pritam Singh. 
</P>
<P>
Back in 1971, when Singh was a hippie named Paul LaBombard Jr., he wandered 
here and stayed for four adventuresome months. He says he dove for conch shells 
that he then sold to tourists. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, his vagabond life led him to a Sikh ashram in Massachusetts, where 
he adopted a new set of religious beliefs and a new name to go with them. 
</P>
<P>
Now he has returned to Key West as a multimillionaire businessman. In 1986, he 
paid $17.2 million for 103 acres of prime land, the former U.S. naval base that 
sits not far from the busiest part of Duval Street. He plans to build homes, 
condos, shops, a marina and a Ritz-Carlton Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
To a bar owner like Rossi, this new development is frighteningly tasteful and 
refined -- and the anti-noise Singh is "a rich jerk who's trying to sell 
$500,000 houses 2 blocks from an open-air bar district. I mean, c'mon, that's 
like building them next to an airport." 
</P>
<P>
But to the developer, as well as many others who own some of the city's 
charming and ornate wooden homes, the time has simply come for "certain people 
to stop being rude while others are trying to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
After all, Singh argues, the most authentic Key West is not necessarily the 
recent and boisterous one; rather, it is the island of the late 19th Century, 
when the city was actually the wealthiest in early Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"This is traditionally a place of money . . . " says the high-toned Singh, who 
can make a real estate deal sound like a humanist crusade. "Tourism is sharing 
a nice place with others, and that's an enlightening thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
There is already plenty of sharing going on. Each day, 50 commercial flights 
set down on this slender finger of land, 2 miles by 4. Some 1.5 million 
tourists visited last year alone. 
</P>
<P>
They may not discover the gritty island they expected, where fishermen came off 
the trawlers at sundown. But there are plenty of galleries with expensive 
maritime paintings and lithographs that look real enough. 
</P>
<P>
And they may not find zany Margaritaville, but they can buy a comfortable 
T-shirt at the Jimmy Buffett Margaritaville store and "waste away again" at the 
adjoining Margaritaville restaurant.

Thirty-three inmates died and 12 others were injured, two of them seriously, 
when a fire swept through part of an Argentine prison, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze broke out Saturday night in a special cell block on the fifth floor 
of the Olmos Penitentiary that housed prisoners who had been recognized for 
their good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Prison officials said the trouble began after inmates set fire to mattresses to 
block guards from entering a cell to break up a prisoner dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"The fire was started intentionally. They burnt mattresses and it got out of 
control and spread throughout the block," prison director Julio Barraza said. 
</P>
<P>
The flames spread rapidly, trapping the victims, he added. Many of the 259 
prisoners in the block were due to be released within the next 12 months for 
good conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the 3,000 prison inmates worked alongside firefighters to help quell 
the blaze, which completely burned the block, prison officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Buenos Aires provincial Gov. Antonio Cafiero said after visiting the prison 
Sunday morning that he would propose a reduction in the sentences of the 
survivors. 
</P>
<P>
The privately owned news agency Noticias Argentinas quoted residents living 
near the prison as saying they did not hear shouts and noises that are usually 
associated with prison riots. 
</P>
<P>
At dawn, names of the dead were announced over loudspeakers to sobbing 
relatives and friends gathered outside the prison.

SOVIETS WOULD BEND ON NATO FOR UNITY'S SAKE

Soviet resistance to a united Germany's membership in the Western Alliance 
appears to have eased perceptibly, but major differences remain between Moscow 
and the Western allies on the issue, political analysts said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the West German news agency DPA, Bonn Foreign Minister 
Hans-Dietrich Genscher said the Soviets had suggested decoupling the thorny 
question of alliance membership from the overall process of unification, so 
that the two Germanys could complete the internal aspects of unity. 
</P>
<P>
A West German Foreign Ministry official in Bonn said Moscow was apparently 
willing to put off any final resolution of the issue for a considerable period 
if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The suggestion was made by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze at a 
meeting Saturday in Bonn of the two Germanys and the four World War II victors 
-- Britain, France, the United States and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
All five of the other participants in the meeting advocate membership in the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization for a united Germany, a move Moscow contends 
would create an imbalance of power in Europe and endanger Soviet security. 
</P>
<P>
The development came at the first session of the so-called two-plus-four talks, 
which deal with dissolving the residual Allied rights in the country they 
conquered 45 years ago Tuesday and ensuring that security interests of 
neighboring European states are not diminished by reunification. 
</P>
<P>
In the talks, Shevardnadze also indicated a greater degree of Soviet 
flexibility on the alliance issue, dropping the words oppose and reject in 
connection with a united Germany in NATO, declaring instead only that Moscow 
would react negatively to such a proposal. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Soviet news agency Tass said that Shevardnadze told the foreign 
ministers that while the timing of internal and external questions on unity 
could be separated, all unity-related issues -- including the alliance question 
-- have to be resolved before Moscow would sign a final settlement formally 
relinquishing Allied rights in Germany.

Associates of Colombian drug baron Pablo Escobar have been trying to buy 
Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and machine guns in a plot to assassinate 
President Virgilio Barco Vargas, ABC News reported. One man has been arrested 
in Miami and charged with plotting to buy weapons illegally, according to 
unidentified sources quoted by the television network. An FBI spokesman in 
Miami said officials would hold a news conference on the subject today but he

ARKANSAS RESIDENTS BRACE FOR 'WORST' FLOOD IN 17 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Arkansas residents built sandbag dikes and low areas along the Arkansas River 
were evacuated Sunday, as floodwaters from two weeks of heavy rain in Oklahoma 
approached Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
While the state braced for new flooding along the Arkansas and at least five 
other rivers, it declared disaster areas 27 counties hit by flash floods last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
A federal survey of the damage was to begin today. 
</P>
<P>
Flooding continued along the Red River, the Oklahoma-Texas border. Areas near 
the Deep Fork River in eastern Oklahoma were under 10 feet of water, the 
National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
The worst of the Arkansas River flooding was expected around Little Rock today 
and Tuesday, and at Pine Bluff, 35 miles south, by Wednesday, said Gary Talley 
of Arkansas Emergency Services. "We are preparing for the worst flooding in 
more than 17 years -- since 1973," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Arkansas crested upriver Saturday and inundated 52 houses in the Ft. Smith 
area, which has suffered damage estimated at $16 million in recent floods. 
Flooding was also reported along the White, Black, Cache, St. Francis and 
Quachita rivers. The Red River was expected to crest today as a record 144,000 
cubic feet of water per second was released from storm-swollen Lake Texoma. 
</P>
<P>
The Oklahoma Highway Patrol said it might take three weeks to reopen U.S. 70 at 
the northern arm of the reservoir, where 3 feet of water and debris blocked the 
roadway.

JORDANIANS ABROAD MAY PAY $10,000 FOR MILITARY EXEMPTION

The Jordanian government has decided to sell exemption from military service to 
citizens working abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of exemption is likely to be about $10,000 payable in foreign 
currency, a Cabinet minister who declined to be named said Sunday. The 
decision, made at a Cabinet meeting Saturday, will also allow overseas workers 
to buy exemptions for their sons. 
</P>
<P>
The buyout has often been requested by spokesmen for 375,000 Jordanians 
employed abroad, most of whom live in Persian Gulf oil states. The government, 
burdened with foreign debt, needs the cash. 
</P>
<P>
Compulsory military service lasts two years. 
</P>
<P>
An amendment to the conscription law to be presented to Parliament will allow 
the Cabinet to fix the price, the minister said.

DEMOCRATS SUED OVER PARTY FORUM

A relatively unknown candidate for the Democratic nomination for state 
insurance commissioner, Larry Murphy of Temecula, sued state party Chairman 
Edmund G. Brown Jr. and other party officials for $10 million for denying him a 
place on the rostrum when the party held a debate among insurance commissioner 
candidates April 7, before voting to give television commentator Bill Press its 
endorsement. Murphy said he paid a $100 filing fee but was the only candidate 
denied a chance to debate. The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana, 
said this was both a breach of contract and a violation of Murphy's civil 
rights.

HOW MINORITY POLITICIANS WIN VOTES OF A MAJORITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Increasingly, the most successful ethnic minority politicians are learning how 
to win by appealing to voters of all races. Here are two who have succeeded and 
one who hopes to win in November: 
</P>
<P>
Mary King 
</P>
<P>
Mary King had been a drama student, a 20-year-old single mother, a secretary 
and a telephone operator before she entered the world of politics. A black 
woman, she upset a white man in a 1988 Alameda County supervisors race from a 
district with a 10% black population. 
</P>
<P>
Her strategy? "I was Oprah, the kind of warm, competent person you'd want to 
have a cup of coffee with," said King. "I ran as an ordinary person, not 
wealthy, not poor, but comfortable. I didn't run from the race issue. We put my 
picture on the campaign brochure. I was this competent black woman who was 
approachable and warm." 
</P>
<P>
King also brought with her more than 10 years of experience in Oakland 
politics, as an aide to a former supervisor, a chief of staff to a former mayor 
of Oakland and chairwoman of the county's Democratic Party. She said she 
brought to the race established relationships with the bureaucracy from Oakland 
to Sacramento. "I think people felt I was ready for the job." 
</P>
<P>
But King credits a large part of her electoral success to feeling at ease 
around people of other races. "It was not uncomfortable for me to be who I am 
with audiences that look different than I do." 
</P>
<P>
In a close race, said King, she was the target of both "racist and sexist" 
attacks, but she said the issue of class worked for her. King attributed her 6% 
victory margin over Don McGue, a San Leandro city councilman, in part to 
upper-middle-class white voters who valued her as "an urbane black woman 
running against a polyester white man." 
</P>
<P>
King, 43, said she does not rule out running for another office one day. "If I 
stay in politics, the only other offices I would be interested in would be 
mayor of Oakland or the U.S. Senate." 
</P>
<P>
Juan Arambula 
</P>
<P>
The son of farm workers who casually refers to himself as a "former fruit 
tramp," Juan Arambula is widely regarded as a rising political star in the 
Central Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Recruited by Harvard University from Delano High School, Arambula, 38, 
graduated with honors in 1975, received a law degree from UC Berkeley and two 
years ago became only the second Latino ever elected to the Fresno Unified 
School District Board of Trustees. Arambula finished first in a field of seven 
candidates that included two incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
Arambula ran in a district where less than 20% of the voters are Latino. He 
gained the support of the local chamber of commerce, the town's daily newspaper 
and raised more money, about $50,000, than anyone ever had in a school board 
race. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of focusing his campaign on Latino voters, Arambula said he 
concentrated on precincts where voter turnout traditionally was high, even 
though such neighborhoods tended to be white, well-off and frequently 
Republican. Arambula, like most Latino voters in California, is a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt the best way to get Hispanic voters excited about me was to demonstrate 
that I was a potential winner, that I could appeal to voters across the board," 
Arambula said, adding that he thought it was the best way for other Latino 
candidates to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"In my case, education helped and so did the fact that I'm light-skinned," 
Arambula said. His advantages aside, however, he said he sees a new generation 
of Latino candidates who will be able to campaign successfully in neighborhoods 
and districts that are not dominated by Latino voters. 
</P>
<P>
Lon Hatamiya 
</P>
<P>
Lon Hatamiya, whose Japanese-American grandfather acquired the family's farm in 
Butte County nearly a century ago, is making a serious bid to become the first 
Asian member of the California Legislature in 10 years. At 31, Hatamiya is 
seeking his first elective office. 
</P>
<P>
Running for Northern California's 3rd Assembly District seat held by Chris 
Chandler, a Republican, Hatamiya is well known by local people because of his 
family's roots in the region. Although the Asian population of the district is 
about 2%, Hatamiya can count on statewide financial support by Asian-Americans 
eager for a voice in the Legislature. So far, Hatamiya says, he has raised 
about $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
But he will need every advantage he can get to win in November. He is a 
Democrat in a district where nearly 60% of the voters supported George Bush in 
the 1988 presidential election. Hatamiya's opponent, a two-term incumbent, has 
not made a big splash in Sacramento, but he can expect generous support from 
the state Republican Party. Dollar for dollar, "it will be very hard to match 
him," said Gale Kaufman, Hatamiya's campaign consultant, on the subject of 
Chandler's fund-raising potential. 
</P>
<P>
Hatamiya says he does not believe race will be a factor in the campaign. 
Because of his family's ties to the region, Hatamiya believes he can make the 
case that he is closer to the people of the district than is his opponent. With 
degrees in business and law, Hatamiya says he devotes his non-campaigning time 
to managing the family's 1,200-acre farm.

JOFFREY DROPS FORMER DIRECTOR'S BALLET WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a surprise announcement Sunday afternoon, the Joffrey Ballet Company pulled 
three Gerald Arpino works and instead performed the Los Angeles premiere of a 
work by a Joffrey dancer and two other non-Arpino ballets. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, it was announced that Arpino works scheduled for Tuesday and 
Wednesday evening programs at the Music Center also will be substituted. 
</P>
<P>
The change in programming came in the wake of Arpino's resignation last week as 
the company's artistic director. The action was triggered by a letter from 
Arpino's attorney, Harold Messing, prohibiting the Joffrey from performing 
Arpino's copyrighted ballets after last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Joffrey Executive Director Penelope Curry said the Joffrey Ballet Foundation 
did not want to do anything to suggest that "we were not trying to continue to 
negotiate." She said the foundation "was not able to clear" with Arpino's 
attorney whether the company could perform the three Arpino works scheduled for 
Sunday's matinee at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's in the hands of attorneys and other people," Curry said. "We're trying to 
make sure the performances go on. (I don't think) there's anything else we can 
say or do till Wednesday." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the deadline set by Messing, the Joffrey performed three Arpino works 
Saturday night. Curry said the dances were performed "with his (Arpino's) 
permission." 
</P>
<P>
The legal battle centers on ownership of ballets created by Arpino while 
employed by the company. Messing claims that Arpino owns the works because the 
choreographer copyrighted them and had no contract with the company pertaining 
to his employment or works created for the company. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Messing had said that if the company ignored his directive, legal 
options included taking "injunctive relief and suing for money damages on the 
basis of copyright infringement." 
</P>
<P>
Arpino has declined interviews and Messing could not be reached Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Bruguiere, manager of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, said Sunday's 
substitution was announced with program inserts. 
</P>
<P>
The Joffrey was supposed to perform the Arpino works "Round of Angels," "L'Air 
d'Esprit" and "Trinity." Instead, the program became Eugene Loring's "Billy the 
Kid," the premiere of "Lacrymosa" by Joffrey dancer Edward Stierle, and "Arden 
Court" by Paul Taylor."

LATINO ASPIRATIONS ON RISE IN COMPTON; 
</P>
<P>
DEMOGRAPHICS: LATINOS STREAM INTO THE AREA. SOME SAY THE BLACK-RUN CITY IS 
HOSTILE TO THEIR NEEDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Compton, which likes to call itself the largest "black-run" city west of the 
Mississippi, is as synonymous locally with black people as rap music and soul 
food. 
</P>
<P>
Black History Month -- February -- is a community-wide celebration. Children go 
to schools named after black heroes -- the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., George 
Washington Carver, Marian Anderson and Ronald E. McNair, the astronaut who died 
in the Challenger disaster. 
</P>
<P>
It might not be long, however, before somebody suggests naming a school after 
Benito Juarez or Cesar Chavez because black Compton is changing colors. 
</P>
<P>
For a decade, Latinos have been quietly streaming into every neighborhood in 
the city, replacing middle-class blacks who gave up on Compton -- its violent 
crime, its drug trafficking, its economic failures -- and moved on in search of 
safer streets and better schools. 
</P>
<P>
Latino children are now the majority in the Compton Unified School District -- 
50.93% compared to 33% just five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
City-wide, the percentage of the population that is black is dropping -- from 
an all-time high of 73% in the 1980 census to an estimated 66% this year. 
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the Latino population has jumped from 21% to at least 
30%, making this community of about 100,000 in southeast Los Angeles County 
probably the most nonwhite city in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
It is, nonetheless, a community with racial conflicts, a troubling example of 
how Latino aspirations and black resentment can collide. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks control every public and quasi-public institution in Compton -- the 
schools, City Hall, the Compton Chamber of Commerce, the Democratic Party 
machine -- and show no sign they intend to share their power. 
</P>
<P>
City and school officials have refused to come up with affirmative action plans 
for Latino hiring, a continuing source of tension between the two groups. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we are, a truly minority community," said bakery owner Pedro Pallan, "and 
the blacks are not giving us an affirmative action committee in either the city 
(government) or the school district. There cannot be equal employment 
opportunity without an affirmative action committee." 
</P>
<P>
In the Compton Unified School District, for example, more than 73% of the 
teachers are black; less than 4% are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
A council-ordered study last year found that only 9.7% of city jobs were held 
by Latinos, compared to 78% held by blacks. Latinos have been pressing for more 
Spanish-speaking employees in both places. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing was that here we have a bona fide occupational qualification," said 
Martin D. Chavez, a lifelong Compton resident who served on the city's Latino 
advisory committee. "We have a city where 30% to 40% during this census may 
turn out to be Hispanic." 
</P>
<P>
Latinos believe that affirmative action policies should benefit them as well as 
anyone else. Some blacks disagree. Affirmative action, says school trustee John 
Steward, is reparation to black Americans for slavery and for being torn from 
their African homeland. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not based on going back and forth across the border 10 or 15 times a 
year," he said, aiming a barb at the city's mushrooming immigrant population. 
</P>
<P>
Latino parents complain that black teachers are culturally insensitive to 
Latino children. 
</P>
<P>
"They see all Latinos as dropouts and gang bangers," said Margarita Cornejo, 
who has five children in the Compton schools. "It's the way they project us," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks, meanwhile, complain about having to spend an increasing share of the 
school budget on bilingual education. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no respect for the language issue. This is America," Steward said. 
"Because a person does not speak English is not a reason to provide exceptional 
resources at public expense." 
</P>
<P>
There are more then 8,000 youngsters in the Compton school system who speak 
little, if any, English and only 46 teachers with bilingual credentials, though 
the situation is not unique to Compton. Bilingual teachers are in short supply 
across the state, educators say. 
</P>
<P>
In Compton, Latino parents complain that their children are often taught by 
Spanish-speaking classroom aides instead of full-fledged teachers. 
</P>
<P>
When blacks and Latinos in Compton are asked to talk about one another and what 
divides them, old memories surface in the conversations like stray leaves in a 
bitter cup of tea. 
</P>
<P>
Maxcy D. Filer, a city councilman and veteran civil rights leader, said he was 
president of the Compton NAACP when blacks could not get jobs with the city's 
major employers. 
</P>
<P>
"I have walked many picket lines in Compton," Filer said. "I have yet to have 
one Latino walk the picket line with me, not one. . . . They crossed it many 
times. . . . They called me some names even the whites didn't call me." 
</P>
<P>
Martin D. Chavez, who attended the city's black-run school system, recalled a 
time when he was chosen to give Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. Chavez said the 
speech was ultimately reassigned to a black student after complaints had come 
from black students and teachers who said a Latino should not give a speech by 
Lincoln because that president is a hero to blacks, not Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a group out there that's black, "(that) has a belief that there's 
blacks and everybody else," said Chavez, an affirmative action analyst for the 
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. ". . . And, regardless of what your 
race is, you're not doing anything for them, so you're an enemy of theirs." 
</P>
<P>
Blacks waged a bitter battle to get a foothold in Compton, where property deeds 
once forbade the sale of homes to anyone "not of the Caucasian race." 
</P>
<P>
They began migrating from South Los Angeles to 127th Street on Compton's 
northern edge in the early 1950s and spent the next 15 years spreading 
southward across the city -- block by block. It was called block busting -- 
having white liberals buy houses from whites for resale to black families. 
</P>
<P>
"We only lived up to Rosecrans (Avenue) at that time," Filer said, explaining 
how the thoroughfare on the north side of the city formed an east-west boundary 
line over which blacks were not supposed to cross to buy homes. The barrier was 
broken, he says, in the late 1950s, when blacks supported by white liberals 
moved a black family named Pickens south of Rosecrans. 
</P>
<P>
"We moved Mr. Pickens (onto) School Street. I think it was the 300 or 400 block 
and they put a water hose in his mailbox, ruined his floors. Then, we had to 
sit and guard it at night while he slept." 
</P>
<P>
If Latinos are not represented in Compton's corridors of power, Filer contends, 
they have themselves to blame. 
</P>
<P>
"When I moved to Compton," he said, falling back on a line he uses often, 
"(Latinos) were running faster than the whites were running." 
</P>
<P>
If Latinos had stayed in the city, he said, they would be sharing power now. 
"But they decided to leave" he said, "and then all at once an influx of them 
came back, and now they're saying, 'give me,' and I think it's something you 
have to work for." 
</P>
<P>
Blacks gained control of the city when the white majority fled the riots that 
erupted a mile away in Watts in 1965. The first few years of black power may 
have been heady ones, but they soured as white America turned away from black 
concerns and hope turned to despair in black neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, according to census data, the annual per capita income in 
Compton was just half that of Los Angeles County. Today, according to census 
estimates, Compton's per capita income -- an estimated $7,800 annually -- is 
still at half. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez says part of the problem between blacks and Latinos is that blacks do 
not recognize that Latinos also have a history of struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"They fail to remember that in Texas and New Mexico there were civil rights 
movements that were predominantly led by Hispanics," Chavez said. And the farm 
worker movement in Northern California, he said, was led by Latinos. "They 
fought for basic working rights (for) unskilled labor and unskilled labor means 
minorities." 
</P>
<P>
In Compton, Chavez said: "We have a chance to really pull ourselves together 
and show how struggling groups can struggle together and not with each other."

CAMPER, 101, HAS A MILLION MILES UNDER HIS BELT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

It was hard to tell whether the people gathered around John Henry Wine were 
more impressed with the fact that he has driven nearly a million miles in a 
recreational vehicle or that he has managed to live 101 years and can still 
climb up a hill. 
</P>
<P>
No matter. The RVers, in matching Lazy Daze Caravan Club jackets, plopped an 
orange Lazy Daze cap on John Henry Wine's head last week and proclaimed him 
several things, including Honorary Senior Wagon Master, RV Enthusiast of the 
Century and the Oldest Active Member of the Good Sam recreational vehicle club. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's taking pictures!" was about all John Henry Wine had to say as he 
sat in the main showroom of the Long Beach Convention Center and ascended into 
recreational immortality. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about happy campers. Hundreds of RV fanatics, lost in a sea of late-model 
Road Rangers and Winnebagos, paid homage to a man who avoided three dates with 
death to become the Dalai Lama of RVers -- even if the state did revoke his 
driver's license at the age of 99. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his 15 minutes of fame and a promise that his picture will be on 
the cover of the June issue of an RV magazine, Wine took home three engraved 
plaques, a check for $200 to repaint his Lazy Daze RV, his new hat, a purple 
Good Sam jacket and a caramel-colored Lazy Daze Caravaners jacket. 
</P>
<P>
He also got a lifetime pass to the Western RV show, but says he is not 
interested in buying any newfangled trailers with microwave ovens and 
forced-air furnaces. 
</P>
<P>
Born Jan. 4, 1889, in a log cabin that his father built in Blountville, Tenn., 
Wine came down with typhoid fever at the age of 16. Everybody thought he was 
dead. They covered him up with a sheet and called the undertaker. 
</P>
<P>
"Then one of my uncles came and said, 'I believe that boy is still alive,' " 
Wine said. "So they called the undertaker and told him not to come, which I was 
glad about." 
</P>
<P>
A couple of years after that he enlisted as a World War I cavalry groomer. A 
horse fell on his foot. He went to the hospital and the rest of his unit went 
overseas, where its members were massacred in the battle of the Argonne Forest. 
</P>
<P>
"Wiped out to a man," said Clark Terrill, Wine's camping friend and a "Golden 
Caravaner" in his own right. "We say he's living on borrowed time. I think he's 
got some cat blood in him." 
</P>
<P>
Wine, known to his friends as Jack, took a job driving a water wagon in 
Tampico, Mexico, in 1923, where he says he ran into Pancho Villa, who was 
hanging Americans in a square. 
</P>
<P>
"There we was, in pretty bad shape," Wine said. 
</P>
<P>
He was rescued by the Army and ultimately settled in 1927 in Nuevo, a little 
town near Riverside, where he painted houses for a living and still resides 
today. 
</P>
<P>
He bought a Shasta 16-foot trailer in 1948 and camped with his first wife until 
she died. In 1968, at the age of 79, he married a widow named Ruth, whom he had 
known and played cards with since 1927. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth brought to the marriage an El Dorado slip-on camper (cab over truck). They 
bought their first Lazy Daze RV in 1970 and their second in 1976, which he 
still has today and drove until he failed the Department of Motor Vehicles' eye 
test two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Now Ruth does all the driving. She's only 84. 
</P>
<P>
All told, he has hit 49 states and gone a million miles. (You can't go to 
Hawaii in an RV so he flew there.) 
</P>
<P>
Today, they stay within 100 miles of home and try not to go to elevations 
higher than 4,000 feet. Otherwise, they camp just the way they always have, 
about twice a month with a white toy poodle that sleeps wherever she wants. 
</P>

People who receive a common local anesthetic may test positive for illegal 
cocaine use up to two days after treatment, doctors at Fairfax Hospital in 
Falls Church, Va., warned last week. They said that applying half a teaspoon of 
tetracaine, Adrenalin and cocaine solution, called TAC, to the skin for local 
anesthesia before stitching up a cut or wound will produce a positive urine 
test for cocaine for up to 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Similar effects can occur when the topical cocaine solution is used before 
surgery on the eye or nose, as well as for certain dental procedures, the 
doctors reported in Annals of Emergency Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
One day after receiving TAC, more than three-quarters of the 18 patients in the 
study "clearly failed" a standard test used to screen people for illegal drug 
use, said Dr. Michael Altieri, who directed the study.

ERROR RATES TALLIED ON PRESCRIPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Efforts to cut U.S. medical costs should leave in place the safety mechanisms 
that catch mistakes doctors make in prescribing drugs, says a researcher who 
documented hundreds of such errors at a New York hospital. The study in last 
week's Journal of the American Medical Assn. found an average of 2 1/2 errors a 
day in written prescriptions at 640-bed Albany Medical Center Hospital in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Albany wrote 289,411 prescriptions in 1987, and errors occurred in 
905 of them, including 182 mistakes that could have caused severe harm or death 
if they had gone undetected, the researchers reported. Mistakes varied from 
ordering too strong a tranquilizer for the size or age of a patient to 
prescribing penicillin or related drug to a patient who is allergic. 
</P>
<P>
But, said Timothy S. Lesar, assistant pharmacy director for clinical services 
and the study's co-author, "all these errors were (detected and) averted. They 
never put a patient at risk." 
</P>
<P>
Researchers found higher error rates in obstetrics-gynecology and 
surgery-anesthesia than in other services. Error rates were higher among 
first-year residents and declined with successive years of training. Mistakes 
were highest during daytime hours, when large numbers of prescriptions were 
being written, and lowest during evening hours, suggesting fatigue is not a 
factor.

SHADES OF OPINION IN THE DEBATE OVER SKIN CANCER; 
</P>
<P>
RESEARCH: A SAN DIEGO EPIDEMIOLOGIST SEES THE NEED FOR RAYS IN PRODUCTION OF 
VITAMIN D. OTHERS SAY MORE STUDY IS NECESSARY TO DETERMINE THE RISKS AND 
BENEFITS OF SUNLIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY, Doheny is a freelance writer in Burbank who writes 
frequently in The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Slowly but steadily, the evils of sunbathing have been etched into American 
consciousness. Stay out of the sun, most everyone has been warned by physicians 
at one time or another, to minimize the risk of skin cancer, not to mention an 
onslaught of wrinkles. If sun worshiping is still a must, so is sunscreen, most 
doctors say. 
</P>
<P>
Now, some researchers are crying "overkill." Getting a little sun, they claim, 
isn't a bad idea. Minimal sun exposure may actually decrease the risks of 
colon, rectal and breast cancers, partly by triggering adequate production of 
Vitamin D, especially in the elderly, suggests Cedric Garland, a San Diego 
epidemiologist and associate professor of community and family medicine at the 
UC San Diego School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
He is not promoting a return to the old bake-at-the-beach mentality. But 10 or 
15 minutes a day of sunlight exposure may actually be healthy for some people, 
contends Garland, who earlier this year presented his research findings in New 
Orleans at the annual meeting of the American Assn. for the Advancement of 
Science. 
</P>
<P>
Dermatology and cancer specialists emphasize that the work of Garland and 
others should be viewed with caution and that further work needs to be done to 
determine the relative risks and benefits of sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
Colon and rectal cancer will kill 61,000 people this year, while breast cancer 
will claim another 44,000 lives, according to American Cancer Society 
estimates. Another 8,800 people will die of skin cancer in 1990, most of them 
from the most deadly form, called melanoma. 
</P>
<P>
Garland began rethinking traditional sun exposure advice about a decade ago, 
when he and his brother, Frank Garland, head of the epidemiology program of the 
U.S. Naval Health Research Center in San Diego, examined a U.S. map showing 
county-by-county death rates from different types of cancers. The brothers 
became intrigued by the low colon cancer rates in the Southwest and the high 
rates in the Northeast, wondering if the amount of sunlight and the Vitamin D 
it helps produce might play a role. 
</P>
<P>
Next, the Garlands, working with other researchers, analyzed the diets of 
nearly 2,000 men and found that the risk of colon cancer was correlated with 
low levels of dietary Vitamin D. In another study, published late last year in 
The Lancet, Garland and his colleagues thawed blood samples collected years 
earlier from colon cancer patients, comparing them to samples drawn from 
healthy subjects. Vitamin D levels were lower in the cancer patients than in 
controls, said Garland, who concludes that maintaining high levels of Vitamin D 
might reduce colon and rectal cancer risk by as much as 80%. 
</P>
<P>
An unpublished study by the Garlands and UC San Diego epidemiologist Edward D. 
Gorham found that breast cancer death rates in the darkest republics of the 
Soviet Union are three times those in republics with more sunshine. He found 
that breast cancer death rates in northern parts of the United States are about 
1.5 times higher than the death rates in the sunnier southern parts of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Any protective effect of Vitamin D probably works in more than one way, Garland 
said. "It may maintain tight junctions between cells in the bowel's lining, for 
instance, thus . . . preventing the evolution of early cancers." 
</P>
<P>
The Garlands are not the only ones doing research in this area. 
</P>
<P>
In a University of Utah study, dietary calcium was termed a "mitigating factor" 
in colon cancer after researcher Martha Slattery followed 231 patients 
eventually diagnosed with colon cancer and 391 patients who remained 
cancer-free. Vitamin D helps regulate the amount of calcium absorbed by the 
body. 
</P>
<P>
She compared the dietary habits of the groups two years before the cancer 
diagnosis and found that dietary calcium decreased the risk of colon cancer in 
low-risk people. It may do so, Slattery speculates, by decreasing the exposure 
of the bowel's lining to irritating fatty acids and bile acids. Her research 
was published in 1988 in the American Journal of Epidemiology. 
</P>
<P>
In another study, researchers found that chronic sunscreen use decreases 
concentrations of circulating Vitamin D. The researchers, whose study was 
published in late 1988 in the Archives of Dermatology, compared 20 long-term 
sunscreen users with 20 control subjects who were about the same age and who 
were accustomed to about the same sunlight exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Based on this body of research, Cedric Garland offers several pieces of advice: 
</P>
<P>
* Spend just a few minutes in the sun every day, especially if you are 65 or 
older. But the advice doesn't hold for very fair-skinned people or those with a 
history of serious skin disorders, Garland added. 
</P>
<P>
* Minimize sun exposure otherwise. Skip sunscreen, Garland advises, although 
other experts strongly disagree with him. 
</P>
<P>
"Sunscreen interferes with the production of Vitamin D in the skin and reduces 
circulating Vitamin D levels by half," said Garland. And he is not convinced 
that sunscreen prevents melanoma. 
</P>
<P>
The sunscreen industry thinks differently. "What we know is sunscreen blocks 
the sun and sunlight contributes to melanoma," said Jerry McEwen, vice 
president of science for the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Assn., a 
Washington-based trade group. 
</P>
<P>
* If you do use sunscreen, be sure to eat sufficient amounts of Vitamin 
D-containing foods, Garland suggested. Milk and fish such as tuna are good 
choices, he added. 
</P>
<P>
How much Vitamin D is enough? About 400 International Units (IUs) a day, 
Garland suggested. That is the current recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for 
children and double the RDA for adults. (A cup of milk, for instance, supplies 
about 100 IUs of Vitamin D.) "And we may have reason to take that up to 1,000 
IUs (based on research in progress)," Garland added. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone agrees with Garland's advice. Dr. Clark Heath, vice president for 
epidemiology and statistics for the American Cancer Society, calls Garland's 
advice and ideas "interesting but unproven," adding that "further research may 
or may not bear them out." What is known, Heath said, is that "excessive 
sunlight is clearly linked with all forms of skin cancer." 
</P>
<P>
In a consensus statement issued in 1988, the American Academy of Dermatology 
called for "further documentation of the impact sunscreen use has on elderly 
patients at risk of Vitamin D deficiency," according to a spokesman for the 
academy. "We stand by our advice to use sunscreen with a sun protection factor 
of 15 or greater," he added. 
</P>
<P>
But some physicians have adopted a middle-of-the-road stance, pending further 
studies. "We don't yet know what role 10 minutes a day plays in (the 
development of) skin cancer, but it would probably be safe," said Dr. Jeff 
Ashley, USC associate clinical professor of medicine and a Burbank 
dermatologist, who cautions his patients never to sunburn. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are taking sun-avoidance advice seriously," Ashley also tells his 
patients, "you need to pay attention to Vitamin D. Drink three or four glasses 
of milk a day, or take a Vitamin D supplement. Take it with calcium. The 
metabolism of the two are so closely linked that those people not getting 
enough Vitamin D may not be getting enough calcium either."

LIGHT, DARK RESET INTERNAL CLOCKS

Carefully timed doses of bright light and total darkness can help night shift 
workers quickly reset their internal clocks so they stay alert on the job and 
sleep soundly during the day, scientists reported last week in the New England 
Journal of Medicine. The approach appears to be the first quick, practical cure 
for the night shift blues, the on-the-job sleepiness and daytime insomnia that 
plague many of the nation's 7 million night workers. 
</P>
<P>
According to the principal developer, Dr. Charles A. Czeisler of Boston's 
Brigham and Women's Hospital, the technique works this way: People moving to 
the night shift reported to work -- in this case, a hospital lab -- at midnight 
and spent the next eight hours sitting at a desk. While they worked, a bank of 
lights 4 feet away shone with 16 cool-white 40-watt bulbs. 
</P>
<P>
Then they drove home, pulled down blackout shades in their bedrooms and stayed 
in total darkness from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. After just two days, the time on their 
internal clocks shifted almost 10 hours. So instead of hitting the low point in 
their daily cycle about 5 a.m., this happened around 3 p.m. when they were 
still asleep. Those who got the light-dark treatment noticed an immediate 
improvement in their alertness and performance and were able to sleep two hours 
longer a day.

<TEXT>
<P>
Phoenix, which lacks a mountain in the middle and a Mr. Olympia on the wing, 
should be easier for the Lakers to handle than Utah would have been. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Of course, this bit of wisdom comes to you from the same authority who thought 
the Kings were fortunate when they got to play Edmonton instead of Winnipeg in 
the second round of the hockey playoffs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The difference in the Salt Palace Sunday was the free-throw shooting of Sun 
forward Tom Chambers, who gets insulted if the ball hits the rim before 
dropping through the net. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Remember when Utah was being touted as the next power in the NBA after 
extending the Lakers to seven games in the second round in 1988? Since then, 
the Jazz hasn't gotten out of the first round. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Boston showed its age in the fourth quarter Sunday when the big four -- Larry 
Bird, Kevin McHale, Robert Parish and Dennis Johnson -- couldn't stay with New 
York. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Can you imagine Bird missing a dunk shot at crunch time? . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks have the talent to give Detroit a battle in the next round, but the 
question is whether they will continue to play with poise and spirit after what 
should have been a tremendous confidence booster. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Barry Irwin of Clover Racing Stables tried to buy Unbridled after he won a 
stakes race in Florida last December. "There's absolutely no way," he was told 
by a bloodstock agent. "The lady (Frances Genter) who owns him is 92 years old 
and has a zillion dollars. 
</P>
<P>
What's she going to do with the money if she sells the horse?" . . . 
</P>
<P>
ABC did a marvelous job on the replay of the Kentucky Derby, showing trainer 
Carl Nafzger screaming into the ear of Genter during the stretch run. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, this was a pretty dull Derby. No suspense, no controversy, no 
second-guessing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Mister Frisky's disappointing performance was similar to that of another 
favorite coming off a Santa Anita Derby victory, Snow Chief in 1986. Snow Chief 
stopped at the top of the stretch, but came back two weeks later to win the 
Preakness. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Charlie Whittingham was without an entry in Louisville, but he still 
had an impressive winner Saturday. The Prime Minister, a 3-year-old running on 
the turf for the first time in only the second race of his career, won the 
ninth at Hollywood Park in a swift 1:40 3/5 for the 1 1/16 miles. And he did it 
the most difficult way possible on the Hollywood turf course, wire-to-wire. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
A healthy Riki Ellison would help the Raiders, who need improvement at inside 
linebacker. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I look at the senior golf results before those of the regular tour unless it's 
a major or the L.A. Open. . . . 
</P>
<P>
This could be the week that Artesia High basketball star Ed O'Bannon signs his 
letter-of-intent. Nevada Las Vegas and USC reportedly are the most likely 
choices. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's nearly certain that the 1992 U.S. Olympic team will be coached by an NBA 
man. The only college coach with a shot is Duke's Mike Krzyzewski. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky, who has won the Hart Trophy as the most valuable player in the 
NHL nine times, isn't among the three finalists this year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tom Brunansky has just joined Boston, but already there is speculation that the 
Red Sox will trade the power-hitting outfielder to California if they can't 
sign him within a few weeks. Brunansky, who began his major league career with 
the Angels, is in the option year of his contract. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Cecil Fielder should change his name to Hitter. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland Athletics, who used to win world championships without drawing a 
million fans, attracted 139,752 for the weekend series against Boston and are 
aiming for three million this season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
What could be even more harmful to the Dodgers than the loss of Orel Hershiser 
is their lack of a reliable bullpen. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Is it just me or are the umpires giving Fernando Valenzuela that screwball on 
the outside corner, where they weren't before? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh may be another right-handed hitter away from being a pennant 
contender. . . . Break up the Royals! . . . 
</P>
<P>
From commentator Tim McCarver on WWOR's telecast of the Met-Houston 
doubleheader: "You get ahead with strikes, you get 'em out with balls." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Houston catcher Craig Biggio also plays some center field, bringing to mind 
that Dale Murphy began his career behind the plate. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I refuse to believe that Carlton Fisk has played more games for the Chicago 
White Sox than the Boston Red Sox.

EX-RAM IS ACCUSED IN CRASH;

TRAFFIC ACCIDENT: LAGUNA HILLS WOMAN IS KILLED AND DOUG FRANCE IS SERIOUSLY 
INJURED. DRUNK DRIVING IS SUSPECTED.

<TEXT>
<P>
Doug France, a former Ram offensive lineman and two-time Pro Bowl player, 
remained in serious condition but was awake and responsive Sunday after a 
two-car accident in Laguna Hills in which a 53-year-old woman was killed. 
</P>
<P>
France, all-pro in 1978 and 1980, was cited for investigation of felony drunk 
driving after the accident Saturday afternoon on a narrow, winding road near 
his home, according to the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP gave this account: 
</P>
<P>
France, 37, was driving a late-model BMW as it sped down Aliso Hills Drive at 
an estimated 70 m.p.h. to 85 m.p.h. when he apparently lost control. His car 
veered into one driven by Maria C. Contreras, 53, of Laguna Hills, who was 
killed when she was thrown from her car by the impact. 
</P>
<P>
France was taken to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo, 
where he was treated for head injuries and a broken pelvis. He had been 
admitted in critical condition but was upgraded later Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
France, who played for the Rams from 1975 to 1981, has a wife and two sons.

Steve Larmer had the goals, but gave the credit to Denis Savard. 
</P>
<P>
Larmer scored the tying and go-ahead goals, and Savard had three assists Sunday 
night as the Chicago Blackhawks took a 2-1 lead in their NHL semifinal playoff 
series with a 5-1 rout of the Edmonton Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the credit has to go to Denny," Larmer said. "He was hurt late in the 
season and had his troubles early in the playoffs. But tonight he was on top of 
his game. The pass he made on the goal that made it 3-1 was a typical Savard 
play. He took it away from the Oilers and set me up perfectly." 
</P>
<P>
Game 4 will be played at Chicago Tuesday night, with Game 5 Thursday night at 
Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
Dirk Graham clinched the victory with his specialty, a short-handed goal at 
7:27 of the final period. It was the first playoff goal for Graham, who led the 
Blackhawks with three shorthanded goals during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton Coach John Muckler lamented some missed chances. 
</P>
<P>
"We had our opportunities and never scored," Muckler said. "They had theirs and 
scored. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can come back to tie the series and go home tied, we'll be in good 
shape. We're getting chances but we're not putting it away.' 
</P>
<P>
Chicago's Greg Millen stopped 31 shots for his second consecutive victory over 
the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers took the early lead at 6:01 of the first period on a power-play goal 
by Craig Simpson, his ninth of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton's Esa Tikkanen went off for interference at 6:35 and five seconds 
after the penalty expired, Bob Murray's goal tied the game. 
</P>
<P>
Larmer's goal at 12:32 of the first period gave Chicago a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Larmer scored on a pass from Savard at 3:05 of the second period to make it 
3-1.

KNICKS BURY CELTICS IN THE GARDEN, 121-114;

NBA PLAYOFFS: NEW YORK RALLIES FROM 2-0 DEFICIT TO TAKE BEST-OF-FIVE SERIES,

The New York Knicks rose from the dead in a building where they have been 
buried so many times. 
</P>
<P>
In Boston Garden, where they had not won a regular-season game in six years or 
a playoff game in 16 years, the Knicks moved into the second round of the NBA 
playoffs Sunday with a 121-114 victory over the Boston Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
"It had to happen some time," New York Coach Stu Jackson said. "I'm going to 
take 24 hours and enjoy this." 
</P>
<P>
Said Celtic Larry Bird: "We're in shock. All I know is, I'll wake up tomorrow 
morning and still be in shock." 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks became the third team in NBA history to win a best-of-five series 
after losing the first two games. The Ft. Wayne Pistons did it in 1956 and the 
Golden State Warriors in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Those weren't the only incredible odds the Knicks overcame in advancing to the 
best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinals against Detroit, starting Tuesday 
night at Auburn Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
New York had lost 26 consecutive games at Boston Garden since winning Feb. 29, 
1984, and nine playoff games since the last victory there April 19, 1974. The 
Knicks, losers of 10 of their previous 11 road games, ended Boston's 13-game 
home winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
They capped an improbable climb from a 157-128 loss eight days earlier when 
Boston set NBA single-game playoff records for points and shooting accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
"It gave us a lot more fight," Patrick Ewing, who had 31 points and 10 assists, 
said of the rout. "We wanted to come out and prove something to everybody." 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks went home and evened the series by winning, 102-99, Wednesday night 
and, 135-108, Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Ewing, who played 47 minutes, and Maurice Cheeks, who played 48, led 
them on a decisive 12-2 run. The spurt turned a 101-99 lead into a 113-101 
advantage with 2:02 left. Ewing ended it with the second three-pointer of his 
career, giving New York its biggest lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We had our chances," Boston's Kevin McHale said. "They beat us flat out. We 
can't sit here and make excuses." 
</P>
<P>
Cheeks had 21 points and Charles Oakley, who missed the last 17 regular-season 
games with a broken left hand and returned for the playoff opener, had 26 
points and 17 rebounds in 44 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"We just made all the big plays," Ewing said. "Charles Oakley was tremendous 
cleaning the backboard." 
</P>
<P>
Bird had 31 points for the Celtics, but missed several shots down the stretch, 
including a dunk with 4:16 left. Robert Parish had 22 points for Boston, Dennis 
Johnson 21. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since 1952, Boston was eliminated in the opening round for 
two straight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"This is as low as it gets," Bird said. "This is unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
New York never trailed in the fourth quarter, fighting off numerous Boston 
comebacks with excellent shooting. The Knicks made 69% of their shots in the 
final quarter and 59% in the game. 
</P>
<P>
With the score 101-99, Ewing began the 12-2 run with a short hook with 4:34 
left. Cheeks made an 18-foot jumper, making it 105-99 with 4:08 remaining. 
Reggie Lewis and Cheeks traded baskets before New York pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
Bird missed a 12-foot jumper with 3:09 left and a three-pointer by Johnny 
Newman put New York ahead, 110-101, with 2:53 remaining. Johnson then missed a 
jumper, and Ewing put an exclamation point on the victory with a three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
That gave the Knicks a 113-101 lead. They led by seven to 12 points the rest of 
the way, making their final eight points on free throws. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a great game, a great series, and rose to the occasion," Boston Coach 
Jimmy Rodgers said. "It's a tough way to go down." 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics never trailed in the first quarter when Bird had 13 points, taking 
a 32-24 lead. 
</P>
<P>
With the score 36-28 with 9:14 left in the half, New York took its first lead 
during an 11-point run that made it 39-36 with 6:50 left. 
</P>
<P>
A tip by Ewing, who had only 10 first-half points, broke a 44-44 tie. But 
Boston responded with an 8-0 run and took a 52-46 lead 57 seconds before 
intermission. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing's 10-foot jumper with six-tenths of a second left cut Boston's lead to 
54-50 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
The lead changed hands five times in the third quarter, the last on a dunk by 
Gerald Wilkins with 2:39 left that put the Knicks ahead, 80-79. Oakley followed 
with two free throws and Ewing dunked, capping an 18-6 run that turned a 73-66 
deficit into an 84-79 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing had 14 points and Cheeks 11 in the period, which ended with New York 
ahead, 87-83.

EARNHARDT HOLDS OFF SACKS TO WIN RACE AT TALLADEGA

<TEXT>
<P>
Dale Earnhardt fought off Greg Sacks over the final 17 laps to win a battle of 
Chevrolet Luminas in Sunday's Winston 500 at Talladega, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
They were at the head of the pack when the green flag waved following the final 
caution flag on the 172nd of 188 laps. 
</P>
<P>
Sacks stayed on Earnhardt's rear bumper until the last lap around the 
2.66-mile, high-banked oval. At that point, Earnhardt was able to pull away a 
bit then hold on to beat Sacks by two car lengths. 
</P>
<P>
Sacks, whose only Winston Cup victory -- considered one of the biggest upsets 
in NASCAR history -- came in the July 1985 race at Daytona International 
Speedway in a research and development car, got close this time in the debut of 
a new team co-owned by Charlotte, N.C., businessman Rick Hendrick and actor 
Paul Newman. 
</P>
<P>
It did not appear that Earnhardt was beatable as he led eight times for 113 
laps on the 2.66-mile oval, including the final 22. 
</P>
<P>
Earnhardt, who won $98,975, averaged 159.571 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Lori Johns covered the quarter mile in 5.009 seconds at 270.10 m.p.h. to claim 
her second consecutive NHRA Winston Drag Racing Series victory at Memphis 
(Tenn.) Motorsports Park. 
</P>
<P>

GOLF ROUNDUP;

<P>
STEWART TURNS BAD TIMES TO GOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coming down the stretch in the lead of the Byron Nelson tournament brought back 
memories for Payne Stewart -- all of them bad. 
</P>
<P>
But Stewart exorcised his personal demons Sunday with a three-under-par 67 at 
Irving, Tex., to take a two-stroke victory over charging Lanny Wadkins. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I had something coming to me in the Dallas-Ft. Worth metroplex," 
Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to his misfortunes in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area when, in 
consecutive years during the 1980s, he lost the Colonial in nearby Ft. Worth, 
lost again in this event, then lost again at Ft. Worth -- all in playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"In some of them, I beat myself," Stewart said. "You don't mind when somebody 
beats you. You mind a lot when you beat yourself. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've learned not to beat myself." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, the PGA champion and a playoff winner in the Heritage Classic last 
month, proved his point. 
</P>
<P>
He was under fire by some of golf's best players -- Greg Norman, Mark 
Calcavecchia and Wadkins -- but held to win the tournament he had established 
as one of his career goals. 
</P>
<P>
"Except for Bay Hill (where he resides), this is my most emotional victory," he 
said. "This is as sweet as the PGA." 
</P>
<P>
Wadkins, who made the last, and best, run at Stewart, predicted it could be the 
start of greatness. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Payne is just now learning to win," Wadkins said. "I think he is going 
to be a great player for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart finished with an eight-under-par total of 202 in the tournament that 
was shortened to 54 holes because of early-week floods. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the seventh of his career and he joined rookie Robert Gamez as 
the only other multiple winner on the PGA Tour this year. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was worth $180,000 from the purse of $1 million and lifted 
Stewart's earnings for the season to $496,491. It also lifted his career 
earnings to $4,103,198, making him the seventh player to pass the $4 million 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
Another playoff appeared a distinct possibility when Wadkins made a brilliant 
stretch run with a 65, best round of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
But Stewart preserved his a one-stroke lead with a five-foot par putt on the 
15th hole, then pushed the margin to two with a five-footer for birdie on the 
16th. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I had much chance," Wadkins said. "I kind of conceded him a 
birdie on the 16th and that was enough. My hat's off to him. He's been knocking 
on the door here a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia had a 69 to tie Bruce Lietzke (68) for third at 207. Norman 
finished with a 69 for 209. 
</P>
<P>
Chi Chi Rodriguez shot a four-under-par 68 to edge defending champion Charles 
Coody and George Archer by one stroke and win the PGA Senior tournament at Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, who lost to Coody in a playoff in the tournament last year, strung 
together three rounds in the 60s to finish 12-under and win his first 
tournament of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time a 12 beats an 11 in Las Vegas," said Rodriguez. "I'm 
real excited. It's been a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, who was tied with Archer for the lead going into the final round, 
birdied the first hole and never relinquished the lead. He had a two-shot lead 
before making a bogey on No. 17, but he and Archer both parred the 18th. 
</P>
<P>
Archer shot 69 in the final round, while Coody had a 67, missing a 20-foot putt 
on 18 that would have forced a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
Ayako Okamoto of Japan overtook Pat Bradley and Dawn Coe on with a 
four-under-par 68 for a one-stroke victory in the $425,000 Sara Lee tournament 
at Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the 16th in nine years on the LPGA Tour for Okamoto, who earned 
$63,750. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley was three shots ahead after a 33 on the front nine, but she made four 
bogeys on the back side and finished with a 73. 
</P>
<P>
Coe had a chance to force a playoff, but bogeyed the final hole.

TENNIS ROUNDUP;

ON CLAY COURT, GRAF BEATS SANCHEZ VICARIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After missing six weeks with a hand injury, Steffi Graf, the No. 1 player in 
the world, has vaulted back to the top of the women's tour points standings. 
And Sunday, she served notice that she could handle Arantxa Sanchez Vicario on 
clay, last year's French Open notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Graf of West Germany lost a 61-minute first set to No. 4-ranked Sanchez Vicario 
of Spain, but came back to win, 5-7, 6-0, 6-1, in the finals of a $350,000 
tournament in Hamburg, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In hot weather, Graf was forced to toil on the slow red clay court at the 
Rothenbaum Club by an inspired Sanchez Vicario before collecting the winner's 
prize of $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
At the outset, Graf was unable to cope with Sanchez Vicario's aggressive play. 
Graf's generally strong forehand also was letting her down. In the first set, 
Graf often went for the big shot but would miss by inches. 
</P>
<P>
After losing her first two service games, Graf was twice a point away from 
trailing 0-4. But on both occasions, she forced Sanchez Vicario into an error. 
</P>
<P>
Graf rallied to cut the deficit to 2-3, but her game suffered again as Sanchez 
Vicario won the next two games to lead 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez Vicario lost her serve at 5-4 and appeared in trouble. But Graf, still 
struggling to cope with her failing forehand, dropped her serve in the 11th 
game. 
</P>
<P>
When Sanchez Vicario held serve to win the first set, she appeared heading for 
a repeat of her upset victory over Graf in last year's French Open final. 
</P>
<P>
The match completely changed in the second set as Graf found her range, and 
Sanchez Vicario found she could no longer chase after every ball. Graf won the 
set in 34 minutes but was pushed to deuce in five of the six games. 
</P>
<P>
Graf again dropped serve at the start of the final set. However, she 
immediately broke back and did not lose another game. 
</P>
<P>
It was Graf's fourth title of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect Arantxa to play as well as she did," Graf said. "She didn't 
miss a ball in the first three games. But I played more intelligently after the 
first set and everything went right." 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez Vicario said she missed many opportunities to win. 
</P>
<P>
"She played so much better in the third set, but I'm happy because I had a good 
tournament and I played well," added Sanchez Vicario, who beat No. 2 Martina 
Navratilova in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Karel Novacek of Czechoslovakia capped a tournament of upsets with yet another, 
a 6-4, 6-2 victory over Austria's Thomas Muster in the final of a $277,500 
tournament at Munich. 
</P>
<P>
Novacek, ranked 69th in the world, downed 19th-ranked Muster in a surprisingly 
one-sided match to claim his first title of the year. 
</P>
<P>
All eight seeded players, including the top-seeded Stefan Edberg of Sweden, 
were beaten before the third round. 
</P>
<P>
"I have had a really great week," said Novacek, who used his powerful serve to 
great effect in winning $32,400. "And today was the best match I have ever 
played. Everything seemed to go well for me." 
</P>
<P>
Andres Gomez of Ecuador won the $279,000 Madrid Grand Prix tournament by 
defeating Marc Rosset of Switzerland, 6-3, 7-6 (7-3). 
</P>
<P>
Gomez, 30, earned $40,400 for his victory.

READY MONEY: The heyday of easy capital for high-tech industries is over, but 
that doesn't mean capital isn't available, says Newport Beach investment banker 
Gregory E. Presson (D6). . . . With 20 to 30 well-connected venture capital 
firms here, "there is an enormous amount of venture capital available in Orange 
County that wasn't available 10 years ago," he says. "A lot of the high-tech 
companies here . . . haven't scored as well as Silicon Valley's high-tech 
firms, but in fairness they haven't been around as long." Kris Lindgren and

JUDGE TRYING SUIT FILED BY INMATES TOURS JUVENILE HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The padded rooms at Juvenile Hall are usually reserved for the real 
troublemakers: the kicking, screaming, biting youths who endanger others. But 
for a few minutes on Sunday, the "rubber rooms" were home to a different kind 
of occupant: a judge. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by a phalanx of attorneys and a half-dozen of the county Probation 
Department's top-tier managers, Superior Court Judge Linda H. McLaughlin toured 
Juvenile Hall, asking questions and taking notes. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of the county, which is defending itself against a class-action, 
civil-rights lawsuit that alleges that adolescents were mistreated at the hall, 
McLaughlin got a look at the facility and a detailed description of the life 
that teens live there. She paid special attention to the areas that form the 
key elements of the trial: rubber rooms and the cubicles where misbehaving 
youths are tied to metal-frame beds with soft strips of cloth. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing sneakers, dark blue corduroy slacks and a short-sleeved shirt, 
McLaughlin walked into one of the windowless rubber rooms and stood silently 
for a few minutes, taking in the bare, tan walls, the mattress on the floor, 
the heavy smell of disinfectant, the scratched window in the door. She touched 
the walls, which look normal but which give slightly when they are pounded. 
</P>
<P>
Turning to Juvenile Hall director Stephanie Lewis, who was leading the tour, 
McLaughlin asked about the ventilation in the rubber room. 
</P>
<P>
"Is this how it would be?" the judge asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it stifling?" Lewis asked. 
</P>
<P>
"It might be to the breather," McLaughlin said. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis told the judge that rubber room detainees are under constant surveillance 
by staffers. But what if the staff member steps away for a moment, McLaughlin 
asked. Could a child in a padded room be heard if he or she needed help? Lewis 
assured her that any shouting would be heard down the hall. 
</P>
<P>
Not far away, the judge entered one of the "tie-down" rooms, where a bed is 
bolted to the floor. McLaughlin, her bailiff, her clerk and a paralegal, who 
were also along on the tour, crowded into the small room and the door closed 
behind them. The judge wanted to see what it would feel like to a teen shut 
inside with several staff members about to apply the soft-tie restraints at the 
wrists and ankles. She made a few notes on her pad and left the room silently. 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin permitted reporters inside Juvenile Hall but barred photographers. 
The 80-minute tour provided a rare glimpse into the place where hundreds of 
errant adolescents are kept each year. 
</P>
<P>
The American Civil Liberties Union and San Francisco's Youth Law Center, 
representing all current and former detainees of the hall, contend that the 
standards of care there fall far below what they should: that teen-agers are 
tied down or thrown into rubber rooms too frequently and without sufficient 
cause and that their privacy is routinely invaded with strip-searches, censored 
mail, monitored phone calls. The plaintiffs also contend the teen-agers have 
difficulty getting access to phones and lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
The county insists that teen-agers are restrained or placed in rubber rooms, 
which the county calls "safety" or "de-escalation" rooms, when they are so 
dangerous that they could hurt themselves or those around them. 
</P>
<P>
As the trial enters its fourth week today, the plaintiffs are scheduled to wrap 
up their case and the county will begin presenting evidence that its policies 
and practices are necessary for the security of the facility and well within 
the national norm for handling juvenile offenders. 
</P>
<P>
The tour group, about 20 people in all, became a bit of a curiosity to the 
detainees. As the tight knot of adults meandered through the hall, clusters of 
youths who were eating sandwiches or watching television fell silent, then 
giggled nervously as the tour group passed. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis led the group through each of the 15 units of the hall, from where the 
boys and girls are separately admitted and processed to where they live, work 
and play. The outdoor areas resemble a school yard, with basketball courts and 
baseball diamonds cut into the broad lawns. But the extra-high fences and, in 
high-security units, barbed wire were reminders that this was no school. 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin walked slowly down the long corridors, looking into the single rooms 
that make up most of the living space, and into the occasional dormitory-style 
accommodations. The rooms are made of painted cement block, with a mattress on 
a cement ledge built into the wall. Some rooms have toilets; some have a tiny 
counter for writing with a small stool. They have only one window, high up and 
clouded with dirt. The units have been decorated with bright touches: one 
life-size poster of basketball hero Magic Johnson, another that quotes singer 
Bobby McFerrin: "Don't Worry, Be Happy." 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin examined the central monitoring stations, where staffers can cut off 
a detainee's phone call after five minutes. She passed by the restroom areas, 
where the staff can watch teens on the toilet or in the shower, their bodies 
blocked only by waist-high barriers. 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin examined one of the rooms that have been converted from singles to 
doubles because of overcrowding. A cot, slung with green canvas and fitted with 
a bowed mattress, was wedged against one wall, perpendicular to the room's 
normal bed. 
</P>
<P>
As the group ended its tour, two youths were being admitted. In jeans and torn, 
dirty white T-shirts, the two thin adolescents were escorted inside, their 
hands behind their backs.

LIBRARY REOPENING SCHEDULED JUNE 25

<P>
After being closed since December because of remodeling and a series of mishaps 
with replacement carpeting, the Garden Grove Regional Library is now scheduled 
to reopen June 25. 
</P>
<P>
The library was supposed to reopen Feb. 13, but a defective carpet caused that 
deadline to be missed. 
</P>
<P>
A second reopening target date of March 26 also passed when another replacement 
carpet proved to be a mismatch. 
</P>
<P>
Gary C. Gray, chief of facilities and construction for the county General 
Services Agency, said, "We received the carpet on May 1, and the installation 
and all other physical improvements should be completed by June 1." 
</P>
<P>
That done, the staff must still complete its work, including the reorganization 
of books and other materials at the library at 11200 Stanford Ave. 
</P>
<P>
For the last five months, people have been directed to the two smaller

PANEL CREATED TO AID STALLED DISTRICT TALKS

In a move to restart negotiations between Fountain Valley's school district and 
the teachers' union, a special fact-finding panel will meet this week to listen 
to testimony from both sides of the contract dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, the panel will listen to testimony and determine if anybody is 
lying," district Supt. Ruben L. Ingrim said. 
</P>
<P>
The three-member panel, scheduled to meet Wednesday, will include 
representatives from the teachers' union, the school district and the state 
Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, which could last up to three days, the panel will present 
its findings to the school district's governing board. However, the panel's 
findings are strictly advisory. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Harlan, executive director of the West Orange County United Teachers' 
Assn., which represents Fountain Valley's 262 elementary-school teachers, said 
these fact-finding panels are generally purposeless, especially in Fountain 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time this sort of thing happened was three years ago," Harlan said. 
"Then, when the fact-finding panel reported to the governing board -- 
recommending a larger pay increase -- the board completely ignored them. I have 
no reason to believe the board will not act similarly." 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley's teachers have gone a year without a new contract. The main 
stumbling block is the district's proposed 2.57% pay increase, which the 
teacher's union says is well below the 6.75% proposed by the majority of Orange 
County school districts. 
</P>
<P>
While Ingrim admits that the proposed pay raise is below the rest of the 
districts, he said Fountain Valley's pay scale is one of the highest in Orange 
County and the rest of the districts are catching up. 
</P>
<P>
But Harlan contents that if the union agreed to the school district's proposal, 
Fountain Valley teachers would then be in the bottom half of the county's pay 
schedule. In addition, he said the school district's health benefits are among 
the poorest in the county and should be considered in the bargaining package.

3 ARTISTS SOUGHT FOR BICENTENNIAL MURALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Westminster Bicentennial Foundation is looking for three local artists to 
paint patriotic murals inside the civic center. 
</P>
<P>
To be considered, artists must live in or attend school in the city. 
</P>
<P>
They should submit an 8-by-10-inch sample of a proposed design relating to the 
theme "Birth of Our Nation," celebrating the 200th birthday of the U.S. 
Constitution. The first-place winner will receive $500 and be designated the 
"Official Bicentennial Artist of Westminster." That artist will paint the 
largest of three murals. 
</P>
<P>
The second-place winner will receive $200 and the third-place winner $150. They 
will each paint smaller murals. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided to do something for the community that would have a lasting 
effect," said Trudy Gibbons, a Bicentennial Foundation board member. "These 
murals will remain indefinitely and will be a source of pride and prestige for 
the artists selected." 
</P>
<P>
All entries must be labeled with the artist's name, address and phone number. 
They must be turned in to the Westminster Community Services and Recreation 
Department at 8200 Westminster Blvd. by May 15. 
</P>
<P>
Winners will be chosen by the Bicentennial Foundation and announced on June 14.

RACIAL IMBALANCE AT SCHOOL STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with a disproportionately soaring Latino enrollment at one of its 
elementary schools, the Ocean View School District board is studying ways to 
end the school's segregation. 
</P>
<P>
Between December, 1987, and October, 1989, the Latino student population at Oak 
View School jumped from 47% to more than 70%, a racial anomaly in a district 
composed chiefly of Anglo students. 
</P>
<P>
During an emergency meeting called Thursday to address the issue, school board 
members agreed to set up an advisory committee to suggest alternatives for 
desegregating the school. A staff attorney from the County Department of 
Education has been called in to guide district officials through the 
complicated legal maze of leveling Oak View's unbalanced ethnic makeup. 
</P>
<P>
The school, located in a predominantly Latino neighborhood northwest of Beach 
Boulevard and Slater Avenue, also includes 14% Asian and 14% Anglo students, 
according to 1989 figures. Two years earlier, Asian students composed 30% of 
Oak View's enrollment and Anglos made up 22%. 
</P>
<P>
The segregation issue arose during an advisory committee's discussions about 
restructuring the schools in the district, which may include closing three 
schools and realigning boundaries of many others. 
</P>
<P>
Options under study for ending the racial disparity include redrawing Oak 
View's boundaries, changing its grades to something other than kindergarten 
through sixth, or closing the school and sending its students to neighboring 
schools, district officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Board members said they hope to incorporate a desegregation clause into the 
districtwide restructuring plan that the committee is scheduled to present May 
22. 
</P>
<P>
Some efforts must be made toward resolving the dilemma before next year, when 
state officials are scheduled to review the ethnic balance at the district's 
schools, Supt. Monte McMurray said. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Education conducts demographic analyses for each 
district every four years. During its last review of Ocean View in December, 
1987, it concluded that Oak View was "in danger of racial isolation" but agreed 
with the district's assertion that the only solutions available were not 
economically feasible at the time, said Geraldine Jaffe, the county attorney 
studying the issue for the district. 
</P>
<P>
The state also concluded, however, that the standard of education offered at 
Oak View was equal to that of the district's other 16 schools. 
</P>
<P>
If the district does nothing about Oak View's ethnic imbalance by 1991, the 
state probably would recommend a specific course of action for the district to 
take, which could be imposed upon the district by a court order, Jaffe said.

5-CENT HIKE SOUGHT ON REGULAR BUS FARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some Orange County bus passengers would have to pay a nickel more per trip if a 
proposed fare increase is approved after a public hearing today. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, the one-way, regular fee would increase from 85 cents to 90 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Transit District Board of Directors will also consider 
reducing the fare for handicapped passengers from the current 85 cents to 45 
cents during peak hours and from 40 cents to 15 cents in off-peak periods. 
</P>
<P>
The district's dial-a-ride fares would increase from $1.70 to $1.80, and from 
80 cents to 90 cents for seniors and handicapped passengers. Dial-a-ride 
provides curb-to-curb van service by appointment within small zones. 
</P>
<P>
The public hearing is scheduled for 9 a.m. at the OCTD offices in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, the transit district's board will get its first look at a proposed 
1990-91 operating budget that is expected to surpass $200 million for the first 
time because OCTD will be funding initial phases of transit-way construction at 
the Santa Ana Freeway-Costa Mesa Freeway interchange, officials said.

SCHOOLS TEAMING UP IN NURSING PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To meet what health officials call "a critical need for nurses" in Southern 
California, Golden West College has teamed up with other education groups in a 
plan to help bring more high school students into the nursing profession. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is called "Two Plus Two Plus Two." 
</P>
<P>
The formula involves two years of work at the high school level, two years at 
the community college level and the final two years at a four-year university. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Golden West, the plan involves all of the high schools in the 
Huntington Beach Union High School District. It also involves the Coastline 
Regional Occupational Program and Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
High school students interested in a nursing career are steered to the proper 
courses in biology, chemistry, English and mathematics. They are also linked to 
the regional occupational program, which enables them to get practical 
experience and to receive a certificate as a nurse assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Following high school graduation, students in the program take two years of 
study at Golden West, culminating in receipt of an associate degree in nursing. 
They then progress to Cal State Fullerton, where they can earn a bachelor of 
science after completion of two more years of work. 
</P>
<P>
"The Two Plus Two Plus Two program ensures that a student is constantly exposed 
to new knowledge in the arena of health sciences, rather than spending time 
repeating course work at each tier of the program," said a spokeswoman for the 
college. "In addition, Two Plus Two Plus Two students are prepared for 
immediate job placement after completion of each level of study." BILL BILLITER

CASHIERED CANDIDATE PLANNING COMEBACK

<P>
A week after being disqualified as a candidate for Canyon High School student 
body president because he distributed condoms to classmates along with his 
campaign literature, Patrick Lee is determined to make a political comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Lee, 17, of Anaheim Hills, said Saturday that he will run for senior class 
president in this month's school elections. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Dunne, Canyon assistant principal, confirmed that Lee is eligible to run 
for the office and said that the junior has already put his name on a 
candidates sign-up list. Class elections are held separately from the student 
body elections. 
</P>
<P>
Lee was kicked off the ballot for student body president last week after he 
passed out about 100 condoms, along with a flyer saying that a vote for him was 
a "safe" vote. School officials said Lee violated an election oath he and the 
other candidates made to run their campaigns in a tasteful and appropriate 
manner. 
</P>
<P>
While he decried the punishment as too extreme, Lee said he won't use condoms 
in his upcoming campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be more conservative but just as creative this time," Lee said. 
"I have to go back to the Puritan days, according to my school." 
</P>
<P>
Lee said the one-day condom handout was not in poor taste because Canyon High 
School presented an assembly about safe sex and contraception just a month 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was a brand new idea, and the school just stopped it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the controversy did have a positive side for Lee. He admits that all 
the publicity made him more popular around campus -- and perhaps more 
electable. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people at school know me now," Lee said. "I may run a more basic campaign 
this time and just hand out candy." SHELBY GRAD

TRACK AND FIELD: ESPERANZA'S TRIO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THREE OF THE COUNTY'S TOP 
FOUR SHOTPUT MARKS THIS SEASON. 
</P>

<P>
Asked to name a few personal highlights of the 1990 track and field season, 
Esperanza High School shotputters Mike Burns, Mark Kinney and Mark Parlin 
glanced at one another with bored looks and shrugged as if the question had no 
relevance. 
</P>
<P>
Despite making up the most successful shotput trio in the Southern Section, and 
perhaps the entire state, Burns, Kinney and Parlin act as if they do not get 
much joy from their sport. In fact, Burns and Kinney seem to treat it with a 
certain degree of disgust. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no highlights in track," Kinney said with a sneer. "We hate track." 
</P>
<P>
Said Burns: "It's at the bottom of my list." 
</P>
<P>
Parlin admitted he liked track, but then took a considerable ribbing from his 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
"I do (like it)," Parlin said. "It's all right." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that's why Parlin, a 6-foot-1, 220-pound junior, has the superior marks 
of this bunch. His best toss, 61 feet 4 inches, an Empire League record set 
Thursday, ranks first in the Southern Section and second in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Kinney, a 6-4, 235-pound senior, has a best of 57-5 1/4. Burns, a 6-2, 
220-pound junior, has gone 55-9 1/2. They rank first, second and fourth in the 
county, respectively, and Thursday they swept the top three places at the 
Empire League finals to help Esperanza win the league title. 
</P>
<P>
All three also compete in the discus, with Parlin leading the way at 175-3, the 
second-best mark in the county this year. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their claims of disliking the sport, Kinney, Burns and Parlin do enjoy 
what they're doing, says Bill Pendleton, Esperanza's shotput coach. 
</P>
<P>
"They just love to complain," Pendleton said. "Like Burns, he told me all year 
he wasn't going to come out and the first day of practice, he was out there. No 
one's forcing them." 
</P>
<P>
Well, not technically. All three play football -- Parlin started at fullback 
last fall, Kinney and Burns at linebacker -- and all three compete in track, 
they say, because Pendleton, an assistant football coach, encouraged them to 
come out as freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm made to do it. That's the only reason," Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton, 37, who in 1987 won a national age-group title in the shotput, has 
supervised Esperanza's strength program for 13 years, and has been coaching the 
shotputters for the last five. He says every year he combs the freshman weight 
class, picking out the 10 biggest ninth-graders in an effort to strengthen 
Esperanza's ranks in the shotput and discus. 
</P>
<P>
And Kinney, Burns and Parlin have contributed significantly. In the last two 
years, Esperanza has been undefeated in all shotput relays -- events in which 
three shotputters on the same team combine their best marks of the day for a 
total score. At the Poway Invitational, they set records in both the shotput 
and discus. At the county's oldest track meet, the Tustin Relays, their 
combined score ranked second to Edison on the all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday at San Clemente High, they led Esperanza to its third consecutive 
victory at a weight-lifting competition this season. 
</P>
<P>
Kinney squatted 550 pounds in competition Saturday and has bench-pressed 365. 
On first impression he seems to fit the high school football player stereotype. 
</P>
<P>
Kinney, who says his goal is to reach 60 feet in the shotput and place in the 
state meet, also wants to try to concentrate more on his studies. 
</P>
<P>
Burns, who along with Kinney hopes to become a police officer, has the best 
speed of the three. Last year, he won the frosh/soph league title in the 100 
meters, and has 4.6 speed in the 40. He wasn't pleased with his third-place 
mark of 48-9 1/4 at the league meet Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been disappointed lately," he said. "My PR (personal record) fell seven 
feet. I should be able to get out of bed and throw 50 feet. . . . I have the 
school record in choke." 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton, who said he expected Burns to perform as he did Thursday because he 
has yet to take an extended rest from training, called Burns "a little more 
psycho than the others." 
</P>
<P>
In short, Burns has been known to eat moths. 
</P>
<P>
Parlin is not nearly as extreme. As the first county shotputter to throw more 
than 60 feet since Kaleaph Carter of Edison in 1988, Parlin says he hopes to 
win the Southern Section title at the sectional championships May 18, and is 
aiming for a second place finish at the state meet in June. 
</P>
<P>
Fallbrook senior Brent Noon, the nation's prep shotput leader this season at 
73-3 1/2, isn't expected to be challenged at the state level. Of course, with 
Noon graduating in June, Parlin's chances for a state title look better next 
year.

FULLERTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton went to its usual power source for one home run and to an 
unexpected source for two more Sunday in a 15-4 victory over UC Santa Barbara 
that moved the Titans back into first place in the Big West Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Nevin had a team-leading 14th home run among his three hits and six RBIs 
for Fullerton (29-20, 11-4 in conference), which regained a half-game lead over 
Fresno State. Cal State Long Beach defeated Fresno, 9-7, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Hattabaugh added two home runs and four runs batted in for Fullerton, 
which took two of the three games in the weekend series. For Hattabaugh, they 
were only his second and third home runs of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just trying to make contact," he said. "I haven't been hitting that good 
this year, but now I'm starting to hit like I can." 
</P>
<P>
Hattabaugh, a junior catcher from Cerritos College, hit a solo home run to lead 
off the second inning and give Fullerton a 3-1 lead. Nevin added a two-run 
homer in the same inning and the Titans led, 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton continued to build its lead with a run in the third, two in the 
fourth, three in the seventh and four in the eighth. Hattabaugh had a two-run 
home run and Nevin a two-run triple in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Charles had two hits and two RBIs, and Dave Ayala and Steve Sisco each 
had two hits for Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans' offense made things a little easier for pitchers Sam Colarusso and 
Chris Robinson, who tried to make things difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Colarusso (6-3) allowed eight hits and five walks but only two runs as Santa 
Barbara left nine runners on base in his seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
He walked three in the first but was helped when Hattabaugh threw out Jerrold 
Rountree trying to steal. Rountree, who is 51 of 71 on stolen-base attempts 
this season, was one for three in the series. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara scored in the second and had the bases loaded when Colarusso got 
a double play to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Colarusso retired Santa Barbara in order only once, in the sixth. He allowed 
two hits and a run in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Robinson allowed two runs on four hits and two walks in the final two 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
In another Big West Conference game: 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine 8, San Jose State 4 -- Mike Goodcase and Fred Combs each had two hits 
and two RBIs, Billy Bardens had two hits and an RBI, and Al Rodriguez had two 
hits for host Irvine (31-24, 7-11). 
</P>
<P>
Chris Huber (7-2) pitched 6 1/3 innings for the victory, and Joe Sewell worked 
the final 2 2/3 innings for his third save. David Tellers, a former Western 
High School and Rancho Santiago standout, allowed six runs and eight hits in 
five innings to take the loss. He is 11-4 for San Jose State (41-15, 8-10). 
</P>
<P>
In nonconference tennis: 
</P>
<P>
UCLA 6, UC Irvine 3 -- UC Irvine's Trevor Kronemann, the Big West Conference 
singles champion, defeated Pacific 10 singles champion Jason Netter, 6-4, 6-1. 
UCLA (25-3) won three singles and all three doubles matches. Irvine is 18-12.

THE READERS TALK BACK -- IN PERSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's always an eye-opener for me to get out from behind my computer terminal 
and meet some of the people who read this column. It's a great way to find out 
what people are thinking and what they really care about. The other day, I gave 
a talk sponsored by the Works Gallery at Five Feet Two restaurant in Newport 
Beach, and when it was over the audience had many questions. 
</P>
<P>
I had said in the talk that the kind of contemporary art most interesting to me 
these days is "conceptual" in a broad sense -- meaning that the ideas 
motivating the work are ultimately more important than its level of craft, 
finish or emotional expression. Happily, the new wave of conceptual work tends 
to be more engagingly quizzical on a visual level than the old wave, which 
consisted largely of printed texts, with no visual content at all. 
</P>
<P>
I made a stumbling attempt to describe some of the motivations of conceptual 
artists, such as their investigations into the clash of cultures, tastes and 
attitudes that exist side by side in daily life. This is an aspect of the 
culturally relativistic outlook that conservatives love to hate. 
</P>
<P>
Free to forage high and low for material, fascinated by the phenomenon of style 
and beholden to no central definition of beauty or truth, conceptual artists 
are researchers into the way we process information, the way we make 
connections between one thing and another. 
</P>
<P>
One woman in the audience said she figured that she could have the same 
thoughts without bothering to look at the art. She wanted to know what I 
thought about the contemporary watercolor painting scene. 
</P>
<P>
To my mind, watercolor painting -- once a sideline of such significant American 
artists as John Marin, Charles Demuth and Winslow Homer -- has become the 
province of genteel illustrators utterly uninvolved with the issues of 
contemporary art. The notion of even bothering to differentiate one 
watercolorist from another frankly seems a waste of time. 
</P>
<P>
I think I said something a tad less dismissive to the woman. Sometimes it seems 
incredible how few things two people who both profess a love of art can have in 
common. For the most part, it's the old split between those who like to think 
of art as a friendly, constant North Star and those who view art as a shooting 
star, a brief burst of illumination that dashes off to points unknown. 
</P>
<P>
An older man in the audience also seemed plainly uncomfortable with all this 
talk about conceptual art. He offered the example of British painter Francis 
Bacon, subject of a recent retrospective at the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Art, as the kind of artist who really grabs the viewer with the force of his 
expressive painting. 
</P>
<P>
I agreed that Bacon's work is powerful stuff, but I said I wouldn't rush to 
embrace a 23-year-old fresh out of art school who painted in the same way. Why? 
Well, Bacon, who was born in 1909 and began painting in the 1930s, is part of 
the generation that gave birth to Existentialism. But that philosophy is no 
longer current, any more than wearing sandals and black stockings or having 
coffeehouse discussions about banning the bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Today's exciting young artists respond to the social and intellectual currents 
in the air today. It's the same in any field. Why don't they make movies like 
they used to, people always want to know. Why did popular music ever forsake 
the Big Band era? What happened to rock after the '60s? But, like it or not, 
life is different today, and our art forms respond to that difference. 
</P>
<P>
Another woman said she felt that my talk -- which included squawks about the 
dullness and low level of the local gallery scene -- was too negative. She 
wanted to hear what people in Orange County could do to help make the art scene 
more sophisticated and well-informed. It was a good question, and I 
unfortunately gave it short shrift. 
</P>
<P>
"Support your local museums!" I said off the top of my head. I suggested 
visiting top Los Angeles galleries as well as museums to get an idea of the 
range of good contemporary art. I could have added becoming more involved with 
community art centers and trying to "infiltrate" the ranks of stodgy boards of 
trustees. 
</P>
<P>
When you're confused or just need information, ask questions of curators 
(museum support groups provide access) and art dealers. Develop opinions. Worry 
less about what your friends think. What do you think? 
</P>
<P>
My most uncomfortable moment came when someone asked me what I collect. It was 
a perfectly reasonable question. It's just that I don't collect art. "I collect 
books," I murmured. It's true. I own hundreds of volumes: fiction, biography, 
books on art and dance. But I go home and feel perfectly content to see nothing 
but light and shadow making their mark on the white walls of my tiny vintage 
house. 
</P>
<P>
I said I could imagine inviting artists to do site-specific installations on a 
rotating basis, had I any space to spare. I said some critics deliberately 
don't collect in any field of art about which they write, for 
conflict-of-interest reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, excuses, excuses. Well, I love music but I also like to spend hours at home 
with the stereo off, just vaguely aware of the sounds of domestic life: the 
rustle of trees, the muffled sounds of kids playing ball, the hum of the 
refrigerator. Maybe not owning any art to speak of is a form of visual R&amp;R. 
You tell me.

<P>
The Orange County Center for Contemporary Art, an artists' cooperative founded 
in 1980, has hired its first full-time paid administrator. Anne Mattola, an 
artist facilitator with the Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego for the 
past three years, will do community outreach and development work for the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
Her salary will be paid in part by a $10,000 grant from the city of Santa Ana, 
awarded last year for the administration of a visual art education program in 
city schools. The program will involve field trips, artist talks and in-school 
workshops. 
</P>
<P>
Mattola received her bachelor's degree in fine arts from the Rhode Island 
School of Design. She begins her new job June 1. 
</P>
<P>
OCCCA has also appointed a new 12-member board of directors, drawn primarily 
from the business community. Board chairman is Richard Fair of Laguna Beach, 
owner of Encore Advertising in Long Beach. Vice chairman Bernard Simon is an 
accountant with Worth &amp; Co. in Orange. Kathleen Kaplan, an OCCCA affiliate 
artist, has been appointed secretary, and the treasurer is artist Diana 
Frawley. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the board members are artists who will act as liaisons among the 
membership, board and staff, which also includes nine unpaid members who choose 
and schedule exhibitions. Three board positions remain to be filled with more 
business community members. For more information, call (714) 549-4989. CATHY

SOFTWARE'S HOT PROSPECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the 1967 film "The Graduate" were remade today, the famous line about 
plastics being the future probably would be replaced with a line about 
software. Only it wouldn't be a joke. 
</P>
<P>
Money managers generally agree that computer software companies are going to be 
the best high-tech stocks to own in the 1990s. That was re-emphasized last week 
at the 18th annual Hambrecht &amp; Quist high-tech stock conference in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
As computer hardware gets cheaper and cheaper, more computing power is ending 
up on more desks -- and factory lines -- around the world every day. 
</P>
<P>
And unlike the hardware field, which has become more of a commodity business, 
software is much more of a value-added business: We're using computers in so 
many new ways that writing software to meet those specialized needs often is 
more art than science. So customers don't easily abandon a supplier. "Once 
people get into a software system, they tend to become entrenched, so the 
business continues for the supplier," notes Dan Leonard, manager of Financial 
Programs Technology stock mutual fund in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Still, software stocks hardly are immune to problems. Look at Torrance-based 
Ashton-Tate, a high flier until it found bugs in its dBase IV database 
management software last year. The replacement costs have put the firm in the 
red. CEO Edward Esber quit last week. The stock has plunged to $11 from $24 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
A software investor "has to look very carefully at the potential size of a 
firm's market, how saturated the market is, the key players and how strong the 
firm's distribution network is," said David Bayer, analyst at Montgomery 
Securities in San Francisco. While he agrees that software overall holds great 
promise, you have to closely monitor any software company you own, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Personal computer software king Microsoft is one of few stocks that Bayer says 
is a "buy-it-and-forget-about-it" long-term holding. But he also sees value in 
stocks such as Aldus (desktop publishing software) and Lotus, another PC 
software giant. 
</P>
<P>
If you're a PC buff, you're ahead of other investors because you have a better 
feel for software trends. Otherwise, Bayer suggests that a good way to play 
software is via a mutual fund specializing in tech. Some good performers in 
recent years include Leonard's fund, T. Rowe Price's Science &amp; Technology 
Fund (Baltimore) and Franklin Dynatech Fund (San Mateo).

* P-E: stock price-to-earnings ratio based on 1990 calendar year estimated 
earnings per share (Hambrecht &amp; Quist Inc. estimates) 
</P>
<P>
Low Tech, High Profit? A few non-tech firms made presentations at the H&amp;Q 
conference last week. One was Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream. The firm made a big 
impression on 500 money managers with free samples of its new American Dream 
line. 
</P>
<P>
American Dream is a cholesterol-free, 98%-fat-free ice cream. The taste is 
sensational. The only question is how much American Dream will cannibalize 
Dreyer's other lines, such as its frozen yogurt. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Dirvin, analyst at William Blair &amp; Co. in Chicago, estimates that 
40% of Dream sales will come at the expense of Dreyer's other lines. Even so, 
she said, Dreyer's has so much going for it that "my confidence in their 
earnings (power) is very high." 
</P>
<P>
Oakland-based Dreyer's makes money off more than just its own ice cream. Its 
distribution network also is a major plus. Over the past year, Dreyer's bought 
the New York City distribution rights for Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream and the 
Dove International (Dove Bar) distribution rights in Chicago. In August, 
Dreyer's will begin shipping products to Japan for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
H&amp;Q analyst Joe Arsenio sees revenue reaching $280 million this year and 
says Dreyer's will enjoy "an embarrassment of riches" in 1990 from its 
marketing coups. Dirvin agrees, and she estimates that earnings per share will 
reach $1.65 this year (versus $1.38 last year) and $2 next year. What's more, 
she said, the company "learned a lot" from distribution snafus in the late 
1980s that hurt earnings and kicked the stock down. 
</P>
<P>
At $34.75 on Friday, Dreyer's stock is at an all-time high. The company's goal 
is to grow earnings 25% a year. Though any bet you make at the current lofty 
stock price better be for the long term, Dirvin says, Dreyer's is a 
high-quality way to profit from the world's unending love affair with ice 
cream.

Soviets Importing U.S. Chickens: The Soviet Union began buying American-grown 
broilers last fall for the first time in years, the Agriculture Department 
reported, and looks likely to edge out Japan this year as the leading 
chicken-export market for U.S. producers. While 1989 sales involved only about 
26 million pounds, Moscow has bought about 260 million pounds so far this year, 
which the department valued at more than $100 million.

MGM/UA Sued Over Movie Distribution: MGM/United Artist Pictures Inc. was sued 
in Los Angeles Superior Court for allegedly failing to use its "best efforts" 
to distribute the film "Mind Games" in the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed by MTA/Persik Productions and MTA Productions Inc., claims 
MGM/UA bought the distribution rights but never intended to diligently promote 
the movie. The suit seeks more than $2.6 million, claiming MGM/UA has a 
"pattern" of not properly promoting some films because it is contractually 
obliged to give movies to CBS/Fox Co. for release as home videocassettes.

Heir Sues Lawyers for Representing Mother: Oil heir Howard B. Keck Jr., scion 
of an eminent philanthropic family, filed a malpractice suit against his 
lawyers, claiming their representation of his mother in her divorce is likely 
to dilute his expected inheritance. The Los Angeles Superior Court suit stems 
from the divorce battle of Elizabeth Avery Keck and Howard B. Keck Sr., whose 
father founded Superior Oil Co. 
</P>
<P>
The suit seeks unspecified damages because the Los Angeles firm of Trope &amp; 
Trope, in representing Mrs. Keck, allegedly used "confidential information" it 
learned while representing Keck's son for 20 years. The younger Keck says his 
inheritance could be reduced if his mother prevails in her divorce battle. The 
firm denies a conflict of interest. (Filed April 30, 1990. Case No. C759915)

The Resolution Trust Corp. announced that the following actions were taken 
Friday: 
</P>
<P>
* Arrowhead Pacific Federal Savings Bank of San Bernardino was closed and 
insured depositors will be paid off. Arrowhead Pacific had deposits of about 
$89.8 million in 6,500 deposit accounts, virtually all of which are within the 
$100,000 federal insurance limit. 
</P>
<P>
* The insured deposits of Security Federal Savings Assn. of Garden Grove were 
transferred to ITT Federal Bank of Irvine. The failed S&amp;L's only office

million and liabilities of $71.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
* The RTC board approved paying off insured depositors in Los Angeles-based 
American Interstate Savings Assn. because no acceptable bids to buy the thrift

deposits of about $20.5 million, was closed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
* The sale of Sierra Savings &amp; Loan Assn. to Sun Savings Bank, both of 
Beverly Hills, was approved. Sun Savings, a newly chartered federal savings 
bank, is assuming all deposits and secured liabilities of Sierra, which total 
about $36.7 million. The former Sierra Savings branches will reopen today. 
</P>
<P>

TRAVELING ABOUT THE PACIFIC RIM SHOWS CHANGES IN THE WORKS 
</P>

<P>
Australia is bidding g'bye to its immensely popular advertising campaign 
featuring actor Paul Hogan ("Toss another shrimp on the barbie") this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Australian Tourist Commission is yielding to a request by the actor to stop 
the 6-year-old campaign. Hogan did the commercials for free and went on to 
greater fame with Crocodile Dundee. He's tired of the repeated use of the first 
commercial he did for Australia in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign, which helped put Australia on the tourist map, will be a tough 
act to follow, especially now that Australia is battling back from a drop in 
tourism in 1989. The number of visitors to Australia fell to 2 million in 1989 
from 2.25 million the year before, A. J. Thirwell, managing director of the 
Australian Tourist Commission, told the recent Pacific Asia Travel Assn. in 
Vancouver. Revenue from tourism -- Australia's No. 1 export earner -- fell to 
about $4.6 billion ($6.1 billion Australian) from about $5 billion ($6.5 
billion Australian) in 1988. Thirwell attributed the drop to a number of 
factors, especially a disruptive five-month strike by pilots of domestic 
Australian carriers. 
</P>
<P>
Australian Greg Norman, who is ranked among the world's top golfers, has 
offered to stand in for Hogan, but the commission hasn't taken him up on the 
offer. Meanwhile, Australia is stepping up marketing efforts in Asia. In 1989, 
the biggest increases came in visitors from Japan and other parts of Asia, 
while the number of tourists from the United States and Europe fell. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Qantas to Drop Some Routes, Add Others 
</P>
<P>
Qantas, Australia's national airline, will drop four unprofitable routes later 
this year to focus on Asia, which the carrier believes will become a major 
source of tourists for the country. 
</P>
<P>
"We are taking our resources from one part of the planet and putting them in 
another, much more profitable part of the planet," said Rodger Robertson, 
director of corporate planning for Qantas. 
</P>
<P>
By this fall, Qantas plans to stop flying to Amsterdam, Athens, Bombay and 
Bahrain. "These places are losing us money, and there's very little prospect of 
them becoming profitable," Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson said that by 2000 Asia would be Australia's major source of tourists, 
with 2.4 million Asians entering the country annually, compared to 1.4 million 
tourists from Britain and Europe and 800,000 from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Europe and Britain are Australia's biggest source of tourists, 
followed by New Zealand. "Asian tourism will grow much faster than everywhere 
else," Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson said Qantas will add an extra four or five flights a week to Japan, a 
couple of extra flights to Singapore and Bangkok and establish one flight a 
week to South Korea. He said Qantas also hoped to start flying to Taiwan under 
a new subsidiary carrier Australia-Asia Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tourism Industry Caters to 'Greenies' 
</P>
<P>
Environmental "greenies" take note: The tourist industry says it is mindful of 
its environmental responsibilities, from preserving the rain forests of 
Indonesia to concerns about the effect of exhaust from bigger aircraft on the 
ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the green decade," said Larry Helber, president of Helber Hastert &amp; 
Kimura Planners of Honolulu. "We have to show that tourism is a friend of the 
greenies, the environmentalists." He said it is commonplace in Hawaii now for 
project proposals that require zoning changes to take five to seven years to 
receive approvals. "That's the real world." 
</P>
<P>
Preservation of the environment will be an issue comparable to earlier efforts 
to preserve and save the culture and heritage of other areas previously 
developed, tourist operators say. "Environmentally safe tours," explained J. 
Patrick Clark Jr., president of Jetabout North America in Los Angeles, would 
take people to areas that are promoted as preserving the environment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Japanese Media Skip Travel Conference 
</P>
<P>
Considering that a record 10 million Japanese tourists are expected to travel 
worldwide this year, the Japanese media were curiously absent from the recent 
Vancouver gathering of the Pacific Asia Travel Assn. "It's distressing to me; 
it's the first time in 10 years we've only had one from Japan," said Graham 
Hornel, PATA's director of communication. He also noted it was the first time 
that PATA did not pick up the tab for the media. 
</P>
<P>
Kiyomi Suzuki from the trade weekly Travel Journal was the sole Japanese 
reporter present. His boss, publisher Jim T. Moritani, attributed the no-shows 
to the fact that the conference was in English and to a general "lack of 
internationalization and awareness" on the part of the Japanese. "It's kind of 
a demerit on the Japanese as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
South Korea Travel Is a Two-Way Street 
</P>
<P>
The lifting of all travel restrictions by the South Korean government led to an 
explosive 67.3% increase -- to 1.2 million -- in Koreans venturing abroad in 
1989. Meanwhile, 2.6 million foreigners visited South Korea in 1989, up 16.6% 
from the year before, according to Cho Young-Kil, president of Korea National 
Tourism Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors from Japan accounted for about 50% for the inbound tourists, followed 
by the United States with about 13%. Half of the Korean travelers visited Japan 
in 1989, while about 15% visited the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Cho expects that 1.5 million Korean citizens will travel abroad, while 3 
million foreigners will visit South Korea this year. Through February, the 
number of outbound tourists was up 40.2%, while the number of visitors were up 
9.5%, Cho said. NANCY YOSHIHARA

MAKE SURE INVESTMENT IS SOLID AND NOT MERELY A FAD; 
</P>
<P>
WALL STREET: THE FINANCIAL LANDSCAPE IS LITTERED WITH PRODUCTS THAT WERE ONCE 
TRENDY. THE TRICK IS TO FIND THOSE WITH LONG-TERM VIABILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
They are the financial equivalent of the Hula-Hoop or the pet rock -- 
investments that capture the hearts and pocketbooks of the masses before fading 
into relative obscurity. Let's call them fads. 
</P>
<P>
From the birth control boom in the early 1960s to today's "green" investments, 
the financial landscape is frequently littered with products that cater to the 
latest social or economic trends. 
</P>
<P>
But fads are risky. Investors sometimes can reap double-digit returns in just a 
matter of months. Fads can just as easily slide into oblivion overnight, 
leaving investors holding securities worth a fraction of yesterday's value. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is finding out what is a fad and what is a popular investment that 
has long-term viability," said James S. Riepe, managing director of T. Rowe 
Price, a big mutual fund company. "If you happen to pick the fad, it goes down 
and it never comes back up. You bought the company that made the pet rock and 
there was no encore." 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1960s, for example, rumors surfaced that the Catholic Church was 
planning to curb its stand against birth control. Companies manufacturing birth 
control pills and other reproductive planning devices enjoyed a dramatic, 
short-lived rally on Wall Street. But the balloon burst when the Pope failed to 
deliver the prescribed message. 
</P>
<P>
Decades later, when the AIDS epidemic was young, stock in a few biotechnology 
companies soared briefly because the firms promised to bring out drugs that 
could treat the deadly virus. The medications were never proven effective and 
most of the companies faded; some declared bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Even when an investment's success does not depend on just one event or product, 
individuals should consider whether bullish sentiment has pushed the 
investment's price as high as it will go, Riepe said. "If you are buying after 
something has happened, you have to realize that this investment may be at its 
peak." 
</P>
<P>
Mutual funds that invest in a single country are one such example. Some of 
these "country funds" may be great investments over the long haul because the 
prospects for that nation's economy and business growth are bright. But because 
of investor reactions to world events, such as the expected reunification of 
Germany, some country funds became "faddish," or popular to a degree that was 
completely out of proportion to the underlying economics of the investment. 
</P>
<P>
"It became a feeding frenzy," said Penny Dobkin, manager of the Fidelity Europe 
Fund and the Fidelity Plymouth Fund in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The proof: the price relationship between the funds' asset values and their 
market prices, Riepe said. (Many single country funds are "closed-end" mutual 
funds, which issue only a limited number of shares and typically trade on the 
New York Stock Exchange.)

When the Eastern Bloc was in the news every day and the reunification of 
Germany became probable, prices of German funds soared. By January, the Germany 
Fund, which had been selling at a discount to its net asset value, rocketed to 
$19.25 a share -- more than 50% above what its assets were worth. Then, 
abruptly, the fad faded and shares of the Germany Fund fell into the $13 range 
until last week's country-fund rally boosted the price to $15.875 by Friday's 
close. 
</P>
<P>
Dobkin believes that the long-term prospects for Germany's economy are as good 
as they were in January. But investors need to ignore the effects of the fad 
and put their securities away for a few years if they hope to profit, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The same thing happened with Korea Fund, which was selling for twice its asset 
value last September, Riepe noted. Although the Korean economy is promising, at 
those rates it would take at least four to five years for asset values to catch 
up to market prices. Market prices have since ebbed, and the Korea Fund closed 
at $21.625 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But country funds are not the only fad in the investment world. More recently, 
investors started to flock to so-called green companies -- those that hope to 
profit by helping to clean up the environment or make environmentally safe 
products. Fidelity Investments, for example, introduced an environmental 
services mutual fund last June. Within a year, investors had poured more than 
$100 million into the fund. 
</P>
<P>
Although a spokeswoman for Fidelity calls the environment the "issue of the 
decade," some believe environmental investing will go the way of bell bottom 
jeans and "flower power." 
</P>
<P>
"There is a real question about whether investing in companies that are 
involved in protecting the environment will survive as an investment segment," 
said Riepe. "It is a very narrow segment. . . . There are so few companies 
involved that you might as well just buy five of those stocks."

CRIME: BRAD POWERS JR. AND HIS DAD SHARED A PRIVATE WORLD OF LOVE AND RAGE. 
WHEN IT DISSOLVED, 2 INNOCENT PEOPLE DIED.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So great was his love for his father that Brad Powers Jr. -- twisted, confused, 
and consumed with vodka and grief -- sought to avenge his anguish with 
bloodshed on Easter weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Gun drawn, he stalked into the Mission Bay Memorial Hospital emergency room, 
where his father had died just hours earlier. He chose a place of healing for a 
scene of revenge, killing two hospital workers and wounding two other people, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
"Those two days were the most traumatic, horrible experience I ever had in my 
life, the way they did my father wrong," Brad Powers Jr. said, sitting in jail, 
still convinced the hospital had improperly cared for his father, Brad Powers 
Sr., 75, a nationally known architectural illustrator. "I loved my father, 
that's what's on my mind now. It's a horrible, horrible tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
In his grief, Brad cannot see how, in seeking an outlet for his rage, he has 
spread pain and anguish in a widening circle. 
</P>
<P>
"It's devastating -- I can hardly talk or read," said Florence Burke, the 
mother of Deborah Kay Burke, a nurse killed in the rampage. "The loss can't be 
measured. It's so total and unbearable, and it doesn't go away with her 
burial." 
</P>
<P>
For 46 years, the lives of Brad Powers Jr. and his father had been bound 
together. Brad had never held a job; he lived with his parents at home and 
leaned on his father to raise his own two children. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, sometimes in fits of anger, he would turn on his father and strike him. 
Neighbors along Castle Hills Drive remember police cars parked outside the 
Powers' front gate. Once, the elder Powers tried to commit his son for mental 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
But the family held strong. His parents paid for Brad's divorce and custody 
battle, and even coached him on what to say in court. 
</P>
<P>
During a brief stint in the Coast Guard, he fell from a ladder and injured his 
back. A doctor prescribed a painkiller that had a lasting effect on Brad and 
made him sometimes act strangely, his mother said. Although unable to recall 
the name of the drug, Brad said he has disliked doctors ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Even today, although admitting to the shooting rampage, Brad does not believe 
it was truly his fault. He was drunk, he said -- although police say tests show 
he was not. He still blames the hospital and said he is sure people will 
understand his actions once they learn the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"What the hospital did was murder," he said. "If the hospital hadn't been 
negligent, if they cared for my father the way they should have, this whole 
damn tragedy never would have taken place." 
</P>
<P>
The Powers family lived in an ocean-view home on La Jolla's Mt. Soledad, with 
five dogs and 12 cats. Brad handled the household chores. His father sketched 
in the small, cluttered studio next to the swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a family that was a good team," Brad said, adding that his father, 
"was just the most wonderful man a son could have. We shared every day 
together, for years and years and years." 
</P>
<P>
But all was not well inside that home. 
</P>
<P>
The "good team" did not include Brad's brother, Charles Powers, 51, an 
assistant vice chancellor for design at UC Irvine. He says he has been 
estranged from his brother and mother for 25 years. He declined to explain 
further. 
</P>
<P>
The Powers were a proud family, and a private one. And not many neighbors, 
friends or even Charles Powers really ever knew all that went on inside the 
gracious home, carefully hidden from the road by trees and shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Powers had come to Southern California in the 1920s when he was 9 
years old, after his father, stricken with polio, had tired of slipping on 
Chicago's icy sidewalks. By the 1930s, he had his first illustrating job, 
painting color posters for movies playing at the Fox theater. He drew Boris 
Karloff as the Frankenstein monster and actor Leo Carillo as a bandit. He 
parlayed that work, at 19, into a job as an architectural illustrator and drew 
renderings for some prestigious projects. 
</P>
<P>
He worked on some San Diego landmarks: the County Administration Center, the 
Civic Theatre, the Westgate Hotel. By the 1950s and '60s, he had earned a 
national reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy making something that's needed beautiful," he once said of his work, 
"rather than making it ugly." 
</P>
<P>
He spent many days in his studio, which was entered through two sliding glass 
doors. The studio walls were covered with rough pencil sketches and drawings. 
His 106-year-old desk once belonged to his grandfather. The lingering smell of 
smoke from his pipe wafted throughout the house. 
</P>
<P>
"He had this Norman Rockwellian way about him," said Jonathan Finfer, a San 
Diego architect who, three years ago, organized an art exhibit highlighting 
Powers' work. "He had this high-pitched laugh. You would just roll back and 
laugh with him, and then you could see he was in ill health. He would cough for 
15 seconds when he told his stories, and all you could think of was, 'Get some 
help.' " 
</P>
<P>
The elder Powers often was treated at Mission Bay hospital, where he was such a 
regular that he referred to the nursing staff as "my girls." He would walk into 
the emergency room, and, without even checking in, hook himself to the machine 
that evaluated his weak pulmonary condition. 
</P>
<P>
A month before his death, Powers filled out a "Star Card," praising the 
hospital emergency room. "Emphysema sometimes brings me here feeling as if I 
have one foot in the grave," he wrote. After being treated, "I go out back to 
my flamenco dancing again." 
</P>
<P>
As his father grew weaker, Brad grew more and more responsible for running the 
small household. He shopped and cooked, maintained the pool and tended the 
family menagerie. 
</P>
<P>
"I carried the load of the household, I kept the place running," he said. "I am 
a pretty responsible fellow. Just because you are not working a particular job 
doesn't mean you are not working." 
</P>
<P>
His mother, friends and neighbors describe this gentle side. "I have never seen 
Brad Jr. when he was anything but a considerate, thoughtful, good neighbor," 
said Beatrice England, who has known the Powers family for more than 25 years. 
"In any dealings I had with him, he has been very polite and friendly." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Powers, 73, says her son was a "very sweet little boy who was very 
bright." He worked hard on the family boat and soon became an able sailor who 
was well-liked by his peers, she said: "He had friends all over. I know Brad 
does not have anything mentally wrong." 
</P>
<P>
His father had designed the main clubhouse at the Mission Bay Yacht Club, where 
his son first learned to sail, winning teen-age trophies. "He was real active 
and real handsome, and the girls all had crushes on him," said a club official. 
</P>
<P>
Six feet tall, with blond-brown hair and blue eyes, Brad has a boyish face and 
an athletic build that makes him look younger than his age. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the sweetest, nicest guy you could hope to meet," said Mary Hayward, 
whom Brad escorted to the senior prom. She had not seen him after graduation 
until she visited him recently in jail. "He's so sensitive," she said. "I just 
think he snapped." 
</P>
<P>
There were earlier emotional problems. When Brad was 21, his father filed a 
petition in San Diego Superior Court. Powers said his son appeared to be 
mentally troubled and took the first steps to commit him. A doctor had told 
them Brad was "in an acute psychotic episode and appears to be on the verge of 
violence," Powers said in the court petition. "He refused to take the 
prescribed medicine. He was admitted to the psychiatric ward as an emergency." 
</P>
<P>
But within five days, Powers had dropped his efforts and withdrawn the 
petition. Asked about this episode, Brad recalled suffering an "emotional 
disturbance from an over-prescribed tranquilizer" that was supposed to ease 
upper back pain. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when I started having bad feelings towards doctors," he said. "That 
caused an emotional disturbance, and it almost killed me. I carried that along 
many, many years. It took me five years to pull out of that thing." 
</P>
<P>
Brad believes he recuperated from that episode. When his four-year marriage to 
Jeanne Evelyn Powers ended in divorce in 1971, court papers made no mention of 
his mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
The court battle over custody of their two children, Warren and Laura, raged 
for years, with Brad's father backing him in countless fights until custody 
finally was awarded to the youngsters' grandparents and father. 
</P>
<P>
Many saw Powers and his wife -- not Brad -- as the driving force in the fight 
over the children. 
</P>
<P>
"Brad was an incredibly weak man with no backbone," said a family attorney, who 
requested anonymity. "He had an excuse for everything he might have ever done 
wrong. Brad was very unhealthy. He was being controlled by his parents, and he 
seemed to regurgitate what they told him to say. He wasn't effective as a human 
being." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors recalled strange events. Dorene Guerrazzi, 22, said she would 
sunbathe in her back yard, only to hear Brad tromp down the hill and offer her 
money for sex. Once, she said, he threw a rock with a $50 bill and a note 
wrapped around it, asking her to "spread her legs." She called police. "He just 
seemed strange," she said. "He seemed lonely." 
</P>
<P>
He also sometimes physically abused his father. 
</P>
<P>
"There were only two or three occasions, and they were extremely mild," Brad 
said. "I never hit him, it was a slap here and there -- like fathers and sons 
do. It was a minor thing really, that was all it was. On one occasion, I went 
overboard and he had me arrested." 
</P>
<P>
But after his death, a family member asked that coroners investigate to 
ascertain that abuse did not contribute to the elder Powers' demise, said Dr. 
H.E. Hammerstead, the surgeon who had operated on him. The coroners' office, 
however, found no evidence of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Brad's mother said her son's spats with his father were not serious. "They had 
disagreements off and on because they loved each other," she said. "They did 
talk back and forth. My husband was always yelling at everybody. (But) my son 
wouldn't touch a flea, he wasn't that type of person. He did disagree with his 
dad, but he loved him. If he hadn't loved him, he wouldn't have spent his life 
taking care of him." 
</P>
<P>
The elder Powers felt tremendous pressure to support the household and 
postponed retirement, said Marvin Mizeur, another lawyer who has known the 
family for 16 years. "It was not a pleasant situation for Brad Sr. for the last 
10 years," said Mizeur. Powers had told him Brad verbally abused him 
constantly, Mizeur said -- a contention the son denies. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a good guy," Brad said. "I never hurt anybody in my life. I never hit 
anyone with a closed fist, never pointed a gun until this horrible, horrible 
incident." 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "you never know, you wake up on a Friday morning, and you never 
know what the day is going to turn out to be like." 
</P>
<P>
Friday, April 13, began like any other day for Brad Powers Jr. 
</P>
<P>
After returning from the grocery store, he learned his father had gone to 
Mission Bay Memorial Hospital. He was not upset. His father was overweight and 
had a history of heart and lung problems. 
</P>
<P>
The senior Powers appeared in the emergency room, complaining of shortness of 
breath. "He was adequately evaluated and treated and released in good 
condition," said Dr. Harry Henderson, the hospital's chief-of-staff-elect. 
</P>
<P>
Powers returned to the emergency room the next morning, complaining of 
abdominal pain. The diagnosis: a ruptured aneurysm. Doctors telephoned Brad at 
home and told him they needed to operate to save his father's life, Henderson 
said. "His attitude was that, 'If you're going to operate on him, don't do it 
until I get there,' " the doctor recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Brad "arrived prior to the surgery and the (lead) surgeon had a chance to 
discuss with him just how serious the situation was," Henderson said. "He was 
very concerned that his father was going to have an operation, but what he 
didn't realize at first was that without an operation his father was going to 
die. And once he realized that, he calmed down." 
</P>
<P>
But during surgery, the elder Powers suffered a heart attack and died, despite 
what doctors said were their every efforts to save him. 
</P>
<P>
Told of his father's death, Brad grew agitated and upset. He screamed that 
doctors had not done enough to save his dad. He was furious that his father had 
been sent home the day before, angry that doctors had gone ahead with the 
surgery, despite his father's frail condition. 
</P>
<P>
Brad went home, the house sadly dark and silent without his father. He drank 
heavily from a large bottle of vodka, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, suddenly, without a word, he grabbed the .22-caliber handgun the family 
kept at home for protection, started the Corvette his parents had bought him 
and drove back to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before 5 p.m., eight hours after his father's death, the staff and 
patients in the emergency room were jolted by a scream, a man yelling: "You 
killed my father!" 
</P>
<P>
The roar of gunfire resounded through the room. 
</P>
<P>
Nurse Deborah Kay Burke and Edward Thomas Rooney, a medical trainee, were 
killed. Fred Mowrer, a patient's father, was shot once in the backside. Dr. 
Michael Hughes -- a physician who just hours before had tried to comfort the 
obviously distraught Brad about his father's death -- was wounded with a spray 
of gunfire, hit possibly five times. 
</P>
<P>
Burke, a vibrant, funny "aerobics-olic" who had been a nurse for 12 years, was 
preparing to take a vacation in Germany with her boyfriend. That Saturday shift 
was one of the few remaining before her trip. Burke, 36, had treated the elder 
Powers during some of his emergency room visits, but hospital officials were 
unsure whether she saw him on the day of his death. 
</P>
<P>
Burke was sitting at the long white nurses' desk when the gunman stormed in. 
She tried to scramble under her chair but was shot once in the chest. Bleeding 
and confused, she ran outside and begged an elderly couple in a car in the 
parking lot to drive her to another hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Bewildered, they pointed back at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Burke ran back inside and collapsed. She died of her wounds two hours later. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney, 30, a student, was three hours into his shift when, police said, Brad 
entered the emergency room. Rooney, engaged to be married in October, had to 
spend eight hours observing doctors and nurses to graduate from an emergency 
medicine course. He was not at the hospital when the elder Powers had been 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney was watching Hughes treat an elderly woman in the three-bed emergency 
room when the gunman entered. After Rooney was shot, he fell to the floor. The 
gunman walked over to him and fired once more, killing him. 
</P>
<P>
Mowrer, a lawyer from Albuquerque, N.M., visiting San Diego that Easter 
weekend, was in the hospital for the first time. He had brought his daughter 
Chelsea, 2, in for treatment for the flu. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't look like a crazy man," Mowrer said of the gunman. "I was looking at 
him and I saw the gun coming up. I turned to avoid him. I didn't even know I 
was shot. I fell to the ground. I had just seen him shoot (Rooney) on the 
ground and thought, 'I am not going to let him do that to me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Mowrer fell. He did not realize he was shot until he saw his green shorts were 
stained red with blood. 
</P>
<P>
Brad, back in his car, fled the scene. He headed north toward Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
"I love Oregon. I have always loved Oregon -- it's beautiful, serene, 
pleasant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But "I realized it was just a matter of time, and they would get me on the 
freeway. I figured if they got me on the highway, they might blow me away." 
</P>
<P>
So, 40 miles from the hospital, he turned off Interstate 5 and stopped at a pay 
phone. He called Oceanside police and confessed. 
</P>
<P>
Today, under $2.5 million bail, Brad faces two charges of murder and three of 
attempted murder. In his jail cell, he said, he has pinned sailing pictures on 
the wall. 
</P>
<P>
He is bitter about the events that put him there. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a damn wonder that things didn't turn out worse than they did. . . . I 
will always feel towards the hospital what I feel now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always loved animals. Animals never turn on you no matter what happens, 
they are totally devoted and dedicated. If only people were more like dogs," he 
says with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Brad said he worried about jeopardizing his legal defense -- a preliminary 
hearing in his case is set for June -- but he agreed to speak to The Times on 
four separate occasions. 
</P>
<P>
Although he said he did not want to discuss his defense, he added: "It was 
temporary insanity. . . . When you go flipping out the way I did there, you 
don't realize that you don't know what you are doing. 
</P>
<P>
"The hospital did my father wrong," he said. "That's why I am in this tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very horrible about the people, the families. I can't bring those 
people back. I can't bring my father back either. 
</P>
<P>
"When these facts come out, there will be plenty of people who can tell what 
kind of person I am. Hopefully, they won't condemn me. Hopefully, they will 
understand a fellow who snapped under the circumstances."

LAW AND PARTY: CELEBRATING 100 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The attorneys at Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, one of the city's oldest and most 
prestigious law firms, took a legal holiday of sorts Friday in order to 
celebrate the company's 100th year in business. 
</P>
<P>
Some 500 attorneys and their clients first mingled at the bar before heading 
into a three-course lunch at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel at which U. S. 
Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Gov. George Deukmejian, California 
Supreme Court Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas and Mayor Tom Bradley each 
commended the milestone. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley presented Norman B. Barker, the firm's executive committee chairman, 
with an official city commendation. 
</P>
<P>
Of the firm's impressive client list, Deukmejian cracked: "In fact, I even 
heard (the firm represents) a leading actress who slapped a policeman in 
Beverly Hills." Later, Bruce A. Toor, a partner at the firm, said that the firm 
did not represent Zsa Zsa Gabor in that instance. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a very impressive feat," remarked O'Connor of the anniversary, after 
being introduced by former U. S. Atty. Gen. William French Smith, now a partner 
at Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
She then reminded the attorneys that when she applied for a position with the 
company in 1952, as a third-year law student at Stanford Law School where she 
was at the top of her class, she received a job offer as a legal secretary. 
</P>
<P>
She was pleased to note that things have changed: Of the 709 lawyers employed 
in 17 offices worldwide by the firm today, 204 are women. 
</P>
<P>
To mark the anniversary, the company has established a $2-million charitable 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, this looks fun for a lawyer's party," said Los Angeles Superior 
Court Judge Diane Wayne, who attended with her husband, L.A. Dist. Atty. Ira 
Reiner. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John Ferraro was also a guest. 
</P>
<P>
Guests ranged from aerospace (Ralph Hawes, senior vice president at General 
Dynamics), film (David Handelman, senior vice president at 20th Century Fox), 
banking (Bram Goldsmith, chief executive officer of City National Bank), food 
(Carl N. Karcher, chairman of Carl Karcher Enterprises, commonly known as the 
Carl's Jr. restaurants), sports (Marjorie L. Everett, chairman of Hollywood 
Park) and the arts (Frederick M. Nicholas, chairman of the Walt Disney Concert 
Hall Committee).

COLLEGE BOUND PROJECT GIVEN ROUSING START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In New York and Kansas City, philanthropists successfully have tested the 
premise that the promise of a college education can keep many children in 
school and out of trouble. Los Angeles soon will try this experiment, too -- 
with a twist. 
</P>
<P>
Project College Bound, a new foundation, hopes to inspire inner city 
seventh-graders with greater educational prospects but it will differ from 
other programs of its ilk because it will seek the support of a variety of 
small donors, not just the wealthy, according to organizer Ophelia Long. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles effort also will enlist the city's entertainment and business 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
The project got under way Saturday night with a Wiltern Theater benefit, 
underwritten by the International Society on Hypertension in Blacks. The 
society, which conducted its fifth annual conference this weekend in Long 
Beach, underwrote Project College Bound with $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
The program will require participants to sign a pledge to stay off drugs and 
away from gangs and to avoid pregnancy or impregnating someone, said Long, a 
hospital administrator with Kaiser Permanente and a charter society member who 
helped organize the benefit. In exchange, the program will pay for students' 
college tuition and "any mentoring or tutoring they may need and expose them to 
cultural experiences." 
</P>
<P>
The weekend benefit featured a silent auction followed by a show with 
performances by actors Marla Gibbs, James Earl Jones, and Cleavon Little; 
stand-up comedy from Byron Allen; and music by Freda Payne and Peter Yarrow of 
Peter Paul &amp; Mary. The Ambassadors of Compton, a singing and dancing youth 
group, performed, as did the D.A.R.E. Up With Life singers.

THEY ENJOYED BEING LEFT IN LIMBO

<TEXT>
<P>
When the Spinsters started doing the limbo, their 64th annual ball became a 
very, very good party. 
</P>
<P>
It was just past midnight Friday at the Beverly Hilton when the calypso-themed 
gala shifted into high gear. 
</P>
<P>
The steel band was blasting, twentysomething men in white-tie and dexterous, 
intrepid women in strapless gowns were navigating their way under the limbo 
pol. Then the party let loose with the energy expected on a Caribbean cruise 
where passengers hijack the Love Boat. 
</P>
<P>
The night began in leisurely fashion with cocktails at 8, dinner at 10-ish. It 
picked up steam at 11 when two male Caribbean dancer-acrobats bounced across 
the floor. 
</P>
<P>
They were followed by a fire-eater/juggler who left in his wake a cloud reeking 
of lighter fluid; maybe it was this haze of petroleum distillates that 
enlivened the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the three, feather-plumed female dancers had brought the mood of 
Brazilian (via Las Vegas) Mardigras to the room, the 600-strong crowd was 
primed to dance. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted something lively," said understated Betsy Ross, who with Victoria 
Eastus and Melinda Pfenning had put together the ball. (Angelica Kusar is the 
group's president.) 
</P>
<P>
Why was the event's liveliness so remarkable? The Spinsters are old-line, 
traditional group. They're young, working, single women who could be called 
Debs Who Don't Marry . . . Yet. Or in the words of committee member Kimberly 
Wilder, "It's like a sorority after college. Call us 'Debs With Careers.' " 
</P>
<P>
But they managed the difficult task of keeping a party begun in 1926 in tune 
with both tradition and the times. And as the dancing went on until 2 a.m., one 
wondered why they would ever want to marry and stop being Spinsters.

EVOLUTION OF AN ENTERTAINER

Could it be h i m? 
</P>
<P>
Gasps of anticipation were heard in the Summit arena here as a man in bright 
yellow Dick Tracy overcoat and hat stepped from the shadows to join Madonna on 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
Could it be Warren Beatty, the star of the upcoming movie about the famous 
comic book detective . . . the man who has been reported for months to be 
Madonna's beau? 
</P>
<P>
After all, this was the opening night of the 12-city U.S. leg of Madonna's 
lavishly designed "Blond Ambition" tour, and the singer-dancer, who plays 
Breathless Mahoney in the film, is better at capitalizing on the moment than 
anyone in pop music. 
</P>
<P>
Madonna was on MTV so much over the weekend that you'd think she was holding 
the cable channel hostage -- and her show 'n' tell escapade with Arsenio Hall 
last week may have been the most electric hour of TV since the debut of "Twin 
Peaks." 
</P>
<P>
Beatty may yet slip into the overcoat and hat on the tour -- maybe even at the 
Los Angeles Sports Arena, where the tour begins a five-night engagement on 
Friday. The Summit audience, however, had to settle just for Beatty's recorded 
voice. The man in the Tracy outfit last Friday was part of Madonna's cast, and 
he merely danced with her as a tape played a Madonna-Beatty duet from her 
upcoming album, which includes songs from the film. 
</P>
<P>
But the buzz in the arena sparked by the possibility of Beatty's presence, 
however, underscored the way Madonna's personal life has become so entwined 
with her professional life. 
</P>
<P>
More than just a star or a performer, Madonna -- in the style of Elvis Presley 
and Michael Jackson -- is above all a Celebrity. The highlight of the show for 
many in the audience is when she walks on stage -- when they have a chance to 
see her in person. 
</P>
<P>
That's what makes Madonna's lastest single, "Vogue," such a terrific piece of 
pop. The record and accompanying video are marvelous expressions of the 
narcissism associated with pop celebrities -- works that mock Madonna's own 
celebrity status while saluting glamour icons from the past. 
</P>
<P>
Sample lines: 
</P>
<P>
 They had style, they had grace 
</P>
<P>
 Rita Hayworth gave good face. 
</P>
<P>
 Lauren, Katharine, Lana, too 
</P>
<P>
 Bette Davis, we love you. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Strike a pose 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing to it. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, Madonna's enormous success is based on her ability to strike the 
best poses. She comes up with a new image and look for every magazine cover, 
not to mention every video. 
</P>
<P>
That continuing preoccupation with appearence can be annoying. But the 
impressive thing about the "Blond Ambition" tour is that the 
singer-actress-dancer doesn't simply rest on celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
Much like Michael and Janet Jackson, Madonna sacrifices the spontaneity of the 
normal rock concert experience for the more carefully choreographed and formal 
presentation of the Broadway theater. 
</P>
<P>
Despite an endless array of costume changes (Madonna doesn't go on the road to 
press the flesh, but to bare it) and a cast of seven male dancers (also 
sometimes outfitted with items from her lingerie closet) and two female back-up 
singers, the most striking thing about the Summit show was how the one-time 
"boy toy" has evolved into such an accomplished entertainer. 
</P>
<P>
The "Blond Ambition" show is even structured with theatrical acts. Act I begins 
with a scene of industrial dreariness, reminiscent of the film "Metropolis." 
The seven bare-chested dancers look like workmen, drained of energy and 
personality. But they come alive as the opening songs, including "Express 
Yourself" and "Where's the Party," invite the audience to forget the day's 
frustrations. 
</P>
<P>
Act II touches on sex and salvation, a familiar pop theme. Madonna -- her hair 
in a severely drawn ponytail throughout show -- moves from the sexual fantasies 
of "Like a Virgin" through the questions of religion and guilt reflected in 
"Like a Prayer." 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood is the backdrop of Act III, which focuses on songs from the upcoming 
album and a good-natured, beauty parlor staging of "Material Girl" inspired by 
'50s movie musicals. The formal part of the show ends, appropriately, with 
"Vogue." 
</P>
<P>
Where Madonna's music is often criticized, quite justifiably, for lacking the 
substance and imagination of pop's most compelling figures, there is an 
uplifting edge to her performance. 
</P>
<P>
Her energy and accomplishments stand as symbols of the ability of one to make 
the most of one's opportunities and talents. She has long seemed blessed with 
blond ambition, but it has never been blind ambition.

UNCOMPROMISING WORK BY JOFFREY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cultural reclamation at its most enlightened, the Joffrey Ballet's Diaghilev 
program has always been important for both its renewal of early 20th Century 
masterworks and for making the company itself indispensable to contemporary 
dance. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, however, the program has evolved from naive celebrations of 
Leonide Massine to a survey of the roles danced by Vaslav Nijinsky and on to 
the current fascination with the choreography of both Nijinsky and his sister, 
Bronislava Nijinska. 
</P>
<P>
Adding Nijinska's "Les Noces" (1923) to Nijinsky's "L'Apres-midi d'un Faune" 
(1912) and "Le Sacre du Printemps" (1913) -- as the company did at the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion on Friday -- raises profound questions about the meaning of 
classicism, virtuosity and our own rather diminished expectations at most 
ballet performances. 
</P>
<P>
Set to yet another of Igor Stravinsky's groundbreaking scores, "Les Noces" 
looks at the social rituals and relationships of a Russian peasant wedding 
through a hyper-mechanized sensibility -- as if the subject were a factory. 
</P>
<P>
Braiding is a major theme, with the bride's hair stretched across the entire 
stage -- and with various groups weaving themselves into impenetrable 
architectural masses. There are also Nijinsky resemblances galore: intense 
group jumps-in-place, with the feet tucked up, straight from "Sacre," as well 
as the concept of individuals cruelly isolated from the social order they 
perpetuate. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Nijinska both validated and extended her brother's controversial 
innovations, and "Les Noces" presents them at their most uncompromising. 
Spectacular group dancing is the attraction here, but Julie Janus (the Bride) 
and Daniel Baudendistel (the Groom) make effective Chosen Ones while Deborah 
Dawn and Joseph Schnell nearly dance themselves to death as their friends. 
</P>
<P>
Irina Nijinska (the choreographer's daughter) and Howard Sayette have staged 
the work with meticulous regard for its astonishing rhythmic force, and the 
original designs by Natalia Goncharova have been carefully reproduced under the 
supervision of John C. Gilkerson. Finally, a phalanx of pianists, vocal 
soloists and choristers (members of the Los Angeles Master Chorale) give 
Stravinsky equal care. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, under Allan Lewis, the score sounds far more powerful than the reduced 
orchestration of the mighty "Sacre" adopted for reasons of economy. However, 
the "Sacre" dancing is always a wonder, with Beatriz Rodriguez more than ever 
brilliant at defining layers of pain and terror in the final solo. In "Faune," 
Tyler Walters offers an intelligent, boldly projected performance of the 
Nijinsky role without ever yielding to the impulse behind the movement. John 
Miner conducts. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, company artistic director Gerald Arpino abruptly resigned and 
prohibited the company from dancing his ballets as of May 4. On Saturday, 
however, two familiar Arpino works graced the Joffrey program -- and executive 
director Penelope Curry said "we're performing the dances with his permission," 
though she declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
The woozy "Round of Angels" (to Mahler) found Valerie Madonia and Baudendistel 
newly cast as the central couple -- each of them accomplished but not yet as 
free as their predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
The rock platitudes of "Trinity" (music by Alan Ralph and Lee Holdridge) 
inspired a blazing performance from Edward Stierle, a classy one from Jodie 
Gates and an unexpectedly playful one from Edward Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
Due to the knee injury of Tom Mossbrucker, the previously reviewed "La 
Vivandiere" Pas de Six replaced Arpino's "L'Air d'Esprit," and Douglas Martin 
danced the title role in Eugene Loring's "Billy the Kid" a day earlier than 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Danced at heroic scale, Martin's moody interpretation of Billy had plenty of 
magnetism and a ruthless efficiency in killing -- but not much of a sardonic 
edge. Walters made a convincing Garett, but Gates looked labored and all too 
corporeal as the dream-sweetheart. Miner conducted the much-loved Copland score 
capably.

MOZARTEAN PLAYERS CONCLUDE DOHENY SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The current season of Doheny Mansion soirees ended on Friday with a delectable 
program by the Mozartean Players: pianist Steven Lubin, violinist Stanley 
Ritchie and cellist Myron Lutzke, as highly accomplished practitioners of 
18th-Century style on instruments of the time. 
</P>
<P>
Together, they are all that could be desired of a chamber ensemble: balanced 
and cohesive in sound, temperament and interpretive outlook, and technically 
secure, notwithstanding some dicey moments on Friday at the outset of Mozart's 
seraphic Trio in B-flat, K. 502, when Lubin, reportedly suffering painful back 
spasms, gave every indication of not being able to make it through the evening. 
</P>
<P>
The pianist had, however, sufficiently recovered by Mozart's finale to make a 
substantial contribution to the pleasures of a program that if delivered by, 
say, the modern-instrument Beaux Arts Trio, would have been regarded as 
consisting entirely of warm-up pieces. All three works deserve to be honored 
rather than condescended to, as the players amply proved. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Mozart, the group offered Haydn's Trio in E-flat, No. 29, with 
its outrageously bumptious alla tedesca finale, and Beethoven's witty and, in 
this context, powerful, Trio in E-flat, Opus 1, No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Optimum spirit and stylishness characterized the Mozarteans' interpretations 
that exhibited a good deal more (and decidedly welcome) string vibrato than we 
usually get from antiquarian performers. HERBERT GLASS

<TEXT>
<P>
Last December, the Irvine Co. and four other corporations chipped in $2,420 to 
treat a group of county officials to an evening yacht cruise on Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Don R. Roth attended the affair, replete with hot hors d'oeuvres, 
beer and wine and dancing. But most of the invitations set aside for county 
officials were directed to -- and accepted by -- 14 of the supervisors' 35 
appointed aides. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the cruise during Newport Beach's Parade of Lights was among $9,650 in 
gifts -- from ballet tickets to rounds of golf -- that were accepted by aides 
to the five supervisors last year from lobbyists and others doing business with 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
According to reports filed with the county registrar of voters, the aides 
received more in gifts than the five elected supervisors themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"The Irvine Co. has a tradition of inviting employees, their spouses and guests 
from business and government to attend the Parade of Lights and share in this 
holiday celebration," read a brief statement issued recently by Larry Thomas, a 
vice president of the firm that is Orange County's largest developer. "We do it 
because it's fun." 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine political science professor Mark P. Petracca, however, believes that 
corporate gift-givers commonly seek out the supervisors' aides because of the 
power they wield in providing advice and access to their bosses. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of things are nice to have from people who can afford to give them (but) 
why were they given? What was the purpose?" Petracca poses. "It's access -- how 
quickly I let you in to see the supervisor." 
</P>
<P>
Petracca notes that such gift-giving in county government is most often 
practiced by major developers and businesses that hold or seek county contracts 
and can afford to entertain. 
</P>
<P>
"The Orange County Homeless Task Force isn't handing out any free basketball 
tickets or dinner chits to aides of supervisors," Petracca said. 
</P>
<P>
Any suggestion of impropriety, however, raises the hackles of corporate 
representatives as well as county officials, who see an occasional free lunch, 
dinner or round of golf as far more routine and benign. Even journalists 
occasionally pick up a tab for lunch, one aide noted. (No aides reported 
receiving gifts from journalists last year; gifts must be declared only if they 
total $50 or more from a single source over a one year period.) 
</P>
<P>
Some aides also argue that gift-taking nowadays is a far cry from the days of 
Peter Herman, a former aide to 5th District Supervisor Thomas F. Riley who 
reported $5,853 in gifts in 1985 alone. Herman left under fire in 1987 after it 
was revealed that he had accepted a free four-day stay in Hawaii from a 
developer. Herman now works for Hon Development Co., which last year gave one 
of Riley's aides a lunch, a birthday gift and a ham worth a total of $100, 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
Riley, who was disturbed by some of Herman's gift-taking, defended the 
practices of his current staff, who reported a total of $3,075 in gifts last 
year -- the highest among the five supervisory offices. 
</P>
<P>
"If I didn't like it I'd stop it," Riley said. "As far as I know they're not 
doing anything that's going to bring discredit to themselves or to Tom Riley or 
to the county. If they do I'll ask them to leave." 
</P>
<P>
Riley aide Mark J. Goodman reported 30 lunches and dinners and one breakfast 
with county developers or their consultants last year, as well as a free 
concert. The meals ranged from $6 to $25, according to his statement. 
</P>
<P>
Goodman, who briefly worked for a developer before joining Riley's staff as a 
transportation specialist, said he has close friends in the building industry 
and, in an abundance of caution, reports any meals they pick up -- even when no 
county business is discussed. 
</P>
<P>
Goodman, who recently ran unsuccessfully for Laguna Niguel City Council, said 
that despite free meals or campaign contributions he is always ready to tell 
developers "to go to hell when they come in with a bad project. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"If a lunch can buy a favor you certainly have no business serving the public," 
Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
But Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said he believes gift-taking by county 
officials looks bad regardless of the intent. Vasquez reported no gifts during 
the three years he served as an aide to former Supervisor Bruce Nestande in the 
early 1980s.

This year Vasquez reported accepting $746.85 in gifts, mostly in the form of 
formal dinners and receptions he attended. His staff was the only office to 
report less than $1,000 in gifts. The total for the office -- $330 -- was for 
three invitations accepted to the Christmas cruise. (The Newport Harbor cruise 
was financed by the Irvine Co. and three county contractors: Ernst &amp; Young, 
an accounting firm; LSA Associates Inc., an environmental consultant, and Van 
Dell &amp; Associates, an engineering firm working on the John Wayne Airport 
expansion. Also contributing was the Bechtel Corp., which is bidding to build 
the Las Vegas-to-Anaheim bullet train through a bistate transportation 
authority on which Supervisor Roth serves.) 
</P>
<P>
"I've always discouraged my staff from accepting any kind of gift as a matter 
of office policy," Vasquez said, "so that there's no real or perceived sense of 
conflict." 
</P>
<P>
The most generous gift-giver last year was the Philip Morris Cos. Inc. Along 
with its wholly owned subsidiary, the Mission Viejo Co., the corporate entity 
paid out $2,152 in lunches, ballet tickets and golf outings. As one of the 
largest developers in Orange County, the Mission Viejo Co. has frequent 
dealings with county officials, and its development agreements with the Board 
of Supervisors have sometimes been controversial. 
</P>
<P>
For example, slow-growth advocates and city officials in the South County have 
objected to an agreement in which the board guaranteed the company the right to 
complete its planned construction of 20,000 housing units in Aliso Viejo in 
exchange for millions of dollars in roads and other public facilities. The 
agreement effectively shields the developer from any efforts by local 
government to limit the development. 
</P>
<P>
"We have many projects before the the county and the supervisors' aides often 
give us insight into what the supervisors want to see in those projects," said 
Wendy Wetzel, a spokeswoman for the Mission Viejo Co. 
</P>
<P>
Wetzel also said Philip Morris sponsors several national ballets and gives free 
tickets to many business associates, including county staff. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to meet with people socially and get to know them when you don't 
have to discuss business." 
</P>
<P>
The second most generous company last year was Shapell Industries Inc. of 
Beverly Hills, which gave aides $848 worth of gourmet food baskets, concert and 
fashion show tickets and meals, according to disclosure reports. In 1989 
Shapell was awaiting the supervisors' final ruling on Country Village, proposed 
to be the largest housing development in Laguna Niguel -- more than 4,000 homes 
-- by the time it is complete. 
</P>
<P>
The project was once a subject of grand jury investigation and the target of a 
lawsuit brought by slow-growth advocates. Eventually a compromise was worked 
out with all parties and the supervisors gave final approval to a slightly 
scaled-back version of the project last December. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials did not return several calls for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley Grindle, author of the county's Tin Cup campaign reform law and a 
self-proclaimed political watchdog, is a leading critic of gift-giving by 
corporate interests. Grindle said curbs on the practice were inadvertently left 
out of the reform law she authored, which was approved by the supervisors in 
December, 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Grindle said that gift-givers "want to be considered as part of the 'in-group' 
so they can get in to see the supervisors or the aides whenever they want to, 
which, by the way, a lot of citizens are unable to do. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"You can't really avoid the appearance that those gifts are getting you votes 
or favorable treatment," Grindle said. "At the very least, it makes it 
uncomfortable to go against those who have been wining and dining you." 
</P>
<P>
Building industry executives dismiss such criticism, contending that to have a 
productive discussion with the aides it is sometimes necessary to get them away 
from the phone and other distractions in their county offices. It is often the 
aide who monitors the complex nuts and bolts of a project for the busy 
supervisor, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"Communications can take place at a $10 or $15 lunch," said Tom Daly, director 
of governmental affairs for Orange County's Building Industry Assn. "There is 
certainly nothing wrong with that and we believe it is healthy for democracy to 
communicate from top to bottom." 
</P>
<P>
The supervisory aide declaring the most in gifts last year was Barbara Ann 
Brown, an aide to Supervisor Roger R. Stanton. Most of the $1,206 she reported 
in gifts was not received from corporate interests: She declared $900 in free 
dinners or receptions for various political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
In second and third place were supervisory aides Dan L. Wooldridge, who 
declared $895 -- mostly in lunches and golf -- and Christine M. Smith, who 
declared $707 in lunches, fashion shows, ballet tickets and the December 
Christmas cruise. Both are aides to Supervisor Roth. 
</P>
<P>
Wooldridge says his office is scrupulous in reporting anything that might be 
considered a gift. Working lunches for a busy public official are a fact of 
life, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Wooldridge also dismisses the notion that aides wield great power in a 
supervisory office. 
</P>
<P>
"Any aide who thinks he makes the decisions is an aide who is not long for the 
world," Wooldridge said.

$250,000 MOTEL FIRE NEAR DISNEYLAND UNDER INVESTIGATION

<TEXT>
<P>
An early morning fire swept through two units of a motel near Disneyland, 
causing $250,000 damage, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials are still investigating the cause of the blaze that broke out 
shortly after 4 a.m. at the Saga Motel in the 1600 block of South Harbor 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Fire Department Division Chief Ron Hamric said an occupant of one of 
the burned units called 911 after smelling smoke in his room. 
</P>
<P>
Forty Anaheim firefighters, assisted by a unit from the Orange Fire Department, 
took 14 minutes to control the fire, Hamric said. 
</P>
<P>
Hamric said quick work by firefighters prevented an additional $2 million in 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
"We were lucky that everything worked well," Hamric said. "The smoke alarms 
sounded . . . and we got there right in time to prevent a disaster."

BUCKEY PROSECUTOR UNSURE OF WITNESSES' RECOLLECTIONS;

WITNESS RECALL QUESTIONED IN BUCKEY RETRIAL

Opening statements began today in the retrial of Raymond Buckey with a 
prosecutor telling jurors he is uncertain what three children can remember of 
alleged molestations at the McMartin Pre-School. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Joseph Martinez noted that the toddlers are now pre-teens 
and their memories might have faded with time. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how much they will recall, how much they have repressed," the 
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey's attorney, Danny Davis, said the defendant will take the stand, look 
jurors in the eyes and declare that he never molested anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Davis noted that one child scheduled to testify was never a student of Buckey 
at the McMartin school, which was owned and operated by his family. 
</P>
<P>
"You will have the opportunity to see this man charged with these heinous 
crimes, to look into his eyes and look into his soul," Davis told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers spoke after Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg dismissed an 
alternate juror who came to court distressed by a fire that engulfed her boat 
during a weekend family outing. She and others suffered smoke inhalation before 
being rescued by the harbor patrol. 
</P>
<P>
She also said she took a tranquilizer before coming to court, but "I feel very 
nervous and upset." 
</P>
<P>
The woman began coughing violently at the start of Martinez's speech and was 
ushered out of court. She had said she might be too upset to go forward and the 
judge decided to excuse her. That left five alternate jurors. 
</P>
<P>
The interruption came as Martinez was beginning to recount for jurors the 
evidence which he said would prove the three girls were molested by Buckey. 
</P>
<P>
He told how one child began to have nightmares and showed other signs of 
molestation during the two years she attended the McMartin school. 
</P>
<P>
As Martinez spoke, Buckey's mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, sat in the audience 
taking notes. The defendant's father, Charles Buckey, also attended, but the 
spectator section was not as crowded as during the culmination of another trial 
in which Buckey's mother was acquitted of all charges and Ray Buckey was 
acquitted of the majority of allegations against him. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office decided to retry Buckey, 31, on eight counts 
involving the three children, a greatly diminished number from the hundreds who 
were once said to have been molested at the school.

Thousands of Israelis demanding electoral reform demonstrated outside the 
Parliament today as it opened its summer session by commemorating the 45th 
anniversary of Nazi Germany's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
At the gates of the Israeli Parliament, the Knesset, demonstrators booed and 
whistled at members arriving for the special session. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is disgusted with what's going on," said Roni Lottner, 24. "They 
offer jobs. They offer bribes to try to form a government. The system is 
distorted." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly two months of intense political bargaining to form a government have 
disillusioned many Israelis and fueled the reform movement. Because neither 
Likud nor Labor have a majority in the Knesset, the small religious parties and 
breakaway members of the two major parties hold the power to determine the 
makeup of the next government. 
</P>
<P>
More than 2,400 demonstrators calling for direct election of the prime minister 
and Knesset members gathered in the Rose Garden to rally for electoral reform. 
</P>
<P>
"We've just got to change the system so the majority rules," Akiva Ehrlich 
said. "Today the system we have allows immorality and bribery." 
</P>
<P>
Staying away from political declarations, acting Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir 
reminded the opening session of the thousands of Jews who gave their lives to 
create the state of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"Its independence did not come easily. It was the result of many years of 
political struggle," he said. "It was born out of generations of work . . . and 
it was achieved by the pure blood of thousands of youths who gave their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Parliament Speaker Dov Shilanksy, who escaped the Holocaust, told the members 
that it was their task to remember those who were killed by the Nazis.

Denmark's national symbol, The Little Mermaid, has been vandalized by someone 
who tried to sever the bronze statue's head using a metal cutter, police said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever did it seems to have been frightened off in the middle of the job. 
</P>
<P>
A 7-inch slice is missing from the left-hand side of the neck," Copenhagen 
police inspector Jens Christensen said. 
</P>
<P>
Damage to the Little Mermaid is always handled by the Copenhagen homicide 
squad. The famous statue was created by Danish sculptor Erik Eriksen in 1914 in 
honor of the fairy tale of the same name by Danish storyteller Hans Christian 
Andersen. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of tourists flock to Copenhagen harbor each year to view the 
melancholy mermaid, who looks across the choppy waters of the open harbor.

Two Colombians linked to the Medellin cocaine cartel face charges of trying to 
buy Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and automatic weapons as part of a plot to 
shoot down Colombian government helicopters, the FBI said today. 
</P>
<P>
FBI Special Agent William Gavin could not confirm an ABC News report that the 
weapons were to be used to kill Colombian President Virgilio Barco Vargas and 
his Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
Gavin said at least one other arrest is pending. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect arrested in Miami, Luis Fernando Arcila-Giraldo, 28, claimed to be 
a close associate of Medellin drug cartel leader Pablo Escobar, Gavin told a 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Arcila-Giraldo was arrested without incident Saturday near Miami International 
Airport and was scheduled to appear this afternoon before a U.S. magistrate, 
Gavin said. 
</P>
<P>
The second suspect, Alfredo Antonio Ramos-Tinoco, 47, was arrested without 
incident Saturday while playing pool at the Marriott Hotel. He is scheduled to 
appear before a U.S. magistrate in Tampa this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Both men were charged with conspiracy to receive stolen property, conspiracy to 
export arms without a license and aiding and abetting the importation and 
possession with intent to distribute marijuana and cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Gavin said both men had negotiated with undercover agents in Polk County to buy 
Stinger missiles and automatic weapons with proceeds from cocaine and marijuana 
sales. Ramos-Tinoco told undercover agents that he had recently imported 
"thousands of pounds" of marijuana into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, undercover agents showed the two suspects a Stinger missile and 
the two men later agreed to make a $1-million down payment for an unspecified 
number of Stingers, Gavin said. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI also seized marijuana and semi-automatic weapons and pistols from a 
Miami house that both men had visited. 
</P>
<P>
"The missiles were to be exported to Colombia to be used against Colombian 
government helicopters," Gavin said. "We know of no assassination plot in 
association with this case." 
</P>
<P>
Gavin said he has no information on the relationship between Arcila-Giraldo and 
Escobar, except for the suspect's own comments to undercover agents that he was 
a "close associate." 
</P>
<P>
The FBI began an undercover investigation April 18 after the suspects 
approached Polk County undercover agents asking to buy the Stinger missiles, 
Gavin said. 
</P>
<P>
"The representation was that the money was to come from the proceeds of 
marijuana and cocaine sales," Gavin said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Magistrate Paul Game Jr. of Tampa issued arrest warrants for the suspects 
after the Tuesday meeting with undercover agents, Gavin said.

A royal jet carrying Princess Diana was forced to make an emergency landing 
today because of an electrical problem that cropped up just after takeoff on 
the first leg of a visit to Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers repaired the problem and the 28-year-old princess of Wales and her 
entourage later left on the first official visit to a Warsaw Pact nation by 
members of the House of Windsor, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The first stop was to be in Ancona, Italy, where the royal party was to pick up 
Prince Charles, Diana's husband and the heir to the British throne, before 
flying on to the Hungarian capital of Budapest. Prince Charles was in Italy to 
open his first exhibition of watercolor paintings. 
</P>
<P>
The unspecified electrical fault was detected shortly after the BAE-146 
aircraft -- manned by the Queen's Flight, members of the Royal Air Force -- 
took off from London's Heathrow Airport, authorities said. The pilot 
immediately diverted to London's nearby Gatwick Airport, where the problem was 
solved. The princess and her party of about 20 remained aboard the aircraft 
while British Airways engineers fixed the problem.

BRADY CALLS FOR CRACKDOWN ON LATE IMF LOANS

<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said today the United States will support 
increasing the resources of the International Monetary Fund only if it agrees 
to crack down on poor countries behind in their loan payments. 
</P>
<P>
Brady's comments, to IMF's policy-making Interim Committee, came one day after 
finance leaders of the world's seven largest industrial powers endorsed a 50% 
boost in the fund's resources to $180 billion from the current $120 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Brady acknowledged that the 152-nation lending organization needs more money to 
meet new demand for its loans from Eastern European countries moving from 
communism to capitalism, as well as for developing nations. Although the United 
States had supported a smaller boost, he said it has agreed to 50% as a 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"We firmly believe that the IMF must have adequate resources . . . to continue 
to fulfill its critical responsibilities in the world economy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said the United States will support an increase in capital 
contributions from member nations, called quotas, only if the fund adopts a new 
strategy to wring $4 billion in back payments from 11 countries -- Sudan, 
Zambia, Peru, Honduras, Guyana, Cambodia, Vietnam, Liberia, Panama, Sierra 
Leone and Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
"These arrears pose a fundamental challenge to the IMF's financial integrity 
and its central role in the world economy," Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
The Group of Seven -- finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the United 
States, Japan, West Germany, Great Britain, France, Canada and Italy -- met 
Sunday in an ornate caucus room in the Capitol.

Live Entertainment Inc., making its first major move overseas, said today it 
has completed the acquisition of a majority interest in VCL Communications 
GmbH, the leading home video distributor in Germany, for an undisclosed price. 
</P>
<P>
Live, a leading U.S. video distributor and retailer, has been expanding 
steadily over the past year despite last summer's murder of its chairman, Jose 
Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
It had announced on Feb. 20 that it had signed a letter of intent to buy VCL. 
</P>
<P>
Live, in which independent movie producer Carolco Pictures holds a 49% voting 
interest, said the acquisition of VCL, which has annual revenues of more than 
$25 million, marks Live's debut into the overseas home video distribution 
market. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a strategic and opportune deployment of our resources as we position 
ourselves in West Germany prior to the formation of the European Common Market 
in 1992," said Devendra Mishra, president and chief executive officer, and 
Roger R. Smith, president of the company's Live Enterprises unit.

ICAHN PESSIMISTIC ON EFFORT TO SPLIT USX

<P>
Carl Icahn took his battle with USX Corp. management to the company's annual 
meeting today, but the corporate raider conceded that his plan to split the 
steel-energy giant in two could fail. 
</P>
<P>
Icahn, USX's biggest shareholder, disclosed the pessimism as he urged other 
stockholders to approve his proposal for separating the company's healthier 
Marathon Oil Co. subsidiary from its laggard U.S. Steel business. 
</P>
<P>
About 600 shareholders packed a junior high school auditorium in Findlay, 
Marathon's hometown, to hear Icahn and USX management present their views on 
how to shape the future of one of the biggest U.S. industrial corporations. 
</P>
<P>
The vote on Icahn's plan is widely seen as a test of how much influence 
corporate takeover strategists still have, now that much of the muscle to back 
up their threats -- billions of dollars in financing -- has atrophied because 
of a severe decline in their war chest, the market for high-risk "junk bonds." 
</P>
<P>
Results of the vote aren't expected for at least a week. But Icahn, who has 
13.3% of USX shares, or about 34 million shares, admitted as the meeting began 
that he might not have the crucial support needed from five or six large 
institutional investors. 
</P>
<P>
These large institutions, whom Icahn didn't identify, prefer to allow 
management to "do it on their own," he told shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Under Icahn's plan, 80% of U.S. Steel would be spun off as a dividend to 
shareholders. Each shareholder would own stock in U.S. Steel and Marathon that 
Icahn estimated would be worth a combined value of $48. 
</P>
<P>
The unlikelihood of approval evidently depressed USX's stock price late this 
morning. Shares were trading at $33.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, down 50 
cents from Friday.

A closed museum boasting the world's largest collection of Bruce Springsteen 
memorabilia wants to sell it intact for at least $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Among the items for sale: a surfboard, Springsteen's 1970 driver's license, his 
draft card and a rare 1966 unreleased single by Springsteen's first band, the 
Castiles. 
</P>
<P>
The Asbury Park Rock 'n' Roll Museum shut down last year. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Smith, a co-owner of most of the Springsteen artifacts, said he hopes a 
buyer will keep them in Asbury Park, where the singer got his start. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, somebody will buy this stuff and display it," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Asbury Park, a down-at-the-heels resort town, is the setting for some of 
Springsteen's early songs. 
</P>
<P>
The museum was in the Palace Amusement Arcade, where parts of Springsteen's 
"Tunnel of Love" video were shot. When the arcade closed last year, so did the 
museum, and its contents went into storage.

Reporters were barred from the ceremony at the mansion in Byron Bay, in the far

LIZ SMITH: CAN 'SUPERLEE' SAVE A SELF-DESTRUCTING DONALD?

<P>
FLASH! (Oh well, maybe it's only a blip or a zip.) Winging in from the West 
Coast, which is now his domain, has been the mighty public relations flack of 
flacks, Lee Solters, who has been in New York talking to Donald Trump! 
</P>
<P>
Lee is affiliated with the NYC / LA firm of Solters, Roskin, Friedman. They 
usually handle theater, movies, actors like Barbra Streisand, and an occasional 
producer, such as Marvin Davis. Lee is also the force who spoke up for years in 
defense of Frank Sinatra. Now, anybody who can handle Streisand and Sinatra 
might also be able to polish the tarnished Trump. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Where would this leave the big Howard Rubenstein PR firm, long in 
Trump's corner? I'm not sure, but perhaps they wouldn't cry too much coming 
home from the bank over losing a client who doesn't seem to listen to their 
advice as a rule and often makes them the goat for his own misadventures with 
the media. 
</P>
<P>
I can just see Lee Solters -- happy and relaxed, enjoying the good life in 
California. (He has just about forgotten those gritty, good old, bad old days 
in New York.) Suddenly, Lee gets a call at the Beverly Hills Hotel pool. He has 
to rush off and then spring out of a telephone booth wearing his blue union 
suit with the big yellow and red "S" on the chest. 
</P>
<P>
One thing is for sure: Donald Trump's bad PR these days sounds like a job for 
-- SuperLee! 
</P>
<P>
FOR INSTANCE, did you see The Donald with Sam Donaldson on ABC's "Primetime?" 
For the first few minutes, I thought Trump had the advantage. He seemed calm, 
cool, collected, intelligent and about to dominate the discussion of his 
financial empire (sent up by Forbes magazine.) Then, right before the viewer's 
eyes, Trump lost it. He suddenly turned into Macho Man, as if determined to be 
tougher, rougher, ruder than his inquisitor. (Sam, however, was being an 
absolute doll on this occasion.) I guess Trump is under a lot of unpleasant 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
DIRECTOR Penny Marshall is sweating things out, cutting her movie "Awakenings" 
in Los Angeles and very much under the gun. This difficult effort, starring 
Robin Williams and Robert De Niro, took four months to make in New York City. 
It has a "first cut" that runs an amazing and daunting four hours and 20 
minutes long. 
</P>
<P>
By the by, the popularity contest from cast and crew goes like this. For Robin 
-- 100-plus percent as a nice guy; for Robert -- 100-minus percent as a grumpy, 
unfriendly, difficult actor.

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: DRUG INTERACTION SHOULD BE DISCUSSED BEFORE SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Several months ago my wife ruptured a disk in her back and was in 
agony. Her doctor recommended surgery and after a second opinion, she decided 
to go ahead with it. 
</P>
<P>
Before the operation, she met with the surgeon and they reviewed all the 
medications she was taking, including an antidepressant called Parnate. In 
fact, she had to give the same information over and over again to different 
doctors. 
</P>
<P>
She scheduled the surgery and steeled herself for it. But just before they 
wheeled her into the operating room, the anesthesiologist came bustling in to 
review her chart one last time. When he saw that she was on Parnate, he called 
the operation off. 
</P>
<P>
I don't understand why somebody didn't know weeks ahead of time that she 
couldn't have surgery while she was on Parnate. They certainly knew all about 
it, so why didn't anybody tell us? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: It is shocking that such lack of communication could occur in a 
hospital, but this isn't the first time we have heard of such problems. We 
believe it is crucial that patients meet their anesthesiologist well in advance 
of surgery to discuss potential medication interactions. 
</P>
<P>
In your wife's case, blood pressure control could have been more difficult 
while she was on Parnate. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Can you tell me about Ansaid? My mother has just started taking it for 
arthritis, and now she says she is free of pain. Is this pain reliever 
addicting? 
</P>
<P>
A. Ansaid (flurbiprofen) is a relatively new arthritis medication. Like most 
other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), this type of medicine 
reduces inflammation and swelling in the joints as well as relieving pain. 
</P>
<P>
NSAIDs are not addicting, but they do have side effects, including stomach 
irritation, ulceration, diarrhea, headache, skin rash and kidney problems.

A YEAR AFTER CUP, FLAMES OUST CRISP; 
</P>
<P>
NHL: DEFENDING CHAMPION CALGARY FIRES ITS COACH IN THE WAKE OF A FIRST-ROUND 
PLAYOFF LOSS TO THE KINGS. NO SUCCESSOR IS NAMED.

<P>
Terry Crisp, whose Calgary Flames won the Stanley Cup last season but were 
upset by the Los Angeles Kings in the first round of this year's NHL playoffs, 
was fired today. 
</P>
<P>
In three seasons with the Flames, Crisp led them to their first Stanley Cup, 
the league's best record in 1988 and '89 and the second-best record this 
season. His record was 144-63-33. 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Cliff Fletcher said Crisp, 46, had the option of remaining with 
the team in a "meaningful capacity," but the former NHL player was not at 
today's news conference. Fletcher did not name Crisp's successor but said he 
planned to do so within several days. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the feeling that to maximize the potential of our hockey club it 
necessitates a change of coach," Fletcher said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Flames won the '89 Stanley Cup, this year's early exit from the 
playoffs apparently sealed Crisp's fate. In his rookie season, the Flames 
finished first in the overall standings but were knocked out of the playoffs in 
the second round by the Edmonton Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
Crisp, whose red hair matches his fiery temper, took some heat in Calgary for 
publicly criticizing his players. Team owners asked him to tone down his foul 
language behind the bench because of complaints from fans. 
</P>
<P>
Few criticisms were heard of Crisp last season, though, as the Flames won their 
second straight President's Trophy with 117 points. After a first-round playoff 
scare from Vancouver, the Flames went on to win the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this season, though, whispers of discontent began. There were reports 
that the players didn't respect Crisp and openly questioned his coaching 
methods. 
</P>
<P>
Crisp, twice nominated for NHL coach of the year, has two years remaining on 
the contract he signed last summer with the Flames. He played 11 seasons with 
Boston, St. Louis, the New York Islanders and Philadelphia, where he played on 
Stanley Cup champions in 1974 and '75. 
</P>
<P>
He was an assistant coach for two seasons with the Flyers, then took over as 
head coach of the Ontario Hockey League's Soo Greyhounds. He coached the 
Greyhounds to three league championships. 
</P>
<P>
Crisp then spent two seasons with the Moncton Golden Flames, Calgary's American 
Hockey League farm team.

Royals co-owner Ewing Kauffman doesn't want to get saddled with the lifetime 
contracts of some Kansas City players if he sells the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to guarantee them. 
</P>
<P>
Period," Kauffman said in an interview published in today's Kansas City Star. 
</P>
<P>
The club's other 50% owner, real estate developer Avron B. Fogelman, is 
struggling financially and has proposed a deal for Kauffman to help bail him 
out in exchange for Fogelman's share of the team. 
</P>
<P>
First baseman George Brett, center fielder Willie Wilson and former Royals' 
pitcher Dan Quisenberry have signed guaranteed lifetime contracts that include 
real estate deals with Fogelman. Fogelman is obligated to pay any shortfall 
arising from the real estate portion of the contracts. Fogelman's creditors 
want him released from that obligation and replaced by Kauffman. 
</P>
<P>
Kauffman told the newspaper, "That just doesn't make sense to me because I 
don't know if I'll continue to own the Royals."

MELVIN DURSLAG: TRIPLE CROWN RIGORS TOO HEAVY A BURDEN FOR DERBY HOPEFULS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the afterglow, we take the hand today of Mister Frisky and offer comfort and 
encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
The poor guy is undefeated and untied coming into the Kentucky Derby last 
Saturday, and he is very much in contention for a mile. The only trouble is, 
the race is longer. Is that Mister Frisky's fault? 
</P>
<P>
The stretch at Churchill Downs measures 1,234 1/2 feet, but, to a tiring horse, 
it looks like the runway at Heathrow. Mister Frisky gasps to his rider, Gary 
Stevens: 
</P>
<P>
"You've got a wife and kids. Save yourself. Get off and make it to the wire on 
foot." 
</P>
<P>
"We're in this together," answers Stevens, and the two buddies finish in the 
toilet as the Derby favorite, 19 1/4 lengths up the course. 
</P>
<P>
Today, in the Mister Frisky camp, the climate is sadness. The commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, whence he came, is sad. It had people at the track, ready to 
unfurl the Puerto Rican flag, symbol of triumph. 
</P>
<P>
The island was busted, inhabitants backing their hero who had affirmed their 
trust 16 times in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The trainer was sad. Laz Barrera, who has endured two cardiac surgeries, had 
given his beaten-up heart to the horse. 
</P>
<P>
And, you have to presume, Mister Frisky was embarrassed, feeling as Mike Tyson 
did the night his undefeated string came to an end against Buster Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
The Buster Douglas, in this case, is a fellow named Unbridled, who seems to run 
only when his Muse dictates. Unbridled had run 10 times and won only three, 
finishing fifth even at an outpost known as Calder. 
</P>
<P>
In subsequent starts, he finishes third, first and third, and all of a sudden, 
he is passing horses in the stretch, winning the Derby by 3 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
He runs away from Mister Frisky and the second favorite, Summer Squall, who, 
until the Derby, blows only one other race. 
</P>
<P>
Those who back Summer Squall have an explanation. They say the horse lost 
weight in the days preceding the Derby and didn't have his usual strength when 
the drive began. 
</P>
<P>
They don't know why the horse lost weight, but we are able to tell them. 
</P>
<P>
He met up with Tom Lasorda, who put him on a diet plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost 40 pounds and I feel great," Lasorda testified. "I'm never hungry." 
</P>
<P>
"What should I do?" the horse asked. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a delicious milkshake in the morning and another in the afternoon," 
Tom said. "Then you have anything you want for dinner, like pasta and 
meatballs. The weight will fall off you." 
</P>
<P>
Today the question is asked whether the dieting did in Summer Squall, or 
whether it was the meatballs. 
</P>
<P>
All we know is that Lasorda is a force society must reckon with. He strikes a 
deal with Kirk Gibson and Orel Hershiser whereby the two players donate money 
to a nunnery if Tom loses weight. 
</P>
<P>
He loses weight, but Gibson and Hershiser bow out. It's like years ago when Don 
Newcombe, afraid of flying, visited a hypnotist. 
</P>
<P>
Newcombe was soon flying, but the hypnotist wouldn't get into an elevator. 
</P>
<P>
From Churchill Downs, the 3-year-old racers now head for the Preakness, in two 
weeks, to be followed by the Belmont, three weeks after that. 
</P>
<P>
A wide disparity of thought exists among horse scientists over whether the 
Triple Crown, as it is now structured, isn't too physically demanding for 
entrants that age. 
</P>
<P>
One school holds that the Derby, at a mile and a quarter, and the Preakness, at 
a mile and 3/16ths, take too much out of a runner asked to go a mile and a half 
in the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
Some trainers skip the Derby and come in fresh at the Preakness, sort of like a 
marathon runner sneaking into the race at the 15-mile mark. A woman marathoner 
in New York played it smarter one day. 
</P>
<P>
She hopped a subway and entered the race only a mile from the finish. 
</P>
<P>
But those discounting the overload theory of the Triple Crown point out that a 
horse is a fragile creature, 1,100 pounds of bone china. Anything can do him 
in. 
</P>
<P>
Two days before the recent Derby, for instance, an entrant went lame during a 
three-furlong workout. Others have bowed out hot-walking. 
</P>
<P>
And then there is the celebrated story of Doc Jocoy, shipped to the Derby from 
California and allowed to nibble blue grass outside his barn. He develops such 
a bad case of colic that he has to be scratched. 
</P>
<P>
And the owner, who loves Doc Jocoy, launches a campaign against Kentucky, 
urging people to stay out of there if they have any feeling for their horse. 
</P>
<P>
And how do the horses feel about the Triple Crown? One who doesn't care to be 
identified explains: 
</P>
<P>
"Look, what else do we have to do? We aren't allowed to go out with girls. We 
can't drink, drive a Ferrari, or even go shopping. We might as well run. 
Trainers worry more than we do." 
</P>
<P>
Which, of course, is also the case with the assignment of weights in racing. 
You hang 128 pounds on a runner and the trainer screams: 
</P>
<P>
"You're breaking the horse down!" 
</P>
<P>
But you hang it on someone else's horse and the same trainer will say, "It's 
handicap racing, isn't it? The sport is based on this kind of equalizing."

LASIX FOUND TO AID HORSES' PERFORMANCE; 
</P>
<P>
RACING: A STUDY ALSO FOUND THAT THE DRUG, USED TO CONTROL BLEEDING, DOES NOT 
ALWAYS WORK. THE MEDICATION IS LEGAL IN SOME STATES BUT BANNED IN OTHERS.

<P>
A University of Pennsylvania study released today shows that Lasix improves a 
race horse's performance but does not always have the desired effect. 
</P>
<P>
The study, commissioned and funded by the Jockey Club, was the first to test 
the effect of the medication called furosemide, used to control bleeding in 
horses. Kentucky Derby winner Unbridled was one of five horses who ran on the 
substance in that race. 
</P>
<P>
The Penn research team, headed by veterinarians Corinne Raphel Sweeney, 
Lawrence Soma and Abbey Maxson, administered Lasix to 76 non-bleeders at 
Philadelphia Park Racetrack during the 1988-89 racing season. Using three races 
in the study -- two without the medication being applied, the third with it -- 
the researchers found an improvement of 0.48 seconds or 2.4 lengths for a 
one-mile race when Lasix was used. The greatest gain was found in geldings, 
whose performance improved by 1.08 seconds or 5.4 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
In a related test, the researchers also found the racing performance of 52 
bleeders also was improved when Lasix was applied, although not by as much as 
the non-bleeders. The average improvement among the bleeders was .26 seconds or 
1.3 lengths with geldings again displaying the best gains. 
</P>
<P>
In each case, colts showed minimal or no gains, but the researchers said they 
felt the difference was related to age rather than gender since the geldings 
tested were, on the average, older. 
</P>
<P>
In an interesting sidelight to the study, Sweeney said that even after Lasix 
was administered, 32 of the 52 bleeders, 62%, continued to bleed. Of 235 
non-bleeders who ran on the drug, 62 bled following their races. 
</P>
<P>
Bleeding is not an unusual condition for thoroughbreds and the Penn vets had to 
screen nearly 700 horses to find 79 free of bleeding after three races who 
could then be used in the research. 
</P>
<P>
Ogden Mills Phipps, chairman of the Jockey Club, said the study was undertaken 
following discussion by all segments of the racing community -- trainers, 
owners, jockeys, veterinarians and officials. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody had ever defined the effects of Lasix on horses before," Phipps said. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to get the facts. We've mailed copies of this report to every racing 
commission in America. The Jockey Club opposes any artificial substance that 
enhances the racing ability of thoroughbreds. We are not in a position to 
dictate what the commissions should be doing. We are in position to inform them 
of the information available. 
</P>
<P>
"What the Jockey Club wants is to make sure racing is run fairly and perceived 
by the public to be run fairly." 
</P>
<P>
Lasix is banned in some racing states like New York but permitted in others, 
like Maryland and Kentucky.

Favored Lively One, who had been facing some of the best handicap horses in 
Southern California, scored a two-length victory Sunday in the $100,000 
Kensington Handicap for 3-year-olds and up. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of 16,346 wagered $3,671,433 on the 10-race program. 
</P>
<P>
Trained by Hall of Famer Charlie Whittingham and ridden by Alex Solis, Lively 
One rallied from last in the five-horse field to secure the winner's purse of 
$55,000. The paycheck pushed the 5-year-old's bank account to $1,162,300. 
</P>
<P>
Lively One was coming off fourth-place finishes in the $1-million Santa Anita 
Handicap and the $400,000 San Bernardino Handicap. Both of those races were won 
by Ruhlmann, a stablemate of Lively One. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his record and the company he had been keeping, Lively One was 
assigned high weight of 124 pounds in the Kensington. Shouldering the top 
impost with no problem, Lively One ran very strongly down the stretch and 
completed the mile and an eighth in 1:47 35. 
</P>
<P>
A prohibitive 1-2 choice, Lively One returned $3.00, $2.20 and $2.10. Stalwars, 
ridden by Ron Hansen, got up for second by a neck over Charlatan III and paid 
$2.60 and $2.20. Charlatan III, with Antonio Castanon aboard, paid $2.40 to 
show. 
</P>
<P>
Owned by John Sikura, Lively One is a multiple stakes winner who has eight 
victories, seven seconds and five thirds in 30 starts. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a nice horse and he showed his class today," Solis said of Lively One, 
who trailed by as many as 10 lengths early in the Kensington. "He (Whittingham) 
told me to just leave him alone the first part and then we'll come running at 
the end." 
</P>
<P>
Glitterman opened a long lead at the home turn and held off favored Miami Slick 
by a neck to win the $54,400 Tamarack Handicap at Miami's Calder Race Course 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Shuttleman was third in a field of seven in the six-furlong ninth race. 
Meanwhile, in the eighth race, a horrendous spill sent two riders to the 
hospital and forced a 4-year-old filly to be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Glitterman, ridden by Heberto Castillo Jr., was timed at 1:11 45 and paid 
$6.80, $3 and $2.20. Miami Slick, the 6-5 choice, paid $2.60 and $2.20. 
Shuttleman paid $2.40 to show. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth race, Win With Glory was leading at the 16th pole when her leg 
shattered and she pitched Julio Felix to the turf. 
</P>
<P>
Pach's Blend then fell, dropping Louis Monte, and Leprechaun Lynn, ridden by 
Pedro Rodriguez, fell over Pach's Blend. Rodriguez walked away from the 
accident, but Felix and Monte were taken to Hollywood Memorial Hospital, where 
officials refused to release any details about their condition. 
</P>
<P>
Win With Glory had to be destroyed at the track. 
</P>
<P>
The owner-trainer-jockey combination of Ogden Phipps, C. R. (Shug) McGaughey 
and Chris Antley completed a sweep of Aqueduct's weekend stakes Sunday when Lay 
Down came from just off the pace to carry 112 pounds to a 1 1/4-length victory 
in the $168,300 Excelsior Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
The same connections took Saturday's Carter Handicap with Dancing Spree. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Lac Ouimet, who led into the stretch, held on to be runner-up in the 
five-horse field, three lengths ahead of Doc's Leader. Chenin Blanc, the 
odds-on favorite, was fourth after fading in the stretch and Joker's Farce was 
the trailer. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the first in four starts this year for the 6-year-old gelding 
by Spectacular Bid-Impish, who was timed in 2:02 1/5 in the 1 1/4 miles on the 
fast track to earn $100,980. 
</P>
<P>
Lay Down returned $7.60, $4.60 and $5.60. Lac Ouimet paid $3.80 and $4.40, and 
Doc's Leader was $9.40 to show.

BETTING THE SYSTEMS; 
</P>
<P>
MONEY MANAGEMENT BRINGS GOOD DAY AT RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN DASH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "Broker" maintains that playing the stock market is the same as betting the 
ponies. A tall, thin, cadaverous individual, with a face that brings to mind 
Abraham Lincoln, he believes that both actions take a certain mastering. 
</P>
<P>
For example, making money with stocks, he tells his clients, is merely a matter 
of ups and downs. If you have more ups than downs, you've got to make money. 
And winning at the race track, he tells his afternoon cronies, is a matter of 
picking the right system. Just stabbing and picking horses helter-skelter off 
the Racing Form, he says, is the quickest way to bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Broker hasn't been that much of a success in the market. Of 
course, he and his clients make money, but not so much that they're getting 
rich and leaving their businesses or jobs. As for the race track, the Broker's 
friends say he has been more successful with his system than he has a right to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
The Broker has been doing fairly well with a money-management system that he 
devised during an off-moment while his stocks were doing more rising than 
falling. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, extremely confident, and well-financed with the profits he makes on the 
stock market, the Broker bets as follows: 
</P>
<P>
First race -- $2; second race -- $4; third race -- $6; fourth race -- $10; 
fifth race -- $16; sixth race -- $26; seventh race -- $44; eighth race -- $76, 
and ninth race -- $100. 
</P>
<P>
For this kind of wagering, a player needs a bankroll of $284 a day. However, as 
the Broker theorizes, any win paying $6 or more during the nine races will make 
up all the losses prior to the win and return a profit for the day. 
</P>
<P>
The key to the system, however, is that if a horse wins and the payoff is less 
than $6, then the player must keep wagering the money progression, even if 
there's a profit. 
</P>
<P>
And since the broker relies on his research department at his stock brokerage 
firm to give him the stocks to suggest to his customers, he also takes the 
advice of professional handicappers when using his betting system. What he does 
from day to day is follow one of the handicappers in the Los Angeles Times as 
listed in the Consensus box. 
</P>
<P>
During the Santa Anita season that recently ended, the Broker bet on either Bob 
Mieszerski, who ended up with the most wins, or Curtis Crayon, who finished 
with the most money won, depending on who held the hottest hand in picking 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
For example, on April 22 at Santa Anita, Curtis Crayon picked four winners. 
Although his first two paid less than $4, his win in the sixth returned $16.20 
and another win in the eighth paid off a hefty $37.20. Here's how the system 
worked: 
</P>
<P>
The Broker lost $2 on the first race, $4 on the second and $6 on the third. 
Losing $12, he wagered $10 on the fourth race, which was won by Lady Lavina, a 
heavy favorite that paid $3.60. Cashing in his tickets, the Broker had $18, but 
still was losing $4. Therefore, he continued to bet the progression. 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth race, the Broker wagered $16 on Golden Pheasant, which also was a 
heavy favorite, paying $3.80 to win. Returns amounted to $30.40 and the Broker 
was ahead $10.40. But since no horse had won paying $6 or more, the betting 
progression continued. 
</P>
<P>
A $26 bet was required for the sixth race. Just Deeds, a nag Crayon picked on 
top in a six-furlong allowance sprint for 4-year-olds and up, with jockey Chris 
McCarron in the saddle, jumped out of the No. 4 post position to second at the 
start. At the quarter-pole, Just Deeds was in front by a head and was running 
strongly. Entering the stretch, Just Deeds fell behind T.V. Screen by 2 1/2 
lengths. Then Just Deeds made a big move coming down the stretch, overtook T.V. 
Screen and won by a neck. 
</P>
<P>
Backers of the horse received $16.20 for a $2 win ticket. For his $26, the 
Broker collected $210.60. After deducting his $26 bet and adding $10.40 to the 
profit, the Broker was ahead $195 for the day. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, the Broker quit and left the track. However, had he not won the 
sixth race, but continued the progression, he would have lost the seventh and 
his $44 bet. 
</P>
<P>
The eighth race, however, would have easily put him ahead had he been losing 
and continuing the progression. Betting $76, the Broker would have seen 
Delegant, Crayon's best bet of the day, come home an easy winner on the turf in 
the $500,000 San Juan Capistrano Invitational, a 1 3/4-mile race for 
4-year-olds and up. 
</P>
<P>
The win paid $37.20 and the Broker would have marched off with almost $1,400 in 
winnings. 
</P>
<P>
Another good day for the Broker at Santa Anita on April 20 was when he switched 
from Crayon to Mieszerski. Although Mieszerski came up with only two winners, 
they were enough to give the Broker a profit. Losing through the seventh race, 
the Broker bet $76 on Paper Princess in the eighth, about 6 1/2 furlongs on the 
turf for fillies and mares, 4-year-olds and up. 
</P>
<P>
Paper Princess won by one-half length over Warming Zone to pay backers $5 to 
win. The Broker received $190 for his $76 bet. Total betting for the eight 
races amounted to $184, giving the Broker a $6 profit. However, since the 
winning payoff was less than $6, the Broker was forced to bet $100 on the last 
race, according to his system's rules. 
</P>
<P>
In the ninth, Mieszerski's top choice, Pop's Ruling, was scratched, thus 
elevating Lans Manus to the No. 1 selection. Lans Manus broke from the No. 10 
post position in the six-furlong sprint for 4-year-olds and up and went wire to 
wire to win by five lengths. 
</P>
<P>
The nag paid $8 to win for every $2 win ticket and the Broker collected $400. 
Subtracting the $100 bet on the race and adding on the $6 won on the eighth 
race, the Broker left the track winning $306 for the day. 
</P>
<P>
Although the amount of money bet and won is larger than most people can handle, 
it doesn't faze the Broker. Since he handles large sums of money in the stock 
market, the Broker thinks nothing at all of betting $100 on the last race. 
After all, for some people, he reasons, it's simply a matter of dipping into 
the petty cash.

HORSE RACING: AFTER OWNING SEVERAL COLTS WHO NEARLY MADE IT TO THE KENTUCKY 
DERBY, GENTER, 92, HAS A WINNER IN HER FIRST ATTEMPT.

<P>
Frances Genter's eyesight is so poor that the running of the 116th Kentucky 
Derby Saturday was only a blur. 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled's jockey, Craig Perret, wore a yellow cap rather than a light blue 
one so that owner Genter, 92, might be able to follow her colt in the race, but 
she still needed her trainer, Carl Nafzger, to stand next to her and give a 
play-by-play account of the race. 
</P>
<P>
Nafzger began: "It's a clean break, he's laying great." 
</P>
<P>
With a half-mile to run, he said: "He's making a nice move." 
</P>
<P>
Then: "He's fifth . . . fourth . . . third. . . . He's taking the lead!" 
</P>
<P>
As Unbridled flashed by his owner's box, Nafzger pointed toward the track and 
said: "There he is!' 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Nafzger screamed: "Mrs. Genter, you've got a Kentucky Derby winner!" 
</P>
<P>
Genter gasped. "Oh!" she whispered. Tears outlined her smiling face. 
</P>
<P>
"If I ever won a Derby, I wished it was this one," Nafzger said. "Mrs. Genter 
is 92 years old, 53 years in racing, and this is her first Derby horse." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday morning, while it rained again at Churchill Downs, horsemen reflected 
on the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
"We can thank the Man Upstairs for taking care of Mrs. Genter," said trainer 
Nick Zito, whose Thirty Six Red ran ninth Saturday. "I talked all week about 
paying my dues to get here. Now what do I do, reverse that? Ninety-two years 
old, that's paying dues." 
</P>
<P>
Ron McAnally, who trains Silver Ending, the fifth-place Derby finisher, was in 
the box next to Genter Saturday. McAnally couldn't see the race, either. "This 
was typical of the Derby," he said. "You pay $4,000 for tickets and you can't 
see because of everybody in front of you." 
</P>
<P>
When McAnally looked over at Genter, clutching Nafzger after the race was won, 
he got a warm feeling. "This is a woman who's been in racing all her life," 
McAnally said. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of Unbridled was born in Pennsylvania in 1898, the year Plaudit won 
the 24th running of the Kentucky Derby. She met Harold Genter while they were 
students at the University of Minnesota and they were married in 1919. Her 
husband developed the pop-up toaster and started the Toastmaster company. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Genter considered himself a good handicapper and backed his opinions 
with hefty bets at the windows. In 1940, he and Frances went to the Saratoga 
sales and bought their first horse. 
</P>
<P>
That led to an involvement in breeding thoroughbreds. A broodmare band of 30 
was not uncommon for the Genters. 
</P>
<P>
In 1951, the Genters won the Santa Anita Derby with Rough'n Tumble, ridden by 
Eddie Arcaro and trained by Sunshine Calvert. Rough'n Tumble later sired My 
Dear Girl, who was the champion 2-year-old filly in 1959. Some other important 
Genter horses have included In Reality, who won the Florida Derby 23 years 
before Unbridled did, and Smile, the champion sprinter for 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Genter died in 1981, and his widow decided to remain in racing -- 
delegating a son-in-law, Bentley Smith, to manage the stable. Frances Genter, 
whose horses still run in that name, has remarried, to Earl Knudtson, a retired 
businessman who prefers golf to horses. Knudtson, 93, played 18 holes the day 
before Unbridled won the Florida Derby, and on Saturday he played nine holes in 
Minnesota before watching the Derby on television. 
</P>
<P>
Genter bought Unbridled, a son of Fappiano, for $70,000 as a weanling at Tartan 
Farm's dispersal auction. Genter also bought Unbridled's dam, Gana Facil. Gana 
Facil means "Easy Victory." 
</P>
<P>
Genter has raced a horse named Unbridled before. The first Unbridled was a colt 
who did well in 1949 as a 2-year-old, but never made it to the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was asked why Genter used the name again. With the original Unbridled 
dead, the name was available through the Jockey Club. "We just ran out of 
names," Smith said. "It was a good name, so we submitted it." 
</P>
<P>
Frances Genter might have had a Derby starter before, but she never pushed her 
trainers. Rough'n Tumble wasn't a sound horse and the breeder, who was also a 
friend of the Genters, suggested that they skip the Derby. Calvert didn't think 
In Reality could run 1 1/4 miles and the Genters agreed. Some other good Genter 
3-year-olds -- Superbity, Dr. Carter and Smile -- had physical problems that 
precluded the Derby. Saturday, however, there were no problems at all. 
</P>
<P>
Frances Genter had the horse right here, as the lyric from "Guys and Dolls" 
goes. Dressed in a pillbox hat with veil, a polka-dot blouse and a dark skirt, 
the little grayhaired old lady waved and blew kisses to the crowd as she was 
taken to the winner's circle. 
</P>
<P>
"This is such a thrill," she said. "I'm really, really thrilled. We're No. 1. 
The Preakness is up to Carl. We've been taking things one day at a time."

<TEXT>
<P>
I refuse to call a 56-year-old man with white hair 'Sparky.' 
</P>
<P>
 -- American League umpire Al Clark 
</P>
<P>
George Lee Anderson won't debate this umpire's decision. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, Sparky was fine at Dorsey High School and a lot of playgrounds and 
ballyards in between then and now, but Sparky was never really what he was all 
about, not really who he was. 
</P>
<P>
Always a nice person, but too much the showman, he says now. 
</P>
<P>
Too much hype. Too much ego. 
</P>
<P>
"Too corny," George Anderson said in the dugout at Tiger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, Sparky Anderson always thought he had to sell his players, his team 
and himself. His ego kept getting in the way. George Anderson is basically 
pretty quiet, much lower key." 
</P>
<P>
And now, the manager of the Detroit Tigers believes that a name change would be 
an appropriate accompaniment to the philosophical change -- his better 
understanding of how inflated his ego became and how little control he has over 
winning and losing -- that he took out of a devastating 1989 season. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers, the winningest team in the '80s until then, lost 103 games, and 
Anderson was sent to his Thousand Oaks home May 19 to recover from physical and 
mental exhaustion stemming, primarily, from his inability to personally reverse 
the mounting tide of losses. 
</P>
<P>
A family situation that Anderson refuses to discuss is believed to have been a 
factor in what he calls his feeling of depression, but a member of the Tiger 
organization said it was more the jolt of the team's collapse, the 
inevitability of only his second losing season in 20 years as a major league 
manager and his first since 1971, when Cincinnati's Big Red Machine was first 
getting in gear. 
</P>
<P>
"Here was a guy who had basically never lost, and suddenly he was riding a 
treadmill of losses with no end in sight," the executive said. "It was a shock, 
and every time there was a hint of improvement, someone else got hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty Tigers went on the disabled list in 1989 and there was no help from a 
farm system that has been unproductive for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Former football coach Bo Schembechler has been given the responsibility of 
revitalizing a once proud organization as president and chief operating 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, under contract through 1992, said he hopes to remain Bo's manager for 
nine more years, giving him a total of 20 in Detroit, a goal reflecting the 
feeling of renewal he experienced during his 16-day hiatus last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers were 14-24 when he left, a victim of sleepless nights, suffocating 
feelings that he was locked in a closet and wouldn't be able to breathe until 
he got out, and almost catatonic states in which he would sit in his hotel room 
and stare absently at a blinded window. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson eventually called Jim Campbell, the Tigers' chairman of the board, and 
said there was something very much wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell called in the doctors, who put Anderson through a series of tests, 
concluding that his sense of depression and absence of energy resulted from his 
bewilderment at being unable to stop the losses. 
</P>
<P>
What did it matter that the aging Tigers had become, in large measure, a team 
of retreads and rejects. 
</P>
<P>
Hadn't Anderson led them to a division title in 1987 and to within one game of 
another in 1988? 
</P>
<P>
Wasn't he the first manager to win 100 or more games with two different teams 
and the first to win a World Series managing in two different leagues? 
</P>
<P>
Hadn't he inherited two dazzling groups of emerging talent and helped in their 
coalescence with his handling of pitching and role players and his ability to 
accept and deflect the media pressure? 
</P>
<P>
Didn't he win five division titles, four pennants and two World Series with the 
Reds, then lead the Tigers to an average of 92 victories per season over six 
years before 1989? 
</P>
<P>
"When we won the division in '87 with a mediocre club and missed winning by 
only a game with an even more mediocre club in '88 and everyone in baseball was 
asking 'How the hell did you do it?,' my ego got away from me," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that if I could win with the '87 club, I could do anything. Then, when 
we started losing last year, I took it personally. I got so embarrassed I 
didn't even want to go on the field." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson took his medical leave and thought about quitting. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I'd go back and finish the year, but I thought it would be my last -- 
at least in Detroit," he said. "On three occasions I could have moved for more 
money and I knew there would be offers from clubs ready to win." 
</P>
<P>
Carol, his wife, cautioned Anderson against a premature decision and said that 
if he was going to leave the Tigers for money or to enhance his estimable 
record he would be bailing out and sacrificing his integrity. Anderson rested 
(sleeping 16 hours the first day home, 13 the next), played some golf, visited 
his grandchildren, thought about what his wife said and realized that it was 
time for George Anderson to step forward and defuse some of Sparky's ego. 
</P>
<P>
"As it turned out, last year was more than good for my life," he said. "It 
taught me about adversity and how to deal with it. I told Carol that I wish it 
had happened after my fourth or fifth year in Cincinnati, when I was riding so 
high. That would have knocked the pins out from under me and forced me to take 
a look at myself before my ego became so large. 
</P>
<P>
"As Carol said, I was acting like a spoiled little boy with all the success. I 
mean, I agree with Donald Trump that everyone needs an ego so that they are 
driven to do the best they can do, but no one should be consumed by ego to the 
point of believing they have to be the star of the show. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I think I've contributed to my teams with honesty, fairness and an 
understanding of pitching, but I'm no genius and I don't want to hear that I 
am. I didn't invent the game. There were a hell of a lot better before me and 
there will be a hell of a lot better after me. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, people talk about burnout, but I don't believe in it. It's what we do 
to ourselves. No one put me under the gun. I put myself under it with my ego." 
</P>
<P>
The lessons of 1989, Anderson said, have regenerated his drive, his interest in 
managing, his appreciation for the battlefield. He is no less a winaholic nor 
is he more comfortable with losing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, he is no longer embarrassed to lose to a better team, he 
understands that losing has to be lived with "or the alternative is to die," 
and he believes that he is a better manager for his players because he has more 
compassion for their periods of adversity, their failures. 
</P>
<P>
And he wants to ride it out and help turn it around in Detroit, hoping he 
continues to get three-year extensions when his current contract expires. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't leave until they tell me to leave, and I won't be mad then, nor will I 
go anywhere else to manage," he said. "I've had it all my way here. These 
people have never said no to me. Where else could I go and get that? I mean, 
when they don't want me any more, I'd like to stay home, play some golf and 
maybe do some color on the Angel or Dodger cables." 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Tigers finished last in the American League in earned-run average, 
last in saves, last in team batting, next to last in runs and ninth in 
fielding. The 1990 Tigers are headed in the same directions. Anderson said they 
could lose 90 or more games again or finish .500. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the potential to score runs and it looks like we're going to have to," 
he said, alluding to the suspect pitching. "I don't know how many games you can 
realistically count on winning when you know you have to keep scoring five or 
more runs to do it, but I can live with it now because I know the direction 
we're heading in is to develop kids." 
</P>
<P>
"I know it's possible to have another tough season but I don't care how bad it 
gets. The important thing is to get every ounce we can out of every player, and 
go from there." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson became manager of the Tigers June 12, 1979. The core of a team that 
would finish .500 or better for 12 consecutive seasons was already at the 
varsity level or on the way. 
</P>
<P>
It is a startling fact, but of the current Tigers, only one -- relief pitcher 
Mike Henneman -- has come out of the system in the 11 years since Anderson was 
hired. 
</P>
<P>
And in those 11 years, in Anderson's view, the system has produced only three 
other bona fide major leaguers, all subsequently traded: Howard Johnson, Glenn 
Wilson and Mike Laga. 
</P>
<P>
Why the drought? 
</P>
<P>
Anderson and others cite a pair of pivotal factors: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Having finished fifth or lower in six of seven years starting in 1974, the 
Tigers were vested with advantageous draft positions and laid the groundwork 
for their future success by selecting, among others, Alan Trammell, Lou 
Whitaker, Kirk Gibson, Lance Parrish, Jack Morris and Dan Petry. That ensuing 
success resulted in the Tigers losing their draft position. From 1982 through 
1989 they did not draft higher than 15th, and five times were 20th to 26th. 
</P>
<P>
 -- On top of their poor position in the draft, the Tigers have obviously 
drafted poorly, the result, perhaps, of a disruption in continuity amid front 
office changes under owner Tom Monaghan. The Tigers have employed five scouting 
directors since Bill Lajoie left that position to become general manager in 
1983, each change producing a turnover in scouts. The Tigers have not had a No. 
1 selection reach the majors since pitcher Rich Monteleone, picked in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The absence of a productive system has been compounded by the refusal of pizza 
king Monaghan to deal in free agent dough. 
</P>
<P>
The signings last winter of Tony Phillips, Lloyd Moseby, Cecil Fielder and Ed 
Romero were strictly a necessity born of the 1989 decimation and not a serious 
indication that the policy is changing, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
That policy has been criticized by veterans such as Morris and Trammell, who 
have pointed out the devastating impact -- on the field and off -- of the 
departure of Gibson, Parrish and others as free agents, with the club getting 
virtually nothing in return. 
</P>
<P>
How all of this -- or any of it -- will change under Schembechler isn't clear. 
He isn't giving interviews during what he calls a period of indoctrination, but 
it appears that he is intent on being more than a figurehead and is determined 
to beef up the farm system. 
</P>
<P>
He has already provided each of the minor league clubs with video equipment and 
permanent coaches and, in the style of football recruiting, has made forays, 
along with Lajoie, into the homes of draft prospects to develop a feel for 
their character and commitment. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo has great leadership qualities, and I'm sure his enthusiasm will filter 
down and make people work harder and play harder," Lajoie said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's possible that a degree of complacency set in." 
</P>
<P>
In that regard, there is also a degree of concern that the new, lower key 
George Anderson has mellowed out and may not have the stomach for what are 
going to be difficult rebuilding years. 
</P>
<P>
"Sparky has had great success with good players who you only have to tell 
something once, but we now have some players who have to be reminded everyday," 
Lajoie said. "I'm not being critical, but I do think the atmosphere has to be 
jacked up. 
</P>
<P>
"There has to be more attention to fundamentals. The players have to be 
reminded of things more often, and some of the veteran players have to take 
more of a leadership role, which we discussed with them when they were signed 
to their big contracts." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said that he and his coaches understand their responsibility, the need 
to do more teaching and communicating. He said that lower key shouldn't be 
confused with timidity, that his 1989 sabbatical awakened a meanness in him, 
that his players know what will and won't be tolerated and that he is prepared 
for the task ahead. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that within the next two to three years there will be a 
significant turnover in playing personnel, that for the first time he can see a 
wide range of prospects on Detroit's horizon, though he is not predicting the 
Hall of Fame for any of them, resisting the hype he has laid on others. 
</P>
<P>
"I really feel I hurt some of those kids by what I predicted," he said. "I 
would again classify it as ego. I thought I could do anything. I thought I 
could make them into anything." 
</P>
<P>
After 20 years as a manager, he still has his goals. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to manage for at least 25 years because I think that says a lot, and 
I'd like to get one more win than Walter Alston because I think Walt would 
consider that a show of respect," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
The late Dodger manager, a friend and mentor to Anderson, had 2,040 career 
victories. Anderson entered the 1990 season with 1,758, 10th on the all-time 
list. 
</P>
<P>
The victories are coming less frequently, but Anderson insists he is prepared 
to cope with that.

DESPITE PAINFUL MEMORIES, BUDD FINDS HAPPINESS IN SOUTH AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If ever there was a place where a person could go to hide from the rest of the 
world, this would be it. Now, in the high summer, there is something desolate 
and scorched about it, lying dead in the center of southern Africa. It's as if 
Nature had been here once, but left in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
It might be the richest region in South Africa. Far under the earth lie fields 
of diamonds and vast veins of gold. The mining operations in the Orange Free 
State are the country's most extensive, with shafts running both vertically and 
horizontally. It is possible to imagine the ground under your feet as being 
hollow and your footsteps echoing in the ears of miners laboring below. 
</P>
<P>
This is where many Afrikaners found haven in the 19th Century -- driven north 
from the Cape Colony and the hated British. These Dutch-descended white 
settlers halted here, put down their Calvinist roots and set about the business 
of producing children who would become South Africa's ruling elite. 
</P>
<P>
Bloemfontein is the capital of the Orange Free State -- the most conservative, 
most insular of South Africa's four provinces. It is the home of the 
Afrikaners, the stubborn, hardy and proud people who view their province as a 
kind of oasis in a sea of madness. 
</P>
<P>
An enduring symbol of the Afrikaner is the laager, or protective circle of 
wagons, an effective method of defense while under attack. The image of the 
laager, if not the fact of it, lingers. 
</P>
<P>
Today, as then, Afrikaans is spoken here. It is the language that begat the 
word apartheid, or separateness. In the thick Afrikaans accent, the word is 
pronounced, APART-hate. 
</P>
<P>
This is where Zola Budd ran to when she could no longer run. Budd, one of the 
world's most reviled athletes, came home when, at last, she wanted no one to 
find her. The Free State swallowed her, and she was lost to the world. 
</P>
<P>
This is where she found herself again. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A JOURNEY BACK, A STEP FORWARD 
</P>
<P>
The directions were clear, but quite wrong. Take the Kimberly road for about 
one kilometer to Tarrel Road, then right. Look for the animal kennel on the 
corner. Follow the dirt road to the third house on the right, on Van Vuuren 
Laan. No address. 
</P>
<P>
There is no Tarrel Road exit off the N1. Every scrubby gravel street looks the 
same. All the low-slung ranch-style houses look identical. A check of the 
directions didn't help. They are clearly the product of a person to whom street 
names had less navigational value than local landmarks, much as a rural 
resident might helpfully explain, "Turn left down at the Miller place, by the 
old elm tree." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the animals give it away. Ducks, dogs, ostriches, cats, a menagerie 
roaming peacefully around the front yard. This is the home of Zola Budd 
Pieterse. A guest might not find this place easily, but the visitor is not 
unwelcome once here. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in a sunny living room, two cats on her lap, Budd tries to reconstruct 
the blocks of her life since she left England hurriedly in May of 1988, 
suffering from nervous exhaustion. At the time, Budd said she was retiring from 
international competition. 
</P>
<P>
Since returning to her home in Bloemfontein, Budd has watched the 
disintegration of her family, gotten married, resumed her running career and 
finally broken her long silence and denounced apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
And when attention had begun to wane, Budd was in the news again. Her father, 
Frank Budd, was found murdered last September, killed with his own shotgun. The 
killer told police that Budd, 56, had made homosexual advances toward him. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Budd, who had engineered his daughter's career and withheld huge sums of 
money from her, left specific instructions in his will that Zola be barred from 
his funeral. Further, he forbade her burial in the family plot. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all this and sporadic international curiosity, Budd, 23, says she is 
the most relaxed and happy she has ever been. She is at peace. 
</P>
<P>
"I finally feel settled," she said. "At the end of the day, I feel satisfied 
with what I've done. I don't feel I could have done more. I really enjoy just a 
normal life. It's nice to be normal. Being here is a relief from the pressure 
and attention from the press. It's a relief." 
</P>
<P>
The relief was welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Only months after her controversial collision with Mary Decker Slaney in the 
3,000 meters at the L.A. Olympics in 1984, in which she competed as a British 
citizen, Budd was once again the target of the international anti-apartheid 
lobby. Budd had returned to South Africa to seek treatment for a persistent leg 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
The International Amateur Athletic Federation, which governs track and field, 
discovered that while she was in South Africa, Budd had attended two road 
races. The IAAF found this to be in violation of its rule that forbids 
"participation" in competition in South Africa. After hearings in London, the 
IAAF recommended to the British track authorities that Budd be suspended for a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Something in her snapped. Running was the only thing that brought her 
happiness, and now she wouldn't be allowed to have that. Budd's London 
physician later reported that she was experiencing depression and long bouts of 
crying. He prescribed complete rest. He advised her to go home -- to South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
As Budd explained in her autobiography, "Zola," written last year with South 
African sportswriter Hugh Eley, "It came to a choice between running and life; 
I chose life." 
</P>
<P>
The life she came back to was much as it had been in the simple days of her 
youth. Budd grew up on a farm surrounded by animals. Today, she and her 
husband, wealthy liquor store owner Mike Pieterse, live in a modern but modest 
rural home with six dogs and three cats. 
</P>
<P>
Budd is doing what she has always wanted to do but was not allowed to do. 
Coming out of high school, she wanted to go to a technical college. Her 
domineering coach, Pieter Labauschagne, told her she was going to a university. 
Today, Budd is studying computer programming at a nearby technical college. 
</P>
<P>
Even her marriage was a kind of rebellion. Budd had met Pieterse casually in 
1986. Then, after she returned to South Africa, her sister Estelle arranged a 
dinner where the two would be together. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was a set-up," Budd said. 
</P>
<P>
The relationship grew steadily, but Budd was troubled. Having been betrayed in 
the past, she sought a commitment from Pieterse -- she proposed. 
</P>
<P>
"Feminism hasn't hit the Free State yet," she joked. "But Mike is very 
different from other men. I don't think it was a shock to him. I wouldn't have 
asked if I wasn't sure he would say yes. 
</P>
<P>
"I just felt I had to have some security. In past relationships with people, 
some have been intimidated by my success. But with him, it was quite the 
opposite. I came back and I wasn't running well. It didn't matter to him if I 
was running well. He's very patient and much better with people than I am. He 
takes life much easier than I do. I've met a lot of new people and made new 
friends through Mike, and that is quite nice. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just another environment. When you do athletics, all the people you know 
are other athletes. Sometimes it gets really boring. It's nice not to just talk 
about athletics. I think that's one of the things that really attracted me to 
him. Athletics was one of the subjects we never discussed." 
</P>
<P>
The wedding was April 15, 1989. Her mother, Tossie, her sisters and her 
brother, Quintus, were there. Frank Budd was not. Still estranged from her 
father, Zola had asked Quintus to give her away. But Frank Budd threatened to 
disinherit his son if that happened. In the end, Zola's father-in-law gave her 
away. 
</P>
<P>
The wedding generated enormous attention. For South Africans, the marriage of 
shy little Zola to "Mike, the big teddy bear," was the same as if the nation's 
youngest sister were getting married. The church was mobbed. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Budd did not attend and was quoted as saying, "I no longer have a 
daughter called Zola." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A STAR IS BORN -- AND EXPLOITED 
</P>
<P>
Budd has still not worked out her complex relationship with her father. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Budd ran a print shop, worked long hours and was seldom at home. One of 
Zola's warmest memories of her father was her tiny hand in his as he proudly 
marched her around after she had won a race in elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
Frank and Tossie Budd frequently quarreled. Frank, who spoke English, and 
Tossie, who spoke Afrikaans, would have each of their six children speak to 
them only in English. The Budds didn't share similar philosophical outlooks, 
either. Frank was liberal and outgoing, Tossie was conservative and retiring. 
They divorced in 1986 after 33 years of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
When Budd broke Mary Decker's world record at 5,000 meters by more than six 
seconds on Jan. 4, 1984 -- because she was a South African, Budd's time was not 
recognized as a record -- Frank Budd conceived, constructed and got behind the 
wheel of the great lumbering beast that was to become the Buddwagon. It made 
him rich. 
</P>
<P>
Within weeks after Zola's amazing race, in which she ran barefoot in the wind 
at altitude, Frank Budd and Zola's coach, Labauschagne, negotiated with 
representatives of the British tabloid, the Daily Mail. Because her paternal 
grandfather had been born in London -- and with the help of the Mail -- Budd 
was granted British citizenship in 13 days, receiving her passport on April 6, 
1984, only three months before the L.A. Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
The furor in England and abroad was immediate. Budd was criticized because of 
her "passport of convenience" and her status as a South African brought the 
anti-apartheid lobby into her life. 
</P>
<P>
Budd, then 17, hated her new life in England, away from her home and her 
animals. She begged to go back, but the adults around her -- with the exception 
of her mother, who also hated England -- told her she must see this thing 
through. 
</P>
<P>
At work were her father and coach. From her book: "Together with the Daily 
Mail, which arranged the cloak-and-dagger operation to get me to England in 
what was, for it, a massive and highly successful publicity stunt, they turned 
me into some kind of circus animal. I was expected to perform, and perform 
well, every time I put a foot on the track." 
</P>
<P>
The deal Frank Budd had negotiated was for 100,000 pounds, and it broke down 
this way: 20,000 in a trust fund for Zola, 20,000 for Pieter Labauschagne, 
5,000 each to Budd's brother and two of her sisters, and, notably, 45,000 for 
Frank Budd. Additionally, Frank Budd acted as his daughter's agent, taking 35% 
of the gross. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, Budd realizes she relied almost totally on the advice of her 
father and others and therein made critical mistakes. She also found that the 
Buddwagon was a cynical and cruel way to extort money from her. 
</P>
<P>
Budd made the gradual discovery that it was her running -- not her -- that was 
so loved by her father and coach. She says now that as a result she lost her 
ability to trust anyone for years. Budd has tried to work this out, but she has 
kept the pain as a souvenir. There are some lessons she doesn't want to forget. 
</P>
<P>
"When I ran well and everything was going well, they were interested," she 
said. "I think that was the main reason they were interested in me. I don't 
think it was a personal matter, or that they wanted to be involved with me as a 
person. It was the athletics. When that didn't fulfill all the potential they 
wanted, they just disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
"It was painful, especially with my coach, because we spent a lot of time 
together, seven years together. It was very difficult for me to handle that." 
</P>
<P>
Budd said she became aware that Labauschagne's loyalty was contingent on her 
performance when she ran poorly in England in 1986 and returned to South Africa 
with an injury. Labauschagne told Budd she was faking the injury and told her 
to get back to Europe and run. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when I decided he was not interested in me," she said. "The point is, 
you need a coach when you are running well, but when you really need a coach is 
when you are not running well. That's the time when you need people." 
</P>
<P>
Budd's estrangement from her father was slow to build but exploded suddenly. 
They had a fight and she moved out of the house. She rarely spoke to him after 
that. Problems with her father put a strain on Budd's relationship with her 
brother, Quintus. He never understood what had happened between Budd and her 
father while she was living in England. He never knew about the problems with 
Zola's missing money. 
</P>
<P>
"Even now, it's very difficult for my brother to understand," Budd said. "I 
think, in a way, he still blames me for things that have happened between my 
mother and my father. Relations between us aren't as bad as they were between 
me and my father. He's still upset about everything. He's taking it very 
badly." 
</P>
<P>
The it Budd referred to was their father's murder and the subsequent 
allegations of his homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't seeing him before his death," she said. "It was quite hard for me to 
accept. I always hoped that one day we would have a reconciliation. It is a 
terrible thing not to have said, 'I love you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Budd learned from her sister the provisions in Frank Budd's will. She didn't 
attend the reading of the will. She did not attend the trial of Christian 
Johannes Botha Barnard, the 24-year-old who worked on Frank Budd's farm, "The 
Hope" near Bloemfontein. 
</P>
<P>
Barnard was charged with shooting Budd twice with Budd's shotgun, then stealing 
Budd's truck and checkbook. Barnard testified that Budd had made derogatory 
remarks about the younger man's girlfriend and had, on the night of Sept. 30, 
made sexual advances toward him. 
</P>
<P>
Barnard faced the death penalty, but the judge, citing "extenuating 
circumstances," sentenced Barnard to 12 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how she felt toward her father's killer, Budd said she had "sort of a 
neutral feeling." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SILENT NO MORE 
</P>
<P>
In January, Budd did something many people had wanted her to do for a long 
time. On a BBC television program, she gave her views about apartheid. She told 
the audience that she could never accept a political system that entrenches the 
superiority of one race over another. She said that, as a Christian, she 
believed that all people were created equal. Her country's system of apartheid 
was wrong, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The statement was astonishing not in that she held those beliefs, but in that 
she actually voiced them. For six years, ever since she had become a 
world-class runner, Budd had been asked her views on apartheid. For six years 
she had steadfastly refused to share her views, saying she was an athlete, not 
a politician. 
</P>
<P>
For her silence and because she failed to sever her ties to South Africa, Budd 
was made Public Enemy No. 1 by the world's anti-apartheid groups. She was 
picketed every time she ran, and the British team was threatened with boycotts 
at meets in which she took part. There was a simple way to defuse all this -- 
denounce apartheid. Budd refused. It was a revealing decision, for it showed 
her stubbornness and her willingness to fight, even in a battle she had little 
chance to win. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been quiet for so long, I just spoke my mind," Budd recalled, losing a 
battle to keep her kitten out of a photographer's bag. "In a way, it was a 
relief. I could finally say what I thought. But I still felt it was unfair for 
people to expect me to talk about politics. I have opinions, but they are 
private. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I didn't want to be forced into making political statements just 
because they wanted it. In a way, the whole time I was just a bit stubborn, 
because I didn't want to give in to their demands. I don't think you can ever 
win against the people who were as fanatical as the people I was up against, or 
even with the press."

Budd said that the reaction to her views in South Africa was mixed. She said 
she received hate mail from "the conservative elements," as she had previously 
been threatened by anti-apartheid groups. Nevertheless, she is not sorry she 
spoke her mind, especially given the political changes recently. 
</P>
<P>
"I think South Africa had to change," she said. "The time is right. I just hope 
people accept the changes and work together. I just hope South Africa survives 
as a country. You can expect violence from both sides, but I think it is time 
for people to accept what is happening, to accept what the opinion of the whole 
world is. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard here because it's been going on for so long. I'm 23 years old and I 
know nothing else. I've never seen an international running team in South 
Africa. So, from a practical side, it will be difficult for South Africa to 
adapt to the change. 
</P>
<P>
"To look back on it, the anti-apartheid people have been very -- not stupid, 
but I think if they had allowed (South African) blacks to compete overseas and 
not the whites, it would have been much harder for people here. Changes would 
have come much quicker." 
</P>
<P>
Budd recently began to compete here, at a low-key level. She understands that 
by doing that, under the present rules, she has made herself ineligible to 
compete internationally, even though she still holds a British passport. But 
she won't miss it. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I think I have seen it all and been through it all," she said. "I realize 
now how artificial everything was. Running, although it is a sport, is very 
artificial. You run well today and tomorrow is the next day and you have to 
perform well all over again. When I look back on three years of running, I 
don't really feel I have achieved a lot, especially not as a person. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all right, running well. But at the end of the day you have to satisfy 
your own needs. Looking back on it, it was a very boring time. I got 
overwhelmed by just doing athletics. 
</P>
<P>
"If something reckless happened, and South Africa was allowed back into the 
Olympics tomorrow, and the opportunity arose for me to run a few meetings, I 
might do it. But on the other hand, I would be very careful not to let 
athletics take over again. Not to run because I have to but because I enjoy it. 
There is always the balance. 
</P>
<P>
"Running is something that is a part of my life. In the past, it was the only 
thing and I had to do it well. So it's really nice now, if I don't run well 
today I'll come home and just forget about it. There are so many other things 
to do now. I enjoy running, but I'm far from my best of a few years ago. It's 
not important for me to run well again. I don't want running to take over my 
life as it once did." 
</P>
<P>
Budd might have accepted this, but the people of South Africa yearn for their 
Zola to beat the world again, so that, through her, they become winners. Budd 
tells them to look elsewhere for a symbol. 
</P>
<P>
"People seem to take it for granted that I am going to run well again and that 
I am going to achieve," she said, sighing. "It's something I'll just have to 
cope with. When people ask me what my future plans are, I reply that I just 
don't know. I'll take it as it comes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE LONG ROAD HOME 
</P>
<P>
The road that leads away from Zola Budd's home is easier to find than the one 
that leads to it. There is an airport close by and the town. There is a world 
beyond Bloemfontein and the Orange Free State and even beyond the borders of 
this isolated country. 
</P>
<P>
Zola Budd has seen what lies beyond. And that is what has driven her back here. 
You get the impression that after losing herself out there, she has found 
herself again here, and that she doesn't ever want to leave again. 
</P>
<P>

BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Because of its policy of apartheid, or racial separation, South Africa has been 
shunned by the international sporting community. It has been banned from the 
Olympics since 1960 and international sporting codes prohibit South African 
athletes from competing anywhere outside their country and impose lengthy bans 
on any athlete who competes in South Africa.
