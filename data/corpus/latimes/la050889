NEWSMAKERS: A FUNNY THING HAPPENED TO THE HAVERHILL CLASS OF '40

 -- Captured forever young in the pages of the "Archie" comics, graduates of 
the class of 1940 of Haverhill High School in Massachusetts gathered to 
reminisce and speculate on just who was the inspiration for the beloved 
teen-agers Betty, Veronica, Jughead and others who populated classmate Bob 
Montana's hugely popular comics. Rita Walker, who lived two streets away from 
Montana, said she recognized the school almost immediately when freckle-faced 
Archie Andrews and his friends burst on the American comic scene in 1941, 
driving high school principal Mr. Weatherbee crazy and hanging out at The 
Chok'lit Shop. "The Chocolate Shop -- we all knew darn well where the Chocolate 
Shop was. He (Montana) used to go there all the time and draw cartoons on 
napkins," Walker said. Then there was a blushing Arnold Daggett, whose white 
crew cut and square-jawed face looked a lot like Moose, the comic football 
hero. Montana's widow, Peggy Bertholet, recalled Archie's friend Jughead was a 
composite of some of Montana's close friends in high school, and Veronica Lodge 
was all the blue-blooded girls he met in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The influential and the uncelebrated walked side by side through the 
streets of Boston, Brookline, Newton and Cambridge to raise $3.5 million in 
pledges in the 20th annual Walk for Hunger. Among the 35,000 participating were 
Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy, Boston Mayor 
Raymond Flynn and Cardinal Bernard Law, the Roman Catholic archbishop of 
Boston. Also among the marchers was Granton Dowse, 78, of Weston, who was 
attempting to retain his title as the top individual fund-raiser. Last year, he 
collected nearly $20,000 in pledges. "I find it is much easier to get people to 
give if they have given before," said Dowse, who counts folk singer Livingston 
Taylor among his donors. "One man nine years ago gave me $20, a dollar a mile. 
He kept (raising) it . . . . This year, he sent me a check for $400."

 -- Romance took a back seat to revolution in his youth, Libyan leader Moammar 
Kadafi revealed in an interview with Abu Dhabi television in the United Arab 
Emirates. Kadafi overthrew the Libyan monarchy in 1969 at age 27, expelling 
U.S. and British troops. "I did not have any love affair then. I imposed a 
strict regime on myself and kept away from anything that might interfere with 
the planned revolution," said Kadafi, who is now the father of seven. ANN

CENTRAL AMERICANS TURN TO COURIERS TO SEND MONEY HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Being separated from her children is painful, but Maria del Carmen Chang draws 
some solace by sending a little money home each month so her son and three 
daughters can buy themselves a small toy, school supplies or a dress. 
</P>
<P>
The 41-year-old housekeeper earns a modest $100 a week but still manages to 
make regular visits to the offices of an express courier service in the 
Westlake area that sends money orders and small packages to Guatemala City 
almost overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Chang said she felt guilty because she could scrape together "only $75" to send 
to her children, the youngest of whom is 3 years old. "I've been here for more 
than a year, and I haven't seen them," she said in Spanish in a tone of deep 
resignation. "You come here to work, and that's the way life is." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
500 Central Americans a Day 
</P>
<P>
Others filtered into the office during a recent Sunday morning, including a few 
more housekeepers, a Salvadoran construction worker and a welder who said he 
was sending half of his most recent paycheck to Guatemala as a Mother's Day 
gift. 
</P>
<P>
In all, about 500 Guatemalan and Salvadoran immigrants come each day to the 10 
offices of Garza Express, one of half a dozen courier express chains that have 
become a fixture in Los Angeles' Central American community. 
</P>
<P>
According to university researchers, the courier agencies are among the fastest 
growing businesses in the city. But they are themselves only the most visible 
sign of the ever-growing flow of money and consumer goods sent home by Latino 
immigrant workers, many of them here illegally. 
</P>
<P>
Added together, the immigrants' money orders of $75, $100 or $200 are not 
exactly small change. Economists estimate that "remittances" by immigrants in 
the United States to El Salvador alone total from $500 million to $1 billion 
each year, a greater source of foreign exchange than coffee, the country's 
leading cash crop. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Remedy for Suffering 
</P>
<P>
With El Salvador suffering from a harsh civil war for almost a decade, and 
Guatemala going through one of its worst economic crises of the century, the 
payments and packages have taken on an added importance. A money order for a 
few hundred dollars can help a family make a rent payment and a package of 
clothes can keep children warm in the winter. 
</P>
<P>
"In most cases they send the money back home and the money is used for 
immediate needs," said Norma Chinchilla, a professor of sociology at Cal State 
Long Beach. "It's phenomenal the amount they squeeze out of their meager 
earnings to support their relatives." 
</P>
<P>
Getting that money home, however, has always presented something of a problem, 
because the postal services in Central America are notoriously inefficient. 
</P>
<P>
Immigrant entrepreneurs have stepped into this void in the last few years by 
creating courier services. Nora Hamilton, a political science professor at USC 
who recently completed a study of local Central American businesses with 
Chinchilla, said the courier chains have at least 30 offices in and around Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Business was brisk at Garza Express in Westlake, where customers dressed in 
their Sunday best stood at the counter and quickly wrote letters to send along 
with their money orders. Typically, the charge is about $10. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Money to Mother 
</P>
<P>
"This week, I'm sending money to my mother," said Victor Morales, a welder 
whose letter home to Guatemala included a money order for $130 -- to help his 
family "cover costs" -- and some snapshots of a reunion with his brother in 
Monterey Park. "Next week, it's my wife's turn." 
</P>
<P>
Blanca Lucho, a 24-year-old housekeeper, sent home a package that included a 
money order for $150 and a few gifts for her mother, whom she has not seen 
since coming here in 1984. Inside the small "CARE package" was a pair of dress 
shoes, a change purse, a pincushion in the shape of a heart, and two small jars 
of cold cream and B-12 vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
Because the housekeeper's package was headed for Guatemala City, chances were 
it would reach its destination quickly, said Garza Express office manager 
Franklyn Marquez. But the same cannot be said for packages and letters sent to 
the remote jungle and mountain areas of Guatemala, or to the countryside in El 
Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
"We deliver anywhere in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. That's what makes 
us unique." Marquez said. "Unfortunately, there are places where our couriers 
can't get through." 
</P>
<P>
To prove his point, Marquez produced a small stack of returned envelopes, 
covered with the scrawled messages of frustrated couriers: "Couldn't deliver -- 
war zone," and "the guerrillas wouldn't let me pass." 
</P>
<P>
Another chain, Pipil Express, has solved the problem of delivery to El 
Salvador's war zones by announcing the arrival of the money orders and packages 
on local radio stations so that the recipients can pick them up in the relative 
safety of a regional post office, said manager Mauricio Saravia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Friends the Best Couriers 
</P>
<P>
Although more and more Central American immigrants seem to be using the courier 
services, many say the preferred way to send money and packages home is with a 
friend returning to the home country. 
</P>
<P>
Invariably, flights from Los Angeles International Airport to Central America 
are filled with passengers carrying television sets, blenders, skateboards and 
every other type of small appliance or toy that can fit into a box or suitcase. 
</P>
<P>
Among those waiting for TACA Airlines Flight 511 to depart on one recent 
evening for San Salvador and Guatemala City was Antonio Hernandez, a 
38-year-old Salvadoran construction worker. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez was not a passenger on the flight, but his friend Jose Pablo 
Villatoro was. Hernandez explained that Villatoro was doing him the favor of 
taking a stereo to his relatives. 
</P>
<P>
"When someone travels, you take advantage of the opportunity," Hernandez said. 
"It's the cheapest way to send things home." 
</P>
<P>
Villatoro was traveling alone to San Salvador with six large boxes and two 
suitcases. They were packed, he said, with clothes and more stereo equipment 
for his own family. "When you have a chance to buy things, you have to share 
with people there who don't have that chance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some passengers packed their suitcases and boxes over the weight limit and were 
told by airline officials they would have to rearrange their luggage into 
smaller, lighter boxes that wouldn't strain the backs of the luggage handlers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to take out 20 pounds, we have to take out more," said Edwin Torres as 
he helped his friend, Teresa Henriquez, unload clothes from an overstuffed box. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's take out the microwave," he said finally, lifting the brand-new 
appliance from underneath several layers of dresses, pants and blouses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Last Obstacle 
</P>
<P>
Once they arrived in Central America with their booty, the passengers of Flight 
511 would face one last obstacle -- local customs officials. Stiff customs 
duties are designed to protect the local economy from foreign competition. But 
most of the passengers on Flight 511 said they could easily avoid any duties by 
bribing an official. 
</P>
<P>
Nor are the Central American governments likely to try and stop the flow of 
dollars into their countries. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good for the families but the money helps the economy, too," said 
Hamilton of USC. "The money has to be changed to the domestic currency and the 
government eventually gets the dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Helping the economy, however, seemed to be far from the minds of most of the 
immigrants who came to Pipil Express on Vermont Avenue last week. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation is very difficult over there," said Jose Fernando Castaneda, 33, 
a native of Usulutan in eastern El Salvador. His money order would help his 
parents buy food and plant crops on their farm, he said. "At least with what I 
send home, life is better for them."

GUY WILLIAMS, TV'S 'ZORRO,' FOUND DEAD 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guy Williams, the actor who played Zorro in the popular 1950s Walt Disney 
television series of the same name, apparently suffered a heart attack and died 
in his apartment, police said Sunday. He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' body was found by police at his home in the exclusive residential 
neighborhood of La Recoleta. He apparently died about a week ago, the 
government news agency Telam reported. 
</P>
<P>
An investigation was begun to confirm the cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, whose real name was Armando Catalano, was born in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"Zorro" recounted the adventures of Diego de la Vega, a meek young aristocrat 
in colonial California who donned black cape, mask and bullwhip to become a 
"Robin Hood," who stood up for the rights of the citizenry against the abuses 
of Spanish overlords. 
</P>
<P>
Williams also starred as Prof. John Robinson in the 1960s television show "Lost 
in Space," portraying the leader of a family marooned on a remote planet. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was a frequent visitor to this South American capital and had 
apparently lived here alone for several months. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate word on survivors or funeral arrangements.

STUDENTS WORK OUT RACIAL RIFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As major school activities go, picking up litter in the East San Diego 
neighborhoods surrounding Crawford High School last month was fairly 
low-profile. 
</P>
<P>
But, for the 25 or so students with their green trash bags, the mid-morning 
exercise was an important, albeit small, step in both rebuilding the school's 
tarnished image and improving racial tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
After an hour of cleaning up lawns and curb gutters, the students adjourned for 
a hot-dog barbecue to continue informal conversations that administrators hope 
will break down stereotypes among the whites, blacks, Latinos and Indochinese 
who people the campus in large numbers. 
</P>
<P>
The push toward getting students to get along better with each other -- if not 
necessarily to always like each other -- has been given a higher priority at 
Crawford since incidents last fall when racial fighting broke out between 
Indochinese and other ethnic groups, in particular blacks. The fighting was 
touched off by an off-campus shooting in which one student was slightly 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
The media attention caught Crawford students and faculty off guard, and, 
although they protested that such tension is not unique to their campus, they 
also acknowledged that Crawford was not doing enough to minimize it. 
</P>
<P>
After the immediate furor calmed and administrators put a damper on the rumor 
network that usually follows school conflicts, Principal 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Shelburne convened a student leadership 
</P>
<P>
group, with members chosen for their leadership ability and influence with 
peers. 
</P>
<P>
The group now meets regularly to discuss racial issues, plan campus activities, 
improve student-police relations, all within the context of avoiding situations 
similar to what happened in October. Counselors from the Urban League and from 
the Indochinese Mutual Assistance Assn. have worked with black and Indochinese 
students to explore ways to lessen ethnic animosity. 
</P>
<P>
There have been signs of progress, many measured in small increments such as 
persuading students to let a fight, if one breaks out, to take place 
one-on-one, without friends and supporters of the two antagonists choosing up 
sides and turning an incident into a racial free-for-all. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've made some sort of change with our group," Crawford student Tony 
Pordullo said while picking up litter with a couple of friends he invited along 
for the activity. "Sure, not everyone likes others, and the hardest thing is to 
get everyone together and realize that we're all equal, even if you think some 
people are better." 
</P>
<P>
The group scheduled the litter pickup after some students suggested that, if 
they could show more pride in their school and neighborhood, perhaps that might 
rub off on student attitudes about each other as well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Talking About Things 
</P>
<P>
"We are students who have a lot of friends, and who talk about things to other 
friends," said student Anthony Wise. "We talk about gangs, about graffiti, 
about stereotypes, about all sorts of things." 
</P>
<P>
While bending down for a beer can, Wise pointed to the "SWP" painted on a 
manhole cover a block away from Crawford. The phrase stands for "student white 
power." 
</P>
<P>
"Something like that, that's how fights get started," Wise said. "And it gives 
the entire student body here a bad name, it ruins things for the rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
Many students stressed the "code of honor" that they are trying to establish 
when fights do break out. 
</P>
<P>
"Fights should be one-on-one," Andrew (A. J.) Hinton said. "If we can limit to 
two rather than a whole group or gang, I think that really helps." 
</P>
<P>
But Hinton, a senior, has also tried to get his friends to understand that 
feelings do not have to be carried out in physical challenges, especially 
between blacks and Indochinese. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a language problem," Hinton said, referring to the large numbers of 
Indochinese, mainly Cambodian students, who are not yet fluent in English. 
School district human relations counselors found that some of the animosity 
last fall stemmed from a basic lack of communication. 
</P>
<P>
"If I drop my pencil and a (Indochinese) tries to tell me I did so, it's 
sometimes hard for me to figure out what he's saying . . . it all depends on 
how you handle the situation. It can be laughter -- an ice-breaker -- or 
tension. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I May Not Understand' 
</P>
<P>
"If someone steps on my foot accidentally in the hall, he may apologize but I 
may not understand so you have to smile, use your hands maybe, to show that 
everything is OK, just say 'excuse me.' Otherwise, there's immediate tension, 
and then there's a fight." 
</P>
<P>
Added senior class president Charma Hendricks: "It's hard for us at first to 
understand the life style of the Indochinese." The Indochinese students, 
especially those not yet comfortable with English, are less likely to take part 
in non-academic programs and are sometimes seen as working too hard in school. 
Many non-Asian students have little knowledge of the harrowing experiences that 
these refugees went through in escaping to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Although Crawford students are making an effort at better interpersonal 
relations, some of their younger peers at neighboring Mann Middle School are in 
the midst of some of that school's worst racial antagonism in several years. 
</P>
<P>
Principal Maruta Gardner said that, during the past two weeks, about 15 Asian 
and 15 black males have been involved in periodic fighting, casting a pall over 
the school's atmosphere. Although the students have been placed in counseling 
-- and some have been expelled or transferred to other schools -- name-calling 
and stare-downs have continued at lunch time and during passing periods, and 
some confrontations have taken place after school. Gardner called in parents of 
the students on Friday to impress upon them the volatility of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner traced the latest problems to an incident in which several black 
students beat up a Vietnamese student in retaliation for what they said was a 
black student being harmed by Indochinese in nearby Colina del Sol park after 
school. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Never-Ending Problem' 
</P>
<P>
"And these kids are going to be going to Crawford from here," Gardner said. 
"It's just a never-ending problem we have to work on." Mann has been praised in 
past years for positive effects of its race/human-relations program -- which 
all schools are required to take -- but the teacher responsible for 
coordinating multi-ethnic activities was promoted to another district position 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
"So a lot of the program just died," Gardner said, referring to "lunch bunch" 
groups in which teachers volunteered to sit down over lunch with students and 
talk about any and all problems that they had with classes or with one another. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that we don't have them this year, because you can't force 
teachers to do it, and I think it has made a (negative) difference in the tone 
at the school," Gardner said. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner has called in black and Indochinese counselors from the school district 
to sit down with the most active combatants, in a manner similar to what Urban 
League and Indochinese Mutual Assistance counselors began doing at Crawford 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
"Counseling cannot guarantee that things will get better, but at least 
Cambodian students will come to understand the situation better," said Senyint 
Chim, a district counselor who has been talking with Crawford students. 
</P>
<P>
"You try to explain that fighting, responding with force, is not going to solve 
the problem of attacks and that they should instead come to the counseling 
office and try and get help that way," Chim said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anti-Black Conditioning 
</P>
<P>
Chim believes many Cambodian students are conditioned to see blacks 
unfavorably, in part simply because the Khmer Rouge, who killed up to 1 million 
Cambodians in the late 1970s when they ruled the country, wore black. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, they do not see many blacks in positive roles in America, and they also 
believe that most of the robberies in their East San Diego neighborhoods are 
committed by blacks," Chim said. "They don't see many bad white guys robbing 
them, so stereotypes get established real quick. 
</P>
<P>
"I think solutions will come only slowly." 
</P>
<P>
By the same token, Urban League program specialist Charles Howard said some 
black students do not understand the background of Asian students and the 
reasons they are reluctant to involve themselves in after-school programs such 
as dances and sports rallies. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those black students have had attendance and minor behavioral problems 
as well, leading to jealousies toward other students and a lack of self-esteem, 
which Howard's program is trying to address by arranging counseling and 
part-time employment. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite a few kids, 20 or so, have taken advantage of our offer to get them some 
work experience after school," Howard said, pointing to jobs offered by 
business like Pizza Hut and nonprofit organizations such as the YMCA. The Urban 
League is planning a larger Youth Employment Partnership Program, in 
coordination with other social-service organizations, to try to turn more 
youths away from gangs and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Howard said students at Crawford and other schools are "not foreordained to 
clash" over ethnic differences, despite the continuing tension and 
misunderstandings. "They've got 1,600 kids at Crawford, and I see both a lot of 
kids mixing together and ethnic kids also hanging with their own, and all of 
that is normal behavior," he said.

OFF-ROADERS RIDE ROUGH TRAIL TO BETTER IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If there is a social group held in lower esteem by modern society than smokers, 
it has to be off-road vehicle enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
To the average motorist commuting to work through gasoline fumes, the idea of 
spending a weekend revving up a four-wheel drive for a bone-jarring trip 
through the sagebrush is unthinkable, and the specter of pre-adolescents 
roaring up and down the Glamis Dunes on balloon-tired three wheelers is cause 
to shudder. 
</P>
<P>
When the federal government recently proposed an off-road trail through the 
pristine Cleveland National Forest, backcountry residents rose up in wrath. 
</P>
<P>
And Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, with its thousands of arid acres, has 
barred dune buggies and other all-terrain vehicles, pointing to damage wrought 
to the fragile environment. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as a state legislative bill designed to allow off-road vehicles back into 
Anza-Borrego comes up for its first hearing Tuesday, off-road enthusiasts say 
they are suffering the effects of an outdated public image. No longer are they 
the madcap drivers of past decades, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Since the off-road vehicle craze began in the 1950s and grew to a frenzy with 
introduction of the all-terrain vehicle (ATV) in 1972, its adherents have grown 
up, they say. From a few hardy characters determined to conquer the rugged 
hillsides despite the cost, the off-roaders have matured into a well-organized 
group of more than 800,000 statewide, complete with rules, by-laws, a lobbyist 
and a healthy state bank balance derived from vehicle permits and gasoline 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Brown, a long-time San Diego off-roader, recalls a time a few years back 
when he and other ORV representatives assembled at the County Administration 
Center to meet with state and local authorities on the ill-fated plan to place 
an ORV park between Lakeside and Poway in Sycamore Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"We were waiting there, with our suits and ties and briefcases when some of the 
opposition came up and asked us who we were," Brown recalled. "When we told 
them we were the local off-road coalition, they were flabbergasted. 
</P>
<P>
"Those guys didn't believe that we were really off- roaders," Brown said, 
chuckling. "We weren't at all what they expected to see." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, their image remains as harebrained, "belligerent-looking troglodytes," as 
quoted in a recent issue of California Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Ham, lobbyist for California Off Road Vehicle Assn. (CORVA), considers the 
legislative hearing this week "a key one" because it will signal the support 
that off-roaders can expect from legislators and state agencies. 
</P>
<P>
However, he concedes that powerful environmental groups and local residents are 
lined up against the bill, and he is unwilling to predict the future of the 
controversial measure, which would force the state parks director to keep a 
promise off-roaders say he made two years ago to insure his reappointment to 
the post. 
</P>
<P>
Four-wheel drive vehicles, "street legal" autos licensed by the Department of 
Motor Vehicles, are allowed in the vast desert park and can cause just as much 
damage as ORVs, Ham pointed out. So, why the discrimination against 
off-roaders? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taking Unfair Blame? 
</P>
<P>
Lowell Landowski, grants administrator for the state Off-Highway Motor Vehicle 
Recreation Division, concedes that the off-roaders, especially ATV riders, may 
be taking the rap for past environmental damage in the same way a carrot-topped 
kid is picked out as the culprit in a school-ground tussle. 
</P>
<P>
The bright-colored, balloon-tired vehicles with their helmeted riders "are 
readily distinguishable," Landowski said, and may have taken the blame for the 
lower-profile, street-legal vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The problem might have been solved by better policing of the Anza-Borrego 
wilderness to rid the area of the rebels, rather than banning an entire class 
of recreational users, Landowski said. His department, however, opposes the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
Norm Noyes, U.S. Forest Service project manager for a proposed 37-mile ORV 
trail through the county's Cleveland National Forest, describes similar 
opposition to off-roaders during hearings about the project. He is sampling 
local opinion on the Sunshine ORV Trail which will wind from near El Capitan 
Reservoir dam north to near San Diego Country Estates and Ramona, then east 
past Sunshine Mountain to Boulder Creek Road. 
</P>
<P>
Noise, littering, vandalism, environmental impact and myriad other concerns 
have been voiced at three "scoping" meetings Noyes has held in the back country 
and in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
He defends the project as consistent with federal policies to open up federal 
lands for the enjoyment of people, and points out that the trail would be a 
narrow, challenging course designed for sturdy vehicles at low speeds, not the 
straight-aways, hill-climbs and open areas that attract off-road daredevils on 
three-wheeled ATVs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
At Least 5 Years 
</P>
<P>
Noyes estimates that it will be about five years before the Sunshine Trail 
becomes a reality because of the time-consuming process involved in public 
hearings and environmental impact studies, and, in part, because of the growing 
opposition to the project. 
</P>
<P>
Parts of the trail may have to be rerouted to avoid residential areas and some 
land may have to be acquired to buffer the adjoining private property from the 
ORV trail, Noyes said. 
</P>
<P>
The route now runs within a quarter of a mile of expensive homes in San Diego 
Country Estates and even closer to Barona Indian Reservation land. Both groups 
have objected as have the Sierra Club, the Audubon Society and other 
environmental protection organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who has retired from active ORV sport but continues to champion the 
cause, points out that San Diego County has about 200,000 off-road riders 
divided roughly into two groups: those who ride for the thrill of it and those 
who ride to explore new places. 
</P>
<P>
There are trails for horsemen and hikers. So, Brown asks, why not trails for 
off-roaders? 
</P>
<P>
There are a number of trails and ORV riding areas in the county -- ranging from 
the giant sandbox called Ocotillo Wells State Vehicular Recreation Area in the 
extreme northeastern part of the county to Lark Canyon and Corral Canyon, two 
Bureau of Land Management ORV sites in the rugged southeastern sector of the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
Off-roaders can ride without interference on dozens of truck trails in the 
Cleveland National Forest and on other government lands. Less than legal but 
popular is a network of trails and hills on Otay Mesa, which can be reached 
from Interstate 805 at Palm Avenue. This, the only ORV area that can boast its 
own freeway off-ramp, will soon give way to housing tracts. 
</P>
<P>
To the east, where Otay Mesa rises into the mountains, county and state 
officials are quietly negotiating with a private landowner to acquire a sizable 
tract for ORV activities. The project, near a proposed border race track for 
motorized vehicles, may fall prey to rising land prices in the area. Property 
which once could have been purchased for $4,000 to $6,000 an acre now lies 
within a mile of land selling for $50,000 and more an acre. 
</P>
<P>
More certain is the acquisition of the Fadam Ranch adjacent to Lark Canyon ORV 
areas in the McCain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Isn't Enough 
</P>
<P>
Even with the advent of the Sunshine Trail, the addition of two more ORV sites 
and the on-going expansion of the Ocotillo Wells area, San Diego will still be 
short of ORV recreational space. Eighty percent of the state's ORV enthusiasts 
reside in Southern California and San Diego County ranks second only to Los 
Angeles County in the number of ORV owners. 
</P>
<P>
Brown admits that some of the blame lies with the off-roaders, past and 
present, who have alienated the citizenry with their freewheeling ways. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lesson we have learned that the jet skiers would be wise to follow," 
Brown said. "If there is a law, obey it. If you don't like it, let's change 
it." 
</P>
<P>
He sees in the unregulated jet ski craze the same problems which the 
off-roaders brought upon themselves: unregulated activities causing accidents 
and incidents, the spotlight of the press focusing on each accident and injury, 
and an increasingly hostile public. 
</P>
<P>
"Soon, legislation is coming down (on jet skiers) and if they don't organize 
and get with it, they will be in trouble," Brown said. It's much better to set 
your own rules and police them than to live by the laws set down by 
unsympathetic legislators, he said, speaking from experience. 
</P>

SAMUELSON ON ADOLESCENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bravo to Samuelson for his column! He succinctly gathered up all the loose ends 
and tied up the demise of our American education system into one bundle of 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
I've been substituting in many of the local high school districts and the story 
is essentially the same. With too few exceptions, I find the attitudes of 
youngsters in general disrepair. They lie, cheat, and try desperately to get 
away with the least effort, if any at all. They are mean and self-centered. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, these ugly traits stem from an indifferent society. Parents, 
generally, no longer ask their children what they did in class that day, or 
what homework was due the next day, or what they are doing in the way of 
"giving" positively to the betterment of their classes and school environment. 
</P>
<P>
I wish that teachers were able to send back to parents, for perusal, students' 
results of writing assignments. They'd throw up! Or should! But, then again, 
psychologist Harold Stevenson, through his research, concluded, "Americans 
score lower in achievement but, with their parents, are more satisfied with 
their performance." How sad!

We are certainly a most accommodating people: Not one word of complaint has 
been heard concerning the obvious collusion of all major coffee manufacturers 
who now sell us 13 ounces of coffee in the same size can that once held a full

Sometimes a little higher.

NUCLEAR ARMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am amazed at the inflexibility of the Administration in refusing to take 
maximum advantage of the changing situation with regard to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
We could be saving literally trillions of dollars, balancing the budget, 
reducing debt, embarking on the provision of low-income housing, undertaking 
national health insurance plans, cleaning up the environment, building new 
transport systems and sidewalks, burying the "wirescapes" on our highways, 
engaging in huge rehabilitation and technical training enterprises, 
teacher-improvement programs etc. -- the list is endless. If only we would wake 
up to the opportunity that now presents itself. 
</P>
<P>
Mikhail Gorbachev has declared: 
</P>
<P>
* No one could win a nuclear war today. He is right. So why build more 
missiles? 
</P>
<P>
* The Soviet Union can no longer sustain hegemony, world revolution, or even a 
massive domestic police force or army. (Neither can any nation). Gorbachev is 
ruthlessly cutting back on costly aggressive arms projects. 
</P>
<P>
* We have enough power already to destroy the world 20 times over. Why on earth 
do we need any more? It is total insanity to spend one more dollar on nuclear 
arms. (Perhaps it could be argued that we need to deploy a few to less 
detectable or mobile positions for insurance purposes, but spending billions on 
new ones?) 
</P>
<P>
We need to seize this golden opportunity to further peace and to consider the 
welfare of the whole human race.

THE CURTAIN PARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic," said Winston Churchill 
in a famous speech 43 years ago, "an iron curtain has descended across the 
continent" of Europe. His metaphor quickly passed into the language of global 
politics, even as the somber reality it described continued to unfold. By 1948 
Hungary and Czechoslovakia were forced to join Poland, eastern Germany, Romania 
and Bulgaria within the Soviet Union's orbit of dominance, and the physical 
barriers that were erected to seal in the peoples of eastern Europe year by 
year deepened. As recently as 1961, with the Berlin Wall, harsh new steps were 
taken to intensify the forced separation of East and West. But now, in a 
significant gesture, at least one section of the iron curtain is starting to 
come down. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary has begun to dismantle the 8-foot-high electrified barbed-wire fence 
that it built 40 years ago along 160 miles of its border with Austria. By the 
end of next year the fence and the grim watchtowers that guarded against 
frontier cross-ings by Hungarians are expected to be gone. The border with 
Austria won't be completely open; Hungarian authorities have made clear that 
military patrols will go on. But major impediments to cross-border movement -- 
and, symbolically, to political openness -- will be removed. 
</P>
<P>
It would be unrealistic to expect that the other Communist states abutting 
western Europe will take similar action soon. The governments of Czechoslovakia 
and East Germany remain implacably opposed to the kind of political reforms 
taking place in Hungary, Poland and, to a lesser extent, the Soviet Union. 
Later this year, Hungary says it intends to hold multiparty elections; it is 
even conceivable, if not likely, that the ruling Communist Party could find 
itself on the short end of the vote count. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary says it didn't consult with its Warsaw Pact allies, including the 
Soviet Union, before beginning to turn its part of the iron curtain into scrap 
metal. That is yet another sign of increasing independence in a time of 
revolutionary change.

SAMUELSON ON ADOLESCENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The column of Robert J. Samuelson ("Our Style of Adolescence Is Now a Type of 
Curse," Op-Ed Page, April 21) covers the declining level of the public schools 
in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Very interesting is the fact that Samuelson is writing not as a teacher, a 
member of a board of education, an interested parent or a politician, but as a 
columnist who writes about economic issues. 
</P>
<P>
The magic word, which I noticed he mentioned three times in his column, a word 
that I never read in the writings by members of the school system, is 
"homework": apparently high school students do less than one hour a day of home 
assignments. 
</P>
<P>
There are about six to eight hours between the time schools send the pupils on 
their merry way and bedtime (I don't dare to mention the weekend period) and 
what do the nice children do? Apparently the majority of them do nothing to 
further their education. 
</P>
<P>
Please, parents and educators, make them study, make them read, do it for the 
nation, and even more for the benefit of the children. 
</P>
<P>
After all, educated and knowledgeable children are the greatest heritage we can 
leave to our country.

SANTA CLARITA BRIDGE SPAT ESCALATES INTO FIGHT FOR THE FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What started out as a spat between two Santa Clarita neighborhoods over a 
proposed bridge has grown into a thorny political issue that could influence 
traffic planning in the young city for years to come, residents involved in the 
dispute say. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute could also affect a proposed road-tax initiative tentatively 
scheduled to appear on the November ballot, the residents say. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy centers on a bridge that would link Valencia with the Circle J 
development, a secluded community of 600 homes east of San Fernando Road. The 
bridge would cross San Fernando Road, railroad tracks and the Santa Clara 
River. It would connect Wiley Canyon Road, which comes to a dead end in 
Valencia, with Via Princessa, which comes to a dead end in Circle J. 
</P>
<P>
Circle J residents say the bridge would provide a badly needed second access 
for the development. When trains stop along the railroad tracks, they often 
block the lone entrance to the community. What would police or fire departments 
do, the residents ask, if trains blocked the tracks during a major emergency? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unwanted Traffic 
</P>
<P>
Valencia residents counter that the bridge would funnel unwanted traffic into 
their tranquil neighborhood and turn Via Princessa and Wiley Canyon into a 
major east-west artery. "You don't build a major expressway through a 
neighborhood," said Tamsie Irvan, a Valencia resident opposing the bridge. "You 
just don't do that." 
</P>
<P>
When the dispute erupted six weeks ago, each side accused the other of being 
selfish and insensitive. Hundreds of residents packed City Hall to hear the 
council debate the issue last month. 
</P>
<P>
Tempers cooled last week when city officials arranged a face-to-face meeting 
between leaders of the two groups. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until now, the majority of what's been said has been emotionally said," 
said Valencia resident Rusty Langston. "There were hate words going back and 
forth." 
</P>
<P>
But now, Langston said, Valencia residents will wait to hear a detailed 
explanation of how the bridge might affect their community. City traffic 
officials are scheduled to meet with Valencia and Circle J residents Tuesday 
before the City Council hears yet more testimony on the issue. The council is 
tentatively scheduled to decide May 23 whether to build the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Community Needs 
</P>
<P>
Keith McNally, a bridge proponent, said the bridge controversy demonstrates how 
the council must balance the needs of the community with the desires of a 
single neighborhood. Although the bridge may inconvenience residents near Wiley 
Canyon Road, it will provide a crucial link in the Santa Clarita Valley's poor 
highway system, he said. 
</P>
<P>
There are very few east-west thoroughfares in the valley, and the bridge would 
provide another link in the proposed highway system between Valencia and Canyon 
Country, McNally said. Eventually, planners hope to connect Via Princessa from 
Wiley Canyon Road to the Antelope Valley Freeway to create the new 
thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
The valley's unique traffic problems require everyone to make sacrifices, he 
said. "I think it's important that we all share in the traffic burden." 
</P>
<P>
Circle J is willing to make its own sacrifices for the general good, McNally 
said. If Circle J gets its bridge, residents of the development will support 
plans for a major north-south artery -- Rio Vista Road -- which would pass 
uncomfortably close to Circle J homes, he said. One of the tentative routes 
proposed for Rio Vista would go through the development. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tolerable Inconvenience 
</P>
<P>
Circle J residents would rather see Rio Vista routed elsewhere, but they are 
willing to put up with the inconvenience, McNally said. The alignment of Rio 
Vista also is under study by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
If the council heeds the Valencia complaints and votes down the bridge, it will 
have little luck persuading Circle J to support Rio Vista, McNally said. Voting 
down the bridge would set a dangerous precedent because other neighborhoods, 
emboldened by Valencia's example, would try to block projects that would help 
the valley as a whole, he said. 
</P>
<P>
McNally and Circle J's developer, Watt America, also have said they would 
campaign for a proposed road tax that would add $75 to $200 to annual property 
tax bills. The measure, which requires a two-thirds vote for passage, would be 
used to build and improve roads throughout the Santa Clarita Valley, including 
Rio Vista. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council already has agreed to place the measure on the Nov. 7 ballot. 
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors still must agree to put the measure 
before the voters. 
</P>
<P>
But Irvan said approval of the bridge could motivate Valencia residents to 
oppose the road tax. Compared to other parts of Santa Clarita, Valencia's 
traffic problems are minimal because the community lies conveniently close to 
Interstate 5. Road projects supported by the tax would only siphon more traffic 
into Valencia, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should we allow traffic to be siphoned through here in an insane way?" she 
asked.

OFFICIALS TO PUSH CONSTRUCTION SITE FENCE ORDINANCE; 
</P>
<P>
DISCOVERY OF MORE DANGEROUS HOLES TRIGGERS CALL FOR STRICT SAFETY RULES 
</P>

<P>
The discovery of additional open construction shafts in the neighborhood where 
a Woodland Hills man was trapped in a 30-foot-deep hole has prompted Los 
Angeles officials to hurry efforts to beef up security around building sites. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators of the city's Department of Building and Safety said they will 
ask the City Council to amend the building code to require developers to fence 
in construction areas that contain holes deeper than three feet. 
</P>
<P>
The move came as city inspectors discovered dozens of deep "caisson" shafts -- 
some only partially covered by loose plywood -- at a hilly construction site in 
the 4200 block of Canoga Avenue last week. 
</P>
<P>
The holes are being drilled into bedrock to hold steel beams that will support 
two luxury homes planned for the hillside site a mile south of the Ventura 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The construction site is several hundred yards from an Ensenada Drive lot where 
22-year-old Ronald Costello slipped into the 30-foot hole two weeks ago. He was 
trapped in the 20-inch-wide shaft for 40 minutes until he was rescued by Los 
Angeles firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Next Door to Site 
</P>
<P>
Costello, who lives next door to the construction site, slid feet-first into 
the hole shortly after nightfall while showing his aunt the wreckage of a drill 
that had earlier tumbled down the hill and ripped out electrical and telephone 
lines to the house they share. 
</P>
<P>
After Costello's close call, building and safety officials discovered that 23 
holes had been drilled on the site to hold supports for a planned 
4,000-square-foot home. 
</P>
<P>
But when they were unable to locate the Ensenada Drive developers, officials 
took the unprecedented step of posting a 24-hour guard at the site to keep away 
other onlookers until the holes could either be securely covered or the lot 
could be fenced. After five days, the developers, identified by officials as 
Allan Villard, Berry Silva and Serafin Hezedia, were located. They erected a 
fence, and the guards were withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
Building and safety officials in Van Nuys say the developer of the Canoga 
Avenue lot was located within a day after inspectors visited the unoccupied 
construction area Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
After observing that some plywood covers were loose and others were broken, the 
inspectors ordered further digging halted until the holes were properly 
covered. The developer, identified by officials as Nicolette Schwartz, promised 
to comply immediately, said Michael D. Tharpe, a principal city inspector. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Protection 
</P>
<P>
Building and safety administrators say the unguarded shafts underscore the need 
for additional protection at construction sites. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working on an ordinance that would require some form of fencing," said 
Warren V. O'Brien, the department's executive officer. "Whether we can get the 
support of the council, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Councilman Marvin Braude, who represents the Woodland Hills 
area, said he "will definitely support" such a law. 
</P>
<P>
The city's current hole-covering requirement is about 30 years old. It was 
added to the building code after the 1949 death of Kathy Fiscus, a 3 
1/2-year-old who fell into an abandoned well in San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
The city lets builders decide how they want to secure trenches, shafts or 
construction pits. The most common method is to cover narrow holes with plywood 
weighted down with a small amount of dirt or sandbags. 
</P>
<P>
"But plywood, sandbags -- kids can move them. We think the best way is fenced," 
said O'Brien, who could not predict when council members will be asked to amend 
the code. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fencing Proposal 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners who live in the neighborhood where the shafts were discovered lauded 
the fencing proposal. But they also called for more rigorous inspections of 
building sites by the city, warning that numerous other hillside construction 
sites have similar caisson shafts. 
</P>
<P>
"There are children out there. We could have another Jessica on our hands 
here," said Lori Davis, referring to Jessica McClure, an 18-month-old Texas 
girl who was rescued from a well shaft in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who lives halfway between the two open shaft sites, charged that city 
officials had ignored neighborhood complaints about safety problems at the 
Canoga Avenue site over the past six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"They had these humongous holes and wouldn't cover them. I called building and 
safety, and they came out and we told them this is a slide area," Davis said. 
"But building and safety wouldn't do anything." 
</P>
<P>
However, there is no record of anyone calling the city to complain about 
problems at the Canoga Avenue construction site, said William King, a chief 
inspector at the Department of Building and Safety's San Fernando Valley office 
in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rely on the Public 
</P>
<P>
King said the Valley's building inspectors rely on the public to report safety 
problems in buildings and at construction sites. He said the Van Nuys office 
receives about 300 tips a year, including some that are made anonymously. 
</P>
<P>
"With 42 inspectors for the 200-square-mile Valley area, we don't have time to 
patrol," King said. 
</P>
<P>
The inspectors review about 45,000 permits of various kinds each year in the 
Valley. For a single-family house under construction, the inspectors will make 
between seven and 12 trips to the project site during a typical eight-month 
building period, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the first on-site inspection usually does not occur until excavations are 
filled in with freshly poured concrete foundation footings or when shafts are 
filled with partially completed steel caisson support systems, King said. 
</P>
<P>
Other inspections occur at intervals as inspectors check slabs, framing, rough 
electrical wiring and plumbing, insulation and drywall installation. A final 
inspection is done for the completed structure. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say inspectors are not required to visit construction sites 
until holes are being filled with foundation material. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expansive Soil 
</P>
<P>
Construction plans are drawn up by state-licensed architects and civil 
engineers who base their designs on studies made by similarly certified 
geologists and soils engineers. Those experts decide how deep hillside caissons 
must extend to reach bedrock and how thick foundations must be to handle some 
areas' expansive adobe soil. 
</P>
<P>
Building and safety plan checkers review them before issuing construction 
permits. Besides watching to make certain that the plans meet city building 
standards, the checkers also examine them to determine whether the proposed 
project meets neighborhood zoning and development restrictions, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Valley, there are about 70 localized restrictions and moratoriums that 
have been enacted by the City Council, said Robert Ayers, manager of the 
department's Van Nuys office. They range from building height limitations along 
Ventura Boulevard to minimum lot sizes in certain sections of Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"Each moratorium has different requirements, and they're all complex to begin 
with," Ayers said. "It becomes a challenge."

BANE RETURNS GIFT TO AVERT TAX RISK TO CITY OF HOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblyman Tom Bane (D-Tarzana) has returned a 1986 campaign contribution of 
$1,000 to the City of Hope National Medical Center because it may have 
jeopardized the hospital's tax-free status, worth millions of dollars a year. 
</P>
<P>
Bane, who serves on the Duarte institution's volunteer board of trustees and 
heads a foundation that supports research at the City of Hope, returned the 
money late last month after The Times inquired about the contribution. Bane's 
campaign committee had listed it on a March, 1986, campaign report filed with 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
The episode occurred amid controversy over the aggressive political 
fund-raising tactics of Bane and his wife, Marlene, who handles fund-raising 
for Bane and Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) in Southern 
California. Both lawmakers have raised millions of dollars in recent years, 
much of which has been used to support Democratic Assembly candidates who back 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Valentine's Day Dinner 
</P>
<P>
City of Hope President Sanford M. Shapero was solicited to buy tickets to 
Bane's annual $500-a-person Valentine's Day dinner in 1986 shortly after 
Shapero joined the hospital, said Richard Ziman, chairman of the hospital's 
executive council. 
</P>
<P>
"Sandy Shapero didn't know what the rules were," Ziman said. "He didn't know it 
was inappropriate for the City of Hope to make a contribution." 
</P>
<P>
As a nonprofit organization, the City of Hope is prohibited from making 
campaign contributions and, by doing so, could risk losing its tax-exempt 
status, said Robert Giannangelico, spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service 
in Los Angeles. This could cost the hospital millions of dollars annually. 
</P>
<P>
"It's their mistake, not mine," Bane said. He maintained that his solicitors 
invite individuals, not institutions, to the dinner. He noted that Shapero 
attended the 1986 dinner. Shapero was out of town and could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Known for Funding 
</P>
<P>
Ziman said that when Shapero made the contribution, which was recorded as 
coming from the hospital's corporate headquarters, he was "aware that Bane and 
the state of California had been very effective in funding institutions like 
the City of Hope." 
</P>
<P>
Bane has been instrumental in obtaining state funds for a three-person state 
Lupus Appropriations Board, which awards grants to universities and hospitals 
for basic research on lupus, an incurable and potentially fatal disease of the 
autoimmune system. His wife has headed the board since its inception in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
The board has given nearly $1.2 million, or 19% of its $6.2 million in total 
grants, to the City of Hope since 1978, records show. 
</P>
<P>
The Banes have been criticized by some grant applicants, who said they were 
pushed to buy tickets to fund-raisers for Bane and Brown after seeking money 
from the lupus board. These scientists, most of whom are not politically 
active, said this raised questions about whether the quality of their proposals 
was the sole criterion on which they were judged. 
</P>
<P>
Bane responded that the proposals were evaluated on their merits alone. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
National Lupus Group 
</P>
<P>
In addition to sitting on the City of Hope's board of trustees, which raises 
money but does not make policy, Bane is head of the National Lupus 
Erythematosus Foundation. The private, nonprofit foundation, which operates out 
of Bane's legislative office, raises money for research at the City of Hope. It 
is not affiliated with the better-known Lupus Foundation of America, an 
international self-help organization. 
</P>
<P>
The national lupus foundation has raised $343,362 since 1977, much of it from 
special interests regulated by the state, according to its annual reports filed 
with the state. The largest contributor has been the H. F. Ahmanson Co., which 
gave $135,000 between 1978 and 1984, the last year for which the foundation 
listed contributors. 
</P>
<P>
Ahmanson's principal subsidiary is Home Savings of America. Bane, a longtime 
member of the Assembly Finance and Insurance Committee, is the legislative 
champion of California's savings and loan industry. The industry generously 
bankrolls his campaign committee.

HEARING TO FOCUS ON ROLE OF BUILDING INSPECTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles building inspectors will be under scrutiny Monday when officials 
take the unusual step of trying to determine whether partially built townhouses 
can be completed. 
</P>
<P>
City zoning administrators will conduct a 2 p.m. hearing at the Van Nuys 
Woman's Club to decide whether the Department of Building and Safety's 
inspectors properly interpreted zoning maps when they authorized construction 
of the 24 townhouses in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners contend that the final phase of the West Hills Condominium 
development is too tall and sits too close to the site's property line. They 
say the $7.5-million project fails to meet height and setback requirements 
approved for the area by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute is not the first involving the townhouse project and building 
inspectors. Last year, building and safety officials pronounced the project 
finished before ground was even broken for its construction. 
</P>
<P>
An inspector hurrying to finish paper work before his retirement is blamed for 
that mix-up, which occurred when building and safety issued a report to 
Councilman Marvin Braude that said the hilltop project was completed and fully 
occupied. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Discovered Mistake 
</P>
<P>
Robert Ayers, the department's San Fernando Valley manager, said his office 
promptly discovered the mistake and issued a correcting letter to Braude about 
three weeks later -- a fact confirmed by the councilman's office. 
</P>
<P>
But a copy of the second letter was never forwarded to the Woodland Hills 
resident who had asked Braude about the status of the development. As a result, 
homeowners assert, they let their guard down and the final phase of the project 
was begun before they had a chance to protest. Their complaints prompted Braude 
to call for Monday's unusual hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Officials acknowledge that homeowners are rarely hesitant to call attention to 
problems at neighborhood construction sites in the Valley and surrounding 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
Complaints from Sherman Oaks residents last year over the size of a new luxury 
home being built next to Beverly Glen Boulevard resulted in inspectors forcing 
the developer to lower the dwelling's roof line. 
</P>
<P>
Protests over the seven-story height of an office building at Fairway Avenue 
and Ventura Boulevard in Studio City, which was approved to be three floors 
high, prompted a lengthy city investigation last year of inspectors' 
interpretation of height restrictions. Officials decided that the height had 
been properly calculated. But the community furor prompted City Councilmen John 
Ferraro and Michael Woo to take steps to eliminate a special height bonus that 
benefited the builder. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Among Toughest Codes 
</P>
<P>
Homeowner unhappiness over what became known as the "Cracked Slab Controversy" 
caused Thousand Oaks to enact one of the toughest building codes in the state 
when the Conejo Valley community incorporated 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The first housing tracts that were built in the then-unincorporated valley in 
the late 1950s and early 1960s were constructed on concrete slabs approved by 
Ventura County under standards that had worked well in other parts of the 
county. But when the slabs proved too thin to withstand the expansion and 
contraction of the adobe-like soil of the Conejo Valley, scores of dwellings 
along Moorpark Road were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
The city's founding fathers quickly decided to "require more involved soils 
tests and additional steel and deeper footings," said David Hueners, a senior 
civil engineer with Thousand Oaks' Building and Safety Department. "They also 
required an inspector to be on the site when concrete was being poured. Our 
foundation standards are still higher than in most local areas. Contractors are 
often surprised when they come out here for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
In nearby Agoura, building inspectors for Los Angeles County began looking more 
closely at development projects in 1982 after residents of a condominium 
project complained to the County Board of Supervisors that their 27-unit 
development was collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
Officials concluded that unauthorized earthmoving weakened the project's 
foundations and caused some of the $100,000 units to begin sinking. The 
developer eventually bought back the Colodny Drive units and repaired them. 
</P>
<P>
But county officials called the construction a disgrace and, after an 
investigation, ordered a three-day suspension for the building and safety 
inspector who had been assigned to monitor the condominiums' construction. 
Since then, inspectors have been told to carefully watch for signs of 
unauthorized or unanticipated alterations around new construction, said Doug 
Browne, who heads Los Angeles County's building and safety office in Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
Such attention paid off last year when a sharp-eyed inspector noticed that the 
ground next to freshly poured cement slabs at a Calabasas Park luxury home 
tract was disturbed. Further investigation showed that a contractor had 
accidentally altered the level of sand spread beneath about half a dozen of the 
homes' slabs, Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
County officials required the builder to halt further work until concrete 
coring tests could determine the extent of the problem. The county ordered the 
builder to reinforce some of the slabs and change the framing on some of the 
dwellings before construction could resume. The early detection saved the 
builder and his eventual buyers "tens of thousands of dollars," Browne said.

DODGERS SLIP, FALL AND LOSE TO CUBS, 4-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD HOFFER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dodgers left 13 runners on base Sunday, twice ending rallies with the bases 
full. And even when somebody did provide some power with runners on, well, that 
wasn't a sure-fire way to score either. 
</P>
<P>
To see Mike Davis round third behind Eddie Murray's double and then stumble, 
you'd have to believe there was some kind of force field in effect. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Cubs, on the other hand, were getting home plate on a pass. It was 
that kind of day. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth inning, after Gary Varsho's double down the right-field line was 
plucked out of play by a fan, the umpires thought and thought and then reversed 
their immediate decision and gave Ryne Sandberg, who was standing on third, 
home. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers protested, some stronger than others, but even they knew this 
wasn't a game they deserved to win. And they didn't. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs, who got nine hits off Orel Hershiser (4-3), won this one, 4-2, in 
front of a Dodger Stadium crowd of 46,329. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser was not always brilliant but he was not taking a shellacking, either. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs big inning came in the sixth when Dwight Smith grounded a single to 
center. Singles by Sandberg and Mark Grace loaded the bases. Hershiser struck 
Varsho out, but Damon Berryhill grounded a single by first baseman Eddie Murray 
to drive in Smith and Sandberg. 
</P>
<P>
"Three high fastballs in a row," lamented Hershiser later. "One of those balls, 
maybe a double-play and I'm out of the inning." 
</P>
<P>
But the Dodgers weren't catching many breaks. Whereas the Cubs could score with 
the bases loaded, the Dodgers could not. Both the fourth and seventh innings 
ended with all the bases full. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the way it's been all season," the Dodgers' Mickey Hatcher said. The 
strange thing, it seemed to him, was "we're still not losing ground." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Dodgers (15-16) continue to bounce around the .500 level without 
the power of Kirk Gibson, Mike Marshall and Chris Gwynn. 
</P>
<P>
The only power the Dodgers have was provided by Manager Tom Lasorda, who had 
the hit of the day when he shoved his own player away from an umpire. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very, very close to getting thrown," said Lasorda, when Hatcher began 
piping up after Varsho's ground-rule double in the eighth inning. "And I didn't 
have anyone else to play." 
</P>
<P>
The bump Lasorda gave Hatcher, a former wide receiver at Oklahoma, was 
impressive. Hatcher was definitely moved off the line. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, he had a running start," Hatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
This entertainment came about when the umpires decided that Sandberg, who had 
been on first, would have scored on Varsho's double, trophy-seeking fan or not. 
It was a surprising ruling only in that Sandberg had originally been held up at 
third. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as I've been in the game," Hatcher said, "I've never seen a guy 
awarded home." 
</P>
<P>
Hatcher said he and his teammates later agreed that it was a good call. In any 
event, it was only an insurance run for the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a big run?" Lasorda said. "So was the guy who fell down coming around 
third." 
</P>
<P>
What happened, somebody wanted to know. "Have to ask him," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
So somebody asked Davis. He didn't really know either. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin Stubbs had already scored on Murray's double and Davis was about to 
follow behind when he got tangled up between third and home. "I felt I was lost 
in the middle," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs knew where to find him, though. That was the end of the Dodgers' 
offense, although they managed to fill the bases in the seventh on the strength 
of three walks. But that didn't scare the Cubs much and Pat Perry closed them 
down. Mitch Williams turned in the final two innings for his 10th save. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodger manager is frustrated by the losing, but doubly frustrated because 
he can't do what a manager likes to do best. Make late-inning moves. 
</P>
<P>
"I had certain situations I could hit somebody," he lamented, "and I didn't 
have them. The bases loaded, they bring in a left-hander (Steve Wilson in the 
fourth) and I can't bring in a right handed hitter (in place of Franklin 
Stubbs)." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodger offense must be in the whirlpool because it sure wasn't on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
After Murray's double in the third, there wasn't another hard-hit ball all day. 
From the fifth inning on, in fact, there was a bloop single, three walks, a hit 
batsman and an infield single. And that was it. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just one pitch short on all our rallies," Hershiser said. 
</P>
<P>
If this continues, he will, in order to win games like these, have to maintain 
an ERA better than the 2.01 he now carries. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
This was the second consecutive game that the umpires reversed a call. This 
time it went against the Dodgers. Tom Lasorda still thought it was a bad call: 
"I don't see how the guy's (Ryne Sandberg) gonna score on that ball." The fun 
of course was watching Lasorda argue when the umpires decided he could and did 
score. And then seeing Hatcher get in the act. After Lasorda shoved him, 
Hatcher said, "I just went back to my position and moped." . . . Dodger Mariano 
Duncan was the latest casualty in the line of play. He took a Steve Wilson 
pitch on the forearm as he swung and sported a nice lump on his forearm. He'll 
get X-rays but is expected to make the Dodgers' upcoming road trip. And he 
confounded Lasorda who asked him if he could hit. "He says, 'I can hit,' so he 
hits and leaves the game." Duncan said it was a matter of throwing, though. He 
had tested his arm and it troubled him. . . . Mike Marshall, who ended the game 
with a towering out in a pinch-hit appearance, is still troubled by a stiff 
back. Without him and Gibson in the lineup, the Dodgers field a team with only 
one home-run hitter, Eddie Murray.

Mark Lenzi continued his rapid climb as a world-class diver by winning the 
men's one-meter springboard competition as the FINA World Diving Cup concluded 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Lenzi, a junior at Indiana University, had 402.18 points for his six dives. 
Valeri Statsenko of the Soviet Union was second with 376.50. 
</P>
<P>
Lenzi's win was the highlight of a disappointing day for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, both U.S. divers failed to qualify for the finals in the men's 
10-meter platform, and Wendy Lucero, who was sixth on the three-meter 
springboard in the Olympics and finished third in the team competition here, 
was eliminated in the semifinals of that event. 
</P>
<P>
In the final two events, Chinese divers claimed their third and fourth 
individual gold medals. 
</P>
<P>
Olympic three-meter gold medalist Gao Min of China, 18, became the only double 
gold medalist by winning the women's three-meter springboard. Xiong Ni, 15, 
closed the meet by winning the men's platform event.

MUDD DEFEATS NELSON IN BYRON NELSON PLAYOFF 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jodie Mudd doesn't have the credentials of Larry Nelson, but it mattered little 
when the golfers met in a sudden death playoff Sunday in the Byron Nelson 
tournament at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
"You still have to play the shots, play the golf course," Mudd said after 
beating Nelson on the first extra hole. "I figured I had a little bit of an 
advantage, because of my length." 
</P>
<P>
When Mudd and Nelson went to the first extra hole, the par-five 16th, with 
$180,000 at stake, Nelson, 41, held a 3-1 playoff record, had won a U.S. Open 
and carried a reputation as one of golf's fiercest competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Mudd had an 0-2 playoff record and had one victory in an eight-year career. 
</P>
<P>
He promptly scored a birdie-four with a 12-foot putt to win. 
</P>
<P>
The playoff, the fourth in five years in the tournament, was set up when Mudd 
and Nelson completed regulation play at 265, 15-strokes under par. 
</P>
<P>
Mudd of Louisville, Ky., made up three shots over the last seven holes of 
regulation play and gained the playoff with a five-under-par 65. Nelson shot a 
67 for the final round. 
</P>
<P>
Mudd drove the fairway. Nelson, drove into light rough. 
</P>
<P>
Mudd hit a second shot just short of the green. Nelson laid up and had 115 
yards left. His third was to the right and gave him a 30-foot putt. 
</P>
<P>
Mudd chipped to 12 within feet, below the cup. 
</P>
<P>
After Nelson missed his long putt, Mudd made his. 
</P>
<P>
Mark O'Meara, a winner at Pebble Beach earlier this year, missed the playoff by 
one stroke at 266. He had a closing 66. 
</P>
<P>
Loren Roberts was next at 68 -- 267. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Mize and Wayne Levi, who shared the lead at the start of the day's play, 
"both had to struggle a bit," Mize said. 
</P>
<P>
Each had a 71, and tied for fifth at 268 with Chris Perry, who shot 68. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Juli Inkster overcame foul weather with a three-under-par 69 
that pushed her past her faltering opponents for a five-stroke victory in the 
LPGA's Crestar tournament at Chesapeake, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Inkster built a three-shot advantage at the turn and never led by fewer than 
two strokes the rest of the way on a rainy day that saw temperatures dip into 
the upper 40s. 
</P>
<P>
She completed three trips around Greenbrier Country Club's 6,275-yard layout in 
210, six-under par. 
</P>
<P>
The victory, worth $45,000 from the $300,000 purse, was Inkster's second of the 
season and the 13th of her career. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Daniel and Sweden's Liselotte Neumann were closest to Inkster at 215. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Mowry birdied the final hole for a one-shot victory over Gay Brewer in a 
$250,000 seniors PGA tournament at San Antonio, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Mowry's three-day total of 201 was 15 under par and set a tournament record. He 
had rounds of 66, 67 and four-under 68. Brewer finished with a 202. 
</P>
<P>
Miller Barber was third, three shots back at 204.

LENDL STOPS AGASSI IN STRAIGHT SETS

<P>
The wind gusted and Ivan Lendl breezed at the Tournament of Champions Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded player overpowered defending champion Andre Agassi, 6-2, 6-3, to 
reach the final of the clay-court event at the West Side Tennis Club in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl will play unseeded Jaime Yzaga of Peru for the championship today. Yzaga 
beat eighth-seeded Michael Chang, 6-4, 6-3, in the other semifinal on a chilly, 
windy day. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl had nine aces, eight service winners and improved his record against 
Agassi to 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I served very well, even with the wind," Lendl said. "Nobody likes this 
weather, but you can't get frustrated by it." 
</P>
<P>
Agassi, seeded third, said Lendl's superior strength gave him an advantage in 
the wind. 
</P>
<P>
"He can drive the ball through the wind, and it seemed I was the one worrying 
about it," Agassi said. "I take the ball early, so I need a good bounce. He 
waits longer for the ball and that gives him time to adjust." 
</P>
<P>
Agassi had only two break points, and Lendl saved one of them with three 
straight aces in the fourth game of the match. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi said he needs to improve his serve to beat Lendl, who has yet to lose a 
set in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"If I can't hold serve, I can't put pressure on him," Agassi said. 
</P>
<P>
After winning six tournaments last year and rising to No. 3 in the world, 
Agassi has failed to reach a Grand Prix final this year. Lendl has won three 
titles in 1989 and regained the No. 1 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a long way to go before I can be put in a category like him," Agassi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Yzaga handled Chang's serve with ease, breaking the teen-ager six times to 
become the third unseeded finalist in the 10-year-old tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have the fight in me for some reason," Chang said. "But Jaime played 
well and deserved to win." 
</P>
<P>
After evening the match, 4-4, in the first set, Yzaga broke Chang's serve at 
love with a forehand volley and served out the set. Yzaga then raced to a 4-0 
lead in the second set. 
</P>
<P>
Andrei Chesnokov of the Soviet Union earned the first-place prize of $31,500 by 
defeating Martin Strelba of Czechoslovakia, 5-7, 7-6 (8-6), 6-2, in the final 
of the $205,000 Bavarian Open clay-court tournament at Munich, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"I am keeping the check," Chesnokov said with a grin after receiving the prize. 
</P>
<P>
Chesnokov also said two weeks ago, after winning the tournament at Nice, 
France, that he wanted to keep his prize money rather than send it to the 
Soviet sports committee, as mandated by Soviet regulations. 
</P>
<P>
At Munich, Chesnokov took control when he won the second-set tiebreaker against 
the 22-year-old Strelba, who was playing in his first Grand Prix final after 
upsetting Stefan Edberg in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Jana Novotna of Czechoslovakia defaulted because of an ankle injury, giving 
top-seeded Steffi Graf of West Germany the title in a Virginia Slims tournament 
at Hamburg, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Novotna twisted her ankle during Saturday's semifinal against Arantxa Sanchez 
of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 34th Virginia Slims singles title for Graf, whose first-round 
opponent withdrew because of illness.

DAVEY ALLISON ENDS DRY SPELL IN WINSTON 500

<TEXT>
<P>
Davey Allison ended a 14-race streak without a victory Sunday as he held off 
Terry Labonte and Mark Martin to win his second Winston 500 at Talladega, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
Allison, from nearby Hueytown, Ala., last won in September at Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
But on the 2.66-mile, high-banked Talladega Superspeedway oval Allison won in 
front of his father, longtime NASCAR star Bobby Allison, who won this event 
three times -- the last time in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Allison is recuperating from serious injuries suffered in a racing crash 
last June 19 at Long Pond, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a real up and down season and I can't think of a better place to 
finally get things going," Davey Allison said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a brand new race car and it just came out here and drove perfect. All 
I had to do was steer it and mash the gas. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just so happy my dad and mom are here. I only wish he was out here racing 
with me again." 
</P>
<P>
The younger Allison, who won the Winston 500 in 1987, drafted past Morgan 
Shepherd into the lead on lap 180 of the 188-lap event and went on to his fifth 
career victory and first of the season. 
</P>
<P>
It was also his sixth career victory at Talladega, including four in ARCA stock 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
He finished only 0.22 seconds ahead of Labonte, who was just in front of 
pole-winner Martin in the single-file battle of Ford Thunderbirds. 
</P>
<P>
World Formula One champion Ayrton Senna of Brazil led from start to finish to 
capture the Monaco Grand Prix at Monte Carlo for the second time. 
</P>
<P>
Senna, driving a McLaren-Honda, was timed in 1 hour 53 minutes 33.251 seconds 
for the race, shortened to 77 laps because of a restart. 
</P>
<P>
Alain Prost of France, also in a McLaren-Honda, was runner-up, 52.529 seconds 
behind Senna. Prost set a blistering lap record of 1:25.501 during the race. 
</P>
<P>
Stefano Modena of Italy, in a Brabham-Judd, was third, more than a lap behind 
Senna. Italians Alex Caffi and Michele Alboreto were fourth and fifth, 
respectively. Martin Brundle of Britain was sixth. 
</P>
<P>
It was Senna's 16th career Grand Prix victory. He and Prost are tied for first 
place in the drivers standings this year with 18 points each. 
</P>
<P>
Darin Brassfield of Los Gatos, Calif. took the lead as the green flag fell and 
then held off a spirited charge by Dorsey Schroeder to win the Trans-Am race at 
Sears Point International Raceway in Sonoma, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Max Jones of Long Beach was third in a Chevrolet Beretta. His teammate, Tommy 
Kendall of Glendale was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Glidden and Gary Ormsby continued winning in the National Hot Rod Assn. 
national event competition and Kenny Bernstein regained his formula for success 
at Memphis Motorsports Park. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein, the four-time and defending Funny Car champion from Dallas, won his 
first race this season and the 28th of his career when he defeated Mark Oswald. 
</P>
<P>
Ormsby, of Roseville, Calif., won for the third time this season when he 
defeated Eddie Hill in Top Fuel. Glidden, of Whiteland, Ind., defeated Warren 
Johnson for Pro Stock honors.

PEOPLE: BOWDOIN TO QUIT AS CEO OF FAMILY S&amp;L 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert E. Bowdoin, president and chief executive of Family Savings &amp; Loan, 
the nation's second-largest black-owned thrift, is resigning June 1. 
</P>
<P>
Named to replace Bowdoin is Wayne Kent Bradshaw, president and chief executive 
of Founders Savings &amp; Loan, a rival black-owned thrift in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Bowdoin joined Family Savings in 1973. He became its president and chief 
executive last year, succeeding Oliver A. Trigg Jr., who was forced to resign 
amid a federal investigation into fraud at the thrift. 
</P>
<P>
Bowdoin leaves Family Savings as the tiny institution tries to diversify to 
compete with larger thrifts. For example, Family Savings expects to open soon 
its first automated teller machine, already a fixture at most other savings and 
loans and banks. 
</P>
<P>
Bowdoin, 60, said he is resigning because Family Savings is spreading its 
business beyond home mortgages into consumer lending, such as automobile loans. 
"They need someone here who knows banking," Bowdoin said. "I don't consider 
myself a banker." 
</P>
<P>
Family Savings has been through a difficult time. Partly due to losses on some 
large real estate loans made under Trigg, the thrift, based in the Crenshaw 
district, lost $2.5 million last year. Its financial picture improved during 
the first quarter when it earned $132,000. But the thrift is being monitored by 
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board because its capital base, or the amount of 
money it has available to cover losses and bad loans, is too low. 
</P>
<P>
Family Savings Chairman William S. Shearer said the board decided it was time 
for a change in leadership. "No one put a gun to Bob's head," said William S. 
Shearer, Family Savings' chairman. "Our performance is sluggish, and he 
understands that. We need someone who can make it happen." 
</P>
<P>
He said Bowdoin will remain as a consultant to Family Savings until the end of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw, 42, has experience in banking. Before joining Founders 15 months ago, 
he was vice president of asset-based lending at Union Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw is credited with cutting losses at Founders, a deeply troubled 
institution which is involved in the FLHBB's consignment program. Bradshaw said 
that Founders lost $4 million last year, compared to $11 million in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw said he viewed his move to Family Savings as "an opportunity to create 
a strong, viable institution in the black community." He said that he might 
pursue a number of strategies to increase the size and competitiveness of 
Family Savings, including a possible merger with Founders. DENISE GELLENE

LA PALOMA'S ECLIPSE IS NOT EXPECTED TO REMAIN TOTAL

The unexpected closing Tuesday of the historic La Paloma Theater in Encinitas 
put the theater in the dark, but not its fate. 
</P>
<P>
"One way or another, whether we resell the lease or operate it ourselves, the 
theater will certainly open again, although I have no idea when," said Alan 
Grossberg, who took back the lease he and partner Mark Weisinger had sold to 
Alan Gates in February, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Besides regularly screening cult films such as "Rocky Horror Picture Show," 
Gates had been trying to turn the theater into a home for small arts 
organizations such as the San Dieguito Playhouse, whose most recent production, 
"Teahouse of the August Moon," concluded its run Sunday despite the theater's 
closure five days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"With no warning at all, I found out (Gates') intention to close the theater," 
Grossberg said, "and, since he has been in default for two or three months in 
his payments to us, we took possession." 
</P>
<P>
"So now, we need to work out details between him, the landlord, and us before 
we know what's going to happen next," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gates could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
San Dieguito Playhouse president Norma Payne would like to know, too. The 
troupe had expected to stage plays at the La Paloma into next year while trying 
to relocate the former St. John's Catholic Church on Melrose Avenue and convert 
the church into a theater. 
</P>
<P>
"If the new owner doesn't contract with us for next season . . . we might not 
have a next season," Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
The La Paloma Theater was built in 1928 by Aubrey Austin, a wealthy Santa 
Monica banker, as a combination movie theater and vaudeville house. It was one 
of the first rural theaters in the country to install sound equipment for 
"talkies," which had debuted a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
With the death of vaudeville during the Great Depression, La Paloma turned into 
a full-time movie house. But, by the early 1960s, the theater had fallen into 
disrepair, and in 1963, after screenings of "Jason and the Argonauts" and 
"Gidget Goes Hawaiian," it shut. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1972, the La Paloma reopened -- under new ownership, and after a 
badly needed face lift -- with an all-day Woody Guthrie benefit concert. For 
the next six years, the theater flourished with a mix of concerts, classic film 
screenings and civic events. 
</P>
<P>
In early 1978, the La Paloma was purchased by Ed Seykota, an eccentric North 
County millionaire. Seykota further upgraded the theater by adding Dolby sound 
equipment and permanent stage lighting. For another seven years, the theater 
continued to do well with more concerts, more classic film screenings, and 
frequent showings of surf movies. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1985, Seykota sold the property to Del Mar developers David 
Winkler and Ivan Gayler, who in turn signed a 15-year operating lease with 
Grossberg and Weisinger. 
</P>
<P>
"We operated the theater ourselves for the next three years, and we were very 
successful," Grossberg said. "Then, we were approached by (Alan) Gates and sold 
the lease to him." 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, it seemed like a very good deal, but now, I wish we never would 
have done it," he said.

Sporting his new title and a broad smile notably absent from his sober 
publicity photos, music director designate Yoav Talmi returned to the San Diego 
Symphony over the weekend. On Saturday night, the Israeli conductor exuded an 
extra measure of confidence, although in five previous visits he surely has 
never appeared obsequious. The orchestra's recently announced choice of Talmi, 
after a two-year search for a music director, has clearly bolstered his morale 
and his command of the podium. 
</P>
<P>
The program was a Mozart and Mahler combination plate, evidently one of Talmi's 
favorite recipes, since he will open the orchestra's 1989-90 season with the 
same pair of composers. His affinity for and appreciation of Mahler's First 
Symphony ("Titan") was evident at every turn. He allowed the episodic work to 
unfold generously, never forcing the pace but carefully shaping each movement. 
Only in the middle of the finale did he momentarily lose the tension and focus 
that underlies Mahler's exotic tonal tapestry. 
</P>
<P>
In the second movement, he demanded a Landler defined by unrelenting 
sharp-edged rhythms, and the orchestra responded with rhythmic precision and 
the appropriate piquant colors that made the entire section sparkle. In both of 
the middle movements, Talmi kept the melodies shimmering above finely tuned 
accompaniments. 
</P>
<P>
Talmi wisely saved the major decibels for the thunderous climax of the last 
movement, which displayed the orchestra's more resonant forte of the season. 
Although the horns, expanded to eight for this symphony given to stentorian 
outbursts, acquitted their tasks honorably, the trumpets under the brilliant 
leadership of principal Calvin Price proved to be the thoroughbreds of the 
Mahler brass. 
</P>
<P>
Talmi's Mozart was less successful than his Mahler, but it was not all his 
fault. Mozart's C Major Oboe Concerto, K. 271k is routine in the extreme, 
especially compared to the composer's deservedly better-known Clarinet 
Concerto, K. 622. And, although Allan Vogel is one of the most elegant oboe 
virtuosos in captivity, he played below his own high standards Saturday night. 
Dropping a few notes along the way is no crime, but he seemed hemmed in by the 
opening movement's busy coloratura nonsense, and his usual rich timbre sounded 
on the anemic side. Fortunately his characteristic sonority returned in the 
freedom of the cadenzas and in the concluding rondo. Talmi had reduced the 
orchestra to a mere 35 players for this modest concerto, but even that was a 
bit heavy for the delicate sound of the oboe. 
</P>
<P>
Although Mozart's Overture to "The Abduction From the Seraglio" is one of the 
composer's more foolproof overtures, Talmi and the orchestra gave this program 
opener compelling energy and a sprightly sheen. The overture followed the 
symphony's announcement of a gift of $500,000 from Judson and Rachel Grosvenor 
to underwrite Talmi's next four years with the San Diego Symphony. Judson 
Grosvenor is a member of the symphony's board of directors and serves on its 
executive committee. Now that Talmi and the orchestra are starting their 
honeymoon, it is no doubt reassuring for the orchestra to boast a modest dowry 
in addition to its sizable debt.

LONG BEACH TRIES OUT THE OTHER BARBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, Times Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Figaro, Figaro, Figaro. Everybody knows Figaro. Everybody uses Figaro. 
</P>
<P>
 Figaro qua, Figaro la, Figaro su, Figaro giu. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Figaro is everywhere -- here and there, up and down. He is, after all, the 
world's busiest baritonal factotum. 
</P>
<P>
He is Rossini's beloved barber of Seville. In another incarnation, he is 
Mozart's most celebrated bridegroom. 
</P>
<P>
But wait. Rossini and Mozart weren't the only composers to get involved with 
this mercurial tonsorial manipulator. 
</P>
<P>
Inspired by Beaumarchais' quasi-anti-establishment comedy, Giovanni Paisiello 
wrote a pioneering opera-buffa called "Il Barbiere di Siviglia" in 1782. 
Rossini didn't get around to his own strikingly similar version of the same 
text until 1816 -- the year Paisiello died. Meanwhile, in 1786, Mozart 
consciously followed -- and expanded -- the Paisiello-Beaumarchais example when 
he officiated at the mellifluous marriage of Figaro. 
</P>
<P>
The ever-enterprising Long Beach Opera is surveying the evolution of the Figaro 
revolution this month with performances of both the Paisiello rarity and the 
Mozart perennial. The familiar Rossini variation is missing, alas, and so is 
Darius Milhaud's setting of the ultimate sequel, "La mere coupable" (1964). 
</P>
<P>
Reliable rumor has it that the publisher withheld the Milhaud materials because 
of financial problems in Long Beach. Be that as it may, Michael Milenski has 
scheduled a production of the original, unsung Beaumarchais play on May 20. 
This "Guilty Mother" will be embellished with new incidental music by Mark 
McGurty. 
</P>
<P>
The Paisiello "Barbiere," which opened at the intimate yet skimpily attended 
Center Theater on Saturday, was very popular in its day. That day, 
unfortunately, seems to have passed. 
</P>
<P>
It is a pretty opera, full of graceful tunes, neat set pieces, pleasant lyrical 
flights. Taken on its own innocent terms, it offers discreet charm and muted 
wit. 
</P>
<P>
It turns up from time to time in modest workshop productions. Walter 
Felsenstein temporarily renewed Paisiello's lease on stage life with an 
exquisite production in East Berlin in the late 1950s. Boston ventured a 
reasonably ambitious version a few seasons ago. 
</P>
<P>
An operatic exhumation like this is always interesting, often instructive. Long 
Beach deserves our gratitude for taking us on a rare time trip. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the trip was haunted, possibly fatally, by the spectres of Rossini and 
Mozart. One recognizes a procedural point borrowed by the former, a structural 
device appropriated by the latter. At the same time, one yearns for the brash 
vitality of Rossini at one extreme and for the inspired humanity of Mozart at 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
For all his suavity and skill, Paisiello didn't make waves. He was just another 
Salieri. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Schaffer notwithstanding, that is no insult. Nor is it tantamount to 
glorification. 
</P>
<P>
The production, politely mild by Long Beach standards, didn't make waves 
either. Hans Nieuwenhuis, the young Dutch director, decided that the thrust 
stage didn't exist. He pretended that the Center Theater was really an 
old-fashioned proscenium house -- and slighted opportunities for theatrical 
immediacy in the process. He also introduced the fleeting redundancy of a 
fatuous narrator. 
</P>
<P>
In general he allowed the familiar action to unfold fluidly and with elegant 
restraint. He used Paul Gallis' drawing room cum colonnade set and muted 
costumes as a versatile period frame. 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't resist peppering the proceedings, however, with some cutesy-fussy, 
anachronistic sight gags. A plastic credit card facilitated the Count's payment 
to Figaro. Floating cable-car cages accommodated characters who were supposed 
to appear in windows. The 17th-Century servants brandished an "ON STRIKE" sign. 
A leitmotific dinner table rose and sank on an elevator ad tedium, for no 
particular reason. 
</P>
<P>
In the too-prominent pit, Nicholas McGegan conducted a patently under-rehearsed 
orchestra with dauntless panache. He also struck a few continuo chords with 
stylish abandon. He couldn't distract attention, however, from Paisiello's 
relatively simplistic harmonies, his inevitable cadential cliches and his pat 
orchestral formulas. 
</P>
<P>
The ensemble of singing actors was strong. John Fanning brought deft baritonal 
bonhomie to the title role. Kathryn Gamberoni chirped sweetly, even sexily, as 
Rosina. Don Bernardini exerted manly bel-canto as Almaviva. David Evitts 
blustered agreeably as Bartolo. Michael Gallup easily overcame a mishap at the 
peak of a crucial cadenza and played Basilio with gleeful bravado. 
</P>
<P>
Minor roles were crisply etched by Ken Remo, Christopher Webb, John McConnell 
and Alan Nitikman. Everyone articulated Ross Halper's English translation 
carefully. 
</P>
<P>
This Figaro venture was nice. Too bad it wasn't exciting. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, bravo, Figaro, bravo, bravissimo? 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite.

'DRAGON LADY' DRAMA MIRED IN THE SUBURBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Non-critics sometimes ask critics -- between the usual 
"why-didn't-you-like-that?" queries -- what it is they look for in a work. 
Seeing Robert Daseler's "Dragon Lady," his new, and very first, play at South 
Coast Repertory's Second Stage (and part of SCR's California Play Festival), 
triggered this critic's own self-inquiry. A kind of laundry list, so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
Story? It doesn't have much of one, but good plays often don't. Characters? It 
has, perhaps, two interesting people, yet some fine plays only have one. Drama? 
Not much in a play about ennui in the L.A. suburbs -- besides, a good deal of 
20th-Century drama isn't about "drama." 
</P>
<P>
Still, "Dragon Lady" is beset by a problem that drags it down, down below what 
it could be. It has to do with the last two remaining items on the laundry 
list. 
</P>
<P>
Did the play evoke something? An emphatic "yes." That is because Daseler has 
absolutely captured the language of the desultory, educated California 
upper-middle class, and with it, a whole set of attitudes that come out of the 
language. In a way, the drive behind "Dragon Lady," what made Daseler write it, 
was to capture that world. 
</P>
<P>
Which is the problem. Did the play resonate -- that is, did it follow you out 
the theater door, and back home? An emphatic "no." In "Dragon Lady," the line 
or observation or detail of the moment is all, but once it's gone, it's not 
terribly missed. 
</P>
<P>
This makes for a frustrating experience, because so many of those moments are 
lively. Margo (Robin Pearson Rose), an editor and quietly despairing wife of a 
PR executive (Richard Doyle), is able to bolt from one conversation subject to 
another with unique and believable skill. Listen, for example, to how she gets 
a house party on the subject of death. Or how she desecrates New England, and 
what evidence she summons for her argument. This woman belongs in the 
Bloomsbury circle, not in the Inland Empire. 
</P>
<P>
Part of Daseler's point is that the sum of this impressive woman is a bunch of 
missed opportunities. And that is why Margo, at 41, is preoccupied with growing 
old. Her own preoccupation, in turn, partly blinds her to husband Alex's own 
desire to grasp what may be his last opportunity: a PR post in Boston. To this 
point in the play, Daseler is elegant in his logic. 
</P>
<P>
The tension, if one can call it that, is between the evident intelligence of 
these people (including Alex and Margo's friends, Hal Landon Jr.'s Paul and 
Julie Fulton's Nan) and their inability to make a decision. Some playwrights 
would tap this for comedy, while others might make the play about the waiting 
for the decision. Daseler falls somewhere in between -- in a crack, really. 
He's as dry as Margo (but not as cynical), and as indecisive. If the playwright 
doesn't make a move, who will? 
</P>
<P>
Not that it's crucial to know that Margo and Alex are moving to Boston. But 
because one moment hasn't resonated to the next, we finally care less than we 
should. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Patch's production certainly doesn't let us begin in such an emotional 
vacuum. In one of the most beautiful openings to a show in memory, the 
pre-opening lights are on George Segal-like sculptures of a husband and wife, 
placed in set designer Cliff Faulkner's modestly stylish living/dining room 
set. The lights fade down, and when they fade back up, there are Rose and Doyle 
in the same positions as the sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
The only other facet of play or production which delivers such a poetic sense 
of human mortality is Rose's performance, which embodies the notion that good 
acting is knowing what not to give away. Seldom do actresses have a chance to 
delve into a contemporary woman whose brain is forever ticking. Rose uses every 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
Fulton has Nan trying to play catch-up with Margo, and hiding a burning envy 
inside that's only hinted at in the script. Doyle's Alex, a middle-aged boy, 
looks absolutely serious when he talks about determining "my career." Landon 
emphasizes the hunter in Paul, which helps us believe why Margo willingly 
becomes the hunted. 
</P>
<P>
But that suggests that "Dragon Lady" (the title refers to Margo's office 
nickname) involves some danger. It is a bit too precious for that, like Eric 
Allaman's too-delicate string music. It doesn't breathe fire, and it nearly 
loses air. 
</P>

The Washington State Fruit Commission, a trade association of growers, has 
withdrawn $71,300 worth of television ads for Northwest cherries from three CBS 
affiliates to protest a "60 Minutes" report about the chemical Alar. The Feb. 
26 report dealt with a Natural Resources Defense Council study that concluded 
that eating apples treated with Alar, which is used to control ripening, 
increased cancer risks for children. Although federal regulators have declared 
apples safe to eat, growers contend that they have lost millions of dollars as 
a result. The association has withdrawn the cherry ads from CBS affiliates in 
St. Louis, Atlanta and Tampa "to voice displeasure over the way the CBS 
broadcast of the '60 Minutes' program chose to sensationalize the Alar story," 
spokesman Pat Dunlop said Friday. SHAUNA SNOW

Developer Donald Trump did not authorize the use of his name in an 
advertisement appearing Friday in support of "shock TV" show host Morton Downey 
Jr., according to Trump's secretary and spokeswoman, Norma Foerderer. The 
full-page advertisement in USA Today, which says, "We believe in Mort" and that 
"the First Amendment protects the rights of the 'Morton Downey Jr. Show' and 
any show, regardless of its content," lists the names of 25 supporters -- 
including Trump, Robert Goulet, Harvard law professor Allen Dershowitz and 
Broadway producer Jerry Cohen. Foerderer said Trump is upset and "thinks it's 
horrible and unfortunate" that his name was used without his permission. Rachel 
McAllister, a spokeswoman for Downey's public relations firm, said: "All the 
people listed on the ad contributed to it." . . . In other Downey developments, 
the talk show host is being sued by two songwriters who claim that they wrote 
the theme song for his syndicated show and have never received any money for 
it. John Beland and Floyd Guilbeau filed the lawsuit Thursday in Chicago 
federal court. They are seeking an unspecified amount in damages and royalties.

The Chrysler Corp., one of many advertisers to yank its ads from NBC's 
titillating "Nightingales" series, has now pledged to sponsor the show if it is 
renewed in the fall. Chrysler's decision follows producer Aaron Spelling's vow 
last week to clean up "Nightingales" in cooperation with the American Nursing 
Assn. Spelling and series star Suzanne Pleshette have both expressed fears that 
NBC might ax the show to avoid controversy. SHAUNA SNOW

Oprah Winfrey and her producers are scheduled to meet this week with 
representatives of Jewish and civil-liberties groups after the groups' leaders 
and hundreds of television viewers protested allegations made last week on "The 
Oprah Winfrey Show" that some Jews practice ritual killing of children. During 
last Monday's program, which focused on the cult murders of at least 13 people 
near Matamoros, Mexico, a guest said she had witnessed the ritual sacrifice of 
Jewish children and had been a victim of ritualistic abuse. The woman's 
comments provoked hundreds of angry phone calls and letters to Jewish and civil 
liberties groups, spokesmen for the groups said Friday. They said viewers 
contended that Winfrey did not challenge the woman's statements sufficiently. 
Jeffrey Jacobs, the chief operating officer of Winfrey's production company, 
Harpo Productions Inc., denied that Winfrey had acted irresponsibly. SHAUNA

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: FILMFORUM'S FRIEDMAN PROGRAM AT LACE

An hourlong program of work by Adele Friedman, who taps the remarkable 
expressive power of silent black-and-white cinema while bringing to it an 
acutely contemporary sensibility, will be presented at LACE by Filmforum 
tonight at 8. Progressing from her earlier short works of landscapes, 
cityscapes and portraits, Friedman gradually introduces narrative in such films 
as "Abduction" (1986) and "Untitled" (1978), revealing a concern with 
attractions between individuals, often two women, expressed in shifting 
relationships between time and space. Her pacing is stately, yet her work is 
exhilarating in its intense beauty and emotion. (213) 276-7452. (714) 923-2441. 
</P>
<P>
"The Films of Alexander Kluge," a UCLA Film Archives/Goethe Institute 
retrospective of the work of the New German Cinema pioneer, continues Tuesday 
at 8 p.m. at UCLA's Melnitz Hall with "Artists Under the Big Top: Perplexed" 
(1967) and "Occasional Work of a Female Slave" (1973). 
</P>
<P>
The first is one of the most confounding films imaginable, its meanings 
ultimately elusive, perhaps even to those well-versed with the political 
upheavals experienced by West Germany in the late '60s. The key setting is a 
circus, and the principal figure is one Leni Peickert, an attractive young 
trapeze artist who dreams of owning her own circus but who ends up studying for 
a career in TV. Clearly, the circus is a metaphor, but for what it's hard to 
say -- perhaps for artistic aspiration and frustration or, more likely, for the 
artist's confusion as to what his or her role should be in society. Tedious and 
obscure, the film leaves you with the feeling that Kluge knows what he's doing 
-- even if you don't. 
</P>
<P>
"Occasional Work of a Female Slave" is a more rewarding experience altogether. 
A feminist work, it has a strong Brechtian flavor, with gritty documentary-like 
sequences punctuated with highly idiosyncratic quotes from literature, 
philosophy, music and old films, all of which give the film its richly sardonic 
flavor. Kluge's sister Alexandra plays a care-worn 29-year-old Frankfurt mother 
of three who supports her family by performing illegal abortions while her male 
chauvinist husband remains the perennial student. Gradually, she becomes an 
activist, and Kluge extends and maintains the utmost compassion for his 
beleaguered but dauntless heroine while finding within her plight an absurdity 
that borders on the comic as often as it does the tragic. (213) 206-FILM, 
206-8013. 
</P>
<P>
The annual Asian Pacific American International Film Festival, sponsored by 
various organizations in addition to the UCLA Film Archive, commences this 
weekend at Melnitz Theater and provides another opportunity to see two films 
from the recent AFI Film Fest, Huang Shuquin's "Woman Human Demon" (Saturday at 
7:30 p.m.) and Fred Tan's "Rouge of the North" (Sunday at 7:30 p.m.). "Rouge of 
the North" is followed by Li Yu-ning's "A Taxi Driver's Last Fall" (1988), a 
Taiwanese film of much raw power based on an actual 1982 incident. The film is 
slow getting under way, underlining repeatedly the hardships of a middle-aged 
taxi driver (Sun Yueh) and his neighbors living a marginal existence in a 
claustrophobic Taipei slum. An hour into the film, the taxi driver attempts a 
bank robbery, apparently Taiwan's first, so that his friends, particularly the 
pretty daughter of a neighbor, a recent bride, might have a better life. The 
film explodes at this point, becoming an unsparing depiction of horrendous 
police brutality, which emerges as a criticism of a heavily bureaucratized 
society indifferent to the fate of its hard-pressed working class. "Woman Demon 
Human" is preceded on Saturday by the late Stephen Ning's 48-minute "Freckled 
Rice" (1983), which dramatizes a boy's coming of age and coming to terms with 
his Chinese-American heritage. 
</P>
<P>
Screening Thursday in Melnitz Theater at 5:30 in the French Revolution and the 
Cinema series is a genuine curiosity, "Captain of the Guard" (1930), a fanciful 
operetta version of the life of the composer of "La Marseillaise," Claude 
Joseph Rouget de l'Isle (dashing John Boles). It's as static and self-conscious 
as most early talkies, but Laura La Plante, in a dark wig, is charming as the 
composer's true love. 
</P>
<P>
Reminder: The 1925 Lon Chaney "Phantom of the Opera," complete with a rare 
Techinicolor sequence, will screen at the Orpheum Thursday at 8 p.m. 
accompanied by Korla Pandit on the Mighty Wurlitzer and preceded by the Beverly 
Hills Cotillion Dancers. (213) 239-0939.

Whoever heard of David Gordon? 
</P>
<P>
Not many San Diego dance buffs, judging from the sparse audience on hand Friday 
night for the local debut of Gordon's Pick Up Co. 
</P>
<P>
More's the pity, since this doyen of post-modern dance and his sleek New 
York-based ensemble offered a strikingly free-flowing sneak preview of "United 
States," a huge patchwork quilt of a piece scheduled to be premiered at Kennedy 
Center in September. And, unlike most imported dance works, this evening-long 
mix of movement, words and music, had ties to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon's "United States" is geographically lopsided -- only a handful of 
selected states provided the impetus for the segment showcased at Mandeville 
Auditorium Friday and Saturday night. But this unique multimedia construction, 
which will remain a work-in-progress for the next few months, has already found 
its emotional balance and a crystal-clear sense of dance logic. 
</P>
<P>
By virtue of local sponsorship (the San Diego Foundation for the Performing 
Arts was one of 27 commissioning presenters nationwide), "United States" drew 
some inspiration from the city of San Diego. Music by Harry Partch, for 
example, was overlaid during a particularly poignant section on life in Los 
Angeles. However, those fleeting allusions are likely to be enlarged after 
Gordon soaks up the essence of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon, the most enduring trailblazer in post-modern dance, has an uncanny 
sense of musicality, even when the "music" is the monotonous drone of a pedant 
pontificating on the behavior of pigeons or the rambling storytelling technique 
of a Colorado ranch hand. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Gordon's fluid movement motifs are ironically juxtaposed against somber 
textual material. Others take their cues from movie sound tracks or even the 
repetitious rhythms of a weather report. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, this latest work reaffirms beliefs formulated by Gordon and 
other rebel dance makers who turned dance on its ear back in the '60s, namely 
the notion that random movement can indeed be labeled dance and that behavioral 
expressions can constitute choreography. 
</P>
<P>
Striking icons abound in "United States," but the dance never slows long enough 
to dwell on them. It just unfurls in a seamless flow of fast-moving images, 
like a piece of giant tumbleweed spilling across the stage. 
</P>
<P>
In one playful segment, Gordon gets into the act, wrapping himself around a 
huge banner while the University of Nebraska's marching band sets the frantic 
pace. Later, the chunky but still wonderfully lithe dancer does a comic turn 
with his partner, warding off a thunderstorm with an open umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
Everything is grist for Gordon's mill, and he usually makes the most of his 
found material. 
</P>
<P>
In a section on Iowa, the voice-over reminds us that "saying a place is flat is 
a way of making it simpler than it is." Naturally, the choreographer makes 
merry with that concept in pure dance terms. 
</P>
<P>
Though parody is never far from the surface of the dance, Gordon's lexicon is 
highly lyrical and his phrasing cleverly devious. To the throaty strains of 
"I'm Always Drunk in San Francisco," the dancers are loose-limbed and laid 
back, but the dance is deliciously complex and affecting. 
</P>
<P>
Valda Setterfield (Gordon's wife) is a striking presence in every appearance 
with her shock of snow white hair. But she's positively irresistible in the 
cheeky Judy Garland spoof that takes witty pot shots at the pretensions of 
ballet as well. 
</P>
<P>
Mozart goes post-modern in a wildly ebullient ensemble section danced at 
breakneck speed. There is an easy amplitude of movement that becomes infectious 
as the company breezes through this lively little romp. Another part of the 
work propels the graceful dancers in slow motion, as if they were making their 
way under water. 
</P>
<P>
The finale on New England is brilliantly transposed against an excerpt from 
Robert Frost. Near the end of the taped interview, the poet explains, "I'm 
clarifying something for myself in verse." Change that to dance, and you know 
what this inventive choreographer is all about.

DONALD ADAMS BRIGHTENS 'GONDOLIERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Sheldon, founding director of the 20-year-old Opera a la Carte, has 
taught us to expect minor miracles from his local budget Gilbert-and-Sullivan 
troupe. 
</P>
<P>
But only veteran Savoyard Donald Adams, appearing as a guest, approached the 
ideal in the company's new production of "The Gondoliers" Saturday at 
Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
As the Grand Inquisitor (a role that, contrary to local advertisements, he 
never undertook with D'Oyly Carte), Adams sang with amplitude and security. He 
also acted with wit and poise. He took snuff with exquisite relish, lingered 
menacingly over words such as "torture," and hopped gamely with gout-hindered 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
Adams contributed an authentic link with G&amp;S heritage. But it was 
reinforced as usual by Sheldon's traditional stage direction of the principals, 
dressed in Leslie Tamarra Yarmo's sumptuous mid-18th-Century costumes, amid 
David Barber's attractive, semi-abstract cut-out sets. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, dramatic values often outweighed vocal ones. 
</P>
<P>
Alison England, a pert Casilda, sang with breathiness and insecurity at the 
top. Patrick O'Donohue, an ardent Luiz, was vocally thin and reedy. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon was an adroit and vocally agile Duke of Plaza-Toro. Eugenia Hamilton, 
the Duchess, savored the spoken word but exhibited uncharacteristic pitch 
problems when she sang. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps opening-night nerves contributed to their dropping one stanza and 
repeating another in its place in "Small Titles and Orders." 
</P>
<P>
The two pairs of lovers proved handsome, energetic, but vocally weak. Mark 
Beckwith, as Giuseppe, offered sweet tone without strength. Kathryn Steward 
contributed a stiff and small-voiced Tessa. 
</P>
<P>
Laurance Fee (Marco) burdened "Take a Pair of Sparkling Eyes" with dark chest 
tone and ventured near high notes only with extreme caution, saving himself for 
the applause-generating last one. Kris Kennedy, a sunny Gianetta, sang with 
glassy, thin tone. The Opera a la Carte chorus did not always sing with 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Fetta conducted the small, error-prone Opera a la Carte Orchestra with 
crisply and lightly but without lyric flight. He also allowed momentum to flag 
in linking dialogue and song. 
</P>
<P>
A quibble: Sheldon over-employed the child Nicholas Fee (as the drummer boy). 
Even one of Fee's flits across the stage was more distracting than dramatically 
enhancing, much less three.

MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cuban-American "godfather" of a drug-smuggling and satanic cult accused of 
15 slayings ordered one of his followers to kill him and his right-hand man as 
police closed in on their Mexico City hide-out, arrested cult members said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Sara Aldrete Villarreal, 24, the so-called "witch" of the cult, told reporters 
that her boyfriend and leader, Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, "demanded to be 
killed because he said everything was finished." 
</P>
<P>
Recounting the final minutes before their capture in a shoot-out with police 
Saturday, Aldrete told a press conference that Constanzo became desperate. "He 
was shouting, 'Do it! Do it! If you don't, things will go badly for you in 
hell,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
Before a crowd of reporters at the Mexico City attorney general's office, 
Aldrete pointed to fellow cult member Alvaro de Leon and said: "He killed him. 
(Constanzo) ordered him to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Police found the bullet-riddled bodies of Constanzo, 27, and Martin Quintana 
Rodriguez, 25, in the closet of a Mexico City apartment Saturday afternoon. 
They said Constanzo was identified from fingerprints and from his U.S. 
passport. 
</P>
<P>
Aldrete, De Leon, 22, and Omar Francisco Orea Ochoa, 23, were arrested at the 
apartment, the attorney general's office said. Later in the day, officials said 
they arrested Maria de Lourdes Guero Lopez, 29, and Maria del Rocio Cuevas 
Guerra, 43, who had been renting the apartment for Constanzo. 
</P>
<P>
All five were presented to reporters at the attorney general's office, where 
they stood behind a table bearing confiscated cult items, including artifacts 
allegedly used during religious rituals in the apartment. Among them were black 
candles, a blindfolded statue of St. Anthony, jagged swords, a wax skull draped 
with beads, women's black clothing and singed $20 bills. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Mexican police had sought Constanzo and Aldrete since early April, 
when the first of 15 bodies was found at a ranch outside Matamoros, a border 
city across from Brownsville, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Among the victims found at the border ranch was Mark Kilroy, 21, a University 
of Texas student who disappeared March 14 in Matamoros. 
</P>
<P>
The Constanzo group practiced Santeria, a Caribbean religion with West African 
roots whose adherents usually sacrifice animals but not humans. However, 
Constanzo and his followers reportedly made the ritualistic human sacrifices to 
seek the devil's protection from police for their marijuana-smuggling 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Choice Seemed to Be Random 
</P>
<P>
Kilroy apparently was selected at random when Constanzo ordered his henchmen to 
bring him an Anglo male. 
</P>
<P>
De Leon, a bearded man dressed in slacks and a dirty white shirt, showed 
reporters arrow-shaped tattoos that he said Constanzo had drawn on his shoulder 
as part of a cult ritual. De Leon said he joined the cult for protection after 
committing another, unrelated, murder in Matamoros. 
</P>
<P>
He said Constanzo told his followers that the human sacrifices would make 
things "go better for us in the future, that we would receive protection." 
</P>
<P>
De Leon said he took part in the killings of Kilroy and some of the others on 
the ranch. But he and Aldrete indicated that Constanzo had carried out most of 
the killings himself. 
</P>
<P>
Asked who killed Kilroy, Aldrete said: "Adolfo." 
</P>
<P>
De Leon said Constanzo "went crazy" when he realized that the police had found 
them at the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"He grabbed a bundle of money and threw it and began shooting out the window," 
De Leon said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Had to Obey' 
</P>
<P>
"He ordered me to kill him and Quintana Rodriguez," De Leon said. "He told me 
that he was the boss and that I had to obey . . . . I didn't have any choice. I 
had to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Aldrete denied any involvement in the cult's slayings and said she was not even 
aware of them until she saw the bodies of some of the victims on television. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw the things on the television, watching all the sacrifices and all 
that, I just . . . . It was amazing," Aldrete said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she was in love with Constanzo, she said: "I did not love him, but I 
followed him." 
</P>
<P>
Aldrete said she was sorry about the deaths of Kilroy and the others. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sorry because when he disappeared I was trying to help the (Kilroy) 
family," she said in response to reporters' questions. She did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had known it was like this, I wouldn't have been in it," she said of the 
cult. 
</P>
<P>
Constanzo and Aldrete, missing since the first bodies were uncovered on the 
Matamoros ranch, were among 11 people named in the United States in a 
four-count drug indictment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charges Include Homicide 
</P>
<P>
Aldrete, De Leon and the others are being held here on charges that include 
homicide, criminal association, wounding a police agent during the arrest and 
damage to property, Assistant Atty. Gen. Abraham Polo Uscanga said. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press reported that in Brownsville, American law enforcement 
officials expressed relief that the five were arrested in Mexico, not the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"They committed the crimes in Mexico," said Oran Neck, chief U.S. Customs 
Service agent in the city at Texas' southern tip. "If they committed murder in 
Mexico, we can't charge them here." 
</P>
<P>
FBI agent Bob Nixon in Brownsville agreed. "It's great," Nixon said. "It will 
save us from having to extradite them" to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reason we were looking for them was so we could extradite them to 
Mexico so they could be tried there," Nixon said. "The only purpose of the drug 
indictments here was to have probable cause to pick them up and turn them over 
to Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
Under Mexican law, the maximum punishment any of the suspects could receive is 
50 years in prison.

CRACKS IN MEXICO OPPOSITION THREATEN TO DERAIL CARDENAS 
</P>

TEJUPILCO, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At dusk, as the church bells rang and clouds threatened rain, hundreds of 
farmers crowded into the central square of this mountain town to cheer leftist 
leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas. 
</P>
<P>
Weathered faces peered earnestly at the makeshift stage where Cardenas was 
about to speak. Suddenly a gray-bearded man grabbed the microphone and shouted 
questions at the former presidential candidate: 
</P>
<P>
"What is it you want for Mexico? What should we expect from you?" 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas called the interruption a "provocation" but answered the questions. 
</P>
<P>
"'We are building the Democratic Revolutionary Party, an independent party of 
the Mexican people," he said. "And we are determined not to make alliances with 
the government that is responsible for fraud, for paying the foreign debt and 
for keeping the people in misery." 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas, who used to be a member of the party that has governed Mexico for 60 
years, shook the foundations of the Mexican political system last July by 
uniting disparate leftist groups and winning an unprecedented 31% of the votes 
cast for president. Afterward, his followers charged that the ruling 
Institutional Revolutionary Party had stolen the election, casting doubt on the 
political legitimacy of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
</P>
<P>
But since that heady showing, Cardenas has faced political troubles of his own. 
The National Democratic Front, a coalition of four parties that supported 
Cardenas for the presidency, has failed to work together in several state 
elections and has lost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cracks in Coalition 
</P>
<P>
One of the parties, the nominally Marxist-Leninist Socialist Workers, has 
returned to an association with the PRI, as the ruling party is universally 
called. When two other parties in the front refused to condemn the Socialist 
Workers' "betrayal," as Cardenas called it, he withdrew from the coalition. As 
a result, the original bloc of more than 130 Cardenas votes in the 500-seat 
federal Chamber of Deputies has disintegrated. 
</P>
<P>
Amid this disarray, Cardenas candidates may have lost the advantage they were 
believed to have in forthcoming elections in Michoacan and Baja California, 
states that Cardenas won last July. 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas attributes the problems to the difficulty of converting a social 
movement into a political party and to the PRI's historic ability to co-opt its 
opponents. He charges that the ruling party bought off Rafael Aguilar 
Talamantes, leader of the defecting Socialist Workers Party. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone has his price," Cardenas said in an interview. "For some it is high 
and for others it is low. They couldn't buy us off, because our price is the 
government." 
</P>
<P>
In the 10 months since the election, Cardenas has not stopped campaigning. He 
spends at least half of every month touring the country in a station wagon, 
holding meetings in towns like this one, about 80 miles southwest of Mexico 
City, where he walked around the plaza in blue jeans and work boots, shaking 
the roughened hands of farmers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sign-Up Campaign 
</P>
<P>
At a street corner, a hand-painted sign was draped on the side of a white 
station wagon, saying, "Cuauhtemoc Cardenas invites you to form the PRD" -- the 
initials of his new party. The tailgate of the car was open, and a man was on 
hand to sign up members. 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas says he has collected the 65,000 voters' signatures needed to enroll 
the PRD as a legal political party, and the party held its founding convention 
over the weekend in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
The leftist Mexican Socialist Party is giving up its name and is being 
incorporated into the PRD. Cardenas and those who abandoned the PRI with him 
have failed to persuade the other, less radical parties to incorporate with 
them and now are vulnerable to charges that the PRD is too far to the left for 
most Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas won at least 4 million more votes than the leftist parties had ever 
received in a national election. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeks Multi-Party System 
</P>
<P>
The new party's founding convention worked on a party platform, which Cardenas 
says calls for a multi-party political system for Mexico with free elections 
and an end to government corruption. 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas said the party will press for reform of the electoral laws, for 
reducing the power of the presidency and for stopping payment on the foreign 
debt. Cardenas personally opposes any weakening of the foreign investment law, 
which requires that at least 51% of all companies in Mexico be owned by 
Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
Herberto Castillo, of the Mexican Socialist Party, said that the PRD does not 
define itself as socialist and that "no one in the PRD has proposed the 
annihilation of private property." 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas said that unions and farmers groups must be independent of political 
parties. Most of the country's major unions now belong to the PRI, but some 
leaders of the independent teachers movement, which has led a three-week school 
strike, would like to affiliate with the Cardenas party. 
</P>
<P>
"The first lesson of the teachers strike is that the movement should be 
independent," Cardenas said. "That's what gives it its strength and that's what 
gets a response from the government." 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas followers deny that Salinas, who was a weak presidential candidate, 
has been a more formidable opponent as president than they had expected. They 
say his spectacular arrests of Oil Workers Union leader Joaquin Hernandez 
Galicia, reputed drug lord Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo and financier Eduardo 
Legorreta represent a "settling of accounts" by PRI officials and have not 
gained him popularity. 
</P>
<P>
"The people are worried about food prices and housing," Cardenas said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Optimistic on Upcoming Vote 
</P>
<P>
Publicly, Cardenas and his followers say that despite the collapse of their 
original coalition, they are optimistic about scheduled July elections for 
governor and mayors in Baja California and for the state legislature in 
Michoacan. 
</P>
<P>
Privately, they say that even if they lose these elections, they are better off 
in the long run with their own party, independent of the "PRI satellite 
parties." They have their sights set on national congressional elections in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
PRD leader Porfirio Munoz Ledo says he believes the original four-party 
alliance was a mistake. The small parties that have traditionally supported the 
PRI, he said, grew stronger in membership and federal deputies with Cardenas 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas says he had no choice at the time the alliance was formed, because he 
had no party of his own. 
</P>
<P>
"The other parties were independent at that moment," he said. "If they were 
independent now, we would still be together." 
</P>
<P>
Francisco Ortiz Mendoza, whose Popular Socialist Party was a key element of the 
National Democratic Front, blames Cardenas for the split. Cardenas condemned 
Aguilar Talamantes of the Socialist Workers for inviting the PRI to celebrate 
the 51st anniversary of Mexico's nationalization of its oil industry, a step 
taken in the late 1930s by Cardenas' father, the late President Lazaro 
Cardenas. Ortiz says Cardenas had no right to make such a condemnation. Aguilar 
Talamantes has since met with President Salinas and is expected to side with 
the PRI in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"Cardenas made a serious mistake," Ortiz said. "He had the opportunity to 
become not just the leader of a party but a national leader, even a leader for 
the continent, as (Chilean President Salvador) Allende was." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grass-Roots Support 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas insists that divisions that split the Democratic Front at the top have 
not filtered down to the base, and this seemed to be true in Tejupilco, where 
farmers appealed to Cardenas for help in seeking credit and government-sold 
fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
The farmers seemed to have an almost mystical attachment to Cardenas, who is 
dark-skinned as they are, and whose father was revered for his agrarian reform 
and public works projects. 
</P>
<P>
"We have beautiful watermelon, radishes -- big radishes -- corn and onions, all 
because his father built us a dam," one of the farmers, Juan Lopez, said. "His 
father is dead, but we trust in the one who is still alive."

Calling him "one of the most dangerous criminals to come out of society," a 
district attorney has urged Kings County residents to sign a petition opposing 
parole for Booker T. Hillery, convicted twice of murdering a Hanford girl 27 
years ago. Dist. Atty. Garry Gonzalves was one of many county law enforcement 
officials backing the petition drive prompted byHillery's 10th parole hearing 
June 22. Fifteen thousand people signed the first petition circulated for a 
parole hearing after Hillery was sentenced to a life term two years ago on his 
second conviction. Hillery was convicted of stabbing 15-year-old Marlene Miller 
in her throat with her own scissors as she sewed a party dress March 21, 1962.

A mint-condition example of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec's 1891 music hall poster 
"Moulin Rouge" set a world poster auction record of $220,000 during a 
$1.2-million auction of 540 rare posters in New York. The 30-square-foot 
lithograph was sold to an American private collector who asked to remain 
anonymous. The previous world auction record for a poster was $95,000 paid in 
1987 for another example of "Moulin Rouge" in Paris. The poster, advertising 
"concert and dancing every night," shows the popular entertainer La Goulue -- 
"The Glutton" -- dancing the can-can.

More than 70,000 Armenians marched peacefully through the center of Yerevan, 
the capital of the Soviet republic, demanding the release of detained 
nationalist activists, a Soviet journalist said. A reporter for the Novosti 
news agency said between 70,000 and 100,000 marchers filed past Communist Party 
and government headquarters. He said he knew of no arrests following the 
demonstration, which was staged without official permission. It was the third 
demonstration in as many weeks calling for the release of 14 members of the 
banned Karabakh Committee, which has spearheaded a campaign demanding that 
administration of the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh be transferred 
from the republic of Azerbaijan to Armenia.

OFFICER'S DEED SAVES SUSPECT

Still wearing his shoes and his seven-pound bulletproof vest, Fresno Police 
Officer Patrick Farmer swam 75 yards across a pond to save a robbery suspect 
from drowning. Police had chased three suspects in a fast-food restaurant 
holdup to a ponding basin, where they abandoned a car. Two were captured 
quickly and Farmer heard the third, David Mendoza, 19, shout for help from the 
water. Farmer, who was trained in rescuing drowning people while serving in the 
Navy, took off his duty belt carrying his pistol and handcuffs and jumped into 
the water. "I didn't have time to take off my bulletproof vest, and I left on 
my shoes because I didn't know what the bottom of the pond was like," Farmer 
said. "Looking back, I probably should have taken off the shoes and the vest, 
because they really got in the way." Farmer said Mendoza didn't say anything to 
him afterward, "but I heard him tell one of the other officers, 'Hey, tell that 
cop thanks for me.' "

The Philadelphia Public Health Department will allow bathhouses, adult 
bookstores and adult movie theaters to remain open as long as customers are 
provided with free condoms and AIDS prevention information, according to a 
published report. The Philadelphia Inquirer detailed the department's official 
policy, which was made public Friday through the city's AIDS Activities 
Coordinating Office. The policy differs from those in cities such as San 
Francisco, where health officials closed down bathhouses because of evidence 
that sex between strangers there was spreading the AIDS virus, the Inquirer 
said.

French Premier Michel Rocard said elections in the South Pacific territory of 
New Caledonia will proceed as planned, reversing an earlier decision to 
postpone the balloting because of the slaying of two independence leaders. 
Rocard was among 5,000 who attended the funerals in the capital of Noumea of 
Jean-Marie Tjibaou, leader of the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front, 
and Tjibaou's top assistant, Yeiwene Yeiwene. The two were killed on the island 
of Ouvea on Thursday by Djubelly Wea, a hard-line separatist opposed to 
Tjibaou's moderate policies. Wea was killed by Tjibaou's bodyguards after the 
attack.

Assassins shot to death a legislator from Peru's ruling party, the second such 
slaying in nine days. Pablo Li Ormeno, who represented the Lima area in the 
Chamber of Deputies, was slain by two men in a slum on Lima's outskirts, the 
government news agency Andina said. President Alan Garcia cut short a trip to 
Brazil, where he was attending a summit on the Amazon, to attend Li Ormeno's 
wake. No one claimed responsibility for the killing, although authorities 
blamed Maoist Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) guerrillas. On April 27, 
congressional deputy Eriberto Arroyo was killed in an attack police blamed on 
the Shining Path, although the rebel group denied it was responsible.

Local homeowners and the Sierra Club have joined forces to fight a Squaw Valley 
Ski Corp. expansion project. They say the cutting of more than 1,800 trees in 
Shirley Canyon and Tram Bowl to make way for new ski lifts would destroy the 
valley's last remaining pristine area and damage its watershed. The Sierra Club 
has filed suit to block the tree-cutting and the Squaw Valley Homeowners Assn. 
supports the action. A Superior Court ruling, expected in about 60 days, could 
require a second environmental impact statement or could give the go-ahead for 
the cutting. "We're trying to protect Squaw Valley from adverse development," 
said Janice Flannigan, association vice president. The suit contends Placer 
County supervisors erred by allowing the cutting since their decision was based 
on an incomplete environmental impact study. Ski corporation owner Alex Cushing 
defended the supervisors, saying the study was done by qualified experts and 
adequately addressed environmental concerns.

PLAN FOR ALIEN JAIL ON RESERVATION MEETS OPPOSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
VIEJAS INDIAN RESERVATION, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like other American Indian communities nationwide, the impoverished Viejas band 
of Mission Indians has considerable land but is in dire need of jobs and 
development. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has lots of 
jobs and a large budget but needs more jail space to house some of the hundreds 
of thousands of illegal aliens it arrests every year in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
A singular convergence of these two contrasting needs is unfolding in a scenic 
backcountry valley, home of the Viejas Indian Reservation in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
The INS has awarded a contract to a private corporation, Esmor Inc., to build 
and operate a jail on reservation property to house the undocumented 
immigrants. Most of those to be held at the 240-bed jail would be undocumented 
Central Americans, many of them partial or full-blooded Indians -- a fact that 
has stirred debate about whether such a jail is an appropriate use of 
reservation territory. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of ironic to put a prison facility on an Indian reservation in 
America to house people from Mexico and Central America who are also Indian," 
said Barbara Muller, a 36-year-old mother of two who lives on the reservation 
and is opposed to the plan. "I just don't like the image of the INS being on an 
Indian reservation." 
</P>
<P>
The Viejas tribal council has approved the plan; all that's needed is final 
approval by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs. The facility, costing as much as 
$5 million, could be under construction within a month and occupied by late 
fall, said an official of Esmor, one of a number of private jail providers that 
have sprung up nationally in recent years as federal and local law enforcement 
agencies look for less-costly alternatives to public jails. 
</P>
<P>
The plan to build the jail on the reservation, home to about 250 people, is one 
of the vast array of potentially revenue-enhancing proposals considered by the 
nation's Indian communities, where unemployment and despair are chronic. Some 
leaders have attempted to entice virtually any kind of development to the 
reservations, from mines to ski lodges to factories to farms. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the tribes are looking for anything that will bring income," noted 
Suzan Harjo, executive director of the Washington-based National Congress of 
American Indians, the best-known Indian-rights organization. 
</P>
<P>
Bingo gambling, which Viejas has long sought, has become well-established at 
other reservations throughout the country. And two years ago, backcountry San 
Diego residents were relieved when the Campo band of Mission Indians scrapped a 
plan to house a plant to drain cancer-causing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) 
from old transformers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Plan Spreading 
</P>
<P>
The planned jail at Viejas is one of a number being contemplated throughout the 
region, reflecting the philosophy of the Ronald Reagan and Bush administrations 
that incarceration is an effective deterrent to illegal immigration. Many 
critics disagree with the policy, particularly when it comes to Central 
Americans, who are often fleeing political turmoil and warfare, as well as 
economic underdevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
Though Mexican nationals represent the great majority of undocumented 
immigrants arrested, most are quickly returned to Mexico, obviating the need 
for detention space. But many Central Americans file a formal request for 
political amnesty, which precludes deportation until the request is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Such broad policy questions seem far from the debate at Viejas, a sleepy, 
insular community spread over 1,600 rolling acres of chaparral and pasture. 
Tribal leaders have applauded the plan to build the jail on a 10-acre piece of 
land as a necessary step for economic development. The proposal was approved by 
75% of the band's enrolled members who were at a public session, tribal 
documents state, but it is unclear how many of the 100 or so voting members 
were there for the vote. 
</P>
<P>
The band would receive $10,000 a month for the life of the 25-year lease with 
Esmor; the first 18 months of rent would be provided up front to purchase an 
additional 90 acres of land near the northwestern part of the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the monetary rewards, objections persist. 
</P>
<P>
The reservation sits just 20 miles north of the U.S.-Mexico border and is 
frequently traversed by undocumented border-crossers heading north. Older band 
members recall crossing the border casually to shop, before the time of 
widespread formal inspections. Today, dark-skinned residents say they are 
occasionally stopped by U.S. Border Patrol officers and asked whether they are 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Relatives Across Border 
</P>
<P>
Muller, the mother of two, notes that just 30 miles south of the reservation -- 
in Mexico -- there are Indians related to the Viejas band. Such people, she 
said, could theoretically end up in custody on Viejas property as undocumented 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Many tribal members wary of the jail plan note that the benefits of Viejas' 
largest commercial development, a long-established campground, have yet to 
filter down to residents. In the 41-page proposed lease for the jail property, 
Esmor has vowed to attempt to hire Viejas members or other Indians during jail 
construction and the subsequent operation "to the greatest extent feasible." 
But no jobs among the 50 to 60 full-time positions are guaranteed to the 
Indians. (A handful of INS personnel will also be on site.) 
</P>
<P>
To some, the potential rewards seem slight compared to the likely upset -- the 
comings and goings of Border Patrol vans and workers' vehicles, the glaring 
lights, the noise, the fences, the possible escapes from the quiet valley that 
abuts Interstate 8 near rural Alpine. 
</P>
<P>
"A jail's not going to help anybody," said Dianna Vigil, a 32-year-old mother 
of five whose home is near the proposed site. "There'll be a lot of patrolling, 
a lot of fences going up, a lot of lights. We won't be able to let our kids out 
like we do now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Hearings 
</P>
<P>
Some said there had not been proper public notice about the plan, though the 
tribal council has held at least two public hearings on the matter -- one last 
July and one in December. 
</P>
<P>
Mabel Velasquez, an enrolled tribal member who attended the session at which 
the matter was voted on, said she recalled that fewer than one-third of the 100 
or so voting band members attended that critical session. 
</P>
<P>
"They should have been going door to door, telling people what was going on," 
said Velasquez, who said she voted against the plan, fearing it would upset the 
reservation's quiet pace. "You just have to be here in this environment to 
appreciate the quality and the blackness. I can imagine them lighting up our 
skies." 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Pico, the tribal chairman, said neither he nor other tribal council 
members can comment on the matter. He cited a policy not to make public 
statements on development projects. Records of the council meetings are not 
available to the general public. 
</P>
<P>
The jail proposal is the culmination of several years of discussions between 
INS officials and several San Diego-area Indian bands over possible sites for 
jails. The Barona band of Mission Indians, near the Viejas band, considered 
such a plan in 1986-87 but scrapped the idea after intense opposition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Year-Old Plan 
</P>
<P>
The current proposal was born about a year ago, when Esmor representatives 
contacted Viejas officials, according to Richard P. Staley, Esmor's vice 
president. In December, the INS awarded Esmor the contract to construct and 
manage the facility, said Christine Davis, assistant regional INS commissioner 
for detention and deportation in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Esmor is a firm barely more than a year old -- formed specifically to 
participate in the fast-growing commercial jail business, according to Staley, 
a 30-year INS veteran and one of a number of former INS officials affiliated 
with Esmor. The company also has an INS contract in Seattle and plans to 
operate a facility for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons in New York, Staley said. 
</P>
<P>
As for safety concerns at the minimum-security facility, Staley said that no 
dangerous "criminal aliens" -- those convicted of serious non-immigration 
crimes -- would be housed there. "It's not correct to say it's a day-room 
environment, but you know what I'm talking about," Staley said. "It's a clean 
type of industry." 
</P>
<P>
However, Davis, the INS official in charge of deportation matters, said she 
could not rule out the possibility that some criminal aliens might be 
temporarily housed on the reservation, though the facility is not intended for 
them. Men, women and children would be housed at the concrete jail, which would 
consist of 16-bed dormitories and two interior courtyards to be used for 
recreation.

GUY WILLIAMS, 'ZORRO' OF TV SERIES, DIES AT 65 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN H. LEE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guy Williams, the actor who starred in the popular 1950s television series 
"Zorro," has died in Buenos Aires, Argentina, authorities there said Sunday. He 
was 65. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' body was found by police Saturday in his apartment in the exclusive 
residential neighborhood of La Recoleta. He apparently suffered a heart attack 
and died about a week ago, the government news agency Telam reported. An 
investigation was begun to confirm the exact cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot, 3-inch second-generation Italian-American, whose real name was 
Armando Catalano, was chosen by Walt Disney Studios to portray Zorro on the 
small screen in a role made famous in motion pictures by Douglas Fairbanks Sr. 
and later by Tyrone Power. 
</P>
<P>
The television series recounted the adventures of Zorro and his alter-identity, 
Diego de la Vega, a seemingly spoiled son of a Spanish aristocrat. 
</P>
<P>
De la Vega presented himself, to the chagrin of his father, as a disinterested 
and apathetic overseer of a ranch in the section of 1820s colonial California 
that was to become Los Angeles. When confronted with injustice, De la Vega 
secretly transformed into a Robin Hood-like defender of his countrymen against 
the abuses of Spanish overlords. 
</P>
<P>
Zorro identified himself to villains and victims with trademark bullwhip, black 
mask, cape and -- perhaps most endearing to audiences -- his signature of using 
his foil to "make the sign of the Z" at the site of an escapade. 
</P>
<P>
Extensive previous training in fencing helped Williams get the part in the 
series, which was produced from 1957 to 1959. It continues to run on the Disney 
Channel. 
</P>
<P>
Williams also starred as professor John Robinson in the 1965-1968 series "Lost 
in Space," portraying the patriarch of a futuristic family on a space 
exploration mission gone awry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family in Space 
</P>
<P>
The series followed the family in their sabotaged spaceship as they tried to 
find their way home from a neighboring solar system. 
</P>
<P>
Between the two television series, Williams starred in two movies that won him 
little attention: "The Prince and the Pauper" in 1962 and "Captain Sinbad" in 
1963. 
</P>
<P>
The son of an insurance broker, Williams grew up in New York City, where he 
attended public schools. After graduating from high school, he attended a 
military academy. Williams' father wanted him to pursue an insurance brokerage 
career, but Williams got into modeling and subsequently acting. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was a frequent visitor to Buenos Aires and had apparently lived there 
alone for the last several months. 
</P>
<P>
Williams had two children with wife Janice Cooper, a former model. A son, 
Steven, was born in 1952 and a daughter, Toni, was born in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate word on funeral arrangements.

SWEEPING MOVES TO AID TEACHERS WILL GET HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE WOO, Times Education Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Addressing issues that cut to the heart of a prolonged and bitter labor 
dispute, the Los Angeles Board of Education today will consider several 
sweeping proposals to upgrade teachers' status, including bringing their 
salaries in line with administrators' pay. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the changes -- which would also require administrators to teach 
every other year -- would move the Los Angeles Unified School District into the 
front ranks of school systems nationwide that face a shortage of qualified 
instructors and are searching for ways to make the teaching profession more 
appealing. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals have stirred debate locally and have rankled many administrators, 
who are already steaming over earlier suggestions that they take pay cuts to 
give teachers higher salaries. 
</P>
<P>
Even teachers are not united behind all of the proposals. Although teachers all 
want higher pay, many -- including local union officials -- fear such ideas 
might lead to wide salary differentials among teachers based on merit and 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alleged Inequities 
</P>
<P>
Board member Jackie Goldberg, the author of the proposals, said the measures 
address the deep anger of teachers about inequities in prestige, power and pay 
that she says are built into the practices and policies of school systems 
throughout the country, including the Los Angeles district. 
</P>
<P>
"What does it mean to have a system where the further away you get from 
teaching children, the more money you're paid?" said Goldberg, who taught high 
school for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The current system means teachers have to leave the classroom even if they 
would rather remain, she said. "That is not healthy for an educational 
institution. . . . The teaching profession, as it now stands, is not held in 
high enough esteem." 
</P>
<P>
The changes would not take effect for at least two or three years and the 
board, which has been divided over questions of teacher pay and power, may have 
difficulty agreeing on all of the proposed steps. 
</P>
<P>
But, if approved, the measures could help ease the resentment among district 
teachers, who have threatened to go on strike May 30 if their contract dispute 
has not been settled. Chief among the teachers' union's demands are a 21% pay 
increase over two years and teacher control of new school decision-making 
councils. The district has offered a 21.5% raise over three years and wants 
teachers, administrators and parents to have equal authority on the school 
councils. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg has called for a restructuring of district salaries so that a teacher 
could earn as much or more than an administrator with the same credentials, 
education, experience and working hours. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the restructuring would be a "career ladder" that would enable some 
teachers to assume greater responsibilities at higher pay without having to 
become an administrator. She wants Supt. Leonard Britton to appoint a task 
force of teachers and administrators to devise several models for a new pay 
scale by July, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1980s, a number of national and state reports on the need to 
overhaul public education have urged school districts to take such steps. One 
of the first districts to implement these types of reforms on a broad scale is 
the Rochester City School District in New York, where teachers can earn up to 
$70,000 a year by performing extra duties, such as advising and coaching other 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Affected 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg's proposals would affect about 425 central office administrators and 
1,500 principals, assistant principals and other school-based managers. 
</P>
<P>
The district has separate pay scales for teachers and administrators. Under 
current salaries, a teacher with a bachelor's degree and no classroom 
experience earns $23,440 annually. It takes about 19 years and a master's or 
doctorate degree to reach top pay of $43,000. 
</P>
<P>
The district pays an extra $153 a year to teachers with a master's degree and 
an extra $408 annually to those with a Ph.D. 
</P>
<P>
In general, a teacher who has spent five years in the classroom and has earned 
an administrative credential, can apply for an administrative job. All 
principals and assistant principals are also required to have a master's 
degree. 
</P>
<P>
The pay scale for administrators with teaching credentials ranges from about 
$37,000 for program coordinators to $95,600 for associate superintendents. (The 
superintendent and two deputy superintendents earn executive flat salaries of 
$141,000 and $125,200, respectively.) 
</P>
<P>
A full-time elementary school principal can move from a beginning salary of 
$52,200 to the maximum salary of $63,325 in five years. Full-time high school 
principals start at $58,000 and can earn up to $72,800 by the end of five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pay Schedule 
</P>
<P>
Administrators are paid for eight hours per day and work 221 days, 234 or 261 a 
year. Teachers are paid for six hours per day and work 204 days a year. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg maintains that the separate pay scales fail to reflect the fact that 
teachers are better educated than in the past. All of the district's 32,000 
teachers have a bachelor's degree, nearly a third -- 9,120 -- have master's 
degrees, and about 350 have doctorate degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about a very different level of the profession today, and it's 
time that the structure of the district in terms of salary and responsibilities 
reflect that difference," Goldberg said. "It's not a matter of saying that 
teachers are more important (than administrators). But right now we are sending 
the message that administrators are more important because of what we pay them. 
That gulf doesn't and shouldn't exist anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Some teachers said the proposed salary changes are long overdue. "If this goes 
through, it would set a precedent," said Marcia Liebman, a teacher at Magnolia 
Avenue School near downtown Los Angeles. "There are different kinds of 
responsibilities that administrators have and different kinds of responsibility 
that teachers have. You can't say one has more responsibility. (So) the pay 
should be equitable." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Extreme Reservations' 
</P>
<P>
Walker Brown, executive director of Associated Administrators of Los Angeles, 
which represents district principals and assistant principals, said the 
organization has "extreme reservations" about the proposed changes, 
particularly those relating to pay. 
</P>
<P>
"If the salary schedule is based solely on experience, college, years with the 
district, administrators would be at the top," he said. "But if it is based on 
some other criteria, the purpose of which is to bring teachers up and bring 
administrators down . . . that suggests no brownie points for being a senior 
high principal, and that tends to deny the traditional concept of 
responsibility and accountability being remunerated." 
</P>
<P>
Board member Rita Walters is also critical of the proposals. "A principal is 
responsible for 20 to 100 teachers, all of the staff in the building, all the 
scheduling. That responsibility exceeds that of being prepared for teaching a 
single class," she said during a board discussion of the proposals last week. 
"There is an anti-administration bias here." 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg has also proposed a requirement that all administrators with teaching 
credentials return to teaching periodically to stay in touch with "the 
realities of the classroom." Under her proposal, principals, assistant 
principals and deans would have to teach the equivalent of one course for one 
semester every other year, while central office administrators would have to 
spend 45 hours in a classroom every other year. Many principals spend some time 
teaching, such as when substitutes are not available, but there is no district 
policy that requires them to teach on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Union View 
</P>
<P>
Frances Haywood, vice president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, the teachers' 
union, said teachers could wholeheartedly support the concept of administrators 
having to teach periodically. 
</P>
<P>
She also agreed with the basic premise of making teacher and administrator 
salaries more equal but stopped short of endorsing Goldberg's proposal. "If a 
teacher is making $40,000 and an administrator is making $80,000, there's 
something obscene about that pay schedule," she said. "But I would like to see 
much more detail on how (Goldberg) plans to go about structuring it." 
</P>
<P>
Haywood said the teacher union opposes paying some teachers more than others on 
the basis of merit and duties, which is the concept behind the career ladder. 
"What money is out there should be equitably given to everybody until everybody 
gets to a decent level (of pay)," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Most California school districts, including Los Angeles, have the beginnings of 
a career ladder in the state mentor teacher program. The state provides 
districts with money to pay an extra $4,000 a year to a select group of 
teachers who are relieved of some of their regular duties to perform other 
tasks, such as helping to train new instructors or write curriculum outlines. 
The pay increase is temporary, however, with mentor teachers generally serving 
no more than three years and then returning to their regular posts.

The bacteria that cause food poisoning can be altered to make improved vaccines 
that may be able to ward off a wide variety of infections, perhaps including 
AIDS, scientists reported. 
</P>
<P>
To develop the new vaccines, Stanford University researchers genetically 
modified the thin, corkscrew-shaped filaments or propellers, called flagella, 
which the salmonella bacteria use to swim. 
</P>
<P>
These flagella can be changed into vaccines to protect against infections for 
which there are no current immunizations, the scientists reported recently in 
the journal, Science. The method is an important step toward developing better 
medications that program the body's immune system to recognize and prevent 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
One test vaccine stimulated an immune response to cholera toxin in mice, the 
researchers found. In addition, other vaccines produced by the novel method 
stimulated immune responses in mice, rabbits and guinea pigs to antigens -- 
proteins that stimulate antibody production -- of several disease-causing 
microorganisms, including the AIDS virus, malaria parasite, hepatitis B virus 
and a hemolytic streptococcus, which results in strep throat.

DIET-BLOOD PRESSURE LINK SEEN

New experimental data supports the suspicion that getting enough potassium in 
the diet may play a key part in keeping blood pressure under control. The 
research suggests that when people do not get enough potassium in their diet, 
their bodies fail to get rid of enough salt, which makes their blood pressure 
go up. 
</P>
<P>
Epidemiological studies that look at large groups of people have found an 
association between low potassium intake and high blood pressure. But experts 
were uncertain whether the potassium or some other nutritional deficiency was 
responsible. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest study, doctors compared the blood pressures of 10 healthy people 
on very low-potassium diets and on diets with normal amounts of the nutrient. 
</P>
<P>
"When these people ate diets low in potassium, their blood pressures went up. 
One of the main reasons seems to be related to sodium excretion. When not 
eating enough potassium, they could not get rid of enough sodium," said Dr. G. 
Gopal Krishna, who directed the study at Temple University in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

CANCER SURVIVAL RATE RISES

Survival rates for a common type of childhood cancer improved markedly at a 
leading medical center after doctors started using chemotherapy more 
aggressively, a study showed last week. 
</P>
<P>
In findings presented at the Society for Pediatric Research's annual meeting, 
Dr. Laura Bowman of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., 
said the overall four-year survival rate for neuroblastoma has improved from 
37% to 55% during the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
Neuroblastoma, which originates in the adrenal gland or nerve tissue near the 
spinal cord, is the most common childhood solid tumor after brain tumors, 
Bowman noted. If the cancer is not caught in its early stages, it often spreads 
to the lymph nodes, liver, bone and bone marrow. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, doctors sometimes have been reluctant to rush childhood cancer 
patients into chemotherapy because of possible toxic side effects. But about 10 
years ago, St. Jude doctors started using several "front line" chemotherapy 
drugs on neuroblastoma patients as soon as possible, Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
Since that time, the four-year survival rate for children younger than 1 year 
old -- whose disease is often not as advanced as in older youngsters -- has 
climbed from 48% to 89%, the doctor said.

BODY CLOCK THEORY CHALLENGED

<P>
A study questions the conventional view of how mammals keep the biological 
clock in their brains synchronized with the 24-hour day, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called circadian clock governs a host of body processes, and disruptions 
lead to such conditions as jet lag and some cases of insomnia. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists generally believe that in most mammals, the brain maintains the 
clock's 24-hour rhythm chiefly by monitoring light and darkness in the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
But the new study found that onset of darkness failed to exert its usual effect 
in hamsters if the animals were immobilized. So the real clock-setting 
mechanism may be the physical activity that darkness usually causes in 
hamsters, researchers suggest. 
</P>
<P>
The work was presented in the British journal, Nature, by Fred Turek of 
Northwestern University and O. Van Reeth of the Free University of Brussels.

STUDENT DESIGNS FOR A POWER-PACKED AUDIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA FOLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What started seven years ago as a table-top fashion show at the Hard Rock Cafe 
has evolved into a black-tie, standing-room-only, theatrical event of epic 
proportions. 
</P>
<P>
The Seventh Annual Critics Awards Show for the Otis Art Institute of Parsons 
School of Design was staged in the International Ballroom of the Beverly Hilton 
Hotel on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
It was a zany and enlightening look at the future, as well as the past and 
present, of California fashion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
90-Minute Show 
</P>
<P>
The students themselves represented the future. Twenty graduating seniors and 
20 juniors showed their accomplishments in a 90-minute fashion show. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't come up with any startling new ideas. Rather, they seemed to be 
imitating their critics' tastes and collections, possibly stifling their own, 
brave, new fashion inventions in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Menswear designs, although classically inclined, showed the most imagination. 
Adult and child versions of boxy jackets worn with walking shorts were witty 
yet wearable. Some unexpected pattern mixes -- checks, stripes and dots -- 
looked new. Other notables were walking-short suits, vests in unusual shapes, 
and a pair of trousers cropped at mid-calf that made them look intentionally 
too short. 
</P>
<P>
To a greater extent than ever, the school is a recruiting ground for new 
talent. And the audience reflected the trend. It was dotted with fashion 
retailers from both coasts, including Industry Committee chairman Robert 
Mettler, president and chief operating officer of Robinson's. Karen Gould, 
whose husband, Michael, is president of Giorgio Beverly Hills, was the 
evening's benefit chair. 
</P>
<P>
From Bloomingdale's in New York came vice president Barbara Kennedy, along with 
several store buyers. 
</P>
<P>
After Saturday night's show there was a silent auction at which many of the 
student designs were sold. Fred Hayman of the Rodeo Drive boutique that carries 
his name placed bids of $1,000 each on four evening outfits. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Nordstrom was the first retail store to sponsor a student award at 
Otis Parsons and carry student designs in the store's junior department. 
</P>
<P>
The evening's honored guest was Elois Jenssen, who designed all of the late 
Lucille Ball's costumes for the "I Love Lucy" show. 
</P>
<P>
After a fantasy skit that featured her work for Ball, she was presented the 
Design Achievement Award, which had been planned for a year. The comedian's 
recent death made the remembrance particularly poignant. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd hushed to pin-drop level when a recording of Lucy's voice filled the 
room. 
</P>
<P>
As for California present, that was represented by the designer-teachers who 
worked with this year's students. Their names are among the best known in the 
Los Angeles contemporary fashion market. Leon Max, Karl Logan, Nancy Heller, 
Robin Piccone of Body Glove, George Machado for Zylos, Gary Nickerson for La 
Blanca swimwear and Tadashi and Eugene Rodriquez for Saturday's among them. All 
served as "student guides" and critics this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Big Winner 
</P>
<P>
Despite the big business and Hollywood overtones of the evening, the awards 
themselves are still the main event for students and their guests. And this 
year's big winner was Mitra Rajabi for the coveted Designer of the Year Award. 
In addition, 12 students received Golden Thimble Awards for excellence in 
specific fashion projects directed by a designer. 
</P>
<P>
The Thimbles went to Rebecca Kaufman for her Nike shoe; Magali Juelle for her 
Stuart Weitzman evening slipper; Paula Corely for her Jocelyn Winship/Body 
Glove Menswear sleek cycling look; Nomi Saraj for her Body Glove Swimwear black 
neoprene bikini and skirt; Jaymie Harris for her La Blanca swimwear hooded 
maillot; Alice Bonner for her Saturday's oversized varsity jacket look; Tracy 
Meagher for her Nordstrom young junior separates; Sally Yuk Wa Chan for her 
Zylos menswear shorts suit; Duncan McKenzie for his Karl Logan red pantsuit; 
Jon Murata for his Leon Max fit-and-flare chocolate-brown wrap coat; Sharon 
Chang for her Nancy Heller English-dandy looks; Sergio Kracer for his 
Tadashi/Bloomingdale's black-lace cocktail dress. 
</P>
<P>
Other Awards included the USA/USSR Design for Peace Team Award, given to Magali 
Juelle, Christopher Ma and Mitra Rajabi; the National Assn. of Menswear Buyer's 
Award given to Alice Bonner; the Mens Apparel Guild in California Award given 
to Christopher Ma; and the Mizuno International Sportswear Design competition 
given to Mitra Rajabi. 
</P>
<P>
The event raised $250,000 for the school.

ARCHITECTURE: FREDERICK FISHER'S HOUSES HAVE FUN BUILT IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Fred Levine, a newly divorced clothing retailer, asked architect Frederick 
Fisher to design a house for him and his two sons in Marina del Rey, his 
instructions were simple: "I just want you to have a good time." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher had a wonderfully inventive time with Levine's new home, completed last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
On a tight, narrow lot, Fisher contrived an airy three-story home. A central, 
sky-lit atrium rising through the house's full height floods its interior with 
light. The bright space is very male and playful, roughly finished with raw 
concrete block, exposed timber framing and splashes of primary colors. 
</P>
<P>
"Intrigue and curiosity in the quirky way the rooms run into one another entice 
Fred and his boys to constantly rediscover the delights of their intimate 
environment," Fisher explained. "If I have a good time designing a house, the 
owners should have a good time living in it." 
</P>
<P>
All the homes, lofts and other commissions Fisher has designed since 
establishing his Santa Monica office in 1980 look as if the architect had a 
thoroughly good time doing them. 
</P>
<P>
This feeling of profound pleasure in the act of design has gained Fisher an 
international reputation as one of Los Angeles' leading avant-garde designers. 
</P>
<P>
His houses are always serious fun. 
</P>
<P>
The first home he designed -- for artist Laurie Caplin and her composer-husband 
Loren-Paul Caplin in Venice -- featured a roof shaped like a series of waves, 
which look as if they are about to break among the palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
A few years later, the addition Fisher designed for screenwriter Kim Jorgensen 
for the old home above Sunset Boulevard that once belonged to Hopalong Cassidy 
(William Boyd) was conceived as an instant "ruin" that seems to have survived 
the earthquakes, fires and landslides that the Hollywood Hills site has 
actually suffered. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Fisher completed a house for artist Roger Herman in a ravine on the 
edge of Elysian Park that resembles a wedge-shaped boat sheathed in raw red 
plywood. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the ranch-style home under construction for television director 
Phil Ramuno in the Agoura Hills is a series of ground-hugging Japanese 
pavilions surrounded by sheltered verandas and calm courtyards. 
</P>
<P>
With all this stylistic variety, what makes a Fisher design distinctive? "I 
guess you could say I have a distinctive approach, rather than a particular and 
unvarying style," he explained. "Since each client and every site is different, 
how can one manner of design fit all?" 
</P>
<P>
He described his design approach as "handling natural light and assembling 
structural pieces. Architecture," he said, "is inherently surrealist, the 
collage of a huge range of materials and objects put together in very personal 
ways. Every building is an act of art, whatever the functional demands." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A New Meaning 
</P>
<P>
Surrealist and assemblage artists from 1920s and '30s, such as Max Ernst, Kurt 
Schwitters and Marcel Duchamp, influence Fisher's architectural method. He sees 
the common aim among these early Modernists as a desire to break everyday 
objects and images down into small pieces to put them together again with fresh 
meaning. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher comes by his art influences honestly. His first degree from Ohio's 
Oberlin College was a BA in art history. He finally decided to follow in his 
architect father's footsteps. In 1973, he entered the UCLA Master of 
Architecture program. 
</P>
<P>
"My coming to Los Angeles was a truly fortunate accident," he said. "UCLA was 
the only postgraduate architecture school that accepted me. I had never 
imagined living in Los Angeles. My typical Midwestern prejudices made me kind 
of reluctant to come to La-La Land, but soon as I got here I realized I'd made 
a lucky move." 
</P>
<P>
Under the benign tutelage of Dean Harvey Perloff, the relatively new UCLA 
Graduate School of Architecture and Urban Planning was becoming an exciting 
place to study in the mid-1970s. The young and eager faculty included many of 
the designers who would put Los Angeles architecture on the global map in the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Real Revelation 
</P>
<P>
"My instructors included Coy Howard, Craig Hodgetts, Robert Mangurian and 
Charles Moore," Fisher said. "But the real revelation was a lecture given by 
Frank Gehry, who was just begining to make his name as an architectural 
innovator and a fresh mind rethinking the stale ideologies of modernism." 
</P>
<P>
After graduation, Fisher went to work in Gehry's Venice office for three years 
before a stroke of chance gave him his first commission, the Caplin house. A 
friendly fellow architect who was originally approached by the Caplins had to 
return to Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"The Caplin house was my apprenticeship," Fisher said. "It was my first 
project, and I tried to pack every idea I had into it. It was a true 
assemblage, not only of every kind of material, shape and structure, but of 
architectural metaphors influenced by Frank (Gehry). I was lucky the design 
came off, more or less." 
</P>
<P>
The Caplin house "delights in its complexity while remaining well mannered," 
Tim Street-Porter, a photographer and architectural writer, says in his book 
"Freestyle." 
</P>
<P>
"Fisher has combined some of Gehry's approaches to detailing with a fresh, 
confident graphic style and romantic use of metaphor." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Sentimental Soul' 
</P>
<P>
Gehry said of his former assistant: "Fred has a subtle yet sentimental soul. 
His later work is more gentle and more thought out. If he continues to develop, 
he could be first-rate." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher, 39, is tall and rangy with intense brown eyes and the slightly startled 
air of an aging boy having more fun than he ever thought possible. Now 
divorced, he lives in Santa Monica with his young son Eric. 
</P>
<P>
The new space Fisher recently has moved his office into on Broadway in Santa 
Monica is a former warehouse with high exposed timber bow trusses and 
unstuccoed brick walls. The office is home to nine assistants and a display of 
models of projects from St. Tropez on the French Riviera to Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the models reveal Fisher's continuing collaboration with artists. He 
designed a loft in downtown Los Angeles that included a waterfall shower by 
sculptor Eric Orr. Last year, Fisher contrived a witty steel and fabric 
sculpture titled "Earthquake Shelter" with Tony Berlant for a traveling exhibit 
sponsored by the American Craft Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Another hat worn by the ever-active Fisher is that of chairman of the 
environmental design department at Otis/Parsons School of Design. Since 1986, 
when Fisher took on the post, he has upgraded a previously prosaic interior 
architecture course into a wide-ranging program that includes artists, 
photographers, set designers and social historians. 
</P>
<P>
"The fascination for me in architecture is that it includes almost every aspect 
of being alive," Fisher said. "It is everything from art to social habit, from 
private feeling to public show. The motto of all architects should be the 
famous Latin dictum that 'I count nothing human foreign to me.' "

'BEST BUDDIES': GETTING INTO SPIRIT OF SPECIAL OLYMPICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anthony Shriver wanted to do something special for the Special Olympics and 
start his soap opera-addicted classmates at Georgetown University on the path 
to something more fulfilling. 
</P>
<P>
He did both by starting Best Buddies, an offshoot of the Special Olympics 
(started by Anthony's parents, Eunice and Sargent Shriver), which pairs 
mentally retarded youths with college students for group and one-on-one 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
So far chapters have started at Georgetown and Catholic universities, and now 
the 23-year-old Shriver has graduated from school and headed West to drum up 
grass-roots support in Los Angeles. A party at Santa Monica's Q gallery last 
week kicked off his efforts, and artist Nancy Frey donated all proceeds from 
sales of her paintings to Best Buddies. 
</P>
<P>
Frey, Shriver and friend Jimmy Shay organized the event, which drew Maria 
Shriver, Maryam D'Abo, Jacqueline Stallone (Sly's mom) and Bruce Jenner.

IN THE MATTER OF LOCKE VS. EASTWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sondra Locke says the telephone call came early in the morning on April 3. 
</P>
<P>
It was Clint Eastwood on the line. He said they needed to talk, and he hurried 
over to the sprawling Bel-Air house that the two had shared intermittently 
since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's conversation that morning was short and to the point. Eastwood, 
58, complained that Locke was "sitting" on his only real estate in Los Angeles, 
and now he wanted her to move out of the house. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him that I couldn't believe that was all he had to say to me after 13 
years," Locke said in a written declaration filed 12 days ago in Los Angeles 
Superior Court as part of her potentially precedent-setting palimony suit 
against Eastwood. 
</P>
<P>
Locke, in the court document, claims that his statements to her that morning 
were her first notification that their increasingly troubled 13-year 
relationship was ending. 
</P>
<P>
Locke, who turns 42 this month, was in the midst of directing her second 
feature film, "Impulse," and had only four hours of sleep the night before. She 
says she begged Eastwood to hold off any discussions about their breakup until 
she had finished the movie. "Clint told me that he understood, that I should 
just 'put it in the back of my head,' and that we would talk about it again 
after I finished 'Impulse,' " Locke recounted in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
But a week later, while on the set of "Impulse," Locke received a second shock: 
a letter from Eastwood's lawyers addressed formally to "Mrs. Gordon Anderson" 
-- Locke's legal identity since her 1969 marriage to a childhood friend. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Eastwood has asked you to vacate the premises," the letter read. "You have 
refused to do so. This is to let you know that in view of your intransigence, 
the locks on all the entrances to the house have been replaced. . . . Your 
possessions accordingly will be placed in storage." 
</P>
<P>
Upon reading the letter, Locke said in the statement, she fainted. 
</P>
<P>
Locke wasn't the only person in the world shocked to learn she was breaking up 
with one of the movies' biggest stars. Her April 26 filing of a palimony suit 
against the intensely private archetypal macho-man of the "Dirty Harry" films 
was the kind of news that sells supermarket tabloids and draws viewers to TV 
newscasts. 
</P>
<P>
The suit is a potentially precedent-setting legal case because it raises the 
question of whether a woman, who is legally married to one man, can claim 
palimony rights from another. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not unusual for people to be separated from someone and living with 
someone else," said Locke's attorney, Norman Oberstein. "When people live 
together for 10 years, have a relationship for 13 years, share the same house 
and life, there are certain things that are implied from that." 
</P>
<P>
Although Eastwood and Locke declined to be interviewed for this story, they 
have outlined their positions in sworn declarations that have been filed in the 
palimony suit and ordered sealed by the court. The Times, however, has obtained 
copies of Locke's entire legal declaration and a portion of Eastwood's. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 13 years, the Eastwood-Locke union had been one of Hollywood's 
best-known relationships and, by show business standards, reasonably stable. In 
their time together, Eastwood's brand of wildly popular blood-splattered 
action-adventure films had come to be regarded as classics; he became an icon 
for a culture worshipful of his kind of rugged individualism and self-reliance. 
Harry Callahan's "Go ahead, make my day" expression of supreme toughness became 
so much a part of the language that even President Reagan evoked it as he 
girded for a showdown with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
As Eastwood's reputation grew -- the fan adulation, the critical acclaim, 
directing such major films as "Bird," his foray into politics as the mayor of 
the seaside village of Carmel -- Locke's career stayed in the shadow of his, 
but recently showed signs of emerging on its own. 
</P>
<P>
But the unusual partnership is over now. 
</P>
<P>
Barred from her home, still shooting her movie and living with friends, Locke 
is suing Eastwood for unspecified financial support, breach of contract, 
emotional distress, forcible entry, possession of personal property and other 
claims. She said she had to borrow clothes from friends because she hadn't had 
time to get her own out of storage, and still didn't know the whereabouts of 
her pet parrot Putty or her 1971 Mercedes Benz. 
</P>
<P>
She wants the court to award her the ownership of the Bel-Air estate and 
another house in the Hollywood Hills that she claims Eastwood gave her. She 
also has asked the court to bar Eastwood from the Bel-Air house "because I know 
him to have a terrible temper . . . and he has frequently been abusive to me." 
</P>
<P>
The Eastwood she describes in her declaration is a volatile and distant man who 
never got around to marrying her, although he frequently talked about it. Locke 
claims that Eastwood persuaded her to have two abortions and a sterilization 
operation known as a tubal ligation. 
</P>
<P>
In his legal papers, Eastwood claims Locke told him on several occasions that 
she never wanted to have children. "I adamantly deny and deeply resent the 
accusation that either one of those abortions or the tubal ligation were done 
at my demand, request or even suggestion," Eastwood stated. "As to the 
abortions, I told Locke that whether to have children or terminate her 
pregnancies was a decision entirely hers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Particularly with regard to the tubal ligation, I encouraged Locke to make her 
own decision after she had consulted with a physician about the appropriateness 
of and the necessity for that surgical procedure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Eastwood's only public comments on the palimony suit were issued April 27 
through his publicist: "I am deeply disappointed and saddened that she's 
(Locke's) taken this kind of action. It will soon come to light that these 
accusations are unfounded and without merit, however, this matter will be dealt 
with in an appropriate legal arena." 
</P>
<P>
That legal arena is the Superior courtroom of Judge Dana Senit Henry. Attorneys 
for Locke and Eastwood are scheduled to be in court May 31. 
</P>
<P>
Locke and Eastwood met in 1975 while making the post-Civil War-era film "The 
Outlaw Josey Wales." He played a peaceful farmer who turns vigilante when Union 
soldiers kill his family. She played a young girl who survived an attack 
against her family. 
</P>
<P>
Romance quickly developed between the two, whose screen personas seemed oddly 
matched -- he the tough he-man made famous as the Man With No Name in the late 
Sergio Leone's spaghetti Westerns and she the petite, ethereal-looking actress 
who had been nominated for an Oscar in her first acting role, the naive young 
Mick Kelly in the 1968 adaptation of Carson McCullers' "The Heart Is a Lonely 
Hunter." 
</P>
<P>
By 1976, Locke and Eastwood were living together in San Francisco while 
Eastwood was filming "The Enforcer." At the time, Eastwood was still married to 
Maggie Eastwood, the mother of his two children, Kyle, now 20, and Alison, now 
17. In 1977 Locke and Eastwood worked together again on "The Gauntlet." That 
year, after 25 years of marriage, Clint and Maggie Eastwood separated. The 
couple divorced a few years later. 
</P>
<P>
Eastwood and Locke began sharing the Sherman Oaks house that Eastwood had lived 
in with Maggie, but, as Locke tells it, sometime in 1980 she had begun to grow 
uncomfortable living among the family pictures and memorabilia of Eastwood's 
former life. "I spoke to Clint about my feelings, and he told me that I should 
find a house that I wanted and he would buy it for me," Locke said in her 
declaration. The moment she saw it, Locke fell in love with the 5,000 
square-foot tile-roofed Bel-Air house, although it was in need of renovation. 
</P>
<P>
"Clint said that I should buy it, remodel it and furnish it however I wanted," 
she said. Property records show that he paid $1,125,000 for the two-story 
stucco house. Locke spent about three years redecorating it. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout this time, the couple also shared living quarters on a Northern 
California ranch Eastwood bought in 1978, and at residences in Sun Valley, 
Idaho, and Carmel, according to legal documents. 
</P>
<P>
"From the start of our relationship Clint told me that he wanted us always to 
be together and that he would take care of me forever," Locke said in the 
declaration. "Clint repeatedly assured me that regardless of whether we were 
married, everything he had was ours together. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear from the documents how their relationship soured. 
</P>
<P>
"When Clint became mayor of Carmel several years ago he began spending more of 
his time in Carmel, and was frequently there for periods of time when I stayed 
in Los Angeles," she said. "During this same period I began to sense some 
increasing tension and estrangement in our relationship. I frequently tried to 
speak to Clint about these problems, but he never wanted to do so. He would 
often discourage me from accompanying him to Carmel, and over the past year or 
year-and-a-half he has stayed in Los Angeles only infrequently. The troubles 
between us came to a head just before New Year's in 1988." 
</P>
<P>
The pair headed to Sun Valley for the Christmas holidays, which they had been 
doing for the last several years. An argument prompted Eastwood to insist that 
Locke return to Los Angeles. Locke began work on "Impulse" in January, and 
between January and April, Eastwood returned to the Bel-Air house only for a 
few nights to attend two awards shows, Locke said. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the letter addressed to "Mrs. Gordon Anderson." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, a West Hollywood sculptor, and Locke were childhood friends in their 
native Shelbyville, Tenn., according to the legal documents. They married and 
moved to Los Angeles together in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
They have not lived together since 1975 and never consummated the marriage, 
according to legal documents. The lawsuit describes their relationship as 
"tantamount to sister and brother." 
</P>
<P>
Repeated attempts to reach Anderson were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
Eastwood knew about the marriage and accepted Anderson as Locke's surrogate 
brother "and treated him like an extended family member," Locke said in her 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, at Locke's request, according to the suit, Eastwood bought a house in 
the Hollywood Hills for Anderson to use, with the understanding that the house 
was a "gift" to Locke. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her promising film debut, Locke's career has long been tied to 
Eastwood's. They have worked on six films together. Her biggest role was as the 
artist-murderer in "Sudden Impact," one of Eastwood's "Dirty Harry" movies. She 
played the gun-toting, revenge-seeking Jennifer Spencer methodically wasting a 
pack of degenerate rapists who had earlier attacked her and a younger sister. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to "Josey Wales," Locke appeared as a country-music singer in 
Eastwood's "Every Which Way But Loose" and "Any Which Way You Can," a society 
snob in "Bronco Billy" and a tough-talking hooker in "The Gauntlet." 
</P>
<P>
"Because I have not worked in any capacity on any theatrical motion picture 
other than with Clint since before I met him in 1975 (with one minor 
exception), I had long felt that my professional career had been placed in 
Clint's shadow," Locke stated in her declaration. 
</P>
<P>
Locke's first effort at directing, in the Eastwood-produced 1986 film "Ratboy," 
met with little commercial or critical success in this country, although some 
European critics praised the film. 
</P>
<P>
"Impulse," her current film, is a psychological thriller about a burned-out 
female undercover cop -- played by Theresa Russell -- who works as a hooker 
decoy and becomes confused about which side of the law she wants to be on. It 
is being produced by the couple's friend, Al Ruddy, and distributed by 
Eastwood's longtime studio, Warner Bros. Locke is scheduled to finish shooting 
the film on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Eastwood is in pre-production for his upcoming motion picture "White 
Hunter, Black Heart," which chronicles the making of "The African Queen" and 
will be shot on location in Africa. His latest film, "Pink Cadillac," is 
scheduled to open May 26. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Locke's first attempt to come out from under Eastwood's shadow is 
being obscured by the breakup and legal wrangling. 
</P>
<P>
Said Locke in a 1987 interview: "People have this fantasy that it's all just an 
easy ride if you know someone important. Well, it's not. I've known lots of 
people in this business -- and it hasn't really done anything for me. . . . In 
a way, my association (with Eastwood) may even work against me."

BEIJING STUDENTS PLAN TO REFRAIN WHILE SOVIET LEADER VISITS CHINA

Students who twice paralyzed Beijing with mass demonstrations said Sunday they 
are likely to refrain from protests during the visit to China next week by 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a man they champion as a Communist 
reformer. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's historic visit will mark a significant reduction in 30 years of 
tension between the two Communist countries, and students said that trouble 
during the visit would be a terrible loss of face for China. 
</P>
<P>
"The visit is too important for our country," said a student at Teachers 
University. "We are a patriotic, democratic movement, so we would not do 
anything against our country." 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, despite stern official warnings, tens of thousands of 
pro-democracy protesters paralyzed the capital during a meeting of the Asian 
Development Bank, and some activists suggested the same could happen when the 
Soviet leader arrives May 15. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Do Not March Just for Fun' 
</P>
<P>
"We reserve the right to protest during Gorbachev's visit, but our goal is not 
to demonstrate, and we do not march just for fun," said a student leader from 
the central city of Xian who came to Beijing to meet with fellow activists. 
</P>
<P>
"If the government is sensible, it will agree to have talks with us, as our 
conditions are reasonable," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Many students involved in three weeks of unrest said the Soviet leader 
represents a younger, reformist and more open style of government, in direct 
contrast with that of China's 84-year-old paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping. 
</P>
<P>
"What China needs is someone like Gorbachev. His thinking is clear and good," a 
student union organizer told reporters last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Gorbachev is a great, amazing political star and a considerable 
theoretician," said a student at the University of Politics and Law. "I welcome 
him to come and visit my university, as we really pay a lot of attention to his 
reforms." 
</P>
<P>
The editor of a youth magazine said someone like Gorbachev is needed to battle 
China's entrenched bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
"Chinese intellectuals admire Gorbachev and wish we had such a person. It takes 
someone with a lot of spirit to carry reforms through," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But activists said their demands for an end to official corruption, democratic 
reforms in the government and an open and free press are not an imitation of 
reforms in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"Our ideas come from the Chinese people, and it is the ordinary people who are 
standing behind us, that is all," said Ni Xu, a former student-union committee 
member. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Splits in Movement 
</P>
<P>
Organizing another major demonstration on the scale of Thursday's would be 
difficult because of splits within the movement, students said. 
</P>
<P>
While many of the students at about 50 universities in the capital who took 
part in a two-week classroom strike said they will return to class today, 
students at Beijing University voted Saturday night to continue their protest. 
</P>
<P>
A new student organization made up of representatives, primarily graduate 
students, from 24 universities has given the government a conciliatory petition 
asking for dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
"We want dialogue. We are not considering other methods or other activities," 
leader Xiang Xiaoji told reporters when asked if his group favors 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
"The government is not our adversary," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A prominent intellectual warned against official complacency if the student 
unrest dies down. 
</P>
<P>
"If students return to class, but the deep problems in Chinese reform are not 
settled . . . the problems the students have pointed out this year will come 
back again," Yan Jiaqi, director of the political science institute of the 
Academy of Social Science, said in an article in China Youth News.

A Greek banking tycoon who has touched off the worst political scandal in his 
country's modern history is expected to argue in court papers today that he 
should not be extradited to Athens because the government there wants him 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
George Koskotas, a former chairman of the Bank of Crete who fled Greece last 
November, said in a petition prepared by his lawyers that he has "strong reason 
to believe that he would be killed" if U.S. authorities return him to Athens.

Greek authorities have accused Koskotas, 35, of embezzling more than $200 
million from his own bank. The banker has admitted skimming funds, but he said 
he did so on the orders of Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, putting the money 
into accounts controlled by officials of Papandreou's ruling PASOK socialist 
party. 
</P>
<P>
Koskotas' charges, buttressed by bank records and a tape recording of a 
conversation in which Papandreou promised to protect him from prosecution, have 
touched off a major political uproar in Greece. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Plot Charged 
</P>
<P>
Papandreou, who faces a national election June 19, has charged that the affair 
is part of a U.S.-sponsored plot to bring him down. His government, the most 
leftist in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, has frequently disagreed 
with U.S. policy on terrorism and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
Koskotas, who was arrested by the FBI at Greece's request last year, is being 
held in a county jail in Salem, Mass. His lawyers were scheduled to file his 
formal response to Greece's extradition request in U.S. District Court in 
Boston today. A hearing on the extradition is expected next month -- about the 
time of the election in Athens. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Koskotas faces a clear and present danger to his physical safety if he is 
returned to Greek hands," his lawyers' statement charges. "Violent terrorist 
groups openly have stated their intention to assassinate Mr. Koskotas. The 
Greek police and security forces through the years have shown themselves to be 
singularly incapable of preventing such attacks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It can hardly be doubted that Mr. Koskotas -- whose death or disappearance no 
doubt would avoid great embarrassment and further political damage to the 
ruling party -- cannot expect adequate protection. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Koskotas' petition also asks the U.S. court to prevent his extradition on the 
grounds that the charges against him are political in nature. Under the 
U.S.-Greek extradition treaty, the two countries are not bound to turn over 
defendants accused of crimes "of a political character." 
</P>
<P>
Greece's most violent leftist terrorist group, the November 17 Revolutionary 
Organization, has denounced Koskotas as a "plunderer" and has accused the 
government of trying to cover up its complicity in his deeds.

RIVALRIES OVER WILDLIFE POACHING GRIP KENYA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
This is what happened after Richard E. Leakey, world-renowned paleontologist, 
author and conservationist, head of the Kenya National Museums for 20 years, 
decided to speak out on the issue of wildlife poaching in the country's 
national parks: 
</P>
<P>
Leakey's reputation as a scientist and museum administrator was harshly 
attacked in the local press. The government reorganized the museum board behind 
his back, prompting him to submit his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Despite being a native Kenyan and a citizen, whose younger brother serves in 
the Kenyan Parliament and as deputy tourism minister, Leakey was derided by one 
government minister as a "cheeky white" who felt that black Africans could not 
manage their own affairs. 
</P>
<P>
But in the fullness of time, Leakey's reputation and career have recovered. 
Soon after his resignation, a public uproar forced the government to restore 
the old museum board, and he withdrew his resignation. More recently, Leakey 
became head of the Department of Wildlife Conservation and Management, 
succeeding one of his critics. 
</P>
<P>
For all of that, his experiences underscore one thing: wildlife conservation in 
Kenya is sensitive business. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conservation Rivalries 
</P>
<P>
Few events have laid open the rivalries between conservationists and 
bureaucrats -- and among the conservationists themselves -- as a scandal here 
over poaching and Leakey's outspokenness on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
How Kenya undertakes to protect its valued wildlife has long been a tender 
issue, because there is little any developing country can do to combat a gang 
of determined poachers. Many people here feel that the only solution is to 
"privatize" wildlife preserves, by establishing quasi-private companies to run 
existing preserves or otherwise placing them in private hands that can afford 
to safeguard their perimeters. 
</P>
<P>
But Kenyan officials are particularly sensitive to criticism, partly because 
they fear the impact that negative publicity might have on the country's 
significant tourist trade. "After all, most of us want to remain in the 
country," remarked one leading local zoologist, who was reluctant to discuss 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
With a multiplicity of international and local wildlife clubs and funds and 
societies representing a variety of interests and philosophies, Kenyan 
conservationists, like keepers of the flame anywhere, often spend as much time 
sorting out their own differences as they do fighting a common foe. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yes," says Imre Loefler, a local surgeon and prominent conservationist, 
"there are enormous disagreements in the conservation community. This community 
has various traits and prejudices. At one extreme is the most bigoted right 
wing -- strictly anti-humans -- and at the other are those only interested in a 
few species. They're generally employed in the tourist industry." 
</P>
<P>
In few other places, moreover, are the conflicts between the needs of wildlife 
protection and those of the human population so sharply etched as in Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
Wildlife is Kenya's greatest tourist draw, and tourism its third-largest 
foreign exchange earner: The 700,000 visitors expected this year will leave 
behind well over $350 million in foreign currency. With coffee and tea prices 
locked in a long slump, tourism may be Kenya's only growth industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Competing With Humans 
</P>
<P>
Yet Kenya's elephants, rhinos, lions and antelope occupy land that comes at an 
increasing premium and for which they must compete ever more aggressively with 
the country's human population, which is growing faster than that of any other 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
In Narok, a farm district next to Masai Mara National Park, one of Kenya's most 
popular game reserves, a herd of elephants not long ago invaded a plantation of 
bananas and vegetables; in their haste to reach the food, they trampled a woman 
to death. In Tana River district, which includes part of Tsavo East Game 
Reserve, 88 people have been killed by animals since 1980, according to the 
Department of Tourism and Wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
"With growing population pressures, one has to show the politicians that 
setting aside preserves is economically productive, whether that involves 
tourism, hunting or exploitation" such as harvesting ivory, Loefler says. "You 
can't tell people anymore that we're just going to do this for sentimental 
reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the underlying tension is a racial element: The wildlife conservation 
community here largely comprises white expatriate Europeans and Americans, some 
of whom may not be fully sensitive to the competing interests of a poor and 
developing land. 
</P>
<P>
What set all this tinder aflame was an apparent surge of poaching late last 
year in Kenya's national parks. Tourists began returning from safaris in the 
parks, not with tales of bongo on the hoof and lions at repose yawning in the 
grass and trees, but of mountains of elephant carcasses, with trunks and tusks 
ghoulishly lopped off. 
</P>
<P>
Reports reached Nairobi of poaching gangs armed with automatic weapons engaging 
park rangers in lengthy shoot-outs. In November, Perez Olindo, Leakey's 
predecessor as director of Wildlife and Conservation Management, detailed the 
six-month war's casualties: six game rangers killed, nine wounded. 
</P>
<P>
In the longer term, Olindo said, poaching had reduced Kenya's elephant 
population in 13 years from 140,000 to 22,000. Other unofficial estimates 
placed the elephant population as low as 16,000. 
</P>
<P>
It was into this ferment that Leakey jumped with both feet last fall. Just 
after Tourism and Wildlife Minister George Muhoho called a news conference to 
pledge a redoubled government anti-poaching effort, Leakey called his own 
conference as chairman of the East African Wildlife Society. 
</P>
<P>
Calling poaching "a growing national crisis" and "economic sabotage," he 
labeled the government's approach toward wildlife protection "lip service" and 
charged that high officials of the wildlife department itself were 
participating in poaching. The remarks by Leakey, one of the few Kenyans of his 
stature to speak out, brought the poaching issue to the forefront of national 
and international attention. 
</P>
<P>
The elder son of the late Louis Leakey, whose work at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania 
was critical in the study of early man, Leakey has made many important 
discoveries himself. His directorship of the national museums is widely 
regarded as having given those institutions a preeminent position in study of 
prehistory. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family's Prominent Role 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there could be few white families who have played as prominent a role 
as natives and citizens in Kenya's post-independence period as have the 
Leakeys. 
</P>
<P>
Muhoho at first replied with what Kenya's leading newspaper, the Daily Nation, 
later disapprovingly termed a "contentious response": He called Leakey a 
"cheeky white." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, it was not only Kenyan officials who felt Leakey had shot from the hip. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question whatsoever that he was doing a bit of grandstanding," said 
David Western, chairman of the governing council of the Wildlife Clubs of 
Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, the wildlife rangers temporarily recovered some of their morale. 
The government staffed the parks with a detachment of its paramilitary General 
Services Unit, 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mounds of Carcasses 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, in succeeding months, it has become clear that the tide of 
poaching in the national parks, particularly of elephants, has not appreciably 
been stemmed. Mounds of carcasses still appear, and public concern over the 
situation has not abated. 
</P>
<P>
Leakey's outburst may finally have borne its most important fruit last month 
when he got a chance to take full charge of correcting the ills he has 
complained about. The government appointed him to replace Olindo as the man 
directly responsible for protecting Kenya's wildlife.

Washington's outgoing envoy to Italy was quoted Sunday as saying Libyan gunmen 
came to Rome to kill him in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell M. Rabb, who is ending eight years as U.S. ambassador, told the 
magazine Epoca in an interview to be published today that he was awakened in 
his hotel during a trip to Milan on Oct. 13, 1981, and told to fly home to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I was to have been assassinated the next day," Rabb said in the interview. 
"Five Libyans had been captured by police in a Rome hotel, and one of them was 
to have been my killer. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't go into details for security reasons, but they had practically put a 
price on my head and another on the head of the U.S. consul in Palermo," Rabb 
was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
The Libyan Embassy was not available for comment, but Libya, accused by 
Washington of supporting world terrorism, dismissed a similar accusation in 
1986 as U.S. propaganda.

A top Palestinian official said Sunday that a West German relief worker 
reported kidnaped in the southern Lebanese port of Sidon will probably be freed 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
Zeid Wehbeh, the Palestine Liberation Organization representative in Lebanon, 
told Visnews television news agency that the man, whom he named as Marcus 
Quint, "will maybe be in our hands in a few hours." 
</P>
<P>
He said Palestinian groups were doing their best to find the 24-year-old Quint, 
reported kidnaped Thursday with two other West German workers for the 
ASME-Humanitas relief agency. 
</P>
<P>
The other two, who said they were released Friday, told security authorities 
that the kidnapers threatened to kill their colleague unless an Arab held in a 
Cypriot jail is released.

CREW PHOTOGRAPHS LIGHTNING STORMS;

<P>
ATLANTIS ASTRONAUTS REPLACE FAULTY COMPUTER 
</P>

<P>
On their final full day in orbit, the five Atlantis astronauts encountered 
their first problem when one of the orbiter's four general-purpose computers 
"froze" and had to be replaced with a spare. Earlier Sunday, however, they 
finally got a chance to photograph some lightning before preparing for their 
landing at 12:43 p.m. today at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
The computer that failed did not control any flight-critical processes but 
directed the attitude of antennas and played a role in the on-board science 
experiments. Within 30 minutes after the failure was discovered, those 
functions were shifted over to the other three computers, and mission 
specialist Mark C. Lee began replacing it. 
</P>
<P>
The process, which involved removing a row of lockers on the shuttle mid-deck 
to gain access to the computers, took about 3 1/2 hours. Another 1 1/2 hours 
were required to check the computer out after it was installed. An on-board 
computer has never been replaced in previous shuttle missions, but the 
astronauts have practiced it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Poses No Threat 
</P>
<P>
The failure of the computer posed no threat to the astronauts, or to the 
shuttle. Commander David M. Walker and pilot Ronald J. Grabe can land using 
only one computer. But it was replaced because NASA officials prefer to have 
all four computers functioning during re-entry. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the slow pace of their orbital experiments before the computer failure, 
Walker said in a morning news conference that the crew had "really not relaxed. 
We've worked very hard." Lee noted, however, that the workload was "not 
overwhelming for a five-man crew." 
</P>
<P>
The Magellan spacecraft, launched from Atlantis Thursday night, continued on 
its near-perfect voyage to Venus Sunday, while mission specialist Mary L. 
Cleave photographed some of the places visited by the 16th-Century Portuguese 
navigator Ferdinand Magellan during his trip around the world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Got Some Good Pictures' 
</P>
<P>
To laughter from the rest of the crew, Cleave said, "We got some good pictures 
of the Philippines," where Magellan died before the voyage was completed. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the success of the mission, Walker replied that "I'd give it a 
10 on my personal scale. . . . You couldn't ask for a better flying machine 
than this one." 
</P>
<P>
Cleave, who has been studying the growth of crystals for the electronics 
industry in the near-weightlessness of microgravity, also noted that, "We're 
hoping to bring back some great indium crystals." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Check On-Board Systems 
</P>
<P>
Walker and Grabe spent part of the day making certain that all on-board systems 
needed for today's landing were in good working order. 
</P>
<P>
But the highlight of the day came when the astronauts finally got the chance to 
photograph some lightning storms with the payload bay camera, as well as with a 
Sony camcorder that the crew has been testing. Atlantis had not passed over any 
large storms on the preceding two days. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sympathetic' Lightning 
</P>
<P>
Sunday some expected storms over Australia did not materialize, but crew 
members observed lightning over Africa. Mission specialist Norman E. Thagard 
noted that he had observed some "sympathetic" lightning that began in the top 
of one cloud and triggered flashes in a succession of nearby clouds. 
</P>
<P>
The astronauts are collecting data that will eventually be used in the design 
of lightning detection satellites that will be used to increase the accuracy of 
storm forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers want to learn about lightning "to be able to give data out for . . 
. hazard identification, storm tracking," said meteorologist Mark Christian of 
the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
"We could tell where a storm is in its evolution, if it's intensifying, whether 
it's starting to die, what direction it's tracking to," Christian said. "It 
certainly should have impact in improved weather forecasts." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Aid Industry 
</P>
<P>
Lightning forecasts would be very useful to the airline industry and groups 
working outdoors, including construction crews, oil derrick workers and 
operators of large cranes. 
</P>
<P>
With the Atlantis flight winding down, NASA officials are beginning to look 
ahead to future missions. The next shuttle mission will be the first 
post-Challenger flight of Columbia, tentatively scheduled for the beginning of 
August. It will carry a classified Department of Defense payload. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 24, Voyager 2, launched in 1977, will fly by Neptune, sending back the 
first pictures of that planet. In the early parts of its 12-year trip, Voyager 
2 has already returned pictures of Venus, Jupiter and Saturn. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 12, Atlantis will return to space carrying the Galileo probe, which 
will reach Jupiter in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
In November, Columbia will carry a communications satellite into orbit, while 
the piece de resistance comes in November, when Discovery will launch the 
Hubble Space Telescope, an event originally scheduled for early 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"This is intended to be the year of the planets," said Lennard Fisk, NASA's 
associate administrator for space sciences.

A strong earthquake Sunday struck a region of southwest China where 730 people 
were killed by a temblor in November, but this time officials said only about 
10 people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's quake collapsed some houses and opened rifts in some streets in Gengma 
county in Yunnan province, the official New China News Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
It said there were no reports of deaths or injuries, but the Central Seismology 
Bureau in Beijing quoted local authorities as saying that about 10 people were 
injured, four seriously. 
</P>
<P>
The quake had a magnitude of 6.3, one capable of causing severe damage. The 
Nov. 6 quake that shook Gengma and devastated nearby counties was much 
stronger, measuring 7.6.

Johannes Winkel, a state spokesman in Duesseldorf, said West German authorities 
issued an international pollution alert and notified Dutch authorities that the 
spill was approaching their territory. 
</P>
<P>
He said the spill apparently was caused by an unidentified ship discharging its 
diesel fuel waste on Saturday night. Winkel did not know how much oil had 
spilled, but he said the thin slick posed no danger to the environment.

Has it come to this? Has it come to the point where the L.A. fans and media, 
and maybe even the Laker players, have such high expectations for this ballclub 
that they aren't satisfied with an 11-point series-opening victory over a tough 
second-round opponent, the Lakers' ninth consecutive win? 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, has it come to the point that such a game is cause for grave concern? 
</P>
<P>
Yes. 
</P>
<P>
As the Bard said, uneasy lies the head that wears the National Basketball Assn. 
crown. Or was it the X-man who said that? 
</P>
<P>
Xavier (X-man) McDaniel and his fellow Seattle SuperSonics made a strong run, 
put some physical hurt on the Lakers, but fell Sunday, 113-102, at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Did this game reveal the Lakers as a beatable team? 
</P>
<P>
"This game definitely got our attention where it should be," Laker center 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar said. "We have to be emotionally involved in this series." 
</P>
<P>
Absolutely. This is not a one-night (or one-day) stand. The Lakers will have to 
respect the SuperSonics in the morning, especially after the Lakers check out 
their lumps and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
There were encouraging Laker performances Sunday, like James Worthy's 28 points 
and 12 rebounds, but let's not dwell on the positive here. What about: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The bench? Key subs Michael Cooper and Orlando Woolridge combined for four 
points and zero rebounds. Paging Bob McAdoo. Cooper did make a sensational 
block on Sedale Threatt layup to key the Lakers' late surge, but I said we 
weren't going to dwell on the positive, remember? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kareem? Would you believe zero rebounds in 28 minutes? This has to be a 
world record for a center. Looks like certain parts of Big Fella's retirement 
are further along than other parts. 
</P>
<P>
Kareem also shot zero free throws. Never a mix-it-up type, Abdul-Jabbar played 
this one far, far from the madding crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Magic Johnson? One rebound in 42 minutes. Not enough. Fortunately for the 
Lakers, Magic wasn't reluctant to take the ball to the hoop, where the 
SuperSonics get nasty. Without his 14 free throws (and Worthy's 10), the Lakers 
would have been in deep trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Sonics? Too many uncontested, unmolested inside shots for Seattle's 
interior thugs -- er, players. 
</P>
<P>
"They were being the aggressive ones," Cooper said. "They let us know there 
would not be any layups. The first three or four, they hit us in the face, 
knocked us to the floor." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper emphasized that these tactics were not dirty. Heck no. And he emphasized 
that the Lakers would have to adopt a similar demeanor, without crossing over 
that fine line that separates gentlemen from common ruffians. 
</P>
<P>
"We will make a better effort at contesting their shots," Cooper said, 
euphemistically. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers will have to adjust to a slightly different style of play. In the 
Forum Sunday, the only thing uglier than the Seattle defense was the sight of 
porcine fight promoter Don King wearing a tight T-shirt and leather shorts. 
Lord have mercy. 
</P>
<P>
(King was making a fashion statement. That statement was: "Stop me before I 
dress myself again.") 
</P>
<P>
The SuperSonics may have added a new phrase to the NBA lexicon, although they 
certainly didn't invent rugged play. The phrase: Power fouls. 
</P>
<P>
"Power fouls are one thing," Magic Johnson said, referring to the Sonics' 
philosophy of contesting layups. "You can deal with them. Their goal is to try 
to make you get upset." 
</P>
<P>
The enduring and endearing picture of the SuperSonics is the photo from two 
seasons back of X-man McDaniel with both hands wrapped snugly around the neck 
of then-Laker Wes Matthews. In one evening, Matthews went from a size 15 1/2 
shirt collar to a permanent 14. 
</P>
<P>
X-man is so intimidating that hair is afraid to grow on his head. 
</P>
<P>
The Sonics' make-'em-pay defense cost them in free throws -- the Lakers shot 
46, Seattle 25 -- but they left their calling card, establishing their style. 
</P>
<P>
This is a team that has perfected the follow-through foul, where the defender 
makes contact with as many of the shooter's body parts as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Byron Scott did a quick tooth check after he was axed on one layup, and on 
other occasions he also was hit on the head and in an eye. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thinking about wearing goggles next game," Scott joked. 
</P>
<P>
Might as well, because the action from here on out, in this series and any 
subsequent series that the Lakers might find themselves involved in, will be 
lively. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotta flip the switch," said Coach Pat Riley, "from a running and 
finesse team to one that's going to be playing in the trenches." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the Lakers have to sink to new heights, or rise to new depths. 
It's an annual event: Finesse-prone Lakers sense need to drop facade of 
gentility, mix it up with brutish foe. 
</P>
<P>
It's an old story, but maybe the Lakers are an old team. Beatable, maybe. What 
will the Sonics do once they have a chance to rest and regroup? 
</P>
<P>

act of charity. Mark Heisler's story, Page 13.

LAKER WIN IN GAME 1 HURTS SO GOOD, 113-102; 
</P>
<P>
WORTHY HAS 28 IN GAME 1 VICTORY OVER SUPERSONICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It is not as if the Lakers are into pain. They do not particularly enjoy 
trading bumps and bruises with the Seattle SuperSonics, but they felt compelled 
to do it to win. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday afternoon, in Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals, the Lakers 
absorbed and administered their share of punishment before overcoming the 
SuperSonics, 113-102, in a physically demanding game not seen in the Forum 
since they took away the ice surface. 
</P>
<P>
But the Lakers, willing to adapt their style, expected such Sonic blasts. 
Rather than retreat, the Lakers showed a physical side that usually remains 
dormant until the Detroit Pistons come to town. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to beat them at their own game," Laker forward James Worthy, who had 
28 points and 12 rebounds, said of the SuperSonics. "That means you have to 
push and shove and dive for loose balls and go for every rebound. Mentally and 
physically, you have to have that effort. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not known for it. But when we have to adjust, we can." 
</P>
<P>
After cruising through a first-round playoff sweep of Portland in which they 
were hardly touched, the Lakers needed more than a half to adjust before taking 
control with an impressive show of force and defense. 
</P>
<P>
That was not exactly an unexpected development to Laker Coach Pat Riley, who 
talked so much about the physical aspect of the series that he might as well 
have used a blocking sled in practice. 
</P>
<P>
"They are one of the most aggressive teams in the league," Riley said. "They 
fight and compete for everything. Each team has got a personality. Theirs is 
being aggressive. They try to control you with aggressive play, and you've got 
to make the adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of frustrating that develops when you play tough, physical 
teams. You can't let their tactics get to you." 
</P>
<P>
As late as two minutes into the fourth quarter, the Lakers still trailed the 
SuperSonics and seemed to be wilting in the face of those strong-armed tactics. 
</P>
<P>
But then came a 24-9 Laker run over a 9:10 span that gave them a 110-96 lead 
and enabled the gathering of 17,505 to head for the parking lot before the 
final buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
During that Laker run, made possible by Seattle's six turnovers and two missed 
shots and a blocked layup by Michael Cooper, the SuperSonics were held without 
a basket for nearly seven minutes. By the time Xavier McDaniel scored inside, 
only 55 seconds remained and the Lakers had a lead in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
While the Lakers credited their trapping defense and aggressiveness for their 
fourth-quarter surge, the SuperSonics said it was a self-inflicted loss. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't lose this game because of missed shots," McDaniel said. "We lost 
because of turnovers. We need to attack their press better." 
</P>
<P>
For much of the second quarter and even into the second half, the SuperSonics 
were successfully attacking the Lakers. Seattle led at halftime, 54-52, and 
after three quarters, 81-80, at which point they also had a distinct rebounding 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, though, the Lakers became the aggressors. Although the SuperSonics 
shot better than the Lakers (52.6% to 46.9%), the Lakers took advantage of the 
byproduct of Seattle's physical play by dominating at the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers made 37 of 46 free throws. Seattle made 18 of 25. Known for their 
tendency to foul, the SuperSonics did not quibble much about the disparity. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll just have to try and play through that," McDaniel said of the 31 
personal fouls called on his team. 
</P>
<P>
But that, basically, is how the Lakers hope to handle Seattle's unceasing 
pressure. They want to attack rather than retreat, trying to draw fouls. 
</P>
<P>
Those objectives were achieved, but not without difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy made nine-of-20 shots and made 10-of-11 free throws for a game-high 28 
points. He also had 12 rebounds, five on the offense. Magic Johnson scored 11 
of his 21 points at the free-throw line and also had 14 of the Lakers' 28 
assists. And A.C. Green added 10 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Laker defense, meanwhile, contained McDaniel and Dale Ellis, the 
SuperSonics' main scorers. Ellis, who averaged 28 points against the Lakers 
this season, was limited to 19 points. McDaniel, who had averaged 30 points in 
the final 10 regular-season games, attempted only 11 shots and finished with 15 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Although he is a forward, Worthy began the game guarding Ellis, and Green, a 
power forward, guarded small forward McDaniel. In the second half, though, 
Laker guard Byron Scott switched to Ellis and held him to seven points. 
</P>
<P>
"We did a good job on (Ellis)," Scott said. "Any time you can hold him to that 
(19 points), it's a good job. My objective is to just not let him get an open 
shot. Contest everything." 
</P>
<P>
Added Worthy: "You have to max out on Ellis. It's not an individual thing. It's 
a team defensive effort. He is awesome, explosive at times." 
</P>
<P>
But the first indication that the SuperSonics might be fading came midway 
through the third quarter after Ellis made a three-point shot for a 67-65 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle's next six possessions resulted in five turnovers. The Lakers didn't 
take full advantage, however. They scored six points, taking a four-point lead 
that they lost by the end of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But when the SuperSonics lapsed into a series of turnovers and ill-advised 
shots again in the fourth quarter, the Lakers pounced. 
</P>
<P>
The decisive rally began when Johnson made a long jump shot to avoid a 
24-second clock violation. It continued through four free throws and hit stride 
when Worthy took a pass from Johnson and drove through the congested lane for a 
layup that made it, 94-89, Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, however, Seattle still was within striking distance. Guard 
Sedale Threatt tried to end the scoring drought by driving through the lane for 
what appeared to be an easy layup. But Cooper swooped in and blocked Threatt's 
attempt. Johnson retrieved the ball and scored on a fast-break layup. 
</P>
<P>
That gave the Lakers a seven-point lead. Boosted by two successful skyhooks 
from Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (16 points) and a basket off an offensive rebound by 
Mychal Thompson (16 points), the Lakers then put it away. 
</P>
<P>
Game 1, that is. Not the best-of-seven series. 
</P>
<P>
The SuperSonics, coming off a first-round playoff victory over the Houston 
Rockets, entered the game with fewer than one day of preparation and little 
rest. The Lakers, on the other hand, had three days of practice before Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding their problem, the SuperSonics said they were awakened by fire 
alarms at their hotel at 3 a.m. and again at 4 a.m. Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
It was not exactly Coach Bernie Bickerstaff's idea of proper pregame 
preparation. So, under the circumstances, Bickerstaff said he was pleased by 
his team's play. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it could be a good, interesting series," said Bickerstaff, smiling. 
"We proved we can be competitive. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what to expect, but I was not surprised by the way we played 
today." 
</P>
<P>
Neither were the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
As planned, the SuperSonics flew back to Seattle Sunday night. They will 
practice Monday and Tuesday in Seattle and return to Los Angeles Tuesday night. 
. . . The Lakers have won their last nine playoff games against the 
SuperSonics, dating back to the first game of the 1980 Western Conference 
finals. . . . With 16 points Sunday, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has scored in double 
figures in all four Laker playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Coach Pat Riley said his only gripe about his team Sunday was a 
second-quarter lapse during which the SuperSonics made a 14-8 run for a 54-52 
halftime lead. "In the second quarter, our defense really broke down, and our 
offense flattened out," Riley said. "But being down two points at halftime may 
have been a blessing in disguise. We felt a little pressure." . . . Agent Larry 
Fleisher, 58, died Thursday in New York. Fleisher represented Laker players 
A.C. Green and Orlando Woolridge. Green, who will be a restricted free agent 
after this season, had been negotiating with Laker management on a contract 
extension. That apparently is put on hold until Green hires another agent.

L.A. COMMUNITY COMES TO AID OF GUATEMALA'S WORLD CUP SOCCER EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Guatemala is not a wealthy country. When its national soccer team said it was 
short of money recently in its quest to reach the 1990 World Cup finals, the 
players and managers asked their compatriots in "El Norte" for help. 
</P>
<P>
The Guatemalan community of Los Angeles did not let them down. In the past four 
months, workers and businessmen have contributed $5, $10 and $100 apiece -- 
raising about $7,000 solely to supplement player salaries. The funds were given 
to team members in a Huntington Park ceremony Saturday night in showing that 
despite the distance, Guatemalan immigrants have not lost their obsession with 
their homeland's national sport. 
</P>
<P>
"Before anything else, I'm Guatemalan," said Hugo Merida, who played host to 
the ceremony at his restaurant. "And secondly, I love soccer. I had to give to 
the team." 
</P>
<P>
When most country's national teams play, it is more than a single result of a 
game. The country's honor is at stake. When the Guatemalan team played Chile's 
national team in an exhibition tournament match at the Coliseum Friday night, 
the nationalistic fervor erupted into a small riot. 
</P>
<P>
"Guatemaaala!, Guatemaaala!," thousands of fans shouted as the Guatemalan team 
entered the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't get to watch our soccer that much anymore, so it's special," said 
Raymundo Rodriguez, 40, who came to the game with his wife and two sons. "We 
are so far away . . . this means a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Guatemala has never qualified for the World Cup finals. Hopes were high for 
this year's team until reports about the team's financial crisis began 
filtering in from Guatemala in January. The country's sports federation was 
unable to pay salaries and was afraid some of its star players would leave for 
club competition. 
</P>
<P>
The Guatemalan consulate in Los Angeles organized a fund-raising campaign and 
broadcast pleas for help on local Spanish-language radio stations. The team's 
plight struck a chord. Many of those watching Friday said they had made 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Velazquez, a 27-year-old dishwasher, said he gave $5. Small business 
operator Roberto Matamoros gave $20. Ruben Ponciano, a building maintenance 
clerk, said he contributed $10. 
</P>
<P>
"Back in our country we start playing soccer since childhood. Every 
neighborhood, both rich and poor, has its team," Ponciano said as he stood with 
other fans waving the blue-and-white Guatemalan flag. "But this is everybody's 
team. Let's hope it comes through." 
</P>
<P>
When Chile took a 1-0 lead, some Guatemalan fans began taking out their 
frustrations on a group of Chileans clustered around a handful of their own 
national flags. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, a group of more 100 Guatemalan men charged the Chileans, who were 
outnumbered about 10 to one. The Chileans ran until a dozen baton-waving Los 
Angeles policemen broke up the charge and restored order. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just soccer," one police officer sighed after the melee. "It happens all 
the time. This is tame compared to when El Salvador plays Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
The Chileans held their lead and won, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
But at least one Guatemalan fan felt the loss was honorable. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost against a great rival," said Nelson Hernandez, a student at Cal State 
Los Angeles. Hernandez proudly pointed to a gash in his cheekbone, suffered in 
a scrap with a Chilean fan. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said he would not be too disappointed if Guatemala fails to qualify 
for the World Cup finals in Italy next year. Guatemala is competing in a 
qualifying tournament for one of two berths against the United States, Costa 
Rica, El Salvador and Trinidad and Tobago. 
</P>
<P>
But if they do qualify? 
</P>
<P>
"Ooooh!" he exclaimed, rolling his eyes and shaking his head in excitement. 
"The greatest, simply the greatest."

U.S. SHOWN WAYS TO BEAT GUATEMALA, EL SALVADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although Sunday was supposed to be his day of rest, Bob Gansler, coach of the 
United States soccer team, was hard at work. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Hugo Perez, a U.S. midfielder, Gansler scouted an exhibition 
soccer tournament at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Gansler diagrammed plays as Paraguay defeated Guatemala, 2-1, and Chile beat El 
Salvador, 1-0, before a crowd of 10,997. 
</P>
<P>
Gansler was interested because Guatemala and El Salvador are in the same World 
Cup qualifying group as the United States. The two other countries in the group 
are Costa Rica and Trinidad &amp; Tobago. 
</P>
<P>
The United States plays Trinidad &amp; Tobago in a World Cup qualifying match 
Saturday at El Camino College. The Trinidad &amp; Tobago team watched the games 
from the stands. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to give you my scouting report because they (Guatemala and El 
Salvador) won't either," Gansler said when asked about weaknesses he spotted 
for Guatemala and El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm more concerned about Trinidad &amp; Tobago because we play them next. I'll 
put Guatemala and El Salvador on the drawing board." 
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, the United States can do as good a job on Guatemala, when they meet 
on June 17, as Paraguay did Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Paraguay used a 4-3-3 formation, often deploying five attackers in defeating 
Guatemala, which seemed disorganized because it had five new players in its 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Guatemala took a 1-0 lead in the eighth minute when forward Manuel Funes a 
scored on a rebound of a shot by teammate Juan Davila. Funes' shot hit the 
crossbar and bounced into the net. 
</P>
<P>
But Guatemala seemed to relax afterward, allowing two goals. 
</P>
<P>
Paraguay tied it, 1-1, on a goal by forward Javier Ferreira in the 37th minute. 
Guatemala goalie Ricardo Piccinini blocked a shot by forward Eugenio Palacios, 
but the Ferreira put in the rebound. 
</P>
<P>
With one minute remaining in the first half, forward Felix Britez beat 
Piccinini for the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Jose Riveros of Paraguay and defender Alejandro Ortiz were ejected 
from the game in the 87th minute after a double foul. Both benches emptied, but 
order was quickly restored. 
</P>
<P>
The United States plays at El Salvador on July 19, and Gansler was impressed by 
the quickness of the Salvadorans. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm impressed by their quickness with and without the ball," Gansler said. 
"They seem to have a varied attack." 
</P>
<P>
Gansler was impressed by forward Salvador Coreas and midfielder Mauricio 
Cienfuegos. 
</P>
<P>
Chile used an elastic 4-4-2 formation to thwart El Salvador, which played a 
conventional 4-4-2, marking man-to-man. 
</P>
<P>
Although midfielder Raul Ormeno was credited with Chile's goal, it was actually 
scored by El Salvador goalie Ricardo Mora. 
</P>
<P>
After making a save on Ormeno's 45-yard shot, Mora accidently tossed the ball 
over his head and into the net, botching a two-handed clearing pass. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously embarrassed, Mora covered his face with his hands.

LONG BEACH MARATHON; 
</P>
<P>
WILSON, YANMIN HAVE THE PATIENCE TO WIN WITH COURSE RECORDS 
</P>

<P>
Patience is often difficult to muster for those who run the 26.2 miles of a 
marathon. The tendency is to want to finish the race as soon as possible and 
get a head start on recovering from it. 
</P>
<P>
Patience was its own virtue in the Long Beach Marathon Sunday, as the men's and 
women's winners shrewdly waited for others to make mistakes and for the sun -- 
which was obscured by cloud cover early in the race -- to burn through and take 
a toll on the runners. 
</P>
<P>
Rex Wilson of New Zealand patiently waited for the lead pack to sort itself 
out, took the lead at 10 miles and rolled to a victory in 2 hours 12 minutes 27 
seconds, a course record. The old record of 2:13:22 was set in 1986 by Ric 
Sayre. 
</P>
<P>
Among the women, the race played itself out in a calm, if not orderly, fashion. 
Wen Yanmin, a 23-year-old student from Bejing, China, picked her way through a 
strung-out pack and out-kicked Laura Konatz of Toronto to win in 2:43:33, also 
a course record. Yanmin broke the old record of 2:44:51 set last year by Dianne 
Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Molinatti of Huntington Beach won the wheelchair division in 1:47:59. 
</P>
<P>
Run as a race within a race was the Pacific Rim Marathon, which consists of 
teams from invited countries. Wilson and Yanmin won both the Long Beach 
Marathon and the Pacific Rim race, for total prize money of $9,500 each. 
</P>
<P>
Conditions were excellent at the start of the race, which had its largest-ever 
field of 4,021 entrants. The weather for the first 1 1/2 hours was cloudy and 
cool. But the mist burned off and the last eight miles -- the toughest portion 
of the marathon -- became even tougher. The refrain from the runners was, "It's 
not the heat, it's the humidity." 
</P>
<P>
The men's race was led at various times by a pack of about six runners. One by 
one they fell victim to the weather or other equally debilitating elements. 
Viktor Gural of the Soviet Union, who had been among the leaders for most of 
the race, said he had trouble with everything. Gural emphatically said it was 
too hot, "The sun went to work," was how he put it, and he said he experienced 
tenderness in his liver during the race. American food also did not agree with 
Gural -- his stomach was upset. 
</P>
<P>
He dropped from third to fifth in the race's final stages. Samson Obwocha, a 
Kenyan who lives in Gardena, waited for Gural to fade and then made his move. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him struggling and I knew I could outkick him," Obwocha said. He did, 
and finished fourth in 2:28.08. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson also made a move, or more precisely, he continued his steady 5:03 mile 
pace while the rest of the field slowed from the early, faster pace. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't really want to lead all the way," Wilson said. "But I wanted to run 
at 5-minute pace, so I had to lead." 
</P>
<P>
The strategy resulted in a personal best time in only his third marathon -- an 
event he dislikes. "I hate the marathon," Wilson, 28, said, sounding quite 
sensible. "At 21 miles I started to hurt. My legs were getting tired, my quads 
were getting tight. Those little bridges at the end were like mountains." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Wilson built a healthy lead on those "mountains" in Belmont Shores. 
Tomio Bueyoshi of Japan was second in 2:15:31 and Liu Wenzun of China was third 
in 2:19:16. 
</P>
<P>
Yanmin had to come from behind for her victory, giving the women's race an 
exciting finish. As happened in the men's race, the runners in the lead pack 
ebbed and eventually faded. Guadalupe Roman of Mexico led through much of the 
race but lost ground steadily in the last five miles and finished sixth. Two 
Soviet runners -- Irina Ruban and Tatiana Zueva -- who had run side-by-side in 
third and fourth place throughout the race, faded. Neither placed in the top 
50. 
</P>
<P>
It fell to Konatz, who had been in first and second throughout the race, to 
hang in there. Even as the Chinese runner was bearing down on her as the finish 
line came into sight. Konatz was happy with her second place time of 2:43:50. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she was ever aware of Yanmin during the race, Konatz laughed. 
</P>
<P>
"The marathon is an unpredictable event," she said. "I knew at 25 miles if 
someone had a good kick. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Someone did. So did Ngaire Drake of New Zealand, who was third in 2:44:09.

DREAM RIDE STILL HASN'T ENDED FOR VALENZUELA; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER HIS KENTUCKY DERBY VICTORY, HE RETURNS TO HOLLYPARK AND WINS AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
After a toxic overdose of "Easy Goer this" and "Easy Goer that" back in 
Kentucky, Patrick Valenzuela returned to Los Angeles early Sunday morning 
wearing a self-satisfied smile and bearing a simple, four-word message for the 
rest of the racing world: 
</P>
<P>
"I told you so." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela, who punctured Easy Goer's balloon Saturday aboard Sunday Silence, 
received a hero's welcome from friends, family and later the fans at Hollywood 
Park, where he responded by winning the first race Sunday aboard a $16,000 
claimer named Mispu. 
</P>
<P>
"He came into the paddock giving me a high five, like we were the Lakers," said 
Mispu's trainer, John Sadler. "I didn't even have to give him a leg up. He just 
floated onto the horse." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela left Louisville shortly after the Derby and touched down at LAX at 
midnight, getting home to Arcadia by 1 a.m. Before hitting the sheets, though, 
he cued up the videotape and savored the Derby telecast. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually I can sleep on flights coming home, but last night every time I closed 
my eyes all I could see was the Derby, coming down the lane through that tunnel 
of noise," said the 26-year-old jockey, who rode in two previous Derbies 
without winning. 
</P>
<P>
"This morning, I sat down with my oldest daughter, Michelle, and made sure she 
knew what her dad had done," Valenzuela said. He and his wife, Jeana, have 
three daughters: Michelle, 6, Kristin, 3, and Elizabeth, 9 months. 
</P>
<P>
"Michelle is old enough to know what it means when I win a big race. I told her 
this one was special. This one was maybe the biggest of them all." 
</P>
<P>
Michelle was duly impressed. And, as far as Valenzuela is concerned, the rest 
of the country should have the same faith that Sunday Silence will get the 
better of Easy Goer every time they run, rain or shine. 
</P>
<P>
"People were asking me all week if my colt was being underrated," Valenzuela 
said. "I told them just the opposite. It was Easy Goer who was being overrated. 
I've felt all along that my colt could be a great horse." 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer's most stubborn supporters still could be heard the day after the 
Derby, blaming his defeat on the weather, the muddy racetrack, even on the 
nine-minute delay caused by the reshoeing of longshot Triple Buck. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela had braced himself for the chorus of whining and had a ready reply. 
</P>
<P>
"Let them say what they want," the rider insisted. "Then, after Sunday Silence 
beats him again in the Preakness, let them come up with a new bunch of 
excuses." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela spent five days in Kentucky, riding a few races at Churchill Downs, 
visiting local breeding farms and stallions (including Halo, sire of Sunday 
Silence), and generally avoiding the social whirl of Derby week. 
</P>
<P>
He spent his evenings quietly, dining with his wife, his agent, Jerry Ingordo, 
and sometimes with Charlie Whittingham, Sunday Silence's trainer. 
</P>
<P>
"He really didn't want anything to do with all the parties," Ingordo said. "He 
wanted to keep a low profile." 
</P>
<P>
Whenever he showed up at the track, however, Valenzuela was bombarded with 
questions about his tumultuous past. 
</P>
<P>
Though he ranks as one of the best riders in the country, he carries the added 
baggage of well-publicized drug rehabilitations, self-imposed exiles, and more 
than a few careless riding suspensions. One year ago he was riding at an 
obscure New Mexico track, trying to salvage family, health and career. 
</P>
<P>
"If somebody wanted to talk with me about the Derby, that was great," 
Valenzuela said. "But if they wanted to talk about my personal life, I said no, 
because that's exactly what it is. Personal." 
</P>
<P>
Consider the climate, however. Valenzuela was in a media fish bowl, surrounded 
on all sides by eastern-based jockeys who had gone dramatically public with 
their own drug- and alcohol-related problems. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Day, who rode Easy Goer, and Chris Antley, New York's top rider, were 
giving expansive interviews on their private battles. 
</P>
<P>
"If that's how they want to handle it, that's fine," Valenzuela said. "Maybe 
they have learned something and can help others by talking about it in public. 
My hat's off to them. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm still discovering things about myself. I'm still growing. There are 
things I will talk about only with my wife and my family. The important thing 
is, I'm clean. I feel great. I feel . . . like I just won the Kentucky Derby." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela dedicated his Derby victory to the late Joe Manzi, the well-known 
California trainer who died of a heart attack on April 27. 
</P>
<P>
"I know, if Joe had lived, he would have won a Derby someday," said Valenzuela, 
who rode several major winners for Manzi. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela was aboard the Manzi-trained Fran's Valentine when she was 
disqualified after winning the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies in 1984, a 
professional nadir for both men. The following year, Valenzuela won the 
Kentucky Oaks on Fran's Valentine. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was in New Mexico last year, Joe was the first person to call me, 
asking me to ride in a stakes race for him," Valenzuela recalled. "That's the 
kind of friend you never forget." 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham continued his unbeatable weekend Sunday at Hollywood Park, sweeping 
the first three places in the $107,700 Wilshire Handicap with Claire Marine, 
Fitzwilliam Place and Galunpe. 
</P>
<P>
It was a virtual replay of the Budweiser/Breeders' Cup Handicap at Santa Anita 
on April 16, when the full-bodied Irish filly Claire Marine beat Bruce McNall's 
Fitzwilliam Place by 1 3/4 lengths. This time the margin was a head, as Claire 
Marine got the 1 1/16 miles on the turf in a stakes record 1:39. 
</P>
<P>
"Awesome," winning jockey Chris McCarron said. "That man is awesome." 
</P>
<P>
He was talking about Whittingham, who has been in Kentucky with Sunday Silence 
for more than two weeks and has won four California stakes in the interim. His 
assistant, Rodney Rash, has been running the local show. 
</P>
<P>
Favored by the crowd of 26,193 on-track, 8,529 off-track, Claire Marine paid 
$4.60, $2.60 and $2.10. Fitzwilliam Place, coupled with McNall's Down Again, 
returned $3 and $2.10, while Galunpe paid the minimum $2.10 to show. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Whittingham owns Claire Marine in partnership with Sidney Port. . . . 
Jockeys Alex Solis and Eddie Delahoussaye were back in action Sunday after 
taking a day off to recover from Friday's gruesome sixth-race accident. Both 
riders were airborne and landed hard, but emerged with only scrapes and 
bruises. "I know how to fly," Solis said, "but I forgot how to land." . . . ABC 
Derby telecast host Jim McKay dropped Pat Valenzuela's trophy during post-race 
ceremonies on Saturday. "And he'd better fix it if it's broken," Valenzuela 
said.

MARVIN DAVIS CONTINUES HIS SHOPPING SPREE; 
</P>
<P>
HE PASSED ON COWBOYS, BUT RICHEST MAN IN L.A. WANTS NORTHWEST AIRLINES BADLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marvin Davis, the richest man in Los Angeles, is on a billion-dollar shopping 
spree. 
</P>
<P>
He bought a pay-television service for $635 million. He looked over the Dallas 
Cowboys, but didn't buy America's team. He considered buying the Los Angeles 
Herald Examiner, but concluded that the newspaper was too sick after looking at 
its books. 
</P>
<P>
Now he's trying to buy Northwest Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
With up to four other bidders competing for the airline, Davis shows few signs 
of slowing. Yet, says one longtime friend, Davis' quest for the airline won't 
distract him from other potential investments. "One deal has nothing to do with 
the other," says Hollywood film producer Mace Neufield. 
</P>
<P>
At 6-foot-4 and 300 pounds, Davis is an imposing figure. A voracious deal maker 
with an apparent taste for high-profile companies, he has, during the past few 
years, bid for CBS and Lorimar, and bought -- and sold -- 20th Century Fox. 
</P>
<P>
A New York native, he got his start in the early 1960s as a wildcatter in the 
Rocky Mountains, picking up oil leases cheaply and patiently drilling dry holes 
until he struck oil. Davis' success as an oilman attracted investments from 
"Star Wars" producer George Lucas and such prominent political figures as Henry 
A. Kissinger and Gerald R. Ford. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charms His Opponents 
</P>
<P>
During the 1980s, Davis invested oil profits in such far-flung businesses as 
hotels, restaurants, golf courses and ski resorts. After buying Fox in 1981, 
Davis took up part-time residence in Los Angeles, paying country singer Kenny 
Rogers a whopping $20 million for his Beverly Hills estate, "The Knoll." When 
not in Los Angeles, he shuttles in his private jet between homes in Palm 
Springs and Denver, where his oil business is based. 
</P>
<P>
Guarded about his personal and business affairs, Davis, 63, rarely speaks to 
the press and through a spokeswoman, refused an interview for this story. When 
Davis does talk, he reveals little. Responding to a reporter's question about 
Northwest recently, Davis commented, "It's quite a story, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
Folksy and unassuming, Davis apparently can charm even his opponents. After 
meeting with Davis for 90 minutes three weeks ago, Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich, 
who is trying to protect Northwest from a takeover, said he liked Davis. "I 
felt like I had known him for a long time," Perpich says. 
</P>
<P>
Perpich says Davis outlined his plans for Northwest Airlines but also chatted 
about his struggle to lose weight and his father's boxing career. "You don't 
think he is a billionaire -- until you see him get off his 727 by himself," 
Perpich says. 
</P>
<P>
Davis has had a similar effect on some entertainment industry executives who 
brushed against him over the years. Norman Levy, an ex-Fox executive who sued 
the studio after he was fired in 1984, now gushes with praise for his former 
boss. Levy says Davis is "wonderful, warm and very supportive," with "terrific 
instincts about people." 
</P>
<P>
"Of course," he says, "I wish there had been a nicer way to leave the company." 
</P>
<P>
As a studio owner, oilman Davis hit a lot of dry holes. Fox turned out a 
succession of box-office flops under his ownership, such as the forgettable 
"Sixpack," the story of a stock car racer who takes in six orphans, and 
"Rhinestone," featuring Sylvester Stallone as a singing New York cab driver. 
Fox piled up losses so deep that in 1984 the company said it didn't have enough 
cash to finance its operations. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Davis left Fox a richer man. In 1985, he sold the studio in stages 
to media mogul Rupert Murdoch for a $350-million profit, keeping for himself 
prime Fox properties -- the swank Pebble Beach golf course and resort, and a 
ski resort in Aspen. 
</P>
<P>
Davis seems to sense the right time to buy a property -- and the right time to 
sell it. In 1981, just before oil prices crashed, Davis sold some oil fields to 
Canadian distiller Hiram Walker for what was later viewed as a high price of 
$630 million. In 1987, he sold the Beverly Hills Hotel to the Sultan of Brunei 
for a quick $65-million profit. The hotel had special meaning for Davis because 
he and his wife, Barbara, honeymooned there. Nonetheless, he sold it after 
owning it for only one year. 
</P>
<P>
Davis also has a talent for raising huge sums to finance his acquisitions. He 
bought Fox with just $50 million of his own money, borrowing from banks most of 
the $722 million he paid for the studio. Similarly, Davis plans to borrow most 
of the $2.7 billion needed to buy Northwest under his original offer, putting 
up just $300 million of his own funds. The airline's management contends that 
Davis can't pay off the huge debt without selling off chunks of the airline -- 
something Davis has pledged not to do. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bruised Some Feelings 
</P>
<P>
Forbes Magazine, chronicler of the super-rich, pegs Davis' wealth at $1.6 
billion, making him the richest Southern Californian next to real estate 
magnate Donald Bren. But on his way to becoming a billionaire, Davis has 
bruised some feelings. A recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing shows 
that Davis is fighting three suits by longtime Houston business associate John 
A. Masek, who claims Davis broke a contract to buy pipe from him, among other 
things. In 1986, Davis reportedly paid ex-Fox Chairman Dennis Stanfill $4 
million to settle a defamation suit. And in the mid-1980s, Davis was forced to 
buy out some unhappy oil investors, including producer Lucas and Greek shipping 
magnate Stavros Spyros Niarchos. 
</P>
<P>
There's no evidence that lawsuits have slowed Davis down. With the Prudential 
Insurance Co. as a partner, he acquired Spectadyne, a service that supplies 
pay-per-view movies to hotels, after pursuing it on and off for two years. 
</P>
<P>
He's also passed up a number of deals. Three weeks ago, his advisers toured the 
Los Angeles Herald Examiner, but well-connected sources say Davis decided 
against buying the ailing newspaper. He decided not to bid on the Dallas 
Cowboys last year after sending his son, John Davis, to check out the team. And 
in 1986, he dropped out of the bidding for historic Laird International Studios 
where "Gone with the Wind" and "Citizen Kane" were filmed. "Everyone has their 
limits," Davis said after newspaper publisher Gannett topped his $20-million 
bid by $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
If Davis acquires Northwest, it will be his biggest deal. Last week he declared 
a truce with the airline's management, dropping -- for now -- a hostile 
$90-a-share tender offer and proxy contest to replace the airline's directors. 
Along with several other bidders, said to include Los Angeles investor Alfred 
A. Checchi and Kolhberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., a New York buyout specialist, 
and even possibly the International Assn. of Machinists, Davis is reviewing 
confidential information provided by the airline and has indicated that he may 
raise his offer. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Davis lost his bid for the airline, he wouldn't walk away empty-handed. 
With NWA's shares trading at around $105, Davis has paper profits of $35 a 
share on his 3% NWA stake, or about $30 million. But his advisers say Davis 
won't happily settle for a multimillion-dollar consolation prize. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants this airline," says Josiah O. Low III, a senior vice president with 
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the investment bank hired by Davis. "No ands, 
ifs or buts about it."

FOOTNOTES: LIGHTNING-QUICK LAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Japanese, who showed the West how to make motorcycles and electronic 
equipment faster and cheaper, have now turned their attention to brewing. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's biggest brewer, Kirin, claims to have devised a process that will allow 
lager to be produced in a plant one-tenth the size of a traditional brewery in 
just three days -- lightning-quick by normal brewing standards, which can 
require up to two months to turn out a strong lager. 
</P>
<P>
Kirin's process, described vaguely as "bio-reactor technology," remains a 
mystery, although the Guardian newspaper of Britain says the company has 
applied for patents to use ceramics as a catalyst to make yeasts work harder. 
</P>
<P>
So far no outsiders have been allowed to taste the high-tech beer. But Kirin, 
whose beers command half the Japanese market, has a solid track record. Its 
engineers' current triumph on Tokyo supermarket shelves has been a designer 
vegetable called senpousai -- a cross between cabbage and spinach. 
</P>
<P>
Reading and Riding 
</P>
<P>
The people at Paisano Publications, who put out 400,000-circulation 
"Easyriders" and other motorcycle magazines, noticed that 10% of motorcycles 
are now owned by women, compared to 1% a decade ago. Sensing a business 
opportunity, the Agoura company recently hit the newsstand with a new magazine, 
"Foxyriders," for women who ride Harley-Davidsons. 
</P>
<P>
Keith R. Ball, editor of the magazine, explains that women bike fans have 
different interests from men. They join clubs called "Leather and Lace," and 
"Women in the Wind," and decorate their bikes differently. "I've seen a few 
pink bikes," he said. The inaugural issue has tips for women on bike 
maintenance, stories by women explaining their passion for the pastime, and a 
centerfold of a strapping male biker. 
</P>
<P>
A Run on Hosiery Ads 
</P>
<P>
This must be what those acquisition-minded retailers mean when they talk about 
economies of scale. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Bullocks Wilshire and I. Magnin ran a joint ad for a hosiery sale 
saying that the stockings could be purchased at either store. But a spokeswoman 
said that doesn't mean that R. H. Macy &amp; Co., which bought the two chains a 
year ago, is thinking of combining them. 
</P>
<P>
"Both companies have two very distinct personalities, and there is no intention 
of integrating them," she said. "Where it makes sense to advertise products 
like cosmetics or hosiery, we intend to strengthen our advertising by 
advertising both chains." Most ads, she indicated, will continue to keep the 
two chains' socks -- and shirts and suits -- in different drawers. 
</P>
<P>
Been There, Done That 
</P>
<P>
The biggest California banks, such as Bank of America and Wells Fargo, recently 
began offering Saturday hours. Big deal, Great Western Bank says. 
</P>
<P>
In a press release sent to business editors last week, the large Beverly 
Hills-based institution (which is also a savings and loan, despite its name) 
noted that it has been offering Saturday hours at selected branches since the 
mid-1970s. "We helped write the book on extended hours many years ago," it 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Most news accounts of the recent entry of California banks into the Saturday 
market -- including several stories in The Times -- did not note that, Great 
Western said. For reasons of its own, Great Western's bulletin did not name any 
of several other savings and loans that also have been offering Saturday hours 
for years.

Farah in Takeover Talks: Farah Inc., a maker of jeans and popular sportswear, 
said it is in substantive talks to sell the company in a deal worth at least 
$69 million. Farah, which makes clothes under its own and the Generra label, 
gave no other details. A full buyout of Farah would value the company at $69 
million based on its stock price of $11.25 Friday. The El Paso-based company 
said it and investment bank Wertheim Schroder are reviewing transactions to 
maximize shareholder value. Farah said Salant Corp., another sportswear maker, 
has decided not to proceed with its proposal to buy Farah.

Rebound in Foreign Stock Buying: American investors added $1.5 billion to their 
holdings of foreign stocks last year, reversing the net sales of 1987, the 
Securities Industry Assn. reported. In 1987, the year of the crash, Americans 
had sold $1.1 billion more of foreign stocks than they bought, the group said. 
Meanwhile, foreigners sold more U.S. stocks than they bought last year by a 
margin of $2.1 billion, compared to net purchases of $16.3 billion in 1987. 
Foreign investment in all kinds of U.S. securities rose to $75 billion last 
year from $69.4 billion in 1987, according to the survey, which covered 
investors in Britain, the United States, West Germany, Japan and Canada.

Investors Sue Resorts International: An investment firm wants Merv Griffin to 
repurchase $325 million in notes used to buy Resorts International Inc., 
claiming that the entertainer misrepresented the company's financial condition. 
Peter Stuyvesant Ltd. is alleging that Griffin, Resorts, the investment firm of 
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., some top officers of Griffin's company and other 
defendants tried to "inflate the publicly reported assets, earnings and net 
worth of Resorts." The allegations were made in a class-action suit filed April 
19 in U.S. District Court in New Jersey. Christopher Whitney, Resorts' chief of 
staff, said he had not yet seen the lawsuit and could not comment.

MEMO: SPECIAL EFFECTS SPOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What is the most expensive special effects commercial of all time? No one seems 
to know. But several ad executives say one of the most costly -- $1 million to 
create and air just once -- has to be a 1984 ad for Apple Computer that aired 
during the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The spot, which showed a futuristic vision of George Orwell's 1984, featured 
hundreds of actors and required numerous effects. Among them was a Big Brother 
character illuminated on a big screen. A woman in Olympic garb, apparently 
competing in the hammer throw event, tossed a ball-and-chain hammer at the 
giant screen and destroyed it. 
</P>
<P>
More special effects commercials are filmed in Los Angeles each year than 
anywhere else in the world. What is it that makes a special effects ad really 
special? 
</P>
<P>
"The best special effects ads," said Ted Goetz, president of the West Coast 
chapter of the Assn. of Independent Commercial Producers, "are those you don't 
even realize have special effects." 
</P>
<P>
For example, numerous airline ads that appear to be shot in foreign countries 
are actually shot in production studios. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps one of the biggest boons to West Coast special effects companies may be 
Japanese advertisers. Among them, Nissan and a Japanese unit of Coca-Cola, have 
recently created ads with costly special effects, made exclusively for the 
Japanese market. "Usually, the Japanese use more special effects when the 
dollar is weak and the yen is strong," said John Dykstra, chairman of Apogee 
Productions. 
</P>
<P>
What about those "miniature" scale models used in commercials that look like 
the Empire State Building or even the surface of the moon? Ever wonder what 
those can cost? Executives say a simple space ship can be built for $5,000, 
while a complex cityscape can cost up to $50,000. BRUCE HOROVITZ

ITALIAN ISLE BURNED OVER CAPRI CIGARETTES

The Italian island of Capri wants no part of Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco 
Corp.'s cigarette of the same name -- no part except a legal settlement, at 
least. 
</P>
<P>
A lawsuit that the island filed against the Louisville-based tobacco company 
goes to trial in Rome on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Capri officials say they do not want their paradise associated with a 
potentially harmful product, and Brown &amp; Williamson has no right to market 
a cigarette in Italy if Capri vetoes the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The manufacturer has contended that the action is groundless because the 
company has complied with "all applicable laws in securing rights to use the 
Capri name in Italy and in other countries where the brand is sold," said 
company spokeswoman Valeris Oates. 
</P>
<P>
Oates said the company obtained necessary approvals from Italian trademark 
officials and the nationally owned cigarette distribution system. 
</P>
<P>
Browns &amp; Williamson sells Capri in 60 countries, including the United 
States, where it went into national distribution last year. Billed as the 
"slimmest ultra-slim," the cigarette is aimed at women.

ALASKA CLAIMS EXXON IS NOT PAYING FOR LOST TOURISM, DESPITE PROMISES 
</P>

<P>
Despite assurances by Exxon executives, the oil company has not been paying 
tourism-related losses attributed to the nation's worst oil spill, state 
officials and business operators say. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Clarke, a special assistant to Gov. Steve Cowper, said there are wide 
disparities between what top Exxon officials are saying publicly and what is 
happening to the claims of tourism operators. 
</P>
<P>
"Depending on who you talk to, you get different answers," Clarke said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Tribble, manager of Exxon's Valdez claims office, said the company gives 
priority to "on-the-water" claims, and that claims covering tourism losses on 
shore will be handled later. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism is a billion-dollar-a-year industry in Alaska. Many segments already 
are taking a beating from the spill, which fouled hundreds of miles of beaches 
along Prince William Sound and the southern Alaska coast. 
</P>
<P>
Sport fishing guides, tour boat and bus tour operators are reporting a run of 
cancellations, and a sharp decrease in the number of bookings they normally 
would be taking this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon agreed this week to finance a $4-million media blitz aimed at key markets 
across the country that contribute about one-third of the state's visitors each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
But that general assistance apparently isn't being translated to individual 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Williams, who runs bus tours out of Eagle River to Homer, Seward and 
Prince William Sound, said he submitted two claims, totaling more than $30,000, 
for tours canceled as a direct result of the spill. 
</P>
<P>
He said his claims were rejected by Exxon, and he was told by a claims adjuster 
that "nobody in tourist-related businesses falls under the (reimbursement) 
guidelines at this time." 
</P>
<P>
"I know there's a lot of people losing a lot of bookings," Williams said. "Our 
phones just stopped ringing about three weeks ago." 
</P>
<P>
Exxon spokesman Tribble insisted no such claims have been denied, but 
acknowledged they haven't been paid either. He said the company's emphasis at 
this point is to take care of commercial fishermen and tour boat operators. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't addressed any type of off-water claims yet," said Tribble. "I'm not 
saying we're not going to." 
</P>
<P>
"Tourism in Alaska is much bigger than me or you or this man with his 21-day 
tour," Tribble said. "I don't have the authority to make that decision." 
</P>
<P>
Asked who did have the authority, Tribble replied: "I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Clarke said he couldn't see any difference between a commercial fisherman's 
claim and one from a bus tour operator like Williams or a sport fishing guide 
who lost clients because of the spill. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke said the problem has been particularly severe in Cordova, a community 
almost entirely dependent on commercial fishing. 
</P>
<P>
He said Exxon had announced earlier Thursday that it would pay claims only to 
fishermen and processors, and not to "Main Street businesses" like restaurants, 
grocery stores and hardware stores, even though they are totally dependent on 
fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
"After considerable haranguing from a lot of quarters," Exxon reversed itself, 
and said it would pay claims for those businesses in Cordova, Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the state has a written agreement with Exxon promising to pay the 
secondary claims in Cordova. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke said the governor's office will continue to try to make claims officers 
follow the policies enunciated publicly by Exxon executives. 
</P>
<P>
"When it gets right down to filing claims, it is something very different," 
Clarke said of Exxon's actions. "There's a little fancy footwork going on." 
</P>
<P>
Clarke said the spill chill has stretched as far south as Ketchikan where sport 
fishing guides have reported cancellations, even though the oil is 700 miles to 
the northwest. 
</P>
<P>
"The lack of knowledge of Alaska geography is working against us," Clarke said.

NEW TWIST IN TEEN DRINKING; 
</P>
<P>
'DROP PARTIES' LEAVE O.C. INDUSTRIAL AREAS A MESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The yellow flyer began circulating at Fountain Valley High School about 
midweek. "Party," it announced in letters scrawled above a drawing of beer 
being poured into the gaping mouth of Garfield, the cartoon cat. "Four kegs." 
</P>
<P>
The accompanying map, however, did not lead to a park or to a house of 
teen-agers whose parents were out of town for the weekend. Instead, it led to a 
dead-end street in a Fountain Valley industrial park, where high school 
students set up beer kegs and blasting stereos in a fenced parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Such gatherings -- known as "drop parties" because organizers drop into an 
industrial area and start partying -- are the latest twist in high school 
drinking, according to police in several Orange County cities. Hundreds of 
teen-agers flock to the gatherings, eager to pay an admission charge of $2 to 
$5 to party beside deserted warehouses and office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen as many kids at a party as I did this particular evening. 
There was an unbelievable amount of beer," said Huntington Beach Police Sgt. 
Luis Ochoa, describing a recent drop party that drew about 900 people. "The 
street was blocked with kids and their cars, and the area was totally littered 
with trash." 
</P>
<P>
Just this weekend, Huntington Beach police were hit by yet another drop party 
-- this one at the fenced-in site of a tool manufacturing company in the 
industrialized north end of the city. 
</P>
<P>
This time, police were ready: Tipped off in advance about the party, patrol 
units raided the area around 8 p.m. Saturday -- long before the beer blast was 
to have hit its peak -- and arrested five juveniles who police said had cut 
through gate locks on the Business Drive premises. 
</P>
<P>
In a scene that local law enforcement officials say has become all too 
familiar, the Huntington Beach police also confiscated alcohol from the many 
carloads of youths that had flooded the area, and warned the estimated 200 to 
300 party-goers to stay away from the site. 
</P>
<P>
Though high school beer parties are hardly unusual, police say drop parties 
pose problems beyond drinking and driving. It takes a lot of police officers to 
persuade hundreds of tipsy teen-agers to leave a party scene peacefully, Ochoa 
said. 
</P>
<P>
There have been no drop party riots so far, Ochoa said, "but the potential for 
problems is much greater in these situations." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Patrolling Industrial Parks 
</P>
<P>
Police departments have responded by patrolling industrial parks on weekend 
nights and by sometimes making arrests when they find the parties. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley police also had heard about the April 29 party advertised in 
the flyer and arrested 28 young people, 20 of whom were younger than 18. The 
adults were cited for trespassing. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach police, alerted to a March 31 drop party in the northwest part 
of the city, sent undercover officers to infiltrate it. Seven people were 
arrested, including 19-year-old James Burnett, believed to be the party's 
organizer. Burnett was charged with six misdemeanor counts including 
trespassing and providing alcohol to minors, Ochoa said, and the other six 
arrested were turned over to juvenile authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Police have broken up six or seven other drop parties in Huntington Beach this 
year, he added. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, police began being noticing drop parties about 3 years ago, 
Police Department spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said. Police break up two or three 
of the parties a year without arresting anyone, Thomas said. The last drop 
party spotted by police was in early April, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Younger Party-Goers 
</P>
<P>
But unlike this year's drop parties in Fountain Valley and Huntington Beach, 
Thomas said, Santa Ana's gatherings have been attended by college-age rather 
than high school students. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley High School Principal Mike Kasler, whose staff told police 
about the party flyer, said he is troubled by the increasing sophistication of 
those who publicize and organize the parties. 
</P>
<P>
"You used to hear about things like this primarily at the college level," 
Kasler said. "Now it's surfacing more and more at high schools." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities believe young people pay to party at industrial parks because the 
parks are deserted after dark and far from homeowners, who are known to summon 
police at the first shriek of a stereo. 
</P>
<P>
But police say industrial parks also serve the interests of party organizers, 
who post themselves at the parking lot gate to make sure everyone pays an 
admission fee. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no need to trespass" in a deserted industrial area, said Fountain 
Valley Police Sgt. Larry Griswold. "The only reason they needed the fenced area 
was so they could charge. . . . The kids are the ones being set up, not just 
for the loss of their money, but for their arrest." 
</P>
<P>
When Huntington Beach undercover officers arrested Burnett, he had about $450 
in his pockets, Ochoa said. "It's just a new gimmick to make money at someone 
else's expense," Ochoa said of the drop parties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Owners Pay Price 
</P>
<P>
Among those who pay the price for the parties are the owners of the party 
sites. A drop party organizer in Huntington Beach decided the fenced parking 
lot of Kingston Machine Tool Manufacturing was the perfect place to gather, 
leaving owner Stan Lin with the trash from four drop parties in the last 3 
months. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a mess," Lin said. "Cups, papers, beer bottles all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
Drop party organizers repeatedly cut the lock on Lin's gate, and Burnett even 
told police he had Lin's permission to hold a party there, Ochoa said. 
</P>
<P>
Company employees cleaned up after the first three parties, then Huntington 
Beach police sent officers to infiltrate the fourth, Lin said. And the city 
sent a five-person crew to clean up afterward, Lin said. The drop parties 
stopped after the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Lin said he can only guess why his business has been so popular with the drop 
party crowd. "You cannot see it from the road -- maybe that's it," Lin said of 
his business. "I wish I knew why."

CUPBOARD GROWING BARE AT CENTER FOR NEEDY IN ORANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The packaged pasta salad, boxed raisins and sodas are still stacked in rows at 
the Food Distribution Center, a large warehouse on West Almond Avenue in Orange 
that is home to Orange County's largest food bank. 
</P>
<P>
But the center's cavernous, 5,000-square-foot refrigerator -- which just 6 
months ago was full of such wholesome foods as cheese, breads, meats and 
vegetables destined for food pantries and other social service groups -- has 
been shut off. 
</P>
<P>
The center supplies 221 soup kitchens, pantries, shelters and churches in 
Orange County that feed more than 120,000 people, but it is running out of 
food, and officials have started a campaign to increase donations and find new 
food sources. 
</P>
<P>
Reasons for the shortage vary: Last year's Midwest drought has reduced many 
products available for donation, the U.S. government has cut surplus 
commodities and some donor supermarkets have merged into larger chains that do 
not participate in food bank programs. 
</P>
<P>
"All sources must be tapped," said Kelly Sullivan, resource director for the 
center. "It is not just one sector of society that can provide it all. This is 
everyone's responsibility, and the key is bringing everyone together." 
</P>
<P>
Among the options under consideration is a novel program to get tons of unused 
restaurant food to the needy and establishing a coordinator of 
employer-sponsored food drives countywide. 
</P>
<P>
But officials realize that a formidable problem locally may be perception: Many 
people find it hard to believe that there is a hunger problem in Orange County. 
That misconception can make soliciting donations of food and money extremely 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Service providers say the wealth and opulence of such communities as Newport 
Beach mask pockets of poverty. Such misperceptions "are shared by even the most 
caring, concerned people in the county, because they just don't see the needy," 
said Mark Lowry, director of food services for the Community Development 
Council, which operates the county's other main food bank. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County has a national reputation as a wealthy, crime-free, conservative 
haven," he said. "That is what we try to portray to ourselves, and it just 
doesn't fit into the picture to throw in hungry people and the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
Social service officials estimate that more than 380,000 county residents are 
at risk of going hungry at least once each month. 
</P>
<P>
"I see new faces every day," said Bob Jordan, food room manager in the Santa 
Ana office of the Episcopal Service Alliance, an ecumenical service group. 
"They come in from other parts of the state, from Los Angeles. Many are the 
working poor who can't make ends meet." 
</P>
<P>
Lowry said the Community Development Council has about 123 member agencies that 
served 500,000 people in 1988. For many, the need for food handouts stems 
directly from the high cost of housing in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We live in the most expensive housing market in the United States," he said, 
"and because the rent takes a larger percentage of income, it leaves a smaller 
percentage for meals." 
</P>
<P>
June Marcott, program manager for the county's food stamp program, said that 
for many needy -- such as the elderly on fixed incomes -- food is low in 
priority, to be dealt with after rent, utilities and other bills are paid. 
</P>
<P>
"For the most part," she added, "it's not a question of starvation in the 
county but of people not eating adequately or sufficiently." 
</P>
<P>
Whether the problem is malnutrition in the county or starvation in other areas, 
service providers say more efficient salvage of discarded food could 
drastically reduce the hunger problem, locally and on a national scale. 
</P>
<P>
The Second Harvest Network, a national affiliation of food banks, distributed 
more than 400 million pounds of discarded food 
</P>
<P>
in 1988. Its sponsors estimate that one-fifth of the food produced in the 
country is thrown out before it gets to the table. 
</P>
<P>
"There is still an awful lot out there that could be channeled to the needy," 
said Linda Saran, communications director for the group. 
</P>
<P>
But officials admit that they may never salvage all of the 2.5 million pounds 
of food wasted each month in the county. 
</P>
<P>
In part, officials say, they face the problems that food banks worldwide face: 
The mechanics of getting the available food to the people who need it is an 
enormous challenge, even on a small scale. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Harney, executive director of the food center, said: "There are lots of 
sources we haven't tapped yet, but there are many elements like transportation, 
health regulations, capacity to handle food that are all delicately balanced 
and have to operate efficiently if it's to work at all." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protected From Liability 
</P>
<P>
Efforts are further hindered because many in the food industry do not realize 
that the state's Good Samaritan Law, passed in 1980, protects them from 
liability for donated food. 
</P>
<P>
Many food companies regularly dump tons of usable food that is not considered 
salable for some reason, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that some retailers and food processors, even when told 
there is no liability, sincerely believe it is still an open question," said 
Frank Quevedo, director of corporate relations for Fullerton-based 
Beatrice-Hunt-Wesson Foods. 
</P>
<P>
The center's Harney said his food bank has the capacity to handle about 25 
million pounds of food a year. Last year, the group distributed 6.9 million 
pounds, capturing about 15% of food that would have otherwise been thrown away. 
</P>
<P>
Most of that food came from major food manufacturers but was also gathered from 
local supermarkets, food drives and gleaning programs, where volunteers gather 
produce that is left over from harvests. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers also discard food that may be approaching the end of its shelf 
life but is still safe for consumption, said Quevedo of Beatrice-Hunt-Wesson 
Foods. 
</P>
<P>
While providers say more of this discarded food can be tapped, they also call 
for new ideas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ways to Boost Percentage 
</P>
<P>
Quevedo, a member of the food center's board of directors, said the group is 
considering ways to increase the percentage of food it salvages. 
</P>
<P>
One idea is to coordinate food drives yearly to space the flow of food evenly. 
Most employers hold such drives during the holiday season in November and 
December, he said, whereas the food need is year round. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of employers in this county, and if we could average 10,000 to 
12,000 pounds of food a month, we could generate nearly 150,000 pounds of food 
yearly just with food drives," Quevedo said. "I think this is doable. With more 
coordination, there would be more cooperation, and we could establish a goal." 
</P>
<P>
The group is also considering a plan -- modeled on two successful programs in 
Atlanta and Tucson -- to tap discarded restaurant food more aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
Kathe Padillo, manager of the year-old Tucson's Table, said the restaurant 
program there delivered more than 125,000 pounds of food donated by 100 
eateries in its first year of operation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leftover Restaurant Food 
</P>
<P>
Padillo said the program uses a large truck designed with the help of local 
health officials to transport leftover or unused restaurant food to their own 
refrigerators for delivery in specially designed plastic containers to about 55 
food pantries, soup kitchens and the like. 
</P>
<P>
Food workers inspect the food when it is taken in. The program ensures that it 
is checked again before it is served. 
</P>
<P>
Padillo stressed that the discarded restaurant food is not what most people 
would associate with leftovers. 
</P>
<P>
For example, one prime rib restaurant regularly saves the "tails" left over 
when the meat is cut to a standard size, then donates what amounts to "hundreds 
of pounds of prime beef a week to the needy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"A whole lot of people are real tired of throwing away tons of food each 
night," Padillo said. "For a (service) agency that usually has a lot of peanut 
butter and hot dogs on its menu to go to quiche and ruffled potatoes is fun, 
and it's good, solid nutrition they would otherwise not be able to afford."

BACKERS OF TAX IN CAPISTRANO UNIFIED SAY IT WILL BE CLOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Backers of a measure on the ballot Tuesday that would raise property taxes in 
the Capistrano Unified School District are sure that voters in bedroom 
communities of southern Orange County know the value of an education. 
</P>
<P>
They are just afraid that many of them, especially those who commute long 
distances to work, will not make it home in time to cast their votes on the 
measure aimed at raising money to build new schools and refurbish old ones. 
</P>
<P>
"I just get nervous that people will forget and assume that their neighbors' 
support or their spouse's support will take care of the 'yes' vote," said 
Sheila Benecke, chairwoman of the political action committee formed to campaign 
for the measure. 
</P>
<P>
"It is going to be tight," Benecke said. "I think the votes are there, but the 
fear I have is that people will say, 'Oh, I wanted to do this, but I forgot,' 
or they won't get back to town on time, (and) we will have 'yes' voters who 
won't show up to vote." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special-Tax District 
</P>
<P>
The measure would make all of Capistrano Unified a special-tax district to 
raise funds for new school construction in the fast-growing area. Creation of 
such a district -- known as a Mello-Roos district -- requires approval of 
two-thirds of the voters. Very few localities in the state have given a 
two-thirds vote to such proposals in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
If the measure passes, it would raise property taxes $100 a year on existing 
single-family homes, and $60 a year on existing condominiums, apartments and 
mobile homes. Owners of single-family homes built after the election would pay 
$200 more a year, and owners of new townhouses, mobile homes and apartments 
would pay $120 a year. Senior citizens would be exempt from the new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Existing commercial and industrial buildings would be assessed 6 cents more per 
square foot in taxes, with new buildings being assessed 12 cents more. 
</P>
<P>
The election would raise $85 million over 25 years and would enable the 
district to build three elementary schools, a junior high school and part of a 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overcrowding Problem 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Unified officials said they put the measure on the ballot because 
the district has a severe overcrowding problem that will only get worse because 
of the rapid rate of new-home development in southern Orange County, where most 
of the county's undeveloped land is concentrated. Capistrano Unified Supt. 
Jerome R. Thornsley said the district's enrollment is expected to grow by 7,000 
students by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign for the measure has been targeted to key voters in the sprawling 
school district, which stretches from Laguna Niguel to the San Diego County 
line and includes the cities of San Clemente, Dana Point, Mission Viejo, San 
Juan Capistrano, and the communities of Rancho Santa Margarita and Capistrano 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Benecke said there are 94,000 registered voters in the district but that 
campaign organizers are being careful only to send out literature to those most 
likely to vote, particularly those who voted in the last election. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly don't have the funds to communicate with all these (94,000) 
voters by mail," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Benecke said the committee, which has enlisted the help of a political 
consulting firm, has so far spent about $50,000, money that has been raised 
through donations from parents, most of which has been collected by mail 
solicitations. "We spend only as we raise it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent effort to raise taxes for schools in Orange County went down to 
defeat when voters by a ratio of 3 to 1 rejected Westminster School District's 
proposed $1.4 million tax levy on March 7. Westminster's Measure A would have 
raised $100 per property owner and $200 per business to repair the financially 
strapped district's aging facilities and restore budgets cuts. The levy would 
have expired in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Although there have been other Mello-Roos special taxing districts created in 
Orange County, including some for housing developments within Capistrano 
Unified, Tuesday's election will be Orange County's first for a school 
district. The Westminster district measure would have raised money directly for 
the district's general fund, not through creation of a special district 
empowered to issue bonds as Capistrano Unified would be. 
</P>
<P>
Thornsley said a few other such elections have been successful in other parts 
of the state. He said the Elk Grove School District in north-central California 
lost a Mello-Roos election the first time around but got approval of two-thirds 
of its voters within the last year. 
</P>
<P>
Thornsley said no organized opposition to the measure has surfaced so far, but 
he added that he fears some voters will see a 'no' vote on the measure as a way 
to stop the areas's fast growth. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some people (in the Capistrano district) against growth," he said. 
"Some people think that if we don't get the funds, the growth will stop. That's 
erroneous. The people will still come." 
</P>
<P>
Both Benecke and Thornsley say they are counting on parents in the generally 
affluent district to make the connection between quality education and adequate 
classroom space, which requires more money than is currently available. 
</P>
<P>
"The educational level and sophistication of our parents is quite high," 
Thornsley said. "They know firsthand the value of an education -- that it's not 
just an expenditure, but an investment."

MILD EARTHQUAKE JARS PORTIONS OF SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A mild earthquake sent slight tremors through northern Orange County and 
elsewhere in the Southland late Saturday night. No injuries or damage was 
reported, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The quake, centered about a mile northwest of Brea, hit at 11:07 p.m. Saturday 
and measured 3.7, according to seismologists at the Caltech Seismology 
Laboratory in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
It was reportedly felt from northern Orange County and throughout the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have any real problems," said Lt. Harold Schaffrotch of the Orange 
County Sheriff's Department. "We got a couple of phone calls from the north 
county asking if we had had an earthquake, but that was really about it."

<P>
Officers said the man entered the store at 10:45 p.m. Saturday and approached 
an employee, indicating to him that he was armed. The man demanded money, and 
the employee gave him some cash from the register. The man reached over and 
scooped out the remaining money before fleeing, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect was described as about 30 years old, 5 feet, 7 inches tall, about 
140 pounds and having sandy, graying hair. No one was injured in the incident, 
police said.

CONCERN OVER REFUGEE POLICY IS VOICED IN LITTLE SAIGON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA LUTHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 150 people -- mostly Vietnamese immigrants -- met Sunday in Little Saigon 
in Westminster to express their concern over policies toward Vietnamese 
refugees that will be under consideration by "first asylum" countries meeting 
in Geneva next month. 
</P>
<P>
The local conference was organized by Nhiem Tong of Cerritos, a Caltrans 
engineer who escaped by boat from Vietnam 14 years ago, and Tom Wilson of 
Irvine, a Tustin High School physics teacher whose Vietnamese wife is trapped 
in a refugee camp along the Thai-Cambodia border. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he is particularly concerned that a new screening process put into 
effect a year ago in Hong Kong -- where the largest number of Vietnamese 
refugees go first for asylum -- will be adopted by other countries that receive 
large numbers of these refugees. Other first-asylum countries include Thailand, 
Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the screening is spurious," said Wilson. "We're trying to bring the 
world's attention to the fact (that) we believe screening implies forced 
repatriation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only 3 of 12,000 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said that if the screening policy is put into effect by those countries, 
it will condemn tens of thousands of refugees to a life in which they can never 
be accepted by their new countries and also can never return to their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's new policy has allowed only three people of 12,000 screened to earn 
official "refugee" status, according to Simon Ripley, a London attorney who was 
a speaker Sunday at the Westminster conference. 
</P>
<P>
Ripley said the remaining refugees have been declared "economic migrants" who 
are put in camps awaiting repatriation. These migrants are subject to forceable 
return at any time, he said. Most, he said, fear that they would be imprisoned, 
or worse, by the communist government in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson and others at the conference wore black ribbons pinned to their clothing 
to express mourning for the death of 130 Vietnamese "boat people" last week. 
The boat of refugees attempting to escape their country was attacked by 
pirates. There was only one survivor. 
</P>
<P>
Tong and Wilson said they hope to send one or two representatives to Geneva. 
"We want to voice our objection to this," Tong said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he met his wife, Dinh Thi Kim Huyen, when she was his interpreter 
during his six-month stay at Site 2 camp in Thailand. They were married at the 
camp, which he said she has little hope of leaving. 
</P>
<P>
He said Sunday's conference "is about her, but it's about everyone."

POSTSCRIPT: WOMAN DOGGEDLY PURSUES THE CAUSE OF SON'S JAIL DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCILLE RENWICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the past 7 months, Esther Orozco has been trying to find a reason for her 
son's death. 
</P>
<P>
She has gone to the ACLU, Orange County Jail officials, the district attorney, 
lawyers and victim centers, all to no avail. But she refuses to give up her 
quest for answers as to why her 28-year-old son, Robert, was found dead in his 
bunk in the County Jail last August. 
</P>
<P>
"They never gave me a real reason," the 67-year-old woman said last week. "The 
death certificate said the cause of death was undetermined. What's 
undetermined?" 
</P>
<P>
The mother said she believes that coroner's officials must have found more 
information when they performed an autopsy on her son. But autopsy reports 
revealed no foul play and only traces of cocaine in his system. Coroner's 
officials said they believe that the inmate died of drug withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park police arrested Esther Orozco's son Aug. 7 on suspicion of 
strong-arm robbery. He allegedly attempted to walk out of an Albertson's 
supermarket with a cartload of groceries. He was scheduled to be arraigned on 
Aug. 9 -- the morning he died. 
</P>
<P>
Inmates in the dormitory-style prison room said Orozco had complained the night 
before his death that he was ill. One inmate said Orozco had "begged" for 
medication but was not helped. Jail nurses and paramedics were called to 
Orozco's bunk when it appeared that he was not breathing, Orange County 
Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. Richard J. Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
An Orange County Grand Jury subsequently found that the autopsy was 
satisfactory and declared that there was no need for further investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Orozco's mother, who lived with her son in La Puente, said he had a history of 
cocaine and heroin abuse and was glad to be in jail. He had made previous 
attempts to quit -- turning to religion, methadone detoxification programs and 
going cold turkey -- but nothing seemed to work. 
</P>
<P>
"He couldn't go to special clinics because they charged too much money," the 
mother said. Her son was unemployed at the time of his death. 
</P>
<P>
"When he was arrested, he told me not to worry, that he was safe in jail and 
this was the only place where he knew he could get better," she said. "And then 
the next day, he's dead." 
</P>
<P>
She sought legal assistance from the American Civil Liberties Union, but was 
referred to the Police Misconduct Referral Panel. Then she was referred to 
Victims of Crime in Los Angeles, but she still was not satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"She wanted an attorney to represent her and the ACLU does not do personal 
lawsuits of that nature," said Rebecca Jurado, an attorney with that agency. 
</P>
<P>
Orozco was also referred to a pair of Los Angeles attorneys who initially 
requested information on her son's background and specifics of the case. But 
months later, she said, they unexpectedly dropped the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
"They gave us so much hope about this, and told us we had a real good case, 
then all of a sudden he says he can't help us anymore," Orozco said. "We didn't 
do nothing or talk to nobody for 4 months because we thought they would help 
us, but nothing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She tried the Legal Aid Society in Santa Ana, which referred her to the senior 
citizens division. There, she was told that she received too much in Social 
Security income to qualify for assistance. So, officials referred her to yet 
another office. 
</P>
<P>
"They gave me the number, but I haven't called them, because everybody tells me 
to go to somebody else and nobody can help," she said in a defeated tone. "And 
I don't have the money for what they want." 
</P>
<P>
Orozco said she is not interested in receiving money for her son's death -- 
just a satisfactory explanation of how he died. 
</P>
<P>
"If he had died of an overdose or withdrawal, then that's OK, we could accept 
that," said Robert Orozco's sister, Kathy Lopez. "But not to say it was 
undetermined. . . . He just died and was forgotten like a nobody. He wasn't a 
nobody. He was somebody to us and we deserve a better answer than what we got."

Q&amp;A: GERRY FINDLEY; 
</P>
<P>
BANKING ON TRUST; 
</P>
<P>
CONSULTANT SAYS INDUSTRY IMAGE INTACT DESPITE S&amp;L WOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By James S. Granelli, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With 32 years of experience, the fiercely independent and outspoken Gerry 
Findley has become the dean of California banking consultants. 
</P>
<P>
Through his Brea-based company, Findley, 68, has helped to start more than 200 
banks and savings and loans. He regularly advises bankers on such things as 
their dealings with regulators, their executive compensation programs, their 
policy manuals and their merger and acquisition negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The Findley Reports, a family owned business, has grown into multifaceted 
operation that also includes the publication of books, manuals and annual 
reports on the financial results of California's banks and its savings and 
loans. His two daughters operate the publishing and bookkeeping end, and his 
son practices banking law out of the suite of company offices. 
</P>
<P>
Findley, who is partial to the smaller, independent banks, is wary about the 
effect that legislative efforts to save the S&amp;L industry will have on the 
banking industry. President Bush, who proposed the legislation, already has 
arranged a task force of regulators from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance 
Corp. and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to handle the plethora of problem 
S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
Besides rejuvenating the cash-starved FSLIC, the bills would fold the FSLIC 
into the FDIC, which insures deposits at banks. It also would merge many of the 
regulatory functions. 
</P>
<P>
Findley recently spoke with Times staff writer James S. Granelli about his 
concerns for the banking industry under the Bush proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Will FDIC examination of all the savings and loans mean that S&amp;Ls will 
now be held to much stricter insurance rules? 
</P>
<P>
A. They are certainly going to be held to a much stricter code of conduct and 
examination standards than they have been. I think in a short period of time, 
the FDIC standards will be the same for banks and savings and loans. This is 
going to restrict the entry of new savings and loans. Of course you've got to 
realize that we have had no savings and loans created in the last 3 or 4 years, 
which in itself says something about the need for this industry. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are the FDIC and banking regulators strong enough to the handle the S&amp;L 
problem? 
</P>
<P>
A We have some strong reservations about that. We feel the FDIC's plate is too 
full and consequently the banking industry will suffer, from the lack of 
attention if nothing else. We're already noticing that they are putting more 
and more of their examinations on a data base, or on a computer model, to 
monitor banks. And they're moving to larger, longer periods in terms of 
physical examinations of institutions. This, of course, is not good for the 
banking industry, in my opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Why is that? 
</P>
<P>
A. When you go into an examination, you've got to look people in the eye. You 
can't tell it from a computer model. Figures can lie like the dickens. So 
you've got to go look at the character of the people and how they're playing 
the game and get a feel for whether they're up to something. That's partly the 
savings and loan story: very weak supervision, very weak examinations. So the 
weaker the examinations become, the more likely there will be trouble in the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Q. If the combined forces of the FDIC and FSLIC are spread too thin, will the 
door be opened again to the kind of sharp operator who has ruined banks and 
S&amp;Ls in the past? 
</P>
<P>
A. I hope not. I think the sharp operator in the savings and loan industry is 
going to be brought into control, put on a leash considerably more than in the 
past. Whether it opens the door for operators in the banking industry to be a 
little more free in some of their moves, we'll have to wait and see. I hope it 
doesn't. But we've got other examiners helping in the banking industry that we 
really don't have in the savings and loan. The Federal Reserve Board is more 
involved in the banking industry, and the state banking department is much 
stronger from the examination standpoint than the state savings and loan 
commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Who are the losers in S&amp;L rescue legislation now in Congress? 
</P>
<P>
A I think the biggest loser ultimately is probably going to be the (trade 
group) U.S. League of Savings and Loan. And maybe the politicians because the 
special interests won't be there to contribute to their campaigns or their PACs 
(political action committees), or at least not in the amount they have in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How about the taxpayers? 
</P>
<P>
A. Oh, certainly, the taxpayers are going to be hit good. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are there any winners, any gainers in all this? 
</P>
<P>
A Not really. It's hard to look and see who really comes out ahead on this. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you think the new legislation will restore public confidence in the 
banking system in general? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think it will probably be a positive factor. I don't believe that 
confidence in the banking industry has been too damaged, even though we've had 
an unusual number of bank failures and problems in banks. It has been so far 
overshadowed by the sick savings and loans. So I don't think confidence in 
banks has been hurt. The savings and loans, I really don't think they're ever 
going to recover fully. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Have S&amp;Ls outlived their usefulness? 
</P>
<P>
A. In my judgment, that's true. 
</P>
<P>
Q. With the takeover this year of Lincoln Savings and Gibraltar Savings, two 
huge institutions in California, are we seeing a new wave of failures? 
</P>
<P>
A. I don't know if we're seeing a new wave. What we've seen is the fact you can 
lose an awful lot of money very fast in some of these operations. Size does not 
seem to be a critical issue anymore in terms of making an institution safe. I 
don't think that regulators have the same reluctance to move in on large banks 
and S&amp;Ls as they once did. The FDIC is possibly more aggressive than FSLIC 
was, and I really think that's partly because the FDIC is not as political. 
Unfortunately, the savings and loan industry has a long history of being very 
political. 
</P>
<P>
Q. The S&amp;L industry would say the same about the banking industry, wouldn't 
it? 
</P>
<P>
A They used to say the savings and loan industry was always on the attack and 
the banking industry was always on the defense. The banking industry never went 
to Congress for anything they wanted to do; they always went there trying to 
protect their turf. The savings and loan was always trying to expand. I know in 
my own experience that the savings and loan industry is far more political than 
the banking industry. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Regulators have adopted rules to curtail some of the freedoms that resulted 
from deregulation. Will there be more attempts to cut back on the powers 
granted banks and S&amp;Ls to make a wide array of investments with depositor 
funds? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think they're going to have a bit more restrictions. I think we're going 
to go through a period where the introduction of new products or new services, 
which has become a normal event, is going to be very closely scrutinized by 
regulators. We can see that developing. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Accounting methods seem to be cropping up more often as an issue at seized 
institutions. Why? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think the operators of those institutions were taking advantage of all the 
loopholes that regulators provided them. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board has a 
Mickey Mouse accounting setup that, in my opinion, was designed to allow a 
savings and loan to present a better financial picture than what it really had. 
And I think the seized S&amp;Ls took advantage of the rules. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What would you have done differently in the last few years to get the 
S&amp;Ls out of the mess they're in? 
</P>
<P>
A. I would have restricted, severely, their entry into non-traditional areas of 
lending and investing. They were totally unequipped to deal in that area. You 
can't tell me a savings and loan guy was equipped to go to Texas and operate a 
cattle ranch or whatever else they got themselves involved in. That's an area 
that should have been severely restricted, and I would have done that, if I'd 
had my say. That goes for banks too, by the way. 
</P>
<P>
The other thing is that at one time, the savings and loan was a very 
well-capitalized industry. I would have certainly insisted on maintaining 
reasonable capital requirements. A number of savings and loans got hurt in the 
early '80s when the interest rates went against them because they had booked a 
lot of long-term, fixed-rate loans at low rates while rates on deposits soared. 
That again was somebody really not paying attention to what was taking place in 
the financial area. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Some banks and S&amp;Ls -- Lincoln Savings is the most recent example -- 
have been raising capital through corporate debt. Is publicity over the bond 
problems at Lincoln going to create problems for the other institutions in 
raising capital this way? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes, it is. We've gone through that in the banking business in prior years. 
Fact is, the first time we tried to sell holding company notes through Bank of 
America, the SEC began restricting them. Then in the 1960s, we had a little 
experience with Beverly Hills Bancorp. They sold notes and then bellied up, 
failed. And of course the noteholders wound up yelling bloody murder about the 
fact that they thought they were getting insured deals because they had bought 
them at Beverly Hills National Bank. The controller's office really started 
getting concerned. Then on top of that, the FDIC wound up having to cover 
certificates of deposits that were sold off book by a New York bank. So the 
banking authorities have been very tough on allowing the distribution of notes 
over the counter to bank customers. Now we can look and say the savings and 
loan industry was quite a few paces behind the banking industry, but it seems 
like FSLIC and the others should have learned a lesson. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Have any bank or S&amp;L holding companies withdrawn or held off plans to 
raise capital through debt because of Lincoln? 
</P>
<P>
A. I don't think so. We do know that some pretty good-size institutions are 
thinking of debt as a means of bringing in capital. There are institutions now 
that are looking at debt as a meaningful capital-raising avenue. It's proper if 
used right. Of course, the Federal Reserve Board has said recently they don't 
want too much debt in relationship to the capital adequacy. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What would you do in the future to prevent failures of banks and S&amp;Ls? 
</P>
<P>
A I think there are several things that need to be done. First of all, we have 
to have better informed directors for management. It starts there. Good banks 
start with good directors. What do I mean when a say a good director? It's a 
properly informed director who carries out his responsibilities in a prudent 
and proper way. If you do that, then there's little chance that a bank will 
ever get in trouble. And the same thing would apply to savings and loans. I 
believe there are good indications now that we are getting a more 
conscientious, better quality director. And good directors hire good 
management. We've said a number of times that in our experience a board of 
directors will never hire a management beyond the quality and capacity of the 
board of directors. A weak board will hire weak management. A self-dealing 
board will hire management that will accommodate them. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What else would you do? 
</P>
<P>
A. The monitoring can be improved. We criticize the banking regulators 
regularly on the basis that their examiners can't smell anything. In the old 
days, the bank examiners could sense when things weren't right, and you didn't 
have to point things out to them. They would find them. The examiners today 
can't smell anything, and things have to be pointed out to them. Then, when 
things are finally pointed out to them, they have that herding instinct. They 
jump on it full bore and they overkill sometimes. So we don't have as good 
examiners. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Why is that? 
</P>
<P>
A. It's primarily because they're being trained in a technical sense and not in 
the judgmental aspects. We suggested to the FDIC several years ago that they 
should hire retired bankers who have been on the firing line and could go in 
and know whether a loan is going to be collected or not. Get somebody in there 
who knows whether you're going to get it back, how much you're going to get 
back, what you have to do to get it back and when you're going to get it back. 
You don't get that with an examination. All you get is whether they technically 
comply with the so-called rules, statutes, regulations and so on. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You say you're seeing better management. Is that because regulators at the 
state and federal level are beginning to scrutinize the applicants more? 
</P>
<P>
A. They're certainly restricted on getting into the business. In our state, 
we've gone through the process of where we're weeding out the weaklings, so 
consequently what is left is the better ones that can survive. And if 
regulators don't create another batch of weaklings, then you're absolutely 
going to have a strengthening. That has taken place. But I think the bankers, 
the new breed of bankers, are much more equipped than the old ones were to deal 
with the competitive factors and the changes that are taking place in the 
banking environment. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you see any bright spots in the banking industry? 
</P>
<P>
A I don't mean to be altogether negative. I look at our independent banks and I 
think they're doing great. They're coming on strong, and we're going to do 
everything we can to help them. They're learning to play the game. Fact is, 
they went up quite a bit last year in terms of their market share, and the 
results of their performance were just outstanding. And it's going to be 
another good quarter. They are shining. I think that's going to continue 
because they are able to target and rifle shoot and move in an area where 
others might be confused and might be muddling along. As I keep telling them, 
for every adversity, there's an opportunity.

JUDGE GIVES KABC THE LAST WORD ON 'TALK RADIO' USING CALL LETTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal court judge has ordered KFI-AM (640) to stop using the slogan "Talk 
Radio" in conjunction with its call letters, ruling that the trademark belongs 
to rival all-talk station KABC-AM (790). 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Richard A. Gadbois suggested in his ruling that KFI may 
have been taking advantage of the proximity of the stations' dial positions and 
that "KFI knowingly took the name 'Talk Radio' to appropriate the fruits of 
KABC's long-term and successful efforts to promote the name 'KABC Talk Radio.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
In enjoining KFI from using the term, Gadbois said: "KABC . . . has spent 17 
years and a lot of money promoting its slogan, and it has achieved very 
significant product identification. KFI has been using its slogan for only a 
few weeks." 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased," said John Rook, KABC program director "The judge 
obviously studied the case and got to the real crux of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
KABC, which filed suit against KFI on April 3, has said it adopted its all-talk 
format in 1960 and in 1972 "invented and adopted the trademark." KFI said the 
term is generic. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at KFI did not interpret Gadbois' ruling as a victory for KABC, 
because it does not prevent them from using the phrase on its own, without the 
call letters. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1988, KFI's identifying slogan was "Talkin' Southern California." In 
March, 1989, it began using "Talk Radio."

REPLACEMENTS AT UCI PLAY RAW, EMOTIONAL MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Replacements have matured to the point where their live shows hardly ever 
collapse into drunken tantrums anymore, but that doesn't mean they have 
outgrown their capacity for chaos. 
</P>
<P>
There were times during their concert Saturday night at UC Irvine's Crawford 
Hall when the rock band from Minneapolis sounded like a loud, formless, 
lurching ball of confusion -- drums thumping stiffly, guitars scraping and 
blaring at cross purposes and singer Paul Westerberg barking with all the 
melodiousness of an overexcited basset hound. 
</P>
<P>
But when the Replacements harnessed their sound and locked into a rough 
coherence, they showed why they are one of the best rock bands of the 1980s, a 
group whose raw, unfettered and uncalculatingly emotional music stands as a 
denial of all the slick contrivance that tries to pass itself off these days as 
rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
It was the harnessed -- well, the loosely harnessed -- Replacements who 
predominated this time out, making for a show that was powerful and bracing, 
despite its chaotic stretches. 
</P>
<P>
One might wish that the Replacements could translate to the stage the more 
honed and disciplined version of themselves that has come across in the 
unbroken string of fine records they have released in the last 5 years. But 
maybe that sort of maturity would diminish the blast of passion that came 
through much of the time at Crawford Hall (a fancily named basketball gym with 
built-in stage). If that is the trade-off to be made, it's best that the 
Replacements remain the unruly, obstinate rock Holden Caulfields that they are. 
</P>
<P>
Hitting the stage in an expansive mood, the Replacements pounded hard early on, 
peaking with a ferocious version of "Anywhere's Better Than Here," one of eight 
songs they played from their most recent album, "Don't Tell a Soul." 
</P>
<P>
While the album finds the Replacements delving into more tempered, atmospheric 
rock than in the past, many of the new songs came across live as brash 
power-rockers. It was as if the Replacements wanted to show their fans that 
they aren't losing their edge. They proved their point with a mostly thunderous 
show played at screaming volume. 
</P>
<P>
"Anywhere's Better" was among the best of the blazing numbers. Bassist Tommy 
Stinson started the song by ripping off his bow tie and emitting a 
bloodcurdling cry. Watching Stinson sing backing vocals -- his eyes wild, his 
uplifted face straining toward the microphone -- was more interesting than 
watching the lead singer of most other bands. 
</P>
<P>
Westerberg is just as intriguing. He is a scrawny, intense front man with a 
balky voice that rasps and frays and cracks in ways that would signal blatant 
ineptitude in most singers. Instead, Westerberg's technical lapses conveyed a 
rush of naked feeling too urgent to observe such musical niceties as pitch 
control. 
</P>
<P>
It's a shame that Westerberg remains self-conscious about singing the pretty, 
introspective ballads that grace Replacements albums -- which could add variety 
and intimacy to their shows. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll bring it down and do a couple of quiet ones we're sure you're dying to 
hear," he told the audience at one point. "Like it or not, (expletive deleted), 
we're going to play it." 
</P>
<P>
But when the first of the promised quiet songs, "Nightclub Jitters," turned up 
flat (too kind a word, really, for an utterly oafish display), Westerberg cut 
the number short by buzzing a Bronx cheer into his microphone, and the 
Replacements went back to the rockers. 
</P>
<P>
"Asking Me Lies," a failed attempt to sound funky, and the humorous but slight 
"Waitress in the Sky" made for some flatness in the middle of the 90-minute 
show. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the 26 songs the Replacements played, including a couple of obscure 
cover tunes, were top-notch material. Setting aside their old habit of building 
a set haphazardly, they seemed to have given thought to their song sequencing. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ledge," a stormy, harrowing song about suicide, gave way to "Darlin' One," 
a comforting, soaring valediction. The main body of the show ended with 
"Unsatisfied" and "We'll Inherit the Earth," two forceful, emotionally complex 
expressions of youthful anguish and alienation. 
</P>
<P>
Capping the two excellent encores were "Alex Chilton" and "Left of the Dial," 
anthems celebrating the spirit of rock music that puts the dictates of honesty 
and passion before the demands of mass popularity. 
</P>
<P>
At their best, when they were playing with focus as well as force, the 
Replacements were a proud embodiment of those values. With lapsed leaders like 
the Who and the Rolling Stones preparing to debase themselves with stadium 
gravy runs, it's good to have somebody to remind us what true rock values are. 
</P>
<P>
As for the opening band, an obscure group called Jack Newman and the Lemmings, 
the charitable thing would be to say that they are not yet ready for prominent 
exposure. Those who had to sit through their set of wooden, obnoxiously sung, 
thrash-metal-and-garage rock may well have been less charitably inclined and 
conceived a hearty wish for the Lemmings to find a cliff and let nature take 
its course.

CONTROVERSY OVER 'DEADHEADS'; 
</P>
<P>
MOST ARRESTED AT GRATEFUL DEAD CONCERTS WERE FROM SOUTHLAND, IRVINE POLICE SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Most of those arrested in and around the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre during the 
Grateful Dead concerts April 28-30 were Southern California residents, 
according to information released by Irvine police. 
</P>
<P>
The question had been raised whether the trouble was caused by "Deadheads," the 
name given to fans who follow the rock band from city to city, or by locals. 
Tom Evans of Mendocino, a longtime Dead follower, argued after a series of 
arrests outside the amphitheater Saturday night that "the band never has any 
trouble until it gets to Southern California, and then the yuppie kids in 
places like Orange County start acting up, and everybody blames it on the 
Deadheads." Evans had not been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Of 91 arrested, 26 were from Los Angeles; 19 from Orange County; 9 from San 
Diego County; 6 from Ventura County; 5 from Riverside County and 2 from San 
Bernardino County, making a total of 74% of those arrested from Southern 
California. Of the others, 10 were from the Bay Area and elsewhere in Northern 
California, 12 came from out of state and two were transients. 
</P>
<P>
Charges stemmed from alleged narcotics violations and from alleged assaults and 
other charges relating to disturbances Saturday night when about 100 people 
without tickets sat down in the middle of Irvine Center Drive and refused to 
disburse. 
</P>
<P>
The 74% of those arrested from Southern California was a little lower than 
average, according to Dennis McNally, publicist for the Grateful Dead. "About 
90% of those who get arrested tend to be local people attracted to our little 
circus," McNally said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Deadheads usually get their tickets by mail through the group's network, and 
rarely are shut out of concerts, McNally said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the concert, several city officials said they hoped the Dead would not 
come to Irvine, and added that they hope the group will not return. Irvine 
Meadows promoters are expected to meet with city officials to discuss the 
matter this week. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Ryan, 34, of Costa Mesa, who said he has been going to Dead concerts for 20 
years and has seen every concert at Irvine Meadows, said: "I feel like I'm 
caught in the middle between grandstanding politicians and kids who really 
don't care about the music."

Accused Night Stalker Richard Ramirez, who has made several courtroom

parasites." 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez's outburst occurred as he was led away by bailiffs to a lockup area 
next to the court where his trial is taking place. As the accused serial killer 
was led past a section of the court set aside for reporters and camera crews, 
he turned to them, growled and yelling at the top of his lungs, said: "Media. 
Sensation-seeking parasites." 
</P>
<P>
He was led away with no further incident.

Seismologists at Caltech said the temblor, which was centered under the 
Hacienda Heights area, measured 2.9 on the Richter scale. They said this 
morning's shock was unrelated to the twin quakes in October, 1987, that 
devastated nearby Whittier or to two moderate temblors last weekend that jolted 
the Brea and Oceanside areas.

Los Angeles police have arrested six teen-agers in the Friday night murder in 
Sun Valley of a man who was beaten and shot to death after a dispute at a 
party, detectives said today. 
</P>
<P>
Police on Saturday and Sunday arrested Hector Hernandez, 18, of Sun Valley and 
Efren Alavarez, 19, of North Hollywood and four juveniles from the same areas, 
Detective Mike Coffey said. Two of the youths are 14, one is 13 and the other 
15, he said. 
</P>
<P>
All six were being held on suspicion of murder in the death of Thomas Francis 
Langton, 18, of Tujunga. Police said Langton had gone to an open party in the 
7500 block of Cartwright Avenue when he was chased and then attacked by the 
teen-agers, who were also at the party but did not know him. 
</P>
<P>
Coffey said Langton was attacked after he had a "minor verbal exchange" with 
one of the suspects at the party.

A mild earthquake early this morning was more of an annoyance than anything 
else to northern Orange County and Los Angeles County residents who were 
awakened at 5:44 a.m. by the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Orange nor Los Angeles County public safety officials reported any 
damage or injury from the quake, which seismologists at Caltech said registered 
a 2.9 in magnitude. It was centered beneath the Hacienda Heights area in Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists said the shock was unrelated to the twin quakes in October, 
1987, which devastated nearby Whittier. Two other quakes shook the area over 
the weekend. A quake measuring 3.7 struck one mile northwest of Brea Saturday 
night, and seismologists reported a magnitude 3.4 quake centered 27 miles 
offshore from Oceanside on Friday.

Two Navy F/A-18 fighter jets crashed in the Mojave Desert after apparently 
colliding today and at least one of the two pilots parachuted to safety, 
defense officials said. There was no immediate word on the fate of the other 
pilot. 
</P>

The single-seat, twin-engine jets were based at Point Mugu Naval Air Station, 
according to Loretta King, a spokeswoman at the China Lake, Calif., naval 
weapons test center. The planes, assigned to a Navy squadron that tests and 
evaluates missiles and other weapons, were flying in an area used for such 
testing when the incident occurred shortly before noon.

Letts's auto struck the girl about 1:20 a.m. Sunday when she ran into the 
street as she and family members were getting out of a car, police said. They 
said that when Letts got out of his car to check the girl's condition, the 
girl's father, Kalanda Brooker, 28, a friend of Brooker's and at least one 
neighbor attacked Letts. 
</P>
<P>
When police arrived, Letts was still on the ground with one of his assailants

The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee said today that recent data

to about $75 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.) said the estimated cost may have risen by about $17 
billion over the last two years, and he urged Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to 
declassify as much information as possible on the program to build 
radar-evading bombers. 
</P>
<P>
"A straightforward accounting of the B-2's cost, schedule, capabilities and 
management would contribute to the program's creditability and accountability," 
Aspin said in a two-page letter to Cheney.

Borden Inc., the world's largest dairy company, said it pulled its products

a toxic substance from contaminated feed.

Borden spokeswoman Chris Tilton said it was not known if any of the 
contaminated products had been purchased, adding, "There should be no ill 
effects if the products have already been consumed." 
</P>

Borden pulled ice cream, milk, and other liquid dairy products from stores 
throughout Mississippi and in the northern two-thirds of Louisiana, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Cattle feed contaminated with barium carbonate apparently was used at 32 
dairies in the two-state area; the dairies' products were distributed in those 
two regions, she said.

<P>
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich.-Amway Corp. still hasn't decided if it will pursue 
acquisition of its larger rival in the direct sales business, Avon Products 
Inc., one of Amway's founders said today. 
</P>
<P>
Amway, a large direct seller of personal and home products, has purchased more 
than 10% of Avon common stock in the last month, in partnership with a 
Minneapolis-based investor, Irwin L. Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Van Andel, co-founder of Amway, based in Ada, Mich., told the Grand Rapids 
Economic Club today that an acquisition would have to benefit both companies. 
</P>
<P>
He compared Amway's position to that of a diver who walks out on the diving 
board "and has to decide whether to make a swan dive . . . or a belly flop. We 
haven't made that decision yet. We're still on the board looking around. 
</P>
<P>
"If we were to decide to make the plunge . . . the plunge would have to be good 
for Amway as a company and Avon as a company," Van Andel said.

New York Yankees' teammates Rickey Henderson and Mel Hall brawled in the 
training room at Comiskey Park on Saturday, according to a published report 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson and Hall were joking before the Yankees' game against the Chicago 
White Sox when the incident escalated into a brawl that had to be broken up by 
Manager Dallas Green and other players, the New York Daily News reported in 
today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
Green rushed in from the manager's office at the other end of the clubhouse to 
help stop the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"You get that a lot in a clubhouse," Green said. "It doesn't bother me as long 
as it's not serious. It's all forgotten today." 
</P>
<P>
The outfielders are reportedly good friends. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Henderson hit a game-winning three-run homer as the Yankees beat 
Chicago 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Hall, on the disabled list with a strained hamstring, nor Henderson 
would discuss the incident. Before Sunday's 6-2 loss to the White Sox, both 
were talking as if nothing had happened. 
</P>
<P>
"Something like that starts out as fun," Green said. "They're fooling around, 
and then it gets more serious as it goes along."

The Chicago Blackhawks and the Calgary Flames were fined $10,000 each by the 
NHL today for an on-ice brawl at the conclusion of their Stanley Cup playoff 
game in Chicago on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The brawl, which lasted about 10 minutes, involved the players still on the ice 
as the buzzer sounded to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
Under stiffer league rules introduced last year, teams could be fined $25,000 
for engaging in a bench-clearing brawl, but in announcing the fine, NHL 
President John Ziegler noted that "at no time during the altercation did 
players leave the bench to become involved." 
</P>
<P>
The incident started when Denis Savard of the Blackhawks and Calgary's Joel 
Otto raised their sticks as the game ended. That prompted other players to move 
in, including Chicago goaltender Alain Chevrier, who tackled Otto.

Ivan Lendl routed unseeded Jaime Yzaga of Peru 6-2, 6-1 today to win his third 
Tournament of Champions tennis title. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl beat Yzaga in 70 minutes on another cold, windy day at the West Side 
Tennis Club. The world's top-ranked player swept through five matches at the 
tournament without losing a set. 
</P>
<P>
It was Lendl's fourth title of the year. His other victories came at the 
Australian Open, Scottsdale and Key Biscayne. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl earned $82,450, and Yzaga received $41,255. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, who wore sweat pants during the match because of the chilly weather, 
broke Yzaga in the opening game at love and went on to win the first set in 34 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I was able to overpower him today," said Lendl, whose only problems today came 
from the unseasonably cold weather and very strong winds at Forest Hills that 
tended to keep the ball in the air longer than usual. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, who was not happy with his clay court game after his opener here, 
improved with each match and leaves Forest Hills satisfied that he will be 
ready for the French Open beginning May 29. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I've ever been in better shape (this early in May)," Lendl said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Points Squandered 
</P>
<P>
After Lendl opened the second set with another service break, Yzaga had a 
chance to even the set. But he squandered three break points in the next game 
by netting easy forehands and showed his frustration by slamming his racket to 
the ground several times. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl also won the Tournament of Champions in 1982 and 1985. He is 3-0 against 
Yzaga, who is ranked 56th in the world. 
</P>
<P>
In Hamburg, West Germany, Sergio Bruguera of Spain upset Monte Carlo champion 
Alberto Mancini of Argentina 5-7, 6-2, 7-5 today in the first round of the 
German Open men's tennis tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Another Spaniard, Tomas Carbonell, ousted 12th-seeded Darren Cahill of 
Australia 6-3, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Mancini, playing his third tournament in as many weeks, was ousted by another 
clay-court specialist as Bruguera overcame the loss of the first set to 
eliminate the favored Argentine in 2 hours and 3 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know my opponent at all, and I was very surprised by his strong 
game," the 19-year Argentine said after his loss. "I really had problems with 
his forehand. The only good thing is that now I'll have a week to rest before 
the Italian Open." 
</P>
<P>
Bruguera, 18, who is playing only his fourth Grand Prix tournament, said he 
still could not believe he won. "I just tried to concentrate, that was all." 
</P>
<P>
Organizers also announced that Miloslav Mecir of Czechoslovakia had withdrawn 
from the tournament because of a persistent back injury. He was replaced in the 
draw by Pablo Arraya of Peru. 
</P>
<P>
Boris Becker, the second seed in the $692,500 Nabisco Grand Prix event, and 
Lendl, the top seed, received first-round byes. 
</P>
<P>
In Rome, Petra Langrova of Czechoslovakia upset ninth-seeded Nicole Provis of 
Australia 6-7 (5-7), 6-3, 6-0 today in the first round of the $300,000 Italian 
Open women's tennis championships.
