The president of Alcorn State University finally got the kind of R.S.V.P. that 
he wanted. Walter Washington has asked every U.S. President since Lyndon B. 
Johnson to speak at commencement at the primarily black college in Mississippi. 
President Bush is the first to accept. He will speak on Saturday. Alcorn State, 
which with 2,757 students is one of the smallest of Mississippi's eight public 
universities, is located in the rural hills of southwestern Mississippi, seven 
miles west of Lorman -- an unincorporated hamlet consisting of a post office, 
two service stations, a general store and a few houses. "Roots" author Alex 
Haley attended Alcorn. Bush also will travel Saturday to Mississippi State 
University in Starkville to give another graduation speech. The predominantly 
white school has about 12,000 students.

 -- One of the reigning stars of rock 'n' roll met with a reigning monarch. 
British singer Sting led a delegation in a session with Spain's King Juan 
Carlos I and Queen Sofia as part of his campaign to create a nature reserve in 
the Amazon River basin. The group, which includes Brazilian Indian chief Raoni 
and Sioux tribal leader Red Crow, is midway through a 14-nation tour. Sting 
told a Spanish television network that a nature reserve would be a first step 
to curb the destruction of the rain forest.

 -- Clara Hale, an 84-year-old New York City woman who cares for children born 
to drug addicts and AIDS patients, traveled halfway across the country to 
receive the 16th annual Truman Award for Public Service, named for former 
President Harry S. Truman. Independence, Mo., Mayor Barbara Potts, who 
presented the award on the steps of the Truman Library, noted that Hale "did 
not wait for a government program" to give babies a second chance. "God put us 
here with brains to think and do, and we're here to help one another," Hale 
said. Hale House was born in 1969 when Hale discovered a child in the arms of 
an addict on a New York street corner. Since then, she and her daughter, 
Lorraine E. Hale, have helped raise more than 600 infants in the nonprofit 
residential program, operating in a Harlem brownstone. Hale's efforts became 
widely known after then-President Ronald Reagan praised her as an example of 
volunteerism. SHIRLEY MARLOW

Officials of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and the Museum of the

collection of American Indian artifacts to the Smithsonian. The museum 
agreement capped years of often-acrimonious negotiations among federal, state 
and local politicians, officials of the Smithsonian and the Indian museum, and 
American Indians. Besides the building of the National Museum of the American 
Indian in Washington, the agreement also calls for moving the existing Indian 
museum to larger quarters in the old U.S. Custom House in Manhattan, where part

MISGUIDED REFORM EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Proposition 13, the 1978 initiative measure promoted by Howard Jarvis and Paul 
Gann, launched the taxpayer revolt in California with an exceedingly complex 
and far-reaching tax law, only part of which dealt with rolling back and 
limiting the property tax. There are significant portions of Proposition 13 
that need to be corrected, while maintaining a reasonable limit on homeowner 
levies. But another blunderbuss voter initiative measure is not the way to fix 
the defects of Proposition 13 or to provide needed tax reform in California. 
</P>
<P>
Such an initiative is being drafted by Voter Revolt of Los Angeles, the 
organization that sponsored Proposition 103, the auto insurance measure 
narrowly approved by voters in 1988. It would create a split property roll in 
California, allowing businesses to be taxed at a higher rate than the 1% now 
applied to both commercial property and homes. The business rate would be 
raised to 2.2%, and business assessments could grow at a faster rate than those 
of homes. The basic homeowners' rate would remain at 1%. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would raise $9.4 billion a year, Voter Revolt officials said. 
About half of that would be earmarked for "California life style" programs such 
as housing and to generate additional revenue for local government. The other 
half would finance an increase in the homeowners' property-tax exemption and 
renter tax credits. The higher exemption would result in a $500 property-tax 
cut each year on houses valued at less than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these goals are worthy ones. There is a need for more moderate and 
low-cost housing in California. Local government is desperate for more revenue. 
There is a substantial argument in behalf of a split-roll property tax on the 
basis of equity, including evidence that business has received proportionately 
more tax relief from Proposition 13 than homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
But an initiative measure, where voters have only the choice of yes or no, is 
not the proper way to write complicated tax law. Modern initiative campaigns in 
California do not provide for a serious discussion of such complex issues. Nor 
is this the way to allocate and earmark massive amounts of tax revenue. And the 
Voter Revolt measure apparently would not correct one of the biggest flaws in 
Proposition 13, the growing disparity in property taxes levied against homes 
remaining in ownership since 1978 and homes that have sold more recently. 
</P>
<P>
Since Proposition 13 is part of the state Constitution, it can only be amended 
by a vote of the people. The preferred manner of doing this is approval of a 
proposed amendment by two-thirds of the members of the state Assembly and 
Senate, a process that provides for extended debate, technical examination and 
development of consensus through negotiation and compromise. 
</P>
<P>
California voters, of course, would find it difficult to resist the allure of 
cutting their own taxes again through an initiative, and some might enjoy 
socking it to business. But whenever such an initiative petition begins to 
circulate, they should think carefully about the unexplored implications of 
such a drastic plan and respectfully decline to sign it.

SCHOOL PLAY

Everyday we hear and read of the failures of our schools. I have just witnessed 
a dramatic success. At an inner-city school -- Hobart Elementary -- I saw a 
remarkable performance of "Twelve Angry People." The students almost all have 
accents, Spanish, various Asian languages, but they understand and convey the 
meaning of the speeches. 
</P>
<P>
A gifted and dedicated young teacher, Rafe Esquith, each year produces 
remarkable plays. The audience is as mixed as the performers. I don't know any 
of the students at the school, but I go to the performances each year for the 
pure joy of seeing students excel. How do we lure more dedicated young men and 
women into the teaching profession?

S&amp;L MESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his column ("To Find the S&amp;L Billions, Check Wall Street," Op-Ed Page, 
April 28), Martin Mayer tries to blame Wall Street for the savings and loan 
mess, and foolishly suggests that if we look hard enough, we'll find the "lost" 
$100 billion locked away within the coffers of the big brokerage houses. Mayer 
says that the financial markets stripped the money from the S&amp;Ls by 
collecting fees for various services rendered, securities sold and advice 
given. 
</P>
<P>
In his zeal to convict Wall Street, Mayer seems to have overlooked one salient 
fact; selling investments and advice is what Wall Street is supposed to do! 
Just because some S&amp;L managers were too inept or crooked to manage certain 
investments doesn't mean the investments themselves are bad. 
</P>
<P>
Finding most of the missing cash is easy; it has disappeared in the form of 
lower values placed on dry oil wells or foreclosed pieces of real estate. What 
Mayer failed to discover were the massive footprints of the main culprit, 
Congress. Led by House Speaker Jim Wright, Congress has protected the crooked 
S&amp;Ls from federal regulators for more than four years. The head of the 
FSLIC has stated that the crisis could have been contained for less than $15 
billion in 1984, but that Wright and others deliberately blocked several bills 
that would have done so, in order to protect some S&amp;L operators and their 
developer allies, who just happened to contribute to their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Most S&amp;Ls are run honestly, and most investment vehicles are legitimate, 
but they must be regulated by officials who are allowed to enforce the rules. 
In the end we are all to blame for electing a Congress that is only interested 
in getting reelected.

SABOTAGING CAP TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the 1988-1989 school year wanes and many of us teachers weary of holding 
summer-bound students in their seats, here are a few thoughts concerning the 
California Assessment Program. 
</P>
<P>
You published the high school senior CAP scores in reading and math (Metro, 
April 26). A subsequent article about a group of Torrance High School seniors 
who "sabotaged" the CAP test and caused the school scores to plunge was not 
surprising (April 27). The CAP test, alone among the "required" tests, demands 
a degree of motivation and cooperation toward a common goal that is not 
fostered in the routine of schooling. 
</P>
<P>
Other tests give explicit messages to the student. The Basic Competency Exam 
has consequences; pass or you will not graduate. The California Test of Basic 
Skills has visibility; the results appear on your permanent record card. The 
PSAT and the SAT have perquisites; get a good score and you may qualify for a 
scholarship and/or get into a good college. 
</P>
<P>
The CAP test, on the other hand, is not an individual achievement test but a 
group test. Students are not measured against their peers on a test that all 
take similarly, but instead several versions of a test are handed out randomly, 
and students are told to work hard, do well, so that the school will benefit. 
</P>
<P>
This is a laudable goal, I believe, but if students are to believe it, then 
where in the four previous years of high school have they been enjoined to 
perform academically for the "honor" of the school? Of course there are 
academic competitions between schools -- speech and debate tournaments, music 
competitions, academic Olympiads, etc. -- but where else in their schooling are 
they asked, as a group, to do pencil and paper work in order to uphold the 
reputation of the school (as in the Torrance case) or to improve the reputation 
of the school (as in the case in the school in which I teach)? 
</P>
<P>
If we are going to ask American students to subordinate individual goals to the 
welfare of the group on a group test, then we are going to have to teach 
against a very stubborn grain indeed, the notion of individual reward. 
</P>
<P>
The Torrance students are reflecting an awareness of a testing enterprise that 
not only fails to reward them but contains implicit values that are not taught 
or practiced for the most part in academic settings. They sent a negative 
signal of a group potential that education and perhaps American society has 
missed.

IF WE REALLY WANT TO COME UP AS WINNERS, WE'D BEGIN TO CURB OUR LOTTERY FEVER 
</P>

government policy.

<TEXT>
<P>
With the national media feeding the frenzy, people flew in from all over 
America to gamble on Pennsylvania's $115-million record-setting jackpot, the 
biggest since Illinois set its $69-million record 12 days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be rich tomorrow," a postal worker tells a reporter after standing in 
line three hours to buy her tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the long, snaking queues and 500 ticket-per-second sales have to say 
about our national condition, it isn't good. Lotteries, once the peculiar 
blight of impoverished Third World countries, are mushrooming across 28 states 
-- even as the U.S. savings rate sinks to the lowest in the industrialized 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Why this lottery craze, now? Sheer materialism, fed by media hype? Lack of 
individual or national purpose? Erosion of the work ethic? There's no one 
answer. But players for the Pennsylvania jackpot did repeatedly tell 
interviewers they'd use the loot, if they won, for a house. Until the 1970s, 
the American dream -- and practice -- was to work hard, save weekly, then make 
the down payment on your own home. Now peoples' hopes get boiled down to 
million-to-one odds. Perhaps our national standard of living is plummeting 
faster than we realize. 
</P>
<P>
States used to treat gambling as a faintly tainted activity, at best. No 
longer. Now it's the states' silver bullet, a substitute for politically 
dangerous taxes. States are hooked, like their gambling citizens. A decade ago, 
less than $2 billion worth of lottery tickets were sold nationwide; states 
netted $730 million. But last year, Americans bought more than $15 billion 
worth of lottery tickets. Net revenue soared to $5.8 billion. New Jersey and 
California may soon net $1 billion each. 
</P>
<P>
So the money is getting deadly serious. And the lottery rash keeps spreading. A 
last bastion, the South, is now crumbling. Florida and Virginia recently 
succumbed; Louisiana and Georgia are teetering. 
</P>
<P>
Lotteries have become a huge, regressive, debilitating tax -- especially on 
lower-income people. Statewide sales of more than $100 per adult per year are 
commonplace, meaning that hundreds of thousands of individuals are spending 
more than $1,000 on the tickets. A study in New Jersey found that more than 
one-third of families that live in poverty at under $10,000 a year spend 
one-fifth of their income on lotteries. 
</P>
<P>
If lotteries were a harmless form of entertainment, who could oppose them? But 
they can become an addiction. "We're building a nation of gamblers," says 
Arnold Wexler, executive director of New Jersey's Council on Compulsive 
Gambling. Buying a state lottery ticket is many people's first brush with 
gambling -- a potentially "devastating illness that takes away your whole 
life," says Wexler, a compulsive gambler who kicked the habit 21 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Lottery-driven gambling might indeed become the national addiction of the '90s, 
as serious as alcohol, drug abuse and cigarette smoking. 
</P>
<P>
So what do we do other than turn the wheel of history back to 1964 when New 
Hampshire unleashed the first state lottery of the 20th Century? 
</P>
<P>
A huge scandal, like the corruption that killed Louisiana's lottery in 1894, 
might dampen, even kill off today's craze. Short of that, seven stopgap steps 
come to mind: 
</P>
<P>
First, curb the outrageous $400-million-a-year lottery ad campaigns that states 
finance and countenance. A billboard in a Chicago ghetto reads: "This could be 
your ticket out." A New York TV ad, cited by the Citizens League in Minnesota, 
showed a mother telling her daughter that she should stop striving for a 
scholarship because Mom's buying lottery tickets. An Illinois ad showed a man 
scoffing at people investing in savings bonds, saying that he's investing in 
the lottery and that it's the only way he'll be a millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
Lottery ads should be banned. The media hypes the games enough -- for free. 
Short of that, state-sponsored ads should conform to some minimal standards of 
truth telling, noting the odds against winning, and warning that gambling can 
become addictive. 
</P>
<P>
Second, the states ought to print warnings about compulsive gambling directly 
on the tickets (as we now insist for cigarette packaging). 
</P>
<P>
Third, state lotteries should funnel more cash into treatment programs for the 
addicts their own public gambling help create. Reserving a minimal 1% of New 
Jersey's lottery and casino revenues, for example, would create a $8 
million-a-year treatment fund, compared to the measly $275,000 the state spends 
now. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth, cap the size of jackpots. They have a spiraling effect, drawing more 
and more people, siphoning off more and more cash needed for family budgets and 
education and savings. 
</P>
<P>
Fifth, limit the spread of lottery outlets. An example of today's abuse: 
California has started putting mini-lottery terminals in checkout lines of some 
supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
Sixth, stop pretending that education, old folks' programs or state 
economic-development programs really benefit from lottery sales. Lottery 
funding just supplants other necessary state appropriations. It encourages 
people to think that in government, as in gambling itself, you can get what you 
want for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Final suggestion: If you hear anyone seriously propose a national lottery, tell 
him the facts.

A STRONGER SOUTH KOREA CAN NOW STAND ON ITS OWN, SO BRING U.S. TROOPS HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By DOUG BANDOW, Doug Bandow is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and 
formerly served as a special assistant to President Ronald Reagan.

<TEXT>
<P>
As it surmounts each new political crisis, South Korea is demonstrating that 
democracy has firmly taken root. Indeed, the Republic of Korea is proving to be 
a dramatic success for U.S. policy. South Korea, a ravaged, helpless land at 
the end of the war 36 years ago, is today one of the strong men of East Asia. 
Yet as Seoul grows more assertive, strains are increasing between the United 
States and South Korea. Now, therefore, would be a good time to update the 
alliance for a changed world by withdrawing American troops from the Korean 
peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
When the United States initiated the defense treaty that now binds Washington 
to Korea, the South lay in ruins. If Seoul was to be defended, America had to 
play the lead role. Today, however, the Korean balance has shifted 
dramatically. South Korea competes globally in the computer, auto and 
construction markets, and its economy is nearly five times the size of that of 
North Korea. South Korea has twice the population of the North, and Pyongyang 
is on its own militarily; in fact, North Korea's erstwhile ally China is now 
pushing for a peaceful settlement of the peninsula's conflicts. Thus, American 
troops are no longer needed to defend the South. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, an immediate withdrawal of all U.S. forces would leave Seoul 
vulnerable. The North has been investing disproportionately in its armed forces 
for years, though South Korea currently has a number of compensating advantages 
-- a qualitatively superior air force, newer weapons, a defensive posture in 
rugged terrain and better trained soldiers -- and even now could probably 
thwart an invasion from the North. In any case, it will not be long before 
Seoul achieves clear parity with Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
And it will be almost impossible for the North, which suffers from severe 
economic problems that have caused it to default on $800 million in foreign 
loans, to keep up in the future. A 1985 RAND Corp. study estimates that in the 
years ahead North Korea will have to devote 36% to 42% of its gross national 
product to defense, roughly twice the current share, just to match Seoul's 
present expenditure of 6% to 7%. 
</P>
<P>
The South is also gaining ground internationally. The presence of virtually 
every communist nation at the Olympics, an event boycotted by Pyongyang, shows 
the limits of the North's influence even among its putative friends. In fact, 
South Korea is a bigger trading partner of Beijing than is the North, has been 
developing warmer relations with the Soviet Union, and recently established 
official diplomatic relations with Hungary. This contrasts sharply with the 
Korean War, when the Soviet Union equipped North Korea's forces and China 
intervened directly. 
</P>
<P>
Another important change in the East Asian military dynamic is the growing 
influence of Japan, which has surpassed the Soviet Union as the world's 
second-ranking economic power. Japan is increasingly able to not only defend 
its own territory and surrounding seas, but also to directly support future 
South Korean defense efforts, with financial aid, if nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
With a new Administration in Washington, this is an excellent time to to 
reassess America's defense guarantee. The United States should provide South 
Korea with, say, five years in which to build up its own forces, after which 
the defense shield would be eliminated. Washington could sell South Korea, 
which is running a multibillion annual trade surplus, any conventional weapons 
that it wanted; the State Department could also work to smooth relations 
between Seoul and Tokyo, which are still tainted by Korean resentment over 
Japan's colonial rule during the first half of this century. 
</P>
<P>
One benefit of a troop pull-out would be to dismantle a trip-wire that 
threatens to involve this nation in a conflict unrelated to its basic security. 
Disengagement would also save money, so long as the troops were demobilized, 
reducing the disproportionate global military burden borne by the United 
States. Finally, removing American troops from Korea would help insulate 
Washington from Seoul's fractious political struggles. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, disengagement would not be risk-free. But no foreign policy is 
without cost. Today the United States pays a very high price to defend 
populous, prosperous nations around the globe as part of a containment strategy 
developed in a different era. Withdrawing troops from Korea would begin the 
much-needed process of updating U.S. foreign policy for the 1990s and beyond.

T-Bill Rates Drop: The Treasury sold $6.8 billion of new three-month bills at 
an average discount rate of 8.41%, down from 8.64% last week. Another $6.8 
billion in new six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate of 8.39%, 
down from 8.64% last week. The rates were the lowest since Jan. 30, when 
three-month bills sold for 8.33% and six-month bills averaged 8.39%. The new 
discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 8.71% for 
three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,787.40 and 8.88% for a 
six-month bill selling for $9,575.80. The discount rate reflects the price 
discount received when government securities are purchased at less than face 
value.

Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp., under attack from customer lawsuits and negative 
publicity surrounding its credit services sales practices, Monday announced a 
shake-up that will replace the president of the credit services unit. 
</P>
<P>
John P. Kunz, president of Dun &amp; Bradstreet Credit Services, has been 
reassigned to a staff position within the company, effective May 15. 
</P>
<P>
Kunz heads a department that is facing several lawsuits by customers who 
claimed to have been misled into over-purchasing the company's credit data. 
</P>
<P>
In the shake-up, the company said it formed Dun &amp; Bradstreet Business 
Credit Services, a new organizational entity within the Business Information 
Group that will combine five operating units. 
</P>
<P>
Dun &amp; Bradstreet would not comment on whether Kunz's reassignment was 
related to the lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
But with a dominant position in the credit services business, Dun &amp; 
Bradstreet's moves were seen as a way of assuring that the growing controversy 
would not lead to a loss of its leading market share. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts have said that a festering controversy might allow smaller competitors 
such as TRW Inc. the chance to cut into Dun &amp; Bradstreet's towering 60% 
market share. 
</P>
<P>
The new entity will include Dun &amp; Bradstreet Credit Services, D&amp;B 
Receivable Management Services, American Credit Indemnity, D&amp;B Information 
Resources and D&amp;B Information Systems. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Murray will become president of the newly formed entity. The company said 
Murray will continue as president-Americas, Business Information Group and 
senior vice president-customer information needs for Dun &amp; Bradstreet. 
</P>
<P>
Kunz will become a member of the policy staff of the Business Information Group 
and will assist James E. Rutter, executive vice president, in directing the 
company's worldwide marketing strategy.

Sharply lower revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 1989 resulted in a loss 
of $1.9 million for Computer Automation Inc. The company reported a profit of 
$42,000 for the same period a year ago. Revenue for the 3 months ended March 31 
fell 51%, to $2.8 million from $5.8 million. For the 9-month period, Computer 
Automation incurred a loss of $1.2 million, contrasted with a year-earlier 
profit of $743,000. Revenue declined 23%, to $13.4 million from the $17.3 
million of the previous year. George Pratt, chairman and chief executive, said 
that most of the revenue decline was caused by a continuing lag in orders for 
the automatic test equipment manufactured by the company.

VALLEY EARNINGS: CALIFORNIA AMPLIFIER REPORTS 4TH-QUARTER LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California Amplifier, a Camarillo maker of electronic components for microwave 
communications products, reported a fiscal fourth-quarter loss of $404,000, 
compared with a $224,000 loss a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The company said its results are not likely to improve quickly. Manufacturing 
problems, "resulting from the complexity of certain microwave products," led to 
the latest loss, and "operating losses will continue through the second quarter 
of fiscal 1990," California Amplifier said. 
</P>
<P>
The loss in the quarter that ended Feb. 28 came despite a 33% increase in 
sales, to $2.4 million from $1.8 million. For its fiscal year, California 
Amplifier lost $649,000, compared with a profit of $220,000 the previous year. 
Its annual sales rose 21% to $9.1 million from $7.5 million.

VALLEY EARNINGS: UNITED EDUCATION REPORTS LOSSES OF $14.3 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
United Education &amp; Software, an Encino company that ran into trouble last 
year when authorities discovered a series of foul-ups at a United Education 
operation that serviced government-guaranteed student loans, said it lost $14.3 
million in the year that ended Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
The results are in contrast to a profit of $4.4 million earned a year earlier 
by the company, whose main business is operating vocational schools. Revenue in 
the latest fiscal year rose 15% from a year earlier, to $81.1 million, mainly 
because United Education operated more vocational schools and had increased 
enrollment at some of them. 
</P>
<P>
The results for the latest fiscal year included a loss of $8.8 million from the 
discontinued student loan servicing operation and a loss from continuing 
operations of $5.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the loss for the year is a provision for the sale or closing of 
nine vocational schools that were lagging in profits, the company said. United 
Education said it has sold six schools to International Training Corp., a 
private company in Denver, for an undisclosed amount. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a review led by the U.S. Education Department uncovered a series of 
problems in a United Education unit in Costa Mesa that serviced student loans. 
The problems included failure to properly contact thousands of delinquent 
borrowers. United Education blamed the problems on computer errors, although 
student- loan authorities said there was widespread sloppiness in the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
After the foul-ups surfaced, Education Department officials said the government 
would not pay for the bad loans that United Education had serviced. Bank of 
America, trustee for bonds that were sold to raise money to buy student loans, 
has said it and a group of major banks that issued letters of credit backing 
the bonds could lose as much as $650 million. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, nine of the world's largest banks, most of them in Japan, sued Bank 
of America, alleging that it failed to properly oversee United Education's 
work.

JACK SMITH: WELL-VERSED IN OFFERINGS OF LIGHT RHYMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like almost everything else, light verse, I find, is in greater supply than we 
realize. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, in printing a few verses by such masters as Richard Armour, Ogden Nash, 
Dorothy Parker and Samuel Hoffenstein, I have mourned the passing of this 
blithe form. 
</P>
<P>
But there are plenty of versifiers out there, eager to find some ink. Some have 
published, most have not. 
</P>
<P>
Molly C. Rodman recalls that she published some in Judge magazine; then it 
folded. Here's a sample of her work: 
</P>
<P>
 How can I know what you're thinking 
</P>
<P>
 Since your heart is wearing a mask? 
</P>
<P>
 My heart is yours for the asking, 
</P>
<P>
 But dammit -- why don't you ask? 
</P>
<P>
Sherry Lewis of Costa Mesa says she spent the 1930s trying to write light verse 
in the Parker style, but none was ever published. All right, one is now: 
</P>
<P>
 He sent me a lily, 
</P>
<P>
 So white, so pure; 
</P>
<P>
 My heart beat a silly, 
</P>
<P>
 "He's mine, for sure!" 
</P>
<P>
 Until I discovered -- 
</P>
<P>
 And that was the end -- 
</P>
<P>
 He'd chosen red roses 
</P>
<P>
 For my best friend. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Josephus Reynolds of Beverly Hills says he is reminded by my remark that "the 
British are so deucedly civil" of a limerick he wrote on safari in Tanganyika. 
Inspired by the long, thin, sharp horns of the local rhinos, and the typical 
British reserve, he wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 Two hunters from Britain that I know 
</P>
<P>
 Were impaled on the horns of a rhino 
</P>
<P>
 And, although en brochette, 
</P>
<P>
 Had not formally met. 
</P>
<P>
 Did they speak to each other? Oh, my, no! 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Walt Hopmans of Santa Barbara chides me for not printing numerous verses he has 
sent me in the past, and tries again. His shortest: 
</P>
<P>
 Avoid 
</P>
<P>
 Freud 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Joan G. Gabrielson goes for the the purely hysterical in "The Hypochondriac and 
the Doc, no quack:" 
</P>
<P>
 She asked the Doc to diagnose 
</P>
<P>
 Her pains -- from head to toes. 
</P>
<P>
 Unperplexed, he Rx'd: 
</P>
<P>
 "You must cut down on leisure, 
</P>
<P>
 For you've had a Julius Caesar." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gene Riley of Torrance says he has collected his own verses as "Cursory 
Rhymes," striving for timeless themes, short but profound, and pertinent to 
everyone's experience. Here are a few of his: 
</P>
<P>
 Relations save us lots of grief 
</P>
<P>
 When they make their visits brief. 
</P>
<P>
 Adults can't play on a children's slide, 
</P>
<P>
 It makes them look undignified. 
</P>
<P>
 We know that we are growing old, 
</P>
<P>
 When we start doing what we're told. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ed Kysar of Reseda offers a tribute to the genre: 
</P>
<P>
 To Parker, Armour, Nash, et al, 
</P>
<P>
 Homage here, abundant, 
</P>
<P>
 From those who wish to let it all 
</P>
<P>
 Hang out, sans the redundant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Harry Cimring says he published thousands before certain popular magazines 
folded and newspaper columnists turned from potpourri columns to the current 
theme column. Here's one he wrote, after a weekend in Yosemite, before the word 
biodegradable was coined (It was published by Matt Weinstock): 
</P>
<P>
 Swept away by the winds and the rains 
</P>
<P>
 Are the cardboard, paper and other remains; 
</P>
<P>
 But this I note as the scene I scan: 
</P>
<P>
 The indestructibility of the beer can. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Marc Berkov of Culver City titles this one on modern art "Is a Rose Really a 
Rose?": 
</P>
<P>
 If anything goes 
</P>
<P>
 In poetry or prose, 
</P>
<P>
 Even three minutes silence 
</P>
<P>
 Of a musical appliance, 
</P>
<P>
 Or two red dots apart 
</P>
<P>
 Considered to be art -- 
</P>
<P>
 Don't you find it rather funny 
</P>
<P>
 You can't use abstract money? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deborah Parducci of Pacific Palisades wrote this one for friends' 25th wedding 
anniversary: 
</P>
<P>
Ain't it nifty? 
</P>
<P>
 Try for fifty. 
</P>
<P>
 And also this one: 
</P>
<P>
I wish that it were 1930 
</P>
<P>
So many words would still be dirty 
</P>
<P>
 To which I add one of my own: 
</P>
<P>
 As our 50th grows near, 
</P>
<P>
 We shed a tear; 
</P>
<P>
 It's too much trouble, 
</P>
<P>
 To go for double.

Just when you thought you had your workout routine down pat -- from the right 
shoes to the right music -- comes this unnerving caveat: Using headset stereos 
while exercising may be hazardous to your hearing. 
</P>
<P>
So says Richard Navarro, a speech pathologist and audiologist at the University 
of Nevada-Reno who recently evaluated the decibel levels of 51 tape players. 
When the stereos were played at one-third volume, Navarro found the average 
level to be 85 -- a potentially dangerous one, according to hearing experts. At 
two-thirds volume, the level averaged 96 and, at full volume, 108. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro speculates that listening to loud music while working out compounds the 
risk of hearing loss because exercise increases blood flow to the extremities, 
decreases oxygen around the ear and increases the flow of adrenalin, making the 
ear more vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers of headset stereos share Navarro's concerns, according to Bob 
Miller, vice president of merchandising at Radio Shack in Ft. Worth, Tex., 
which sells stereo headsets. "It's probably a very good study," said Miller, 
who noted many companies are trying to educate the public about the possible 
dangers of playing stereo headsets too loudly. 
</P>
<P>
Levels in excess of 85 to 90 decibels can produce temporary hearing impairment, 
said a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Otolaryngology -- Head and Neck 
Surgery in Washington D.C., an organization of ear, nose and throat 
specialists. "Headphone radios often produce sound in excess of 100 decibels, 
which causes reversible damage to the inner ear," said the spokeswoman, noting 
that repeated, long-term exposure to high-decibel levels can lead to 
irreversible damage. 
</P>
<P>
Many personal tape players and radios are not safe, contends Navarro, and 
buying more expensive models may not negate the danger. In his 
university-funded study, the cheaper models tended to be safer because they 
emitted fewer decibels when tuned to the same volume, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Research audiologist Steve Otto of the House Ear Institute in Los Angeles said 
Navarro's measurements sound feasible and are similar to those of his 1985 
study of tiny stereos. 
</P>
<P>
But Larry Royster, a professor of mechanical engineering at North Carolina 
State University, questioned Navarro's findings and methodology. In his 
evaluation of personal stereos, Royster found the average decibel output was 64 
at 25% volume and 81 at 50% volume. "Ninety percent of people using personal 
stereos play them at 83 decibels or lower, and 83 is clearly acceptable," 
Royster said. 
</P>
<P>
How can you determine the safety of your personal stereo? Here's the experts' 
advice: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Carefully review accompanying brochures. Most manufacturers include safety 
information provided by the Electronic Industries Assn., a Washington-based 
consumer electronics group. Among the warnings, according to an association 
spokeswoman: "Do not play your headset at high volume. Hearing experts advise 
against continuous extended play. If you experience a ringing in your ears, 
reduce volume or discontinue use." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Contact the manufacturer for more information about a model's decibel 
range. Otto of the House Ear Institute said many audiologists have meters which 
can measure decibels. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Don't turn up the music so much that your heartbeat increases in response 
to the music," Navarro suggested. "When you can just hear the music 
comfortably, leave it at that level," advised Victor Garwood, a USC professor 
emeritus of communication arts and sciences and otolaryngology. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Finally, don't listen more than four hours a day at one-third volume, more 
than an hour at half volume and never above half volume, Navarro advised. And 
be prepared to modulate music when the volume is not entirely under your 
control. "Some of my graduate students now wear earplugs at aerobics class," 
Navarro noted. 
</P>
<P>
Rash Relief 
</P>
<P>
Preventing the itchy, agonizing rash caused by poison oak and ivy may soon be 
easier, thanks to a chemically treated clay that acts as a kind of Scotchguard 
for the skin. 
</P>
<P>
Called organoclay, the compound is currently used as a suspension aid in 
aerosol deodorants and anti-perspirants, said Dr. William L. Epstein, a UC San 
Francisco professor of dermatology who compared organoclay with three other 
preparations commonly used to prevent reactions to poison oak and ivy. 
</P>
<P>
In a study of 28 subjects, the protection provided by organoclay was 
"spectacular," preventing breakouts more than 95% of the time, three times that 
of the other preparations, Epstein said. He speculates the chemicals in 
organoclay may bind better to urushiol -- the main allergen in poison oak and 
ivy, thus reducing the amount absorbed. His study, recently reported in the 
Archives of Dermatology, was funded by the U.S. Forest Service and the clay's 
manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
Though not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration for prevention of 
poison oak and ivy dermatitis, Epstein estimates organoclay may be available 
within a year. "It's not a cure-all," he said, noting it is not meant for those 
with severe allergies. "But it will help people sensitive to garden-variety 
poison oak and ivy." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, old standbys -- such as calamine lotion and antihistamines -- can 
offer some relief, said Dr. Gail Anderson, director of the department of 
emergency medicine at Los Angeles County/USC Medical Center. Taking a cold 
shower immediately after exposure may or may not work, he added.

One juvenile has been accused of setting fires at a high school and junior high 
in Fresno, and investigators are trying to determine whether the arsons were 
gang related. A Roosevelt High School student was booked into Juvenile Hall on 
a charge of setting two fires: one that caused $200,000 damage to that school's 
office and a small fire at Tehipite Middle School's office. His name was not 
released because of his age. Officers indicated that there are additional 
suspects, but there was confusion over how much they feel a gang was 
responsible for the fires. "All the reasons behind the fires are not clear at 
this point," fire inspector John Salveson said. "But we do know the people 
involved are gang members." Police spokesman Ron Hults said detectives do not 
think the fires were set as a gang activity, even though some of those 
responsible may be members of a gang. "This could have been just a wanton act 
of vandalism in the form of an arson," he said.

Hundreds of special police are riding China's railways in a bid to combat a 
dramatic increase in robberies aboard trains this year, many by organized gangs 
who boldly mug passengers and steal freight, an official magazine reported. The 
state-run Beijing Review, an English-language weekly, quoted public security 
and railway officials as reporting 1,800 robberies aboard trains in the first 
three months of 1989, an 89% increase over the same period last year.

The first human tests of a new AIDS vaccine developed by American researchers 
have begun in Britain because U.S. officials are taking too long to approve 
such studies, drug company officials said. Viral Technologies Inc. of 
Washington, a joint venture between CEL-SCI Corp. and Alpha 1 Biomedicals Inc., 
announced that tests of the drug HGP-30 have begun at St. Stephen's Hospital in 
London. In the first part of the study, 24 volunteers not infected with the 
AIDS virus will be given the vaccine to evaluate it for safety, the company 
said.

Three national newspapers in Britain were fined a total of $250,500 for 
contempt of court in publishing excerpts of "Spycatcher," a book by a former 
security agent that details British intelligence operations. Justice Andrew 
Morritt fined the Sunday Times, the Independent and the defunct News on Sunday 
$83,500 each for violating a ban imposed by the government against the Guardian 
and the Observer for publishing excerpts from the book in June, 1986. Morritt 
ruled that the ban applied to all newspapers. However, the House of Lords later 
lifted that ban, and both the Independent and the Sunday Times said they will 
appeal.

U.S. District Judge Dickinson Debevoise ruled in Newark, N.J., that two 
insurance companies must pay for an expensive new anti-cancer procedure for a 
man with a bone marrow malignancy. Nicolae Dozsa, 54, of Jefferson Township, 
N.J., was accepted in December for autologous bone marrow transfer at Johns 
Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. He has been unable to receive the treatment 
because Crum &amp; Forster Organizations, the insurance company for which his 
wife works, refused to cover it, ruling that ABMT is experimental for patients 
with multiple myeloma. Debevoise said that Crum &amp; Forster and Prudential 
Insurance Co. of America, which administers the plan, failed to abide by their 
own policy. The estimated cost of the treatment is $75,000 to $125,000.

A U.S. investigator in Texas said he suspected that the leader of a 
drug-smuggling and satanic cult could have faked his death to fool police into 
ending their hunt for perpetrators of 15 ritual murders near the U.S.-Mexico 
border. But Mexican authorities maintained that Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo had 
been positively identified by his fingerprints and U.S. passport. Cult member 
Alvaro de Leon has said he killed Constanzo and a bodyguard in a Mexico City 
apartment on the leader's orders. But Armando Ramirez, resident agent of the 
Drug Enforcement Administration in Brownsville, said the bodies were too badly 
shot up to be positively identified.

The United Nations says it has moved enough food aid to southern Sudan to 
prevent the deaths of thousands of people who faced starvation because farming 
there has been disrupted by civil war. James Grant, head of the U.N.'s 
Operation Lifeline Sudan, told a news conference in Kenya that 45,000 tons of 
food has been rushed to southern Sudan since March. Another 45,000 tons is 
expected to be moved in before the end of June. Although this is still 30,000 
tons short of the goal, Grant said that "we appear to be in a position to avoid 
any massive deaths."

cleanup law during the Ronald Reagan Administration and missed 65% of the

Ivan Lendl wore sweat pants during the Tournament of Champions final Monday, 
but he hardly broke a sweat. 
</P>
<P>
The world's top-ranked player routed unseeded Jaime Yzaga of Peru, 6-2, 6-1, to 
become the first three-time winner of this clay-court tournament on a chilly, 
windy day at the West Side Tennis Club in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very cold and unpleasant," Lendl said. "I don't enjoy wearing sweat 
pants because it's uncomfortable, but today it was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he liked the conditions any better than I did. I was just able 
to overpower him." 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, who also won this event in 1982 and 1985, swept through five matches 
without losing a set to win his fourth title of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The temperature was in the low 50s and a brisk wind made it feel much colder, 
but Lendl said he has played in worse conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember one time in Czechoslovakia in early May we had to stop because of 
snowflakes," he said. "We were using white balls and you couldn't see them. 
</P>
<P>
"I was moving very well (Monday) and I felt strong. Whatever was happening on 
the court, I felt comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Yzaga, ranked 56th in the world, won a set from Lendl in each of their two 
previous matches. But the 21-year-old Peruvian never posed a serious threat in 
this final, which was delayed a day because of rain earlier in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the No. 1 player in the world and he's tough to beat on every point," 
Yzaga said. "He won't give you any free points, so you have to earn them. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little impatient in the first set. I tried to finish the points too 
fast and that's why I made a lot of mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Lendl broke Yzaga in the opening game at love and went on to win the first set 
in 34 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl earned $82,450, and Yzaga received $41,255. 
</P>
<P>
Guillermo Vilas and Jimmy Arias, two former standouts who are unseeded in this 
event, pulled off upsets in the opening round of the $220,000 U.S. Men's Clay 
Court Championships at Charleston, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
Vilas beat fourth-seeded Dan Goldie, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3, and Jimmy Arias defeated 
eighth-seeded Bruno Oresar of Yugoslavia, 6-1, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
In the day's other match involving a seeded player, No. 6 Jay Berger defeated 
Claudio Panatta of Italy, 6-1, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
"He was steady. He was playing well," Vilas said of Goldie. "He never slowed 
down. I can't say I was lucky, but I had good timing today." 
</P>
<P>
Unseeded Petra Langrova of Czechoslovakia upset ninth-seeded Nicole Provis of 
Austria, 6-7 (7-5), 6-3, 6-0, in the first round of the $300,000 Italian Open 
at Rome. 
</P>
<P>
In other first-round matches, 12th-seeded Barbara Paulus of Austria rallied to 
beat Olga Tsarboupolou of Greece, 4-6, 6-1, 6-1, and 19-year-old Marzia Grossi 
of Italy beat Brenda Schultz of the Netherlands, 6-1, 7-5. Top-seeded Gabriela 
Sabatini had a bye.

SCOTT OSTLER: IT'S JUST ANOTHER IN A VERY LONG LINE OF STERLING IDEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It was with shock and surprise I read last week that Donald Sterling, owner of 
the Clippers, is threatening to move his franchise out of Los Angeles unless 
the city builds him an $85-million arena to replace the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
I had heard rumors that the Clippers were leaving, but I assumed they were 
being chased out of town by the Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it too early to start taking nominations for the 1989 Chutzpah Award?" asks 
George Kiseda, former Times staffer. 
</P>
<P>
Just in case it isn't too early, and it never is, Kiseda (who retired a few 
years ago but forgot to tell his brain) submits two candidates for the coveted 
award: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Congress, which tried to sneak a 50% pay raise past the voters as a reward 
for its splendid record in attacking the deficit, standing up to the gun lobby 
and keeping close watch on the Pentagon, the CIA and the S&amp;L industry." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Donald Sterling, who is demanding a state-of-the-art arena as a reward for 
providing the city with a state-of-the-art basketball team and state-of-the-art 
ownership. Gee, that's like Morton Downey threatening to take his show off TV." 
</P>
<P>
That's a state-of-the-art cheap shot, George. Morton Downey isn't making any 
threats or demands. 
</P>
<P>
Before we go any further, it should be pointed out that chutzpah -- the C is 
silent, and the word sounds like a clearing of the throat -- is not necessarily 
bad stuff. What it is is gall, or brazenness. America was founded on chutzpah. 
Just ask the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
What Sterling is showing us right now, though, is state-of-the-art chutzpah. 
</P>
<P>
Let's examine exactly what it is that Los Angeles is in imminent danger of 
losing to some other lucky Southern California city. 
</P>
<P>
No point in rehashing the entire illustrious history of the Clipper franchise. 
Let's pick it up where Donald Sterling picked it up, eight seasons ago. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the team truly has been one of the league's most consistent. None 
of that schizo, roller-coaster performance that tears at the guts of the loyal 
fans of so many NBA teams. The Clippers have a rock-steady .282 winning 
percentage under the ownership of sterling Don. 
</P>
<P>
In their five seasons in Los Angeles -- yes, this was once the fair city to 
which the Clippers fled to escape economic deprivation -- they are a .276 club. 
</P>
<P>
But what are statistics? Mere numbers. In assessing the team's value to the 
community, it might be more helpful to view the franchise in poetic terms. This 
team, for instance, is known as the Bermuda Triangle of draft lottery picks. 
</P>
<P>
In the last five drafts, the Clippers have had nine first-round picks. What 
have they done with that windfall of incredible talent? This season they won 21 
games, which is six more than the Miami Heat won, and a whopping 15 more than 
the Miami Dolphins won. 
</P>
<P>
In fairness, last year's three-man draft crop was very good, and when Danny 
Manning comes back from his injury, the team could be entertaining. What better 
time for Clippers to desert their loyal fans? 
</P>
<P>
This is a team that has traded Tom Chambers, Terry Cummings and Byron Scott, 
and kept Benoit Benjamin, a center whose transmission has five gears -- first 
through fourth, and salarydrive. 
</P>
<P>
This is also a team that doesn't have a coach, state-of-the-art or otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
In the last eight years, the Clippers have changed presidents, general 
managers, head coaches -- four times, maybe going on five -- complete 
front-office staffs, home cities and even ballboys. Through the years and 
tears, what's the only common thread? 
</P>
<P>
Hint: Donald Sterling. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling says he wouldn't accept the $30-million Sports Arena-remodeling that 
the Coliseum Commission is offering. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless they build an arena that's the highest quality, has the best technology 
and is totally safe, I won't sign a (new) lease," Sterling has said. 
</P>
<P>
This, friends, is the owner of a team that, if artistic merit were the 
criterion, would be playing home games at the Olympic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Still, even sub-dynastic NBA teams are hot property these days, and Sterling 
says he is being hit upon by hoop-hungry Anaheim, Riverside and the San 
Fernando Valley. Like the Statue of Liberty, these communities beseech Sterling 
to give them the wretched refuse of his teeming team. 
</P>
<P>
He really wants to keep his lads in downtown Los Angeles, but doggone, if the 
Coliseum Commission refuses to show its appreciation for all that the Clippers 
have done for this city, Sterling will be forced to move. 
</P>
<P>
And don't insult the man with some skimpy $30-million patch-up plan. 
</P>
<P>
If the Clippers do leave, it won't be without an outpouring of sentiment. There 
might even be a dramatic demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
I can picture the scene on the fateful day of departure, with thousands of L.A. 
fans at the Sports Arena, lying down in back of the moving vans.

<P>
Two-time Olympic gold medalist Edwin Moses, holder of one of track and field's 
most impressive streaks, said Monday he plans to compete through the 1992 
Olympics at Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
Moses, 33, won the 400-meter intermediate hurdles gold medal in the 1976 
Olympics at Montreal and the 1984 Games at Los Angeles. During one stretch, 
from 1978 through 1987, he won more than 100 races without losing. Danny Harris 
finally beat him in 1987 at Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
Moses, of Newport Beach, won the bronze medal in last year's Olympics at Seoul 
finishing behind Andre Phillips of the United States and Amadou Ba of Senegal. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Southern California Track Writers' luncheon Monday, Moses said 
he plans to return to competition this summer and stay with it through 1992, 
when he hopes to win a third gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
Moses said he believes he can run faster than 47 seconds for the race. He set 
the world record of 47.02 in 1983.

John Candelaria's sore right knee was examined, but a decision on the New York 
Yankee left-hander's status will be delayed until today. 
</P>
<P>
"We have only preliminary results at this time," said Syd Thrift, Yankee vice 
president of baseball operations. "The studies are not complete." 
</P>
<P>
Candelaria, 35, had discomfort in his knee in each of his last two starts. He 
pitched five innings Friday night in Chicago before leaving in pain. 
</P>
<P>
Candelaria did not pitch after Aug. 24 last season because of cartilage damage 
in the knee. He underwent arthroscopic surgery on Oct. 13.

North Carolina forward J.R. Reid says he is awaiting a recommendation from 
Coach Dean Smith, but several National Basketball Assn. coaches say they expect 
Reid to bypass his senior year and make an early entrance into the pros. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid's coming out this year," said an NBA official whose team has a draft 
lottery pick told The News and Observer of Raleigh. "If he doesn't, I'll be 
very, very surprised." 
</P>
<P>
NBA coaches and officials can be fined by the league for talking about college 
underclassmen or assessing their pro potential, and many requested anonymity 
when contacted by the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he had conferred with 11 NBA teams about Reid. But he offered no 
further comment on Reid's future.

TEACHER AIDE TO STAND TRIAL IN KILLING OF HUSBAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Vista Municipal Court judge ruled Monday that a popular high school teacher's 
aide must stand trial on charges that she hired a pair of 15-year-old boys to 
slay her estranged husband, promising them two cars and $100,000 to split. 
</P>
<P>
After a six-day preliminary hearing rife with dramatic testimony from teen-age 
witnesses, Judge Suzanne W. Knauf ordered Roberta Pearce, 41, bound over for 
trial on allegations that she hatched the plot to kill Robert (Wayne) Pearce. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old construction foreman was slain outside his Cardiff apartment as 
he left for work Jan. 31. Isaac Hill and Anthony Pilato, both freshmen at 
Orange Glen High School in Escondido, pleaded guilty last month to the slaying, 
saying they were put up to it by the wife. 
</P>
<P>
Although Roberta Pearce has asserted her innocence since she was arrested in 
early February, prosecutors contend that she masterminded the slaying in an 
effort to collect $200,000 in life insurance and keep her Valley Center home in 
the face of the couple's impending divorce. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Face Death Penalty 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Tim Casserly said it is "highly likely" that prosecutors 
will file special-circumstances charges against Pearce before she goes to 
trial, raising the specter that she could face the death penalty if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Pearce's attorney, William Fletcher of Carlsbad, contends that his client 
played no role in the killing, suggesting that angry statements she may have 
made about her husband might have been misconstrued by the teen-agers, 
prompting them to plot a slaying. 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Pearce maintains she did not solicit these individuals to kill her 
husband," Fletcher said after the hearing concluded. "She did not help them to 
carry out this crime. . . . She doesn't have the personality, the stature or 
the demeanor to force those kids to do anything." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Fletcher said, the teen-agers had "a lot to lose if they lost that 
house" and may have "misread her emotions." 
</P>
<P>
"Just because a kid is street-wise doesn't mean they're able to maturely read 
emotions," Fletcher said. "She's angry, she says some things, then they take 
them literally." 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a dark blue sweat shirt and other standard prison garb, Pearce 
appeared unemotional as Knauf announced her ruling. Bound by handcuffs, Pearce 
quietly left the courtroom escorted by a single marshal after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the murder charge, Knauf ordered Pearce to stand trial on charges 
that she initially solicited two other youths to kill her husband but turned to 
Hill and Pilato when the first pair refused to carry out the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also leveled several new charges against Pearce, stemming from 
testimony during the preliminary hearing. They included two counts of providing 
marijuana and crystal methamphetamine to the covey of youngsters who frequented 
the Valley Center house in the weeks before the killing. 
</P>
<P>
The teacher's aide for students with learning disabilities at Orange Glen High 
also is to face a new charge that she had sex with a minor. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, one of the admitted killers, testified during the preliminary hearing 
that he and Pearce made love one night in the weeks before the slaying. 
Fletcher said, however, that he plans to fight the charge, pointing to 
statements Hill made to police after his arrest suggesting that he and Pearce 
were never sexually involved. 
</P>
<P>
Pearce faces arraignment on the felony charges in Vista Superior Court on May 
22, the same day Hill and Pilato are set to be sentenced in San Diego Juvenile 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
Those two provided perhaps the most dramatic moments during the drawn-out 
preliminary hearing. Although their testimony differed on several key details, 
both said they had killed Wayne Pearce at the behest of his estranged wife, 
carrying out the killing with a kitchen knife and hatchet. 
</P>
<P>
Along with a 16-year-old girl who was befriended by Pearce in the weeks before 
the slaying, the two boys said the woman provided them with drugs and alcohol 
while helping to plan the slaying of her husband, who moved out of the Valley 
Center home over the Thanksgiving holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they said that Pearce had maintained a sexual relationship with Frank 
(Soddy) Rodriguez, a 16-year-old Orange Glen student arrested in late April and 
charged with helping plan the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, Fletcher said the teen-age witnesses against Pearce had 
woven tales containing "some pretty major inconsistencies." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said the statements of Hill and Pilato may have been prompted by a 
desire to improve their standing with prison authorities, and that the 
16-year-old girl, who testified that she knew of the murder plot in advance, 
had been given "hip pocket immunity" against being charged by prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Casserly, however, maintained that he had given the girl no immunity, telling 
her that prosecutors in the juvenile division might eventually file charges 
against her.

WEST HOLLYWOOD TO STUDY FORMATION OF POLICE DEPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a surprise move, the West Hollywood City Council has authorized a study to 
determine how much it would cost to establish its own police department. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Paul Brotzman cautioned that the study by the city's 
administrative staff does not mean that West Hollywood is interested in forming 
its own police force. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he and other officials said they expect the study to show that West 
Hollywood's arrangement with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department for 
law enforcement protection is a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
"It's basically a documentation exercise," Brotzman said. "It shouldn't be 
interpreted by the Sheriff's Department or anyone else as a first step in 
establishing a municipal police force." 
</P>
<P>
Some gay activists, who have been critical of the Sheriff's Department and have 
demanded that the city explore the possibility of establishing its own force, 
were skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of a feasibility study, it sounds more like a mechanism to justify a 
decision that's already been made," said Jean Conger, executive director of 
Southern California Women for Understanding, a lesbian rights group. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department provides service to West Hollywood, where an estimated 
35% of the 37,000 residents are gay, under an $8.5-million annual contract that 
expires next year. About 120 deputies are assigned to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Although West Hollywood officials have praised the department for its 
crime-fighting abilities, gays have frequently complained of being harassed by 
deputies. Gay rights activists have also complained that there are no 
acknowledged gays among the department's 7,000 deputies. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 gay activists have endorsed a petition circulated by City Councilman 
Steve Schulte demanding that the department recruit openly gay men and women. 
</P>
<P>
The petition dismisses as inadequate a February agreement between West 
Hollywood and the Sheriff's Department aimed at recruiting gays as deputies.

HELPING VICTIMS TO COPE WITH RED TAPE; 
</P>
<P>
VOLUNTEERS GUIDE DOMESTIC-VIOLENCE SUFFERERS THROUGH MOUNDS OF FORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a small room in Family Court Services in downtown San Diego, a teen-age 
mother with a blackened eye explains to a volunteer legal adviser that her 
boyfriend recently beat and choked her after she complained he wasn't doing 
anything with his life. She says he also threatened to take her baby. 
</P>
<P>
She wants the court to order her boyfriend to stay away, a task made all the 
more difficult because she must fill out 17 pages of forms to be eligible for a 
temporary restraining order. 
</P>
<P>
But a 3-month-old program is making the battered young woman's chore far less 
demanding, court officials say. 
</P>
<P>
She is getting free legal advice and assistance in filling out her forms at a 
Domestic Violence Restraining Order Clinic that opened Feb. 1, staffed by 
volunteers from the San Diego Volunteer Lawyer Program, the Lawyers Club of San 
Diego and the YWCA Battered Women's Services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Volunteers Lending a Hand 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys, paralegals and law students have volunteered at the clinic to help 
prevent more than a thousand battered and often indigent victims from getting 
tripped up in the multi-step process that precedes a restraining order. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a college grad, and I would have a hard time filling out those forms," 
said Murray Bloom, director of Family Court Services. "Getting help from the 
court system requires a lot of work. When you're bleeding and in distress, how 
can you do it? 
</P>
<P>
"To ask (victims) to fill out these forms is almost to make them a secondary 
victim of the court system," he said. "The clinic takes 90% of the burden off 
them. Without this clinic, I believe some people would go without the 
protection of the court." 
</P>
<P>
Clinic staffers, some of whom are paid by their companies to work there, refer 
victims to social agencies and shelters when necessary. Assistance is also 
available to illiterate victims and those who only speak Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
About 80% of victims at the clinic are women, but men, especially those who are 
elderly, also are seen. Victims often arrive in tears; some have broken noses 
or blackened eyes. Others can barely walk. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very much-needed service," said Soyla Elliott, a paralegal with the 
Volunteer Lawyer Program and a clinic coordinator. "We have some clients who 
can't sign their names." 
</P>
<P>
Clerks at the Family Counseling-Conciliation Court at 1551 6th Ave. inform 
those seeking a restraining order in domestic-violence cases about the clinic 
on the building's second floor. The victims apply for "stay-away" orders to 
keep abusers 100 yards away, or "kick-out" orders to remove abusers who live in 
the victims' homes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Temporary Restraining Order 
</P>
<P>
A clerk can issue a temporary restraining order if the forms are completed 
satisfactorily and if certain criteria -- including that the victim has been 
abused within the last 15 days -- are met. The order is valid until a hearing 
before a judge is held, from 5 to 10 days later. 
</P>
<P>
A restraining order of up to three years can be issued by one of four Superior 
Court judges who handle domestic cases. They hear from about 40 applicants a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"It was always a problem that people weren't prepared," said Superior Court 
Judge William Howatt Jr. "The people coming through the clinic have a better 
understanding of what to do to prepare for their hearing. That makes it easier 
on the judges. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, the restraining orders were being used as a substitute for a divorce. 
But the clinic has helped screen that out." 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Volunteer Lawyer Program, which runs the project, believe 
the service is the only one of its kind in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Though the clerk's office does not charge rent for the 8--by-15-foot clinic, 
the Volunteer Lawyer Program spends about $2,500 a month for a full-time clinic 
coordinator, clerical support and a part-time attorney. 
</P>
<P>
At the going rate of $125 an hour, a month's service by one attorney is worth 
more than $17,000, according to Carl Poirot, executive director of the 
900-member Volunteer Lawyer Program. 
</P>
<P>
Before the clinic opened, applicants who could not afford legal help relied on 
already overburdened court clerks for help. To make matters worse, clerks and 
attorneys say, the number of applications for domestic restraining orders has 
increased as the region has grown. Court officials also believe a proliferation 
of drug use, particularly of methamphetamines, has led to more incidences of 
domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Domestic-Violence Calls 
</P>
<P>
Regional crime statistics show that the number of domestic-violence calls to 
police increased by 11% between 1987 and 1988. More than 2,000 of the county's 
15,570 calls in 1988 involved the use of a weapon, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our clerks were burning out and requesting transfers," said Charmaine Ames, 
assistant chief of family law and probate division. 
</P>
<P>
Amid crying babies and restless children, lines at the clerks' counter were 
often out the door. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes applicants would see the same person at the counter five times or 
more before they got the paper work right," said attorney Maria Arroyo-Tabin, a 
member of the Lawyers Club and the Volunteer Lawyer Program. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people in that situation just threw up their hands and said, 'The hell 
with this,' " said Poirot. 
</P>
<P>
The YWCA Battered Women's Services, the Volunteer Lawyer Program and Women's 
Studies and Services in San Diego has offered small-scale programs to help the 
indigent apply for temporary restraining orders. 
</P>
<P>
But today, volunteers at the clinic assist 15 to 35 clients a day, from 9-11 
a.m. and 1-2:30 p.m. weekdays. About 140 legal advisers have signed up to work 
at the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Poirot said plans are under way to open similar clinics at the Vista and El 
Cajon courthouses.

CITY, CONSUMER GROUP FIGHT REVIEW DEADLINE IN SCE-SDG&amp;E MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of San Diego and a local consumer group are opposing a proposal that 
calls for state regulators to complete their review of San Diego Gas &amp; 
Electric's proposed merger with Southern California Edison by March 30, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
In a filing made last week with the state Public Utilities Commission, the 
utilities suggested that their proposed review schedule included ample time for 
merger critics to voice concerns to regulators. "While our proposed schedule is 
not a leisurely one . . . it can hardly be characterized as a 'rush to 
judgment,' " according to the filing. 
</P>
<P>
The March 30, 1990, deadline coincides with a "drop dead" date that the two 
utilities included in their merger agreement, which was announced in November. 
The utilities have maintained that either company could abandon the deal if it 
is not completed by then. 
</P>
<P>
However, the proposed hearing schedule has drawn strong opposition from the 
city and from Michael Shames, executive director of Utility Consumers Action 
Network, a San Diego-based consumer group. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wants Review Extended 
</P>
<P>
The consumer group has asked commissioners to extend their review of the 
proposed merger until February, 1991, nearly a year longer than suggested by 
Edison and SDG&amp;E. The city of San Diego believes that the review should be 
extended until December, 1990, according to William S. Shaffran, deputy 
attorney for the city of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
PUC Administrative Law Judge Lynn Carew will hear arguments on the proposed 
review schedule in a preliminary hearing Thursday in San Diego. It is unclear 
when Carew will set a deadline for the review. 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E and Edison have been arguing for a shorter review, while the utility 
consumers' group, the city and other intervenors who question the need for a 
merger have been pressing Carew to approve a lengthier proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
The schedules proposed by the city and the consumers' group are driven largely 
by a disagreement between the utilities and the Division of Ratepayer 
Advocates, a PUC staff group that will issue a report on the proposed merger. 
</P>
<P>
Edison and SDG&amp;E maintain that the PUC's Division of Ratepayer Advocates 
could complete its review and issue a report by July 17 of this year. The 
Division of Ratepayer Advocates, however, has maintained that it cannot 
complete its report until late this year. 
</P>
<P>
Shames said Monday that the utility consumers' group needs two months to gather 
testimony for its report to the PUC. However, the group can't begin that review 
until after the Division of Ratepayer Advocates issues its report, Shames said. 
"That's our major stumbling block with the schedule" presented by the 
utilities, Shames said. 
</P>
<P>
The city and the consumers' group also are arguing that Edison and SDG&amp;E 
have failed to address significant issues in testimony. "UCAN feels that 
Edison's (merger application) is incomplete, as do a lot of other intervenors 
who believe that a lot of proper issues were not addressed," Shames said. 
</P>
<P>
The city and the consumers' group have argued in PUC filings that the utilities 
have failed to address the proposed merger's effect on competition in the 
electric utility industry and whether there are alternatives to the merger that 
would benefit customers.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council on Monday postponed enacting a ban on the sale and 
possession of semiautomatic weapons, but vowed to approve legislation to do so 
in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The postponement was the third since the council voted, 7 to 2, on Feb. 27 to 
regulate the weapons. Final approval requires a second council vote. 
</P>
<P>
The council has agreed to the delays while awaiting the outcome of the 
Legislature's deliberations on two bills regulating the weapons. Final action 
on the bills, which together are not as strict as the proposed local ordinance, 
should be completed within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, the council ordered Deputy City Atty. John Kaheny to draft a local 
version of the pending Senate bill for consideration in two weeks along with 
the council ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Mayor Judy McCarty vowed that one of the measures will be passed then. 
"This council has run out of patience. . . . Whether they've signed it or not, 
something is going to be passed here," McCarty said. 
</P>
<P>
A locally approved ordinance would be in effect only until Jan. 1, 1990, when 
the state laws would take effect and preempt it.

The case in which a San Diego police officer shot a drug suspect six times and 
killed him last month was sent Monday to the district attorney's office, where 
officials will determine whether the officer is criminally responsible for the 
death of Stanley P. Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan was shot April 22 by veteran Officer Timothy Fay as two other officers 
were arresting Buchanan for illegal possession of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Many leaders in Southeast San Diego have decried the shooting as an unjustified 
use of force, and an attorney for the Buchanan family has filed a $15-million 
wrongful-death claim against the city. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Bob Burgreen met briefly on Monday with Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller 
to discuss the case, and the chief said he requested an expeditious review of 
the matter by Miller's office. 
</P>
<P>
"The public and the involved officer deserve as quick a resolution as possible" 
to the case, Burgreen said. 
</P>
<P>
Fay remains on administrative duty.

JUDGE VOIDS CIVIL SUIT AGAINST DEPUTIES ACCUSED IN KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge said Monday that she will dismiss a $10-million lawsuit that 
accused three Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies of killing a Van Nuys woman 
after an evening of drinking. 
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer said a wrongful death claim 
also contained in the lawsuit may be refiled against the deputies in Los 
Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Pfaelzer said that because the deputies had not acted in their official 
capacity as law enforcement officers while with Catherine Braley, the deputies' 
request to dismiss a civil rights claim filed by Braley's mother, Mary Postma 
of Van Nuys, would be granted. 
</P>
<P>
Braley's beaten and strangled body was found the morning of Jan. 15, 1988, in a 
parking lot in the 8100 block of Sepulveda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The evening before, Braley, 26, had been drinking for several hours in a nearby 
bar called The Hunter and had left at the same time as Robert Mallon, Robert 
Waters and Mike Turner, who were among several off-duty deputies at the bar 
after the funeral of another deputy. 
</P>
<P>
All three deputies denied involvement in Braley's death, and Los Angeles 
police, who are investigating the unsolved killing, have said no deputy is a 
suspect in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Waters and Turner said in court depositions that they went their separate ways 
after leaving the bar. Mallon said in a deposition that he and Braley left in 
his unmarked county car and drove to a nearby spot where they had consensual 
sex in the car. He said Braley then got out of the car and drunkenly walked 
away. The spot where they had stopped is about one block from where she was 
found dead the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
In her lawsuit, which was filed two months after the murder, Mary Postma 
accused the deputies of using their authority as law officers to force Braley 
to leave the bar with them. The suit alleges that Braley was killed when she 
refused to have sex with them. 
</P>
<P>
To keep the case under federal court jurisdiction, Postma needed to present 
evidence that the deputies had acted "under color of law" thereby depriving 
Braley of her civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
In Monday's hearing in U.S. District Court, Postma's attorney, Marion R. 
Yagman, argued that the deputies had identified themselves in the bar as law 
officers and that Mallon had taken Braley in his county-owned undercover car. 
</P>
<P>
"Braley went with the defendants after she was told they were all police 
officers," Yagman said. "Police officers never really cease to be police 
officers." 
</P>
<P>
Braley, who was intoxicated, "thought it was safe," Yagman said. 
</P>
<P>
But Pfaelzer, without addressing whether the deputies were responsible for 
Braley's death, said the lawsuit's allegations did not contain evidence that 
the off-duty deputies attempted to exercise their law enforcement authority. 
</P>
<P>
However, Pfaelzer said she would refer the wrongful death claim contained in 
the lawsuit to Superior Court, indicating that she believed that it was an 
issue a jury should decide. 
</P>
<P>
An identical $10-million lawsuit filed against the deputies by Braley's father, 
Edward Postma of Iowa, is pending in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
Pfaelzer said she will conduct a hearing Monday on whether Edward Postma's 
lawsuit, which was filed against the deputies a month after Mary Postma's case 
was filed, will proceed. Under federal statutes, a lawsuit filed by a resident 
of one state against a citizen of another is routinely heard in federal court. 
Mary and Edward Postma are divorced. 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, the deputies' attorney, Anthony P. Serritella, said he 
believed that the deputies will ultimately be successful in defending 
themselves in either federal or Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we will prevail," he said. "There is a complete absence of evidence. 
They have asked the court to build inference on inference on inference."

FIRM FINED FOR 10 VIOLATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
OSHA CITES EGG CITY FOR SAFETY HAZARD LINKED TO MAN'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited a Ventura 
County egg producer for a safety violation that inspectors said contributed to 
the March 23 death of a worker. 
</P>
<P>
The citation, made public Monday, also alleges that Julius Goldman's Egg City 
violated nine other federal safety laws during a seven-day period in March when 
the agency inspected the 300-acre facility near Moorpark. OSHA fined the 
company $14,410 for all 10 violations, which range from poor housekeeping 
procedures to failure to secure a protective metal plate over a machine 
involved in the worker's death and failure to monitor oxygen and combustible 
gas levels in grain bins. 
</P>
<P>
Egg City officials did not respond to repeated phone calls from The Times on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The inspection was prompted by a fatal accident involving Rodolfo Gomez, 31, of 
Fillmore, who bled to death shortly after his right leg was severed near the 
waist by a machine called an auger, which mixes chicken feed. Gomez was walking 
on a runway above the augur when he slipped and displaced a metal plate 
covering the device, according to a Ventura County sheriff's report on the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
The OSHA citation alleges that the metal plate was not securely fastened when 
Gomez slipped -- a condition that the company could have discovered through 
diligent inspection of its equipment, said Frank Gravitt, director of the 
agency's north Los Angeles area district. 
</P>
<P>
But Gravitt said there is no evidence that the company knew about the condition 
and ignored it. Therefore, the violation is classified as serious instead of 
willful and carries a maximum fine of $1,000. OSHA fined Egg City $900 in the 
violation, Gravitt said. 
</P>
<P>
OSHA's findings confirm a March 23 sheriff's report on the accident. The report 
said clamps used to hold the protective plate over the auger appeared to have 
been removed "quite awhile ago," judging from the amount of dirt lodged in the 
holes where the clamps would have been. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez's common-law wife and two children have filed a death claim with the 
state Workers Compensation Appeals Board for $97,000, the maximum they can 
collect under state law, said their attorney, Victor B. Moheno. A civil lawsuit 
will not be filed against Egg City because state law prohibits dependents of an 
employee killed on the job from suing the employer except in rare instances, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Moheno said that if an investigation he is conducting finds the company 
knowingly permitted a hazardous condition to exist, he will also file a 
"serious and willful misconduct" petition for $46,000 with the workers 
compensation board. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grain Storage 
</P>
<P>
Egg City was also cited for willfully violating a federal statute requiring 
companies that store grain to monitor oxygen and combustible gas levels in 
their silos to prevent explosions and death by suffocation. The violation was 
classified as willful because interviews with workers and inspection of company 
records showed that workers had complained about 10 years ago of respiratory 
problems resulting from lack of oxygen in the grain bins, Gravitt said. OSHA 
fined the company $10,000 for the problem, the maximum allowable for a willful 
violation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Egg City was also cited for not having guardrails around walkways atop its 
30-foot-high grain silos. Other violations include failure to install adequate 
protective guards on a machine used to grind metal and sharpen tools, and 
failure to build elevated stairways over machinery. Gravitt said workers in 
some areas of the plant were forced to clamber over potentially dangerous 
equipment because of the lack of stairways. 
</P>
<P>
Egg City has until May 26 to contest the citations and request a hearing before 
the federal Occupational and Safety and Health Review Commission in Sacramento, 
Gravitt said. The company was also given various deadlines by which to correct 
the violations, however, most have already been remedied, he said. The agency 
will conduct a surprise inspection this summer, Gravitt said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Union Representation 
</P>
<P>
Egg City's 250 workers were represented by the United Farm Workers until 1986 
when they walked off the job in a dispute over wages and were replaced. The 
strike occurred after the ranch, citing severe financial problems, filed for 
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and cut 
wages by as much as 30%. 
</P>
<P>
The company, listed as the world's largest chicken ranch in the 1986 Guinness 
Book of World Records, has since been reorganized and has paid its debts, said 
Arnold L. Kupetz, an attorney for Egg City during bankruptcy proceedings. A 
Japanese trading firm, Okura Inc., which purchases frozen egg yolks for 
mayonnaise and egg noodle products from Egg City, loaned the company about $14 
million in exchange for acquiring a 40% interest, Kupetz said. 
</P>
<P>
Diana Lyons, an attorney for the UFW, said the union has long feared that there 
would be safety problems at the ranch, which produces about 2.2 million eggs 
daily. She said the company intended to "save every penny regardless of worker 
safety" and would not let the union inspect the facility, despite repeated 
requests. The union has asked the state Agricultural Labor Relations Board for 
the right to represent the workers.

MAN GETS 15 YEARS TO LIFE IN KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 23-year-old Pacoima man was sentenced Monday to 15 years to life in prison in 
the shooting death of the girlfriend of a reputed San Fernando Valley drug 
czar. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent Williams pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in San Fernando 
Superior Court in the Feb. 14 shooting death of Michelle Smith, 18. Williams 
turned himself in to police soon after Smith's body was found in the Sylmar 
motel room where she lived in the 13100 block of San Fernando Road, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Sid D. Trapp said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith died of one shotgun blast to the chest. Williams had argued with the 
victim before the shooting, but the exact motive for the slaying was not clear, 
Trapp said. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a plea agreement with prosecutors, Williams was sentenced to 15 
years to life in prison for the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Trapp said the victim was the girlfriend of Stanley Bryant, who authorities say 
operates a sophisticated Valley drug organization with his older brother, Jeff 
Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Bryant is in Los Angeles County Jail awaiting trial on murder charges 
in the Aug. 28 slaying of four people at a Lake View Terrace "rock" house owned 
by his brother. Jeff Bryant is serving the final months of a four-year sentence 
for operating a drug center at the house. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' defense attorney, Alan Budde, asked the court Monday to consider 
putting his client in a high-security unit in state prison. He said that 
because of Smith's relations with Stanley Bryant, Williams has been the target 
of several attacks at County Jail.

BUILDING INSPECTORS ORDERED TO HAND OVER NOTES ON DISPUTED TOWNHOUSE PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles city building inspectors caught in a dispute over construction of 
24 townhouse units in Woodland Hills were ordered Monday to turn over their 
notes and calculations to zoning officials investigating the project's 
legality. 
</P>
<P>
Zoning Administrator Franklin P. Eberhard said he will use the records to help 
determine whether the $7.5-million third phase of the West Hills Condominiums 
development is being built too tall or too close to neighboring homes. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby residents claim that mistakes by the city's Building and Safety 
Department in interpreting zoning rules that apply to the Ventura Boulevard 
site have allowed both to occur. They have urged that the 80% finished project 
be partly dismantled and made lower and narrower. 
</P>
<P>
But the building's developers urged during an unprecedented hearing Monday in 
Van Nuys that they be allowed to quickly complete the structure so a 
landscaping plan can be put into effect. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to make this building disappear so they can't see it," 
development partner James R. Gary told Eberhard. Gary said "the way to do it is 
by hiding it" with tall trees "that will make a solid screen" in front of the 
three-story hilltop structure. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners spokesman Sid Perry said residents are against any cover-up of what 
he called a series of mistakes made in recent months by the city department. 
</P>
<P>
Besides miscalculating the height of the building and its distance from nearby 
homes, inspectors mistakenly thought that it was finished and fully occupied 
before construction began, Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
"After what we've run into over the past few months, we don't trust Building 
and Safety anymore," Perry said. Even without a group of controversial 
eight-foot-tall penthouse lofts on its roof, the building is still about 1 1/2 
feet higher than the 45 feet the city should be allowing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert L. Glushon, a lawyer representing the developers, disagreed. He said 
building inspectors correctly interpreted the new structure's height and 
setback from neighbors. Glushon said that if Eberhard rules against the 
penthouses, the builders will remove the penthouses' floors and redesignate 
them as "skylights" -- which can protrude above the maximum height of a roof. 
</P>
<P>
Eberhard said he hopes to reach his decision -- which can be appealed to the 
city Board of Zoning Appeals by either side -- in about two weeks.

ANGELS HOLD ONE-INNING LUMBER PARTY; 
</P>
<P>
HITTERS WAKE UP FOR 9-2 VICTORY OVER TIGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
DETROIT 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The supposedly potent Angel offense has been dormant for much of the season. 
But Monday night, the hitters began to stir. 
</P>
<P>
Scoring nine runs in the fourth inning, the Angels buried the nearly comatose 
Detroit Tigers, 9-2, before 12,795 die-hard fans at Tiger Stadium and gained 
their 10th victory in 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
The question now is whether the Angel hitters can completely shake their slump. 
</P>
<P>
"All we're hoping for is our offense to become as productive as we think it can 
be," Manager Doug Rader said. "So far, it hasn't been, but if it even 
approaches our expectations, we'll be fine." 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to outstanding pitching, the Angels have excelled. Just ask Chuck 
Finley, who had his second complete game of the season, improved his record to 
4-2 and lowered his earned-run average to 2.60. The Angels' league-leading team 
ERA is 2.65. 
</P>
<P>
"We just keep rolling it over and over," Finley said of the Angel starters. 
"Everyone wants to have a better outing then the last guy. Nobody wants to take 
the rap as the weak link. 
</P>
<P>
"This spring, everybody talked about how we'd produce (offensively) and all the 
pitchers had to do is keep us close. It hasn't been that way so far, but we've 
got people who can put the numbers up. I still wouldn't want to pitch against 
our lineup." 
</P>
<P>
Tiger starter Doyle Alexander, who was 11-5 against the Angels before Monday 
night, never seemed to mind that much. But this Angel team has been finding a 
way to win for the last month. 
</P>
<P>
Designated hitter Brian Downing, one of the few consistencies in the 
on-again-mostly-off-again offense, is a veteran of 16 major league seasons. 
He's acutely aware that the time will arrive this year when the hitters will 
have to carry the load if the Angels are to continue winning. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been getting the pitching and just enough hitting," said Downing, whose 
bases-loaded triple Monday was a crowning blow in the fourth. "Realistically, 
we can't expect this kind of pitching for 162 games, but if you can get 
consistent starters every day, it's so uplifting. 
</P>
<P>
"We're riding the wave, but there will tough times when we will have to pick 
(the pitchers) up." 
</P>
<P>
Finley certainly got a lift in the fourth inning when the Angels scored nine 
runs without the benefit of a home run. Downing and Wally Joyner belted 
back-to-back 425-foot triples that would have been homers in most parks, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner led off the inning with a double to left-center. One out later, Devon 
White and Chili Davis hit singles, Lance Parrish walked and the Angels had a 
1-0 lead and the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
Dante Bichette then hit a bouncer down the third-base line and third baseman Al 
Pedrique made a nice back-hand stab of the ball, but his throw to the plate hit 
White in the foot and both White and Davis scored. Jack Howell was walked 
intentionally to load the bases again and then Alexander (3-3) walked Dick 
Schofield -- after getting ahead in the count, 0-and-2 -- and the Angels gained 
a 4-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Downing gave the Angels a big lead with a triple that one-hopped off the 440 
sign in dead center. Ramon Pena replaced Alexander. But Joyner, who is hitting 
only .224 despite having a hit in eight of his last 11 games, made the most of 
his second at-bat in the inning. He hit a shot almost identical to Downing's. 
Johnny Ray hit a single to center to score Joyner and the Angels had their 
biggest inning since they scored nine in the second against the Yankees on Aug. 
27, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
It was a big night for Joyner, not only because he was two for four with a 
walk, a line-out to right and a 410-foot fly out to center, but because he 
finally felt like a contributor to the Angels' streak. 
</P>
<P>
"I did pretty good tonight," Joyner said. "The frustrating part has been to go 
out and not think you're helping the club. I mean I enjoy winning, but it's 
just a matter of not feeling like you've helped in the wins." 
</P>
<P>
Joyner said he has stopped trying to pull every pitch, an early-season phase he 
goes through every year. 
</P>
<P>
"All my career, when Wally Joyner was hitting good, I was hitting the ball over 
the shortstop's head and going to left," Joyner said. "I finally feel like I 
have an idea at the plate again. Of course the key is to see what happens 
tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
That's pretty much the tact Rader is taking, not wanting to label a one-inning 
outburst as the end of his club's offensive woes. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything you say after a game like this sounds greedy," he said, "but I'd like 
to see us have this kind of run-scoring capacity in more than one inning. We 
need to keep the pressure on. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not there yet, but hopefully, we'll be there on a more consistent 
basis." 
</P>
<P>
Joyner says he's not superstitious, but he does plan to "retrace his steps" of 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no big deal, but I will be getting up at exactly 12:13," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And it still remains to be seen whether this is some grand awakening or if the 
Angel offense will hit the snooze alarm.

Manager Doug Rader decided to maintain his normal pitching rotation rather than 
skip fifth-starter Jim Abbott's next outing, which means the Angel starters 
will be working on six days' rest rather than the normal four. Abbott will 
start Friday night against the Yankees at Anaheim Stadium. "With the innings 
the starters have pitched and as far into the games as they've gone, a little 
extra rest shouldn't hurt anyone," Rader said. Take away each starters' 
shortest outing and all five have lasted six innings or more in every other 
start. . . . Injury Updates: Second baseman Johnny Ray said Monday his sore 
left wrist was "the same." And center fielder Devon White said his sore throat 
was "about the same, day-by-day." . . . Claudell Washington, whose daughter is 
in the hospital after injuring her neck in a household accident, has not 
rejoined the team. Club officials said he would return as soon as his daughter 
is released from the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
If things weren't going badly enough for the Tigers, who have the worst winning 
percentage in baseball, they got worse Monday night. Center fielder Ken 
Williams bruised his ribs on the first play of the game when he slammed into 
the fence to make a running catch of a drive off the bat of Brian Downing and 
had to leave the game. Then in the fifth inning, first baseman Torey Lovullo 
crashed into the railing near first base while chasing a pop foul. Lovullo 
bruised both knees and had to be helped from the field. Both are on a 
day-to-day basis.

MCKNIGHT IS SLIGHTED ONCE AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
LINEMAN FINDS HIMSELF AS SECOND-STRING CENTER AT CHARGERS' MINI-CAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After Dennis McKnight finished playing his high school football for the Wagner 
High School Falcons in Staten Island (N.Y.), the college recruiters rewarded 
him by offering no scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
When McKnight became an honorable-mention All-American at Drake in 1980, the 
National Football League recognized his achievement by ignoring him in its 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, McKnight started all 16 games at right guard for the Chargers and 
became a Pro Bowl alternate when his peers voted him the seventh-best guard in 
the American Football Conference. 
</P>
<P>
So how did new Charger Coach Dan Henning's staff reward McKnight Monday at the 
first day of the team's mini-camp at their practice facility at San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
It made him a second-team center during the morning workout. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure it bothered me," said McKnight, the team's freest spirit -- a guy with 
tattoos on his arms, Harleys in his garage and a nasty gleam in his eye. "I got 
bent all out of shape." 
</P>
<P>
Monday was not a good day to be Dennis McKnight. 
</P>
<P>
His teammates affectionately call him "Conan," as in "the Barbarian." Yet when 
Henning was asked about McKnight after practice, he referred to him as 
"Conehead." 
</P>
<P>
Worse for McKnight, Henning said he knew about the Conan nickname and still 
chose to call him Conehead. 
</P>
<P>
Worse yet for McKnight, he finds himself competing at center with his best 
friend on the team, veteran Don Macek, who was the starting center through the 
first five games last season before injuring his shoulder and finishing out the 
year on the injured reserve list. Don Rosado filled in at center for the 
remainder of the season. 
</P>
<P>
There might or might not be a happy ending to Monday's McKnightmare. 
</P>
<P>
The Charger coaches say they will be experimenting with all their offensive 
linemen during this five-day mini-camp. 
</P>
<P>
"If Dennis feels demoted, he's wrong," said Larry Beightol, the team's new 
offensive line coach. 
</P>
<P>
But Beightol stopped short of feeling sorry for McKnight. "He's drumming all 
this up in his own mind," Beightol said. "I have respect for what he did last 
year. But that doesn't carry any water now. We've got a whole new staff here 
and what we're trying to do is find at least five guys that we can win with and 
start them." 
</P>
<P>
Henning said McKnight could end up back at right guard. He also said McKnight 
could move to left tackle. 
</P>
<P>
McKnight said he'll go wherever they ask him to. "I'm used to adversity," he 
said. "Right now, I think I'm classified as 'position pending.' " 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem is the Chargers are still looking for a left tackle. Gary 
Kowalski and John Clay both started at that position last year before neck 
injuries ended their seasons. Neither is ready to practice yet. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said Macek will have to learn to play guard. He said overweight David 
Richards, who started all 16 games at right tackle last year, also will have to 
learn to play guard. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Punter Ralf Mojsiejenko was the only Charger under contract to not show up for 
the first day of mini-camp Monday. "I do not know why he is not here," said 
Steve Ortmayer, director of football operations. "Although it has been 
indicated to me that he has a problem with his contract. It's a contract that 
we have been working on revisions for the last year or so." Ortmayer said Coach 
Dan Henning would decide whether or not to fine Mojsiejenko. The mini-camp is 
mandatory for players under contract. The maximum fine is $500 a day. . . . 
Among the more prominent of the free-agent no-shows were running back Gary 
Anderson and defensive lineman Joe Phillips. . . . Fifth-round rookie Elliott 
Smith, a defensive back, sprained his ankle playing basketball after the draft 
and is rehabilitating. . . . Wide receiver/kick returner Eric Yarber (knee) was 
the only Charger to fail his physical exam Sunday. . . . The Chargers signed 
defensive backs Leonard Coleman, a veteran backup, and rookie free agent Mario 
Mitchell of San Diego State.

STONE SHOWS YANKEES AFTER LEACH IS A NO-SHOW 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jeff Stone worked hard before the game, not expecting to play. 
</P>
<P>
When Stone, a late replacement for the missing Rick Leach, found himself in the 
lineup, he still had the strength to drive in four runs as the Texas Rangers 
trounced the New York Yankees, 13-2, Monday night at New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I did about 100 pushups and about 16 laps in the outfield because I didn't 
expect to play," Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
Stone was not in the original lineup but was inserted as the designated hitter 
when Leach didn't show up at Yankee Stadium. A spokesman for the Rangers said 
Leach's whereabouts were unknown, although he made the trip to New York after 
Sunday's game in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to Rick at about 2:30 (p.m.) and he asked me what time the bus was 
leaving," Stone said. "He sounded fine and there was no problem. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of strange, but I had a job to do." 
</P>
<P>
Stone, who entered the game four for 19 this season, hit a three-run triple as 
the Rangers scored seven times in the fifth inning and added a run-scoring 
double in a four-run sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Stone was released by Baltimore this spring and signed to a minorleague 
contract by the Rangers. He was recalled from Oklahoma City on April 11 when 
Buddy Bell went on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
While a member of the Toronto Blue Jays, Leach disappeared from Aug. 25-27, 
1987, after an argument with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
A Ranger spokesman said the club called Leach's wife when he failed to show up 
Monday, but she didn't know his whereabouts. She also said she did not know of 
any problem Leach might have. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Kevin Brown (3-1) pitched seven strong innings to beat New York for the 
second time in a week. Brown beat the Yankees, 4-1, last Wednesday with a 
two-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
He allowed two runs and seven hits in seven innings this time. Ken Rogers and 
Jeff Russell each pitched one scoreless inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers, who had 16 hits, four by Ruben Sierra, sent 12 batters to the 
plate in the fifth, when they had six hits. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Hawkins (3-4) allowed nine hits and nine runs in 4 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Incaviglia, who entered the game in a four-for-25 slump, hit his fifth 
homer for Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 6, Baltimore 1 -- At Baltimore, Mike Moore allowed four hits in seven 
innings and Terry Steinbach extended his hitting streak to 15 games, longest in 
the majors this season, as the Athletics handed the Orioles their fifth 
consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
The A's have won 31 of their last 48 games in AL East ballparks. 
</P>
<P>
Moore (4-2) has allowed more than two runs only once in seven starts. Craig 
Worthington spoiled his shutout bid with a home run in the seventh inning, his 
second of the season. Greg Cadaret finished with two hitless innings. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbach and Walt Weiss each had three of the A's 13 hits. 
</P>
<P>
The Athletics took a 2-0 lead against Bob Milacki (1-3) in the first inning 
when Luis Polonia singled and scored on a double by Dave Henderson, who scored 
on Steinbach's single. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Javier doubled home two runs, and Weiss singled home two more as Oakland 
broke it open in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was the 1,118th consecutive game played by the Orioles' Cal 
Ripken, who moved past Billy Williams into fourth place on the all-time list. 
Ripken's streak began May 30, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 10, Seattle 1 -- Dave Stieb scattered six hits over eight innings and 
Tony Fernandez, Junior Felix and Fred McGriff each drove in three runs as the 
Blue Jays trounced the Mariners at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Stieb (3-0), who gave way to Tom Henke in the ninth, lost his shutout when 
Harold Reynolds hit a run-scoring single in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto chased Mike Dunne (1-2) by scoring six runs on six hits and six walks 
in 3 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 4, Boston 2 -- Kirby Puckett, who had been hitless in 15 at-bats, had 
a run-scoring double and Shane Rawley scattered eight hits in 7 2/3 innings as 
the Twins downed the Red Sox at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Rawley (2-4) worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the second and ended a 
four-game losing streak with his first victory since his debut with the Twins 
on April 6. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota gave Manager Tom Kelly his 200th major league win. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Boddicker (2-3) walked Al Newman to open the game and Puckett doubled him 
home.

ORTMAYER'S NOT BOTHERED BY BEATHARD'S AVAILABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN HEWITT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"No," said Steve Ortmayer, Chargers' director of football operations, he's not 
bothered by Charger owner Alex Spanos' interest in Washington Redskins general 
manager Bobby Beathard. Beathard's resignation will become official May 31. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, Spanos said the Chargers would attempt to hire Beathard, who 
helped guide the Redskins to two Super Bowl victories in seven seasons. 
Beathard owns a home in Leucadia and his parents live in Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
"It's inappropriate to talk about it, because Bobby's under contract to the 
Redskins," Ortmayer said. "And even though he's indicated that he's not going 
to be back, he's still under contract to the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
"The only other thing that I would say is that we've already expressed an 
interested in upgrading our team and our club in any way that we can and we 
will explore every avenue we can to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Ortmayer nor Spanos has said what capacity Beathard would fill if he 
joined the Chargers. Basically, Ortmayer and Beathard do the same job. Beathard 
has said he wants to take some time off to spend with his family after his 
resignation becomes official. BRIAN HEWITT

CANYONS FINISHES THIRD IN STATE GOLF TOURNAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Led by sophomore Wayne Merich, College of the Canyons finished third in the 
36-hole state junior college golf championships Monday at Del Rio Country Club 
in Modesto. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons, which won the Southern California regional last week with a 
tournament-record 729, shot 300, 23 strokes behind champion Saddleback. Canada 
College of Redwood City was second at 782. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy," Canyons Coach Gary Peterson said. "I think we probably could have 
played a little bit better, but the pin placements were brutal." 
</P>
<P>
Merich shot rounds of 78 and 73 to place fourth with a seven-over-par 151. He 
finished two strokes behind Saddleback's Bob Jacobson, who defeated Tim Bahey 
of Mt. San Antonio in a one-hole playoff for the individual title. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Dave Berganio of Mission was sixth at 152. 
</P>
<P>
HIGH SCHOOL GOLF 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park, led by co-medalist Steve Holmes' one-over-par 73, finished first 
in the Southern Section Northern District regionals at Olivas Park Golf Course 
in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park finished with a five-man total of 389, one stroke ahead of Santa 
Barbara and two better than Sunny Hills of Fullerton. Newbury Park, Santa 
Barbara and Sunny Hills advance to the Southern Section team finals Monday at 
North Ranch Country Club in Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes shared medalist honors with Charlie Wi of Westlake and Tim Murphy of 
Agoura.

<P>
Thousand Oaks finished fourth at 394 and Hoover was fifth at 396. Westlake, the 
two-time defending Southern Section titlist, tied for sixth with Agoura at 398. 
Rio Mesa was seventh at 399. 
</P>
<P>
Taft 440, Granada Hills 456 -- Josh Oring of Granada Hills earned medalist 
honors with an eight-over-par 80, but Taft won its 74th consecutive league dual 
meet in a City 5-A League match at El Caballero Country Club in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
HIGH SCHOOL SOFTBALL 
</P>
<P>
Chaminade 7, Alemany 4 -- Kathy Regan scattered seven hits and drove in the 
go-ahead runs with a two-run, two-out double in the sixth in a San Fernando 
Valley League game at Alemany. 
</P>
<P>
Kerry Corcoran was two for four with a run batted in for Chaminade (15-6, 6-3). 
The win moved Chaminade past Alemany (5-4 in league play) into second place and 
clinched a playoff spot with one game remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame 5, Bell-Jeff 1 -- Junior right-hander Becca Berline (14-7) pitched a 
no-hitter, struck out 10 and walked one in a San Fernando Valley League game at 
Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Bell-Jeff scored an unearned run in the seventh after two errors by Notre Dame 
(14-8, 9-0). It was Berline's second no-hitter of the season and fourth in her 
career. 
</P>
<P>
Saugus 1, Canyon 0 -- Cathy Lewis pitched a two-hitter, struck out 15 and drove 
in the winning run in the seventh in a Golden League game at Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Saugus (15-7, 7-1) moved into a first-place tie with Antelope Valley with two 
games remaining.

DIGEST: SIMI VALLEY'S SANTOS DECLARED INELIGIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Greg Santos, a senior in his first season on the Simi Valley High baseball 
team, was declared academically ineligible when quarter grades were released 
last week, Coach Mike Scyphers said. 
</P>
<P>
Santos was batting .323, with four home runs, seven doubles and 18 runs batted 
in. He spent much of the season batting cleanup for the Pioneers, who are 20-3 
and have clinched at least a share of the Marmonte League title. 
</P>
<P>
Santos spent his junior year at Apollo High, a continuation school in Simi 
Valley, because of academic and personal problems. 
</P>
<P>
Three Reseda High baseball players suspended in the wake of a brawl in a game 
against Grant have been reinstated, Coach Mike Stone said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Senior outfielder Robert Gauteraux, senior first baseman Ron Stricklin and 
junior outfielder Joey Tushnet have been cleared to play in Reseda's final 
three games. They were suspended indefinitely for their involvement in a 
bench-clearing brawl that ended an April 25 game against Grant after five 
innings. Grant won, 13-1.

L.A. TEACHER STRIKE MOVES STEP CLOSER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE WOO, Times Education Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School District and the local teachers' union hurled 
new threats Monday, pushing the nation's second-largest school system a step 
closer to its first strike in 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
District Supt. Leonard Britton on Monday ordered teachers to turn in final 
grade information early -- no later than next Monday, two weeks before a 
threatened teachers' strike -- or else risk having the district withhold their 
May paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
The head of United Teachers-Los Angeles reacted swiftly to the district's 
ultimatum, warning that the union will strike Monday instead of May 30. 
</P>
<P>
Starting today, the union will urge members to cease all duties aside from 
teaching. Such duties include turning in grade information and giving 
standardized tests. Teachers are already boycotting most after-school 
responsibilities and yard duties. 
</P>
<P>
The union's 48-member board of directors unanimously approved the steps Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Union President Wayne Johnson said the union has no choice but to hasten the 
strike because teachers remain opposed to the district's contract offers. He 
also acknowledged that a year-end strike would be "meaningless" if teachers 
lacked the leverage of withholding final grades. 
</P>
<P>
"When teachers go on strike, the only thing they can do is withhold their 
services," Johnson said. "Our services (include) records and roll-keeping and 
teaching. If you provide those things, you can't go on strike." 
</P>
<P>
About half of the district's 26,000 classroom teachers refused to report 
mid-term grades to district offices in April, and the union has urged teachers 
not to provide final semester marks, which are normally due by the end of the 
academic year. The last day of classes for most students is June 23. 
</P>
<P>
District and union officials say that they know of no districts where teachers 
have gone on strike at the end of the school year and are not certain about 
what the full effect of such a strike would be. However, officials on both 
sides say the absence of final report cards could prevent students from 
graduating or being promoted to the next grade. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider this conduct by the UTLA leadership as nothing short of extortion," 
Britton said at a news conference at district headquarters downtown. "I deplore 
it in the strongest terms and must do everything within my legal powers to stop 
it." 
</P>
<P>
He said he is ordering all teachers to turn in grades no later than 4 p.m. next 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Teachers who do not comply with this directive by the May 15 due date . . . 
will not be processed for their May check until such time as they comply," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Britton said the district legally can ask for the grade information early, and 
Johnson did not dispute this. Teachers usually have until the end of the school 
year to turn in grades. 
</P>
<P>
Britton said that in the event of a strike, substitute teachers and 
administrators assigned to fill in for striking teachers would combine whatever 
information was submitted on students' progress with records from the last 
weeks of the term to determine a student's final grade. 
</P>
<P>
The superintendent said he made the decision to move up the grade deadline 
without consulting the Board of Education, which has been sharply divided over 
issues of teacher pay and power in the negotiations for a new teacher contract. 
</P>
<P>
Some board members were openly critical of Britton's action. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned because I wanted to have every opportunity available to avert a 
strike," said West San Fernando Valley board member Julie Korenstein. "I don't 
want my time cut short. . . . This could force the issues (too) quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Board member Alan Gershman, however, said he agreed with Britton's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I support the superintendent's efforts to assure that students get the grades 
they've earned and the graduations they're entitled to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The district and the union, which represents counselors, nurses and librarians 
as well as teachers, have been deadlocked for months over pay and other key 
issues. The district has offered teachers a 21.5% raise over three years, while 
the union has demanded 21% over two years. 
</P>
<P>
The district recently improved its wage offer slightly -- from 20% to 21.5% 
over three years -- when it learned that a state tax windfall could bring an 
additional $33 million to the district this year. District officials say this 
is their best offer, but union leaders contend that surpluses in various 
district accounts could be used to pay for higher raises. 
</P>
<P>
Also at issue are the elimination of yard duty for elementary instructors, 
giving elementary teachers a preparation period and the composition of new 
decision-making school councils. Both sides agree that the councils could help 
improve school quality, but the union opposes giving administrators and parents 
equal power with teachers on the councils.

BOARD APPROVES CHANGES TO UPGRADE TEACHER STATUS, PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE WOO, Times Education Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Calling them necessary to upgrade public education in the Los Angeles Unified 
School District, the Board of Education on Monday endorsed several bold policy 
changes aimed at enhancing the status and pay of teachers, including a proposal 
to close the wage gap between teachers and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted 4 to 2 to restructure district salaries, with the goal of 
enabling teachers to earn as much as administrators based on education, 
experience, credentials and working hours. By the same margin, it also agreed 
to require all administrators with teaching credentials to spend some time 
teaching every other year. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted separately on two additional proposals: to create a "career 
ladder" that would enable teachers to earn higher salaries by assuming greater 
responsibilities and to establish a task force to study the salary 
restructuring issues. It approved the measures by a 5 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Jackie Goldberg, author of the proposals, said the changes are 
needed to demonstrate the district's belief in the importance of teachers and 
to acknowledge that most teachers today are far better trained than in the 
past. She also said the measures could help prevent in the future the bitter 
labor unrest among teachers that has plagued the district for most of this 
school year and which may result in a strike as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
Said board member Leticia Quezada, who supported the proposals: "I think the 
bottom line of the motions is the professionalization of teachers. . . . The 
crisis of morale in public education today has much to do with a tremendous gap 
in understanding . . . between teachers and administrators. This motion goes a 
long way" toward closing that gap. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Rita Walters voted against all the measures, calling them 
ill-timed and biased against administrators. 
</P>
<P>
"It is hard not to find an anti-administration bias in this motion," she said. 
"It is not necessary to denigrate one group's status while trying to raise 
another." 
</P>
<P>
Other critics of the salary restructuring proposal said they would be concerned 
if any change in the existing system failed to reflect the fact that 
administrators, particularly those based at schools, have heavier 
responsibilities than teachers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Goldberg and Quezada, board members Warren Furutani and Julie 
Korenstein voted in favor of all the proposals. Board member Alan Gershman 
opposed the pay restructuring proposal and the requirement that administrators 
teach periodically. Board President Roberta Weintraub was absent due to 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
United Teachers-Los Angeles President Wayne Johnson said the proposals, while 
offering positive changes, amounted to little more than a "philosophical 
statement" that probably will have little effect on the current labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals addressed some of the same issues that have been raised during 
the last several months of tense negotiations between the district and its 
32,000 teachers. The two sides have been deadlocked over issues of pay and 
teachers' rights and authority to make school decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Leonard Britton, in general, spoke favorably of the changes, although he 
said some of the objectives may be difficult to accomplish and will require 
careful study. 
</P>
<P>
Britton will appoint a task force of teachers and administrators to study the 
concept of salary restructuring and to present several models of new salary 
tables to the board by July 1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg said she hoped that the requirement that all administrators with 
teaching credentials teach periodically could go into effect early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Her proposals have angered many administrators, who already were upset about 
earlier suggestions to reduce their pay in order to give teachers higher 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
The changes approved Monday could affect about 425 central office 
administrators and 1,500 principals, assistant principals and other managers. 
</P>
<P>
It takes about 19 years for a teacher to rise from the beginning salary of 
$23,440 to top pay of $43,000. 
</P>
<P>
The pay scale for administrators with teaching credentials ranges from about 
$37,000 for program coordinators to $95,600 for associate superintendents. The 
superintendent and two deputy superintendents earn executive flat salaries of 
$141,000 and $125,200, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
It takes about five years for a full-time elementary principal to move from a 
beginning salary of $52,200 to the maximum salary of $63,325. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators work longer years and days than teachers. Administrators are 
paid for eight hours a day and 221, 234 or 261 days a year. Teachers are paid 
for six hours a day and 204 days a year.

WOO WANTS TO REPLACE HOLLYWOOD CITIZENS PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo will ask the council today to abolish 
the contentious citizens advisory committee on Hollywood redevelopment and 
replace it with a panel he would appoint, Woo told The Times on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The action is certain to set off a tumultuous new round in the protracted fight 
over renewal of the faded movie capital, which has pitted Woo and the Community 
Redevelopment Agency against a group of anti-redevelopment activists. 
</P>
<P>
For several years, critics of the 1.7-square-mile redevelopment area have used 
the panel, the Project Area Committee, to air their complaints and fears. In 
December, elections to the committee gave critics a clear majority on the panel 
for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, defiant committee members voted to sue the city if the council votes 
to disband the group. Orry P. Korb, the committee's attorney, said Monday that 
he has been authorized to go to court as soon as the council moves to do away 
with the group. 
</P>
<P>
"They are free to sue," Woo said in an interview. "I basically don't care. The 
important thing for us is to continue the momentum for the redevelopment 
process." 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, the Community Redevelopment Agency is required to consult with 
the Project Area Committee only during the first three years of the 
redevelopment project. The three-year period expired Monday. After that, the 
City Council can extend the committee's life for one-year intervals or simply 
allow the committee to expire. 
</P>
<P>
But opponents of the redevelopment effort point to a provision in the Hollywood 
Redevelopment Plan that states the Community Redevelopment Agency must consult 
with the committee on "activities . . . pertaining to implementation" of the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
Korb interprets that to mean that the committee must remain in existence during 
the 30-year life of the plan. Attorneys for the city and the agency, however, 
say the provision does not require consultation beyond the three years provided 
by state law. 
</P>
<P>
The committee reviews various aspects of the redevelopment effort, including 
proposed traffic and urban design plans as well as some individual projects. It 
makes recommendations to the CRA board of commissioners but has no official 
decision-making powers. 
</P>
<P>
In proposing the overhaul, Woo said he wants to give Hollywood redevelopment "a 
fresh start" by appointing a panel he can work with. Woo has characterized the 
Project Area Committee as "an official forum for wacky behavior," a reference 
to the group's reputation as rowdy and largely unproductive. 
</P>
<P>
Woo appoints four members of the Project Area committee, but the others are 
elected by residents, property owners and local businesses. Woo's new panel -- 
the Hollywood Community Advisory Council -- would have 11 members, all 
appointed by Woo. He said he would name the new committee members in July. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the disastrous consequences of the election process in the past, I 
didn't think it was worth institutionalizing that process in this new 
arrangement," Woo said. "The advantage provided here is that it enables me to 
have a citizens advisory committee which I will be able to work closely with. 
And I will be able to find panel members whose views on transportation or 
economic development or urban design are compatible with my own." 
</P>
<P>
Woo's action does have precedence. In 1985, Councilman Gilbert Lindsay replaced 
the Chinatown Project Area Committee with an appointed body. Woo hinted as 
early as January that he was considering following in Lindsay's footsteps. His 
foes in Hollywood complained then that an appointed committee would simply 
become a rubber stamp for the councilman and would deny a cross section of 
Hollywood residents -- in particular, Woo adversaries -- a role in the 
community's future. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a raucous group because that is the nature of the Hollywood community," 
said Korb, who was hired by the Project Area Committee in January. "For better 
or worse, this PAC is representative. . . . Any effort by the city and the CRA 
to limit the PAC is a statement that they do not want to hear all the voices in 
Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
Woo said Monday that he will introduce his resolution to disband the Project 
Area Committee at today's council meeting.

WOO CONSIDERING SPECIAL COUNSEL IN BRADLEY INQUIRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER and JILL STEWART, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Councilman Michael Woo is considering calling for a special counsel to 
investigate the personal finances of embattled Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, 
according to City Hall sources. 
</P>
<P>
No decision has yet been made by Woo, who is overseeing the council's 
deliberations of the mounting Bradley controversy. 
</P>
<P>
The move reflects growing ambivalence on the part of council members who, 
despite their widely varying opinions of Bradley, are concerned about the 
breadth of the current investigation now under way by City Atty. James K. Hahn. 
But the concerns have yet to ripen into a public call for an independent 
counsel, in large part because of the intertwined political allegiances at City 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Some council members are unwilling to publicly undermine Hahn by calling for a 
new probe, while others are reluctant to appear to publicly challenge Bradley 
in the midst of his troubles. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, several council members, in interviews with The Times, questioned 
whether Hahn and his aides are too closely tied to the mayor's lawyers and said 
they fear Hahn's report will reflect poorly on both the city attorney and the 
council, which is overseeing the effort through Woo's committee. Additionally, 
some have expressed worry that the cautious Woo will forward a report too 
narrow to cover the legal and political fallout of the Bradley controversy. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles Police Department source familiar with the city attorney's 
investigation, meanwhile, said investigators have found "no obvious criminal 
stuff so far," but added that a firm determination had not been reached. 
</P>
<P>
While Woo had last week indicated that the question of involving a special 
counsel was premature, pending the conclusion of the Hahn probe, a Woo 
spokeswoman said Monday that the idea was under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent shift in Woo's position came over the weekend as the council 
member fielded calls from City Hall insiders about the city attorney's 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Julie Jaskol, however, insisted that Woo's position is unchanged. 
"He's never ruled it out," Jaskol said. "He's just said that he is not ready to 
call for a special counsel." 
</P>
<P>
Hahn's probe, which is expected to continue for months, centers on Bradley's 
financial relationships with two local institutions. The 71-year-old mayor was 
paid $18,000 last year for serving as the only paid member of an advisory board 
at Far East National Bank and he received up to $24,000 yearly since 1978 as a 
director of Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley initially denied knowing that the firms were active with the city while 
they were paying him, but documents released in recent weeks have indicated 
that Bradley knew Far East held city accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley also faces separate probes by the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
which is looking into his investments with the firm Drexel Burnham Lambert, and 
the Fair Political Practices Commission, which has launched two investigations 
of the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Woo declined to discuss his consideration of a special prosecutor, who 
theoretically would be an attorney without the ties to City Hall and local 
politics that are shared by Hahn and his deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, even Woo's support would not guarantee the hiring of an independent 
counsel to replace Hahn. Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, whose judgement is 
typically welcomed by other council members, said she does not see the need for 
a new investigator. 
</P>
<P>
"I am satisfied that Hahn is doing the investigation in a professional way and 
that there are no conflicts there, and I don't see any change in the way we are 
doing things," she said Monday after appearing with Bradley at the opening of a 
refurbished recreation center in the Jordan Downs housing project. 
</P>
<P>
Council concerns about the Hahn investigation were raised publicly last 
Wednesday at the first meeting of the Governmental Operations Committee -- 
chaired by Woo -- that oversees the Hahn investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the nervousness centers on the connections of Hahn and his chief aide, 
John Emerson, with the law firm Manatt, Phelps, Rothenberg &amp; Phillips, one 
of the two local firms representing Bradley. Emerson was a partner in the firm 
until 1986, when he left to join Gary Hart's failed presidential campaign. And 
Manatt, Phelps also was retained by Hahn in his recent reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn, at the same hearing, said he would conduct a fully independent 
investigation. "I am elected to do a job and I am going to do it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Hahn's office also said the investigators probing the Bradley 
finances are reporting directly to Hahn, bypassing Emerson. Emerson could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
But some council members are known to have concerns about the connection 
nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
"In a legal office, information can be all you need to strategize a course that 
will get you the decision you want," said one council member, whose request for 
anonymity reflects the sensitivity of the issue at City Hall. "I don't know 
where you take (the Bradley investigation) unless you get an independent 
investigator." 
</P>
<P>
One former deputy city attorney who is familiar with the office's organization 
said Emerson "knows everything in that office, coming and going. 
</P>
<P>
"Emerson may not actually be involved in the gathering of information on 
Bradley, but he will . . . be involved in the sifting of information once it 
comes in, and the decision on what to highlight," the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Also problematic for the Hahn investigators is the dual nature of the city 
attorney's office, which both advises city employees and, as in the case of 
Bradley, investigates them. Three times in the last six years that seeming 
conflict has drawn fire in high-profile cases. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, for example, Hahn was criticized for passing onto the district 
attorney's office an investigation of Councilman Richard Alatorre's campaign 
finances. Hahn said at the time that he forwarded the matter because he wished 
to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest that might arise because 
the city attorney's office routinely advises council members. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation was sent back to Hahn, who filed a complaint resulting in 
Alatorre's payment of more than $141,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEPUTY SHOOTS DOGS IN SEARCH AT HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy opened fire on two vicious dogs, killing 
one of them, after the animals charged him in the back yard of a Lancaster 
house Monday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred about 7:30 a.m. as detectives conducted a search inside 
the house and arrested four people, said Sheriff's Sgt. Ron Shreves. 
</P>
<P>
Shreves said the deputy, whose name was not released, fired a shotgun at a pit 
bull and a boxer when the animals ran at him behind a house in the 800 block of 
West Avenue H-14. The boxer was killed and the pit bull was slightly wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Four people inside the house were arrested on suspicion of possessing stolen 
property, Shreves said. Theresa Ore, 27, Denise Thomas, 27, Ronald Keeylen, 30, 
and Alphonso Nedd, 28, were being held at the sheriff's Antelope Valley station 
jail in lieu of $5,000 bail each. 
</P>
<P>
Shreves said detectives had obtained a warrant to search the house for 
narcotics and stolen weapons. No drugs were found but deputies seized several 
guns.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RAMIREZ UNDECIDED ON OFFERING DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael A. Tynan on Monday gave defense 
lawyers for Night Stalker suspect Richard Ramirez another day to persuade their 
client to allow them to go forward with a defense in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys Daniel V. Hernandez and Ray G. Clark are due back in court at 10:30 
a.m. today, at which time they are expected to disclose their intentions in 
open court and then proceed. 
</P>
<P>
The two had been ready to start presenting their case last week, but Ramirez 
began having second thoughts about that strategy, according to Clark. Since 
then, Clark and Hernandez have been trying to persuade Ramirez to go along with 
the original plan of calling defense witnesses on his behalf. Toward that end, 
they also have met Ramirez's parents, who arrived here last week from El Paso, 
Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez, 29, is charged with 13 murders and 30 other felony counts in a spree 
of nighttime attacks throughout Los Angeles County, mostly in the spring and 
summer of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, Tynan denied a defense motion to strike two of the 43 felony 
counts against Ramirez. Those counts were for rape and sodomy in the alleged 
attack of a Monterey Park nurse in her home. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, as court bailiffs led him out of court for the lunch 
break, Ramirez shouted at some 20 news reporters and photographers: "Media -- 
sensation-seeking parasites!"

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NORTHROP VOWS USE OF CLASSIFIED DATA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Northrop Corp. lawyers said in Los Angeles federal court Monday that they 
intend to defend the company against fraud charges by eliciting classified 
details of the mission and performance of the air-launched cruise missile. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. William Fahey, the chief federal prosecutor in the case, 
said the tactic amounted to "graymail" -- an effort to hamper or scuttle a 
prosecution by seeking documents that cannot be released for national security 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing Monday, Northrop won a five-month delay in the trial, originally 
set for June 13, because of the complexity of the case. Trial was rescheduled 
for Nov. 14 before U.S. District Judge Pamela Rymer. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop and four current and former employees are charged with failing to test 
key parts of stabilization systems for the Air Force air-launched cruise 
missile, which was made by Boeing Corp., and the Navy's Harrier jet, 
manufactured by McDonnell Douglas Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of classified documents arose when one of Northrop's attorneys, Brad 
Brian, sought a trial delay, saying he anticipated "disputes" over access to 
classified information.

TROUBLE AT CINCO DE MAYO EVENTS COULD DOOM FUTURE FESTIVALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the aftermath of two separate disturbances that marred weekend Cinco de Mayo 
celebrations, Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre said Monday that the 
incidents could threaten future Cinco de Mayo and Mexican Independence Day 
festivities at Lincoln Park. 
</P>
<P>
"The jury's out," Alatorre said. "I'll be in consultations with others, and if 
in their judgment it shouldn't (happen), then it won't. . . . I think it's a 
sad commentary for 1% of people who go to a function with destructive purposes 
to control whether events should be held or not for everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
The 14th District councilman made the remarks after Sunday celebrations at 
Lincoln Park and Olvera Street were cut short by authorities because of 
widespread drunkenness and fighting among rival street gangs that indirectly 
led to one fatality. 
</P>
<P>
At the Lincoln Heights event, about 150 police officers quelled the 
disturbances that erupted about 4 p.m. and prompted authorities to call an end 
to the concert that attracted a crowd estimated at more than 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
One man was shot in the abdomen and treated at County-USC Medical Center. 
Several others were injured and six people were arrested in gang-related fights 
at the park, police said. One officer was treated at the scene after being 
struck in the head with a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fighting in Streets 
</P>
<P>
Fighting spilled out onto nearby streets and police said that later Sunday 
night a man was stabbed to death when members of one gang left the park and 
took their dispute several miles away. John Garcia, 27, a suspected gang 
member, was stabbed repeatedly near the Aliso Village housing project in Boyle 
Heights and later died at County-USC Medical Center, police said. 
</P>
<P>
At Olvera Street, the Cinco de Mayo celebration was shut down 30 minutes early 
because of excessive public drinking. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre said he was discouraged by the violence at Lincoln Park, especially 
since authorities beefed up security this year and scaled back the celebration 
to just one day. In the past, Cinco de Mayo affairs at the park ran over two 
days and were relatively free of violence, the Eastside councilman said. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to do something new, but it didn't work," Alatorre said at a news 
conference late Monday. "It's discouraging." 
</P>
<P>
Short of canceling the events, Alatorre said there are still other options, 
including the banning of alcohol; fencing in the park to screen party goers; 
moving the festivities away from Lincoln Park to a more controlled site and 
shifting the focus to a more family-oriented theme. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre said he would meet today with Hollenbeck Division officers and other 
city officials to review the weekend violence and discuss the future of 
Mexican-theme events at Lincoln Park. 
</P>
<P>
A key subject of the discussions is expected to be the availability of alcohol. 
Much of the blame for violence at the event was attributed to revelers who 
brought their own liquor to the park. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sgt. R. D. Johnson: "If you're going to have alcohol, you're going to have 
some people who can't control their consumption. It's out of our hands." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Beer Gardens' 
</P>
<P>
Organizers had hoped that six "beer gardens" would spur "responsible drinking." 
No one who bought beer at the gardens could leave with their cups and sales 
were limited to two beers per person at a time. 
</P>
<P>
"My understanding is that the beer sold there had nothing to do with what 
happened," said Joe Sanchez III, a Montebello beer distributor who won the 
liquor concession for the Lincoln Park event. "A group of people came into the 
park and caused trouble with another group already in the park." 
</P>
<P>
Squads of police officers, augmented by private security guards and roving 
teams of off-duty officers, have been sent into the park in the last three 
years to keep order, Alatorre aide Brad Sales said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we made it a non-alcoholic event, wouldn't people do the same thing?" he 
asked. "We thought we had a pretty good security plan." 
</P>
<P>
But officials blamed heavy drinking for the violence. "I am not in support of 
alcohol being sold at those events," Hollenbeck Police Lt. Sergio Robleto said. 
</P>
<P>
"The less alcohol that is sold at those events, the more it becomes a family 
event." 
</P>
<P>
City Recreation and Parks Department officials defended the structure of the 
Lincoln Park celebrations. Said Tony Troncale, a senior recreation director: 
"It's not something just to come and drink beer at. It's a lot more than that." 
</P>
<P>
Officials stressed that several dozen nonprofit groups raised about $40,000 
selling food and drinks. About half of that, however, came from the sale of 
beer, which was stopped half an hour early at 4:30. 
</P>
<P>
Some community activists blamed the sponsor, Miller beer, for setting the wrong 
tone. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Asking for Trouble' 
</P>
<P>
"It's a Mickey Mouse holiday. No one celebrates it in Mexico," said anti-drug 
activist Ray Chavira. "What about the real reason for celebrating it? They're 
pushing a legalized drug (beer) upon our community. You're asking for trouble." 
</P>
<P>
A Miller spokesman said that park officials and concessionaires were 
responsible for the beer sales, but neighbors were clearly upset. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just too much," said Omar Vega of the United Neighborhoods 
Organization. "It's no longer a family event. The youth was only there for one 
thing -- to party down."

Comedian Jonathan Winters, in San Francisco to receive a doctor of humane 
letters degree from the Academy of Art College, also showed off some of his 
oddly titled paintings. "Pathetic Black Moon with Awful Vase with Dead Flowers 
in It," is what Winters calls a "put-on of a large white canvas with a little 
red dot on its center that the Museum of Modern Art in New York paid 200 grand 
for." Then there's "Two Birds Watching Doris Day's Cat and Dog Drown." Winters 
said that while Day is involved in various animal protection causes, the 
painting has nothing to do with her. Instead, it's "just my black humor at 
work." Winters, 63, studied art at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, and the 
Dayton Art Institute. He holds a bachelor of fine arts degree from Dayton.

Ione Skye, the 18-year-old actress currently starring in "Say Anything," says 
she is thankful she has found a career at such an early age. "Knowing what you 
want to do at a young age is great, and being able to do it while you're in 
your teens is even better. Most kids my age are wondering what they're going to 
do in life, so it's a relief for me. I don't have that problem." Skye is is the 
daughter of 1960s singer Donovan Leitch but dropped his last name while growing 
up in California with her mother after her parents divorced. She decided on the 
name Skye because "that was the (Scottish) island where I was conceived." Her 
first name was selected by her mother and it is the Greek word for purple 
jewel. ALEENE MacMINN

ABC will pick up two awards today when Action for Children's Television hands 
out its 17th annual Achievement in Children's Television honors in Cambridge, 
Mass. "Daddy Can't Read," an "ABC Afterschool Special" about adult illiteracy, 
and "The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh," part of the network's Saturday 
morning children's lineup, are among the 20 winners from broadcast TV, cable 
and home video. ACT president Peggy Charen notes that the winners "demonstrate 
a concern for the TV needs of young audiences," but adds that "creative 
excellence in children's TV is still the exception to the rule of mediocrity."

Country music singer Freddy Fender says there will be no more wasted days or 
nights now that he has kicked drugs and alcohol and started work on reviving 
his career. "For the last 3 1/2 years, I've been hellbent . . . trying to catch 
up after 10 years of drugs and alcohol," Fender said in an interview with The 
Springfield (Mo.) News-Leader. "We're working very hard on getting there." 
Fender said he was driven to drugs and alcohol at the height of his success in 
the 1970s and didn't start to recuperate until his wife obtained a court order 
four years ago to commit him to a treatment center. His first recording in 
eight years, "Spanish Harlem," is due out soon, and he also has a part in 
"Desperado," an upcoming NBC miniseries. ALEENE MacMINN

Cable News Network will begin direct broadcasts in Moscow by the end of the 
summer via an agreement with the Soviet television authority, Gosteleradio. 
"The service is designed primarily for hotels, businesses, governmental 
agencies, international apartment buildings. But it also will be available to 
Soviet citizens who want to pay for it," said Robert Wussler, executive vice 
president of Turner Broadcasting System, CNN's parent company. The signal will 
be scrambled, not to deny access to Soviet citizens but to make sure that those 
receiving CNN paid for it. ALEENE MacMINN

BUILDING A PATH TO A PARK AND PRESERVATION; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTY HAS $10 MILLION TO SPEND IN TIJUANA RIVER VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN FAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are a million people to the south, 2 million to the north and almost 
nobody in between. But the empty expanse of land known as the Tijuana River 
Valley might someday be a 1,000-acre regional park -- a gigantic nature 
preserve open to the public -- if county officials get their way. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows precisely where the park will be or exactly what it will include, 
because the land has not been bought and completion of the project is at least 
20 years away. 
</P>
<P>
But one thing is certain: $10 million was earmarked for the Tijuana River 
Valley in Proposition 70, the state parks bond issue approved by California 
voters last June. County officials, including County Supervisor Brian Bilbray, 
whose district includes the valley, are now figuring out how to spend it. 
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to buy land, primarily in an area bordered by the 
following San Diego streets: Monument Road on the south, 19th Street on the 
west and Sunset Avenue, Servando Avenue and Calle Primera on the north. The 
east end of the park will probably stop just short of Sycamore Road and the San 
Ysidro Sports Field, said Jim Massey, a planner with the county Department of 
Parks and Recreation. 
</P>
<P>
County officials have met with property owners in the area and say they will 
pay market value for the land, then lease it back to the owners. People such as 
Floyd Wirthlin, president of American Sod Farms, will be able to continue their 
businesses, as long as they are compatible with the "passive recreational use" 
the city of San Diego has deemed appropriate for the valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not interested in putting in big ball fields," Massey said. "We're 
interested in low-key, very passive recreation activities like bird-watching 
areas, horseback riding and hiking trails." 
</P>
<P>
Wirthlin, whose 300-acre sod farm provides a habitat for birds and other 
wildlife, said there are about 70 property owners in the area, and "basically 
they would like to keep things the way they are." 
</P>
<P>
Most residents welcome the idea of a park, he said, and would probably sell 
their property if appraisers hired by the county came up with "acceptable" 
market value prices for their land. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Endangered Species Live Nearby 
</P>
<P>
The park is meant to preserve the valley's rural atmosphere and to protect 
vegetation along the Tijuana River. Endangered species, including the 
light-footed clapper rail, the California least tern and the California brown 
pelican, live nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"(Our) highest priority is preserving the biological habitat and the 
agricultural character of the valley," Massey said. "Hopefully, we'll have (the 
public) on the property in less than five years." 
</P>
<P>
Bilbray, who grew up in Imperial Beach and played in the Tijuana River Valley 
when he was young, said his motive for wanting to preserve the area is to 
improve public access to parkland and not necessarily to deter development. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue of building there is moot because the city abandoned 
</P>
<P>
about 15 years ago the construction of a flood control channel . . . so the 
ability to build there is very restricted," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our point is there is a place for public access in the valley and we want to 
guarantee it. We don't want the public barred with the excuse that it's good 
for the birds. We think we can do both." 
</P>
<P>
Directly to the west of the proposed park boundary lies the Tijuana River 
National Estuarine Sanctuary, a 2,300-acre nature preserve, most of which is 
owned and operated by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the state 
Department of Parks and Recreation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's dedicated to the preservation of coastal salt marsh habitat, sand dune 
habitat and . . . the trees along the river," said Martin Kenney, a biologist 
with the Fish and Wildlife Service. State and federal wildlife officials hope 
to eventually build trails for hikers there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Campsites and Golf Course? 
</P>
<P>
Bilbray said he hopes the Tijuana River Valley Regional Park will not only 
extend the estuarine sanctuary's preservation eastward, but also provide more 
recreational use than the federal parkland provides. Among the ideas under 
consideration, he said, are turning the Dairy Mart ponds into fishing lakes and 
adding campsites and a golf course. 
</P>
<P>
Bilbray has spearheaded the drive to create a park out of a patchwork quilt of 
more than 50 parcels of land now owned by the city of San Diego, the federal 
government, various companies, including General Telephone, H. G. Fenton 
Materials, Title Insurance and American Sod, as well as more than a dozen 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Several property owners have already contacted the county with offers to sell 
their land. "We would hope to begin acquiring parcels out there within the next 
several months. . . . Some people have certainly expressed an interest, but we 
haven't done any appraisals yet," Massey said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concerned About Future 
</P>
<P>
Lane McClelland, who makes furniture out of willow trees in an abandoned dairy 
barn off Monument Road, wanted to buy the land he lives on, but his landlord 
wasn't interested. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned. I'd like to know that this land is preserved even after I'm 
gone," McClelland said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a good idea to have a park in this area. . . . We need a way of 
protecting the wildlife." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to bobcats and coyotes, McClelland said, "we have probably one of 
the greatest concentrations of birds of prey in the country, everything from 
hawks and golden eagles to burrowing owls." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Jones, a retired Navy commander who owns property off Monument Road, 
thinks the park is "a nice idea. Better a park than concrete and steel." But he 
is concerned about the sewage in the river. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there are formidable problems to address before the park can be made 
completely accessible to the public, such as the raw sewage that flows into the 
river from Tijuana, the disease-spreading mosquitoes that breed in the stagnant 
sewage and the undocumented workers who cross through the area illegally. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Turns on Funding 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and other federal officials called last month for 
a $192-million sewage treatment plant that would carry Tijuana's waste out to 
sea, but whether or not it is built depends on the availability of funds both 
in Washington and Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
"The border situation is a major stumbling block," Bilbray said. "It's an area 
that is severely impacted by the immigration and drug-smuggling issues," for 
which, he pointed out, the federal government has responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Complete public access cannot occur "until there's a secure border situation," 
he said, but he expects the sewage and immigration problems to be addressed 
within five years so people can begin using the park. 
</P>
<P>
"In the long run, government will have to open up the boundaries, which will 
mean no one sneaking through the park, or else they will have to secure the 
border so that immigration is done legally and not through our wildlife 
preserves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a master plan for the park is not expected for several years. The 
project was approved by the Board of Supervisors in November. 
</P>
<P>
County officials met once with property owners in March and are planning more 
meetings this summer, said Nancy Nieto, administrative services manager for the 
county parks department. "We have contracted for an appraisal, and we'll be 
getting back the results probably between 90 to 120 days," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Development Funds 
</P>
<P>
The county will then contact owners and offer to buy their land. But, before 
any purchases are made, officials said, public hearings will be held. The Board 
of Supervisors must approve any purchase. 
</P>
<P>
"How things will proceed will depend on the dynamics of each acquisition. . . . 
We would deal with each owner separately," Nieto said. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 70 funds will not pay for all of the acquisition. And no money has 
been set aside for development of the park. 
</P>
<P>
According to the county parks department, more money could be applied for from 
the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund and other sources managed by the 
Coastal Conservancy and the state parks department. 
</P>
<P>
Bilbray compares the project favorably to the proposed San Dieguito River 
Valley Regional Park, a 43-mile-long strip of green that will stretch from Del 
Mar to Julian. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be able to do it a little faster because we don't have a bunch of rich 
people fighting among themselves," he said. "You can buy a lot more land with 
$10 in the Tijuana River Valley than (you can) in the San Dieguito River 
Valley. We have a lot more problems, but we have more cooperation. It's the 
greatest challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the working man's version of the San Dieguito park. You're talking 
about people living on 4-acre housing estates there. People here are living in 
. . . housing tract projects that have gang problems. You won't recognize the 
valley 10 years from now."

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ORDINANCE AIMED AT BUILDERS DROPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Avalon City Council has voted down a proposal to require builders of new 
commercial projects to provide housing for half of their workers. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-2 vote reversed an earlier decision by the council to adopt the ordinance 
when it was introduced two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance would have required new commercial developments with 10 or more 
employees to provide housing for 50% of those employees during the peak 
Catalina Island tourist season in August. 
</P>
<P>
During a public hearing last week, however, residents and council members 
expressed concern about the wording of the ordinance and argued that it did not 
set housing requirements for existing businesses that may expand.

2 HURT AS JETLINER TURNS TO AVOID HITTING LIGHT PLANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Air New Zealand Boeing 747 heading for Los Angeles International Airport 
with 386 people aboard was forced to swerve sharply to avoid a light plane less 
than 500 feet away, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Two people aboard the jetliner suffered minor injuries in the incident, which 
occurred about 5:30 p.m. Sunday about 20 miles east of Santa Catalina Island, 
said National Transportation Safety Board regional director Gary Mucho, who is 
heading an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The jumbo jet landed without further difficulty at the airport 10 minutes 
later. Investigators had not found the small plane, a twin-engine Cessna, or 
its pilot. 
</P>
<P>
The jet, on the last leg of a trip from Auckland, New Zealand, had left Tahiti 
Sunday morning and was approaching Los Angeles at 7,000 feet, about 26 miles 
southwest of Long Beach, when the incident occurred, Air New Zealand 
spokeswoman Heather Jeffrey said. 
</P>
<P>
Air traffic controllers issued two warnings to the jetliner of "conflicting" 
air traffic in the area, Mucho said. 
</P>
<P>
"The pilot took evasive action almost simultaneously with the second warning," 
Mucho said. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot of Air New Zealand Flight 6 swerved left and down to avoid the small 
plane, which was less than 500 feet in front of him, Mucho said. 
</P>
<P>
The swerving motion caused two injuries among the 367 passengers and crew of 19 
aboard the plane. A flight attendant bruised his arm and a passenger suffered a 
small cut, airline officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Mucho said investigators were reviewing air traffic tapes to try to determine 
where the small plane may have gone after the close call. 
</P>
<P>
An air traffic control specialist from Washington was flying to Los Angeles to 
aid in the investigation. Air New Zealand was also assisting the Federal 
Aviation Administration and the NTSB in their investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Mucho said the incident occurred outside the restricted Terminal Control Area 
that surrounds the airport, meaning the light plane was probably not required 
to be under the guidance of air traffic controllers.

B OF A ADS IRK DAUGHTER OF BANK'S FOUNDER

Bank of America promotes itself as "doing a job for more Californians." But to 
Claire Giannini Hoffman, the bank her father founded 85 years ago is doing an 
unflattering job on his memory. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman, a frequent critic of Bank of America in recent years, is fighting mad 
over a series of recent B of A advertisements that show a picture of her 
father, A. P. Giannini, and invite customers to open checking accounts. She 
spent much of the weekend contacting newspapers and radio stations around the 
state to condemn the ads, calling them "an insult to my father." 
</P>
<P>
"It is contemptible, what they are doing," the 84-year-old Hoffman said in a 
telephone interview. "They are using my father's name and picture to promote 
their bank." 
</P>
<P>
B of A said it didn't mean to offend Hoffman. "We're sorry she feels that way," 
bank spokeswoman Shirley Norton said. 
</P>
<P>
The advertisements invited new B of A customers to open free checking accounts 
on "Founder's Day," officially celebrated each year on May 6, Giannini's 
birthday. The ads declared, "This Saturday Is Our Founder's Birthday and You 
Get the Present," and ran in many newspapers around the state last week. 
</P>
<P>
In B of A's view, Norton said, the ads capture the spirit of A. P. Giannini. 
"He was very aggressive," she said. "He went out and rang on doorbells to get 
customers. He didn't sit in the branch office, waiting for customers to come to 
him." 
</P>
<P>
But Hoffman disagrees. She said the modern Bank of America does not represent 
the business philosophy espoused by her father, who died in 1949. "My father's 
policy was to help people," Hoffman said. "He believed that, if you helped 
people, eventually you would have people for friends as well as customers." 
</P>
<P>
Today's B of A, she said, "is just another bank. If it didn't have the same 
name, there would be no similarity at all." 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman, who delivered a blow to the bank's image when she resigned from her 
honorary seat on its board in 1985 over what she called the "unpardonable" act 
of selling its San Francisco headquarters, said she has contacted a public 
relations firm and her lawyer "to see what I can do" about the ads.

PAT BOONE'S LABEL SEEKING SALVATION; 
</P>
<P>
WITH FEW HITS, FAMILY RECORD FIRM FOUNDERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Through his Lamb &amp; Lion Records, entertainer Pat Boone has used music to 
spread a Christian message. 
</P>
<P>
He recorded such albums as "What I Believe," featuring the hymns "Onward 
Christian Soldiers" and "Old Rugged Cross." Daughter Debby Boone, best known 
for her 1977 hit "You Light Up My Life," was the label's most popular star. 
Also recording for the label was another Boone daughter, Laury Boone Browning. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Burbank record company that Boone owns is seeking financial salvation 
through the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. Last September, Lamb &amp; Lion Records 
quietly filed for protection from creditors in the wake of financial and legal 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Court papers in the Chapter 11 filing list $355,689 in unsecured debts and 
$62,416 in assets. One savings and loan owed nearly $200,000 is suing the 
record label in San Mateo County Superior Court, alleging in court papers that 
Boone and a former Lamb &amp; Lion executive created a "fraudulent plan" to 
divert money to themselves. A lawyer for Boone said the entertainer denies the 
allegation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
News Spread Slowly 
</P>
<P>
Although the company is owned by a celebrity, news of the bankruptcy-court 
filing has spread slowly through the Christian music business. Several 
executives and producers, some of whom have worked with Lamb &amp; Lion, said 
they were unaware of the label's filing but added that they are not surprised 
that it has suffered financially. 
</P>
<P>
"Debby Boone is the only thing they had that sold very much. You can't support 
a whole record label on one artist," said Billy Ray Hearn, owner of Sparrow 
Records in Chatsworth, one of the nation's largest labels for Christian music. 
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy filing is a setback in the business career of Boone, 54, whose 
full name is Charles Eugene Boone and who is known as much for his wholesome, 
milk-drinking ways as he is for his 1950s hit records. They include such songs 
as "Love Letters in the Sand" and "Two Hearts." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Business Ventures 
</P>
<P>
Boone, who graduated magna cum laude from Columbia University, has frequently 
been portrayed in recent years as an entertainer who used his singing and 
acting career as a steppingstone to successful business ventures. In a 1984 
interview with The Times, Boone said that "underneath the Pepsodent smile and 
white shoes is a would-be Ted Turner, or maybe even a Norman Lear." 
</P>
<P>
Boone's recent ventures have included real estate and television. One of his 
holdings is a 37% stake in television station KDOC in Anaheim, where he is 
president of the board. 
</P>
<P>
The station is Orange County's only commercial television outlet and offers 
such programs as "Hot Seat," hosted by combative talk-show host Wally George. 
</P>
<P>
Boone and other family members could not be reached for comment about Lamb 
&amp; Lion's bankruptcy filing. But Richard A. Green, one of Boone's lawyers, 
said that despite the record company's problems, Boone's other business 
interests are healthy. 
</P>
<P>
"He is not in trouble. None of his (other) businesses are in trouble. This is 
one entity that on its own has not done that well," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Very Active 
</P>
<P>
Green added that Boone has not been very active in running the label. "This is 
something Pat has done because he loves it. It has no bearing on any other 
aspect of his business. There's nothing to read into it," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
The largest claim against Lamb &amp; Lion is for nearly $200,000 from Bell 
Savings, a San Mateo, Calif., financial institution that in late 1987 filed the 
lawsuit alleging that Boone diverted money. 
</P>
<P>
Boone is listed as a creditor for a $117,000 loan, as is his Boone Productions, 
which is listed as having a $47,000 loan outstanding. Debby Boone, 32, is 
listed as a creditor for an undetermined amount in royalties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Owns Entire Firm 
</P>
<P>
Bell Savings, which was insolvent, was acquired last September by a group of 
investors led by former Treasury Secretary William Simon, with about $565 
million in assistance from the Federal Savings &amp; Loan Insurance Corp. Bell 
Savings was merged by the Simon group with a healthy institution, Western 
Federal Savings &amp; Loan, and operates under that name. 
</P>
<P>
Court records list Boone as 100% equity owner in the company. Joel Yodowitz, a 
lawyer representing the savings and loan, said Boone should be responsible for 
the label's debts. 
</P>
<P>
"He should stand in the shoes of Lamb &amp; Lion in terms of any exposure," 
Yodowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Green said Boone denies the allegations, adding that the dispute with 
the savings and loan is being worked out amicably. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Boone was one of the nation's most popular 
singers, purportedly receiving as much fan mail a week as Elvis Presley did. 
He's sold, according to some estimates, as many as 50 million records and 
became a popular actor, starring in such films as "State Fair." 
</P>
<P>
During the 1960s, Boone invested in problem-plagued businesses, including a 
direct-mail film company that went under and an automated restaurant chain that 
went out of business. He invested in the Oakland Oaks, a professional 
basketball team in the now-defunct American Basketball Assn., but avoided 
losses in that deal by selling the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Lamb &amp; Lion was founded by Boone in 1983. Lawyers involved in the 
bankruptcy case said a reorganization plan for the company is being circulated 
among creditors and that more favorable contract terms have been worked out 
with its record distributor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lacks a Superstar 
</P>
<P>
The company's best-selling records were recorded by Debby Boone, whose albums 
typically sold 100,000 to 150,000 copies apiece, said Jerry Parks, general 
manager of the Benson Co., a Nashville, Tenn.-based Christian record company 
that serves as Lamb &amp; Lion's distributor. But he said buyers showed little 
interest in records by Pat Boone or the label's other artists. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Debby Boone's albums sell well, record executives said, Lamb &amp; 
Lion had no artist approaching the superstar category of Amy Grant, who is 
generally acknowledged to be the biggest star in popular Christian music and 
sells millions of records. 
</P>
<P>
Other executives said Lamb &amp; Lion suffered by not having a strong "label 
manager" to run things and was short of money for marketing and promotion. It 
also failed to sign other Christian artists outside the Boone family, as it had 
originally planned. 
</P>
<P>
"The label is really a very small family label," Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers and record executives said Lamb &amp; Lion's problems are not a 
reflection on the $350-million-a-year Christian music business, although the 
segment no longer enjoys the booming growth that came in the late 1970s and 
early 1980s with the surge of the born-again Christian movement. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing complicated to it. Not enough people were buying their 
product," said Joseph A. Eisenberg, a Lamb &amp; Lion bankruptcy lawyer.

HUGE PENTAGON GRANTS SOUGHT TO DEVELOP HDTV; 
</P>
<P>
U.S. ELECTRONICS FIRMS TO ASK FOR $100 MILLION A YEAR, $1-BILLION LOAN 
GUARANTEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A major group of U.S. electronics firms will urge Congress to help the industry 
develop a new generation of television technology through Pentagon grants of 
$100 million a year over the next three years and loan guarantees of as much as 
$1 billion, industry sources said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The American Electronics Assn. plan for entering the high-definition television 
business, which will be presented to the Senate Commerce Committee today, has 
been long awaited because of the intense interest on Capitol Hill and within 
the Bush Administration over how to prevent U.S. companies from being shut out 
of a field now led by Japanese and European concerns. 
</P>
<P>
HDTV, as it is called, promises to bring a much higher quality of picture and 
sound to home television in the 1990s and is expected to be a $50-billion 
market by the end of the century. It is also likely to help spur major advances 
in imaging and other technologies useful in a wide range of electronics 
applications. But the development of the new technology will be costly, and 
U.S. firms have been reluctant to risk their own capital in a field where 
foreign companies are already well entrenched. 
</P>
<P>
The AEA plan, which was prepared by the Boston Consulting Group under the aegis 
of 36 major electronics companies, envisions the establishment of a new 
corporation to undertake joint development and manufacturing of high-definition 
television equipment. It would rely largely on U.S. firms to support the effort 
with their own funds, sources said, but would not necessarily exclude foreign 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear we're going to need a lot of new money invested in the business if 
we are going to remain competitive with the Japanese in HDTV," said one 
industry official involved in preparation of the report. "Unfortunately, there 
is no way to generate all that capital through private sources." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plans to Spend Less 
</P>
<P>
The AEA proposal was scheduled to be discussed Monday night by representatives 
of the firms backing the study, sources said, and could be subject to minor 
modifications before it is released. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon, through its Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, plans to 
spend only about $10 million a year on HDTV research, far short of what the 
firms think is necessary to revive an American consumer electronics industry. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department has agreed to support work on television technology 
because it needs high-resolution computer screens for military uses and because 
it wants to help provide a new market for U.S. semiconductor manufacturers. But 
the defense agency officials have been reluctant to serve as a major source of 
funds out of fear that Pentagon demands could undercut the ability of U.S. 
firms to compete in civilian markets. 
</P>
<P>
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, who is in charge of developing the Bush 
Administration's policy on the new technology, has been seeking to help U.S. 
firms enter the HDTV business by proposing to relax antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
Even before taking office, Mosbacher told Congress that he favors allowing 
American companies to form manufacturing consortiums to help them compete with 
the Japanese and Europeans, and he has pursued that approach during the past 
few months. 
</P>
<P>
But Mosbacher so far has been unwilling to endorse any requests to commit large 
sums of government money to the effort, telling industry officials that the 
federal budget deficit precludes major new expenditures on such risky ventures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Global Battleground 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, U.S. firms are already allowed to work together on research and 
development without violating antitrust laws, and most analysts in the field 
doubt whether further relaxation of antitrust restrictions alone will be enough 
to encourage American companies to re-enter the consumer electronics business. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the midst of a fierce global battleground," said David Staelin, a 
leading electronics engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
"Doing something about antitrust may be a fine idea, but it's going to take a 
lot more than encouraging words from the government to match what our 
competitors are doing." 
</P>
<P>
Several members of Congress, including Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and 
California Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), have been urging the Bush 
Administration to make HDTV a model for rebuilding U.S. competitiveness in a 
number of high-technology areas. 
</P>
<P>
But others question whether the government should focus its support for new 
technologies on high-definition television when U.S. firms are so far behind 
their foreign competitors. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Zenith, there are no U.S.-owned manufacturers of 
television sets or video recorders. The 36 companies behind the HDTV proposal 
include Zenith along with IBM, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, Apple, 
Digital Equipment, Hewlett-Packard and Motorola.

SHEARSON ADVISING POTENTIAL BIDDER FOR EASTERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Investment firm Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said it is acting as financial 
adviser to a Chicago futures trader who may make a bid for strike-torn Eastern 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Ritchie, chairman of CRT Group, reportedly plans a bid for Eastern and 
is being advised in the matter by former defense secretary Frank Carlucci. 
Carlucci is a vice chairman of Carlyle Group, an investment company based in 
Washington, and sources said the federal bankruptcy court almost tapped him in 
mid-April as a special interim trustee to run the airline. 
</P>
<P>
Shearson "is acting as financial adviser to Joseph Ritchie in connection with a 
potential bid for Eastern Airlines," Shearson spokesman Michael O'Neill said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill denied a report in Monday's Wall Street Journal, however, that Shearson 
is providing financing to Ritchie for the bid. 
</P>
<P>
Ritchie did not return calls to his Chicago office. 
</P>
<P>
CRT is one of the most active commodity options and futures trading companies, 
with $250 million in capital, according to the Journal. The company itself is 
not participating in Ritchie's potential bid, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
The Journal quoted an unidentified attorney for Ritchie as saying details of 
financing for the bid and the nature of the Eastern unions' participation were 
still being worked out. It said Ritchie would have an as-yet undetermined 
portion of his own money invested in Eastern under the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Miami-based Eastern has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors 
since March 9, five days after the start of a strike. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland has set Wednesday as a deadline for all 
interested bidders to submit their offers for Eastern or its Northeast shuttle 
service to the court, which must approve any sales. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern management insists that the airline is not for sale and is proceeding 
with its recently announced plan to rebuild as a smaller carrier and raise $1.8 
billion by selling aircraft and other assets. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration said Monday that it has sent 
inspectors to Eastern's main base in Miami to see if there are any violations 
of maintenance record-keeping rules such as those that were found in New York 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
The air carrier announced Thursday that it had temporarily surrendered its 
repair station certificate at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport after the FAA 
determined that Eastern failed to follow its system for recording and 
inspecting maintenance performed. 
</P>
<P>
The New York suspension was for actions that predated the start of the strike, 
said Jack Barker, public affairs officer at the FAA's Atlanta office. 
</P>
<P>
No maintenance work has been performed at Kennedy since the start of the 
strike, he said.

SPACE STATION CAMPAIGN; 
</P>
<P>
MCDONNELL DOUGLAS LAUNCHES ADS TO SAVE PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago, McDonnell Douglas Corp. tried to boost support for America's 
fledgling space station program -- a project potentially worth $1 billion in 
business for the aerospace company -- in a TV advertising campaign that some 
people thought came on too strong. 
</P>
<P>
The commercial -- dubbed "Reds" by McDonnell Douglas publicists -- showed a 
Soviet space station drifting by as people are heard speaking Russian and 
laughing. The letters "CCCP" and a red star are clearly visible on the 
station's outer surface. 
</P>
<P>
As the spacecraft passed out of view, a message appeared on the screen: 
"Shouldn't We Be There, Too?" 
</P>
<P>
NBC, ABC and CBS refused to air the commercial, calling it too controversial. 
The commercial, however, did air for several months on selected local TV 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
This week, McDonnell Douglas is back with a new, more subtle TV ad campaign 
aimed at bolstering the space station program. The new ad doesn't mention the 
Soviet Union. Instead, it features a blonde, blue-eyed little girl and stresses 
the themes of space exploration, education and America's future. 
</P>
<P>
The ad campaign comes at a time when the space station program is facing 
possible delays or cancellation due to the federal budget squeeze. 
</P>
<P>
NASA has requested $2 billion for the program next year, a big increase from 
$900 million in the current year. But Congress is widely expected to trim 
NASA's $13.2-billion budget request for fiscal 1990, and the space station is 
likely to share in those cuts. 
</P>
<P>
NASA Administrator Dale D. Myers said recently that he will recommend canceling 
the space station if Congress orders the agency's $13.2-billion budget cut by 
more than $600 million. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to avert such drastic action, McDonnell Douglas decided to make its case 
for the space station on the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
The new 30-second ad shows a starry-eyed little girl donning a space suit and 
helmet and looking skyward as the space station floats by. The song "Twinkle, 
Twinkle Little Star" plays in the background. 
</P>
<P>
A female narrator says: "There's a big world waiting out there, little one. But 
if you go to school and learn reading, writing, history, art, science and 
everything else you can, who knows how far you'll go?" 
</P>
<P>
After a short pause, a man's voice says: "For an educated America, even the 
sky's not the limit." 
</P>
<P>
The "Astro Baby" ad was developed by J. Walter Thompson, which also developed 
the "Reds" commercial. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Williams, a spokesman for McDonnell Douglas Space Systems in Huntington 
Beach, said the purpose of the latest commercial is "to create a strong 
awareness of education and manned space flight." 
</P>
<P>
The ad doesn't even mention the space station by name, but briefly shows the 
station. "Some people here (at McDonnell Douglas) saw the ad and felt it was 
perhaps too subtle," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
The company refused to say how much it is spending on the ad campaign, but 
Williams said it will eat up a "large hunk" of the Space Systems 1989 
advertising budget. 
</P>
<P>
The Astro Baby ad began airing Monday on the Cable News Network. It will begin 
showing on the major networks Sunday, Mother's Day, on morning public affairs 
programs. The ad is scheduled to be aired through June. 
</P>
<P>
The ad also will be shown in select local TV stations in areas targeted for 
political reasons. Those areas include Baltimore; Baton Rouge, La.; Flint, 
Mich., Jackson, Miss., and Springfield, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore, for example, is the district of Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), 
who is chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that oversees NASA's 
budget. The ads will also air in the home district of Rep. Bob Traxler 
(D-Mich.), chairman of the House panel handling the NASA budget. 
</P>
<P>
"These are all areas where we wouldn't be disappointed if people contacted 
their congressmen," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas has a lot at stake with the space station program. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1987, a contracting team led by McDonnell Douglas Space Systems 
was awarded a $1.9-billion contract to build a major section of the space 
station. The contract involves construction of the station's external 
framework, air locks and internal working areas. The company already has 680 
people working on the space station and will hire several hundred more if the 
program continues to receive funding during the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
The company plans to move its space station employees into an 8-story office 
building that is being constructed specifically for the project near its 
Huntington Beach complex, at a cost of $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
Current plans are to begin launching sections of the station, which will be 
assembled in space, in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said the new ad intentionally takes a more low-key approach than the 
earlier "Reds" spot. 
</P>
<P>
"Reds was made to create an awareness that the Russians had their Mir manned 
space station in operation and the United States was lagging in space," 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
The networks viewed the Reds ad as controversial because it played up the "Red 
scare" theme reminiscent of the days of Sputnik more than 30 years ago. The 
Soviet launch of the Sputnik satellite in 1957 caught Americans by surprise and 
fueled fears that the Soviets had grabbed a technological lead.

New IBM Machines Expected: International Business Machines Corp. is expected to 
introduce new software and two new personal computers, one of which will mark 
its much awaited re-entry into the growing laptop computer market, analysts 
said. IBM's first laptop -- the "Convertible" model -- faltered in the 
intensely competitive market. But IBM has developed a long-awaited new version, 
as well as a desktop computer based on Intel Corp.'s 386SX chip. IBM is also 
preparing a range of software products, including systems to communicate 
between computers and carry out advanced office programming.

AMERICAN EXPRESS SAID TO BE INTERESTED IN OGILVY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Membership has its privileges, but maybe ownership has more. Even as the 
British marketing firm WPP Group raised its offer for Ogilvy Group to about 
$800 million Monday, word also surfaced on Wall Street that long-time client 
American Express may have talked with Ogilvy officials about buying the ad 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from Ogilvy and American Express refused to comment on that Monday. 
Ogilvy closed at $52 a share in over-the-counter trading Monday, up $2.125 from 
Friday's close. The new WPP offer, at $50 per share, was up from the previous 
$45 per share the company offered slightly more than one week ago. 
</P>
<P>
Ogilvy officials were not willing to comment on speculation from Wall Street 
analysts that American Express had shown interest in purchasing its ad agency 
of 17 years. "We've had a lot of expressions of interest," said Joele Frank, an 
Ogilvy spokeswoman. "I cannot comment on any of them." 
</P>
<P>
American Express executives also were mum. "We cannot comment on speculation," 
said Lawrence A. Armour, senior vice president of corporate communications at 
American Express. The New York-based company's chairman, James D. Robinson, was 
in Hong Kong on Monday, meeting with officials from the Travel Related Services 
division of American Express. He also was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
American Express is linked to Ogilvy in more ways than its advertising. The New 
York investment firm, Shearson Lehman Hutton, is 62% owned by American Express. 
And Shearson has been acting as one of Ogilvy's principal Wall Street advisers 
since WPP made its initial offer for Ogilvy. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street analysts say it would be an extremely unusual setup for a client to 
own its advertising agency. But one top advertising analyst, who asked not to 
be named, said: "There's no reason why something like this can't work. Everyone 
knows Ogilvy wants to be bought by anyone but WPP." In fact, said the analyst, 
"In Europe, situations where clients own their agencies are increasingly 
common." 
</P>
<P>
American Express is Ogilvy's largest client, and has been with the firm since 
1962. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, American Express posted net income of $773 million on revenue of 
about $7.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a WPP spokesman also declined to comment on the possibility of 
competing against American Express for Ogilvy. But a statement from WPP said 
that its new offer was made "to avoid unnecessary and potentially unsettling 
delay in the negotiation of a friendly transaction."

<P>
Stock prices fell in slow uneventful trading Monday, as the market took a 
breather to await fresh news on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials fell 5.49 points to end the day at 
2,376.47, its seventh consecutive decline. The blue chip indicator has lost 
42.52 points since April 28. 
</P>
<P>
The market opened lower on a carry-over from Friday's last-minute selloff and 
in response to a weaker bond market ahead of this week's three-day Treasury 
borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
Prices drifted lower during the session as many big participants withdrew to 
await new data on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"The market is resting, consolidating with a little profit taking," said 
Charles Jensen, chief technical analyst with MKI Securities Corp. "It's waiting 
for more evidence about what the economy is going to do." 
</P>
<P>
The government is scheduled to report on retail sales and producer prices later 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the market is concerned that producer prices could show that 
inflation is still a problem, which could lead to further credit tightening. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 2 to 1 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 969 issues down, 504 up and 485 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 135.13 million shares, down from 
180.81 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in 
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 
158.70 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo stocks climbed to a sixth straight record close Monday. The Nikkei index 
rose 180.25 points, or 0.53%, to a record close 34,135.24. It was the sixth 
straight record close for the Nikkei average and the seventh straight gain. 
</P>
<P>
In London, stocks skidded in late trading Monday to end the day with a loss. 
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed down 13.2 points, or 
0.6%, at 2,119.6, its lowest level of the day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose broadly in brisk U.S. trading as Federal Reserve intervention 
proved ineffective in deterring buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices fell in the United States, reversing course after rising modestly 
overseas. Republic National Bank of New York quoted an ounce of gold bullion at 
$375.40 as of 4 p.m. EDT, $1.60 lower than Friday's late bid. 
</P>
<P>
In U.S. trading, the dollar ended at 1.9097 marks, up from 1.8977 on Friday, 
and piercing what was described as an important technical threshold of 1.90 
marks. It was the highest closing level since August, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
A variety of factors fed the dollar's advance. Key catalysts were comments by 
the president of West Germany's central bank and the fact that the dollar 
remained above levels identified as significant from a technical standpoint, 
despite Fed intervention. 
</P>
<P>
Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl indicated that the dollar's value against 
other major currencies is a matter being decided by the markets and countries 
that would have to live with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Basel, Switzerland, after a regular meeting of the Group of 10 
central bankers, he said the dollar's strength is remarkable given the trade 
imbalances among leading industrialized countries. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange dealers interpreted his remarks to imply that government 
monetary authorities are unlikely to act aggressively to influence the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at 
$376.90, down from $377.70 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Copper futures prices tumbled on New York's Commodity Exchange following an 
unexpectedly large increase in warehouse stocks of copper reported by the 
London Metal Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, palladium surged while gold and silver prices slipped; energy 
futures plummeted; grains and soybeans were mostly lower; cattle futures 
dipped, and pork prices advanced. 
</P>
<P>
Copper settled 2.7 cents to 5.2 cents lower, with the spot contract for 
delivery in May at $1.259 a pound and the most active contract, for July 
delivery, at $1.216 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
A strong dollar and a reassessment of the government's latest employment 
figures pushed bond prices lower. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 3/8 point, or $3.75 for every $1,000 
in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, 
rose to 8.99% from 8.95% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Brusca, chief economist for Nikko Securities International Inc., said 
the market declined on a belief that a government report showing civilian 
unemployment up 0.3 percentage point at 5.3% was less positive than initially 
interpreted. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted late in the day at 9.75%, up from 9.8125% late Friday.

BRUCE HOROVITZ / MARKETING: SHARP VOICE STRIKES RIGHT CHORD IN RADIO ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you drove to work this morning, you probably heard Thom Sharp. And if you 
drive back home this evening, you'll probably hear him again. 
</P>
<P>
All you have to do is turn on your radio. 
</P>
<P>
He's the guy yacking on more radio spots these days than just about anyone. 
Remember that Nissan truck spot in which Sharp, a Sherman Oaks resident, tried 
to explain the difference between the reaction of a car owner and truck owner 
to someone leaning on their vehicle? "A car person would say, 'Excuse me sir, 
you're leaning on my truck,' " Sharp said in the radio ad. "A truck person 
would say, 'Hey dog arms, get off my truck.' " 
</P>
<P>
Why did Sharp, a former Detroit resident, record Nissan radio ads for nearly a 
year? "In Detroit, everyone on my block worked for Ford, so I always thought 
I'd stay away from foreign car spots," Sharp said. "But the fact is, I've been 
doing these radio voice-overs for eight years now and Ford's never called." 
</P>
<P>
Just about everyone else has. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp is also the guy who keeps trying to get radio listeners to subscribe to 
the Herald Examiner. In one recent radio spot set at a health club, he says: 
"If at any time while you're reading the Herald, you become short of breath or 
dizzy, don't worry. It probably just means your bicycle pants are locking up on 
you." 
</P>
<P>
And yes, he's also the fellow pitching that Tallon termite control which, he 
says in the radio ads, works by "freezing their little buns off." And 
nationwide, his radio ads in different regions pitch everything from a bank in 
Washington to the Minnesota North Stars hockey team. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Daihatsu is using Sharp's voice-overs in TV commercials airing nationwide. 
In one tongue-in-cheek ad, a Daihatsu owner walks into his garage late at night 
to "feed" his Daihatsu a slab of beef. Sharp -- who is heard but not seen in 
the commercial -- explains that this is how owners of the Daihatsu Charade can 
appease the car's "ferocious" new 16-valve engine. 
</P>
<P>
At a time advertisers everywhere are looking for a way to cut through the 
clutter, many are just discovering that the 41-year-old Sharp's neighborly 
radio voice may be a far more effective attention grabber than that of a 
high-priced celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom has created a space that wasn't there before," said Lorenzo Music, who is 
generally recognized as one of the top names in radio advertising. "He doesn't 
sound like an actor or an announcer. He's himself," said Music, who has 
recorded ads for everyone from McDonald's to the Queen Mary. 
</P>
<P>
There are so many sound-alike voices in radio these days that it's difficult to 
stand out at all, said Hal Riney, the San Francisco adman who may be best 
recognized for his warm, commercial voice-overs on Gallo wine spots. "There 
just aren't many good voices out there," said Riney, who admitted that he's 
never heard of Sharp. 
</P>
<P>
He will. Many advertising experts say Sharp's voice could eventually place him 
among the elite of radio broadcast advertising. "When you hire Tom, you're not 
just hiring his voice, you're hiring his mind, as well," said David Prince, 
senior radio producer at the Venice ad firm Chiat/Day, which picked Sharp as 
the radio spokesman for its biggest client, Nissan. "Some of our best bits are 
his ad-libs." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the one line in the Herald Examiner commercial about the "bicycle pants 
locking up on you," was one of Sharp's ad-libs. "He can sell you stuff, and 
you're not offended by the fact that he's selling it to you," said Scott Aal, a 
copywriter at Ketchum Advertising/Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Sharp's ad-libs can also spell trouble at some agencies. "Sure, the 
ad-libs almost always add something good to the copy," said Marvin Himelfarb, 
president of the Hot Spots, the Hollywood production company that has used 
Sharp in a number of ads. "But ad-libs can also drive clients up a wall. 
Remember, every time you make a change in the script, you need the client's 
approval." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps one reason Sharp likes to ad-lib so much in commercials is that he was 
once a copywriter himself. In fact, he worked for several Detroit ad firms, 
including one of the biggest in the Motor City, W. B. Doner. 
</P>
<P>
Then, 12 years ago, Sharp moved with his wife, Judy, to Los Angeles. He started 
doing stand-up comedy at the Ice House in Pasadena and within a few years was 
doing those same skits on the Tonight Show and the Merv Griffin Show. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike radio, television has not been very good to Sharp. Every major 
network has canceled a series that Sharp has appeared in, including ABC's 
"Half-Hour Comedy Hour," where he was a co-host; NBC's "Sweet Surrender," where 
he played a sports medicine doctor, and CBS's "First Impressions," where he 
played an adman. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't last very long," Sharp said, "but the odds of getting on TV, getting 
your own show and staying on the air are probably one in six trillion." 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, Sharp is trying again. But this time he's just trying to sell his 
voice -- not his face. Last Friday he auditioned for the part of a talking 
lizard -- "Larry Lizard" to be precise -- in an NBC pilot for an animated TV 
series. 
</P>
<P>
Television, after all, is where the money is. Whereas Sharp pulls in about $300 
for each radio spot he does, he could make many times that as a television 
spokesman. And any TV series that clicks, of course, would offer the biggest 
payday of all. But, insists Sharp, "I'd rather be in a good commercial than in 
a lousy TV series." 
</P>
<P>
Because his radio voice has been so heavily exposed in the Los Angeles market, 
he has even turned down some offers. Last year, the San Bernardino mountain ski 
resort Bear Mountain asked him to do a series of radio spots. But his Nissan 
radio ads were already blanketing the airwaves. "There's a risk in doing too 
many things in one market," Sharp said. "No one wants to hear wall-to-wall me." 
</P>
<P>
Then, again, maybe they do. His agent says she gets four to five calls daily 
from advertisers who want Sharp. "He rarely has a day off," said Rita Vennari, 
co-owner of the Los Angeles commercial talent agency, Sutton, Barth &amp; 
Vennari. "But sometimes you get scared when someone says to you, 'I hear him 
all the time.' " 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry, said Rich Kapnick, a Hollywood media marketing consultant, who 
specializes in broadcast advertising. "His kind of personality is so warm and 
affable," Kapnick said, "that the more you hear him, the more you like him." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, financial institutions like Sharp. He's recently done ads for five 
of them in four states. But Sharp refuses to do any political ads, "unless 
McGovern decides to run again for President," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The one ad he most regrets doing was a TV commercial a few years ago for 
Kellogg's Nutra Grain cereal, where the balding Sharp was persuaded to wear a 
toupee. Said Sharp: "I looked like I was wearing a member of the animal kingdom 
on my head." 
</P>
<P>
Although his voice is his glory, Sharp doesn't like to hear it on the air. 
"Sometimes I think I sound too gooney," he said. Recently, however, while 
sitting in his dentist's chair, he heard one of his Herald Examiner ads piped 
into the office. 
</P>
<P>
"I was getting a crown put in, so I couldn't talk," Sharp said, "but I started 
to move around in the chair." Thinking that something was wrong, the dentist 
stopped drilling -- then heard the commercial that featured the patient's 
voice. 
</P>
<P>
How impressed was the dentist? He resumed his drilling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Banks Certainly Don't Find This Ad Beneficial 
</P>
<P>
Not many firms would take much comfort in being linked in TV commercials with 
Libyan leader Col. Moammar Kadafi, former Philippines President Ferdinand E. 
Marcos or Panama's military strongman, Gen. Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Especially not American banks. 
</P>
<P>
But a biting ad campaign for Beneficial Corp., the Wilmington, Del.-based 
finance company, says that while banks have loaned billions of dollars to these 
corrupt, foreign leaders, Beneficial would rather loan money to American 
families. 
</P>
<P>
The ad begins with a picture of a smiling Kadafi. A voice-over says, "Over the 
years, U.S. banks have loaned $20 million to people like this." Next a picture 
of Marcos and the voice says, "$5.7 billion to people like this." And then a 
photo of Noriega, "$3 billion to people like this." The ad ends with a shot of 
a happy family, as a father hoists his young daughter into the air. "But for 75 
years, we've always believed it was more important to lend money to people like 
this. Beneficial. We're not a bank, so we don't have to act like one." 
</P>
<P>
The ad, which last week won the top prize at the 25th Andy Awards presented by 
the Advertising Club of New York, was created by the New York ad firm Levine, 
Huntley, Schmidt &amp; Beaver. "It may not make everybody happy," said its 
chairman, Robert Schmidt, "but it talks to the people we're trying to talk to." 
</P>
<P>
The ad surely hasn't won any prizes in banking circles; several have mailed or 
telephoned complaints to Beneficial. And the Washington-based American Bankers 
Assn. recently mailed a letter of protest to the Federal Trade Commission, 
requesting that the ad be pulled. "The ad is a blatant misrepresentation," said 
Allan Paro, director of advertising for the ABA. "The banks didn't loan the 
money to dictators. They loaned it to their countries. I can't imagine anyone 
who would give $5 million to Marcos. How would you explain that to your board 
of directors?"

APPROVAL FOR U.S. SALE OF AMGEN'S DRUG IS STALLED; 
</P>
<P>
FOR KIDNEY PATIENTS, RELIEF IS IN OVERSEAS MAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY STAVRO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The drug comes by mail order, a clear liquid in slender ampuls, carefully 
packed in dry ice. 
</P>
<P>
The precious cargo begins its 6,500-mile journey from a pharmacy in 
Switzerland, travels bySwissair to Boston's Logan Airport and from there takes 
its final hop by Federal Express to a medical clinic in Pasadena. There, Warren 
Bacon, 72, who suffers from kidney disease, gets injections of a new 
biotechnology drug called erythropoietin that has helped transform his life. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Nita, said that before the three-times-a-week treatments began in 
February her husband "never had any energy. He'd just sit with his head in his 
hands most of the day"; his life was like the "living dead." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Mrs. Bacon says, "the change in this man is incredible. He has much more 
energy. He swims, he's started riding his bicycle, he cooks, he works in the 
garden. Now he may have one bad day in six or 10." 
</P>
<P>
Valerie Buhler, 65, another Pasadena resident who has kidney disease, got her 
first mail-order package of EPO from West Germany in March. She is on a 
twice-a-week injection schedule, being treated locally by her doctor. Before, 
"running a few errands just tired me out," she said. "The difference has been 
remarkable. I don't sleep all afternoon. I have energy and zest for life. I'm 
planning to take a cruise and go to Hawaii." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expensive Import 
</P>
<P>
The mail-order service is not cheap. Buhler pays $650 a month for her EPO 
supply, Bacon about $1,200. Not a penny is covered by their insurance. The drug 
is manufactured in the United Kingdom under license by a fledgling 
biotechnology company called Amgen, which has its own new EPO factory in 
Thousand Oaks, a mere 45 miles from where Buhler and Bacon live. But that 
factory might as well be in Antarctica. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that EPO can't legally be sold in this country -- at least not 
yet. The drug has won rave reviews for its clinical test results, even in the 
prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, and in February the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration was all but set to approve EPO for sale. Then a messy legal 
squabble between Amgen and its marketing partner erupted, postponing FDA 
approval indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
So Buhler, Bacon and a growing number of kidney disease patients who have grown 
impatient are importing the drug themselves. Remarkably, it's all perfectly 
legal, thanks to an obscure 30-year-old FDA policy that allows individuals to 
import drugs that are sold overseas so long as they are for personal use and in 
amounts no larger than a three-month supply. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michael Linsey, a Pasadena nephrologist who administers EPO to Bacon and 
Buhler, has been impressed by how well they feel. "It's a very good drug," he 
said. Linsey has heard about the many clinical tests on EPO: "Everyone has 
reported exceptional results with few side effects." 
</P>
<P>
Buhler and Bacon aren't alone. Susan Burkhart, a supervisor with a Pasadena 
kidney dialysis clinic, said that at a meeting last month of the California 
Dialysis Council, about 20 clinics said they were treating patients who bought 
EPO from overseas. 
</P>
<P>
About 80,000 people in the United States suffer from kidney failure and need 
dialysis to cleanse their blood of impurities; more than 20,000 of them also 
need frequent blood transfusions and suffer chronic anemia. 
</P>
<P>
EPO can help those 20,000 patients. The drug triggers production of red blood 
cells that transport oxygen throughout the body. In EPO clinical tests, 97% of 
the patients found that they no longer need blood transfusions. Moreover, much 
of their old energy returned. 
</P>
<P>
However, higher blood pressure has occasionally been a side effect of EPO and 
patients still need dialysis treatments, so physicians must monitor their 
condition closely. 
</P>
<P>
Denise Gilbert, an analyst with Montgomery Securities, pegs the domestic EPO 
market at $450 million a year by the early 1990s; other analysts say the annual 
EPO market could reach $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Amgen struck a deal with a larger company, Johnson &amp; Johnson, to 
help pay for EPO research. Under the agreement, Amgen would keep domestic 
rights to the EPO market for kidney dialysis patients, a J&amp;J subsidiary 
would sell EPO for any other use in this country and J&amp;J would get all 
rights to the European market. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, Amgen agreed to include J&amp;J's medical data when it applied 
for FDA approval. Unfortunately, the two partners kept squabbling over, among 
other things, the amount and the price of the EPO J&amp;J would buy from Amgen. 
Finally Amgen refused to file J&amp;J's documents. Last winter, when the FDA 
was about to give Amgen approval to sell EPO, J&amp;J sued. In March, a federal 
judge in Delaware ordered Amgen to amend its FDA application and include 
J&amp;J's data, and that put a brake on the FDA's approval. Analyst Gilbert 
guesses that the FDA will approve EPO for kidney dialysis patients by June, but 
no one really knows how long it will take. 
</P>
<P>
So some patients have made it their business to master the FDA's obscure import 
policy, which came back into focus last summer when FDA Commissioner Frank 
Young, under pressure because of the AIDS epidemic, reaffirmed the policy. 
</P>
<P>
He acted in part because of a rush of imports of dextran sulphate, a 
20-year-old Japanese drug used to treat high cholesterol. When some lab tests 
showed that the drug can slow the AIDS virus, anxious patients in the United 
States began ordering the drug and soon a flood of dextran sulphate was 
intercepted here by confused Post Office and Customs officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We allow individuals to bring in personal-use quantities of drugs available 
overseas, provided the drug is not on our list of things that are clearly 
fraudulent or dangerous," says FDA spokesman Brad Stone. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Students of Disease 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, when Bacon was stricken with kidney disease, he lost 30 pounds 
in a month, and, Mrs. Bacon said, "it's been downhill all the way." When the 
EPO delays began, the Bacons turned to a friend who was traveling abroad. The 
friend contacted a sympathetic Swiss doctor who asked for Mr. Bacon's medical 
history. Last winter, Mrs. Bacon said, "I received a wire from this pharmacy in 
Switzerland" which offered to ship the drug directly to a medical clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Much like Bacon, Valerie Buhler has become a student of her disease. Her kidney 
problems were first diagnosed in 1978, and gradually her energy level dwindled. 
"I'd always been a very active person so it was very devastating." 
</P>
<P>
EPO is a protein produced in small amounts in the kidneys. Until recently, the 
problem for medical science was that the body could not produce enough EPO to 
correct kidney-function problems. Gene resplicing technology can now prompt the 
production of needed rare hormones and proteins such as EPO. 
</P>
<P>
Since last summer, EPO has gone on sale in such European countries as France, 
West Germany and Switzerland, so Buhler got in touch with a friend at the 
University of Munich. Eventually, a West German pharmacy agreed to sell her the 
drug. When the first package arrived two months ago, she was a bit nervous 
about whether the drug would really help. In a week she felt the difference. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pension Helps 
</P>
<P>
But Buhler is reluctant to tell other patients about her good fortune. She 
manages to pay for her EPO supply with the help of her late husband's pension, 
but she said many other kidney patients couldn't afford the drug. "Most people 
on dialysis are on Medi-Cal and it's still a terribly expensive thing," she 
said. "They live such a limited life. I don't want to tell them how great I 
feel." 
</P>
<P>
Warren Bacon, a retired furniture designer, must dig even deeper to pay for the 
drug. An EPO dosage varies, in part, according to the patient's size. At 
6-feet-2, Bacon needs a lot more of the drug than Buhler, who is 5-feet-2. 
Bacon faces a $14,000-a-year bill and is eager not only for the FDA to approve 
EPO and hopes Medicare will pick up most of the costs for the drug. 
</P>
<P>
For now, Mrs. Bacon enjoys receiving an occasional Swiss postcard from her 
friendly, distant pharmacist. "Of course he's making a profit," she noted. But 
if you love your husband and his life is fuller than it has been in years, 
there is no choice, she said. "I'll keep buying it until it's released here," 
she said.

SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen seven straight days and investors 
and institutions are sitting on the sidelines trying to determine what the 
future portends, according to Irving Katz, director of research for Thomas 
Green/San Diego Securities. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Elliott Wave guru Robert Prechter, who partially predicted that the 
market would move up during the 1980s, now has joined the "gloom- and 
doom-sayers" who are forecasting a severe depression, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego stocks remained oblivious, however, with nine stocks recording new 
yearly highs the past week. 
</P>
<P>
Price Co. responded to pressure from analysts and shareholders by dropping a 
planned new class of convertible preferred stock. Price instead will issue a 
one-time $1.50 cash dividend. The stock reached a new high of $43.50 and gained 
$2.25 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
Other new highs were attained by Mail Boxes Etc., $19; PS Group, $37.25; BSD 
Bancorp, $8.875; First National Corp., $17.375; Beeba's Creations, $11.75; DH 
Technology, $10.50; Maxwell Laboratories, $13.50, and PSICOR, $11.75. 
</P>
<P>
Good gains were also made by Molecular Biosystems, up $1.50, and Monitor Labs, 
which gained $.50. 
</P>
<P>
The only new low for the week was made by Gen-Probe at $2.875. 
</P>
<P>
Annual meetings this week include Titan Corp. today and Medical Imaging Centers 
of America on Thursday.

KIDNEY PATIENTS SKIRT FDA DELAY BY FLYING DRUG IN FROM EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY STAVRO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The drug comes by mail order, a clear liquid packed in slender ampules, then 
carefully insulated in dry ice. 
</P>
<P>
The package begins a 6,500-mile journey from a pharmacy in Switzerland, travels 
by Swissair to Boston's Logan Airport and, after being loaded onto a Federal 
Express jet, is flown to a medical clinic in Pasadena. There, Warren Bacon, 72, 
who suffers from kidney disease, gets injections of a new biotechnology drug 
called erythropoietin (EPO) that has helped transform his life. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Nita, said that before the three-times-a-week treatments began in 
February, her husband "never had any energy. He'd just sit with his head in his 
hands most of the day," and his life was like the "living dead." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Nita Bacon said, "The change in this man is incredible. He has much more 
energy. He swims, he's started riding his bicycle, he cooks, he works in the 
garden. Now he may have one bad day in 6 or 10." 
</P>
<P>
Valerie Buhler, 65, another Pasadena resident who suffers from kidney disease, 
got her first mail-order package of EPO from West Germany in March. She is on a 
twice-a-week schedule, with the drug administered by her doctor. Before, 
"running a few errands just tired me out," she said. "The difference has been 
remarkable. I don't sleep all afternoon. I have energy and zest for life. I'm 
planning to take a cruise and go to Hawaii." 
</P>
<P>
Buhler pays $650 a month for her EPO supply, Bacon about $1,200. Not a penny is 
covered by their insurance. The drug is manufactured in the United Kingdom 
under license by a fledgling biotechnology company called Amgen, which has its 
own new EPO factory in Thousand Oaks, a mere 45 miles from where Buhler and 
Bacon live. But that factory might as well be in Antarctica. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that EPO isn't legally for sale in this country -- at least not 
yet. The drug has won rave reviews for its clinical test results, including in 
the New England Journal of Medicine, and in February the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration was all but set to approve EPO for sale. Then a messy legal 
squabble erupted between Amgen and its marketing partner, postponing FDA 
approval indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
So Buhler, Bacon and a growing number of kidney disease patients who have had 
their fill of waiting are importing the drug themselves. Remarkably, it's all 
perfectly legal thanks to an obscure 30-year-old FDA policy that allows 
individuals to import drugs that are sold overseas so long as they are for 
personal use and in amounts no larger than a three-month supply. 
</P>
<P>
"Since my husband developed kidney problems, we'd heard about this drug. They 
kept telling us momentarily this drug would be released," Nita Bacon said. The 
FDA's delay "is ludicrous," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wishes Others Could Get Drug 
</P>
<P>
Said Buhler: "I can't say I feel guilty I'm getting the drug. I just wish all 
these other people could get it." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michael S. Linsey, a Pasadena nephrologist who administers EPO to Bacon and 
Buhler, has been impressed by how well they feel. "It's a very good drug," he 
said. Linsey has heard about the many clinical tests of EPO. "Everyone has 
reported exceptional results with few side effects," and he feels comfortable 
suggesting that other patients consider buying the drug by mail. 
</P>
<P>
Buhler and Bacon aren't alone. Susan Burkhart, a supervisor at a Pasadena 
kidney dialysis clinic, said that at a meeting last month of the California 
Dialysis 
</P>
<P>
Council about 20 clinics said they were treating patients who bought EPO from 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Amgen spokesman Mark Brand said: "The Zurich airport pharmacy has quite a 
little EPO business going" to travelers headed to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
All this activity is easy to explain. In the dialysis community, the advance 
word on EPO is that it offers a better life. Patients and physicians are 
excited because it is a drug for which there is no alternative. About 80,000 
patients in this country suffer from kidney failure and need dialysis to 
cleanse their blood of impurities; more than 20,000 of them also need frequent 
blood transfusions and suffer chronic anemia. 
</P>
<P>
EPO can help those 20,000 patients. A protein produced in minuscule amounts in 
the kidneys, EPO triggers production of red blood cells that transport oxygen 
throughout the body. The problem until recently has been how to obtain enough 
of it. In biotechnology, scientists play medical detectives who, by resplicing 
genes that contain the blueprints of life, can trigger laboratory production of 
rare hormones and proteins. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Much Energy Returns 
</P>
<P>
In EPO clinical tests, 97% of the patients no longer need blood transfusions, 
and much of their old energy returns. Higher blood pressure is an occasional 
side effect of the drug, and patients still need dialysis treatments so their 
condition must be closely monitored. Last week, Warren Bacon had a one-day 
setback when fluid built up from his dialysis treatment. But for most patients, 
getting EPO is like pumping high test into your tank. 
</P>
<P>
EPO also shows promise in combating anemia from chemotherapy and liver disease, 
and it's being tested in concert with the AIDS drug AZT in hopes of minimizing 
anemia. Denise Gilbert, an analyst with Montgomery Securities, pegs the 
domestic EPO market at $450 million a year by the early 1990s; other analysts 
say the annual EPO market will hit $2 billion. With a dollar to be made from 
the drug, the action has shifted from the laboratory to the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Amgen is a modest company that struck a deal in 1985 with a mighty one, Johnson 
&amp; Johnson, to help pay for EPO research. Amgen would keep domestic rights 
to the EPO market for kidney dialysis patients, a J&amp;J subsidiary could sell 
EPO for any other use in this country, plus J&amp;J would get all rights to the 
European market. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, Amgen agreed to include J&amp;J's medical data when it applied 
for FDA approval. The two partners kept squabbling about, among other things, 
how much EPO that J&amp;J would buy from Amgen and at what price. Finally, 
Amgen refused to file J&amp;J's documents. By last winter, when the FDA was 
about to give Amgen the green light to sell EPO, J&amp;J sued. Amgen believes 
that J&amp;J was worried that doctors would start prescribing EPO for all 
manner of treatments and that would cost J&amp;J sales. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Amendment Ordered 
</P>
<P>
In March, a federal judge in Delaware ordered Amgen to amend its FDA 
application and include J&amp;J's data, and that put a brake on the FDA's 
approval. Analyst Gilbert guesses that the FDA will approve EPO for kidney 
dialysis patients by June, but no one really knows how long it will take. 
</P>
<P>
So some crafty patients have made it their business to master the FDA's obscure 
import policy, which came into focus last summer when FDA Commissioner Frank 
Young, under pressure because of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
epidemic, reaffirmed the policy. 
</P>
<P>
He was moved in part by a rush of imports of dextran sulphate, a 20-year-old 
Japanese drug that is used to treat high cholesterol. When some lab tests 
showed that the drug can slow the AIDS virus, anxious patients in the United 
States began ordering the drug, and soon a flood of dextran sulphate was 
intercepted by confused postal and customs officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We allow individuals to bring in personal-use quantities of drugs available 
overseas, provided the drug is not on our list of things that are clearly 
fraudulent or dangerous," said FDA spokesman Brad Stone. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA's contraband list contains about 40 items, including Laetrile, the 
controversial cancer drug made from apricot pits. But EPO isn't on the list, 
and that was the window of opportunity that Warren Bacon needed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lost 30 Pounds 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, when Bacon was stricken with kidney disease, he lost 30 pounds 
in a month. "It's been downhill all the way," said his wife. When the EPO 
delays began, the Bacons turned to a friend who was traveling abroad. The 
friend contacted a sympathetic Swiss doctor who asked for Bacon's medical 
history. Last winter, Nita Bacon said, "I received a wire from this pharmacy in 
Switzerland" that offered to ship the drug directly to a medical clinic. She 
checked with customs officials, then she sent $600 for her husband's first 
batch of EPO. 
</P>
<P>
Much like Bacon, Valerie Buhler has become a student of her disease. Her kidney 
problems were first diagnosed in 1978 and gradually her energy level dwindled. 
"I'd always been a very active person so it was very devastating," she said. 
Her doctors mentioned EPO. "All the doctors told me it was supposed to be 
released by the end of last year. But I knew this thing would go on forever." 
</P>
<P>
Since last summer, EPO has been on sale in France, Germany and Switzerland, 
among other European countries, so Buhler got in touch with a friend at the 
University of Munich and eventually a German pharmacy agreed to sell her the 
drug. When the first package arrived two months ago, she was a bit nervous 
about whether the drug would really help. In a week, she felt the difference. 
</P>
<P>
But Buhler hesitates before telling other patients about her good fortune. She 
manages to pay for her EPO supply with the help of her late husband's pension, 
but for many other kidney patients, she said, buying EPO out of their own 
pocket would be too much. "Most people on dialysis are on Medi-Cal and it's 
still a terribly expensive thing," she said. "They live such a limited life. I 
don't want to tell them how great I feel." 
</P>
<P>
Warren Bacon, a retired furniture designer, has to dig even deeper to pay for 
the drug. An EPO dosage varies, in part, according to the patient's size. At 
6-foot-2, Bacon needs a lot more of the drug than Buhler, who is 5-foot-2. At 
this rate Bacon faces a $14,000-a-year bill and he is eager not only for the 
FDA to hurry up and approve EPO, but hopes Medicare will pick up most of the 
costs for the drug. 
</P>
<P>
For now, Nita Bacon enjoys receiving an occasional Swiss postcard from her 
friendly, distant pharmacist. "Of course he's making a profit," she noted. But 
if you love your husband and his life is fuller than in years, there is no 
choice. "I'll keep buying it until it's released here," she said.

AVERAGE PRICE OF HOUSE REACHES RECORD $289,700 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The local housing market set record prices for single-family houses and 
condominiums in April, according to the San Fernando Valley Board of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
The average price for a single-family house rose to $289,700 in April, up 5% 
from the March average of $276,600, and bested the previous high of $280,200 
set in December. April's average price marked a 24% jump since April, 1988. 
Last month, 1,202 single-family houses were sold, an increase of less than 1% 
from March. 
</P>
<P>
Condominiums, which haven't matched the appreciation levels of single-family 
houses, set a record average price of $140,500 in April, breaking the record of 
$134,900 set in March. Last month's average condominium price marked a 19% 
increase from April, 1988. Last month, 402 condominiums were sold, down from 
439 units in March. 
</P>
<P>
Although the sales figures continue to be impressive, mortgage rates have 
continued to climb in recent months and a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage now 
carries an interest rate between 11% and 12%, up from 10% to 11% late last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Buddy Bernard, president of the Valley realty board, said he expects 
condominium demand to hold strong for the rest of the year because condominiums 
remain relatively affordable for first-time buyers who can't afford a 
single-family house. 
</P>
<P>
He also said the market for single-family houses appears to be quieting a bit. 
"The days of five, six or seven offers on a single property appear to be 
ending," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley realty board, California's largest, reports sales of houses and 
condominiums by its members in the area from North Hollywood to Agoura. Its 
statistics do not include most new residences, which generally are not sold by 
real estate agents, or sales by homeowners who sell their homes without agents.

CITADEL CHAIRMAN FACES TEST ON VALLEY FEDERAL DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Less than two months into his new job as chairman of Citadel Holding Corp., 
Edward L. Kane faces a nagging problem. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether Citadel, the Glendale holding company for Fidelity Federal 
Savings &amp; Loan, should go ahead with its tentative plans to pursue a 
takeover of sickly Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Citadel is struggling with lower profits, which the company blames on the 
recent increase in interest rates. But some analysts say that Kane has 
inherited one of the strongest and most efficient S&amp;Ls in the nation, and 
that it could sharply improve the profitability of Valley Federal by applying 
Citadel's low-overhead techniques there. 
</P>
<P>
Citadel's "financial characteristics are superb," said Jonathan Gray, an 
analyst with the investment firm Sanford C. Bernstein in New York. He said 
Citadel's name "is as much a description as an appellation." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Citadel, with $4.8 billion in assets and 33 branch offices, still has its 
critics. Other analysts say that even though higher interest rates are 
troubling most thrifts, Citadel's management is without a decisive strategy to 
make the company a standout in years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a 'me-too' savings and loan," said Gerald S. Haims of Seidler Amdec 
Securities in Los Angeles. "They're just treading water." He also said Kane, a 
51-year-old lawyer who used to work on Wall Street, was elected chairman 
because "there's nobody really strong within" Citadel with S&amp;L management 
credentials. 
</P>
<P>
Kane and Samuel C. McCarver, Citadel's chief operating and financial officer, 
vigorously disputed such claims. They noted that Kane had been vice chairman of 
Citadel since January, 1987, has been a Citadel director since 1985 and briefly 
filled in as president in early 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Kane "certainly was the most qualified and certainly a very logical candidate 
for the position," McCarver said. 
</P>
<P>
James F. Wilson, an analyst with Sutro &amp; Co. in San Francisco, agreed that 
the company needs "a larger management crew" because "Kane is not an operator, 
and has no background in the S&amp;L business." He said Citadel is "looking for 
either a new chief executive or a new No. 2 man, someone to work with 
McCarver." 
</P>
<P>
But now that Kane is chairman, he wants to make a decision on Valley Federal. 
"I will personally try to see if we can't either consummate something or 
terminate" the merger plans, he said. "It's silly to keep going along this 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Citadel has talked about the merger for more than two years. Kane likes the 
match, believing that it would make Citadel "the predominant lender" in the San 
Fernando Valley residential real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
No deal has yet been struck because, among other things, Valley Federal, with 
$3.4 billion in assets and 45 branches, had been resisting Citadel's overtures. 
Valley Federal did say two weeks ago that it would consider a firm offer, 
however. But Valley Federal's worsening condition -- it lost $3 million last 
year -- has forced Citadel to take a longer, harder look. New thrift 
legislation working its way through Congress has also given Citadel pause. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inherited Problems 
</P>
<P>
Kane also inherits some problems at Citadel. The thrift's profit fell 3% in 
1987 and 15% last year, and it "will be substantially lower" in 1989 because of 
the recent rise in interest rates, Kane said. 
</P>
<P>
Kane said the interest-rate increases are occurring much faster than Citadel 
can successfully boost the interest rate that it charges on home mortgages. 
Most of Citadel's mortgages have adjustable rates that change with market 
conditions, but those ARMs are tied to an interest-rate index whose changes lag 
those of money-market rates, he said. As a result, the difference between 
Citadel's interest income and its interest costs is rapidly narrowing, and so 
is its profit. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Citadel's earnings fell to $24.1 million from $28.2 million in 1987. 
Last week, Citadel said its first-quarter 1989 profit tumbled 51% from a year 
earlier, to $3 million from $6.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Citadel's return on average assets -- a key gauge of profitability because it 
measures a thrift's performance relative to the assets at its disposal -- was 
0.58% last year, well below the 1% ratio that is considered an excellent 
showing. Citadel has plenty of company, though; the average ROA in California 
last year was a mere 0.20%, according to Sheshunoff Information Services, a 
financial research firm in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stock Low 
</P>
<P>
Citadel's stock, now at $36.50 a share on the American Stock Exchange, remains 
35% below its level of three years ago. The stock also is 37% below Citadel's 
book value per share, or its net worth, which is the amount of Citadel's assets 
minus its liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks trading well below book value in many industries are considered to be 
bargains. However, these days many S&amp;Ls trade at discounts to book value 
because investors are worried about the serious problems throughout the thrift 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
But analyst Gray said Citadel remains a bargain, particularly if interest rates 
fall in the next three or four years, which would send Citadel's profit soaring 
because of the S&amp;L's low-cost structure. Citadel's stock "looks like a 
two-seater Mercedes convertible priced like a Ford Taurus with 40,000 miles on 
it," Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
Sutro's Wilson agreed that when interest rates finally turn down, Citadel "will 
be benefiting more than others" because its overhead costs amounted to a mere 
1.16% of its assets at year-end 1988 -- the second lowest among the 20 West 
Coast S&amp;Ls that he follows. Only Golden West Financial, a perennial 
low-cost operator, had a lower ratio at 1.14%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loan Portfolio 
</P>
<P>
Citadel's loan portfolio is also relatively strong. Its repossessed real estate 
-- indicating Citadel loans that went sour -- totaled 0.4% of its total assets 
at year-end 1988, compared with an average 0.7% for California thrifts and 1.8% 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Citadel's "non-performing assets," which include the repossessions and existing 
loans 90 days past due, fell to 0.74% of assets at year-end from 1.03% two 
years earlier. That drop came even as Citadel's assets jumped 42% in the past 
two years. "Our savings and loan business, in my judgment, is second to none 
among our peers," Kane said. 
</P>
<P>
There is a perception by some analysts that Kane is sharing power with James J. 
Cotter, a Los Angeles investor with a hand in many companies, including 
Citadel. Cotter is a former Citadel director and chairman of Craig Corp., whose 
holdings include an 8.5% stake in Citadel and control of the Stater Bros. 
grocery chain. Cotter also is a partner of Hecco Ventures, an investment 
partnership that owns 9% of Citadel and about 10% of Valley Federal. Kane 
serves as Craig's president. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proxy Fight 
</P>
<P>
Cotter left Citadel's board last year after winning a bitter proxy fight to 
gain a seat on Valley Federal's board of directors and has urged Valley 
Federal's sale to Citadel or another party. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said Kane's election as Citadel's chairman means "Cotter is in charge" 
at Citadel. 
</P>
<P>
Cotter did not return telephone calls requesting comment. 
</P>
<P>
Citadel remains a closely held company. About 60% of Citadel's stock is owned 
by half a dozen big investors, including Tucson Electric Power, which owns 20%; 
Hecco and Craig, and the group has "a hand in directing our philosophy," Kane 
said. That philosophy calls for Citadel to keep growing with the help of 
acquisitions -- even if the Valley Federal deal falls through. 
</P>
<P>
Recently Citadel has gone shopping but its purchases have been small. Citadel 
has agreed to buy tiny Rancho Bernardo Savings ($130 million in assets) as a 
first step into the San Diego market, and has bought several branch offices 
from other S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
Citadel is also considering providing customers with expanded investment and 
insurance services, and may sell more of its mortgage loans to investors to 
generate more earnings. 
</P>
<P>
But the Valley Federal matter likely will be Kane's first big test. "The 
economics are there, the synergies are there" for a successful merger, he said. 
The deal will depend on whether Citadel gets there with the right offer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMPARING S&amp;L STOCK PRICES AND BOOK VALUES 
</P>
<P>
Below are the per-share stock prices of various California S&amp;Ls as a 
percentage of their book values per share. Book value is the amount of a 
thrift's assets less its liabilities, or its net worth. Investors often use the 
stock-book value ratio to gauge whether the stock is a bargain or overpriced. 
It's often thought that a stock trading below its book value falls into the 
bargain category. But as the chart shows, these days many S&amp;Ls trade at 
discounts to book value, in large part because investors are worried about the 
nationwide S&amp;L crisis.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: CLASSICAL MUSIC; 
</P>
<P>
GROSSMONT CHOIR TO JOIN THE SOVIET-BOUND SWARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego County's obsession with the Soviet Union shows no sign of abating. At 
the end of this month, an elite choir from La Mesa's Grossmont High School will 
spend a week performing at high schools in Leningrad and Tallinn. Music 
instructor Ed Basilio, who directs the 17-voice Grossmont Choir Ensemble, put 
the trip together after San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor made her arts 
expedition to the Soviet Union last summer. 
</P>
<P>
"We received a letter of endorsement from her," Basilio explained, "and then 
contacted high schools in the Soviet Union through their Intourist service. Our 
students will be staying in homes of Soviet students while they are there, 
which is one of the aspects they are really looking forward to." 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time the Grossmont Choir Ensemble has embarked on an 
ambitious tour. Last year Basilio took his charges to a choral festival in 
Orlando, Fla., and five years ago they sang at another festival in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a 63-year musical tradition here, and we've always had a high standard 
of performance," said Basilio, who has been at the school for only three years. 
He explained that his select group, which is an honors course, is populated 
primarily by juniors and seniors who have progressed through Grossmont's other 
choral organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these students have come up through the feeder choirs in the area 
junior high schools. They all read music, which is necessary since we perform 
music at college level difficulty," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Although six adults will act as chaperones on the Soviet trip, Basilio will 
accompany his group on the piano, saving the expense of an accompanist. The 
musical program he has chosen to take to the Soviet Union includes the Faure 
Requiem, a group of American songs by Aaron Copland, settings of Negro 
spirituals, and a choreographed excerpt from Andrew Lloyd Webber's current 
stage hit "Phantom of the Opera." Basilio will lead a program of sacred music 
taken from the tour repertory at St. Martin's Catholic Church, La Mesa, on May 
22 at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont High School's elaborate music program contrasts with the meager 
offerings of many San Diego high schools. 
</P>
<P>
"It's shocking that the program has survived, but having a solid musical 
tradition here has helped. Most schools were wiped out musically after the 
passage of Proposition 13," Basilio said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mark of Zorro." One of the San Diego Symphony's more successful 
innovations has been its Nickelodeon Series, which has presented classic silent 
films accompanied by theater organist Dennis James and members of the 
orchestra. The popularity of this Symphony Hall series has made tickets 
extremely scarce for the May 13 showing of Douglas Fairbanks' "The Black 
Pirate," which is this season's final Nickelodeon offering. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets should be no problem, however, for James' accompaniment of another 
Fairbanks classic, "The Mark of Zorro," which he will play July 24 at the 
outdoor Spreckels Organ pavilion in Balboa Park. This performance will be 
sponsored by the recently formed Spreckels Organ Society as part of its Monday 
evening summer concert series on the park's unique outdoor pipe organ. The 
globe-trotting James, now plying his off-beat trade in France, spent the winter 
months performing in Australia and New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
The Return of Gustavo. San Diego Chamber Orchestra's recently announced 1989-90 
Sherwood Series turns out to be a 21-gun salute to San Diego talent. Not 
surprisingly, Chula Vista's most famous native son, pianist Gustavo Romero, 
will make his annual appearance with maestro Donald Barra's chamber orchestra 
March 12, 1990. Another Romero of note, although not related to Gustavo, 
classical guitarist Angel Romero will be the featured soloist on the 
orchestra's April 23, 1990, concert. Igor Gruppman, the violinist with a 
virtual monopoly on local concertmaster posts, will appear with his wife, Vesna 
Gruppman, on the Feb. 19, 1990, program. 
</P>
<P>
Although the remaining soloists have no local connections, the list is 
impressive. Pianist Cecile Licad, who performed last year at Symphony Hall with 
the visiting Scottish Chamber Orchestra, will open the new season Nov. 20. Los 
Angeles Chamber Orchestra's principal oboe, Allen Vogel, who soloed with the 
San Diego Symphony last weekend, will grace the Jan. 29, 1990, concert under 
guest conductor JoAnn Falletta. Barra will be on the podium for the other four 
subscription concerts. 
</P>
<P>
The Return of Pinkerton. San Diego Opera general director Ian Campbell was not 
exactly going out on a limb when he added another performance of Puccini's 
ever-popular "Madama Butterfly," this season's final opera offering. Sure 
enough, when all the seats were counted, the figures showed that San Diegans 
filled Civic Theatre all five nights. Five Civic Theatre performances can 
accommodate about 14,510 people, and, according to the opera office, a total of 
14,500 saw Puccini's favorite heroine sacrifice herself because of her fateful 
marriage to a caddish American Naval officer. 
</P>
<P>
The real test, however, will be whether or not Campbell and his crew can work 
the same magic with all five performances of next fall's "Boris Godunov," which 
will open the San Diego Arts Festival. From the ticket-buying public's point of 
view, Mussorgsky's grand historical pageant is a far cry from Puccini's 
four-hankie melodrama.

SCIENTIFIC DEBATE PLAYS TO FRIENDLIER CROWD IN L.A.

The mail and phone calls for B. Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann keep 
flowing in like so much heavy water. A Florida nudist colony has volunteered 
itself as a guinea pig. A letter signed by The Gatekeeper of Andromeda urges 
them to keep up the good work. 
</P>
<P>
Now, rocker-philosopher Frank Zappa, who once led a band called the Mothers of 
Invention, has invited the scientists to a back-yard barbecue Wednesday. He 
didn't mention whether it was bring-your-own-fuel. 
</P>
<P>
The quest for the cold fire of fusion has moved to Los Angeles, to a meeting of 
the Electrochemical Society, which in all of its 87 years has surely seen 
nothing like this. 
</P>
<P>
On the racks in the news shop at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel sits Time 
magazine, and two of the society's own look back from the cover: Pons and 
Fleischmann, discoverers, maybe or maybe not, of cold fusion. 
</P>
<P>
From Switzerland, Spain, Italy and beyond, about 1,600 members of the society 
have come for its 175th meeting. Like people worldwide, they are curious 
whether cold fusion is folly or whether colleagues Stan and Marty have stirred 
up a Promethean miracle inside a jar that looks something like a milkshake 
blender. 
</P>
<P>
As researchers, many members of the Electrochemical Society have doubts. But, 
as chemists they have hopes. If Pons and Fleischmann are right, not only would 
peace and plenty ensue in a world of limitless clean energy, but it would 
provide an earthier satisfaction for chemists: twitting what one called the 
"supreme arrogance" of physicists, who rank above chemists in the pecking order 
of science and consider fusion research their preserve. 
</P>
<P>
Physical chemist Fritz Will of Schenectady, N.Y., is a past president of the 
Electrochemical Society. Last week, a Nobel laureate put a hand on Will's 
shoulder and told him, "Fritz, if cold fusion were ever to be discovered, it 
wouldn't be discovered by a chemist." 
</P>
<P>
Few minds, if any, were changed Monday night. Six uniformed Pinkerton guards 
hired by the society stood watch as most of the 1,600 participants surged into 
the ballroom to hear what Pons, Fleischmann and others had to say. 
</P>
<P>
Later, J.L. Davidson, of Auburn University, declared, "Definitely maybe," then 
added seriously, "I didn't hear any new data" to refute criticism. 
</P>
<P>
Said physicist John Houlihan of Penn State University, "I think it's going to 
be a fair amount of time before you want to sell your gas stove." If cold 
fusion "is true, it'll come," but "I don't think they produced the nuclear 
fusion process. I think we're all disappointed as well." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Will was at the hotel's front desk when his friend Fleischmann 
checked in, about two hours after Pons arrived -- wearily waving off a 
reporter's questions. Fleischmann was just back from Italy, wearing a safari 
jacket, and lugging a huge black case strapped across with a strip of tape 
labeled "Security." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps he would like to join them for dinner, Will asked. "Casual, not to 
discuss fusion," he assured Fleischmann. 
</P>
<P>
It would probably be the only time this week that the subject would not be 
broached. 
</P>
<P>
Pons and Fleischmann were not in Baltimore last week when physicists and even 
some chemists rained contempt on their claim announced March 23, attributing 
the findings to "incompetence," even "delusion," in the sometimes spiteful 
politics of science. Pons' and Fleischmann's supporters in turn dismissed the 
critics as the "Eastern elite." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Friendlier Crowd 
</P>
<P>
Even if it looks like "put up or shut up" time for cold fusion claims, Pons and 
Fleischmann will face a rather friendlier crowd here. "I hope we have a good 
discussion," Fleischmann said Sunday, "without hysteria." 
</P>
<P>
Fusion dominated small talk as the weeklong meeting began. Some here have tried 
the experiment themselves, often forced to rely on the popular-press stories 
for the recipe. "It'll be nice to get it straight from the research," says 
Robert B. Dopp of Rayovac, "and not from the New York Times." 
</P>
<P>
Lay people may not understand the science, but cold fusion is chic. Even in Los 
Angeles, where heavy water commonly means two cases of Perrier, people at 
parties are talking fusion. The public likes doughty underdogs weighing in 
against any Establishment. That, and the prospect of cheap, clean energy, 
especially after Chernobyl and Valdez, has engrossed the world. International 
news teams showed up at the Bonaventure in Academy Award-sized packs, paying 
the $205 registration fee for Monday night's technical session. 
</P>
<P>
Pons and Fleischmann are trying to lie low. In Texas recently, Pons had to 
change hotels and register under a pseudonym to get some peace. At the 
Bonaventure, he asked Roberto the desk clerk to put through only callers who 
know his room number. 
</P>
<P>
And scientists here bristle at hearing them called "obscure chemists." 
</P>
<P>
"They're certainly not Carl Sagan," but they have admirable research records, 
says Galen Hansen, who works at the Naval Research Lab in Washington. He met 
Pons at school in Utah, where Hansen's father is on the board that will 
dispense the state's $5 million in research money. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen was talking with Claudio Gutierrez from Spain, where even obscure rural 
newspapers have carried the news of fusion. Gutierrez knows Fleischmann as an 
able scientist and a man of culture, who buys his wine by the case with 
flawless taste. "A first-class scientist, a pioneer." 
</P>
<P>
As they stood talking in the lobby, Pons went by, wearing a candy-striped shirt 
and a look of fatigue. A few men nudged one another and nodded in his 
direction, but no one approached him. "Any self-respecting electrochemist," 
said Hansen, "would leave them alone right now."

DISPUTES HINDER ACTION ON WORLD WARMING TREND

WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The White House, buffeted by criticism for its apparent reluctance to combat 
the threat of global warming, acknowledged Monday that it has been hindered by 
disputes within the Administration about how best to address the sensitive 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
The admission came as evidence of the indecision emerged in Washington and 
Geneva, where U.S. officials acting under White House orders backed away Monday 
from plans to identify global warming as an environmental threat of major 
importance. 
</P>
<P>
In Geneva, the wariness led to the withdrawal of a planned U.S. initiative 
urging the United Nations to convene an international convention identifying 
global warming as a world threat. U.S. delegates attending a conference there 
were left with no formal Administration "response strategy" to endorse. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Change in Testimony 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Washington, the Office of Management and Budget ordered a 
high-ranking government scientist to tone down testimony citing his belief that 
global warming could have a grave environmental impact on the planet within a 
lifetime, the scientist told members of a Senate subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Angry senators accused the White House of suppressing science for political 
ends, charging that the Administration was not willing to advocate the changes 
necessary to halt the accumulation of atmospheric gases believed likely to 
cause a sharp increase in surface temperatures in coming decades. 
</P>
<P>
"The Administration does not want to act," said Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.), 
chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee's panel on science, technology and 
space. "They want to sit still and do nothing." 
</P>
<P>
But the White House defended its go-slow policy on grounds that it remains 
divided on how to interpret evidence about the warming phenomenon, whose 
severity remains a matter of dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless we base decisions on sound scientific data," White House spokesman 
Marlin Fitzwater said, "we could end up being forced to agree with reductions 
in global warming gases that are neither realistic nor economically sound." 
</P>
<P>
Predictions of global warming are based primarily on recorded increases in the 
atmosphere of carbon dioxide and other gases, which can produce a "greenhouse 
effect" that causes the Earth's atmosphere to retain heat. 
</P>
<P>
The buildup is believed to have been caused primarily by human activity, 
including the burning of coal and other fossil fuels and the destruction of 
forests. For that reason, those seeking to mitigate the effects have urged that 
nations begin promoting more efficient energy policies and reforestation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Officials Want Treaty 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of the proposed U.S. initiative for an international convention on 
global warming -- including Environmental Protection Agency Administrator 
William K. Reilly and senior State Department officials -- saw the Geneva 
meeting as a step toward an eventual treaty to reduce production of greenhouse 
gases. 
</P>
<P>
Such an agreement would emulate the Montreal Protocol, the historic agreement 
under which dozens of nations have pledged to reduce production of the 
chlorofluorocarbons that threaten the Earth's protective layer of stratospheric 
ozone. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was to have been presented Monday by U.S. delegates to a meeting 
convened by the United Nations Environmental Programme. But the initiative was 
blocked by White House and OMB officials who raised concerns about moving too 
quickly on a plan whose eventual economic costs had not yet been calculated, 
Administration officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is disagreement within the EPA, within the State Department and within 
the Administration," Fitzwater said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"The Geneva meeting was not called to discuss a convention," he said. "It was 
called to review the scientific evidence to date. Our position is that we are 
not yet ready for a convention . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Democratic senators attending the hearing on global warming expressed 
exasperation with the Administration's move, likening its indecision to the 
case of a man who refuses to buy life insurance until it is too late. 
</P>
<P>
"Where have they been? What have they been doing?" Sen. Timothy E. Wirth 
(D-Colo.) asked. "The time has come to put this issue more highly in the 
lights." 
</P>
<P>
Toward that end, Gore and Wirth sought to exploit complaints by noted National 
Aeronautic and Space Administration scientist James Hansen that anonymous OMB 
officials had directed him to "soften" the testimony about global warming that 
he had prepared for the subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen's original testimony indicated that he accepted scientific predictions 
of the severe environmental consequences of global warming and blamed human 
activity for the accumulation of greenhouse gases. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doubts Raised on Accuracy 
</P>
<P>
The OMB-ordered changes raised strong doubts about the accuracy of scientific 
models predicting the effects of global warming and stated that the extent of 
human responsibility is "scientifically unknown." 
</P>
<P>
The OMB routinely reviews written prepared testimony by government officials to 
ensure that it is consistent with Administration policy, and mandatory changes 
are not unusual. But Hansen complained that his testimony was to be presented 
as his own "scientific conclusions" and not as Administration policy. 
</P>
<P>
Gore went further, accusing the Administration of committing "scientific fraud" 
and comparing the OMB-ordered alteration of scientific conclusions to a 
governmental practice once common in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"How are we, as policy makers, to develop effective responses if this 
Administration is routinely going to censor the evidence that scientists bring 
to Congress?" Gore asked. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater praised Hansen, calling him an "outstanding and distinguished 
scientist." The changes in Hansen's testimony, Fitzwater said, were made only 
to make clear that not all scientists agree with the conclusions he had reached 
and that the Administration had not yet decided which view it accepts. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration's slow progress toward a policy on global warming comes 
in marked contrast to the emphasis President Bush gave to the issue during last 
year's presidential campaign. In an October, 1988, speech at the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif., for example, Bush pledged that 
during his first year as President he would "convene a global conference on the 
environment, at the White House, to address global warming."

BROWN AGREES TO BACK BAN ON ASSAULT GUNS

<P>
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown abandoned his holdout Monday and endorsed an 
agreement reached with Gov. George Deukmejian to make California the first 
state to outlaw military-style combat guns. 
</P>
<P>
The Speaker's decision to support the agreement appeared to pave the way for 
enactment by next week of the far-reaching ban on semiautomatic weapons that 
police say are favored by drug traffickers and other criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the San Francisco Democrat abruptly put the brakes on the compromise 
reached with Deukmejian by Senate leader David A. Roberti and Assemblyman Mike 
Roos, both Los Angeles Democrats. Brown voiced concern that the agreement might 
weaken penalties for failure to register legally acquired assault firearms. 
</P>
<P>
But Brown said Monday that he had studied the compromise during the weekend and 
termed himself "absolutely" satisfied that the penalties, although softened 
somewhat, were still stiff. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll support the bill," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Starting next Jan. 1, the proposal would make it against the law to import, 
manufacture, sell, lend, trade, advertise for sale and possess without a 
special permit about 60 military-style semiautomatic rifles, pistols and 
shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
Current owners of legally acquired firearms that would appear on the banned 
list -- including AK-47s, Uzis and AR-15s -- could keep those weapons if they 
registered them with the state Department of Justice and obtained a permit. 
They would have until 1991 to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Under the initial proposal, failure to register would be either a misdemeanor 
or a felony, depending on the discretion of a court judge. However, Deukmejian 
objected that these criminal penalties were too harsh, particularly upon an 
otherwise law-abiding gun owner who refused or merely neglected to register the 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
He demanded that the first offense be punishable as an infraction, such as a 
traffic ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached by Deukmejian, Roos and Roberti, the proposed 
misdemeanor or felony penalties for failure to register a legally acquired 
assault weapon would be made a "major infraction" carrying a mandatory fine of 
at least $350 for the first offense. For a second violation, the punishment 
would be a misdemeanor or a felony. 
</P>
<P>
For those who do not own a lawfully obtained firearm, illegal possession of a 
banned assault gun would be a felony, punishable by four to eight years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian also opposed a provision of the Roberti-Roos legislation aimed at 
outlawing facsimile assault weapons not listed in the bill. Subsequently, the 
two sides negotiated a compromise that would allow a Superior Court judge to 
outlaw such guns on a case-by-case challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti said that top law enforcement officials and neighborhood organizations 
-- especially those in Los Angeles County, where heavily armed gangs regularly 
engage in urban warfare -- made their support for the compromise known to Brown 
during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti said he believes the infraction penalty for first-time offenders who 
fail to register their assault guns would be even more effective than facing 
prosecution on a misdemeanor or felony charge. He noted that many judges 
probably would be reluctant to impose a criminal punishment for failure to 
register and probably would levy only a token fine. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise, however, would require the judge to impose the minimum fine of 
$350 and order that the gun be registered. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate already has passed and sent Roberti's bill to Deukmejian, who said 
he would delay signing it until the bill containing the penalty compromise 
reaches him. The compromise amendments will be carried by Roos. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for the compromise to be inserted into the Roos bill in a 
Senate-Assembly conference committee, whose report then will be subject to 
approval by both houses. The Senate is expected to approve the new version 
easily, but the legislation could face a tougher fight in the Assembly, which 
is more vulnerable to lobbying by the National Rifle Assn.

LAWMAKER SAYS STATE WAS SHORTCHANGED ON U.S. HOUSING FUNDS

California received substantially less federal money for public housing than it 
should have in recent years because of "an environment of influence peddling" 
in the Department of Housing and Urban Development, a California congressman 
charged Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), opening hearings into the management of HUD's 
Moderate Rehabilitation Program, said "objective, measurable criteria gave way 
to political preference" in the federal effort to renovate run-down units and 
provide rent subsidies for low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
A recent investigation by the department's inspector general found that 
California public housing authorities were awarded less than 5% of the money 
allocated by the housing program between 1984 and 1988, in contrast to the 17% 
California should have received based on its needs. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the committee, Inspector General Paul A. Adams said 
California is among a number of states that should have received more funding, 
while a group of 10 states captured more than twice what they should have been 
awarded. 
</P>
<P>
"There is little assurance that housing is being provided to those areas having 
the greatest need and that limited program funds are being spent efficiently 
and effectively," he told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Lantos, chairman of the employment and housing subcommittee of the House 
Committee on Government Operations, said after the panel's hearings that he has 
encouraged Jack Kemp, who is now HUD secretary, to "formulate the kind of 
objective criteria that will enable him to set up a mechanism that works." 
</P>
<P>
Former Federal Housing Commissioner Thomas Demery, who was strongly criticized 
in the investigation's report for his role in allocating the funds, said Adams' 
inquiry was based on "malice, negligence or a cover-up." 
</P>
<P>
Demery said that most of the problems occurred before he came to HUD in 
October, 1986, and that he moved quickly to solve them. 
</P>
<P>
"I am deeply distressed that this report contains numerous errors, 
misrepresentations, omissions, inaccuracies and self-promoting deceptive 
passages," he said in a statement to the committee. 
</P>
<P>
The 700-page report accuses 11 former government officials of using their 
influence and connections in the agency to subvert the normal competitive 
process by which money is distributed. 
</P>
<P>
Adams told the House panel that those former officials were paid hundreds of 
thousands of dollars by developers to consult with officials of the department 
between 1984 and 1988. He said those hired as consultants included former 
Interior Secretary James Watt, former HUD Undersecretary Philip Abrams and 
former HUD Assistant Secretary Philip Winn. 
</P>
<P>
"Applications pushed and lubricated by politically well-connected 'consultants' 
received the lion's share of these increasingly scarce funds," Lantos said. 
"Consultants received mind-bogglingly exorbitant fees for fleeting services of 
dubious legality." 
</P>
<P>
Although the investigation found no evidence that laws or regulations were 
broken, Adams said the Justice Department is reviewing the report.

FUNDING CUTS THREATEN AGENCIES THAT TEACH ENGLISH TO IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARITA HERNANDEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several community agencies that offer English classes to federal amnesty 
applicants have begun laying off teachers and some say they may be forced to 
close their doors altogether because of recently announced funding cutbacks by 
the state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
Many community organizations and public schools across the state involved in 
the program began receiving notices two weeks ago announcing cutbacks in 
previously approved funding, state education officials said Monday. The 
officials blamed the cutbacks on insufficient funding from the governor's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Mitchell, a spokeswoman for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of 
Los Angeles, said the notices have created havoc in the program, aimed at 
helping immigrants learn enough English and civics to qualify for the second 
phase of the federal amnesty program. 
</P>
<P>
"It's anarchy out there," said Mitchell, referring to the state's handling of 
the amnesty education program. "Our fear is that applicants will get 
discouraged and just give up." 
</P>
<P>
Juan Gutierrez, director of One-Stop Immigration in East Los Angeles, which has 
about 6,000 immigrants enrolled in its English classes, said that "a lot of 
agencies are getting ready to close down because they have not received the 
money they were promised." 
</P>
<P>
The community agencies have been caught in the middle of a political standoff 
between State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig and Gov. George Deukmejian 
over the release of an additional $50 million for the amnesty education 
program, according to various service providers. 
</P>
<P>
The Deukmejian Administration argues that the education department is 
overspending by paying for more than the minimum 40 hours of classroom 
instruction required of amnesty applicants by the federal Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
Honig, on the other hand, maintains that the governor scrimped on the education 
program when he allocated only $354 million for it out of the state's 
$1.8-billion share of federal funds for immigration programs. And state 
education officials also blame the funding shortfall on a higher than 
anticipated demand for the classes. 
</P>
<P>
But Mitchell and other community group representatives argue that the 
department shares some of the blame. Mitchell charged that the department has 
mismanaged the program from the start, "changing formulas for reimbursement 
mid-stream, not offering solid contracts with community agencies or statewide 
coordination to make sure enough classes are offered throughout the state." 
</P>
<P>
She added that the immigrants rights coalition plans to ask Honig to rescind 
the letters sent out over the past two weeks. The group also plans to ask the 
department for "a full accounting" of the money spent by various community 
groups and the number of students they are serving. She said that such 
accounting has been lacking and has led to inconsistencies in funding. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez said that even if more money is released by the state, community 
agencies may not be willing to continue their programs next year, the third in 
the five-year education program. 
</P>
<P>
"People have become skeptical of Department of Education promises," he said. 
His organization, for instance, was notified that it would receive only 
$900,000 of the original $2.5 million it was promised, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The state has also been slow in paying the organizations, he said. His 
organization has had to borrow money to keep its program in operation, and it 
started notifying its teachers this week that they may have to wait until the 
state reimbursement comes through to get paid, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"And we're doing better than most agencies," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Immigrant Assistance Program, sponsored by the AFL-CIO labor union, 
began cutting back on teachers and doubling up its classes last week, said 
program director Teresa Sanchez. She expressed concern that some students may 
drop out as schedules are changed to consolidate the classes.

INSURERS GET A BREAK ON PROP. 103 BILL IN ASSEMBLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move showing that automobile insurance companies still wield considerable 
clout in the Legislature, the Assembly on Monday rejected a Senate-passed bill 
to impose stiff fines on companies that try to escape provisions of Proposition 
103 by mass cancellations of California policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
The essentially partisan vote was 49 to 21 -- but 54 votes were required for 
passage because of an urgency clause that would have made the measure effective 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
The vote marked the second Assembly defeat for the measure, which was drafted 
by Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) because of fears that insurance companies 
would make blanket cancellations of auto policies rather than live with the 
rate-reduction requirements of Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative, approved by voters last November, requires insurers to reduce 
rates by 20% from the levels they were charging for the same coverage in 
November, 1987, unless the state insurance commissioner specifically grants 
them an exemption for economic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the measure had hoped for a different outcome Monday because of 
the ruling last Thursday by the California Supreme Court upholding the 
constitutionality of the major provisions of Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fear of Exodus 
</P>
<P>
After the court handed down its decision last week, an Assembly vote on the 
Robbins bill was scheduled for Monday. Robbins and his allies clearly hoped the 
court ruling would help them pick up the handful of votes they needed to secure 
the bill's passage. They also wanted to act quickly because of fears that the 
ruling could spur insurance companies to leave California. 
</P>
<P>
"Following the court decision, time is of the essence," said Assemblyman 
Patrick Johnston (D-Stockton), chairman of the Assembly Finance and Insurance 
Committee who carried the bill in the lower house for Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
But Republicans, who were responsible for defeating the measure when it was 
brought up for its initial Assembly vote in April, voted in mass against the 
bill for a second time, casting virtually all the "no" votes. 
</P>
<P>
GOP lawmakers, who traditionally receive a substantial amount of political 
support from insurance companies, made it clear during the Assembly floor 
debate that they disagreed with both the voters who passed Proposition 103 as 
well as the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman William P. Baker (R-Danville) denounced Proposition 103 as an 
attempt by voters to get "a free lunch" by voting to arbitrarily reduce their 
insurance rates. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, in urging his colleagues to vote against the Robbins bill, said 
Proposition 103 was "wrong economically the day it went on the ballot. It is 
wrong today. The time to stand up for it is now. Vote no." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) said "supreme courts in America have 
been wrong just as often as they've been right and this Supreme Court is 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the vote, Harvey Rosenfield, chairman of Voter Revolt, the 
organization that sponsored Proposition 103, denounced opponents of the Robbins 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the bill "a very moderate proposal to give consumers a little bit of 
protection," Rosenfield said opponents of the measure displayed "arrogance" and 
"insensitivity" to voters. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield said the lawmakers acted like they were "conducting business on 
another planet." 
</P>
<P>
"They are just not in step with what the public wants -- or even worse, they 
don't care," Rosenfield said. "What are we paying these people for if they are 
not going to do the job? They ignore the will of the people. I say, throw the 
bums out." 
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, insurance companies would be allowed to cancel or refuse to 
renew auto insurance policies only if they could prove fraud on the part of 
policyholders, or show that there had been non-payment of premiums or a 
substantial change in the risk of insuring a particular individual. 
</P>
<P>
Under provisions of Proposition 103, companies that arbitrarily cancel policies 
or refuse to write new ones can be fined up to $250,000. By contrast, the 
Robbins bill would provide for fines equal to 50% of the insurer's prior year 
private passenger auto insurance premiums multiplied by the percentage of 
non-renewed policies. That potentially could mean millions of dollars in fines 
for the state's largest insurers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Like 'Traffic Fine' 
</P>
<P>
Democrat Johnston said the current penalty is the equivalent of "a traffic 
fine" for wealthy insurance companies and a much stronger "deterrent" was 
needed to protect consumers. 
</P>
<P>
After the vote, Robbins said he still hopes ultimately to be able to round up 
the 54 votes he will need in ensure passage of the measure in the Assembly. He 
noted that three lawmakers who had voted in favor of the measure in April were 
out of town and not able to get back to Sacramento in time for the vote and 
that a fourth was excused Monday because of illness. 
</P>
<P>
However, Johnston said he thought the Robbins bill, if not dead, "is in a 
coma." 
</P>
<P>
In another development, state Controller Gray Davis sharply criticized state 
Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie for being "totally unprepared" to 
implement Proposition 103 and the 20% rate rollback required by the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said consumers might be forced to wait months, even years, because 
Gillespie's agency "does not have the personnel, the expertise, or the 
regulations in place to implement Proposition 103." 
</P>
<P>
"As a result, in the near term consumers are not likely to see the 20% 
reduction in rates as promised by Proposition 103 and in fact many may actually 
experience premium increases," Davis told reporters at a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
Davis urged Gillespie to require insurance companies to make immediate rebates 
and not wait to go through the formal process of applying for exemptions. The 
Democratic officeholder also announced that he was going to begin an "insurance 
watch" to monitor the state Department of Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie and the staff of the Department of Insurance, in an equally barbed 
reply, noted that Davis had been considering running for governor. "From our 
perspective, the controller's 'insurance watch' may have more to do with his 
'candidate's watch' on the governor's seat," Gillespie's response said. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie insisted that "we have been preparing for months to implement 
whatever the Supreme Court handed us on Proposition 103." 
</P>
<P>
"In addition, we are unaware of any insurance expertise on the part of either 
the controller or his staff," the response said, adding that Davis' reasoning 
was "lame, at best."

STALIN IGNORED INVASION WARNINGS, PRAVDA SAYS

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
Dictator Josef Stalin had detailed information about Nazi Germany's plans to 
invade the Soviet Union in 1941 but ignored the warnings and failed to prepare 
for war, Pravda told its readers Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The full-page article in the Communist Party newspaper, the most detailed look 
yet at what Soviet spies knew about Adolf Hitler's plans, came on the eve of a 
national observance of the 44th anniversary of victory in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The article marked a sharp break from the Soviet press tradition of publishing 
uncritical, patriotic reminiscences of Soviet heroism. 
</P>
<P>
Western historians have written extensively about how Stalin ignored 
intelligence reports about Hitler's plans. However, little has been published 
in the Soviet Union, where Stalin traditionally had been portrayed as a 
brilliant wartime leader. 
</P>
<P>
But under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness, 
many Soviet writers and historians have recently condemned Stalin's political 
repression of millions of people and re-examined his wartime role. 
</P>
<P>
Pravda said the article's author, history professor A. Baidakov, gleaned the 
accounts from classified state security archives. 
</P>
<P>
He said the state security agencies managed to infiltrate Hitler's Gestapo 
secret police, Germany's Aviation Ministry and its coding service. 
</P>
<P>
According to Baidakov, security officials promptly forwarded information to 
Soviet political leaders about Hitler's invasion plans as early as November, 
1940. German forces invaded June 22, 1941. 
</P>
<P>
But, the historian said: 
</P>
<P>
"The leadership of the U.S.S.R. people's commissariats (ministries) of state 
security and defense did not, in my view, do everything to convince Stalin and 
the country's other leaders of the inevitability of an imminent confrontation 
with the Germans." 
</P>
<P>
He added that the main blame for lack of preparedness "lies with the U.S.S.R. 
political leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Baidakov revealed a series of intelligence reports forwarded to Stalin and 
Foreign Minister Vyacheslav M. Molotov. In April, 1941, for example, the two 
were told that Hitler had revealed to a Yugoslav prince that an invasion of the 
Soviet Union was planned for June. 
</P>
<P>
On June 16, this urgent message was delivered to Stalin and Molotov: "All 
military operations of Germany on preparation of a military aggression against 
the U.S.S.R. have been completely stopped, and a blow can be expected at any 
time." 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Baidakov wrote, Stalin asked intelligence officials whether the 
message was reliable. Before the information could be rechecked, the Germans 
invaded.

2 JAPANESE HEMOPHILIACS FILE AIDS SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Two hemophiliacs infected with the AIDS virus filed a ground-breaking lawsuit 
Monday in Osaka District Court, suing the government and two Japanese drug 
companies for failing to protect them from imported supplies of contaminated 
blood products. 
</P>
<P>
Fumio Akase, 52, a calligrapher from Ehime prefecture, and a fellow plaintiff 
from Kyoto whose name was not made public demanded $1.77 million in damages, 
alleging that they were infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, 
because the government was negligent in screening imported blood products. 
</P>
<P>
Also named as defendants in the suit were Osaka-based Green Cross Corp., a 
manufacturer of plasma derivatives, and a Tokyo pharmaceutical company, Baxter 
Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that the companies continued to market tainted blood-clotting 
agents after 1983 despite clear warnings from U.S. health officials and the 
availability of tests that would have detected the virus. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a major medical disaster," said Yukio Yasuda, one of a group of 
lawyers representing the two plaintiffs. "The tragedy won't end with mere moral 
penance. The victims won't find satisfaction until the government and the drug 
companies accept legal responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Although AIDS-related damage suits have become commonplace as the epidemic 
mushrooms in the United States, it was the first legal action of its kind in 
Japan, where the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome remains limited 
and where social conventions discourage litigation as a means of settling 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll probably be seeing many more lawsuits like this in the future," lawyer 
Yasuda said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,065 people in Japan identified by the government as HIV carriers as of 
the end of 1988, 92% were hemophiliacs believed to have contracted the virus 
through imported blood, mostly of U.S. origin. Patient-advocacy groups estimate 
that about 2,000 hemophiliacs are infected with HIV. More than half of the 97 
confirmed cases of AIDS in Japan have involved hemophiliacs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Delay by Ministry 
</P>
<P>
Like Akase, many of those affected were exposed to the virus after the U.S. 
Centers for Disease Control alerted the public to the risk of HIV infection 
through blood transfusions and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved, 
in 1983, a heat-treatment method that eliminates the virus from coagulant 
agents used by hemophiliacs. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Health and Welfare Ministry did not authorize production of blood 
products using the heat-treatment method until July, 1985, a delay that Akase 
and his co-plaintiff say resulted in unnecessary exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the government began compensating some patients infected 
with the AIDS virus through blood products, using a fund contributed by drug 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
"We are sincerely sympathetic with these patients," said Tadaharu Goto, an 
official with the Health and Welfare Ministry. "But the government based its 
policy on the scientific knowledge available at that time, and we believe we 
have no legal responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Green Cross issued a statement Monday saying: "We are constantly making efforts 
to improve the products we supply to the medical industry. With a disease like 
AIDS, for which there is no prior experience, we establish our policies while 
receiving guidance from the government." 
</P>
<P>
Ichiro Henmi, a spokesman for Baxter, said the company had "done its utmost" to 
adhere to procedures in force at the time of the alleged contamination. 
</P>
<P>
Akase reportedly said he noticed his health was deteriorating in the fall of 
1985, when he started catching colds and suffering from diarrhea. He was 
diagnosed as infected with HIV in November, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with the newspaper Mainichi, Akase said he hoped his 
lawsuit would help alleviate some of the shame and social discrimination 
experienced by Japanese AIDS patients and their families.

BAKER TO SEEK SOVIET HALT OF 3RD WORLD MISSILE SALES

Secretary of State James A. Baker III plans to challenge the Soviet Union this 
week to join a Western effort to halt the sale of ballistic missile technology 
to Third World countries, a senior Bush Administration official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, who is scheduled to begin his first visit to Moscow on Wednesday, 
particularly wants to press Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to stop 
missile exports to radical Arab countries like Libya and Syria, the official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet policy "can't get . . . much worse than it is right now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We think this is one of the reasons that regional conflict (in the Third 
World) are more dangerous than they used to be . . . because of the 
proliferation of these missiles and chemical weapons," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of proliferation is one of several new issues that Baker plans to 
take up with the Soviet leader during his two days in Moscow on Wednesday and 
Thursday. Other such issues include terrorism, drug trafficking and 
international threats to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"We are seeking an active, constructive, positive and expanding relationship 
with the Soviet Union," Baker told reporters on his Air Force plane en route 
here. "We want to test (Gorbachev's) 'new thinking' across the full range of 
our relations." 
</P>
<P>
Officials traveling with the secretary said he plans to propose a date for 
resuming the U.S.-Soviet Strategic Arms Reduction Talks in the second half of 
June. But Baker will not propose a date for President Bush's first summit 
meeting with Gorbachev, because Bush does not yet feel ready for such a 
session, they said. 
</P>
<P>
On the issue of ballistic missiles, the senior official acknowledged that the 
Soviet Union has shown no interest in joining the seven-nation Western group 
that has pledged to stop missile exports. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to talk to them further about that," he said. "If they're not going 
to be willing to engage multilaterally with other countries that are interested 
in controlling proliferation, then maybe we can engage them bilaterally." 
</P>
<P>
The group, the Missile Technology Control Regime, includes six North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization countries and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
But it has failed to restrain the Soviet Union from selling thousands of Scud 
surface-to-surface missiles to such countries as Iran, Iraq, Libya and Syria. 
</P>
<P>
The senior official suggested that Gorbachev's response on the missile issue 
could influence the U.S. attitude toward Soviet participation in the search for 
peace in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"We welcome all the help we can get, and if they want to come in as real 
players, that doesn't disturb us," he said. "But we need more than just 
rhetoric, we need some action to support the words. . . . They can start by 
normalizing their relations with the state of Israel. They could start by 
ceasing their support for radical regimes in the area such as Libya."

IRAN ORDERED PAN AM BOMBING, W. GERMAN MAGAZINE REPORTS

Iran ordered the destruction of Pan Am Flight 103 and paid a Palestinian 
terrorist more than $1 million to carry out the bombing, a West German magazine 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Munich-based Quick said a bomb was placed aboard the Boeing 747 to avenge the 
shooting down of an Iranian civilian jet by the U.S. Navy in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
It said the Iranians paid Palestinian terrorist Ahmed Jibril $1.3 million to 
carry out the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Flight 103 blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, killing all 259 
people aboard and 11 on the ground. British investigators determined that the 
plane was downed by a bomb hidden in a radio-cassette recorder. 
</P>
<P>
Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt, West Germany, changed planes in London and 
was en route to New York when it exploded. 
</P>
<P>
Quick said the decision to retaliate by attacking the plane was made in Tehran 
last summer, shortly after the Iran Air jetliner was downed by the U.S. guided 
missile cruiser Vincennes on July 3. The Navy said it mistook the passenger 
plane with 290 people aboard for an Iranian fighter jet. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine said the decision to bomb an American plane was made in a "narrow 
circle" of close advisers to Iran's leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. 
</P>
<P>
The Quick report is the latest of many assigning blame for the disaster. 
Officially, authorities in West Germany, Britain and the United States say they 
do not know who blew up the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Quick reported its information was based on "secret" minutes of the meeting in 
Tehran and said a Khomeini aide, Mehdi Karoubi, offered money to the group that 
would carry out the attack. 
</P>
<P>
West German authorities are holding two suspected members of Jibril's 
Syrian-supported group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine-General Command. West German officials say they have no evidence to 
link the two men to the Pan Am bombing. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Oliver Revell, deputy director of the FBI, was quoted by the 
magazine as saying: "Our investigating officials believe the explosive came 
onto the plane in Frankfurt. That does not mean that the bomb could not have 
been on a connecting flight to Frankfurt. However, we have every reason to 
believe that the bomb was taken on by Pan Am in Frankfurt."

The chief judge at the trial of admitted hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi said 
Monday the verdict will be delivered May 17 and that pressure from kidnapers 
who seized a West German in Lebanon won't affect the case. 
</P>
<P>
In Lebanon, two West Germans said Monday they were freed by kidnapers after 
being held briefly to transmit demands of abductors holding a third German 
hostage, Markus Quint. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, an official of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Lebanon 
said the freed Germans, Heinrich Struebig and Petra Schnitzler, told him the 
kidnapers threaten to kill Quint unless Hamadi receives a mild sentence. 
</P>
<P>
But Judge Heiner Mueckenberger declared on Monday: "It should be said that if 
anyone thinks this can influence us, they are wrong. Here we are dealing with 
German law and it shall remain so." 
</P>
<P>
Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Muslim, is charged with murder and air piracy in the 
1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner. U.S. Navy diver Robert D. Stethem was killed 
and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days after TWA Flight 847 was seized 
and diverted to Beirut.

EXXON, WITNESSES CLASH ON USE OF DISPERSANTS

<TEXT>
<P>
Top Exxon executives contradicted government witnesses Monday, insisting they 
repeatedly urged the quick use of chemicals to disperse the nation's largest 
oil spill but that federal authorities turned them down. 
</P>
<P>
Their testimony before a five-member subcommittee of the House Interior 
Committee went against earlier statements by both the Coast Guard and the 
state's top environmental official, who said the oil company did not seek 
widespread use of dispersant chemicals to break down the oil. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon executives also disclosed for the first time that the cleanup has cost 
the oil giant $95 million to date. 
</P>
<P>
"We came to Alaska to use dispersants," Exxon Shipping Co. President Frank 
Iarossi told the panel. "I was pleading on my part to begin dispersal use . . . 
we were very aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
He said opposition from the state Department of Environmental Conservation and 
the Coast Guard blocked the chemicals' use or limited them to tests or only 
small-scale use. 
</P>
<P>
"We're confident that had we obtained prompt permission to use the dispersant, 
the environmental damage (of the spill) would have been mitigated," said Exxon 
USA President William D. Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens said early use of dispersants or early burning would have broken up 
large amounts of spilled oil. Iarossi said the chemicals would have dispersed 
perhaps 40% of the Alaskan crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Kelso, commissioner of Alaska's Department of Environmental 
Conservation, rebutted that testimony and described Exxon's account Monday as a 
"fabrication." Dispersants in parts of Prince William Sound had been 
preapproved by the state even before the oil spill, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Dispersants were not used extensively in the three days following the tanker 
accident because the winds and seas were too calm to provide the turbulence 
necessary to mix them with oil," Kelso said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee held two days of hearings to investigate the oil spill, which 
occurred March 24 when an Exxon tanker struck a reef outside normal shipping 
channels in Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
Vice Adm. Clyde Robbins, the No. 2 Coast Guard official involved in the spill 
cleanup, also testified Monday that the oil industry did not seek permission to 
use large amounts of dispersants immediately after the spill. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins and the Coast Guard's Valdez commander both said Exxon and Alyeska, its 
pipeline service company, did not urge the use of dispersants.

there is no sign of a way out of the impasse.

PANEL BACKS DEUKMEJIAN ON BUDGET ACCOUNTING RULES 
</P>

Hopes by Gov. George Deukmejian that the Commission on State Finance would put 
to rest the "accountants' debate" over the existence of a deficit in last 
year's budget ended Monday in a flurry of political sniping between Democratic 
and Republican lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
In between the political barbs, the commission voted 4 to 1 on a balanced 
budget resolution, saying in effect that the state budget has a "surplus" when 
revenues exceed expenditures in any given year. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also recommended to the Legislature that for purposes of budget 
decisions, expenditures should not be counted until goods or services are 
actually delivered to the state. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, the resolution supports Deukmejian's argument that the state ended 
the 1987-88 fiscal year in the black. Deukmejian's budget assessment was based 
on money raised and spent during the year, not on outstanding bills. 
</P>
<P>
But the resolution did nothing to settle the large political fight that began 
months ago when state Controller Gray Davis and others charged that the 
Republican governor was hiding a deficit by resorting to accounting gimmicks. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's critics noted that the state had spent much more money during 
the 1987-88 fiscal year than it had raised in tax revenues. The state got away 
with it because some of the goods it ordered were not actually delivered until 
the following budget year, the critics said. 
</P>
<P>
The four members of the commission who voted in favor of the resolution backing 
up the governor's position were Republicans. The only "no" vote was cast by 
Controller Davis, a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing the handwriting on the wall before the vote, Davis fumed, "This is just 
a game. We are not doing anything serious or substantive." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said the resolution "is clearly an attempt to save face by Gov. 
Deukmejian." 
</P>
<P>
"We can get four votes that it will rain beer. That doesn't mean it will rain 
beer," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman William P. Baker (R-Danville) in turn scolded Davis. "I'd be very 
happy not to ever have accounting principles if you'd stop issuing press 
releases saying we're going broke," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Sen. Ken Maddy (R-Fresno) was asked what he thought had been 
accomplished by the resolution and the hours of debate that had preceded it. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing . . . zero," Maddy said. 
</P>
<P>
Another member of the commission, Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-San Jose), 
chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, who did not vote on the 
resolution, said the Republicans seemed to "have found a way of making it look 
like we have more money" -- at least until 1990, when Deukmejian has announced 
that he will leave office. Then, Vasconcellos said, "the next governor will 
have to pick up the pieces." 
</P>
<P>
The composition of the seven-member commission is prescribed by state law. It 
consists of the state treasurer, controller, finance director, two state 
senators and two assemblymen. GOP members gained a majority this year, when 
Republican Thomas W. Hayes was appointed to replace the late Jesse M. Unruh, a 
Democrat, as treasurer.

GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED CUT FOR MENTALLY ILL ASSAILED 
</P>

<P>
Thousands of mentally ill people, their relatives and health-care providers 
demonstrated outside the Capitol Monday, calling on Gov. George Deukmejian to 
abandon his threat to cut $200 million from the mental health budget. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we being paranoid or is the governor really out to get us?" asked Jay 
Mahler, one of several former mental health patients who addressed the crowd. 
"We need to let the governor and the Legislature know that cutting the mental 
health budget by one-third and destroying the community mental health system is 
unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has pledged to reduce the mental health budget by $200 million if 
the Democratic-controlled Legislature insists on giving an annual 
cost-of-living increase to recipients of welfare and aid to the aged, blind and 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican governor contends there is not enough money in his proposed 
$47.8-billion budget to go around. Furthermore, he says he has little 
flexibility in preparing the spending plan because of Proposition 98, which 
requires that 40% of the state budget go to education. 
</P>
<P>
But the demonstrators rejected Deukmejian's logic and insisted that he should 
increase funds for both the mentally ill and recipients of state aid. 
</P>
<P>
"It's Crazy to Disregard the Mentally Ill," said a sign carried by one 
protester. "George Deukmejian, What if Your Son Was Mentally Ill?" read 
another. 
</P>
<P>
State police estimated that 2,500 people attended the demonstration, many of 
whom traveled by bus from as far away as Los Angeles and San Diego counties. 
Organizers of the protest insisted the crowd was closer to 5,000 and said that 
about a third of them were mentally ill people who depend on county mental 
health services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Politicians at Rally 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of speakers, including Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), 
Assembly Ways and Means Committee Chairman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara), 
Senate Majority Leader Barry Keene (D-Benicia) and Assemblyman William J. 
Filante (R-Greenbrae), addressed the rally and called on the governor not to 
cut funds for mental health. 
</P>
<P>
"A show of force like this will dissuade the governor from this ridiculous 
course of action," Assembly Health Committee Chairman Bruce Bronzan (D-Fresno) 
told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy said the governor's plan to slash mental 
health funds amounts to a 46% reduction in services. "His blue pencil will be 
as destructive as any assault weapon we've been reading about," McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
Other speakers charged that California's mental health system is already in a 
serious state of collapse, with eight mental health clinics in Los Angeles 
County already slated to close because of a lack of money. 
</P>
<P>
After the two-hour rally, hundreds of demonstrators stood peacefully in a long 
line that wound its way through the Capitol as they awaited a chance to deliver 
hand-written messages protesting the proposed cutbacks to the governor's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Beermann, Deukmejian's deputy press secretary, said the governor is not 
eager to cut mental health programs but would find it necessary if the 
Legislature rejects his plan to withhold cost-of-living increases for those who 
receive welfare and aid to the aged, blind and disabled. 
</P>
<P>
"What the governor has clearly indicated is that the proposal to reduce funding 
for mental health programs is something he would prefer not to do," Beermann 
said. "The lack of flexibility created by Proposition 98 puts the governor in 
this position." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles), however, charged that the 
governor is "vindictive" and is "being a bully." He said that 95% of those who 
receive help from the state's mental health system also receive welfare or aid 
to the aged, blind and disabled. Either way the governor cuts the budget, he 
said, these people will suffer. 
</P>
<P>
"The thought of pitting one group of sick and disabled needy people against 
each other is disturbing, but it's also senseless, because (in many cases) they 
are the same people," Friedman said.

ORANGE COUNTY PANEL OKS $11.6-BILLION TRAFFIC PLAN

<TEXT>
<P>
A 20-year, $11.6-billion traffic improvement and growth management plan won 
unanimous approval Monday from the Orange County Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Ratification of the plan, which is expected, now must come from a majority of 
the county Board of Supervisors and a majority of city council members in the 
county's 28 cities. Once the plan is ratified, the Transportation Commission 
will be empowered under state law to ask voters for approval of a countywide 
half-cent sales tax to help finance the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Some regional studies show that rush-hour traffic delays are now worse in 
Orange County than in Los Angeles. Orange is the only California urban county 
without a half-cent sales tax to fund transportation projects. County voters 
soundly rejected a 1-cent transportation sales tax in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which would earmark funds for widening Orange County freeways and 
establishing new commuter rail service, would be financed partly with the $3.1 
billion raised by the half-cent sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
About $8.5 billion would come from state, federal and local funds that are 
expected to be available during the next two decades. 
</P>
<P>
Key funding would include: 
</P>
<P>
* $550 million for doubling the width of the Santa Ana Freeway from six lanes 
to 12 lanes between the San Gabriel River Freeway and the San Diego Freeway. 
Also, funds for improving the intersection of the San Diego and Santa Ana 
freeways, and for adding 140 miles of car-pool lanes to existing freeways. 
</P>
<P>
* $450 million for street and road maintenance and improvements. 
</P>
<P>
* More than $400 million for rail projects, including two more trains between 
Los Angeles and various stops in Orange County, and establishing of rail 
service between Riverside and Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Some transportation officials say that full implementation of the 20-year plan 
could reduce traffic congestion to 1983-84 levels or better. 
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Commission, acting in its capacity as the Local 
Transportation Authority, was required by state law to draw up a 20-year plan 
before seeking voter approval of a transit sales tax.

O.C. TRAFFIC PLAN GETS ITS 1ST GREEN LIGHT

<P>
An effort to ease traffic problems in congested Orange County advanced Monday 
with the unanimous passage by the County Transportation Commission of a 20-year 
$11.6-billion traffic improvement and growth management plan. 
</P>
<P>
Despite expressions of concerns about financial oversight and continued 
reliance on the automobile, the plan was approved on a 6-0 vote and is now 
headed for ratification by the Board of Supervisors and the county's 28 city 
councils. These agencies may only approve or reject the plan as it is presented 
to them; they cannot tinker with it. 
</P>
<P>
Approval by a majority of the board and by council members representing a 
majority of the cities' populations will permit the Transportation Commission 
to call for an election on a half-cent transportation sales tax. Should the 
plan be approved, which is expected, the sales tax proposal could be put before 
the voters as soon as Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County is the only urban county in the state without a sales tax for 
transportation projects, although public opinion surveys show residents 
consider traffic the county's No. 1 problem and studies show that rush-hour 
traffic delays are now worse here than in Los Angeles. County voters soundly 
rejected a 1-cent transportation sales tax in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The commission and 100 participants and spectators who jammed the Hearing Room 
of the County Hall of Administration in Santa Ana heard about 1 1/2 hours of 
public testimony. The views conflicted sharply, raising the question of whether 
the sales-tax proposal could survive an election battle. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which would earmark funds for widening freeways and establishing new 
commuter rail service, would be financed partly with $3.1 billion from the 
half-cent sales tax. About 43% of the sales tax revenue would go for freeways, 
25% to public transit and rail projects, 21% for street improvements and 11% 
for regional transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Best We Could Get' 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best plan we could get," said Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, a 
commission member, as the commission prepared to vote after the public portion 
of the hearing was concluded. No one is going to be happy with every element in 
it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The key provisions of the plan include: 
</P>
<P>
* $550 million to widen the Santa Ana Freeway from six to 12 lanes between the 
San Gabriel River Freeway and the San Diego Freeway. In addition, funds would 
be available for improving the interchange of the San Diego and Santa Ana 
freeways, and for adding 140 miles of car-pool lanes to existing freeways. 
</P>
<P>
* $450 million for street and road maintenance and improvements. 
</P>
<P>
* More than $400 million for rail projects, including one to add two non-Amtrak 
trains for the Orange County stops on the Los Angeles-San Diego commuter line 
and one to establish rail service between Riverside and Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Some transportation officials believe that full implementation of the 20-year 
plan could reduce traffic congestion to the 1983-84 level or better. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Last-Minute Compromise 
</P>
<P>
The funding proportions reflect a last-minute compromise between the county's 
28 cities and county officials. It was introduced at the hearing by commission 
member Irv Pickler, an Anaheim councilman. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the plan called for 28% of the tax proceeds to go for transit and 
rail projects; officials from several cities wanted that figure reduced to 20% 
so as to make more money available for street improvements. 
</P>
<P>
More than 20 people testified about the plan, including several who had been 
opponents of the 1984 sales-tax proposal. Most of those delivering opposing 
views Monday criticized the plan's heavy reliance on car-pool lanes. Several 
environmentalists, however, said that even with its car-pool lanes and new rail 
projects, the 20-year plan would do too little to reduce reliance on the 
automobile. 
</P>
<P>
Commission members sought to gain support for the plan from slow-growth 
advocates by adding provisions encouraging the placement of an open-space bond 
act on the same ballot as the sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest complaint voiced after the meeting was about the panel's 
rejection of proposals for an elected citizens' review committee to oversee the 
spending of the sales-tax proceeds. Instead, the commission amended the plan to 
require financial reviews by the Orange County Grand Jury. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Dana W. Reed, a Costa Mesa lawyer who serves as the 
public-at-large member, introduced the grand jury provision in an attempt to 
"avoid adding another layer of government" yet still heed public opinion 
surveys showing that voters strongly believe that government does not spend tax 
proceeds wisely. After the meeting, Reed said that to have the grand jury act 
in such an officially mandated review capacity may require state legislation. 
Currently, grand juries choose which if any government programs they will 
investigate. 
</P>
<P>
Dalton Newland, a member of the 1988-89 grand jury who was at the meeting, said 
afterward, "We don't know how much time it would take us to do what they're 
asking, but it might be a proper thing for the grand jury to do." Newland said 
the grand jury might have to hire an auditor to perform such tasks. The grand 
jury will probably write a letter to the commission after deciding its position 
on the issue, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to involve the grand jury disappointed some observers, including 
Norm Grossman, who served on two citizens' panels that helped draft elements of 
the 20-year plan. 
</P>
<P>
"They really blew it," he said. "The grand jury doesn't have the time or the 
authority. It's already overloaded, and they only (serve) for a year. There's 
no continuity of expertise." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Brooks of Irvine, a member of the citizens' task force that county 
supervisors appointed to help draft the 20-year plan, was as angry as Grossman. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to four or five committee members after the meeting, and we're a 
little miffed. I think we might meet in the next few days and write a letter 
withdrawing our support of the plan." 
</P>
<P>
Brooks said his group had suggested that the overseeing be done by a citizens' 
panel that would be selected in a manner similar to that for a grand jury but 
that would screen for people with some experience and knowledge in 
transportation issues. "It just makes no sense to have the grand jury do it. 
And what happened today was a complete surprise -- nobody talked to us about it 
in advance." 
</P>
<P>
Other elements of the plan, however, won support from members of the citizens' 
task force. 
</P>
<P>
The group supported a sales tax, Brooks said, because it is "the most efficient 
and equitable" way to raise more money. It also supported a controversial 
provision approved with the plan Monday that would deny tax proceeds to cities 
that fail to adopt or adhere to strict growth-management programs. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Jones, director of administration for the county's largest employer, 
Hughes Aircraft in Fullerton, supported the traffic plan but urged the 
commission members to resist pressure to reduce transit's share of the tax 
proceeds. "We need it now," Jones said of public transit, to comply with new 
regulations by the South Coast Air Quality Management District aimed at 
reducing the number of solo drivers commuting to work. Car-pooling, Jones said, 
will not be enough. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Ward, a member of Drivers for Highway Safety, attacked the 20-year plan as 
the product of officials who "live in a dream world." A critic of car-pool 
lanes, Ward belittled the view voiced by several commission members that it is 
impossible to build enough freeways to handle the expected amount of traffic. 
"We are much more likely to build our way out than dream our way out" of the 
problem, he said. A tax for construction of more car-pool lanes, Ward said, 
will "go down in flames" at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
Slow-growth advocates Tom Rogers and Russ Burkett, who helped lead the fight 
against the 1984 sales-tax measure, testified that the Transportation 
Commission should be replaced by an elected citizens' panel to ensure that 
those who helped cause today's traffic problems "aren't given a blank check." 
</P>
<P>
Rogers said after the meeting that he was disappointed with the provision 
naming the grand jury as the oversight panel and that he would campaign against 
the sales tax because of that as well as because of what he believes are 
"fatal" weaknesses in the growth management regulations in the 20-year plan. 
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Commission, acting in its capacity as the Local 
Transportation Authority, was required by state law to draw up a 20-year plan 
before it could seek voter approval for a transportation sales tax.

TRAFFIC IMPROVEMENT TAX SPENDING PLAN 
</P>
<P>
The plan approved Monday by the Orange County Transportation Commission must be 
ratified by the county board of supervisors and by city governments. If it is 
ratified and if voters pass the half-cent sales tax, the proceeds would be 
spent as follows:

VA'S RULES ON AGENT ORANGE EFFECTS VOIDED

<P>
A federal judge has thrown out the Veterans Administration's rules on health 
damage attributed to the herbicide Agent Orange and has ordered the VA to 
reconsider the claims of more than 31,000 Vietnam veterans. 
</P>
<P>
In denying most claims for health benefits related to Agent Orange, the VA 
wrongly required proof that the herbicide causes various diseases, U. S. 
District Judge Thelton Henderson said in a decision made public Monday. 
Statistical evidence showing a significant correlation between Agent Orange and 
the diseases would be sufficient, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
"These errors, especially sharply compounded with one another, sharply tipped 
the scales against veteran claimants," Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
In a nationwide suit on behalf of Agent Orange claimants, Henderson struck down 
VA regulations that deny Agent Orange service-connected health benefits for 
cancers and all other diseases except one non-fatal skin condition, chloracne. 
He also ordered the VA to reopen all claims denied under those rules. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a major victory with far-reaching implications," Mary Stout, president 
of Vietnam Veterans of America, said. 
</P>
<P>
"The ruling validates what Vietnam veterans have been saying for years, that 
the VA has failed to give Agent Orange victims a fair hearing. . . . I am 
optimistic that Congress will now act quickly to resolve this most painful 
legacy of the Vietnam War." 
</P>
<P>
Barry Kasinitz, spokesman for the 35,000-member group, said it will again 
sponsor legislation to require Agent Orange benefits for two types of cancer -- 
soft-tissue sarcoma and non-Hodgkins lymphoma -- and establish a new scientific 
panel, independent of the VA, to study the herbicide's health effects. A 
similar bill was passed by the Senate last year but died in the House, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Henderson's ruling does not require the government to add any diseases 
to the service-connected list for Agent Orange, Kasinitz said the performance 
so far of the secretary of the new Cabinet-level Department of Veterans 
Affairs, Edward Derwinski, provides some grounds for optimism. 
</P>
<P>
"We think that we probably stand a better chance of getting a fair review under 
the current Administration than we did under the past one," Kasinitz said. 
</P>
<P>
The VA was represented by the Justice Department, whose spokeswoman, Amy Brown, 
declined comment on the ruling, saying department lawyers had not seen it. 
</P>
<P>
Agent Orange, whose toxic ingredient is dioxin, was used as a defoliant by the 
United States in Vietnam. Its health effects are sharply disputed. 
</P>
<P>
The VA, relying on a review by an 11-member scientific committee, ruled in 1985 
that only one condition, chloracne, could be considered a service-connected 
effect of exposure to Agent Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson rejected a challenge by the veterans' group to the scientific 
committee's review of studies on the effects of Agent Orange. But the judge 
said the standards the VA used in making its rules violated a 1984 federal law 
that was supposed to help Vietnam veterans get the health benefits they were 
due. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson said the VA improperly required proof of a cause-and-effect 
relationship between the herbicide and a disease for which benefits would be 
granted. Instead, he said, the agency should have required only that statistics 
show a significant correlation between dioxin exposure and a disease, or an 
"increased risk of incidence." 
</P>
<P>
The federal law does not spell out the proper standard, but comments by members 
of Congress involved in passing the law showed that they opposed an overly 
stringent standard and felt that cause-and-effect proof was unnecessary, 
Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said the VA had relied on statistical relationships, without requiring 
proof of causation, in granting benefits to veterans who were amputees and 
developed heart disease. Congress did the same thing in granting benefits to 
former prisoners of war who suffered various diseases, relying on a VA 
statistical study, Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also found an error in the VA's refusal to apply to its Agent Orange 
regulations the same "benefit of the doubt" policy it uses for review of 
individual benefit cases -- a policy that favors the veteran in close 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
Although the language of the law is unclear, the "remedial purpose" of the law 
favors a lenient standard, Henderson said. Noting that veterans would be 
entitled to a favorable standard if they made individual claims, he said 
Congress would not have intended to put them in a worse position through a 
collective regulation.

A man who drove a Cadillac with a live squirrel tied to a windshield wiper was 
charged with unlawful possession of the bushy tailed rodent, officials said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
John B. Griffin, 49, described as "a loner" who may be living at an area 
campground, was arrested Sunday after witnesses complained of a car traveling 
on Main Street with a squirrel attached to a windshield wiper, Police Chief 
Gary Sibilia said. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin was "irate and combative" when police stopped him, Sibilia said. The 
squirrel, tied to the wiper by a nylon cord, was "frightened but not hurt," 
Sibilia said. 
</P>
<P>
"He said the squirrel was his friend," Sibilia said. "The squirrel's fine now. 
It was taken by the environmental police, who brought it to a sanctuary." 
</P>
<P>
Griffin was charged with disorderly conduct and illegal possession of a gray 
squirrel, Sibilia said.

RESIDENTS NEAR NOW-SILENT SIRENS DON'T MISS AIR RAID ALARMS OF OLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Canoga Park Community Center museum has a relic that it doesn't want. 
</P>
<P>
It's a 1950s-style air raid siren -- a memento of the days when San Fernando 
Valley residents received regular Cold War reminders that Soviet bombers or 
intercontinental ballistic missiles could be on their way at any time. 
</P>
<P>
The siren is perched atop a rickety wooden tower above the Owensmouth Avenue 
building. It is strategically placed so that its mournful wail can alert a 
nearby neighborhood as well as the Canoga Park business district. 
</P>
<P>
But the cone-shaped siren doesn't work. And neither do the 400 other air raid 
warning devices scattered around Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency warning network was unplugged in 1985 after officials discovered 
that more than 30% of the sirens were broken and would be useless if a nuclear 
attack was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Valley's sirens remain in place, however. Los Angeles city 
officials say it would be too costly to remove the estimated 75 sirens that are 
spaced at about one-mile intervals between North Hollywood and Chatsworth. 
Citywide, there are about 200. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision was made to leave them where they are," said Karen Patterson, the 
city's disaster preparedness coordinator. "It was determined it would be very 
expensive to take them down. They weren't hurting anybody. So they just left 
them up." 
</P>
<P>
For about 40 years, air raid sirens were a prominent fixture in the lives of 
virtually every Valley resident. 
</P>
<P>
The sirens were tested in unison at 10 a.m. on the last Friday of every month. 
In the 1950s and early '60s, neighborhoods were clustered in pockets across the 
Valley -- each within earshot of sirens typically placed atop tall fire 
stations or attached to 30-foot steel poles. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of each month's test, residents could hear the distant echoes of 
sirens miles away shutting down long after their own community's alarm had 
quit. 
</P>
<P>
By the 1970s, however, the Valley and other parts of Los Angeles had grown to 
where residents of some new neighborhoods couldn't hear the sirens. A 1983 
study indicated that even if all the sirens worked, only 42% of the county's 
residents were within hearing range. 
</P>
<P>
When the county Board of Supervisors ordered an end to the monthly tests in 
early 1985, Supervisor Kenneth Hahn explained that the sirens were giving 
citizens "a false sense of security. . . . There's no defense against nuclear 
missiles with a warning time of as little as eight minutes" when launched from 
submarines. 
</P>
<P>
The end-of-the-siren-testing order was music to the ears of some. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good idea to stop using them. I was very happy," said Elan Dorriz, 
who for 15 years has operated his Tarzana hair salon next to a siren that is 
mounted on a pole above a Clark Street sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very ugly sound. It was very scary. Everybody would jump out of their 
skin when the siren came on." 
</P>
<P>
Reseda repair shop owner Gary Gulessorian said his customers were often jolted 
by the piercing shrill of the siren that still towers above his Sherman Way 
garage and office. 
</P>
<P>
On one occasion, Gulessorian recalled, a friend who had just come from Lebanon 
where air attacks were common hit the floor when the siren went off. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'What is that?' I kidded him, and I told him the Japanese were 
attacking. He said, 'What should we do?' " 
</P>
<P>
Studio City resident Margie Johnson remembers the siren that still stands a few 
hundred yards from her home of 42 years as being loud enough to awaken her from 
her soundest sleep -- although it never went off at night. 
</P>
<P>
When the siren was bolted to the top of a 15-foot tower on the roof of a city 
fire station near Coldwater Canyon Avenue and Ventura Boulevard in the early 
1950s, residents were warned of the monthly tests so they wouldn't panic, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Newcomers to the Valley -- those who weren't around when the monthly tests took 
place -- were surprised to learn that the sirens have been disconnected. 
</P>
<P>
"I never heard it go off, but then I can't remember us having an air raid since 
we moved here a year and a half ago," said Woodland Hills resident Marc 
Sardella, who has a view of a Canoga Avenue siren from his front door. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Count on It' 
</P>
<P>
"I'd always figured that if we were in a war situation, I'd be able to count on 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbor Gloria Andreae was equally shocked. "I've looked at it as a protection 
the 3 1/2 years I've lived here. They don't work? Great. They're no good if 
they're disconnected." 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth resident Jo Ann Suzukawa said she has all but forgotten about the 
Corbin Avenue siren behind her house. She said that when she first moved into 
her Tuba Street home 10 years ago, visiting friends would ask what the 
hat-shaped object was. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even notice it now. A tree in the back yard pretty much hides it," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Trees also partially screen a siren from nearby homes on Parthenia Street in 
Winnetka. In Encino, a 30-foot-tall siren is hidden among high-rise office 
buildings that have sprung up in recent years at Gloria Avenue and Ventura 
Boulevard.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COSTA MESA;

<P>
RULING WITHHELD ON SLOW-GROWTH CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge on Monday withheld judgment on the latest legal 
challenge to a voter-approved slow-growth measure -- this one in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Judge William F. Rylaarsdam said he needed time to review arguments in the 
controversial case before deciding whether city officials in Costa Mesa can 
move ahead with plans to make new developments contingent on improvements in 
existing public services. 
</P>
<P>
Judges have thrown out slow-growth measures in San Clemente and San Juan 
Capistrano that were found to place an unfair and unconstitutional burden on 
developers and property-owners to solve citywide problems that they had not 
necessarily created. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa officials maintain, however, that Measure G -- as their slow-growth 
initiative is known -- is narrower than those approved by voters in San Juan 
Capistrano and San Clemente, and that it marks a legitimate effort to respond 
to demands on strained city resources. 
</P>
<P>
But Jeffrey Thomas, attorney for the Building and Industry Assn., said: "Our 
position is that any differences between this initiative and the ones already 
struck down are cosmetic and insignificant. 
</P>
<P>
"On the most important issue -- traffic -- (the initiatives) are exactly the 
same, except Costa Mesa's measure may be even more stringent," he contended.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA; 
</P>
<P>
NEW CATHOLIC PARISH WILL OPEN IN JULY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new Catholic parish, San Francisco Solano, will open July 3 in Rancho Santa 
Margarita, according to an announcement Monday by Norman F. McFarland, bishop 
of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Until the church building is completed next year, the congregation will meet at 
Santa Margarita High School, which is next to the 4-acre site. Both properties 
were donated to the church by the Moiso and O'Neill families, which have owned 
the land for generations. 
</P>
<P>
The families named the parish after the first Christian name bestowed on the 
Trabuco Mesa during the Portola expedition of 1769. 
</P>
<P>
The church will be funded by potential parishioners who now attend three 
neighboring parishes: St. Cecilia in Tustin, St. Kilian in Mission Viejo and 
Santiago de Compostella in El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
McFarland named Father Michael Pecharich founding pastor. 
</P>
<P>
Pecharich, currently director of the Ministry to Priests Office for the Diocese 
of Orange, graduated from St. Anthony High School in Long Beach and St. John 
Seminary. He also holds a master's degree in counseling from Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Pecharich, ordained in 1973, has served as an associate pastor at St. Bridget 
of Sweden in Van Nuys, St. Edwards in Dana Point and San Antonio de Padua del 
Canon in Anaheim Hills.

2 ARMED TEEN-AGERS ARRESTED IN CAR THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Los Angeles County youths were arrested Monday afternoon on the westbound 
Garden Grove Freeway near Golden West after they allegedly stole a car from the 
owner as he left an east Orange detail shop, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The two 16-year-old males, armed with handguns, approached the owner of a 1986 
IROC Chevrolet Camaro about 2 p.m. Monday as he was leaving Elite Auto 
Detailing at 704 W. Katella Ave. and demanded that he give them his car, said 
Sgt. Tim Brown of the Orange police. 
</P>
<P>
The teens then fled in the car and headed for the westbound Garden Grove 
Freeway. Brown said authorities throughout the area were alerted to the theft. 
</P>
<P>
The two were arrested without incident by a Garden Grove police officer after 
they were stopped along the freeway, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
The youths, who were booked on suspicion of robbery, were being held in Orange 
City Jail pending transfer to juvenile hall.

THIRD MILD QUAKE SINCE FRIDAY JIGGLES COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A mild earthquake Monday was more of an annoyance than anything else to 
northern Orange County residents awakened by the 5:44 a.m. temblor. 
</P>
<P>
No damage or injuries were reported in Orange or Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
Seismologists at Caltech said the shaker registered a 2.9 and was centered 
beneath the Hacienda Heights area in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The quake followed two temblors that shook the Southland over the weekend. A 
quake measuring 3.7 struck 1 mile northwest of Brea late Saturday night. On 
Friday, seismologists reported a magnitude-3.4 quake centered 27 miles offshore 
from Oceanside in northern San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt it," La Habra Police Capt. John Rees said about Monday's quake. "But it 
wasn't as big as the night before. This one really smacked us. Normally, you 
hear a rumble that precedes the quake. This time I didn't hear anything." 
</P>
<P>
Rees said operators at the La Habra station received a few calls about the 
temblor but no reports of damage or injury to residents. 
</P>
<P>
Police and public safety officials in nearby Brea and Placentia also reported 
no damage. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's temblor was unrelated to the twin quakes in October, 1987, which 
caused much damage in nearby Whittier.

CHRISTIAN, JEWISH, ISLAMIC LEADERS REACT TO RUSHDIE OUTCRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County academics and visiting members of the National Council of Churches on 
Monday agreed that an interfaith conference on how literature can defame any 
religion would be of benefit to Muslims, Jews and Christians. 
</P>
<P>
During a lunch meeting at UC Irvine, members of the NCC's Office of 
Christian/Muslim Relations and the local Academy for Judaic, Christian and 
Islamic Studies learned that they had both been contemplating similar 
conferences in reaction to the outcry surrounding Salman Rushdie's "The Satanic 
Verses" and Ayatollah Ruholla Khomeini's subsequent death threat against the 
author. 
</P>
<P>
Since the uproar earlier this year, Christians for the most part have supported 
Rushdie's right to freedom of expression, while Muslims have insisted that 
their religion is defamed by the book, said Marston Speight, executive director 
of Christian-Muslim relations office of the New York-based NCC, a group of 40 
million mainline Protestants. 
</P>
<P>
"Our whole life is so secularized, we're unaware," Speight said. "The outrage 
of a community not so secularized shows us the degree to which we've lost our 
sense of the importance of the holy in our lives." 
</P>
<P>
Such a conference on defamation would seek to define the "holy things" that the 
world's three great monotheistic religions hold in high respect, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure there would be divergent views among Christians," Speight said. 
</P>
<P>
It should also include an interfaith discussion of "The Last Temptation of 
Christ," a movie featuring scenes that some Christians found offensive, as well 
as "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion," a 19th-Century anti-Semitic French 
play, said George Grose, president of the Academy, a nonprofit Anaheim Hills 
research, educational and dialogue institute that promotes the historic and 
theological links among Christianity, Judaism and Islam. 
</P>
<P>
Others at Monday's conference suggested that the limits of diversity in a 
pluralistic society should also be explored. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen members of the NCC group had swung through the county as part of their 
annual conference held in Los Angeles to meet with Grose and the other members 
of his pioneering group in Judaic, Christian and Muslim studies. 
</P>
<P>
Grose has taught a UCI course and tours college campuses with a dialogue 
program featuring Rabbi Henri Front of Temple Beth David and Muzamil Siddiqi, 
director of the Islamic Center of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Siddiqi has invited the Christian group to lunch today at his center's Garden 
Grove mosque. 
</P>
<P>
Siddiqi said Monday that Muslims remain concerned about the support Rushdie 
received, despite criticism in the Muslim world of his novel. 
</P>
<P>
"It has concerned many of us, the way the Western world responded," Siddiqi 
said. "A very large number came out in full support of Salman Rushdie. 
</P>
<P>
"That has created the feeling in the minds of many Muslins that there is now an 
open field. You can do whatever you want. . . . Hate campaigns, slander are all 
OK under freedom of expression." 
</P>
<P>
The NCC, however, issued a statement in March expressing "deep sympathy" for 
Muslims who were insulted and offended by negative descriptions of Mohammed in 
Rushdie's novel. "An offense to the religious beliefs and sensitivities to the 
followers of Islam or any religion should be viewed as serious as an offense 
against the religious beliefs and sensitivities of Christians," the statement 
said.

FOSTER PARENTS TO MORE THAN 30 CHILDREN OVER PAST 13 YEARS AMONG GROUP TO BE 
HONORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Lynda and Leonard Stiles have cared for more than 30 foster children, and both 
say that each face and smile, voice and laugh are etched into their memories 
like threads in a tapestry. 
</P>
<P>
The couple hadn't intended to make parenting other people's children a 
lifetime's passion when they sought a foster care license 13 years ago. But 
amid the joy and the pain, the life style "just sort of grew on us," Lynda 
Stiles said. 
</P>
<P>
"Each one of the children has come in and taught us a lesson," she said. "They 
have given us far more than we have given them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Remarkable People' 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Orange County Board of Supervisors, Social Services Agency and 
Probation Department will honor Leonard and Lynda Stiles, as well as six other 
county families, for their commitment to foster care. 
</P>
<P>
"I would characterize them as remarkable people," said Larry Leaman, director 
of the Social Services Agency. "They are citizens who will take a child, or 
sometimes several, into their homes at a time when it is the only alternative 
available to us when children are removed from the custody of their parents. 
</P>
<P>
"They are a godsend." 
</P>
<P>
While many foster parents perform exceptional services, such as caring for 
displaced children who may have special medical and emotional needs, there 
remains a critical shortage of foster homes in the county, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
About 600 Orange County families now provide foster care. But there are about 
2,000 more children in group homes or institutions in need of foster homes. 
</P>
<P>
In previous years, the foster care program in the county has come under fire 
for ineffectiveness in recruiting foster families, inadequate training and a 
high turnover of foster parents. From 1984 to 1985, the county's foster program 
lost more than 100 families, dropping to a low of 583 families. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, however, the number of foster families has stabilized at about 600 
families, and county officials said most criticisms have been addressed. 
</P>
<P>
"Every county throughout the nation has experienced a shortage of foster homes; 
it's not a product of recruitment," said Barbara Labitzke, coordinator of the 
foster care program and director of the Southern Area Fostercare Effort, which 
coordinates foster care in an eight-county area. "What we found is that we have 
to nurture the ones we have and provide support services." 
</P>
<P>
For the Stileses, the foster program has given their entire family 
irreplaceable experiences, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple -- Leonard is 62, Lynda is 43 -- have two children of their own, 
Dawn, 24, and Paul, 16. They have adopted two foster children, Timmy, 9, and 
James, 11, and are legal guardians of a 5-year-old girl. In addition, they 
currently are foster parents of a 3-year-old boy and a 16-month-old girl, both 
of whom have special medical needs. 
</P>
<P>
"It took our children, especially the oldest, a long time to adapt," Lynda 
Stiles said of the impact of having dozens of brothers and sisters over the 
years. "But as adults, they thank us often, because it has been such a 
rewarding experience." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Stiles seemed nonplussed when asked how it feels to have an ever-changing 
cast of siblings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a fact all of my life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Stiles said he has learned a lot about being a parent, but isn't sure he 
will assume the burdens of foster care himself one day. 
</P>
<P>
"You get so attached to them," he said. "I don't know if I could take them in 
and then let them go." 
</P>
<P>
Letting them go is indeed the most difficult thing, Leonard and Lynda Stiles 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"We all react in different ways," Lynda Stiles said. "Bus (Leonard's family 
nickname) is subdued and quiet, and I want to talk about it. But I tend to cry. 
We usually don't have another (child) right away because of that. We have to 
work through the grief." 
</P>
<P>
But the Stileses said their most important goal as foster parents is to reunite 
children with their natural families. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Families Reunited 
</P>
<P>
According to the Social Services Agency, 50% of children in the foster care 
system eventually are reunited with the families they were born into. 
</P>
<P>
And for many young parents who find themselves overwhelmed by the demands of 
parenting, foster parents such as the Stileses serve as role models. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had natural mothers as young as 13 years old, and I kind of end up 
being their mother, too," Lynda Stiles said. 
</P>
<P>
The Stileses said they realize, too, that most children still want to return to 
their natural families, even when they have been victimized in those homes. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a little boy who had been severely beaten, but was homesick all the 
time," Lynda Stiles said. "Fortunately, the abusive partner had left. I knew 
the family didn't have material things to offer, but I saw that bond and knew 
where he really wanted to be." 
</P>
<P>
For adopted sons James and Timmy, however, there is no place else they would 
rather be. 
</P>
<P>
When he grows up, Timmy said he wants to be a surveyor like Leonard Stiles. But 
he admits that if that doesn't work out, he would just as soon be a 
professional skateboarder. James, who came to the Stiles home as a foster child 
at the age of 1, said he hasn't minded his sometimes hectic youth. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fun having lots of brothers and sisters because there are always kids you 
can talk to and do things with," said James. 
</P>
<P>
The other foster care parents to be honored are Anita Barber of San Clemente; 
Joanne and Jerald Noyes of Stanton; Cherri and John Olson of Fountain Valley; 
Debra and Robert Smith of Anaheim; Linda and Richard Smith of Yorba Linda, and 
Lorraine Connie Zeek of Fountain Valley.

BABY FOUND DEAD WHEN SLEEPING FATHER WAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Newport Beach police are investigating the death of an infant girl who 
apparently died when her father rolled on top of her while asleep on a couch in 
their home, a spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Six-week-old Tyra Corbett was pronounced dead Sunday morning at Hoag Hospital. 
Her father, James B. Corbett III, 21, was arrested on suspicion of involuntary 
manslaughter and freed on $10,000 bond Sunday night, according to Newport Beach 
Police Officer Robert Oakley. 
</P>
<P>
Oakley said the baby's mother, Michelle Marie Koger, 20, awoke about 7:20 a.m. 
Sunday in the family's apartment in the 1300 block of West Balboa Boulevard and 
went to the crib to check on her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Discovering the baby gone, she went into the living room, where she found 
Corbett asleep on the couch, he said. Koger shook Corbett to awake him, "and 
when he rolls over, the baby's underneath him." 
</P>
<P>
The infant was not breathing, he said, and the couple called paramedics, who 
rushed Tyra to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the coroner's office said a cause of death has not been 
determined pending tissue and toxicological studies. Oakley said a doctor's 
report indicates that there was no evidence of other abuse but that police are 
investigating "to determine all the facts in the case in order to present them 
properly in court." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are also examining whether the father was under the influence of 
alcohol or drugs at the time, he said. Although it appears that the baby died 
when her father rolled on top of her and that no foul play was involved, Oakley 
said, the possibility of foul play "will be definitely investigated." 
</P>
<P>
Oakley said it was not known why Corbett took the baby from her crib. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Corbett nor Koger could be reached for comment.

ANAHEIM'S HIGH SCHOOLS PREPARE FOR 1-DAY STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anaheim Union High School District officials are lining up security guards and 
going down the substitute teacher rolls to gear up for a planned teacher strike 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But they want to assure all parties that it will be business as usual. 
Wednesday "will be a regular school day," Assistant Supt. LeRoy Kellogg said. 
</P>
<P>
The district sent the same message in a letter to parents Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim Secondary Teachers Assn., which represents the district's 900 
teachers, has announced that it will stage a 1-day strike Wednesday -- the 
statewide Day of the Teacher -- to demonstrate impatience with stalled contract 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Absences Expected 
</P>
<P>
Kellogg said officials expected some student absences but no more than usual: 
"We are asking that all students and parents support the district. It is a 
regular school day. If students don't show up for school, they will be 
considered truant." 
</P>
<P>
Kellogg said district officials have not yet decided whether to hire private 
security guards or use administrators as monitors. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to protect our property as well as our staff," he said, but Kellogg 
conceded that "we don't have reason to believe anything might happen." 
</P>
<P>
"I understand they're nervous," said Judy Thomas, executive director of the 
teachers union. "They're hiring security guards and setting up command posts. 
It sounds like they're setting up for an army. They don't know their employees 
very well. There's not going to be any violence." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Teachers' Salary Demands 
</P>
<P>
For this school year, teachers want a 41% share of the budget surplus after a 
2.5% reserve is set aside. For next school year, Thomas said, teachers are 
seeking a cost-of-living adjustment of about 3.2%, plus 41% of what is left 
over after a 3% reserve is set aside. 
</P>
<P>
District negotiators do not want to guarantee a pay raise for next year but 
have offered teachers a share if there is a budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole question is the treatment of teachers by the district, our position 
being that they ignored us," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were not in the budget at all (for a raise this year). But for next year, 
now that they're developing that budget, we want them to hear us, to make us a 
priority." 
</P>

<P>
Cypress College, which won the Orange Empire Conference baseball title 
Saturday, is in the midst of a 13-day break. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers won't play again until May 19 in the first round of the 
double-elimination Southern California Regionals. 
</P>
<P>
Second-place Rancho Santiago and third-place Orange Coast don't have such a

The winner of the Rancho Santiago-East Los Angeles game plays Orange Coast or 
L.A. Valley Saturday. The winners of the Grossmont-Cerritos and Citrus-San 
Diego Mesa games also play Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The winners of Saturday's games will then join the six top-seeded teams, all 
conference champions, in the regionals. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress (31-13), Palomar (21-15-1), L.A. Harbor (29-13) and one of the 
wild-card winners will play at Rancho Santiago College in the three-day 
tournament. Long Beach (24-14), Ventura (29-9), Mt. San Jacinto (24-15) and the 
second of the wild-card winners will play at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
Softball: Fullerton, Cypress, Saddleback and Golden West qualified for the 
16-team, single-elimination first round of the Southern California playoffs, 
which begin Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, the second-seeded team, plays host to No. 15 Bakersfield, and 
Cypress, seeded fifth, plays host to No. 12 Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback, the No. 7 team, plays host to No. 10 Southwestern, and No. 9 Golden 
West is at No. 8 Antelope Valley. Palomar, the No. 1-seeded team, will playing

</P>
<P>
The winners of Wednesday's games advance to the second round, which is a 
best-of-three format and starts Saturday at 3 p.m. The second games are 
scheduled for Sunday at noon, followed by third games if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The four second-round winners meet the four winners from the North in the 
double-elimination state tournament May 19-21 at Golden West College. 
</P>
<P>
More softball: Kristin Jacobs of Fullerton was voted the pitcher of the year 
and Rose Ferrante of Cypress was selected player of the year by the Orange 
Empire Conference softball coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Margo Davis, who led Fullerton to the conference title by a six-game margin, 
was chosen coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs, a sophomore from Central Catholic High School in Portland, Ore., was 
28-7 with a 0.47 earned-run average. In conference play, she was 15-1 with a 
0.24 ERA. She also was named state pitcher of the year. Jacobs already has 
signed a letter of intent to attend Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrante, a freshman catcher from Savanna High School, hit .401 with seven 
doubles, eight triples, six home runs and 40 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs and Colleen Moore of Cypress were the conference's first-team pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
Heather Illsley of Rancho Santiago, Gretchen Bock of Golden West, Debbie Wagner 
of Fullerton, Kim Braatz of Saddleback and Brenda Velasquez of Orange Coast

Middle blocker Scott Lindquist of Orange Coast and teammate Dan Murray, an 
outside hitter, also were named to the first team. Golden West's Tim Johnson 
also made the first team. Kurt Dumm of Orange Coast and Doug Partis of Golden

LANKARD MAKES PITCH AT COMEBACK;

KATELLA HIGH GRADUATE BOUNCES BACK FROM KNEE INJURY

<P>
Steve Lankard capped a successful pitching career at Katella High School in 
1981, his senior year. His team won the Empire League title and advanced to the 
Southern Section 3-A semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Lankard tried out at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
Strike one. 
</P>
<P>
He tried out at Fullerton College. 
</P>
<P>
Strike two. 
</P>
<P>
Lankard, a right-hander, finally caught on at Cypress College. After a season, 
he transferred to Rancho Santiago, then to Cal State Long Beach, where he was 
named the school's pitcher of the year in 1985. That June, Lankard, a relief 
pitcher, signed with the Texas Rangers as a 19th-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
After two years of Class-A ball, he moved up to the Tulsa Drillers, a double-A 
team in the Texas League. 
</P>
<P>
With just two weeks remaining in the regular season and the first-place 
Drillers heading into the playoffs, Lankard's professional baseball career 
apparently was shattered. 
</P>
<P>
 A hitter lined a ball straight onto Lankard's kneecap. 
</P>
<P>
It looked like strike three. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was out in the bullpen when it happened, and I saw him go down," said Jeff 
Andrews, the Drillers' pitching coach. "The first reaction I saw from him was 
an effort to basically crawl for the ball. After about two knee steps, he went 
down flat on his stomach and kind of rolled over. I knew it was something 
serious." 
</P>
<P>
Lankard's knee was broken in seven places. 
</P>
<P>
"It was broken in such a way, it was really just like corn bread, just pieces, 
just pieces all over the place," Lankard said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the operation, Lankard's doctor told him it was the worst knee injury he 
had seen in 25 years. He didn't think he would be able to save Lankard's knee. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God he saved it," said Lankard, who came out of the surgery determined 
to rehabilitate his knee and return to the mound. Perhaps the hardest part was 
being a spectator as his team won the Texas League championship. 
</P>
<P>
"The rehab was tough at first," he said. "I lost so much muscle in my thigh and 
quadriceps, (just) three weeks (of inactivity) and I had no muscle. First there 
is a lot of stretching, just trying to get it to bend. Then I started weight 
work, and I couldn't lift one pound. It hurt. Then you start to see progress, 
and it keeps your hopes up. It took about three months to rehab where I could 
run full speed and everything." 
</P>
<P>
He began throwing a bit in January and surprised everyone, well almost 
everyone, by showing up for spring training in March. 
</P>
<P>
"I know Lank and his personality," Andrews said. "I knew that if anybody could 
come back, he would be the one. For him to be throwing when I talked to him in 
January was nothing short of a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
Lankard has come back. This season he has more appearances than any pitcher on 
the Drillers. 
</P>
<P>
He uses sidearm and submarine style deliveries. "That is how he makes up for 
his lack of velocity -- with the deception and the different arm angle and 
break on the ball that you don't see from a conventional pitcher," Andrews 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The style has helped him strike out 21 batters in 28 2/3 innings. He is 2-2 
with three saves and a 3.45 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
"What he does is provide (us with) a guy who surprisingly is able to get 
left-handers out," Andrews said. "That has allowed him to be used in 
middle-short relief against either right- or left-handers. His appearances and 
innings worked will go up because of that." 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Hamelin, who set state community college records with 31 home runs and 
107 RBIs at Rancho Santiago College in 1988, is tearing up the Southern League 
this season for the Memphis, Tenn., Chicks, a double-A team in the Kansas City 
Royals' system. 
</P>
<P>
After a season of Class-A ball in the Northwest League with Eugene, Ore., 
Hamelin, moved up to double A this year. Hamelin, a left-handed-hitting first 
baseman who graduated from Irvine High School, leads the Chicks in batting 
average (.333), hits (32), runs scored (19), RBIs (19), walks (23) and home 
runs (7). He is second in the league in doubles (six) and he has the league's 
third-highest batting average. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen of his 32 hits were for extra bases, which accounts for his team-high 
.633 slugging percentage and his nickname. 
</P>
<P>
"His nickname is 'The Hammer,' " said Ted Tornow, a team spokesman. "He is just 
a big old boy and he pounds the living daylights out of that ball." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Joe Breeden said Hamelin, 6-foot-1 and 235 pounds, "has hit two or three 
that have gone 500-feet plus." 
</P>
<P>
Angel update: Bob Rose, third baseman for the Midland, Tex., Angels, a double-A 
team in the Texas League, leads his club in home runs (six) and is second in 
RBIs (20) despite having missed the past 11 games with strained ligaments in 
his right thumb. 
</P>
<P>
He injured his thumb in late April when he was jammed twice on back-to-back 
pitches, Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, a San Dimas High School graduate, is batting .389 in his first season of 
double-A ball. The Angels are in first place in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Rose played Class-A ball, batting .284 with 13 home runs and 78 RBIs 
for the Angels' Quad City club in Davenport, Iowa.

CUCCIA NAMED TO COACH FOOTBALL AT EL DORADO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fred Cuccia, varsity football coach at California High School in San Ramon, has 
been named to a similar position at El Dorado High in Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
Cuccia replaces Carl Sweet, who resigned last month after three seasons to 
become the school's athletic director. El Dorado was 6-6 last season under 
Sweet. 
</P>
<P>
Cuccia spent one season at California High, where he led the Grizzlies to a 3-7 
record with three victories in the East Bay Athletic League. 
</P>
<P>
Cuccia also has coached at Glendale Hoover and South Pasadena. He led Hoover to 
an 8-2 record in 1985, but the school forfeited eight victories for using an 
ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
South Pasadena forfeited six victories in 1987 under Cuccia, also for using an 
ineligible player. Cuccia was among 25 candidates who applied for the position.

U.S. URGED TO RETURN ASSETS OF O.C.-BASED S&amp;L

The roughly 22,000 investors who bought $200 million in bonds issued by the 
parent of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn. are unlikely to recover their money 
unless regulators turn loose Lincoln's assets, the parent's chairman said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of the bondholders, many of them elderly investors who sunk their life 
savings into the securities, "totally depends on whether or not we get back 
some of the operable assets" of Lincoln, said American Continental Corp.'s 
Charles H. Keating Jr. in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix-based American Continental filed for protection from creditors in U.S. 
Bankruptcy Court on April 13 when it realized that federal regulators were 
considering seizing Irvine-based Lincoln, its primary subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
The move was viewed as an effort to hold off the regulators, but federal 
officials succeeded in gaining control of Lincoln the next day. Regulators 
alleged that it was being operated in an "unsafe and unsound" manner by 
American Continental, although the S&amp;L was not declared insolvent. Lincoln 
was placed into a conservatorship. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unsecured Creditors 
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy filing threw into doubt whether the 22,000 bondholders would 
ever see their money again. As unsecured creditors of American Continental, the 
bondholders would rank behind other creditors who are owed money by the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of bondholders have joined in several class-action lawsuits filed 
against American Continental, Keating, other corporate officers and directors, 
and the lawyers and accountants who advised the holding company. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs claim that the company misrepresented the bonds, which were 
considered below investment grade and were not covered by the government's 
deposit insurance program. Some said the salespeople who sold the bonds at 
Lincoln's 29 branches in Southern California made it appear as if they were as 
secure as federally insured certificates of deposit. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, a controversial businessman who has clashed frequently with 
regulators, has filed a lawsuit against federal regulators seeking to regain 
control over certain assets of several Lincoln subsidiaries. Those assets 
include the luxurious Phoenician Resort, the Crescent Hotel and the partly 
built Estrella planned community. The three Phoenix-area developments were 
funded by Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Keating portrayed his litigation as the only real hope for bondholders. 
Lawsuits filed against him would be fruitless because all his money is tied up 
in American Continental and Lincoln, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We can win in the courtroom and recover some of our operating assets," Keating 
said. "Then we go back in business, exploit them (the assets) as we would have 
in the normal course of business and ultimately pay off the bondholders." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Risk Acknowledged 
</P>
<P>
Keating acknowledged Monday that the bonds were risky, saying there was "some 
parallel to junk, or high-yield" bonds. But he insisted that the company did 
not misrepresent them and that the bonds were safe before the company's 
bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
Keating said he was so confident that American Continental could pay off the 
bonds that he would not have hesitated to recommend them to anyone, even his 
favorite Catholic charities. One of the largest creditors in American 
Continental's bankruptcy is the Sisters of Charity organization in Cincinnati, 
which holds $444,000 in corporate bonds. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have recommended the bonds to any buyer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Keating said American Continental had not missed a payment on the bonds until 
it filed for bankruptcy protection last month. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not then and do not now have any feeling that those bonds weren't 
legitimate instruments issued to people who fully understood what they were 
getting," he said. "We had every intention to make those good. 
</P>
<P>
"If we didn't recognize something, it was that the march of regulation would 
ultimately end up with the confiscation of our operating businesses," he said. 
"We didn't see that. I'm sure that can be short-sightedness on my part or hope 
springing eternal in the human breast, but we just didn't see that. We probably 
should have."

PETERS SOUNDS WARNING; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTHLAND GROWTH TIED TO QUALITY OF LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Although its growth and affluence make Southern California one of the "most 
exciting economies on the globe right now," business consultant Tom Peters 
warned Monday that the area's future could be endangered if the quality of life 
is allowed to decline. 
</P>
<P>
"We still have a chance to mess it up," Peters said in remarks preceding an 
afternoon lecture sponsored by KOCE-TV in Irvine. More than 1,000 Orange County 
business executives attended the session. 
</P>
<P>
Author of the 1982 best seller "In Search of Excellence: Lessons From America's 
Best Run Companies," Peters said Southern California must devise effective 
strategies for dealing with pollution and congestion and for maintaining 
educational standards. 
</P>
<P>
A combination of factors, including a large immigrant population, a growing 
force of entrepreneurs, a proliferation of small businesses, an available pool 
of capital and an educated work force have created an economic boom throughout 
Southern California, Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the region may overtake New York as the largest banking center in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
The area's growth has been "very much small-business driven," he said. More 
than 90% of Southern California workers are found in companies with 50 or fewer 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these businesses subcontract work from larger companies, which no 
longer insist on controlling every step of the production process. In the past, 
Peters said, some car companies even "owned the sheep that went into the wool 
of the seat covers." Today, "everybody's going to subcontract . . . to whoever 
can do it the best." 
</P>
<P>
The service industry is an under-appreciated force behind America's economic 
growth, Peters said. "I think the service sector is the best thing the U.S. has 
going for it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But economic growth should be tempered by quality-of-life concerns, he said. A 
decline in air quality, freeway conditions and educational standards could spur 
citizens and companies to relocate to more attractive parts of the country. 
Many businesses already have moved from California because of such concerns, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Peters, 46, achieved sudden fame after publication of his 1982 book, which 
cited examples of well-run American companies. He wrote a follow-up book, "A 
Passion for Excellence: The Leadership Difference in 1985." He runs a 
management consulting firm in Palo Alto.

ABC CALLS IT A DAY ON 'MOONLIGHTING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Moonlighting," whose ratings plummeted this season as dramatically as they 
once rose, will shine its final rays of quirky comedy on Sunday, ABC said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel the show has reached a creative conclusion and that this is the 
appropriate time to end the series," the network said in a formal statement. 
"We are quite proud of the innovation which 'Moonlighting' brought to 
television during the past four years, and appreciative of the program's 
tremendous contribution to ABC's program schedule during that time." 
</P>
<P>
Ratings for the critically acclaimed and once-supremely popular show had been 
dropping since a series of contrived plot twists last season. Viewers clearly 
lost interest in the repartee and sexual tension between Cybill Shepherd's 
Maddie Hayes and Bruce Willis' David Addison. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people went, 'Well, that was fun,' and they had enough of it," said 
the show's creator, Glenn Gordon Caron, who left the show last year amid 
turmoil over plot derailments and a long-brewing conflict with Shepherd. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of it may be (a question of) how long can one burn that bright," Caron 
said. "The intensity with which it was viewed at the time when it was immensely 
popular was just extraordinary." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, at the end of the 1986-87 season, the show was being watched in an 
average of 19.5 million households a week, but the number had steadily 
declined. The show was doing so poorly in its usual Tuesday night slot early 
this season that ABC pulled it off the schedule, then brought it back on 
Sundays at 8 p.m., where in recent weeks it had been attracting fewer than 6 
million households a week. 
</P>
<P>
Although no one connected with the series would divulge details of the final 
installment, Caron confirmed that the episode "definitely confronts the fact 
that it's the last show." 
</P>
<P>
Shepherd, whose next project is a starring role in the movie "Texasville," the 
sequel to "The Last Picture Show," on Monday called "Moonlighting" "a wonderful 
opportunity. It brought me great success. I enjoyed playing the character of 
Maddie Hayes and I'm sorry that it's over." 
</P>
<P>
Caron attributed the show's loss of popularity to a variety of causes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there were a number of things: Being moved to Sunday at 8 sure didn't 
help . . . the number of reruns, the plot twists." 
</P>
<P>
Last season's story problems began when Shepherd got pregnant and the producers 
decided to incorporate her condition in the show, having Maddie move home with 
her parents to think things over. When Shepherd returned to work full time, 
they had Maddie marry a stranger she met on a train, leaving many viewers 
feeling betrayed. Loyal fans deluged ABC with angry letters and phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Even before that, however, the series, which debuted in the spring of 1985, had 
been plagued by schedule over-runs and creative struggles that often brought 
production delays. "Moonlighting" became infamous for the number of repeats 
served up every season. 
</P>
<P>
Willis, who catapulted from an unknown to Emmy Award-winning TV star and then 
on to movie fame in such films as "Die Hard" and "Blind Date," said he was 
proud of his work on the show. 
</P>
<P>
"When the show was at its height, it was very much like playing a brand new 
song that never had been played before," he said. "Some people may not have 
liked the song, we may not have always played it exactly to fit people's 
tastes, but when we were 'on,' we hit some notes that will never be played 
again."

TAKING A SPIN AT A 'BIG SHOW' 
</P>

<P>
Call it interactive theater -- theater where the audience gets to be in the 
play. An early example was Ayn Rand's "The Night of January 16th" (1935), where 
the spectators became a jury. A current example is New York's "Tony and Tina's 
Wedding," where everybody throws rice and kisses the bride. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's "Tamara." Who wants to pay $55 to shlep around a marble villa 
watching expensive people commit the seven deadly sins? Lots of us. "Tamara" 
has been running for five years. 
</P>
<P>
Two new shows promising inter-action opened in Los Angeles over the weekend. 
The first was "A Night in Casablanca" -- as in Rick's Cafe Americain, 
supposedly re-created at 157 N. La Cienega Blvd. (213) 988-1048. This has some 
amazingly bad actors slinking around the restaurant pretending to be Nazis, 
while we at the tables sip champagne in plastic stemware and wonder what 
theater in Los Angeles is coming to. Cost for the evening, which includes an 
intermission repast, is $55. Rent the movie. 
</P>
<P>
"The Big Show," presented by the Actors' Gang at the Powerhouse in Santa 
Monica, promises to "put the audience on the hot seat" as it examines U.S. 
involvement in Central America. This means that we become a "studio audience" 
for a metaphorical "game show" whose contestants may remind you of certain 
figures in the recent history of Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
The United States (represented by our cheerful cohosts, Lee Arenberg and 
Shannon Holt) has fixed the wheel -- so where she stops, everybody knows. As 
the applause sign blinks on, we in the audience find ourselves cheering like 
nitwits, even though we disapprove of the real-life events being alluded to. We 
know a spoof when we're in one. 
</P>
<P>
This is fun, but it is by no means the same as being put on the hot seat. Take 
out the interaction, and "The Big Show" is traditional agitprop. Oppression is 
all their fault -- the bullies and the zanies who exploit the nice people like 
ourselves. Who puts these clods in power is never addressed. 
</P>
<P>
As a political Saturday morning cartoon, "The Big Show" has its moments. 
Arenberg as the emcee is all smiles and ill-disguised contempt for the fatheads 
who would watch a show like this when they could be out making a buck, which is 
obviously his mission. 
</P>
<P>
Holt makes his co-host (and wife) a nervous ditherer with a pool of goodwill 
that her hubby lacks. She actually believes that that "game" will work out to 
the benefit of the natives involved, and in the second half of the evening she 
takes the show on location -- at which point it seems to change to "2 on the 
Town." Writers R. A. White and Michael Schlitt aren't very rigorous about 
following the rules of their own game, and that fuzzes the form of the piece. 
</P>
<P>
Under Schlitt's direction, the company tears into the show with its usual 
enthusiasm. Ned Bellamy is fine as the fellow who warms up the studio audience 
and as a sawed-off (literally) dictator named Anton Bulldoza, and Brent Hinkley 
is wonderfully goofy as a quiescent coffee-growing peasant who talks 
exclusively in verse. 
</P>
<P>
The company's one performing problem, common to many actors who grew up with 
the tube, is that they don't know how to speak at a low volume without losing 
energy. Since energy is the Actors' Gang's specialty, this needs remedying. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8 p.m. Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. Closes July 1. Tickets $10. 3116 2nd 
St., Santa Monica. (213) 392-6529.

A NEW PAINTING -- AND A NEW PAINT JOB -- AT ART MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, Times Art Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>

The opening today of four newly painted and reinstalled galleries at the County 
Museum of Art makes all the artworks look like brand-new acquisitions, but one 
painting is the real thing. "St. Ignatius Loyola's Vision of Christ and God the 
Father at La Storta," an Italian Baroque altarpiece by Domenichino, is a recent 
gift of the Ahmanson Foundation. The glowing devotional painting, depicting a 
saint at a spellbound moment, goes on view today in the museum's 17th-Century 
gallery. 
</P>
<P>
As a matter of policy, the museum does not disclose prices of new acquisitions, 
but the Domenichino is a rare and beautiful work that many institutions would 
like to have, according to Philip Conisbee, curator of European paintings and 
sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a great deal of eyebrow raising in the museum world" over 
LACMA's good fortune in landing the picture, museum director Earl A. Powell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Though not well known and not in fashion, Domenichino's stock is rising. "He 
has been rediscovered in the last 20 years as part of a scholarly 
re-examination of Italian Baroque painting," Conisbee said. This particular 
canvas, which has been in private European collections and was purchased with 
Ahmanson funds from a London dealer, came to light in the early '80s -- just in 
time to be included in the appendix of Richard Spear's monograph on the artist. 
</P>
<P>
The richly colored altarpiece was commissioned for the Church of Gesu in Rome 
by Cardinal Odoardo Farnese in about 1622, the year St. Ignatius Loyola was 
canonized. The painting hung in the church for awhile but was removed during 
Domenichino's lifetime and replaced with a copy made in his studio. Scholars 
believe that the original was privately sold, but records are incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
"St. Ignatius Loyola's Vision of Christ and God the Father at La Storta" 
portrays a priest on a journey in 1537 to Rome where he planned to seek papal 
approval of the new religious order of Jesuits. At La Storta, 10 miles 
northwest of Rome, the priest had a vision of the holy father and son in which 
Christ declared, "I shall be merciful to thee in Rome." 
</P>
<P>
Domenichino has portrayed this episode in the priest's life as a moment of 
divine inspiration. The rapt priest, on his knees, looks up to the heavens 
where he sees God in human form, Christ holding and pointing to a cross (the 
symbol of the Jesuits) and angels. The congregation appears to float in a 
profusion of golden clouds that are composed of cherubic faces. 
</P>
<P>
Domenichino (1581-1641) was born Domenico Zampieri in Bologna. He was the 
favorite pupil of Annibale Carracci and a friend and rival of painter Guido 
Reni, two of whose works are owned by LACMA. They are currently in a traveling 
exhibition, but, upon their return, the museum will display them with the 
Domenichino and two earlier Ahmanson gifts, Georges de La Tour's "Magdalen With 
the Smoking Flame" and Philippe de Champaigne's "St. Augustine." 
</P>
<P>
Domenichino, who painted in a more classical style than Reni, is primarily 
known for frescoes on buildings in Rome and Naples. He did relatively few easel 
paintings. "There are maybe a dozen in the world," Conisbee said. "St. 
Ignatius" is a fine example because of its "classical perfection of form" and 
pristine condition. "Every brush mark is from Domenichino's hand," the curator 
said, noting that the painting had been properly cared for and not repainted by 
restorers. 
</P>
<P>
Three other refurbished galleries opening today display the museum's 
collections of 18th-Century art (including the recently acquired "Portrait of 
the Devin Family" by Louis-Michel van Loo), 19th-Century paintings and 
sculpture and works by the French Romantics.

CRITIC AT LARGE: SCHAFFNER'S MARCH ACROSS TV, MOVIES

Someday a book could be done on all the paths by which directors have found 
their way to their craft. I think, for example, of young Steven Spielberg 
borrowing the family camera to photograph his model trains colliding head-on. 
His father had warned him that after the next collision there would be no more 
repairs. Spielberg figured he could relive the last crash over and over again 
via film -- and look where the notion led. 
</P>
<P>
I thought of beginnings again a few weeks ago when I conversed with Franklin 
Schaffner during a tribute to him, which was one of the events of AFI/L.A. 
FilmFest, as the American Film Institute's Los Angeles International Film 
Festival is more economically known. 
</P>
<P>
The evening commenced with the mind-blowing first sequence of "Patton," when an 
American flag fills the vast screen top to bottom, left to right, and George C. 
Scott as Gen. George Patton strides up from the rear, glimpsed first as the tip 
of a shiny helmet and then as a giant figure, pearl-handed pistols in place, 
knee-high boots adazzle. 
</P>
<P>
A more arresting start to a movie does not come to mind, and watching it the 
other night it seemed a very long way from Tokyo, where Schaffner was born, the 
child of Protestant missionary parents. He did not see the United States until 
he was nearly 5, after the sudden death of his father. 
</P>
<P>
He grew up in Amish country, in Lancaster, Pa., and went to Franklin &amp; 
Marshall College locally, aiming for law school, not the movies or anything 
close to it. That's what's so interesting about the paths to film making. 
</P>
<P>
In Schaffner's case, the war preceded law school and after Navy service on LSTs 
(landing ship tanks) and then in intelligence in Southeast Asia, he thought it 
was too late for the law. He worked for a time with a world peace organization, 
which led by chance to a job as a kind of location scout for "The March of 
Time," which, equally by chance, led to a job at CBS. 
</P>
<P>
The network was struggling with the lusty infant television, desperate for 
young men who could be directors. So far as Hollywood was concerned, television 
was The Enemy (likely to be a passing fad in all events), not to be worked for, 
and the networks were starting from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
Schaffner remembered that he received a three-week course in whatever it was a 
director did, and was almost immediately thereafter directing telecasts from 
Ebbets Field of the Brooklyn Dodgers at play, with kindly assistance from the 
great sportscaster Red Barber. Schaffner also did the evening news (15 minutes 
long), politics, features on the United Nations, religious shows, specials. 
</P>
<P>
And live drama. Six Studio Ones in 1948, including "Jane Eyre"; a dozen in 
1950, included "The Scarlet Letter," "Macbeth," "Wings of the Dove," "A 
Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court" and "Treasure Island." You name a 
classic, there was a fair chance Schaffner directed it, on a breakneck schedule 
of one every two or three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"There was good reason for doing the classics," he explained. "They were in the 
public domain. Therefore they were cheap." 
</P>
<P>
He directed for "Ford Theatre," "Person to Person," "The Kaiser Aluminum Hour," 
"Playhouse 90" ("The 80-Yard Run," "The Great Gatsby" among others). He was a 
principal director on "The Defenders," widely regarded as television's first 
great dramatic series. 
</P>
<P>
The sheer daring of the choices early television was making is breathtaking to 
read or hear about now, when drama, except in series or as miniseries or Movies 
of the Week, has all but vanished from the medium. But Schaffner has an 
explanation for that, too: "We didn't know that what we were doing was 
impossible," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood actors found it impossible or dangerous to do television so the 
medium was finding its own casts, and one of the rising young talents who 
worked for Schaffner was Charlton Heston. There were other young tigers around, 
including Jack Lemmon and Robert Redford. 
</P>
<P>
For the directors, as for the writers and performers, it was a trial by fire, a 
postgraduate education and a golden opportunity to grow by doing. And just as 
D. W. Griffith and his heirs were inventing the language of film as they went 
along, so Schaffner's generation of pioneers in live television, and then in 
tape, were inventing their medium as they turned out remarkable work on a 
crushing schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Schaffner did the television original of "Twelve Angry Men," with Robert 
Cummings in the role Henry Fonda played in the movie. He also did "The Caine 
Mutiny Court-Martial" for television. 
</P>
<P>
They were eyewitnesses to history, Schaffner and contemporaries like Sidney 
Lumet, John Frankenheimer, Delbert Mann and others, and they made history even 
before they found their way to Hollywood. Schaffner won a special Emmy for his 
direction of a tour of the White House with First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy in 
1962. 
</P>
<P>
After 15 years learning his craft in television, Schaffner himself came West in 
1963 to do "The Stripper," with Joanne Woodward, based on William Inge's play 
"A Loss of Roses." 
</P>
<P>
While his apprenticeship was amid the necessary confinements of television, 
Schaffner has made his film reputation as a director who can handle the epic 
scale ("Patton," "Planet of the Apes," "Nicholas and Alexandra," "Papillon"). 
But size without intimacy is merely big, and Schaffner's further gift is to 
give life-sized insights to larger-than-life figures like the most 
idiosyncratic of all American generals, and a last man among the ruling apes. 
</P>
<P>
The AFI's tribute to Schaffner had its own subtitle, "Films of Brave Men and 
Destiny." The urbane and quiet-spoken Schaffner would probably opt for 
something a little less grandiloquent. But beginnings, however distant they 
grow in time, space and circumstance, are bound to leave their mark. 
</P>
<P>
The idealism of missionary parents may well be the lingering influence that 
explains why a man's best works are ultimately about the embattled human 
spirit, films that suggest films can be taken seriously.

WILLY DEVILLE SHOWS WHAT A SURVIVOR HE IS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUNCAN STRAUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having toiled in the rock biz since the heyday of the lower-Manhattan music 
scene 13 years ago, and having weathered a messy divorce, messier managerial 
problems and a long battle with drugs, there's no question that Willy DeVille 
is a soul survivor. 
</P>
<P>
What hasn't survived is the soul. 
</P>
<P>
At the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano Sunday night, backed by a new Mink 
DeVille band (with no familiar faces), he was still singing about the aching 
sadness of failed love -- and thanks to his vocal gifts, you could still feel 
the ache. But these days he casts his tales as airy ballads or remarkably 
feisty rock romps. The R&amp;B -- especially the swaggering soul -- around 
which he built his career is pretty much gone. 
</P>
<P>
This is not bad, nor is it very surprising. Two years ago, when he dissolved 
Mink DeVille and recorded the solo album "Miracle" (produced and featuring 
guitar-playing by Dire Straits maestro Mark Knopfler), his intention was to get 
away from the stylized Mink DeVille sound. He felt that he had painted himself 
into a corner with the R&amp;B and soul orientation, the smoky sax and other 
musical elements. 
</P>
<P>
With his presentation at the Coach House, he was merely staying true to his new 
musical direction. And it worked enormously well. 
</P>
<P>
He still managed to hurl a few curve balls, though, both sonic and visual. 
</P>
<P>
Cruising on stage as the band lit into a fairly hoppin', boppin' take on 
"Lilly's Daddy's Cadillac" -- rail thin, occasionally flashing a gold tooth 
from his reptilian face -- he was decked out in some kind of matador jacket, 
leather pants, boots, hoop earrings and poofy black pompadour. We aren't 
exactly talking GQ material here. But we are talking one of the coolest guys in 
rock, and an eminently engaging performer. DeVille smoking a cigarette is more 
interesting than most rockers going through their on-stage gyrations. 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, clear-eyed and in fine voice, Willy delivered the goods. 
Whether performing tunes from "Miracle" such as "Heart and Soul" -- an 
atmospheric piece with a Latin lilt, over which he sang a naked pledge of 
undying love and devotion -- or re-arranged versions of early classics, Willy 
was on top of his game, investing every word with seemingly heartfelt emotion. 
He still comes across as a romantic who's not only incurable but absolutely not 
interested in being cured. 
</P>
<P>
He also injected many of the numbers with some stinging guitar licks. On an 
initially unrecognizable rendition of Moon Martin's "Cadillac Walk" (much 
bigger, denser and more booming than Mink DeVille's recorded version), he cut 
loose with some wailing slide guitar. 
</P>
<P>
It was that kind of night -- full of surprises, mostly pleasant ones. To those 
who openly pine for the Mink DeVille sound and style of yesteryear, Willy would 
probably lean forward, flash a gold-toothed grin and say, "Tough." We'd have to 
agree.

WILLIAMS AND WILSON EVOKE GALAXY OF STYLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Performing Arts Center's jazz singers series ended Sunday 
with performances by two singers in varied styles. 
</P>
<P>
The first, Joe Williams, is a storyteller who gets his point across with a 
rich, meaningful tone. The second, Nancy Wilson, stretches a lyric with range 
and emotion. Both brought excellent supporting units, and both paid tribute to 
varied musical influences. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' set used the blues as a touchstone, but the king-size vocalist also 
showed his swing chops and a sincere, soothing way with a ballad. He paid 
tribute to Bessie Smith, Jimmy Rushing, Duke Ellington and his old boss, Count 
Basie, with a tone as thick as espresso, and just as eye-opening. 
</P>
<P>
While his band loped through the easy walk of Miles Davis' "All Blues," 
Williams, dressed in white on white, went right into his theme, "Everyday I 
Have the Blues," throwing in a little "C.C. Rider" for good measure. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, it was apparent that he was not afraid to push his voice, 
regardless of the consequences. This is a guy who likes to sing. 
</P>
<P>
Up-tempo numbers such as "Alright" brought some gravel to his voice. "I Want a 
Little Girl" found him coming on with an alley cat's purr and some Basie-brand 
scat. And Bernard Ighner's "Same Ol' Story," a funky number with a slightly 
disguised political message, had the Mercedes-Benz set squirming in its seats. 
</P>
<P>
Williams kept the proceedings upbeat, but he was most impressive on ballads, 
where he displayed a rich tremolo. His melancholy encore, "Here's to Life," 
included a line that seems to sum up his approach: "Give it all you've got." 
</P>
<P>
He seemed to enjoy his backup band as much as the audience did, and he gave the 
group plenty of credit. Drummer Gerry King moved easily from brushes to sticks 
on "Everyday," getting a roll reminiscent of Art Blakey. Bassist Bob Badgley, 
who played a vertical bass, plucked out crisp tones as clear and deep as those 
of the vocalist he supported. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' longtime associate, Norman Simmons, contributed tasteful keyboard 
work, putting a Basie beat in "Alright, Okay, You Win" and soloing with 
Ellington-like cool on "I Got It Bad (and That Ain't Good)." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's brief opener, "I Want to Be Happy," was a jazzy, quick-paced exercise 
that left her little room for stylistic tricks. This straight-ahead number may 
have been her best of the night: It was strong, fast and confident. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of her program, a mix of standards and pop-oriented numbers from 
recent albums, was designed to show off her varied techniques rather than the 
smooth, sweet tones of her voice. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson likes to build excitement with throaty growls, octave jumps and repeated 
slides up and down the scale, often with her hands flailing away in front of 
her face. She has a great sense of dynamics, often moving from whisper to 
full-blown wail in a single line. 
</P>
<P>
Her trio moved easily from acoustic to electric numbers, with bassist Jeff 
Littleton showing authority on upright and a heavy thumb on bass guitar. 
Drummer Roy McCurdy matched the singer's mood, be it low or loud, and showed 
pleasing skills with the brushes. Llew Matthews worked both electronic and 
acoustic keyboards to advantage, using clever runs to spice the singer's 
cinnamon tones on a relaxed "Getting to Know You." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's most moving moment was her a cappella treatment of Roy Hamilton's "Ebb 
Tide," a number that demonstrated her strength and range perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
The only drawback was the number of newer pieces that ended with loud, grand 
upbeat choruses that eventually became indistinguishable from each other. It's 
to Wilson's credit that she did not allow the electric cacophony to bury her 
voice. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the evening, Williams introduced "Embraceable You" as a number that 
should be remembered "in case singing ever comes back." With voices like these 
around, singing will never go away.

'FRONTLINE' CONSIDERS THE FUTURE OF 'YELLOWSTONE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the title's suggestion, "Yellowstone Under Fire," the latest report 
from "Frontline" (at 9 tonight on Channels 28 and 15, 10 on Channel 50), is not 
about the wildfires that erupted in the national park last summer. 
</P>
<P>
It is about the longer-term crisis in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (as it 
is known) caused by the exploitation of the fragile wilderness for oil and 
geothermal energy, minerals and timber harvesting. 
</P>
<P>
Most profoundly, producers Jan Falstad and Greg Pratt depict a battle over 
fundamental values. On one side is the mind-set of former Interior Secretary 
James Watt and the appointees who have succeeded him in the Reagan and Bush 
administrations. Their practice of full-scale leasing of public lands to 
private development is based on a rock-ribbed belief in the primacy of private 
property and of American military strategic interests -- the Yellowstone area, 
for instance, has the only U.S. deposits of platinum and palladium, minerals 
essential for weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
The report does cite this, but the Cold War strategies behind what Watt himself 
calls the "assault" on Yellowstone are understressed. Rather, the values of 
preservation are emphasized and given eloquent voice by, among others, former 
National Park Service director George Hartzog, former U.S. Sen. Gaylord Nelson 
and Montana surveyor Jack Rate. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, in a report that's unusually fact-filled and sensitive to the 
champions of ecology, the enormous stresses put on the wilderness by tourism 
itself are ignored. Much of this stress has stemmed, as the report notes, from 
the National Forest Service policy of the "multiple-use" of forest for 
recreation and development. And with two-thirds of the Forest Service budget 
slated for the unprofitable leasing of land for timber clear-cutting, the fate 
of Yellowstone hangs precariously in the balance as the '90s begin. ROBERT

A Compton judge dismissed armed robbery charges today against actor Todd 
Bridges, who was accused of trying to steal his own car without paying a $500 
repair bill. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges is charged in another case, however, involving his alleged attempt to 
kill a man in a shooting in a cocaine rock house. Acting on a defense request 
after the prosecution said it was unable to proceed with the car case, 
Municipal Court Commissioner Bob Bowers today dismissed the armed robbery case 
against Bridges, 23, the former child star of NBC's "Diff'rent Strokes." It was 
not immediately known why prosecutors were unable to go forward with the case.

A minor car accident on Laurel Canyon Boulevard in Studio City triggered a 
power outage that left 4,000 Department of Water and Power customers without 
electricity this morning, some for as long as five hours, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The outage occurred at 11:20 p.m. Monday when a car hit a utility pole on 
Laurel Canyon Boulevard at Berry Drive, DWP spokeswoman Dorothy Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, whose name was unavailable, suffered only minor injuries, but the 
utility pole hit by the car snapped near the top, bringing down electrical 
wires, officials said. That set off a chain-reaction of stress on the local 
power system. Three circuits that feed electricity to the area were knocked 
out, Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
Primarily affected were homes and businesses in the Laurel Canyon area between 
Mulholland Boulevard and the Ventura Freeway.

British Broadcasting Corp. journalists and technicians began a 48-hour strike 
today, severely disrupting radio and television programs. 
</P>
<P>
Most live broadcasts were cancelled as senior journalists, talk show hosts and 
disc jockeys joined picket lines to demand a 16% wage increase. The 
state-funded corporation has refused to increase its offer of 7% despite the 
fact that annual inflation has reached 7.9% and is expected to go higher. 
</P>
<P>
The BBC's main television news bulletins continued, but in shortened form. 
Anchormen said they would not take pay while colleagues were on strike but 
worked because they thought it wrong to stop the news on a public service 
channel.

3.2 MILLION IN 'VISA LOTTERY' FOR 20,000 U.S. OPENINGS

More than 3 million people from around the globe have won a chance to take part 
in a computerized "visa lottery" that will give 20,000 immigrants the 
opportunity to live in the United States, the State Department announced today. 
</P>
<P>
"The so-called 'visa lottery' is now over -- 3.2 million people applied 
successfully," department spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Boucher said winners will be chosen by a computer that will make the selections 
on a random basis. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens from 162 countries were eligible to apply during March, and all 
applicants have an equal chance of winning an immigrant visa. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), author of the legislation that made 
the new program possible, "will open the first few application envelopes 
selected by the computer and announce the nationalities of the applicants" at a 
ceremony on Monday, Boucher said. 
</P>
<P>
Only the nationalities and not the names will be announced at the ceremony "as 
a courtesy" to the privacy of the applicants, said Frances Jones, an official 
with the department's consular affairs office. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, 10,000 visas will be granted each year for 1991 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Berman said the program will help bring diversity to the immigrant population. 
</P>
<P>
Under the normal rules for obtaining an immigrant visa, the applicant has to 
have a close relative in the United States or work in a profession for which 
there is a high demand. 
</P>
<P>
The countries excluded from the program were those that used more than 5,000 
immigrant slots in fiscal 1988. 
</P>
<P>
They were China, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guyana, Haiti, 
India, Jamaica, South Korea, Mexico, the Philippines and the United Kingdom.

Nearly two-thirds of this year's National Merit Scholarship semifinalists are 
boys, according to a report today that blamed sex bias in the standardized 
Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test on which the awards are based. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 62.9% of the semifinalists in 1989 are boys, according to the 
third annual analysis of the national awards conducted by FairTest, a 
Cambridge, Mass.-based research group that has frequently criticized 
standardized testing. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-one percent of this year's semifinalists are girls, according to the 
state-by-state analysis of first names. The genders of the remaining 6% could 
not be determined from their names. 
</P>
<P>
The group reached similar findings in two previous surveys. In 1987-88, it 
found that 60.1% of merit scholars were boys, and in 1986-87, 61% were boys.

House Speaker Jim Wright today attacked the Ethics Committee's outside counsel, 
accusing him of distorting testimony in an effort to implicate the Speaker on 
House rules violations. 
</P>
<P>
Wright also charged that the ethics panel had permitted itself to be misled by 
counsel Richard Phelan's selective use of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Wright said his lawyers had been "profoundly shocked by the lack of 
professionalism and prevalence of distortion and inaccuracy contained in the 
Phelan report" and called the committee's investigation "one-sided." 
</P>
<P>
But committee chairman Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles) defended the panel's 
process and said its 12 members, six Democrats and six Republicans, had studied 
original transcripts and had not relied solely on Phelan's report. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he was disturbed by Wright's strategy of attacking Phelan, Dixon 
said he was not but added: "I'm glad you recognize that that is the strategy." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Wright's new legal defense team today prepared motions asking 
that the two primary charges against him be dismissed on grounds that the 
Ethics Committee's special counsel has misread House rules.

General Motors Corp. said today that it plans to shut down some of its assembly 
plants for a month or longer this summer to help reduce inventories and provide 
time for plant retooling. 
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation that GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. would 
have longer-than-normal changeover times because of slow sales and ambitious 
production during the first three months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
GM spokeswoman Marcia McGee said today that the company's plant in Flint, 
Mich., will be closed between June 13 and Aug. 7 and that plants in Wentzville, 
Mo., and Orion Township in Oakland County will shut down for about a month each 
during June and July. 
</P>
<P>
She called the shutdown time normal.

The stock market declined for the eighth straight day today in relatively low 
volume, pressured by jitters in the bond market and by ongoing inflation 
worries. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials declined 5.14 points to end the day at 
2,371.33. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 4 to 3 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 804 issues down, 612 up and 539 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 150.09 million shares, against 135.13 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell 0.46 to 170.80. 
</P>
<P>
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index dropped 0.76 to 345.09. 
</P>
<P>
The market opened on an up-note, then drifted lower as economic uncertainty set 
in. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the day, many buyers withdrew from the market to await the start of 
the Treasury's three-day auction of notes and bonds. Investors also were 
reluctant to make commitments ahead of Friday's wholesale price data, market 
observers said. 
</P>
<P>
The bond market took a nose dive late in the day after the first round of the 
government auction. Stocks followed, with program selling dominating the 
action. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the bond market had anticipated a more enthusiastic response 
from foreign investors to the Treasury's $9.75-billion sale of three-year 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently the auction didn't go so well," said Michael Metz, vice president 
of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Before the sale, observers had predicted that stock prices would follow the 
bond market's reaction. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the stock market also remained cautious in anticipation of 
Friday's government report on producer prices, which will provide additional 
information about the economy's growth. 
</P>
<P>
The producer price index has particular significance for the market after last 
week's unemployment report, which provided mixed signals, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
"So the concern is shifting to stagflation," said Alfred E. Goldman, vice 
president of the investment firm A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. Stagflation 
refers to a condition of stagnant economic growth coupled with inflation.

VIACOM SUES TIME FOR $2.4 BILLION OVER ITS PAY-TV PRACTICES

<P>
Viacom Inc. today charged Time Inc. and its Home Box Office and other cable 
television subsidiaries with monopolizing the pay-TV airwaves and filed a 
lawsuit seeking as much as $2.4 billion in damages. 
</P>
<P>
The antitrust lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan by Viacom 
International Inc. and Showtime Networks Inc., two units of the New York-based 
entertainment and communications company. 
</P>
<P>
Viacom said in a statement that the suit against Time, one of the world's 
largest entertainment and publishing conglomerates, had been more than a year 
in preparation. 
</P>
<P>
In the suit, Viacom alleges that Time and its Home Box Office Inc., American 
Television and Communications Corp. and Manhattan Cable Television Inc. units 
are violating federal antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Predatory . . . Acts' 
</P>
<P>
Viacom charged that Time and its TV holdings are monopolizing, conspiring to 
monopolize and attempting to restrain trade, practices prohibited by the 
Sherman and Clayton acts. 
</P>
<P>
Time, HBO, ATC and MCTV are breaking the laws by "engaging in an integrated 
series of predatory and exclusionary acts and strategies designed to increase 
the costs of their rivals, raise barriers to entry and expansion and otherwise 
entrench themselves as monopolists by anti-competitive conduct, injuring the 
competitive process and, ultimately, consumers," the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
Viacom alleged that Time and its cable subsidiaries have tied up the limited 
number of cable outlets available in many markets and also tied up the most 
desirable films for pay-television programming services. 
</P>
<P>
Time's American Television &amp; Communications Corp. subsidiary owns or 
manages cable systems reaching at least 7.2 million viewers in the United 
States. In each of its local markets, including much of Manhattan and such 
cities as Memphis and Denver, ATT possesses a nearly 100% market share, the 
suit said. 
</P>
<P>
Even in markets where Showtime and The Movie Channel are offered through a 
Time-controlled cable system, Viacom alleges that its channels are treated in a 
discriminatory manner with regard to channel position and in promotion and 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
The suit contends that the violations entitle Viacom to recover three times the 
actual amount of monetary damage done to Viacom, which was placed at no less 
than $800 million. After trebling, the amount sought in damages is $2.4 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Viacom also asked the court to permanently bar Time and its pay-TV units from 
further anti-competitive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Time Inc. called Viacom's complaint "totally baseless" and "a rehashing of 
issues that have been periodically raised for more than a decade." 
</P>
<P>
"On several occasions, the Justice Department has reviewed many if not all of 
these allegations and repeatedly concluded that no action was warranted," it 
said.

Proceeds from the ESOP will be used to buy back about 12 million common or

Seeking to capitalize on actor Don Johnson's dispute with Vermont over $50,000 
in income taxes, Gov. Judd Gregg has written to the "Miami Vice" star, asking 
him to make tax-free movies in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson is fighting Vermont's demand that he pay the tax, which is on income 
earned from the movie "Sweetheart's Dance," made in the Green Mountain State in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent Monday to Johnson, Gregg invited the actor to consider New 
Hampshire as a location for future film projects. 
</P>
<P>
"We regret the impasse you have reached with our sister state," Gregg wrote. 
"Still, a good Yankee never passes up an opportunity, so I want to point out to 
you that New Hampshire has no state income tax and no sales tax." 
</P>
<P>
He said Johnson would be able to keep any money he made on movies made in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
"In New Hampshire we don't penalize success, we encourage it," Gregg wrote. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the agency that represents Johnson said he was not aware of any 
productions by the actor scheduled for New England. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg also offered to provide Johnson with more information on New Hampshire if 
he needed it, inviting him to call collect. 
</P>
<P>
A collect call may be the only help the state could provide if Johnson decided 
to make a movie in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
The state has a film bureau in its Office of Vacation Travel, but its budget is 
$1 a year. The appropriation maintains the office's legal existence but nothing 
more. 
</P>
<P>
The last major movie made in New Hampshire was "On Golden Pond," starring 
Katharine Hepburn, Jane Fonda and the late Henry Fonda. It was filmed in 1980 
on Squam Lake.

The Canadian Track and Field Assn. ignored for years repeated warnings from its 
coaches about drug use among athletes, a top coach said today. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Higgins, head of the University of Toronto track center, told a federal 
drug inquiry that he and frustrated coaches called a meeting in 1987 with top 
officials of the nationally funded group and told them that athletes under 
Coach Charlie Francis were using drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing happened and nothing had been happening for years," he testified. "The 
results we saw in Seoul," he said, referring to Ben Johnson's failed drug test 
and the stripping of his Olympic gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
Higgins agreed with Francis' earlier testimony that drug use is rampant, 
saying, "In some disciplines, it's difficult to win without the use of drugs."

Baseball moved another step closer today to deciding the fate of Cincinnati 
Reds manager Pete Rose. 
</P>
<P>
John M. Dowd, the lawyer leading Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti's 
investigation of Rose, has submitted his report to the commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
A statement from the commissioner today said: "John Dowd . . . has submitted 
his report to me regarding allegations concerning Mr. Pete Rose. Should any 
additional information relevant to the investigation be obtained, he will 
forward it to me. I will now study the report thoroughly." 
</P>
<P>
The investigation reportedly has concentrated on Rose's gambling activities, 
especially on determining if the manager bet on baseball games. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a substantial report that the commissioner can read and study," Dowd said 
Monday in a telephone interview from his Washington office.

YUGOSLAV TEEN UPSETS 4TH-SEED KENT CARLSSON IN GERMAN OPEN

Teen-ager Goran Ivanisevic of Yugoslavia upset defending champion Kent Carlsson 
of Sweden 7-5, 4-6, 6-1 in the second round of the German Open men's tennis 
tournament today. 
</P>
<P>
Carlsson, seeded fourth, was the highest-ranked casualty on the red clay of 
Hamburg's Rothenbaum club in today's action. 
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic, 16, was a quarterfinalist at the Australian Open and a semifinalist 
at the Nice tournament last month. 
</P>
<P>
Another seed was ousted when Jan Gunnarsson of Sweden defeated Andrei Chesnokov 
of the Soviet Union 6-4, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Chesnokov was seeded 13th after winning the Nice event and last week's Bavarian 
Open in Munich. 
</P>
<P>
Chesnokov said he was tired after a 10-hour train ride from Munich to Hamburg. 
He then opened another round in the growing dispute between some Soviet tennis 
players and their federation. 
</P>
<P>
Under Soviet Tennis Federation regulations, Soviet professionals are requested 
to turn over most of their hard-currency earnings to the federation. 
</P>
<P>
The first to rebel was Natalia Zvereva, the seventh-ranked woman player in the 
world, and she was later joined by Chesnokov. The two want to keep a larger 
portion of their prize money. 
</P>
<P>
Chesnokov told reporters that a first round of talks between Zvereva and Soviet 
tennis officials failed to produce an agreement, but he said he hopes for a 
compromise.
