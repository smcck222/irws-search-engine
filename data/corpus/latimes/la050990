POLICE UNION COMPLAINS AT OFFICERS' TRIAL; 
</P>
<P>
COURT: COLLEAGUES REPORTEDLY FEAR DISCIPLINARY ACTION FOR TESTIFYING ON THE 
DEPARTMENT'S TRANSIENT ROUNDUP POLICY.

The kidnaping and robbery trial of two San Diego police officers took a 
surprise turn Tuesday when the police union complained to the judge that 
several officers feel they are being threatened with discipline for testifying 
for the defendants about a controversial practice of rounding up transients in 
the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint from the Police Officers Assn. came in the form of a short note 
handed by the defense attorneys to Superior Court Judge Judith Haller as the 
trial was resuming after lunch. 
</P>
<P>
According to the message, several officers have complained to the POA that they 
feel "threatened and intimidated" because the lieutenant in the police Internal 
Affairs unit has sat through the weeklong trial, taking extensive notes on 
their testimony. 
</P>
<P>
The judge immediately asked that the lieutenant, Glenn Breitenstein, be ordered 
to take the stand to explain his presence in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
But Breitenstein abruptly disappeared from the courthouse just as the POA was 
registering its complaint, and could not be found the rest of the afternoon. A 
subpoena was issued for him and he is expected to testify today. 
</P>
<P>
Steve McMillan, POA vice president and chairman of the group's legal defense 
fund, said outside the courtroom that he was "outraged" with Breitenstein's 
conduct -- first for "spying" on the officers and then for leaving "when he got 
caught." 
</P>
<P>
"It's just the way he acts," McMillan said, his face growing red with anger as 
he described how the lieutenant even ordered him to leave the courthouse when 
he showed up with the complaint note. "He doesn't treat people with dignity and 
respect." 
</P>
<P>
Everett Bobbitt, one of the defense attorneys, said: "It's embarrassing that 
this is going on. It upsets me a lot. Officers may not be as candid as they'd 
like to be with the lieutenant in charge of Internal Affairs sitting there 
taking notes." 
</P>
<P>
Bobbitt and McMillan said Breitenstein's only purpose at the trial was to 
discipline any officers who testify on behalf of the defendants, Officers Lloyd 
J. Hoff Jr. and Richard P. Schaaf. They said the Police Department also 
apparently wants to discipline any officers who might embarrass the department 
by testifying about the roundup policy. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not put it past the department," McMillan said. "We're having officers 
come in here and say what's the common practice downtown. They're telling the 
truth about a policy that is not sanctioned by the department. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's the only way we have to clean up the downtown. Just because we do 
it doesn't make it right. But what else would the city have us do?" 
</P>
<P>
Hoff and Schaaf, who are on voluntary leave as officers, are on trial on felony 
charges of kidnaping and robbing a group of illegal aliens last August. If 
convicted, they face life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
However they insist that no kidnaping or robbery occurred. Instead, they say, 
they simply followed department policies when they transported the three 
illegal aliens out of downtown and dropped them off at secluded spots near the 
San Diego Bay and along a row of railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Rooten, the deputy district attorney who is prosecuting Hoff and Schaaf, 
declined to comment about Breitenstein's presence in court. But asked if the 
brouhaha appeared to be merely courtroom theatrics on the part of the defense 
team, Rooten said: "Your perceptions are accurate." 
</P>
<P>
One former police officer testified Monday that supervisors told patrolmen at 
lineups to transport street people out of downtown because of complaints from 
area merchants. 
</P>
<P>
But several other officers -- who are still on the force -- were vague in their 
testimony about the policy and appeared rather uncomfortable when asked to 
discuss the roundup practice, all in front of Breitenstein. 
</P>
<P>
At police headquarters Tuesday, officials were reluctant to discuss the roundup 
policy, but planned to issue a public statement on the matter today. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything that has to do with the trial, we're reserving comment," Lt. Greg 
Clark said. "We don't want to say anything to jeopardize the trial in 
progress." 
</P>
<P>
However, Clark scoffed at any suggestion that the department was using 
Breitenstein to spy on officers who took the stand as defense witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why he's been there," Clark said. "But how can you be a spy in 
open court? Come on. You answer me that." 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to contact Breitenstein on Tuesday afternoon were unsuccessful.

HOPE'S SON NAMED TO NEW INDIAN COMMISSION; 
</P>
<P>
GAMING: PRESIDENT BUSH'S NOMINEE IS EXPECTED TO WIN CONFIRMATION TO THE PANEL.

<P>
President Bush has nominated Tony Hope, a former Ventura County congressional 
candidate and the son of entertainer Bob Hope, to the sensitive post of 
chairman of the new National Indian Gaming Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The commission will regulate and monitor the multimillion-dollar industry of 
bingo and other gambling on Indian reservations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great challenge to try to put something like this in place," said Tony 
Hope, who faces a confirmation hearing for the $83,600-a-year post before the 
Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs on Thursday. He said he already has 
scheduled meetings with Indian leaders in anticipation of his confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
Most Indian tribes opposed the controversial 1988 law establishing the 
commission, claiming it was a violation of tribal sovereignty. But supporters 
of the legislation contended that without outside monitoring and control, the 
high-stakes gaming was a potential haven for money laundering and other 
organized crime activities. 
</P>
<P>
Indian tribes, facing cutbacks in federal money and limited tax bases, have 
instituted gambling, predominantly bingo, to raise revenues. About 120 of the 
257 recognized tribes in the United States have some form of organized gaming. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation that created the commission provides for joint tribal and 
federal government regulation of bingo, lotto and certain card games. The 
commission will have the authority to conduct background investigations of 
employees, monitor all Indian gaming activity, enforce the collection of fines 
and close illegal games. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation also permits casinos and wagering on horse and dog racing on 
reservations, but only if a tribe enters into a contract with the state 
government. It requires Indian-run poker, slot machines and other games to 
conform to state laws on hours of play and betting limits. 
</P>
<P>
The commission will consist of five members, including three from federally 
recognized tribes. Congress authorized spending $2 million a year for its 
operation and empowered it to collect another $1.5 million in fees from tribal 
gambling. 
</P>
<P>
Hope, 49, said the White House approached him about the appointment in 
September. An aide to the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs said 
Tuesday that Hope's appointment to the three-year term faces no apparent 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Harvard Law School, Hope worked for Bush in the New Hampshire 
Republican primary in 1980 and 1988. He was also a member of the Grace 
Commission appointed by former President Ronald Reagan to pinpoint waste and 
fraud in the federal government. In addition, Hope served as vice president of 
the Overseas Investment Corp. under former President Gerald Ford. He is a 
senior vice president of Mutual of Omaha and United of Omaha insurance 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Hope ran unsuccessfully for the 21st District congressional seat vacated by 
Bobbi Fiedler (R-Northridge) in 1986. Despite heavy fund-raising support from 
many prominent entertainers and ex-Presidents Ford and Richard M. Nixon, he was 
upset by Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), who was then the mayor of Simi 
Valley. The district includes eastern Ventura County and parts of the western 
and northern San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Hope and his family reside primarily in Washington, although he travels to 
California frequently on business and remains registered to vote in North 
Hollywood, near where his father lives. Hope reiterated that, even if 
confirmed, he still hopes to run for Congress again in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll cause my plans to slip by one term, but, at this point, it doesn't make 
that much difference," Hope said. "I'd run in 1994 instead of 1992."

EDUCATOR'S LAWSUIT ACCUSES DISTRICT OF SEX DISCRIMINATION; 
</P>
<P>
PROMOTIONS: OFFICIALS IN SIMI VALLEY SCHOOLS ADMIT THAT THEY HAVE NEVER HIRED A 
WOMAN PRINCIPAL BUT DENY CLAIMS OF BIAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A veteran Simi Valley educator has filed a sex-discrimination suit against the 
Simi Valley Unified School District alleging that she was repeatedly denied 
promotion because she is a woman. 
</P>
<P>
Marjorie Blackburn, 60, an assistant principal at Royal High School, claims 
that the district has rejected her applications for several principal jobs and 
has never hired a woman high school principal in its 100-year history. 
</P>
<P>
School officials admit both claims but said Tuesday that Blackburn was passed 
over in favor of more qualified candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Blackburn filed the suit in Ventura County Superior Court. Last week the school 
district asked the court to strike most of Blackburn's claims because they have 
expired under the one-year statute of limitations for sexual discrimination. A 
hearing on the request is set for June 4. 
</P>
<P>
Blackburn originally filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission in November, 1988, then sued the district in January in U.S. 
District Court in Los Angeles, said her attorney, Christine Masters. But the 
suit was moved to state court March 27, Masters said. 
</P>
<P>
School officials confirmed yesterday that Blackburn has applied for promotion 
seven times and has been passed over seven times in favor of other candidates, 
all men. However, Henry J. Walsh, the district's attorney, denied Blackburn's 
charges of discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"Our basic position is that she was not discriminated against because of her 
gender, and that the people who were selected for the open positions were the 
best-qualified persons that were applying," Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
District Supt. John Duncan said Tuesday that school officials are "a little 
shocked" by Blackburn's suit and her absence from work since last October. 
Masters said Blackburn has been on sick leave for a heart ailment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's harmful and it's very hurtful and it strikes at your dignity as a 
professional," Blackburn said of the alleged discrimination. "The resulting 
anger can affect your health and your performance on the job." 
</P>
<P>
Duncan admitted that the district has never hired a woman as a senior high 
school principal in its 100-year history. 
</P>
<P>
"That's probably true of a huge majority of districts at the high school 
level," Duncan said. "There have not been any females who aspired to that." 
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that there have been few openings -- Simi Valley High 
School has had only two principals in the past 16 years, Royal High School has 
had three and Apollo Continuation High School has had but one. 
</P>
<P>
Blackburn said that despite 21 years' experience in the district and a Ph.D. in 
education administration from USC, she has been passed over repeatedly because 
of her gender. 
</P>
<P>
Blackburn's applications were rebuffed for these jobs: district curriculum 
director in 1982; Valley View Junior High School principal in 1982; Sinaloa 
Junior High School principal in 1983. Each time, she was turned down by letter 
or word of mouth with no explanation of why a man had been hired instead. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984 Blackburn applied for the principal's job at Royal High School and 
became one of the three top candidates, along with John Fitzpatrick and David 
Ellis, Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
The district hired Fitzpatrick. 
</P>
<P>
Later that year, Blackburn's suit alleges, she was not even considered for the 
job of Simi Valley High School principal because the district hired Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1987, Fitzpatrick announced that he was leaving to work in another 
district, and Blackburn wanted to apply to replace him as Royal High School 
principal, her suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that district Personnel Director Robert Marcus told Blackburn 
that she could either work as acting principal or apply for the job -- but that 
she could not do both. 
</P>
<P>
Marcus explained Tuesday that acting principals have an unfair "political" 
advantage over candidates who can show their skills only through interviews, 
resumes and references. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she was a little frustrated in having been passed over, but she was 
never passed over because she was a woman," Marcus said. 
</P>
<P>
Blackburn took the job of acting principal and later was permanently replaced 
by David Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988 she applied and was again rejected for the job of Sinaloa Junior High 
School principal. 
</P>
<P>
Blackburn said she filed the suit in hopes of helping other women in the 
district "down the line."

GILL-NET BAN ON BALLOT LIKELY TO MAKE WAVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Flanked by photos of mangled sea lions, a state assemblywoman said she and her 
grass-roots forces have gathered enough signatures to qualify a November ballot 
measure that would ban the use of controversial gill nets along the shores of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative would establish a "marine protection zone" by banning the use of 
the nearly invisible monofilament nets by 1994 anywhere within three miles of 
the coast from the Mexican border north to Point Conception, as well as within 
a mile of the Channel Islands off Ventura County. It would also make permanent 
similar prohibitions already enacted along most of the coast in central and 
Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress) said a volunteer army of mostly 
recreational fishing groups and environmentalists helped her gather more than 1 
million signatures. The Orange County legislator convened news conferences in 
Sacramento, Los Angeles and San Diego on Monday to announce that she and her 
troops were handing in the signatures, at least 595,500 of which must be found 
valid for a spot on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
If it qualifies, the initiative is sure to touch off a hotly contested and 
emotional campaign pitting Allen and her recreational fishing allies against 
the politically powerful commercial fishing industry, which owns more than 480 
gill-net permits for Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the commercial fishing industry is marshaling its forces to raise 
money and run a campaign to counter charges by Allen that the gill nets are 
"indiscriminate killers" that "strip-mine" the ocean and kill hundreds of 
marine mammals such as sea lions, otters, gray whales and harbor porpoises. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Allen made no bones about the fact that her successful initiative 
drive depended heavily on emotional pictures and descriptions of how the gill 
nets can mangle and kill marine mammals. One anti-gill net brochure shows a 
woeful-looking sea lion sporting deep, red scars caused by a net. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, they are an emotional issue," Allen said about the pictures used as props 
at her news conference. "Yes, they are the most visible. Yes, they are what 
people will react to, and that's why we put it out." 
</P>
<P>
As further proof, Allen cited the recent example of 52 dead sea lions, harbor 
seals and elephant seals that washed up on Coronado beaches in San Diego County 
late last month. Experts believed that the animals were killed in gill nets, as 
were the 50 sea lions that floated to Orange County beaches more than a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
But commercial fishermen say those assertions are an exaggerated, emotional 
smoke screen for the fact that Allen's initiative would be a boon to 
recreational fishermen, who would love nothing better than to drive the 
competing commercial boats from coastal waters so that they can keep halibut 
and other delicacies for themselves. The losers, they say, would be California 
consumers, who would have to pay higher prices for seafood in restaurants and 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a fish grab," said Craig Ghio, chairman of the California Fisheries 
and Seafood Institutes, as well as president of San Diego-based Ghio Seafoods. 
Ghio estimated that it would take at least $1 million to defeat the Allen 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
The nets in question are monofilament nylon mesh that, used in coastal waters, 
are strung together in panels and weighted on the bottom so they unfurl up to 
6,000 feet. The nets trap and suffocate fish. 
</P>
<P>
But they also have killed several other kinds of marine life, including the 
endangered or threatened species of gray whales, marine birds, harbor porpoises 
and sea otters. Reported deaths of those animals have led to piecemeal closures 
of central and Northern California waters to gill-net fishermen over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Southern California remains open to gill nets, and area fishermen 
inadvertently kill up to 3,400 sea lions and 600 harbor seals annually, 
according to the Department of Fish and Game. Because those animals are not 
listed as endangered, state fishing officials have declined to institute 
similar gill-net bans south of Point Conception. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that distinction, Allen has been a longtime advocate of closing 
Southern California waters to gill nets. She has not only denounced the killing 
of mammals but also contends that the nets are wasteful because commercial 
fishermen throw back, dead or alive, more than 70% of what they catch -- a 
figure disputed by state fishing officials, who say only 20% of the catch is 
thrown back into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Allen's earlier attempts to get a gill-net ban enacted by the Legislature have 
been unsuccessful. Frustrated by what she calls the political power of the 
commercial fishing lobby, she plugged into the network of recreational fishing 
groups and launched a grass-roots campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Although Allen said Monday that the campaign has received donations of as 
little as $2 at a time, she did acknowledge that it received a crucial boost of 
$100,000 from an anonymous donor who is a recreational fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
If passed, the measure would also raise $3.4 million in special sport-fishing 
fees to reimburse the 400 commercial fishermen who have paid for permits to use 
the gill nets. The money is intended to help gill-netters, most of whom work 
Southern California waters, find a new line of work or invest in a less 
efficient kind of fishing gear, Allen said.

CARMEL VALLEY ROUTE CHOSEN FOR FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite threats of legal challenges and protests by coastal residents, the San 
Diego City Council voted 6-to-3 Tuesday to route through Carmel Valley a 
freeway linking Interstates 15 and 5. 
</P>
<P>
The vote on location of the western end of Route 56 Tuesday came after 
Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer, whose district includes the east-west freeway, 
came out in favor of the route adopted nearly two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfsheimer added several conditions to her recommendation for the Carmel 
Valley route over a proposed southern alignment which would avoid the planned 
community of North City West, from which most of the opposition to the Carmel 
Valley route comes. She required that additional wetlands be added to the 
present environmental preservation project and set a two-year deadline on the 
development of access to the new freeway from southbound I-5 and from Route 56 
to northbound I-5. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-mile western end of the North County freeway will link with I-5 at the 
present Carmel Valley Road. The remaining alignment of the 9-mile route is 
still to be set, although a portion of the route linking with I-15 in Rancho 
Penasquitos has been built. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfsheimer called the decision to back the Carmel Valley freeway alignment "a 
most difficult one for me" but said that an alternate route, proposed two weeks 
ago by Del Mar resident Bill Watson, "simply wouldn't work" because of its high 
cost and massive amount of grading. 
</P>
<P>
She drove the southerly alternate route last week with state Department of 
Transportation officials last week in order to determine if there was a way to 
avoid the valley route which impacts residential neighborhoods in North City 
West and wetlands along Carmel Creek and in the 
</P>
<P>
Penasquitos Lagoon to the west. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Mailhot, a North City West resident and spokesman for the Carmel Valley 
Coalition which opposes the Carmel Valley routing, said the southerly route 
favored by the group would be less expensive and would be built more quickly 
because the valley alignment "will be held up indefinitely by litigation." 
</P>
<P>
Mailhot also suggested that the rush to approve the Route 56 alignment might be 
due to a wish to avoid pending state legislation which will require additional 
environmental mitigation for the valley wetlands taken by the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Wes Pratt commented that his office has been inundated with phone 
calls against the (Carmel Valley) alignment, but that he still favored the 
valley route because it caused the least adverse impacts of any routes studied 
by Caltrans engineers. 
</P>
<P>
Voting against the alignment were Mayor Maureen O'Connor, Councilwoman Linda 
Bernhardt and Councilman John Hartley. Bernhardt said that she felt that all 
the environmental issues had not been addressed before the alignment was chosen 
and that there was no guarantee that the mid-section of Route 56 would be 
built. 
</P>
<P>
A 4-mile stretch of the proposed freeway lies in the city's "urban reserve" 
area where urban development cannot occur without citywide voter approval. 
There are no state or local transportation funds allocated to the mid-section. 
</P>
<P>
The state Coastal Commission must also approve the Carmel Valley route before 
design and construction of the western portion of the new freeway can begin. 
The commission is expected to schedule hearings on Route 56 in late July and 
early August. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bruce Henderson, admitting that "the automobile has become a 
scourge," cast his vote for the freeway because of the growing traffic 
congestion on North County freeways and the need for an east-west highway in 
the North City area.

HIGH SCHOOL DRUG STING NETS 11 ARRESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Cajon police arrested 11 people Tuesday in an investigation of drugs sales 
to high school students. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests come three months after an undercover officer enrolled as a senior 
at El Cajon Valley High School, said Lt. Bob Lein, of the El Cajon Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Tina Lawrence bought small quantities of marijuana, methamphetamine and 
LSD from several students and adults. 
</P>
<P>
Six juveniles and five adults were arrested Tuesday and authorities expect to 
arrest another juvenile who moved to Los Angeles shortly after the undercover 
operation began. Police also expect to arrest two other adults in the El Cajon 
area. 
</P>
<P>
The five arrested adults, from El Cajon, were being held in County Jail, Lein 
said. They are: Nathan H. Badgett, 18, a student at El Cajon Valley High 
School; Darrell Alan Bair, 20, and Paul Jason Bair, 19; Raymond Christopher 
Cuero, 20; and Frank Lawrence Pena, 21. Paul Jason Bair was arrested at the 
Target store where he works and the other adults were arrested in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Badgett, four other students were arrested at El Cajon Valley 
High School and another at Chaparral High School, Lein said. 
</P>
<P>
The adults and the juveniles were booked on suspicion of possessing and 
offering for sale small amounts of the drugs, Lein said. Bail for the adults 
ranged from $3,000 to $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence, the undercover officer, made 14 buys and spent about $1,000 during 
the investigation, Lein said. "The target of the investigation is drugs for 
personal use. Enough drugs for a weekend," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers also served five search warrants to residences in El Cajon. Lein said 
the "supply chain (of drugs) was traced to an apartment in the Allied Gardens 
area of San Diego." Investigators were serving a search warrant at that

GOMPERS STUDENTS AND PARENTS ASK APOLOGY; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: DESPITE DEMAND, BOARD PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES STAND FIRM IN CALLING 
AWARD TO THE TROUBLED SCHOOL A FARCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Several students and parents from Gompers Secondary School demanded an apology 
Tuesday from San Diego city schools board President Kay Davis for calling the 
school's California Distinguished School award "a farce" in a Times article 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the strong rhetoric, Davis refused to back away from her remark, 
saying to a chorus of "boos" that she and the speakers had "a difference of 
opinion." 
</P>
<P>
School trustees -- Davis in particular -- held their ground as they also took 
heat from public speakers about their push for more accountability, detailed in 
another article on their special board retreat in Rancho Santa Fe last week. At 
the retreat, board members talked about rewards and punishment for teachers and 
principals, depending on how well they succeed over two or three years in 
improving student achievement. 
</P>
<P>
The Gompers story detailed how the troubled Southeast San Diego school achieved 
the state honor despite more than three years of parent, teacher and community 
conflicts over how to expand the school's science-math-computer magnet 
curriculum -- long limited to just a few white and nonwhite students -- to all 
of its heavily minority neighborhood students. 
</P>
<P>
State schools Supt. Bill Honig acknowledged in the story that the award was 
based only on high test scores and other data from the school's 12th-grade 
class -- about 100 students -- despite the school's unusual configuration as a 
7th-through-12th grade school. By far the largest number of its 1,400 students 
are at the junior high level, almost all of them nonwhite and with lower test 
scores. 
</P>
<P>
But sophomore class President Josh Lamont scolded Davis for her remarks, 
asking: "Why are you not supporting us? . . . We have brought great honor to 
this district." 
</P>
<P>
Junior Jesse Wesley, after listing the courses and sports new to Gompers, said 
he was surprised at "how cruel and harsh people can be. . . . A certain member 
of the board is the true farce." 
</P>
<P>
Several speakers acknowledged that all is not well at Gompers, but they blamed 
Davis and other doubters about the school's new all-inclusive curriculum as 
reasons why overall achievement remains below district levels in many cases. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Brown, head of the Committee for the Education for African-American 
Children, said she "is tired of (Davis') insults and perpetuation of the myth 
that our African-American children are inferior in intelligence." 
</P>
<P>
"All we need is dedicated teachers," Brown said, reflecting the continuing 
charge by supporters of Gompers reforms that veteran teachers do not want to 
motivate nonwhite students. 
</P>
<P>
Board Vice President Shirley Weber told the students that their school is 
"distinguished" regardless of the criticism, and that she believes the media 
and other board members should stop "placing Gompers under a microscope. . . . 
Let's have a moratorium and stop talking about Gompers!" 
</P>
<P>
Davis held her ground, however, telling speakers that while Gompers has made 
some progress, "it still faces a lot of challenges and has a long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
In the same vein, Davis and her colleagues defended their moves last week to 
hold their employees more responsible for the lack of academic improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't continue just to say, 'Give us two more years, or five more years,' " 
Trustee Jim Roache said. "There comes a time when talk is cheap, and we have to 
see some results." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, trustees approved one of 12 low-performing schools -- Jackson 
Elementary -- for a comprehensive new curriculum. Teachers have promised to 
develop new teaching styles, support a comprehensive social-service program to 
improve the health of both parents and students, and attempt an experimental 
Montessori curriculum at some grades. The Montessori theory in essence calls 
for students to be able to experiment with a variety of learning activities 
within a loosely structured classroom environment.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANTONOVICH SUPPORTS REDUCED SLUDGE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who had tried to halt a 
controversial plan to truck tons of Los Angeles sewage sludge to farms in the 
Antelope Valley, has decided to allow a scaled-down version to be considered 
Thursday by a state water board. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich had argued in March that the city's original plan to export up to 
300 tons a day of its sludge to be used as fertilizer required prior county 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
But Antonovich's office and county officials decided Tuesday that the latest 
plan for about 80 tons a day does not require such approval. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the California Regional Water Quality Control Board said they 
will consider the proposal when they meet Thursday in Lancaster. Los Angeles, 
through a private company, had originally proposed spreading sludge over five 
Antelope Valley farm sites totaling 3,500 acres.

The Moorpark Unified School District on Tuesday ratified a two-year teachers' 
contract after nearly a year of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the contract, the district's 200 teachers will receive a 5% pay 
raise for the current school year, retroactive to September, plus a bonus of 
2.3% of their salaries. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, teachers will receive a cost-of-living salary increase and a bonus

In addition, $225,000 will be available to the seven schools in the district to 
"address the teacher-pupil ratio situation," Supt. Tom Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
The teacher-student ratio is 30 to 1, said Yvonne Davis, the district's 
personnel director. The funds will be used to hire more teachers to meet the

HIGH SCHOOL TO REPLACE GYM CARPET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Oak Park High School has long had the dubious honor of being the only high 
school in the state with a carpeted gym floor. 
</P>
<P>
But this month, athletes at the school are finally getting the 10-year-old rug 
pulled out from under them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time we had a real floor," said Fred Yamano, the school's athletic 
director. "It's something we have been looking forward to for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Installation of the new hardwood floor will be completed by June 1, in time for 
graduation ceremonies, Yamano said. The new floor will replace the worn-out rug 
that has been there since the school opened in 1981, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The coaches hate it," Yamano said. "It's difficult to teach skills needed in 
basketball and volleyball because you can't slide along the floor. It's really 
not designed for competitive sports." 
</P>
<P>
The rug was originally installed because it required less maintenance than 
wood, Yamano said. The carpet was vacuumed once or twice a week and steam 
cleaned yearly, Yamano said. 
</P>
<P>
But after 10 years of heavy use, the rug is ripped in many places and adhesive 
tape is peeling off temporary patches. Students often trip on loose edges and 
suffer painful rug burns, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The carpeted floor gave Oak Park an advantage over teams that were not used to 
playing on carpet, but Oak Park students were not learning proper playing 
techniques, Yamano said. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming off the carpet onto a regular floor is always a little hard for them. 
It takes 5 to 8 minutes just to get used to the wood," Yamano said. 
</P>
<P>
With a new floor, Oak Park students will not only be able to meet their 
opponents on an equal footing, but they will be able to hear the full roar of 
the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Because the carpeting absorbed much of the gym's noise, Yamano said, the crowd 
always sounded a little flat. "You also don't have that nice squeak when your 
sneakers slip," he said. CAROLYN KUSKY

OFFICIALS SHOCKED BY LOCKHEED RELOCATION; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: BURBANK CALLS THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE MOVE TO GEORGIA A BOMBSHELL, BUT 
PALMDALE DOES NOT EXPECT THE IMPACT TO BE DEVASTATING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Lockheed's announcement that it is relocating much of its activities from 
Southern California to Georgia surprised officials in Burbank and Palmdale, who 
had been expecting some bad news from the aerospace company, but not that much. 
</P>
<P>
Both cities will be heavily affected by the company's move, although Palmdale 
officials said they do not expect the impact to be devastating. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank officials have known for several years that Lockheed was planning a 
massive reduction of activities in the 1990s, but Mayor Tom Flavin called news 
that the company would pull out all its operations there a bombshell. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lockheed's announcement Tuesday burst what had been one of the 
brightest job hopes in 
</P>
<P>
the Antelope Valley, Palmdale Mayor William J. (Pete) Knight said he was not 
worried or alarmed, saying it meant only that the area will get fewer 
additional jobs than had been projected. 
</P>
<P>
The company announced in April, 1988, that it would relocate virtually all 
manufacturing, parts fabrication and engineering activities to newer facilities 
in Palmdale, Rye Canyon and Marietta, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest blow to the Antelope Valley was Lockheed's announcement that two 
major aircraft that it had been proposing to build in Palmdale -- the Advanced 
Tactical Fighter and the P-7A maritime patrol aircraft -- would be constructed 
instead at its Marietta facility. 
</P>
<P>
With the latest restructuring, Lockheed officials said they still expect the 
Antelope Valley work force to grow somewhat in the coming years. Spokesman Jim 
Ragsdale said that would depend on the business generated by the company's 
top-secret "Skunk Works" operation, now based in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials had been predicting Lockheed's Antelope Valley work force, 
now about 2,100, would increase to as many as 7,000 by the mid-1990s, and those 
workers were expected to be many of the 9,500 now employed in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
"They were forecasting jobs and apparently that's not going to materialize," 
said Knight, a former Air Force officer and test pilot. "But that doesn't mean 
that some other jobs may not materialize between now and then to take their 
place. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's going to have a significant impact" on the economy of the 
Antelope Valley, he said. "Those were anticipated jobs that may not 
materialize. If we don't get what we anticipated, it doesn't mean we've lost 
the economy." 
</P>
<P>
But Burbank officials had expected some corporate and administrative jobs to 
remain in the area. However, Ragsdale said that "by the end of 1994, the 
expectation is that there will be no activities of the aeronautical systems 
people in Burbank." He said the Lockheed Air Terminal will not be affected by 
the restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
Flavin said a company abandoning "325 acres of industrial property in a single 
city the size of Burbank cannot be expected to leave the city government and 
our operations unscathed." 
</P>
<P>
"No doubt that the city will feel a financial shock," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city had been in negotiations with Price Co. and Kornwasser 
&amp; Friedman Shopping Center properties for a shopping complex, and had been 
developing a master plan for the area in anticipation of the move. 
</P>
<P>
But in his prepared statement, Flavin said negotiations between city officials 
and Lockheed over use of the property have "bogged down for a number of 
reasons, including the toxic conditions of the property and price." 
</P>
<P>
Ragsdale said the move will not affect the Rye Canyon facility near Valencia, 
which now employs 1,000 people.

ZONING PLAN OKD FOR INDUSTRIAL PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET BERGAMO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Fillmore City Council on Tuesday night established a zoning plan for its 
proposed industrial park, with heavy industry confined to the northernmost 
section of the city and separated from the nearest housing by a buffer zone of 
light industry. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are differences in the two sections, neither would permit the 
manufacture of soap, acetylene gas, plastics or pickles. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the light-industry zone at the south end of the park would 
prohibit yards for construction equipment and businesses that rent heavy 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Business owners already operating in the industrial sector were assured at a 
council meeting last month that they would not be forced to change or relocate 
their businesses to comply with new regulations. In a few special cases, 
boundaries may be adjusted to accommodate them, or the city will grant them an 
exemption. 
</P>
<P>
A vote on an assessment district, which would raise funds for basic 
improvements to the proposed industrial park, is scheduled for late July. 
Property owners must agree to tax themselves more than $5 million before 
development can proceed. JANET BERGAMO

COUNCIL SEEKS WAY TO PAY FOR CROSSING

<P>
Responding to Caltrans' refusal to install a warning light for pedestrians next 
to Nordhoff High School, the Ojai City Council decided Tuesday to ask county 
and state officials for help. 
</P>
<P>
Unsure how to proceed, the council asked City Manager Andrew Belknap to meet 
with Ventura County and Ojai Unified School District officials to come up with 
a way to pay the $18,000 needed to install a flashing signal that students 
could activate to cross California 33. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to see us do it, even if we have to pay the entire cost ourselves," 
Councilman Joseph DeVito said. 
</P>
<P>
In another matter, acting as the Ojai Redevelopment Agency, the council asked 
Public Works Director Stan Moore to invite construction bids to strengthen the 
Ojai Valley Chamber of Commerce building to withstand earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
The city leases the unreinforced masonry building to the chamber. The chamber 
may need to relocate during the work, which is scheduled to begin July 9 and 
finish by Aug. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Moore was authorized to meet with utility company officials to plan a two-year 
project to place power cables underground along Ojai Avenue from Canada Street 
to Country Club Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The council also held a final vote to amend the city's plumbing code to 
conserve water during the drought. The code requires ultra-low water 
consumption toilets and shower heads in all new or remodeled buildings after 
June 7. THIA BELL

LAWYER SAYS SLAIN DRIVER THREATENED DEFENDANT'S DAUGHTER WITH KNIFE 
</P>

<P>
A defense attorney said Tuesday that Marco Sanchez was threatening Andrea 
Barton with a knife when he was fatally shot inside his car by the woman's 
father, Howard F. Barton Jr., last February. 
</P>
<P>
The comment by attorney Clyde Munsell came as a surprise in the first day of 
Howard Barton's preliminary hearing on a murder charge, which is being heard by 
San Diego Municipal Judge Rafael A. Arreola. A police report of the Feb. 22 
incident, based on witness interviews, does not mention such a threat against 
Andrea Barton, 20. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the elder Barton told police that Sanchez, 24, of National City, 
allegedly threatened him with a knife as Barton stood outside Sanchez's car and 
spoke to him. In March, Munsell said in an interview with The Times that Barton 
shot Sanchez once in self-defense when Sanchez threatened him with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Munsell made another surprising disclosure when he suggested that 
Barton almost shot his own daughter when he shot Sanchez. According to Munsell, 
Alicia Barton was "in the line of fire" when Barton, a La Jolla real estate 
agent, fired his gun. Barton had a permit from the San Diego County Sheriff's 
Department to carry a concealed weapon. 
</P>
<P>
The incident leading to Sanchez's death began when he exchanged words with 
Andrea Barton during a minor traffic altercation in Pacific Beach. 
</P>
<P>
According to a police report, her car stalled in traffic at Grand Avenue and 
Ingraham Street. Barton and Sanchez argued briefly before she drove to her 
father's real estate office on Cass Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Father and daughter then went looking for Sanchez and found him shopping in a 
store in the 1000 block of Garnet Avenue. Howard Barton confronted Sanchez and 
the two men began arguing. The argument continued after Sanchez entered his 
car. 
</P>
<P>
Barton said Sanchez threatened him with a knife from inside the car. Barton 
pulled out a handgun and fired one shot at Sanchez, hitting him in the back. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary hearing, which is expected to last three days, quickly became 
bogged down Tuesday when Munsell attempted to discredit the first prosecution 
witness, Alicia Pfingst. Pfingst, a district attorney employee who specializes 
in preparing trial exhibits, supervised a video re-enactment of the shooting 
based on reports by witnesses David Egley and Michael Natkemper 
</P>
<P>
It was while questioning Pfingst that Munsell alleged that Sanchez also 
threatened Andrea Barton with a knife and that she was almost shot by her 
father. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Chappell wants to use the video as evidence and put 
Pfingst on the stand to explain how the video was made and to justify its 
introduction into evidence. Munsell objected to the video on grounds the 
defense was not allowed to participate in or observe the making of the video, 
which was filmed at the crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
Munsell, who has seen the video, said it fails to show Sanchez threatening 
Alicia Barton with a knife. He complained that it also fails to show her in the 
line of fire. 
</P>
<P>
Pfingst testified that the video "accurately represents what each witness saw." 
She said Egley and Natkemper were present during the filming of the video and 
"directed" the movement of the law enforcement personnel who acted out the 
parts of Sanchez and the Bartons. 
</P>
<P>
Arreola will hear testimony today from a district attorney cameraman who shot 
the video, before ruling whether the tape can be used as evidence. However, the 
judge also said he might decide not to view the tape if he is satisfied with 
the witnesses' oral testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's hearing was also highlighted by complex and often rambling questions, 
asked by Munsell of Pfingst. On two occasions both the witness and Arreola 
complained that they did not understand Munsell's questions. 
</P>
<P>
On two other occasions, Munsell asked Arreola to tell Pfingst to provide him 
with copies of reports she submitted to the prosecution. Prosecutor Chappell 
responded to each request with a reminder that Munsell had received a copy of 
the report and proceeded to give him the catalogue number for the document. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing began with an in-chambers conference involving Munsell, Chappell 
and Arreola. When the trio returned to the courtroom, Arreola said he had 
denied a motion by Munsell to delay the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Munsell then tried unsuccessfully to bar news photographers from covering the 
hearing. He argued that camera coverage could jeopardize Barton's right to a 
fair trial by influencing witnesses to lie in their testimony. 
</P>
<P>
"Through no fault of his (Barton) own he has achieved substantial media 
coverage. . . . I see no reason to afford undue press coverage," Munsell said. 
</P>
<P>
Chappell and an attorney representing Sanchez's family argued against excluding 
the cameras. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't feel that any of our witnesses will be compelled to lie simply 
because cameras are here," Chappell said. 
</P>
<P>
Arreola denied Munsell's motion to exclude the cameras, ruling that he failed 
to show conclusively that camera coverage would harm Barton's right to a fair 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
Munsell also raised the ire of some Sanchez family members when he announced he 
planned to call Sanchez's widow, Gloria, to testify as a witness for the 
defense. He also asked Arreola to exclude Sanchez from the courtroom while the 
other witnesses testified. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney representing Gloria argued that she was not at the scene when her 
husband was shot and was not a material witness in the case. She also asked 
Arreola not to exclude her from the courtroom during witnesses' testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Arreola ruled that Sanchez could remain in the courtroom during such testimony, 
and apparently the woman will be allowed to be called as a witness by Munsell. 
It is not clear what her testimony will be. 
</P>
<P>
Munsell said he will call about 40 defense witnesses, an unusually large number 
for a preliminary hearing. Chappell said she will call seven witnesses.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY OKS GUARANTEE TO CLOSE LOPEZ DUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to ensure that the 
Lopez Canyon Landfill will be closed permanently even if a key component of a 
garbage disposal agreement between the county and city of Los Angeles falls 
through. 
</P>
<P>
Following the city's lead, the board voted 4 to 1 to modify the disposal 
agreement, which it had originally endorsed in March. 
</P>
<P>
In the earlier version, the city, which owns the Lopez dump, would have been 
allowed to reopen it if the proposed Elsmere Landfill in the Santa Clarita 
Valley could not accept the city's trash. 
</P>
<P>
Under the newly approved terms, the city is prohibited from reopening Lopez 
even if Elsmere can no longer take the city's trash. 
</P>
<P>
The city modified the agreement last month at the behest of City Councilman 
Ernani Bernardi, who wanted a guarantee that Lopez will never be reopened. 
Neighborhood activists have complained that the Lopez landfill is emitting 
toxic gas emissions and should be closed.

STEAMED HOTDOG VENDORS URGE COUNTY SUPERVISORS TO MODIFY HEALTH RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN O'SHAUGHNESSY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Instead of slathering mustard and relish on wieners Tuesday, a handful of 
hotdog vendors urged the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors Tuesday to 
make their dog-eat-dog lives easier. 
</P>
<P>
Boiling mad, the hotdog salesmen asked the board to modify rules that they 
contend are driving them out of business. The disputed health regulations 
require that vendors haul their carts each night to a commissary that can store 
their buns and meat and also wash their stands. 
</P>
<P>
The vendors complain that these commissaries charge exorbitant rents, maintain 
inconvenient hours and are too far away. 
</P>
<P>
"This law was designed to put hotdog carts out of business," said Mort Diamond, 
the San Fernando Valley's self-styled "hotdog king" and leader of the 
protesters. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond has butted heads with the bureaucracy before. Last year, Diamond quit 
the business in disgust and gave away his last 350 hotdogs rather than comply 
with the controversial regulations. 
</P>
<P>
In asking the supervisors to help, Diamond reminded them of an inscription 
prominently engraved in stone in the board's meeting room. 
</P>
<P>
"Right above your heads here -- I don't want to sound corny -- but it clearly 
states that this county is founded on free enterprise," Diamond said. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors seemed sympathetic to the wiener lobby's plight. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard this two years ago and I thought it was a racket then. I still think 
it's a racket," Supervisor Kenneth Hahn said to applause from the vendors in 
the front row. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Mike Antonovich introduced an emergency ordinance to allow any 
vendor operating fewer than three carts to park them elsewhere and to have the 
carts cleaned at a carwash. The matter was postponed until May 29 to allow the 
county counsel to determine if the county could help make life easier for the 
vendors. 
</P>
<P>
But two commissary owners, sitting across the aisle from the hotdog 
contingency, vigorously disputed the vendors' contentions. They argued that the 
commissaries help ensure that what the hotdogs consumers eat is not 
contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not here to rip anybody off, we're just providing a service," said 
Gabriel Garciamendez, the owner of One Stop Foods Co. in Los Angeles.

BRIDGES FREED; PROSECUTOR REFUSES TO FILE DRUG CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actor Todd Bridges was released from jail Tuesday after the Los Angeles County 
district attorney's office declined to file drug charges in his latest arrest, 
which occurred Saturday in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they had insufficient evidence to file charges against the 
24-year-old actor. However, a man arrested with Bridges, Stephen Mallen, 36, of 
North Hollywood, was charged with one count of possession of cocaine for sale. 
He was being held at the Van Nuys jail in lieu of $20,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges of Sun Valley and Mallen were arrested early Saturday by Los Angeles 
police when patrol officers became suspicious after seeing the two men seated 
in the actor's car, which was parked in front of a closed business on Victory 
Boulevard at Tujunga Avenue. After questioning the men, officers found more 
than 3 ounces of cocaine in the vehicle and in Mallen's possession, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Dist. Atty. Norm Shapiro said there was insufficient evidence to 
prove that Bridges was in possession of any of the cocaine. The prosecutor said 
the cocaine was found in Mallen's pants pocket, his wallet and in a bag between 
Mallen's seat and the passenger door. 
</P>
<P>
"We are unable to show Bridges was in possession of any of the narcotics," 
Shapiro said. "We can't prove that he had control over any of it." 
</P>
<P>
Bridges, who had been held in the Van Nuys jail since his arrest, was released 
Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges, a former star of the NBC sitcom "Diff'rent Strokes," is currently 
facing trial on an assault charge stemming from allegations that he shot and 
wounded a drug dealer inside a South-Central Los Angeles cocaine "rock" house 
in February, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In November, Bridges was acquitted of charges of attempted murder and attempted 
voluntary manslaughter in that case. But jurors deadlocked on a third charge of 
assault with a deadly weapon, and Bridges was released on $25,000 bail while 
awaiting a retrial on that charge. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors alleged that Bridges shot Kenneth Clay, 25, eight times while 
inside the rock house. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, Bridges received a suspended sentence in 1987 after pleading no 
contest to making a bomb threat. In 1983, he was fined $240 for carrying a 
concealed weapon.

RAMONA DOCTOR ARRAIGNED ON MOLESTATION CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 62-year-old Ramona physician was arraigned Tuesday on 23 counts of molesting 
an 11-year-old boy, and a San Diego County Sheriff's Department official said 
more charges may be brought as detectives sift through pornographic photographs 
seized at the doctor's office. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. John Byron DeKock, a registered sex offender who was once disciplined by 
the state medical board for a sexual abuse offense 28 years ago, pleaded not 
guilty to child molestation, sexual exploitation of a child and oral copulation 
with a child. DeKock is being held in San Diego County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing, Jack Phillips, DeKock's lawyer, had asked that his bail, set at 
$1.4 million, be lowered to $50,000 because DeKock needed to care for his 
ailing wife. But Deputy Dist. Atty. Eugenia Eyherabide told Municipal Judge 
Terry Knoepp that DeKock had been convicted in 1961 of molesting another young 
boy. 
</P>
<P>
Since DeKock's arrest, she said, several adults have called the prosecutor's 
office to say DeKock molested them when they were children. 
</P>
<P>
"This certainly has been an ongoing thing," said Eyherabide, who called DeKock 
"a danger to all children" and requested bail be set at $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Knoepp set bail at $250,000, on the condition that DeKock not practice 
medicine, not contact anyone under the age of 21 and not contact the victim or 
the victim's family. A preliminary hearing is set for June 5. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Michael Radovich said Sheriff's deputies searched DeKock's office and 
confiscated 22 photo albums and hundreds of color photographs, mostly of the 
11-year-old victim. The victim, a relative of DeKock, came forward last week. 
</P>
<P>
At DeKock's home, they found several expensive cameras, a video camera and 
light, videotapes and a several books, including "Pornography: Solutions 
Through Law." 
</P>
<P>
"There's a good chance there will be additional charges coming, stemming from 
what we found," said Radovich, adding that officials believe DeKock had 
molested the 11-year-old since 1986. "We think it's been going on with this one 
particular boy for at least four years. We have found other pictures that show 
the boy's development." 
</P>
<P>
In 1962, the Medical Board of California disciplined DeKock for the previous 
sexual abuse offense. According to Ron Cooke, a medical board regional 
supervisor, DeKock spent nine years on administrative probation for the 
offense, but no details are available because the records have been purged. 
</P>
<P>
Later, from 1981 to 1986, DeKock was placed on probation again for prescribing 
Demerol and Dilaudid, two habit-forming pain killers, in excessive amounts to 
two patients. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this disciplinary record, DeKock volunteered as the team physician for 
Ramona High School's athletic program in the early 1980s, according to Ramona 
School Board President Dan Plough, who said most Ramona residents were 
surprised by DeKock's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"What I can gather from the community is that most people were taken aback," 
Plough said. "You probably put as much trust in a practicing physician as you 
would into a teacher." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, DeKock's state medical license, which was issued in 1959, is in good 
standing, but Cooke said the state board will likely seek a court restraining 
order to prevent DeKock from practicing until the current allegations are 
resolved.

RELEASE OF 2 AMERICAN HOSTAGES BY LEBANESE SHIITE KIDNAPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. hostage Frank Reed has been released by his Shiite Muslim kidnapers. He 
was held for approximately 3 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
Although happy that he has been released and is back with his family, Reed is 
reported to be angry at everybody for the length of time he and others were 
kept, and that others are still there, too (Part A, May 3). 
</P>
<P>
I wonder how he thinks the rest of us feel? He was not in Lebanon on behalf of 
the United States government. For whatever reason, and it may have been a very 
noble reason, he chose to stay in Lebanon even when it was very clear that any 
American in Lebanon ran a very high risk of being kidnaped. Finally, he was 
kidnaped. What followed cost this country, both in terms of money and in terms 
of prestige. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he is angry at everybody that he was held so long. The person he needs to 
be angry at is himself for exposing himself to that danger as he did. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, I am a little angry at him for putting us all through this affair 
when it could so easily have been avoided, and for acting as if this hostage 
matter is capable of resolution by the United States government. 
</P>
<P>
He needs to grow up. This is a dangerous world. If you take a risk, then be 
prepared to take the consequences.

CAPITAL PUNISHMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I enjoy reading the Bible occasionally, but if the Christians, among others, 
who believe in capital punishment had lived in the time of Moses and Jesus, 
two-thirds of the Bible would never have been written. 
</P>
<P>
The principal subject of the Torah, or Old Testament, was Moses and what 
happened after he murdered the Egyptian guard before leading his people out of 
Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the New Testament was mostly written by Saul, who changed his name to 
Paul, after aiding in murdering the young Christian, Stephen. Before these two 
murderers would have had time to reform and be productive, California capital 
punishment advocates would have put them in the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Christ said, "It is written an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, but I 
say unto you, love your enemies, do good to them who persecute you." 
</P>
<P>
Christians do exactly the opposite in advocating capital punishment which 
premeditates the murder of people who premeditate murder.

I was amazed and gratified to read about Chilton Alphonse's donation of part of 
his $185,000 lottery winnings to his anti-gang agency, Community Youth Sports 
and Arts Foundation, based in South-Central Los Angeles (Metro, April 20). He 
is truly a good and unselfish man. Isn't it sad that while we live in the 
richest state in the richest country in the world, he cannot get state or 
federal funds? He will sacrifice what most of us would keep for ourselves, 
while others would spend $10 million to buy themselves a painting that few 
would ever see.

EFFECT OF DRUG WAR ON BLACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article on the effects of the drug war on minorities was both excellent 
and long overdue ("Blacks Feel Brunt of Drug War," front page, April 22). 
</P>
<P>
At the current rates of incarceration, by the year 2000, at least one-half of 
all of the young black men in America will be in prison or on parole. 
</P>
<P>
About 1.5 million black male teen-agers will be dead or in prison before their 
30th birthday. Young black men who go to prison are as good as dead. They do 
not come back as productive members of society. For every black teen-ager who 
goes to college, three will go to prison. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the General Accounting Office just released its own study 
which showed that medical treatment reduces drug addiction, health problems, 
and drug-related crime by at least 85%. The vast majority of drug users who 
received treatment became productive members of society in less time than the 
average prison sentence for drugs, at about one-tenth the cost of prison. 
</P>
<P>
The federal goals, as outlined by drug czar William Bennett, will destroy at 
least half of an entire black generation -- even if the drugs do not. This is 
not a sensible drug policy. This is wholesale slaughter.

REDEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE CHANGES ELECTION POLICIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Community advisers for the North Hollywood Redevelopment Project Tuesday night 
unveiled new regulations to tighten up the group's election procedures after 
voter confusion at a meeting two months ago ended in a shoving match. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-member group is called the Project Area Committee or PAC. 
</P>
<P>
The new rules, which PAC members will vote on at next month's meeting, call for 
voters and candidates in attendance on election night to provide proof that 
they reside or own a business in the 740-acre North Hollywood redevelopment 
zone. Residents must show identification containing a picture, such as a 
driver's license, and merchants will have to bring a copy of their business 
license before being allowed to vote for PAC members. 
</P>
<P>
Election notifications would be published in a newspaper, and elections would 
be held at the first PAC meeting 30 days after publication. 
</P>
<P>
The committee did not reschedule the controversial elections to fill nine 
vacancies on the volunteer panel. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel these changes are appropriate and basically nail down all our 
procedures," David Gered said. "We want to make sure elections are fair and for 
everyone to know what kind of proof is needed." 
</P>
<P>
The regulations stemmed from a contentious meeting in March, when several 
redevelopment foes from Hollywood accused the PAC of conducting elections 
tainted by insufficient public notice and confusing rules on voter eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the confusion, two North Hollywood PAC members walked out of the meeting, 
depriving the panel of a quorum and leading to an abrupt, angry adjournment. 
When a Hollywood resident attempted to videotape the comments of a North 
Hollywood PAC member, a shoving incident erupted. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, a uniformed Los Angeles police sergeant stood watch over the 
meeting at the First Baptist Church on Ostego Street. Police were called by the 
CRA at the request of PAC members, said Jerry Belcher, the redevelopment 
project director. 
</P>
<P>
Several Hollywood activists attended the meeting, and one man videotaped the 
discussions. The Hollywood residents have long protested redevelopment plans in 
their own neighborhood and have said they are determined to bring their 
campaign against CRA policies to North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Norton Halper of Hollywood, one of the protesters at the previous meeting, told 
the group, "It's unfortunate you may think of me in an adversarial role," but 
he said the interests of the redevelopment agency and the interests of the 
inhabitants of the area do not always coincide. 
</P>
<P>
The protests come at a sensitive time for the North Hollywood redevelopment 
project. The CRA is planning to mount its own drive soon to seek public 
approval to empower the agency to spend tens of millions of tax dollars to 
continue urban renewal in the area. The City Council and mayor will ultimately 
approve the massive spending increases.

<P>
Three devices used to inject a potentially harmful drug that washed ashore on 
local beaches were distributed by the Department of Defense, officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The injectors, which release a chemical that is an antidote for nerve gas, were 
traced to a DOD depot in Tracy, Calif., said Cmdr. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Schamp, a Navy spokesman. Investigators were able to link the injectors to 
the depot by lot numbers printed on the devices. 
</P>
<P>
The devices had washed ashore along with 100 bottles of penicillin and several 
hundred strips of antimalarial drugs, all of which are routinely supplied to 
military personnel. The penicillin and antimalarial medications, however, 
carried no lot numbers, making it difficult to trace their origins. 
</P>
<P>
The medical debris is the first since a flood of syringes and other hazardous 
waste were discovered in late 1988. Much of that debris carried military labels 
and markings. 
</P>
<P>
County officials have cautioned beach-goers to avoid contact with the 
injectors, which will release the drug atropine. Atropine can cause fever, 
delirium and giddiness. Anyone injected with the crayon-sized devices should 
contact a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials say it's unlikely that they can further trace the origin of the 
injectors that washed ashore to a particular vessel, base or even a civilian 
business contracted to dispose of the waste. The depot supplies military bases 
on the West Coast, as well as those in Japan and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Naval Investigative Service helped trace the debris to the 
Northern California depot.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: RAMONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Repairs to the major pipeline that supplies imported water to the North County 
community of Ramona were progressing on schedule Tuesday, said Becky Coates, 
spokeswoman for the Ramona Municipal Water District. 
</P>
<P>
About 33,000 customers in the Ramona area have been ordered to maintain strict 
rationing controls during the emergency, which began Sunday night when the 
pipeline broke under built-up pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Coates said the work should be completed by tonight after a replacement sleeve 
arrives from an out-of-state supplier. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, no outside water use is allowed by residents and other water uses 
are restricted. 
</P>
<P>
With cutoff of imported water, the community must depend on a 
5-million-gallon-a-day supply from Sutherland Reservoir.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The renaming of UC San Diego's Third College for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther 
King Jr. will be proposed to campus governing authorities, it was announced 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The college, one of five that make up the undergraduate program at UCSD, was 
established in 1970 out of the caldron of 1960s political activism, with the 
goal of setting a more socially conscious academic agenda for students. 
</P>
<P>
The current name reflects the college's position as the third established at 
UCSD, after Revelle and Muir colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Third College Provost Cecil Lytle, who oversees the curriculum requirements for 
the college's 3,000 students, has been eager for a name change to symbolize 
more closely the college's academic philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of King's name resulted from several months of meetings among 
students and faculty associated with the college, and after students selected 
the name of the slain civil rights leader during an advisory vote during 
student elections last month. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation will now go to a university committee that advises UCSD 
Chancellor Richard C. Atkinson on names for all campus buildings and programs. 
Should Atkinson approve the change, he will submit King's name to the statewide 
UC Board of Regents for final approval.

CLANDESTINE TOXIC WASTE EXPORTS TO MEXICO ON RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN and LARRY B. STAMMER, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A growing number of Southern California businesses are clandestinely trucking 
their hazardous wastes to Mexico to dodge increasingly stringent and costly 
environmental laws here, according to law enforcement investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are few hard statistics to chronicle the illicit trafficking -- 
in large part because of spotty enforcement -- government officials as well as 
haulers and generators of the waste said they believe that the practice is on 
the upswing. 
</P>
<P>
William Carter, a Los Angeles County deputy district attorney who prosecutes 
environmental crimes, cites a "big hole in enforcement." Reports of illegal 
waste shipments to Mexico come into his office about twice a week, indicating a 
"steady stream" of such shipments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"To some of the people who are involved, Mexico is one big trash can and it 
doesn't really matter what goes down there," Carter said. "It's not realistic 
to think what we send down there won't come back in foods, water pollution, air 
pollution or pottery we buy from Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities predict the problem is only going to worsen. On Tuesday, a new 
federal rule was announced by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that is 
expected to make legal dumping even more costly. 
</P>
<P>
The rule, which was attacked by environmental groups as too weak, will require 
more kinds of hazardous wastes to be treated before they can be dumped in a 
landfill. A substance is considered hazardous if it poses a threat to humans or 
to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
By May, 1992, most waste deemed hazardous under the rule will have to be 
treated to reduce its toxicity before the residues can be taken to a landfill. 
The restrictions could become significantly tighter if expected challenges by 
environmental groups succeed. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Lance Erickson, an investigator in the California Highway Patrol's 
environmental crimes unit, joined other law enforcement officials in predicting 
even more illegal trafficking of hazardous wastes because of the new 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (the trafficking) is going to increase because the prices are going to 
go up again," Erickson said. "The bottom line is greed and money." 
</P>
<P>
In one of the few cases now under investigation, drums that has contained 
hazardous waste from the United States eventually were sold in a working-class 
Mexican neighborhood for water storage. "In most cases, the barrel is the 
commodity of value down there," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
In another instance, drums of cyanide solution from a North Hollywood 
metal-plating business that were destined for Mexico were listed as new 
products in the shipment manifest prepared by the trucker. The Mexicali address 
given as the destination turned out to be a wheat field. 
</P>
<P>
"We are noticing this problem with increasing frequency," said Cesar Catalan of 
the Secretariat of Urban Development and Ecology (SEDUE), the Mexican version 
of the EPA. Catalan said the materials are dumped "any place that isn't 
populated" and in places "that are easy to reach," such as spots along the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
The smuggling cases are difficult to prove, say California prosecutors, who 
often must rely on informants and witnesses. Any material that is considered 
waste under federal or state law cannot be taken across the border without the 
permission of Mexican environmental authorities. A one-two punch of 
increasingly strict environmental regulations and fewer legal landfills willing 
to take hazardous wastes hits hardest against such firms as metal platers, 
aerospace parts makers and radiator repair shops, which generate large amounts 
of toxic garbage. 
</P>
<P>
To dispose of hazardous wastes legally in this country, a generator must have 
his waste transported, treated and disposed of by a licensed firm. The process 
is increasingly costly and California landfills that will accept hazardous 
wastes are dwindling in number. 
</P>
<P>
A drum of hazardous waste that may have cost $140 to dispose of six years ago 
now costs $300, according to a waste management company. One prosecutor said 
the costs can go as high as $1,000 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Small- and medium-sized toxic waste generators -- often hard pressed to make 
ends meet -- are responsible for much of the illicit trafficking, investigators 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Bishop, a hazardous materials specialist in Santa Barbara County, said if 
he was "in the business and had a choice of spending $500,000 to get rid of 
chromic acid or to give someone $5,000 to get rid of it, the economic incentive 
is so great. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"People are under a lot of pressure to do something with it and, unfortunately 
with small business people, it hits them particularly hard." 
</P>
<P>
Barry Roeser, general partner in a Baldwin Park hazardous waste consulting and 
referral service, told The Times he approached a financially troubled lumber 
company in the San Gabriel Valley a month ago to arrange for legal disposal of 
the firm's hazardous wastes. At the last minute, Roeser said, the businessman 
decided not to use his services. 
</P>
<P>
" 'I don't need you any more,' " Roeser quoted the businessman as saying. " 
'I'm sending it to Mexico.' 
</P>
<P>
"If you can get away with it," Roeser said in an interview, "what can I say? I 
know he took it to Mexico. What he did with it I don't know. . . . I imagine it 
just got dumped somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
The likelihood of being apprehended is remote, authorities say. Typically, U.S. 
customs inspectors watch only traffic headed north from Mexico. Southbound 
traffic entering Mexico gets little notice on the U.S. side, and there are 
reports that bribery occurs among Mexican border authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP has only five investigators from Fresno to the Mexican border probing 
illegal waste shipments. The EPA, which is in charge of policing waste 
shipments across the border, has only one agent and two investigators to 
enforce several federal environmental statutes in California as well as three 
other Western states and U.S. islands in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really have the staff to pursue this export thing," said EPA resident 
agent-in-charge David Wilma, who is based in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Although some officials have pleaded for years for strict border controls on 
hazardous waste, a San Diego County Hazardous Waste Task Force is only now 
formulating a plan to crack down. 
</P>
<P>
Anastacio Medina, a Los Angeles County hazardous materials investigator, said 
he urged participants at a San Diego hazardous waste workshop called by the EPA 
in late 1984 to take more action. 
</P>
<P>
"We were told to mind our own business and let the feds do what they are 
supposed to be doing -- even though we know they are not doing it," Medina 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought it was inhuman the way (waste) was being handled in the hills and 
ravines of Tijuana," he said. "Eventually these materials -- when the rains 
come -- are carried by the water down to the Tijuana River bed and contaminate 
some of the (well) water that Tijuana depends on. It also runs across the 
border into San Ysidro, so we do have a mutual interest." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County environmental prosecutors say most of their time is spent on 
illegal dumping within the county, not on tracking substances across the 
border. The district attorney's office, which has one of the nation's toughest 
environmental crime units, has prosecuted at least 100 cases involving illegal 
disposal within the region -- in vacant lots, the Santa Monica Mountains and 
even back yards. In contrast, the office is now investigating about six cases 
of trafficking to Mexico. Charges in one case may be filed this week. 
</P>
<P>
Just as in local dumping, the smuggling of wastes into Mexico often is done by 
individuals who make a living in such trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the usual arrangements for exporting wastes, prosecutors say 
transporters and brokers typically collect a fee from waste generators to pick 
up the waste and provide the generator with the name of a facility and address 
in Mexico where the waste purportedly will be used as a new product -- possibly 
in a manufacturing process. The waste often is put into clean drums and labeled 
as new before it reaches the border. Shipping papers are filled out listing the 
cargo as unused. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the transporter both hauls and arranges a contact on the Mexican 
border and sometimes he uses a broker to act as the middleman to arrange the 
Mexican connection. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the fee paid by the generator is substantially less than the cost 
of dumping the toxics legally. Customs officials rarely, if ever, open up such 
drums. 
</P>
<P>
"The generator relies on these brokers or these transporters and is naive," 
said Carter of the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. "They want to 
believe that this stuff is (a new) product in Mexico, and that they are going 
to save money and do it legally. 
</P>
<P>
"That is what they want to believe. Whether they do believe it is a different 
story." 
</P>
<P>
By labeling the waste as an unused material, transporters and generators try to 
take advantage of some ambiguities in the laws, investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really kind of an honor system," Carter said. "We get stuck in this 
quandary of what is waste and what is (a new) product." 
</P>
<P>
Legally, the generator is responsible for the waste and can be held liable if 
it is improperly dumped. But tracing waste once it gets past the Mexican border 
is difficult. Although some waste, such as old paint, may be used again in 
Mexico, other toxic materials may simply be dumped in fields or streams, 
authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big scam," said Bill Jones, chief of investigators for the Los Angeles 
County Health Department's hazardous materials control program. "And it's the 
old story: Once you get to the border, the horses stop. We can't go any 
further." 
</P>
<P>
As serious as it is, the trafficking of hazardous waste from California to 
Mexico is but one facet of the growing problem of toxic exports. Hundreds of 
businesses owned by Americans and other foreigners operating on the Mexican 
side of the border are required by agreements reached between the various 
nations to return their hazardous waste to "the country of origin" for proper 
disposal. 
</P>
<P>
But state health authorities said they had no idea how much, if any, of the 
waste is being returned to California. Some authorities fear that waste 
produced by the Mexican border firms is being illegally dumped in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have as good a handle on it as we would like to," state Health 
Department spokesman Allan Hirsch said Tuesday. "We certainly hope it's not 
being dumped clandestinely in Mexico." An EPA enforcement agent said the agency 
has gotten reports of wastes from the border firms being returned to California 
for treatment, but he could not say how much. 
</P>
<P>
While several authorities estimated that perhaps only 10% of toxic waste 
generated in California is shipped out-of-state illegally, that still adds up 
to a formidable amount. California ranks 15th in the nation in legal toxic 
waste exports -- about 15.8 million pounds in 1987 -- according to an 
accounting made public this week by Inform, a New York City-based environmental 
research organization. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say there are at least 50,000 generators of hazardous waste in the 
state, about 17,500 in Los Angeles County. According to the California 
Department of Health Services, only about 15 California firms have legally 
transported hazardous materials to foreign countries, primarily to Mexico, 
since reporting began in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
To be exported legally into Mexico, the hazardous substance must be usable or 
recyclable and officially acceptable to the Mexican government. But many firms 
can't or won't meet that test. 
</P>
<P>
Francis Odell, president of a large, modern metal-plating firm in Bell Gardens, 
said some metal-plating businesses are in such financial disarray that they are 
going out of business. 
</P>
<P>
Although most firms that remain comply with environmental regulations, Odell 
said, "a minority" look for the easy way out. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got an economic problem of what to do," he said, "and if they are 
given an offer to truck it off to Mexico, what do you do? It's tough to be 
moral when you're broke."

JEWISH LEADERS MARK PLOTTING OF HOLOCAUST; 
</P>

WORLD WAR II: THEIR MEETING WHERE THE KILLING WAS MAPPED IS INTENDED TO PREVENT 
ANY REPETITION.

WEST BERLIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a warm spring morning Tuesday, 45 years to the day after the collapse of 
Nazism, the Holocaust came full circle. 
</P>
<P>
It happened outside the three-story stuccoed villa in the picturesque Berlin 
suburb of Wannsee where on Jan. 20, 1942, a handful of Nazi government 
officials gathered for just a few hours and clinically planned the 
extermination of European Jewry. 
</P>
<P>
After a protracted, controversial debate in the Judaic world, a small group of 
Jewish leaders gathered on the villa's grounds Tuesday with the stated aim of 
keeping the memory of what happened there alive so that it might never happen 
again. 
</P>
<P>
A declaration written by Nobel Peace laureate and Holocaust survivor Elie 
Wiesel said in part: 
</P>
<P>
" . . . when we Jews visit and listen to the somber and dark echoes at Wannsee, 
we aim at preventing future generations from inheriting our past as their 
future." 
</P>
<P>
Wiesel was absent because of an earlier commitment, but his brief statement was 
read in Hebrew, English and German. The ceremony was attended by several dozen 
Jews and a small group of German dignitaries. Many could not hold back their 
tears, unable to heed Wiesel's injunction: "Cry? One must not cry here! If you 
begin, you will not stop. How many tears does one shed for thousands of 
communities?" 
</P>
<P>
The commemoration came on the final day of the first formal gathering of world 
Jewish leaders in Germany since the rise of Nazism nearly 60 years ago. The 
gathering is part of a highly visible attempt by Jewish leaders to establish a 
new relationship with Germany as the process of reunification begins. 
</P>
<P>
World Jewish Congress officials have praised the success of West Germany's 
democracy, but there is apprehension as unity proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart says stay away, but my mind says there is a new Germany here," said 
World Jewish Congress Vice President Isi Leibler, explaining in an interview 
after the ceremony why he decided to attend. "With hope for the future, we must 
ensure that this new Germany will make a commitment that their children and the 
children of those children will understand (the Holocaust). Only then can we 
survive." 
</P>
<P>
Leibler referred to the powerful differences among Jews about the visit but 
said it was a matter of personal conscience. He said those who first supported 
the decision for the Wannsee ceremony were mainly concentration camp survivors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a good feeling to be here," said Samuel Pastarnak, 67, an Auschwitz 
survivor who now lives in Nuremberg. "But it is something that must be done." 
</P>
<P>
The Wannsee ceremony occurred exactly 45 years after Adolf Hitler's Third Reich 
surrendered unconditionally to the United States and its allies, ending World 
War II in Europe. The day was commemorated in several German cities. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, Jewish leaders meeting here have repeated a single plea to German 
leaders and opinion makers: Don't let the memory of the Holocaust die, don't 
let it be falsified. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's trip to Wannsee was in that spirit, conference organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't pray here, for I personally believe God has turned his face away from 
this place, as he did at Auschwitz," World Jewish Congress President Edgar M. 
Bronfman told the gathering. 
</P>
<P>
For many, the horror of that meeting captured the horror of the Holocaust 
itself -- that ordinary men, when told of the plan, never questioned it but 
instead planned the extermination of an entire race with a bureaucratic 
precision that made it seem simply one more routine task. 
</P>
<P>
The exact number of those who attended the Jan. 20, 1942, meeting that sealed 
the fate of about 6 million Jews is unclear. Some accounts talk of 12, others 
13 and still others 15. 
</P>
<P>
One of Hitler's top lieutenants, Reinhard Heydrich, presided, while a 
middle-ranking SS officer named Adolf Eichmann took the minutes. The rest were 
anonymous government and security functionaries. 
</P>
<P>
The villa, then a little-used retreat for senior SS (elite force) officers, 
lies in a particularly leafy and tranquil district of what is now southwestern 
West Berlin, taking its name from a nearby lake that serves as a playground for 
the city's residents. It was selected because of the sensitivity of the subject 
to be discussed. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ekkehard Klausa, who administers memorial sites for the West 
Berlin government, historical accounts show that both Eichmann and Heydrich 
were extremely apprehensive that some of the meeting's participants might 
protest what became known as the "Final Solution." 
</P>
<P>
They did not, and Eichmann and Heydrich celebrated that lack of dissent 
afterward with cigars and brandy. 
</P>
<P>
While the decision to murder the Jews had been taken earlier by Hitler, those 
at the Wannsee meeting carefully defined who was a Jew, where the Jewish 
populations were located and how they would be transported from their homes to 
the death camps. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, in the chamber rooms of this villa, regulations were determined that 
then went through the inevitable and proper bureaucratic procedure across 
hundreds of tidy desks to take the form of the cattle cars eastward, of 
barracks behind barbed wire and finally the gas chambers and crematoria," the 
head of the German Jewish Council, Heinz Galinski, told the Tuesday gathering. 
"The horror that we connect with the names Auschwitz, Treblinka . . . they have 
their origins here in Wannsee." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's ceremony concluded with the Israeli anthem. 
</P>
<P>
The villa, which was a youth hostel for much of the postwar period, is being 
turned into a museum and seminar center on the Holocaust and Nazi period. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, the East German Parliament marked the day with a moment of silence 
and, for the second time in less than a month, admitted that East Germans share 
responsibility for the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
"No one should forget guilt and no one should deny responsibility," 
parliamentary Speaker Sabine Bergman-Pohl said in a ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere asked Jews for forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"We extend our hand in reconciliation and to work together for a common 
future," he later said in a luncheon address to a joint meeting of the World 
Jewish Congress and the European Jewish Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"A Germany without Jews never existed and it cannot exist without Jews. . . . A 
German unification cannot be a revival of 1933. We request you to have 
confidence in us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere also promised to fight a revival of anti-Semitic feeling among 
German youth. 
</P>
<P>
"It fills us with concern. No people can get rid of the dark side of its past," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Communists, who ruled East Germany for 40 years until last fall's 
revolutions swept through the region, had always denied that their country had 
any responsibility for the Holocaust, claiming instead that, because Hitler 
also persecuted Communists, East Germany shared a common legacy with the 
victims of Nazism.

BIG PARADE MAY BE BALM FOR RESTIVE SOVIET MILITARY 
</P>

<P>
When World War II-vintage tanks trundle across Red Square this morning, the 
roar of their engines will be a hymn to an institution once virtually 
sacrosanct but now subject to increasingly harsh criticism: the Soviet armed 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
On this Victory Day, when the Soviet Union marks the 45th anniversary of Nazi 
Germany's surrender and the end of the Red Army's long trek to Berlin, Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev, the commander in chief, has ordered a military parade. But his 
decision and other recent Kremlin actions are motivated as much by the need to 
placate present-day soldiers as the desire to honor veterans of what is known 
here as the Great Patriotic War. 
</P>
<P>
For five years into perestroika, Gorbachev's national restructuring drive, many 
of the leaders of the 4-million-strong Soviet armed forces, the world's largest 
standing military force, are increasingly leery about where their nation is 
headed, viewing ethnic strife, secession movements and looming economic 
collapse as natural out-growths of Kremlin policy. 
</P>
<P>
Of special concern to the brass are the rise in draft-dodging and resistance to 
compulsory military service, the subordination of top generals and admirals in 
the crafting of national security policy to what one general derided as 
civilian "new thinkers," unprecedented public criticism of the military as a 
"parasite" feeding on society and a palpable decline in its prestige. 
</P>
<P>
"Political loudmouths are cropping up in our country," an irate Marshal Viktor 
G. Kulikov, the former Warsaw Pact commander, said this week. "Denigrating the 
military feat by the Soviet people, they never think of the fact that they can 
live today because fallen soldiers paid for this right on the battlefields of 
the last war. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not icons, we do not demand prayers," Kulikov said. "But we definitely 
do not deserve insults and we will not tolerate them." 
</P>
<P>
In what must be a nightmare for older commanders like the 68-year-old Kulikov, 
who commanded a tank brigade against the Nazis, the specter of a strong, united 
Germany has also reappeared, with the blessing of Soviet political leaders to 
boot. 
</P>
<P>
For many in this nation, which by current official count lost a staggering 27 
million soldiers and civilians during its four-year struggle with the Nazis, no 
number of diplomatic guarantees of Germany's peaceful future could suppress all 
qualms. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Gorbachev has been using the tactic of the "knout and the 
cookie" -- the Russian version of "carrot and stick" -- to get the military 
more solidly behind his domestic agenda and foreign policy initiatives that 
include a unilateral 500,000-man cut in the armed forces. He did it again 
Tuesday, waxing both reassuring and critical as he addressed a group of 
officers and World War II veterans at the Bolshoi Theater. 
</P>
<P>
"We are far from being satisfied with the current situation in the army. And of 
course it cannot be beyond the pale of criticism," Gorbachev told his audience, 
who listened in stony silence. "Our perestroika forces us to have a new look at 
the army." 
</P>
<P>
He also rejected calls from some quarters of the military that he crack down on 
"anti-socialists" in Soviet society. Earlier this week, in a meeting with 
veterans, he shook off suggestions that he become a strong-arm ruler, saying: 
"When people say I should use my power, I understand it to mean that law should 
guide our society." 
</P>
<P>
However, Gorbachev also vowed that the armed forces will be given adequate 
means to defend the country. In recent months, the leadership has also plied 
top commanders with favors, and U.S. officials even report that the Soviets 
revamped their stance at the superpower arms talks to assuage the military's 
worries that the Kremlin is neglecting national security for the sake of meager 
foreign policy gains. (One of Gorbachev's top advisers, Alexander N. Yakovlev, 
denied that charge last week.) 
</P>
<P>
In pronouncements by career soldiers, there is often the clear feeling that 
they have become virtual social outcasts, with the Soviet people and Communist 
Party they have been defending now deaf to their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"Political nihilism, draft dodging, egoism and nationalism are growing among 
youth, together with the crime rate and selfishness," a retired army colonel 
from Vitebsk said recently. "We fail to understand the positions of many 
publications and the placidity on the part of the ideological departments of 
the (Communist Party) Central Committee." 
</P>
<P>
Of particular concern is how soldiers now being withdrawn from Eastern Europe 
and brought home will be housed in this apartment-short society and what the 
government will do to retrain the half a million people it is cutting from the 
military rolls to help find work in civilian life. 
</P>
<P>
Today's parade continues the Soviet leadership's overtures to World War II 
veterans and the men and women who have succeeded them. Military attaches from 
Atlantic Alliance countries say the affair has all the trappings of a hastily 
laid-on event. At the most recent parade, in 1985 on the 40th anniversary of 
Victory Day, Soviet officers had indicated that the next would be in 2005, the 
60th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
At the foot of the Kremlin's brick walls, a regiment of veterans, home-front 
workers, partisans and underground resistance fighters will march across Red 
Square, preceded by the red banner hoisted atop the Reichstag when Berlin fell 
to the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov and other dignitaries will look on from 
Lenin's mausoleum, where Gorbachev and the ruling Politburo stood when tens of 
thousands of demonstrators jeered them at May Day celebrations last week. 
</P>
<P>
World War II-era equipment such as T-34 tanks and "Stalin organ" rocket 
launchers have been taken out of mothballs and will appear in the parade. But 
the Soviets have also promised a lavish showing of state-of-the-art weaponry, 
including the first public display of the new BMP-3 infantry fighting vehicle, 
the BM-22 multiple rocket launcher, the SA-10 surface-to-air missile, a combat 
vehicle for airborne troops and a new medium tank. 
</P>
<P>
"Saying this parade is just about World War II is a lot of horse-hockey," one 
Western military attache said when asked to comment on the array of modern 
hardware. 
</P>
<P>
A recent promotion for the burly, bushy-browed Yazov is also a sign of the 
political leadership's new attention to military sensitivities. The defense 
minister was elevated to the rank of marshal from general of the army last 
week, despite previous indications that Gorbachev had ruled that marshal's rank 
would no longer be conferred in peacetime.

LOCKHEED PULLOUT TO COST 4,500 JOBS IN SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lockheed will eliminate as many as 4,500 jobs from its Southern California 
operations over the next several years largely under a corporate reorganization 
in which several major military aircraft programs will be transferred to 
facilities in Marietta, Ga., the company announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed will move the headquarters of its Aeronautical Systems Co. to Georgia 
from Burbank this year, and proceed with an earlier plan to move its advanced 
development projects -- better known as the Skunk Works -- to Palmdale from 
Burbank, all in a complex effort to reduce costs. 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1990s, the company said it will largely vacate its 325-acre site in 
Burbank and either eliminate the 9,500 jobs at that location or transfer them 
to Palmdale or Georgia. The land, adjacent to the Burbank airport, is worth 
roughly $1 million per acre. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed executives said they did not have an exact assessment of the job 
impact, but of the 12,600 Lockheed aircraft workers located in Los Angeles 
County as of April 1, an estimated 8,100 would remain by the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed said it would transfer 500 headquarters staff jobs to Georgia by the 
end of this year. In addition, the firm will either transfer to Georgia or 
phase out programs that currently employ 2,000 people. And last month, it 
announced that it would lay off 2,000 workers by this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated 8,100 jobs that will remain in Los Angeles County assumes that 
the Skunk Works operation remains at its current level of 4,000 to 5,000 
employees and that the 1,000 jobs at the firm's research facilities at Rye 
Canyon are unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
At its worst, the decision means that many thousands of potential jobs -- if 
Lockheed wins the competition to build the Air Force's advanced tactical 
fighter -- would go to Georgia, rather than Palmdale, as previously planned. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the ATF, Lockheed will move production of the Navy P-7A to Georgia and 
may move support and spare parts work for such programs as the L-1011 
commercial jetliner and the S-3 Viking Navy patrol aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The Lockheed announcement marks the most dramatic instance of an aerospace firm 
moving operations out of Southern California, but the trend to expand and 
relocate outside the state has been building for nearly 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the aerospace industry grew in Southern California during the 
military buildup of the 1980s, it also was setting up operations out of state 
that now threaten to worsen the downturn brought on by Pentagon budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Lockheed, the Los Angeles operations of McDonnell Douglas, 
Hughes Aircraft, Northrop and General Dynamics have relocated or opened 
satellite factories in Utah, Arizona, Arkansas and Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed Chairman Daniel Tellep said the reorganization will save $75 million 
by eliminating the need to build facilities for the ATF in Palmdale, and will 
save another $50 million annually through efficiencies. The massive Marietta 
facility, which is owned by the Air Force and leased to Lockheed, has been 
partially vacant since Lockheed completed the C-5B program last year. It 
employs 9,800. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think this is a marginal benefit," Tellep said. "This is a major 
benefit." 
</P>
<P>
He said Lockheed had been studying the plan to separate the Aeronautical 
Systems Co. from the Skunk Works for several years and had received 
recommendations to do so from the consulting firm Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Tellep said, "I don't think it is a vote of confidence against 
Southern California. We were already phasing out all of our manufacturing 
operations in Burbank. This is a logical consequence of a path we already were 
on." 
</P>
<P>
The decision, which was approved after a daylong board of directors meeting, 
was forced by the bleak defense industry outlook, Tellep added. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed's ATF program was delayed two years in a decision announced last month 
by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. Also, problems at Lockheed in the development 
of the Navy P-7A patrol aircraft program have forced a two-year delay, 
according to Navy officials. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to forgo $75 million in new facilities in Palmdale comes after 
Lockheed has invested $100 million there in recent years. Those new facilities 
will be taken over by the Skunk Works, but based on current workload they will 
not be fully occupied, according to Kenneth W. Cannestra, president of 
Lockheed's Aeronautical Systems Co. 
</P>
<P>
Cannestra said Lockheed has no plans to sell the Palmdale facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"We think that the Skunk Works at the 4,000 to 5,000 employee level can be a 
financially profitable stand-alone entity," Tellep said. "The question is 
whether it grows or contracts." 
</P>
<P>
Tellep said opportunities are not as great as they once were for the Skunk 
Works. The operation has specialized in producing secret aircraft in small 
numbers, typically under 100. It will shortly deliver to the Air Force the 
final F-117A, a specialized attack aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
A Lockheed announcement said the firm will offer early retirement incentives to 
ease the impact. "We deeply regret the need to eliminate those jobs," Tellep 
said in a statement. "We know how painful it is for employees and their 
families. But this action is absolutely essential if we are to remain 
competitive and win new business." 
</P>
<P>
Additional layoffs are possible beyond those previously announced, a spokesman 
said. It was left unclear which employees would be offered transfers. 
</P>
<P>
"They would not be forced to go down there and eat grits," Lockheed spokesman 
Jim Ragsdale said. "They would be given a choice. But it may be a choice 
between that and being unemployed." 
</P>
<P>
Burbank Mayor Tom Flavin called the news that the company would pull out all 
its operations there an "economic bombshell." 
</P>
<P>
"No doubt the city will feel a financial shock from Lockheed's departure," he 
said in a statement. "But we will emerge an ecologically cleaner and 
financially stronger city from this experience." 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed's announcement dimmed what had been one of the brightest job prospects 
in the Palmdale area, a major center of aerospace activity. Company officials 
had been predicting Lockheed's Antelope Valley work force was going to increase 
to as many as 7,000 by the mid-1990s.

DOCTORS TAKE AIM AT INFANT MORTALITY; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: OBSTETRICIANS AND GYNECOLOGISTS WILL SET UP PANELS TO STUDY REASONS FOR 
THE NATION'S HIGH DEATH RATE AMONG CHILDREN UNDER AGE 1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANNY SCOTT, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The country's largest organization of obstetricians and gynecologists is 
setting up a nationwide system to review infant deaths in hopes of pinpointing 
the medical, social and economic conditions responsible for the nation's 
troubling infant-mortality rate. 
</P>
<P>
The program, to be announced today in San Francisco, would establish for the 
first time regional committees of physicians and lay people that would 
systematically scrutinize many of the more than 38,000 infant deaths that occur 
in the United States each year. 
</P>
<P>
The federally supported system is modeled in part on the so-called maternal 
mortality reviews done in the United States earlier in this century. That 
program is credited with helping bring dramatic reductions in the rate at which 
U.S. women die during childbirth. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you identify the major contributing causes, that in itself stimulates 
action," said Dr. Ezra Davidson, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Martin 
Luther King Medical Center in Los Angeles and the driving force behind the 
infant-mortality review plan. 
</P>
<P>
"We really are too generic, too general about the problem, which disables 
people from doing anything about it," said Davidson, who intends to announce 
the plan today in his inaugural address as president at the annual meeting of 
the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson is the first black president of the college. His hospital, in Watts, 
has had one of the highest death rates for newborn babies of all California 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Under the review system, to be administered by the physician group, the 
committees would examine many or all of their area's infant and fetal deaths in 
an attempt to identify patterns, recognize causes and come up with ways of 
reducing deaths. 
</P>
<P>
As a hypothetical example, Davidson said a committee might find that a 
significant percentage of the deaths in a particular region were traceable to 
poor access to medical care. If so, physicians in that area might press to open 
up care for pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
In other areas, contributing factors might include drug use during pregnancy, 
cigarette smoking, alcohol abuse or poor nutrition. Committees may find a need 
for public education for mothers to teach them the signs of potentially fatal 
pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
"If we do perinatal death reviews and find that 90% of the deaths in one 
hospital come from women not having access to prenatal care, that will say that 
emphasis on prenatal care in that hospital should be a priority, as opposed to 
buying yet another incubator," said Rae Grad, executive director of the 
National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality. 
</P>
<P>
Infant mortality, the rate at which babies die before age 1, is seen as a 
telling measure of a country's health-care system. In the United States, 
progress in reducing the infant death rate has ground almost to a halt in 
recent years. It is now 10.1 deaths per 1,000 births, which ranks 29th among 
developed countries. 
</P>
<P>
In some cities, the rate is nearly twice the national average -- a fact that 
health officials attribute generally to shrinking access for lower-income women 
to prenatal and pediatric care as well as the spread of drug use and infectious 
diseases. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, the infant mortality rate among blacks and Latinos rose 
29% in 1988 over 1987 to a rate of 21.1, while dropping 12% to a rate of 8.8 
among Anglos. The percentage of babies born weighing less than five pounds -- a 
key predictor of mortality and disability -- rose 17% overall and 32% among 
blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"We just can't go on having this level of mortality and morbidity (illness)," 
said Dr. Gary Richwald, a professor of public health at UCLA, in an interview 
this week. "Mortality is only the leading edge of the morbidity." 
</P>
<P>
The review system is to be overseen by the college, which represents 29,000 
physicians nationwide. It will be based in Washington, D.C., and already has 
some financial and administrative support from the U.S. Department of Health 
and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
According to Davidson, a national review committee will be formed. It will 
enlist the medical community and other health professionals in the review 
process, and draw up standardized guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Within the next two years, Davidson hopes to have in place 20 local committees 
to examine infant and fetal deaths on a state and regional level. The national 
program staff will track the committees' findings and evaluate their success in 
improving local death rates. 
</P>
<P>
Funding for the national staff is coming initially from the maternal and infant 
health branch of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It is 
unclear how much the project will cost, but other physician groups have 
tentatively offered support. 
</P>
<P>
The system is modeled in part on the maternal mortality reviews begun by the 
medical community in the 1930s. Since that time, the maternal death rate has 
dropped from 636 to just seven maternal deaths per 100,000 births. 
</P>
<P>
According to Davidson, the maternal death reviews were one of many factors, 
including antibiotics and blood banking, that helped bring down the death rate. 
The reviews helped identify the major role played by infection, hemorrhage and 
toxemia in maternal death as a result of childbirth. 
</P>
<P>
Specialists in the field of infant mortality this week strongly endorsed the 
program. Some emphasized the importance of examining more than merely medical 
causes, saying social and economic factors such as poverty and race play a 
complex role in infant death. 
</P>
<P>
"These conditions make medical policy-makers anxious," said Richwald, 
commenting on why a nationwide death-review system has not been tried in the 
past. Social and economic factors are "not well defined and they potentially 
involve large budgets. And somebody's ox is going to be gored."

SAN FRANCISCO MOTEL POOL MURAL PROVES TOO COLORFUL FOR STATE LAW 
</P>

<P>
Visitors to the Phoenix Inn may think the 45-foot egg-shaped pool of water in 
the motel courtyard is a swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
It looks like a swimming pool. It's filled with water and it even has the 
telltale chlorine smell of a swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
But a sign posted beside it declares, "This Is Not a Swimming Pool. This Is 
Art." 
</P>
<P>
The confusion is all because of a piece of Pop Art on the pool bottom. 
</P>
<P>
No one is allowed to swim in the motel pool because of a state law requiring 
all pool bottoms to be painted white for safety reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Chip Conley, 29, owner of the newly refurbished Phoenix Inn, didn't know about 
that law in January when he commissioned New York artist Francis Forlenza to 
paint a mural on the pool bottom. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know what we were getting ourselves into," Conley said. "It's a good 
rule for a large public pool, but it's silly to apply this to all situations." 
</P>
<P>
Conley has enlisted the help of San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos and Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) and is hoping to get the state 
Legislature to pass a bill exempting his pool. 
</P>
<P>
The mural, titled "My Fifteen Minutes/Tumbling Waves," features white and pale 
blue 6s and 9s on a navy blue base, with dabs of yellow and red scattered 
about. The painting is dedicated to Pop Art pioneers Marcel Duchamp and Andy 
Warhol and also includes a tribute to the pop culture figure of Bob's Big Boy. 
</P>
<P>
"If either of those guys walked in here today, they would say, 'Hey, this is 
art,' " said Forlenza, who quotes Warhol's saying, "Everybody is famous for 15 
minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Conley said the mural is just right for the hip image he has brought to the 
44-room Phoenix since taking over the motel in the city's ethnically diverse, 
low-income Tenderloin district in 1987. Built in the 1950s, the motel used to 
be known as a place that offered X-rated movies and catered to prostitutes. 
Phoenix visitors now include pop stars such as Linda Ronstadt, Sinead O'Connor 
and Tracy Chapman. It displays 250 pieces by local artists with paintings in 
every room and a sculpture garden in its central courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
"You go to most hotels in America and you have really bad art on the walls," 
Conley said. 
</P>
<P>
Forlenza, who has done several murals in Long Island homes, had been working on 
the project for two months and the mural was nearly complete when he and Conley 
discovered the painted pool was in violation of state law. 
</P>
<P>
City heath officials, fearing liability if anyone is injured, will not approved 
a permit for the swimming pool. Under the law, decorative designs that might be 
mistaken for people are specifically prohibited, said Lorraine Anderson of the 
San Francisco Environmental Health Department. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not able to allow an exemption in this project," Anderson said. "There's 
not much room for negotiation on this." 
</P>
<P>
But Forlenza said his pool design looks "nothing like people." 
</P>
<P>
"They say the shapes look like people, (but) my friends don't look like Gumby," 
Forlenza said. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the city will not force Conley to paint over the mural as long as he 
calls it "art." But Forlenza and Conley envisioned the project as an 
interactive piece where viewers could literally immerse themselves in art. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they have found themselves immersed in politics. 
</P>
<P>
Conley, who has been active in the Tenderloin neighborhood surrounding the 
Phoenix, first sought help from Supervisor Terence Hallinan, a supporter of 
many small arts organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Hallinan agreed to set up a pool-side lunch with Mayor Agnos at the 
Phoenix to allow the artist to present his case. At the lunch, the mayor became 
so enamored of the pool, according to Agnos' spokesman Art Silverman, that he 
asked his driver to bring his portable phone and invited Assembly Speaker Brown 
to join them. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who happened to be driving in the neighborhood, also was impressed with 
the pool, and offered to help Conley save the artwork. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Scarlett, a legislative counsel to the Assembly Speaker, said he is looking 
into legislation to exempt the pool from state law. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the Legislature passed a similar exemption for the historic Hollywood 
Roosevelt Hotel in Los Angeles, where the pool was painted by well-known 
British artist David Hockney in a bid to revive the 63-year-old hotel's sagging 
fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
Since the luncheon, city health officials have indicated some kind of 
compromise for the Phoenix Inn might be worked out. Conley has offered to take 
extra safety measures if the city lets him keep the underwater mural, promising 
to maintain 24-hour surveillance and to cover the pool from 10 p.m. to 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Now back in New York, Forlenza is heartened that his mural might be saved but 
said he remains leery of bureaucrats. His lesson in politics has inspired his 
next project. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm planning an (art) installation on the scary influence of government on 
artists," he said by telephone Monday. "Big Brother shouldn't determine what is 
art."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS GOVERNOR;

<P>
VAN DE KAMP LAUNCHES NEW AD CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Letting loose a barrage that probably will not cease until Election Day, John 
K. Van de Kamp will launch a television advertising campaign today meant to 
reintroduce California voters to the man who has been the state's top law 
enforcement officer for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
The advertisement hits the airwaves on the heels of the Los Angeles Times Poll, 
published Sunday, which showed Dianne Feinstein 13 points ahead of the attorney 
general in their tussle for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. The poll 
contained very little good news for Van de Kamp, showing Feinstein broadening 
her base of support, appealing more to men and Southern Californians than she 
had earlier in the race. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp's ad mimics a radio commercial his campaign has been running in Los 
Angeles and other major cities. It offers biographical information on Van de 
Kamp -- his prosecutorial background and opposition to assault rifles. It bores 
in on the three initiatives that Van de Kamp has pushed as his platform and the 
opposition the initiatives have summoned. 
</P>
<P>
"He's hated by oil companies, chemical companies, the gun lobby," the 30-second 
ad says. "Measure the man by the enemies he's made." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's press secretary, Dee Dee Myers, criticized the ad as "election year 
hyperbole." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp's campaign chairwoman, Barbara Johnson, said the ad is the first in 
a series that will run through primary day, June 5. But representatives from 
the campaigns of Feinstein and Republican Pete Wilson said their research 
indicates the television buy may be more limited. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, voters across the state are likely to be deluged with 
advertisements in the closing four weeks of the campaign. Campaign sources said 
that Feinstein is expected to renew her television campaign next week, unless 
the Van de Kamp announcement forces a change in her timetable. Feinstein 
campaign officials declined to confirm when their television ads would resume. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp is attempting to sway the vast number of undecided voters -- 39% in 
the Times poll. In contrast to an earlier commercial that was critical of 
Feinstein's tenure as San Francisco mayor, the latest Van de Kamp offering does 
not even mention the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"He's resorted to the high road in desperation," said Myers. 
</P>
<P>
Kam Kuwata, a Democratic political consultant who is not involved in the 
gubernatorial race, said the ad is meant to flesh out Van de Kamp for voters 
who are still uncertain what he stands for -- other than opposition to 
Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing Van de Kamp lacks is a very strong message," Kuwata said. 
"Obviously, he's got to broaden his appeal and give people a reason to believe 
in John Van de Kamp." 
</P>
<P>
Before the two candidates had exchanged ads critical of the other, Feinstein 
had aired a well-received commercial touting her background. With that ad, 
political experts said, Feinstein gave voters a look at her that Van de Kamp 
had, until now, neglected to deliver. 
</P>
<P>
The advertisement opens with a series of pictures of Van de Kamp: the attorney 
general at his desk, in a press conference, running a meeting, conferring with 
women. 
</P>
<P>
"He's defended our environment. Sent murderers to Death Row -- 42 times. And 
banned assault rifles," the ad says. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, while Van de Kamp has supported environmental initiatives and was 
instrumental in the state ban on assault rifles, he personally did not send 
murderers to Death Row. That was done by his underlings during Van de Kamp's 
tenure as Los Angeles County district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The ad then highlights the initiatives Van de Kamp has been pushing for the 
November ballot. An initiative that would limit terms of officeholders and 
impose other ethical strictures is identified as one that would "crack down on 
political corruption." 
</P>
<P>
The environmental initiative -- called "Big Green" by its proponents -- is 
described as one that would "save the coastline, control pesticides and 
reforest California." 
</P>
<P>
The third initiative is an alternative to Proposition 115, a Wilson- and 
Feinstein-backed plan to speed up trials and make it easier for prosecutors to 
impose the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp has opposed Proposition 115 on the grounds that it would strip 
Californians of privacy protections now in the state Constitution and thus pose 
a threat to abortion rights. Van de Kamp says his version would "preserve a 
woman's right to choose." Supporters of Proposition 115 angrily deny that the 
threat is real. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp had previously described his anti-crime effort as a drug-fighting 
initiative.

BILL TO START STATE AIRLINE GETS A SURPRISING BOOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unorthodox plan to put the state of California in the business of operating 
its own passenger airline in competition with commercial air carriers took off 
on its maiden flight in the Legislature on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In a surprise action, the Senate Governmental Organization Committee, known as 
a graveyard for bills, narrowly endorsed the legislation by Sen. Art Torres 
(D-Los Angeles) and sent it to an uncertain future in the Appropriations 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would create a nonprofit corporation to run the state government's 
proposed Golden State Air. Torres said the airline would chiefly connect 
Northern and Southern California cities and provide "safe, convenient and 
affordable" airline service. 
</P>
<P>
Since the bill was introduced last winter, it has been widely scoffed at as 
having no chance of becoming law. It is generally viewed as a legislative 
needle to poke the airline industry into lowering air fares in California, 
improving schedules and expanding service. 
</P>
<P>
Defeat of the bill by the Governmental Organization Committee had been viewed 
as a foregone conclusion. The Air Transport Assn., the national trade 
organization of the airline industry, did not send a representative to testify 
at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't think we had a chance and they didn't even show up," crowed 
Torres. "That's the kind of arrogance they have for the people of California." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, no representatives of consumers testified. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Allan Wayne, an Air Transport Assn. lobbyist, said he saw no need to 
testify because his organization had sent the committee a letter raising 
questions and concerns about the substantial costs if the state created its own 
airline. One Boeing 737-300 aircraft costs $30 million, he pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the Legislature will find better purposes for the expenditure of 
limited monies than for the massive start-up costs," Wayne said, insisting that 
the industry was neither for nor against the bill. "We welcome the competition, 
if (the state) can get the financing and proper certification from the (Federal 
Aviation Administration)." 
</P>
<P>
Critics have contended that since the airline industry was deregulated by the 
federal government under the Carter and Reagan administrations, fares have 
skyrocketed, safety has deteriorated, flights are inconvenient and 
undependable, and some regions have inadequate service. 
</P>
<P>
In the Legislature, anger directed at airlines has been stewing for years, 
especially among Southern California lawmakers who commute between Sacramento 
and their home districts as often as two or three times a week. Most pay a 
discounted rate. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the state Public Utilities Commission reported that since 
deregulation, air fares in California have increased an average 40% after 
inflation.

AN ODE TO THE HOLOCAUST VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the full English text of a tribute by Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie 
Wiesel to Holocaust victims that was read Tuesday at a ceremony at the site in 
Berlin where Nazi leaders planned the "Final Solution." 
</P>
<P>
Wannsee -- a warning. 
</P>
<P>
Wannsee -- the end -- the final solution. 
</P>
<P>
The target: Jews, all Jews, everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Only Jews. 
</P>
<P>
What does a Jew today feel in this place, marked by evil and malediction? 
</P>
<P>
Fear and trembling, anger -- incommensurate anger, helplessness and grief -- 
infinite grief. 
</P>
<P>
Cry? One must not cry here! If you begin, you will not stop. 
</P>
<P>
How many tears does one shed for thousands of communities? 
</P>
<P>
How long does one lament the death of tens of thousands, of hundreds of 
thousands of innocent, abandoned, forsaken victims? 
</P>
<P>
If only the walls could speak, 
</P>
<P>
If only the trees and clouds could testify. 
</P>
<P>
We need to hear them, for most German men and women, in the past, refused to 
speak, refuse to remember. 
</P>
<P>
It is here that, in a businesslike atmosphere of banality and efficiency, 12 
German high government officials, in the name of their criminal leadership on 
behalf of their nation, condemned the entire Jewish people to death and 
oblivion: teachers and their pupils, brides and grooms, intellectuals and 
workers, rabbis and their disciples, young revolutionaries and old dreamers of 
Zion. 
</P>
<P>
All were doomed. Simply, solely as Jews. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, children were still playing in the streets of Sighet and 
Saloniki. 
</P>
<P>
Others were still begging for bread in the ghettos of Warsaw and Bialystok. 
</P>
<P>
Still others were praying for the coming of the Messiah in the hidden bunkers 
and attics of Vilna and Lublin. 
</P>
<P>
Here they were already dead and they did not know it. 
</P>
<P>
It is Jewish history that the Germans tried to annihilate here. 
</P>
<P>
It is Jewish memory that Germany tried to eradicate here, forever. 
</P>
<P>
That is what a Jew remembers in Wannsee. 
</P>
<P>
But Wannsee also means for us Jews that memory is stronger than its enemies. 
</P>
<P>
It means that Jewish hope has vanquished fear. 
</P>
<P>
It means that when we Jews visit and listen to the somber and dark echoes at 
Wannsee, we aim at preventing future generations from inheriting our past as 
their future.

U.S. OFFERS EARLIER DATE FOR STOPPING POISON GAS OUTPUT; 
</P>
<P>
CHEMICAL ARMS: BAKER HOPES TO WRAP UP DETAILS DURING TALKS IN MOSCOW NEXT WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to resolve a key impasse before the superpower summit in three 
weeks, the Bush Administration has offered to move up the date for ending 
poison gas production as part of a proposed U.S.-Soviet chemical weapons 
treaty, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A senior State Department official said Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
hopes to wrap up details of a chemical weapons pact when he visits Moscow next 
week for talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. A reply to 
the U.S. offer is expected at that time. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-Soviet poison gas agreement is thought to be much closer to completion 
than any other arms control pact now under consideration by the two countries. 
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev have made it clear 
that they want to sign at least one arms control treaty at their May 30-June 3 
summit in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Another official said the Administration is ready to compromise on its earlier 
insistence that the United States continue to produce modern chemical weapons 
until all nations capable of manufacturing war gases agree to a global ban. 
</P>
<P>
The official said the exact date for ending production remains to be 
negotiated. But non-government experts said that the Administration appears 
ready to end production either within three years or when the U.S.-Soviet 
agreement takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
The new proposal is intended to remove a Soviet objection to a plan outlined by 
Bush in a speech to the United Nations last September calling for the United 
States and the Soviet Union to begin at once to destroy most of their existing 
stockpiles of chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Bush suggested that both nations cut their arsenals to 5,000 tons. That would 
reduce the U.S. arsenal by 80% and the Soviet arsenal by about 95%. Moscow 
accepted the Bush proposal in principle but insisted on an immediate end to 
U.S. chemical weapons production. 
</P>
<P>
The United States originally wanted to continue production so that the 20% 
remaining after the cuts would consist entirely of modern binary weapons -- 
chemicals that only become deadly when combined. Such weapons are safer to 
store than the existing stocks of poison gases. 
</P>
<P>
Another potential obstacle to the chemical weapons agreement, however, is a 
Soviet schedule for destruction of its chemical weapons stocks. 
</P>
<P>
The United States could begin destruction in about a year at eight facilities. 
In contrast, Moscow has only one such facility, which is now inoperative. The 
Soviets contend that destruction at the pace proposed by the United States 
would be unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Soviet Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev denied Tuesday 
that Moscow has backtracked on earlier concessions in talks on reductions of 
long-range nuclear weapons and has jeopardized early completion of the 
strategic arms agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Akhromeyev, who is Gorbachev's chief arms control adviser, told a Senate Armed 
Services subcommittee that Moscow's position on sea-launched cruise missiles 
(SLCMs) is consistent with a statement at the U.S.-Soviet 1987 summit. The 
statement committed the two nations to establish ceilings on these weapons that 
could be verified if possible. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials believed the Soviets had moved away from that demand in 
February, however, by agreeing to deal with SLCMs by issuing "politically 
binding declarations." But last month, the Soviets returned to their demand for 
ceilings, which connote legally binding limits, and with verification 
provisions. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not backtracking," Akhromeyev insisted. "We are pushing both statements. 
We're still prepared to confirm (SLCM force size) in parallel, politically 
binding declarations. But they (the declarations) must limit deployment. If 
not, the (strategic) treaty could be bypassed with deployment of many thousands 
of SLCMs. The treaty would be nonsensical." 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon had planned to build about 4,000 long-range SLCMs, most of them 
conventionally armed but about 750 with nuclear warheads. The Soviets have 
proposed a nuclear ceiling of half that amount. 
</P>
<P>
The primary purpose of Akhromeyev's visit was to explain Moscow's longstanding 
call for new negotiations to reduce tactical nuclear arms, including cruise 
missiles, torpedoes and depth charges carried by ships and submarines at sea. 
</P>
<P>
Akhromeyev warned that these tactical nuclear arms "are less protected" against 
unauthorized use than the nuclear weapons of the other armed services "because 
of unavoidable autonomous sea patrols of every ship carrying out 
training-combat tasks." 
</P>
<P>
Akhromeyev appeared to be suggesting that because ships operate far from port 
and reliable communications, naval commanders have greater authority to use 
nuclear weapons.

EXILED LEADER'S SON SWORN AS PRESIDENT OF COSTA RICA;

CENTRAL AMERICA: HE VOWS TO LEAD THE DEMOCRATIC AWAKENING IN THE REGION AND 
TACKLE ECONOMIC WOES AT HOME.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rafael Angel Calderon, whose father's Costa Rican political career ended in 
exile, was sworn in Tuesday as president of Central America's most enduring 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Invoking his father's one-time populist ideals and briefly acknowledging the 
foreign activism and peacemaking role of his predecessor, Oscar Arias Sanchez, 
Calderon promised to tackle Costa Rica's deficit. He also pledged to help lead, 
by example, a region that until only recently has been torn by civil war and 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
"Only the combination of economic growth and social justice can immunize 
democracies against the totalitarian dangers of the extreme right and the 
extreme left," he told a capacity crowd at the 25,000-seat National Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
During his 40-minute speech, Calderon was flanked by all of Central America's 
heads of state, including Nicaragua's new president, Violeta Barrios de 
Chamorro. Most of the leaders, like Calderon, are newly elected moderate 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon said regional troubles appear to have eased and that many of the 
Central American nations have edged toward Costa Rica's century-old example of 
democratic stability. 
</P>
<P>
"Being now halfway down the road toward a better future, it is for us, the 
presidents of Central America, to assume the responsibility of leading our 
peoples into a new stage in the process, in which the great goal will no longer 
be to silence the uproar of cannon fire, but to take off at last toward 
economic development," he said. 
</P>
<P>
First Lady Barbara Bush, appearing calm and proud on her first solo venture 
abroad to represent her husband, was cheered when she led the U.S. delegation 
into the stadium. Earlier, she had delivered a letter from her husband, in 
which he pledged to work with Calderon to "bring peace, democracy and 
development to the region." 
</P>
<P>
Calderon's Feb. 4 victory ended eight years of rule by Arias' National 
Liberation Party. 
</P>
<P>
It was also the 10th consecutive election in Costa Rica since Rafael Calderon 
Guardia, president from 1940 to 1944, sparked a civil war after he tried to 
nullify the vote in his losing 1948 electoral campaign. The family was driven 
into exile in Nicaragua, where Rafael Angel Calderon, known as Junior, was 
born. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon, 41, has tried to follow in his father's footsteps almost since he 
graduated from the University of Costa Rica law school in 1972. He served in 
various government posts and lost two presidential campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
But in his most current bid, at the head of the Social Christian Unity Party, 
he had the help of Roger Ailes, President Bush's campaign wizard. Ailes 
refashioned Calderon's image from that of a hard-liner on foreign issues into 
that of a man of the people -- a reflection of his father's early political 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Ailes was part of the U.S. delegation Tuesday along with John H. Sununu, the 
President's chief of staff, and his wife, Nancy; former Puerto Rican President 
Luis Ferre, and the Bushes' son, Jeb. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon promised to reduce the $35-million deficit of Costa Rica, a country 
the size of West Virginia with a population of 2.2 million, by forcing 
"self-sacrifice." 
</P>
<P>
He said he will encourage new markets and bolster tourism but insisted he will 
keep his campaign promise to build 160,000 housing units by his term's end.

NORTH DIARIES HINT OF BUSH AID TO CONTRAS

Oliver L. North met with then-Vice President George Bush a few hours after 
lying to the House Intelligence Committee about assisting the Nicaraguan 
Contras, an entry in North's White House diaries suggests. 
</P>
<P>
Portions of the diaries, released Tuesday, renew questions about whether Bush 
was more deeply involved in assisting the Contras than he has acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,400 pages of notebook entries were obtained by a private group, the 
National Security Archive, as the result of a lawsuit filed against the 
government. U.S. intelligence agencies still are reviewing the remaining 1,200 
pages of North's diaries. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said: "The vice president's role 
in the Iran-Contra affair was completely examined in the congressional inquiry, 
and we have nothing to add." 
</P>
<P>
Among disclosures in the newly released material: 
</P>
<P>
 -- On Dec. 20, 1985, North laid out a "3rd Country Solicitation Plan" in 
support of the Contras that included trips by Bush to Honduras for an 
inauguration there. The plan also called for then-President Ronald Reagan to 
meet with Ecuador's president. 
</P>
<P>
Bush went to Honduras in January, 1986, for the inauguration of President Jose 
Azcona Hoyo and Reagan met in Washington that month with Ecuadoran President 
Leon Febres Cordero. 
</P>
<P>
There was an elaborate plan in the Reagan Administration to induce third 
countries to support the Contras, according to evidence introduced at North's 
trial last year. Bush has denied being involved in any quid pro quo 
arrangements providing additional economic and military aid to Honduras in 
exchange for allowing the Contras to use base camps there. 
</P>
<P>
 -- North's notes refer to a noon "meeting w/ V.P." on Aug. 6, 1986. That would 
have been 3 1/2 hours after North lied to the committee by denying he was 
supplying military advice to the Contras. North admitted he had lied when he 
took the witness stand at his own trial last year.

BUSH WARNED BY GOP LEAVE-BILL BACKERS; 
</P>
<P>
BENEFITS: THE PRESIDENT IS TOLD THAT A VETO WOULD BE IN CONFLICT WITH THE 
REPUBLICANS' PAST PLEDGES TO PROTECT 'FAMILY VALUES.' 
</P>

<P>
Responding to a White House veto threat, Republican supporters of a family and 
medical leave bill Tuesday warned President Bush that a veto of the legislation 
would hurt their party because of its past pledges to protect "family values." 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, which is strongly backed by the House Democratic leadership 
and a group of GOP moderates, is expected to pass the House easily today or 
Thursday but fall short of a veto-proof two-thirds majority. It then will be 
sent to the Senate, where approval appears likely. 
</P>
<P>
White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu said Monday that Bush would veto the 
bill, which is strongly opposed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other 
business groups, on grounds that it would mandate a fringe benefit -- unpaid 
leaves to deal with family emergencies, personal illness or the birth of a 
child -- that should be left to employers' discretion. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Marge Roukema (R-N.J.), however, urged the President to sign the 
legislation that she said would establish minimum standards of decency in the 
workplace. 
</P>
<P>
"This bill is about family values," Roukema said. "As a mother who cared for my 
own son when he was terminally ill with leukemia, I know the importance of this 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a defining issue for the Republican Party," she added. "The organized 
business lobby is out of step with the real world. . . . For two-thirds of 
Americans workers, this is an economic necessity." 
</P>
<P>
Her views were echoed by Rep. Curt Weldon (R-Pa.), who said the bipartisan 
compromise was designed to protect legitimate business concerns while extending 
family and medical leave to millions of American workers who need it. 
</P>
<P>
"This is right for America -- right for the Republican and Democratic parties," 
Weldon said. "This legislation is necessary in a world where so often both 
parents must work, when parents cannot afford to take off full-time to care for 
a child . . . they need to know their jobs will be waiting for them when they 
return." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Bill Green (R-N.Y.) even read from the GOP platform adopted in 1988 about 
the importance of parents in raising children in urging that Bush sign the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, originally introduced five years ago, has been bottled up in 
committee because of strong business opposition. Republican backers of the 
measure, however, said changes were made to overcome many business objections. 
The co-sponsor of the compromise, Rep. Bart Gordon (D-Tenn.), is a conservative 
Southerner who has business support. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater contributed to the debate 
with some advice for workers who cannot persuade their employers to grant them 
time off to deal with family medical crises or newborn children: "Look for 
other jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater's remark was retracted quickly. Before his briefing ended, he said: 
"I did not intend to suggest that individuals seek other employment if they 
don't have adequate parent leave. . . . Compromise means give and take, and we 
urge all employers to find sensitive and flexible leave policies, but the 
government should not dictate it." 
</P>
<P>
The top three Democrats in the House -- including Speaker Thomas S. Foley, 
Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt and Whip William H. Gray III -- also urged 
Bush to sign the bill, which Foley termed one of the most significant pieces of 
legislation in the 101st Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Under the bipartisan compromise, companies or government agencies with more 
than 50 employes would be required to grant unpaid medical or family leave for 
up to 12 weeks a year. During a leave, employers would have to continue health 
benefits and provide a job when the worker returned. 
</P>
<P>
"We're asking the President to sign this bill and stand up with the working 
families of America," said Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
"After the legislation has been passed . . . and the President has a chance to 
reflect on its importance to families and preserving the family as an 
institution . . . the President will sign the bill," added Foley, making a rare 
public statement on a bill before it came to a vote in the House.

Rep. George E. Brown Jr. (D-Colton), a congressional leader in science and 
technology policy, had a good day at the office Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Brown received a top award from the National Science Foundation. He also won 
House passage of a bill to devote $150 million to hydrogen fuel research at the 
Energy Department and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, approved by voice vote, will have to be reconciled with a similar, 
Senate-passed measure before it goes to President Bush, who is expected to sign 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Brown was the only person outside of the National Science Foundation to receive 
its 1990 Distinguished Public Service Award. He was instrumental in creating 
the Office of Technology Assessment and the Office of Science and Technology 
Policy, and the award cited his "persistent and effective efforts in support of 
science and engineering research and education."

PLAN TO AID THIRD WORLD IN CUTTING CFC USE OPPOSED BY BUSH OFFICIALS

U.S. delegates to an international conference on chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) 
have been instructed to oppose a plan supported by European governments that 
would provide $100 million to developing nations to help them reduce the use of 
the ozone-depleting chemical, informed sources said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is designed to encourage such modernizing giants as India and China to 
join a 1987 treaty calling for drastic reductions by the year 2000 of CFCs, a 
gas used widely for refrigeration, production of polystyrene and cleaning of 
computer parts. 
</P>
<P>
China and India have ambitious plans to provide their citizens with 
refrigerators and other goods that use CFCs. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William K. Reilly and top State 
Department officials recommended that the United States support the plan, which 
was developed by a working group of treaty signatories in recent months, 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
But their recommendation was overridden by White House Chief of Staff John H. 
Sununu and Office of Management and Budget Director Richard G. Darman, who 
oppose providing any additional funds outside existing programs of 
international organizations such as the World Bank, the sources said. The U.S. 
share of the fund would be $25 million over three years. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to preserve the stratospheric ozone layer that screens out harmful 
ultraviolet rays will be frustrated if the Third World does not curb its CFC 
use, scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
According to sources, the proposal, expected to be introduced today, calls for 
a $100-million fund to help Third World industries that use CFCs convert to 
alternative chemicals, cover the extra costs of alternatives and identify 
additional ways to replace CFCs.

SENATE VOTES TO LET FEDERAL AGENTS TAKE PART IN POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS

The Senate voted Tuesday to allow IRS, CIA and FBI agents to participate in 
political campaigns, rejecting Republican attempts to maintain the status quo 
established in the 51-year-old Hatch Act. 
</P>
<P>
On a 51-46 vote, the Senate rejected an amendment to exclude employees in the 
spy and tax agencies plus the Justice Department and the Federal Election 
Commission from a Democratic bill that removes most current restrictions on 
political activities by civil service and postal workers. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) was one of three 
unsuccessful attempts Tuesday by Republicans to chip away at the union-sought 
revisions in the Hatch Act. 
</P>
<P>
Dole contended that the entire bill amounts to a "pot of gold" for the 
Democratic Party because unionized public employees and their political action 
committees overwhelmingly favor Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Also defeated were GOP amendments to maintain a ban on federal workers holding 
office in the two political parties and delaying any changes in the Hatch law 
until after a campaign finance reform bill is enacted. 
</P>
<P>
Dole has hinted that Republicans might try to attach major elements of their 
proposed campaign finance reform bill -- such as a total abolition of PACs -- 
to the Hatch Act revisions later this week. 
</P>
<P>
The Hatch law now prohibits the nation's 3 million federal civil service and 
postal workers from participating actively in politics. The Democratic bill 
would lift some restrictions so that federal employees could hold party offices 
and solicit campaign funds from their co-workers, but not from the general 
public.

THE 'EAR-MAN' AND HIS MOST AMAZING SKILL; 
</P>
<P>
PRESIDENCY: AMERICA'S FORTUNE, WHEN THE WORLD IS GOING THROUGH AN UPHEAVAL, IS 
TO HAVE BUSH AS ITS NEGOTIATOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID S. BRODER, David S. Broder is a syndicated columnist in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the antic American presidential selection system, almost nothing tests a 
candidate's skills as a negotiator. The emphasis is all on trial by combat -- 
in the primaries against members of the same party, then in high-stakes debates 
against the opposing nominee in the general election. The unstated assumption 
seems to be that politics is a form of warfare, in which toughness and 
durability, the capacity to sustain blows and inflict injury, are the vital 
qualities. 
</P>
<P>
It truly is fortunate, then, to have a President with George Bush's negotiating 
skills. The testimony on this point -- from members of Congress and foreign 
officials -- is nearly unanimous. They find Bush well-briefed, engaged and 
self-confident enough to be flexible. He is described by associates as an 
ear-man, rather than an eye-man, one who prefers conversation on a topic to a 
set of memos or position papers. He governs by talking to people, face to face 
or over the phone. And he likes to deal. 
</P>
<P>
His own ego needs are well under control. He encourages those with whom he 
negotiates to advance their own ideas and gives them room to maneuver. Told as 
a youth that it is bad form to brag and inconsiderate to make others feel 
uncomfortable, Bush prides himself on his ability to build personal 
relationships. One difficult NATO leader has been converted into a reasonably 
strong supporter of U.S. policy by Bush's repeated acknowledgment of this man's 
erudition and intellect. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush is more than an artful flatterer, a convivial locker-room or 
cocktail-party pal. His real gift, those who deal with him say, is his capacity 
to "see the other guy's needs." He understands and respects the reasons why 
others at the table take the positions they do. 
</P>
<P>
By conveying that understanding, he was able to defuse a rather nasty 
London-Bonn feud at the NATO summit a year ago, where he made his international 
debut as President. At that Brussels meeting, Bush managed to line up both 
Great Britain and West Germany behind an American initiative for sweeping 
conventional arms cuts in Europe. That NATO offer, as it turned out, gave 
Gorbachev the assurance that he needed to let the Warsaw Pact countries break 
away late last year without fear of Soviet tanks. 
</P>
<P>
None of this guarantees success for the upcoming negotiations on the budget or 
on arms control. The policy problems in both are daunting. Nor is negotiating 
skill an adequate substitute for public rhetoric when it comes to leading a 
democracy. In a representative government like ours, the voters need to hear 
goals and strategies debated, not just bear mute witness to a leader's tactical 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, it is an advantage -- and something of a miracle -- to have a 
President who is a skilled negotiator, especially at a time when the government 
is divided and the world is going through an enormous upheaval. And Bush does 
have that skill.

Trump's army says the issue is cost. The fact is that there are no inexpensive 
sites for new schools in Los Angeles. When the Los Angeles Unified School 
District goes looking for land in the city, the typical price tag is $2 million 
to $3 million an acre. The 23.5-acre Ambassador site was on the market for five 
years before it sold for about $64 million in 1989. The land's current value -- 
about $73 million -- is what it would cost to buy a decent high-school site 
anywhere in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if building a new high school required the destruction of large 
numbers of homes and apartments, the district would have to pay relocation 
payments to displaced residents. This cost would offset any savings from a less 
expensive site. Actually, of the more than 45 sites considered for the new high 
school, the Ambassador site is below average in cost. 
</P>
<P>
Land cost could be further reduced by mixing commercial and school uses. The 
district is willing to allow commercial development on the Wilshire Boulevard 
end of the Ambassador site. The school would face 7th Street or 8th Street. The 
site could also accommodate such needed city services as a branch library or a 
police substation. The school district has always been willing to try out this 
approach to siting the school, but Trump Wilshire has turned us down cold. 
</P>
<P>
Every school day, 4,500 high-school students are bused from the area that would 
be served by the new high school. These students are on the road up to two 
hours a day, or 360 hours a school year. They need a school in their 
neighborhood; they have a right to have one. They should not have to spend the 
equivalent of 15 weeks of school time on a bus every year. A new school must be 
built for these Hispanic, Asian and African American students, just as the 
district built new schools in the San Fernando Valley when overcrowding there 
reached a crisis point 20 to 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
It is primarily the state's responsibility to pay for new schools. A 
seven-member board -- the State Allocation Board -- sets the rules and 
procedures for districts to receive money to build schools. The L.A. district 
has followed the rules. It did an exhaustive study of potential sites, selected 
one and received the approval of the State Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
The district has plenty of "priority points," which are based on the degree of 
overcrowding in the schools. At present, the state is allocating money for 
construction projects with 150 or more priority points. The mid-Wilshire 
Ambassador site has 341 such points, more than twice the total required for 
state funding. 
</P>
<P>
Thus the district is puzzled why there is any controversy about its 
application. When a project before the State Allocation Board met all the 
state's criteria, it has always been funded -- until now. When a local district 
settled on a site, the state has provided the money to buy the land and asked 
no questions -- until now. Why have the rules changed in the middle of the 
game? 
</P>
<P>
The battle over the Ambassador site is not about Donald Trump, though its 
current owners probably like the glossy jet-set image he brings to their 
project. It is about land use; it is about where children fall on this 
society's priority list. Some have said that the Ambassador real estate is too 
prime for a school. Some have said that if a community needs revitalizing, the 
last thing it would want is a high school. Still others say "those" students 
shouldn't expect to have a sports field and a gym like students on the West 
Side and in the Valley. Some even say that a high school in the neighborhood 
would lead to more drug use, crime and graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
What all these folks seem to be saying is that our society would be better off 
without children. I don't believe that is a majority view in Los Angeles. The 
education of our children is central to revitalizing not just the mid-Wilshire 
area but our entire city. 
</P>
<P>
The district will succeed in its attempt to build a high school on the 
Ambassador site. It is feasible. It is cost-effective. Most important, it meets 
the needs of the students who live in the neighborhood.

CHEEKS A BLAST FROM THE PAST FOR KNICKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
On a team that counted youth among its foremost assets, the oldest player 
exerted the greatest influence. For a team that revolved around a premier big 
man, the smallest athlete controlled the destiny. To a team that had suffered a 
generation of heartache at Boston Garden, the latest arrival brought a winning 
prescription. 
</P>
<P>
Maurice Cheeks is 33, old enough to start for the Boston Celtics. The New York 
Knickerbockers generously list his playing weight at 180 pounds but the man is 
as spare as a rib. When a reporter suggested Sunday that he was a physical 
marvel, he laughed. "Look at me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, look at him. Look at him closely. Because in the person of the point guard 
on whom any uniform other than No. 1 would appear to be an overstatement, the 
Knicks found the inspiration not only to lift the Celtics' yoke of oppression 
but to vanquish the demons from the old arena on Causeway Street. 
</P>
<P>
Cheeks performed an exorcism Sunday. There was a belief that Knick General 
Manager Al Bianchi sacrificed a piece of the future when he acquired the 
veteran from the San Antonio Spurs Feb. 21 in exchange for Rod Strickland. But, 
in overcoming the club's recent past in its least favorite building, he 
provided the Knicks with a present. It began Tuesday night at the Palace in 
Auburn Hills, Mich., home of the Detroit Pistons, the National Basketball 
Association's defending champions. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond his 21 points (including 17 in the second half), seven assists and two 
steals in the Knicks' landmark 121-114 triumph Sunday, one statistic underlines 
the impact of Cheeks in the climactic fifth game of the first-round playoff 
series. Under minutes played, the number was 48. Coach Stu Jackson would not, 
could not remove him at any point from the most significant game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"For a guy to be in the league for 12 years and play all 48 minutes," teammate 
Trent Tucker said, "it's just a credit to Maurice Cheeks. I've been around 
eight years but this is the first time I've had Maurice on my team. We were 
blessed to have him." 
</P>
<P>
All season long the Knicks talked about establishing a half-court game, an 
offense that would thrive in the playoffs where the good teams contest every 
possession. But the plan was more fantasy than reality until Cheeks unpacked 
his gym bag in New York. The man brought the directions to the system with him. 
He became a coach on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Understand, it did not happen overnight. In fact, the Knicks appeared to be 
fighting the conversion in the final two months as they prepared for the 
playoffs. Certainly, there was no appreciable development in the first two 
games here, the second of which was a humiliating 157-128 blowout and the 
team's 26th consecutive loss on the old parquet floor. 
</P>
<P>
The transformation took place at Madison Square Garden with the Knicks one 
defeat from an ignominious exit. It occurred, assistant coach Paul Silas said, 
"just in the last couple of games. In the first game we won in New York, it 
wasn't as obvious. But in the second game, you could see it all coming 
together. The guys understood their roles, they were playing within themselves, 
not doing things they were incapable of doing. And then in this game, when we 
needed someone to come up big, (Cheeks) said, 'Guys, I'm going to show you what 
this is all about.' " 
</P>
<P>
Well, Cheeks did not actually use those words. In fact, he used no words at 
all. Silas was interpreting Cheeks' actions. "Mo doesn't talk much," Tucker 
said. "He's a quiet guy. He leads by example." 
</P>
<P>
After the first half, in which the Knicks were thankful to trail by only four 
points, Cheeks decided it was time. "We weren't playing bad," he said, "but we 
were kind of stagnant. I needed to be more aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
So he looked to penetrate, repeatedly beating Dennis Johnson or John Bagley off 
the dribble and creating either a layup or an opening for a teammate. In the 
final 24 minutes, he took six shots from the field and made them all. He added 
five-of-six free throws, four assists and one steal and made the Knicks believe 
they would win a playoff game here for the first time since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
"He was flawless today," said Tucker, whose three-pointer early in the fourth 
period broke a 97-97 tie and staked the team to its final lead. "He's been 
there so many times. Mo knows the situation. He doesn't feel the pressure. He's 
in control." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it was because he came from a different organization that Cheeks was 
fearless in the face of the Knicks' tradition here. He played the point for the 
Philadelphia 76ers in 1983 when they beat the Celtics at the Garden in the 
seventh game of the Eastern Conference finals en route to the NBA title. The 
arena held no terror for him. Otherwise, he would not have brought along little 
Maurice, 2, for the experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a lot of good games and bad games in the Garden," he said. 
"Fortunately, most of the good games I've had have been in the playoffs or in 
big games." 
</P>
<P>
Don't think for a minute that is coincidental. 
</P>
<P>
In a game that came down to a test of execution and patience over the final 
quarter, precisely the kind of situation that favored the experienced Celtics, 
Cheeks directed his teammates with the skill of a symphony conductor. On the 
occasion of one timeout, when the younger Knicks were tempted to celebrate, 
Coach Stu Jackson advised Cheeks, "Calm them down out there." They remained 
focused until the final seconds. 
</P>
<P>
If there was a single exchange that encapsulated the flow of this game, that 
demonstrated to everyone deliverance was at hand, it took place with 4:16 left. 
Larry Bird, the heart and soul of the Celtics, hit the rim with a reverse slam 
attempt, the Knicks rushed downcourt and Cheeks sank an 18-foot jumper to boost 
the lead to 105-99. Following a basket by Reggie Lewis, Cheeks scored his last 
field goal and three-pointers by Johnny Newman and Ewing (a prayer from the 
corner) sealed the victory. 
</P>
<P>
While his teammates celebrated their advance to the conference semifinals, 
Cheeks slipped out of the dressing room and walked up to the end promenade to 
greet his son. Little Maurice had a Knicks pin on his red jacket and a face 
full of red lollipop. "You're good luck," the father said. "You're coming to 
Detroit." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the Knicks are going to Motown, courtesy of Cheeks. And then, next 
weekend, the Pistons will be coming to Mo-town, where the understated veteran 
has made a home for himself.

SHOW LOSES TO PIRATES; EXPECTS TO BE TRADED 
</P>

PITTSBURGH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Padre pitcher Eric Show sees it in their faces. He senses it in their actions. 
He listens to the insinuations. 
</P>
<P>
The man who has won more games than any pitcher in Padre history, the man who 
has been with this organization longer than anyone in the front office or on 
the playing field, and the man who was racked once again in the Padres' 10-2 
defeat to the Pittsburgh Pirates, Show is convinced he's going to be traded. 
</P>
<P>
"I think my name's always been in trade talks, but especially now," Show said. 
"That's all right, they're not going to hurt my feelings. I don't expect 
loyalty. There's no loyalty in baseball, anyway. They traded Babe Ruth, didn't 
they? 
</P>
<P>
"I never deluded myself that I was wanted because of who I am. I was wanted 
because I produced. We're only commodities to be dispersed of, and anyone with 
any brains at all should know that. 
</P>
<P>
"There's really not a whole lot to say. I don't need to bury myself." 
</P>
<P>
No one in the Padre organization is willing to say anything publicly right now, 
and the subject carefully is being avoided by Padre Manager Jack McKeon, but 
the word on the street already is out. 
</P>
<P>
The scouts that were littered among the 10,694 fans at Three Rivers Stadium, 
watching the Pittsburgh Pirates beat up on the Padres (12-14) for the fifth 
consecutive time certainly weren't there to watch Shawn Abner perform as a 
pinch-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
They came to see Show, but the notebooks and speed guns were quickly put away. 
Show lasted just 1 1/3 innings, yielding five hits and four earned runs to the 
11 batters he faced. He has pitched just 21 2/3 innings in five starts this 
season for a 6.23 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in his nine-year career, he is 0-4. 
</P>
<P>
"We all know he's on the trading block," said a Cleveland Indians scout, who 
spoke only on the condition of anonymity. "We need another starter, and we know 
they're looking for some insurance at shortstop. I think they're going to deal 
a starter, but it's just a question of which one." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres have not talked specifics with any club, but they have invited 
everyone to come take a good look. Show is the pitcher most available, but 
clubs also are scouting starter Dennis Rasmussen and reliever Calvin Schiraldi, 
who also is capable of starting. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres are willing to deal one of their starters for the simple reason that 
they want to make room for Mike Dunne, who's on rehabilitation assignment at 
their triple-A Las Vegas club. Dunne, who underwent arthroscopic shoulder 
surgery in November, pitched a no-hitter in his last outing, is expected to 
make three more starts for Las Vegas before being called up May 22. 
</P>
<P>
If no trade is made, Dunne likely will replace outfielder Jerald Clark on the 
roster, leaving McKeon the decision of who will be yanked out of the rotation. 
But the Padres certainly don't need an 11-man pitching staff, simply because 
after Tuesday's defeat, they won't have to face the Pirates again until July. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres have been humbled by the Pirates in every game they've played this 
season, outscored 37-11 in the five games, while becoming the first Padre team 
in history to lose each of its first five games to the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
It's been painful. Take a look, if you've got a strong stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Padres have never led at the end of the 43 innings played against the 
Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Pirates have smacked the Padre pitching staff around for a .341 batting 
average and a monstrous .604 slugging percentage, collecting 10 homers, 12 
doubles and three triples. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pirate center fielder Barry Bonds is batting .600 (12 for 20) against the 
Padres, with three homers, nine RBIs and nine runs scored. Yes, Bonds has 
produced more runs in his 20 at-bats than the Padres have scored as a team in 
their 166 at-bats against the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
What's a team to do? 
</P>
<P>
"The way they were hitting," Padre center fielder Fred Lynn said, "we needed 
about five outfielders out there." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Padres could have used a couple more infielders, particularly 
during Show's stint. The Pirates obtained only three singles out of the infield 
off Show, but a mental lapse by him cost him two runs in the first, and he 
never had a chance to get untracked in the second. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres scored two runs in the top of the first inning off Walt Terrell, who 
was traded by the Padres last year, but failed to retain the lead for even an 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
Wally Backman, who's hitting .625 (10 for 16) against the Padres this season, 
opened the inning with an infield single to shortstop. Backman took second on 
Jay Bell's groundout, and Show then induced another ground ball to Andy Van 
Slyke down the first-base line. Joe Carter, playing deep behind the first-base 
bag, grabbed the ball cleanly and looked to feed the ball to Show. He wasn't 
there. Show had forgotten to cover first. Van Slyke kept running and beat 
Carter to the bag. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Show appeared to regain his composure, striking out cleanup hitter Bobby 
Bonilla while Van Slyke stole second. With first base open, Show elected to 
pitch to Bonds. He threw two pitches past Bonds, but on a 2-2 pitch, Bonds 
slapped a fastball up the middle, scoring two runs. 
</P>
<P>
It was two runs that never should have scored if it wasn't for Show's blunder, 
and although four Padre pitchers failed to shut down the Pirates, it was Show's 
play that most upset McKeon. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're pitching 10, 12 years, but if you can't cover first base and help 
yourself," McKeon said, "you're not going to be around long. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't be a spectator. You've got to be in the game. Pitchers have to bunt, 
they have to use the bat, they have to field the position. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't do that, you'll be a loser." 
</P>
<P>
It was a performance that Show didn't even bother discussing with McKeon and 
pitching Coach Pat Dobson. When Dobson came to the mound to get him, Show was 
already on his way to the dugout, flipping the ball to him without the two 
exchanging a word. 
</P>
<P>
Show and Dobson have been irritated with one another because of an incident 
last week when Show criticized Dobson for not telling him that he would be 
passed over for a start in the rotation because of two off-days. Dobson 
insisted that he did inform Show earlier in the week, saying that Show even 
consented because of his reluctance to pitch at Wrigley Field since the July, 
1987 beaning of Cub outfielder Andre Dawson. 
</P>
<P>
Show's 11-day wait resulted in a 34-pitch performance, spending 1 1/3 innings 
on the field, and the remainder of the game in the clubhouse, wondering what 
has gone wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm shocked at what's happened, absolutely shocked," Show said. "I can't say 
I'm not trying, but then again, I'm not producing either. I'm just not pitching 
like I should. 
</P>
<P>
"I might have pitched good enough to win three games if I was with the Oakland 
A's or something," Show said. "But I'm not. And I'm the one to blame. Who else 
is there? 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I can do is regroup. At least I haven't lost my confidence. And 
I feel perfectly healthy. I just have to be patient." 
</P>
<P>
But, of course, it's the Padres' prerogative if they want to reciprocate. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Padre reliever Mark Grant and pitching Coach Pat Dobson each telephoned former 
Padre Mark Davis of Kansas City, trying to bolster his confidence. Davis, who 
signed a four-year, $13 million free agent contract with the Royals, already 
has blown three saves this year and owns a 7.11 ERA. "He'll be all right," 
Grant said. "Actually, he was helping me out as much as I was helping him. He 
told me to forget the past, and be the aggressive pitcher I've always been." . 
. . Although the Padres have had to make two position changes to adjust for 
first baseman Jack Clark's absence, center fielder Fred Lynn and first baseman 
Joe Carter said they feel right at home. Lynn, who had been a center fielder 
for most of his 15-year career until last year, said he actually feels more 
comfortable in center, despite being 38 years old. "This is great for me," Lynn 
said. "I feel like a fish in water in center." Although Carter started just 11 
games at first base last year, he was the Indians' everyday first baseman in 
1987. "Either way is fine by me," Carter said. "I feel just as comfortable at 
first base as the outfield." . . . Center fielder Alex Cole of the Padres' 
triple-A club in Las Vegas has been moved to right field to make room for 
Charlie Hillemann. Hillemann replaced outfielder Thomas Howard on the roster. 
Howard underwent arthroscopic knee surgery last week and is not expected to 
return until mid-June.

DAVE DISTEL: BREEZE, BEATHARD REFRESH CHARGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dave Distel 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Monday afternoon. First full day of the Chargers' mini-camp. Sun beating down 
on Mission Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Uncomfortable? 
</P>
<P>
Hardly. A breeze wafting from the ocean kept the air fresh and warm rather than 
hot and stifling. 
</P>
<P>
How appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers' little corner of Mission Valley has been awash in fresh air 
lately. This is literally and figuratively the springtime of The Bobby Beathard 
Era as general manager. Attitudes are so upbeat that even front office veterans 
are openly talking of Beathard's arrival being this organization's version of 
glasnost. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL itself is a suspicious place populated by suspicious people, and the 
Charger front office was just a microcosm of the whole. For all intents and 
purposes, it might as well have been surrounded by a moat and barbed wire. The 
Charger offices always reminded you of what the Pentagon must be like. 
</P>
<P>
An example, I suppose, would be the press relations office, which, of 
necessity, is frequented by the media. When the Charger offices were remodeled 
a few years ago, this was moved outside the main offices, presumably to keep 
the untrustworthy denizens of the media from having unescorted access to the 
inner sanctum. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't to say that the Chargers have thrown everything wide open. You can't 
exactly step into Beathard's office and ask him if he would like to buy a box 
of Campfire Girls matches. But people in the Charger organization are more 
relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
At this Monday afternoon practice, in fact, Beathard was there in a pull-over 
shirt, shorts and running shoes sans socks. This is a man without pretense. 
With the exception of a certain basketball coach, guys who call themselves 
Bobby rather than Robert or Bob can hardly be accused of pomposity. 
</P>
<P>
When Beathard learned that a writer wanted to visit with him, he trotted across 
the practice field and extended his hand in a greeting. I was used to Charger 
front office types sending the messenger back to find out exactly what it was I 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
I asked him about attitudinal changes in the organization, and he seemed 
perplexed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough for me to tell," he said, "because I don't know what it was like. 
If attitude has changed for the better, that's good. But it's nothing I can 
consciously say I came in here and wanted to change." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Bobby Beathard will be measured by what he is consciously trying to 
change, and that is the fortune of the team itself. He comes to an organization 
that has had two winning seasons in the past eight, both either 
strike-interrupted or strike-tainted. 
</P>
<P>
More than coincidentally, attitude is also playing a role in terms of his 
personnel changes. People who rock the boat are being thrown overboard. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone seen Jim McMahon lately? 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't a fit. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone seen Gary Anderson lately? 
</P>
<P>
He might have been a fit, but there was the matter of this contractual impasse 
of more than a year's duration. 
</P>
<P>
"I met Gary, and I liked him," Beathard said, "but it was an impossible 
situation. Rather than let it drag on, I wanted to go and do positive things." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson is gone. 
</P>
<P>
And so are others, though Beathard chose to leave them nameless. On this day, 
Beathard was more interested in looking ahead at a team he felt was going in 
the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
"I also know areas where we have to get better," he said. "We'll either get 
there by the guys who are here improving or by making trades later." 
</P>
<P>
Beathard is candid enough to identify troubled areas, even though they are not 
exactly deep secrets to anyone with a passing knowledge of this team's recent 
history. One is obviously at cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a good chance that we'll go through the season with what we have now," 
he said. "You go around the league and look at the cornerback situation, and it 
doesn't seem like there's enough of them to go around. Everyone's reluctant to 
trade them." 
</P>
<P>
This was a Charger general manager explaining exactly what he would like to do 
even though he didn't know if he could do it. This team's fans will know where 
this man stands. 
</P>
<P>
No one, of course, can predict where the Chargers will stand when spring and 
summer are gone and fall arrives. It was 6-10 a year ago, last in the AFC West. 
The future being fantasy, it is not out of the question to suggest that the 
Chargers have playoff potential. 
</P>
<P>
"You never know," Beathard said. "You start off winning, and everyone plays 
better. You have to get an attitude where you play up to your potential. Most 
teams have to play over their heads to make the playoffs, and you have to play 
over your heads when you get there. You have to get the right guys who have 
football as their No. 1 priority." 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Beathard used the word attitude only once in that paragraph, but it was 
an unspoken part of every sentence. 
</P>
<P>
His protest that he was not consciously preaching changes in attitude may have 
been correct in that changes subconsciously -- or quietly -- attained may be 
deeper and more lasting. Should the Chargers take the AFC by storm this year, 
it will be because of a gentle breeze.

NEW DODGERS FORCED TO FACE AN OLD FUTILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

MONTREAL 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This Dodger clubhouse of new faces and attitudes was rudely visited by an old 
acquaintance Tuesday night: anger. 
</P>
<P>
In a scene reminiscent of last summer, heads were down and words were sharp 
after a 9-1 loss to Montreal before 12,599 at Olympic Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it was the total of five Dodger errors in the seventh and eighth innings, 
two short of the team record for a game. Maybe it was a poor performance by 
pitcher Tim Belcher, who gave up Tim Wallach's first two-home run game since 
May 4, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it was the five hits by the Dodgers against two young pitchers whose 
names they still might not recognize. 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe it was that they had not played so badly since last season, when some 
thought they could not possibly play that badly again. 
</P>
<P>
"A terrible night," Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said. "A terrible, terrible 
night. This is the first bad ballgame we have played the entire season." 
</P>
<P>
Two days before, the Dodger bullpen had given up eight runs in two innings in a 
9-5 loss to Philadelphia. You know this game was bad. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers' two-game losing streak equals their longest of the season. And the 
six-game gap between them and the National League West Division-leading 
Cincinnati Reds is the widest of the season thus far. 
</P>
<P>
"We did everything wrong that we could possibly do," Lasorda said. "I'm 
disappointed. Very disappointed. Very upset. The only good thing I can say is, 
nobody really got hurt." 
</P>
<P>
He almost couldn't say that. Eddie Murray was hit in the left eye with a ball 
during batting practice. After Murray fouled the ball off the top of the 
batting cage, it hit the dirt and bounced back into the eye. 
</P>
<P>
Murray was immediately taken to the trainers' room, where he applied ice to the 
eye. He decided his vision was too blurry for him to start, but he pinch-hit in 
the ninth inning, keeping alive his consecutive games streak at 386. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God, because it could have been a lot worse," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
Worse for Murray, but not for the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
With Murray's offense missing as Brian Traxler replaced him at first base, the 
offense could not touch Bill Sampen, making his first major league start. 
</P>
<P>
Sampen was a last-minute replacement for Oil Can Boyd. Boyd was scratched 
because of numbness in the middle finger of his right hand that brought to mind 
last year's blood clots suffered by Boyd while with Boston. 
</P>
<P>
But the Dodgers made sure Boyd was not missed, as Sampen gave up only one 
unearned run on four hits in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think in my wildest dreams that I would ever get a win like this," 
Sampen said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither did the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I'm swinging, my wife could get me out," said Juan Samuel, who struck 
out three times for the fifth time this season. "That guy, he didn't have 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Said Willie Randolph: "A young pitcher like that might have an advantage 
because none of us have ever seen him before. . . . But we've got to do more. 
We have got to get more things together." 
</P>
<P>
Sampen was followed by a relief pitcher with two years of infrequent success in 
the big leagues, Drew Hall, who gave up one hit in four scoreless innings for 
the save. 
</P>
<P>
Hall and Sampen made Belcher look like the rookie. After holding the Expos 
scoreless in the first inning, Belcher gave up five runs on seven hits before 
leaving after giving up three consecutive hits to start the sixth inning. 
Wallach hit a leadoff homer in the second and a two-run homer in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Belcher has two complete-game victories this season, but has not lasted past 
the sixth inning in each subsequent game. In his last four starts, he is 1-3 
with 5.27 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
"To call what I threw tonight a 'fastball' is an overstatement," Belcher said. 
"Just call it a straight ball. The pitches to Wallach on the home runs were 
right down the middle. I have got to be more consistent." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodger defense was fairly consistent before Tuesday, with 17 errors in 26 
games. But Samuel, errorless in center field before Tuesday, dropped a fly ball 
for one error and misplayed the ball while backing up a wild throw to second 
base from catcher Mike Scioscia for another error. Scioscia's throw, which 
bounced off Tim Raines' helmet and allowed him to score from first base on a 
steal attempt, was also an error. Two more errors came on a botched double-play 
grounder featuring wild throws from Randolph and Alfredo Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers were treated to a pleasant surprise when Jay Howell, two weeks 
after arthroscopic surgery on his left knee, pitched off a mound for 15 
minutes. Howell said he didn't put full pressure on the knee, but his pitches 
had catcher Rick Dempsey cheering. "Remember, I didn't hurt my arm," said 
Howell, who added that the knee felt better than before the surgery. "I was 
still tentative with it, I wasn't jumping down on it," Howell said. "But I know 
it felt better than when I was pitching with it sore." Tuesday's workout does 
not ensure that Howell will be ready to come off the disabled list as scheduled 
May 16, but it probably won't take much longer. "If I'm not comfortable out 
there, I'm not going to rush it just to get my brains beat in," Howell said. "I 
want to get so I'm not coming off the mound making excuses." When reminded that 
he made no excuses for the sore knee before the surgery, Howell said, "Well, I 
don't want to have to lie about anything, then. If I get beat, I want to be 
able to just say that I'm healthy, and I stunk." 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson circled the bases twice, but he is still running at less than full 
speed. . . . Despite claims by the Dodgers that Orel Hershiser has been feeling 
better since shoulder surgery April 27, Hershiser has not been available for 
comment since then. Initially Hershiser was suffering from a post-operation 
flu. Tim Belcher talked to Hershiser by phone last weekend and said he was in a 
good frame of mind.

MORNING BRIEFING: ABSTINENCE WON'T MAKE ITALIAN HEARTS FONDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Azeglio Vicini, coach of the Italian national soccer team, probably didn't 
endear himself to his players this week when he asked them not to engage in sex 
until the World Cup tournament in Italy ends on July 8. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend will be the last at liberty for the players before a long period 
of "seclusion," Vicini said, adding: "Chastity of players prior (to) and during 
a major competition has been a long-debated but unsolved problem." 
</P>
<P>
A Cup title for Brazil would enliven the debate. 
</P>
<P>
The Brazilians have been told by their coaches that they will be free to make 
love during the tournament, which starts June 8, but must refrain from drinking 
Italian coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: In five seasons in the NBA, how many three-point shots had Patrick 
Ewing made before last Sunday, when he sank a three-pointer in the last two 
minutes of the New York Knicks' 121-114 victory over the Boston Celtics? 
</P>
<P>
Wouldn't gold be more appropriate?: An Illinois company will issue a 
limited-edition silver commemorative coin honoring quarterback Joe Montana of 
the San Francisco 49ers as pro football's player of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very happy to honor Joe Montana as the player of the decade," said John 
Obie, president of Chicagoland Processing Corp. of Elk Grove Village, Ill., 
which will sell the coins for $29.95, plus $3 shipping and handling. "Joe was 
clearly head and shoulders above his NFL competition during the 1980s." 
</P>
<P>
And now, heads and tails. 
</P>
<P>
Blowing smoke?: UCLA's football recruiting classes were ranked among the 
nation's top 10 throughout the latter half of the 1980s, but Coach Terry 
Donahue, lamenting last season's 3-7-1 record, told the Tacoma Morning News 
Tribune: "We've made some mistakes in recruiting, in evaluating, and everywhere 
else -- let's face it, we just didn't get some guys." 
</P>
<P>
Said Chris Allen, defensive coordinator at USC: "During the spring, we had an 
official work some of our scrimmages, and he'd also worked spring practices at 
UCLA and Washington. And he told me that the talent looked to him like it was 
Washington, UCLA and us . . . in that order." 
</P>
<P>
Wild night: It was 25 years ago that John Havlicek of the Boston Celtics made 
one of the most famous steals in NBA history, intercepting an inbounds pass to 
preserve a 110-109 playoff victory over the Philadelphia 76ers and prompting 
play-by-play announcer Johnny Most's hysterical scream: "Havlicek stole the 
ball!" 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, as fans at Boston Garden celebrated the Celtics' ninth consecutive 
Eastern Division championship, Havlicek's jersey was ripped off him, leaving 
rope-like burns across his chest. By the time he reached the locker room, his 
pants were gone, too. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, Havlicek told the Hartford Courant, a woman introduced herself 
to him at a party. Pointing to a piece of cloth she had pinned to her dress, 
she asked if he recognized it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a piece of your jersey the night you stole the ball," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: One, in 26 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Keri Phebus, a sophomore at Corona del Mar High, Laker fan and 
winner of the 18s title last weekend in the Seventeen Magazine Tennis 
Tournament of Champions at Mission Viejo: "Steffi Graf says her goal is to play 
perfectly. My goal is to play tennis like Magic plays basketball."

FRANCE'S ALCOHOL LEVEL ABOVE LIMIT; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: FORMER RAM'S BLOOD TESTED AT .13. CHARGES WILL BE SOUGHT IN AUTO CRASH 
THAT KILLED A LAGUNA HILLS WOMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Former Ram offensive lineman Doug France had a blood-alcohol level of at least 
.13 -- well above the legal limit of .08 -- when he was involved in a two-car 
crash that killed a Laguna Hills woman, the California Highway Patrol said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Ken Daily said additional tests conducted by CHP's skid-speed experts 
revealed that France was driving his 1987 BMW at a minimum speed of 81 m.p.h. 
when it rammed head-on into a car driven by Maria Conception Contreras. 
Contreras, 53, was killed in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
The posted speed limit on winding Aliso Hills Drive, where the accident 
occurred Saturday, is 45 m.p.h., said Daily, who added that samples of France's 
blood were taken three hours after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP will use the results of the blood-alcohol tests to recommend to the 
Orange County District Attorney's office that France be charged with felony 
manslaughter and felony drunken driving. Daily said the charges might be filed 
by early next week. 
</P>
<P>
France was listed in serious condition with a concussion and a broken pelvis at 
the Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Walker, one of France's friends, said Tuesday that the two-time all-pro 
was driving to his townhome in the Crestline complex when he struck Contreras' 
1989 Mazda 323. France had "a few drinks" while he watched the NBA playoffs at 
a friend's home, Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
France and Contreras were neighbors at Crestline, located on Aliso Hills Drive. 
France, who owns an office supply company in Irvine, lives with his wife and 
two sons. 
</P>
<P>
Contreras' 22-year-old daughter, Grasie, said her mother had left home on an 
errand before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a really kind person," Contreras said. "She touched the lives of many 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Contreras said neither she nor her sister, Angie, 29, had been contacted by 
France's family since the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Contreras said she and her sister were not bitter about the accident, although 
her mother's death may force them to sell their townhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"We rely on God," she said, noting that her mother was a devout Jehovah's 
Witness. "We know that there's going to be justice."

Thumbs up to Jim and Sally Harrick, who are donating $75,000 to the UCLA 
Athletics Campaign to endow a scholarship for the men's basketball program. Now 
that's loyalty. . . .

Jose Canseco set his sights too low when he talked about a 50-50 home

Baseball might be the national pastime, but why do high school and college

<P>
Frank Viola is trying to join Gaylord Perry as a Cy Young Award winner in both

One more for the Carlton Fisk Has Played More Games for the White Sox Than for 
the Red Sox file: Ernie Banks played more games at first base than at 
shortstop. . . .

The surprising thing about the Cincinnati Reds' success is that they're 
achieving it without much of a contribution from Eric Davis, who was hitting 
.186 before being placed on the disabled list. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Raul Perez, the World Boxing Council bantamweight champion who stands 5 feet 11 
and cannot weigh more than 118 pounds for title fights, is taller than former

every name in the book when he fought Pinklon Thomas. Then I'm walking Pinklon

think he's going to kill me. Instead, he says, 'Mr. Dundee, I just want to say, 
Hi.' " . . .

Dundee on George Foreman: "He's gotten so glib that he reminds me of Archie 
Moore. Except he smiles more than Archie." . . .

Hana Mandlikova, now rated 26th in the world among women tennis players, is one 
of the more disappointing athletes of the century. . . .

pressure on a 14-year-old. . . .

MELVIN DURSLAG: MODERN SCIENCE CAN'T WIN THE ARMS RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Melvin Durslag 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The prominent orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Anthony Daly, a medical chief of the 1984 
Olympics and former adviser to the IOC, likes to tell the story of the ailing 
pitcher who visits the hemisphere's foremost specialist in arm trauma. 
</P>
<P>
"Soak the arm in hot water," the specialist recommends. 
</P>
<P>
The pitcher answers: "My cleaning woman said to use ice." 
</P>
<P>
The specialist responds: "My cleaning woman told me hot water." 
</P>
<P>
The point involved here, amid the growing incidence of arm malfunctions in the 
majors, is whether medical science, for all its advancement, can understand the 
problem, much less prevent it. 
</P>
<P>
Once trouble surfaces, corrections are made surgically with swiftness and 
skillful precision. Today's surgery is a marvel of study and technology. 
</P>
<P>
But guys walking down Broadway, purporting to know how to avoid injuries and 
prolong careers, draw a suspicious look. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, from the Center for Sports Conditioning in Boston comes the 
announcement that it has put together, with the medical director of the Red 
Sox, an hourlong video promising to help pitchers sidestep injuries. 
</P>
<P>
On the tape, Dennis Eckersley is enlisted to demonstrate "34 flexibility, 
strength and aerobic conditioning exercises for the shoulder, elbow, forearm, 
wrist, trunk and lower body." 
</P>
<P>
And each exercise, we are informed, "addresses a specific element of the 
windup, cocking, acceleration, or deceleration phases of the pitching motion." 
</P>
<P>
In the scientific orbit in which we move today, countless other ideas are 
tendered to preserve the pitching appendage and to keep the entertainers 
generally fit, but they still flame out at about the rate, and for the same 
reasons, predecessors did years ago. 
</P>
<P>
And today's pitcher starts only every fifth day, and, in an age dedicated to 
the bullpen, it is abnormal when he finishes. 
</P>
<P>
Cy Young, Ed Walsh, Walter Johnson -- they pitched outrageous numbers of 
innings. So did Warren Spahn. Walsh lasted 13 years, Young and Johnson 21 each, 
Spahn 23. 
</P>
<P>
Their only concept of conditioning was to watch what they ate and get some 
sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Pitchers are running today. They are taking low groin stretches and performing 
aerobics. They are fastening tire tubes to iron bars and pulling them in 
various directions to strengthen the rotator cuff. 
</P>
<P>
They are lifting weights, pumping the indoor bike, getting ultrasound treatment 
and chiropractic manipulations. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Storm Davis undertook the Jane Fonda Workout, forgetting that 
Jane never has won 20. 
</P>
<P>
Pitchers also are icing the arm, as they would a fine Chardonnay. 
</P>
<P>
But the injuries roll up. Whole staffs are all but decimated. And then you see 
Jimmy Key bow out, followed by Orel Hershiser and Rick Sutcliffe, not to 
mention others. Faithful conditioners, all. 
</P>
<P>
At age 45, Phil Niekro won 16 games for the Yankees. Regularly, Phil went 
bowling, rated poison to the pitching arm. His conditioning program 
approximated that of Satchel Paige, who advanced the thought that a man sitting 
down is honoring a debt to his body. 
</P>
<P>
Niekro explained to us one day: "A lot of pitchers say to themselves, 'I must 
do something today to make me a better pitcher tomorrow.' I don't subscribe to 
that. I take the position that if you're feeling good today, let well enough 
alone. Don't do something that could foul you up tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Navigating clear of training rooms, he rejected ice after he pitched, deducing 
logically, "The ice numbs the arm so that you don't know how it feels. The only 
way you can get a reading is to throw and let the arm alone. It then will tell 
you what kind of shape it's in." 
</P>
<P>
Pitchers today even ascribe science to conditioning mentally, falling into 
silence the day they work, dramatizing the concentration required for the 
mission ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Niekro always laughed at this. "The time to start concentrating," he said, "is 
when you get to the mound. Nothing can happen before that." 
</P>
<P>
The whole concept today of conditioning, physical and mental, is suspect, 
mainly because some pitchers last, and others don't, exactly as they did 
before. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser was a paragon of clean living, devoted to modern training. He ate his 
chicken and his fish. 
</P>
<P>
And, as an accomplished starter, he took his turn at standard intervals, no 
beast of burden. 
</P>
<P>
When he goes down, at 31, the cynic wants to tell baseball to take its science 
and place it in the receptacle. 
</P>

A lawsuit filed by a former Drake basketball player charging the university

"Obviously, we are disappointed and dismayed," university spokesman Alan 
Cubbage said.

An attorney for the former player, Terrell Jackson, filed the lawsuit Monday,

<TEXT>
<P>
The Big Ten or the Big Twelve? 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia has talked with conference officials about joining the Big Ten, 
should it decide to expand its membership, according to Mountaineer Athletic 
Director Ed Pastilong. 
</P>
<P>
The Big Ten presidents have already invited Penn State to join, although that 
situation reportedly has grown shaky because of opposition from some members. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there has been speculation that if Penn State gets in, the conference 
will add a 12th member. 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia is independent in football and an Atlantic 10 Conference member 
in basketball and several other sports.

HIGH SCHOOL VOLLEYBALL PLAYOFFS; 
</P>
<P>
CHATSWORTH OPENS WITH EASY WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Chatsworth High boys' volleyball team is ranked No. 1 in the City Section 
after winning the West Valley League title this season. And it took only 55 
minutes Tuesday to show Gardena why the Chancellors have earned the honor. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the strong hitting of senior outside hitter Ryan Labovitch and junior 
middle blocker Gene Urcan, Chatsworth overpowered Gardena, 15-5, 15-9, 15-1, in 
the first round of the 4-A Division playoffs at Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
"They have some great players," Gardena Coach Marshall Jones said. "They really 
impressed me with the most polished offense I've seen from a high school team 
this season." 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth (13-1), the defending 4-A champion, played a near-perfect passing 
game and served almost flawlessly, misfiring once. 
</P>
<P>
Gardena had problems early with missed kill attempts and inconsistent passing. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first game we were really nervous, a little jitterish," Jones said. 
"But in the middle of the second game we realized that if we pulled our passing 
together, we could play with them." 
</P>
<P>
In the second game, the Chancellors faltered slightly after taking a 9-0 lead. 
Inconsistent setting forced six sideouts. 
</P>
<P>
Gardena (7-8), seeded 16th, scored eight consecutive points to cut the deficit 
to 9-8 with help from John Won (three kills in the game) and Scott Ikegami 
(nine assists). 
</P>
<P>
"I think our enthusiasm dropped a little in that game," Labovitch said. "We 
played down to their level and we can't do that." 
</P>
<P>
But the Chancellors took a 5-1 lead in the third game before scoring 10 
unanswered points. 
</P>
<P>
From the begining, the Mohicans had problems hitting over Chatsworth blockers. 
On average, Urcan (seven kills, eight blocks) and Craig Hewitt held a 5 
1/2-inch height advantage and had 10 more blocks than their Gardena 
counterparts (14-4). 
</P>
<P>
Hewitt finished the match with six blocks and five kills. Junior setter Dan 
Choi had 13 assists, Labovitch had nine kills and Scott Yager had nine assists. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't surprised by the outcome of the game," Chatsworth Coach Steve West 
said. "We went in ready to play hard. I expect to win (the City Section title) 
again. NAOMI TWARD

HEART AND SOUL; 
</P>
<P>
TAFT'S CODY HEIN GIVES VOLLEYBALL HIS ALL DESPITE THE HANDICAP OF AN ARTIFICIAL 
AORTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NAOMI TWARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During a closely contested volleyball match, Taft High's Cody Hein slid across 
the court, diving to keep the ball alive. As he fell chest-first to the floor, 
he launched the ball with one fist and braced himself with the other hand. 
</P>
<P>
"Careful, Cody!" a teammate yelled. "Take it easy." 
</P>
<P>
Easy, however, has never been Hein's style. The Taft senior has undergone three 
heart surgeries, but he makes few concessions to his partially artificial 
heart, maintaining a relentless and rollicking pace. 
</P>
<P>
His teammates simply call him "The Heart Man." 
</P>
<P>
Just a few months after his birth, Hein's condition was diagnosed as a 
coarctation of the aorta. By the time he was 14, the aortic valve (the main 
channel through which blood is filtered into the body) was so constricted, it 
needed to be replaced with a prosthesis. And although Hein remains active, his 
ailment is serious, said Hein's cardiologist, Dr. Burton Fink. 
</P>
<P>
"He's functioning normally, but in a sense he's not like everyone else," Fink 
said. "Part of his heart is prosthetic and that isn't normal." 
</P>
<P>
Hein's first operation at age 3 was to remove excess tissue from the heart that 
caused a blockage in the aorta. When he was 7, he had the same operation. And 
when he was 14, his heart was developed enough so that a prosthesis could be 
implanted. 
</P>
<P>
Hein could face more surgery because his heart is still growing and might 
require a larger valve. 
</P>
<P>
Because Hein is restricted from playing contact sports, he turned to volleyball 
on the advice of his brother Curtis when he was in seventh grade. 
</P>
<P>
"I came home from (junior high) one day really depressed about my heart," Hein 
said. "I couldn't play this, I couldn't play that, all these restrictions. 
Curtis pulled me aside and said, 'I think I have a sport for you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hein's doctors permit him to play volleyball as long as he sits out when he is 
tired and refrains from diving onto his chest. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we were going to have to modify our defense because (Cody can't 
dive)," Coach Doug Magorien said. "But he's found ways of getting around that 
by rolling or by bracing himself. He's done a really good job of adapting to it 
and not letting it affect his game. 
</P>
<P>
Taft (13-1) defeated Carson in three games in a first-round 4-A playoff match 
Tuesday. Hein had a team-leading 10 kills. 
</P>
<P>
"For lack of a better analogy, he is the heart and soul of our team," Magorien 
said. "The team looks up to him for his experience and his knowledge of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that concerns me about Cody is that I have to watch him because 
he doesn't like to tell me when he's real tired. Sometimes some of the other 
players will come up ands say, 'Hey, I think Cody's feeling a little bit 
tired.' He's got a lot of pride, he doesn't want to be taken out." 
</P>
<P>
Hein has started on Taft's varsity since his sophomore season. He averages 12 
kills and 32 assists a match and led the Toreadors to the North Valley League 
and Palisades tournament titles. 
</P>
<P>
"People can jump higher, run faster, they can last longer, I have to work 
myself harder," Hein said. "But I try to do that in everything I do. Even in 
things where I am equal, I try to work harder because it leads to more 
success." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his restrictions, the 5-11, 160-pound Hein rarely asks to be taken out. 
He is a setter-outside hitter who plays each position aggressively and 
intelligently. His movements are fluid, his strength apparent. 
</P>
<P>
"My teammates have been great, they realize it's harder for me. When they see 
me dive for a ball and I dive differently and miss, they encourage me," Hein 
said. "They know that when we run lines in practice I can only do one set and 
they have to do three. "Occasionally, when I'm tired, they'll say, 'Hey, how's 
the ticker doing?' But they have been great just treating me as a regular 
volleyball player." 
</P>
<P>
He was not impacted by the death of Loyola Marymount basketball star Hank 
Gathers, who collapsed on the court in March because of a congenital heart 
ailment. Hein was deeply sympathetic, but he realized that Gathers died while 
playing the sport he loved. 
</P>
<P>
"It's scary in the sense that I have a higher risk of collapsing than (other 
players), but it hasn't affected me," Hein said. " I feel strong playing sports 
right now. I don't get wheezy, and as long as I feel strong, I'm going to keep 
going. 
</P>
<P>
"I live and breathe sports, I need to play sports to keep myself going." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Hein was vividly reminded of his own mortality after Dorsey High 
football player Kevin Copeland suffered a heart attack and died on the playing 
field last October. 
</P>
<P>
Copeland wasn't aware that he had the hereditary heart ailment that took his 
father's life 15 years earlier. Coincidentally, Hein's father, Mel Hein Jr. 
competed in meets against Ron Copeland, a sprinter-hurdler at UCLA, when Hein 
was a pole vaulter at USC in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a sense of fright," Hein said, "in knowing that I have more serious a 
problem than some of the players who have died randomly while playing sports. 
Maybe not Hank Gathers, but Kevin Copeland. He didn't have any problems (that 
he was aware of) at all." 
</P>
<P>
As a tribute to Copeland, whom Hein had never met, Hein wears athletic shoes 
bearing the inscription "R.I.P. Kevin Copeland." 
</P>
<P>
But he doesn't dwell on his ailment. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't shy away from questions regarding his heart but prefers to be 
recognized as a good athlete. Not an athlete with a handicap. 
</P>
<P>
"If people didn't know Cody they would never know that he has a problem," 
teammate Adam Friedman said. "He certainly doesn't play like he has a problem. 
He never gives up, he never says I'm too tired and he never wants to come out." 
</P>
<P>
It is no surprise that Hein is sports-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
His grandfather, Mel Hein Sr., was among the first 15 inductees into the 
National Football League Hall of Fame. He played center for the New York Giants 
for 15 years and didn't miss a game. Cody's father set the world record in the 
pole vault in 1965 while at USC and he is currently the track and field coach 
at Taft. One brother, Gary, is on the U. S. National Rugby team, and Curtis is 
graduating this year from USC, where he played football on scholarship the past 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
Hein would prefer to play football, but he understands that it is not possible. 
It remains his favorite sport to watch. 
</P>
<P>
"Football is my first love," Hein said. "I always had dreams to play, and 
seeing my brothers excel made me want to play." 
</P>
<P>
The Hein family views his participation in sports as nothing out of the 
ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd play touch football so that Cody could play too," Gary Hein said. "It 
didn't bother me, I always thought it was great that he wanted to play." 
</P>
<P>
But for now Hein is satisfied to be playing volleyball and is looking forward 
to playing on the club team at Cal, which he will attend in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"There will always be that, 'If only I could play five minutes of football,' " 
he said. "But I'm lucky just to play volleyball. I wouldn't change a thing."

KENNEDY TAKES OVER 1ST PLACE IN NORTH VALLEY LEAGUE RACE; 
</P>
<P>
PREP BASEBALL: GOLDEN COUGARS FORCE SAN FERNANDO INTO SHOWDOWN FOR TITLE 
THURSDAY WITH 4-3 WIN. 
</P>

Yet again, art imitates life. 
</P>
<P>
A few moments after Kennedy High had knocked off San Fernando on Tuesday, the 
long-awaited Kennedy team program was finally circulated among the ballplayers. 
It set off a spirited scramble as each player elbowed past teammates, grabbed a 
copy and flipped through, page by page, in search of his toothy mug shot. 
</P>
<P>
The program cover features a pile of Kennedy baseball players crawling over one 
another as they scramble up a flagpole after a pennant emblazoned with "Champs" 
in capital letters. 
</P>
<P>
With its 4-3 win at Kennedy, the Golden Cougars (16-8, 11-5 in league play) 
kept alive their quest for a North Valley League title. The victory sets up a 
winner-take-all showdown Thursday in the regular-season finale at San Fernando. 
Momentum in the league race -- San Fernando (15-6-2, 10-5-1) held a 1 1/2-game 
lead over Kennedy last week -- might have switched. 
</P>
<P>
"I pitched pretty good and I still didn't beat them," San Fernando right-hander 
John Najar said. "I'm starting to wonder what it takes to beat them. It seems 
like they've got our number right now." 
</P>
<P>
Najar threw a five-hitter, struck out 11 and walked three but was outgunned by 
Kennedy senior Denny Sharp. 
</P>
<P>
"He was throwing hard," said Sharp, a curve-throwing left-hander who allowed 
five hits and struck out nine. "I'm not sure how we beat him." 
</P>
<P>
Had it been left up to Najar's arm, or even his bat, Kennedy might have been 
blanked. But it came down to Najar's glove: Two Kennedy rallies were keyed by 
liners that Najar could have flagged but didn't. 
</P>
<P>
In the first, Jason Rosen -- who has six hits in his past seven at-bats -- sent 
a grounder through Najar's legs and into center. Rosen scored on Troy Bourne's 
double, and, one out later, Bourne scored on an infield out by Lazaro Campos. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy took a 3-0 lead in the fourth when Ben Guzman drilled a two-out single 
off Najar's glove, driving in Garret Anderson from third. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I had it in my glove," Najar said. "Then I turned to throw to first 
and it wasn't there. That one killed me." 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando wasn't dead, though, banging out three of its five hits in the top 
of the fifth to tie the score, 3-3. With runners at second and third and one 
out, pinch-hitter Alfredo Hernandez singled to center, driving in Octavio 
Serrano and sending Fernando Ortega to third. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Sanchez's anything-but-routine sacrifice fly to Anderson in center 
scored Serrano -- and set off a chain reaction. Anderson's throw to the infield 
was not cut off and Hernandez, who tagged up at first, beat catcher Campos' 
throw to second. David Rojas cashed in Hernandez with a bloop single to right. 
</P>
<P>
"A real bleeder," Rojas said. 
</P>
<P>
Himself bloodied, Sharp (7-4) retired six of the next seven and hoped the 
offense could scratch out a fourth run. It did, without so much as a scratch 
single. 
</P>
<P>
Campos led off the sixth with a walk and was replaced by pinch-runner James 
Bernas, who took second on a passed ball and third on a wild pitch. Guzman sent 
a one-out roller to shortstop Luis Rodriguez, whose throw home beat Bernas' 
headfirst dive, but catcher Jess Ceniceros dropped the ball for an error while 
attempting a backhanded sweep tag. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarado, who bolted toward home plate from the dugout as the throw came home, 
was close enough to tag the plate himself when the umpire screamed "saaafe." 
</P>
<P>
"You don't see too much grass there," Alvarado said as he pointed to the 
stretch of ground between the Kennedy dugout and home plate. "I'm up and down 
that line all the time." 
</P>
<P>
And Kennedy, which has had its ups and downs as a team, is now in a position to 
steal a league title. Three weeks ago, the team was mired in a tailspin after 
having lost six of seven, but Alvarado says the winning edge is back. Tuesday's 
victory was a refresher course.

<P>
COLLEGE TRACK: GLENDALE HURDLER MARTY BECK HAD A DISASTROUS DEBUT LAST SEASON, 
BUT THIS YEAR HE IS UNBEATEN. 
</P>

<P>
Marty Beck never ran hurdles in high school. 
</P>
<P>
And after his debut in the 400-meter intermediate hurdles as a Glendale College 
freshman last season, it seemed likely that he would never run them again. 
</P>
<P>
"I had never done any hurdles in my life," Beck said. "After that first race, I 
swore that I would never do it again. I had no form whatsoever. I wasn't scared 
as much as I was stressed out. It was tiring and I bruised my knee. 
</P>
<P>
"I hated it." 
</P>
<P>
Beck's lack of finesse during that race in December, 1988, at an all-comers 
meet at UCLA made a big impression on Glendale hurdles coach Jon Gold. 
</P>
<P>
"It was absolutely amazing that he was able to finish the race without wiping 
out," Gold recalled. "His arms were flailing all over the place. After each 
hurdle it looked like he was about to tip over, but somehow each time he 
regained his balance. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he knew what he was getting into." 
</P>
<P>
He knows now. Beck has learned his lessons and used his talents so well that no 
hurdler has been able to defeat him this season, and he has been named the 
Western State Conference Track Athlete of the Year. He will take part in the 
Southern California finals Saturday with designs on a berth in the state track 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
Beck, 20, came to Glendale on the advice of his father, who was familiar with 
the track program's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale has won 14 conference titles in the past 16 years and has posted a 
dual-meet record of 143-2, including 123 victories in a row, during that span. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, as a junior at Clayton Valley High in Concord, Beck was the Northern 
Coast Section champion in the long jump and advanced to the state meet with a 
best of 22 feet 11 inches. He also ran the 100 meters in 10.5 seconds and the 
200 in 21.7. 
</P>
<P>
"I originally planned on doing the sprints and long jump (at Glendale)," Beck 
said, "but for some reason they decided to put me in the intermediate hurdles." 
</P>
<P>
Gold had a reason. 
</P>
<P>
"Marty was a 100 and 200 sprinter, but had run the 400 before," Gold said of 
the 6-foot-2, 175-pound Beck. "We already had six or seven guys in the 200 and 
400 and we needed help in the hurdles. He was the new kid on the block so he 
kind of got forced into it." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Beck's pronounced dislike for the event, in which a contestant must 
contend with 10 three-foot-high hurdles spaced 35 meters apart around the 
400-meter track, he continued with Gold's wishes. Progress followed. 
</P>
<P>
"He hated it, but he didn't seem to argue too much," Gold said. "He was 
receptive and willing to try it. We just kept on working on it and little by 
little, he just started to take off." 
</P>
<P>
Beck won the WSC meet last season and then surprised even himself by placing 
third in the Southern California finals in 52.82. 
</P>
<P>
"When I won the conference, I figured I could make it to Southern California 
finals," Beck said, "but I never thought that I would make it past there." 
</P>
<P>
In the state meet, Beck's inexperience was evident. 
</P>
<P>
Starting in Lane 9, the farthest outside lane, for the first time and unable to 
see any of his opponents, Beck bolted to a 10-meter lead by the midway point, 
but then faded badly. 
</P>
<P>
He finished last in 55.33, more than four seconds behind the winner and almost 
two seconds behind eighth place. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really upset about it," Beck said. "It was terrible. I was nervous and 
went out really hard for the first 200. I didn't know whether to bust out or go 
with them. I chose the former and then everybody got me." 
</P>
<P>
Beck has learned his lesson well. This season he has gone undefeated against 
junior college, four-year college and open competition. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been incredible running in all these invitationals," said Beck, who has 
won invitational meets at USC and Cal State Northridge this season. "It's been 
really mind-boggling. I haven't had anyone to run with. I keep running and 
there is no one to push me." 
</P>
<P>
Beck can expect some fast company when he competes Saturday in the Southern 
California finals at Cerritos College. He will compete in the intermediates and 
run on Glendale's 1,600-meter relay team. 
</P>
<P>
The top four in each event will advance to the state meet, May 19 at Santa 
Barbara City College, along with the fastest fifth-place finisher from either 
the Southern or Northern California finals. 
</P>
<P>
Beck won his heat of the intermediates in the Southern California preliminaries 
last Saturday in 53.52 to advance to the finals with the No. 3 mark. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we were just trying to get him around the track," Gold said. "In 
the intermediates, you can get away with bad form if you have the speed to run 
in between the hurdles. But if you want to run at a high level, you've got to 
have good form. If you compare Marty this year to last year, there's no 
comparison. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like watching two completely different hurdlers." 
</P>
<P>
Beck showed his good side two weeks ago in the WSC finals in Bakersfield, 
winning the intermediates in a personal-best 51.84, more than a half-second off 
his previous best of 52.35 set earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
He was named the WSC's top track athlete and finished more than three seconds 
ahead of the second-place finisher, breaking a meet record that had stood since 
1975. 
</P>
<P>
Beck also placed second in the 400 meters in 47.59 and then anchored Glendale's 
1,600-meter relay team to a third-place finish with a 46.2 leg. 
</P>
<P>
Although recruited primarily for the long jump, in which he leaped 24-1, Beck, 
who has orally committed to UCLA, has gained most notoriety in the hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the impression I've gotten," Beck said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still not comfortable running the hurdles and still don't like it too 
much. I'm still not used to running around the track with something to jump 
over, but I'm really excited (to run at UCLA). It's a dream come true." 
</P>
<P>
Said CSUN Coach Don Strametz: "I think he can really help UCLA. He has a real 
good future in the intermediate hurdles and they really need him there. He has 
also has the ability to run in a combination of events." 
</P>
<P>
Since Bob Larsen became UCLA coach in 1985, the Bruins have gone 46-0-1. In 
addition, UCLA has won three consecutive Pacific 10 Conference championships 
and NCAA titles two out of the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
But Beck has another hurdle this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be state champion," he said. "I think that I've put everything else 
on the back burner. I can do it. I've got to put all the pieces together and 
run my own race."

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
DAWSON PUTS CUBS BACK IN SWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tendency at Wrigley Field, especially when the wind is blowing out, is to 
overswing. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Dawson, who has a chronic back problem, can't afford that. 
</P>
<P>
So the Cubs' 35-year-old right fielder resisted temptation Tuesday afternoon 
with gusts of 25-m.p.h. blowing out. 
</P>
<P>
The result was Dawson's home run into the center-field seats to tie the score 
in the ninth inning, then a two-run blast in almost the same place with one out 
in the 11th to help give the Cubs a 10-8 victory over the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried not to pull the ball and just hit it right down the middle," Dawson 
told the Associated Press. "I had to remember to stay back on the ball. They 
have been throwing me a lot of off-speed pitches, and I've been fouling them 
back." 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs were in a mood to celebrate after ending a three-game losing streak 
with only their fourth win in 12 home games. After blowing a four-run lead and 
losing Monday night, they wasted a 5-0 margin before storming back in this one. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Braves hit three home runs, and the wind turned some routine fly 
balls into adventures. 
</P>
<P>
The luck of Tom Glavine, the top left-hander of the Braves, continued to be 
poor. An error by right fielder Dale Murphy helped the Cubs score five unearned 
runs in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
But the Braves, who scored only 12 runs in his previous five starts, fought 
back to take a 7-6 lead in the eighth. Then the bullpen couldn't hold it. 
</P>
<P>
"The way we've been struggling lately, I thought we were in the seventh game of 
the World Series when Andre hit the one in the 11th," Cub Manager Don Zimmer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 10, San Diego 2 -- After taking over first place during a recent 
13-game trip, the Pirates finally are playing better at home. 
</P>
<P>
Mike LaValliere and Andy Van Slyke each hit a home run and drove in three runs 
when the Pirates defeated the Padres for their fourth victory in a row at 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Terrell, signed as a free agent last winter, gave up two runs in the 
first, but the Pirates' 16-hit attack and four double plays gave him his first 
victory as a Pirate. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Show (0-4) failed to make it through the second inning, giving up four 
runs and five hits. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Bonds, a .600 hitter against the Padres, singled in two runs to tie it in 
the first. Van Slyke is batting .563 against the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates, with an 18-8 record, lead the Eastern Division by 3 1/2 games over 
Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
New York 4, San Francisco 1 -- The Giants, desperate for effective pitching, 
started Rick Reuschel, who will be 41 next week, at New York with only three 
days' rest. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran right-hander was doing very well until, with two out in the seventh 
inning, he walked Kevin McReynolds with the bases loaded to break a 1-1 tie. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets scored two more in the eighth to win their fourth in a row. The Mets 
are beginning to play good ball, but they aren't gaining on the surprising 
Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Mitchell hit a 430-foot home run in the fourth inning for the Giants' 
run. It was the seventh home run for Mitchell, who led the majors in home runs 
last season with 47. Saturday in Montreal, he hit a 462-foot home run. 
</P>
<P>
Sid Fernandez (2-3) gave up only three hits other than Mitchell's homer in 
seven innings, and John Franco picked up his seventh save. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 3, Philadelphia 2 -- Rafael Ramirez doubled home the winning run in the 
10th inning at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Yelding opened the extra inning with a single to right and stole second. 
Ramirez lined the ball over the head of left fielder Randy Ready and Yelding 
scored without a play. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies missed several opportunities to win it. In the seventh, Astro 
right fielder Glenn Wilson threw out Curt Ford at the plate to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
In the 10th, Ready tried to score the go-ahead run but missed home plate and 
was tagged out. DAN HAFNER

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
FIELDER HOMERS, TIGERS LOSE AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Detroit Tigers, desperately in need of a right-handed power hitter after 
winning only 59 games last season, lured Cecil Fielder back from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder, who spent parts of four seasons with Toronto, hit 38 home runs in 106 
games. The Tigers are paying him $3 million for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Although Fielder appears to be earning his pay, the Tigers are still losing 
most of the time. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder improved his major league leads to 12 home runs and 28 runs batted in 
Tuesday night at Milwaukee, but the Tigers lost to Milwaukee, 7-5. The Tigers 
have won only nine of 28 games. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Deer and Paul Molitor hit home runs, and the Brewers (16-8) increased their 
lead in the East to two games. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder's home run in the second inning gave the Tigers a short-lived lead. 
</P>
<P>
"The year I spent in Japan was awesome," Fielder said. "I didn't have to press 
like I did when I was with the Blue Jays and being platooned. I knew I would be 
there no matter what. I'm a relaxed player now." 
</P>
<P>
Manager Sparky Anderson expects Fielder to hit at least 30 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
"He does have confidence after that year at Japan," Anderson said. "The way he 
hits the ball to right-center, they can't hold him under 30. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to strike out a lot. One thing I like about him is that he'll keep 
swinging. He doesn't let strikeouts bother him." 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 10, Texas 5 -- Nolan Ryan went into this game at Arlington, Tex., 
with a 4-1 record, and American League hitters were batting only .150 against 
him. But Gerald Perry's first grand slam led to the earliest departure by the 
43-year-old right-hander in five years. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan retired only two batters. He gave up three hits, six runs and walked four. 
In his previous outing, Ryan gave up five runs in the first inning. Before that 
he won his first four starts. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the best I warmed up all year, but I couldn't throw my fastball for 
strikes," Ryan said. "It's disappointing not to do your job." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan still needs six victories for 300 in his career. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals' Mark Gubicza ended a four-game losing streak, giving up four runs 
in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 5, New York 0 -- The Athletics, after winning the World Series last 
year, really didn't need much. But when Storm Davis signed as a free agent with 
Kansas City, management decided another starting pitcher was needed. 
</P>
<P>
They picked up Scott Sanderson, a 33-year-old right-hander who became a free 
agent after an 11-9 record with the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
Sanderson improved his record to 4-1 with a strong performance at Oakland. He 
gave up six hits in 6 1/3 innings, and Gene Nelson retired the last eight 
batters to get his second save. 
</P>
<P>
Mark McGwire, who had been hitless in 18 at-bats, singled in two runs in the 
first inning and the Athletics went on to improve their record to 20-6 with 
their eighth victory in nine games. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees are 2-11 against right-handers. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 4, Toronto 1 -- Ron Kittle hit two home runs, and relief pitcher Bobby 
Thigpen worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the eighth inning at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
John Cerutti retired the first two Chicago batters on two pitches. But he 
walked the next batter and Kittle hit a home run. The White Sox have outscored 
their opponents, 25-2, in the first inning of their 23 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays loaded the bases in the eighth and Thigpen took over. He struck 
out pinch-hitter Junior Felix and John Olerud and disposed of Rance Mulliniks 
on a fly ball. Thigpen breezed through the ninth for his seventh save. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 6, Cleveland 5 -- Gary Gaetti singled home the tiebreaking run in the 
seventh inning at Minneapolis after the Twins overcame a five-run deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Juan Berenguer (2-0) held the Indians hitless for 3 2/3 innings and 
Rick Aguilera pitched a perfect ninth for his sixth save. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 2, Boston 1 -- Harold Reynolds doubled home the winning run with one 
out in the ninth inning at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Swift (2-0) pitched two scoreless innings for the victory.

ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: PICTURES TELL STORY OF ORLANDO STREAK; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: NOTRE DAME SECOND BASEMAN GOES SIX FOR SIX AFTER STUDYING OLD PHOTOS 
OF HIMSELF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a flash, Vinnie Orlando of Notre Dame High has transformed himself from a 
still life to a moving picture. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando, a junior second baseman, recently developed a solution to his batting 
problems. Part of the credit, he insists, belongs to a shutterbug, a parent of 
one of his teammates, who captured him in action during a hot streak last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando noticed that the sequence of photos, which were taken during a 
12-for-13 hitting barrage, showed him shifting his bat behind his head before 
the pitcher's delivery. Actually, he was bouncing his bat off his shoulder 
blade a few times to loosen his hands and prepare for the pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through this season Orlando was batting below .250. Two weeks ago, 
frustrated with his limited output, he revived the tapping motion. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the picture and said, 'Hey, maybe that will work again,' " Orlando said. 
"You get a rhythm going. It's just so I can get comfortable and get ready." 
</P>
<P>
It seems a rather picayune adjustment, but since Orlando's been tapping, he's 
been rapping. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando tied a Southern Section record for most hits in a game last week 
against Harvard with six -- three singles, two doubles and a home run. Indeed, 
Orlando pounded three two-run homers last week. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Orlando was 10 for 14 with 10 runs batted in as Notre Dame beat Palos 
Verdes, Harvard, La Salle and Alemany. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball just looked like a basketball up there," Orlando said after his 
six-for-six outing. "I wasn't trying to get hits, I was just trying to put the 
ball hard somewhere and if they fall, they fall." 
</P>
<P>
Since he started tapping, Orlando is 13 for 19 and has raised his average to 
.372. He has driven in 22 runs and stolen 19 of 20 bases this season. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time we faced him, it looked like he was trying to pull the ball," 
said Alemany Coach Jim Ozella, whose team fell, 9-5, on Saturday and 
surrendered two hits to Orlando. "This time he was trying to use the whole 
field. He'll be a lot more successful that way." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Orlando pines to swing. 
</P>
<P>
"He just wants to be up there," Notre Dame Coach Bob Mandeville said. "Instead 
of warming up before a game he's just kinda standing there holding that bat. 
</P>
<P>
"He's capable of hitting like this all the time. He's just relaxing, that's the 
key."

SINGULAR EFFORT OF MAYE CHANGES ROYAL'S FORTUNES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite a losing reputation and a first-year coach who is a one-man show, Royal 
High (15-9, 7-4) has clinched second place in the Marmonte League and qualified 
for the Southern Section playoffs for the first time since 1978, only the 
fourth time overall. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came here I didn't know any names and just held tryouts," Dan Maye 
said. "But we didn't consider it a rebuilding year and set a goal of finishing 
third or fourth." 
</P>
<P>
Maye, 28, inherited a 12-17 team that was sixth in the league last year and has 
directed the team without the benefit of an assistant on the varsity for much 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
His brother, Steve, traded his duties as pitching coach to play for the Salinas 
Spurs Class-A team in the California League. Maye's father, Frank, coaches the 
junior varsity, which plays its games at the same time as the varsity. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids have accepted it pretty well," Dan Maye said. "The hardest obstacle 
was that our kids have been told they're losers, that they've never made the 
playoffs and that they can't win." 
</P>
<P>
Top teams: One of the week's more interesting matchups has no bearing on a 
league race or a playoff berth. But today's Agoura-Westlake game is more than 
just another nonleague contest. 
</P>
<P>
Although the teams are concentrating on the playoffs, it's unlikely that they 
will look past each other. Besides the rivalry engendered by proximity, the 
schools will be league opponents in the fall when Agoura leaves the Frontier 
League for the Marmonte. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura (14-8, 9-0) has won 12 of its past 13 games, clinched its second 
consecutive Frontier League title, and the Chargers want to finish the league 
season unbeaten. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Gary Gray said he will use his top pitchers for the league games, but his 
options remain open. Staff ace Bob Kazmirski, who has accepted a scholarship to 
Fresno State, pitched two innings in Agoura's 4-3 win over Santa Ynez on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Joey Medaglia, a senior left-hander, is the probable starter against Westlake, 
although Kazmirski and right-hander Brian Smith are also ready to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"More than likely all three of those young men will pitch against Westlake," 
Gray said. Agoura would love to beat the Warriors, who are 24-1 and ranked No. 
1 in the Southern Section 5-A Division.

Westlake already has concluded a 12-0 Marmonte season, winning the school's 
first league title in baseball. Westlake Coach Rich Herrera said he won't use 
ace Mike Eby, a senior left-hander with a 9-0 record. Instead, the Warriors 
will start junior right-hander Donnie Hill. 
</P>
<P>
"Pitching-wise, we're going to try to work everybody," Herrera said. "But we're 
going with the same lineup as always and we'll try to win the ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
Streak talk: Simi Valley Coach Mike Scyphers' streak of winning seasons might 
have ended. Scyphers has coached 20 seasons, including 12 at Simi Valley, 
without finishing under .500. 
</P>
<P>
The Pioneers are 11-12 with one Marmonte League game remaining, today at 
Camarillo. "I hardly ever bring that personal-type thing up, whether it's my 
200th win or whatever," Scyphers said. "But I have some pride and I'd like to 
keep that record intact." 
</P>
<P>
If the record falls, it could be the wooden stake in the heart of a 
disappointing season. Simi Valley will not qualify for the Southern Section 
playoffs for only the third time in Scyphers' 12-year tenure. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we feel dissatisfied with the season," he said. "I don't see how 
anybody can have self-satisfaction when they don't play up to their 
capabilities. But this type of year is bound to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Although the league season ends today, the Pioneers have played one game short 
of the total alloted under Southern Section rules. Scyphers' attempt to add a 
nonleague game may pay off this week. 
</P>
<P>
He said he would like to give Joe Gordon, who has tied Scott Sharts' 1988 
school record with 15 home runs this season, an additional opportunity to equal 
or break the Southern Section record of 16 set by Channel Islands' Arnold 
Garcia in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel you owe it to them to play a complete schedule," Scyphers said. "I also 
feel I owe it to Joe Gordon. Scott set the record in 28 games and Joe will have 
played only 25." 
</P>
<P>
Up and coming: Recent performances by two Golden League underclassmen provide 
promising pictures for the future. 
</P>
<P>
Saugus' Kyle Lonsberry might be the area's best sophomore player. Lonsberry is 
batting .400 with seven doubles 19 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had a sophomore do what he has done," said Doug Worley, who is in 
his 15th year as Saugus coach. 
</P>
<P>
At Canyon, junior right-hander Erik Hiljus (1-2) pitched a three-hitter with 11 
strikeouts to lead the Cowboys to a 9-0 win over Ridgecrest Burroughs on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Scholarship report: Justin Stark, Chaminade's catcher, has been offered a 
scholarship to play baseball for UC Riverside next season but has yet to 
commit. 
</P>
<P>
Stark pounded his seventh home run of the season Friday, breaking the school 
record set by Scott Stuber in 1987.

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: EL CAPITAN HOPS, SKIPS AND JUMPS TO TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Track and field, too, can be a game of inches. El Capitan beat Granite Hills, 
70-66, for the Grossmont 3-A League dual meet title Thursday, and it came down 
to the final triple jump with 300 spectators crowded around the pit. 
</P>
<P>
Granite Hills' Travis Hughes, who had never triple jumped in competition 
before, seemed to have second sewn up at 41-feet-7 1/2. Chris Barton, El 
Capitan's last hope, had never gone more than 40 feet and hadn't jumped in 
three weeks. But Barton unleashed a hop, skip and jump of 41-11 3/4, giving him 
second by inches and propelling El Capitan to its second consecutive league 
title and 18th consecutive dual meet victory dating back to the end of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The number 13 has been lucky for Rancho Buena Vista lately. The Longhorns had 
13 hits April 27 against Vista and won, 15-4; they had 13 hits against Torrey 
Pines and won, 6-3, and they had 13 hits against San Dieguito and won, 10-1. 
George Hadden, David Roberts and Chris Gorr each had three consecutive 
multiple-hit games. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel diver Kelli Manion was the picture of composure Saturday during a 
San Diego section qualifying meet at Mt. Carmel. 
</P>
<P>
Manion, a junior and two-time defending Palomar League champion, had already 
surpassed the 11-dive, 260-point standard to automatically qualify for the 
section finals May 18 at Helix. This meet was just practice for Manion and six 
other competitors who had also already qualified. 
</P>
<P>
As Manion took to the board on her 10th dive, she was putting the finishing 
touches on her lunch, licking her fingers in the process. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh my gosh, Kelli's up there eating," said a voice from the stands. 
</P>
<P>
Her entry into the water, luckily, was feet first. For the record, Manion won 
handily. 
</P>
<P>
Just two weeks ago, Grossmont's John Tatum was third in the county in home runs 
with six. Tatum has hit two home runs in each of two games since then and now 
has the county lead over Christian's Tony Clark, 10-9. 
</P>
<P>
Tatum, a senior, has three two-homer games and 33 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
No. 1 Grossmont is undefeated in the Grossmont 2-A League (5-0) and is 22-2 
overall. Cal Hi Sports ranked Grossmont third in the state in the 3-A division 
and sixth overall in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
How trusting have track meet officials become of their electronic equipment? 
Consider the following: 
</P>
<P>
At the Mt. SAC relays April 21, University City High's Jerome Price long jumped 
25-feet-4 3/4, a quarter-inch shy of his section-leading best of the year. 
Lincoln sophomore Scott Hammond went 23-5 1/2, his best ever. 
</P>
<P>
No wind could be felt by either competitor, nor by two reporters watching the 
event some 20 yards away. A flag just to the side of the runway hung limp. But 
the wind gauge measured a "ghostly" gust of 3.22 meters per second, well over 
the allowable 2.0 meters. The reading kept the jumps from being considered 
among county and state leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the readings could have been off, Dan Shrum, the meet director, 
scoffed. 
</P>
<P>
"The wind just doesn't blow (continually)," he said. "Sometimes it's there and 
sometimes it's not. We're using a certified wind gauge with a TAC (The 
Athletics Congress) official reading it. The wind can be blowing one place in 
the stadium and not 10 feet away." 
</P>
<P>
Well, the next day, after some elite athletes voiced the same complaint as 
Price and Hammond, it was found that the gauge was actually giving readings in 
miles per hour. 
</P>
<P>
Oops. The marks by Price and Hammond were legal after all. 
</P>
<P>
Price had already gone 25-5, so the new finding does not concern him as much as 
it does Hammond, now third in the section with his legalized 23-5 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Shrum, who confirmed the new readings through his secretary, could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>

HILLTOP ACE REBOUNDS, BEATS SOUTHWEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hilltop Coach John Baumgarten didn't have a doubt that his junior pitching 
sensation, Jose Silva, would rebound from his worst outing of the year -- a 
10-1 loss to Castle Park last Thursday in which Silva allowed six earned runs 
in 4 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"He feels bad for about three minutes after something like that," Baumgarten 
said. 
</P>
<P>
So Baumgarten went with his ace Tuesday against Southwest, which entered the 
day tied with Hilltop and Montgomery for first place in the Metro League. 
</P>
<P>
Silva made his coach look pretty good and Southwest hitters look pretty bad -- 
striking out 12 and allowing just four hits in a 6-1 victory over the visiting 
Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
With Hilltop's victory and Montgomery's 2-1 loss to Chula Vista, the Lancers 
are alone in first place with three games remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Center fielder David Chapman provided all the offense Silva needed with three 
hits and two RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Silva, who entered the game with a 1.94 ERA, improved his record to 8-4 and 
raised his strikeout total to 96 in just 77 innings. He entered Tuesday one 
strikeout behind county leader Danny Miller of Poway. 
</P>
<P>
"I was real pumped up for this after they beat me last time," Silva said. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid pitched a tremendous game," Southwest Coach Tom Hernandez said. "I 
knew this game would come down to pitching and he was just better than our kid 
(sophomore Salvador Sanchez) today." 
</P>
<P>
Southwest (11-12, 8-3) scored its run in the third on an Adrian Garcia double 
and a single by Victor Caracoza. But as the game wore on, Silva's velocity 
seemed to improve. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't allow a hit after the third inning and he struck out the side in the 
fourth and seventh. 
</P>
<P>
"He just got tougher," Baumgarten said. "He really turned it on when he got the 
lead." 
</P>
<P>
Hilltop (18-7, 9-2) took the lead in the third on a Jorge Munoz RBI double. 
Sanchez (5-3) kept his team in the game until the sixth when Hilltop erupted 
for four unearned runs. 
</P>
<P>
Hilltop followed Southwest center fielder Carlos Sanchez' error with five hits, 
two off reliever J.J. Wozniak. DAVE McKIBBEN

Question: I've been running for several years, and recently I tried running in 
water, and running in water is much more difficult. Does that mean that you can 
use up more calories when you run in water? Can you provide some comparison? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Running in a pool is estimated to consume about 1,000 calories an hour, 
compared with about 600 to 700 calories when you run on land.

ALICE KAHN: SHE'S LIVING IN A TECHNOWORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICE KAHN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Up in his loft -- it's a nerd! It's a dude! No! It's TechnoGuy! 
</P>
<P>
TechnoGuy lives and works in his technopad surrounded by big black machines. He 
thinks nothing of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Awesome," I say when I walk in. 
</P>
<P>
"Alice, it's just a big stereo," he says of the 10, 8-foot-high black boxes 
with maybe 30 control panels that make me feel like Alice when she was just 
small. 
</P>
<P>
There are only three items in the pad I can identify. There's a tea kettle next 
to some kind of state-of-the-art coffee bean splicer. There's a couch where 
TechnoGuy parks it when he logs off his computer. And I recognize the 
comforting, almost homey gray box of TechnoGuy's Macintosh computer. It's a 
clone of the Mac I have back in my low-tech home. But, of course, he's got some 
kind of fancy computer mouse that's like a genetically altered animal compared 
to my old house mouse. 
</P>
<P>
He pops some coffee into the microwave. (Ever notice how no one ever puts 
anything in a microwave? They "pop" it in furtively, with full fear of frying.) 
</P>
<P>
I decide to gross out TechnoGuy. "I don't own a microwave," I say in the 
rebellious tone of a technophobe. 
</P>
<P>
No microwave! 
</P>
<P>
And I don't have a stereo. 
</P>
<P>
No stereo! 
</P>
<P>
And I don't have a dishwasher. 
</P>
<P>
No dishwasher! 
</P>
<P>
So, what's a nice, red-blooded, machine-fearing girl like me doing in a place 
like this? How is it that I find myself on the cutting edge in a strange man's 
apartment? Why am I in TechnoGuy's world? 
</P>
<P>
I am here because he has gallantly offered me the use of his laser printer. 
Like some latter-day Walter Raleigh, TechnoGuy's gesture is his way of throwing 
his cloak over a black puddle. 
</P>
<P>
Until he buzzed me in past his security system, I have only known TechnoGuy in 
the virtual sense. Virtual reality is what computer people call the world in 
the box of chips. TechnoGuy is my pal from The WELL, the computer network 
favored by people who like to transmit for the hell of it. 
</P>
<P>
All I knew of him before I entered his technopad were words on a computer 
screen from his modem to mine. 
</P>
<P>
I had asked people on The WELL (acronym for Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link) if 
anyone could recommend a good place to take a disk for quality printing. One 
WELLbeing (as gentle users are known) pointed out that if I take my disk to a 
commercial printing place, I'd better get it disinfected for viruses. In the 
virtual world, you can get a disease from casual contact. Old-fashioned girls 
never think of these things. 
</P>
<P>
TechnoGuy takes my disk. I am a stranger in his electronic paradise. Before I 
leave the technopad, he "treats" my disk with his viral detection software. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I'm a suspicious modern city gal. If there is one thing I don't trust, 
it's machines. If there's another thing I don't trust, it's strangers. But even 
as I remain suspicious of the weird golems in TechnoGuy's world, I trust the 
medium by which I have come to know him -- words. You know, when you finally 
pay some attention to that man behind the curtain, you find that even the 
Wizard of Oz is just a friendly guy with a lot of gadgets. 
</P>
<P>
He ain't heavy. He's my virtual brother.

Stallone Fights Off Italian Fans: Sylvester Stallone feared for his safety when 
he was mobbed by about 5,000 fans in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Stallone was leaving a Milan theater in a limousine when its escape route was 
blocked accidentally by two other cars, allowing a crowd to move in. Chanting 
"Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!" the fans pounded on the window before the car made its 
getaway. "He said it was the scariest experience he's ever had before in a 
crowd," Stallone publicist Paul Bloch said. GREG BRAXTON

Warning Sticker to Be Unveiled: A standardized advisory logo for albums 
containing explicit lyrics is scheduled to be unveiled during a news conference 
today in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The Recording Industry Assn. of America and the National Assn. of Record 
Merchandisers will also outline a national consumer awareness campaign about 
the stickering program. The logo was developed in response to parents' 
complaints over allegedly offensive lyrics and numerous state legislative 
proposals to mandate warning stickers. An RIAA spokeswoman said Monday that 
record companies that account for 95% of all albums released in the United 
States have agreed to use the new logo. GREG BRAXTON

BOARD PULLS IN LATE WITH COUNTY PLAN FOR CLEAN AIR 
</P>

Under the threat of fines that could reach $8 million a month, Orange County 
supervisors endorsed a clean air plan for county government Tuesday, months 
after regional air quality officials approved plans for neighboring counties. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County proposal, which includes a controversial provision to charge 
the county's 15,000 employees about $40 a month each for parking, is viewed 
warily by union representatives and was approved reluctantly by the board. But 
without it, said South Coast Air Quality Management District officials, county 
government could face fines of as much as $25,000 a day at each of 16 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The fines are meant to prod area governments and businesses into developing 
recommendations for sharply reducing automobile traffic in the Los Angeles 
Basin, which suffers from the nation's highest levels of air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD has already approved about 1,400 air quality management plans, 
including those of the San Bernardino, Riverside and Los Angeles county 
governments. That leaves only Orange County, and officials here have bristled 
at the pressure to adopt a plan that includes paid parking. 
</P>
<P>
In the plan adopted, the county recommends other incentives, including free and 
preferred parking for car-poolers, creation of a van-pool system, and 
compensatory time for workers who use alternative means of transportation such 
as buses. It even proposes a "walking shoe reimbursement" for employees who 
walk to work. 
</P>
<P>
"We can debate the issue of whether or not we want to be under these mandates," 
said Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, who chaired Tuesday's session. "The fact is 
that we are under a mandate at this time." 
</P>
<P>
With board Chairman Don R. Roth absent, the supervisors accepted the proposed 
parking policy Tuesday, and it will now be forwarded to the AQMD for approval. 
It will return to the board for another round of consideration once the unions 
have been consulted, but the board could approve it even if the unions are not 
satisfied, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A final plan should be "signed, sealed and delivered by the end of the summer," 
said County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
More than 470 private employers, each with more than 200 workers, have already 
submitted air quality plans and had them approved. The AQMD approved San 
Bernardino and Los Angeles counties' plans in March, and Riverside's was 
approved at least a month earlier, said Sarah Siwek, director of transportation 
programs for the AQMD. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County submitted an air quality plan in December, officials said 
Tuesday, but AQMD considered it unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, officials from the county and the district met several times in 
recent months, with AQMD representatives leaning hard on the county government 
to toughen its air quality plan. Unless the county amended its proposal to 
include such things as paid parking and other conservation incentives, it would 
almost certainly be rejected, district officials warned in those sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Siwek said the delay was not the fault of laggard Orange County officials. 
"They've been very forthcoming," she said. "They just have a lot of people in 
cars that they need to deal with, and that's made it very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, AQMD officials reserved final judgment on the county's new plan, 
saying they wanted to see a final copy first. But Tom Eichhorn, media liaison 
officer for district, added that "it ought to be stronger, even with the 
parking policy." 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal presented to the board by Schneider, county employees would 
lose their free parking as part of the government's plan to encourage 
car-pooling and increase the average number of passengers driving to county 
facilities from 1.0 to 1.5. Although a final parking fee has not been 
determined, a report forwarded to the supervisors estimates monthly costs at 
about $40 per month -- or $280 per year -- in the civic center area of Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Free parking for government employees "is not consistent" with increasing 
car-pooling, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of associations representing county employes expressed 
reservations. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very concerned, of course, about any proposal the county makes that 
would adversely affect our members," said Nick Berardino, administrator of 
employee relations for the Orange County Employees' Assn., which represents 
about 9,000 employees. "We'll be sitting down with the county at the bargaining 
table during the next several weeks to get a better sense of what this would 
mean." 
</P>
<P>
Bob MacLeod, general manager of the Orange County Deputy Sheriffs' Assn., said 
that the 1,200-member union is also approaching the coming talks with concern. 
</P>
<P>
"The rumor mill has been going crazy for month now," he said. "Employees are 
hearing that they will have to pay anywhere from $25 to $75 a month for parking 
that they now get free."

MCCARTHY AND SEYMOUR CLASH ON 'SAFE STREETS'

They both support the death penalty, tougher sentences for criminals and more 
funding for local police, but Democratic Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy and Republican 
opponent Sen. John Seymour clashed Tuesday over who would do the most to keep 
California streets safe. 
</P>
<P>
In his first campaign appearance with a Republican opponent, McCarthy 
highlighted the provisions of his so-called safe-streets initiative, which 
would raise the state sales tax by half a cent to pay for a sweeping crackdown 
on crime and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"This initiative may be the most important task I have ever undertaken," 
McCarthy said at a convention of the California Peace Officers Assn. "It is the 
most comprehensive plan to combat drugs and drug-related crime ever proposed in 
this or any other state." 
</P>
<P>
Seymour, a state senator from Anaheim, attacked one provision of the measure in 
an effort to show that it was really "soft on crime." But he was forced to 
modify his comments later when McCarthy pointed out that Seymour voted for a 
bill in January that was used as the model for that portion of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"Leo is right," Seymour said after checking the vote. "That bill is very 
similar to Leo's initiative, and I did vote for it." 
</P>
<P>
The provision would require murderers and rapists to serve full terms after 
their second conviction. Currently, convicted criminals are eligible for parole 
regardless of their number of convictions. The bill Seymour voted for in 
January would have required criminals to serve a full term only after their 
third conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour said, however, that his vote in January was an enhancement of existing 
sentences, and that he still supports a requirement that rapists, murderers and 
felony drug criminals be required to serve a full term after their first 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour also blasted McCarthy's record as a crime fighter. He noted that after 
McCarthy came out in support of the death penalty, he still supported the 
confirmation of former state Supreme Court Justice Rose Bird, who was accused 
of blocking the death sentences of convicted killers. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't quarrel with the fact that after two decades of fighting against the 
death penalty that you searched your soul and your conscience, and you decided 
to support it," Seymour said to the convention. "But I find a little 
inconsistency with your born-again philosophy for the death penalty and your 
broad support for Rose Bird. 
</P>
<P>
"Trying to nail you down on law and order issues is like trying to nail jelly 
to a wall," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour is facing fellow Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) in the June 5 
primary for the GOP nomination in the lieutenant governor's race. Bergeson's 
campaign officials said she could not attend the peace officers convention 
Tuesday because she was in Santa Monica taping a cable television program. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy, who is seeking a third term as lieutenant governor, has long been an 
environmentalist and he supports abortion rights. But he has been attacked by 
Republican opponents as weak on crime, and has been haunted by his previous 
support for Bird. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't begrudge John saying this, he's got to make his best hits," McCarthy 
said after their morning speeches. "I think he feels he's swimming upstream on 
this one." 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy said the most important difference between him and Seymour on crime is 
that his proposal includes the funding needed to make a difference in the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
"Tough guy rhetoric is not enough," McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour told the police officers that he is a fiscal conservative and cannot 
justify a tax increase to pay more for law enforcement. McCarthy said, however, 
that his measure would generate $1.6 billion per year for law enforcement, 
judges and drug-education programs.

DIANNE KLEIN: COLD NOSE, WARM HEART JUST AREN'T ENOUGH FOR BERKELEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dianne Klein 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You think of a police dog and what comes to mind? Big, snarly. Lots of attitude 
and teeth. Mean. 
</P>
<P>
Now think of Berkeley, the place that took the '60s seriously. Some people 
still call it Berserkeley. It's right next to Oakland, but worlds apart. 
</P>
<P>
Next try to think about Berkeley and a police dog together. Sort of like Rambo 
on a macrobiotic diet. I know, it's tough. 
</P>
<P>
But bear with me. This is part of a serious problem in the annals of New Age 
governance. Who knows? It may be what Irvine will have to contend with next. 
</P>
<P>
The Berkeley of the '90s needed a police dog with a nose for dope, not to sniff 
out residents' personal marijuana stashes-which legally, are still off-limits 
to police -- but crack cocaine, the bane of the city's poor neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
No animal even remotely reminiscent of the attack dogs unleashed on the 
anti-war and civil rights demonstrators of the '60s and '70s would do. 
</P>
<P>
Surely one can understand why. Perhaps, mused members of the City Council, the 
perfect beagle could be found. 
</P>
<P>
The beagles, however, never did pan out. But let me tell you about Stride. 
</P>
<P>
Stride, an English cocker spaniel, black with a bib of white on his chest, is a 
certified dope dog. He's also from Orange County, an unfortunate political 
association that the Berkeley City Council said it was willing to overlook. The 
council was elated just to know that such a kinder, gentler dope dog exists. 
</P>
<P>
Stride made his appearance before the council late last year. He plopped right 
there on the chamber floor, awaiting his turn. Cameras clicked, lights flashed. 
Then Stride sniffed out the crack hidden behind the dais in the council 
chambers without a hitch. Boffo. The cops, it seemed, were high on him too. 
</P>
<P>
But there was something else about this dog, something so Berkeley-esque. The 
council members adored his style, his elan, his canine savior faire. Stride's 
eyes were brown, soulful, liquid. The stubby tail started thumping and the body 
shimmied in sync. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just perfect," Berkeley Mayor Loni Hancock gushed at the time. She said 
the city might hire him as early as that day. 
</P>
<P>
OK, fast forward to reality. This is after Berkeley officials have refused to 
return any of my calls about Stride. It's this Tuesday morning, at Cabrillo 
Park in the city of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Kjorlien and I are sitting in the cab of his pickup truck, the big kind, 
not one of those little Japanese wannabees. 
</P>
<P>
Fred is a big kind himself. Forty-eight years old, burly, full gray beard, hair 
slicked back, cool, steely blue eyes, usually a cigarette between his fingers. 
He's a straight talker, articulate. He's been Stride's trainer and owner since 
the dog was a pup. 
</P>
<P>
Fred's an independent type, divorced with two kids. Stride, who works 
free-lance for $125 an hour, is how Fred pays the rent. 
</P>
<P>
So Fred is telling me that it really doesn't matter, that he doesn't want to 
make too big a deal about it, even though nobody in Berkeley has ever given him 
a reason for rejecting Stride, the dog he loves. 
</P>
<P>
Stride, meanwhile, is in the back of the truck, in his cage. I met him a moment 
earlier, when he gave me lots of kisses. Soon he will demonstrate his 
dope-finding skills. Fred says "find it," and within minutes Stride discovers a 
rag stuffed next to the truck's gas tank that bears the scent of some illicit 
stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Stride seems unflappable, and when I take the rag from his mouth, he doesn't 
even growl. Fred says that's normal, that the dog loves everybody. Never known 
to hold a grudge. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd leave with you in a heartbeat, as long as he thought I wasn't looking," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
But I remind Fred about what I had read in the Bay Area press. Berkeley's 
assistant city manager, Weldon Rucker, said Stride was rejected because he was 
too stuck on Fred. Berkeley went with Pepper, a local Labrador, even though he 
didn't have Stride's finesse. 
</P>
<P>
And Rucker was quoted as citing other reasons for the switch as well. Stride 
was going for $10,000, while Pepper was half of that. And ageism -- tsk, tsk -- 
was present, too. Stride turned 5 on Saturday, while Pepper's not even 2. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like buying a new car rather than a used car," Rucker opined to the San 
Francisco Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
Fred says he has no idea where the deal really went wrong, although he brings 
up something else that cops think but hardly ever say out loud. 
</P>
<P>
Stride is not a macho dog. A drug-sniffing Labrador -- cops feel OK about that. 
But when's the last time you saw a narcotics team with a little dog in tow? It 
just doesn't fit with the show. 
</P>
<P>
And here's what a German trainer said about Stride in his 1987 certification 
report: "His temperament is a little sensitive with a hardness level of 
under-medium." 
</P>
<P>
What that means, in other words, is that Stride is a soft touch. He doesn't 
snarl or bite, and he's even trained not to bark. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are dealing with is ignorance," Fred says. "He is not a stereotypical 
dog. . . . I'll put him up against any dope dog in the world." 
</P>
<P>
So with all this, I ask Fred, why would you want to let Stride go? 
</P>
<P>
Well, Fred hems for a bit, he really didn't. Oh, sure, he says, if he could 
have made $10,000, he would have taken it and then started training another 
dog, maybe to sell. 
</P>
<P>
What Fred says he really wanted to do was make a point. English cocker 
spaniels, he says, make great dope dogs, too. 
</P>
<P>
Macho? Fred says. What's so great about that? 
</P>
<P>
Stride's a professional, with boundless enthusiasm for his work. He loves 
people and he's a great tool. 
</P>
<P>
And besides, Fred stresses, Stride is an English cocker spaniel, not the 
American kind. Those kind are worthless, he says, and sissies, too. 
</P>
<P>
Fred takes another drag on his cigarette and then he smiles. Stride's tongue is 
flopped out and he seems to be hanging on Fred's every word. 
</P>
<P>
A man and his dog. Out having a good time.

COMMITTEE ENDORSES WATER RATIONING PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
DROUGHT: MAYOR'S CALL FOR MANDATORY 10% CUT IN USAGE IS MET WITH SKEPTICISM 
FROM DWP OFFICIALS. FULL COUNCIL WILL VOTE NEXT MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley's bid to impose mandatory water rationing in Los Angeles 
passed an important test Tuesday as it was endorsed by members of a key City 
Council committee. 
</P>
<P>
Committee members came to their conclusions even though senior Department of 
Water and Power officials refused to take a position on rationing during the 
first day of hearings on the continuing drought and projected water shortages. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who chairs the Commerce, Energy and Natural 
Resources Committee, said, "There's enough evidence there to warrant a 
mandatory (rationing) program to be presented to the City Council." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, vice chair of the committee that oversees water 
issues, said, "We're beginning to understand that water is finite" and must be 
conserved. "Most of these things we ought to be doing anyway. It's the price of 
living in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
Norm Nichols, DWP general manager, was asked four times by the committee 
whether rationing was justifiable, and each time he ducked the question. 
"That's the $64 question," he joked at one point. 
</P>
<P>
He said there was not enough information available to make a decision on 
rationing and at another point he asked, "Can we get the same savings from an 
aggressive voluntary (conservation) program?" 
</P>
<P>
Nichols' reluctance to back Bradley's rationing proposal did not play well with 
the mayor's office. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Fabiani, Bradley's chief of staff, said, "The mayor won't be stymied by 
Nichols' peculiar and unexplained philosophical objection to water 
conservation. The guy's up there giving some very strange answers to some very 
straight questions." 
</P>
<P>
Fabiani added that Nichols "is talking about voluntary programs, but where is 
the department's program? There wasn't one until the mayor imposed it." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Gage, a member of the DWP Board of Commissioners, said he felt the 
decision on rationing should be made by the mayor and the City Council and not 
by the DWP staff. 
</P>
<P>
"Policy-makers make policy, not department heads," said Gage, who was appointed 
to the board earlier this year after serving for several years as Bradley's 
chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
Flores agreed that "the final determination should be made by elected 
officials." But the councilwoman told DWP commissioners that they will be 
required to take a stand on rationing before the measure goes to the full 
council. 
</P>
<P>
Flores and Galanter said they based their decisions to support rationing on 
reports from the DWP and the Metropolitan Water District that water supplies 
could be short by 10% to 12% this summer. Runoff from the winter snowpack has 
been measured at 50% of normal in the Sierra Nevada, where most of the city's 
water comes from, officials have reported. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, DWP engineers also reported that city residents cut their 
water use through voluntary conservation by an estimated 8% in April and during 
the first week of May. 
</P>
<P>
James Wickser, assistant general manager of the DWP, did not say how the 
cutbacks were measured, but traditionally the DWP measures sewer flows as its 
primary means of gauging water usage. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has asked that city residents be required to reduce their consumption 
by 10% from 1986 levels. 
</P>
<P>
Water rationing was endorsed by the Sierra Club and other environmental groups 
whose representatives testified at the hearing Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Flores questioned whether voluntary conservation measures have been given 
enough of a chance, but she said the city cannot wait much longer as the summer 
months approach. She said she still has questions on how rationing will be 
implemented. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to just throw something together, not just a patchwork. . . . we 
need something permanent," she said, adding that the committee should be able 
to present a program to the council by June 15. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Councilwoman Joy Picus said residents with large lawns or who live 
in the hotter areas of the city -- such as the San Fernando Valley -- should be 
able to appeal for larger water allotments under a conservation plan. She noted 
that the West Valley was 25 degrees warmer than Venice Beach during the recent 
heat wave. 
</P>
<P>
In a press release, Picus said, "We need to be fair to people who have larger 
lawns, lusher vegetation and warmer weather." 
</P>
<P>
Picus did not say how many extra gallons her proposed dispensation would make 
available to Valley water users. 
</P>
<P>
Her idea did not float well with Fabiani or DWP staff. 
</P>
<P>
The cutback mechanism "already automatically adjusts for weather," Fabiani 
said. Presumably, Valley residents were using more water in 1986 than 
homeowners elsewhere due to the weather factor, he said. Thus, a 10% cut for a 
Valley resident is as equitable as a similar cut for a Westside user. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, Bradley's office said that it overstated how much the 
city's summer pool program will be cut back as a water savings device. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the mayor said the program would be cut from 12 weeks to nine weeks. 
But on Tuesday, the mayor's office said that it would actually be reduced to 12 
weeks from an earlier planned 15 weeks. In most years, the program runs for 12 
weeks, but council members had favored expanding the program this year to 15 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said Tuesday that "due to budgetary and water conservation 
considerations" he was restoring the program to 12 weeks. The city's outdoor 
pools will open June 23 and close Sept. 9.

his homeland in the Soviet Union via Radio Free Europe. Sometimes he faxed his 
campaign literature to Estonia and counted on friends to distribute it to 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course when you try to send a fax to Estonia, it sometimes takes three to 
four days. There's a lot of hit and miss," Taagepera said. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Estonia, Taagepera, 57, is a UC Irvine political science professor 
whose articles and speeches brim with pro-independence rhetoric about his 
homeland's struggle with the Soviet Union. He is a staunch nationalist who, at 
the age of 11, accompanied his parents as they fled Estonia after the Russian 
occupation in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
Taagepera, who is a Canadian citizen, is the only person in the United States 
who was elected in March to the new, 500-member Estonian Congress. In all, four 
of those elected live outside Estonia. 
</P>
<P>
In Estonia, Taagepera explained, the congress is "like a national assembly. It 
is legal but has no administering power. The Supreme Soviets (the ruling 
authority) still run the country." 
</P>
<P>
But he quickly adds: "However, everything in my homeland -- control of the 
press, industry and government -- is in a state of flux." 
</P>
<P>
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are the three Baltic states that were annexed by 
the Soviet Union in 1940. Only last week, Latvia joined Lithuania in declaring 
its independence. In the case of Lithuania, the action prompted Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to impose an economic blockade. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Estonian leaders, seeking a more moderate approach and worried 
about the large numbers of Soviet troops within their borders, took a different 
tack. They tried to soften their stand with an "announcement" that the Soviet 
occupation was illegal and, therefore, Soviet laws no longer had authority. 
</P>
<P>
The Estonian plan is to negotiate an independence agreement with Moscow that 
would remove Soviet troops from Estonian soil and hand control of the 
republic's affairs to local officials, Taagepera said. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we declared independence without using the word independence," 
Taagepera said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the announcement was made in March, Taagepera said, Soviet leaders in 
Moscow have asked Estonia to withdraw the statement. 
</P>
<P>
Taagepera was one of 11 candidates vying for five seats in his hometown of 
Tartu. He won a seat with 4,346 votes, more than twice as many as his nearest 
competitor. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to go to Estonia for the election, but my visa was denied," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cesar Sereseres, a UC Irvine colleague in the political science department, 
describes Taagepera as a caring man. 
</P>
<P>
"He cares about his homeland, his students and his family. . . . He's like 
professors from Ireland, Africa and Costa Rica who have blood roots to their 
homeland. These people have their ethnicity deeply embedded, not only in their 
brains but their hearts, and that's Rein," Sereseres said. 
</P>
<P>
Taagepera's wife, Mare, a UC Irvine chemistry instructor, was also born in 
Estonia. She said it is difficult for others to understand, but "our cultural 
background is very strong. We speak Estonian. . . . It's a hard thing to 
explain to people not in this situation." 
</P>
<P>
To live under Soviet rule, she said, is to live with fear. Just several years 
ago, she said, people wouldn't talk to their neighbors for fear of being 
reported to the KGB. "Estonians remember what it was like when it was 
independent, but the Russians came in and made us a third-world country." 
</P>
<P>
Taagepera has made trips to Estonia. On one visit last year, he made 21 public 
appearances in 18 days and spoke to crowds ranging from a handful of people to 
5,000, he said. In his articles, Taagepera describes the Soviets as 
"post-occupation colonists," essentially illegal immigrants who should apply 
for Estonian citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not only my viewpoint but a question of legality. The question isn't to 
throw out a (Soviet colonist) who has been there 39 years, but to legalize 
their status," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a matter of Estonia leaving the Soviet Union, because we never 
joined. We were illegally occupied, and that occupation has continued because 
of fraudulent elections. Our question is, 'Do you want to join with the Soviet 
Union?' Not, 'Do you want to leave?' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Taagepera considers himself "more radical" than some of the mainstream 
pro-democracy organizers. But he believes that with relations presently 
strained between Moscow and the Baltic states, it would be foolish to begin 
pushing hard for Estonian independence right now. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is seeking approval for a four-month teaching assignment at an 
Estonian university in Tartu. He views the assignment as a challenge to 
discover whether he would eventually like to move back to Estonia. 
</P>
<P>
"I like living here and to live in Estonia would be a difficult move for both 
my wife and I. How do I know whether I would like living there? But let's just 
say I'm considering moving back."

When Susan Assad and her family moved into their new home in Glenwood Terrace 
three years ago, they were told a new elementary school would be built right in 
their development -- in two to five years. 
</P>
<P>
What they weren't told, Assad said, was that in the meantime her children could 
be bounced to four schools. But that is one of the realities facing the rapidly 
expanding Capistrano Unified School District as it grapples with placing 
incoming students from the new planned community of Aliso Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
While families like the Assads pay special taxes annually, based on what are 
called Mello-Roos special tax districts, to build schools in their 
neighborhoods, no one promised when they would be delivered. In the meantime, 
the students must go somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
By October, according to district projections, almost 350 Aliso Viejo students 
are expected to be enrolled in district elementary schools in nearby Laguna 
Niguel, and 579 the year after that. Which means existing students must be 
shuffled around to accommodate them, or, worse in the opinions of many parents, 
must be bused to schools out of their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"We're tired of being the shock absorber for the district," said Molly 
Getzlaff, the president of next year's Crown Valley Elementary School PTA. 
"After four years of being disrupted, now they're talking about disrupting our 
school again. It's someone else's turn to be flexible." 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners in Aliso Viejo and parts of Mission Viejo are paying taxes of $145 
to $773 annually, depending on the size of their home, for new schools, 
according to a district spokesman. But those fees will pay for a new 
$45-million high school first, and later a kindergarten-through-eighth-grade 
school and two or three elementary schools, said Bill Dawson, an assistant 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
"The earliest we could have an elementary school in the Aliso Viejo area is 
1992, and that depends on state bond issues in June and November," Dawson said. 
It could also be as late as 1995 or 1996, Dawson said. 
</P>
<P>
For people like the Assads, that could mean four different moves for their 
elementary school children. One option the board is considering is moving the 
Aliso Viejo children at Moulton School to Crown Valley school for two years, 
then to an annex of portables at Niguel Hills Junior High for three years, and 
then to their new school, all in the course of one elementary school career. 
</P>
<P>
"The immediate issues for us are continuity and stability," Assad said. "We 
have accepted the busing; we've been doing that for three years." 
</P>
<P>
But as long as developers can build communities before the schools, there will 
be no stability, say parents such as Getzlaff. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have is small symptom of a much larger problem," she said. "Why is it 
that the law requires developers to install things such as roads, sewers and 
utilities before they put in their houses but not schools? We can put a 
Band-Aid on this now, but it's a much bigger problem than just what we have 
here." 
</P>
<P>
"That's just the uniqueness of California law," Dawson said. "I don't know of 
any instance in the state where schools are built first. The system is not put 
together like that." 
</P>
<P>
Schools are not funded until 50% of the students for the school area actually 
live in that area, Dawson said. 
</P>
<P>
In the next few weeks, the district must come up with a formula for rearranging 
the students for next September, a formula that will have to be adopted by a 
vote of the seven-member Board of Trustees next month. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone feels like they are the ones who have to carry the burden," said Paul 
Haseman, a board member from Laguna Niguel. "Well, it's true, everyone does. 
The turmoil created by an expanding community will continue, and there will be 
impacts before schools are built which always put burdens on the community. 
What I'm looking for is finding a plan for Aliso Viejo now so we won't have to 
keep moving the kids around every year." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, parents from Moulton and Crown Valley schools are hoping that 
everyone remains civil. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the worst thing that could happen is that we could make this a bitter 
fight between Moulton and Crown Valley," parent Kay Payton said. "These are the 
people we play soccer with or play softball with. These are the people we sit 
with afterwards at Ballpark Pizza. I would hate to see that happen."

If he weren't the owner of two restaurants, Gerard Ferry never would have 
noticed the strange coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
Ferry received a letter at L'Orangerie from a man who claimed that on a recent 
visit "one of your servers accidentally spilled a drink down the front of my 
suit. The incident did not anger me because I was a waiter while in school and 
accidents do happen. The server apologized and told me to just send in my 
cleaning bill." 
</P>
<P>
Funny thing, though. When Ferry opened his mail at Pastel, he received a letter 
that was identical except that "Pastel" had been substituted for "L'Orangerie" 
and "Beverly Hills" for "Los Angeles." And a copy of the same bill was 
enclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Next, Ferry related, "I call (owner) Eddie (Kerkhofs) at the Le Dome, and 
Eddie, he gets the same letter." So did Locanda Veneta's Jean Louis de Mori, 
and Tuttobene's owner, Sylvio de Mori (Jean Louis' brother). 
</P>
<P>
Considering the small scale of the fraud attempt, no one has contacted police 
about the letter writer, whose address turned out to be a post office box in 
Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"No, no, no," Ferry quipped. "I have enough problems with (Times restaurant 
reviewer) Ruth Reichl." 
</P>

"Why join a fitness club when you can buy muscles for $1.85?" writes 
mid-Wilshire resident Jim Bishop. Despite the spelling on the label of the 
package that he bought in Little Tokyo (see photo), it actually contained 
mussels.

We've read all about sign-waving malathion opponents. But there was a

It's always a thrill to see works of art in progress. There's the blue stripe 
that has languished on the south side of the L.A. Convention Center for weeks 
while officials try to decide if that's the color they want to paint the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
A while back, the letters GO suddenly appeared on the Wells Fargo building 
downtown -- a "visibility test" for its forthcoming Wells Fargo logo. The 
company's stagecoach symbol was junked. Too subtle, perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes Sa Ba, a test logo for Sanwa Bank's new building, an 
otherwise-impressive combination of rose granite and turquoise trim on Figueroa 
Street. Already, letter writers in the L.A. Downtown News are accusing the bank 
of "uglifying" the skyline, in the manner of the 73-story First Interstate 
tower with its tacked-on "I" logos. 
</P>
<P>
"When a company puts that much money into a location and all the competition 
around you has managed to put their names on their buildings, it's a little 
tough to say we'll forgo the logo," said a spokeswoman for Sa Ba -- excuse us, 
Sanwa.

BILL BOYARSKY: A CANYON AS CULTURAL LANDMARK?

The muck of Los Angeles City Hall's land development politics seemed far away 
from the hot Santa Monica Mountains hillside. But politics as much as a desire 
for a hike had brought me to the mountains last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Leading our group up the hill was a tall, gaunt man of 78 -- geologist Tom 
Dibblee Jr., who knows the Santa Monica Mountains rock by rock. He's walked 
more than 40,000 square miles of California, mapping mountains, valleys, 
canyons and faults. Gesturing with one hand, holding a bullhorn in the other, 
Dibblee pointed out surrounding canyons and formations created when the earth 
was thrust upward more than 20 million years ago. 
</P>
<P>
I'd joined the hike -- a fund-raiser to finance publication of Dibblee's maps 
-- to learn something about the history of the mountains. Mountain history had 
become mixed up with politics in City Hall that week in an unusual development 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
In another part of the Santa Monicas, several miles to the east, developers 
Fred Sahadi and his wife, Helen, have proposed building 26 homes in Fryman 
Canyon, 63 acres of unspoiled hiking paths, oaks and a small stream between 
Mulholland Drive and Studio City in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The project has been approved by the City Council and grading permits have been 
issued by the Department of Building and Safety. But in a last desperate 
attempt to stop the project, canyon supporters last month asked the city's 
Cultural Heritage Commission to declare Fryman Canyon a historical and cultural 
monument. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody has ever proposed saving a canyon on grounds that it is a historical and 
cultural landmark. That designation usually goes to old theaters, Art Deco 
buildings or homes by Frank Lloyd Wright. But the maneuver worked, at least 
temporarily. The commission issued an order stopping Sahadi from construction 
until it decides whether to include the canyon on the city's 
historical-cultural preservation list. Commissioners are expected to announce 
this month whether the canyon should be preserved. 
</P>
<P>
With understandable unhappiness, Sahadi's attorney, Benjamin M. Reznik, filed 
an objection. He accused the canyon supporters of trying to force Sahadi to 
sell the canyon for parkland at below fair market value. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no evidence that the environmental attributes of the subject property 
(if any) have any unique or special relationship to the people of the city of 
Los Angeles. . . . In fact this site has no more cultural significance than any 
other undeveloped land in the Santa Monica Mountains," he told the commission. 
"Unless the commission is prepared to designate every undeveloped property in 
the Santa Monica Mountains area, it should disapprove the proposed 
designation." 
</P>
<P>
That put the question clearly. Is undeveloped land of historical significance? 
Can a canyon without buildings be of historical importance? Are the Santa 
Monica Mountains' steep, rocky weed patches available for development, or are 
they part of our heritage? 
</P>
<P>
I thought of the answer when I talked to Tom Dibblee. 
</P>
<P>
Dibblee looks like the late John Huston. He has a long, thin face, weathered by 
the sun. He speaks in a slow cadence, hard to understand at first, a man who's 
spent much of his life alone in the mountains, uncomfortable with conversation. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone walked over more of California than you? I asked. "I've walked over more 
of it and driven over more of it," he said. "You have to go all over to map, up 
every canyon, every road cut, every ridge. It takes a lot of walking." 
</P>
<P>
In his mapping expeditions, Dibblee has recorded many millions of years of 
California history. Saturday, he led the group through 25 million years, 
including the remains of the great volcanic eruptions and the earth movements 
along the faults. 
</P>
<P>
We hiked into Malibu Creek State Park from Mulholland Highway until the park 
rangers stopped us. The intense heat had multiplied fire danger, and the park 
was closed. With Dibblee leading, we returned to the highway. He walked along 
the shoulder, examining the formations, oblivious to the Beverly Hills bikers, 
on their fancy Harleys, speeding by. 
</P>
<P>
The formations, twisted and pushed into their present shapes, are part of 
Southern California's history and heritage. They go with the manzanita, the 
chaparral, the wildlife and the rest of the Santa Monica Mountains' ambience. 
These works of nature represent as much of our past as a Frank Lloyd Wright 
house or Mann's Chinese Theater. 
</P>
<P>
We don't have to declare Tom Dibblee a cultural and historical monument. He's 
already done that with his life's work. But we can preserve the mountains, so 
there's more left of them than Tom Dibblee's maps.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CONTRACT APPROVED FOR NEW CITY MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pasadena Board of Directors Tuesday approved a contract for Philip Hawkey, 
who will become Pasadena's city manager June 18 despite vigorous opposition by 
members of the city's black community. The contract includes a $119,500 annual 
salary and generous severance pay if Hawkey, now city manager in Toledo, Ohio, 
is dismissed without just cause. 
</P>
<P>
The severance pay provisions -- 18 months' salary if fired during the first 
year and 12 months' salary if fired in the second or third years -- will 
insulate Hawkey, who is white, from politically motivated attempts to fire him, 
Director William Thomson said. The vote was 4 to 2 to approve the contract, 
with Mayor Jess Hughston abstaining. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkey was chosen for the job over two black finalists. His four years in 
Toledo were marked by racial tensions, including a discrimination complaint 
filed against him and the city. Hawkey, 43, will receive a $500 monthly auto 
allowance and financial help to buy a home here. He succeeds retiring City 
Manager Donald McIntyre.

COUNTY BEGIN PLANS FOR COURT BOND ISSUE

<P>
Orange County supervisors voted Tuesday to direct the county staff to proceed 
with plans for a November referendum on a $390-million bond for court 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which would require a two-thirds vote of approval, is one of 
several potential tax proposals that supporters would like to see on the 
November ballot. Transportation improvements, jail construction and open-space 
acquisition have also been discussed, though for now, jails appear to have been 
ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
County voters have a long record of rejecting general obligation bonds; not 
since 1957 have they approved one. 
</P>
<P>
The board has until Aug. 10 to place the measure on November's ballot. JIM

RIDGE PLAN PITS OPEN SPACE AGAINST SPORTS

<P>
Open-space advocates clashed with youth sports supporters into the morning 
Tuesday at a meeting in which the Mission Viejo Co. offered to build $10 
million in sports facilities in exchange for approval to build 719 homes. 
</P>
<P>
After closing the hearing shortly before 2 a.m., the Planning Commission 
postponed discussing the issue until a May 16 special meeting at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The 421-acre project would deed more than 200 acres of open space to the city. 
The Mission Viejo Co. has pledged to build three sports parks on 22 acres at a 
cost of $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the company would build homes on a three-mile stretch along Olympiad 
Boulevard between Alicia and Oso parkways, the city's last undeveloped ridge. 
</P>
<P>
"To ruin that ridge as we see it today is a shame for the whole area," said 
Stuart Kline, a resident of the 1,900-home Casta del Sol retirement community. 
The Mission Viejo Co. "is not giving us anything. They're helping themselves as 
they go along." 
</P>
<P>
Forrest Hunt, an official of the North Mission Viejo Little League, said the 
city desperately needs new facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"We need more fields," he said. "Our kids can't vote right now, but our voices 
can be heard." 
</P>
<P>
City planners also produced a preliminary study that maintains construction 
could take place at least 200 feet from the bluff, known as Naciente Ridge, a 
move that would cut 240 homes from the project. The study contradicts the 
environment impact report's assertion that if homes are built farther down the 
ridge, the hilltops would still need to be graded. 
</P>
<P>
"We would need to grade to the top to stabilize the peak if homes are built 
lower down," said Wayne Peterson, company director of planning. FRANK MESSINA

<P>
TICKET 'EXTORTION' CASE MOVING ALONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unusual federal suit charging that Huntington Beach is guilty of "extortion" 
because it operates a "speed trap" has had its first airing before a federal 
judge in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Sangster said he appeared before U.S. Judge Stephen Wilson on Monday and 
argued for dismissal of the suit, saying the city does not operate a speed trap 
or commit extortion. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is a suit filed March 20 by Ernest J. Franceschi Jr., a Seal Beach 
lawyer. Franceschi, who has been arrested on speeding charges three times in 
the past 18 months in Huntington Beach, charged in the suit that the city is 
operating a speed trap. 
</P>
<P>
His suit seeks millions of dollars from the city as restitution to motorists, 
including himself, who allegedly have been illegally trapped while driving on 
Pacific Coast Highway in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The suit charges that the alleged speed trap is a violation of the federal 
anti-racketeering, or RICO, law because people stopped for speeding must post 
bail or else face the "threat of arrest, imprisonment or other official action 
. . . " That is tantamount to "extortion," Franceschi said. 
</P>
<P>
Sangster, in his appearance before Wilson, argued that people arrested for 
speeding are not always required to post bail. Wilson asked for more 
information on bail procedures, saying he would then decide whether or not to 
dismiss the case. BILL BILLITER

CITY IMPOSES PACT ON FIREFIGHTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES TORTOLANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After more than four months of negotiations with the city's firefighter union, 
the Garden Grove City Council has voted to declare an impasse in talks and 
impose a contract covering the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
The vote was 4 to 1 Monday night in favor of the city proposal, which calls for 
a one-year contract with a 4% wage increase and a $58 monthly increase in the 
city's contribution to medical benefits. Councilman Frank Kessler voted against 
the pact. 
</P>
<P>
Contract negotiations began in late December and have been stalled since early 
April. A contract similar to the one enacted by the council Monday was rejected 
by the union membership 82 to 0. The union's most recent counteroffer was a 7% 
pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, public safety employees cannot strike. If an impasse in 
negotiations is declared, a city council may impose a contract, regardless of 
the union's objections. 
</P>
<P>
In one concession to the firefighters, who are members of Garden Grove 
Firefighters Local 2005, the council agreed to make the wage and fringe benefit 
increases effective as of March 17. Generally, the city has opposed any 
retroactive pay or benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The action came after more than three hours of discussion among firefighters, 
their supporters and the council. The council chamber was filled with men and 
women bearing picket signs that supported higher wages for the firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
"Be responsive to your employees. Use your authority to request a state 
mediator to come here and help in negotiations," urged Richard A. Levine, an 
attorney representing the firefighters' union. A dozen citizens spoke to the 
council on behalf of firefighters, many of whom credited paramedics with saving 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a responsibility to the people in this town to see that the city 
doesn't go broke," said Mayor W. E. (Walt) Donovan. "I can't in good conscience 
give it all to the Fire Department because they'll save me if I have a heart 
attack." 
</P>
<P>
Kessler opposed the contract on the grounds that he felt that firefighters 
should be paid on the same basis as the Police Department, which uses a formula 
comparing salaries of Anaheim, Santa Ana and Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot offer quantity. We've always attacked the problem with quality. And 
you cannot recruit and keep quality people unless you pay a competitive wage," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
To call attention to the stalled contract talks, firefighters have picketed 
city buildings and busy intersections. The possibility of making public safety 
salaries an election-year issue was raised. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll see you in November," several cried out after the council vote. JAMES 
TORTOLANO

HI-TECH TEACHING;

<P>
EDUCATORS LEARNING THAT THE VIDEODISC CAN BE A BIG PART OF THE CLASSROOM 
PICTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By her own admission, veteran high school English teacher Fran Oberman is one 
of those people who shy away from technology. 
</P>
<P>
She dreads wrestling with those old classroom filmstrips and projectors, 
doesn't operate the family VCR and until just recently had never even laid eyes 
on a videodisc. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there she was last week, equipped with a borrowed videodisc player, 
expertly guiding her 10th-graders through the film version of Harper Lee's 
Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, "To Kill a Mockingbird." 
</P>
<P>
"This is wonderful -- especially for teaching writing," enthused Oberman, who 
teaches at Taft High School in Woodland Hills. "You can do so much with it, and 
it's so easy to use." 
</P>
<P>
Oberman's experience does not surprise former junior high school English 
teacher and Cal State Northridge lecturer Martina E. Lewis. In her role as a 
supervisor for CSUN's student teachers throughout Los Angeles and Ventura 
counties, she has tried to help her technology-shy colleagues see the light. 
</P>
<P>
"We English teachers are notorious for being afraid to use technology," Lewis 
said. "I was in one school that had a nearly new disc player just sitting in a 
closet somewhere because nobody knew what to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis is convinced that the videodisc can easily and inexpensively enhance the 
teaching of writing, literature and other language arts. She has been working 
informally with dozens of teachers, writing study guides (to be published this 
fall by Pasadena-based Media Learning Systems), demonstrating techniques and 
lessons, helping compare the features of various models of disc players. She 
even lends her own equipment on occasion, lugging TV set, player and a small 
library of discs from school to school. Some schools have bought videodisc 
players after their English teachers tried Lewis' methods. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis cites several reasons for her fervor about teaching via the videodisc, 
which looks like a silver-toned LP record. Its thousands of frames are read by 
a light beam in the player, which can be plugged into a television set and 
controlled by a single remote-control key pad, thus eliminating the need for a 
lot of expensive equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Because nothing touches the data stored on the disc, it does not wear out or 
become distorted with use. Some forms can provide pictures that can be "frozen" 
on the screen indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
And, unlike videotape, any frame on a disc can be called up within four 
seconds, giving users increased flexibility. (Oberman, for example, was able to 
quickly find and display seven examples of prejudice in the video version of 
the novel her class was studying, the story of a black man wrongly accused of 
raping a white woman in the Depression-era South.) 
</P>
<P>
Highly sophisticated "interactive" videodiscs -- which require computer 
terminals and other costly equipment to enable students to respond individually 
to material being taught -- have been used in industry and military training 
classes for several years and are increasingly available for school use. 
</P>
<P>
But Lewis said she has found most teachers are not ready for high-level 
interactivity yet, nor can their districts afford it. 
</P>
<P>
"I started out interested in the highest level of interactivity, but when I saw 
the need and how it was being used, I knew it had to be brought down to a level 
that was more affordable and more understandable," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
So she has devised ways to use commonly available videodiscs in the classroom. 
Much of the material taught in California's junior and senior high schools -- 
such as Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet," Reginald Rose's "Twelve Angry Men" 
and "The Diary of Anne Frank" -- have been made into films. A number of them 
have been recorded on videodisc, increasingly available for home use, and can 
be rented or bought at many video stores. 
</P>
<P>
Teamed with other videodiscs, such as those of Grolier's Encyclopedia or a 
history of the National Gallery of Art, Lewis said, these works can be used in 
conjunction with reading to create custom-tailored instruction. 
</P>
<P>
By going through the work on videodisc, a teacher can note scenes or concepts 
and create lessons that can be adapted for all ability levels, designed for 
group learning or tailored for an individual student. Today's technology-wise 
students can use the videodiscs to choose and launch their own research 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
The videodisc allows students to make detailed comparisons between book and 
movie versions, study character and plot development and build writing 
assignments based on material pulled from the videodisc. 
</P>
<P>
No one has conducted formal tests yet to see how these types of videodiscs 
affect student learning. Yet teachers such as Oberman are pleased with their 
classroom results. 
</P>
<P>
Her racially integrated class spent a day looking for clues to the innocence of 
"Mockingbird's" accused rapist. Taking turns operating the controls, the 
students searched for information about the novel's setting and used the 
Grolier's disc to look up such concepts as prejudice and discrimination. They 
viewed examples of racial segregation and wrote brief essays on incidents of 
discrimination that they had witnessed. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know the difference between between prejudice and discrimination?" 
Oberman asked a student who had been working with the Grolier's disc. 
</P>
<P>
"Prejudice is an attitude," the youth replied. "Discrimination is how you show 
it. It's behavior."

FUND-RAISER OKD TO HELP FINANCE PIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A divided City Council has voted to hire a professional fund-raiser to try to 
solicit $2.5 million in private donations for the city's planned $11-million to 
$12-million new pier. 
</P>
<P>
The late-night, 5-2 vote Monday came after one councilman said he doubted that 
the money could be raised and another councilman urged a bond issue instead. 
Meanwhile, a city staff report showed the cost of the pier. 
</P>
<P>
The old pier has been closed since July, 1988, because of its unsafe condition. 
Its demolition, once set for July, now has been postponed until after the Labor 
Day holiday. City officials told the council Monday night that razing the 
structure needed to be delayed at least until after August so that it would not 
interfere with the O.P. Surfing Championships held annually during that month 
near the pier. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the council's discussion about the pier centered on concern about 
financing a new structure. 
</P>
<P>
A new staff report revealed Monday night that the cost of the pier, once 
estimated at $11 million, has climbed to about $12 million. The city so far has 
raised only about $7.5 million for the new pier. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Thomas J. Mays said the city should hire a professional fund-raiser to 
try to secure as much of the remaining $4.5 million as possible. But Councilman 
Wes Bannister argued against the move, saying that virtually all major donors 
in the city have already been tapped for the pier. 
</P>
<P>
Bannister said it would be a waste of city money to hire a fund-raiser. 
Councilman John Erskine said he thought the city should be moving toward a bond 
issue to help pay for the pier and also for a park, or plaza, at the entrance 
to the new pier. Erskine noted that voters in San Juan Capistrano and Los 
Alamitos earlier this year overwhelmingly approved bond issues for civic 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
After extended debate, the council majority voted at 11:30 p.m. to hire the 
Robert B. Sharp Co. for a 1 1/2-year fund-raising effort. The contract calls 
for the cost to the city not to exceed $250,000. The Sharp Company will seek to 
raise at least $2.5 million of the $4.5 million still needed for the pier. 
</P>
<P>
Bannister and Councilman Jim Silva voted against hiring the fund-raiser. 
Erskine supported the move, but he said he still favors a bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
Mays said after the meeting that the city can still pursue a bond issue if 
private fund-raising fails. BILL BILLITER

MEETING TO EXPLAIN RECYCLING PROGRAM 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first of four town meetings will be held today by the city of Placentia and 
Placentia Disposal Inc. to inform residents of a new recycling program and 
changes in disposal service. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning next month, the city will implement a recycling program that uses 
automated waste collection devices and containers to collect recyclables, 
similar to programs in Brea and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
The first meeting is scheduled for 7 p.m. today at Tuffree Junior High School, 
2151 N. Kraemer Blvd. A short video will be presented along with a 
demonstration of the 110-gallon containers soon to be distributed by the city. 
Officials will explain what is considered recyclable and answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
"This program not only changes the way the city will collect the trash but also 
asks residents to do their part by altering their waste disposal habits," said 
Robert D'Amato, city administrator. 
</P>
<P>
The city will provide residents with two containers -- black for regular, 
nonrecyclable waste materials, and green for recyclable items, which include 
newspapers, glass, aluminum, tin cans and plastics. The special containers will 
replace residents' old trash cans and will begin to be distributed in the 
second week of June. 
</P>
<P>
Pickup schedules throughout the city will remain the same with the new system. 
Collection of the black trash containers will be made weekly, and green 
recyclable containers will be picked up every other week. Effective July, 1990, 
rates for residential disposal will be $9.99 per month, an increase of $1.59. 
</P>
<P>
Additional meetings are scheduled for 7 p.m. Thursday at the Gomez Center, 1701 
Atwood Ave.; 7:30 p.m. Monday at the Backs Community Building, 201 N. Bradford 
Ave.; and 7 p.m. May 17 at Oberly Gym, 974 S. Melrose St. Residents unable to 
attend the meetings may call Placentia Disposal at (714) 632-1576.JULIE ESPY

COUNCIL ENDORSES ARMING RANGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By the end of the year, the city's five full-time park rangers will become the 
first in Orange County allowed to carry handguns on patrol. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council on Monday unanimously endorsed the idea of arming the rangers 
and directed the city attorney's office to draft an ordinance that will allow 
them to carry .357-caliber Smith &amp; Wesson revolvers while patrolling Santa 
Ana's 38 parks. The rangers already wear bulletproof vests and carry batons, 
Mace and two-way radios. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager David N. Ream said that setting up a program to arm the rangers 
would take about nine months and cost about $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be in the best interest of the department if we proceed with 
a sensible plan of testing and arming the park rangers," Ream said. "It needs 
to be done in a thoughtful, thorough way." 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Richards L. Norton urged the council to make sure that the 
rangers are armed "as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
"Every day they are out there without the necessary protection, including 
firearms, they are in jeopardy," Norton said. "There's a tremendous need out 
there, and it's just a matter of making it a priority." 
</P>
<P>
Sean Mill, chairman of the city's Recreation and Community Advisory Board, 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see it implemented as soon as possible rather than wait nine 
months, because gang problems get worse," Mill said. "I think the summer is 
going to be a bad one in Santa Ana, and I'd like to see our rangers armed 
before then." 
</P>
<P>
Rangers already have undergone 360 hours of reserve officer classes, which 
include training with firearms, but they will have to complete gun 
certification training, Ream said. 
</P>
<P>
Although city officials said no park ranger has ever been stabbed or shot on 
duty, shots were fired recently in the direction of an on-duty ranger, said 
Allen Doby, director of the city Recreation and Community Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The park ranger program was begun in Santa Ana nine years ago to combat 
vandalism in the parks. Since the patrols began, vandalism has dropped from 
9,000 incidents a month to about 1,000, Doby said. In addition to patrolling, 
rangers also are in charge of locking restrooms and closing parks at night. 
</P>
<P>
The city also employs eight part-time rangers who will not be allowed to carry 
guns. Doby said part-timers do not patrol at night.GREG HERNANDEZ

A street-widening project on Beverly Glen Boulevard in Sherman Oaks set off a 
revolt by neighbors, who have complained to City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's 
office that the thoroughfare has been torn up by a private contractor for 10 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Small neighborhood shops complain that their business is suffering, and 
officials of a church preschool said mothers and children are forced to run 
across the busy boulevard in morning rush-hour traffic to reach the school. 
</P>
<P>
The intersection is particularly busy because Beverly Glen is one of the few 
gateways between the San Fernando Valley and the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
The southbound lane of Beverly Glen, on the west side of the street, is torn up 
for about 100 feet south from Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
One resident posted a sign about 10 days ago at the intersection, reading: 
</P>
<P>
"A Private Developer, Overland Centers, Tore Up This Street 10 Weeks Ago. Why 
Won't the City Make Them Fix It? Ask Councilman (Zev) Yaroslavsky . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The sign listed telephone numbers for both Overland and Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Yaroslavsky, who has a field office in the 14300 block of 
Ventura Boulevard, half a block east of the intersection, said the councilman's 
office did not hear about the complaints until mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
"We responded as quickly as possible," said Vivian Rescalvo, planning deputy 
for Yaroslavsky. "We did request a work schedule from the developer and let 
them know that their temporary schedule of occupancy was in jeopardy if they 
did not take care of this immediately." 
</P>
<P>
The developer said the project remains incomplete because it requires moving 
cables and telephone poles and waiting for the rain-moistened ground to dry out 
sufficiently to pour concrete on it. 
</P>
<P>
"I can only emphasize that getting this road work done has taken priority at 
all times," said Garry Sarkisian, vice president for West Coast operations of 
Oak Ridge Development Co. in West Los Angeles, the parent company of Overland 
Centers. 
</P>
<P>
She said the company hopes to pour concrete Thursday and finish the project 
next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The confrontation started when the development company opened Oak Ridge Plaza, 
a two-story brick mini-mall on the southeast corner of Beverly Glen and 
Ventura. As a condition for issuing a building permit, city officials required 
the developer to build a second lane on the west side of Beverly Glen 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The company tore up the sidewalk on Beverly Glen, leaving a four-foot gravel 
strip beside the road. It also left a large hole at the entrance to an alley 
behind stores on the south side of the 14400 block of Ventura Boulevard. 
Customers and delivery people no longer had access to the alley or to the 
parking space behind the businesses, and the operators said they have been 
suffering financially. 
</P>
<P>
Anastasios Adrianos, owner of Casa Burger on the southwest corner of Beverly 
Glen and Ventura, said his business has dropped 50% since the road work began. 
Young Kim, proprietor of Young's Cleaners a few doors down, said her shop's 
business has fallen off by 40%. 
</P>
<P>
"We get gardeners or builders who come to work for people on the hill and come 
here for breakfast and lunch," Adrianos said Tuesday. "They can't get in on 
Beverly (Glen) Boulevard because the driveway is closed, so they don't come. 
They believe everything is closed." 
</P>
<P>
"We have big trouble right now," Kim said. "Customers complain that they have 
to drive around the block two times to find parking. The customers are angry 
and so am I." 
</P>
<P>
Other problems developed at the Nurtury preschool in Sherman Oaks United 
Methodist Church at 14401 Dickens St., which is reachable only by way of the 
alley. Leilani Steelquist, administrative director of the school, said many 
mothers who could not get into the alley to drop off their children at the 
entrance were parking across the street on Beverly Glen and running their 
children across traffic to the school.

JUROR OFFERED TO FIX VERDICT IN ELECTION CASE, RECORDS SHOW; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: HE ALLEGEDLY TRIED TO HELP MICHAEL GOLAND, LATER CONVICTED OF MAKING AN 
ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN DONATION. 
</P>

A juror removed from the jury just hours before it delivered its verdict last 
week in the election law violation trial of Los Angeles businessman Michael R. 
Goland was alleged to have handed a note to Goland outside the courtroom 
offering to attempt to fix the case, a federal court transcript shows. 
</P>
<P>
Juror Barry Kuhnke of Huntington Beach is under felony investigation by the 
U.S. attorney's office. Kuhnke has been identified by prosecutors as an 
employee of the U.S. Department of Defense, working for the Defense Logistics 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
According to the transcript, Goland reported to his attorney that he was 
approached by Kuhnke in the Los Angeles Mall last Wednesday at the end of a day 
of jury deliberations and handed a note that said: 
</P>
<P>
"Michael, I can make it happen. This is the best I've been able to negotiate 
today. It is not ideal, but please tell me what is better for you. I need to 
know immediately. Show me a finger one or two. One, hung on all six counts or 
two, not guilty on Counts I, II, III, IV and VI but guilty on V?" 
</P>
<P>
After U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian was alerted that Goland said he had 
been contacted by Kuhnke, the judge dismissed Kuhnke from the jury. The 
remaining 11 jurors found Goland guilty of only Count V -- a misdemeanor in 
making a $120,000 illegal donation designed to help the 1986 reelection of Sen. 
Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) 
</P>
<P>
The transcript of the Thursday hearing concerning Kuhnke shows that he was 
advised by the judge that the allegations against him were serious and that he 
had a right to remain silent. Since then, Kuhnke has refused to talk to 
prosecutors. He could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Goland's attorney, Seth P. Waxman of Washington, told the judge at the court 
hearing into the matter that when Kuhnke first handed Goland the note, Goland 
had dropped it and "apparently refused at some level or somehow to take it," 
but that Kuhnke had "insisted" that Goland take it and read it. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman said that "a conversation ensued" between Goland and Kuhnke and that 
Goland later threw the note in the trash. Waxman said Goland later retrieved 
the note after Waxman told him that a full report had to be made to the court 
on what had transpired. 
</P>
<P>
Two possible felony violations are involved in the investigation of Kuhnke -- 
criminal contempt of court for allegedly ignoring the judge's orders to the 
jury not to contact the prosecution or defense, and general obstruction of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
Both the prosecution and defense agreed to allow the jury to continue to 
deliberate and come to a verdict with only 11 members. 
</P>
<P>
Goland has long given heavily to influence campaigns in a pro-Israel direction, 
trying either to elect candidates supportive of Israel or defeat those critical 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, he was found guilty of illegally giving $120,000 to American 
Independent Party candidate Edward Vallen, so Vallen could advertise that he 
was a better conservative than the Republican U.S. Senate candidate, Rep. Ed 
Zschau, thus siphoning votes away from Zschau and helping Cranston. Vallen 
ended up getting 109,916 votes, about 5,000 more than the margin by which 
Cranston defeated Zschau.

NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST IN SHERIDAN'S DEALINGS, OUTSIDE ATTORNEY FINDS 
</P>

<P>
An outside attorney hired by the city reported Tuesday that Councilwoman Sally 
Anne Sheridan did nothing improper when her real estate firm sold a home to the 
city attorney four months after she voted on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco attorney Joe Remcho told the City Council that the business 
transaction between City Att. Roger Grable and Sheridan's firm was legitimate 
because escrow on the home did not close until April 13. Sheridan had voted on 
his contract four months before, on Dec. 12, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
According to Remcho, there is no conflict because Sheridan and Grable's 
business relationship occurred before any vote. According to the state 
Political Reform Act, Sheridan now must abstain from decisions involving Grable 
and his law firm, Rutan &amp; Tucker, for 12 months after the April 13 escrow 
date. 
</P>
<P>
"I was vindicated," said Sheridan, who is involved in a bitter mayoral campaign 
against incumbent Mayor Larry Agran in the June 5 election. "I want to stop the 
issues in this witch-hunt and get on with the campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan and her husband, Donald Sheridan, have been partners in ReMax Realty 
of Irvine since 1984. In addition to the Grable deal, the council on Tuesday 
also discussed Sheridan's business dealings with other city employees. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Edward A. Dornan, who first raised the issue of Sheridan's business 
dealings, said he still is not convinced that Sheridan did not violate conflict 
of interest laws. 
</P>
<P>
He cited her business dealings with City Manager Paul Brady Jr. and other city 
department heads, including some who have left City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
According to a list compiled by Brady at the council's request, the Sheridans 
have bought and sold homes for 20 to 25 city employees since Sheridan's 
election to the council in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The Brady transaction occurred in June, 1988, when Donald Sheridan represented 
Brady in the sale of one home and the purchase of another. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan claims this incident is in conflict with the councilwoman's March, 1989, 
vote to hire Brady as the new city manager. Brady had been assistant city 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan said Tuesday that she received no commission from her husband's 
transactions with Brady. Although they are married and are business partners, 
she said, their financial interests are kept separate. 
</P>
<P>
"We resent this entire matter and deplore the attempt to make city staff an 
issue during this election," Brady said Tuesday in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
In explaining the law, Remcho stated: "Public officials must avoid placing 
themselves in a position in which their personal interest may come in conflict 
with their duty to the public."

TASK FORCE RECOMMENDS WAYS TO COMBAT GANGS

<P>
Following recent gang shootings in which two teen-agers were killed and an 
8-year-old boy was seriously wounded, the Mayor's Task Force on Neighborhood 
Policing presented the City Council this week with a set of recommendations to 
curb gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-member task force presented their findings to the council after a 
yearlong examination of the city's worst problems: gangs, homelessness, drugs 
and deteriorating neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The task force called for the hiring of a full-time deputy city attorney who 
would write laws requiring parents and first-time gang offenders to attend 
counseling and to hold parents of gang members financially responsible for the 
actions of their children. 
</P>
<P>
Task force chairman Howard Haas said enforcement of such laws could be an 
"administrative nightmare" but would be worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents need to take responsibility and participate in some sort of class," 
Haas said. "We have found that more and more there is a real denial that a 
child has a drug problem and is part of a gang." 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Paul M. Walters recently added four more investigators to the 
city's gang unit. The mayor's task force had requested the move. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be hiring them as quickly as possible and putting them into their 
assignments," said Walters, who added that the investigators would be 
concentrating on preventive measures. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll be able to spend more time gathering information and trying to prevent 
incidents from occurring," Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
Concerning the homeless, the task force recommended that Santa Ana enlist the 
aid of private organizations to build and maintain free public hygiene centers 
equipped with showers, toilets and washing machines. 
</P>
<P>
"It's got to be more than just an effort of the city of Santa Ana," Haas said. 
"It's got to be done with the cooperation of the entire county." 
</P>
<P>
According to official estimates, about 10,000 homeless people live in Orange 
County, and about 1,500 of those stay in Santa Ana, sleeping in public parks 
and on the Civic Center grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted to refer the task force findings to the city's Public Safety 
Committee for review. The committee's recommendations for action will be sent 
back to the council for consideration.

NEWPORT COUNCIL TO VOTE ON LAND DEAL CLEARING LIBRARY

<TEXT>
<P>
City Council members and Irvine Co. representatives are expected to finalize a 
land swap next week that would allow design work to begin on a $7-million 
central library for the city. 
</P>
<P>
The firm would give the city four acres of land northeast of the intersection 
of East Coast Highway and Avocado Avenue on which to build the library, said 
David Dmohowski, the vice president of entitlement for the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
The city would grant the two acres of land it owns in Newport Center to the 
company to make a total of five acres owned by the firm. 
</P>
<P>
The city would then grant office development rights to the company for all five 
acres in Newport Center, Dmohowski said. The firm could build a total of 67,000 
square feet of office space. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council will vote Monday on whether to finalize the swap and also be 
asked to approve a contract for design of the 50,000-square-foot library. 
</P>
<P>
The votes will culminate almost three years of talks toward establishing a new 
central library for the city. City Librarian LaDonna Kienitz said the city has 
more than outgrown the four branch libraries that now make up the system. 
</P>
<P>
The new library is expected to have more than 200,000 volumes and seating for 
200 people.

POLICE SKETCH, DOGGED HUNT PAY OFF IN KILLING;

CRIME: A SUSPECT IS CHARGED IN A YEAR-OLD SOUTH-CENTRAL L.A. MURDER AFTER TWO 
INVESTIGATORS REFUSE TO QUIT.

<P>
Month after month two detectives worked on the murder case, talking to people, 
running down leads, showing an artist's rendering of the gunman to anyone who 
would look. 
</P>
<P>
One of the local cops said it looked something like a street person named Jason 
Lovell Brown, but he was not sure. 
</P>
<P>
Further complicating things, the only known eyewitness to the crime moved and 
could not be found. 
</P>
<P>
But last month, another eyewitness finally came forward. Los Angeles police 
said that when she saw photos of Brown, she told them he was the man who shot 
Arrell Kegler to death. 
</P>
<P>
And on Tuesday, almost a year after the shooting in South-Central Los Angeles, 
Brown, 27, was formally charged with murder. 
</P>
<P>
"The work paid off," Sgt. Larry Kallestad, the detectives' supervisor at the 
South Bureau homicide division, said Tuesday with a contented sigh. "And one 
thing that helped -- that composite was a dead-bang ringer for the guy." 
</P>
<P>
The detectives -- Bill Cox and Jerry Manske -- say the crime occurred about 
2:30 a.m. last June 5, on 45th Street near Vermont Avenue. They say that when a 
young woman approached a man at the corner and asked him for a match, he 
responded by pulling a gun and robbing her of her money and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
At about the same time, the officers said, Kegler, 46, who lived in a nearby 
duplex, arrived home in his car and apparently attempted to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the Good Samaritan type," Kegler's wife, Annie, later told officers. 
</P>
<P>
Annie Kegler said she was getting ready to greet her husband at the door when 
she heard two shots. She said she rushed to a window and heard her husband 
moaning. 
</P>
<P>
"Baby, I've been shot," she said he told her. "Don't come out. Don't come out. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
Annie Kegler said she called paramedics, who rushed her husband, wounded in the 
right arm and chest, to Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center. He died two 
hours later. 
</P>
<P>
After interviewing the young woman who had been robbed, a police artist drew a 
composite sketch of the killer. 
</P>
<P>
Kallestad said an officer who patrols the area told them the picture looked a 
lot like Brown, but he could not be certain. 
</P>
<P>
"By then, we'd lost contact with the woman who had been robbed," Kallestad 
said. "We didn't have anyone who could ID him. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Finally, in mid-April, another witness . . . a female . . . came forward and 
said she'd seen it, she'd seen the crime," the sergeant said. "She was shown a 
series of photos, including Brown's. As a result of her information, Brown was 
arrested." 
</P>
<P>
Kallestad said corroboration of the identification has since been provided by 
the robbery victim, whom police were able to locate after the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Brown was charged with murder and robbery in Los Angeles Superior Court. He is 
being held without bail in County Jail.

OLSEN STILL CHASING RECORD AS FULLERTON FALLS TO TROY

D.C. Olsen would like to put the No. 13 in the back of his mind -- if anyone 
would let him. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen, Fullerton High School's catcher, is tied with Andy Ruscitto for the 
Orange County single-season home run record with 12. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting kind of tense about it," Olsen said after failing to get a home 
run Tuesday in Fullerton's 4-2 loss to visiting Troy. "Even when I'm swinging 
the bat on deck, somebody comes up behind me to tell me to go for the record." 
</P>
<P>
Troy left-hander Guy Pinelli couldn't keep Olsen from extending his season-long 
hitting streak to 24 games, but he did keep Olsen's drives inside Fullerton's 
cozy ballpark. In doing so, Pinelli helped Troy clinch at least a tie for the 
Freeway League title. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody came out to the game today to see D.C. get the record," Troy Coach 
Dane Ilertsen said. "But they saw Pinelli instead." 
</P>
<P>
Pinelli (8-2) used fastballs and sliders against Olsen, jamming them inside on 
the Fullerton junior. It was only the second time in 24 games that Olsen has 
failed to drive in a run. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen was one for three, getting a sharp single through the left side of the 
infield. He lined into a double play in the first inning and flied to deep 
right field in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
The single gave Olsen 49 hits on the season -- only two behind Robbie 
Katzaroff's 1985 county single-season mark of 51. Olsen's batting average 
dropped to .613, still higher than the 10-year-old county record of .585 set by 
Anaheim's Steve Evans. 
</P>
<P>
But Olsen will have to wait until Thursday to break any of the three records, 
when Fullerton travels to Troy for the Freeway League finale. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see him get the record," Ilertsen said. "As long as we win anyway. 
These things don't happen too often." 
</P>
<P>
Troy, led by Matt Carter's two-run homer in the first and Steve Friedrich's 
solo shot in the fifth, improved to 14-8, 11-3 in league. Troy has won 10 
consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton dropped to 12-11-1, 6-8. 
</P>
<P>
In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
Sonora 5, Sunny Hills 2 -- Marcos Pando was two for four with two runs scored 
and Tracy Kaufman was one for three with two RBIs for Sonora (12-11, 7-7) at 
Sunny Hills (14-11, 9-5). Scott Oxarart (6-6) gave up two unearned runs in the 
fourth and earned the complete-game victory. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra 2, Buena Park 0 -- Scott Veeder (4-6) allowed four hits and struck out 
five in the complete-game victory at Buena Park. Marc Patterson and Wendell 
Wickersham each had two hits for La Habra.

<P>
It was a day of almosts for the Dana Hills High School baseball team against 
Irvine Tuesday in the South Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills nearly overcame a 3-0 deficit with rallies in the sixth and seventh 
innings. Lance Marks, the Dolphins' slugging catcher, came close to becoming 
Orange County's career home run leader. 
</P>
<P>
But in the end, Dana Hills' playoff chances disappeared and Marks will have to 
wait to set the record after a 3-2 loss to Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth one-run loss in league play for Dana Hills (13-11-1, 7-7). 
Irvine (13-12, 8-6) needs another victory against Dana Hills Thursday to clinch 
third place with Mission Viejo a half-game behind. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a competitive group, and I'm proud as hell of them, but you've got to 
win some of those one-run games to make the playoffs," said Bob Canary, Dana 
Hills coach. "It's very disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
Marks entered the game tied with former Valencia standout Andy Ruscitto as the 
county's career home run leader with 22. He went two for three and had a long 
fly ball caught at the warning track in center in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
Marks hit an 0-2 fastball into a strong wind that held it up long enough for 
Irvine center fielder Mike Booker, who caught it about two feet in front of the 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
Marks will get another chance at the record Thursday and needs only one hit to 
reach 100 career hits in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Seal (6-7) established a school record for Irvine by striking out six 
batters, giving him 94 for the season. Rodney Poissant set the school mark of 
93 in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike is the best 6-7 pitcher in the county," said Bob Flint, Irvine coach. 
"Mike and Bob Hamelin are the two best competitors I have coached at Irvine. 
Nobody else comes close." 
</P>
<P>
Although Marks failed to hit the homer, Flint endorsed the senior for the 
league's most valuable player award. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the best athlete in the league," Flint said. "He's a bona fide draft 
choice with a great future ahead of him." 
</P>
<P>
In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo 5, San Clemente 0 -- Steve Evans (7-5) pitched a three-hitter and 
had seven strikeouts to lead host Mission Viejo (10-11-2, 7-6-1). Lee Williams 
hit a three-run home run in the second and Don Disbro had two hits and an RBI. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro 4, Capistrano Valley 3 -- Greg Pearce (6-2) pitched a seven-hitter and 
Chris Sauritch had two hits to lead host El Toro (19-6, 11-3). El Toro clinched 
the league title last week.

<TEXT>
<P>
Janet Miyahara, a junior right-hander coming off a two-week layoff with a 
sprained left ankle, pitched a two-hitter Tuesday as the Marina High School 
softball team defeated Fountain Valley, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
Miyahara (13-1), who transferred from Fountain Valley after her sophomore year, 
gave Marina (23-5, 8-1) sole possession of first place in the Sunset League. 
</P>
<P>
Rae Rice (15-2) took the loss for Fountain Valley (19-6, 7-2), the defending 
league co-champions with Marina. 
</P>
<P>
"(Miyahara's) changeup was her best pitch," Marina Coach Susie Calderon said. 
"She can throw it for strikes and has incredible motion. She mixed her pitches 
well. I didn't know how strong she'd be because she pushes off her bad ankle." 
</P>
<P>
Miyahara struck out three and walked one for the Vikings. She kept Fountain 
Valley's batters hitting ground balls most of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Marina scored the winning run in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
Miyahara singled to center and Becky Toler reached first on a sacrifice and a 
fielder's choice. Miyahara was tagged out at the plate on Annie Presutti's 
single to center field, but Toler reached third on Danelle Lovetro's throw. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Luft's one-out grounder to second was momentarily bobbled by Traci Werts, 
leaving only the play at first and Toler scored. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley's only threat came in the first when catcher Shannon Dolan 
singled and Rice walked. Both runners advanced a base on Lovetro's sacrifice 
bunt, but Michelle Kravik grounded out to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach 6, Westminster 5 -- Freshman Laura Minard (5-6) pitched 
no-hitter for six innings to lead Huntington Beach (6-15, 4-5). But she gave up 
four runs and five hits in the seventh inning to let Westminster (6-18, 1-8) 
back in the game. Jennifer Johnson hit a two-run triple and scored in the first 
to give the Oilers a 3-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View 2, Edison 1 (8 innings) -- Jena Sansone had three hits, two stolen 
bases and scored the winning run in the eighth to lead visiting Ocean View 
(18-8, 6-3). Edison is 7-15, 1-8.

DOWNING FINALLY GETS INTO THE SWING; 
</P>
<P>
ANGELS: DESIGNATED HITTER WALKED AND SCORED IN THE FIRST INNING AND HIT A 
TWO-RUN HOMER IN THE FIFTH TO HELP BEAT BALTIMORE.

<P>
Brian Downing's already diminished role with the Angels became even more minute 
when the team acquired outfielder Luis Polonia on April 29. But still, Angel 
general manager Mike Port insisted the 39-year-old designated hitter remained 
in good standing. 
</P>
<P>
"He's still a part of our 25-man cast," Port said this week. 
</P>
<P>
Downing, however, said he feels more like an outcast. 
</P>
<P>
For nine games, Downing sat on the bench watching the Angels lose six of nine 
games and fall to sixth place in the American League West. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't make one plate appearance. The closest he came to the action was a 
couple of trips to the on-deck circle, but he never made it to the batter's 
box. 
</P>
<P>
Downing finally got a chance to brush the cobwebs off his bat Tuesday night and 
he made the most of the opportunity, walking and scoring in the first inning 
and slamming a two-run home run in the fifth to help the Angels defeat the 
Baltimore Orioles, 6-0, at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little extra fired up tonight," said Downing, who increased his 
batting average up 10 points to .196. "I felt good. I've been swinging a bat at 
home, trying to figure out what was wrong. I felt I had something to work with, 
but you never know until you get into the fire." 
</P>
<P>
Downing, batting in his customary lead-off position, ignited the team in the 
first inning, drawing a walk off Oriole starter Jeff Ballard after starting 
with an 0-2 count and scoring on Chili Davis' home run. 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth, Downing smashed a towering, two-run home run to center field, his 
second of the season, to turn a 3-0 lead into a 5-0 bulge. Downing was happy 
about his contributions, but he didn't get overly excited. 
</P>
<P>
"One night doesn't make a year, just like one game doesn't make a season," 
Downing said. "This was a good night for us. We used a formula that worked for 
us last year -- a shutout and a few home runs -- the trick is to do it 
consistently." 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, Downing pondered his future as an Angel. Or, rather, his future as 
an ex-Angel. 
</P>
<P>
"If I knew this (the Polonia trade) was going to happen, I would have retired 
before the season," Downing said in Baltimore last week. "I'm just waiting for 
the ax to fall." 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the term "washed up" had creeped into discussions about Downing, who 
has a .271 career average in 12 previous seasons with the Angels. Downing heard 
the talk, and he didn't like it. 
</P>
<P>
"For people like me who have heard that several times in their lives, it spurs 
you to new heights," Downing said. "If you're a fighter and people say that, it 
makes you want to shove it up their ... 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes that works, and sometimes it doesn't. You just have to try as hard 
as you can, and if it works, great. If it doesn't, you have to tip your hat to 
them because they're right." 
</P>
<P>
No one around the Angel clubhouse was ready to tip their hats Tuesday night. 
Except to Downing. 
</P>
<P>
"Brian is a proven hitter," said pitcher Chuck Finley, whose three-hit shutout 
ended the team's five-game losing streak. "I don't know what the deal is with 
Brian being hurt or not, but everyone knows what he's capable of doing." 
</P>
<P>
Chili Davis, who had three hits, including his first-inning homer, was glad to 
see Downing at the top of the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"You need that intimidating force and he presents that in the lineup," Davis 
said. "He's not washed up. He still has good power, he's strong, and he's 
patient at the plate. He can start rallies and put a game out of reach with one 
swing." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, Downing did both.

JAMES FLANIGAN: IN FAST-MOVING BUSINESS FIELDS, VICTORY GOES TO THE SWIFT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Heralding good times for the personal computer business and many other 
industries, Compaq Computer recently forecast strong worldwide growth this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
But Apple Computer saw the future differently, cautioning securities analysts 
that sales growth would slow this year as the company goes through a period of 
product transition. 
</P>
<P>
"Several trends shaping the future of the computer industry" lie behind that 
difference in outlook, says analyst Bruce Lupatkin of San Francisco's Hambrecht 
&amp; Quist investment firm. They're trends, he says, that Compaq, the 
fast-growing Houston company, is positioned to exploit but which Apple, the 
renowned pioneer of the personal computer, seems slow to grasp. 
</P>
<P>
It's a situation that offers insights beyond computers, into the pace and 
requirements for success in any fast-moving business -- which is to say all 
business today. 
</P>
<P>
The personal computer industry, which remains in constant flux even after 45 
million machines have been sold, is changing profoundly again. It is shifting 
from an emphasis on stand-alone machines that offer word processing and 
spreadsheet accounting for individuals to the development of networks on which 
many users can do many things simultaneously. Architects, say, can draft plans, 
simulate structures and test stresses at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
And the direction of development is toward truly mobile computing in which 
powerful, multipurpose machines will operate on their own, communicating 
through digital cellular modems. Indeed, Business Week -- citing the example of 
a European chairman who runs a $20-billion global company with two laptop 
computers and one secretary -- reports the future is already here. 
</P>
<P>
One reason the business keeps growing -- defying predictions that the market is 
maturing -- is that accelerating technology and product development make even 
4-year-old computers obsolete, says Richard A. Shaffer, publisher of 
Technologics Computer Letter. 
</P>
<P>
And the reason technology keeps advancing, adds Shaffer, "is that business 
customers are making real gains" -- in cost reductions, profitability, 
productivity. As computing spreads through every stage of manufacturing, for 
example, productivity keeps growing -- up 4.1% in the latest figures. 
</P>
<P>
So customers are eager for the latest computer models, which deliver more power 
for the same or less money. The innovations promise to bring to personal 
computers the power now seen in the large networks that run banks, car rental 
agencies and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the innovation leader today is not Apple, the legendary Silicon Valley 
company, but Compaq, a firm that began in 1981 with a business plan written on 
a place mat in a Houston diner by three engineers from Texas Instruments. 
</P>
<P>
Compaq started life making close copies of IBM personal computers and selling 
them at a lower price. It succeeded because it gave dealers a bigger margin and 
accepted less profit for itself. Still, for years, Compaq was seen as a mouse 
endangered by an elephant -- if IBM turned on it, Compaq would be crushed. 
</P>
<P>
No more. Compaq -- now $2.8 billion in sales -- has outdone IBM in portable 
computers and is a close competitor of the giant company in the whole PC field; 
last year 29% of the personal computers sold in the U.S. market were Compaq, 
31% were IBM. Compaq's laptop computer weighs about 6 pounds with battery and 
has taken 65% of the U.S. market for such tiny but powerful machines. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the scale, Compaq has a powerful new computer that 
possesses the network characteristics of the minicomputers made by such as 
Digital Equipment and Hewlett-Packard. Compaq may not take customers from those 
big companies any time soon, but with a lower-priced machine it has a shot at 
new customers in an expanding market. 
</P>
<P>
What's Compaq's secret? It understands that in the computer business today, 
technology consists of putting together the latest chips and software and 
getting the product out the door. It does little good to have geniuses figuring 
out something new and brilliant back in the laboratory, says a top executive of 
a Compaq competitor. "If another company packages the state of the art 
technology and ships it to market, it will get the customer." 
</P>
<P>
That may be the point about Apple these days, say analysts. It spends too much 
time reflecting on past achievements -- the original Apple computers and the 
bright, easy-to-use Macintosh -- and so is not getting new Macintosh programs 
out fast enough. It now faces a challenge as competitors bring out computers 
with a program that imitates the Mac's features. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Apple -- a $5.3 billion (sales) company -- may surprise its 
critics. (On Tuesday, in fact, Apple and Digital Equipment announced joint 
development of products that will link the Macintosh in minicomputer networks.) 
In a young industry, as Bob Dylan put it in a different context, "the wheel's 
still in spin and the loser today may be later to win, for the times they are a 
changin'." 
</P>
<P>
Which brings up a final thought on the changing computer business -- that its 
very chaos constitutes vitality. The model to look at is the automobile 
industry from 1908 to 1912, when it had more than 500 companies -- new entrants 
replacing dropouts all the time. It was then a vibrant technology and business 
and didn't settle down until the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
The new shifts in personal computers -- a business continually described as 
mature -- may mean the best is yet to come.

Federal regulators voted Tuesday to slash prices on thousands of office 
buildings, shopping centers, homes and other properties seized from failed 
savings and loans, offering discounts of as much as 20% for real estate unsold 
after nine months. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be setting market values," said L. William Seidman, chairman of the 
Resolution Trust Corp., explaining the drastic change in policy designed to 
help unload the government's real estate backlog, currently valued at $16 
billion and growing with every new S&amp;L takeover. 
</P>
<P>
"The time for us to move this property out is as fast as possible," said C. C. 
Hope Jr., another member of the RTC board. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;L bailout law requires the government to sell properties in 
distressed areas -- Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana and New 
Mexico -- for no less than 95% of market value. This means that a Dallas 
property appraised at $1 million could not be sold for less than $950,000. 
</P>
<P>
The floor is 90% for real estate located in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
But federal officials, dismayed because they have sold only $2 billion worth of 
properties so far, decided that deeper cuts were needed. 
</P>
<P>
The current pricing system has been based solely on appraisal reports. However, 
RTC officials have decided that if nobody makes an offer for a property within 
six months, the asking price does not represent true market value no matter 
what the appraisal says. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, adopted 4 to 0 by the RTC board, the agency allows its 
local officials who are selling properties to offer a deep discount from 
appraised values if properties remain unsold after specified time periods. 
</P>
<P>
The policy complies with the requirements of the bailout law because it 
modifies the procedure for assessing market value rather than lowering the 
floors, Seidman noted. "We're dealing with how we determine market values; 
we're giving them flexibility," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, the official market value of a $1-million property in 
Dallas can be trimmed by as much as 15%, to $850,000, if it has not sold within 
six months. After three months more, the market value can be trimmed another 5% 
to $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, the bailout law's 95%-of-market-value rule is applied, making 
the lowest acceptable price $760,000. The government will accept any price 
above the floor established by these calculations. 
</P>
<P>
Market-value cuts of as much as 15% can be imposed immediately on properties 
that have been for sale for six months without any acceptable bids. The 
six-month waiting period will be reduced to four months for single-family 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
The policy change adds the judgment of local officials to the price set by the 
appraisal process. Appraisals "only provide an estimate of market value, and do 
not necessarily offer indisputable evidence of value," the RTC said in a policy 
document adopted by the board. "These guidelines allow the RTC some flexibility 
for determining market value." 
</P>
<P>
The new policy gives tremendous discretion to RTC officials in 14 local 
offices, who can reduce prices on properties valued up to $10 million without 
seeking higher approval. The four regional offices can handle deals up to $25 
million; anything bigger must be approved in Washington. California has one 
local office, located in Costa Mesa. The Western regional office is in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
The RTC issued a four-volume list of available properties at the beginning of 
the year, and will produce an updated directory soon. The new listings will be 
available on disks for use in computers. 
</P>
<P>
Adoption of the new policy had been delayed at the request of Comptroller of 
the Currency Robert L. Clarke, who was initially fearful that any major price 
cuts could threaten the financial health of banks, which are heavy lenders for 
real estate. 
</P>
<P>
However, Clarke, a member of the RTC board, voted for the new policy Tuesday. 
Clarke said he is convinced that the price-cutting will "not have an adverse 
effect" on any banks that are not already under government control or direction 
because of financial failings. 
</P>
<P>
The RTC board also adopted a policy allowing auctions of properties with a 
minimum price of 70% of appraised value, an even deeper discount than the 
maximum combined cuts of 20% for other properties that go unsold for nine 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Auctions will be used "as an alternative to marketing properties through local, 
regional or national brokers," the RTC said in the policy document approved by 
the board. 
</P>
<P>
The RTC does not yet have "any particular procedures or policies" for deciding 
which properties will be sold directly and which will be placed on the auction 
block, said Gary Bowen, the RTC deputy director for asset disposition. 
</P>
<P>
The first auction will be in Kansas City this summer, where the RTC hopes to 
attract an international clientele for properties appraised at more than $1 
million each, Bowen said. The total value of properties on sale will be $200 
million, the biggest single real estate auction in history, but a relative drop 
in the bucket of the government's holdings. 
</P>
<P>
The $16-billion real estate portfolio could grow to $200 billion or more, 
depending on the volume of properties held by hundreds of financially weak 
S&amp;Ls that might be seized by the government.

SEA OF CONFUSION OVER 'FRESH FISH' DEFINITION; 
</P>
<P>
FOOD: CONGRESS MAY INTERVENE WITH BILLS TO PROTECT THE SEAFOOD BUYER. 
</P>

<P>
When you walk into your neighborhood fish market or grocery store, the display 
case is filled with "fresh" swordfish, "fresh" salmon, "fresh" shrimp, "fresh" 
petrale sole. 
</P>
<P>
But then you take your catch home and find that your "fresh" filet has a frozen 
center. Or your fork finds mush instead of firm flesh. 
</P>
<P>
How long has your dinner been away from the ocean? And what has happened to it 
since it left the waves behind? 
</P>
<P>
Consumer groups contend that there is little regulation of the seafood industry 
and that shoppers should beware of what they buy and how it is sold. 
</P>
<P>
"Under current law, consumers can be misled as to fish products' freshness, its 
quality and which species it is meant to be," said Ellen Haas, executive 
director of Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, a consumer group based in 
Washington. "There are inadequate standards for labeling." 
</P>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration is charged with ensuring that food labeling is 
not false or misleading, but the agency has no definition of "fresh," no 
standards or criteria for using the term to sell food. 
</P>
<P>
"Fresh is a meaningless term as it's used in supermarkets today," said Nancy H. 
Hasselback, publisher of Seafood Business magazine. "There are deceptive 
practices everywhere, and some people label seafood fresh when they mean 
previously frozen." 
</P>
<P>
Consumers aren't the only ones confused about the fish they find. The seafood 
industry itself is at times unclear on the concept of freshness. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know or have you ever thought about how much of what we call 'fresh 
seafood sales' is really 'previously frozen'?" Russ Byerly, vice president of 
retail merchandising for the New England Shrimp Co., asked as he addressed 
retailers Tuesday at the Food Marketing Institute's annual supermarket 
convention in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"Have we misused the word 'fresh' " to cover all fish sold in special seafood 
sections of supermarkets, he asked. "I think we have." 
</P>
<P>
What consumers consider "fresh" fish is often described by the seafood industry 
in Byerly's terminology: "fresh never frozen." But even if a consumer were to 
buy fish so labeled, there is no assurance that it has seen the ocean in recent 
days. 
</P>
<P>
"The standard rule of thumb is that fish caught 10 days ago is fresh," 
Hasselback said. And that's one reason why frozen seafood can be better than 
fresh, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh-never-frozen seafood accounts for less than half of today's fresh seafood 
sales, Byerly told convention-goers. Orange roughy, snow crab, king crab and 
imported red snapper are almost always delivered frozen to the retailer. 
</P>
<P>
And shrimp, which account for about 40% of all seafood sales, are rarely sold 
fresh, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Freshness is more than just a truth-in-labeling issue, Haas said. It's a food 
safety issue, too. For what begins as a question of language becomes a question 
of food handling. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers need to know if the fish they buy has been frozen and thawed out 
because foods should not be frozen twice and then eaten. 
</P>
<P>
"You should not refreeze anything -- seafood, meat or poultry," said Tony 
Rugnetta, sales executive for Met Fisheries Inc. "If you do, you're looking for 
problems. You lose all kinds of taste, get an upset stomach, and food poisoning 
could result." 
</P>
<P>
Met Fisheries, a seafood packer and processor based in New Bedford, Mass., 
sells fresh and frozen seafood to distributors, supermarkets and food service 
businesses throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The company's specialty is flying fish to its destination within 24 hours of 
catching it. But it also sells a line of frozen filets. 
</P>
<P>
"Markets should say when a fish is previously frozen, and we suggest they do," 
Rugnetta said. "A&amp;P markets it as previously frozen along with recipes. 
(Frozen fish) is consistent in quality, price and availability." 
</P>
<P>
At Santa Monica Seafood Co., a 50-year-old firm on Colorado Boulevard, fresh 
fish has been labeled for the past six or seven years with the words "fresh 
fish not frozen." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think too many people would think fondly of buying fish they've been 
told is fresh and finding out it'd been frozen at one time," said Vincent 
Cigliano, director of operations. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has oversight responsibility for meat and 
poultry. Seafood, however, falls under the jurisdiction of the FDA, which is 
authorized to inspect food processors and fisheries for safety, cleanliness, 
proper handling and labeling, said Cynthia Leggett, FDA spokeswoman. In 
addition, the Department of Commerce oversees a voluntary inspection program 
for fish processors. 
</P>
<P>
"But we don't have the staff to inspect," Leggett said. "We have 510 
investigators in the United States, and there are 60,000 food firms." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the FDA will visit a fish processing plant once every four years 
or so. In contrast, the U.S. Department of Agriculture inspects meat and 
poultry plants daily with a staff of 10,000, Leggett said. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving labeling and inspection up to businesses and current FDA procedures is 
not enough, Haas said. Tougher legislation is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional committees are considering several bills that would address 
health concerns and tighten fish inspection and labeling. The version that 
Public Voice is pushing is the Consumer Seafood Safety Act, introduced by Sen. 
Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Rep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.). 
</P>
<P>
"This would set very strict standards for using words like 'fresh' and prohibit 
retailers from using 'fresh' unless the product meets the definition," Haas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But what's a consumer to do until such safeguards are passed? 
</P>
<P>
"Be bold," Hasselback said. "Ask to smell the fish . . . Ask where it came 
from, how it was caught." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FISH LABELING TERMS 
</P>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration is charged with keeping companies from using 
false and misleading terms in food labeling. But there are no definitions that 
cover terminology used in the sale of fish. A few pointers follow: 
</P>
<P>
Fresh -- Generally means unfrozen, but there are no criteria that define it. 
Fish labeled as fresh could have been caught as much as 10 days before purchase 
by consumers. Does not ensure that the seafood has not been frozen. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh never frozen -- Term usually used for what consumers consider to be 
fresh. Also known as not previously frozen. 
</P>
<P>
Refrigerated -- Another term used for not previously frozen. For example, Nancy 
H. Hasselback, publisher of Seafood Business magazine, used the term Tuesday as 
follows: "Fresh, or more appropriately, refrigerated, seafood can take much of 
the credit for seafood's boost in popularity during the '80s." 
</P>
<P>
Previously frozen -- Seafood that has been frozen by a fish processor and 
thawed by the retailer, either for convenience or to provide an image of 
freshness. 
</P>
<P>
Frozen at sea -- Seafood that has been frozen, usually within hours of catch, 
on factory trawlers. 
</P>
<P>
Frozen -- Could be frozen at sea or shipped to a processing plant on land for 
freezing and shipping. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
Nine bills relating to seafood safety are pending in Congress. In addition to 
tightening inspection, they would decide which federal agency would oversee the 
program. Resolution of the issue is expected this summer.

Perrier Reintroduced in Los Angeles: The Perrier was flowing freely again in 
Los Angeles area restaurants nearly three months after traces of the chemical 
benzene were discovered and forced a worldwide recall of the French bottled 
water. 
</P>
<P>
More than 165 million bottles of Perrier were recalled. On Tuesday, Perrier 
Group of America officials handed out free samples of the water at temporary 
Perrier Cafes. Perrier was reintroduced on the East Coast a few weeks ago.

Workers Disrupt Pan Am Meeting: More than 150 union employees, angry at Pan Am 
Corp.'s losses and lack of a Teamsters labor contract, jeered and threatened to 
strike during the airline company's annual meeting in Miami. Pan Am Chairman 
Thomas Plaskett said the carrier would lose money again in 1990 but added that 
losses would be "significantly" reduced due to cost-cutting measures. He also 
said the firm has been unsuccessful in finding a merger or buyout partner.

STATE'S BLACK-OWNED FIRMS THRIVE; 
</P>
<P>
MINORITIES: COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA REGISTERED A 6.7% INCREASE IN REVENUE WHILE 
THE NATIONAL AVERAGE ROSE ONLY 0.3%, A SURVEY SHOWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

While the nation's largest black-owned businesses had virtually no revenue 
growth as a group last year, such firms in California surged ahead, helping the 
state claim the title of home of the largest number of successful black 
entrepreneurs, according to a survey released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Black Enterprise magazine's latest annual list of the top 100 black-owned 
industrial and service companies contained 14 California firms -- more than any 
other state. New York, which tied California for the top spot last year, ranked 
second on the new survey with 13 firms. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate top-100 list, Black Enterprise cited the revenue leaders among 
America's black-owned automobile dealerships. Nine California dealerships made 
the list, putting California second to Michigan (12 dealerships) among the 100 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Survey statistics also showed that the revenue trend for the top black-owned 
California firms bucks the national average. Of the 200 firms on the two lists 
last year, 22 were California-based. There are now 23 California firms on the 
two top 100 lists. 
</P>
<P>
The California firms -- not counting the newcomer to the list -- had combined 
revenue of 677.2 million in 1989, an increase of 6.7% over the previous year's 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the combined revenue of the leading black firms on the two 
national top 100 lists totaled $6.81 billion in 1989 -- up a negligible 0.3% 
over 1988, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine's editor and publisher, Earl G. Graves, blamed the economic 
climate and governmental policies for the flat performance nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"A sluggish economy has wreaked havoc on major industrial sectors -- from auto 
manufacturing to finance," Graves said. "And the Reagan Administration's legacy 
of exclusion has been realized with the subsequent retrenchment of affirmative 
action plans and minority business set-aside programs." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, local black business leaders were upbeat about the 
performance of the largest California firms owned by blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"California has a diverse economy, and there are lots of opportunities," said 
Gene Hale, chairman of the 400-member Black Business Assn. of Los Angeles. 
"California hasn't had a recession in a long time, but there have been regional 
recessions in other parts of the country. The climate is right for business 
starts. Blacks are moving into different fields like high-technology." 
</P>
<P>
Traditional black business enterprises such as construction and food and 
beverage retailing still dominate the magazine's national list, accounting for 
31 of the top 100 industrial and service firms. However, the number of firms in 
fields related to computers and office supplies increased to 18 in 1989 from 13 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most successful companies in these nontraditional sectors is Advanced 
Consumer Marketing Corp., a Burlingame, Calif.-based holding company involved 
in sales of computers and garden supplies and direct mail marketing. Black 
Enterprise named the firm its "BE Company of the Year." The company ranked 13 
on the magazine's list of industrial and service companies. 
</P>
<P>
Ranking ahead of Advanced was the Los Angeles-based Gordy Co., which includes 
the entertainment operations of Motown Industries, whose record business was 
sold in 1988 to MCA Inc. and Boston Ventures. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other high-ranking California firms was Shack-Woods &amp; Associates 
in Long Beach, No. 1 in the nation on the auto dealers list. 
</P>
<P>
Retaining the top spot among industrial and service companies was TLC Beatrice 
International Holdings Co., the foods processor and distributor. The New 
York-based holding company acquired the international food businesses of the 
former Beatrice Cos. in a $985-million buyout in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
However, like many of the other companies, TLC Beatrice suffered from weak 
conditions in the economy and declining capital pools. A planned public 
offering of 35% of the company, which would have made TLC Beatrice the first 
black-owned company on the New York Stock Exchange, was withdrawn in December 
due to a sagging stock market and a weak reception by investors. 
</P>
<P>
THE BIGGEST BLACK-OWNED BUSINESSES 
</P>
<P>
The following are lists of the 10 largest black-owned industrial and service 
companies in the United States and in California as compiled by Black 
Enterprise magazine. To qualify for the list, a company must have been fully 
operational in 1989 and must be at least 51% black-owned. It must manufacture 
or own the product it sells or provide industrial or consumer services. The 
list includes the company, city where headquartered, line of business and 1989 
revenue. The California list includes the national ranking in parentheses.

The objection of federal savings and loan regulators Monday to Orange County 
developer Barry G. Hon's $967-million purchase of Landmark Land Co.'s major 
resort properties shows their growing clout under the new thrift bailout law. 
</P>
<P>
How and when S&amp;L regulators now exercise their new-found muscle have left 
thrift operators and real estate developers guessing how to comply and cope 
with strict new industry regulations enacted last August to rescue the S&amp;L 
deposit insurance system. 
</P>
<P>
While Hon thought he had met the federal thrift rules in the deal involving 
prime golf courses, tennis, resort and residential land owned by Landmark's 
main subsidiary, Oak Tree Savings Bank in New Orleans, regulators decided that 
the thrift was loaning him too much. 
</P>
<P>
"It shows again that even though a deal (appears to) meet all the requirements 
of the new law, the regulators could still force you to restructure it," said 
Lawrence Grill, chairman and president of Universal Savings Bank in Orange. 
"It's the price of being in a regulated industry." 
</P>
<P>
Now Hon and Carmel-based Landmark said they will try to find another way to 
arrange the financing and complete the deal, which involves such well-known 
properties as the Mission Hills Country Club, PGA West and La Quinta Golf &amp; 
Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
The regulators' questioning of the transaction does not surprise other thrift 
executives who also are finding it tough to operate under the thrift bailout 
law. The myriad of rules imposed by the law and enforced through tough 
regulations has reshaped thrifts more in the image of banks and has greatly 
restricted their operations. 
</P>
<P>
Institutions like Columbia Savings &amp; Loan in Beverly Hills and FarWest 
Savings in Newport Beach, for instance, have lost millions of dollars mainly 
because of the law's requirement to sell high-risk, high-yield "junk bonds" 
within five years. The requirement has helped fuel a drop in the value of their 
securities holdings. 
</P>
<P>
And thrifts like Oak Tree and Downey Savings &amp; Loan in Newport Beach have 
been ordered to get out of the real estate development business within five 
years. Downey is dismantling a highly profitable real estate operation that had 
made it the premier developer and operator of neighborhood shopping centers in 
California and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Oak Tree thought it had taken a giant step out of the real estate business by 
selling properties in three states to Hon. The thrift believed that the deal 
would not be held up by a restrictive new rule that limited the amount of money 
a thrift could loan to one borrower to 15% of the institution's capital. 
Previously, thrifts were able to lend amounts equal to 100% of capital. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators appeared to give a boost to the Hon deal and similar deals a month 
ago when they decided that the loan-to-one-borrower rule would not be invoked 
when thrifts sell property they already own and "take back paper," or 
essentially finance it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The Office of Thrift Supervision, which regulates S&amp;Ls, decided not to 
consider such financing as loans, said Paul Lockwood, an OTS spokesman. The new 
interpretation is designed to help thrifts sell the property they own and 
comply with the law sooner, he said. With regulators themselves holding 
billions of dollars in real estate from failed thrifts, many healthy S&amp;Ls 
have found it difficult to dispose of their holdings profitably. 
</P>
<P>
Still regulators decided that the credit Oak Tree would be extending to Hon was 
simply too high. At more than $750 million, the loan would represent more than 
25% of the institution's assets. 
</P>
<P>
The regulatory action is not the kiss of death, real estate analysts said. But 
the objection is forcing Hon and Landmark, a leading developer of resort and 
golf course properties, to scramble for a way to save the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
"People would make a big mistake if they think it's dead," said Kenneth D. 
Campbell, an analyst with the Montvale, N.J., real estate investment advising 
firm Audit Investments Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Hon's lawyer, Bruce A. Tester of Costa Mesa, said that the deal is "definitely 
not dead" and that Hon's five-member acquisition team is "considering every 
conceivable way" to complete the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Executives of Carmel-based Landmark were more cautious. Douglas Barton, an 
executive vice president, said it would be "hard to raise" the money needed to 
complete the first phase of the deal by the end of June. But he said the 
company will help Hon restructure the deal to try to satisfy regulatory 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators suggested that Oak Tree take more time to sell its properties and 
that it find more borrowers, Barton said. "But they had no objections to Barry 
Hon or to the values of the properties," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Barton said Oak Tree executives will meet today with federal regulators in 
Dallas to try to find out specifically what could be done to revive the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Rodman, an investment adviser with Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. in Los 
Angeles, said that Hon is still the "logical player" in the deal and that he 
will likely have to take on partners to finance the purchase. He said a number 
of Japanese companies that have purchased Landmark properties could join with 
Hon in acquiring certain California land. 
</P>
<P>
"Hon's got to act if he wants the deal," said Rodman, whose firm was retained 
by Landmark as an investment adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Tester said Hon has been deluged with calls from people who want to invest with 
him or form joint ventures on some of the properties. "The big job," he said, 
"is to sort out which calls are for real and which aren't." But he said Hon's 
plans depend on what regulators tell Oak Tree executives. 
</P>
<P>
Oak Tree also could syndicate the loan by bringing in other lenders as joint 
participants, analyst Campbell said. Since Oak Tree is required to sell the 
real estate, it may have to offer incentives, such as giving up a fraction of 
the interest rate, to participants, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell pointed out that Hon appears to be a bona fide buyer willing to put 
$200 million of his own money into the deal, half this year and half next year. 
</P>
<P>
"If Hon comes to the table with $100 million in cash in June, then it's a 
reasonable loan and should be approved," he said.

New Silicon Valley?: Japanese companies' appetite for U.S. high-technology 
companies will continue to rise despite upheavals in Japan's financial markets, 
according to a lawyer who specializes in Japan-U.S. mergers and acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa M. Kitsuta, a Newport Beach attorney who met last week with executives 
from Japan's top companies in Tokyo and Osaka, said she noticed "a tremendous 
interest in Orange County by Japanese companies" during her visit. 
</P>
<P>
"They are extremely knowledgeable of the county, which to them is the new 
Silicon Valley," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Kitsuta said the Japanese executives were particularly interested in acquiring 
or investing in companies in the biotechnology, supercomputer and semiconductor 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
And while Japanese companies' appetite for U.S. real estate has been dampened 
by upheavals in Tokyo's financial markets and a weakening of the yen against 
the dollar, Kitsuta said there remains strong interest in Orange County real 
estate.

FRAUD: COUNTY CONSUMERS LOSE $500,000 A YEAR TO CAR DEALERS WHO ILLEGALLY TURN 
BACK THE NUMBERS, SAYS THE DMV.

Kamran Afrafiabi specialized in buying high-mileage used cars at cut-rate 
prices at auctions. He would then return to his Anaheim car dealership and 
advertise the cars in newspapers and auto trade publications. 
</P>
<P>
The only problem, state authorities say, is that Afrafiabi was rolling back the 
odometers. Cars with 80,000 miles or more on them had odometer readings of 
about 30,000. Buyers would pay up to $2,000 too much for cars that were on 
their last legs. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on a tip from a disgruntled customer who bought a car from Afrafiabi, 
the state Department of Motor Vehicle began investigating the Anaheim car 
dealer. That investigation led to his arrest on April 9. 
</P>
<P>
Afrafiabi, 28, of Laguna Niguel, Tuesday pleaded not guilty to 12 counts of 
grand theft. A pretrial hearing in North Orange Municipal Court in Fullerton 
has been set for June 13. 
</P>
<P>
Afrafiabi and his attorney, John D. Barnett, both declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, a dozen odometer fraud scams have been uncovered in Orange 
County. Dozens more go undetected, DMV investigators say, adding that there has 
been an upswing in odometer tampering in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"People are realizing that there's a lot of money to be made," said Rande King, 
senior special investigator with the DMV. "Mileage is the biggest factor in 
value." 
</P>
<P>
According to the DMV, Orange County car buyers lose more than $500,000 a year 
due to odometer tampering. The $500,000 figure, investigators said, is an 
estimate based on Orange County automobile registrations and car sales. 
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that odometer fraud costs consumers $8 billion a year 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Al Caruso, an area commander for the DMV's investigative office in Irvine, says 
that illegal odometer tampering operations form "a pretty tight network, almost 
like selling drugs. There's a market out there for good used cars. Most of the 
cars (whose odometers) are spun these days are former lease vehicles, where 
they have really put on a lot of miles." 
</P>
<P>
Caruso said odometer fraud is high on the list of priorities for the DMV's 
investigation unit. There are 31 districts statewide that handle odometer 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
To help control odometer fraud, the DMV last year began a program of random 
highway checks of tractor-trailers transporting cars from out of state. 
</P>
<P>
DMV investigators record the vehicle's identification number and mileage at the 
check points. They record the ID number in a computer, then track the vehicle 
to see to which dealer it was sent and to whom it was sold. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is any tampering with the odometers, we're able to retrace the 
correct mileage and check with the new owner of the cars," Caruso said. "We're 
trying to make it very clear to the auto industry outside of California that we 
will not tolerate odometer spinning." 
</P>
<P>
The DMV has identified more than 300 odometer tampering cases within the past 
year in California. 
</P>
<P>
About two years ago, the federal law was changed to make odometer tampering a 
felony offense instead of only a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
Since most dealers don't provide records of previous owners, there are few easy 
ways for customers to know that they have purchased a car with an altered 
odometer reading. Most don't find out until the engine gives out or other 
breakdowns occur, said King of the DMV. 
</P>
<P>
Car dealers say that odometer tampering is a big problem and that they are 
particularly wary of vehicles received from out of state. 
</P>
<P>
"If a dealer is suspicious, he can check things out for himself. He can call 
the owner and ask what the odometer read," King said. If the readings don't 
match up, he suggests that the dealer contact the DMV. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty tough to identify if an odometer had been rolled back," said Jim 
Upp, executive director of the Motor Car Dealers Assn. of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless the guy was dumb enough to leave old stickers from an oil change or 
something that (indicates) the mileage, it's hard for dealers to detect it," 
Upp said.

IRVINE POPULAR WITH JAPANESE BUSINESS PEOPLE, SURVEY FINDS

Irvine, which is home to two major Japanese manufacturers, ranks among the 
three most popular areas for Japanese business people to live in the Southland, 
according to a survey by the Japan Business Assn. of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted in January, calculates the number of 
Japanese-nationalbusiness people's children enrolled in Southern California 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Two other areas popular with Japanese business people are the city of Arcadia 
and the South Bay area. 
</P>
<P>
In a similar survey in 1975, the association said, Los Angeles and Gardena were 
the favored locales for Japanese nationals. 
</P>
<P>
"Japanese families tend to live in districts with good schools and in areas 
where elementary and high school education are simultaneously provided," said 
Mayumi Sakai, executive director of the association, a nonprofit group 
representing 642 Japan-based companies doing business in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Sakai noted that a number of Japanese companies have located offices and 
manufacturing plants in Orange County during the past decade. Toshiba Corp. and 
Ricoh Co. Ltd. have major manufacturing plants in Irvine, and several other 
Japanese firms have smaller operations in Irvine and surrounding cities. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular schools for children of Japanese business people in Irvine are 
Culverdale Elementary School, College Park Elementary and Vista Verde 
Elementary, the association said.

SERVICE WOULD KEEP ID OF A CALLER CONFIDENTIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Beverly Hills lawyer has begun selling a service aimed at circumventing 
controversial "caller identification" systems that reveal callers' phone 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Such systems are not yet available in California, but Pacific Bell officials 
say they will propose offering a feature that will conceal phone numbers for 
free. Meanwhile, some law enforcement officials see the new private service as 
possibly impeding criminal investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Caller identification allows recipients of phone calls to view the telephone 
number from which incoming calls originate. About 100,000 telephone users on 
the East Coast have signed up for such a service offered by Bell Atlantic, a 
regional phone firm. The owners of 800 and 900 lines also have the option to 
buy such services. 
</P>
<P>
The service can cut down on harassing phone calls and allows users to screen 
out unwanted callers, phone company officials say. Taxi cab companies and 
delivery firms can use the service to verify phone numbers, cutting down on 
false orders. 
</P>
<P>
The systems, however, have been criticized by many for violating the privacy of 
callers who don't want their numbers revealed or who have paid extra to get 
unlisted phone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Enter attorney William F. Dwyer II, co-founder of Private Lines, along with 
Marvin Rudnick, a former Justice Department attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Callers who want to remain anonymous dial Private Lines' 900 service: 
1-900-STOPPER for domestic calls or 1-900-RUNWELL for international calls. The 
caller, who pays $2 a minute for domestic calls and $5 for international calls, 
punches in the phone number he wants to reach and is connected via the service. 
</P>
<P>
A caller identification system would display only the Private Lines number, 
said Dwyer, who said his company will will not match incoming and outgoing 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
The telephone bill of Private Line customers would only show calls made to the 
900 line and not the number of the person or company that was eventually 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the genius of it," said Dwyer, who noted the service will help 
businessmen shield their telephone calls from corporate spies or attorneys. "I 
think it will make it a tougher job for a litigator to get into the privacy of 
people by subpoenaing their phone records." 
</P>
<P>
But that same feature could also frustrate law enforcement officials who often 
rely on phone records to show relationships between suspects, says Allen Field, 
who heads the major fraud division of the Los Angeles County District 
Attorney's Office. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious that we have to see what problems it would create," said Field. 
"I can't think of a legitimate reason for this service." 
</P>
<P>
Blocking caller identification does not sit well with the phone companies that 
sell the service. 
</P>
<P>
"We have taken a stand against blocking," said Sandra Granzow, spokeswoman for 
Bell Atlantic. "We believe that all numbers should be passed to the people who 
are receiving the call." 
</P>
<P>
Legislation in California will require phone companies to allow callers to 
shield their numbers from identification systems. Pacific Bell said it will be 
a few years before it can offer call identification and a free sister service 
-- Per Call Privacy. 
</P>
<P>
"Per Call Privacy will enable the customers to prevent their phone number from 
being displayed," said Pacific Bell spokeswoman Lissa Zanville. "By pressing a 
combination of three digits, they can decide per call if they can have their 
number displayed."

IRWINDALE LENS PRODUCER SUES FEDERAL AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA DARNELL WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Irwindale-based manufacturer of high-technology artificial lenses that 
replace natural lenses following cataract surgery on Tuesday sued the federal 
government to overturn the Medicare reimbursement rate for the lenses. 
</P>
<P>
In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, Ioptex Research 
Inc. alleged that the Department of Health and Human Services' Health Care 
Financing Administration violated federal law when it set a flat $200 
reimbursement rate to ambulatory surgical centers for all intraocular lenses 
they use. 
</P>
<P>
Executives of Southern California companies, which represent 75% of the 
nation's intraocular lens industry, have been trying since 1988 to prevent 
implementation of the rate. They contend that the rate, which became effective 
on March 12, is too low. 
</P>
<P>
Since most cataract surgery is performed on elderly people eligible for 
Medicare benefits, the Medicare reimbursement rate is critical to the success 
of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Ioptex's court complaint said HCFA relied on an "outdated and scientifically 
flawed" report to establish the payment rates for intraocular lenses. 
</P>
<P>
Ioptex President Joseph Mandato said in an interview that the federal agency 
audited 28 of some 500 ambulatory surgical centers and chose to set the rate 
based on prices for lenses paid by the 11 centers with the lowest-cost lenses. 
It did not take into account the cost of making different types of lenses, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mandato said the industry is very competitive and the centers paying the lower 
prices were getting generic, out-of-style lenses. Ioptex, a subsidiary of 
Britain's Smith+Nephew PLC, with revenues of $57 million a year, sells standard 
intraocular lenses. But 60% of its lenses are high-technology lenses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The $200 uniform rate "unreasonably depresses the reimbursement rate for 
high-technology lenses," thereby making it impractical for ambulatory surgical 
centers to buy them, the complaint said. It added that Ioptex will be harmed 
unless Medicare sets a rate that is "accurately based on the reasonable cost" 
of the class of lenses sold by Ioptex and other manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
The suit asks for an injunction barring the new rate and a directive for 
Medicare to establish a rate for different classes of lenses. Additionally, it 
seeks retroactive reimbursement to surgical centers for the "reasonable" cost 
of lenses they purchased after March 12.

earned in the first quarter totaled $118.4 million, up 6% from first-quarter 
1988. Results are net of a provision representing the firm's estimate of the 
potential impact of premium refund liability under the rate rollback mandated 
by the 1988 California insurance initiative, Proposition 103.

3 FACULTY COMPOSERS PRESENT NEW WORKS AT UC IRVINE

Varied works, each written within the past year, by three UC Irvine faculty 
composers revealed a broad mix of simple tonality and atonality Monday night at 
the Fine Arts Concert Hall on campus. The presentation provided sporadic 
interest mingled with more routine, unadventurous moments. 
</P>
<P>
The evening's only premiere, Bernard Gilmore's "La Folia" for solo violin, 
juxtaposes snippets from various settings by Frescobaldi, Marais and others of 
the popular 17th-Century dance in the title, creating an eclectic collage. 
Sustained, soul-searching passages comment between the quotes, finally 
transforming into an engagingly grotesque dance of their own, far removed from 
the original theme. 
</P>
<P>
A careful blend of idiomatic writing and detail, Gilmore's music never sits 
still stylistically, but fits together lucidly, though not always with 
convincing originality. Violinist Haroutune Bedelian gave the piece superb 
attention, seamlessly moving from one remote idea to the other. 
</P>
<P>
Four green-gowned members of the Terry Lewis Dance Ensemble swooned and swayed 
to Paul Hodgins' electronic score "At Delphi," a generally understated, spooky 
setting of an ancient Greek ritual involving a virgin under the intoxicating 
effect of laurel leaves. Blunt choreography gives the piece a mild feminist 
theme, though the overall attempts to be more ecstatic than intellectual do not 
always achieve the pagan sensibility intended. 
</P>
<P>
John Gerhold's "For Paula," a four-part tonal cycle for soprano, oboe and 
piano, sets stream-of-consciousness texts by the composer expressing his 
various feelings towards taking care of his 2-year-old daughter. The overt 
simplicity of the music and words proved cloying, projecting the joy and other 
emotions of fatherhood but not with a satisfactory level of sophistication. 
</P>
<P>
Opening the evening, pianists Betty Oberacker and Kary Kramer, a professor of 
music and a student at UC Santa Barbara respectively, delivered a 
lecture-recital of piano music by faculty composers from seven different UC 
campuses. Although their intentions were laudable, the presentation proceeded 
woodenly, touting each composer without much depth, using information too 
technical for the layman, too cursory and incomplete for the scholar.

OCC PLAY PUTS FACES ON CHERNOBYL'S FATALITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Vladimir Gubaryev, a science editor for Pravda, the Soviet Union's state-run 
newspaper, was reportedly so disturbed by the Chernobyl nuclear accident that 
he wrote "Sarcophagus" in a fury of emotion and ambition. His play seems to 
have two worthy, far-reaching objectives: to dramatize the human pain of the 
worst nuclear catastrophe ever and to examine the specifics of misfeasance and 
malfeasance that led up to it. 
</P>
<P>
These twin concerns don't always link gracefully in "Sarcophagus," but the work 
has an impact. It holds our attention by putting men's faces on the fatality 
figures as we watch plant workers and firefighters after the reactor explosion, 
slowly succumbing to radiation sickness in an isolated hospital ward. Forgiving 
"Sarcophagus" its often-confusing and talky investigative side does not require 
too much generosity. 
</P>
<P>
At Orange Coast College, a cast of students and more experienced actors, 
including OCC instructors, tap into the play's humanist element while 
maintaining a naturalistic balance. Director Joan McGillis keeps everything 
reined in, although she does let Steven Lee Shults take too many liberties with 
Bessmertny, a young patient who is on the ward before the reactor explodes. 
</P>
<P>
Shults and McGillis both seem to see the wry Bessmertny, who has survived 
longer than expected after passing out drunk in a lab during a radiation 
experiment, as a symbol of hope, the manifestation of will. Shults plays him 
with compassion, but the depth of the character prompts Shults to reach further 
than he should. 
</P>
<P>
"Sarcophagus" opens with Bessmertny's reflections on the uniqueness of his 
experience: At this point, he's a lone victim, and the threat of radiation 
seems to have limited scope. But with the reactor explosion, the danger expands 
and seems to take on the entire globe. Bessmertny realizes this, and the 
audience is expected to follow his lead. 
</P>
<P>
Soon the ward is crowded with victims, each assigned to a tiny cubicle, where 
his vital signs are monitored. There's a red light above the room: When it 
blinks, the nurses rush in; when it goes out, another man has died. The 
patients talk about the accident and their lives, most of them brave in their 
understanding that even bone marrow transplants are unlikely to save them. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Gubaryev turns reporter, bringing in an investigator assigned to find 
out what happened. We hear accusations concerning lax safety conditions at the 
plant, no protective gear for firefighters, incompetent training. There's a 
blurry contention that there was pressure to open Chernobyl ahead of schedule, 
possibly when it wasn't ready. These points are intriguing, but "Sarcophagus" 
presents them in a scattered way. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's the introduction of an American surgeon (obviously based on 
Robert Gale, who flew to Chernobyl shortly after the accident), giving Gubaryev 
the opportunity to make a plea for more superpower cooperation. You can't fault 
that, but it seems forced and preachy in this context. 
</P>
<P>
Except for Bessmertny, there are no major roles. Within the ensemble, there are 
decent performances, including Eric Person's as a courageous technician; Sharr 
White's as a naive, romantic fireman; Bryan S. Luterman's as a plant physicist, 
and Joyce Eriksen and Alex Golson's as Soviet surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
The production is aided by David Scaglione's deliberately indifferent-looking 
set of the icy-white ward, and by Ponzer Berkman and F.H. Furness' provocative 
lighting. 
</P>

WEST COAST SERIES A MIXED BAG OF ONE ACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If a festival of one-act plays is doing its job, it should allow us to sample 
vigorous and completely different voices. Not like a "Best of" anthology, but 
like a testing ground where some experimentation can take place. 
</P>
<P>
We sampled Series C of the West Coast Ensemble's "Sixth Celebration of One 
Acts" on Saturday, in the hopes of finding something exciting. Patrick Cleary's 
"Circles of Time" was an exercise in an extended dialogue between divorcees who 
happen to run into each other at a train station. We wait for the trains to 
arrive so the dialogue can end (Megan Foley directed Patrick Pankhurst and 
Cynthia Steele). 
</P>
<P>
Then things got exciting. Lisa Loomer worked up the nerve to concoct a 
10-character, multiscene, mini-epic titled "Chain of Life" that owes as much to 
the metafiction of Donald Barthelme and Don DeLillo and underground comics as 
it does to theater. Loomer's tale is about how TV can rule people's lives, from 
the scriptwriting partners who must face heart bypass surgery (Richard Large 
and Ben D'Aubery) to a producer/agent hooked on Terry Cole Whittaker tapes 
(Richard Israel, too young for the role) to a mother and daughter who live in 
front of the tube (Janet Lambert and Ashley M. Sparks). 
</P>
<P>
Loomer zig-zags between them, showing the loony process from pitch to broadcast 
of a "Vietnam/hospital/cop dramedy." This is just a warm-up for the entrance of 
filmmaker Alejandro Maldonowski (Dane Christopher, in a cutting spoof of 
real-life filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky), who claims to be more interested in 
animals than people. That's how he seduces Sparks, who tends to a horse stable, 
and Israel, who likes the box-office numbers on Maldonowski's latest movie 
("Animals are fresh!"). 
</P>
<P>
This is house-of-mirrors theater (as opposed to kitchen sink theater) where 
excess is the name of the game, and the moral creeps up on you from behind. 
Sharon Lee Connors' direction, placing the action into separate squares of 
space like a comic strip, makes it all seem to take place in about five 
minutes. This is what a festival is all about. 
</P>
<P>
A festival is also about going from the comic to the grim, and expecting the 
audience to follow along. This is just what happened with the final entry, 
Martin Zurla's "Grandfather," a very grim look at the Holocaust's legacy. 
</P>
<P>
Zurla's drama hinges on a secret that every audience member should swear not to 
reveal upon exiting the theater, but "Grandfather" has some serious problems 
with build-up. His characters -- a grandfather (Alfred Rose, very Old World), a 
grandmother (Billye Wallace, who should be very Old World but isn't) and a 
grandson (Aleksey Lazaryev, very stilted) -- speak in complete sentences 
without contractions, and play chess in an outdoor patio. 
</P>
<P>
Dull, but life can be dull until someone is forced to admit a lie. Steven 
Avalos' direction makes less dramatic fire out of the moments of truth than is 
potentially in Zurla's script, but it sends us away thinking. A festival should 
do that as well. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6240 Hollywood Blvd., tonight at 8 p.m., then rotating with Series A and B, 
Tuesdays through Sundays until June 10. $12; (213) 871-1052.

CHAMBER GROUP IS OFFERING WORKS RARELY HEARD IN O.C.; 
</P>
<P>
ELLIOTT CARTER IS SELDOM PERFORMED, BUT HIS "NIGHT FANTASIES" AND DUO FOR 
VIOLIN AND PIANO WILL BE HEARD IN NEWPORT AND ORANGE.

<TEXT>
<P>
By many lights, Elliott Carter, at 81, is the pre-eminent living and working 
American classical music composer. 
</P>
<P>
Two Pulitzer Prizes, two Guggenheim Fellowships, an American Prix de Rome and a 
New York Music Critics Circle Award are among many honors his countrymen have 
bestowed on him. 
</P>
<P>
Stravinsky, no sluggard in the innovation and importance departments, 
considered Carter's Double Concerto, composed in 1961, the "first true American 
masterpiece." 
</P>
<P>
His Violin Concerto was premiered May 2 by the San Francisco Symphony with 
soloist Ole Boehn. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Orange County audiences have had few opportunities to hear Carter's music 
live. 
</P>
<P>
The Southwest Chamber Music Society will provide several opportunities when it 
offers two Carter works -- "Night Fantasies" for piano and the Duo for violin 
and piano -- in concerts Thursday at Chapman College in Orange and Saturday at 
the Newport Harbor Art Museum in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most important ideas of Carter's music is the confrontation of 
opposing forces," the group's founding director Jeff von der Schmidt said last 
week. "In 'Night Fantasies,' that whole relationship is internalized, because 
there is only one performer. But in the Duo, the protagonist-antagonist, 
hero-heroine relationship is perfected." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, at the first performances of the Duo, which was commissioned by the 
New York Philharmonic, the players sat about 30 feet apart to emphasize the 
contrasts. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not a successful solution," von der Schmidt admitted, "but it 
underscores a dramatic sense of these opposing forces, that sense of drama that 
will help any listener love Carter's music." 
</P>
<P>
Widely regarded as a successful maverick who, unlike many other contemporary 
composers, did not build his reputation by staying within an academic 
institution, Carter nonetheless holds honorary doctorates from no fewer than 
nine universities and conservatories. 
</P>
<P>
He began composing in the '30s, but his distinctive style began to emerge in 
1951 with his First String Quartet, when he decided to kick over writing to 
please anyone but himself. 
</P>
<P>
The music that followed that decision has been cited -- and criticized -- for 
its immense complexity and density of texture. 
</P>
<P>
But it has also wafted Carter to lofty artistic heights and brought him the 
financial security -- rare for a classical composer -- of being able to pick 
and choose from among a host of commissions offered him. 
</P>
<P>
Getting others to love Carter's music is clearly part of von der Schmidt's 
mission. Images start tumbling into the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
"The opening (of the Duo) is very much like a man trying to climb a glacier," 
von der Schmidt said. "The piano is very static, and the violin is very 
changeable." 
</P>
<P>
The work, dedicated to Carter's wife, Helen, also is "literally about love," he 
ventured. 
</P>
<P>
"It is most appropriately perceived as the communication between two sleepers 
at night, as dreams come and go," he said. "Sometimes a dream is nightmarish; 
sometimes it is very Pucklike." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he called "Night Fantasies" a "song cycle without words . . 
. in the long tradition of solo piano music that is reflective and quiet." 
</P>
<P>
"Even though these works are sometimes very difficult to play, the end result 
is a type of reflection," von der Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
Other examples of the type include Ives' Concord Sonata and Copland's Sonata, 
but also Schumann's "Papillons" and "Kreisleriana." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Carter works very much like a classical composer, "chiseling out his 
material from specific intervals and grouping them together," von der Schmidt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In "Night Fantasies," the intervals are consonant ones -- perfect fourths and 
perfect fifths. In the Duo, "he works different combinations of intervals that 
the (piano and violin) do or do not share. That will apply to the rhythmic 
schemes as well." 
</P>
<P>
But von der Schmidt said he hopes that the music will triumph over mere 
appreciation of its technical achievements. 
</P>
<P>
"In human, emotional terms," he said, "Carter's music is extremely reflective 
of our own time, in that all of us have more than one thing on our minds at any 
time. Call-waiting is a normal example of how the world has forced us into a 
position of thinking of more than one thing at a time. Carter reflects that in 
his own music." 
</P>
<P>
The composer's discipline "very much ensures that there is no anarchy involved. 
</P>
<P>
"If the performance is precise," he continued, "one will have the sense of 
energy and excitement in the same way, in the same sense of building, as in a 
Beethoven string quartet." 
</P>
<P>
Von der Schmidt conceded that there are moments when Carter's music can sound 
chaotic. When Carter brings all his compositional elements together, the result 
can seem "like the big bang," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's the point from time to time," he said. "And if listeners 
(sometimes) feel in a middle of a whirl of sound, they can trust that Carter's 
sense of timing and drama will reward them with moments of extreme stillness 
and calm. He knows how to balance music that is very active and music that is 
very serene. 
</P>
<P>
"Carter to me is most emotional when the texture is simple. The difficulty is 
that people expect the texture to be simple at all times, that perception can 
be without effort. But there is nothing for them to be afraid of." 
</P>
<P>
 Works by Elliott Carter will be played on Southwest Chamber Music Society 
concerts at 8 p.m. on Thursday at Salmon Recital Hall, Chapman College in 
Orange; and at 8 p.m. on Saturday at Newport Harbor Art Museum, 850 San 
Clemente Drive, Newport Beach. Completing the programs will be piano quartets 
by Mozart and Schumann. Tickets at both locations: $12. Information: (213)

Newsday said it suspended columnist Jimmy Breslin for two weeks without pay for 
racial and sexual insults against a reporter of Korean descent. 
</P>
<P>
"Last Friday's outburst by Jimmy Breslin was ugly and outrageous and I'm sorry 
that it took place," New York Newsday editor Don Forst said in a statement. 
Breslin had launched into a tirade in the newsroom after reporter Ji-Yeon Mary 
Yuh, 25, criticized his May 3 column as sexist in an internal computer message. 
The 61-year-old Pulitzer Prize-winning writer later apologized to the staff.

Some of the medical equipment that washed up along a 12-mile stretch of San 
Diego County shoreline was distributed by a Department of Defense supply depot 
in Tracy in Central California, Navy officials said. But it is unclear which 
military branch may have generated the waste and who dumped it. 
</P>
<P>
The Tracy depot is the same facility identified as the source of medical debris 
that washed up on beaches in Orange and San Diego counties in 1988. The waste 
that recently drifted ashore included three injectors of atropine, used as an 
antidote to nerve gas and considered a serious public hazard. Also found were 
100 vials of penicillin and several hundred strips of anti-malaria pills. 
Health officials warned beach-goers about the injectors, which immediately 
inject atropine when placed against the skin. The drug elevates the heart rate 
and can induce delirium.

Great Republic Insurance Co. announced that it is canceling health insurance 
policies sold as small group plans that serve 10,000 of its 60,000 California 
customers. Company Vice President James O'Hanlon said in Seattle that the 
decision followed discussions with California insurance regulators who 
indicated that the company had inadequate surplus reserves to support the 
amount of premiums it was collecting from its policyholders. Those canceled can 
either obtain insurance with another company or, under the law, buy a 
conversion policy that offers fewer benefits at higher premiums.

An electrical engineer was convicted of beating his wife and 13-month-old 
daughter to death with an empty champagne bottle. 
</P>
<P>
But Orange County Superior Court Judge Francisco P. Briseno -- who found Joseph 
Lynch, 44, guilty on two counts of second-degree murder in the deaths of his 
wife, Helen, 35, and their daughter, Natalie Alexandra -- ruled the defendant 
was insane when he committed the crimes in the family's Santa Ana home. Deputy 
Dist. Atty. James Cloninger said Lynch will be eligible for release from a 
state mental hospital when "his sanity is restored."

THESE JOCKS ONCE RULED BOSS ANGELES; 
</P>
<P>
BROADCASTING: KHJ BOSS RADIO MADE HISTORY 25 YEARS AGO. TONIGHT, DEEJAYS AT THE 
DEFUNCT STATION WILL REUNITE.

They were more than just the kings of the radio dial. They were more than just 
No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
They were Boss. 
</P>
<P>
More accurately, they were the Boss Jocks, spinning those Boss Hits for an 
adoring, young and huge Boss Radio audience in Boss Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Even some of their names had more than a hint of Bossness to them -- the Real 
Don Steele, Humble Harve, Dave Diamond, Sam Riddle, Walt Baby Love, Charlie 
Tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, the Beatles were fighting for chart space with the Mamas &amp; the 
Papas and Dylan. Young people were becoming angrier about the Vietnam War and 
civil rights. Motown was in its glory days. It was a perfect time for rock 'n' 
roll, and a perfect time for KHJ/Boss 30 radio to make history. 
</P>
<P>
Those days live only in memory. But tonight, at least, the Boss is back in 
town. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 disc jockeys from the KHJ Boss Radio era are scheduled to gather at 
the J.W. Marriott Hotel in Century City for a 25th anniversary reunion gala. 
The occasion marks the opening night of the annual Radio and Records trade 
magazine convention. 
</P>
<P>
Among some of the other well-known jocks expected to attend are Shadoe Stevens, 
Johnny Williams, Charlie Van Dyke, Roger Christian and Gary Mack. 
</P>
<P>
More than just a time for memories and toasts, the sold-out event will pay 
tribute to the fast-paced format of KHJ, which had a lasting influence on rock 
radio -- much to the chagrin of radio fans who would like more variety and less 
rigidity in radio programming. 
</P>
<P>
The KHJ format was distinguished by fast-talking jocks, a limited amount of 
commercials, a cappella jingles by the Johnny Mann Singers, a Top 30 playlist 
instead of a Top 40, and the promise of "much more music." Groups such as the 
Byrds and Sonny and Cher would show up at the Melrose Avenue studio, begging 
the jocks to play their records. 
</P>
<P>
The success of the station even spilled over onto television, with dance shows 
such as "Groovy" and "9th Street West" featuring teens dancing to the Doors and 
Steppenwolf. Riddle, Steele and Robert W. Morgan became popular video 
personalities as well as audio stars. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the most influential station in America," said Morgan, 48, who is now 
the morning personality on KMPC-AM (710) in Los Angeles. "There was a lot of 
circus elements put into the format, but it was all tempered with discipline. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea it would have this long-term impact. We were too busy doing it 
to deal with the historical significance of it all." 
</P>
<P>
At the time that KHJ introduced its accelerated format in May, 1965, the 
5,000-watt, RKO-owned station attracted less than 2% of the Los Angeles radio 
audience. But by October of the same year, the station was ranked No. 1, with 
more than 15% of the radio audience. 
</P>
<P>
The station was the brainchild of programming consultant Bill Drake and program 
director Ron Jacobs. Morgan praised Jacobs for coming up with "100 ideas a day" 
and Drake for "picking out the two best." 
</P>
<P>
During an interview earlier this week, Drake, who eventually became the head of 
Drake-Chenault, a national radio programming and consulting firm, still 
exhibited pride in his creation. 
</P>
<P>
"We cleaned up AM radio," he said. "We put everything in its place. It was 
radio that was designed for the listener. Before us, disc jockeys would just 
ramble on incessantly." 
</P>
<P>
On KHJ, everything was loosely mapped out. Commercials and songs were 
specifically timed and programmed, and the jocks were trained to keep their 
chatter to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
"We got rid of the diarrhea of the mouth," said Humble Harve, who is now at 
KRLA-AM (1110). "We trimmed the fat off the meat, so you only heard the meat." 
</P>
<P>
"There was an electricity to working at KHJ," said Riddle, 50, who is now the 
producer of the successful "Star Search" television show. He said tonight's 
gathering would be similar to a high school reunion. 
</P>
<P>
He added, "It's going to be strange, because I really haven't thought about 
radio since 1971," when he left KHJ to pursue a career in television. "But it's 
the reason why I am where I am today." 
</P>
<P>
The other jocks are in other places today, although many of them are still in 
broadcasting. Tuna and Steele are disc jockeys on KODJ-FM (93.1). Diamond is 
chairman of the communications department at Morningside College in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
KHJ no longer exists. The Boss Radio format floundered in the 1970s, and the 
station was unable to regain its popularity despite half a dozen format 
changes. The station became KRTH-AM (930) in 1986, with an oldies format. 
</P>
<P>
Although some get together occasionally, the jocks do not socialize often. 
Before they posed together Monday for a special pre-ceremony picture, Morgan 
and Riddle had not seen each other in 20 years, even though they work only a 
few blocks from each other. 
</P>
<P>
The jocks will be allowed during the program to share their own special 
memories of KHJ. Morgan recalled one bizarre experience when he and Mama Cass 
delivered puppies to contest winners out in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"It was 110 degrees, we were in this limo and all these puppies were in the car 
while Mama Cass ate cheeseburgers," he said.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: ANDY ROONEY, BACK ON TOP, HERO IN DEMAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Applause thundered through the hotel ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
The speaker at the podium was Andy Rooney. The Andy Rooney. Remember? Accused 
of slurring blacks -- denied it. Accused of slurring gays -- acknowledged it. 
Suspended by CBS for three months and deleted from "60 Minutes." Reinstated by 
CBS after three weeks and returned to "60 Minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Andy Rooney, landing on his feet. 
</P>
<P>
It's impossible to assess merely from watching "60 Minutes" how America regards 
the post-Rooneygate Rooney. So you look for evidence elsewhere, perhaps finding 
it at the Century Plaza Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The enthusiastic reception given him Monday night at a dinner sponsored by the 
Constitutional Rights Foundation (Rooney was keynote speaker) affirmed his 
status as another of America's prominent yo-yos. 
</P>
<P>
You just can't keep a good celebrity down, no matter his or her offense. 
</P>
<P>
Consider that on the very night Rooney was addressing an audience of about 
1,000 in Century City (he would speak to the Hollywood Television and Radio 
Society the next day), Richard Nixon, the Richard Nixon, was on CNN's "Larry 
King Live" speaking to millions. The latter was one of those mutual back 
scratchings peculiar to the way media, especially TV, do business, with King 
using Nixon to entertain his audience and Nixon using King to advertise his new 
book. 
</P>
<P>
Consider also, meanwhile, that Ollie North continues to hit the speakers' 
circuit masquerading as a hero despite his Iran-Contra-related conviction, that 
arrogant Zsa Zsa Gabor's talk-show clout was enhanced by her cop-slapping 
incident and that even Jimmy Swaggart -- after disclosure of his alleged visits 
to a prostitute -- continues to star in his own TV show, voice still cracking, 
lip still quivering. 
</P>
<P>
This is not necessarily to lump Rooney with any of these people or to equate 
his infractions with theirs, only to note that like them, he appears to have 
rebounded from self-inflicted adversity, flicking it away like a piece of lint 
on his lapel. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Nixon, Rooney did not betray America and feed growing cynicism about 
government and national leaders. And unlike North, Gabor and Swaggart, he is 
not a one-message billboard. 
</P>
<P>
What makes Rooney so intriguing, in fact, is that in many matters he makes 
wonderful sense. You have to admire his message to the Constitutional Rights 
Foundation, whose goal is to teach youth a "deeper understanding of citizenship 
through values expressed in the Constitution and its Bill of Rights." 
</P>
<P>
He preached speaking out for one's beliefs, regardless of the cost: "If you say 
what you think, you're always going to make someone mad." He wondered why 
America has "become a nation that doesn't say what it thinks about so many 
things." Why, indeed? 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, let's hope Rooney's audience was listening when he declared: "There's 
no sense having free speech if no one speaks freely." Put that on Mt. Rushmore. 
</P>
<P>
As an advocate of the First Amendment, Rooney can't be faulted. Yet it's sort 
of amazing the way all of this shifts the onus of guilt to CBS for ignoring 
Rooney's freedom-of-speech rights by yanking him from "60 Minutes," possibly 
because of those alleged statements about blacks he denied making and others 
about gays that he acknowledged making. That CBS was wrong on the First 
Amendment issue doesn't make Rooney right on the gay issue. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney said some rather demeaning things about gays in his infamous letter to a 
gay publication called The Advocate. And the some-of-my-best-friends-are-gay 
defense that he expressed recently to Times columnist Rick Du Brow included a 
warning that they "be more careful about their sex habits." Either Rooney was 
being careless with his thoughts or he was implying that only gay sex, and not 
heterosexual sex, can transmit AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Based on some of his past statements, Rooney is a bigot when it comes to gays. 
The label applies regardless of how many others share his views. Everyone is a 
hero to someone. 
</P>
<P>
Because he is also cute and funny ("If I anger you, don't think you're anybody 
special," he said Monday, getting a big laugh), Rooney is perfectly suited to 
be America's lovable homophobe, a sort of Archie Bunker for gays. 
</P>
<P>
The disturbing thought is not that he has been welcomed back by a forgiving 
public, but that the public welcoming him back never thought he'd done anything 
that needed forgiving in the first place.

STATWATCH: MIDDLE INFIELDERS' BATS ESSENTIAL TO HART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For three seasons at Hart High, Rob Davis, a 5-foot-9 shortstop, and Lance 
Migita, a 5-7 second baseman, have been the Indians' unmistakable offensive 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of the week, Davis had a .413 career batting average (104 for 252) 
with 29 extra-base hits and 79 runs batted in. Migita is batting .421 with 31 
extra-base hits and 67 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Davis is batting a team-high .462 with a team-high seven doubles. 
Migita, who was batting only .222 in March, is batting .417 with team-high 
totals of five home runs and 26 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Batting: Sylmar junior Dereck Ornelas has established himself as a player to 
watch next season. The 5-11, 170-pound right-handed hitter has a 14-game 
hitting streak in which he has driven in 25 runs and hit four home runs. He has 
a .521 batting average (25 for 48) during the streak. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Saugus catcher J. B. Johnson, who has six home runs this season, needs one more 
to tie Don Pedersen (11) for second place on the school career list. Saugus has 
17 home runs, three short of the school single-season record. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Saugus shortstop Walter White had a school-record streak of seven consecutive 
hits snapped last week. The streak extended over three games. White, who has 10 
hits in his past 12 at-bats, is batting a team-high .468. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Chaminade's Ted Corcoran, who is batting a team-high .394, had a streak of 
eight consecutive hits in league play snapped against St. Genevieve last week. 
</P>
<P>
Miscellaneous: Hart is 88-18-2 in four years under Coach Bud Murray. The 
Indians (21-1-2) have won 18 in a row. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Sylmar has clinched a berth in the City Section 4-A Division baseball playoffs, 
marking the team's 21st consecutive postseason appearance. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Westlake has been successful on 58 of 60 stolenbase attempts. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Montclair Prep senior Kevin Grant has allowed no earned runs and just three 
hits in his past 14 innings. In that span, he has 17 strikeouts.

FILM STUDIOS ARE GIRDING FOR SUMMER; 
</P>
<P>
HOLLYWOOD: THE FINISHING TOUCHES OF STRATEGY AND MARKETING ARE BEING PUT ON A 
SEASON OF SEQUELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the peak summer moviegoing months almost here, the Hollywood studios are 
putting final touches on their release schedules. Like television networks 
gearing for ratings sweeps, the studios have spent much of the spring engaged 
in a planning war of marketing and counterprogramming that they hope will 
produce blockbuster ticket sales this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Studios have changed the announced released dates on about half a dozen major 
summer movies. In some cases, the schedule changes are expected to result in 
fierce contests between two or more potential hits while, in other cases, the 
date swapping promises to give a film a relatively wide-open berth. 
</P>
<P>
As ever, the studios are also counting on sequel appeal as a selling factor. 
The summer slate includes eight titles with a sense of deja vu, up from last 
summer's seven. 
</P>
<P>
Along with "RoboCop II," "Another 48 HRS.," "Die Hard 2" and "Gremlins II," 
there'll be "Exorcist III: Legion," "Young Guns II," "The Two Jakes" and "Back 
to the Future III." 
</P>
<P>
Most studio executives are quick to note that, even at this late date, 
everything on the summer slate is subject to change. Some films, such as 20th 
Century Fox's "Die Hard 2" are not finished yet and may not make their 
scheduled release dates. Still, other films may be moved in order to take 
advantage of a perceived weakness in the competition or to capitalize on other 
market changes. 
</P>
<P>
Here's the latest rundown: 
</P>
<P>
* May 18: Orion Pictures' "Cadillac Man," starring Robin Williams, will trying 
to pick off Universal Pictures' "Bird on a Wire," starring Goldie Hawn and Mel 
Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
* May 25: Universal's "Back to the Future III" looks like it may have the 
Memorial Day weekend all to itself. Ironically, the holiday weekend used to 
mark the kick-off of the summer movie season but no more. 
</P>
<P>
* June 1: Tri-Star's futuristic saga "Total Recall," starring Arnold 
Schwarzenegger, was initially scheduled to shoot it out with "Dick Tracy," 
directed by and starring Warren Beatty on June 15. Then Tri-Star decided to 
move "Total Recall" to June 1, when there is no major opposition. The reason? 
"Those two movies were clearly competing for the same audience," says a studio 
marketing executive from another studio, adding, "Now, Tri-Star has a clear 
shot." 
</P>
<P>
* June 8: When production went longer than planned on Paramount's "Days of 
Thunder," a racing drama starring Tom Cruise, the studio switched its opening 
with the planned June 27 release of "Another 48 HRS.," which reteams Nick Nolte 
and Eddie Murphy in a sequel to their hit 1982 action-comedy. So the sequel 
looks like it may have this weekend to itself. 
</P>
<P>
* June 15: With "Total Recall" out of the June 15 slot, "Dick Tracy" briefly 
appeared to have a clear shot -- until Warner decided to push back the opening 
date of its "Gremlins II: The New Batch" from May 18. 
</P>
<P>
"It's counterprogramming," declares a marketing spokeswoman who asked that her 
name not be used. The strategy? "The talk around town is that 'Dick Tracy' and 
(director/star) Warren Beatty don't have kid appeal. But kids definitely know 
the 'Gremlins.' " 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, it was Disney that counted on "kid appeal" as a counterprogramming 
element against Warner -- by changing the release date of "Honey, I Shrunk the 
Kids" so that it opened the same week as Warner's dark drama "Batman." While 
the latter went on to rewrite the record books, with grosses of $251 million, 
"Honey" emerged a surprise hit -- and proof of the burgeoning market for family 
movies -- with grosses of $130 million. 
</P>
<P>
* June 22: There's a scheduled battle between Orion's "RoboCop II," starring 
Peter Weller, and 20th Century Fox's "Die Hard 2," starring Bruce Willis. But 
if "Die Hard 2" doesn't wrap production in time, it is likely to wind up racing 
Paramount's "Days of Thunder" on June 27. 
</P>
<P>
* June 27: "Days of Thunder." 
</P>
<P>
* July 13: "Exorcist III: Legion." 
</P>
<P>
* Late July: "Young Guns II." 
</P>
<P>
* Aug. 10: "The Two Jakes."

JOFFREY BOARD CONSIDERS FATE OF ARPINO BALLETS; 
</P>
<P>
BALLET: THE BOARD'S DECISION MAY DETERMINE WHETHER ANY OF THE FORMER ARTISTIC 
DIRECTOR'S WORKS WILL BE PERFORMED DURING THE BALANCE OF SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Joffrey Ballet board is meeting today to consider its ongoing dispute with 
former artistic director Gerald Arpino and the fate of ballets he created while 
an employee of the company. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball's in their court," said Arpino's attorney, Harold Messing. He expects 
the board to act on proposals which he has made to resolve the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"We are discussing ways to accommodate Mr. Arpino," he said. "We're waiting to 
see what they can offer him." 
</P>
<P>
Arpino resigned on the eve of the company's season opening at the Music Center 
last week, after a controversial restructuring of the Joffrey board. 
</P>
<P>
With Arpino went a sizable chunk of the Joffrey repertory. Last week, Messing 
informed the company that choreographies by Arpino and deceased company founder 
Robert Joffrey belong to Arpino and/or the estate of Joffrey, and that their 
unauthorized use would constitute copyright infringement. 
</P>
<P>
Messing said negotiations between him and the company have stopped. While 
negotiations were in process, Messing had given the company permission to use 
Arpino's works, but now that negotiations have halted that permission has been 
withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
The company has not conceded Arpino's ownership of the works that he created 
while artistic director, but withdrew Arpino works scheduled Sunday, Tuesday 
and tonight, replacing them with other repertory from the current season. The 
next scheduled performance of some of the disputed repertory is Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
The board's actions could determine whether any Arpino works will be performed 
during the balance of the company's season in Los Angeles through May 27, and 
perhaps whether the company will ever again perform works by its co-founder, 
whose oeuvre has come to define the company even more so than the work of the 
company's namesake. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most immediately affected by today's meeting are the dancers 
themselves, who have in recent days had to adjust to the program changes, while 
also considering the long-term future of the company itself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
JOFFREY BALLET WORKS IN QUESTION 
</P>
<P>
The Joffrey Ballet is negotiating with former artistic director Gerald Arpino 
over the company's continued performance of his works and/or those of the 
estate of Robert Joffrey. According to Arpino's laywer, the Joffrey Ballet is 
prohibited from performing the specific works below, among others:

Iran said today that it has reached agreement with the United States on a 
number of financial disputes dating from the Islamic revolution in 1979, but 
there was no confirmation from the American side. 
</P>
<P>
Tehran radio quoted a statement by Iran's mission at the Iran-U.S. Claims 
Tribunal in The Hague as saying that under two separate agreements, Iran would 
pay the United States a total of $105 million to settle more than 3,100 claims. 
</P>
<P>
It quoted Ali Nobari, Iran's representative at the tribunal, as saying the 
deal, yet to be ratified by the tribunal, has nothing to do with American 
hostages held in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
In The Hague, a U.S. official close to the talks said, however, that no 
agreement has been reached and would not confirm or deny the $105-million 
figure.

"We are close to a settlement of 2,600 claims. I do not understand where Nobari 
gets his 3,100 figure from," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington on Tuesday, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler had 
said, "A package settlement of small claims has been under discussion for some 
time, and differences have narrowed considerably, but we have not yet closed 
this matter." 
</P>
<P>
The tribunal was set up in 1981 to settle financial claims arising from Iran's 
revolution under an agreement that also freed 52 American hostages seized at 
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
It is the only forum of official talks between the two countries, which broke 
diplomatic relations in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Nobari said the agreement was reached "in the normal framework of the 
negotiations and has no relation with political and economic issues including, 
as Western media have said, the question of hostages," Tehran radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
Some Western analysts suggested a settlement of the small claims could be one 
way for the United States to show goodwill for Iran's help in the release last 
month of two American hostages in Lebanon.

Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg has given birth to her second daughter and the 
second grandchild of former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, it was 
announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Tuckerman, spokeswoman for Onassis, said Caroline, a 32-year-old 
attorney, had a 7-pound, 10-ounce daughter Saturday at New York Hospital and 
has returned to her East Side Manhattan apartment. 
</P>
<P>
She is the wife of designer Edwin Schlossberg. 
</P>
<P>
"Both mother and baby are doing well," Tuckerman said. "Mrs. Onassis is, of 
course, delighted." 
</P>
<P>
Tuckerman said the baby was named Tatiana Celia Kennedy Schlossberg and 
probably will be called Tanya. 
</P>
<P>
"The Tatiana is after the late Tatiana Grossman, founder of Universal Limited 
Art Editions and a fine lithographer for whom Ed Schlossberg worked and whom he 
admired," Tuckerman said. "Celia is for Ed's grandmother." 
</P>
<P>
The Schlossbergs have another daughter, Rose, named for Kennedy clan dowager 
Rose Kennedy. She will be 2 years old in June.

HUNTINGTON BEACH TEEN-AGER GUILTY IN MURDER OF ROOMMATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Huntington Beach teen-ager was convicted today of shooting to death his 
roommate and then setting fire to his body in an attempt to conceal the crime. 
</P>
<P>
An Orange County Superior Court jury in Santa Ana deliberated for three days 
before finding Brian Applegate, 17, guilty of first-degree murder in the death 
of Paul Londono, 25, on Jan. 8, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Applegate maintained that he had to kill Londono to end a terror-filled 
homosexual relationship in which he was beaten and raped. 
</P>
<P>
Applegate faces a maximum penalty of 27 years to life in prison. Because of his 
age, however, Superior Court Judge Robert Fitzgerald could sentence Applegate 
to the California Youth Authority rather than state prison, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Patrick Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy was tried as an adult although he was 16 when he killed Londono, his 
companion and roommate with whom he had come to Southern California from 
Daytona Beach, Fla., in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
After the murder, Applegate stuffed Londono into a sleeping bag and drove to 
the bottom of a cliff, where he poured gasoline on the body and set it afire.

President Frederik W. de Klerk of South Africa arrived here today on the first

ending decades of international isolation.

Buoyed by a breakthrough in black-white negotiations at home, De Klerk plans to

most extensive trip by a South African leader since the governing National

Two men on a mountain biking excursion spent the night in the Angeles National 
Forest after one of their bikes broke down and they got lost, prompting a 
ground and air search that ended this morning when the pair flagged down a man 
on his way to work. 
</P>
<P>
Teams of 46 sheriff's deputies aided by two helicopters had been searching for 
Tom Yackee, who turns 23 Thursday, and Mike Hughes, 24, both of El Monte, since 
Tuesday night, when the pair failed to return to a designated pickup spot as 
scheduled, Deputy Bill Wehner said. 
</P>
<P>
About 8:30 a.m. today, an NBC technician bound for the radio tower at Mt. 
Wilson to make repairs was flagged down by the pair, who were pushing their 
bikes toward the tower, which they were using to keep their bearings, Deputy 
Pat Hunter said.

HUNGARY IN MOVE TO DROP WARSAW PACT MEMBERSHIP

<TEXT>
<P>
Parliament agreed today to consider suspending Hungarian membership in the 
Warsaw Pact and opposition leaders urged the government to negotiate a 
permanent break with the Soviet-led alliance. 
</P>
<P>
In an indication of widespread support, members of the recently elected 
Parliament applauded loudly when the suspension proposal was introduced by 
Mikos Vasarhelyi, a deputy of the opposition Alliance of Free Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers voted to consider the proposal at their next session. 
</P>
<P>
Approval would make Hungary -- whose once-dominant Communist Party has been 
removed from power and reformulated itself into a Socialist Party -- the first 
East Bloc country to suspend Warsaw Pact membership since last year's wave of 
anti-Communist reforms in Eastern Europe began. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary withdrew from the alliance briefly during the 1956 uprising that was 
crushed by Soviet tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Vasarhelyi was the spokesman of the Imre Nagy government that was dissolved 
after the failed uprising. The Nagy government's Nov. 1, 1956, announcement 
that it was withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact was followed three days later by 
the Soviet invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to express the historic continuity with this proposal and we wanted 
to carry on the traditions of the government in 1956," Vasarhelyi said at a 
news conference after introducing the suspension legislation. "What that 
government was unable to carry through, we now present to Parliament."

The Navy is dropping its bid to force repayment of tuition from two Ivy League 
cadets expelled from ROTC for homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
A Navy spokesman said that the cases were "reviewed on their merits, and the 
decision was made not to seek recoupment," the New York Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
However, the unidentified spokesman said there had been no change in the 
Pentagon's ban on homosexuals in the military. 
</P>
<P>
Robert L. Bettiker, 22, a chemistry major at Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, and David Carney, a 23-year-old Harvard graduate studying in 
Britain, had been dismissed after informing their commanders they are gay. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy had said it would seek reimbursement of their scholarship money: 
$38,612 from Bettiker and $50,687 from Carney. 
</P>
<P>
Bettiker called the turnaround "great" and said he hoped that it would have 
implications for other ROTC cadets in similar circumstances.

Vice President Dan Quayle hailed America's World War II soldiers today as 
heroes who laid the groundwork for European unity, but some veterans boycotted 
a ceremony because of Quayle's military record. 
</P>
<P>
In remarks to about two dozen members of the American Legion of Paris, the vice 
president praised Dwight D. Eisenhower's vision of world peace. 
</P>
<P>
"Eisenhower foresaw that the Europe that existed in his time must change to 
reflect the fundamental principles that these heroes fought for, principles 
that the United States and France have shared for some 200 years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But one of the legionnaires present said that several people in his 750-member 
organization declined to attend the ceremony at the American Embassy because 
they believed that Quayle avoided combat duty during the Vietnam War by joining 
the Indiana National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
"That bothers some of the members," said a Vietnam veteran who asked not to be 
identified.

CONYNGHAM IN NORFOLK AFTER FATAL BLAZE

The guided-missile destroyer Conyngham, damaged by a fire so hot its decks were 
"bubbling," docked today at the Norfolk Naval Station as the Navy began 
investigating the blaze that killed a crewman. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen other sailors, including the No. 2 officer, were injured in the worst 
shipboard fire since a string of accidents prompted the Navy to suspend 
operations for a two-day safety check in November. 
</P>
<P>
A second Navy man was killed in a separate accident on Chesapeake Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Six of the sailors with less serious injuries accompanied the ship back to port 
before going to the hospital, said Capt. Paul Hanley, Atlantic Fleet spokesman. 
Twelve others had been flown from the ship to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
The Conyngham, with a large scorch mark on its right side just above the 
waterline, docked 21 hours after the fire erupted during routine operations 
about 100 miles southeast of Norfolk, said Lt. (j.g.) Karl Johnson, an Atlantic 
Fleet spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The commander of a ship that helped the Conyngham fight the blaze said today it 
was "a major league fire" that could have destroyed the warship. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Joseph W. Perrotta Jr., skipper of the Normandy, said when he approached 
the Conyngham, smoke was pouring out of the ship's forward stack area and 
bridge. The Normandy provided additional firefighting equipment and personnel 
to help the Conyngham crew control the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
The Conyngham crew "did a super job of putting out that fire," Perrotta said. 
"The ship could have been lost if not for the gallant effort of the crew." 
</P>
<P>
About 200 family members and friends met the 383-member crew, which disembarked 
as work crews from other vessels boarded the Conyngham to clear the vessel's 
decks of water, Hanley said.

Roman Catholic Cardinal Tomas O Fiaich, the primate of all Ireland and an 
ardent Irish nationalist, died Tuesday after falling ill on a pilgrimage to 
Lourdes, France, the church announced. He was 66. 
</P>
<P>
The cardinal, who was head of the church in both the Republic of Ireland and 
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland, died of cardiac arrest in a hospital at 
Toulouse, 95 miles from Lourdes, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A church statement said O Fiaich had appeared unwell to doctors accompanying 
the group of 600 pilgrims from his seat at Armagh in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
Lourdes is a Catholic shrine where a peasant girl reported a vision of the 
Virgin Mary in 1858. Miraculous cures have been reported there. 
</P>
<P>
The cardinal was admitted first to a hospital in Lourdes, then flown by 
helicopter to Toulouse. Philippe Giovanni, director of the Rangueil Hospital 
there, said O Fiaich died of a "brutal cardiac arrest" soon after being 
admitted.

DOW DROPS BACK 0.68 AFTER A WEEK OF GAINS

The stock market was mixed today, pausing after more than a week of steady 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 93.83 points over the past seven 
sessions, slipped 0.68 to 2,732.88. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues edged out declines on the New York Stock Exchange, with 755 
up, 723 down and 505 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 152.22 million shares, against 144.23 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose .38 to 187.49. 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates moved higher in the credit markets today. Prices of long-term 
government bonds dropped more than $5 for each $1,000 in face value, increasing 
their yields to the 8.89% -8.93% range. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said both the stock and bond markets seemed to be on hold awaiting 
results from the Treasury's quarterly auction of bonds and notes. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist for Kleinwort Benson government 
Securities Inc. in Chicago, attributed the price drop to "nervousness around 
auction time". 
</P>
<P>
A warm reception was reported Tuesday for the first of the offering's three 
installments, a $10.5-billion sale of three-year notes. 
</P>
<P>
The financing continued with the sale of $10 billion in 10-year notes today, 
and winds up with $10 billion in 30-year bonds on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But market watchers warned that strong demand for three-year notes may not 
necessarily mean equal demand for longer-dated issues. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
fell this morning by 1/16 to 3/32 point, intermediate maturities fell 1/4 point 
to 9/32 point, and long-term issues were down 9/32 point to 11/32 point, 
according to Telerate Inc., the financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, fell 1.78 to 1,138.86. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.05% as the discount rose 1 basis 
point to 7.79%. Yields on six-month bills fell to 8.20% as the discount fell 1 
basis point to 7.78%. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.40% as the discount 
rose 2 basis points to 7.80%. 
</P>
<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8 1/8%, down from 8 3/16% late Tuesday.

The 30,000-member union asked the Federal Aviation Administration to adopt the

The 43rd Cannes Film Festival opening Thursday offers a world view of the 
cinema that reflects rapidly changing events. 
</P>
<P>
Movies from Eastern Europe, the Far East and Africa are among the 19 films 
competing for the Golden Palm award during the 12 days of competition. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday will be devoted to "Europe 90, Cinema Without Borders" for meetings 
and discussions between filmmakers from East and West, marking new freedoms 
enjoyed by Eastern Europe's film industry. 
</P>
<P>
The prestigious festival also serves as a vast film market and is expected to 
draw up to 12,000 industry professionals, 3,000 journalists and hordes of film 
buffs to the seaside Palais des Festivals. 
</P>
<P>
Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci will preside over the jury of 10, which 
includes American actress Anjelica Huston, French actress Fanny Ardant, French 
director Bertrand Blier and English screenwriter Christopher Hampton, who 
adapted "Les Liaisons Dangereuses" for the screen. 
</P>
<P>
The festival will open with an out-of-competition showing of "Dreams," an 
autobiographical movie by Akiro Kurosawa, the 80-year-old Japanese film master. 
It closes with another out-of-competition film, "Comfort of Strangers," by 
American director Paul Schrader. 
</P>
<P>
Three American films are expected to be serious contenders for the Golden Palm: 
Clint Eastwood's "White Hunter, Black Heart," David Lynch's "Wild at Heart" and 
"Come See the Paradise," directed by English-born Alan Parker, about a 
Japanese-American family interned in a camp during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
There will be a special out-of-competition showing of "Cry Baby," starring 
Patty Hearst and directed by John Waters, the unconventional director of 
"Hairspray." 
</P>
<P>
Films by directors from Eastern countries celebrating newly won freedom are 
expected to attract attention. These include "Przesluchanie" (The 
Interrogation) by Polish director Ryszard Bugajski, "Ucho" (The Ear) from 
Czechoslovakia and an out-of-competition film from Yugoslavia, "Umetni Raj," 
(Artificial Paradise) by Karpo Godina. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union is competing with "Matj" (Mother), directed by Gleb Panfilov, 
and a French-Soviet co-production of "Taxi Blues," directed by Pavel Lounguine. 
</P>
<P>
Competing for France will be Bernard Tavernier's "Daddy Nostalgie," starring 
Jane Birkin and Dirk Bogarde, "La Captive du Desert" (Desert Captive), starring 
Sandrine Bonnaire, and "Cyrano de Bergerac," starring Gerard Depardieu. 
Directed by Jean-Paul Rappeneau, "Cyrano" is already a box-office hit in 
France. 
</P>
<P>
Also vying for the Golden Palm will be "New Wave," a Swiss-French co-production 
directed by the father of new-wave cinema, Jean-Luc Godard, whose avant-garde 
style was born in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
A Chinese-Japanese entry called "Ju Dou," directed by Chang Yimou and Yang 
Fengliang, deals with a troubled marriage of the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
The lone British entry is Ken Loach's "Hidden Agenda," a documentary-style film 
about troubled Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
From Burkina Faso, Rasmane Ouedraogo is in competition with a film called 
"Tilai," about conflict and love in an African village. 
</P>
<P>
Eastwood's "White Hunter, Black Heart," about a director obsessed with killing 
an elephant, is expected to attract attention. Based on a story by Peter 
Viertel, it was allegedly inspired by the 1952 filming of "African Queen."

FRANCE HOPES TO WIN CINEMATIC GLORY BY A BULBOUS NOSE

<P>
France is pinning its hopes of cinematic glory on a bulbous nose when the 43rd 
Cannes film festival opens Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The nose in question is sported by the French actor Gerard Depardieu in a 
swashbuckling adaptation of "Cyrano de Bergerac," Edmond Rostand's 19th-Century 
play about a witty hero whose romantic hopes are dashed by the size of his 
grotesque protuberance. 
</P>
<P>
The latest incarnation of the story, which has been filmed many times and was 
liberally adapted for Steve Martin's "Roxanne", is said to be the most 
expensive French-language film in history and was a last-minute selection for 
the 12-day festival. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most other films competing for the prestigious Golden Palm award, which 
receive their premieres at Cannes, it has already been playing to capacity 
audiences in French cinemas for six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
But festival organizers waived their usual preference for brand-new films and 
picked "Cyrano de Bergerac" after realizing France otherwise risked a poor 
showing at its own party. 
</P>
<P>
Competing against 18 other films which include offerings by U.S. director Clint 
Eastwood, Briton Alan Parker, Italy's Taviani brothers and New Wave veteran 
Jean-Luc Godard, "Cyrano de Bergerac" faces no easy task. 
</P>
<P>
The script is in verse and although the original text has been cut and polished 
to woo modern ears, it remains to be seen whether such a profoundly French 
project will win over the 10-member international jury chaired by Italian 
director Bernardo Bertolucci ("The Last Emperor"). 
</P>
<P>
But film critics say even if the work fails to win the Golden Palm, Depardieu 
deserves the prize for best actor for his interpretation of Rostand's 
tragicomic hero. 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu, who each day donned a different artificial nose to match the mood of 
the scene he was acting, has attended 11 festivals in his career and, although 
he starred in the 1987 Cannes prizewinner "Under Satan's Sun," he has never won 
best actor.

Jim Davis, creator of fat cat Garfield, has been named Cartoonist of the Year 
for 1990 by the National Cartoonists Society. 
</P>
<P>
After six years as a nominee, Davis of Albany, Ind., won the Reuben -- the 
cartoon world's equivalent of the Oscar -- for the cynical, overfed Garfield, 
featured on television specials and many novelty items as well as newspaper 
cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
The award was presented aboard the MS Sunward II in the Caribbean during the 
weekend, said Selma Gore, spokeswoman for Norwegian Cruise Lines. 
</P>
<P>
The award, a 16-inch bronze statue designed by the late cartoonist Rube 
Goldberg, founder of the 44-year-old society, shows eight people tangled 
together around an inkstand. 
</P>
<P>
Awards for excellence were also given in five categories. Johnny Hart of 
Endicott, N.Y., who draws "B.C." and "Wizard of Id," was honored for best 
newspaper strips and panels. The newspaper editorial and sports award went to 
Pat Oliphant of Falls Church, Va. 
</P>
<P>
"Mad Magazine" cartoonist Sergio Aragones of Ojai, Calif., won the society's 
magazine and book award. Chuck Jones of Laguna Beach won the electronic media 
award for his work on Bugs Bunny and other animated cartoons, and Roy Doty of 
New York City was honored in the commercial category for his advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
Mell Lazarus, creator of the nationally syndicated "Miss Peach" and "Momma" 
comic strips, is president of the 450-member organization.

Three-time winner Johnny Rutherford suffered a concussion today when he crashed 
for the second time this week during practice for the Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
Rutherford, 52, was taken by ambulance to Methodist Hospital and was reported 
in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
Rutherford's 1989 Lola-Cosworth race car went out of control as he drove 
through the third turn on the 2 1/2-mile oval. The car skidded sideways through 
the turn, doing a half-spin as he slid 665 feet and slammed into the wall with 
the left side. The car went slightly airborne and slid along the wall 75 feet, 
digging a big gouge in the track surface. The car then spun 690 feet away from 
the wall and came to rest on the inside track apron. 
</P>
<P>
He was placed on a stretcher and taken to the speedway's infield hospital for 
examination before being transferred to Methodist. His car received extensive 
damage to the left side. 
</P>
<P>
Rutherford had completed only two laps before the crash, with a top speed of 
146.668. His best lap was on Monday, when he was timed at 212.039 before his 
first crash. At that time, he came high out of the second turn and brushed the 
wall with the right tires. He was not injured in that incident. 
</P>
<P>
Rutherford, who won the 500 in 1974, 1976 and 1980, was seeking his 25th start 
at Indianapolis. He qualified last year but was bumped from the lineup by the 
final qualifier.

Hours after Bjorn Borg stormed out of a courtroom, a nine-member jury decided 
he had been defamed by a magazine that published allegations the former tennis 
star had used drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The jury's finding Tuesday, however, is not binding. 
</P>
<P>
The three judges will deliver the formal verdict on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Borg sued Z, a weekly magazine, for $58,000 for printing allegations by his 
former girlfriend, Jannicke Bjorling, that he used drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Borg, a five-time Wimbledon champion, left the courthouse in a fury after the 
presiding judge denied his attorney's request to call an unlisted witness. 
"This is enough for me. I'm leaving," Borg said. He rushed past reporters and 
called out, "I do not care what you write." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Borg denied in court that he ever used drugs. His lawyer argued that 
the magazine knew Bjorling was in a bitter custody dispute with Borg over their 
son and should not have printed her unsubstantiated allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Z's chief editor, Jorgen Widsell, told the court he had three sources saying 
Borg had used cocaine.

Center David Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs, unanimously selected last week 
as the NBA Rookie of the Year, added the league's Pivotal Player award today. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, who led the Spurs to the Midwest Division championship and a 
franchise-record 56 victories, was 10th in the league in scoring with 24.3 
points per game. 
</P>
<P>
He was second in rebounding with 12 per game and third in blocked shots with 
3.89. 
</P>
<P>
The award is given to the player who contributes the most to his team's overall 
success. A computer analysis of key offensive and defensive statistics is used 
to determine a winner. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, with 106.51 points, finished ahead of Chicago's Michael Jordan, who 
won last year. Jordan had 101.43 points. Charles Barkley of Philadelphia, a 
three-time winner, was third, followed by Magic Johnson of the Lakers and Karl 
Malone of the Utah Jazz.

TITLE GAMES TO STAY ON NETWORKS IN 1990S;

TELEVISION: LEADERS OF PROFESSIONAL AND COLLEGE SPORTS SAY CHAMPIONSHIPS WILL

The World Series, Super Bowl and professional and college basketball 
championships will remain on broadcast network television for the rest of this 
century, sports commissioners promised today. 
</P>
<P>
"It's inconceivable to me that the World Series would not be on free 
television," Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent said at a House subcommittee 
hearing when asked if the championship might shift to cable networks or 
pay-per-view television. 
</P>
<P>
NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, NBA Commissioner David Stern and NCAA Director 
Richard Schultz made similar comments about their championship events. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue said he could guarantee the NFL Super Bowl championship game would 
stay on network TV through the year 2000 but could not make a commitment beyond 
that. 
</P>
<P>
Stern and Schultz said they had long-term network contracts for their 
championships and wanted as wide viewing as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"All sports fans are concerned about the looming specter of pay-per-view for 
sporting events," subcommittee Chairman Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) said. Other 
members said they were concerned that a growing number of regular-season games 
were moving from broadcast to cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
"Increasingly, we have no choice but to subscribe to cable if we want to watch 
major sports events," Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) said. Other members said 
fans in rural areas where cable was not available would be left out, as would 
those who could not afford cable television. 
</P>
<P>
New York area members complained because all of the regular Knicks basketball 
and Islanders and Rangers hockey games are now on cable and the Yankee baseball 
games next season also might shift entirely to a cable system. 
</P>
<P>
Major league baseball, the NFL and the NBA are seen on broadcast networks, 
local stations and cable networks for regular-season games. The National Hockey 
League has no U.S. network contract but is on cable TV and local stations. 
</P>
<P>
CBS will carry only 16 regular-season baseball games for each of the next four 
years as well as the league playoffs and World Series. The ESPN cable network 
will have 175 games shown four nights a week. 
</P>
<P>
NFL games are on CBS, NBC and ABC and two cable networks. The NBA is moving 
from CBS to NBC next season and will also be on the Turner cable network.

MUCH OF WHAT HURT THE CELTICS' RODGERS WAS NOT HIS FAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN GREENBERG, THE HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coaching the Boston Celtics used to be a dream job. Nobody ever accused Tom 
Heinsohn, Bill Russell or K. C. Jones of being coaching geniuses, but they did 
not have to be. The National Basketball Assn. was a far weaker, 
less-competitive league in those days, and the Celtics' cupboard was almost 
always overflowing with great players. Great young players. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Rodgers, fired Tuesday after two shaky seasons at the Celtics' helm, had 
few such luxuries. He inherited a team of greats who had grown old, their deeds 
no longer as wondrous as their names and reputations -- and public 
expectations. His predecessor, Jones, had hastened his stars' aging process by 
playing them more than 40 minutes a game and all but ignoring development of 
the Celtics' young players, leaving them to rot on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
For Rodgers to be successful by the Celtics' exalted standards, he had to be 
lucky. He was not. He was forced to coach virtually the entire 1988-89 season 
without the team's greatest player, Larry Bird, who was sidelined by surgery on 
both feet. He was forced to coach the entire 1989-90 season without his best 
young guard, Brian Shaw, who bolted to Italy in August when the Celtics were 
slow meeting his contract demands. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers was not responsible for negotiating contracts. He was not responsible 
for the Celtics' uneven success on draft day. But he was held responsible, in 
essence, for the Celtics' uneven play this season. He was held responsible for 
their elimination in the first round of the playoffs, the second consecutive 
season they were eliminated in the first round. That had not happened since Red 
Auerbach's first two seasons, 1950-51 and 1951-52. 
</P>
<P>
Some believe that if the Celtics had beaten the New York Knicks, Rodgers would 
not have been fired. Don't be so sure. It probably would have taken beating the 
defending champion Detroit Pistons in the playoffs to save him. 
</P>
<P>
Celtic owner Alan Cohen was not pleased with the team's erratic play this 
season, and there was some feeling that Rodgers, while certainly not a 
so-called "players' coach" (which usually means hands-off) in the K. C. Jones 
mold, was not quite hard enough on some of his aging stars. 
</P>
<P>
What is more, Rodgers did a poor job communicating with several players, 
particularly Kevin Gamble and Jim Paxson. To the surprise of virtually 
everyone, Gamble was a budding star when injuries forced him into the lineup at 
the end of the 1988-89 season, but Rodgers soured on him early this season and 
never told the confused Gamble where he stood, or why. He was similarly vague 
with Paxson. 
</P>
<P>
But if Rodgers' inability to communicate with his non-legends was lacking, his 
ideas on how to save the Celtics' old legs were not. What was lacking was the 
wholehearted cooperation of the most important person in the organization -- 
Bird. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers wanted the Celtics to become more of an equal-opportunity team. Besides 
starting Ed Pinckney and having Kevin McHale fill a sixth-man role to beef up 
bench scoring, Rodgers wanted Bird to shoot less, prompting Bird to 
sarcastically refer to himself as a "point forward." 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers also wanted Bird to play less. It was like asking Diana Ross to sing 
backup. It did not wash. The Celtics looked great in their opening night 
victory against the Milwaukee Bucks, and in the winner's dressing room, the 
only discouraging words heard were Bird's. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take me awhile to get adjusted to this," he said, after playing 
32 minutes. The way he said it, you knew it was not an adjustment he was eager 
to make. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, he did not. He was Larry Bird, and he knew what was best for Larry 
Bird. He shot more. He played more. And the Celtics won more. And when Rodgers 
tried to keep 35-year-old Dennis Johnson in a reserve role, Bird let the coach 
know that was not the way to go. Ultimately, Johnson played because John Bagley 
got hurt and because, lo and behold, Johnson proved he still could. Bird was 
vindicated -- again. 
</P>
<P>
But Bird was still a Rodgers booster, after a fashion. When the Celtics hit the 
home stretch and the front office failed to give Rodgers a vote of confidence, 
Bird let it be known that Rodgers had done a good job and deserved to be 
retained. But as Bird proved in the fourth quarter of Game 5 Sunday -- when he 
was one for six from the field and failed to score in the last 11 minutes -- 
his power is not what it once was. 
</P>
<P>
When a coach is on the hot seat, a good image is one intangible that can help 
him hold a job. But Rodgers' public image was not overly good. 
</P>
<P>
There were few smiles in this Mr. Rodgers' neighborhood. He was wound tight 
emotionally, and often looked and acted as if he was leading a death march. He 
baited the referees and got a lot of technicals. He bumped one and got a 
one-game suspension. After a loss at Atlanta to the Hawks, he went on and on, 
whining about the referees costing the Celtics the game. He sounded like a high 
school coach. 
</P>
<P>
But if he wanted to whine about his firing, he would be justified to an extent. 
Few of the Celtics' problems were of Jimmy Rodgers' making. As the saying goes, 
if he didn't have bad luck, he'd have no luck at all. 
</P>
<P>
Celtic General Manager Jan Volk says Assistant Coach Chris Ford will be 
seriously considered as Rodgers' successor. Can Ford make the Celtics young 
again? Can he be guaranteed the blockbuster trade that makes the Celtics' bid 
for a 17th NBA championship something besides a pipe dream? 
</P>
<P>
If not, his fate will be the same as Rodgers'. Unless the Celtics engage in 
some serious restructuring, unless the public's and management's expectations 
are lowered during that restructuring, holding the Celtics' reins will be 
nobody's dream. More like a nightmare.

RACING Q &amp; A 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Which is considered the more difficult feat: winning the Triple Crown 
in the United States, when the three races are contested over a period of five 
weeks, or winning it in England, with the three races spread out over more than 
three months? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: There is a divergence of opinion among professionals. Some feel the 
concentration of pressure involved in the American Triple Crown places a 
fearsome burden on a horse. Others feel it is more difficult to keep a horse in 
top condition for the longer period of time involved in the English Triple 
Crown. Suffice to say, both series are difficult to sweep. There have been 11 
winners of the U.S. Triple Crown since Sir Barton was the first in 1919. 
Affirmed, in 1978, was the last. West Australian was the first to sweep the 
English Triple Crown (the 2,000 Guineas, the Derby and St. Leger) in 1853, and 
15 horses have done it. The last was Nijinsky II in 1970, and he was the first 
since Bahram in 1935. The English Triple Crown does not seem to hold the same 
appeal for horsemen in that country these days as the American Triple Crown 
among horsemen in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am fascinated by the distinction made between races at a mile and a 16th 
and races at a mile and 70 yards. The two distances are so close together, for 
a mile and a 16th is a mile and 110 yards. Why do tracks offer both distances 
when they are almost the same thing? 
</P>
<P>
A: It is often a matter of psychology. The racing secretary is trying to 
attract the best possible racing material for his programs. Some trainers may 
feel that their horse doesn't have the stamina to stay a mile and a 16th but 
might be able to win at a mile and 70 yards. Department stores practice the 
same psychology by pricing items at $99, rather than $100. 
</P>
<P>
Q: When I handicap the races, I compare the best previous times of the horses 
in that race at the distance in question. Some of my friends discount the best 
time as having little significance. What do you think? 
</P>
<P>
A: "The quality of the race can make a difference," said Leroy Jolley, the Hall 
of Fame trainer who saddled Kentucky Derby winners Foolish Pleasure and Genuine 
Risk. "Cheap horses are not consistent and can turn in a good time one day and 
a slow time the next. In some instances they are favored by certain track 
conditions, or perhaps they can get an easy lead in some races and nurse it all 
the way. Good horses, on the other hand, hold their form longer, and if they 
run in fast time, they are more likely to run back in comparable time than 
cheap horses. Not all the time, but more often. Thus, in better races, the best 
times are probably more significant."

LOS ALAMITOS;

<P>
RAGING CHARGER HEADS TALENTED FIELD FOR FEATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Raging Charger, who finished a close second in his 1990 debut two weeks ago, 
heads a field of eight sprinters in tonight's feature at Los Alamitos Race 
Course. 
</P>
<P>
The 350-yard main event features 3-year-old and older horses racing for a 
$16,000 claiming price. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how they'll line up (from the rail out with riders): Ah Wilderness, 
Eddie Garcia; Grampa Sam, Steve Treasure; Easy Duino, Bruce Pilkenton; Lucky 
Leinster, Kip Didericksen; Raging Charger, Lute Proctor; Hemet Flash, Ralph 
Seville, and Bubba Dasher, Danny Cardoza. 
</P>
<P>
Raging Charger, owned by Bonifacio Rayas, opened his 1990 season in allowance 
company two weeks ago at Los Alamitos. Racing as the 2-1 favorite, jockey Henry 
Garcia had Raging Charger on the lead a few strides away from the gates, but 
had to settle for second when Double The Effort stuck his neck out in the final 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-year-old gelding raced with some tough allowance horses last year at Los 
Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
Jockey Henry Garcia led Raging Charger to a fourth-place finish in the 550-yard 
Barbra B Handicap last season. The Colorado-bred likes the shorter 350-yard 
distance and is well-placed in tonight's field. 
</P>
<P>
With leading rider Didericksen, Lucky Leinster could upset the top choice. The 
4-year-old son of Leinster House won five of nine races last year for trainer 
James Maple. 
</P>
<P>
Hemet Flash faces one of the easiest fields of his career after racing with 
stakes horses last year.

VARIETY THE SPICE OF REEVES' MUSICAL LIFE; 
</P>
<P>
POP MUSIC: THE SINGER, APPEARING FRIDAY AT THE HENRY FONDA THEATRE, HAS A 
SMORGASBORD OF STYLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Singer Dianne Reeves is unabashedly, unashamedly diverse. A typical performance 
by the singer will stretch from down-home jazz to snappy funk, from 
Brazilian-tinged tunes to African chants. 
</P>
<P>
Suggest to Reeves that this smorgasbord of styles makes her a pop singer one 
tune, a jazz songstress the next, and then a world music chanteuse on still the 
next, and she begs to differ: "I call myself a singer," she says simply. "My 
roots are in jazz but that has allowed me to incorporate other styles and 
genres and to experiment." 
</P>
<P>
This manifold approach has been Reeves' bent for about as long as she can 
remember. "I have always been drawn to a variety of musics," says the vocalist 
who appears Friday at the Henry Fonda Theatre in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was growing up in Denver, I'd listen to singers like Flora Purim with 
Return to Forever or Dee Dee Bridgewater with the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis Jazz 
Orchestra, who were doing all kinds of different stuff and I thought, 'That's 
the kind of music I want to perform.' " 
</P>
<P>
She couldn't find what she wanted in Denver, so she came to Los Angeles, which 
she's called home since 1979. "I didn't know how to get to the music I was 
attracted to in Denver, but I knew a lot of the people were in L.A., so this 
was where I wanted to be," says the singer, 33, who's concluding a monthlong 
U.S. tour in support of her new album, "Never Too Far" (EMI), which follows 
1987's "Dianne Reeves" (Blue Note) and two efforts on Palo Alto Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
"Never Too Far" -- a collection of, you got it, jazz, pop and world 
music-influenced selections -- has been doing well on the Billboard 
Contemporary Jazz charts, and is beginning to see a little action on Urban 
Contemporary charts. Reeves has no qualms about crossing over, nor of being 
tossed, categorically speaking, into the pop music arena. 
</P>
<P>
"I have waited a long time for these doors (to a broader audience) to open," 
she says. "I want to have a following, I've always wanted one. If your music 
becomes popular, becomes pop music, it's because people like it. In my case, I 
hope this popularity is based on who I am musically." 
</P>
<P>
Though for the past couple of years, the Detroit-born, Denver-raised Reeves has 
worked fairly large venues, such as Carnegie Hall in New York and the Kennedy 
Center in Washington, she's lately gone for smaller theaters, like the Henry 
Fonda. The 700-1,200 seat houses offer her an opportunity to reach her audience 
more intimately, and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'd always like to play theaters where I can be in touch with the 
people," she says. "I need that kind of comfort, of rapport with the audience. 
If (the venue) gets too huge, you don't get to know the people. One thing I 
learned from working small clubs (earlier on in my career) was that the 
interaction was important to my show." 
</P>
<P>
One small club that sticks out in Reeves' mind is the now-closed Comeback Inn 
in Venice, where the singer worked regularly between 1979-81, after she arrived 
here from Colorado in 1977, with a band called Night Flight, featuring pianist 
Billy Childs. 
</P>
<P>
"That was where I really got started," she says. "We'd work weekends and get 
paid by passing the hat. The club seated no more than 100, and for a while, 
maybe 10 to 15 people would be there. But after a year, the room was packed. It 
was a place where there no boundaries musically, we just did what we felt. It 
was very spontaneous and it was there that I started to come into my own, to 
have some concept of what I wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, after 18 months with Sergio Mendes and three years as a spotlighted 
singer with Harry Belafonte, during which time she lived in New York City, 
Reeves returned to Los Angeles and began her solo in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt it was time to go on and finish what I set out to do," she says. "I 
kept wondering who I was as a singer, where was I going, so I decided to go to 
back to L.A., it was home by then. When I got here, everything started to 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
As far as she's concerned, Reeves' life is right on track. "I'm doing what I've 
always wanted to do, which is to support myself singing and performing music 
based on my life experience."

A LIFE AND DEATH IN HOLLYWOOD; 
</P>
<P>
ACTING: DAVID RAPPAPORT WAS TRAPPED BY HIS MIND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Rappaport was as determined to die as he had been to live. 
</P>
<P>
His mind -- that well-schooled repository of British university education, of 
years of teaching and writing and musicianship and acting -- had of late 
refused to turn itself off. The thoughts, said his cousin and manager, Frankie 
Leigh, kept coming like a record stuck on a turntable, ideas twisting through 
his brain and keeping him up night after night. 
</P>
<P>
His cousin considered, then rejected, theory after theory: Perhaps his thoughts 
were telling him -- falsely -- that the woman he was about to marry might one 
day leave, unable to love a dwarf who might not always be the toast of 
Hollywood. Perhaps they told him that despite enormous success, he was still 
trapped -- as trapped as the dwarf he had seen years earlier, caged in an 
English asylum for mentally retarded children. 
</P>
<P>
Or possibly, in the way that mind-records have, they exaggerated recent stops 
and starts in his career until it seemed that all he had worked for, all he had 
done to escape invisibility, was gone or going. 
</P>
<P>
Frankie Leigh doesn't understand it. 
</P>
<P>
He tried once before to kill himself, two weeks before his planned wedding day 
last March. He parked his car on a hidden stretch of road and ran a garden hose 
from the exhaust pipe to the interior. He passed out, but somebody found him. 
</P>
<P>
After that, he swore to Leigh that he would never try again, that he would 
learn how to share his pain with others and take off the happy mask of one who 
had no problems. 
</P>
<P>
But soon after his release from the hospital, Rappaport bought a gun and hid it 
away. 
</P>
<P>
And on Tuesday, May 1, the day of his son's 14th birthday, he slipped out of 
the house and drove up through the hills to a Laurel Canyon park. 
</P>
<P>
According to Leigh, Rappaport went to one of his favorite spots. He said hello 
to people on the path and passed the man and his dog who would later find him. 
Deep in the park, Rappaport chose a bramble-covered spot on the hillside. 
</P>
<P>
He climbed through the brush, said Leigh, and in a small clearing laid himself 
to rest on his back, facing the treetops. 
</P>
<P>
Leigh imagines Rappaport looking at the green foliage and the uncommonly blue 
sky, and speaking in his heart to Adonai, the Jewish God he loved so much. He 
might have whispered a prayer for himself and his loved ones, a Kaddish, the 
prayer of life that is used in times of death. 
</P>
<P>
Then David Rappaport pulled up his pistol, pointed it downward at his chest, 
and shot himself through the heart. His funeral was held Tuesday in London. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have a clue that he was depressed," said Marsha Goodman, who worked 
with Rappaport on the upcoming DIC Enterprises animated series, "Captain 
Planet," for which he played the voice of a robot. "I guess he's a very good 
actor because we never saw that pain in his work at all. He was always telling 
us about all these projects in the works, scripts he was writing. He was 
engaged and he was planning to get married and he was so happy." 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood had been unusually kind to Rappaport. He was the first dwarf ever to 
star in his own television series, CBS' "The Wizard," and until recently had 
been a regular guest star on "L.A. Law." 
</P>
<P>
He was to begin shooting in September on a movie that had been a dream project 
for more than three years, Carol Ann Cline's "The Poet," the story of a dwarf 
poet in a Welsh village. 
</P>
<P>
Rappaport first became known in this country when he starred in the 1981 movie, 
"Time Bandits." A supporting role in "The Bride," a remake of "Frankenstein" 
starring Jennifer Beals and Sting, landed him solidly in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
And in the kaleidoscope of fast times that mark the lives of many in the film 
business, the fact that Rappaport did everything with lightening speed and 
unbridled passion didn't seem unusual. He fit right in. 
</P>
<P>
"He was wild," said actor Doug Barr, who co-starred opposite Rappaport on "The 
Wizard." "He went out all the time. He liked to go to clubs, go dancing. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a cappuccino freak. He drank cappuccino all day long. (On "The 
Wizard,") he made the prop guys install a cappuccino machine in his dressing 
room." 
</P>
<P>
He was born David Stephen Rappaport in 1952, the son of Orthodox Jews living in 
the working class borough of Islington in North London. 
</P>
<P>
His parents made a gentle home in a hard area. There, among the street vendors 
and laborers who peopled that part of London, Dinah and Mark Rappaport held 
weekly Sabbath dinners, attended each Friday by grandparents, cousins, aunts 
and uncles. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Rappaports instilled in David a reverence for Jewish ritual and 
culture which he later said helped him understand and live within his stunted 
body. 
</P>
<P>
The Rappaports taught their two sons that life was to be approached with vigor. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Rappaport, who worked as a taxi driver and in the garment industry while 
David was growing up, lived his own philosophy: at the age of 50 he went to 
university, and became a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
By the time David was 5 years old, he was already several inches shorter than 
his playmates. His parents took him for tests in London, where they learned 
that he had a form of epiphyseal displasia, a type of dwarfism in which the 
torso grows, but the arms and legs are stunted and the fingers and toes are 
stubby and thick. 
</P>
<P>
As an adult in Hollywood, Rappaport had often said that his mission was to 
change people's minds about little people. His own life was a prolonged attempt 
to just be normal: full-sized friends and lovers, little or no contact with 
other dwarfs. 
</P>
<P>
"We all loved him and knew him and didn't think about it -- none of his friends 
were really aware that he was different," said Leigh, who was already a 
successful manager when she encouraged her cousin to come to the United States 
four years ago. "But every time he was interviewed, every single time, he was 
asked about being small. He couldn't get away from it." 
</P>
<P>
Talk show host Arsenio Hall, for example, began his interview with Rappaport by 
making fun of the term "little people" as a more socially acceptable way of 
referring to people who are dwarfs, and then asked Rappaport how he could make 
love with a full-sized woman. 
</P>
<P>
Dinah and Mark Rappaport had tried to shield their child from such prying. 
Wanting him to grow up feeling normal and loved, they delayed telling him about 
his condition. But finally, when their son was 7, they couldn't escape it. 
</P>
<P>
"He asked his parents why he never got any new clothes, why his brother was 
always getting new clothes," said Leigh. "And they told him, he's getting new 
clothes because he's growing, and it doesn't look like you're going to grow 
very much." 
</P>
<P>
And so David grew up on the inside, if not the outside. Extremely intelligent, 
he excelled in school and played the piano, flute and drums. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a couple of years older, so it seemed natural to me that he would be a 
little bit smaller," recalled Leigh. "I adored him, and when we were together I 
always used to pick him up and give him a kiss. But one day when we were a 
little older I picked him up and he got very angry. He said, 'I'm not a little 
child, you know.' " 
</P>
<P>
It became terribly important to David that he be accepted despite his height, 
according to his own later writings. The road to that acceptance was, for him, 
personality and intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
"My friends with whom I had laughed and fought and played with were leaving me 
behind," Rappaport said in a half-hour monologue written last year for the 
British television show, "Opinions." "They were growing upwards, something I 
knew I would never do." 
</P>
<P>
Relations with adults, he said, were even worse: "I was below them, childlike. 
An unknown. Not to be taken seriously. A threat." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes as a young man he would stand on a chair at parties, to see if people 
treated him better if he appeared to be as tall as they. "I would win the 
attention of a woman (from across the room)," he said. "Then when she came 
close enough to see that half my height was really made up of chair, the 
conversation would quickly come to an end." 
</P>
<P>
After high school, Rappaport studied psychology at the University of Bristol. 
There he learned the history of dwarfs, the little people whose heritage was 
his. 
</P>
<P>
He discovered that Atilla the Hun was a dwarf, as were Alexander Pope and Henri 
de Toulouse-Lautrec. Dwarfs were revered in ancient Egypt and other cultures, 
where they were believed to be in touch with the spirit world. The Irish 
consider a dwarf good luck. 
</P>
<P>
He married -- Jane Rappaport is normal size -- had a son, Joe, and took a job 
as a teacher. He spent nearly 10 years trying to inspire 8-year-olds no smaller 
than he. 
</P>
<P>
Since the demise of "The Wizard" in 1987, Rappaport had not had starring roles, 
although he worked steadily. 
</P>
<P>
Some have speculated that part of the despair which led to his suicide might 
have been emotional fallout from the end of the series, and the elimination of 
his lawyer character from "L.A. Law." 
</P>
<P>
"Being different in the theater and film and television is what you want -- 
it's OK to be different in this industry," said Nina Tassler, his agent at 
Triad Artists. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of losing the stage, she postulated, might have represented losing the 
ability to be accepted despite his differences. 
</P>
<P>
Interviews with friends and co-workers paint Rappaport as a man who put up a 
good front, and who virtually never talked about his problems. Among his 
friends, he was the one who listened when somebody had a problem. 
</P>
<P>
He never talked to anybody. Not about his divorce from Jane, who remained in 
England with Joe, not about his height, not about his career unless it was part 
of planning for the future. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't really confide in anyone, not even his fiancee Eliza, a dancer more 
than 10 years his junior, who wouldn't be interviewed or provide her surname. 
</P>
<P>
"Actors become actors for very specific reasons, and perhaps that is one key to 
David," said Tassler. "On stage you get to experience a range of emotions, work 
out dreams, ideas, anger, fear (that might remain hidden in normal life.) It's 
an arena where you can experiment and release things that are inside of you." 
</P>
<P>
Actor Billy Barty, like Rappaport a dwarf and a founder of the Little People of 
America support group, said that Rappaport never came around to the group's 
meetings or consulted its counselors. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have loved to have talked to him," Barty said. "But I didn't want to 
force him." 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean Rappaport wasn't searching. He and Eliza went to a half-dozen 
synagogues in a year, trying to find the one that would bring the answers David 
knew God held for him. 
</P>
<P>
He was small, he'd said, because God had a special plan for him. 
</P>
<P>
He once told the Associated Press: "I look at (normal) boring people every day 
and I say, 'God, I wish I could be like that.' But my lot is to be unique, 
special, so I have to put up with it." 
</P>
<P>
Rappaport searched for his God in the synagogue, at Friday night dinners at 
Leigh's home in West Hollywood, and in nature. He was an avid swimmer, spending 
part of most afternoons at the pool at the Roosevelt Hotel or at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
He appeared unstoppable, always traveling, writing as much as acting, playing 
jazz piano with his stubby little fingers. 
</P>
<P>
And then one day, he did stop. After the first suicide attempt, Rappaport sat 
at his home in the Hollywood Hills, or at Leigh's, still not talking, but 
suddenly not doing very much moving. 
</P>
<P>
The record in his head, he said, was spinning, and he couldn't turn it off. 
"I'm all fuzzy," he told Leigh. 
</P>
<P>
He began to see a counselor, who prescribed antidepressants. 
</P>
<P>
But David had always handled things his own way. He had wrenched himself out of 
Cockney London, out of a possible life as a victim or freak and into the bright 
lights of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
It was he who had counseled others, "You have to make your life happen." 
</P>
<P>
So David Rappaport decided it was time to make his death happen. In the woods, 
facing God, facing the sky. 
</P>
<P>
"Life is a joke," he'd said on "Opinions." "Anything that makes us laugh, that 
is surprising, is a joke. Under that definition, I am a joke. I am a surprise. 
I am unusual . . . I am the wild card. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"That may seem painful to some people, to most people, but it only hurts when 
you don't get the joke."

FUGITIVE ANARCHIST STATES HIS CASE AFTER DECADE OF SECRECY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
For 10 years, Pascuale Valitutti kept his political convictions a secret as he 
traveled the world. To the tourists and artisans he met in Europe, Asia and 
Latin America, he was a simple trader of arts and crafts, a quiet and 
unassuming man with a wife and two children. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in a Los Angeles prison after being detained by U.S. immigration 
authorities, the fugitive anarchist has decided to speak his mind. 
</P>
<P>
Valitutti, 43, is an unrepentant revolutionary. Charged by an Italian court in 
the failed 1977 kidnaping of the son of a wealthy Florence industrialist, he 
fled Italy in 1981, living mostly in France and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"In these months here, I've recuperated a little bit of my identity," Valitutti 
said last week in an interview at the federal Metropolitan Detention Center. "I 
spent 20 years of my youth and adult life struggling for political rights. But 
in these last 10 years, when people ask me what I do, I can only tell them I 
sell these trinkets." 
</P>
<P>
Valitutti was later convicted in absentia of the kidnaping. After agreeing last 
week to allow his extradition, Valitutti might return to Italy as soon as this 
week, according to his attorney, David E. Wood. 
</P>
<P>
In the interview, which was conducted in Spanish -- one of three languages he 
speaks fluently -- Valitutti denied participating in the violent acts for which 
the Italian government sought to have him extradited. He said the Italian 
authorities are persecuting him for his political beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
"According to Italian law, these charges would be dropped if I renounced my 
political beliefs," Valitutti said. "But I don't want to sell my conscience. . 
. . I don't understand why the Italian government insists on doing this. To 
force someone to renounce their political convictions by threatening them is 
not a victory. It is like a rape, a violation." 
</P>
<P>
To speak to Valitutti is to be transported to a tumultuous period in Italian 
history -- the late 1960s and early '70s, a time of labor unrest, bombings, 
politically motivated kidnapings, and shoot-outs between carabinieri (police) 
and armed bands of "terrorists." 
</P>
<P>
Idealistic young student radicals such as Valitutti felt that the collapse of 
the "fascistic" Italian establishment was imminent. "It was a wonderful time, a 
wonderful struggle," Valitutti said. "They were very difficult years, but very 
beautiful. People fought for what they believed in." 
</P>
<P>
Valitutti became a nationally known figure in Italy when he played a small but 
important role in one of the most sensational cases in modern Italian political 
history, the death of anarchist Giuseppe Pinelli. The case was later dramatized 
in "Accidental Death of an Anarchist," a play by Dario Fo. 
</P>
<P>
Pinelli was suspected in the terrorist bombing of a Milan bank that killed 16 
people. He was being interrogated at Milan police headquarters when he fell 
from a fourth-floor window. Milan police said Pinelli had committed suicide in 
a moment of despair, yelling "Anarchy is dead!" as he fell to the street below. 
</P>
<P>
But Valitutti, who was being held by police in an adjacent room, contradicted 
the police version of events. "Before the interrogation, (Pinelli) was talking 
to me about his wife and family," Valitutti said. "He didn't sound like a man 
who would kill himself. He was completely calm and serene." 
</P>
<P>
Valitutti said he heard scuffling sounds from the room, suggesting Pinelli was 
pushed from the window. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1970s, Valitutti's testimony placed a key police official in the 
interrogation room, initiating a major political scandal that embarrassed the 
Italian government. The police official was later assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
After he was arrested for the 1977 kidnaping, Valitutti's health declined. 
While in prison, he temporarily lapsed into a coma and eventually was released 
on bail in 1981. He fled to Nice in southern France, where he and his wife, 
Carmen, set up a cottage industry importing arts and crafts from Asia and Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
For the Italian government, Valitutti was a fugitive "terrorist." In 1983, an 
Italian court named him as one of the founders of Anzione Rivoluzionaria 
(Revolutionary Action), a terrorist criminal organization. 
</P>
<P>
Valitutti, however, said he and his wife spent most of their time as fugitives 
raising two children, who are now 10 and 12 years old. For a decade, Valitutti 
said, they were a family on the run, renting homes in Nice and in the Mexican 
cities of Cuernavaca and Toluca. 
</P>
<P>
Carla Valitutti, 34, said her children were aware their father could be 
arrested at any time. They watched, in fact, as he was detained last November 
by U.S. immigration officials when the family arrived at Los Angeles 
International Airport on a flight from Sri Lanka. 
</P>
<P>
"(The children) knew he was persecuted by the Italian government, so the shock 
was not too hard," Carla Valitutti said. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a prison-issue red jumpsuit, Pascuale Valitutti, a large, lumbering 
man whose beard is tinged with gray, spoke without bitterness about his latest 
run-in with the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I felt like something very important had been taken from me," 
Valitutti said of his incarceration. "My wife and children were left here alone 
in a city they didn't know." Later, he said, "I realized I was in a country 
with a judicial system where I could defend myself." 
</P>
<P>
Valitutti resisted the Italian government's attempts to extradite him. But he 
relented after the Italian Ministry of Grace and Justice signed a letter in 
April promising he would not be incarcerated for crimes other that the 1977 
kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
Valitutti's attorney said he expects his client will be released soon after his 
return to Italy. 
</P>
<P>
But Valitutti said he is concerned that the Italian government might not honor 
the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certain elements in Italy that want revenge" for the events of the 
1970s, he said. "The memories of that time are still very fresh."

<TEXT>
<P>
Carl R. (Spitz) Channell, a conservative political fund-raiser who became the 
first person convicted in the Iran-Contra scandal, has died. 
</P>
<P>
Channell, 44, died Sunday in a Washington hospital of pneumonia related to 
injuries suffered in a car accident. 
</P>
<P>
Former Rep. Dan Kuykendall, a friend of Channell who worked on pro-Contra 
causes during the time Channell also was involved, said Channell had been 
undergoing chemotherapy for lung cancer and had recovered enough to do 
consulting work. 
</P>
<P>
But about two months ago, as he was getting out of his car near his office in 
southeast Washington, he was struck by a car, according to Kuykendall, a 
Tennessee Republican who is now a Capitol Hill lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
Channell operated a motel in West Virginia until 1979 when he became a major 
national fund-raiser for conservative causes. He founded or controlled numerous 
conservative organizations, including two political action committees, a 
tax-exempt foundation and Western Goals, an organization co-founded by the John 
Birch Society. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Channell pleaded guilty to using his nonprofit National Endowment for 
the Preservation of Liberty to raise more than $2 million to arm the Nicaraguan 
Contra rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, he was sentenced to two years of probation for conspiring to 
defraud the government of taxes due on the money he and former White House aide 
Oliver North raised for the guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
Channell's confession was part of an agreement reached in exchange for his 
testimony against North, the fired National Security Council aide identified as 
the chief operator in covert U.S. arms sales to Iran and the diversion of 
profits to the Contras.
