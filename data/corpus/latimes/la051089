<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps it was inevitable, but tensions on the increasingly congested local 
roadways seem to be spilling over into a new arena: parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
Score cards ready? Boxer Mike Tyson is accused of cuffing an attendant who 
tried to prevent Tyson's party from docking in a reserved spot at a Hollywood 
night club . . . two limousine drivers vying for the same spot at a Lucky 
supermarket in Redondo Beach draw guns on each other . . . two Palos Verdes 
Estates women are hauled off to jail after allegedly erasing the meter-maid's 
chalk marks on their tires. 
</P>
<P>
And now. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Actor Clint Eastwood has been sued for $101,000 by a woman who says the actor 
ruined her day by allegedly ramming her parked car with his used pickup truck 
on the Burbank Studios lot. The plaintiff, Stacy McLaughlin, an executive with 
an animation company, made the mistake of leaving her car in Eastwood's spot 
while making a delivery. She also claims that the celluloid cowboy threatened 
to break the car's windows with a hammer if it wasn't moved. 
</P>
<P>
Eastwood, who is already a defendant in a palimony suit filed by actress Sondra 
Locke, "is not available for comment," a spokesman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The renaming of the Skyline Equestrian Trail in the San Gabriel Valley for 
County Supervisor Pete Schabarum is a reminder of Schabarum's interest in 
transit. He did, after all, unsuccessfully seek the secretary of transportation 
post in President Bush's cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
And the christening also follows the recent trend of naming geographical spots 
for politicians while they're still alive -- and even still in office. 
</P>
<P>
Such was not always the case. The fountain bearing the likeness of 
early-century U.S. Sen. Frank Flint on the south lawn of City Hall was a 
posthumous tribute. (The fountain has since been turned off after the body of a 
transient was found floating there.) Fletcher Bowron Square, named in honor of 
the Los Angeles' mayor from 1938 to 1953, was installed in the Los Angeles City 
Mall years after Bowron's death. 
</P>
<P>
But nowadays, more and more politicians are living to see their tributes. Mayor 
Tom Bradley's name graces a terminal at Los Angeles International Airport. A 
Century City businessman will soon have his name on a skyscraper: the Ronald 
Reagan State Office Building. And the Century Freeway has been renamed for Rep. 
Glenn M. Anderson (D-Harbor City), a nice honor if the freeway is ever 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
Who started the trend locally? It may have been San Pedro Assemblyman Vincent 
Thomas, who consented to having a site -- the bridge connecting San Pedro and 
Terminal Island -- named in his honor while he was still in office in the early 
1960s. Ironically, Thomas was later defeated for reelection. And, now 25 years 
after it was built, visitors sometimes confuse the span with a religious order 
and call it the "St. Vincent Thomas Bridge." 
</P>
<P>
If the streets around Sunset and Gower are more jammed up than usual on the 
evening of May 17, the news figures to get out over the air waves quickly. KNX 
radio is hosting a Traffic Tipsters Party at the station. 
</P>
<P>
Why kick it off at 6 p.m., right in the middle of what KNX traffic reporter 
Bill Keene calls the "rush-hour rodeo?" Make it more of a challenge for the 
invitees? 
</P>
<P>
"We thought of having it on a weekend," said Keene, "but the tipsters told us 
they preferred a weekday evening because they didn't know if they'd be in town 
on a weekend." 
</P>
<P>
Invitations have been sent out to actors Chevy Chase and Angie Dickinson and 
about 400 other car-phone commandos who have called in traffic bulletins 
regularly for at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
Keene isn't sure whether to invite another sometime KNX correspondent, Roman 
Catholic Archbishop Roger Mahony. Mahony was invited last year but "sent us 
back a very nice letter saying he was booked up solid," Keene said. "I'm not 
sure this is the sort of thing he'd attend."

PITCHING GAMBLE PAYING OFF FOR BRAVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
What a difference a year makes. Last season the Atlanta Braves were the doormat 
of the National League, finishing 39 1/2 games behind the Dodgers in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, behind the six-hit pitching of John Smoltz, the Braves beat the 
Phillies, 7-2, at Philadelphia for their sixth consecutive victory. The Braves 
moved into fourth place with a 16-17 record; the Dodgers are 15-16. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves committed themselves to a young pitching staff in 1988 and their 
record suffered while Tom Glavine and Smoltz learned to pitch in the majors. 
Glavine was 7-17 and Smoltz 2-7. 
</P>
<P>
Glavine is 4-0 this season and, with his second consecutive complete game, 
Smoltz is 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
Until the winning streak, the Braves were getting good pitching but couldn't 
score. During the streak, however, they have scored 52 runs. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 4, Chicago 2 -- It didn't take the Cubs long to find out how much 
they will miss Andre Dawson, who will have surgery to remove torn cartilage in 
his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
Against the Giant pitching tandem of Mike Krukow (2-0) and Craig Lefferts, the 
Cubs had only four hits and one earned run in the loss at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Dawson's replacement in right field, Mitch Webster, dropped a fly ball in the 
sixth, allowing two unearned runs to score. 
</P>
<P>
Krukow, with a history of arm problems, left when his arm stiffened after seven 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike kept them off-balance, used all his pitches and threw strikes," Manager 
Roger Craig said. "You can't ask for more." 
</P>
<P>
New York 3, Cincinnati 1 -- Last season, his first in the National League, 
Danny Jackson was the league's toughest left-hander. He was a 23-game winner 
and had 15 complete games, best in the league. 
</P>
<P>
After beating the Dodgers in the opener this season, Jackson hasn't won since. 
</P>
<P>
Against a Met team that had been shut out twice in a row, Jackson lost his 
sixth consecutive game. He failed to go the distance for the eighth game in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets ended a scoreless string of 27 innings when they scored three runs in 
the fifth inning in their victory at Cincinnati. In their previous four games, 
they had scored a total of five runs. 
</P>
<P>
Sid Fernandez improved to 4-1. Met shortstop Kevin Elster made an error in the 
ninth inning to end his record errorless streak at 88 games. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 4, San Diego 3 -- Tony Pena hit a seventh-inning home run off Greg 
Harris at St. Louis to break a 3-3 tie, and Todd Worrell held on through the 
ninth for the save. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres had two on and one out when Jack Clark bounced back to Worrell for 
the second out. Later, with the bases loaded, Randy Ready flied out to end the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' run in the fourth ended rookie Ken Hill's scoreless string at 24 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
The victory put the Cardinals (17-13) into a tie for first place in the East 
with the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 4, Houston 2 -- Wallace Johnson hit his first home run in two years, 
and Dennis Martinez gave up five hits in 8 1/3 innings at as the Expos won at 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Scott (4-2), who missed his previous start because of a hamstring problem, 
was the loser. He gave up three runs and seven hits in eight innings. He had 
only three strikeouts. DAN HAFNER

<P>
Brad Gilbert and Michael Chang, the top two seeded players, were extended to 
three sets by two qualifiers before winning their first-round matches Tuesday 
in the $220,000 U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships at Charleston, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert trailed, 5-2, in the first set before defeating Joey Rive of Ft. 
Lauderdale, Fla., 7-6, (10-8), 3-6, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Chang didn't get the edge over Jimmy Brown of Largo, Fla., until the ninth game 
of the third set when he broke Brown's serve to take a 5-4 lead. Chang, who 
often came to the net, then served out the match for a 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory on 
the cold, windy day. 
</P>
<P>
"In this kind of situation, I had to come into the net because I wasn't going 
to put the ball away from the back," Chang said. 
</P>
<P>
Goran Ivanisevic of Yugoslavia upset defending champion Kent Carlsson of 
Sweden, 7-5, 4-6, 6-1, in the second round of the German Open men's tournament 
at Hamburg, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic, 16, was a quarterfinalist at the Australian Open and a semifinalist 
at the Nice tournament last month. In another upset, Jan Gunnarsson of Sweden 
defeated Andrei Chesnokov of the Soviet Union, 6-4, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Connors advanced with a 6-4, 6-3 victory over qualifier Markus Zoecke of 
West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Manuela Maleeva led a parade of favorites through the second round of the 
Italian Open women's championships at Rome. 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Maleeva of Bulgaria defeated Italy's Barbara Romano, 6-3, 6-2, 
third-seeded Helen Kelesi of Canada defeated 17-year-old Silvia Farina of 
Italy, 6-2, 6-2, and fourth-seeded Aranxta Sanchez eliminated Linda Ferrando of 
Italy, 7-5, 6-1.

FISH REPORT: CATFISH BREAKING OUT, ESPECIALLY AT CASITAS, PYRAMID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Catfish are biting at most Southland reservoirs and fishermen at Ventura 
County's Lake Casitas and Los Angeles County's Pyramid Lake appear to be doing 
best. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Tieso of Carpinteria caught a 21-pound catfish at Casitas and Rick 
Sandford and Mark Ruben of West Covina teamed to catch seven catfish totaling 
33 pounds at Pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
WILLOW BEACH -- River level low and trout bite generally slow, with most fish 
taken up river. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE MEAD -- Striped bass biting throughout lake, with bigger fish coming from 
Overton Arm and Vegas Wash. Anchovies best bet. Largemouth bass biting to 20 
feet in coves and near dropoffs. Waterdogs best bet. Catfish picking up, biting 
on anchovies and nightcrawlers. 
</P>
<P>
BULLHEAD CITY -- Striped bass bite good in river, with most fish between one 
and three pounds. David Cherry, Bullhead City, 16-pound striper. Catfish 
between three and five pounds biting in river and lake. Other species slow. 
</P>
<P>
SALTON SEA -- Orangemouth corvina bite good, with live bait working best. Fish 
in the 10-pound class common. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CACHUMA -- Largemouth bass taking dark plastic worms, biting to 20 feet in 
coves and near dropoffs. Trout biting throughout lake. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CASITAS -- Largemouth bass biting along east shoreline and Sunken Island 
at 15-25 feet, most baits working. Mike Novac, Camarillo, 12-pound bass. 
Catfish biting at 20 feet. Mackerel best bet. Trout biting best on Power Bait 
at Wadleigh Arm. Greg Moter, 3 1/4-pound trout. 
</P>
<P>
PYRAMID LAKE -- Catfish bite very good, with dam best bet. Largemouth and 
smallmouth bass bites strong. Several limits. Striped bass bite slow despite 
good conditions. Bob Hanley, Westchester, 14-pound striper. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE PIRU -- Trout fishing good in San Felicia Cove and dam. Power Bait and 
gold lures. Largemouth bass biting in rocky areas. Jim Wells, Fillmore, 7 
1/2-pound bass. Catfish picking up, working their way toward north end of lake. 
</P>
<P>

Catfish and crappie bites fair. 
</P>
<P>
IRVINE LAKE -- Catfish bite strong in shallows, some biting at two feet. Trout 
bite fair, with some upwards of 10 pounds. Bluegills biting on minijigs. 
</P>
<P>

pounds. Catfish picking up, averaging five pounds. 
</P>
<P>
BRIDGEPORT -- Big browns started biting on Lower Twin Lake. The Bringhurst 
brothers of Apple Valley, using the new "Alive" compound on wet lures, caught 
17 fish 2-8 pounds. Carmen Lake has produced brook trout up to 4 3/4 pounds and

Lake on trout-colored rapala. Jerry Meeks, Burbank, 4-9 rainbow shorefishing in 
June Lake with Power Bait. 
</P>
<P>
MAMMOTH -- Cooling trend this weekend, with possible rain. Hot Creek has been 
tough, with lots of fishing pressure. Nymphs best, with an indicator and enough 
weight to sink to the bottom. The Owens at Benton Crossing is very slow, but 
the Owens River at Big Springs has good action for rainbows 12-20 inches, using 
nymphs for catching or dry flies for excitement. The Twin Lakes at Mammoth have 
had action in the evening, trolling and casting flies from float tubes. 
Shorefishing slow. At Crowley Lake, trout not interested in flies. Boats with 
scopes indicate fish on the bottom feeding on fly hatches. Lures good for 
limits at Convict Lake, rainbows 2-3 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
BISHOP -- Big browns and rainbows coming from Big Pine Creek, using worms and 
mini-micro marshmallows. Catches in the river 3-4 pounds with baby

AS A GUIDE, 'EL PESCADOR' CERTAINLY LIVED UP TO HIS NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Not getting the results they expected in the normally bountiful waters off Baja 
California's Bahia de los Angeles, Brian Wallace and Matt Gerns were fortunate 
to be befriended by a townsman named Rafael, known around town as el pescador, 
the fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
With his help, they became the talk of the town. 
</P>
<P>
After volunteering to serve as a guide, Rafael climbed aboard Gerns' 16-foot 
boat at dawn on May 1 and directed the pair to an area 22 miles offshore, a few 
hundred yards off Isla Angel de la Guarda, the biggest of the Midriff chain. 
</P>
<P>
Using landmarks to find the spot he had boasted about the night before, he 
instructed Gerns to stop. The pair rigged 150-pound-test monofilament leaders 
-- attached to 60-pound-test line -- with cuts of mackerel, which they dropped 
260 feet to the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Giant sea bass, Rafael said, would be there for the taking. A bold statement 
considering that giant sea bass are about as hard to find as they are to catch. 
</P>
<P>
But the pair hooked up almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"(Rafael) told us to pull real hard and to reel as fast and as hard as we can 
for as long as we can before giving the fish a little line," said Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
That worked, and after a 25-minute struggle, Wallace, of Calabasas, had brought 
to the surface a 190-pound giant sea bass, something most saltwater fishermen 
never see in a lifetime. Shortly thereafter, Gerns, of Woodland Hills, landed 
one weighing 270 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
And their day had just begun. 
</P>
<P>
"We went back and tied those to a rock on the beach and went right back out," 
Wallace said. "And I hooked up again immediately." 
</P>
<P>
Its air bladder bulging from the rapid change in pressure, the giant fish rose 
on its own after a 30- minute struggle, breaking the surface "like a 
submarine," Wallace said. Because the local scale was too small to accommodate 
such a fish, it was gutted -- to avoid spoiling the flesh -- and taken to a 
larger scale on the back of an ice truck. "We weighed the big one with its 
gills and guts in buckets," Wallace said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like butchering a cow," Gerns said. 
</P>
<P>
At 370 pounds it looked like one, too. 
</P>
<P>
As the news of the catch spread, the local fishermen flocked to the area the 
next morning to get in on the action. 
</P>
<P>
"There were nine boats full of locals," Gerns said. "Everybody took the day 
off." 
</P>
<P>
But el pescador had accurately set the Gerns' boat above the only productive 
area and two more fish -- at 160 pounds apiece -- were hauled aboard while the 
frustrated onlookers shook their heads. 
</P>
<P>
Said Gus Velez of Baja Fishing Tours, which specializes in Midriff Island 
trips: "I've seen one 395-pounder in my life. Usually there are three or four 
caught a year that weigh between 90 and 150 pounds. But five -- that's really 
rare." 
</P>
<P>
So says el pescador, who in 15 years at the sleepy fishing village, claims to 
have caught just 13 before hooking up with Wallace and Gerns. And they, after 
eating sea bass meatball soup, sea bass burritos and just plain sea bass, 
donated the fish to his family. 
</P>
<P>
Whitewater rafting is on a comeback in Northern California, according to 
operators, despite three consecutive dry years for California overall. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Ashburn of EarthTrek Expeditions, based in Santa Ana, said: "Rainfall in 
Northern California is 100% of normal and the rivers are flowing high." 
</P>
<P>
The South Fork of the American River, the state's most popular run, "is seeing 
its best flow in many years," according to a survey by the Sacramento Bee, and 
should be able to go all summer. 
</P>
<P>
But central California's precipitation has been only about 80% of normal, so 
runs such as the Tuolumne, Kings and Kern will probably last only into June. 
</P>
<P>
Nate Rangel of the Adventure Connection, chairman of the Western River Guides 
Assn., suggested that people phone (800) 552-3625 for the latest information on 
particular rivers. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly

Prince Charles will be seen on CBS' "West 57th" Saturday night in one of his 
infrequent American television interviews. Selina Scott talked with the prince 
April 20 at Sandringham, a Royal Family estate seldom visited by the press. On 
the program (10 p.m., Channels 2 and 8), the prince says he has matured in his 
role as the future king of England and has gained confidence in his own 
judgment. "I was never certain that the feelings I had were worth expressing. 
But now, I feel much more determined about them, and I think it's probably 
something that happens to you when you reach 40." ALEENE MacMINN

With six of the Top 10 shows, NBC finished first in the prime-time ratings last 
week for the 46th week in a row, tying the record for most consecutive 
victories by a network. CBS previously accomplished that feat during the 
1962-63 season. The A.C. Nielsen ratings released Tuesday showed that NBC's 
prime-time programs averaged an audience of 12.4 million homes last week, 
compared to about 11.2 million for CBS and 10.6 million for ABC. The full list 
of ratings is on Page 10. 
</P>
<P>
* Highlighting ABC's woes was the performance of "War and Remembrance" Sunday 
night, which attracted only 21% of the available viewers from 8 to 11 p.m. The 
13.4 rating -- representing 12.1 million homes -- was about 5 ratings points 
lower than what ABC had promised advertisers, meaning the network will have to 
give them free commercial time later to make up the difference.

The voice of Judy Jetson in the full-length animated feature "Jetsons: The 
Movie" will be that of pop singing star Tiffany, not Janet Waldo, who was 
Judy's original voice. Tiffany also performs three new songs on the sound track 
of the Hanna-Barbera film. Joseph Barbera said through a spokesman that 
"Tiffany's voice is so promiment in the musical segments of the film that we 
decided to feature her in the spoken part as well." A fully recorded sound 
track with Waldo was thrown out. Speculation that Tiffany was brought in to 
attract a teen audience could not be confirmed. Hanna-Barbera said that the 
decision was made by Universal, the film's distributor. Universal could not be 
reached for comment at press time. The picture is due to be released at 
Christmas.

Political correspondent Linda Wertheimer, a familiar voice to National Public 
Radio listeners, will become a host of NPR's "All Things Considered" program 
starting Monday. She'll be part of a rotating roster with Robert Siegel and 
Noah Adams that will allow each of the hosts time away from the microphone to 
pursue signature pieces and in-depth stories. Wertheimer has been covering 
politics for NPR since 19771. ALEENE MacMINN

The Paris production of "Cats" has won the Moliere Award, France's version of 
the Tony Award, as the best musical of the year. The award was accepted by the 
show's director-choreographer Gillian Lynne. Lynne is also the musical stager 
and choreographer of "The Phantom of the Opera" and is en route to Los Angeles 
to begin rehearsals for that production. ALEENE MacMINN

Her-r-r-r-e's Jesse?: The Chicago Tribune reported Tuesday that Jesse Jackson 
may host a weekly TV talk show this fall that would be produced by King World 
Productions, the company that syndicates such hits as "Wheel of Fortune" and 
"The Oprah Winfrey Show." However, Frank Watkins, a Jackson spokesman, told

JAZZ NOTES : JAZZ MOBILE WEST TO KICK OFF NEW SERIES; AKIYOSHI TRIO OPENS AT 
VINE ST. BAR &amp; GRILL

Jazz Mobile West, a series of 15 free jazz concerts to be held at locations in 
the greater Los Angeles area, kicks off with a noon bash on May 19, at the 
Rotunda of Los Angeles City Hall. Modeled after the original Jazz Mobile, 
formed in New York in 1965, Jazz Mobile West is presented by the Los Angeles 
Jazz Society, with help from grants from the City of Los Angeles and the Music 
Performance Trust Fund, Local 47. 
</P>
<P>
Jazz Mobile West will feature performances by trumpeter Al Aarons, saxman 
Herman Riley, pianist Gildo Mahones, bassist Allan Jackson, and drummer Kenny 
Dennis. The band will play both public venues and schools -- including Point 
Fermin Park in San Pedro, the ABC Entertainment Center in Century City and the 
Canoga Park Elementary School. "We scheduled many of the concerts at schools 
because they need all the help they can get with arts enrichment programs," 
said Teri Aarons, LAJS president. 
</P>
<P>
Several people's efforts brought the project to fruition, Aarons added, 
including Chuck Niles, who will emcee all the events, and drummer Earl Palmer. 
Aarons was particularly pleased that Mayor Tom Bradley supported the program 
with a recommendation for a grant. 
</P>
<P>
Information: (213) 469-6800.

PIANIST'S VISIT: Though pianist-composer Toshiko Akiyoshi's Jazz Orchestra -- 
which the current Manhattan resident formed while living in the Southland with 
her husband, reedman Lew Tabackin, from 1972-1982 -- played only 30 dates in 
1988 ("It was miserable," she said), both Akiyoshi and Tabackin were able to 
work regularly as instrumentalists, making the year a financial success. 
</P>
<P>
Among the spots where Akiyoshi, the be-bop-based pianist -- who opens a 
four-night engagement with her trio at the Vine St. Bar &amp; Grill in 
Hollywood tonight -- played last year were Rio de Janeiro and Zurich. In 
Zurich, she worked with bassist Jimmy Woode, a former Ellington band member, 
and drummer Ed Thigpen, formerly with Oscar Peterson and Bud Powell. "We had a 
really good time because they swing so hard," said Akiyoshi, whose latest LP is 
"Interlude" (Concord Jazz). 
</P>
<P>
In July, Akiyoshi and Tabackin travel with the Jazz Orchestra to Japan. Of 
particular interest will be her concert in Fukuoka, on the island of Kyushu, 
where she'll debut a commissioned work. "Fukuoka was important in my life," she 
said. "I lived there from 1947 to '48 and it was the first time I played with 
big bands." 
</P>
<P>
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT: If Akiyoshi plays in a sometimes intense, somewhat 
complicated manner, pianist-composer Peter Kater, who appears with saxophonist 
Bob Redholz at At My Place Saturday, takes another tack. The pieces on his 
latest "Homage" (Gaia) LP are soft and soothing without the snap-crackle 
associated with modern jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Many people would call his stuff New Age, but not Kater. "I play contemporary 
piano music, although it follows such chart categories as New Acoustic or New 
Adult Contemporary," Kater said. 
</P>
<P>
Kater, currently touring the Southwest and West Coast with Redholz, enjoys the 
sparse blend of saxophone and piano. "A duo retains all the intimacy of a solo 
piano concert," said Kater, "plus you have another instrument that allows much 
more diversity." 
</P>
<P>
**** "Monstrosity" (CSULA 888, available from (213) 343-4060) finds the 
first-rate Cal State Los Angeles Jazz Ensemble tearing through a handful of 
vital originals -- Jose Arellano's title track and director David Caffey's 
"Samba de Linda" among them -- and a couple of Woody Shaw cookers. Solid solos 
from the likes of saxophonists Sharon Hirata and Randall Willis and trombonists 
Luis Bonilla and Gary Smith abound. . . .

STIRRING SOUNDS ON THE WESTSIDE

<P>
Africa and Bulgaria came within a mile or so of each other over the weeekend, 
as a Paris-based Zairian and a Bulgarian ensemble brought their distinctive 
music to the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
The Zairian pop sound known as soukous is usually described as light and 
lilting, but those adjectives didn't apply to Kanda Bongo Man's stirring local 
debut at the Music Machine. The singer's relentlessly up-tempo 90-minute set 
left the capacity audience sweat-drenched and exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
The backing quartet didn't even need the excitement-boosting assistance of 
Kanda Bongo Man's dance routines -- not with those roller-coaster melodies and 
crystalline guitar lines, and with dynamic drummer Ty-Jan incessantly exploding 
snare-shot bombs over, under, around and through the arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
The seven-member Bulgarian troupe Balkana took a more ethereal tack during its 
90-minute set earlier in the evening at McCabe's. It was easy to understand why 
Bulgarian music has fascinated musicologists -- the nagging, dissonant vocal 
harmonies and giddy whoops were only part of the picture. 
</P>
<P>
Listen to the reeds and it sounds surprisingly close to Irish music, focus on 
the strings and the reference point becomes Greece, go to the voices and it 
could be a mixture of Arabic melodies and Gregorian chant. 
</P>
<P>
Balkana's blend of virtuoso turns -- by Kostadin Varimezov on gaida (bagpipes), 
and the fleet-fingered Mihail Marinov on gadulka (a bowed string instrument) -- 
meshed with vocalist Yanka Rupinka's radiant smile and the fancy footwork of 
crowd favorite Jimmy Vassiliev on teppan (a marching bass drum) to earn a 
standing ovation from the capacity audience. DON SNOWDEN

KABUL, Afghanistan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Father Angelo Panigotti celebrates Mass these days at his tiny church in 
the deserted Italian Embassy compound, the 20 or so worshipers have to help 
themselves to the wafers. 
</P>
<P>
There are no altar boys. Nor is there an organist or a choir. So Father 
Panigotti, for 24 years the only Roman Catholic priest in Kabul, is too busy at 
his battery-powered miniature organ to distribute the Host. 
</P>
<P>
The faithful scarcely mind. They are constantly reminded, by the roar of jet 
fighters overhead, that there is a war going on. They are among a handful of 
foreigners still in Kabul after the Western embassies were closed and the 
personnel evacuated earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Among the expatriates who stayed on is a collection of characters as colorful 
as the diminutive, red-cheeked Italian priest, a kind of rogues' gallery of 
tough diplomats, missionaries and entrepreneurs, including a grandson of the 
late Lord Minto, who from 1905 to 1910 was viceroy of India. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, Kabul is one of the most internationally isolated cities in the 
world, all but abandoned by the people who once made Afghanistan a kind of 
Switzerland of Asia. 
</P>
<P>
In the three months since Jon Glassman, charge d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy, 
lowered the flag and sent the American personnel back to Washington, the 
merchants who catered to the expatriates have been going out of business. 
</P>
<P>
"No one else can afford these things," a merchant on Chicken Street told a 
reporter, gesturing toward shelves still filled with canned American ham, 
Russian crab meat and Mongolian vodka. "No one is making money on Chicken 
Street anymore. We feel lonely without the foreigners around. And, yes, some of 
us are angry." 
</P>
<P>
Afghan President Najibullah is also angry about the way the Western diplomats 
pulled out of his embattled capital. At a recent press conference, he assailed 
their departure as "psychological warfare" meant to sow panic and help the 
Muslim rebels who are besieging the city in an effort to overthrow his 
Soviet-backed regime. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the diplomats still here, representing for the most part East Bloc 
governments but also including nonaligned Yugoslavia and Turkey, which is a 
member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, are privately critical of the 
other nations' decision to pull out. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the rebel rockets falling in the capital now, one of the diplomats 
said: "There were 10 times as many hitting Kabul six months ago, but no one 
talked of evacuation then. Almost everyone here agrees that the embassy pullout 
was calculated to help topple the government quickly after the Soviet troop 
withdrawal in February, and now that we see it didn't work, most of us would 
like our wives and families back." 
</P>
<P>
For the diplomats who stayed, it is this separation from their families that 
has made life so hard. They are restricted to a security area less than 20 
miles in diameter, and alcoholism and "cabin fever" are said to be growing 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 250 or so Soviets still in Kabul, either diplomats or advisers to the 
government, life is described as even less pleasant. Most of them are 
restricted, for security reasons, to the Soviet Embassy compound. 
</P>
<P>
For the other diplomats and the expatriates, there is only one meeting place 
left, the bar and restaurant at the United Nations staff residence. There, 
diplomats from as ideologically different nations as Pakistan and Bulgaria can 
be heard debating the latest rumors and reports from the fighting fronts. 
</P>
<P>
Among the regulars, at the U.N. house and at Father Panigotti's church, is Guy 
Willoughby, a British entrepreneur and retired military officer whose private 
Halo Trust is among the international aid agencies assisting the Najibullah 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Willoughby, whose grandfather was the viceroy of India, is the subject of 
endless rumor and speculation, but his principal role here is organizing a 
program of training Afghan peasants to locate and defuse millions of land mines 
scattered across the country. 
</P>
<P>
But Willoughby is a relative newcomer. Father Panigotti and his Christian 
cemetery provide a better guide to Kabul's past as an international gathering 
place. There are 80 graves -- of Germans who helped build dams and power 
stations, of Canadian and European hippies whose search for paradise ended 
here, of British soldiers who died in the centuries-long effort to subdue the 
Afghans' fierce spirit of independence and of tourists who died for lack of 
adequate medical care. 
</P>
<P>
Panigotti pointed to the unmarked grave of a Brazilian hippie, Evaristo da 
Souza, as an illustration of Kabul's heyday as a capital of illicit drugs, 
principally hashish. 
</P>
<P>
"The boy had stolen the passports of five British hippies, and he confessed the 
crime to me in the hospital, where he had been taken for a drug overdose," 
Panigotti recalled. "An hour after I left his hospital room, the five British 
boys slipped in and injected him with poison. 
</P>
<P>
"I buried the boy and put a cross on his grave, but the next day the cross was 
gone. The hippies had come to the cemetery, replaced the cross with a stovepipe 
and ringed the grave with hashish cigarettes. I have never replaced the cross." 
</P>
<P>
Panigotti was asked whether there are any Soviet nationals buried in his little 
cemetery, and he smiled impishly and shook his head. He guided his visitors to 
the grave of a Chinese diplomat who died in Kabul, and said: 
</P>
<P>
"The Russians wanted to bury their dead here, but they wanted to put red stars 
on the graves. You see, this Chinese man, Comzou Xing Zhi, is the only 
Communist I ever allowed to be buried here, and, well, you can see what 
happened. That star on his tombstone was red when he was buried. And you see 
what the rain has done. It is no more red. So I told the Russians no." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changes Take a Toll 
</P>
<P>
But for the little priest, who is 64 years old, moments of humor are few and 
far between these days. After more than two decades, the changes have taken 
their toll. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in Chile," he said, "and I got a telegram saying go to Kabul. I am a 
soldier, so I went, and I've been waiting for another telegram ever since. 
Kabul looks like it is not Kabul anymore. Before, you could go anywhere, day or 
night. A decade ago, it was the most open city of the world. On any given day, 
there were 10,000 hippies here. There were 320 restaurants where they would 
smoke hashish openly. You could do anything here." 
</P>
<P>
Even now, Panigotti said, Kabul is a city of tolerance -- "like this little 
cemetery, a Christian graveyard in a 100% Muslim land, and the Afghans still 
respect and accept it as sacred ground." 
</P>
<P>
Yet he is clearly troubled by the deep political divisions that continue to 
fuel the decade-old war. And he tries to speak out about it. In his Mass last 
Sunday, the Day of the Ascension, Father Panigotti delivered a sermon on 
power-sharing. 
</P>
<P>
As Soviet military supply planes took off and landed at the airport not far 
from his church, occasionally drowning out his words, Father Panigotti told his 
tiny congregation: 
</P>
<P>
"Look at us in this miserable life in which we live now. What we do all the 
time is try to dominate life, dominate others. Everywhere in the world today it 
seems you have a civil war or a revolution. We must all realize that the real 
power we have is the power over life, the power of peace, not war."

ISRAEL TRIES NEW STRATEGY, CUTS TROOPS IN ARAB AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
NABLUS, Israeli-Occupied West Bank 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Israel has quietly reduced the number of troops it has in the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip to save money and to get back to training for conventional warfare, 
rather than chasing stone-throwers in Palestinian towns and villages. 
</P>
<P>
The reduction suggests that Israel, while still intent on keeping long-term 
pressure on the Palestinians, has found it difficult to deal with the demands 
of the Arab revolt. Pledges made no more than six months ago that Israel would 
assert its authority in every corner of the land -- lest a single Palestinian 
flag wave freely -- have evaporated. 
</P>
<P>
"Since there is a reduction, a shrinking of our forces, the consequences are 
that we are only in the big cities and on the main roads," said Col. Yitzhak 
Segev, military commander of the central West Bank area, based in Nablus. "It 
may have been right to go into every village all the time a few months ago, but 
that is changed now." 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Israel kept about 10,000 troops in the West Bank and 10,000 in 
the Gaza Strip. The numbers have shrunk by perhaps 1,500 in each area, military 
sources say. Deployment of hundreds of troops of the paramilitary Border Police 
has made up for part of the reduction, but the total strength is far below what 
it was at the end of last year. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers do not include thousands of soldiers stationed at numerous army 
bases on the borders with Jordan and Egypt, at bases inside the territories 
meant as defense lines in case of invasion and at electronic listening posts 
aimed at gathering intelligence from Israel's Arab neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The reductions in army strength have been noticed by the Palestinians. In Kfar 
Malek, a village of 2,000 off the main road near Ramallah, the main plaza has 
been decorated with the red, white, green and black Palestinian flag and color 
portraits of Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
Buildings framing the square are covered with nationalist graffiti and 
drawings, including a crude depiction of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir 
as a pig. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say that Israel has abandoned Kfar Malek to Palestinian 
nationalists. Rather, the tactics employed to maintain control have changed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Roads Closed 
</P>
<P>
Villagers recall that last year, the army raided Kfar Malek four times, on one 
occasion sending in as many as 1,000 soldiers to chase suspected 
stone-throwers. Roads into the village were closed by mounds of sand and rock. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, there has been only one raid. On April 5, 10 undercover 
agents came -- not in uniform and jeeps but in Palestinian headdress and an 
Arab taxi. They surprised 15 militants meeting at a house, called in two army 
trucks and took them off to jail. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the army we worry about now," Samir, a street organizer in Kfar 
Malek, said. "It's the intelligence agents who sneak in to arrest us or ambush 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Israeli settlers have noted with dismay the declining army role and have taken 
security into their own hands. In Hebron and the West Bank settlement of Ariel, 
vigilante squads roam Arab neighborhoods and villages, vandalizing homes and 
cars and sometimes firing on suspected stone-throwers, all in the name of 
self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
The army's role in suppressing the uprising came under fire from within the 
army and exploded into public view in February when a group of paratroopers 
confronted Prime Minister Shamir with their qualms about chasing stone-throwers 
and beating captives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demeaning Role 
</P>
<P>
Top officers complained about the demeaning role being forced on the army. "Why 
should Israeli soldiers chase women hanging PLO flags," Maj. Gen. Ehud Barak, 
the deputy chief of staff, asked in January. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, army reservists spent about 60 days in the West Bank and Gaza. This 
year it will be 42 days, according to Nablus commander Col. Segev, and most of 
that time will be spent in training rather than on police duty in the 
territories. "We have to carry out maneuvers," Segev said. "We have to train. 
The border we have to protect is our border with Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and 
Egypt." 
</P>
<P>
Although what Israel spends on its military is a confidential matter, the issue 
of shrinking resources has occasionally surfaced in Israeli newspapers. A 
recent report in Haaretz said that officials estimated the military reduction 
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip will save "millions of shekels." 
</P>
<P>
The national economy is also a factor, Col. Segev said. Prolonged reserve duty 
had kept soldiers from their civilian jobs, costing companies hundreds of work 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
The pullout of troops has resulted in several new strategies. One of the most 
common is sending groups of soldiers or border police to raid towns or arrest 
activists, instead of sending small units on perpetual patrol. 
</P>
<P>
"When we find there are lots of stones thrown from a place or that someone has 
set up a lot of barricades and burning tires, we go in to clear things up," 
Col. Segev said. "We also go in at night when we want to surprise someone." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tactic Gone Bad 
</P>
<P>
The killing of five residents in a night raid last month in Nahhalin, a West 
Bank village, was an example of such a tactic gone bad. Border police entered, 
were met with stones and responded by "firing all over the place," as an army 
spokesman put it. They left without accomplishing their mission of arresting 
anti-Israeli activists. 
</P>
<P>
Undercover activities, such as plainclothes raids and selective ambushes, have 
also become more common. 
</P>
<P>
Segev contended that the changes in the uprising have made it possible for the 
army to reduce its presence without losing control. The Palestinians are tired 
and have turned over responsibility for keeping the revolt going to small 
groups of "popular committees." Many organizers have been caught, Segev said, 
leaving Palestinians with no one to lead their protests. 
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians have achieved what they wanted -- to put their case before 
the world at large," he said. "Now most of them want peace." 
</P>
<P>
Segev said that other means of punishing the Palestinians would be kept in 
place: continued closure of schools, increased collection of taxes, arrests and 
the demolition of the houses of Palestinians suspected of throwing stones or 
taking part in other violence. 
</P>
<P>
More than 415 Arabs have died at the hands of Israeli troops since the 
beginning of the uprising 17 months ago and thousands have been wounded. 
Eighteen Israelis have been killed. 
</P>
<P>
Weighing against the army's diminished role in the West Bank and Gaza Strip are 
side-effects that appear to favor the Palestinians. For example, the partial 
abandonment of neighborhoods and villages for long periods has left Arabs who 
collaborate with the Israelis vulnerable to intimidation and outright attack. 
Last month, 14 suspected collaborators were killed by other Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
This violence hinders Israel's ability to gather information on rebel activity 
at a time when such information is becoming more important to the army's sparse 
coverage, Segev said. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinian activists are using a perceived atmosphere of freedom to try to 
bolster their own authority in neighborhoods and villages. Unofficial Arab 
police officers have been reported roaming the streets keeping order and 
collecting taxes from merchants. 
</P>
<P>
In Kfar Malek, militants are trying to hold informal classes to replace schools 
closed by the West Bank government and to persuade people to stop buying 
Israeli products. 
</P>
<P>
The April 5 taxi raid has made the residents of Kfar Malek wary of outsiders. 
Whenever a strange vehicle begins to descend into the village from the 
surrounding ridges, boys whistle warnings and wanted activists take cover. 
</P>
<P>
Other than the flags and graffiti, the people of Kfar Malek have little means 
of aggressively expressing nationalist feelings. There is no major road nearby, 
and no Israeli, settler or otherwise, must pass through the village to get from 
one place to another. 
</P>
<P>
Young boys practice their marksmanship by throwing rocks and twirling 
slingshots in the local cemetery. An 8-year-old, encouraged by older boys to 
demonstrate his slingshot of yarn and string, blushed when his rock went awry 
and almost hit a pair of visiting reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't thrown for a long time," he said apologetically. "Since the soldiers 
stopped coming, we don't have much to aim at."

CONTRA BACKER HULL; 
</P>
<P>
AN AMERICAN 'DON' FALLS IN COSTA RICA

<P>
MULLE DE SAN CARLOS, Costa Rica 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, when John Hull was flying high, the jungle airstrip on his 
1,600-acre ranch here was the busy hub of a frontier fiefdom. His name even 
appeared beside it on large-scale maps of Costa Rica -- "John Hull's Runway." 
</P>
<P>
Hull's three single-engine planes were flying in investors to carve new 
farmland from the wilderness, rushing snake-bitten children to hospitals and 
delivering thousands of pairs of eyeglasses from Lions Club donors to the 
needy. To most local farmers, "Don John" was a benevolent patron and visionary 
pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Havens for Rebels 
</P>
<P>
To the Contras resisting leftist Sandinista rule in Nicaragua, 30 miles away, 
Hull's scattered farms were clandestine air bases for their wounded combatants 
and American-supplied weapons, rebel leaders recall. The tall, aging expatriate 
from Indiana was their patron too, their link to the CIA and the Contra-supply 
network run by Lt. Col. Oliver L. North. 
</P>
<P>
Although his adopted country had neutrality laws to protect its security, Hull 
seemed immune. He had five CIA-paid bodyguards and a system of local informers, 
some of them police officers who would stop by his ranch for coffee. Once, when 
Costa Rica's president ordered police to search Hull's ranch for weapons, 
someone tipped him off. A smiling Hull greeted the raiding party on the front 
lawn, serving ice-cold lemonade. 
</P>
<P>
"He was practically the godfather in the north of Costa Rica," recalls Carol 
Prado, a former Contra officer. "Everything passed through him. We thought he 
was untouchable." 
</P>
<P>
But suddenly last January, Hull landed in jail. The government charged him with 
waging "hostile acts" against Nicaragua from 1982 to 1985 and allowing Contra 
pilots to smuggle cocaine through his airstrip to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The 68-year-old rancher says he was stripped to his undershorts in a cold cell, 
was deprived of his diabetes pills and fell ill with heart trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Freed on $37,500 bail after two months in jails and hospitals, Hull found his 
runway closed by government order, his access to airplane fuel and bank credit 
cut off. He faces up to 21 years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the verdict, the criminal case, built on testimony by 17 witnesses, 
marks a dramatic turnabout in the colorful saga of John Hull. And it reveals 
what substantial power he wielded in this tiny nation until political shifts in 
Washington and Central America converged to bring him down. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Ricans familiar with the case say that Hull became vulnerable here after 
the Iran-Contra scandal exposed North's network in 1986. As President Oscar 
Arias Sanchez asserted Costa Rica's neutrality and launched regional peace 
talks, he told aides to keep an eye on the gringo rancher. 
</P>
<P>
Then, while the Reagan Administration drew to a close and the Contra insurgency 
fizzled, Hull got caught up, indirectly, in a new scandal, involving 
narco-dollar corruption in the Costa Rican government. Under the changing 
political climate, allegations of drug smuggling directed at Hull, first 
leveled in 1987 by two convicted drug dealers in U.S. jails, were too much for 
Costa Rican authorities to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
To a reporter visiting his ranch last month, Hull introduced himself as a 
"political prisoner." He said he felt persecuted in Costa Rica for his 
conservative views -- and abandoned by Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I really feel uncomfortable in this situation," he said. "I'm basically 
fighting a monster, this international communism, and I'm doing it alone. Here 
I am paying my own lawyers, all my own expenses." 
</P>
<P>
Hull admitted that he had arranged deliveries to the rebels through neighboring 
farms and provided them with clothing and food. He estimated that his rescue 
flights saved the lives of 50 to 60 wounded Contras. But he denied allowing 
drugs or weapons shipments on his own property. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Government OK 
</P>
<P>
"I was talking almost weekly to the heads of the Rural Guard and Civil Guard, 
and anything I did was completely known and approved by the Costa Rican 
government at the time," Hull insisted. The Arias administration, which took 
over in May, 1986, "is doing this to placate the Sandinistas," he complained. 
"I feel singled out as a sacrifice." 
</P>
<P>
Hull says he did not come to Costa Rica looking for trouble. He arrived in the 
mid-1960s in a single-engine Cessna 180, he says, armed only with a 
soil-testing kit. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing I was looking for was a place to invest that had a stable government 
and a friendly people and fertile land," he recalls. He found all three here on 
a bluff overlooking the San Carlos River, where the mountains sweep down to a 
tropical plain. 
</P>
<P>
His father was an army intelligence officer who took up farming and taught Hull 
to fly at age 16. In World War II, Hull was an Army Air Corps flight 
instructor. Two decades later he left his own farm and wife in Pakota, Ind., to 
seek his fortune here. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a kind of streak of insanity that runs through the family," he said 
with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Hull and those he persuaded to follow him tamed Costa Rica's 
wild frontier, dotting it with cattle, lumber and citrus industries. 
</P>
<P>
Today he shares an airy four-bedroom ranch house with Margarita Acosta, 36, a 
former servant who bore his teen-age son. The area has electricity, plumbing 
and telephones -- comforts lacking when he arrived -- but still teems with 
iguanas and howler monkeys in the trees and alligators in the river. 
</P>
<P>
When the Contras took up arms in 1982, Hull threw his pioneer spirit into their 
cause. "He got involved in an all-out war," says Jim Reimer, an Illinois farmer 
transplanted here. 
</P>
<P>
Hull was well connected and strategically located for the effort. Dan Quayle, 
then a U.S. senator from Hull's home state, arranged for the rancher to meet 
North when Hull visited Washington in 1983. Hull then kept in touch with 
North's courier, Robert Owen. North later testified that Hull is "a man who has 
done a tremendous amount for his country" by helping the Contras maintain a 
front along Nicaragua's southern border. 
</P>
<P>
At one time during the conflict, Hull says, he had interests in 10 farms 
covering 8,000 acres and six airstrips, all between here and the border. 
</P>
<P>
To many of his neighbors, those who shared Hull's fear of Sandinista 
encroachment on their farms, helping the Contras was a logical way to protect 
their investments, and many of them did so. 
</P>
<P>
But some former employees and associates describe Hull as a con artist. They 
say he concealed the extent of his war activity by routing weapons through some 
farms that he managed but did not own and often pleaded wartime hardship as a 
screen for cheating absentee investors. According to former Contra allies, Hull 
was more ruthless in disputes among them than he was toward the Sandinistas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anti-Communist Image 
</P>
<P>
Hull likes to cultivate the image of a crusty anti-Communist warrior. Bald and 
slightly stooped, he is still an imposing six-footer. But the sparkling blue 
eyes in his tanned, wrinkled face and the Indiana twang that overlays his 
Spanish give him a just-folks manner. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what he did in the Nicaraguan war, he will spin tales about various 
alleged plots by the Sandinistas to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
"One time they sent in a group called the Twelve Apostles on a bus," he says. 
"The leader called himself 'The Priest.' Well, three of them went into a bar 
and had too much to drink. One of my informants overheard them," he said, and 
the plot was foiled. 
</P>
<P>
The rancher laughs as he embellishes these stories with vivid detail. But he is 
guarded and somewhat vague about his relationship with the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
Hull says he got involved in the war at the request of Eden Pastora, commander 
of the Contras' southern forces. Pastora says that he went to Hull after Joe 
Fernandez, then the CIA station chief in Costa Rica, identified him as "the man 
in charge of the northern part of the country for us." 
</P>
<P>
The rancher admits that he passed information to Fernandez and rented 
safehouses for the CIA in San Jose, the Costa Rican capital, but insists that 
he never drew a salary. 
</P>
<P>
"My relationship was one that I think any patriotic American's would have 
been," he said. "You know, if the (CIA) people came here, they were welcome to 
have lunch, the same as you are, and if there was anything I could tell them, I 
was glad to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"My part of the deal (with the Contras) was helping these poor devils who got 
shot up or stepped on a mine," he added. "If other people wanted to offer their 
farms, they would talk to me because they trusted me more than they did the 
U.S. Embassy. Then I'd pass the information on to the embassy." 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican government's criminal case pictures Hull as far more involved 
than that. According to prosecutors, Hull turned his own ranch here into a 
"logistics center" for Pastora's forces and a farm that he managed, at Monico, 
into a terminal for weapons flown from El Salvador. He also allegedly recruited 
mercenaries to train Contras at a third farm, refueled rebel planes and 
personally made one airdrop to rebel troops in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Jose Sobrado, Hull's lawyer, has reduced his defense on these counts to a 
simple interpretation of Costa Rican law: "Hostile acts," the lawyer contends, 
means nothing less than shooting into Nicaragua and drawing retaliatory fire -- 
something of which his client is not accused. 
</P>
<P>
As for the drug charges, Hull says simply that his 1,600-foot runway is too 
short to accommodate the cocaine-laden planes that two smugglers, George 
Morales and Gary Betzner, claim were flown into and out of his ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Details of Hull's Contra connection began to surface after he maneuvered to 
help the CIA dump Pastora in May, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Hull says he had begun to wonder why Pastora, a Sandinista revolutionary hero 
who had defected, wasn't seizing more territory in Nicaragua. He concluded that 
Pastora was still working for the Sandinistas. 
</P>
<P>
The CIA gave Pastora an ultimatum to form a united front with Adolfo Calero, a 
more conservative Contra leader. When he refused, a bomb exploded at a Pastora 
press conference in Nicaragua, killing three journalists and five guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
Pastora, who was wounded by the blast and promptly abandoned the war, has 
charged that Hull and Owen helped plan the bombing. The Costa Rican prosecutors 
charge that Hull was involved in earlier plotting to have Pastora hanged and 
that he had one of Pastora's helicopters hijacked for a rival rebel faction. 
Hull denies these charges. 
</P>
<P>
Hull does say that he solicited and got $10,000 a month from Calero for five 
months in 1984 to feed Pastora's disintegrating forces until they could be put 
under commanders loyal to Calero. He says he spent it all, plus $10,000 of his 
own money that was never reimbursed. 
</P>
<P>
"You had thousands of abandoned, hungry men coming out of Nicaragua and selling 
their weapons," he said. "At any country store around here you could buy an 
AK-47 (rifle) for $50 and grenades for $5 or $10 apiece. The trouble was, the 
Communists were buying those arms and sending them to the guerrillas in El 
Salvador." 
</P>
<P>
Prado, then Pastora's top assistant, disputes that account. "He dismantled our 
army," Prado said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hull is the classic ugly American," the former rebel official added. "He 
started out helping us but couldn't resist trying to control us. Then he 
destroyed us." 
</P>
<P>
About that time, Hull was also falling out with of some of his business 
associates. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Crone, a sawmill owner and the only other Indianan in this small town, 
hasn't spoken to Hull in two years. He claims that Hull drew him into a local 
partnership to make ax and wheelbarrow handles, then mismanaged and abandoned 
the venture, owing him $5,000 for lumber. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defaulted on Loan 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Justice Department began investigating the venture after Hull 
defaulted on a $375,000 start-up loan from the Overseas Private Investment 
Corp. and failed to account for most of the money. 
</P>
<P>
An American and a Canadian who hired Hull to run their Costa Rican farms told a 
U.S. Senate subcommittee that he failed to buy property for which they gave him 
money and that he diverted equipment and cattle from their land to his own. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a pattern this man followed," Louella Hood, a landowner from 
Bradenton, Fla., told the panel. "He always had to have money right away. Extra 
money. And if he didn't get it, he came up with stories about bodies floating 
in the river because of the Contra war and it was just so bad down there that 
nobody would be interested in buying our farm." Hull dismisses these complaints 
as the whining of cheapskates. 
</P>
<P>
While it is unclear whether any money of Hull's unwitting investors went to the 
Contras, nobody has accused Hull himself of profiting from the war. Instead, it 
was apparently his boasting and combative style that got him in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"John said too much on open radio frequencies," recalls a former Contra pilot 
who quit because of the lax security and testified against Hull. "Any gringo 
who came down here, John would tell him everything we were doing, even if John 
didn't know him from Adam." 
</P>
<P>
Hull says he ended his Contra air operation in 1985 after Benjamin Piza, Costa 
Rica's minister of public security, told him it was "bringing too much 
attention to the Costa Rican government's involvement in the thing." 
</P>
<P>
But even as Hull became the object of investigations in the United States, 
officials in the Arias administration said that building their own case was 
difficult because people in northern Costa Rica were too supportive or fearful 
of "Don John." 
</P>
<P>
"I always suspected there was some link from Hull to the Contras to drugs, but 
he was hard to investigate because he had such a stockade of protection from 
the local police," said Fernando Cruz, formerly the country's chief prosecutor. 
"It is true that we had to rely on evidence from outside Costa Rica, but there 
was a long, very secret investigation to develop it here." 
</P>
<P>
The deception used to arrest Hull was a sign of respect for his local 
influence. Traffic police in San Jose summoned him to the capital for what was 
called "some minor problem about a vehicle registration" and put him in 
handcuffs. Maneuvering in the case has centered on whether Hull will be tried 
in San Jose or in Ciudad Quesada, the city nearest his ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"The people up here are very, very anti-communistic," Hull drawled as he drove 
his guest in a rusty Toyota station wagon to Ciudad Quesada to meet members of 
the John Hull Defense Committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Petition for Release 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, we are all guilty of helping the Contras," said Danilo Vega Rojas, 
president of the group, which collected 410 signatures on a petition to win 
Hull's release on bail. "If this is what it's about, they have to put us all in 
jail." 
</P>
<P>
Sheila Ugalde, Hull's former secretary in Ciudad Quesada, is one of the few 
Costa Ricans around Hull to turn against him. She said she received threats 
from several associates of her former boss after talking to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me that John has friends in the Mafia who are very powerful," she 
said. "They told me I'll never be able to visit the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Edwin Gonzalez Murillo, who once worked for Hull as overseer of the Monico 
farm, told investigators about arms trafficking and guerrilla training there, 
then retracted his statement. 
</P>
<P>
"Most Costa Ricans feel that if the people in Washington want him convicted, he 
will be convicted, so they don't risk getting involved," Ugalde said. "They 
can't be sure who will protect them if the United States is still protecting 
him." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy says it has taken no special action on Hull's behalf, an 
assertion seconded by Costa Rican Information Minister Guido Fernandez and Hull 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
The CIA is no help now, the rancher says. The agency owes him $1,500 for rent 
payments on the safehouses, he claims and has withdrawn his bodyguards, leaving 
security at the ranch to a single armed sentry and an attack dog that once bit 
Hull. 
</P>
<P>
The only hint of American protest came in a letter to Arias from 19 congressmen 
urging that Hull's case "be handled in a manner that will not complicate 
U.S.-Costa Rican relations." 
</P>
<P>
Arias replied: "It pains me that you insinuate that the exemplary relations 
between your country and mine could deteriorate because our legal system is 
fighting against drug trafficking, no matter how powerful the people who 
participate in it or what external backing they might have."

MAYOR SAYS HE EXPECTS COMPLETE EXONERATION; 
</P>
<P>
BRADLEY INTENTIONALLY REFUSING TO DEFEND HIS FINANCIAL DEALINGS, INSTEAD 
RELYING ON PROBES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Facing what he acknowledged as the toughest test of his career, Mayor Tom 
Bradley said Tuesday that he has intentionally embarked on the politically 
dangerous tactic of refusing to defend his controversial financial transactions 
in the expectation that he will be exonerated by the formal investigations now 
under way. 
</P>
<P>
But while Bradley portrayed the city and himself as moving steadily ahead 
despite the state of crisis, the toll of the mounting debate over his behavior 
was clear. 
</P>
<P>
Asked, for example, what he hoped to accomplish in the remainder of his 
four-year elective term, the mayor replied: "A speedy conclusion of this 
inquiry." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Supports Hahn Investigation 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the burgeoning controversy over his finances during a luncheon 
with Times reporters and editors, Bradley said he objects to private calls by 
high-ranking city officials for appointment of an independent counsel to 
investigate the case. He said he fully supports the inquiry now under way by 
City Atty. James K. Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his self-invoked silence, however, Bradley also illuminated aspects of 
his financial history and his views on the furor that has cast a shadow over 
his 16-year tenure as the city's political leader and provoked unprecedented 
questioning at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bradley acknowledged that he has stock accounts at Drexel Burnham Lambert 
and other investment firms, but said he had never discussed transactions with 
Drexel's former junk bond chief, Michael Milken, a prominent Bradley supporter 
who is under indictment for insider trading and securities violations. Bradley 
also said he did not consider it a conflict of interest to take mayoral actions 
benefitting the firm that held his personal accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The mayor held firmly to his position that he did not involve himself in 
conflicts of interest with regard to his holdings. He said he did not consider 
it a mistake to have taken money to act as an adviser to local financial 
institutions while serving as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
But if he could relive events, Bradley said, he would have shown "even greater 
caution than I felt I had exhibited." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The mayor added that throughout his administration he has relied on 
himself, and not on the city attorney, to determine whether specific 
circumstances pose conflict-of-interest problems. Likewise, he said, he alone 
made the decision to refuse to discuss specifics about the pending 
investigations. But he said that move came not because his attorneys asked him 
to remain silent but because he does not believe that his side will receive an 
accurate airing. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley insisted that he has "the perfect answer" to the myriad and persistent 
questions raised about his personal finances, but he refused to give it. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth as I see it will come out," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
In more than one hour of give-and-take, Bradley also sought to downplay the 
potential political impact of lengthy investigations on what has been perceived 
as a career marked by personal integrity. Bradley's refusal to answer questions 
about his finances has raised eyebrows even among long-time defenders, and the 
mayor acknowledged the potential danger of his strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"I made the judgment I made, right or wrong," he said. "Whether it is harmful 
or helpful, time will tell." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor said he does not expect ambitious City Council members to "look for 
ways of trying to attack me personally," but he asserted that he will 
aggressively press his agenda in disputes with the council over the city's 
upcoming budget. A battle over the budget, centered on conflicting approaches 
backed by Bradley and the council's Finance Committee chairman, Zev 
Yaroslavsky, looms next week. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not back away," the mayor vowed. 
</P>
<P>
Only weeks after he won an unprecedented fifth term as mayor, Bradley faces 
three separate investigations. City Atty. Hahn's inquiry, which is expected to 
continue for months, centers on Bradley's financial relationships with two 
local institutions. Far East National Bank last year awarded Bradley $18,000 to 
serve as the only paid member of its advisory board. The second firm, Valley 
Federal Savings &amp; Loan, paid Bradley up to $24,000 a year since 1978 to 
serve as a director. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley initially denied knowing that the firms were active with the city, but 
documents released in recent weeks have indicated that Bradley knew that Far 
East held city accounts. Bradley also approved city measures affecting Valley 
Federal subsidiaries before he left the board earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor also faces inquiries by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which 
is looking into his investments with Drexel Burnham Lambert, and the Fair 
Political Practices Commission, which has launched two investigations of the 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Taking His Time 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said he has not yet been questioned by Hahn's aides, but said members 
of his staff have been interviewed in recent days. The investigation, he said, 
is taking "practically none" of his time. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's own attorneys, Bradley indicated, have yet to receive a full 
package of materials relating to his financial transactions. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that they have all that," he said. " . . . When they're ready, 
they will get anything of that nature that they want." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley turned aside private suggestions by council members that the 
investigation be taken over by an independent lawyer. Council members are known 
to question the breadth of Hahn's investigation and have expressed concerns 
that it will not be forceful enough. 
</P>
<P>
"The city attorney is independently elected, he's answerable to the people, not 
to the mayor or to the City Council," Bradley said. " . . . He is the 
appropriate person to conduct such an inquiry." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor swatted down Councilman Michael Woo's current consideration of 
recommending appointment of a special counsel. "I don't know that Mr. Woo 
carefully thought it through," Bradley declared brusquely. "I don't know that 
anybody has given him legal advice on it." 
</P>
<P>
"I for one want to get the thing over," he added. "And I certainly would not 
want to have at this point of the game, after the city attorney has conducted 
as much of the inquiry as he can, somebody else . . . brought in to carry on 
and duplicate all that he has done." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor also said that he has launched his own informal inquiry into the 
activities of his business associates, but he said he had turned up no 
information pertinent to his case. 
</P>
<P>
While he refused to delve into specifics about his ties to Far East and Valley 
Federal, Bradley on Tuesday did defend the general notion of working for 
outside concerns while serving as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see it as a big prohibition," he said. "It's a question of what you do 
in that position." 
</P>
<P>
Documents related to the case have indicated that Bradley both approved 
measures relating to his business contacts, and, in his dealings with city 
officials, spoke about them. But he defended the overall practice of speaking 
for his allies. 
</P>
<P>
"I was there as a service agent," he said, referring to his mayoral role. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor, citing his self-imposed ban on specifics, refused even to concur 
with City Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg's statement that Bradley, in discussing 
Far East with Rittenberg, had not applied untoward pressure to deposit city 
accounts in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
"I have the perfect answer. Let me just leave it at that," Bradley said. 
Pressed on whether Rittenberg's comment was "the perfect answer," the mayor 
replied: "It's one of the perfect answers." 
</P>
<P>
Offering more detail than he has in the past about his financial holdings, 
Bradley said that he has had "several accounts" at Drexel Burnham and other 
brokerages, but insisted that controversial junk bond chief Milken did not, to 
Bradley's knowledge, involve himself in the mayor's portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't ever recall talking to Michael Milken about stock," the mayor said. "I 
don't recall ever talking to him about any stock." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor said he was also "not aware" that he had ever been allowed to 
purchase stock that was not available to the general public. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley also indicated that he had no records specifying the dates of his stock 
purchases and sales, although records such as that are required by the Internal 
Revenue Service. The mayor had previously promised to make the dates available 
to Times reporters if he could determine them. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he had considered it a conflict of interest to weigh in on 
matters involving Drexel while having accounts with the firm, the mayor replied 
simply: "No." Drexel officials have said that the mayor intervened at their 
behest when SEC officials were considering shifting the firm's junk bond 
accounts out of the Beverly Hills office. Bradley called Rep. Tony Coelho 
(D-Merced) and asked him to lobby for the firm's continued presence in Beverly 
Hills, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shows Some Impatience 
</P>
<P>
Despite his decision not to speak openly about his side of the case, Bradley 
indicated a certain impatience with the recent turn of events and what is 
expected to be months of investigations into his administration. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is any No. 1 thing that I'm most proud of, it is that record of 
honest integrity, prudent management of the city," he said. "And that's the 
reason that I have been pained and concerned about the . . . press coverage 
that has taken place in the last several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as that inquiry is finished, I'll be prepared to talk to the whole 
world, and nobody could want it to be finished faster and more fully than I, 
because I'm the one who's had to suffer the battering."

FUSION GENIE'S STILL IN BOTTLE, SCIENTISTS' CRITICS SAY; 
</P>
<P>
WHAT STARTED AS A TRIUMPHANT SAGA FIZZLES INTO CONFUSION AND CARPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On March 23, two elated chemists -- B. Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann -- 
stood before reporters at a University of Utah news conference, proudly 
explaining how their discovery of nuclear fusion in a flask would lead to a 
worldwide abundance of cheap, clean energy. Afterward, they autographed press 
releases for colleagues and showed off their suddenly famous laboratory to 
visiting members of the news media. 
</P>
<P>
That was less than seven weeks ago. On Monday night in Los Angeles, a starkly 
contrasting scene unfolded as the two mumbled through presentations before a 
throng of fellow chemists at the Bonaventure Hotel, ducked sharp questions and 
then slipped quickly away after failing to defend their supposed breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
The Pons-Fleischmann saga is beginning to raise troubling questions about the 
lure of patents and prizes in scientific discovery, about institutional and 
governmental pressures to attract recognition and money, and about the adverse 
effects of competition on scientific credibility. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, there is no more talk of a Nobel Prize. The two chemists are besieged 
by critics -- castigated for their inability to explain their experiment, their 
failure to reveal full details of the research and their decision to circumvent 
the normal rules of science by announcing their results at a press conference 
before reporting them at a meeting or publishing them in a scientific journal. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we've all been guilty of eagerness," James J. Brophy, the University 
of Utah's vice president for research and development, conceded Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, people around the world -- tantalized by the idea of an energy 
miracle -- are now left wondering: Is fusion in a flask real or simply the 
delusion of two scientists carried away by their own misguided enthusiasm? 
</P>
<P>
If the Utah researchers have not found cold fusion, what have they found? One 
possibility is a previously undiscerned chemical reaction. If that is the case, 
they may have found a new way to make batteries, but no solution to energy 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
The other most likely possibility is that they simply made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
The final answer may not come for weeks or months, until Pons and Fleischmann 
have had more time to refine their experiments and to share their data with 
other researchers. 
</P>
<P>
One hope for resolving the quandary is a joint project with the Los Alamos 
National Laboratory. Two weeks ago, Pons said that a fusion flask would be set 
up in Salt Lake City in cooperation with Los Alamos researchers, then moved to 
Los Alamos where researchers can use sophisticated equipment to look for signs 
of a nuclear reaction. 
</P>
<P>
Pons said Monday, however, that the project could not be started until 
necessary paper work has been completed. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the governor of Utah has created a nine-member panel that will 
oversee a $5-million fund for fusion research created by the state Legislature. 
Those funds cannot be disbursed until Pons' and Fleischmann's claims have been 
corroborated. The University of Utah's Brophy said Tuesday that the panel will 
be given access to all of the researchers' data -- the first time that anyone 
outside the university will have seen it. 
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that the panel will complete its evaluation before within two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Pons and Fleischmann were an unlikely pair from the beginning. The rumpled 
Fleischmann, 62, has a long and distinguished history that brought him the 
chairmanship of the chemistry department of the University of Southampton in 
England and numerous awards before he retired from teaching in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pons Rose Quickly 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the peripatetic Pons, 45, had dropped out of graduate school at 
the University of Michigan in 1967, first to join his family's textile 
business, then to operate a restaurant in Florida. He met Fleischmann in 1975 
when he returned to graduate school, choosing the University of Southampton 
because it would allow him to transfer most of the credits he had already 
earned. Pons rose quickly, becoming chairman of the University of Utah's highly 
respected chemistry department. 
</P>
<P>
Spurred by shared interests in skiing and cooking, Pons and Fleischmann became 
close friends, spending long periods in each other's homes and collaborating on 
a variety of projects. Their continued scientific conversations ultimately led 
to their new approach to fusion, which Fleischmann has always said was a 
"one-in-a-billion shot." 
</P>
<P>
Their apparatus is simple, small palladium and platinum electrodes immersed in 
heavy water -- water in which each of the hydrogen atoms has an extra neutron. 
Applying a small voltage to the electrodes, they said, creates an electrical 
field that forces high concentrations of deuterium ions into the palladium 
electrode. At those high concentrations, the deuterium ions fuse to form 
helium, releasing large quantities of energy. 
</P>
<P>
They convinced themselves that their apparatus was producing more energy than 
they were putting into it and that they were observing radioactive debris in 
the reaction vessel that could only have arisen from a nuclear fusion reaction. 
</P>
<P>
The pair spent 5 1/2 years and $100,000 of their own money researching the 
phenomenon. Earlier this year, they discovered that physicist Steven Jones of 
Brigham Young University in Provo and his colleagues were working on the same 
technique. Jones was also seeing radioactive debris, but he did not observe 
significant heat production and did not believe that the process could be used 
for large-scale energy production. 
</P>
<P>
The two groups met early in March and ultimately agreed to publish their 
findings simultaneously. Pons and Fleischmann said it would take them another 
18 months before they were ready to publish, but Jones objected that an 
abstract of his work was already being circulated among scientists and that he 
planned to present the results soon. 
</P>
<P>
It was agreed that the two groups would each submit a paper to the British 
journal Nature on March 24. But without warning, Jones, Pons and Fleischmann 
announced their findings on March 23, simultaneously filing patent 
applications. Jones' paper was published two weeks ago; Pons and Fleischmann 
withdrew theirs when the journal asked for more experimental details. 
</P>
<P>
They did write a brief explanation of their results, which appeared in a Dutch 
journal, and they gave cursory descriptions at a meeting of the American 
Chemical Society and other meetings. But most of their experimental details 
remained obscure. 
</P>
<P>
Many researchers, already angered by the lack of detail, were further incensed 
two weeks ago when the pair, accompanied by university officials, went before a 
U.S. Senate committee to ask for $25 million for a fusion research center in 
Salt Lake City. That money would join the $5 million already appropriated by 
the Utah Legislature and an additional $70 million the University of Utah hopes 
to raise from industry. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the potential application of the Utah results to energy production, 
thousands of scientists around the world put aside research projects and began 
trying to replicate the fusion results -- usually basing their experiments on 
newspaper descriptions of the fusion cell. 
</P>
<P>
Within three weeks, reports of partial confirmation began to appear in the 
United States and around the world, usually from small research groups lacking 
access to sophisticated analytical tools. Several of the groups withdrew their 
claims, citing experimental errors. 
</P>
<P>
Such initial confirmation is common, said physicist Douglas Morrison of the 
European Center for Nuclear Research. Many researchers want to "get on the 
bandwagon," he said, and thus make premature claims of success. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Find No Evidence 
</P>
<P>
Last week, at a meeting of physicists in Baltimore, spokesmen for the 11 U.S. 
Department of Energy research laboratories, as well as comparable facilities in 
Canada and England, reported that they could find no evidence for fusion or for 
excess heat production. 
</P>
<P>
Many others found experimental errors in Pons' and Fleischmann's data, 
concluding that the Utah researchers' calculations of the energy produced in 
the cell were probably based on faulty assumptions. In short, said Caltech 
chemist Nathan Lewis, "We find no evidence for anything other than conventional 
chemistry." 
</P>
<P>
Monday night, for the first time, the Utah researchers conceded that they too 
had been troubled by some of the measurements. But, even then, they continued 
to stick by their claim to have produced excess heat.

STATE DELEGATION PRESSES FOR BAN ON OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After years of waging the legislative equivalent of guerrilla warfare against 
offshore oil drilling, members of California's congressional delegation Tuesday 
opened discussions with the Administration in an effort to win a permanent 
exemption for the state from future drilling plans. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting marks a temporary truce between the two forces, reflecting the 
drilling opponents' hopes that President Bush might agree to a negotiated 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
But the collegial mood of the session was marked by lingering hostility as the 
anti-drilling forces sternly warned that they will resume their fight unless 
the President acquiesces to their demands. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I can express my recommendation in two words," Rep. Barbara Boxer 
(D-Greenbrae) told the White House task force. "Forget it." 
</P>
<P>
The task force, headed by Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., was appointed 
early this year by President Bush to review the pro-drilling course established 
by the Ronald Reagan Administration and to consider the environmental concerns 
raised by critics of that policy. 
</P>
<P>
Because its members represent federal agencies that favored Reagan's plans, 
critics have charged that the panel is predisposed to submit a pro-drilling 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan sought in the hourlong meeting Tuesday to dispel such fears, assuring the 
congressional group that the panel had not been instructed "as to how we should 
come out." 
</P>
<P>
"We can rule 'no drilling' or we can rule 'drill every square inch,' " Lujan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the delegation joined in a chorus of praise for the Bush 
Administration's willingness to take a fresh look at the dispute, in which 
California congressmen repeatedly have resorted to behind-the-scenes 
parliamentary tactics to block offshore drilling plans. 
</P>
<P>
But some made clear their continuing skepticism about the task force's 
intentions, and urged the panel to reject the outlook of the last 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't come into this room -- and to Congress, and to the country -- 
with a commitment to change in how you approach these issues," warned Rep. Leon 
E. Panetta (D-Carmel Valley), "then you're not going to get anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
"It is the impression of many of us that what is proceeding is a rearranging of 
the deck chairs on the Titanic. That simply will not do," said Rep. Tom Lantos 
(D-San Mateo). 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Tuesday, the Mendocino County Board of Supervisors sounded a similar 
note of criticism, voting 5 to 0 to discourage the task force from conducting a 
planned public meeting in Eureka on offshore drilling. 
</P>
<P>
A resolution approved by the board dismissed the session as a "public relations 
ploy," noting that the Interior Department -- which provides staff members for 
the task force -- has made clear its support of offshore oil development. 
</P>
<P>
Interior Department spokesman Steve Goldstein said the panel will seek another 
venue for its Northern California session. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Workshops' Scheduled 
</P>
<P>
The "workshops" -- scheduled also for San Diego, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and 
Sacramento -- are designed, like the Capitol Hill session, to signal the 
drilling task force's commitment to open discussion of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Interior Department, the drilling task force is composed of 
representatives from the departments of Interior and Energy, the Environmental 
Protection Agency, the Office of Management and Budget and the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration. The National Academy of Sciences is to provide 
scientific research. 
</P>
<P>
The panel's mandate is to consider plans for drilling off Northern and Southern 
California and in another region off Florida's Gulf Coast, and excludes Lease 
Sale 119 off the Central California coast. Lujan said Tuesday, however, that he 
expects the task force findings to be "applicable to the other areas." 
</P>
<P>
While hailing the task force's open approach, Panetta and others predicted that 
the panel would be confronted by Californians' deep concerns about the 
environmental sensitivity of the state's coastline. 
</P>
<P>
"You will hear in emphatic terms about the need that Californians feel for 
protection that will be adequate," said Republican Sen. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Support Drilling 
</P>
<P>
A small minority of the delegation sounded markedly different views, voicing 
emphatic support for continued offshore drilling. 
</P>
<P>
"This nation is moving back toward a dependence on foreign oil," warned Rep. 
William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton), who challenged drilling opponents to put 
the matter to a full vote of the House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Another drilling advocate, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita), warned the 
Administration against being swayed by anti-oil sentiment provoked by the 
recent oil spill in Alaska's Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
"A coalition of irresponsible environmentalists and local property owners are 
effectively blocking this valuable energy source for America," he said.

PREACHER SCOTT RENTS THEATER IN L.A. FOR CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, Times Religion Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gene Scott, the flamboyant TV preacher who lost millions in an attempt to buy 
the old "Jesus Saves" church in Los Angeles two years ago, has signed a 10-year 
lease that will bring him back downtown -- into the classic United Artists 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, with an option to buy, was signed by Scott last week with Bruce 
Corwin, president of Metropolitan Theaters and president of Miracle on 
Broadway, a nonprofit corporation seeking to revive a stretch of downtown Los 
Angeles for business and entertainment activity. 
</P>
<P>
"A church is a splendid use for the theater," said Corwin, adding Tuesday that 
he invited Scott to consider the move. The building has been closed recently, 
except for some stage shows from Mexico, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The financial arrangements were not made public. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to Scott said Tuesday that the TV preacher did not know when he will 
occupy the ornate, 1,800-seat building, which was built in 1927 by actors 
Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford and Charlie Chaplin to be the flagship theater 
of United Artists. 
</P>
<P>
To his cheering congregation Sunday at Wescott Christian Center in Glendale, 
Scott said his previous "false start" to bring a large church presence downtown 
was consistent with the biblical history of "God's people." His associate 
claimed that Scott has a constituency of about 15,000 households in the greater 
Los Angeles area who attend his services at least occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, whose long discourses are seen on Channels 30 and 56 locally, regularly 
amazed casual viewers years ago when he excoriated various state and federal 
government agencies with whom he had disputes and exhorted audiences for hours 
to contribute to his legal defense and to his ministry. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, he appeared to solve the plight of the downtown Church of the Open 
Door, which was moving to Glendora, by buying the one-time fundamentalist 
bastion and adjoining hotel building on Hope Street near the downtown library. 
</P>
<P>
But after paying a $6.5-million deposit on the $23-million purchase, Scott 
stopped payments and tried to void the deal, citing a 1919 deed declaring that 
the church could be used only for religious purposes, in particular a 
fundamentalist Christian approach. A lawsuit citing such restrictions was 
dismissed as baseless in 1987 in Los Angeles Superior Court, however. 
</P>
<P>
In another aspect of the case, another Superior Court judge denied Wescott 
Christian Center a refund of the nearly $7-million deposit in 1988; the ruling 
has been appealed. 
</P>
<P>
The Church of the Open Door eventually sold the property to a developer, and 
the Renaissance-style building -- noted for its twin neon "Jesus Saves" rooftop 
signs -- has been demolished. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Scott hinted to his congregation that he would erect something on 
top of the theater building that could be seen "from the Harbor and Santa 
Monica freeways." 
</P>
<P>
He said the architecture, and especially the interior of the theater, makes the 
old Hope Street church "look like the barn that it was." 
</P>
<P>
"Every major church downtown has fled this great city," Scott said, "and I 
rallied the people who listened to me and I have never dimmed in my conviction 
that a way must be provided to keep God's presence in the heart of the city." 
</P>
<P>
Church leaders say Scott is partially right. Over the last 15 years, St. Paul's 
Episcopal Cathedral, Temple Baptist Church, First United Methodist Church and 
the Church of the Open Door sold out because of financial pressures to maintain 
their buildings for dwindling congregations. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Methodist congregation stayed downtown, moving several blocks 
south, and the Roman Catholic presence downtown has remained, primarily with 
St. Vibiana Cathedral, Our Lady Queen of Angels in the Plaza and St. Joseph's 
Parish in the Garment District.

SAN DIEGO OFFICIALS SETTING TRAPS FOR EXPECTED ARRIVAL OF 'KILLER BEES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Africanized "killer" bees are expected to reach California within a few years 
and San Diego County agriculture officials are preparing for their arrival. 
</P>
<P>
The county agricultural commissioner's office has set a bee trap near each of 
the county's three border crossings -- San Ysidro, Otay Mesa and Tecate. And 
state agriculture officials have set three traps of their own in the county, 
including one at the Port of San Diego, where they fear the bees are most 
likely to enter. 
</P>
<P>
Although their venom is no more potent than that of the native European variety 
found in the United States, the Africanized insects sting in larger swarms and 
generally pursue an intruder for a longer time over a greater distance. 
</P>
<P>
More than 300 people reportedly have died in the course of the Africanized 
bees' northward movement since they were released from a laboratory in Brazil 
in 1956. The unpredictable bees are a cross between European bees and an 
African strain. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to posing a public health problem, the Africanized bees would 
threaten crops in California that rely on pollination, an industry worth $2 
billion a year, and to the state's $18-million-a-year honey production 
business, said David Kellum, an entomologist with the San Diego County 
agricultural commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
"We are on the front line as one of the first counties in California that will 
be hit by the Africanized bee," Kellum said. "If we have a stinging incident 
here, it will become national news. The county will have to coordinate its 
efforts with the tourist industry to assure the people the situation is under 
control." 
</P>
<P>
Baited with a pheromone that attracts bees, the county's traps are made of 
corrugated paper and designed to look like a hollow tree. Biologists check the 
traps once a week, when the bees are killed with a spray and taken to a 
laboratory where scientists determine if any of them are Africanized bees. 
</P>
<P>
State officials have set about 36 traps throughout California, primarily in 
coastal areas where the bees might come ashore on ships. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists expect the Africanized bees to arrive in Texas early next year and 
in San Diego two to five years later. They are now found as far north as the 
Mexican state of Veracruz, about 300 miles south of Brownsville, Tex. Officials 
believe the bees are more likely to enter along coastal areas such as San Diego 
rather than in areas such as the Imperial Valley, because the Africanized bees 
have an aversion to deserts. 
</P>
<P>
State agricultural officials won the first round with Africanized bees. In 
June, 1985, a colony was discovered in an oil field about 45 miles northwest of 
Bakersfield. Bee experts theorized the the colony had arrived hidden in a load 
of oil-drilling pipe shipped from South America. 
</P>
<P>
After inspecting 22,000 apiaries in Kern County, state officials destroyed 12 
colonies containing Africanized bees and lifted a quarantine on 1,088 square 
miles of the southern San Joaquin Valley. 
</P>
<P>
As the largest bee-keeping state in the nation, California will be particularly 
hard hit by the Africanized bees, said Pat Paswater, apiary projects leader 
with the state Department of Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Professional pollinators who transport bees to farms and fields face the 
problem of attempting to control the Africanized bees. Fields might have to be 
abandoned by human workers while the bees pollinate crops. For those in the 
honey business, the Africanized bee presents another problem besides its ill 
temper: It devours much of its own honey, making it a less-efficient honey 
producer than the European bee. 
</P>
<P>
When the Africanized bees come in contact with the European strain, the African 
traits are dominant: a European strain of bee becomes Africanized when it 
crossbreeds with bees carrying genes from the African bees. Rather than coexist 
with other bees, Africanized bees take over hives, push aside rivals and 
dominate mating.

RIGHTS COALITION OPPOSES LUCAS FOR JUSTICE DEPT. POST

A coalition of civil rights organizations voiced its opposition Tuesday to the 
appointment of William Lucas to head the Justice Department's civil rights 
division. 
</P>
<P>
The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights said Lucas does not have the 
experience or litigation skills needed in the position, which is the federal 
government's top civil rights job. 
</P>
<P>
The conference is an umbrella group of 180 organizations and the opposition was 
adopted "by consensus" at a meeting of the conference, said Ralph Neas, 
executive director of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition was the latest round in the controversy swirling around Lucas, a 
black Detroit lawyer. Lucas, 61, also has been an FBI agent, sheriff of Wayne 
County, Mich., and the chief executive of that county. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas is being backed for the post by Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, the Rev. 
Jesse Jackson, some members of the Congressional Black Caucus and the Rev. 
Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. 
</P>
<P>
But the nomination of Lucas, a Democrat-turned-Republican, has been opposed by 
the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, the nation's oldest 
and largest civil rights group. 
</P>
<P>
The leadership conference position said the organization would "work to 
persuade the U.S. Senate to withhold confirmation of the nomination" once it is 
proposed by President Bush.

WRIGHT ASSAILS SPECIAL COUNSEL'S INTEGRITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) and a newly expanded team of attorneys 
launched his defense against misconduct charges Tuesday with a hard-hitting 
attack on the integrity and legal ability of Richard J. Phelan, special counsel 
to the House Ethics Committee. 
</P>
<P>
While sparing the panel members, Wright used exceptionally strong language in 
accusing Phelan of distorting testimony of witnesses and telling "a lie, a 
falsehood" about the issue of whether his wife, Betty, worked for a total of 
$72,000 in salary or received it as a gift. 
</P>
<P>
The Speaker said his newly hired lawyers were "profoundly shocked by the lack 
of professionalism and prevalence of distortion and inaccuracy contained in the 
Phelan report" on the committee's 10-month investigation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calls Panel Too Busy 
</P>
<P>
Wright said the 12 panel members were busy and placed too much reliance on the 
Chicago attorney's analysis of the evidence during the initial phase of their 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
He charged that Phelan ignored testimony that Betty Wright worked from five to 
seven days a month for the $18,000 a year she was paid for four years by 
Mallightco, an investment firm that the Wrights formed with Ft. Worth 
businessman George A. Mallick Jr. and his wife. Instead, Phelan concluded that 
she may have worked only a dozen days in four years. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a lie, a falsehood, a distortion and a misrepresentation of the 
testimony that was given," Wright told reporters at a news briefing. 
</P>
<P>
But committee Chairman Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles) brushed aside the 
criticism as a defense tactic and said his 11 colleagues worked diligently to 
digest the information on the Speaker's financial affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Another knowledgeable House member said the committee members are seething 
privately over Wright's charges that Phelan has misled the panel and, as a 
result, are considering recommending a formal reprimand of the Speaker -- a 
move that would put his survival in office in grave jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
And one committee member, Rep. Larry E. Craig (R-Ida.), said: "To charge that 
Mr. Phelan has distorted this is to assume the committee hasn't done its 
homework. I think the committee has done its homework very well." 
</P>
<P>
Dixon, however, said he was not offended by Wright's allegations, although he 
agreed with a questioner who labeled it a part of the Speaker's new strategy 
for fighting the ethics charges. 
</P>
<P>
The chairman also said the committee may vote today on whether to pursue its 
investigation of a Texas oil-and-gas investment that gave Wright a quick profit 
of $340,000 last year while other investors have yet to receive any income from 
the well. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, the committee requested court records from a federal 
criminal trial in Dallas. A witness at the trial testified that a savings and 
loan executive had told him Wright would stop legislation opposed by the thrift 
industry if S&amp;L executives contributed $250,000 to a Democratic 
congressional candidate in 1985. The Speaker has denied that he ever proposed 
such a deal. 
</P>
<P>
Committee sources said the panel had requested a copy of a $1,000 check 
introduced into evidence at the trial. Wright's name appears in a corner of the 
check, which was a contribution from the wife of a savings and loan executive 
to Rep. Jim Chapman (D-Tex.) during his successful race for a House seat. 
</P>
<P>
The committee -- supporting Phelan's recommendations -- voted 12 to 0 last 
month to charge that Wright violated House rules on 69 occasions by improperly 
accepting $145,000 in gifts from Mallick and by evading a House limit on 
speaking fees through bulk sales of his book to groups he addressed. 
</P>
<P>
Wright's enlarged legal team filed a series of motions with the committee 
Tuesday, seeking disclosure of evidence to be used at a disciplinary hearing 
early next month and any information that would tend to clear the Speaker of 
the alleged violations. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Speaker's lawyers asked that Phelan be barred from talking 
with members of the committee during the trial phase of the case unless one of 
Wright's attorneys is present. They also asked the panel to tell witnesses that 
they will be free to talk to the Speaker's defense team and asked for any 
documents relied upon by the committee in drafting the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen D. Susman, a Houston lawyer who just joined Wright's legal forces, 
voiced confidence that the Speaker can be cleared, saying, "I think this case 
is absolutely winnable beyond the shadow of a doubt before a fair jury." 
</P>
<P>
Another new advocate, Rep. Robert G. Torricelli (D-N.J.), concurred, adding: 
"Phelan is seeking to open up new areas of investigation because he can't, as a 
matter of law, succeed on these issues . . . his case is collapsing." 
</P>
<P>
The Speaker's original attorney, William C. Oldaker, said that attempts to 
negotiate an expedited procedure with Phelan had failed and that Wright now 
will mount an all-out defense, even if it delays a final decision. Within a day 
or so, he said, motions to dismiss the major charges will be filed along with a 
request to argue them before the committee.

<P>
BUSH, IN INNER CITY, TOUTS DAY-CARE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush traveled to an inner-city child care center Tuesday for a visit 
designed to tout the benefits of his Administration's day-care plan but, 
instead, may have illustrated his proposal's limits -- most of the children 
served by the center would not be eligible for day-care aid under the Bush 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
"My thought is to help the parents with choice. If they want to send a kid to 
this facility, fine, give them a little help," Bush told officials of the 
day-care center, a 30-year-old program sponsored by one of Washington's largest 
black churches, Shiloh Baptist. 
</P>
<P>
But the program Bush is backing, a tax-credit plan sent to Congress in March, 
would do little for most of the 77 children enrolled in the center's daytime 
and after-school day-care programs, according to information provided by the 
center. Most of the children are too old to be eligible or their families, 
while not wealthy, earn too much money. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Total Incomes 
</P>
<P>
Bush's plan would aid only parents with total incomes of less than $13,000, 
slightly above the current poverty level -- $12,088. The plan also would apply 
only to those younger than 4. Most of the children at the Shiloh center, like 
most of those at day-care centers nationwide, are 4 or older. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these people are career-oriented," the center's program director, 
Florence Omachonu, said of the parents who send their children to Shiloh. Many, 
she said, are single mothers with jobs, "for example, public schoolteachers," 
who in Washington earn a minimum of $22,982. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is a familiar one for Administration policy planners. To keep new 
programs from worsening the federal deficit, Bush aides have been under orders 
to keep their initiatives limited. And to limit the cost, aides have had to 
severely limit their programs' reach. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's plan would cost $187 million in its first year, the Administration says, 
with the cost increasing later as the income limits were allowed to rise. By 
contrast, a broader congressional proposal sponsored by leading Democrats and 
some Republicans would cost some $2.5 billion. Under that plan, likely to be 
voted on in the Senate later this month, the federal government would provide 
aid to states that, in turn, would be passed along to low-income parents and 
licensed child care centers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quality, Safety 
</P>
<P>
Sponsors of the congressional plan argue that it would increase the supply of 
day care and also, by imposing regulations, improve the quality and safety of 
care. Administration officials say it would cost too much and would lead to 
excessive government regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's plan would give a tax credit of up to $1,000 per child for any family 
with income below the cutoff point. Families could use the money for child care 
or any other purpose. 
</P>

MODERATE IN LINE TO LEAD SAN DIEGO'S ROMAN CATHOLICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bishop Robert H. Brom of Minnesota, a theological moderate who says he believes 
that the Catholic Church's "objective truths" must be weighed against 
individuals' "subjective circumstances," on Tuesday was named coadjutor bishop 
of the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego and the future successor to Bishop 
Leo T. Maher. 
</P>
<P>
In a decision announced in Washington by Archbishop Pio Laghi, the apostolic 
delegateto the United States, Pope John Paul II appointed Brom to be coadjutor 
-- an heir apparent who will share diocesan duties with Maher until he reaches 
the church's mandatory retirement age of 75 in July, 1990. At that time, the 
50-year-old Brom will become the diocese's leader. 
</P>
<P>
Brom, who has headed the Duluth, Minn., diocese -- which is about one-sixth the 
size of the 462,000-member San Diego diocese -- for six years, will be 
installed as coadjutor in a July 24 ceremony to be attended by Laghi, Los 
Angeles Archbishop Roger M. Mahony and Maher. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Strong But Compassionate' 
</P>
<P>
During his first three months here, Brom, who speaks some Spanish, plans to 
become fluent in the language -- a skill viewed as a virtual necessity for the 
next bishop, given San Diego's proximity to the border and the large number of 
Latinos in the church. The remainder of his "apprenticeship," Brom added, will 
be devoted to becoming familiar with the local diocese and its needs. 
</P>
<P>
According to associates in Minnesota, Brom is, as one priest put it, "a strong 
but compassionate leader" who is able to balance his own strict adherence to 
church tenets with a recognition that many believers differ with Catholic 
orthodoxy on controversial issues such as birth control, divorce and the role 
of women in the church. While Brom does not veer from the Vatican line on those 
core issues, several priests said, neither does he harshly criticize those 
Catholics who question some church positions. 
</P>
<P>
Brom displayed that quality at a Tuesday news conference, answering questions 
about how he believes priests should deal with Catholics who dissent from 
church teachings on certain crucial issues. 
</P>
<P>
"In each case, we must distinguish between acceptable pluralism and diversity 
and what is unacceptable in terms of Catholic identity and membership in the 
church," Brom said. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining that he strives "never to deny the truth, but never to impose the 
truth," Brom said that he could not "give a cold, hard answer" about whether he 
would condemn or understand individuals' differences with church teachings 
before talking with them to discern their thinking. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Visit to Rome 
</P>
<P>
Asked to categorize himself philosophically, Brom described himself as a 
moderate who is "troubled with both extremes." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Arcadia, Wis., Brom was ordained in Winona, Minn., 25 years ago -- an 
event that he plans to commemorate with a two-week visit to Rome this summer. 
In addition to pastoral assignments, Brom's other positions with the Winona 
diocese included service as a professor and rector at Immaculate Heart of Mary 
Seminary, and president of the diocese's Senate of Priests. 
</P>
<P>
Maher, who had requested that the Vatican appoint a coadjutor to ease the 
transition to a new bishop after his own 20-year tenure, said Brom's name was 
among those he had submitted to apostolic delegate Laghi, also called the 
pronuncio, for consideration as possible successors. 
</P>
<P>
However, as is typical in the bishop appointment process -- an operation at 
once carefully structured but also steeped in mystique and secretiveness -- 
Brom said he was unaware that he was even under consideration until Laghi 
called him two weeks ago to inform him of his selection. 
</P>
<P>
One of Brom's first major decisions relating to his position here was to forgo 
living in a stylish half-million-dollar Kensington house -- bought by the 
diocese in anticipation of a new bishop's appointment -- in favor of taking up 
residence in an apartment at the diocesan seminary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Simplified Life Style' 
</P>
<P>
That choice, Brom explained, stemmed primarily from his longtime involvement 
with "the academic aspect of the church," adding that he prefers "a more 
simplified life style" -- an apparent allusion to image questions raised inside 
and outside local religious circles about the six-bedroom, pool-equipped 
Kensington home. As a result, Maher, who will continue residing in his Mission 
Hills home, said that the house will be sold by the diocese.

PANEL OKS RISE IN REDEMPTIONS FOR CONTAINERS

A bill more than doubling the redemption rate on recyclable beverage containers 
was approved unanimously Tuesday by the Senate Natural Resources and Wildlife 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which was sent to the Appropriations Committee, would raise the 
redemption rate from the current 1 cent per container to 5 cents for two 
containers. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, authored by Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), is an attempt to 
improve consumer response to the state's 18-month-old recycling program. With a 
minimal 65% recycling goal, the Department of Conservation reported in March 
that recycling of beverage containers between July and December of 1988 reached 
only 57% for aluminum, 33% for glass and 5% for plastic. 
</P>
<P>
Hart argued that a stronger financial incentive is necessary for California 
recycling to be a success. His bill would take effect Jan. 1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Goals of Program 
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, two beverage containers would be worth a nickel, and the 
larger, 24-ounce plastic containers would be worth a nickel each. With an 80% 
recycling goal, any type of container that failed to reach 65% recycling by 
Jan. 1, 1993, would be worth a full nickel each. The large plastic containers 
would be worth a dime. 
</P>
<P>
"We might see plastic surpass glass in this new configuration," said mark 
murray, policy Representatives from Anheuser-Busch, Adolph Coors Co. and the 
California Grocers Assn. testified in support of the measure, despite their 
previous opposition to recycling/bottle bills. The primary reason industry 
leaders support Hart's bill, Murray said, is to avoid a potential initiative by 
Californians Against Waste that would raise redemption rates to 5 cents per 
container. 
</P>
<P>
Hart said he is confident that his bill will win the two-thirds support of both 
houses necessary for passage. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a powerful coalition here," Hart said. "It's going take 
someone to throw something into the gears to throw this off track."

DAWN RAID ON AVALON BY INS SNARES 28 ILLEGAL ALIENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to complaints that unemployed Mexican nationals have harassed 
residents and tourists in Avalon, immigration agents swept through the Santa 
Catalina Island resort town at dawn Tuesday, arresting 28 illegal aliens, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The men agreed to deportation to Mexico, U.S. Immigration and Naturalization 
Service officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The raid by 37 INS agents was the first on Santa Catalina since 1986, when 36 
illegal alien workers were removed from the island. Complaints from residents 
and tourists prompted the raid, said John Brechtel, the INS' assistant district 
director for investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Brechtel said a second group of INS officials will return to the island soon to 
inspect businesses accused of employing illegal alien workers. Island residents 
said Mexican men have come to Catalina for years in search of work. Many find 
jobs as dishwashers and busboys in the town's restaurants; others wait in the 
town plaza and downtown on Front Street for day work as gardeners or laborers. 
</P>
<P>
Avalon city officials said they requested the INS make the sweep before the 
busy summer season begins later this month on Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the draw of the island for residents and visitors is that you can come 
here and feel safe," Avalon City Manager Chuck Prince said. "There has been an 
increase in crime that seemed to be linked to the increase in the illegals." 
</P>
<P>
Several men have been arrested for public drunkenness, while others have fought 
in public, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The most serious incident occurred Sunday when three men, believed to be from 
Mexico, beat another Mexican national, said Lt. Dale Goss, commander of the 
sheriff's station in Avalon. The suspects left the island, and the victim is 
still recovering at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Goss said. 
</P>
<P>
The city has also received complaints from women, who said they were subjected 
to catcalls and obscenities, Prince said. 
</P>
<P>
"That kind of thing really stands out on the island," Prince said. "It had a 
real effect on the community." 
</P>
<P>
The INS agents stopped 130 people on streets and inside rooming houses in 
Avalon, requesting proof of citizenship or legal residency, INS officials said. 
The 28 who could not produce proper identification were detained at the local 
sheriff's station and later shipped to Terminal Island on the Coast Guard 
cutter Venturous. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 men escaped by running into the hills, said Thomas Loyd, a special 
agent with the INS. 
</P>
<P>
Agents also searched for, but failed to find, several small encampments in the 
hills where some of the men were reported to have been living. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those captured looked sullen as they walked down a gangplank Tuesday 
afternoon, but a few smiled and waved farewell to the Coast Guard crew. 
</P>
<P>
Several Avalon residents welcomed the INS raid, although they are not convinced 
that it will keep the illegal alien workers away. Less than a week after the 
1986 raid, most of those who were deported had returned to the island, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Brechtel said the INS will try to make sure that does not happen this time. 
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you," he said. "We will return."

TAFT ENDS 8 YEARS OF FUTILITY BY BEATING CHATSWORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tempers flared long before, and immediately after, Mike Kimelman's two-out, 
eighth-inning single to center field scored Doug Kougher from second base to 
give Taft High a 3-2 victory Tuesday over visiting Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Kougher, who barely beat the throw from center fielder Kevin Chong, appeared to 
attempt a headfirst slide between the legs of catcher Eric Johnson. When the 
smoke from the ensuing collision had cleared, the Toreadors swarmed jubilantly 
onto the field, Johnson lay injured and Taft had defeated Chatsworth for the 
first time since 1981, snapping a string of 24 consecutive losses. 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, the win moved Taft (15-9, 11-4 in league play) into a 
first-place tie with the Chancellors (18-6, 11-4) in the West Valley League 
with two games to play. The loss was Chatsworth's second in a row and fourth in 
the past five games. 
</P>
<P>
Seconds after the winning run had scored, however, a brawl nearly erupted. 
Several Chatsworth players challenged the Toreadors, who continued to celebrate 
while Johnson, who eventually left the field under his own power, remained on 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
After a brief team meeting, an uncharacteristically silent Chatsworth Coach Bob 
Lofrano hurried his players onto the bus. 
</P>
<P>
"No comment," Lofrano said repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
Taft Coach Rich McKeon insisted that his players were not celebrating Johnson's 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't happy because he was hurt, I'm positive of that," he said. "I 
think that we were just happy that we beat them. This is a big win for us. 
That's the first time we've played them when it's even been close. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to see a game end like that. I don't encourage it and I know Bob 
doesn't. But it was an emotional moment . . . tie game and the winning run's 
coming in." 
</P>
<P>
Taft senior right-hander Chris Brown (8-3) went the distance, limiting 
Chatsworth to six hits and striking out five, while Chatsworth ace Derek 
Wallace (9-2) went the distance in defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest win in my four years here," Taft catcher Adam Zutler said. 
"We're just so happy to have finally beaten a team that's looked upon as the 
greatest one around. We feel like now we can have some respect." 
</P>
<P>
Said Brown, who recorded his 11th complete game: "I was up most of the night 
figuring out how to pitch to their lineup. It's great. I finally did it." 
</P>
<P>
A turbulent stage had been set long before Kougher doubled to begin the 
game-winning rally. In the fifth, Zutler and Chatsworth third baseman Rich Aude 
went nose to nose for a brief moment after Aude slid under Zutler with the 
tying run. 
</P>
<P>
In the seventh, Chatsworth assistant Joe Koh was ejected by the plate umpire 
for arguing a ball-four call with Taft's Rich Cosentino at bat. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the seventh, the umpire called time to warn an overzealous Taft 
crowd, which taunted Wallace while he was batting. 
</P>
<P>
And both Lofrano and McKeon had delivered lengthy protests over calls by the 
umpires. In the third, Lofrano argued in vain when Cosentino advanced from 
second to third on a ground ball after appearing to have left the basepath to 
avoid a tag by Aude. Cosentino later scored on a single by Glenn Nahmias to 
give Taft a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth, McKeon argued that Chatsworth's Reed McMackin had interfered with 
second baseman Rich Shapiro by not sliding into the base. Shapiro retired 
McMackin but was unable to relay to first for a double play. 
</P>
<P>
While at bat in the eighth, McMackin was called for interfering with Zutler, 
who threw wildly into center field while Chong was attempting to steal second. 
That triggered another protest from the Chatsworth dugout.

GRANADA HILLS ADVANCES IN SPITE OF ITSELF; 
</P>
<P>
SLUGGISH HIGHLANDERS SWEEP NARBONNE TO OPEN CITY SECTION VOLLEYBALL PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The absence of three starters clearly affected Granada Hills High in the 
opening round of the City Section boys' volleyball playoffs Tuesday at Granada 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
But after the Highlanders had posted a less-than-impressive 15-2, 15-13, 15-8 
sweep of Narbonne, Coach Tom Harp bemoaned a familiar concern for his team's 
inconsistent play. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a problem all season . . . us losing our concentration," Harp said. 
</P>
<P>
Against Narbonne, however, the Highlanders could afford their lapses and the 
excused absences of three starters -- one because of illness and two others for 
scholastic testing. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills (15-2), which also swept Narbonne (6-11) during the regular 
season, raced to an 8-0 lead to put the first game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
"We got off to a bad start, " Narbonne Coach Jim Backstrom said. "But our luck 
changed in the final two games." 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills, after dominating the first game on the strength of outside 
hitters Sam Goldman and Dan Govenar, who finished with 11 and eight kills, 
respectively, struggled before finishing off Narbonne. 
</P>
<P>
The Gauchos, led by outside hitter Tyrone Gaines, forged ties of 6-6 and 9-9 in 
the second game. Gaines had five of his nine kills in the game. Govenar, 
however, led Granada Hills to leads of 12-9 and 14-13 before the Highlanders 
closed out the game on a Narbonne passing error. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very disappointed that we didn't win game two," Backstrom said. "I give 
the team credit for hanging in there, though, Granada Hills is a good team." 
</P>
<P>
In the third game, Narbonne rode the hitting of Cuong Nguyen to a 7-5 lead. But 
Dane Rood and Goldman followed with two kills each as Granada Hills regained 
command and went on to close out the match. 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders will face Westchester, one of four seeded teams that received a 
first-round bye, Thursday at Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of things to work on before the Westchester game Thursday," Harp 
said. "They're a strong offensive team and our blocking will be critical."

COACHES TORN BETWEEN STRIKE, TEAM LOYALTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Section coaches wrestled with conflicting loyalties as they reacted 
Tuesday to the Board of Education's directive that would allow them to 
supervise their teams in playoff competition even if they participate in a 
proposed teacher strike against the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
The directive runs counter to previous district policy that forbade teachers 
from extracurricular activity if they participated in a strike. The new 
directive came in the wake of Monday's announcement by District Supt. Leonard 
Britton, who ordered teachers to turn in final grade information Monday, more 
than two weeks before the strike date set by the United Teachers-Los Angeles. 
If teachers fail to comply, paychecks will be withheld, according to Britton. 
</P>
<P>
In response, the union threatened to strike Monday instead of May 30. The new 
strike date falls in the middle of the City Section playoff schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Postseason competition has begun in track and starts this week in girls' 
gymnastics, softball and volleyball. Also likely to be affected by a strike are 
baseball, golf and tennis. 
</P>
<P>
Coaches strained to interpret the implications of Tuesday's directive. Although 
some viewed the move as an advantage for coaches, most criticized the action, 
saying that it would force them to choose between supporting their teams or 
their colleagues. Few had decided which action to take. 
</P>
<P>
"The board is trying to throw the monkey on the coaches' backs," San Fernando 
baseball Coach Steve Marden said. "This makes us the fall guy. They're trying 
to wedge us between the union and the players. It's absolutely a no-win 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Coaches also claimed that the directive was designed to shift parental concerns 
if sporting events are canceled from the board to coaches and to undermine 
union solidarity. Julie Korenstein, West San Fernando Valley board member, 
rejected those charges. 
</P>
<P>
"Our intention is not to undermine the union but to give teachers options," she 
said. "It allows teachers to make the moral decision of whether to strike, and 
then they still may participate in extracurricular activities." 
</P>
<P>
But coaches feared that the strike may negate months of work toward possible 
championships. Taft baseball Coach Rich McKeon has led his team to a playoff 
berth for the first time since 1980 and considers abandonment of his team 
nearly unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the playoffs to happen, and, if they do, I can't see me missing them," 
he said. "I hope other teachers understand the predicament we're in." 
</P>
<P>
The City Section intends to conduct the playoffs as scheduled but has no 
contingency plan in the event of a walkout. City Section Commissioner Hal 
Harkness was busy Tuesday structuring playoff brackets and said that plans in 
the event of a strike have yet to be discussed. He also said he was surprised 
by the board's directive. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a 180-degree turn from previous policy. I don't envy the coaches. 
Whatever decision they make, they're going to have to live with. Nobody said it 
was going to be easy." 
</P>
<P>
Marden said that he feels as though he is living those words. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us have great loyalty to the kids, who have invested countless hours, 
and we also have a commitment to our profession. Supporting one is 
counterproductive to the other," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Marden and Chatsworth Coach Bob Lofrano plan to discuss options with other 
baseball coaches whose teams have qualified for the playoffs. Many of those 
coaches will attend a seeding meeting tonight at the City Section offices. 
Baseball playoffs begin May 24. 
</P>
<P>
Marden hopes to reach an understanding that would allow coaches to act in 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
Most coaches said they feared standing on the sidelines while their 
counterparts participated in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to see if we want to be unanimous and cohesive," Marden said. "I think 
it will take the pressure off us individually if we act collectively. 
</P>
<P>
"But I would feel awful foolish if everyone else is playing baseball and I'm 
walking a picket line with Bob Lofrano." 
</P>
<P>
Lofrano understands that reaction but seems willing to walk the picket line 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
"If I support the union and strike against the school district, does that 
commitment change at 2:30 when it comes time for practice or a game? You have 
to stand by your beliefs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lofrano claims that the district could solve the dilemma by postponing the 
playoffs. If the strike carried through the end of the school year and the 
playoffs were canceled, those coaches are prepared to live with that outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"The season is 95% over and the kids who were recruited have gotten the 
exposure they needed," Lofrano said. "The playoffs are a fun time, but it's not 
a lost season if we don't play them. And you're talking to a guy who has a shot 
at winning the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
"Why won't the district shut everything down in the afternoon? I think their 
priorities are off. Is the sports season that important to the district?" 
</P>
<P>
Even though many agreed with Lofrano, they were left with a disquieting 
feeling. What about the players? 
</P>
<P>
Neils Ludlow's softball team at El Camino Real is scheduled to open defense of 
its City 4-A Division softball title next week. He has yet to decide on a 
strike stance but cannot see his team competing without him. 
</P>
<P>
"In a strike situation, nobody wins," he said. "It leaves a bitter taste and 
splits faculties. But my gut feeling is that I can't let my team down. I don't 
know what that means yet, but I can't let them down."

MOORPARK TO MEET MT. SAC IN SOFTBALL PLAYOFF OPENER 
</P>

<P>
Moorpark College will play host to Mt. San Antonio at 3 this afternoon in the 
first round of the Southern California junior college regional softball 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore De Dow (24-7), the Western State Conference Pitcher of the Year the 
past two seasons, will start for Moorpark. If the Lady Raiders win, they will 
play host to either El Camino or College of the Canyons in a best-of-three 
series beginning Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark, seeded third in the playoffs, set a single-season record for 
victories with a 32-10 mark. The Lady Raiders have won 41 conference games in a 
row at home and three consecutive WSC titles. 
</P>
<P>
"The hard thing about this tournament is that if you lose that first-round game 
you're out," Moorpark Coach Will Thurston said. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark lost, 5-4, to Mt. San Antonio (18-18), seeded 14th, in a nonconference 
game earlier this season in the only meeting between the teams. 
</P>
<P>
Should it survive, Moorpark is guaranteed home berths for the first two rounds 
of the tournament because of its seeding. San Diego Mesa eliminated the Lady 
Raiders in the second round of the tournament last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're real deserving of that third seed," Thurston said. "We've 
already accomplished a couple of our goals by winning the conference and 
staying undefeated at home in conference play." 
</P>
<P>
In another first-round game at 3 this afternoon, Canyons (26-14), seeded 11th, 
will play at El Camino, seeded sixth.

<P>
The Hart High baseball team gave Coach Bud Murray an appropriate gift for his 
300th career victory Tuesday, smashing three home runs in a 15-4 Foothill 
League win at Schurr. 
</P>
<P>
Hart's Robby Davis started the onslaught with a two-run shot to left in the 
first inning. David Toledo also homered in the inning, a three-run blast to 
left that capped a six-run rally. In the fifth, Casey Burrill hit his sixth 
home run, a 400-foot, three-run shot to left. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Halcovich (8-2) allowed one earned run, struck out two and walked two in 
five innings as Hart (19-5, 10-4 in league play) defeated Schurr for the sixth 
time in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gives Murray, in his third season at Hart, a 17-year record of 
300-120.

DIGEST: OXNARD'S VALENCIA DECIDES TO CAST LOT WITH PHILLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gil Valencia, a former Camarillo High baseball player and a left fielder for 
Oxnard College this season, said Tuesday that he has signed a contract with the 
Philadelphia Phillies organization. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia, 18, was drafted by the Phillies in the late rounds of last year's 
free-agent draft but opted to play at Oxnard. The Phillies, however, retain 
rights to him for a year, and Valencia decided to forgo his sophomore season. 
</P>
<P>
He will report to the organization's rookie camp in Clearwater, Fla., in early 
June and likely will be assigned to one of the Phillies' Class A affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm dying to go down there, see the talent and take my shot," Valencia said. 
"It was an offer that really appealed to me." 
</P>
<P>
Valencia hit .350 for the Condors this season. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge, the top-ranked team in the NCAA Division II, will play 
host to the West regional softball tournament Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The four-team, double-elimination playoff starts Saturday with Cal Poly San 
Luis Obispo meeting defending national champion Cal State Bakersfield at 9 a.m. 
and Northridge playing Cal State Dominguez Hills at 11. All four teams are from 
the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, which won the CCAA title for the eighth consecutive year, is coming 
off a win in the Sixth Sacramento State Invitational last weekend. The Lady 
Matadors won six of seven games and improved their record to 60-17. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Torgeson, CSUN's coach, said that junior All-American Debbie Dickmann will 
be the starting pitcher against Dominguez Hills and Heather Lindstrom will go 
in Saturday's second game. 
</P>
<P>
The first-round losers will play at 1:30 p.m. and the winners will meet at 
3:30. Sunday's games are scheduled for noon and 2 p.m., with a third game to 
follow if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the regional advances to the national championship tournament May 
19-21 at the Sacramento softball complex. 
</P>
<P>
George Peraza has resigned only two weeks after completing his first season as 
baseball coach at Oxnard College. 
</P>
<P>
The Condors finished the season 16-15 overall and tied Moorpark for third place 
in the Western State Conference standings with an 11-9 record. 
</P>
<P>
Peraza, a Spanish teacher at Thousand Oaks High, said that his decision stemmed 
from the difficulty of performing what was, in effect, two full-time jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"It was too hectic," said Peraza, who was paid a stipend for coaching the 
Condors on a walk-on basis. "Being a head coach is an enormous amount of work, 
and not all of it is coaching baseball. It's a lot of paper work." 
</P>
<P>
Peraza said that his best years at Oxnard were the nine he spent as an 
assistant to former baseball Coach Jerry White. "That was nice," he said. "All 
I did then was come to the field and coach." 
</P>
<P>
Peraza said that he would like to remain in coaching but has no immediate 
plans. "If any full-time jobs open you'll see me there going for it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gil Carrillo of the Moorpark College men's track team qualified in two events 
for the Southern California finals at Cerritos College on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Carrillo leaped 22 feet, 5 inches to qualify in the long jump in the Southern 
California prelims at Cerritos last week. The 400-meter relay team of Carrillo, 
Paul Lefton, Danny Cross and Gordon Prescod also qualified in 9 minutes, 46.16 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Other qualifiers included: Ramon Perez in the 1,500 (4:00.73), Chris Anderson 
in the triple jump (44-9), Korey Fleck in the javelin (177-1), Matt Thomson in 
the steeplechase (9:46.16) and Efrain Robles in the 10,000 (32:57). 
</P>
<P>
In the women's meet, Carol Myszkowski qualified in the long jump (16-8) and the 
triple jump (36-7 3/4). 
</P>
<P>
Other qualifiers included: Remera Jones in the high jump (5-0), Colleen Gavin 
in the 400 (58:36), Lisa Noller in the 800 (2:25.88) and Anna Howald in the 
1,500 (5:00.52). 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark's 1,600-relay team of Howald, Noller, Gavin and Vicky Wagenbach 
qualified in 4:08.35. 
</P>
<P>
Three players from Moorpark College, two each from Canyons and Glendale, and 
one each from Pierce and Valley are included on the All-Western State 
Conference baseball first team. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman pitcher John Chiaramonte, freshman infielder Steve Sisco and and 
sophomore catcher Craig Pearson were selected from Moorpark. First baseman Art 
Chute and outfielder John Bojanac of Glendale made the team as did infielder 
Ernie Perez and outfielder Randy Cooper of Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
Infielders Ray Sabado of Valley and Billy Morris of Pierce also were selected. 
</P>
<P>
The player of the year was pitcher Dean McMillin of Ventura and the coach of 
the year was Gary Anglin of Ventura, which shared the conference title with 
Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
Missy Cress, a sophomore catcher at Moorpark College who hit .475 to lead WSC 
players, was selected as the conference player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore De Dow (24-7) was selected as the conference's pitcher of the year 
for the second consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
Cress and Dow were both chosen for the all-conference first team along with 
first baseman Chris Singer, second baseman Audra Olive, outfielder Rustie 
Stevens and designated-hitter Kelly Kauffman. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Campos and Anthony Espitia of Cal Lutheran were named to the All-NAIA 
District 3 baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore right-hander Mike Clark, who compiled an 8-2 record to lead the 
Kingsmen, was an all-district and an All-Golden State Athletic Conference 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
Campos also was selected for the all-conference team along with third baseman 
Jeff Brouelette. 
</P>
<P>
Six Cal Lutheran softball players were named to both the NAIA All-District 3 
first team and the All-Golden State Athletic Conference first team. 
</P>
<P>
DeeAndra Pilkington, Leslie Stevens, Danielle Piotrowski, Teri Rupe, Katie 
Kjonegaard and Kim White were named to both teams. Brenda Frafjord was named to 
the NAIA team. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Zigler, a midfielder from Burroughs High of Ridgecrest, has signed a 
letter of intent to play soccer at Cal State Northridge, the school announced 
Tuesday. Zigler was the most valuable player in the Golden League. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge also announced the signing of Ruth Aguilar (women's basketball) and 
Scott Richardson (baseball). 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar, who verbally committed three weeks ago, led Valley College to the 
state junior college championship game. The 5-10 forward was most valuable 
player in the Western State Conference. Richardson plays outfield for 
Eisenhower High in Rialto.

<P>
UCSD READY TO ADD TO LIST OF 1989 TITLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
UC San Diego is preparing for its annual spring trophy dash, with as many as 
five teams advancing to NCAA Division III national championships. 
</P>
<P>
The Tritons, who already have won national titles in women's volleyball and 
men's soccer and finished second in women's soccer and men's and women's 
swimming, could be headed for their finest season. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD has never won three national titles in a season. Leading the way this 
spring is the softball team, ranked No. 2 in the nation in Division III and 
headed for the three-team West Regional at Grand Rapids, Mich., where the 
Tritons are the top seed. 
</P>
<P>
Host Calvin (25-5) plays North Central (27-5) of Naperville, Ill. Friday at 
noon (EDT) in the first round of the double-elimination tournament. The Tritons 
will play the loser at 2 p.m. and then meet the winner of the first-round game 
at 4. The 20-team tournament is divided into six regionals, with the winners 
advancing to the national tournament May 19-20 at Trenton State (N.J.) College. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the Tritons had missed on the regionals for three consecutive 
seasons. Lisa Bassi and Lin Adams became co-coaches before last season and 
revitalized the program, leading them back to the regionals, where they were 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD is having its finest softball season; the Tritons are 34-7, including 23-2 
against Division III teams. They have a 13-game winning streak, including six 
consecutive shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
"As the old saying goes, 'You're only as strong as your weakest link,' " Bassi 
said. "We had glaring weaknesses at a couple positions that really hurt us last 
year." 
</P>
<P>
The Tritons apparently have shored them up. And pitching has remained a 
mainstay, with four quality members of the staff. 
</P>
<P>
Dianna Moreno is only 5-feet but looms on the mound with a 12-3 record and 0.25 
earned-run average. Kathy Fogg, a transfer from Golden West Community College, 
is 9-2 with a 0.88 ERA, and Stacie Sasaki is 9-1, including a no-hitter and two 
one-hitters, and an 0.66 ERA. Lynn Moreno is 4-1 with a 2.20 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year we were just happy to be at the regionals," Bassi said. "This fall 
we were talking of going to nationals and winning it." 
</P>
<P>
The UCSD women's tennis team is in the midst of competing in the 10-team 
national championships at Claremont-Mudd College. The Tritons are seeded third 
behind No. 1 Gustavus Adolphus and No. 2 Pomona-Pitzer. 
</P>
<P>
The men's tennis team is seeded sixth in the 10-team regional at Kalamazoo, 
Mich., which begins Sunday. The Tritons are 14-10, 12-1 against Division III 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
The men's golf team is expected to get a berth in the 20-team national 
tournament at Lake Panorama Golf Course in Panora, Iowa, May 23-26. And the 
baseball team is battling three other teams for the two West Regional spots. 
The teams advancing to the best of three-of-five regional will be announced 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the top four ranked men's college volleyball players in digs are from 
San Diego schools. Cesar Mata of San Diego State led the nation with 2.94 digs 
per game. UC San Diego's Jeff Babcock was third at 2.91, and Nick Rothman was 
fourth at 2.78. Mike Schlegel of SDSU was 16th at 2.34. Mata was also ranked 
No. 10 in service aces with .333 per game. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD won its second consecutive Pacific Coast Volleyball Conference title with 
a 3-1 victory over La Verne. Freshman outside hitter Nate Brown of UCSD was 
named the conference MVP. Babcock, a senior outside hitter, and junior middle 
blocker John Lim were also named to the all-conference team. 
</P>
<P>
The U. S. International University baseball team didn't set any records with 
its 22-32 record, but Kevin Tahan and Scott Coutts had record-breaking seasons 
for the Gulls. They have three records each this season, with five games 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Tahan, who played two years at Stanford, set single-season records for home 
runs (16), runs (62) and RBIs (58). (Paul Sokolowski set the previous records 
for homers -- 12 -- and RBIs -- 53 -- in 1980, and John Ronis set the mark for 
runs -- 52 -- in 1987.) 
</P>
<P>
Coutts set single-season records for at-bats (227), hits (85) and doubles (23). 
Bob Esquerra (1986) had set the previous mark of 17 doubles and Art Calvert the 
record for at-bats (222). Calvert (1984) and Ronis (1987) jointly held the 
previous hits record of 73. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Carne has been named the U.S. International University women's volleyball 
coach, replacing Kurt Donaldson. Carne played at San Diego State.

OFFICIALS ABUZZ WITH PLANS AS KILLER BEES HEAD NORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though Africanized "killer" bees aren't expected to reach San Diego County for 
several years, county and state agriculture officials are taking no chances. 
</P>
<P>
The county agricultural commissioner's office has set a bee trap near each of 
the county's three border crossings -- San Ysidro, Otay Mesa and Tecate -- in 
the hope that none of the Africanized bees enter the county from Central or 
South America without agriculture and health officials knowing about it. 
</P>
<P>
State agriculture officials have set three traps of their own in the county, 
including one at San Diego Bay, where they fear the bees are most likely to 
appear. 
</P>
<P>
"We are on the front-line as one of the first counties in California that will 
be hit by the Africanized bee," said David Kellum, an entomologist with the 
county agricultural commissioner's office. "If we have a stinging incident 
here, it will become national news. The county will have to 
</P>
<P>
coordinate its efforts with the tourist industry to assure the people the 
situation is under control." 
</P>
<P>
The county traps, baited with a pheromone that will attract all bees, are made 
of corrugated paper and look like a hollow tree. Biologists check the traps 
once a week, when the bees are killed with a spray and taken to a laboratory to 
determine if any are the Africanized variety. 
</P>
<P>
State officials have set about 36 traps throughout California, primarily in 
coastal areas where the bees might come ashore off ships. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists expect the Africanized bees to arrive in Texas early next year and 
in San Diego two to five years later. They are now found as far north as the 
Mexican state of Veracruz, about 300 miles south of Brownsville, Tex. Officials 
believe the bees are more likely to enter along coastal areas such as San Diego 
rather than in areas such as the Imperial Valley because Africanized bees have 
an aversion to deserts. 
</P>
<P>
Why all the fuss over these dreaded hybrids? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Persistent, Large Swarms 
</P>
<P>
Though their venom is no more potent than that of the native European variety 
found in the United States, the Africanized insects sting in larger swarms and 
generally pursue an intruder for a longer time over a greater distance. 
</P>
<P>
More than 300 people have reportedly died in the wake of the Africanized bees' 
northward flight since they were released -- some say escaped -- from a 
laboratory in Brazil in 1956. The ornery and unpredictable bees are a cross 
between European bees and an Africanized strain. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to posing a health problem, the Africanized bees are also a threat 
to California crops that rely on pollination, an industry worth $2 billion a 
year, and to the state's $18 million-a-year honey production business, 
according to Kellum. 
</P>
<P>
As the largest bee-keeping state in the nation, California will be particularly 
hard hit by the Africanized bees, according to Pat Paswater, apiary projects 
leader with the state Department of Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Professional pollinators who transport bees to farms and fields face the 
problem of attempting to control Africanized bees. Fields, for example, might 
have to be abandoned by human workers while the bees pollinate crops. 
</P>
<P>
The additional costs pollinators will suffer in handling Africanized bees and 
trying to keep them away from their European colonies will inevitably be passed 
on to farmers and then to consumers, said Paswater, in a telephone interview 
from Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
For those in the honey business, the Africanized bee presents another problem 
besides its ill temper: It devours much of its own honey, thus making it a 
less-efficient honey producer than the European bee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Look-Alikes 
</P>
<P>
Africanized bees reaching the county via trucks, planes or ships from Central 
or South America could proliferate unless officials keep a close watch. Very 
close. Even entomologists cannot distinguish Africanized bees from native 
European honey bees without putting them through a series of tests, Kellum 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the potential for an early explosion of Africanized bees in the 
county are the bees' dominant traits: a European strain of bee becomes 
Africanized when it crossbreeds with bees carrying genes from the African bees. 
Rather than coexist with other bees, Africanized bees take over hives, push 
aside rivals and dominate mating. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Africanized bees are more prolific breeders than Europeans and swarm five 
or six times a year; European bees only swarm in the spring, Kellum said. 
European queens live for six months and lay 1,500 eggs a day; while Africanized 
queens live more than eight months and lay about 2,000 eggs daily. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Check of All Hives 
</P>
<P>
If an Africanized bee is found in one of the traps, Kellum said, county 
biologists will inspect all bee colonies in the area, including those kept by 
beekeepers, to locate the Africanized bees. If a colony with Africanized bees 
is found, Kellum said, it will be destroyed -- a practice that scientists 
expect will be commonplace once the bees arrive in great numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, county and state officials plan to coordinate efforts to inform the 
public of how to avoid and report Africanized bees. 
</P>
<P>
"They're like a hurricane: You can't stop them from coming but you can prepare 
for them," Kellum said. 
</P>
<P>
The county, Kellum said, is already considering the question of who will be 
responsible if a stinging death or serious injury occurs on public property, 
such as at a beach or park. 
</P>
<P>
Paswater expects that, once the bees reach California, residents who live near 
pollinated crops or beekeeping sites will demand that the bees be removed. 
</P>
<P>
"The public will perceive them as a threat, and just as any threat, there will 
be laws passed to minimize the problem," he said. "Essentially, you'll end up 
with a situation where it's more difficult to pollinate crops that are close to 
residences. People will be very reluctant to have bees anywhere near where they 
are living."

2 SCRIPPS CLINIC RESEARCHERS ARE SEEN AIDING PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA ROACH MONROE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two biochemists with key expertise in the field of drug design have accepted 
positions at the Research Institute of Scripps Clinic, a development that will 
strengthen the scientific center's effort to turn its basic research into 
commercially marketable products. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the scientists could augment the institution's continuing work to 
create and produce man-made enzymes that Scripps researchers hope could 
revolutionize industrial processes worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
The two researchers, who are to assume positions as full faculty members -- the 
equivalent of full professorships in academia -- are: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shapes of Proteins 
</P>
<P>
* Jeffrey Skolnick, 35, a professor of chemistry at Washington University in 
St. Louis and a specialist in protein structure. Skolnick uses computers to 
determine the specific shapes into which proteins fold themselves to do the 
work they perform inside a cell. 
</P>
<P>
This structural work is considered essential to finding useful new drugs by 
designing them rationally, rather than by the conventional method of randomly 
testing promising chemicals. It also could lead to the design of "better" 
proteins, such as enzymes that would function outside the normal biological 
range of temperature and acidity. 
</P>
<P>
* Chi-Huey Wong, 40, a biochemist and professor at Texas A &amp; M University. 
Wong specializes in using enzymes, the molecules that are the cell's natural 
chemistry factory, to make peptides, proteins and carbohydrates necessary 
</P>
<P>
for life. 
</P>
<P>
Both are expected to establish labs, complete with postdoctoral researchers and 
doctoral students they will bring with them, at Scripps in June. A shortage of 
lab space will require some other researchers to set up labs in rented space at 
a nearby biotechnology company, Gen-Probe, said William H. Beers, associate 
director of the research institute. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the two might have laboratories in a new Scripps building being 
planned across North Torrey Pines Road from the institute's current facilities, 
Beers said. 
</P>
<P>
Skolnick's expertise lies in protein structure theory, a field in which he will 
rely on the massive computing capability available with the Scripps Cray 
supercomputer, Beers said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Root of Malfunctions 
</P>
<P>
Protein structure is key to designing drugs rationally because too little or 
too much of a particularly shaped protein is often at the root of malfunctions 
in the body. If a protein's shape were known, chemists could then design 
another molecule to lock into that structure as a therapeutic drug. 
</P>
<P>
Skolnick received his doctorate in 1978 from Yale University and has been at 
Washington University since 1985. Both he and Wong have received the 
prestigious Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship. 
</P>
<P>
Wong joined the Texas A &amp; M faculty in 1983 after completing his doctorate 
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He became a full professor in 
1987. Wong's awards include selection as a Presidential Young Investigator, a 
program in which the nation's most promising young researchers are given 
no-strings-attached grants of $125,000 to help them get started. 
</P>
<P>
His emphasis on using natural or modified enzymes to create chemicals can be 
expected to be important to Scripps' efforts to create rationally designed 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Within the past five years, Scripps has been turning from its past emphasis on 
basic research in immunology and adding molecular biologists and chemists as 
part of its effort to produce commercial products. Officials there reiterate 
their commitment to basic research and immunology, but say it is time to also 
turn the institute's years of fruitful basic research into products that will 
help people. 
</P>
<P>
However, the shift also will mean increasing patent revenues for the institute, 
as well as increased donations from companies interested in marketing any 
breakthrough products Scripps produces. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Catalytic Antibodies 
</P>
<P>
Wong and Skolnick's expertise also could prove key in a team that has been 
assembled by Dr. Richard Lerner, director of the Research Institute of Scripps 
Clinic, to create commercially valuable catalytic antibodies. 
</P>
<P>
The group led by Lerner has published several scientific papers in recent years 
cataloguing steady progress toward using immunological techniques to design 
antibodies that will catalyze chemical reactions. 
</P>
<P>
The hope is that these synthetic enzymes can be created to accomplish chemical 
processes for which no enzymes have ever been available. 
</P>
<P>
Known as abzymes -- a hybrid of antibody and enzyme -- these substances would 
have to be first designed and tested by immunologists and by chemists such as 
Wong and Skolnick. Then Scripps' plant molecular biologists would be poised to 
design a gene that would produce the abzyme and insert it into plants, which 
eventually could be grown as a crop and harvested for the abzyme. 
</P>
<P>
Although scientists say such a chain of events is complicated and years away, 
commercial production of abzymes is a tantalizing possibility toward which 
Lerner has been steadily moving Scripps since taking over as institute director 
in January, 1987.

MEMBER OF SECT TESTIFIES OF DEPROGRAMMING ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 23-year-old woman Tuesday gave a wrenching description of the injuries and 
emotional abuse she said she suffered after being abducted last May by her 
family and a self-proclaimed cult deprogrammer in an effort to snatch her from 
a San Diego-based religious group. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying in Vista Municipal Court on the first day of a preliminary hearing, 
Ginger Brown said she had warned her parents months before not to kidnap her, 
urging them instead to accept her devotion to the group, Great Among the 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them that if they did anything to harm me in any way . . . then I'd 
take them to the fullest extent of the law," Brown testified, outlining the 
events leading up to her abduction outside the Encinitas real estate office 
where she worked. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Injuries 'Overstated' 
</P>
<P>
But attorneys for the five people charged with kidnaping Brown, including her 
parents and sister, have maintained that the bruises and cuts suffered by the 
young woman were mostly self-inflicted as she struggled to regain her freedom 
during the abduction and deprogramming process. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly feel (the injuries and abuse) are being overstated," said Saul 
Wright, an attorney representing the father, Earle Brown. 
</P>
<P>
In what could be a blow to the defense, Judge Michael Burley indicated he will 
not allow the religious tenets of Great Among the Nations to become an issue in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
"A person's religious beliefs alone cannot be grounds for taking for 
deprogramming," Burley said. "There has to be a threat of immediate physical 
harm" for a kidnaping to be considered justified. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, however, argued that the spiritual underpinnings of the group are 
paramount to the defense's effort to determine whether Great Among the Nations 
"is a bona fide religion" or if its leader, Benjamin Altschul, is "a religious 
nut." 
</P>
<P>
Those remarks prompted an angry response from Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Remple 
after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Comparison to Salem 
</P>
<P>
"I want Mr. Wright to explain what a bona fide religion is," Remple told 
reporters in a courthouse hallway. "I haven't heard a statement like that in a 
hundred years. . . . It was done in Salem once upon a time." 
</P>
<P>
As the preliminary hearing wound on in Vista, another member of the fundamental 
Bible study group, Dina Geerling, 38, announced to the press and police Tuesday 
in San Diego that she had been successfully deprogrammed at the behest of her 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
Geerling held a news conference to denounce what she said are the cult-like 
practices of the group and Altschul. She then went to a San Diego police 
station to tell detectives she did not plan to press kidnaping charges against 
her abductors. 
</P>
<P>
"She said it was not a kidnaping, but an act of love, a rescue," Detective 
David Morris said. "She's thankful for what they did." 
</P>
<P>
Morris said Geerling told him during a 50-minute meeting that Altschul is 
"totally controlling" the 17-member group, convincing the members that 
outsiders are evil, and monitoring basic activities such as telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Geerling said, Alt-schul had advocated that Ginger Brown and other 
members press charges against relatives if they were seized and held for 
deprogramming, the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Spiritual Foundation 
</P>
<P>
During the preliminary hearing Tuesday, however, Ginger Brown said she is 
pressing ahead with the kidnaping case on her own free will. 
</P>
<P>
She painted a picture of Great Among the Nations as a small, tight-knit 
Christian Bible study and evangelism ministry that holds no sway over her 
emotions or decisions, but provides a spiritual foundation for her life. 
</P>
<P>
Critics, among them former members, have characterized the group as a cult 
whose members finance what they say is the lavish life style of Altschul. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's case is being pressed against her parents, Earle Brown, 57, and Dorothy 
Rae Brown, 57, and a sister, Holly Rae Brown, 24, all of Santa Cruz; Hank 
Erler, 22, in whose Escondido home Ginger Brown was allegedly held for five 
days, and Cliff Daniels, 34, of Los Angeles, a deprogrammer who has publicly 
said he attempted to "rescue" Brown from the group. 
</P>
<P>
Brown testified that she was raised as a church-going person, encouraged by her 
parents to take part in religious activities ranging from Campus Crusade for 
Christ to the choir. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, she became involved with Altschul's group, and promptly decided after 
her sophomore year at UC San Diego to drop out and devote her energy to the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Showed Up Unannounced 
</P>
<P>
By the summer of 1987, Brown said, she grew concerned about being kidnaped for 
a deprogramming attempt when her parents suddenly showed up at her doorstep 
unannounced one day. 
</P>
<P>
Brown asked them if they were in the San Diego area to participate in a rumored 
meeting between parents of several group members and a local television station 
in an attempt to drum up publicity to "break up the ministry," she testified. 
Her parents, however, said they "just wanted to go for a ride" and ended up 
visiting her, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Brown watched a televised news segment on Great Among the Nations and 
saw her parents on the program. 
</P>
<P>
Although angry and upset by that apparent betrayal, Brown decided to quit her 
job as a secretary and move back to Santa Cruz in an effort to hammer out a 
reconciliation with her parents, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to explain to them my position in the ministry. But each time I'd try 
to explain, they would clam up," Brown said, adding that she felt her parents 
had been swayed by Daniels to believe the religious group was a cult. 
</P>
<P>
"Now they were trying to direct me on how I would live, work, believe, act," 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shadowed by Van 
</P>
<P>
After she learned that her parents were continuing to conspire against the 
group, Brown returned to San Diego and moved into an apartment with another 
woman who belonged to the group, she said. 
</P>
<P>
After being shadowed by a mysterious van for several days, Brown said, she was 
jumped on May 12, 1988, by a large man who herded her down an embankment and 
into a waiting van manned by her father. 
</P>
<P>
Tears welling in her eyes and her voice choking, Brown described how she was 
struck across the face, spit on and forced flat to the floor of the van during 
the trip to a remote house in rural northern Escondido. She said one of the 
abductors beat her head four times against the floor and told her to stop 
screaming or he would kill her. 
</P>
<P>
At the house, Brown was forced to sleep on the floor or was confined to a 
second-floor bedroom while constantly guarded, she said. Her parents, sister, 
Daniels and Erler all participated in the deprogramming effort, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said her father at one point threatened to break her leg and that her 
mother refused her requests for a doctor's attention, instead giving her 
Tylenol. Through it all, she said, her parents insisted they were "doing this 
because we love you." 
</P>
<P>
Daniels, meanwhile, threatened her by suggesting that "my arms and legs were 
like twigs and he could snap them no problem," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refused to Submit 
</P>
<P>
Brown refused to submit to their deprogramming attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so angry that I was being held, I didn't feel I had any obligation to 
sit and speak rationally to these crooks," she testified. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, she was told she would be taken home, Brown said. The young woman 
said she was blindfolded and led out to a van. After pulling off the blindfold, 
Brown said, she gave her father directions to the Encinitas sheriff's station, 
but he pulled a fast U-turn when he reached the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him this was his opportunity to turn himself in, that a judge might go 
lighter on him," Brown testified. 
</P>
<P>
She said she screamed and tried to get out of the van as it sped down the 
roadway, while her mother held down the door lock and scratched her neck. 
Finally, however, her father pulled off the road and let her go, Brown said.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: ROBERTI DECIDES IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO RIGHT A WRONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Sen. David Roberti is seeking a gubernatorial pardon for Pedro J. 
Gonzalez, whose colorful life and controversial criminal conviction in 1934 
were the subjects of both a documentary and feature film by a San Diego 
filmmaker. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti became interested in the 95-year-old Gonzalez, who lived in Chula Vista 
before moving last year to Northern California, after an aide saw the 1984 
documentary, "Ballad of an Unsung Hero." 
</P>
<P>
"Pedro was both a leader and a symbol to hundreds of thousands in the Spanish- 
speaking Los Angeles of the '30s," said Roberti, a Democrat from Hollywood and 
president pro tempore of the Senate. "His trial and conviction are shameful 
reminders of racism's legacy in California." 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1930s, Gonzalez, who had fought in the Mexican revolution beside 
Pancho Villa, was a popular radio personality in L. A. 
</P>
<P>
In 1934, he was convicted of rape and sentenced to 50 years in prison. Many 
thought he was victimized for having challenged the district attorney and 
speaking out against the forced deportation of Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez was paroled after six years and deported to Mexico. He operated a 
radio station in Tijuana for 30 years and returned to the United States in 1971 
to be close to his children. 
</P>
<P>
"A pardon would be wonderful," said Bonnie Ramirez, 58, a San Diego resident 
and the youngest of Gonzalez's nine children. "He never did anything to go to 
prison for. It was all prejudice. Imagine what he could have done for the 
Mexican people in Los Angeles if he had been allowed to remain on the radio." 
</P>
<P>
Filmmaker Isaac Artenstein, whose documentary won an Emmy and whose feature 
film, "Break of Dawn," premiered in March, said a pardon is long overdue. 
Gonzalez is in failing health. 
</P>
<P>
"The pardon would be mostly symbolic at this point, but it is a wrong that has 
never been corrected," Artenstein said. "Hopefully it will spread good will in 
the Latino community in California." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Gov. George Deukmejian said the pardon request is being 
studied. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Token of a Scheme 
</P>
<P>
Sorry, Mom and Dad. Parenthood is still a thankless job. 
</P>
<P>
The consumer fraud unit of the San Diego city attorney's office issued an alert 
this week about the rip-offs that sprout up every high school graduation 
season. A new one allegedly involves a "parent appreciation plaque." 
</P>
<P>
The plaque arrives after supposedly being ordered by a new grad as a token of 
love. A fast-talking salesman pressures the folks into paying $25. 
</P>
<P>
Only later do the parents realize that their child never ordered such a plaque. 
Or, worse yet, the child may have rejected the plaque idea as unmerited. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
She Knew That 
</P>
<P>
Life has been busy for Kelly Roberts since The Times' Tom Gorman detailed how 
even skeptical cops have come to believe she may really have the psychic powers 
she claims. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, 31, who maintains offices in Escondido and San Diego, has been asked 
to intervene in several missing-persons cases and a homicide case. She even 
ventured to Los Angeles last weekend for a round of appointments with would-be 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
Four actors asked for advice on how to break into show business, and one guy 
wanted to know how to get a buddy out of prison. 
</P>
<P>
A woman asked for help finding her sunglasses. Another was looking for a gold 
watch. Still another was searching for her missing furniture. 
</P>
<P>
Not all has been pleasant, however. One man made an appointment to ask about a 
problem, but before he arrived Roberts realized he meant to do her harm. Being 
clairvoyant, she says, she's often able to do that. 
</P>
<P>
"I tuned into it in time to take some precaution," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
The same sort of foreboding helped her avoid disappointment when The Times 
turned down her request to place an ad. The paper has a policy against ads for 
clairvoyants, palm readers, fortune tellers, card or tealeaf readers, spiritual 
advisers and psychic or faith healers. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew in advance they would turn me down, but I decided to try anyway," she 
said.

ATTORNEY HELD ON SUSPICION OF HELPING CLIENT TO HIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego defense lawyer is being held on $500,000 bail after he allegedly 
helped a client who is charged with operating a high-class prostitution ring 
elude authorities, a spokesman for the district attorney's office said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Buford B. Wiley Jr. was arrested Monday after authorities developed information 
indicating that Wiley helped the client, Karen Wilkening, go into hiding almost 
20 months ago, said the spokesman, Steve Casey. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkening failed to appear for the second day of her preliminary hearing in 
Superior Court in September, 1987, on charges that she ran a prostitution ring 
out of her Linda Vista condominium. Wilkening, who has been charged with 28 
counts of pimping and pandering, has since been taken into custody, Casey said, 
but he would give no details about the arrest or where she was being detained. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arraignment Rescheduled 
</P>
<P>
Wiley was being held in the County Jail downtown. His arraignment was postponed 
Tuesday afternoon by Municipal Judge Lillian Lim Quon because the district 
attorney's office had not filed formal charges. The arraignment was rescheduled 
for today. 
</P>
<P>
Casey said he expects that Wiley will be charged with conspiracy to obstruct 
justice, impersonation and accessory to a felony. 
</P>
<P>
Michael L. Lipman, a San Diego lawyer who was present at Municipal Court on 
Tuesday and said he might represent Wiley, said he could not respond to the 
allegations until charges were filed. 
</P>
<P>
Casey said Wiley was arrested by officers from the San Diego Metropolitan 
Homicide Task Force after the group received information that Wiley allegedly 
helped in Wilkening's flight. The task force has been investigating a series of 
murders involving suspected prostitutes in the San Diego area. But Casey said 
Wiley is not under investigation in connection with any of the murders. 
</P>
<P>
As part of its investigation of Wiley, Casey said, the task force conducted 
searches Monday and Tuesday of his home and office and the offices of car 
dealer Tony McCune in National City, among other sites. Casey would not say why 
McCune's offices were searched. A woman who answered the telephone at McCune's 
office Tuesday afternoon said McCune was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Wiley has been involved in other publicized cases, such as the successful 
defense of Ray Ortiz, former registrar of voters in San Diego County. Wiley 
represented a co-defendant of Ortiz, Lance Gough, an Escondido elections 
consultant who was acquitted on a theft charge.

HOSPITAL IS SUED OVER ALLEGED RAPE OF GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE WOLF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The family of a comatose 11-year-old girl who was allegedly raped by a nurse's 
aide at a San Diego convalescent hospital has filed suit against the facility 
for negligence and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed in San Diego Superior Court on April 28, alleges that LEIR 
Institutes Inc. and Alvarado Convalescent and Rehabilitation Hospital did not 
adequately staff the facility, or properly supervise their employees, thereby 
setting the stage for the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, the girl was admitted as a patient at the Lake Erie Institute of 
Rehabilitation, a "state-of-the-art" long-term care facility for people with 
traumatic head injuries, which occupies a wing of the hospital on Alvarado 
Road. She had been in a semi-coma since being thrown from a car during an 
accident two months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The girl was allegedly raped on Christmas Eve, and a 22-year-old nursing 
assistant, Noel A. Sanchez, was later arrested and charged with the crime. 
Sanchez, a Clairemont resident, is currently being held in County Jail awaiting 
trial June 9 on charges of forcible rape and child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focus of Suit 
</P>
<P>
Though Sanchez is named as a defendant in the lawsuit, the focus of the suit is 
primarily against the hospital, said attorney John J. McAvoy. "Whether or not 
Mr. Sanchez is guilty, . . . it was the atmosphere at (the hospital) that 
allowed it to happen," McAvoy said. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit alleges that hospital employees noticed the girl was bleeding early 
Christmas morning but did not report it to a doctor until Dec. 29. An 
examination showed the girl had a four-inch tear in her vagina and had lost 
about one-seventh of her blood, according to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit further maintains that the hospital knew that the LEIR unit was 
understaffed and poorly supervised, but that it was more concerned with turning 
a profit than ensuring patients' safety. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Richard Barton, who represents LEIR, said he had not yet seen the 
lawsuit and declined comment on the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
The girl is now living with her mother in Riverside County. Her condition has 
improved since December, but she is still not fully conscious, McAvoy said. "We 
are not making any suggestion that her (coma) is a result of this rape, but the 
fact that she had this subsequent life-threatening trauma hasn't helped her 
any," McAvoy said. "I have had doctors tell me that the environment in which 
you place a semi-comatose child like this has a great deal to do with if she 
ever makes a full recovery." 
</P>
<P>
In January, Alvarado Convalescent Hospital was cited for a safety violation and 
fined $30,000 by the the state Health Services Department for failure to 
adequately diagnose the girl's injury, treat the wound or notify a doctor. The 
fine was reduced to $15,000 because the hospital did not contest the citation 
and promptly paid the state fine. 
</P>
<P>
Hillhaven West Inc., the operator of Alvarado Convalescent Hospital, was cited 
three times in 1988 for dangerous and/or unsafe nursing care. However, no 
action has been taken to revoke or suspend the hospital's license, state Health 
Service Department spokesman Ernie Trujillo said Tuesday.

<P>
A man suspected in 15 bank robberies in San Diego County was arrested Monday 
after he tried to rob an Orange County bank, San Diego police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Raymond Martin, 22, of La Mesa, allegedly tried to rob a Tustin bank 
Monday, but was arrested after a plainclothes detective followed him, said Bill 
Robinson, a San Diego police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Police have dubbed the robberies the "kangaroo bank robbery series" because the 
robber put the money in a pouch-like zippered bag at his waist, Robinson said. 
The robberies were committed between Jan. 27 and April 25, in areas from 
Coronado to Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
Martin also is suspected of committing four Los Angeles robberies, Robinson 
said.

The Palestine Liberation Organization, stepping up its campaign for 
international recognition of Palestine as a state, applied to join UNESCO and 
said it will ask to join two other U.N. bodies. The request follows the PLO's 
controversial bid to join the World Health Organization, which sparked U.S. 
threats to cut off its substantial contributions if the PLO succeeds in 
joining. Omar Massalha, PLO observer at the Paris-based U.N. Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization, said Arab states are studying ways to 
compensate for the U.S. threat. The PLO also plans to apply for membership in 
the Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome and the International Labor 
Organization in Geneva.

Millionaire businessman P.J. Morgan won the mayoral race in Omaha, ending a 
political comeback bid by former Mayor Mike Boyle. With only absentee ballots 
remaining to be counted, Morgan had 56,774 votes, or 53.35%, while Boyle 
received 48,115 votes, or 45.21%. Boyle, who was recalled from his second term 
as mayor two years ago amid allegations he abused his executive power, said 
during the campaign that he was a changed man. He contends the recall was 
prompted by his controversial management style, something he says has changed. 
He said during the campaign that he is a recovering alcoholic and has not had a

The American cultural center in Kwangju, South Korea, target of nearly 30 
anti-American attacks since 1980, will be closed and moved, the U.S. Embassy in 
Seoul announced. "We're concerned about the threat to human life, especially in 
that building . . . . It's not sufficiently defensible," an embassy spokesman 
said. The spokesman said that Washington and South Korea are negotiating on 
where it will be relocated. The decision to move was announced nine days before 
the anniversary of a civilian uprising in Kwangju on May 18, 1980, that was 
suppressed by then-President Chun Doo Hwan. About 200 people were killed in 
that incident, by official count, but residents say many more died.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POSSIBLE TAMPERING WITH WINE PROBED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Investigators were trying to determine this week whether a bottle of wine 
purchased at a City of Industry supermarket had been tampered with. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemarie Ramirez, 51, of Hacienda Heights told investigators that the thin 
metal covering over the bottle's cork appeared to have been tampered with but 
that she drank from the bottle because the cork seemed intact, Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Deputy Roger Hom said. 
</P>
<P>
After consuming some of the wine, she complained of a burning sensation in her 
throat and became extremely nauseated. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics found nothing wrong with Ramirez, but her husband took her to 
Whittier Hospital Medical Center, where she was treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
The woman bought the bottle of Ernest &amp; Julio Gallo Blush Chablis at a Vons 
supermarket at 32221 Hacienda Blvd. on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The store pulled all remaining bottles of the wine as a precaution.

MAYOR URGES STAFF TO TAKE DRUG TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CURT HOLBREICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As way to show that the mayor's office is serious about fighting drug abuse, 
political appointees on Mayor Maureen O'Connor's staff have been asked to join 
a voluntary drug-testing program in which the mayor will also participate, her 
office announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor will submit to a drug test when she returns from a European vacation 
in about two weeks, said Paul Downey, the mayor's spokesman. Most of the other 
28 eligible employees took the urine test last week and results are expected 
shortly, Downey said. 
</P>
<P>
Downey said the samples will be tested for the presence of cocaine, marijuana, 
amphetamines and several other illicit drugs. He said he did not know if the 
test would include alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Results of the tests will not be made public and only Ben Dillingham, the 
mayor's chief of staff, and the employee will be told the result, Downey said. 
Dillingham also will be in charge of any possible disciplinary action should 
someone test positive, Downey said. Downey said no action will be taken against 
anyone who declined to participate in the program. 
</P>
<P>
Downey said the program was based on a belief by the mayor that "public 
officials should be held to some higher standard" and was not the result of a 
concern that a drug problem existed on the staff. 
</P>
<P>
Downey, who said he submitted to a drug test last week, said the staff and 
mayor felt that the program would "set an example to the community that this 
mayor and her staff are serious about the problem of drug abuse." But Downey 
added that the mayor and her staff were not advocating that other city 
departments start similar testing programs. 
</P>
<P>
The city already has a policy that allows supervisors to order urine tests of 
city workers who are suspected of using illicit drugs. That policy, however, 
does not apply to workers on the mayor's staff.

VENTURA BOULEVARD PANEL DIVIDED OVER GRIDLOCK PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of a citizens committee searching for ways to prevent gridlock on 
Ventura Boulevard are wrapping up a 2 1/2-year study the way they started it: 
squabbling among themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners and businessmen on the 20-member panel are about a month away from 
finishing their work and issuing recommendations that would propose that future 
growth along the 17-mile boulevard be tied to traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Committee members are considering suggesting that new construction be severely 
limited in areas such as Encino, where there already are frequent traffic jams. 
They are studying use of a "trip equation" as a way of forecasting how future 
development would add to existing congestion. The equation would determine 
traffic volume on the basis of the size of new buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's preliminary proposal envisions that the boulevard can handle an 
additional 8.6 million square feet of commercial development and 30,000 more 
car trips a day by the year 2010. There are now about 19 million square feet of 
commercial development and about 70,000 daily trips on the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
According to the latest draft of the preliminary plan, developers along the 
thoroughfare should be required to pay a fee based on the estimated number of 
daily trips that their projects would generate. That money would be used for 
future traffic improvements on the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
But the homeowners and business representatives on the Los Angeles City 
Council-appointed committee are at odds over exactly how the calculations 
should be made, how much growth should be allowed and how much money should be 
collected. 
</P>
<P>
Their rift surfaced Tuesday when both sides responded to a newspaper report 
that erroneously announced that the Planning Commission was meeting to consider 
the boulevard plan. 
</P>
<P>
The report prepared for the meeting prompted fears by homeowners that 
businessmen, who form the majority on the panel, were bypassing final committee 
debate by taking the preliminary plan straight to the commission. The 
homeowners hurriedly prepared a "minority report" that called for an overall 
tightening of the recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel some adjustments will make it more functional, realistically 
creative," the dissidents wrote. Tougher requirements would "delay potential 
traffic gridlock and be more acceptable to residents and users of Ventura 
Boulevard," they concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Said Louise Frankel, a Tarzana homeowner representative who joined residential 
committee members from Encino, Sherman Oaks and Woodland Hills in signing the 
minority report: "If you'd been sitting with us two years listening to this, 
you'd have trepidations too." 
</P>
<P>
The committee's majority members suggested that their upcoming proposal is 
plenty creative, however. In fact, said panel member Nick Brestoff, a Woodland 
Hills lawyer, the trip equation has the potential to eventually be used 
throughout the city to tame growth and traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
But planning commissioners refused to listen to either side's arguments. They 
said the matter was before them Tuesday only as one of several generalized 
status reports on long-range Planning Department projects. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Platkin, a planning staff member who is working with the committee on 
the study, said additional panel meetings will be scheduled when a revised 
preliminary draft of the group's recommendations can be prepared. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides apparently will have plenty to debate when they meet again. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners want all new buildings along the boulevard between Cahuenga 
Boulevard in Studio City to Shoup Avenue in Woodland Hills restricted to two 
stories in height to "preserve the rural and relaxed shopping atmosphere." But 
the business representatives favor heights ranging from two stories in 
congested areas to six floors in lightly developed Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Minority members want the number of trips that the boulevard can absorb by 2010 
to be apportioned among the street's five communities on the basis of a sliding 
scale that is one-third tighter than that suggested by the majority. 
</P>
<P>
The minority wants developers to pay $5,000 for each trip generated daily by 
their projects as determined by that sliding scale. The majority favors a 
$2,000 fee. 
</P>
<P>
The minority wants all existing business owners on the boulevard to be assessed 
a separate fee to help pay for traffic improvements, new parking facilities, 
better landscaping and street cleaning, police foot patrols and graffiti 
removal. The majority does not include such a proposal in its preliminary 
report. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Construction Ban 
</P>
<P>
The minority wants a construction ban within half a mile of the most congested 
intersections. The majority says computerized signals, rush-hour parking bans 
and "traffic improvements for the corridor's critical intersections" would 
allow for "adequate levels of service." 
</P>
<P>
The end-of-the-study acrimony is reminiscent of arguing that occurred when the 
committee began its work in 1987 and quickly became polarized into homeowner 
and business interest camps. 
</P>
<P>
When homeowners initially proposed that bans on parking and daytime deliveries 
be considered for the boulevard and a median fence be installed to prevent 
traffic-snarling U-turns, businessmen reacted by calling for the construction 
of new municipal parking garages on boulevard land now used by city fire 
stations, libraries and electrical distribution stations. None of those ideas 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
Planning Commission President William G. Luddy said the commission will not 
look at the committee's recommendations until its members finally vote to send 
them to City Hall. Public hearings and workshops will precede any commission 
decision on the boulevard plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be very interested to see how this plays itself out," Luddy told the two 
sides.

L.A. LIMITS SIZE OF NEW HOUSES ON SHERMAN OAKS HILLSIDE LOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday approved an ordinance prohibiting the 
construction of big houses on small hillside lots in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
The building restrictions, approved 13 to 0, ban houses that are taller than 30 
feet, and require front and back yards to be at least five feet deep. Also, new 
houses cannot cover more than half of their lots, according to the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky pushed for the measure after a group of hillside 
residents complained that their rustic neighborhood was being overwhelmed by 
construction of disproportionately large houses along Oakfield Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance says the overdevelopment threatens slope stability and increases 
traffic along the area's narrow streets. Also, sewer and utility lines are 
inadequate to support large houses, the ordinance says. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood has long been known as "Stilt Street" for the eye-catching row 
of historic houses built on stilts with a minimum of grading. The homes were 
designed to blend into the scenic canyon area, and residents contend that 
future housing should maintain the architectural integrity of the neighborhood, 
which has been featured in movies. 
</P>
<P>
The regulations were approved by the council without comment and were sent to 
Mayor Tom Bradley for his expected approval. They apply to an area east of 
Beverly Glen Boulevard between Mulholland Drive and Valley Vista Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Effect for Year 
</P>
<P>
Once the ordinance is signed into law, it will be in effect for a year while 
planners and community leaders evaluate whether permanent controls are needed 
to protect the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
It also includes regulations limiting hillside grading and requiring additional 
parking spaces for bigger houses. If developers want exceptions to the rules, 
they must appeal to the Planning Commission.

PANEL BACKS EXTENSION OF SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS AGENCY

The state Senate Natural Resources Committee on Tuesday approved a bill to give 
the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, now scheduled to go out of business in 
July, 1990, a new lease on life. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, by state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), would extend the 
existence of the agency to Dec. 31, 1995. Without discussion, the committee 
approved the bill on a 9-0 vote and sent it to the Senate Appropriations 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal said he was "a little surprised" that the bill sailed through the 
Natural Resources Committee without opposition because critics in previous 
years have questioned the need for the conservancy. He suggested that the 
conservancy now is accepted by lawmakers as a "motherhood" issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the environment and open space concepts have taken on greater 
importance in people's minds," Rosenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters saw the unopposed vote as a hopeful sign for the bill's eventual 
passage. 
</P>
<P>
Since the conservancy was established in 1979, it has purchased or helped pay 
for the acquisition of about 10,000 acres of open space and parkland at a cost 
of about $38 million, according to Joseph T. Edmiston, the conservancy's 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
When the conservancy was created, backers overcame objections that there were 
already sufficient state and local agencies to handle purchases of private 
property in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, the Legislature extended the conservancy's life to July, 1986, but as 
that date approached, prospects for further extension were uncertain because 
Gov. George Deukmejian was not a strong supporter of the agency. In 1985, for 
example, Deukmejian dealt it a setback by vetoing $6 million in the budget for 
the conservancy to buy additional land. Later that year, however, Deukmejian 
signed legislation extending the conservancy to 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The agency has increasingly attracted bipartisan support, with Republicans now 
carrying bills for an agency that was established with heavy Democratic 
backing.

SCHOOL ASSAULTS BILL PASSES 1ST TEST; 
</P>
<P>
ROBBINS MEASURE WOULD STIFFEN PENALTIES, BOOST SECURITY

<P>
Legislation aimed at curbing assaults against school employees, partly prompted 
by an attack on a Sylmar junior high school teacher, cleared its first 
legislative hurdle Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, by state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana), was approved by the state 
Senate Judiciary Committee on a 9-0 vote and sent to the Appropriations 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins' measure would increase prison penalties for attacking a school 
employee by up to three years, boost funding for school security in high-crime 
districts and require schools to inform teachers about students with histories 
of violence. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins said the bill would "force greater attention to the problem" of school 
violence statewide. He said the measure was introduced at the request of United 
Teachers-Los Angeles after a 15-year-old Pacoima youth stabbed a teacher in the 
back during an Olive Vista Junior High School class March 6. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Felony Assault 
</P>
<P>
If the Robbins bill becomes law, a person convicted of a felony assault on a 
teacher could receive the same penalty as a person convicted of assaulting a 
police officer or a firefighter. Killing an on-duty teacher could bring three 
additional years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Wesley Mitchell, chief of the 305-officer Los Angeles Unified School District 
Police Department, said he supports that provision because teachers must 
protect the health and safety of students in the same way that police protect 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
"As a direct result of that effort, they become victims of violent assault," 
Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School District spends about $24 million a year on 
campus security, Mitchell said. Under the bill, a district with a crime rate of 
10% more than the statewide average would be required to spend at least 1.25% 
of its budget on security. Los Angeles would meet the criterion and would have 
to spend about $44 million on security, said Teri Burns, an aide to Robbins. 
The district's total budget is $3.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Definitions Vary 
</P>
<P>
But Ronald Prescott, a lobbyist for the Los Angeles schools, said there is a 
difference of opinion over crime statistics because California school districts 
define assaults differently. Prescott, who said he supports the concept behind 
the Robbins bill, added that he hopes to iron out any statistical disputes as 
the measure proceeds through the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Olive Vista attack, Robbins cited the shooting death of Grant High 
School teacher Hal Arthur on March 24 as another reason for pressing for 
passage of the measure. Arthur, 60, was shot three times in front of his home 
as he prepared to get into his car. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was also supported by Judy Blatz, a school nurse at Cleveland High 
School in Reseda, who said she was forced to retire a year early after her back 
was injured in 1987 when she was assaulted by an intoxicated student. 
</P>
<P>
The measure was opposed by the American Civil Liberties Union. According to a 
state Senate analysis of the bill, the ACLU believes that "crimes should not be 
punished more harshly because they occur in certain settings or places" and 
involve specific groups of people such as teachers. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU also believes that increased sentences "will not deter such crimes and 
will only exacerbate the already overcrowded jails and prisons," according to 
the analysis.

PETITIONS LACK ENOUGH SIGNATURES; 
</P>
<P>
AGOURA HILLS COUNCIL RECALL EFFORT FAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An effort to recall four of the five Agoura Hills City Council members failed 
Tuesday, falling short of the number of petition signatures that were required 
to force a special election. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Kasic, a developer and leader of the recall movement, said the group had 
gathered only 1,934 signatures, well short of the 2,237 valid signatures that 
were required. Tuesday was the deadline that concluded a four-month period in 
which the petitions were circulated. 
</P>
<P>
Targeted for recall were Mayor Darlene McBane, Mayor Pro Tem Vicky Leary and 
council members Fran Pavley and Louise C. Rishoff. The group did not seek to 
oust Councilmember Jack W. Koenig. 
</P>
<P>
Recall proponents blamed the four councilwomen for Los Angeles County's closure 
of Medfield Street in August. They also accused the four of favoring the Old 
Agoura neighborhood over other areas of the city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Videos Shown 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Kasic and recall proponent David Chagall showed videotapes they 
said demonstrated that the four councilwomen and their supporters illegally 
thwarted petition-gathering efforts. The tapes show the councilwomen and 
supporters approaching people and speaking to them outside supermarkets as 
recall proponents tried to get them to sign the petitions, sometimes 
successfully. The group will turn the tapes over to the district attorney's 
office and will ask for prosecution, Kasic said. 
</P>
<P>
Leary said Tuesday that she, Pavley, Rishoff, McBane and supporters went to the 
supermarkets merely to tell their side of the story. Residents had told them 
that recall proponents were trying to mislead people into believing that the 
petitions were about improving traffic, not about recalling the council, Leary 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the recall movement fell short of the required number of 
signatures shows that it lacked substantial support in the community, Leary 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some who circulated the petitions were hired by the recall movement and were 
paid 50 cents to $1 per signature, Kasic said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Movement Criticized 
</P>
<P>
Leary characterized the movement as a developer-backed effort to take control 
of a council that had enacted strict laws on issues such as oak tree removal 
and developer fees to finance new streets. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because I'm a developer, does that make me a criminal?" Kasic asked. 
</P>
<P>
The recall effort was often emotional. In its final weeks, proponents charged 
that council supporters assaulted them. Earlier, Rishoff filed a libel suit 
against Chagall and Carole Dynda, another recall proponent. 
</P>
<P>
Chagall, a free-lance writer, said recall proponents will field candidates in 
the November city election, when the terms of Pavley, McBane and Koenig are set 
to expire. Chagall said the group is unsure whether it will challenge Koenig 
along with the others. John Ellis, an accountant and recall backer, is the only 
announced candidate.

BERNARDI, HALL DISAGREE ON ACTIONS, NOT ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two candidates vying to represent the northeast San Fernando Valley on the 
Los Angeles City Council traded barbs Tuesday night in Arleta during their 
third debate. 
</P>
<P>
But mostly what they proved to the 80-member audience at the Branford Park 
Community Center is they do not differ greatly on solutions to most major 
issues confronting the area. The difference is that while Councilman Ernani 
Bernardi says he already is solving many problems, challenger Lyle Hall says 
Bernardi has not done enough. 
</P>
<P>
During the two-hour debate, sponsored by the Arleta Chamber of Commerce, Hall 
said Bernardi's 28 years on the council represent "a legacy of neglect and 
inattention to the 7th District." 
</P>
<P>
"People are telling me that our communities aren't what they used to be," Hall 
said. "Things have been ignored in our area. We aren't getting our fair share 
of city services." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Johnny-Come-Lately' 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi, who called Hall a "Johnny-come-lately," spent much of the debate 
recounting his accomplishments, ranging from purchasing graffiti sandblasters 
out of his council office budget to pushing for fences around public housing 
projects. He read aloud letters of commendation sent him by city police, from 
Chief Daryl F. Gates on down. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't have a record, you can blame the incumbent for everything," 
Bernardi said. "But then, all you people have is promises." 
</P>
<P>
In the April 11 primary, Bernardi gained 41.5% of the vote, short of the 50% 
plus one vote he needed to win. Hall came in second with 25.7%. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi, 77, lost a large chunk of his loyal district in 1986 as a result of 
redistricting. Hall, 49, is on leave from his job as a Los Angeles city fire 
captain; he was former president of the firefighters union. 
</P>
<P>
While responding to questions posed both by the Chamber of Commerce and 
audience members, Bernardi raised his voice and his fist frequently. Hall 
maintained his composure throughout, often waiving his right to rebut 
Bernardi's statements by saying he agreed with the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
Both candidates received hearty applause for their responses from large 
segments of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
A question from Eugene Hernandez prompted an exchange typical of the evening. 
Hernandez asked Bernardi why he has not appointed more Latinos to city 
commissions and committees. Later, Hernandez said he lives outside the district 
but belongs to Local 535 of the Service Employees International Union and 
supports Hall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mayor Makes Appointments 
</P>
<P>
In response, Bernardi said that under the City Charter, the mayor makes all 
appointments and "I'll tell you the unfortunate reality: Most of them are heavy 
political contributors to the appointer." 
</P>
<P>
Hall agreed with Bernardi's assessment of the charter, but countered by 
pointing out that "the lists of names that the mayor considers are provided by 
the council members." 
</P>
<P>
Several questions about crime, gangs and drugs brought familiar responses from 
both candidates about the need for more police officers. Hall suggested using 
more police reserves to patrol parks and shopping centers, while Bernardi said 
funding should be increased so that police can work overtime rather than having 
to take time off in lieu of overtime pay. 
</P>
<P>
Hall also took a dig at one of Bernardi's endorsements, that of Arleta activist 
and former Chamber of Commerce president Al Dib, who came in third in the 
primary with 11.8% of the vote. Hall read from Dib's primary campaign 
literature, which attacked Bernardi's absentee rate on the council and 
concluded that "since Bernardi did not make the decision to retire himself, 
responsible voters will have to make it for him." 
</P>
<P>
After the debate, Dib denied any knowledge of the campaign mailer, which was 
signed by the California Republican Assembly but paid for by Dib's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Didn't See It' 
</P>
<P>
"My mailings person must have seen it, but I didn't see it until it came out," 
Dib said. "This was not put out by me." 
</P>
<P>
Dib endorsed Bernardi in mid-April, saying Bernardi's decision to make this his 
last term meant that he would "not owe developers and special interest groups 
anything." He said Hall has "cold and icy" eyes and no track record in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
However, some political observers have speculated that Dib, along with those 
Latino activists who have endorsed Bernardi, are counting that Bernardi's 
departure will offer them a better shot at the seat in 1993 than they would 
have if Hall were to win. 
</P>
<P>
So far, no other debates are scheduled before the June 6 election.

<TEXT>
<P>
A North Hollywood woman who shot and killed her cousin's boyfriend during a 
domestic dispute has been sentenced to five years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Marroquin Galindo, 35, was sentenced Monday by San Fernando Superior 
Court Judge Meredith C. Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Galindo pleaded guilty last month to voluntary manslaughter in the Oct. 2 
shooting death of Salvador Rene Roldan, 20, Deputy Dist. Atty. Susan Bilus 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, who lived in the same North Hollywood apartment as Galindo, had 
intervened in a dispute between Galindo and her common-law husband when he was 
shot once in the chest with a .25-caliber handgun, Bilus said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ACCIDENT CAUSES POWER OUTAGE IN STUDIO CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A minor car accident in Studio City triggered a power outage that left 4,000 
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power customers without electricity, some 
for as long as five hours, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The outage occurred at 11:20 p.m. Monday when a car hit a utility pole on 
Laurel Canyon Boulevard at Berry Drive, DWP spokeswoman Dorothy Jensen said. 
The utility pole snapped near the top, bringing down electrical wires and a 
transformer, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
That set off a chain-reaction of stress on the local power system, knocking out 
three circuits that feed electricity to the area, Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
Primarily, homes and businesses in the area between Mulholland Drive and the 
Ventura Freeway were affected. Power was restored to customers throughout the 
night, with the last part of the outage ending shortly after 4 a.m. Tuesday, 
Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, whose name was unavailable, suffered only minor injuries, officials 
said.

A U.S. Navy serviceman was arrested in the stabbing death of a North Hollywood 
woman after he turned himself in at the Mexican border Tuesday, Los Angeles 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Ron LaRue said police were called to an apartment in the 10800 block of 
Kling Street at 11:15 p.m. Monday and found Alyson Eve Billard, 25, dead of 
multiple stab wounds. The woman's two roommates found the body. 
</P>
<P>
LaRue said detectives were beginning the investigation when they were contacted 
at 1 a.m. Tuesday by U. S. Customs agents from the border crossing at San 
Ysidro and told that Hugo R. Wiegand had surrendered in connection with 
Billard's death. 
</P>
<P>
Weigand, 20, was believed to be absent without leave but the location of his 
Navy base had not been determined. Officials did not know his rank. He had been 
staying for about two weeks with his brother, who was one of the victim's 
roommates, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was going to go into Mexico but decided instead to turn himself in," LaRue 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles detectives drove to San Ysidro and returned with Wiegand, who was 
arrested on suspicion of murder and was being held without bail in the North 
Hollywood station jail. 
</P>
<P>
LaRue said detectives had not learned the motive for the stabbing.

WESTWOOD ONE GAINS GROUND IN SKIRMISH OVER 'PIRATE RADIO' TAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Westwood One, the owner of KQLZ-FM, which has dubbed itself "Pirate Radio 
100.3," has won a round in its battle to keep piracy off the air waves. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Westwood One recently sent letters to several radio stations 
asking that they refrain from using the slogan pirate radio, which they say was 
coined by KQLZ program director and morning deejay Scott Shannon. 
</P>
<P>
Four stations that used the term pirate when identifying their stations have 
responded by discontinuing use of the moniker, said Westwood One spokeswoman 
Katie Garber. 
</P>
<P>
Jacor Communications Inc., which owns WEBN-FM in Cincinnati, WYHY-FM in 
Nashville and WFLZ-FM in Tampa, agreed to drop the slogan as of Friday. WHTQ-FM 
in Orlando has also agreed to stop all its references to "Rock 'n' Roll 
Pirates." 
</P>
<P>
WIOQ-FM based in Philadelphia also received a letter from KQLZ asking it to 
stop using pirate radio, but the station is continuing to use the name and does 
not intend to stop, according to program director Mark Driscoll, who said that 
no one owns the term pirate. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, radio moniker wars continue locally with KFI still trying to 
determine under what circumstances it can call itself "talk radio." 
</P>
<P>
Last week U.S. District Court Judge Richard A. Gadbois issued a preliminary 
injunction pending the outcome of a trial, stopping the radio station from 
using the slogan in conjunction with its call letters. The judge ruled that 
until the suit is decided later this year the label belongs to KABC, which has 
used the term for 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
"KFI . . . shall be enjoined pending trial from "using the phrase 'KFI Talk 
Radio' 'Talk Radio KFI' or any confusingly similar phrase as KFI's trade name 
station slogan," Gadbois said in his ruling. 
</P>
<P>
KFI filed a motion for clarification Tuesday asking that the judge remove the 
language "or any confusingly similar phrase" because of its lack of clarity.

COUNCIL BACKS MALL IN AREA OF HISTORIC HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK CLIFFORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday gave preliminary approval to a plan to 
build a government subsidized shopping center in an enclave of historic homes 
near USC, a subject of bitter wrangling for two years. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, contains 
one of the city's most impressive stands of Craftsman-style bungalows and late 
19th-Century Victorian houses. It also is a depressed area where unemployment 
is twice as high as the citywide average and where the median income is nearly 
30% lower than the countywide average, according to official reports. 
</P>
<P>
At one time, the proposed shopping center threatened to displace at least 20 
homes and dramatically alter the character of the neighborhood. The plan 
approved by the City Council would require the removal of seven to nine homes. 
It would allow the Community Redevelopment Agency to choose the developer of 
the shopping center and underwrite some of the costs of building it. 
</P>
<P>
The project has been heavily lobbied for by developer Danny Bakewell and the 
Boys Market grocery chain. 
</P>
<P>
The council's unanimous vote for the shopping center in the North University 
Park area followed a series of acrimonious public hearings and 
behind-the-scenes-negotiations between City Councilman Robert Farrell, who 
represents the area, and homeowner representatives. The two sides appeared to 
have reached an accord before Tuesday's vote. When it was over, however, some 
people argued that Farrell had not lived up to his end of the bargain. 
</P>
<P>
The size of the shopping center, the fate of at least two architecturally 
significant houses, and the neighborhood's say-so over the design of the center 
all were matters discussed with Farrell. Representatives of the West Adams 
Heritage Assn., the principal group negotiating with Farrell, wanted those 
issues resolved in their favor in return for dropping their resistance to the 
shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
They had hoped the council would incorporate their desires into the action, but 
that did not happen. Instead, the council's vote leaves many details relating 
to the scope of the project and neighborhood control over its design to future 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"What we want is a center that balances commercial and residential needs," said 
David Raposa, vice president of the West Adams Heritage Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Another group, Friends of Menlo Avenue, remains opposed to the project because 
it could commit as much as $3 million in public funds, administered by the CRA, 
to a private project that should pay for itself. That view reflects a growing 
criticism of the CRA that it, operating at the behest of the mayor and various 
council members, is bankrolling deals that have more political than public 
value. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell was jubilant after Tuesday's council vote, describing it as a "win-win 
situation" and commending the West Adams Heritage Assn. for cooperating with 
him and saying they have nothing to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted a more explicit commitment, but I think if they had more 
experience with the processes at City Hall they would have understood that they 
weren't being denied anything by what happened today," Farrell said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was committed to meeting their desire for a design review committee. 
</P>
<P>
"If a guy gives his word to you, if he says you're going to have something, 
you're going to have it," Farrell said.

HEALTH CUTBACKS OF $55.7 MILLION PROPOSED IF STATE AID FALLS SHORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR MERINA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dozens of pediatric facilities, outpatient health centers and family planning 
clinics would be closed as a result of $55.7 million in cuts proposed Tuesday 
by Los Angeles County health officials to offset anticipated losses in state 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts would be made only if state funds cannot be found to bail out the 
health care programs, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In recommendations to the Board of Supervisors, the Department of Health 
Services proposed $25 million in reductions at County-USC Medical Center, $6.6 
million at Olive View Medical Center and reductions totaling $10.1 million at 
Harbor/UCLA Medical Center and Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, health officials recommended slashing $4.9 million from family 
planning, $3.6 million from comprehensive health centers, $4.1 million from 
other health clinics and $1.4 million from other services. 
</P>
<P>
In his report to the board, Health Director Robert Gates traced the budget 
problems to a proposal by Gov. George Deukmejian cutting the county's current 
allocation for medically indigent patients from $204.2 million to $56.2 
million. Although some of that revenue will be made up from other state 
sources, Gates said that total is expected to fall far short of what the county 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
"In considering the necessity for service reductions totaling $55.7 million, it 
must be recognized that (the department) will still be left with a remaining 
operating budget sufficient to meet only minimally acceptable levels of health 
care practice," he told the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Gates recommended: 
</P>
<P>
* Closure of pediatric facilities and a reduction of general health services at 
the County-USC Medical Center and Women's Hospital. As a result, all 
non-communicable disease and emergency room services at the Pediatric Pavilion 
would be eliminated and other services cut after Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
* Reduction of outpatient clinic services at Harbor/UCLA Medical Center. These 
program cuts would affect 2,774 patients a month and would begin July 1, health 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
* Elimination of acute outpatient care at Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center in 
Downey. Nearly 1,800 people a month now use the services, and the change would 
mean patients would be forced to rely on other county facilities and other 
health providers after Sept. 1, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
* Drastic cuts in services at public health centers throughout the county. 
Current patients, many of whom are low-income minorities, now rely on such 
centers for immunizations, prenatal care, pediatric services and AIDS testing. 
Under the planned cuts, more than 24,600 people would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
"To the extent we can, we've tried to focus on elective kinds of health 
services, although we provide very little truly elective services," Gates told 
The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"We desperately need an infusion of money, hard money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors set a June 12 public hearing date to comply with the Bielenson 
Act. That state law requires supervisors to hold a public hearing to assess the 
impact of the proposed health care cuts on the county's poor. Gates said that 
$36.2 million of the planned $55.7 million in proposed cuts would fall under 
the Bielenson statute. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think health services should be cut, and hopefully, we won't have to 
cut," said board Chairman Ed Edelman. "But if we can't get the state to help 
us, this gives us one of the options."

<P>
A toddler was hit Tuesday by shattered glass when a reputed gang member fired 
gunshots into a car driven by the child's mother, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-year-old child suffered minor cuts and was taken to Martin Luther King 
Jr./Drew Medical Center following the shooting at 1:45 p.m. in South-Central 
Los Angeles, Police Sgt. Larry Manchester said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspected gang member walked up to the car as it was stopped at Century 
Boulevard and Compton Avenue and fired at the car, Manchester said. 
</P>
<P>
The mother and her child were not hit by the bullets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was done without provocation," Manchester said of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Officers searched the area for the gunman, who was known only by a common 
street gang name.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to increase the number of blacks entering science and engineering 
fields, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Caltech signed agreements Tuesday for 
a joint academic program with seven historically black colleges and 
universities in the South. 
</P>
<P>
"The black colleges and universities have a great resource we have not been 
tapping," said Martin Leipold, manager of the program for JPL. He said the 
Pasadena area lab will offer summer research jobs to the students, and JPL 
scientists and Caltech professors will lecture at the schools. 
</P>
<P>
The agreements are with Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse College, the 
Morehouse School of Medicine, Spelman College and Morris Brown College, all in 
Georgia, as well as Jackson State University in Mississippi and Tuskegee 
University in Alabama. JPL, a center for outer space exploration, is run by 
Caltech for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

TICKET WRITERS WARY OF ASBESTOS IN BUILDING 
</P>

<P>
Concerns over asbestos in the Hollywood headquarters of Los Angeles' parking 
enforcement division resulted in a brief work stoppage Tuesday morning as 
officers and management debated whether to take roll call indoors or outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
After a two-hour standstill, supervisors agreed to take roll call outdoors and 
sent the 6:30 a.m. shift of 17 parking officers on their morning rounds of 
ticket writing. Pay was not docked, said Kaye Beechum, the city's parking 
enforcement manager. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors and city occupational safety officials maintain that the building 
at 6601 W. Santa Monica Boulevard is safe to occupy despite the discovery of 
asbestos hazards in the basement and a ground-floor room of the building last 
September. 
</P>
<P>
"Officers just got fed up," said one parking enforcement officer who declined 
to give his name. "We're willing to work. We just don't want to go inside the 
building." 
</P>
<P>
City supervisors in the Hollywood headquarters had tried to persuade the 
morning officers to come indoors since the dispute over roll call arose last 
Thursday. Management resorted to direct orders Tuesday "because the building is 
safe," Beechum said. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors intend to take roll call inside the building today, Beechum said. 
Management is hopeful that another round of tests for asbestos fiber in the air 
will persuade officers that the hazard, if any, is limited to the basement and 
ground-floor room. Those rooms are now off-limits, posted with signs that read 
"Danger" and note the risk of cancer and lung disease from asbestos fibers. 
</P>
<P>
"When people see a sign like this, they tend to get nervous," said Kenneth P. 
Sobel, chief of the city's occupational safety office. 
</P>
<P>
Sobel and an inspector installed two air sampling pumps in the building Tuesday 
morning to repeat earlier tests that he said had found no asbestos fibers in 
the building's air, including the rooms posted as off-limits. Those rooms were 
declared off-limits to avoid the possibility of a disturbance that might cause 
asbestos dust, Sobel said.

BOY'S FATHER WINS $5.7-MILLION SUIT IN KIDNAP DEATH

Nine years ago, soon after his son was found dead in the garage of a neighbor's 
home, Ronald Tolleson felt West Covina police were partly to blame. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a Pomona Superior Court jury agreed, awarding Tolleson a 
$5.7-million judgment against the city, Police Chief Craig Meacham and former 
Officer Larry J. Todd. 
</P>
<P>
In ruling against the city, the jury that heard the wrongful death lawsuit 
found that a "special relationship" existed between the Tolleson family and the 
Police Department, which did not live up to its responsibility to do everything 
possible to ensure Ronnie's Tolleson's safety. 
</P>
<P>
Tolleson said the trial was an ordeal, but that he was gratified with the 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that they were negligent and I hope that the next time a little boy is 
captured . . . police do a better job," he said. "If you don't have the 
expertise to handle a case, you go and get it from somewhere else, especially 
when a child's life is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
"They owed it to me and my son." 
</P>
<P>
Ronnie, 10, was found strangled in the garage of neighbor Danny Jerome Young 
eight days after he was abducted from his home on Patty Court in March, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Officers conducted a partial search of Young's residence the night of the 
disappearance, but found no trace of the boy. 
</P>
<P>
Young, who was on parole from the California Youth Authority, became the main 
suspect and was eventually convicted of second-degree murder and kidnaping for 
ransom. 
</P>
<P>
The exact time of the boy's death became central in the trial of the lawsuit, 
with Tolleson's attorneys maintaining that a more thorough and competent 
investigation -- including a detailed search of the home Young shared with his 
family -- may have saved the boy. 
</P>
<P>
Medical examiners testified that Ronnie was alive for several days after his 
abduction. And a retired police lieutenant, William Flynn, testified that 
Meacham rejected a request to conduct a thorough search of Young's residence. 
</P>
<P>
Tolleson's attorneys, Peter M. Wucetich and Charles C. Simon, also argued that 
inexperienced officers botched the investigation, allowing a potential suspect 
to escape from a ransom drop that police had under surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas J. Feeley, the city's attorney, argued that Young's own testimony 
established that Ronnie was dead before police were contacted. Young, who is 
serving life in prison without possibility of parole, testified on the city's 
behalf, saying that he killed Ronnie immediately after kidnaping him. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors said they believed that police, and particularly Meacham, negligently 
pursued the investigation, which they were ill-equipped to handle without 
outside help. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't have their act together," said juror Brian Fulkerson, who added 
that most of the blame rests on Meacham. "He was in charge and didn't exercise 
the right authority." 
</P>
<P>
Juror Minnie Crane called Meacham's handling of the case "incompetent," saying 
that the chief, the only member of the department with kidnap investigation 
experience, did not have the "abilities and credentials" to handle the case. 
</P>
<P>
Meacham said the jury misapplied the legal aspect of "special relationship," 
but said he accepted full responsibility for the conduct of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"The adage 'the buck stops here,' applied in this situation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The state Supreme Court has held that a "special relationship" occurs when a 
public entity voluntarily takes responsibility for an individual's well-being. 
During the trial Tolleson testified that police officers assured him that they 
would return his son safely. 
</P>
<P>
Meacham said the city may appeal, noting that the reputation of the department 
has suffered. He said he believes police could do nothing to save the boy. 
</P>
<P>
The city may forgo an appeal, Wucetich theorized, because a loss at the 
appellate level would establish precedent concerning police liability. While 
the current verdict "sends a message" to municipalities and police, no binding 
precedent was set, the lawyer said.

WOULD SHARE 21-STORY BUILDING WITH CONDOS, STORES, OFFICES; 
</P>
<P>
ART MUSEUM IN MIRACLE MILE TOWER PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A plan for a 21-story, multi-use building on the Miracle Mile that would house 
the Craft and Folk Art Museum -- along with 66 condominiums, some retail stores 
and business offices -- was announced Tuesday by museum officials. 
</P>
<P>
The idea, according to Paul Stern, an executive vice president of Ratkovich 
Co., the development firm that proposes to build the 231,000-square-foot tower, 
is to include revenue-producing tenants as "an economic engine" to drive the 
entire project. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the concept, unique in Los Angeles, has already been employed 
successfully by the American Craft Museum in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best way for us to get a new home at a price we can afford," Frank 
S. Wyle, chairman of Wyle Laboratories and a board member of the museum, told a 
gathering on the museum property to announce the plan. 
</P>
<P>
He said the museum, which has about 8,000 square feet of space, is "literally 
bursting at the seams." 
</P>
<P>
Museum Director Patrick Ela said more than $5.6 million of the $12 million 
needed for construction and endowment of the new museum structure has been 
pledged by the Ahmanson Foundation, Fieldstead &amp; Co., the J. Paul Getty 
Trust, the Fletcher Jones Foundation, the federal government's National 
Endowment for the Arts and the Ratkovich Co. 
</P>
<P>
Stern said that in addition to getting the remainder of the money needed for 
the project, museum officials would have to obtain changes in zoning or win 
zoning variances to build the multipurpose structure in the Wilshire District. 
</P>
<P>
Museum officials expressed optimism that both these goals can be achieved, 
saying the project has the support of the local residential and business 
community. Mayor Tom Bradley, who attended Tuesday's ceremonies, said he 
supported the mixed-use concept, congratulating the museum's leaders for their 
"bold and creative ideas." 
</P>
<P>
While final plans for the building have yet to be drawn, the basic concept of 
the structure has been decided, Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
The new building would be erected on about an acre of land at Wilshire 
Boulevard and Curson Avenue that is occupied by parking lots, the museum and 
several business and residential structures. 
</P>
<P>
The museum would occupy about 55,000 square feet on several of the lower floors 
of the building. In addition to about 15,000 square feet of exhibition space, 
the museum would include an education department, library, storage and 
conservation area and a theater. 
</P>
<P>
Retail shops would be on the ground floors to draw on the traffic along 
Wilshire, with business offices on the floors immediately above. These 
commercial tenants would occupy about 30,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
The condominiums would occupy about 130,000 square feet on the upper floors of 
the building, with the remainder of the space devoted to parking and building 
services. 
</P>
<P>
The Craft and Folk Arts Museum is a nonprofit organization that evolved in 1973 
from a gallery and restaurant called The Egg and Eye. The restaurant is still 
on the museum property, providing an important source of operating revenue.

PROGRESS AMID GROWING NEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The largest comprehensive AIDS service center in the nation will be dedicated 
Thursday by AIDS Project Los Angeles. It marks an impressive step in meeting 
current needs in the pandemic of the human immune deficiency virus (HIV), but 
it also serves as a stark reminder of how much more must be done to meet future 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
The Nancy Cole Sawaya Center is at 6721 Romaine St., near the intersection of 
Highland and Santa Monica, near the epicenter of the epidemic. It brings 
together under one roof and in 40,000 square feet of operating space all of the 
services of APLA with two exceptions: The dental clinic will remain at West 
Hollywood Park, and Our House, in the Pico-Union District, will continue as a 
separate residential facility. Among the services available at the Sawaya 
Center are case management, transportation to help clients to medical 
appointments, insurance counseling, food and clothing supplies, mental-health 
services, including special help in dealing with sexual compulsions and 
substance abuse, group therapy and professional training to help health-care 
providers protect themselves from AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the most effective programs of APLA, the telephone hot line and the 
buddy program, also are operating from the new facility. They demonstrate the 
crucial role that volunteers can play in providing critical services. About 300 
AIDS patients now have volunteer buddies to give them support, and about 200 
volunteers staff the hot line, (800) 922-AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
But the fine new APLA facilities and the agency's effective program of services 
mask serious problems. Even in San Francisco, which established national norms 
for effective and affordable AIDS care, community-based programs are imperiled 
by the exhaustion of federal service demonstration project funding and by the 
budget paralysis created in Sacramento by Gov. George Deukmejian's proposals to 
cut funds for the medically indigent. Federal and state funding are not keeping 
up with demand. And, to make matters worse, private donations have leveled off. 
And so has the supply of volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
APLA is a microcosm of the national crisis in AIDS services. The agency has 
just emerged from a radical reorganization; it was forced to trim three dozen 
people from the professional staff as programs outgrew support. With a vigorous 
and experienced new chief executive officer, Stephen Bennett, and with better 
focused and somewhat reduced goals, it is making a fresh start. With a paid 
staff of 100 and 1,500 volunteers, it has a client load of 1,900, or more than 
half the AIDS-diagnosed people of the county. But its $8.1-million budget is by 
no means assured because of the uncertainty of government funding, which covers 
30% of the budget, and fluctuations in voluntary contributions. 
</P>
<P>
"With donor dollars, we can create models and create solutions, models for 
government support," Bennett said the other day. "But, long term, the funding 
has to be federal." 
</P>
<P>
Even within APLA, however, progress is coming slowly. Our House, the 
residential facility serving AIDS and ARC patients who also have psychological 
or substance abuse problems, is operating at its capacity of 14, with a waiting 
list of 17. The buddy program needs 80 additional volunteers to eliminate a 
waiting list. Most volunteers are drawn from the gay community, but one of the 
most effective buddies is a housewife with teen-age children of her own, now 
working with her fourth "buddy." The hot line, which processes as many as 5,000 
calls a month, 75% of them from heterosexual persons, also needs additional 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
The dedication will be the occasion for satisfaction, and also for reflection. 
There are signs of a diminished public response to the disease, and of a 
reduced concern in government, at the very moment when preparations for the 
increasing caseload of the next few years are of special importance. Programs 
are weakest among blacks, Latinos and intravenous drug users, the very 
populations where the risk of rapid spread is greatest. There is, in effect, a 
nagging doubt that there will be a continuation of the kind of generous 
financial and participatory support given APLA by Nancy Cole Sawaya, for whom 
the center is named. She will be represented by her husband at the dedication. 
She died in 1986 of an AIDS-related illness.

BUSH VISIT TO DRUG SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Bush Takes Anti-Drug Effort to Smuggling Site," Part I, April 
26: 
</P>
<P>
President Bush stated there was a need for entertainment industry figures to 
become more involved in drug fighting. Once the drugs are on the streets, there 
is nothing the entertainment industry, local police departments or anyone else 
can do to eliminate it. Action must start and take place at the top, and the 
top is the White House. 
</P>
<P>
If our President is not willing to take action against countries trafficking 
drugs into this country, what action is he expecting the local community to 
take? 
</P>
<P>
Action starts with the change of command; stop putting on a front and take 
action by whatever means necessary.

Congratulations on your editorial -- you hit the nail on the head. With so many

BUSH VISIT TO DRUG SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He fell for it. There, on the evening news, President Bush standing before 
reporters and public in Orange County; behind him to the left a tall pyramid of 
those bags of white drugs we've all become so numb to seeing on television 
(there seems to be a competition among law enforcement groups on constructing 
the most impressive stack). Next to him on the right an equally tall pile of 
bundled U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
At a glance the image looks like a large balance scale with the President as 
its center. 
</P>
<P>
And the message this scene relays to too many viewers, especially those most 
impressionable: Drugs equal money. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure neither the President nor his PR adviser intended that it come across 
this way. They take the news media approach of using U.S. dollars as a measure 
for quantities of confiscated illegal drugs (as was the currency displayed). 
</P>
<P>
Rarely, if ever, is a news story written where a "street value" figure is not 
attached to a quantity of drugs seized in a drug bust, often in headlines or 
evening news teasers. The wise reporter appreciates the sensational value of 
that figure; the naive believes it to be quantitative. 
</P>
<P>
But using a "dollar-value" figure in discussing illegal drugs is much too 
subjective. To me and, I hope, to a majority of citizens, the value, dollar or 
otherwise, of one ounce or one ton of marijuana, crack, coke, heroine is zero. 
We wouldn't buy it, sell it, trade it, or touch it. If we saw it on the street, 
we would pass right by, as many people do in their cities and neighborhoods 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
It is an unfortunate choice to continually use the illegal drug retailer's 
price as a figure for measuring illegal drug amounts. It would be more accurate 
to continue to recount measures of weight or volume, whether it be stone, 
pound, or kilogram; even cubic feet will do for comparison. You could even use 
a misery factor, such as: "enough to kill 100 athletes, or cause 1,000 people 
to become hopelessly addicted." 
</P>
<P>
Unless you want to send the message that drugs equal money (or gold, or 
Ferraris), and ultimately that drugs and money are exchangeable, if not 
interchangeable, refrain from the visual and mental images of association that 
have become commonplace in news reporting and law enforcement publicity. The 
"street value" method is a dangerously wrong approach.

<P>
Your April 17 editorial ("Bennett's Drug Plan") suggested that drug czar 
William Bennett's drug plan should be focused on reducing drug demand rather 
than punishing its suppliers and users. This reminds me of other vague 
suggestions for reducing crime by eliminating its "root causes" (poverty 
intolerance, etc.) We will never succeed in reducing crime (including illegal 
drug usage) until we realize as a nation that the real cause of crime and use 
of illegal drugs is selfishness. 
</P>
<P>
Japan and other countries that have much greater success in this regard 
understand that the basic cause of crime is not external circumstances but is 
the individual's and society's response thereto. Once understood, criminal 
conduct will not be tolerated by society and we won't be sidetracked by 
never-ending attempts to eliminate its "root cause." 
</P>
<P>
Prompt and reasonably certain punishment is the only cure for crime and is 
always successful if supported by society.

PAN AM JOINS AS POSSIBLE SUITOR FOR NORTHWEST; 
</P>
<P>
SMALLER, MONEY-LOSING AIR CARRIER SEES MERGER WITH NWA AS ROUTE TO NEW LIFE

<P>
Ailing Pan Am Corp., joining the crowd of possible contenders for the parent of 
Northwest Airlines, said Tuesday that it is considering bidding for the much 
larger and stronger airline. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am said the wealthy Bass family of Ft. Worth would be one of its financial 
partners if it proceeds with a bid for NWA Inc. 
</P>
<P>
At the company's annual meeting here, Pan Am Chairman Thomas G. Plaskett said a 
merger would create a huge global carrier, combining Northwest's dominance in 
the Pacific market with Pan Am's strength in the North Atlantic. "It seems to 
us a classic end-to-end merger," Plaskett told Pan Am's stunned shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
A merger with Northwest could revive money-losing Pan Am, transforming it 
overnight into the biggest U.S. air carrier, with 470 aircraft, and the leader 
in the coveted Atlantic and Pacific markets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surprise Interest 
</P>
<P>
In making its announcement, Pan Am became the first airline to cast an 
acquisitive eye at Northwest. The company invited offers from investors a month 
ago, after rejecting as too low a hostile $2.7-billion bid from Los Angeles 
oilman Marvin Davis. Since then, Davis has been joined in the bidding for the 
airline by Los Angeles financier Alfred A. Checchi and, possibly, Northwest's 
machinists union, along with Pan Am. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am's interest in Northwest came as a surprise. Just three months ago, 
Plaskett said the airline needed a strong merger partner to survive. Airline 
industry analysts said American Airlines and other carriers looked at Pan Am 
but decided it was too sick to save. 
</P>
<P>
Now, apparently, Pan Am is considering making an acquisition of its own. A deal 
for Northwest, Plaskett said, was "something we should take a good hard look 
at." 
</P>
<P>
Edmund Greenslet, an airline analyst in Jacksonville, Fla., said the thinking 
at Pan Am probably was, "you might as well trade up if you can't do anything 
else. If no one else will buy you, you have to make the move." 
</P>
<P>
He continued: "Pan Am is strong where Northwest is not. They complement each 
other. Northwest has a domestic system, which Pan Am desperately needs." 
</P>
<P>
During the past several years, Pan Am has sold a number of key assets, 
including its New York headquarters and its valuable Pacific route system, to 
stay financially afloat. Last year, it lost $72 million on $3.6 billion in 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest, the largest U.S. carrier to Japan and the North Pacific and the 
nation's fifth-biggest airline overall, earned $135 million last year on $5.7 
billion in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
In weighing a bid, Pan Am has enlisted several well-heeled financial partners. 
Plaskett said that besides the Basses, Equitable Life Assurance Co. and 
Prudential-Bache Securities were prepared to participate. He said the group 
stood ready to make a "substantial equity" investment. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am didn't say how much it was prepared to spend to buy Northwest, and 
Plaskett cautioned that Pan Am hasn't yet decided to bid. The carrier has asked 
for permission to review Northwest's books, he said. "We will not make a bid if 
we cannot satisfy ourselves that a combined entity would be viable." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Beat the Deadline 
</P>
<P>
Northwest Chairman Steven G. Rothmeier said his airline's board would consider 
Pan Am's request for information. Northwest had established a deadline of last 
week for requesting information, according to informed sources. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am had contacted Northwest before the deadline but didn't sign a 
confidentiality agreement with Northwest. Northwest is requiring all 
prospective bidders to sign the agreement before it opens its books to them. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am director Walter B. Wriston said a Pan Am-Northwest merger would be "a 
terrific fit." 
</P>
<P>
"We need an American international carrier to compete in the global market," 
said Wriston, former chairman of Citicorp, which is providing financing for 
Davis' bid. He said there would be little problem in getting financial backing 
for a merger. "There are a lot of investors out there with hot money in their 
hands," he said. "They like the synergy here and they want to make a buck." 
</P>
<P>
Airline industry analysts noted that Northwest and Pan Am have only eight 
routes that overlap. Besides gaining financial strength from Northwest, Pan Am 
has about $1 billion in tax loss carryforwards that it could use to shield the 
income of a combined airline, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
A Pan Am-Northwest merger would make Pan Am the largest U.S. air carrier, with 
16.5% of the air travel market, according to Airline Economics, a Washington 
consulting group. Currently, United is ranked No. 1, with 16.46% of the market. 
</P>
<P>
But industry watchers cautioned that a combination would be difficult to 
execute. Both airlines have tense relationships with their unions that wouldn't 
be helped by a merger, analysts said. Northwest management hasn't settled 
important seniority issues with its pilots stemming from its 1985 merger with 
Republic Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
"The seniority issues would be difficult," said Kirk Faupol, head of the 
Northwest's pilots union. "Pan Am has a very senior work force." 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, analysts said, merging pay scales at the airlines might be 
tricky, because Northwest employees earn more than Pan Am workers. The 
highest-paid Pan Am pilot earns $115,000 a year, compared to $162,000 for the 
highest-paid Northwest pilot. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel A. Hersh, an airline analyst with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los 
Angeles, was among those who doubted the ability of the management at Northwest 
or Pan Am to smoothly integrate the airlines. He noted that Northwest's 
problems with lost baggage and late flights after merging with Republic earned 
it the nickname "Northworst." 
</P>
<P>
From an antitrust standpoint, Washington aviation lawyer Robert P. Silverberg 
said a merger between the two airlines didn't seem to present any serious 
problems. He said the airlines overlap only on a small number of international 
routes to Ireland, Scandinavia and London, and that Pan Am could simply give up 
those routes to get merger approval. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that Pan Am can feel somewhat comfortable that this is an 
approvable transaction," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am stock rose 62.5 cents a share to $5 on the New York Stock Exchange and 
NWA fell 50 cents to $104.25 a share.

VIACOM SUES HBO AND TIME, CLAIMS PREDATORY TACTICS 
</P>

<P>
Viacom International, whose Showtime pay television service has long been an 
underdog to Home Box Office, Tuesday sued HBO and parent Time Inc. for trying 
to illegally muscle out competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking $2.4 billion in damages, Viacom said Time's vast cable system has given 
unfair preference to HBO and Time's other cable channel, Cinemax, and has 
refused to air competing services such as Showtime. The suit, filed in U.S. 
District Court in Manhattan, also accused HBO of using its competitive clout to 
tie up the best movies offered by the Hollywood studios, thus blocking their 
use by other pay-TV services. 
</P>
<P>
The suit contended that Time and HBO have violated federal antitrust laws "by 
engaging in . . . predatory and exclusionary acts and strategies designed to 
increase the costs of their rivals, raise barriers to entry and expansion, and 
otherwise entrench themselves as monopolists." 
</P>
<P>
Time responded that it considers the suit to be "totally baseless" and said it 
expects to be vindicated after a vigorous defense. 
</P>
<P>
The publishing and entertainment conglomerate noted in a statement that many of 
the allegations "rehash issues that have been periodically raised for more than 
a decade." 
</P>
<P>
On several occasions, Time said, "the Justice Department has reviewed many if 
not all of these allegations and repeatedly concluded that no action was 
warranted. 
</P>
<P>
"The timing and content of Viacom's suit are curious, inasmuch as Showtime has 
initiated and aggressively pursued practices it now condemns. Particularly 
ironic is the allegation of Viacom -- itself a significant cable operator -- 
that all cable operators are local monopolists, a claim we strongly dispute." 
</P>
<P>
Many observers of the cable television industry said they were not surprised 
that Viacom has challenged Time. Combined, Time's pay services have 2 1/2 times 
the viewership of Showtime and the Movie Channel, Viacom's two pay channels. 
</P>
<P>
According to figures published in January by Paul Kagan Associates, a research 
firm in Carmel, Calif., that follows the cable industry, HBO has 17 million 
subscribers, or 45.7% of the market. Its companion channel, Cinemax, holds 
16.2% of the market, with 6 million subscribers. Showtime has 6.7 million 
subscribers, or 17.8%, and Movie Channel, with 2.7 million subscribers, has a 
7.3% share. 
</P>
<P>
Named in the suit in addition to Time and HBO were American Television &amp; 
Communications Corp., which is 82% owned by Time and is the nation's 
second-largest cable operator; and Manhattan Cable Television, which operates 
the only cable system serving Lower Manhattan's 370,000 homes. Viacom's cable 
operation is the nation's 10th-largest system. 
</P>
<P>
At issue in the case are several practices that have earned the cable business 
a reputation as a "very nasty, strong-arm business," in the words of one 
longtime observer of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
One notable practice is "tiering," in which a cable operator requires customers 
to buy one cable channel before it can buy another. In its suit, Viacom said 
HBO has "induced and coerced" cable operators in certain local markets to 
require subscribers to buy HBO and/or Cinemax before they may purchase Showtime 
and/or Movie Channel. As a result, Viacom said, its business has suffered. 
</P>
<P>
Another issue is "time lock." Under that practice, Viacom alleged, HBO has used 
its power to induce cable operators not to promote Showtime and the Movie 
Channel during the three two-month periods each year that HBO is heavily 
marketed. 
</P>
<P>
Also involved is "exclusivity," in which a company such as HBO or Showtime 
locks up exclusive rights to a studio's movies for showing over the pay TV 
channels. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed by Viacom International and Showtime Networks, both 
subsidiaries of Viacom Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The suit put actual monetary damage to Viacom at no less than $800 million. 
Under antitrust laws, damage awards are tripled. The amount actually sought is 
$2.4 billion. Viacom also seeks to have Time barred from any further 
anti-competitive actions. 
</P>
<P>
Stock in both Viacom and Time fell in composite New York Stock Exchange 
trading. Viacom shares dropped $1.375 to $53.375; Time sank $1.125 to $115. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time that bigness has come under fire in pay television. 
In 1981, a federal judge in New York pulled the plug on Premiere, a national 
pay television network formed by Getty Oil Co. and four major film studios, 
just two days before it was to be launched. 
</P>
<P>
In blocking the network, the judge agreed with government attorneys that the 
venture probably would violate the Sherman Antitrust Act because the 
participating film studios planned to withhold their motion pictures from 
competing pay TV services for nine months after being licensed to Premiere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Less Original Programming 
</P>
<P>
Most of the programming on HBO and Cinemax consists of recently released 
theatrical motion pictures, often purchased from studios on an exclusive basis. 
HBO also recently has concentrated on producing original programming, including 
movies and comedy and musical specials. It recently aired "Murderers Among Us: 
The Simon Wiesenthal Story" and produces an annual "Comic Relief" special that 
raises money for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Showtime's most prominent original programming was "It's Garry Shandling's 
Show," which it recently sold to Fox. It concentrates almost exclusively on 
acquiring theatrical motion pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Viacom also operates four advertiser-supported programming channels, including 
MTV: Music Television, and Nickelodeon. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of Viacom and Showtime executives formerly held top posts with HBO. 
</P>
<P>
They include Viacom President and Chief Executive Frank J. Biondi, who joined 
HBO in 1978 and eventually became president and chief executive. Winston H. 
(Tony) Cox, chairman and chief executive of Showtime Networks Inc., at one time 
was also president of HBO. Matt Blank, executive vice president of marketing 
for Showtime, held a similar post at HBO. 
</P>
<P>
One Wall Street analyst, who declined to be identified, said the presence of 
the former HBO executives at Viacom lent some credibility to the suit. "If 
anybody should know, it's Frank Biondi," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Gerbrandt, an analyst with Paul Kagan Associates, said the case could be 
viewed as "an isolated incident, . . . a legal squabble." However, he noted, 
there is the far broader issue of Time's plan to merge with Warner 
Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Itself a cable system operator and movie maker, Warner would give Time 
additional clout by giving it control of more subscribers and programming. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends on how the whole issue of competition plays itself out (after the 
merger)," Gerbrandt noted. "Viacom has been concerned over the Time-Warner 
merger and what that means for broader access to markets." 
</P>
<P>
At one time, Warner owned half of Showtime but sold its share to Viacom, then 
its partner in the venture. Warner, which still carries Showtime over its cable 
systems, was not named in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
Although the suit mentions the merger at great length, a spokeswoman for Viacom 
told Reuters that "it is not Viacom's intention to enjoin the Time-Warner 
merger." And Viacom pointed out in a statement that its lawsuit has been in the 
works for "over a year." 
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that the complex case, which has been assigned to U.S. District 
Judge John Walker, is likely to take years to resolve. 
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, the complaint calls into question the whole history of the pay TV 
and cable TV business over the last 20 years," said a source close to HBO. 
"It's an enormous amount of territory to cover." 
</P>
<P>
"This will be an enormously complicated case to try," said John Higgins, 
financial editor of Multichannel News, a New York-based publication that tracks 
the cable industry. "The discovery process is going to take years because of 
the intricacy of the charges" and the number of cable systems involved.

JAMES FLANIGAN: REGULATING CAR INSURERS TAKES STAFF, MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anticipation of a better deal on auto insurance has been running high since the 
California Supreme Court last week upheld most of Proposition 103 -- the ballot 
initiative that called for a 20% reduction in insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
But the thing to keep in mind about the court's decision is that it was a blow 
for stronger regulation -- and now the real work begins. 
</P>
<P>
The court said that voters have a right to reduce insurance rates, as long as 
they don't violate the insurers' right to make a "fair and reasonable" profit. 
And then it handed responsibility for determining what is fair and reasonable 
to the California Department of Insurance, the state's regulatory body that 
will decide if insurers must cut current premiums and will screen all new 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
Strong regulation is needed. Californians have suffered some of the nation's 
highest and fastest-rising insurance rates -- 14% a year -- for most of this 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
But good regulation is an exacting business, demanding skilled staff and tax 
expenditures. It is not free. Moreover, if regulation is done carelessly, it 
can make matters worse. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New York Best Model 
</P>
<P>
So we would do well to know the difference between competence and incompetence. 
And that means looking not to California, where regulation has been weak, but 
to New York State's Insurance Department. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody says New York is the best. Consumer groups admire its regulation 
because it has held down premiums. While auto rates nationwide have risen 9% a 
year in the last five years, rates in New York State have risen 3.4%. Yet the 
insurance industry respects New York as an intelligent regulator, and calls its 
staff work first-rate. (Illinois and Michigan are also admired for competence, 
while New Jersey and Massachusetts are mired in problems.) 
</P>
<P>
New Yorkers pay for competence. The State Insurance Department has an annual 
budget of $46.7 million and employs 790 people, including 45 actuaries, the 
mathematicians of insurance who calculate risks and set premiums. Not every 
state employs actuaries, high-priced specialists who are able to command 
$100,000 a year in industry. New York's actuaries are often retirees who work 
for less. 
</P>
<P>
"It is important to have them," explains Wayne Carter, the New York 
department's research director, "because insurers use actuarial assumptions in 
setting rates and you are at a disadvantage in evaluating them if you don't 
have the expertise." 
</P>
<P>
New York also successfully administers a no-fault insurance law -- the system 
in which each driver's insurer pays his or her expenses after an accident, and 
lawsuits are barred except in case of serious injury. The key to no-fault is 
defining serious injury. Many states do it in money terms -- allowing lawsuits 
if hospital expenses are above a certain amount. But that only sets up targets 
for plaintiffs and lawyers, say New York regulators, so the state defines 
injuries specifically, and limits lawsuits to those involving at least loss of 
limb or disfigurement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Need Staff, Decisions 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey and Massachusetts didn't limit lawsuits and as a result have the 
highest auto rates in the nation, along with California and Alaska, a special 
case. 
</P>
<P>
The point is that good regulation takes knowledgeable staff and hard decisions. 
But ominously for the high hopes of California drivers, the state's insurance 
department is widely regarded as less than competent -- even in the minimal 
regulation it has had to do until now. 
</P>
<P>
Ominously, too, discussions about implementing Prop. 103 have so far centered 
on the political office of insurance commissioner -- currently held by Roxani 
Gillespie. But Gillespie, or even her office, cannot ensure good regulation. 
Only competent staff can do that. 
</P>
<P>
And California's record is not impressive, even though it has had the 
resources. The insurance department's annual budget is $35.3 million and it 
employs 515 people. It has 12 actuaries but no experience in rate setting, the 
most challenging task handed it by Prop. 103. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance accounting is especially complex, and the industry is sure to hit 
California with a blizzard of figures. Auto policies nationwide, according to 
the industry, produce a profit of only 2 cents on the premium dollar, 
reflecting a loss of 8 cents on liability coverage but a profit on 12 cents on 
collision and comprehensive. And California does worse, says the industry, with 
8.6 cents lost on liability and only 8 cents profit on collision. 
</P>
<P>
The results look meager, unless one knows how the industry allocates expenses, 
and understands also that insurers make their real money by investing the 
premiums during the time they're held in reserve against claims. Meanwhile, the 
insurance industry thinks it might even come out of Prop. 103 with higher 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Prop. 103 has corrected some insurance injustices, such as the 
geographic anomaly cited by author Andrew Tobias in his 1982 book, "The 
Invisible Bankers." Why should insurance premiums be much higher in a big city 
than in its suburbs, asked Tobias, even though many cars on city streets are 
driven in from the suburbs? 
</P>
<P>
The premiums shouldn't be higher, said Prop. 103, and replaced geography with 
sensible criteria, such as driving records and experience. 
</P>
<P>
So the law is clear, and valid. But from here, the necessary work of regulation 
will take skill and money -- as in tax expenditures to hire strong staff. Good 
regulation is not free. But then, weak regulation can be expensive too -- as it 
has been in California where, for some reason, the largest market paid some of 
the highest and fastest-rising insurance costs.

RJR Nabisco to Sell 5 Units: RJR Nabisco Inc. said it will sell five European 
snack food businesses to reduce debt accumulated after its recent $24.9-billion 
leveraged buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. The food and tobacco 
giant said the businesses -- three in the United Kingdom, one in France and one 
in Italy -- had pretax income last year of about $137 million on annual revenue 
of about $1.2 billion. RJR Nabisco said it will sell the companies separately 
or as a group.

ITT to Establish ESOP: ITT Corp., the focus of recent takeover speculation, 
will institute a $700-million employee stock ownership plan designed to put 
about 11% of its shares in workers' hands, Chairman and Chief Executive Rand V. 
Araskog said at the company's annual shareholders meeting in Bal Harbour, Fla. 
The plan should boost the defenses of the diversified New York-based services 
company against a takeover or leveraged buyout, although it adds to its nearly 
$3-billion debt, said spokesman James Gallagher. Araskog said the voluntary 
employee ownership plan will hold about 12 million shares. The plan would add 
to the 3.5% of shares already owned by its 47,000 U.S.-based salaried 
employees.

MCA SAYS IT MAY SELL SPENCER GIFTS UNIT

MCA Inc. is considering selling its slumping gift store and catalogue unit, 
Spencer Gifts, and will make a decision later this year, Chairman Lew R. 
Wasserman disclosed Wednesday at the entertainment giant's annual meeting in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question about the firm's plans for the unit, Wasserman noted 
that retail sales are weak nationally. He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Spencer Gifts has a mail-order catalogue business and operates retail gift 
stores, jewelry stores and kiosks across the country. Earnings of MCA's retail 
and mail-order division declined to $403,000 last year, from $9.5 million in 
1987 and $115.5 million in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Wasserman said MCA had been "successful" in its effort to keep the 
management of Cineplex Odeon Corp. from buying control of the Canadian-based 
theater operator. MCA, the largest shareholder of the concern with a 49% stake, 
resisted the bid by Cineplex Odeon Chairman Garth H. Drabinsky to buy 30% of 
company shares from the Bronfman family. 
</P>
<P>
Wasserman turned aside questions on news reports that MCA may go private or be 
sold. "We are constantly examining what is in the best interests of all 
shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
Shareholders defeated a proposal to have the company cease doing business in 
South Africa. The proposal was beaten by a margin of 73% to 8%, with 19% 
abstaining. 
</P>
<P>
The advocates of the proposal were the Adrian Dominican Sisters and Christian 
Brothers Investment Services Inc., who together hold 60,500 shares of MCA 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
Sid Sheinberg, MCA president and chief operating officer, said the company 
considers the issue a matter of freedom of speech. He cited the example of the 
Universal International Pictures film, "Cry Freedom," about the life of South 
African black activist Steve Biko. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see this as analogous to companies that sell products . . . . We see 
it as analogous to our freedom of speech," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheinberg said MCA would consider using profits from its South African 
operations to fight apartheid there.

DEFEATED UAW DISSIDENTS VOW ELECTION CHALLENGES 
</P>

<P>
A dissident movement inside the United Auto Workers union, seeking to curb 
labor-management cooperation in the auto industry, has suffered a series of 
political setbacks in local union elections in recent days, the group 
acknowledged Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But the dissidents charge that the UAW leadership has engaged in widespread 
election fraud and say they plan to appeal the results, both at the union's 
national convention in Anaheim in June and in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
UAW officials deny the charges, but admit that the bitter election campaign may 
lead to a serious rift within the nation's most influential industrial union. 
</P>
<P>
Donny Douglas, a charismatic local union leader from Pontiac, Mich., has lost 
his bid to unseat an incumbent UAW regional director in the Detroit area, and 
thus gain a seat on the union's governing executive board. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another dissident, Jerry Tucker, is also apparently losing in his 
campaign for re-election as regional director in the St. Louis area. UAW 
officials say Tucker, who won the seat in a court-ordered election last fall, 
has been unseated by a candidate backed by union President Owen Bieber, but 
Tucker has not yet conceded. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas, a longtime dissident who has frequently opposed contract concessions 
in the auto industry, campaigned against a wide array of joint labor-management 
programs that have been accepted by the UAW's leadership. He charged that those 
"team-oriented" programs have done little more than give management extra 
leverage over workers, and have eroded the union's power on the shop floor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Early Victories 
</P>
<P>
At first, his assaults against the UAW leadership's willingness to work more 
closely with management galvanized many rank-and-file workers at General 
Motors, and they flocked to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
He swept to early landslide victories in locals at GM plants in the eastside 
Detroit region. His success stunned UAW leaders, and they fought back hard. 
</P>
<P>
UAW staffers were asked to contribute $500 apiece to finance a campaign to stop 
Douglas and Tucker, and Bieber and other UAW leaders visited plants throughout 
the two regions with contested elections. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Douglas failed to gain enough votes in the many Chrysler plants in 
the east Detroit region, and lost to incumbent Bob Lent, who was originally 
from a Chrysler local. At the same time, Tucker was trailing Roy Wyse, a former 
assistant regional director who was backed by Bieber. 
</P>
<P>
Another test for the dissident movement came Tuesday, when workers at Mazda's 
new U.S. assembly plant outside Detroit, now represented by the UAW, voted for 
local union officers for the first time. Phillip Keeling, a dissident running 
under Douglas' "New Directions" banner, was challenging a UAW-backed candidate, 
Bill Judson. 
</P>
<P>
Keeling was running in opposition to the union's acceptance of Mazda's 
Japanese-style workplace policies, most notably kaizen, a Japanese term defined 
as the search for continuous improvement. The dissidents at Mazda claim kaizen 
is just a Japanese word for a speed-up, and insist that the union should not 
work so closely with Mazda to achieve kaizen. 
</P>
<P>
Judson and the UAW leadership, meanwhile, argue that the union should work with 
Mazda to modify kaizen, without rejecting it completely. 
</P>
<P>
A dissident victory in the union fight at Mazda, one of three Japanese-managed 
U.S. assembly plants where workers now have UAW representation, could represent 
a fundamental challenge to Japanese efforts to import their management 
techniques to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Results from the Mazda election were not available late Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their losses in the regional elections, leaders of the dissident group 
vowed to continue their fight at the UAW convention in Anaheim where delegates 
selected in the local elections will then actually choose regional directors 
and other union officers. 
</P>
<P>
Although the UAW leadership now seems assured of a majority of delegates for 
its regional candidates, Pete Kelly, a longtime UAW dissident and Douglas' 
campaign manager, vowed to challenge their credentials. He charges fraud in 
many of the local elections where pro-Bieber delegates were swept in. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly also vowed to take the UAW's leadership to court on charges of election 
fraud if Douglas loses at the convention. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charges of Fraud 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Kelly alleges that the UAW leadership illegally used union 
and management resources to campaign for Administration-backed candidates. At 
one Ford plant in suburban Detroit, for example, the company agreed to shut 
down production for 45 minutes to allow Bieber to speak to workers just before 
the local election there. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker also charges fraud, and has already protested 11 local elections in his 
region. "They are systematically stealing the thing," Tucker said. "The 
position of the Bieber people is to win at all costs." 
</P>
<P>
UAW officials deny they have used improper tactics to win. "It's not surprising 
they would make those charges and use exaggerated rhetoric," said UAW spokesman 
Peter Laarman. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some officials privately acknowledge that the strength of the dissident 
movement caught the leadership off guard, and may force the union to rethink 
some of its joint programs with management.

SEMATECH NOT IDEAL MODEL, STUDY SUGGESTS

Sematech, a government-funded consortium formed to enhance the U.S. 
semiconductor industry, has been successful so far but should not necessarily 
be used as a role model for other industries, according to a new government 
study. 
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared by the Commerce Department and issued by the Pentagon, 
generally praises the work of the 2-year-old consortium, whose members are 
charged with the task of developing technologies needed to produce 
sophisticated semiconductors. The Bush Administration has recommended 
continuing Sematech's $100-million annual government funding next year, an 
amount matched by the 14 member companies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focus on Conditions 
</P>
<P>
The report notes, however, that the set of conditions working in favor of 
Sematech may not exist for other technologies. In recent months, a sort of 
"consortium fever" has spread through high-tech industries, with cooperative 
ventures being discussed for the development of high-definition television, 
opto-electronics and superconductivity, among others. 
</P>
<P>
"Sematech has a lot of things going for it that might not be present in other 
cases," said Jeffrey L. Mayer, the report's author and deputy director of the 
Commerce Department's Office of Economic Policy. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Sematech benefits from participation by leading firms in 
the industry, including International Business Machines Corp., and enjoys wide 
support among experts who believe that semiconductor know-how is essential to 
U.S. economic and military strength. It not only has a set of research problems 
common to all its members, but the problems are far enough removed from 
commercialization that firms can cooperate in the laboratory while still 
competing in the marketplace, the report concludes. 
</P>
<P>
The report also notes the tensions that can develop as Sematech's members -- 
most of them large firms with worldwide operations -- forge ties with foreign 
competitors. Last December, for example, Texas Instruments Inc. caused a stir 
when it agreed to work with Hitachi Ltd. of Japan to develop a certain type of 
semiconductor.

MOCA GIVEN ART DONATION OF $60 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, Times Art Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A gift of classic modern and contemporary art, reportedly worth in excess of 
$60 million, has been donated to the Museum of Contemporary Art from the 
collection of the late Rita and Taft Schreiber. Although consisting of just 18 
works, it is in monetary and artistic terms by far the most valuable bequest 
yet received by the 10-year-old institution, MOCA director Richard Koshalek 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Schreiber collection, comprising only about 35 works altogether, has been 
universally admired by art professionals for its solidity and connoisseurship. 
The MOCA trove encompasses works by Jackson Pollock, Piet Mondrian, and Arshile 
Gorky, among others, and is regarded as the cream of the ensemble. It adds a 
significant historical and qualitative dimension to the museum's permanent 
holdings, Koshalek said. 
</P>
<P>
Its large estimated value derives from the recent hyper-escalation in price for 
works of art at auction, which has virtually driven museums out of the market. 
</P>
<P>
The MOCA bequest was made by Schreiber's widow, Rita, who died earlier this 
year. Taft Schreiber, a director and executive at MCA Inc. and a Republican 
political activist of long standing, died in 1976. He was Ronald Reagan's 
Hollywood agent and became a friend and member of Reagan's informal "kitchen 
cabinet" when Reagan was governor. 
</P>
<P>
Rita Schreiber became a frequent visitor to MOCA in recent years. Their 
daughter, Lenore Greenberg, president of the board of MOCA, said, in a prepared 
statement, "It was my mother's wish that these works of art remain in Los 
Angeles where she and my father lived. It is especially gratifying that their 
collection is now to be given to MOCA for the enjoyment of everyone." 
</P>
<P>
The Schreiber gift, which includes works by 13 artists, covers the years 
between 1930 and 1960. The most prepossessing single object is Pollock's 
"Number 1," a classic "drip" painting of 1949. Executed in delicately woven 
skeins of autumnal color, the painting is considered one of the most lyrical of 
a group of pictures that represent one of the greatest aesthetic breakthroughs 
in modern art. 
</P>
<P>
Pollock, who died in an auto crash in 1956, attended Manual Arts High School in 
Los Angeles before moving to New York. Although psychologically troubled and a 
chronic alcoholic, he managed to invent a new form of "over-all" painting and 
is credited with being the first artist to directly release the contents of the 
subconscious in abstract pictorial form. 
</P>
<P>
Other works in the MOCA gift include Mondrian's "Abstract Painting" (1939); two 
versions of Alberto Giacometti's 1960 sculpture, "Tall Figure," plus his 
"Interior Studio With Three Apples"; Gorky's "Betrothal I" (1947); Pierre 
Alchinsky's "Pres de La Bete" (1960); Alexander Calder's "Portrait" (1964); 
Jean Dubuffet's "L'Ecoulment De La Ville" (1962); Morris Louis' "Pillar of 
Delay" (1961); Joan Miro's "Personnages dan La Nuit" (1949); two sculptures by 
George Rickey; Mark Rothko's "Yellow and Orange/(Red)" (1949); three paintings 
by Nicholas de Stael, and Mark Tobey's "Lake" (1959). 
</P>
<P>
The works will be exhibited at MOCA from June 3 through Oct. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Another Pollock from the same period as "Number 1," but regarded as a less 
well-resolved painting, sold for $11.55 million last week at a Sotheby's 
auction in New York. Auction records for other leading artists in the gift, 
according to Sotheby's, include $5 million for Mondrian, $2.5 million for Miro, 
$6.8 million for Giacometti and $572,000 for Gorky. 
</P>
<P>
Koshalek praised the collection as "one assembled with extraordinary 
sensitivity, passion and clear-sighted discipline." He added that "with these 
works, we are able to strengthen the foundation of our museum, providing 
brilliant historical context for much of the work being created today." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly elated with the gift, Koshalek said that even if a museum had the funds 
to purchase, say, a valuable Pollock these days, they are scarce to the point 
of unavailability. 
</P>
<P>
The Schreiber group, he said, adds a crucial missing chapter in the museum's 
permanent collection. An earlier, $11-million purchase of 60 works from the 
collection of Count Giuseppe Panza di Biumo gave the museum strength in 
Abstract Expressionism and early Pop Art. The 60-work collection of television 
producer Barry Lowen, bequeathed to MOCA on his death in 1985, lent it 
representation from the '60s to the present. 
</P>
<P>
The Schreiber gift adds a foundation of strong representation in the 1940s. 
Koshalek termed the Mondrian "essential to any collection" and called Gorky's 
1947 painting, "Betrothal I," "a pivotal work in the transition from Surrealism 
to Abstract Expressionism." Typical of Gorky's best work, it shows ambiguous, 
softly colored shapes in a gentle tan atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Gorky, who died in 1948, was an Armenian immigrant whose real name was Vosdanig 
Adoian. He is regarded as the artist who gave sensual reality to the ambiguous 
amoeba shapes of European biomorphic surrealists like Miro and linked them to 
the highly physical work of the Abstract Expressionists. 
</P>
<P>
Commenting by phone from Washington, Jack Cowart, head of the department and 
curator of 20th-Century Art at the National Gallery of Art said, "Bravo for 
L.A. It's a stellar group with a breath-taking level of achievement by each 
artist. 
</P>
<P>
"The works are monuments in the evolution of European and American art from the 
period before the Second World War to the early 1960s, and MOCA and the L.A. 
Basin are very, very lucky to receive them." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the National Gallery would have liked to receive the gift, Cowart 
said: "I think it is very right that this major portion of the collection 
should remain right there where it is (in L.A.). So whether the National 
Gallery or Chicago or Dallas or Atlanta would want it is a moot point. 
</P>
<P>
"The works were amassed by great, passionate and acute collectors who lived 
with their art and exercised a fabulous process of choice and connoisseurship." 
</P>
<P>
Koshalek pointed out MOCA's longstanding intention to collect "in depth," 
acquiring several examples of an artist's work rather than just one. 
</P>
<P>
"Three Giacomettis give us depth right off the bat. If you add the Schreiber 
Rothko to what we already have in the Panza group, we now probably have the 
best collection in the country." 
</P>
<P>
He said the museum's involvement with the Schreiber collection goes back to 
1983 when portions of it were included in the inaugural "The First Show," which 
presented works from eight private collections. 
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the MOCA gift, County Museum of Art director Earl A. Powell said, 
"We are pleased that these great works from the Schreiber collection will 
remain in Los Angeles. It is a very distinguished assemblage, particularly the 
Jackson Pollock." 
</P>
<P>
The museum was founded in 1979 and opened in a converted warehouse in Little 
Tokyo in 1983. Permanent MOCA headquarters, designed by architect Arata 
Isozaki, opened at 250 S. Grand Ave. in December, 1986.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT MEETS PROTESTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the wake of a student protest against alleged racism at Loyola Marymount 
University, President James N. Loughran met late last week with minority 
students who one week earlier had taken over his office at the Westchester 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
Although Loughran declined to comment on his discussions with the students 
until he had issued a statement to the university community, he said the 
meeting was mostly to confirm agreements made after the student takeover last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Loughran acknowledged that insensitivity toward minorities is 
an issue on the campus. 
</P>
<P>
On April 27, five minority students arrived at Loughran's office at the end of 
the business day, demanding to discuss minority issues, including allegations 
of racism among administrators.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PAROLE OFFICE SITE STILL UNDER STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state parole administrator told the Pasadena Board of Directors that 
placement of a parole office at 468 N. Rosemead Blvd. remains under 
consideration despite strong opposition from Hastings Ranch residents. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Marino, parole administrator who has taken charge of the search for a 
parole office site in Pasadena, said his agency is willing to look at other 
sites in Pasadena, but "we have to get something going in the next couple of 
months." The Department of Corrections is under pressure to find a new office 
because it has promised to close one of its two Alhambra offices by October. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena directors, expressing frustration at conflicting figures they have 
received about how many parolees live in Pasadena and how many would be 
serviced by the proposed office, asked Marino to supply accurate information. 
</P>
<P>
Director Rick Cole said the least objectionable location would be in the 
downtown area, but Director Chris Holden said he would oppose any effort to 
place it in the portion of the downtown area he represents. Cole said he could 
not accept it in the downtown portion of his district unless other directors 
were willing to look at sites in their districts, too. He noted that nearly all 
districts include some portion of Colorado Boulevard or other downtown 
commercial streets.

Two British navy airmen were killed Monday when their aircraft crashed into a 
harbor during a demonstration display, a Defense Ministry spokesman said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Jetstream trainer aircraft failed to pull out of a dive and crashed 
into Portland harbor, near the southern English town of Weymouth, in full view 
of 500 naval cadets. The airmen's bodies were recovered by divers.

PRO FOOTBALL PLAYERS TESTIFY AGAINST STEROID USE; 
</P>
<P>
PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DANGERS OF DRUGS EXPLAINED TO SENATE COMMITTEE

All-pro lineman Bill Fralic of the Atlanta Falcons said here Tuesday that 
"steroid madness" pervades most locker rooms and weight rooms in professional 
football, and estimated that 75% of today's linemen use the body-building 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Courson, who played with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers until he retired in 1985, called himself "a man possessed" when he 
used anabolic steroids and said that they might have caused permanent damage to 
his heart. He said that doctors have given him five years to live. 
</P>
<P>
"Every athlete pursues a dream and sometimes that dream can become distorted," 
he said. "Winning is what I was concerned with. (Taking steroids) is the 
biggest regret of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Testifying before a Senate committee, members of football's elite -- including 
Fralic, Courson, Coach Chuck Noll of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Coach Bo 
Schembechler of the University of Michigan and Coach Joe Paterno of Penn State 
-- testified as to the physical and psychological dangers of using steroids. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Joseph R. Biden (D-Del.), who has authored a bill making it illegal to 
transport steroids through the mail, called steroid use widespread and said 
that action must be taken soon to prevent their abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not focus enough attention on the cocaine problem in the late 1970s and 
early 1980s, with disastrous results," he said. "We cannot afford to repeat 
that mistake" with steroids. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the side effects, however, Biden said that use of steroids by 
football players teaches youths that "it's OK to take short cuts to achieve 
success -- whether it's using drugs, or cheating, or anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Fralic and Courson agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Steroid use is rampant among the NFL, and that includes my own team," Fralic 
told senators on the Judiciary Committee. "It is rampant in colleges and it is 
rampant in high schools. Everybody is blind to it because they choose to ignore 
what is happening." 
</P>
<P>
It is, he said, an epidemic that is spreading because of the "win-at-all-cost" 
attitude prevalent at all levels of football. Citing his own brief experience 
with steroids, Fralic recalled how all he wanted was "to be the best." 
</P>
<P>
Courson remembered the pressure, too. In college, he said, steroids helped him 
develop speed, size, intensity and strength. In the NFL, Courson said, the 
drugs helped him compete in NFL strong-man contests and gave him the "mind-set 
of a mercenary." 
</P>
<P>
His heart permanently weakened by the drugs, Courson testified, he lost his 
starting position and eventually retired. 
</P>
<P>
"Steroids were hard to quit until the point where, mentally, I didn't care 
about being competitive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There is little agreement, however, about what should be done to stop steroid 
use by athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Seven weeks ago, Pete Rozelle, retiring commissioner of the National Football 
League, wrote new rules that imposed tough sanctions on players who tested 
positive for steroid use. 
</P>
<P>
Rozelle told the Senate panel Tuesday that he advocates "periodic, unscheduled 
testing" as the best way to detect the drug and deter athletes from using it. 
</P>
<P>
But the football players' union long has been opposed to random testing, 
successfully challenging the provision in a 1986 NFL anti-drug proposal. The 
NFL tests players only once a year, before summer camp, or if there is reason 
to suspect steroid use. 
</P>
<P>
"Until the players say they are in favor of random testing, we are opposed to 
it," Gene Upshaw, executive director for the NFL Players Assn., told the 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
Paterno and Schembechler both testified that some players probably use steroids 
at their schools and said that a combination of testing, education and 
discipline is needed to combat the trend. 
</P>
<P>
"Steroids do give players an advantage," Paterno said. "That's basically the 
problem."

NBC'S WEISMAN FIRED BY EBERSOL, O'NEIL NAMED EXECUTIVE PRODUCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Weisman, executive producer of NBC sports since 1983, was fired 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
He will be replaced by Terry O'Neil, a former sports producer at both ABC and 
CBS who has run his own production company the last few years. O'Neil will take 
over May 30. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Ebersol, named president of NBC sports a month ago, said he made the 
change because of his 20-year association with O'Neil. 
</P>
<P>
Ebersol said there were no other candidates for the position and that he 
probably would not have made the change had O'Neil turned him down. 
</P>
<P>
Ebersol, 41, and O'Neil, 39, worked together at ABC sports early in their 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
Said Ebersol: "I decided that my first major decision as president of NBC 
sports was to form my own team. Terry and I first crossed paths early in the 
'70s, when he succeeded me as a researcher for the Summer Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neil was best known at CBS as the coordinating producer of National Football 
League telecasts. John Madden's gimmick, called the CBS Chalkboard, was 
O'Neil's idea. 
</P>
<P>
Ebersol met with Weisman for about 20 minutes Tuesday afternoon to give him the 
news. 
</P>
<P>
Said Weisman: "What happened was that Dick called me into his office and said, 
in effect, we haven't worked together, your work is terrific, but I decided I 
need my own guy to work with. I was almost not insulted." 
</P>
<P>
Said Ebersol: "I can't imagine anyone taking it in a more classy manner. 
Michael and I are friends and I hope we can maintain a relationship with him in 
much the way NBC sports has with Don Ohlmeyer (the executive producer before 
Weisman)." 
</P>
<P>
Ohlmeyer Communications produces such sports programming as the Skins Game and 
the Senior Skins Game for NBC. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neil said he got a call soon after Ebersol was named NBC sports president 
April 10. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I wasn't sure I wanted the job," O'Neil said. "But Dick is very 
persuasive." 
</P>
<P>
Weisman has 2 1/2 years left on a contract that reportedly pays him more than 
$600,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Employees at NBC in New York said Weisman was visibly shaken when he left the 
building. LARRY STEWART

Smyth was in the lead when he fell off and grabbed the spinnaker, capsizing the

SCOTT OSTLER: BEST SLUGGERS PUT SOMETHING EXTRA INTO THEIR SWINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Ostler 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dear Answer Man ... 
</P>
<P>
 It seems like every time a slugger hits a home run these days, he explains it 
to the media by saying, "I got my arms extended." What exactly does this mean? 
</P>
<P>
 The worst thing that can happen to a baseball hitter, other than becoming 
involved with Margo Adams, is to get jammed by the pitcher, to have an inside 
pitch strike the bat on the skinny handle. To avoid this predicament, many 
hitters are submitting to relatively new orthopedic surgery known simply as 
"getting your arms extended." 
</P>
<P>
It's a procedure in which a six-inch section is removed from each thigh bone, 
and is inserted into each upper-arm bone, known as the humerus, although there 
is nothing funny about the bone or the operation. The operation can be 
performed under either local or general pain-numbing drugs, but most players 
prefer that the surgeon be stone sober. 
</P>
<P>
With his arms surgically extended, the hitter is able to stand deep in the 
batter's box and still reach all areas of the plate with the fat part of his 
bat. Some hitters with extended arms can actually bat from the on-deck circle, 
although this is considered hotdogging. 
</P>
<P>
There are also side advantages to the surgery. A hitter with good arm extension 
can tie his shoes without bending over, and long arms are an asset at fast-food 
drive-through windows, where the normal-armed person has to lean awkwardly out 
of his car and invariably drops his change, french fries or both on the 
driveway. 
</P>
<P>
Extended-arm ballplayers who golf as a hobby find it necessary to have their 
club shafts shortened to a length of about six inches. 
</P>
<P>
Players who get their arms extended usually follow up with an operation to get 
their contracts extended. But that's another story. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernie Bickerstaff, the coach of the Seattle SuperSonics, seemed upset after 
Sunday's game because the fire alarm in the team's hotel had gone off at 3 
o'clock that morning. Surely Bernie doesn't suspect any Laker involvement in 
that untimely mechanical malfunction? 
</P>
<P>
 Paranoia runs deep during the NBA playoffs, but Bickerstaff seemed satisfied 
when told of the results of the hotel's investigation into the alarm mishap. 
Hotel security guards briefly detained Laker trainer Gary Vitti after he was 
found wandering in a hotel hallway a 3 a.m., holding a flaming torch next to a 
smoke detector. But Vitti was released after explaining that he was merely 
participating in the torch relay for the Barcelona Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
When one hotel security officer said, "Wait a minute, those Olympics are three 
years away," Vitti explained, "How long do you think it takes to jog to 
Barcelona?" 
</P>
<P>
 I see that Mike Tyson was awarded an honorary doctorate in Humane Letters by 
Central State University in Ohio, "For his influence on young people," 
presumably Michael Spinks and Robin Givens. Has Tyson been honored by any other 
universities? 
</P>
<P>
 Several, but in one noteworthy ceremony attended by the Answer Man, Tyson was 
named a Doctor of Humanities and Parallel Parking by the Acme University of 
Driving in Barstow (school motto: "Take me to Acme, driver, and step on it!"). 
</P>
<P>
Acme U's dean, Thornton Gridlock III, saluted Tyson for "spotlighting the 
critical need for driver training among athletes." Dean Gridlock, who was late 
for the ceremony because Tyson had parked his bright red Linguine-Testaverde in 
the dean's reserved parking stall, also praised the lead-footed heavyweight 
champ "for striking a healthy fear into the hearts of sane drivers everywhere." 
He called Tyson "The rightful heir to the driving legacy of Mr. Magoo." 
</P>
<P>
Tyson addressed the students, telling them not to use him as a role model. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't recommend that you drive 71 m.p.h. through a crowded city, as I 
recently did," Tyson said. "That was stupid of me. When you drive that fast, 
it's hard to pick up babes." 
</P>
<P>
Notably absent from the Acme U. festivities was Don King, Tyson's trusted 
confidante and adviser, who was slated to receive a honorary doctorate in 
Spiritual Back-seat Driving. King was attending a meeting of the 
Electrochemical Society, where he was attempting to convince the world's 
leading scientific minds that he has produced cold fusion in his hair 
follicles.

Gert-Jan Theunisse of the Netherlands left a pack of 20 riders with 1 1/2 miles 
remaining and easily won the rain-dampened fourth stage of the Tour de Trump 
bicycle race at Winchester, Va., but Dag Otto Lauritzen of Norway maintained 
his overall lead. 
</P>

Theunisse, 26, the 11th-place finisher in last year's Tour de France, was timed

Pa., to Winchester in north-central Virginia.

<P>
Eric Vanderaerden of Norway, winner of Monday's third stage, out-sprinted Davis 
Phinney of Boulder, Colo., and finished second in 4:42:04. Phinney's effort, in 
the same time as Vanderaerden, was the first top-three finish by an American.

LEACH RETURNS TO RANGERS AFTER 24-HOUR ABSENCE

Rick Leach returned to the Texas Rangers Tuesday night after a 24-hour absence, 
during which he was issued a summons for possessing a small amount of 
marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Leach refused to answer specific questions about his disappearance, his second 
in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, right now it's a personal problem that will be handled between me 
and the team," Leach said before the Rangers' game against the New York 
Yankees. "That's all I have to say about it. I don't feel good about it. I 
talked to the players on the team and that was a tough thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
Leach contacted the team at about 2:30 p.m. Tuesday and arrived at Yankee 
Stadium about five hours later, minutes before game time. He did not start, but 
was in uniform and on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
A missing persons report had been filed Tuesday for Leach. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very happy Rick Leach is OK, but we're disappointed he missed a game," 
Ranger General Manager Tom Grieve said. "That's a problem and there will be 
disciplinary action." 
</P>
<P>
The criminal summons was issued to Leach after police and security personnel at 
the Grand Hyatt Hotel found a package of marijuana when they searched his room 
for clues as to his whereabouts, police spokesman Sgt. John Clifford said. The 
package contained less than an ounce of marijuana and appeared to be for 
personal use, Clifford said. 
</P>
<P>
While a member of the Toronto Blue Jays, Leach disappeared in Seattle from Aug. 
25-27, 1987, after having an argument with his wife Angie.

For Roderick Hills, one of the newly appointed outside directors meant to 
oversee investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the acceptance of a top 
legal job in Washington recently has sparked a few barbs from his friends. 
</P>
<P>
Hills was named in late April as head of the Washington office of Donovan 
Leisure Newton &amp; Irvine, a prominent New York-based law firm. He said the 
twin appointments have brought a few jokes from his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"They keep asking 'did you think you needed 200 lawyers?' " he told Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
Hills was named to Drexel's board as part of the investment banking company's 
settlement this month of massive securities fraud charges brought by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. He is one of three new outside directors 
who will also serve as an oversight committee to monitor Drexel's internal 
audits and controls. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Hills has been active in corporate raiding, and has launched 
a proxy fight to unseat the management of a long-troubled electrical company. 
</P>
<P>
But Hills, who is married to Carla A. Hills, the U.S. Trade Representative, is 
no stranger to financial regulation. In 1975, he served as White House counsel 
to President Gerald R. Ford and was then named chairman of the SEC, where he 
remained until the conclusion of the Ford Administration. 
</P>
<P>
He is also taking his role at Drexel seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"My charge is to make sure that employees at Drexel can have confidence that 
their company is being run and managed in an appropriate fashion," Hills said 
in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have an opinion as to what was wrong, if it was wrong, at Drexel," he 
said.

county Agricultural Commissioner's Office. 
</P>
<P>
The report said the 1988 agriculture value figure was 3.26%, or $30.7 million, 
higher than the previous year and preserved the county's ranking as the sixth 
highest agriculture producer among California's 58 counties. 
</P>

FBI STUDIES CHARGES ABOUT O.C.-BASED S&amp;L OPERATION

<P>
The FBI has been asked to investigate allegations that Charles H. Keating Jr. 
and other officers of American Continental Corp. profited illegally from their 
operation of the firm's Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, a federal 
official confirmed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations were referred to FBI officials in Phoenix and Los Angeles by 
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates the nation's savings and 
loans. An FBI spokesman in Phoenix said the agency is reviewing the allegations 
and would decide this week whether to open a formal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
In six separate referrals, the bank board asked the FBI to look into 
allegations that Keating and other corporate executives illegally profited from 
improper insider loans, defrauded shareholders and bondholders, manipulated 
stock prices, sold land fraudulently and falsified reports filed with 
regulators, according to a federal official with access to the documents. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for Keating and American Continental denied the allegations. They 
claimed that regulators breached a written agreement by raising old issues for 
criminal investigation. In addition, they said the bank board already had 
looked into those issues and had said it could find no wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of 
federal bankruptcy laws on April 13. The next day, regulators seized Lincoln 
and placed it in a conservatorship, claiming that American Continental was 
dissipating Lincoln's $5.3 billion in assets and operating the thrift in an 
"unsafe and unsound" manner. 
</P>
<P>
Among the victims of the bankruptcy filing are about 22,000 bondholders, many 
of them elderly people, who purchased $200 million in junk bonds issued by 
American Continental and sold through Lincoln branch offices. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interest Payments Halted 
</P>
<P>
Since the filing, American Continental has stopped making interest payments on 
the bonds, and the company has acknowledged that bondholders could lose all or 
part of their investment. 
</P>
<P>
Some bondholders have said they were unaware that the bonds were not protected 
by the government's deposit insurance program. 
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy filing and the seizure of Lincoln brought to a head a bitter 
feud that has been building since American Continental bought the S&amp;L for 
$51 million in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
A. Melvin McDonald, a former U.S. attorney in Phoenix who now represents 
American Continental, said at a Tuesday press conference that a quarterly 
report filed by regulators on April 21 showed that Lincoln was solvent, with 
$192 million in capital to protect it against potential losses. 
</P>
<P>
But Mark Randall, a regulator assigned to manage Lincoln since the seizure, 
said that amendments to the report will be filed and that Lincoln will likely 
end up with a negative net worth. 
</P>
<P>
Among the issues that regulators want the FBI to investigate are stock sales, 
big salaries and deals involving American Continental insiders, according to 
the federal official, who requested anonymity. He declined, however, to 
disclose specific information about the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
But American Continental's 1988 proxy statement shows that Keating received 
nearly $2 million in total compensation in 1987. He picked up an additional 
$3.3 million from the company when it bought back 300,000 shares of his stock 
at $8.67 per share. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stake in Partnership 
</P>
<P>
Keating also was part of a group of officers and directors who had a 17% stake 
in a limited partnership that had obtained a $1.6-million loan from Lincoln to 
buy a shopping center from one of American Continental's subsidiaries, 
according to proxy materials. 
</P>
<P>
Other American Continental officers, their total 1987 compensation and their 
gains from sale of stock to the company, if any, were: 
</P>
<P>
* Charles H. Keating III, executive vice president and Keating's only son, 
$863,494 in compensation and $600,000 in gains from stock sales. 
</P>
<P>
* Robert J. Kielty, senior vice president and general counsel, $873,952 in 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
Judy J. Wischer, corporate president, $839,693 in compensation. 
</P>
<P>
* Robert M. Wurzelbacher Jr., senior vice president and a Keating son-in-law, 
$647,129 in compensation and $625,000 in stock sales. 
</P>
<P>
All 14 top executives, as a group, received $8.1 million in compensation in 
1987. Other insiders who sold stock to the company were Bradley J. Boland, a 
Keating son-in-law who received $318,750, and Thomas D. Mulhearn, another 
Keating son-in-law who received $315,625. 
</P>
<P>
Company spokesman Mark M. Connally said there was nothing improper about the 
salaries, the compensation or the loan transactions. He said no directors or 
executives received any direct loans personally. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weitzman Hired 
</P>
<P>
"This S&amp;L has been the most investigated S&amp;L in the United States," 
said McDonald, the former U.S. attorney who now represents American 
Continental. He said that regulators have been closely scrutinizing the S&amp;L 
for 3 years and that their claims come as no surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, meanwhile, has hired Howard L. Weitzman, the attorney who won an 
acquittal for car maker John De Lorean on drug trafficking charges, to head the 
legal team representing Keating and American Continental in their legal battles 
with federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Weitzman, a Los Angeles trial lawyer specializing in white-collar crimes, said 
Tuesday that he has agreed to represent Keating in any criminal case that might 
arise from the government's investigation of Lincoln and American Continental. 
</P>
<P>
Weitzman said he has no direct knowledge of any criminal charges pending 
against Keating. He said, however, that "because one matter involves a 
Department of Justice investigation, the logical conclusion is that the 
government hopes to get a grand jury indictment on criminal charges."

RITES SET FOR MAN WHO DROWNED IN POOL MISHAP 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Memorial services will be held tonight and Thursday for a 26-year-old Costa 
Mesa man who died after trying to see how long he could hold his breath under 
water. 
</P>
<P>
Services for Joseph H. Knowlton will be held at 7 tonight at Pacific View 
Memorial Park, 3500 Pacific View Drive, Newport Beach. Viewing will be from 
4:30 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial Mass will be said at 11 a.m. Thursday at Saints Simon and Jude 
Church, 20444 Magnolia St., Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
According to his family, Knowlton, a certified scuba diver and avid swimmer, 
was with friends late Friday night at a La Habra Heights home when some of them 
decided to see how long they could hold their breath under water in the home's 
swimming pool. While timing himself under water with a wristwatch, Knowlton 
apparently lost consciousness. He was taken to Friendly Hills Regional Medical 
Center in La Habra, where he died Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Knowlton said later that his brother, an automotive parts manager, was "a 
really competitive person" who liked to scuba dive at Santa Catalina Island, 
ride mountain bikes and ski. He said his brother always carried a piece of 
paper with words by Albert Einstein that read, "Try not to be a man of success 
but a man of value."

PEOPLE / HERBERT J. VIDA: BRETT BUTLER'S BUSINESS VENTURE IS A CREATURE OF HIS 
CHILDHOOD'S FASCINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brett Butler, 26, has been fascinated with monsters and extinct creatures since 
his childhood days. Now he's making them. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember I was in the seventh grade and was already fooling around with 
liquid latex and cotton and making horror masks for my friends," said Butler, 
who over the years has become a self-taught monster maker with the help of 
books he bought or borrowed from the library. 
</P>
<P>
Comic books also fascinate Butler. "I guess I still have about 1,000 of them, 
and I still read them," he said. "They give me ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Since his early days, Butler has experimented with a series of creative 
outlets, including painting, sculpting, special-effects movies and 
cable-controlled creatures. 
</P>
<P>
"I always had to do something, and I always seemed to be making little 
creatures and molds," most of which are in the family garage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Butler's big inspiration came during a visit at the Natural History Museum in 
Los Angeles where he saw his first animated dinosaur. "That just sent me head 
over heels," said the Santa Ana resident. "I contacted the company that made 
the creature and bothered them off and on for 2 years until they gave me a 
job," said Butler, who was earning his living working in a magic store and as a 
roving magician mimicking Peewee Herman. He has performed on the Queen Mary and 
at private parties. 
</P>
<P>
His first assignment was to build a 27-foot-long replica of the extinct 
pterodactyl, a flying reptile. 
</P>
<P>
"The assignment was a shock to me. I thought, 'What have I talked myself into?' 
" he recalled. "I told them I could do it, and I did. It was really 
challenging, since I had been making things that were only 5 or 6 inches long.' 
</P>
<P>
Now, Butler has launched his own business called Gothic Studios Inc. in Brea, 
where he is developing creatures such as "Tweetie," a feathered robotic version 
of the California condor that can spread its wings through built-in computer 
controls. 
</P>
<P>
He plans to include the condor and extinct and near-extinct creatures into 
exhibits at museums and schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to put on a new exhibit so people can get caught up in a sense of 
wonder and excitement," said Butler, who is trying to raise $1 million in 
venture capital to finance the project. "It will not only be educational, but 
entertaining, like going to Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he still finds Disneyland a soothing outlet for him. "I have been 
going twice a week for years," he said. "It gives me a chance to unwind and 
forget about the things I think a lot about." 
</P>
<P>
Besides his display of creatures, Butler is developing a show called "Mother 
Earth," and another using insects blown into giant sizes. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to provide special effects to draw people these days. "They see it on 
television and in movies and they want to see something exciting when they have 
to pay to get in," said Butler, who said people often mistake his name for that 
of the hero in "Gone With The Wind." 
</P>
<P>
"I remind them his first name was Rhett and mine is Brett," Butler said. "But 
frankly, I don't give a damn." 
</P>
<P>
To promote their "Year of the Young Reader" program, the 900 students at 
Moulton Elementary School in San Juan Capistrano will release balloons Friday 
with response cards attached asking the finder to write down the title of his 
or her favorite book and send it back. 
</P>
<P>
The weeklong project will include talks by local authors, and students will 
dress as their favorite character in a book they have read. 
</P>
<P>
"The object is to stimulate children to gain an interest in reading and 
writing," Principal Patricia Griggs said. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledgments -- Artwork created by 9-year-old Patty M. Rangel that depicts 
one of her dreams has been chosen as part of the Southwest Regional Crayola 
Dream Makers exhibit, which opens today at the University of Colorado. The 
Santa Ana youngster's drawing is among 75 representative samples from nearly 3 
million students in kindergarten through sixth grade.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN CLEMENTE; 
</P>
<P>
MAN HELD AFTER CHASE; 44 POUNDS OF POT FOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 25-year-old man was arrested early Tuesday on suspicion of smuggling about 44 
pounds of marijuana after leading federal agents on a 7-mile chase from the 
Border Patrol checkpoint into San Clemente, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Nicolas Ramirez-Avalos, a Mexican national, was turned over to the North San 
Diego County Narcotics Task Force, a Border Patrol spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez was chased into San Clemente after he tried to escape a search at the 
checkpoint a few miles south on Interstate 5, said Mike Greg, supervisory 
Border Patrol agent. 
</P>
<P>
Officers found in the car 44.2 pounds of marijuana, with an estimated street 
value of $22,100, Greg said. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez was first stopped at about 3 a.m. Tuesday, Greg said. Asked to pull 
over to the secondary checkpoint, Ramirez sped off northbound in his 1985 Buick 
Skylark. Federal agents pursued. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez exited the freeway and stopped in a small San Clemente cul-de-sac, Greg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Federal agents arrested Ramirez after he leaped out of his car and tried to run 
away, Greg said.

<P>
NEWPORT-MESA SCHOOL DISTRICT VOTES TO KEEP 'EM DOWN ON THE FARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIMBERLY L. JACKSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Newport-Mesa Unified School District Board of Trustees voted Tuesday to 
keep open a high school farm that gives students a taste of rural life. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted unanimously to keep the 19-acre farm at Costa Mesa High School 
operating with the recommendation that staff monitor the program to see if 
student enrollment increases. They also encouraged parents to help maintain the 
farm, home to more than 200 sheep, pigs, steers and rabbits. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Forrest Werner, who had met with parents and students before the 
vote and visited the farm last week, called the agricultural program "a 
jim-dandy operation." 
</P>
<P>
Werner said his decision was based in part on "a considerable amount of 
community support. I hope that the same people would stay behind it." 
</P>
<P>
Student Brent Noller, 14, whose leg was broken recently in a baseball game, 
said he was happy with the vote and walked up on crutches to thank board 
members for their decision. "They're actually giving us a chance to prove what 
we can do," he said after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The decision went against a recommendation last month by Principal Frank J. 
Infusino to close the farm on grounds that a single instructor could not 
adequately maintain the farm, supervise students and ensure the safety of 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
His concern revolved around instructor Roy Center being the only adult on the 
farm while students operated heavy equipment, including a tractor, Infusino 
said. District officials said low enrollment throughout the district prompted 
the school to lay off an aide last year who had helped Center maintain the 
farm. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by a group of excited students after the meeting, Center said he was 
pleased with the trustees' vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was supported by the increase in enrollment" for the next school 
year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The school district offers three agricultural courses for students interested 
in working on the farm -- one is an elective for eighth-graders and two are 
electives for high schoolers. 
</P>
<P>
Center said that 23 eighth-graders now enrolled in the farm course have signed 
up for the eighth-grade classes next year. There are also 23 high school 
students who have signed up for the advanced agricultural class, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, eighth-graders were permitted to enroll in a program that included a 
farm course along with home economics, wood shop and vocal music. 
</P>
<P>
Board members had earlier considered reducing the farm program to one class 
that would be available to all students, or limiting its use to after-school 
and weekend clubs only. 
</P>
<P>
The district spent $500,000 on concrete pens, fences and other improvements to 
the farm less than 10 years ago. By closing the farm, school officials had 
estimated that they would save about $35,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Infusino could not be reached for comment after the board's decision Tuesday.

INITIATIVE WOULD STRIKE OUT PROTECTION; 
</P>
<P>
IRVINE VOTERS TO DECIDE GAY RIGHTS ISSUE NOV. 7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARCIDA DODSON and MICHAEL CICCHESE, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Irvine City Council on Tuesday night voted unanimously to place a 
controversial initiative on the Nov. 7 school board election ballot that would 
strip gays of protection under the city's anti-discrimination ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just pleased we will at last get it before the community," said Mayor 
Larry Agran, an opponent of the initiative. "Just like the council stood up for 
human rights, the community will have a chance to stand up for human rights." 
</P>
<P>
The ballot measure represents the first time in Orange County that voters will 
cast ballots on the issue of equal rights for homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative is the project of the Irvine Values Coalition, a group of 
residents who collected 5,433 signatures to require the City Council to place 
it on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy it is on the November ballot," said Scott Peotter, a member of 
the coalition. "I feel confident, but there is a lot of work ahead of us." 
</P>
<P>
By placing the initiative on the same ballot with the school board race next 
fall instead of calling a special election, the city will save about $30,000, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The calm public discussion preceding Tuesday's vote was interrupted briefly 
when Councilman Edward A. Dornan made reference to an assault of two gay men in 
Laguna Beach by three neo-Nazi youths, saying that the Irvine Values Coalition 
started its campaign around the same time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Apology Demanded 
</P>
<P>
Michael Shea of the coalition stood up and asked if Dornan was referring to the 
coalition as neo-Nazis and demanded an apology. Dornan refused. 
</P>
<P>
Shea told the council about an incident in which two gay men verbally assaulted 
him and his wife, calling them discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
When asked by council members how he knew the men were gay, Shea said they 
admitted it, and he asked council members if they would lie about their sexual 
orientation. 
</P>
<P>
Agran responded: "If it got you really exercised, I might." 
</P>
<P>
The initiative, if approved by the voters next fall, will remove the words 
sexual orientation from the city's human rights ordinance. That ordinance now 
bans discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, 
sex, age, sexual orientation, marital status or physical handicap in housing, 
employment, educational institutions and public service. 
</P>
<P>
Further, under the initiative, the ordinance could not be changed back to 
include protection for sexual orientation in the future without putting the 
measure before the voters again. That would require another initiative effort 
by residents or a two-thirds vote of the City Council, according to the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
But City Atty. Roger Grable, in a report to the council, said that last 
provision for a "supermajority" vote by the council is in conflict with state 
law. The law requires a simple majority -- three-fifths vote, in Irvine's case 
-- for such action, while the initiative would require a four-fifths votes, 
Grable said. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, if the initiative is adopted by voters, "the supermajority 
provision might well be unenforceable" if a council majority wants to put the 
issue before the voters again, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Discriminatory Intent' 
</P>
<P>
Agran said in an interview before the meeting that the requirement for a 
four-fifths council vote "clumsily reveals the discriminatory intent that 
motivated the document (initiative) in the first place. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"It's saying, 'We want to discriminate against gays and lesbians and make it 
virtually impossible for the city in the future to correct against 
discrimination.' " 
</P>
<P>
The anti-discrimination ordinance was approved unanimously by the City Council 
last July. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the Irvine Values Coalition have charged that the city has 
granted "special rights" for homosexuals and legislated morality. The 
initiative states that "sexual orientation has never been considered a 
fundamental human right" by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Extending "special protection" to homosexuals will burden the police and 
courts, the initiative says. It further states that people "should be free to 
make decisions and act in the interests of their own individual health and 
safety without undue government interference." 
</P>
<P>
But proponents of the human rights ordinance said the law provides equal 
rights, not special rights. They contend that the coalition's efforts will 
effectively give residents and businesses the right to discriminate against 
homosexuals and have suggested that if such an initiative is passed, other 
minority groups could be targeted in the future.

DISTRICT LINING UP SUBS FOR ANAHEIM SCHOOLS WALKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARCIDA DODSON and MARIA NEWMAN, Times Staff Writers 
</P>

<P>
Substitute teachers were still being hired late Tuesday afternoon as Anaheim 
Union High School District officials made final preparations to keep all of the 
district's 21 schools open during a 1-day teacher strike today over stalled 
salary talks. 
</P>
<P>
While Assistant Supt. LeRoy Kellogg declined to say how many substitutes were 
on standby, the president of the Anaheim Secondary Teachers Assn. said he 
expected at least 600 of the district's 900 teachers to walk out. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they (district officials) ever expected the kind of unity 
displayed at our meeting last Friday," when 82.4% of the teachers gave the 
go-ahead for today's 1-day strike, union President Leonard Lahtinen said. 
Teachers are expected to walk off the job at every school, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Union district officials have vowed to keep all classes open and 
continue regular services through the job action. Kellogg said the district 
placed advertisements in Tuesday's newspapers seeking credentialed substitute 
teachers and was also drawing on other districts' rolls of substitute teachers 
to hire enough, at $180 a day each, to cover the strike. The Anaheim Union High 
School District, which includes junior and senior high schools for most of 
Anaheim, as well as for La Palma and Cypress, maintains a list of about 250 
substitute teachers. Many substitutes are retired teachers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Kellogg said he would be surprised if retired teachers crossing picket 
lines today included former Anaheim Union High School District teachers, who 
most likely once belonged to the union. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be surprised if they do, and disappointed," added union President 
Lahtinen. 
</P>
<P>
The strike is being waged on statewide Day of the Teacher to demonstrate the 
teachers' impatience with stalled contract talks. Teachers have been working 
without a contract since last August, and the two sides have failed to reach 
any agreement despite the attempts of a state mediator. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers, whose salaries range from $21,000 to $42,000 annually, want a 41% 
share of the district's budget surplus after a 2.5% reserve is set aside this 
year. For next year, they are seeking a cost-of-living adjustment of about 
3.2%, plus 41% of the budget surplus after a 3% reserve is set aside. 
Negotiators for the district, which has suffered financially as enrollment has 
dropped through the years, do not want to guarantee a pay raise but have 
offered teachers a share of any budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
But teachers say that going without a guaranteed increase for 2 years is 
unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically we've been willing to bite the bullet for this year, but we refuse 
to do that for another year," Lahtinen said. No new negotiating sessions are 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
"We're waiting for a call from them. The ball is in their court. We don't have 
anything else to offer," Lahtinen said. 
</P>
<P>
He said district officials were asking teachers Tuesday to "hand in all keys, 
roll books, roll sheets, attendance cards." Although he said that is standard 
procedure in the district's strike manual, "I think teachers feel that it's an 
insult. We are having a 1-day strike. It's not as if they're never going to 
come back to the classroom again." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers plan to set up picket lines at each campus before school begins. At 
noon, they will hold a rally at Pearson Park in downtown Anaheim, with teachers 
from nearby Anaheim High School marching to the site, Lahtinen said. The 
teachers will have lunch before heading back to the schools for more picketing, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The district board has voted to punish the strikers with loss of pay or 
disciplinary action and will make it more difficult for teachers to take sick 
leave on the day of the strike. 
</P>
<P>
District officials will not know how many teachers are absent from classrooms 
until the school day begins. 
</P>
<P>
While Kellogg declined to give specific numbers, he said "several hundred" 
substitutes will be standing by and will be dispatched from several "staging 
areas" within the district. He would not say whether classrooms would have to 
be combined for the day but stressed that there will be "adequate teachers to 
keep the schools open." Students who are absent without an excuse will be 
considered truant, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Kellogg said countless parents have been calling the district's strike 
information hot line for a taped message that states that schools will be open 
and that the district "will maintain safe and orderly campuses." 
</P>
<P>
Kellogg said the district has hired private security guards for the day, which 
irked Lahtinen. 
</P>
<P>
"We put out a flyer to our members asking why the district has finally found 
the money to improve security when we've been asking for that," he said. "They 
will hire them when teachers are on strike, but when teachers are on the job, 
they're not interested in securing the campus."

7 GRATEFUL DEAD FANS ASK IRVINE NOT TO BAN CONCERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CICCHESE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven fans of the rock band the Grateful Dead on Tuesday night urged the Irvine 
City Council not to ban concerts but to look for a solution to ensure public 
safety at future events. 
</P>
<P>
The council responded by saying the city will continue to work with the 
management of the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre to avoid future problems. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy surrounded the band's three-night stand on April 28, 29 and 30. 
On the second night 500 fans without tickets reportedly began throwing rocks 
and bottles at police and security officers, and lighting bonfires when they 
could not get into Irvine Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said two officers suffered minor injuries and 40 people were 
arrested, most for drug-related offenses and assault. The night before, 25 
people were arrested and on Sunday night -- the last night -- only nine were 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The Grateful Dead has been playing since 1965 and has a loyal following of 
fans, known as Deadheads, some of whom follow the band from city to city. 
</P>
<P>
After the dust settled from the concert, city officials such as Mayor Larry 
Agran cited concern about continuing trouble each time the Grateful Dead 
appears at Irvine Meadows. But he said he realized that the council had no 
authority to tell Irvine Meadows management whom not to book. 
</P>
<P>
At its meeting Tuesday night, the council agreed that most of the problems 
could have been avoided if the event had not been scheduled on the same weekend 
as the El Toro Air Show and if more camping grounds were provided. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Manager Paul Brady said that after the city met with Irvine 
Meadows management, amphitheater officials agreed not to schedule events on the 
same weekend as the air show and not to have events in which Irvine Meadows 
could not provide sufficient security and camping grounds.

TWO SUNSET TEAMS FACE WILD-CARD TESTS

<P>
For the second consecutive season, it appears the Sunset League was the 
toughest boys' volleyball league in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Three teams from the Sunset -- Huntington Beach, Edison and Marina -- were 
ranked among the top six in Orange County by the end of the regular season, and 
all three were ranked among the top eight in the 4-A. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach (14-1) won the league championship and is waiting for Friday's 
first round of the Southern Section 4-A playoffs. But the league's other 
quality teams, Edison (14-2) and Marina (11-4), must play tonight in a 4-A 
wild-card round that features eight matches. 
</P>
<P>
Edison, the Sunset's No. 2 team and the only team to beat Huntington Beach, is 
at home against Culver City (13-7), which finished third in the Ocean League. 
That's a little more impressive when you consider that the No. 1 team from the 
Ocean League also is the top-seeded team in the 4-A, Mira Costa (18-0). 
</P>
<P>
Marina, which split games with Edison, travels to play the Ocean League's No. 2 
team, North Torrance (13-3). Marina already has proven it can win big matches, 
as in its four-game defeat of then-undefeated and top-ranked Laguna Beach two 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
In other 4-A wild-card matches: Torrance (9-5) at University (11-3); Capistrano 
Valley (7-9) at Woodbridge (10-5); Newport Harbor (9-5) at Rolling Hills 
(14-2), and Irvine (7-9) at home against Laguna Hills (7-8), with the winner 
getting the dubious honor of playing No. 1 Mira Costa in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
In 3-A wild-card games involving county teams, Mater Dei (14-3) is at home 
against Lakewood (13-4) and Pacifica (11-9) plays at Esperanza (12-4). STEVE

SUNNY HILLS TAKES THE TITLE IN NO-HITTER AGAINST TROY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly lost in the midst of celebrating only the second league baseball 
championship in Sunny Hills High School's 29-year history Tuesday was a 
no-hitter tainted by eight walks and two hit-batsmen. 
</P>
<P>
Starter Brian Veronda had the rare distinction of being replaced in the midst 
of pitching a no-hitter in the sixth inning after walking the bases loaded, but 
reliever Ryan Frace struck out four of the six batters he faced in host Sunny 
Hills' 5-1 victory over Troy. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave Sunny Hills (18-7 overall, 12-2 in league) the Freeway League 
title, matching the school's only other championship in 1985. Sunny Hills holds 
a two-game lead over Troy with one game left to play. 
</P>
<P>
"It (no-hitter) didn't even enter my mind," said Doug Elliott, Sunny Hills 
coach. "We won the ballgame, and that's all I care about. League titles have 
been pretty hard to come by around here." 
</P>
<P>
Veronda (5-1) walked seven and hit two batters but managed to avoid any trouble 
thanks to a couple of fine plays by Sunny Hills shortstop Benny Rodriguez and 
several key strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
But when Troy (15-7, 10-4) loaded the bases with nobody out in the sixth inning 
and trailing, 5-0, Elliott never hesitated in motioning for Frace to enter the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even know he had a no-hitter," Elliott said. "You mean they didn't 
get any hits today? I didn't know that." 
</P>
<P>
Troy avoided a shutout when Tho Nguyen scored while Frace induced Darby 
Carmichael to hit into a double play and then Frace struck out the side in the 
seventh to clinch the title. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills scored all of its runs in the third inning with two outs off losing 
pitcher Tom Wilson (8-1). Right fielder Jeff White hit a two-run single, and 
the Lancers benefited from some sloppy play by Troy's outfielders who committed 
three errors in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
"That inning took the life out of us," said Dan Robinson, Troy coach. "They're 
good, that's why they're No. 1 in the league. Veronda is right up there with 
the best pitchers we've faced this year, although he was a little wild today." 
</P>
<P>
The game was delayed for 15 minutes in the sixth inning when plate umpire Scott 
Daniels was hit in the face by a wild pitch and had to be treated by local 
paramedics. Daniels suffered a deep facial cut but continued to umpire the game 
following treatment. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra 4, Fullerton 3 -- The Highlanders (12-8, 8-6) scored three runs in the 
top of the fifth to take a 4-2 lead. Rob Szente had a two-run double and David 
Stevens followed with an RBI single in the inning. Tom Juarez (3-3) scattered 
eight hits for the victory. Chris Rubal had two hits for Fullerton (11-10-1, 
8-6). 
</P>
<P>
Sonora 8, Buena Park 7 -- The Raiders (7-16, 3-11) scored two runs in the top 
of the seventh for the victory. Jack Hay tied the score, 7-7, with an RBI 
single and Kevin Cook then walked to force home the go-ahead run. Stuart 
Cochran of Sonora had four hits.

SHEFF'S HOMER GIVES LAGUNA HILLS DRIVE TO BEAT TRABUCO HILLS, WIN TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Chris Sheff's 123rd career hit was your typical rocket, a hard line drive that 
cleared the center-field fence in what seemed like record time. 
</P>
<P>
It also went for a three-run homer that propelled Laguna Hills High School to a 
5-1 victory over Trabuco Hills that clinched the Pacific Coast League 
championship Tuesday at Trabuco Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The score had been tied, 1-1, heading into the fourth inning of Game 1 of a 
two-game set between the teams that would decide the league champion. Laguna 
Hills (21-4 overall, 13-1 in league play) led Trabuco Hills (14-6, 11-3) by a 
game coming into the game and had to lose twice to lose the title. 
</P>
<P>
Sheff's blast helped to put an end to Trabuco Hills' championship hopes, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
Sheff, the all-time career hit leader in Orange County, came up to bat with one 
out and Mark Wells and Ron Kortman aboard on walks. 
</P>
<P>
David Lowery, Trabuco Hills' starting pitcher, blew two fastballs by Sheff. But 
Sheff worked the count to two and two. Lowery threw another fastball and Sheff 
belted it for a three-run homer and a 4-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills added another run in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks ended the game much stronger than they started it. 
</P>
<P>
Starting pitcher Rob Milo gave up three hits in the first inning, including a 
run-scoring double to Lowery, faced seven batters and didn't figure to last 
long at that pace. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Hodges, Laguna Hills coach, went out to check on Milo during the first 
inning and didn't like what he heard. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me he wasn't loose," Hodges said. "I had told him I'd rather have him 
leave an inning in the bullpen rather than bring the bullpen with him to the 
mound." 
</P>
<P>
Translation: Milo hadn't warmed up enough before the game. 
</P>
<P>
But Milo managed to whip himself into shape. 
</P>
<P>
He faltered in the bottom of the sixth, however, as Lowery singled and Jeff 
Carrao followed with a double. 
</P>
<P>
Hodges brought Kortman in to relieve, but he quickly got into bigger trouble. 
Ryan Meridith reached on an infield single, loading the bases with none out. 
</P>
<P>
But Kortman got Jim Skidmore to pop up, then struck out Jeff Lokey and Steve 
Tepper to preserve the lead. He got the Mustangs in order in the seventh to 
pick up his third save. 
</P>
<P>
Milo, despite giving up seven hits, improved his record to 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
"For a guy who hasn't pitched before this season, he's done very well," Hodges 
said of Milo, who will attend Stanford next fall. 
</P>
<P>
Orange 19, Laguna Beach 6 -- Jesus Romo had four hits and four RBIs for Orange 
(15-10, 9-5) at Laguna Beach. Scott McMahon and Greg Folsom each had four hits 
and two RBIs for the Panthers. Laguna Beach is 7-14, 3-11. 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge 9, Costa Mesa 1 -- Sean Spelber went two for three and scored twice, 
and Marc Howard went two for four, including a double with two RBIs and two 
runs scored, for Woodbridge (4-19, 2-12) at UC Irvine. Sophomore Trent Zappen 
(1-0) pitched a one-hitter with four strikeouts and three walks. Costa Mesa is 
4-10 in league play.

AMERICAN TOXXIC SELLS BCL TO BOLSTER CASH POSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American Toxxic Control Inc., a troubled Huntington Beach maker of equipment 
for cleaning up hazardous waste, said Monday that it had agreed to sell its BCL 
Associates Inc. unit. 
</P>
<P>
The buyer is Earth Technology Corp., a publicly held environmental engineering 
consultant in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The terms were not disclosed. American Toxxic said it was selling BCL -- a 
Huntington Beach environmental consulting and testing concern -- because 
American Toxxic is short of cash. Also, it is still in danger of defaulting on 
a $4-million debt, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of BCL -- expected to close by the end of the month -- bought American 
Toxxic a little more time from its creditors, Merrill Lynch Business Capital 
Inc. and a small San Francisco investment fund, BBU Mezzanine Fund. The two 
have now extended their deadline to May 25 for declaring American Toxxic in 
default, the company said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Earth Technology, meanwhile, employs 350 and had earnings of $1.2 million last 
year on revenue of $40.8 million.

ENTREPRENEUR BUCKS BIG ODDS WITH SMALL FIRM, WINS AWARD

<P>
If Stephen W. Hess had known that nearly all small businesses are doomed to 
failure, he might never have started his own company. 
</P>
<P>
But ignorant of the harsh realities and driven by a desire to own a business, 
Hess mortgaged the house, sold some stock and got a little help from a friend 
to start Hessco Industries Inc. in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
His initial investment in the La Habra-based fiberglass bathtub and shower 
business was $124,000. Today Hess is projecting $40 million in sales for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In recognition of his success, Hess was recently named the Small Business 
Person of the Year by the local district of the U.S. Small Business 
Administration. The district includes Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
"We live in a wonderful country, a country full of opportunities," Hess said. 
</P>
<P>
Hess was selected over seven other nominees after ranking high in such 
categories as years in business, impact on the job market, contributions to the 
community and response to hard times. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'His Story Just Stood Out' 
</P>
<P>
"He was just an obvious choice," said Sandy Sutton, public information officer 
for SBA and a member of the panel. "When we read the files on all the nominees, 
his story just stood out." 
</P>
<P>
For 15 years Hess dreamed of owning a business and stayed up late many nights 
trying to figure out what it would take. In 1972 he went to work for Lasco, a 
company that produces plumbing parts. He soon became part of the corporate 
staff in charge of manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
While at Lasco, Hess found the opportunity he was looking for. 
</P>
<P>
"I came in one Monday and the president of the company said, 'Did you read the 
Sunday Times? Noris is going out of business.' This was one of our 
competitors," Hess said. 
</P>
<P>
"An hour and 10 minutes later I was talking face to face with the president of 
Noris, and I made him an offer to buy the molds. He said I would have to have 
the money there by 9 a.m. So I called a friend and told him, 'I need $25,000 to 
start this business, and I want you to be a stockholder.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hess delivered the money on time and bought the other equipment 3 days later at 
Noris' liquidation auction. 
</P>
<P>
During the first 2 years, Hess said, he was in a daze about running the 
business. He had four employees and worked 20-hour days. 
</P>
<P>
Gradually he worked his way out of his daze and everything started going his 
way, until 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1981 we had a depression in the housing industry," Hess said. "Customers 
were going broke left and right. Our business dropped to a third." 
</P>
<P>
Hess filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy code. He knew he had to come up with something new to keep his 
business alive. 
</P>
<P>
During those lean years Hessco added some products so it did not have to rely 
on the housing industry. One was caskets. "We must have buried 4,000 to 5,000 
people during that time," Hess said. 
</P>
<P>
Another was whirlpools. 
</P>
<P>
"Whirlpools are becoming the biggest part of the business. We're selling them 
in Canada, the Caribbean, Japan, Istanbul, France and England," Hess said. "Our 
international sales are about $4 million." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Facilities Opened 
</P>
<P>
After the recession of the early 1980s, Hessco got its annual sales up to $8 
million in 1983, its pre-1981 volume. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984 Hess opened a facility in Eloy, Ariz., and in 1987 he bought another 
factory in Wheeling, W. Va. Today Hessco employs 397 people, including 250 in 
La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
Hess is part of the small percentage of small business owners who succeed. The 
failure rate for small business in Orange County is 82%, according to the 
Orange County Business Development Council. The Department of Commerce places 
the national rate at 88 to 92%. 
</P>
<P>
Hess "is a good man, a driven man," said Olaf Arneson, Hessco vice president 
for finance. "He is an entrepreneur in the classic sense." 
</P>
<P>
When asked what a person needs to be successful in starting his own business, 
Hess said somewhat jokingly, "The first thing is never run out of cash." 
</P>
<P>
However, Hess added that people planning to start a business must be prepared 
to work long hours. They need to know the business well and they need to know 
how to manage people, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Business is people, people, people," Hess said. "No matter what business 
you're in." 
</P>

ALMANAC / RETURN ON ASSETS OF COUNTY THRIFTS: GUARDIAN RANKS BEST AMONG 34 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guardian Savings &amp; Loan Assn. was the standout county-based thrift last 
year in a ranking of return on assets, a key measure of the health and 
profitability of thrifts and banks. 
</P>
<P>
Return on assets represents net income as a percentage of an institution's 
total assets. A return on assets of 1% is considered good; anything below 0.5% 
is considered poor. 
</P>
<P>
Only four S&amp;Ls topped 1%, led by Guardian's 3.06%, according to data 
compiled by Sheshunoff Information Services Inc. Twenty-seven of the 30 others 
were below 0.5%. 
</P>
<P>
The average for all thrifts in the state was 0.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Guardian was also one of the fastest-growing thrifts in the county, with a 51% 
increase in assets in the year ended Dec. 30. Three other institutions made the 
top 10 in both return on assets and asset growth: Western Financial Savings 
Bank, Beach Savings Bank and San Clemente Savings &amp; Loan.

Fierce thunderstorms whipped the Mississippi Delta, battering the area with 
high winds. Thunderstorms and hailstorms also socked the Carolinas, Georgia, 
the Ohio Valley and Oklahoma, the weather service said. Mississippi's storms 
spread to Louisiana by late morning, pelting the towns of Mira and Benton with 
golfball-sized hail. The weather service clocked winds at Mira at 62 m.p.h. At 
the state prison in Parchman, Miss., a corrections officer suffered a broken 
leg when the watchtower she was in collapsed in high winds, officials said. A 
second guard suffered a minor injury. About 80 staff homes and three mobile 
homes were damaged.

OIL FIRM NAMED IN PROBE OF UNPAID INDIAN ROYALTIES

Investigators implicated a Kansas-based oil company Tuesday in testimony before 
a Senate panel that is checking allegations of millions of dollars in oil and 
royalties being stolen from Indians. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators told a special unit of the Senate Select Committee on Indian 
Affairs that Koch Industries, which does a large amount of business on Indian 
oil fields, over the last three years consistently took hundreds of thousands 
more barrels of crude oil than it paid for. 
</P>
<P>
But Donald L. Cordes, Koch Industries vice president for legal and corporate 
affairs, said the Senate panel did not reveal that the so-called overages were 
a small percentage of the total oil that the company buys and resells. 
</P>
<P>
A certain amount of inaccurate measuring is normal in the industry, but not to 
the degree shown in documents subpoenaed from Koch, witnesses told committee 
members. 
</P>
<P>
The documents indicated that Koch ended 1986 with 803,874 more barrels of oil 
than it paid for; 1987 with 671,144 more barrels, and 1988 with 474,281 more 
barrels. The value of the extra oil for the three years was estimated at $12.2 
million, $11.9 million and $7.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Most companies try to be as accurate as possible," said Chris Tucker, an oil 
expert who investigated Koch. "If there are large overages, the company should 
figure out why this is happening." 
</P>
<P>
A Senate panel spokesman said a brother of Koch Industries' chairman, Charles 
G. Koch, hired Tucker to investigate the company. The two brothers had 
quarreled, the spokesman indicated. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very easy to steal from Indian lands," Tucker said. "There are no checks 
and balances." 
</P>
<P>
He and other witnesses said the fields are in remote areas and are not 
generally watched. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Norman, an investigator for the committee, said other oil firms also were 
being probed. He said information about them would be turned over to 
authorities.

SENATORS URGE BUSH TO ACT ON GLOBAL WARMING

<P>
Senators from both parties pressed President Bush on Tuesday to reverse the 
Administration's decision not to seek an international convention to deal with 
the threat of global warming. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not too late to act," Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R.I.) said in a letter 
urging Bush to issue new instructions to U.S. delegates to an intergovernmental 
group scheduled to meet in Geneva today. Chafee is the ranking Republican on 
the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Chafee said the convention proposal, which is supported by the Environmental 
Protection Agency and the State Department, is one of the "bold, new 
initiatives" that can "bolster your reputation as an environmental President." 
</P>
<P>
A separate letter, circulated by Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.) and signed by 
12 Democrats and one Republican, Sen. John Heinz of Pennsylvania, called the 
meeting a "unique opportunity" to demonstrate leadership on environmental 
issues and urged the Administration to join other Western economic powers in 
supporting a convention on global warming. 
</P>
<P>
A White House spokesman said he had not seen the Chafee letter. On Monday, a 
spokesman confirmed that the Office of Management and Budget had altered a top 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration scientist's congressional 
testimony on the so-called greenhouse effect, weakening its conclusion that 
enough is known about the phenomenon to warrant immediate action. 
</P>
<P>
The White House defended the editing as an effort to avoid the appearance of 
policy disagreements in the Administration. The scientist, James E. Hansen, 
director of the Goddard Institute of Space Studies, said the changes amounted 
to altering scientific conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
The episode is the latest stumble for an Administration already under fire for 
a policy-making style that critics say relies on reaction instead of direction. 
In the case of global warming, it also involves an issue that candidate Bush 
chose to distinguish himself from his predecessor. "As President," he said 
during the campaign, "I intend to do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
The central problem, according to Administration officials, is that there is no 
consensus on what to do. The dissension surfaced last week, when White House 
officials rejected proposals from the EPA and State Department to use this 
week's meeting in Geneva as a steppingstone to an international convention. 
</P>
<P>
EPA and State Department officials envisioned a process similar to the one that 
led to an international protocol to reduce the use of chlorofluorocarbons, 
chemicals that scientists say are destroying stratospheric ozone.

<P>
Government supporters beat opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara 
on the head with an iron bar during anti-government demonstrations today, 
knocking him unconscious, witnesses and Endara said. 
</P>
<P>
Endara said members of a "dignity battalion," paramilitary groups commonly 
considered to have been set up and run by de facto ruler Gen. Manuel Noriega, 
attacked him during an altercation between opposition activists and crowds of 
government supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"They hit me on the head with an iron bar. . . . I completely lost 
consciousness. I have just recovered it," Endara, who was bleeding profusely 
from the head, said when his bodyguards brought him to the downtown hotel where 
he has set up post-election headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Shots were fired in the lobby of the hotel as Endara was speaking to 
journalists and his bodyguards immediately rushed him to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred as Endara was leading an opposition convoy through downtown 
Panama City along with his two vice-presidential running mates. 
</P>
<P>
Endara said he did not know what happened to his running mates, Ricardo Arias 
Calderon and Guillermo Ford. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the people who attacked the Endara convoy were backed and 
protected by riot police, who earlier in the afternoon used shotguns, tear gas 
and water cannons to break up an opposition demonstration for the second time 
since disputed weekend elections. 
</P>
<P>
There were reports of shootings and violent skirmishes across the city today. 
</P>
<P>
As the disturbances took place, there were new delays in the release of the 
government's official election results, which were showing the government 
candidate picked by Noriega, Carlos Duque, 59, leading Endara, 53, by 2-to-1. 
</P>
<P>
Endara claims to have won 75% of the vote in the election Sunday and 
international observers charged the government rigged the election and the 
official vote totals are fraudulent. 
</P>
<P>
The clashes in downtown Panama City began as Endara and his running mates drove 
down the capital's main shopping avenue and were enthusiastically cheered by 
supporters and onlookers. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the demonstration began, riot police began firing shotguns into 
the air and using high-pressure water cannons to disperse the opposition 
supporters.

BRADLEY TELLS CITY COUNCIL HE ERRED BUT BROKE NO LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley, in an extraordinary public admission, told a stunned City 
Council today that he made "an error in judgment" in creating the appearance of 
a conflict of interest between his personal finances and his mayoral actions, 
but he insisted that he will be exonerated by pending investigations into his 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"I was insensitive not to realize that accepting outside employment can create 
the perceptions we see today," said Bradley, making his comments under the 
glare of a battery of television cameras in a hastily arranged appearance in 
the council's ornate chamber. 
</P>
<P>
"In retrospect, my decision to engage in outside employment was a mistake 
because of the perceptions it created. I now recognize that error and will 
always regret it. 
</P>
<P>
"I am certain," the mayor added, "that the inquiry will conclude that I 
violated no laws." 
</P>
<P>
The two-minute public statement, which Bradley aides said the mayor had been 
mulling over for a week, was meant to blunt the political damage mounting daily 
because of the raft of investigations surrounding the mayor. Council members 
were told of the pending statement less than half an hour before Bradley 
delivered it, and the mayor refused to answer questions afterward. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Few Personal Words' 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the members, whose good will Bradley was clearly courting with what 
he termed "a few personal words" about the controversy, expressed sharply mixed 
reactions. Council members Robert Farrell and Joel Wachs rose in a standing 
ovation as Bradley marched from the council chamber, but other influential 
members discounted the mayor's address. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it was clear enough; I don't think it was convincing enough," 
said Councilwoman Gloria Molina, a member of the council's Governmental 
Operations Committee, which is overseeing City Atty. James K. Hahn's probe of 
the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Mike Woo, who heads the committee, offered a similar assessment. "We 
still need to find out what the facts are," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley faces four separate investigations into his conduct. Hahn's probe, 
which is expected to continue for months, centers on Bradley's financial 
relationships with two local institutions. The Far East National Bank last year 
awarded Bradley $18,000 to serve as the only paid member of its advisory board. 
The second firm, Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan, had paid Bradley up to 
$24,000 a year since 1978 to serve as a director. 
</P>
<P>
Both were doing business with the city during the time they employed the mayor. 
Bradley initially denied knowing of the connection, but documents released in 
recent weeks have indicated that Bradley knew Far East held city accounts. 
Bradley also voted on measures affecting Valley Federal subsidiaries before he 
left the board earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor also faces probes by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the 
Fair Political Practices Commission, which has launched two investigations of 
the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
In his admission of error, Bradley specifically apologized for accepting fees 
from outside firms -- a practice that, as the mayor noted, is allowed under the 
City Charter. He did not, however, address the central issue of the controversy 
-- the allegations that Bradley improperly consulted with city officials 
regarding the firms and took actions benefiting those who paid him fees. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's top aide, Deputy Mayor Mike Gage, said the omission was intentional. 
</P>
<P>
"He considers the taking of outside employment to be his error in judgment 
because of the perception that it created -- not because of his actions," Gage 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gage said Bradley's decision to publicly address the matter came after much 
deliberation, and acknowledged that, in the minds of some city officials, was 
considered belated. 
</P>
<P>
"I think any person has difficulty admitting they made an error of judgment," 
Gage said of the timing.

ONE-DAY TEACHERS' STRIKE CRIPPLES ANAHEIM SCHOOLS; 
</P>
<P>
CYPRESS HARDEST HIT IN WALKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A one-day strike by teachers in the 20,000-student Anaheim Union High School 
District crippled intermediate and high instruction from Anaheim to Cypress 
today as 77% of teachers and 46% of students stayed away from class, according 
to district figures. 
</P>
<P>
District administrators dispatched about 600 substitute teachers to its 21 
campuses, where 665 regularly assigned teachers failed to appear in the 
district's first strike in its history. 
</P>
<P>
On high school campuses in particular, student attendance was low, and it 
dwindled even further as the day progressed. 
</P>
<P>
A district spokesman assured parents that students were being properly 
supervised. 
</P>
<P>
Hardest hit was Cypress High School, where only six of the usual 56-teacher 
staff arrived for work, district officials reported. Only 431 of 1,019 students 
were on campus for first-period roll call. And by 11:15 a.m., about half of 
those students had left. 
</P>
<P>
At Western High School in Anaheim, about 200 students walked off campus during 
second period, some of them carrying homemade signs supporting the teachers' 
strike on the statewide "Day of the Teacher." 
</P>
<P>
"They'll probably suspend us, but they can't suspend everybody," said Ginny 
Hard, a 16-year-old junior. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mood of Pickets Cheerful 
</P>
<P>
The mood on the picket lines was cheerful as teachers reveled in the strike 
turnout. About 82% of teachers belonging to the Anaheim Secondary Teachers 
Assn. had voted to strike for one day after salary negotiations with the 
district administration reached an impasse. An estimated 87% stayed away from 
their jobs today. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers have worked without a contract since August and are demanding 
guaranteed pay raises. District officials say more than a decade of shrinking 
enrollment and rising costs have led to budget deficits, making them unable to 
guarantee raises. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time we've ever had a strike, and you have an overwhelming 
participation," said Leonard Lahtinen, president of the teachers union. "It 
should send a message to the district." 
</P>
<P>
"Any strike is a setback," Assistant Supt. LeRoy Kellogg said. "There is no 
winner." 
</P>
<P>
At Orangeview Junior High School in Anaheim, designated as a staging area for 
dispatching substitute teachers, district officials had four school buses 
standing by to ferry replacements to their campuses if they were uneasy about 
crossing picket lines. But by the time classes began, none had been used. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Security Guards Hired 
</P>
<P>
Security guards were also hired to stand by in parking lots in case there were 
confrontations. School administrators stood just inside school boundaries at 
some schools to watch for trouble, but none was reported during the morning. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers carried picket signs and occasionally cheered and shouted at 
substitute teachers. They were greeted by students on the way to school, many 
of whom shouted encouragement to the strikers. 
</P>
<P>
The district's Board of Trustees had voted to dock absent teachers today's 
wages unless they could document illness. They also threatened to consider 
absent students as truant. At Western High School, administrators were 
videotaping students as they walked off campus, a student reported.

ASSEMBLYMAN LEWIS TOLD TO STAND TRIAL SEPT. 25 IN REAGAN FORGERY

<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge today ordered Republican Assemblyman John R. Lewis of 
Orange to stand trial Sept. 25 on charges of forging former President Ronald 
Reagan's name on campaign endorsement letters mailed to California voters in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who was indicted Feb. 6 by the Sacramento County Grand Jury, waived his 
right to a preliminary examination before trial. 
</P>
<P>
His attorney, Clyde M. Blackmon, said Lewis decided to proceed directly to 
trial because the "prospects were not good" of a judge's dismissing the case at 
a preliminary hearing. At such a hearing, the judge, to sustain the charges, 
must find only that there is "probable cause" to believe that a crime has been 
committed. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis' lawyer and the deputy attorney general prosecuting the case had agreed 
tentatively to start the trial Sept. 8, but delayed it two weeks so that Lewis 
could be present in the Legislature for the end of the first half of the 
1989-1990 session. 
</P>
<P>
Blackmon said he also plans to introduce motions by May 30 asking that the 
charges be dismissed against Lewis, who pleaded not guilty at his arraignment 
last week. Blackmon contends that state forgery laws do not apply because Lewis 
did not intend to defraud anyone of money or property.

HIRED KIDNAPER OF BOY GETS 15 YEARS

<P>
A man was sentenced today to 15 years in state prison for kidnaping a baby boy 
from his adoptive parents in Pacific Palisades and flying him cross-country to 
his natural parents in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge John Reid imposed the maximum sentence on Jonathan Cosby, 
29, convicted in March of a single kidnaping count with a special allegation 
that he was armed with a shotgun when he abducted the 13-month-old boy in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeanette Bernstein said the baby's natural parents, Francis 
Kiefer, 42, and his wife, Bonnie, 43, of Moorestown, N.J., hired Cosby to 
kidnap their son from the boy's adoptive parents, Kenneth and Barbara Smith of 
Pacific Palisades.

Solidarity, fighting its first parliamentary election campaign in 
Communist-ruled Poland, said today that it found an electronic bugging device 
in a regional election headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a Watergate," Solidarity official Jacek Moskwa told reporters of the 
discovery Tuesday in the northern city of Slupsk. But he said authorities at 
first refused to investigate the bugging. "We informed the prosecutor and 
police but they refused to investigate. We notified the Interior Ministry 
overnight," Moskwa told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
But the police began investigating this morning after Solidarity contacted the 
ministry.

Richard R. Green, the city's first black schools chancellor whose much-heralded 
arrival last year from Minneapolis brought new hope to the nation's biggest 
school system, died today of asthma-related causes. He was 52. 
</P>
<P>
Green was brought to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center suffering from acute 
respiratory arrest and died 40 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
Green took over the troubled million-student system in March, 1988, after a 
long and bitter selection process that pitted him against the favorite of the 
teachers union. 
</P>
<P>
As an outsider from Minneapolis, where he served seven years as school 
superintendent and was widely credited with turning around a failing system, 
Green offered hope for new approaches for a school system plagued with a high 
dropout rate, crumbling buildings and a politically combative hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
But he soon found himself contending with reports of drug abuse, theft and 
sexual misconduct by teachers, principals and school board officials. In 
response to the scandals, he suspended two community school boards.

Authorities today arrested the former head of a West German company at the 
center of a scandal involving a suspected chemical weapons plant in Libya. 
</P>
<P>
West German and U.S. authorities alleged that the company, Imhausen-Chemie, was 
the key supplier of material for the plant in the Libyan city of Rabta. Libya 
claimed that the plant was for making pharmaceuticals, but U.S. and West German 
officials claim that it was intended to manufacture chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen, who was chief of Imhausen-Chemie until March, was 
arrested in the city of Bochum, said prosecutor Holger Preisendanz, who is 
leading the probe into the case. Hippenstiel-Imhausen is "strongly suspected" 
of violating West German export laws, Preisendanz said. Authorities were 
concerned that Hippenstiel-Imhausen may have been preparing to flee West 
Germany.

The World Health Organization annual assembly voted by a slim majority today to 
postpone debate by 48 hours on a divisive Palestinian bid for membership in the 
U.N. agency. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has warned that it will immediately cease all payments to the 
agency if Palestinian observer status is changed to that of member state 
"Palestine." 
</P>
<P>
Austria, seconded by Canada, proposed a 48-hour delay until Friday to give 
delegations time to consult their governments and try in private negotiations 
to find a compromise on deferring the issue until next year. Fifty-six of the 
160 nations attending the conference voted in favor of postponing debate, while 
47 opposed it and 20 abstained. The remainder did not take part in the vote.

Syrian gunners blasted the presidential palace, army headquarters and the U.S. 
ambassador's residence with mortar fire today. 
</P>
<P>
Gunmen stormed the central prison in Muslim West Beirut, freeing 189 convicts. 
A special squad of police, armed with M-16 assault rifles, recaptured 95 of 
them despite shellfire across the divided city, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said 10 people were killed and 89 wounded in today's duels between the 
Christian army units of Gen. Michel Aoun and their Syrian and Druze militia 
foes. 
</P>
<P>
That raised the overall toll to 337 people killed and 1,323 wounded since the 
latest round of fighting, believed to be the most destructive of Lebanon's 
14-year-old civil war, erupted March 8. 
</P>
<P>
Within an hour, 60 rounds, mostly 240-millimeter mortars, struck the palace in 
the Christian suburb of Baabda and the nearby Defense Ministry in Yarze, where 
Aoun has his headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Only the Syrian army possesses such weapons in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"They've decided to demolish both facilities," a military spokesman said by 
telephone from underground shelters at the Defense Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
"Our gunners are responding to silence the source of fire," he said, insisting 
on anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Aides said Aoun, 53, his wife and three daughters have been living in a shelter 
at the palace. 
</P>
<P>
"Damage was considerable, but we cannot really give a more precise assessment 
because we have all been living in the bunker for four days," an official at 
the presidential palace said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy said Ambassador John McCarthy's two-story villa was hit, but 
there were no casualties. McCarthy and his family are abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Tank clashes escalated into a savage shelling of Christian and Muslim 
residential districts about midnight, the police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Both sides were using the population as their shield," the spokesman said. He 
cannot be named under standing police rules. 
</P>
<P>
Ambulance sirens and thuds from exploding shells echoed across the city until 
the fighting slackened three hours later.

U.S., SOVIETS TO RESUME NUCLEAR TALKS;

<P>
The United States and the Soviet Union will resume negotiations on strategic 
nuclear arms reductions in mid-June, a Soviet spokesman announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Gennady I. Gerasimov, spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry, said the 
agreement was reached during the first day of talks between visiting U.S. 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze. 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov said the next round of talks on nuclear and space weapons will 
probably resume in Geneva either June 12 or June 19 and last for six weeks. He 
said that the Soviets had wanted the negotiations to begin again in May but 
that the Americans demurred. 
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. side explained that Richard Burt, who has been nominated by 
President George Bush to head the U.S. bargaining team, probably would not be 
confirmed by the U.S. Senate in time to resume talks this month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Regional Issues 
</P>
<P>
The two leaders met for almost three hours today after Baker's arrival from 
Helsinki for his visit to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The discussions began with regional issues, such as the Middle East and 
Afghanistan, and included arms control, human rights, regional problems and 
direct U.S.-Soviet relations. 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov said the subject of short-range missiles in Europe, which has caused 
a rift in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, did not come up today. 
</P>
<P>
He had told reporters earlier that at the request of the U.S. side, Baker and 
Shevardnadze concentrated on regional conflicts, rather than nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Last of the Cold War' 
</P>
<P>
"Dealing with regional problems will enable us to get the last of the Cold War 
behind us and move into a new stage of our relationship," Gerasimov said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased with the way things started," said Baker, who is making 
his first trip to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides found common ground on Central America, Gerasimov said. "Both 
sides stated there was good potential for a furthering of dialogue on a Central 
American settlement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker wants the Soviets to curb their aid to the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, 
which amounted to $500 million last year. The Soviets also raised the subject 
of Afghanistan, which Baker had no intention of bringing up because the Kremlin 
is demanding that the United States halt its military aid to Afghan rebels. 
</P>
<P>
According to Gerasimov, Baker and Shevardnadze also discussed U.S. Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney's prediction that perestroika, the restructuring program 
of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, will fail. 
</P>
<P>
Baker explained that Cheney's remarks did not reflect Washington's official 
position and Shevardnadze did not take offense, Gerasimov said.

A man who offered money to two little girls to accompany him away from their 
homes was chased down and severely beaten by enraged parents, police said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Gamez, 26, of Tijuana offered the girls, one of them 6 years old, money 
to accompany him away from the Los Angeles apartment complex where they live, 
Sgt. Doug Tantee said. 
</P>
<P>
"The girls ran and told their parents, just as they should," Tantee said. A 
short time later, about 6 p.m. Tuesday, angry parents at the large apartment 
complex chased down Gamez and beat him, the sergeant said. Paramedics took 
Gamez to the jail ward at County-USC Medical Center, where doctors treated him 
for a broken jaw, blackened eyes and numerous cuts and bruises. He was booked 
on suspicion of child annoying.

The Swiss government unveiled plans today to outlaw money-laundering and 
prevent criminals abusing Swiss bank secrecy to dispose of their loot. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Arnold Koller said money-laundering should be made a crime 
punishable by up to five years in prison or a fine of $595,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Switzerland does not need dirty money," he told a press conference in Berne. 
"The government wants to make a contribution to the fight against drug 
trafficking, money-laundering and organized crime." 
</P>
<P>
Koller was outlining a bill that will be put before parliament this year. It 
could become law in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Switzerland has been criticized in recent years by police in other countries 
who say its bank secrecy laws make it a safe haven for the proceeds of crime. 
</P>
<P>
Koller said the new law would make it an offense for anyone to help to conceal 
the origin of money that he had reason to suspect was obtained through crime. 
</P>
<P>
It would also oblige banks to check the identity of the real beneficiaries of 
money or valuables deposited with them.

on Corp., under prodding from the Bush Administration, announced today that it 
plans to sharply increase the number of workers and ships cleaning spilled oil 
from more than 300 miles of Alaska shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner called the move "a substantial 
increase" in manpower and resources by Exxon and said it improves the 
likelihood that the oil company will meet its cleanup goals for this summer. 
Nevertheless, Skinner said, the cleanup effort might still have to be continued 
in the spring of 1990. Exxon said it is confident that it can clean the 
shoreline by September with the added manpower and ships. 
</P>
<P>
In a revised cleanup plan submitted to the Coast Guard, Exxon said it will 
increase the number of people involved in the summer cleanup from a previously 
planned 3,400 workers to 5,000. It also said it will bring in seven additional 
barges and 17 more landing craft, bringing the number of vessels to 70. 
</P>
<P>
The additional manpower and vessels "will allow the number of people directly 
employed on the battlefront -- on the shoreline -- to increase by over 1,000 
from 1,475 to 2,500," William D. Stevens, president of Exxon Co. U.S.A., said 
in a statement.

Avon Products Inc. said today it received a $39-a-share takeover proposal from 
Amway Corp., sending the stock price of the struggling door-to-door cosmetics 
company soaring. 
</P>
<P>
Amway, the home products company known for a zealous direct-sales force, said 
last week that it had acquired a 10.3% stake in Avon with a partner, 
Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
Avon -- a $3-billion company based in Ada, Mich., that has been hampered by a 
heavy debt load and a trickling cash flow -- said the proposal for an 
acquisition was made only by Amway. 
</P>
<P>
Avon shares were up $3.125 to $39.125 in heavy mid-afternoon trading on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Avon said the company, which earlier this week filed lawsuits 
seeking to block an unwanted takeover by Amway and Jacobs, had no immediate 
comment.

<P>
Hamleys, the swank British toy shop that has enchanted children and their 
parents for more than two centuries, has been sold, and its new owners plan to 
expand operations to the United States and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
British conglomerate Lowndes Queensway PLC said today that it had agreed to 
sell the store located on London's elegant Regent Street to Larchwood Ltd. of 
Britain for $36.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Hamleys' customers include Britain's Royal Family, the Sultan of Brunei and pop 
star Michael Jackson, who last year emerged from the shop with a 
radio-controlled toy truck. 
</P>
<P>
The shop was put up for sale last September, and some analysts said then that 
it could fetch up to $66 million. 
</P>
<P>
Larchwood, headed by brothers Tim and Duncan Chadwick, was formed as a 
toy-retailing company to incorporate Hamleys and Creative Toys Inc. of Beverly 
Hills, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
The Creative Toys operation is expected to be a springboard for expanding North 
American sales while marketing is stepped up in continental Europe and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Hamleys has been a part of London life since Cornishman William Hamley set up 
shop in 1760 selling rag dolls, tin soldiers, hoops and wooden horses. 
</P>
<P>
Cricket bats, footballs and model boats were introduced during the 19th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
Modern Hamleys' stock now includes big cuddly bears for $1,300 and a 
gasoline-driven miniature London taxi for $11,600. 
</P>
<P>
Lowndes acquired Hamleys, where children can choose from 25,000 different toys, 
in August last year when it took over its parent Harris Queensway PLC. 
</P>
<P>
Lowndes Chairman James Gulliver said his company will now concentrate on its 
carpet and furniture business.

JUDGE ACQUITS TAYLOR IN DRUNK DRIVING CASE

<P>
New York Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor was acquitted today of drunk driving 
charges stemming from a March arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"The justice system works, and I'm happy for myself," the eight-time All-Pro 
said as he emerged from the courtroom of Municipal Judge John Conte. 
</P>
<P>
Conte found Taylor innocent based on testimony from two doctors, who said they 
found that the NFL star suffered from food poisoning the night he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities alleged that Taylor was found sleeping at 3:30 a.m. March 24 behind 
the wheel of his Jeep, which was parked on the shoulder of the Garden State 
Parkway. He was charged with drunk driving despite his blood alcohol level 
reading being .09%, below the .10% level considered legally drunk in New 
Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Alan Lupinacci of West Paterson, one of two internists called as expert 
witnesses by Taylor's attorney, said the NFL star suffered from acute food 
poisoning, which caused him to vomit. 
</P>
<P>
He theorized that Taylor became sick from an organism contained in poorly 
prepared fettuccine Alfredo eaten on a flight from Atlanta to Newark the day 
before his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"It is medically known that this type of organism is found in cream sauces and 
can make a person present those symptoms," Lupinacci said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Taylor's attorney attempted to show that the arresting officer took 
the football star into custody based on assumptions made from previous arrests 
and not from the evidence obtained from Breathalyzer tests. 
</P>
<P>
Trooper Robert Pohida, who arrested Taylor, said he was surprised that the 
football star's breath test showed Taylor's blood alcohol level to be only 
.09%. 
</P>
<P>
"You expected the reading to be a lot higher?" asked James Acheson, Taylor's 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"That is correct," Pohida replied. 
</P>

The trooper said Taylor could not perform simple coordination tasks that are 
routinely administered to motorists who are suspected of driving while 
intoxicated. Some of the tests included reciting the alphabet and touching his 
index finger to his nose. 
</P>
<P>
Based upon the alcohol reading and the dexterity problems, the trooper 
suspected that Taylor may have been abusing drugs and ordered a urinalysis, 
Pohida said. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor has undergone drug rehabilitation twice in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted on the drunk driving charge, Taylor could have faced a fine and a 
loss of his driving privileges.

Top-seeded Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina overpowered Laura Golarsa of Italy 
6-2, 6-2 today to move into the third round of the $300,000 Italian Open 
women's tennis championships. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini, the defending champion who is ranked No. 3 in the world, overwhelmed 
the 81st-ranked Italian in just over one hour on the center court of the Foro 
Italico. 
</P>
<P>
After the two held serve in the first four games, Sabatini took charge, running 
off the next four games for the set while dropping just 2 points. 
</P>
<P>
Golarsa broke serve in the first game of the second set, but Sabatini broke 
right back and cruised the rest of the way as she controlled the tempo with her 
heavy top-spin ground strokes. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini, who had received a first-round bye, will meet another unheralded 
Italian, Laura Lapi, in the third round of what appears to be an easy path to 
the final. 
</P>
<P>
In other matches today, 10th-seeded Bettina Fulco downed Celine Cohen of 
Switzerland 6-4, 6-2; No. 12 Isabelle Demongeot of France swept past Marzia 
Grossi of Italy 6-4, 6-1, and No. 13 Barbara Paulus of Austria beat Amanda 
Coetzer of South Africa 6-2, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
In Hamburg, West Germany, meanwhile, two-time Wimbledon champion Boris Becker 
of West Germany defeated Javier Sanchez of Spain 6-1, 6-3 today to advance to 
the third round of the $692,000 German Open tennis tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Top-ranked Ivan Lendl of Czechoslovakia also advanced.

The Blue Jays, held hitless for eight innings by Seattle's Mark Langston, 
rallied for three runs in the ninth today and beat the Mariners 3-2, with 
George Bell driving in the winning run with a bloop single off reliever Mike 
Schooler. 
</P>
<P>
Langston had shackled the Blue Jays through the first eight innings, allowing 
only one baserunner, on shortstop Omar Vizquel's error in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
But in the ninth, Langston unraveled quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Lawless, pinch-hitting for Lloyd Moseby, led off the inning with a solid 
single to center, ending Langston's chance to become the first Seattle pitcher 
to hurl a no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
After Nelson Liriano sacrificed Lawless to second, Bob Brenly, batting for Rob 
Ducey, doubled down the left field line, scoring Lawless and ending Langston's 
shutout. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Felix then tied the score 2-2 with an RBI single to center, driving in 
pinch-runner Alexis Infante. Felix went to second on the throw to the plate, 
and Langston was replaced by Schooler. 
</P>
<P>
Schooler retired Kelly Gruber on a grounder to third and intentionally walked 
Tony Fernandez to pitch to the slumping Bell.
