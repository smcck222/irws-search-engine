AL MARTINEZ: A CITY IN SEARCH OF A PIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ

<TEXT>
<P>
I have been searching for a consistent moral standard in L.A. by asking people 
how they feel about pornography. Two were for it, three against it and one said 
she wouldn't talk dirty with a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
Of the two for it, one was a television producer and the other an autistic 
savant who could name dirty movies back to the time Hedy Lamar appeared nude in 
the film "Ecstasy." 
</P>
<P>
The reason I went out searching for some kind of moral level was a ruling last 
week by Judge David Kenyon that there is no obvious community standard in L.A. 
regarding moral filth. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he threw out a case against a distributor of adult videos. How can 
you judge a film to be pornographic, he asked, when everyone has a different 
idea of what pornography is? 
</P>
<P>
Size has a lot to do with it. In Argonia, Kan., for instance, with its 
population of 591, it would be easy to set a standard by declaring that 
anything your mother wouldn't approve of is dirty, and those who don't agree 
with that get out. 
</P>
<P>
But in Los Angeles, with its 13 million drifting souls, some of whose mothers 
are topless dancers, taste varies to such a degree that what is slime to some 
is chicken soup to others. 
</P>
<P>
One of those I spoke with in pursuit of a definition was the Rev. Jess Moody, 
pastor of the First Baptist Church of Van Nuys and God's best friend in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
A wily Texan who has parlayed down-home charm and an Oxford education into 
leadership of 10,000 parishioners, Jess once claimed to have discussed with God 
the possibility of moving his church from Van Nuys to Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
God said go for it, but the neighbors raised such hell that God changed his 
mind and said maybe you shouldn't go for it. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who has talked to God, however, is worth listening to, so I asked Jess 
how he felt about moral filth. Asking a pastor how he feels about smut is like 
asking a cat how he feels about being chased by a dog. While the dog might 
consider it fun, it's not going to please the cat. 
</P>
<P>
Jess came at me quoting the Bible, the Supreme Court, three teachers, a writer 
and his daddy to support his argument that Judge Kenyon should have set the 
community standard himself rather than leaving it up to the people. 
</P>
<P>
"The man is a free-floating relativist," Moody declared with just enough fire 
and brimstone in his voice to indicate he was not fooling around. "He ought to 
be a ticket-taker at Dodger Stadium." 
</P>
<P>
I was about to ask what a relativist was, but you don't goad a preacher on the 
pulpit. Anyhow, he was beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what you get when you let people decide the law?" he demanded. "You 
get Jesus crucified and Plato forced to take Hemlock." 
</P>
<P>
He defined Californians as not being discriminating when it comes to 
pornography. Too many of us like it. 
</P>
<P>
"He who digs a pit will fall into it," Jess said quoting from the Book of 
Proverbs. Then he added cheerfully, "That ought to hold you for awhile." 
</P>
<P>
I don't want to say anything to upset the ACLU and, God knows, I'd rather die 
than appear unhip, but there does seem to be a lot of hot sex going on and it 
isn't very subtle. 
</P>
<P>
At one time, for instance, a movie, to indicate human fornication, would 
portray a man and a woman in decent swimming attire kissing on a beach and then 
pan away to sea gulls when the breathing got heavy. 
</P>
<P>
Violins played while the sea gulls soared and sometime there was brass section 
fortissimo at the proper moment, but that was generally that. 
</P>
<P>
Now the camera dollies in for the kind of tight shots that would make a gunnery 
sergeant blush and follows the couple scene after scene as they repeat the 
performance on a roller coaster, a kitchen table, halfway up the steps of the 
Jefferson Memorial and in the middle of the Piazza San Pietro. 
</P>
<P>
And that's just the R-rated stuff. Take the same scenes, add horses, whips, 
handcuffs and a guillotine and you've got what the porn kings are peddling on 
videotape. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Kenyon and Jess Moody are both a little bit right. I agree that Mom may 
not be capable of setting a single moral standard for L.A., but it does seem to 
me we ought to be panning away to the sea gulls at least once in awhile.

No blackouts have occurred in Temple City in recent days, indicating perhaps 
that the Attack of the Electrical Wire-Munching Ants may have come to an end. 
</P>
<P>
But Temple City, known more for such sedate events as an annual Camellia 
Festival, is still reeling from the publicity over the hungry critters that 
knocked out some intersection traffic signals. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe this made nationwide news," said Public Works Director Chris 
Peterson. "A lot of other cities around here have had worse problems with them 
(the ants). " 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said he's even heard from callers from as far away as Utah and Alabama 
who have ant cures. (Public Works has its own ant poison recipe.) 
</P>
<P>
Nor did the San Gabriel Valley consider it a public relations coup when 
syndicated broadcaster Paul Harvey commented that millions of Temple City ants 
were enjoying "a power lunch." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Paar, the former Tonight Show host, related in his autobiography that he 
was approached by the late Duchess of Windsor at a cocktail party in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you tell me," she asked Paar, "is the Roller Derby fixed?" 
</P>
<P>
Paar didn't reveal his answer, but the Duchess' interest illustrated the 
popularity of the team-roller skating spectacle, which was one of the first 
network television hits for ABC. 
</P>
<P>
A spin-off of indoor bicycle racing dating back to 1935, the sport -- as it is 
called by some -- enjoyed its heyday in Los Angeles in the 1960s with announcer 
Dick ("Whoaaa Nellie!") Lane exclaiming over the high jinks of such 
unforgettable performers as Psycho Ronnie Rains, Shirley Hardman and Little 
Ralphie Vallidares. 
</P>
<P>
But more recently, while wrestling was enjoying a big revival, Roller Derby 
took an elbow to the neck, ratings-wise. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Roller Games -- as it's known for legal reasons -- is attempting a 
comeback. The sport's promoters held a tryout for a projected television show 
that drew 250 candidates to the Moonlight Roller Skating Rink in Glendale on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The winners will be distributed among six new teams named, the Thunderbirds, 
the Violators, Hot Flash, the Rockers, the Maniacs, and the club that figures 
to lead the league in villains -- the Attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
Kraco, a Sherman Oaks-based automotive electronics firm, announced this week 
that it's conducting its second annual search for the driver who logs the most 
miles round-trip daily between home and work. The weary soul will win a variety 
of prizes. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, believe it or not, a non-Southern Californian ranked No. 1 -- Rod 
Conklin, who slogged 408 miles between his digs in Darien, Conn., and his job 
in Boston. Conklin, perhaps to save his sanity, has switched to a shorter 
commute. 
</P>
<P>
Kraco could have been a bit more sensitive in timing its announcement. After 
all, this is Bike to Work Week.

POSITIVE IMAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Americans don't care so much about what something is, as long as what it is 
called presents a positive image. 
</P>
<P>
Thus "Chinese gooseberries" became Kiwi fruit when introduced into the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
The janitor became a "sanitation engineer." 
</P>
<P>
A variety of salesmen became "consultants." 
</P>
<P>
Rebel guerrillas became "freedom fighters." 
</P>
<P>
And, most recently, we began reducing the rhetoric about tax increases by 
calling them "revenue enhancements." 
</P>
<P>
Hence, on the theory that almost any unyielding problem can be solved by 
describing it in positive terms. I suggest the following examples: 
</P>
<P>
The homeless -- "outdoorsmen." 
</P>
<P>
A beggar -- "funds solicitor." 
</P>
<P>
Inside trader -- "knowledgeable investor." 
</P>
<P>
A massive layoff -- "rigid expense control program." 
</P>
<P>
Living below poverty level -- "living life according to its essential 
priorities." 
</P>
<P>
AK-47 -- "Sporting rifle." 
</P>
<P>
Traffic gridlock -- "Highway speed control." 
</P>
<P>
Busting up a company -- "restructuring." 
</P>
<P>
These took a few minutes to think up. Undoubtedly everyone who reads this will 
be able to develop his or her own list without too much effort.

KISSINGER ON EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his column "Untangling Alliances" (Opinion, April 16) Henry Kissinger 
rightly focuses on the need to enunciate a vision for a new Europe. But he goes 
too far too fast in proposing that the European Community be transformed into a 
common European House absent the U.S. and the Soviet Union. And he is wrong in 
suggesting a security framework which would lower the nuclear threshold. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, U.S. policy aims at ending the artificial division of Europe and not 
"unifying" it. This is more than a semantic distinction. It is neither possible 
nor desirable to achieve the economic integration of Eastern and Western Europe 
in the short run, given the vast difference in the economic institutions which 
have taken root on both sides of the Iron Curtain. The European Community is 
hardly able to accommodate the differences among its own members as it moves 
towards 1992, and admitting Turkey is a daunting task. Imagine the dislocations 
which would result from taking on the structural problems of Poland or Romania! 
</P>
<P>
From the political point of view, the concept of a unified Europe must 
necessarily be based on the reunification of Germany, which is exactly what 
Kissinger wants to avoid. In fact, the continued division of Germany is in the 
interest of both East and West, and the FRG's economic support for the GDR is 
designed, in part, to help preserve that division, elevating the East German 
standard of living without the kind of structural reform which could bring 
reunification closer. A confidential dialogue with the Russians would probably 
establish the fact that German reunification should be the last problem on the 
East-West agenda. 
</P>
<P>
"Reuniting" Europe is not essential to end its artificial division. Freedom of 
movement of people and ideas, increased autonomy for the region's governments, 
democratization and the restoration of Western cultural values will produce a 
freer, more stable and diverse Eastern Europe, whether or not Soviet troops 
remain there. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of a more secure Europe, free of artificially-imposed division, should 
not be pursued through a confidential dialogue between the U.S. and the 
Soviets. Neither East nor West Europeans want these issues discussed over their 
heads.

MILKEN AND TAKEOVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My thanks to Robert A. Jones for clarifying the debate surrounding Michael 
Milken and the ethics of corporate takeovers ("Feeding Frenzy in the Redwoods," 
Part I, April 25). 
</P>
<P>
It's been hard to refute the appealing argument that junk bonds provide 
entrepreneurs with the means to buy out ineffective companies, replace their 
fossilized management, shed unproductive assets, etc. 
</P>
<P>
But the experience of Pacific Lumber Co. shows that Milken's methods for 
financing this activity do not result in a healthy renewal of the national 
economic body. It is, rather, a form of cancer, an uncontrolled growth that too 
often destroys healthy, sustainable, local economies. The result is not greater 
productivity, but the simple transfer of wealth from local communities to 
professional investors. 
</P>
<P>
Milken isn't entirely to blame for this, but he deserves no sympathy from those 
who care about the long-term future of this nation.

MILKEN AND TAKEOVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jones' column overviewing the takeover of a lumber mill and subsequent disdain 
for the employees and rape of the environment is typical of the results of 
LBOs. 
</P>
<P>
History does not support that LBOs result in more efficient and competitive 
companies benefiting employees, stockholders and the general economy. Were that 
the case, our country would begin building better quality products and 
generating more innovative ideas for the marketplace through research and 
development. 
</P>
<P>
The real motivation for LBOs is greed. But this greed is not limited to the 
Milken variety of predator. They take full advantage of the greed of senior 
executives who create golden parachutes while many employees lose their jobs, 
pensions and insurance. The stockholders' greed is evidenced by their desire 
for short-term profits. It is time we stopped hand-wringing about the rape of 
our industries and begin taking action. 
</P>
<P>
ESOP is one method of getting involved as the lumber company employees hope to 
accomplish by buying back their company. Stockholders should profit on their 
investment but why not help by getting more involved. Ask questions about the 
company's ability to compete by turning out a better quality product. Is it 
making a long-range commitment to R&amp;D rather than an excessive concern with 
next quarter's earnings?

The Colleagues and their two support groups, Les Amies and C.H.I.P.S., are 
prepping for their 34th Glamour Sale from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday at the 
Santa Monica Civic Auditorium. President Marjory Miller and the three co-chairs 
-- Patsy Stecher, Katrina Cord and Margaret Vandegrift -- have been busily 
sorting Chanels, Adolfos and couture by Bill Blass, Oscar de la Renta and David 
Hayes. The 60 members hope to net more than $200,000 for Children's Institute 
International from sales of jewelry, antiques, furniture, art and clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, though, the Colleagues were feted when Gianmaria Buccellati and his 
wife, Rosie, and his handsome offspring darted into Beverly Hills to open their 
French paneled jewelry salon at the Regent Beverly Wilshire, amidst teas and 
black-tie dinners. 
</P>
<P>
The Colleagues got the bid for dinner. Elegant it was with Buccellati handmade 
silver pheasants and seals and gold flowers set among the centerpieces on 
Italian linens. In the swank crowd: Marilyn McDaniel, Joan and John Hotchkis, 
Erlenne and Dr. Norman Sprague, Gen. Gywnn and Natalie Robinson, Onnalee and 
William Doheny, Amen Wardy, Ann and Frank Johnson, Patricia Sheinbaum, Giney 
Milner, Flora Thornton, Italian Consul General Alberto and Suzy Boniver.

SPECIAL MOMENTS: The 700 guests were dazzled with some special moments the 
other evening at the French Foundation for Alzheimer Research fifth anniversary 
gala at the Beverly Hilton. The foundation's Founding Associates hosted the 
event. Gala chairman Bonnie Green and Dorothy Kirsten French, founder of the 
foundation (and the wife of the late John Douglas French, who died recently 
after years with Alzheimer's), proudly revealed an estimated net of $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Dudley Moore at the piano was extraordinarily funny, as was Norm Crosby with 
his malapropisms ("Mothers should be put on a pedestrian"). Pia Zadora was the 
finale, bringing on her 4-year-old, Katie (she wants to be a rock star), for 
some songs and a deep bow. When host Alex Trebek joked that he had never been 
served such a generous portion of beef (some were asking for doggie bags), he 
noted that Marty Paseta was commenting, "My cholesterol is about 465 tonight 
after this." 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Kirsten French invited Sen. Pete and Gayle Wilson to sit with her, and 
at the same table were dinner chairman Roy and Betty Anderson. Adjacent were 
Richard and Eileen Eamer, big supporters, and their guests Lester and Carolbeth 
Korn. 
</P>
<P>
All night, Founding Associates chairman Catherine Chester moved non-stop on 
arrangements, and so did Betty Resnick and Genevieve McSweeney. In the crowd: 
Bill Siart, Hannah Carter, Dody and Otis Booth and Eleanor Wasson, who is 
moving to Santa Cruz soon. Guests left with favors -- little china heart-shaped 
dishes etched with forget-me-nots to tie in with the foundation's motto, 
"Forget not those who cannot remember." 
</P>
<P>

YOUR WHEELS: THERE'S NO GLOSSING OVER RUST PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I bought a new Honda Accord hatchback in 1985. About three years 
later, the car developed a rust problem on the roof. Honda agreed to pay for 
the repainting of the roof because of their 3-year rust guarantee. Within eight 
months, the rust had returned, but it was now at many different places on the 
car, including the door post frames, rear deck and passenger door. Honda agreed 
to pay for 50% of the repairs. How can they live up to their guarantee when it 
appears no repair is possible? What can be done? -- F.H. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Very possibly nothing can be done to fully restore your car's finish. 
It may be so damaged that only a complete paint stripping and repainting will 
help. That could nearly exceed the value of the car and then might not prevent 
a recurrence of the corrosion. 
</P>
<P>
Honda used a one-stage paint process for its white color in 1985, which means 
the car does not have a clear coat that is typically used with other colors in 
a two-stage paint system. 
</P>
<P>
The clear coat apparently offers significant protection against certain types 
of premature failure of the paint, assuming the paint was properly applied at 
the factory and the metal properly prepared for painting at the factory. 
</P>
<P>
If the metal was not properly prepared -- if there was corrosion on the metal 
before it was painted in Japan, for example -- then the rust developing now 
would likely be large spots measuring an eighth to a quarter of an inch in 
diameter, according to Ken Zion of Long Beach, an instructor in auto body 
repair at El Camino College and a consultant in auto body litigation. 
</P>
<P>
More likely, the paint has been attacked by some sort of atmospheric industrial 
fallout. Such fallout often contains particles of iron that embed themselves in 
the paint and then begin to rust. The rust occurs on the surface of the paint, 
but after a while it travels right through the paint and can begin rusting the 
sheet metal of the car. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ruined Paint Job 
</P>
<P>
At that point, you have a ruined paint job. Hondas aren't the only cars with 
such a problem, but the company recognizes that it does have such a problem, no 
matter what any dealer tries to say. The company has developed a wash, which it 
describes as an acid wash, that can remove the embedded particles of rust 
before they burn through the paint. Then, you must keep the paint clean and 
waxed to protect it from a recurrence. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is particularly severe in Los Angeles, where the air is foul and 
the sun is strong enough to literally bake fallout into the paint. If the car 
is parked near the beach, that compounds the entire problem because the salt 
air accelerates the corrosion. 
</P>
<P>
If the sheet metal of your Accord has begun to corrode, a paint job is going to 
be quite involved. The existing paint must be stripped to the bare metal before 
the car can be primed and painted. Based on conservative estimates, the 
stripping would cost about $1,500 and the repainting about $2,500, including a 
reasonable amount of disassembly of trim and body parts. You probably do not 
want to spend $4,000 on painting a 4-year-old car, or even $2,000 if you can 
get Honda to foot half the bill. 
</P>
<P>
One alternative is to accept the fact that your Accord is a lemon of sorts and 
make the best of it. For example, you could have the car painted on the cheap 
for under $100. It will not last long, but you could have it repainted every 
year for the next few years. It would be a lot cheaper and less risky than the 
$4,000 paint job that may not work either. 
</P>
<P>
But if you can't stomach an $89.95 paint special, you could sue Honda in small 
claims court for up to $2,000. Then you could take the $2,000 and spend it 
however you wished. If you go to court, you might want to consult an expert 
witness in auto body repair, such as Zion's Automotive Collision Consultants.

CONSUMER VIEWS: THE WOES OF A WITNESS FROM WAUKEGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON G. CAMPBELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I am writing this letter to you in hope you can help me in collecting 
my witness fees. 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1987, I was subpoenaed by the city attorney of Los Angeles to be a 
witness. Prior to this summons I was told that the city attorney would pay my 
expenses for coming to Los Angeles from Waukegan, Ill., to testify. 
</P>
<P>
After I submitted my expenses (for $1,575), the city attorney's office informed 
me that it would take from 6 to 10 weeks before I would receive my expense 
money. 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1988, I received from the Municipal Court of Los Angeles Judicial 
District a revised amount that would be paid. It was for $1,055, which I signed 
and returned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Check Arrives 
</P>
<P>
Finally, about four or five weeks ago, I received a check for $350. I called 
Mr. Pete Covette in the city attorney's office about the $350 and he stated 
that this was the amount that would be paid. How could I travel 4,300 miles 
(round trip), pay for seven nights' lodging ($20 a night) and eat three meals a 
day for $350? 
</P>
<P>
I am amazed by the misleading statements made to me. Mr. Covette claims he did 
not know anything about the revised amount issued by the Municipal Court. I 
sent a letter to the city attorney of Los Angeles on Oct., 24, 1988, in regard 
to this and he did not reply. I hope that the city attorney's office will not 
stonewall you if you pursue this for me. -- S.Z. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: As much as the Los Angeles city attorney's office appreciates witnesses 
coming back here to testify, its staff is the first to admit that no one ever 
got rich doing it. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Covette, the assistant supervisor for the West Los Angeles Branch of the 
city attorney's office and your principal contact here, regrets any 
misunderstanding but points out that fees and expenses for out-of-state 
witnesses are rigidly spelled out in the statutes (Penal Code, Section 1334.3). 
</P>
<P>
And, unless a judge personally intervenes, there's not much anyone in the city 
attorney's office can do about it. And the limits that the statute puts on 
surface travel expenses, as well as the per-diem expenses, obviously haven't 
been revised for lo, these many years: 10 cents a mile if the witness elects to 
use surface transportation and $20 per diem for other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The confusion, Covette feels, arose because, instead of flying out, you elected 
to drive here from Waukegan and billed the city for 20 cents a mile. There is a 
20-cent-per-mile provision in the statute, but it applies only to surface 
transportation (cabs or a rental car) used to get you to the airport back home, 
and to and from the airport here. 
</P>
<P>
Had you chosen to fly out (and that's what the lion's share of the witnesses 
do), the city would have picked up your round-trip air fare. And, because it 
turned out that your testimony wasn't needed anyway (the defendant entered a 
guilty plea), "We would have picked up his hotel bill until we could arrange 
for a return flight home," Covette adds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Visits Daughter 
</P>
<P>
According to the city attorney's records, you chose to drive out and spent the 
next three months visiting with your daughter, who lives near here. Covette and 
his office have no quarrel with that, nor with the eight days' per diem for 
which you billed the city. 
</P>
<P>
"His hotel and meal expenses for those eight days aren't very much out of line 
with our limits, anyway," Covette adds. But where the figures get skewed is in 
the computation of the mileage -- 4,300 miles at 10 cents a mile is $430 and 
you billed it at 20 cents a mile (the local rate), which is $860. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's assistant supervisor admits that the whole thing has taken 
far, far too long -- the person originally handling your case transferred out 
of the office, the case was temporarily dropped and then the since-settled case 
in which you were going to testify was assigned to a judge who didn't feel he 
had jurisdiction to rule on the expense matter. 
</P>
<P>
And, Covette concedes, the city does, indeed, still owe you some money, which 
he promises he will get to you posthaste. The city puts your actual expenses at 
$590, of which you've received $350. The other $240 will be along very shortly. 
</P>
<P>
This leaves one baffling aspect still unresolved: that mysterious revision from 
the Municipal Court of Los Angeles Judicial District, which scaled down your 
submitted bill of $1,575 to $1,055. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't find any record of such a revision, anywhere," Covette says, "and 
I've asked him several times to send me a copy of it -- it would certainly 
resolve the whole thing -- but he says he's lost it. And, without it, our hands 
are tied." 
</P>
<P>
You are right in one respect, of course: There's no cockeyed way in the world 
anyone could drive from Waukegan to Los Angeles at 10 cents a mile and break 
even on it. But, until somebody updates the statute to more realistic levels, 
that's what they are stuck with paying you. 
</P>
<P>
Philosophically, look at it this way: You had a nice, leisurely visit with your 
daughter and the City of Los Angeles, at least, picked up a token part of the 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I wanted to thank you ever so much for your recent article regarding my 
dilemma with Blue Cross. My enclosed letter from Blue Cross will indicate to 
you how effective your article was -- what my lawyer and the insurance 
department could not do, you accomplished. -- Z.A. 
</P>
<P>
A: All's well that ends well regardless of how it came about. The drastic 
cutback in the amount that Blue Cross would pay for your young son's required 
physical therapy struck me as an error of some sort, and it's encouraging to 
see that Blue Cross has gone back and reimbursed you for the two claims 
previously denied, and that it intends to honor all future therapy sessions for 
the boy at the agreed-upon 80% basis. I'm delighted that it worked out for you.

PAIN-FREE ARTHRITIS BY DVERA BERSON WITH SANDER ROY (S &amp; J BOOKS, P.O. BOX

When she reached her mid-60s, Berson had just about given up hope of a normal 
life. For years, she had struggled with crippling osteoarthritis, the most 
common form of arthritis. Her classic symptoms, caused by inflammation of the 
joints, were "excruciating pains in my neck, back, hands and lower body." Yes, 
she had "doctored" a lot and tried traditional medical treatment: eight 
Bufferins a day, orthopedic surgery, traction, even shots of cortisone. 
</P>
<P>
By chance, while vacationing in Florida, Berson began exercising in a large 
swimming pool. Slowly, she devised a series of hydrotherapeutic techniques that 
changed her from a semi-invalid into a tolerably active woman. 
</P>
<P>
Her "programme," forming the heart of this resourceful book, involves relaxing, 
stretching and strengthening muscles in a pool of about 80-85 degrees. Though 
Berson typically covers many laps during her sessions, she floats rather than 
swims. Photos make her regimen look balletic, but she makes it clear that 
moving painful joints is never easy. 
</P>
<P>
Among specific suggestions for arthritis sufferers are reassessing prescribed 
drugs and exercise. An expensive club membership isn't necessary; to try 
hydrotherapy on your own, you might contact your local YMCA. The book must be 
ordered direct from the publisher. Also queries about a videotape of the 
exercises should be sent to the publisher. ROSELLE M. LEWIS

WRONG TARGET IN THORP VS. BEAM?

<TEXT>
<P>
The lack of responsibility that the alcoholic Candance Thorp demonstrated both 
before and after the birth of her Fetal Alcohol Syndrome-afflicted son was 
disturbingly sad. By her own admission she sometimes drank herself unconscious 
during her pregnancy. It is apparent that a warning label on the drinker's 
whiskey bottle would not stop such irresponsible and reckless behavior.

WRONG TARGET IN THORP VS. BEAM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harold and Candance Thorp have joined the line-up of families trying to get the 
government, the tobacco companies, the auto manufacturers, and so on into the 
night, to pay for their own bad judgment. Like the people who tried to stop 
smoking, but couldn't, Candy Thorp went to alcohol treatment programs, but 
couldn't, or wouldn't, stop drinking. Is it possible that two adults in this 
society thought that drinking a quart of bourbon a night was an OK prenatal 
diet? 
</P>
<P>
The Thorps should be charged with filing a frivolous lawsuit. Candy Thorp 
should be charged with reckless child endangerment. 
</P>
<P>
Our courts are overcrowded as it is, and criminals are out on bail because they 
can't get a speedy trial. In the meantime, people like the Thorps are in court 
trying to get rich on the misfortune of their son, who had the bad luck to be 
born to a couple of irresponsible drunks.

The question is not whether pregnant women should drink, but whether anyone 
should drink. Where is the person who has not suffered, to some degree, the 
damaging consequences of alcohol? 
</P>
<P>
I am astounded by the wimpy tone taken by the director of the Alcohol and Drug 
Abuse Institute at the University of Washington. Speaking of the lawsuit 
against the James B. Beam Distillery, he says, "But to cheer for either side is 
a mistake because everyone is a loser." 
</P>
<P>
I mean, let's smarten up here. We must cheer for the side against legal drug 
pushers such as the Beam Distillery, who not only should be held accountable, 
but should be put out of business.

I have just finished reading "Alcohol on Trial" (by Joni Blackman, May 4). A 
more appropriate title would have been "Alcoholic on Trial." I have never in my 
life felt such anger toward a person I've never met. The Thorps claim that they 
never heard that alcohol could harm an unborn child. Candy Thorp has already 
had two children. How did she think those unborn infants got their food supply? 
Did she ever go to a doctor? A competent obstetrician will always tell an 
expectant woman what she should and should not eat or drink. 
</P>
<P>
If she herself got stinking drunk on a half of a fifth of liquor, wouldn't 
common sense tell her what that much liquor would do to an unborn baby? Or her 
husband -- 66 years old and not once in all those years had he heard that 
alcohol consumption by a pregnant woman can hurt an unborn child? I find it 
impossible to believe that these two people were ignorant of that fact. 
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that they are suing the James B. Beam Distillery because they do 
not want to own responsibility for what they did to their own son. 
</P>
<P>
A person is responsible for her own behavior, drunk or not. She should be the 
one on trial and I pray that the courts have the good sense to take that poor 
little boy away from them for good. They have done enough damage to him.

Columbia Pictures and Warner Bros. announced Wednesday that they will build and 
jointly operate a 14,000-square-foot child care center on their shared studio 
lot. Construction is scheduled to begin in early summer, with opening 
tentatively set for next spring. The center will accommodate up to 90 children 
(45 from each company) in three age groups: infants, toddlers and preschool. 
Executives for the two companies said the center represents "an ideal situation 
for working parents who will have an opportunity to make quality daytime 
visits, and who can work productively with the confidence that their children 
are being well cared for nearby. This program is essential in today's working 
world, with an increasing number of women balancing career and family. We 
believe it will also benefit our companies in attracting and retaining the best 
employees in all areas of our operations." ALEENE MacMINN

Home Box Office reportedly will enter advertiser-supported cable service with a 
new 24-hour all-comedy channel. HBO, which for now is declining comment on the 
venture, has scheduled a Tuesday news conference in New York where plans for 
the new channel are expected to be announced. The most recent 
advertiser-supported cable TV venture was Ted Turner's TNT channel, which 
started up last October. ALEENE MacMINN

Radio and television broadcasting in Britain was severely disrupted for the 
second day in a row Wednesday as British Broadcasting Corp. journalists 
continued a 48-hour strike. Most live broadcasts were canceled as senior 
journalists, talk-show hosts and disc jockeys joined picket lines to demand 16% 
wage increases. The state-funded corporation has refused to boost an offer of 
7% although annual inflation has reached 7.9% and is expected to rise further. 
BBC staff complain they earn considerably less than commercial television 
employees doing comparable jobs. There was also a 24-hour strike last month.

BOBBY LYLE CONCENTRATES ON TRADITIONAL AT BILTMORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. JAMES LISKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As if to dispel any doubts about his ability to play straight-ahead jazz, 
pianist Bobby Lyle concentrated on the traditional during his opening set 
Tuesday evening at the Biltmore's Grand Avenue Bar. 
</P>
<P>
A facile young pianist whose credits include stints with Sly and the Family 
Stone, Esther Phillips, Al Jarreau and Bette Midler, Lyle showed that while his 
wallet benefits from R&amp;B, his heart belongs to jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Working with a group featuring saxophonist Kirk Whalum, Lyle opened his 
five-tune set with "Nova," an original composition by the pianist that had 
drummer Mike Baker and bassist Keven Brandon setting a hot swing pace. Though 
their volume at times obscured Lyle's efforts, the pianist nonetheless managed 
to show his considerable abilities in a jazz mode. 
</P>
<P>
A better mode still was John Coltrane's "Giant Steps," this time in 3/4 time. 
Though Whalum's tenor saxophone solos were choppily phrased, his tone was pure 
and his melodic statements provided an interesting contrast to the tune's 
rhythmic foundation. Lyle played with deft precision, with a brief, 
unaccompanied solo offering respite from the frenetic din of drummer Baker. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Strayhorn's "Lush Life" was Lyle's tour de force. With technical agility 
and a deep understanding of, and sensitivity to, the tune, the pianist offered 
a solid reading of the piece. Only occasionally did he reveal a tendency for 
overstatement with ornate flourishes that could have been more effective with a 
more economical approach. 
</P>
<P>
But overstatement was replaced with overkill on the two R&amp;B-based 
inclusions. With a relentlessly pounding beat and the traditional twang-thump 
of the electric bass, both "Night Breeze" and "Tropical," each composed by 
Lyle, were lesser musical efforts than those of his jazz inclusions. Though the 
acoustic piano added pleasant timbral quality, the riff-based tunes were 
unworthy vehicles for the assembled talent. A. JAMES LISKA

STAGE WATCH: INNER CITY CULTURAL CENTER BUYS THE IVAR; PASADENA SCHEDULES MORE 
'GREAT PERFORMANCES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Inner City Cultural Center has bought the 327-seat Ivar Theatre, located at 
1605 Ivar St. in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Inner City's plan, said executive director C. Bernard Jackson, is to raise 
$250,000 to transform the building, now used for sexually oriented movies and 
stage shows, into "an attractive live-theater facility." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson declined to reveal the purchase price. Stan Seiden, representative of 
the building's owners, Argus Properties, said only that the price was "under a 
million dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Inner City has "no intention of abandoning our present site" on New Hampshire 
Avenue, said Jackson, "but we've had a number of shows with long-running 
potential that we couldn't capitalize on because of the demand for space 
there." He cited the recent "Downpayments" as an example. "(The Ivar) will be 
an outlet." 
</P>
<P>
"We'll also make it available to other theaters," Jackson added, "and it will 
be used for music, dance and all of the performing arts." 
</P>
<P>
But don't rush to the box office just yet. 
</P>
<P>
The current lease on the theater includes a clause requiring six months' notice 
of eviction. And the lease on the bar (which has a separate rear entrance) runs 
eight more years, Jackson added. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Inner City hopes to raise funds for "fundamental renovations," he said. 
"The Ivar is in bad condition." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson hopes Hollywood -- "both the neighborhood and the entertainment 
industry" -- will donate to this cause. 
</P>
<P>
He offered to name the theater after any benefactor who contributes $2 million 
("a million to fix it up, and a million for an endowment"). Asked Jackson: "If 
Mark Taper can give enough to have a theater named after him, why not Bill 
Cosby or Eddie Murphy or Oprah Winfrey or Sidney Poitier?" 
</P>
<P>
Inner City presented the Negro Ensemble Company's production of "Ceremonies in 
Dark Old Men" at the Ivar for six months in 1970, Jackson noted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame that what was once a beautiful theater has been so abused," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
UPSTAIRS IN PASADENA: A new play by Elizabeth Forsythe Hailey and one-person 
shows about Sarah Bernhardt and John F. Kennedy will make up the Pasadena 
Playhouse's second "Great Performance" series of the current season, held in 
the upstairs Balcony Theatre at the Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Katherine Helmond will appear as Bernhardt in "Sarah in America," by Ruth 
Wolff, to be directed by Annett Wolf, June 1-July 2. This will be the West 
Coast premiere of a piece done by Lilli Palmer in Connecticut and Washington, 
D.C., in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Next up is the world premiere of Michael Grace's "JFK: Of Cabbages and Kings," 
July 16-Aug. 6. Larry Fuller will direct, but the star has yet to be announced. 
</P>
<P>
Hailey's "Joanna's Husband and David's Wife," is based on her best-selling 
novel and will feature her daughter, Kendall Hailey, and Richard Lenz in a 
story about 25 years in the life of a marriage. It's scheduled for Aug. 
20-Sept. 10. Hailey's last stage adaptation of one of her books, "A Woman of 
Independent Means," was a major success at several local theaters. 
</P>
<P>
RADIO DAYS: Tentative plans to record the Back Alley Theatre production of 
"Voice of the Prairie" for presentation on KCRW-FM fell apart this week. Too 
bad -- this charmer about the early days of radio would appear to be a natural 
candidate for radio broadcast. It closes at the theater Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Another production that appeared on local stages, Louis Fantasia in "The Double 
Bass," will appear on KCRW May 19 at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
PIER PRESSURE: The City of Santa Monica has set aside $15,000 to pay for a 
month of theater at the western end of its famous pier, Aug. 1-Sept. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone may apply for the money, as long as applications are turned in by May 
22. The applicants will be judged by "a panel of disinterested outside 
experts," said Henry Korn, the city's arts administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Korn declined to speculate on what the panel wants, except to say that the 
"material should be accessible to a general audience and to all ages." The 
audience "will come from all walks of life, including people who are not 
necessarily initiated into the arts." Admission will be free. Performances 
could occur in the daytime or evening -- but not on Thursday nights, when 
dancing is held in the same space. 
</P>
<P>
How much theater will $15,000 buy? 
</P>
<P>
"We don't expect 'Cats' for $15,000," said Korn. "We're relying on the 
ingenuity of the theater community." And also, perhaps, the community's 
matching funds: "Our expectation is that many companies will propose to match 
our amount with in-kind services or dollars of their own." 
</P>
<P>
Information: (213) 458-8350. 
</P>
<P>
READINGS: Olympia Dukakis and Robin Gammell are among the actors who will read 
"Better Living" by George Walker ("Nothing Sacred") at the Matrix Saturday at 1 
p.m. Admission is free. . . . Poet William Matthews will conclude the Los 
Angeles Theatre Center 1988-89 poetry-literary series Monday at 8 p.m.

OLD TALES FOR THE YOUNG BY FIRE PLUME ENSEMBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Can hundreds of third- to eighth-graders, products of the "sound-bite" 
generation, sit still for an hour of Greek mythology and Asian folklore? 
</P>
<P>
They did Monday at Caltech's Beckman Auditorium where quiet anticipation, gasps 
and giggles were the responses as the Fire Plume Story and Music Ensemble fired 
young imaginations with centuries-old tales of enchantment. 
</P>
<P>
Storyteller Margaret Wolfson, founder of the New York-based Ensemble, used no 
props, instead creating images with words, silence and graceful body movement. 
</P>
<P>
Musician Paula Chan Bing accented each story with an unusual array of 
instruments: a small harp, an alto flute, bamboo flutes, a Mayan bird whistle, 
a Brazilian rain stick, an African log drum and a Japanese temple bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The stories were dark and strange and brushed with eloquent melancholy, 
particularly a Japanese folk tale called "Urashima Taro," about a fisherman 
spirited away to the Dragon King's undersea palace for 300 years. 
</P>
<P>
There was a rapt silence, then soft intakes of breath as Wolfson told how 
Urashima Taro opened a forbidden box, hoping to regain the years he had lost, 
but instead became suddenly old. "When the mountains turned deep violet with 
shadows," Wolfson said, "he closed his eyes and went to join his ancestors." 
</P>
<P>
Bing's startling sound effects sent an enjoyable scare reverberating through 
the audience in a Korean horror story about a woodcutter saved from an evil 
snake by two golden birds. 
</P>
<P>
As an encore, Wolfson offered a quick, comic tale about a cowboy and a magic 
horse, leaving the audience buzzing. 
</P>
<P>
According to Bing, storytelling for children is "an awakening process, bringing 
them into the world of the imagination." She hopes they will "see beyond the 
rim of the visual world." 
</P>
<P>
Through the Kennedy Center, the ensemble has performed worldwide; the Caltech 
performance, ending a monthlong school tour, was the first in a new series of 
public events co-sponsored by Music Center on Tour and Caltech. LYNNE HEFFLEY

LABORED LOOK AT AMERICAN ORIGINAL AT ODYSSEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Cleves Symmes thought the world was hollow. The musical about him, 
"Symmes' Hole," at the Odyssey, is hollow. 
</P>
<P>
Symmes (1780-1829) was an Army captain (War of 1812), farmer and half-baked 
amateur scientist. He concluded there were holes at the North and South poles, 
leading into the warmer recesses of the earth. 
</P>
<P>
According to the program notes, Symmes' "declaration of a hollow earth in 1818 
. . . ultimately led to a public campaign for the first government-sponsored 
scientific expedition" -- an 1838 endeavor that supposedly discovered 
Antarctica, among other feats. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, most sources credit the discovery of Antarctica to three explorers 
who saw it in 1820. If the accuracy standards are this lax in the program 
notes, imagine what they're like in the musical itself. 
</P>
<P>
Not that accuracy of this kind should matter very much. But except for the 
fruits of the expedition that Symmes purportedly inspired, author Randy 
Dreyfuss hasn't come up with a reason for us to care about Symmes. In fact, 
it's not clear that Dreyfuss himself really cares about Symmes. 
</P>
<P>
The tone of the show is steadfastly trivial and/or cartoonlike. It's supposed 
to be a whimsical examination of a cockeyed American dreamer; instead it's a 
labored look at a remote character who seems not much more than a buffoon. His 
story might be interesting as a footnote in a history book, but it's hardly 
worthy of treatment in a full-length musical. 
</P>
<P>
At first the low comedy is mildly amusing. Some of the jokes are so bad they're 
good. But gradually, as it becomes apparent that there isn't much of anything 
else inside this show, they become merely bad. 
</P>
<P>
The first act attempts to stir up some lyricism over the notion of one man's 
unrelenting quest for knowledge, and the second act attempts to make a 
statement about the little guy being used by the greedy big guys. 
</P>
<P>
But the strained rhymes and the self-congratulatory lines that dot the lyrics 
undercut these efforts. The music is equally fussy and forgettable, and Mark 
Reina's choreography adds little more than clutter to Carol Corwen's staging. 
</P>
<P>
Nor does the performance of Albert Macklin as Symmes deepen our sympathy for 
this guy. He looks perpetually wild-eyed, as if he's half-mad. He doesn't age, 
so we don't appreciate that his was a long-term crusade. And some of his lyrics 
are lost, even though it's a small house. 
</P>
<P>
Orson Bean gamely goes through a kind of vaudeville-act-with-big-words as 
Symmes' loyal disciple. Craig Zehms plays two smoothie roles smoothly, Lori 
Michael vamps around the stage as Symmes' fertile Myrtle of a wife, and Tom 
Dugan, Thom McCleister and Kevin Pariseau contribute a gallery of subsidiary 
roles. 
</P>
<P>
For a show that's supposed to be about our ability to imagine new worlds, Don 
Llewelyn's set and Doc Ballard's lighting are awfully drab and earthbound. Neal 
San Teguns did most of the costumes, but not the one that provides the best 
sight gag of the show: a "planet suit" worn by Bean at a scientific 
demonstration and credited in the program to Carlos Leon. 
</P>
<P>
 At 12111 Ohio Ave., Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sundays at 7 p.m. 
Tickets: $15.50-$19.50; (213) 826-1626. DON SHIRLEY

LACC STUDENT FILMS A BREATH OF FRESH AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a bloom on youth some of us never recapture, a spirit about beginner's 
films that's hard to match. The 10 short student films shown tonight at the 
Directors Guild are a good example: Made at the Los Angeles City College 
Radio-TV-Film Department, they have a zest and honesty that puts to shame much 
of the commercial product out now. 
</P>
<P>
The school's film programs are populist products. Compared to many other 
college film programs, these students come from all ages, races, sexes and 
classes. It shows. All of these films have in common a devotion to storytelling 
craft and to ideas about the world. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, they lack that surface panache that is often the only saving 
grace of a current commercial release. But each of them is a movie with a core, 
a heart and a brain. They range from a blackly comic cartoon about the price of 
good Samaritanism in the animal world (Brian Lee's "Frog Day Afternoon"), to a 
sympathetic examination of the plight of the aging (Mohammed Anvarizadeh's 
"Growing Again"), to a modern parable of religious mania (Ted Dewberry's 
"Second Coming"), to a satire on mind control (Rafaello Mazza's "Shock"), to 
two tour-de-force subjective portrayals of the horrors of childhood (Robert 
Chodak's comic "Come In, Johnny" and Michelle Johnson's painful "Silence"). 
</P>
<P>
Among my favorites: Nick Stamos' "Loose Ends," a tense, modern film noir about 
a recently paroled contract killer forced to redo the botched murder he left 
behind. Stamos tries for too wild a double-twist climax here, but he is good at 
evoking the disaffected mood of a rootless man in the city, the loneliness, 
dirt and squalor of small hotel rooms. His lead, Cletus Young, has a great, 
gnarled, cold-as-death gangster face, like Lino Ventura; he might have sprung 
form the bowels of Scorsese's mean streets. And Stamos' composer, Marjorie Poe, 
whose score is chilling and percussive, is a real find. 
</P>
<P>
Carole Kravetz' "Taxi Dance" presents another slant on urban loneliness. It's a 
lyrical little film about dance, sex and the power of nocturnal body English, 
set on an abandoned stage where two strangers have a brief, blazing encounter. 
Saundra Sharp's "Picking Tribes," which I already had the pleasure of reviewing 
for the recent Black Talkies on Parade film competition (where it won first 
prize), is a marvelous autobiographical tale of a young girl coming gradually 
to terms with her mixed black and Native American heritages. It packs so much 
into its narration, music, animation and collage that you seem to experience 
half a lifetime in barely seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Finally there is Rupert Nadeau's "Tracks," a nastily funny road picture in 
which a bearish, sweaty vacuum cleaner salesman (Carlo Michael Mancini) murders 
his lover and her boyfriend, then takes them along on a perverted parody of the 
usual love-on-the-run movie, from "Gun Crazy" to "Badlands." Nadeau seems to 
owe much of his attack to the Coen brothers ("Blood Simple" and "Raising 
Arizona"), but he adds some acrid spice and weird tricks of his own. In one 
virtuoso shot, the camera plays mirror games while the dead lovers spring to 
life in a desultory motel dance. 
</P>
<P>
"Tracks" could easily be expanded into a full-length movie. So, with a better 
ending, could "Loose Ends." "Taxi Dance" and "Picking Tribes" are fine as they 
are. And, like the rest of the films, they are a breath of cinematic fresh air 
in the usual wasteland of crazed slashers, careening cars, deal-making and 
grosses-worship.

LOW-CAL RABBIT DISHES; 
</P>
<P>
THE MAKING OF A CULINARY CLASSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Harper's Bazaar 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chefs are cooking rabbit in some of the country's top restaurant kitchens 
because rabbit dishes are culinary classics that are high in prestige and low 
in calories. 
</P>
<P>
Europeans have long been rabbit fanciers with the French consuming more than 
200 million rabbits a year, or about 13 pounds per person. Italy, Germany and 
Spain consume about the same amount, with England right behind. 
</P>
<P>
Health-conscious dieters should note that rabbit has fewer calories per pound, 
more protein and less cholesterol than chicken or veal. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, rabbit has been fried, stewed, baked, broiled, roasted, curried, 
hashed or eaten as a pie or ragout. Today's cooks serve rabbit in coconut milk, 
in sour cream and mustard sauce, barbecued, boiled, cacciatore, en casserole 
and Creole style. 
</P>
<P>
Angus Cameron and Judith Jones, authors of "The L.L. Bean Game and Fish 
Cookbook," maintain that "rabbit can be prepared with any recipe you use for 
chicken. There is only one difference," they said. "Rabbit is better." 
</P>
<P>
New York writer Charlie Rubin orders rabbit at business lunches -- he finds it 
a power play as well as a culinary choice. 
</P>
<P>
"It knocks out the guys you're with," he said. "People think you're a serious 
eater." 
</P>
<P>
Rubin ranked rabbit this way: "Rabbit is as good as alligator tails, less good 
than frog legs." 
</P>
<P>
Michel Jean, owner of New York's Provence bistro, said most restaurants served 
only the filet, which is tender but too bland. The French use more flavorful 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to make it more appealing," Jean said. "I want to include more 
traditional Provencal dishes such as rabbit Brignolaise (cut in pieces, stuffed 
with rosemary, garlic and thyme, wrapped in bacon and roasted with garlic 
cloves) or a rabbit stew, which is tastier and gamy." 
</P>
<P>
Rabbit is served in a number of New York restaurants, as well as sophisticated 
eateries in Chicago and Beverly Hills. "In L.A., rabbits are rampant," said 
Mickey Ziffren, a novelist and wife of Paul Ziffren, chairman of the 1984 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbits are traditional in regional cooking. In New Orleans, Cajun-Creole 
restaurants prepare rabbit in time-honored as well as innovative ways. In North 
Carolina, professional cook Carrie Lyerly uses a simple century-old family 
recipe. She says people today do too much to rabbit. "They put in so many 
things that the rabbit loses its distinctive flavor," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In New Mexico, the Pueblo Indians go on rabbit hunts in spring and fall.

ALASKA SAYS SEAFOOD HARVESTS ARE SAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The disastrous oil spill from the tanker Exxon Valdez will not affect the 
quality and wholesomeness of Alaskan seafood this season, according to a trade 
group representing the state's fishermen and wholesalers. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement, by the Alaskan Seafood Marketing Institute, is aimed at 
maintaining consumer confidence in an industry whose 1988 catch totaled 5.5 
billion pounds. The harvest's dockside value, or the amount paid fishermen, was 
valued at $1.7 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
Several precautions are being taken this year to ensure the safety of the 
catch, such as intensified monitoring for contamination in both the water and 
fishery products, the Juneau-based group announced recently. 
</P>
<P>
Concerns center on the Prince William Sound, the area in which the spill 
occurred on March 24. Since the tanker ran aground, these waters have been 
closed to fishermen. The action primarily affected the local herring and salmon 
catch. Of lesser economic value were harvests of halibut, black cod and 
shellfish. 
</P>
<P>
However, the area affected by the spill is not a major factor in the state's 
seafood industry. In fact, Prince William Sound represents only one of 15 
approved fishing grounds in Alaska. Further, not even all of the sound has been 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
"The sound is a very large place and portions of it are just fine," said Merry 
Tuten, the institute's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
The industry's reassurances come just days before the fishing season begins in 
earnest on May 15 when boats are allowed to catch halibut during a closely 
controlled 24-hour period. The Copper River salmon season will also begin on 
that same day. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to any commercial fishing though, state-supervised tests of water and 
fish quality will be conducted. The surveys will be monitored by the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
According to Tuten, the tests for halibut have already been completed. 
Preliminary indications are that oil is not now a problem in the Gulf of Alaska 
-- where much of the fish is caught -- nor even in some parts of the sound. 
</P>
<P>
"What they determined is that the (traditional fishing) area is clear and free 
of any oil," said Kevin O'Sullivan, the institute's quality assurance 
coordinator. "The scientific tests for any potential oil in the liver or gall 
blatter of the fish (were negative)." 
</P>
<P>
The testing is being done by the Alaskan Department of Environmental 
Conservation and the Department of Fish and Game. The agencies are using, among 
other methods, organoleptic testing, which involves a visual inspection of the 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
"Oil is something visual and aromatic. You can easily spot the contamination 
and the state won't allow it," said O'Sullivan. "If there is any oil at all in 
the fish then it is contaminated. . . . And any catch containing it would be 
condemned, confiscated and destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
Alaskan seafood currently on the market was harvested well before the spill and 
poses no problems to consumers, institute officials said. They added that there 
is little to fear from Alaskan salmon, halibut, crab and shrimp that will be 
arriving in stores in the weeks to come. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel completely confident with the public's consumption of Alaskan 
seafood," said O'Sullivan. "We place a great deal of confidence in the 
(surveillance) program, and consumers would be foolish to pass up the unique 
eating opportunity of Alaskan seafood." 
</P>
<P>
Whether the group's endorsement is enough to restore consumers confidence in 
the state's seafood is unknown. Even the institute acknowledges that it's too 
soon to determine the spill's effect on prices and supplies this year. 
</P>
<P>
"No, the (Exxon Valdez) did not help us," said O'Sullivan. "But Alaskans are 
used to problems and are used to dealing with them. And we will deal with this 
one."

 LET'S EAT OUT: DAN TANA'S: PASTA TILL 1 A.M. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dan Tana's is the kind of place you'd expect to find Mickey Spillane hunched 
over the bar, legs crossed, cigarette flipping over to the other side of the 
mouth and asking for a double Scotch. 
</P>
<P>
It's the kind of place that lures restless spirits late at night from their 
haunts to resuscitate over a good gin and tonic, a plate of pasta or a good 
look at the guys and dolls who always look good. Dan Tana's is one of the few 
restaurants in Hollywood whose kitchen and bar is open until 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
On a scale of 1 to 10, the people-watching at Tana's rates 10 -- plenty of 
flesh and hair, lots of dames and a movie crowd that looks as if it was 
costumed for a film noir. 
</P>
<P>
 Tana used to be an actor, turned producer, and there is plenty of two-cheek 
kissy-kissy stuff going on from table to table, the way they do in Rome or 
Cannes. No tourists here. 
</P>
<P>
But you can sort of take it all in sitting at the bar, where the view is best. 
You'll also get a good view of the bordello-red wallpaper, red leather booths, 
Chianti bottles hanging from the ceiling, the flickering of candles on the red 
checkered-clothed tables. You'll see the pantomime of tossed Caesar salad at 
table side -- a disappearing art that should be relished while it still lasts. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in a cozy, comfy corner of the "in" room, where movie moguls make their 
best deals and some of the friendliest professional waiters serve, I ordered 
spaghetti and meatballs. Jimmy Cano, the maitre d', looked down at me over his 
Ben Franklin specks and said, "Take the veal Parmigiana. It comes with 
spaghetti Bolognese. We'll throw a meatball on it just to keep you happy." The 
pasta plates are heaping, he reminded me. Like Mt. Vesuvius. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, I got the meatball smack in the middle of the side dish of spaghetti 
Bolognese. 
</P>
<P>
It's the kind of sauce Southern Italians in the neighborhood near where I grew 
up called gravy. The meatball was the grainy type that crumbles into fine 
particles in your mouth, just the way you'd find in Little Italy or at Mamma 
Leona's on a Sunday afternoon in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Tana's chef of 20 years, Mate Mustac, who, like Tana, is from the Adriatic in 
Yugoslavia, is a fairly accurate translator of Southern Italian cuisine of the 
type you find in New York, which is slightly different from the Southern 
Italian cooking you find in Southern Italy, or anywhere, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
A linguine with clam sauce that passed under my nose smelled great. Another 
linguine dish loaded with shellfish and clams also sailed by. I began to think 
maybe I should have ordered the linguine. But the Parmigiana was keeping me 
busy. It was a huge portion with a lake of melted cheese floating over the 
saucy top. 
</P>
<P>
The antipasto, which comes with a complete dinner ($6 extra with soup, entree 
and coffee), has a big black olive on top that I especially like. The caponata 
is good too. The Tana special salad is a close cousin of the antipasto, only 
tossed. 
</P>
<P>
You'll need to hit Lotto to order the steak. It's $30. There are other choices, 
however. The menu is loaded with pastas in the $12 to $16 range, including a 
baked mostaccioli I was tempted to order, but didn't because it is so rich with 
cheese. Then there is fettuccine Alfredo or carbonara I'd like to order when I 
can afford the calories. When I'm dieting, I usually go for the vermicelli with 
basil and fresh tomatoes. Low calories, high price: $16. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone I've talked to about Tana's says Tana's has some of the freshest fish 
on the block. I can vouch for the calamari and clams. The white fish Evelina, 
the chef's specialty, was excellent when I took a bite from a friend's fork. 
</P>
<P>
If you like veal, I would definitely try the piccata or the saltimbocca (veal 
scallop topped with proscuitto and sage). They are dishes that have passed the 
test of time with flying colors. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, most of the stuff on the menu hasn't changed since Tana opened 25 
years ago. What that tells you is that everything on the menu has been through 
the mill of discernment by some of the most finicky eaters in the country. Why 
else would a restaurant with just 20 tables be packed at midnight. Don't ask 
me. I just eat there. I mean, dine there. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Tana's, 9071 Santa Monica Blvd. West Hollywood. (213) 275-9444. Open for 
dinner from 5 p.m. to 1 a.m. seven days. Reservations essential. Major credit 
cards accepted. Valet parking available. Average entree $16. Full bar.

 NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: MAKING LESS SEEM LIKE MORE FOR A MOTHER'S DAY FETE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Planning a Mother's Day lunch for dieting mothers is no easy task when finicky, 
calorie-conscious guests will be invited. There are so many people today whose 
tireless efforts to lose weight will not be recessed -- even on a special 
occasion such as this -- that ingenuity on the part of the host is a 
prerequisite. 
</P>
<P>
It is, however, possible to make guests feel secure about indulging while still 
making the occasion a special one. A simple menu built around salads or light 
entrees is a delicious way to do it. 
</P>
<P>
These are not the take-out variety of salads, which often are loaded with 
hidden fat from ingredients such as mayonnaise, oil-rich dressings, bacon, 
eggs, avocados and the like. This list includes recipes that capitalize on 
creative combinations of taste and texture. A medley of warm and cold, sweet 
and savory that will make everyone feel safe, yet satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crowned With Slender Dressing 
</P>
<P>
The glamorous recipes offered here take advantage of inherently low-fat protein 
sources like skinned chicken, turkey and seafood and combines them with fresh 
fruit and vegetables. Some moderately lean items such as beef and veal also are 
featured. Each of the salads is crowned with a slender dressing, then served 
with sparkling apple cider, crusty French bread and fresh fruit as fitting, but 
optional, accompaniments to an elegant and festive bill of fare. 
</P>
<P>
Select one or two or more from the recipes that follow and serve with a tossed 
green salad and commercial diet dressing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

DISCOVERY: JUICING UP A FIXTURE FROM O.C. COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who ever would have thought that the Orange Inn would diversify? How do you 
diversify a juice joint, even if it was the most famous juice joint on the 
Orange County coast? 
</P>
<P>
From 1931 until it closed in late 1986, the Orange Inn on Coast Highway in 
Corona del Mar served up fresh-squeezed citrus juice, nuts, date shakes, 
sandwiches and other local goodies to legions of faithful motorists, cyclists, 
surfers and passers-by. It was a bright green-and-orange institution, the 
perfect roadside shack, cheery and Spartan. 
</P>
<P>
When the inn's lease from the Irvine Co. ran out, the place didn't die, 
however. It just became more urban, moving a few miles down the coast to 
downtown Laguna Beach, still on Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
"We disassembled the old Orange Inn and took a lot of it with us," said 
Kathleen Bodrero, who owned the inn with her husband, John, since 1971. "We 
just loved that place." 
</P>
<P>
So, she said, did the developers who made up Sand Canyon Historical Partners, a 
group that has renovated several buildings off Sand Canyon Avenue in Irvine to 
form Old Town Irvine, a complex made up mostly of restaurants and a hotel, La 
Quinta Inn. 
</P>
<P>
"They contacted us about 6 weeks after we closed (the original Orange Inn)," 
said Bodrero. "They were all surfers who remembered the Orange Inn." 
</P>
<P>
The group, said Bodrero, wanted to know if she and her husband would be 
interested in opening an expanded Orange Inn on their property, on the site of 
the old Irvine Garage, once the first Ford dealership in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd always wanted to expand and serve breakfast through dinner when we were 
out on the coast," said Bodrero. "We also wanted a kind of convenience market. 
Not a 7-Eleven, but kind of like a little country store." 
</P>
<P>
So the Bodreros took the old sign that once sat atop their original inn, along 
with their collection of more than 300 framed orange crate labels, and set up 
shop late last year in the converted garage, which today is restored to its 
original 1930s Art-Deco design. 
</P>
<P>
And the place -- called the Orange Inn Cafe and Market -- is not merely a 
freeway-side juice joint, but a combination cafe-deli-bakery and country store, 
fulfilling -- and then some -- the Bodreros' dreams from the old days of the 
Orange Inn. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the original Orange Inn items -- sandwiches, juices, house brand jams 
and salad dressings, as well as other edibles -- are served in the deli and the 
cafe, which opens at 6 a.m. daily and serves three meals a day. 
</P>
<P>
"The things we used to serve as specials at the old inn we're now serving every 
day in the cafe," said Bodrero, items such as chicken and fish dishes. And, she 
said, the wine sold by the bottle in the adjacent market can be taken into the 
cafe and enjoyed with meals for a $3.50 corkage fee. 
</P>
<P>
The inn has begun to offer catering, said Bodrero, and "we'll probably be doing 
room service at the La Quinta Inn within a year." 
</P>
<P>
The place did not take long to be discovered -- or rediscovered. Bodrero said 
there is often a 40-minute wait on weekends, with customers pressing their 
faces to the large front window in an attempt to spot a vacant table. And, she 
said, when the planned extension of Sand Canyon Avenue to the beach is 
completed, they expect a new influx of old friends. 
</P>
<P>
"They tell us Sand Canyon will empty out right about where the old Orange Inn 
was," Bodrero said.

ANN CONWAY: MEGA-DONATION TO CLINIC PUTS NAME IN LIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I didn't want my name on the clinic; they talked me into it!" said developer 
Allen Boerner on Friday during a bash tossed by the Lestonnac Free Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Boerner and his wife, Susan, recently donated $250,000 to the facility in 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
"And what do you do for a man who gives you a quarter of a million dollars?" 
asked Sister Marie Therese, who founded the clinic 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
You splash his name across the clinic's new building, that's what. 
</P>
<P>
Boerner, president of Cambio Investments in Fullerton, admitted he hadn't 
really planned on giving the clinic that much. "But then I went there and saw 
what Sister was doing for the people -- people who looked like they had one set 
of clothes -- and I decided it was something I wanted to really be part of. 
It's something I can see, something I can feel. Sister Therese is so dedicated. 
She must work 12 to 14 hours a day." 
</P>
<P>
Hamburger mogul Carl Karcher, who loves to call Sister Therese "the Mother 
Teresa of Orange County," introduced him to the clinic, Boerner said. "And he 
is so persuasive. And so is Stan Pawlowski (event co-chair with his wife, 
Theresa). And so is Sister -- the master of all salesmen! I was a dead duck; I 
didn't have a chance before I started. They're all sweethearts." 
</P>
<P>
About 400 clinic boosters gathered at the Anaheim Hilton and Towers to honor 
the Boerners and live it up at the Cinco de Mayo party that netted $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Before dinner, the black-tie crowd -- many sporting the optional Mexican attire 
-- sipped margaritas, dipped into guacamole and enjoyed mariachi serenades as 
they bid on auction items. Among prizes up for bid: dresses topped with beaded 
and feathered bibs, courtesy of Susan Boerner. "Yes, I'm a fashion designer," 
Susan said. 
</P>
<P>
And how did it feel to give away a whopping $250,000? "I think it's wonderful 
to help others," said Susan, who wore a black, Spanish-style cocktail ensemble. 
"That's the whole point. We have the ability to help the poor. Anybody who has 
money has that ability." 
</P>
<P>
The clinic serves an average of 4,000 patients annually, said Sister Marie 
Therese. But her dream is to serve 10,000. "The clinic is a haven of love for 
Orange County's poorest of the poor. We try to rebuild their ailing spirits and 
make them humanly alive," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For art's sake: Fine wines and country pates were served up alfresco on 
Saturday when members of the Orange County Center for Contemporary Art staged a 
benefit at the Old Dana Point Cafe and Wine Bar. 
</P>
<P>
"Our whole thrust is to help emerging artists in Orange County," said Bardene 
Allen, director of the nonprofit center in Costa Mesa. "We help them with 
exhibitions. We show their work. And we teach them how to deal with galleries 
and museums." 
</P>
<P>
"But membership requires a certain amount of sacrifice," said Eric Strauss, a 
mixed-media sculptor. Members must pay monthly dues of $40. "But my goal is to 
teach art at the college level. And to do that, you have to be an artist. You 
have to build a resume, get into the lane of art commerce. You don't do that by 
staying home, making little paintings and selling them to friends. You have to 
get out and find galleries." 
</P>
<P>
Each of the art center's 25 members has a show at the center every year and a 
half, Allen said. "Right now, we have an affiliate show. Two works from each of 
our members are on exhibit" through May 19. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Jennings, a photographer who shoots surreal landscapes, became a 
Center for Contemporary Art member because "it's a marvelous place to network," 
she said, "to experiment, to get into what's going on in the Los Angeles and 
Orange County art scene." 
</P>
<P>
For Marcia Holzman, who creates monotypes and acrylic paintings, membership at 
the center has been a way to get exposure for her work. 
</P>
<P>
"The center is a fine art group -- not a commercial one," she said. "I've been 
a commercial artist. I know what it's like to take directions, do exactly what 
someone else wants. So it's really nice for me to be able to express my 
feelings. " 
</P>
<P>
"We may not be promoting ourselves to please the masses," said Chris Gallup, a 
creator of pop art. "But it's still necessary to organize elements toward 
having a successful career, even when that success is not monetary." 
</P>
<P>
"We sell very few" works, Allen said. "It's just not our primary goal. We 
nurture the artist and his get work shown, not sold." 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the $20-per-person wine tasting and auction were estimated at 
$3,000. Also on the scene: Kathleen Kaplan, event chairwoman; Bill Riley, 
member of the art center board, and Janet Croul, event co-chairwoman.

U.S., SOVIETS AGREE TO NEW TALKS ON LONG-RANGE ARMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States and the Soviet Union have agreed to resume their negotiations 
to reduce long-range nuclear weapons in mid-June, ending a six-month freeze 
imposed by the new Bush Administration, U.S. and Soviet officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to resume the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks, or START, was the 
main tangible result of a day of talks between Secretary of State James A. 
Baker III and Soviet officials that also produced a glimmer of hope for 
U.S.-Soviet cooperation in ending Third World conflicts from the Middle East to 
Central America. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased with the way things started," Baker told reporters midway 
through the first day of his first visit to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry, Gennady I. Gerasimov, said the 
Kremlin had high hopes for the talks and welcomed the Americans' new emphasis 
on Third World trouble spots. 
</P>
<P>
"Dealing with regional problems will enable us to get the last of the Cold War 
behind us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, Gerasimov expressed the Soviet government's 
impatience with theBush Administration's slow approach to arms control, and 
jumped the gun on Baker by publicly announcing the agreement to resume the 
START talks a day before U.S. officials expected. 
</P>
<P>
"We think our negotiators have had enough holidays," Gerasimov said. "We have 
lost a lot of time. While diplomats are on vacation, arms are piling up. We 
understand the specifics of the U.S. political system, but we regret the time 
lost. . . . We have lost six months." 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan Administration negotiated the outline of a strategic arms agreement 
with the Soviet Union last year, agreeing on a reduction of roughly 50% in 
intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear-armed manned bombers. 
</P>
<P>
But the Bush Administration called off the scheduled resumption of the talks on 
Feb. 15, saying it needed more time to decide what new mobile missiles to build 
and to settle on a negotiating strategy. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the Administration has decided to build limited numbers of 
both the MX and the Midgetman mobile missiles and has decided on a basic 
approach in negotiations: to cling to the essential positions the Reagan 
Administration held. 
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to proceed in general on the basis of the work that has been done 
(in last year's START talks), and we expect the Soviets to see considerable 
continuity in our positions," an Administration official traveling with Baker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resuming June 12 or 19 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov told reporters that the two sides had agreed to resume the talks in 
Geneva on either June 12 or June 19 and that the first round would probably 
last six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Soviet Union had proposed that the talks begin this month, but the 
United States objected, saying that Bush's nominee as chief negotiator, Richard 
R. Burt, is unlikely to win Senate confirmation that soon. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the broad agreement on cuts to 6,000 nuclear warheads and 1,600 
delivery vehicles on each side, serious points of potential conflict remain, 
including the Soviet desire, resisted by the United States, to reduce 
sea-launched cruise missiles and restrict the Strategic Defense Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet government of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has also been visibly 
uncomfortable with the Bush Administration's long pause in East-West diplomacy 
-- and with the comments of some U.S. officials, notably Defense Secretary Dick 
Cheney, that Gorbachev's ambitious reform program is probably doomed to 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze pointedly raised Cheney's comments with 
Baker in their first meeting on Wednesday and was told by Baker that President 
Bush views the Soviet reform program, or perestroika, as "a very positive 
development," a U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we raised the subject (of Cheney's comments), it is not because we were 
offended in any way," Soviet spokesman Gerasimov said. ". . . The U.S. side 
assured us it was his personal opinion. We realize that Cheney needs more money 
for military programs -- and how can he possibly obtain it if the Soviet threat 
is going away?" 
</P>
<P>
Baker's initial meeting with Shevardnadze, scheduled for 25 minutes, lasted 
almost an hour -- an encouraging sign, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker is scheduled to meet with Gorbachev today. 
</P>
<P>
On the so-called regional issues, on which Baker aides said they wanted the 
meeting to focus, there was only fragmentary progress, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials said they consider Israel's proposal for elections in the 
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza strip "worthy of attention," a phrase that 
a U.S. official called "encouraging but not definite." But at the same time, 
Gerasimov told reporters that the Soviet Union would reject as "a deceit" any 
election that did not include the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official said that his Soviet counterparts rebuffed a plea to the 
Kremlin to stop dealing with Libya and other countries that the United States 
considers to be terrorist states. 
</P>
<P>
On Central America, Shevardnadze repeated the Kremlin's proposal for a total 
ban on arms shipments to the region, a proposal the United States has rejected. 
But officials on both sides said that some common ground had been reached, 
including a joint commitment to a negotiated peace in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan Discussed 
</P>
<P>
On Afghanistan, Shevardnadze again asked the United States to halt its military 
aid to the Muslim rebels fighting the Soviet-backed regime in Kabul. Baker 
reportedly turned that request aside but agreed that the two countries should 
talk about a possible peaceful resolution of the decade-old civil war. 
</P>
<P>
On human rights, Gerasimov said the United States promised to seek the repeal 
of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade Act if the Soviet Union's new and 
more liberal emigration policy is enshrined in law. The Jackson-Vanik Amendment 
ties U.S. trade to Soviet restrictions on Jewish emigration. 
</P>
<P>
Baker's day in Moscow also included an unusual political event: a meeting 
between the secretary of state and three newly elected members of the Congress 
of People's Deputies, the first freely elected Soviet legislature since the 
1917 revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, who managed Bush's 1988 presidential campaign, invited the three new 
legislators, all strong proponents of perestroika, to talk with him at the U.S. 
ambassador's residence. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters whether he believes the United States should work directly 
with the new congress -- much as foreign governments approach Congress in 
Washington -- Baker said: "Let's see how it evolves. Perhaps so." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he plans to dispense any campaign advice, Baker smiled and said, 
"I might be getting some from them."

MADE JUDGMENT ERROR, BRADLEY TELLS COUNCIL; 
</P>
<P>
STUNS MEMBERS WITH ADMISSION BUT SAYS HE BROKE NO LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley, in a dramatic public admission, told a stunned City Council 
Wednesday that he made "an error in judgment" in creating the appearance of a 
conflict of interest between his employment by private firms and his 
simultaneous mayoral actions, but he insisted that he will be exonerated by 
pending investigations into his conduct. 
</P>
<P>
"I was insensitive not to realize that accepting outside employment could 
create the perceptions we see today," said Bradley, offering his statement of 
remorse before a battery of television cameras in the council's ornate chamber. 
</P>
<P>
"In retrospect, my decision to engage in outside employment was a mistake 
because of the perceptions it created. I now recognize that error, and I will 
always regret it. 
</P>
<P>
"I am certain," the mayor added, "that the inquiry will conclude that I have 
violated no laws." 
</P>
<P>
The two-minute public statement, which Bradley aides said the mayor had been 
mulling for a week but which came on only short notice to the council, was 
meant to blunt the political damage mounting daily because of a series of 
investigations surrounding the 71-year-old city executive. 
</P>
<P>
After the speech, council members Robert Farrell, Joel Wachs and Ernani 
Bernardi rose in a standing ovation as Bradley marched from the council 
chamber. But many council members criticized his remarks as repetitive and 
incomplete and said he had failed to address the most pressing questions about 
his behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it was clear enough; I don't think it was convincing enough," 
said Councilwoman Gloria Molina, a member of the council's Governmental 
Operations Committee, which is overseeing City Atty. James K. Hahn's probe of 
the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Council members, most of whom learned of the pending statement less than half 
an hour before it was delivered, also said the statement will have no impact on 
the direction of the Hahn investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe he asked for forgiveness, but the process has to move forward," 
Councilwoman Joy Picus said. "I suspect that he thought maybe it would end it, 
but it couldn't possibly, in reality." 
</P>
<P>
Hahn, for his part, on Wednesday defended his investigation of the mayor as 
independent and said it was "simply wrong" for council members to consider the 
appointment of a special counsel in the case. Several council members have 
privately discussed the appointment of such a counsel, largely because of 
concerns that Hahn's probe will be narrow and that a conflict could exist on 
the part of John Emerson, Hahn's chief deputy and a former partner in the law 
firm representing Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
To allay the concerns, Hahn also announced that Emerson has voluntarily recused 
himself "effective immediately, from any participation whatsoever in the 
Bradley investigation." The recusal contradicted earlier statements by the city 
attorney's office that Emerson was not involved in the probe. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, elected just last month to an unprecedented fifth term, faces four 
independent investigations into his financial dealings. Hahn's probe, which is 
expected to continue for months, centers on Bradley's relationships with two 
local institutions. The Far East National Bank last year gave Bradley $18,000 
to serve as the only paid member of its advisory board. A second firm, Valley 
Federal Savings &amp; Loan, paid Bradley up to $24,000 a year, dating back to 
1978, to serve as a director. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley initially denied knowing that the firms were active with the city, but 
documents released in recent weeks have indicated that Bradley knew Far East 
held city accounts. Bradley also approved measures affecting Valley Federal 
subsidiaries before he left the board earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor also faces probes by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is 
looking into his investments with Drexel Burnham Lambert, and the Fair 
Political Practices Commission, which has launched two investigations of the 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
In his public acknowledgement of error, Bradley specifically apologized for 
accepting fees from outside firms, a practice that, as the mayor noted, is 
allowed under the City Charter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Central Issue 
</P>
<P>
He did not, however, address the central issue of the controversy: allegations 
that Bradley improperly consulted with city officials regarding the firms and 
took action benefitting those who paid him fees. Bradley's top aide, Deputy 
Mayor Mike Gage, said the omission was intentional. 
</P>
<P>
"He considers the taking of outside employment to be his error of judgement . . 
. because of the perceptions that it creates -- not because of any action he's 
taken," Gage said. 
</P>
<P>
But council members said they found the omission disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he really addressed whether or not he made mistakes overall," 
Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores said. "There is a lot more to this. I don't know 
what this is . . . I don't think it accomplished anything as far as I am 
concerned." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Michael Woo, who heads the committee overseeing Hahn's report, said 
the mayor "didn't address the issue of lying, the inconsistencies in his 
statements." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's remarks also marked a sharp turnabout from a comment made Tuesday in 
a luncheon interview with editors and reporters of The Times. Asked then if 
there was anything "wrong" for a person in public office to take a private job 
-- as he did with the two local firms -- the mayor replied: 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see that as being prohibitive or a mistake," he said in the interview. 
"It's a question of what you do in that position." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Bradley appeared to narrow his answer to indicate that outside jobs were 
not illegal. He did not, as he did on Wednesday, characterize such jobs as an 
"error in judgment." 
</P>
<P>
Gage said Bradley's decision to publicly address the matter came after much 
deliberation, but he said the timing was not prompted by fears of escalating 
political damage. 
</P>
<P>
"I think any proud person sometimes has difficulty admitting they made an error 
of judgment," Gage said of the timing. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's appearance in the council chamber was hastily arranged in an 8:45 
a.m. telephone call by a mayoral aide to council President John Ferraro. 
Bradley entered the chamber shortly after 10:15 a.m., read a prepared statement 
and left without further comment, refusing to take questions from council 
members or the swarm of reporters following him to his office. 
</P>
<P>
Council members saw the speech as an attempt by Bradley to court them and, in 
addition, to reach voters in a format tailored to get his point across with 
little chance of interference. Bradley spoke to the council from behind the 
members' horseshoe shaped desk, before a podium bearing the mayoral seal. The 
podium had been carried to the chamber for the address and was returned to the 
mayor's offices afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley was clearly seeking the good will of the council members, opening his 
statement by calling it a compilation of "very personal words" about the 
controversy. He also cited in his second sentence his 47 years of public 
service, which date back to his careers as a city police officer and 
councilman. 
</P>
<P>
Many council members publicly said they were impressed that Bradley chose to 
speak to them but privately several were sharply critical. Among Bradley's 
supporters, however, Farrell said he would "not be surprised" if the 
controversy over Bradley was racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
He offered no proof, but said he was "very proud" of Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe Tom Bradley," Farrell said. "And I believe in what he said."

U.S. TENTATIVELY PLANS BOOST IN PANAMA FORCES 
</P>

<P>
President Bush, responding to a rash of political violence in Panama and 
harassment of U.S. servicemen there, has tentatively decided to boost the U.S. 
military presence by sending as many as 3,000 additional troops to the troubled 
nation, Administration officials said Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, stressed that no final 
decisions had been made and that the President will review the deployment, as 
well as other options, with congressional leaders who have been summoned to 
meet with him at the White House this morning. The sources commented before 
Panamanian government officials announced late Wednesday that the results of 
Sunday's election would be nullified because of fraud by the opposition and 
U.S. interference. The White House had no immediate statement on the Panamanian 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, President Bush's decision was based on half a dozen 
incidents involving U.S. service personnel and was intended to insure the 
protection of U.S. citizens in Panama. Among the incidents were the arrests of 
two U.S. defense attaches -- later released -- and three reservists on 
Wednesday and, a night earlier, the beating of a Navy enlisted man by suspected 
pro-Noriega forces. 
</P>
<P>
The decision in Washington was made at the end of a day that saw the unrest in 
Panama escalating in the wake of what has been almost universally condemned as 
a fraudulent election and the refusal of the regime of Gen. Manuel A. Noriega 
to recognize the victory of opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Servicemen Harassed 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, the Pentagon ordered all U.S. military personnel in Panama 
to remain on base or in their homes because of growing violence in the streets 
of Panama City and harassment of U.S. servicemen. 
</P>
<P>
Acting within minutes after Panamanian paramilitary forces physically attacked 
Endara during an anti-government demonstration, the Pentagon increased its 
alert status for the 10,000 U.S. troops plus an equal number of dependents in 
Panama. 
</P>
<P>
The attack on Endara during the afternoon in Panama City also led to a late 
afternoon meeting between Bush and his national security adviser, Brent 
Scowcroft, and a telephone conversation between Bush and U.S. Ambassador Arthur 
Davis in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
At the White House meeting, Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, reportedly argued strongly that in the absence of further 
provocations of U.S. military personnel or their dependents, there should be no 
increase in the size of the U.S. force in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Uncalled For, Unneeded' 
</P>
<P>
"It's uncalled for, unneeded at this point, just additional ammunition for 
Noriega to use to his advantage," said a senior military official. The official 
added that the 10,000 "very capable" U.S. troops already in Panama are 
sufficient to cope with the current threat to them. 
</P>
<P>
But Crowe, expressing the opinions of the nation's senior military officers, 
appeared to back a response, in which an escalation in harassment of U.S. 
forces or their dependents could result in the introduction of additional 
security troops. 
</P>
<P>
But on the basis of Davis' report, Administration officials said, the President 
decided tentatively to take the steps that could lead to the deployment of a 
brigade of 2,000 to 3,000 troops. 
</P>
<P>
Should the troops be called up, they would be culled from a number of 
divisions, government sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard, however, stressed Wednesday night that no U.S. 
troops outside Panama had been called up or put on alert. In March and April, 
1988, responding to what it called "the potential for increased threats to U.S. 
citizens and interests in Panama," the Reagan Administration dispatched about 
1,800 fresh troops to Panama. The troops consisted mostly of police forces and 
a helicopter task force that could move U.S. troops quickly in case of an 
attack on the Panama Canal or on U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the force was a 300-man rifle company from Ft. Ord, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Before reaching his tentative decision to boost the U.S. military presence in 
Panama, Bush called the attack on Endara one of a series of "blatant attempts 
at intimidation" by the Noriega regime. 
</P>
<P>
Bush tried to reach Endara by telephone late Wednesday afternoon but could not 
get through, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said. Bush asked 
Ambassador Davis to contact Endara "to commend him for his strength in standing 
up to the Noriega forces." 
</P>
<P>
Bush once again accused Noriega of conducting a "fraudulent election" that 
seems designed to deny democratically won power to the general's opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"He has now escalated this to include violence against opposition leaders 
including Mr. Endara," Bush said. "This action underscores that Gen. Noriega 
does not have the interests of the Panamanian people at heart." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Options Considered 
</P>
<P>
The attack increased the urgency with which U.S. senior policy-makers were 
weighing steps to react to Sunday's election in Panama. Officials have said 
that the Administration was considering a number of actions, from economic 
sanctions to military force, to back up demands that Noriega step down. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has contacted several Latin American leaders seeking their support for 
sanctions against Noriega, the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher kept up the Administration's public 
criticism of the Panamanian regime: "Having failed to rig the election in 
advance, Noriega is now doing everything he can to steal it after the fact 
despite the clear message from the people of Panama." But Boucher refused to 
discuss action that the United States might take. 
</P>
<P>
American military personnel in Panama were advised Wednesday afternoon to stay 
out of all public areas except for essential business and to remain on U.S. 
military facilities until further notice. The warning -- code-named "Personnel 
Movement Limitation Charlie" -- is the second-highest alert status for U.S. 
military personnel overseas. 
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon spokesman said that U.S. troops and civilian Defense Department 
employees in Panama were "sticking pretty close to home," especially after 
learning that Panamanian riot forces were using acid in water cannons trained 
on demonstrators.

MAJOR INSURER AETNA DECLARES MORATORIUM ON NEW POLICIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, the ninth-largest seller of property and casualty 
insurance in California, has declared a moratorium on sales to new customers of 
all auto, homeowners and commercial liability policies because of uncertainty 
about how the state will enforce Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not at present writing new policies, at least until a number of issues 
that were not resolved in last week's Supreme Court decision are dealt with," 
said Aetna spokesman Jason Wright on Wednesday from the company headquarters in 
Hartford, Conn. He emphasized, however, that existing policies are continuing 
to be renewed. 
</P>
<P>
Aetna last year sold $103 million of private passenger auto insurance in 
California, $64 million of homeowners insurance and $451 million of commercial 
liability insurance, Wright said. On a monthly basis, sales to new customers 
would represent only a tiny fraction of that total business. 
</P>
<P>
The company's large health insurance and workmen's compensation business will 
not be subject to the moratorium, Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, a spokeswoman for state Insurance Commissioner Roxani 
Gillespie said Aetna is the only carrier to have declared such a sales 
moratorium since the Supreme Court upheld most of Proposition 103 last 
Thursday. However, the Travelers group of companies announced its own 
moratorium last November and said last week it would continue it. 
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said the department would reserve other comment on the matter 
until a news conference Gillespie has scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 103 has a clause requiring insurance companies to sell auto 
policies to those qualifying for a "good-driver discount," but that clause does 
not take effect until Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Wright said Aetna's managers cannot say how long the halt in sales to new 
customers may last. 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking a deep breath, letting the dust settle and trying to get some 
idea on how the California Insurance Department is going to resolve a bunch of 
issues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"With the new law in effect, you've got a whole new regulatory framework, and 
it's not set forth as to how it will operate. You can apply for exemptions from 
the prescribed rollbacks and use the rates you file, subject to their review. 
But if they disagree with what you're charging, you have to refund. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to see how that process is going to be run. We're concerned, however, 
because at this point, we can't quantify our risk in selling new policies. We 
really don't know what we're going to be able to charge for them, and whether 
we will be able to recoup our costs. We've got shareholders to consider." 
</P>
<P>
Wright also noted that the territorial rating system under which many prices 
have been set differently in various neighborhoods may not be permitted as much 
in the future, and he said Aetna wants to see what the Insurance Department 
does about that. 
</P>
<P>
Theresa Whitmarsh, speaking for the Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of 
California, said that if moratoriums were to spread, it could destabilize the 
market and cost insurance agents substantial commissions on new sales. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the state Insurance Department said Wednesday morning that 58 
companies have so far taken at least preliminary steps to apply for exemptions 
from the 20% rate rollbacks from 1987 levels mandated under Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
Some company executives have said they do not feel required to make such 
applications until the Supreme Court decision formally becomes final on June 3, 
30 days after it was rendered. 
</P>
<P>
The insurance industry plaintiffs who unsuccessfully brought suit to have the 
Supreme Court strike down all of Proposition 103 as unconstitutional have until 
September to decide whether to appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Industry attorney Allen M. Katz, who last week indicated a decision on an 
appeal would come within days, said this week it may not come for quite awhile 
yet.

2,000 IN FILLMORE CHASED FROM HOMES BY TOXIC THREAT, THE SECOND IN ONE WEEK 
</P>

<P>
For the second time in a week, officials in this Ventura County agricultural 
town moved thousands of residents from their homes early Wednesday after a fire 
sparked fears of a toxic cloud. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 residents were allowed to return to their homes at 7:45 a.m. 
Wednesday as firefighters hosed down a truck carrying a load of sawdust and 
rags soaked by paint and paint-thinner. The truck was bound from a Compton 
furniture factory for the Casmalia toxic waste dump in Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
A half-mile section of Highway 126 was closed for more than seven hours as 60 
firefighters and 12 fire companies battled the fire that spontaneously ignited 
while the driver dozed in the cab. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of smoke, and it smelled funny," said 78-year-old Lou Riesgo, 
who watched the drama unfold from her front window. "Later I had a numb 
sensation under my nose and my stomach ached." 
</P>
<P>
On May 4, about 5,000 Fillmore residents were roused from their sleep to flee 
the potentially toxic fumes of a fire that broke out at a garden-supply store 
in the town's business district. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like, 'Oh brother, didn't we just do this?' " said Darryl Dunn, a 
senior deputy with the Ventura County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters this week were especially concerned about the volatile compounds 
of toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene, which can easily vaporize, causing nose 
and throat irritation and nausea, said Capt. Norm Stafford, of Ventura County 
Fire Department's Hazardous Incident Response Team, which was called to the 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
Air and water samples taken at the scene did not contain contaminants, but 
firefighters built sand dikes to contain water used to douse the fire, said Pat 
Askren, chief of Fillmore's volunteer fire department. The company that was 
hauling the waste, Whittier Drum &amp; Vacuum, will be asked to pay for the 
cleanup, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol also planned to ask the Los Angeles district 
attorney's office to file a misdemeanor charge against the company for failing 
to clearly mark the truck as a carrier of hazardous waste, as required by law. 
</P>
<P>
"If the driver was not available, the responders wouldn't have known what's on 
board," said CHP Officer Daniel McDermott. "Instead of rushing up to put out 
the fire, they know to put on a safety suit." 
</P>
<P>
The driver, Mike Marisal, 31, of Wilmington was cited for failing to take the 
most direct route to the dump, which would have been along Highway 101, 
McDermott said. The furniture company, Good Bedrooms &amp; Good Tables, was 
cited for failing to indicate hazardous cargo on a shipping bill, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, which blanketed the city's east side with smoke, was spotted at 2 
a.m. by a sheriff's deputy traveling along Highway 126.

CHILDREN RELATE HAUNTING ACCOUNT OF ECCLESIA DEATH

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With her hair pulled back in colored barrettes and her blue jeans cuffed at the 
ankles, 10-year-old Faith Lynette Cox came to the courthouse here last week and 
told the story of her best friend's death. 
</P>
<P>
She told of kneeling beside the battered body of 8-year-old Dayna Broussard, 
shaking the girl in a futile attempt to revive her. 
</P>
<P>
"I was saying, 'Dayna, wake up! Dayna, wake up!' . . . Her eyes was just open 
and she was just laying there." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Basis of Charges 
</P>
<P>
Eight other children had come earlier to offer testimony about the death of the 
daughter of Eldridge Broussard Jr., founder and spiritual leader of the Los 
Angeles-based Ecclesia Athletic Assn. Their testimony has provided the 
foundation of the prosecution's case against the four adult followers of 
Broussard who have been accused in the death. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony and final arguments in the trial, which for three weeks has 
fascinated this tiny mill town, are expected to conclude today. It will then be 
left to a jury to resolve a complicated case that has torn asunder Broussard's 
highly regimented association. 
</P>
<P>
The child witnesses grew up with Ecclesia and were the focus of Broussard's 
dream to help black youngsters survive ghetto life through a strict regimen of 
religion, athletics and discipline. Now, they and about 40 other Ecclesia 
children are in foster homes in Oregon. They are separated from their parents 
-- who have stuck by Broussard -- because authorities say they received 
floggings similar to the one that allegedly cost Dayna her life. 
</P>
<P>
"In a sense," said defense attorney Tim Lyons, "we are pitting the testimony of 
the parents against the children, in that each and every adult member considers 
themselves a parent of these children." 
</P>
<P>
Said the mother of defendant Willie Chambers: "Those children were like his 
own. . . . To have to go through something like this, it's kind of like seeing 
your own children." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defendants in Case 
</P>
<P>
Chambers, 35, and the other three defendants -- Constance Jackson, 39; Brian 
Brinson, 31; and Frederick Doolittle, 28 -- are charged with manslaughter and 
face a maximum of 20 years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Broussard, who was in Los Angeles at the time of his daughter's death, has 
placed himself squarely in the defendants' camp. He was to have testified 
Wednesday as the final defense witness but, in a surprise decision, defense 
lawyers rested their case without calling him. 
</P>
<P>
The trial has not been confined to the central mystery of who killed Dayna 
Broussard. It also has cast new light on the lives and beliefs of the 
Broussard's followers who, bound by religious convictions and a shared vision 
of a better life for their children, became ensnarled in one of Oregon's most 
celebrated criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
The facts of the case begin in the fall of 1988, when the Ecclesia children, 
along with some adults in the group, went to a farmhouse the group maintained 
in rural Oregon, about 25 miles from here. At the time, the rest of the adults 
were renovating the South-Central Los Angeles building where the group has 
lived communally for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
In voices so soft the prosecutor had to repeatedly ask them to speak up, the 
youngsters talked about their daily lives in Oregon, a routine that consisted 
primarily of tending to the garden, memorizing the Book of Romans and 
exercising, mostly by performing jumping jacks -- for as long as two hours at a 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"We did, like, 5,000 or 10,000 jacks, and then we ate raw zucchini and 
tomatoes, and then we did aerobics, and then I think we ate dinner, and then we 
did Romans, and then we laid down," said one 9-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
They also spoke about Dayna Broussard, a strong-willed, athletic child who, at 
4 feet, 8 inches and just 60 pounds, was too tall and too skinny for her age. 
</P>
<P>
Dayna, they said, ran afoul of her elders on the morning of Oct. 12, a 
Wednesday, when she swiped a piece of zucchini from another child's plate. When 
Jackson tried to spank her with a paddle as punishment, the youngster bit the 
woman's thigh, clamping down so hard that one of the other adults had to pry 
her off. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Call to Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
The adults called Broussard in Los Angeles, looking for guidance, evidence in 
the case showed. He instructed Chambers to discipline his daughter in front of 
the other children. 
</P>
<P>
The discipline began that night and continued on the next. The children were 
awakened and rounded up into the garage of the farmhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Alfred French asked Faith Cox to tell him what happened on the 
second night. She spoke breathlessly, in rapid fire. 
</P>
<P>
"Willie and Brian grabbed her, and they just threw her on the floor . . . and 
then Brian was holding her legs, and Fred was holding her arms, and Willie was 
just hitting, hitting her real hard, and Little El was just counting." 
</P>
<P>
What was Willie hitting Dayna with? 
</P>
<P>
"With the black hose." 
</P>
<P>
And why was Little El -- Broussard's son, Eldridge III -- counting the number 
of lashes his sister received? 
</P>
<P>
"Because Willie told him to." 
</P>
<P>
In all, the prosecution contends that Dayna was whipped more than 500 times -- 
over a period of two hours -- with a braided electrical cord, the black rubber 
hose, a weight-lifting belt, a bamboo stick and a piece of PVC pipe that 
shattered when it hit her leg. Throughout the trial, French has shown these 
implements to the child witnesses, as well as the jury. 
</P>
<P>
The state also contends that the defendants spit water in Dayna's face and 
stuffed a sock in her mouth to keep the neighbors from hearing her screams. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, when she complained she could not breathe, the children recalled 
that Dayna was hung out the garage window, her arms and legs dangling. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors asked Faith what happened after Dayna was removed from the 
window. 
</P>
<P>
"Willie told me to go over there and shake Dayna. . . . Her eyes was just open 
and she was just laying there like this and, then, she had a purple dent right 
there," Faith said, pointing to her own forehead. 
</P>
<P>
"And did she answer you when you called her name?" 
</P>
<P>
"No," the fourth-grader replied quietly. 
</P>
<P>
The defense has offered a far more subdued account. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers say the children's testimony has been exaggerated, and that 
most of Dayna's disciplining was theatrics, with Chambers hitting the floor, 
and not the child, in an attempt to scare the other youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by his lawyer to estimate how many times he struck Dayna, Chambers 
replied: "I think with all the theatrical performance, I would say anywhere 
from 60 to 75." 
</P>
<P>
Chambers and Brinson both told the jury that they draped Dayna out the window 
to give her some fresh air, and that they became worried about her when they 
took her down. 
</P>
<P>
"She took two breaths, and then it was like she was falling off to sleep," 
Brinson said. "I had a nagging feeling about it. And Fred (Doolittle) did as 
well. I didn't want her to go to sleep. I remember putting my ear close to her 
face. The breathing seemed very faint." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taken to Fire Station 
</P>
<P>
So, Brinson testified, they wrapped the child in a sleeping bag, loaded her in 
a van and took her to a local fire station, stopping twice along the way to 
phone Broussard in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
As part of their defense, the criminal lawyers have also produced former Oregon 
medical examiner William Brady, who conducted an independent autopsy and -- 
with a variety of colorful computer-drawn graphics -- contradicted the 
testimony of the current medical examiner, Larry Lewman. 
</P>
<P>
According to Lewman, Dayna died from a head injury suffered in the beating. But 
Brady said it wasn't the beating that killed Dayna. Rather, he said, she died 
of respiratory failure as a result of being hung out the window. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers are expected to use this information to argue that Dayna died 
while the defendants were trying to help rather than hurt her. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the case, the defendants have been affable, even cheerful. They are 
likable people, and for those who know them, this makes Dayna's death even more 
difficult to reconcile. Chambers' mother, Doris Ridley, flew up from Los 
Angeles to watch her son testify, saying she felt he could use the moral 
support. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been very devastating to me," she said. "You don't raise a child for 35 
years and not know their nature. He's basically a very quiet, conservative man. 
He's not vicious . . . probably a little temperamental, but not vicious. I 
didn't raise a vicious killer." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Open to Press 
</P>
<P>
Chambers himself, like the other defendants, is reluctant to talk to the press. 
Once during the trial, however, they asked a reporter for a ride home to the 
farmhouse in rural Sandy where they allegedly beat Dayna to death. 
</P>
<P>
On the scenic 45-minute drive along country roads, the conversation concerned 
the stark contrasts between life in Oregon and Los Angeles. Doolittle remarked 
that at night, he likes to go outside and look at the stars, something he 
cannot do in the city. 
</P>
<P>
At the two-story farmhouse, other less pleasant differences were apparent. 
There is graffiti scrawled across the white shingles -- painted over but still 
visible -- and it is not of the Los Angeles gang variety. 
</P>
<P>
"Child Killers Go Home," says one of the milder epithets. 
</P>
<P>
Broussard, who largely has kept out of sight since January, was inside the 
house. He leaned out a second-floor window, and for about five minutes talked 
briefly of his distaste for the press, his plans to host a syndicated 
television talk show and his desire to someday "salvage" the religious and 
community work he began in Los Angeles more than a decade ago. Then, he 
disappeared from view. 
</P>
<P>
While Broussard did not attend the trial, his presence was felt. 
</P>
<P>
As he began questioning each of the children, French, the prosecutor, asked 
them about their relationship to the man they call "Big El." 
</P>
<P>
"I just remember he was the leader," said Naquieta Cox, Faith's 12-year-old 
sister. 
</P>
<P>
"Well," declared Joe Williams, 14, "he is my big brother, a teacher, a father." 
</P>
<P>
The feelings of the adults toward Broussard were equally evident. On the 
witness stand Chambers' face brightened only once: when he described a 
gathering in which Broussard, unaware that there was a woman in his audience 
who had attempted suicide, began preaching about that topic. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so poignant and direct," Chambers told the jury. "I knew that nobody 
told Eldridge about this woman. . . . There was a realness in the air of a God, 
or a Jesus." 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers spent much of their time trying, in Lyons' words, to persuade 
the jury that Broussard is not the leader of "some wild-eyed cult from Los 
Angeles." They introduced a considerable amount of evidence that had nothing at 
all to do with Dayna's death, but much to do with Ecclesia and its members. 
</P>
<P>
Chambers, who had worked as a meat cutter in a grocery store, talked at length 
about how he used those skills to open a pizza parlor and "gourmet meat shop" 
in Ecclesia's Los Angeles building.

RENEWED VIOLENCE, MORE STRIKES SHATTER CALM IN SOVIET ENCLAVE

Renewed ethnic violence and more strikes have been reported in the disputed 
southern Soviet region of Nagorno-Karabakh, prompting authorities to tighten 
security in the Armenian enclave inside Soviet Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
At least seven people have been injured since Friday in violence that shattered 
a four-month calm, Tass reported late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The official news agency seemed to leave open the possibility of more unrest, 
saying the situation remained "tense and complex" and that calls were growing 
louder for an extended general strike and civil disobedience campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Armenian residents of Nagorno-Karabakh said by telephone Saturday that they had 
started new strikes. 
</P>
<P>
Military and civilian officials increased surveillance on roads, lengthened a 
curfew and posted soldiers between Armenian and Azerbaijani neighborhoods, Tass 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Three-fourths of Nagorno-Karabakh's 162,000 people are ethnic Armenians, mostly 
Christian, but it has been an enclave in mainly Muslim Azerbaijan since 1923. 
More than 90 people were killed in Armenia and Azerbaijan last year in ethnic 
strife. In January, the Kremlin put the enclave under Moscow's direct control 
in an attempt to halt the bloodshed.

Nine foreign journalists were expelled Wednesday, accused by the government of 
spreading misinformation on the political crisis, a government spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"These foreign correspondents have been misinforming in their dispatches on the 
electoral process. Consequently, the Social Communications Media Bureau has 
decided to ask them to leave the country immediately," Luis Romero Villalobos, 
the bureau director, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Among those expelled were Charles Jaco, an American working for Cable News 
Network, and Michael Drudge and Ruben del Castillo of the U.S. government's 
Voice of America, Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
Also expelled were Domenique Petite and Arturo Gudino of Agence France-Presse, 
Jose Melendez and Javier Rojas of the Mexico City newspaper Excelsior, Joaquin 
Ibarz of the Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia and Lafit Fernandez, a Costa Rican 
journalist. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, four American reporters were taken into custody in the capital 
and detained for about two hours, the journalists said. 
</P>
<P>
William Branigin of the Washington Post, Charles Lane of Newsweek magazine, 
Philip Bennett of the Boston Globe and Kenneth Freed of the Los Angeles Times 
said they were driving through downtown Panama City when riot police stopped 
them. 
</P>
<P>
During the more than two hours that four reporters were held, Branigin and 
Freed were handcuffed so tightly together that their circulation was impaired 
and bruises remained the next day. In addition, the Panamanian security agent 
constantly pushed and shoved and verbally abused the two reporters before his 
superior claimed that the whole incident had been a misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the same agent threatened Freed for complaining about the abusive 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities apologized for the detention, saying it was a misunderstanding.

ON INDEPENDENCE DAY, SHAMIR CITES ARABS' HATRED OF ISRAEL

Israel on its 41st anniversary still faces hate-crazed violence from Arabs who 
refuse to accept its existence, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Two Palestinians were killed and at least 13 others were wounded in scattered 
confrontations in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip despite harsh measures 
imposed on Independence Day, according to Arab reports. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day, the military maintained curfews on roughly 1 million 
Palestinians, including the entire Gaza Strip, and prohibited West Bank 
Palestinians from entering Israel in an effort to prevent violence. 
</P>
<P>
Israelis jammed parks celebrating their national holiday with picnics and 
barbecues after a night of revelry, street festivals and fireworks. In 
Jerusalem, President Chaim Herzog hosted the foreign diplomatic corps, and 
Mayor Teddy Kollek held a reception at the newly opened Citadel museum near the 
walled Old City's Jaffa Gate. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews aired on Israel Radio, Shamir said the Israeli army is handling 
the 17-month-old Palestinian uprising with courage and integrity but at the 
moment "without complete success." 
</P>
<P>
"Israel is under many pressures and threats especially related to her 
security," Shamir said. "I would say to ourselves -- 'Let's keep things in 
proportion.' 
</P>
<P>
"The truth which we have to see and come to terms with is that the Arabs have 
not yet reconciled themselves to our existence and our independence. The 
expression of this is the violence and the insane hatred we have to stand up 
against," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shamir Hospitalized 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's comments were made in interviews recorded before he was hospitalized 
Wednesday afternoon for medical tests at Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital. Shamir, 
73, struck his head in a fall at his home Tuesday night and later complained of 
discomfort, an aide said. 
</P>
<P>
"He felt weakness a little bit, and his doctors decided he should be 
hospitalized for checks," the aide said. "There appears to be nothing serious." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir aides said they expect him to be released by Friday. A hospital 
spokeswoman said the prime minister was resting comfortably, receiving guests 
and working in his room.

Syrian gunners blasted Lebanon's presidential palace, army headquarters and the 
U.S. ambassador's residence Wednesday, and gunmen stormed the central prison in 
Muslim West Beirut, freeing 189 convicts. 
</P>
<P>
A special squad of Beirut police recaptured 95 of the escapees despite 
shellfire across the divided city, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said 10 people were killed and 89 wounded in Wednesday's duels between 
Christian army units and their Syrian and Druze militia foes. That raised the 
overall toll to 337 people killed and 1,323 wounded since the latest round of 
fighting, believed to be the most destructive of Lebanon's 14-year-old civil 
war, erupted March 14. 
</P>
<P>
One salvo crashed into the building housing the state-run Channel 7 television 
station in West Beirut during the 8:30 p.m. newscast. The announcer ducked, 
then ran, and the station went off the air. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy said Ambassador John McCarthy's two-story villa was hit, but 
there were no casualties. McCarthy and his family are abroad. It was the third 
time the house has been hit in the past two months. Earlier shelling destroyed 
the dining and living rooms and the garage.

ETHICS PANEL WIDENS PROBE OF WRIGHT'S FAST OIL PROFIT 
</P>

<P>
In a new setback for Speaker Jim Wright, the House Ethics Committee decided 
Wednesday to expand its investigation of an unusual Texas oil well deal that 
gave him a quick profit of $340,000 last year, although other investors in the 
well still have not made any money from it. 
</P>
<P>
The panel apparently was not satisfied with an explanation of the complex 
transaction provided last week by Morris D. Jaffe, a San Antonio financier and 
veteran Democratic Party fund-raiser, and his son, Douglas, who have termed it 
an "entirely legitimate business deal." 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles) said additional witnesses would be 
called to give testimony next week on the so-called Sabine Lake investment by 
Mallightco, a firm in which Wright and his wife, Betty, held a half-interest. 
Dixon did not provide any names. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Handled by Blind Trust 
</P>
<P>
Although the decision appeared to be a blow to Wright's hopes for an early end 
to the 11-month-old investigation, Mark Johnson, a spokesman for the Speaker, 
said: 
</P>
<P>
"We still don't think Sabine Lake will lead to anything. It was entirely 
handled by the blind trust set up by the Speaker and approved by the Ethics 
Committee." 
</P>
<P>
In other developments, Wright's lawyers Wednesday asked the panel to drop the 
major charges against him on grounds that the committee ignored its own rules 
and legislative history in approving the "statement of alleged violation" 
against the Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
His attorneys said there is no legal basis for one charge that he schemed to 
evade a House limit on outside earnings by bulk sales of his book because of a 
"total exemption" for book royalties in the ethics standards. 
</P>
<P>
They also argued that lawmakers never intended that a person like George A. 
Mallick Jr., a Ft. Worth developer and friend of the Speaker, would be 
considered a person with a "direct interest" in legislation. Wright is accused 
of improperly accepting $145,000 in gifts from Mallick, who, according to the 
accusation, had such an interest. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on other requests filed Tuesday by Wright's expanded defense team, the 
panel agreed to provide him immediately with any evidence that would tend to 
clear him of the allegations and modified a previous rule that would make 
witnesses at the preliminary inquiry more available for interviews by the 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
But the committee rejected his plea to prevent the committee's special counsel, 
Richard J. Phelan, from having informal contacts with panel members unless one 
of the Speaker's lawyers was present. 
</P>
<P>
Wright and his attorneys argued that Phelan, a Chicago lawyer hired especially 
to run the investigation, was having an undue influence over the committee 
during one-on-one dinners with several of its members. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon excoriated Wright's expanded team of defense lawyers for charging that 
Phelan had distorted testimony of witnesses and shown poor legal scholarship in 
his 276-page report that recommended the filing of charges. 
</P>
<P>
The accusations, according to Dixon, are "totally inaccurate, totally wrong and 
an exercise in bad judgment by the respondent's attorneys." Asked whether his 
remarks also applied to Wright, who made a similar stinging attack on Phelan on 
Tuesday, Dixon declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Comment From Jaffes' Lawyers 
</P>
<P>
In the Sabine Lake inquiry last week, attorneys for the Jaffes said they were 
not aware of Wright's involvement when the Jaffes sold a 4% interest in the 
well to Mallick, who was acting on behalf of Mallightco. Mallick and his wife 
owned the other 50% of Mallightco. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Mallightco's interest in the well -- 2.5% -- was transferred to a West 
German firm for a loan of $440,000 that was to be repaid only from drilling 
revenues. Despite favorable geological reports on gas reserves, however, no 
production followed, despite $4 million worth of drilling, and the well was 
capped last September. 
</P>
<P>
After deducting about $90,000 of the loan proceeds for drilling costs, the 
remaining $350,000 was transferred to Mallightco on May 10, 1988. Wright's 
shares in the firm were bought from his blind trust for about $340,000.

HAL WALLIS' IMPRESSIONIST PAINTINGS BRING $39.6 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Eight shimmering Impressionist pictures from the collection of the late film 
producer Hal B. Wallis sold for $39.6 million Wednesday night in an auction 
that totalled nearly $173 million in sales of Impressionist and modern art. 
</P>
<P>
An international crowd of art aficionados braved rain and winds to attend 
Christie's exclusive sale, the last night of a series of big-ticket auctions 
here. In a little more than two hours the Park Avenue auction house sold 86 
works of art -- 45 of them for more than $1 million apiece -- and set records 
for eight artists. 
</P>
<P>
"Le Parlement, Coucher de Soleil," Claude Monet's glowing depiction of the 
British Parliament illuminated by a fiery sunset, brought the sale's top price 
of $14.3 million, more than twice its top estimate of $7 million. An 
unidentified European collector bought the 1904 oil that Wallis purchased for 
$215,000 in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Monet's "Asters," a sparkling painting of a vase of flowers on the edge of a 
table, also soared past its predicted price of $5 million to $7 million, 
selling for $9.35 million to a woman in the crowded sale room, later identified 
as a European private collector. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stays Within Estimate 
</P>
<P>
"Sur la Scene," Edgar Degas' pastel of a ballerina taking a bow, also valued at 
$5 million to $7 million, stayed within its estimate and sold for $6.6 million 
to an anonymous American collector. Wallis paid $180,000 for the drawing in 
1959. 
</P>
<P>
"Mother, Sara and the Baby," a charming domestic scene by Mary Cassatt, brought 
$3.85 million, just above its low estimate of $3.5 million. A river view by 
Camille Pissarro brought $2.31 million from a telephone bidder -- well above 
its expected price of $1 million to $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Wallis sale was a bonanza for collectors who can afford to buy such 
high-quality examples of wildly popular Impressionist works, but the auction 
was a disappointing loss to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Wallis, who 
built his collection from 1958 to 1971, was a trustee of the museum for 20 
years before his death in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The Wallis Foundation, which owned the paintings, made an outright gift of a 
Paul Gauguin canvas to the museum in 1987 and loaned the rest of the artworks 
under an arrangement that foundation directors called a "permanent loan." 
Museum supporters had hoped the entire collection would be donated, but it was 
never legally promised to the museum.

<P>
As the Impressionist art market escalated, foundation officials decided that 
the paintings should be sold to benefit medical and conservation causes 
supported by the foundation. The Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage is 
a major recipient of foundation support, according to Brent Wallis, the late 
collector's son. 
</P>
<P>
The Wallis sale was the opening event of the Wednesday evening auction, which 
far exceeded Christie's most optimistic forecast. 
</P>
<P>
"La Loge," Pierre-Auguste Renoir's tiny (10 1/4-inch-by-8 5/8-inch) painting of 
a couple in an opera box stunned the audience when it sold for $12.1 million -- 
far beyond its estimate of $2.5 million to $3.5 million and the second highest 
price in the sale. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Upstaged by Picasso 
</P>
<P>
"Farm in Brittany," an 1894 work by Gauguin that treats rural France to a 
tropical color scheme, was expected to bring the sale's top price, but it sold 
for $6.82 million, just below its low estimate of $7 million. Gauguin's 1892 
Tahitian landscape, "Mata Mua," set a record of $24.2 million for the artist 
Tuesday night at Sotheby's, but was upstaged by a $47.85-million Pablo Picasso 
self-portrait. 
</P>
<P>
The Gauguin in Christie's Wednesday night auction was the most expensive of 17 
landscapes from the collection of Dain and Daniel Crow Searle, a great-grandson 
of Gideon Daniel Searle, the founder of G. D. Searle &amp; Co. pharmaceutical 
firm. The 17 paintings brought a total of $34.28 million, exceeding the high 
estimate of $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
Several paintings in the Searle collection commanded larger than anticipated 
prices. A rooftop view of a village by Austrian expressionist Egon Schiele 
brought $5.94 million, well above its high estimate $3.5 million and a record 
for the artist. 
</P>
<P>
This week's marathon of Impressionist and modern art sales will wind up today 
at Christie's with an auction of about 160 paintings and sculptures, valued at 
$16 million to $22 million, and about 130 watercolors and drawings, expected to 
bring between $11 million and $15 million. When those figures are added to 
Tuesday's and Wednesday's sales of Impressionist and modern art, the total will 
probably exceed $450 million.

TITAN ROCKET BOOSTS SECRET PAYLOAD INTO SPACE, PROBABLY TWO SATELLITES

A powerful Titan rocket Wednesday propelled into space a secret Pentagon 
payload believed to be a pair of advanced satellites for worldwide U.S. 
military and diplomatic communications. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-story-tall, $65-million Titan 34D roared away from its launch pad and 
appeared to be flying normally as it rumbled out over the Atlantic through 
partly cloudy skies. 
</P>
<P>
The fiery exhaust ignited several brush fires that kept the launch pad area 
closed for more than an hour. There was no damage to facilities, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force did not announce the launch in advance, which has been its 
practice on military space flights for several years. It issued a brief 
post-launch statement that said only that a Titan 34D had been "launched 
successfully." It provided no information on the nature of the payload. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Pentagon tried to keep the launch secret, with more than 20,000 
employees working at Cape Canaveral and the adjacent Kennedy Space Center, it 
proved difficult for them to hide the fact that a rocket that large was going 
to be launched. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes before the Titan 34D lifted off, hundreds of workers poured out of 
buildings to watch. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Aloysius Casey, outgoing commander of the Air Force Space Division, 
told a space conference last year that the first Titan 34D launched in 1989 
would carry up two communications satellites named DSCS, for Defense Satellite 
Communications System. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the project who declined to be identified said Wednesday the 
DSCS satellites were aboard the Titan 34D. DSCS satellites are built to provide 
secure voice and high data-rate transmission for American military and 
diplomatic communications.

FORD FOUNDATION PANEL TO URGE MAJOR CHANGES IN SOCIAL WELFARE SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A prestigious Ford Foundation panel, painting a disturbing picture of problems 
facing the nation, will call for sweeping changes in the social welfare system 
from prenatal through nursing home care in a report to be made public today in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The study group of 12 leaders in education, law, business and the labor 
movement said broad changes are essential to battle "the divisions in American 
society (which) have increased in ways that threaten quality of life, peace of 
mind and the economic future." 
</P>
<P>
The panel said its specific recommendations constitute "a fundamental 
restructuring of social policy in America." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
End to Partisanship Sought 
</P>
<P>
"In 20 years, social welfare policy in America has passed from soaring 
confidence to doubt and retrenchment," the panel concluded. "There also has 
been a lot of partisan bickering and ideological warfare. The time has come to 
rise above this partisanship and to tackle our problems head-on." The 
three-year study concluded that welfare recipients who can work should receive 
benefits for a limited time, but that those who have exhausted their benefits 
and still cannot find employment should be given a public sector job. "This 
approach would dramatically change today's welfare system, which is relatively 
cheap but open-ended," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
In other major recommendations, the panel advocated providing sufficient 
federal funds so all pregnant women have access to prenatal and well-baby 
clinics, ultimately expanding Head Start so that all poor 3- and 4-year-olds 
who are not in the program can participate, and making drug and alcohol 
treatment on demand a reality for all people who need it. 
</P>
<P>
The panel also called for a broad menu of programs designed to keep youngsters 
in school and to reduce teen-age pregnancy, all coordinated by an inter-agency 
youth council established in each state and composed of senior officials from 
educational, job training and human service agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The panel recommended giving the unemployed residing in declining labor markets 
benefits as lump-sum payments so they can move to other areas of the country 
where jobs may be more plentiful. And it called for restructuring unemployment 
benefits so more funds are paid the first few weeks. Benefits would decline 
gradually as people receive job training. 
</P>
<P>
The 102-page report, titled "The Common Good, Social Welfare and the American 
Future," was designed to spark a national debate on the status of the network 
of key social programs at a time of fiscal austerity. After the report is 
formally introduced at a news conference at the National Press Club in 
Washington today, it will be sent to every member of Congress, all governors, 
big-city mayors and key federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
"Social welfare policy in the United States must be fundamentally reformed and 
modernized," the study group said. "Economic, demographic and social conditions 
have changed, but our social policies have not adapted to these changes. 
</P>
<P>
"More than 30 million Americans live in poverty. About one-quarter of young 
Americans fail to finish high school. Children who are at greatest risk of 
failure in school are now the fastest-growing segment of the school population 
and of the future work force," it said. "The related phenomena of drug abuse 
and crime create a dangerous environment in urban America as well as a drain on 
our economy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lack of Health Insurance 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, only about one-third of the unemployed receive unemployment 
insurance benefits at any point. The report estimated that between 31 million 
and 37 million people lack health insurance coverage and many others are 
under-insured. In addition, about half of U.S. workers have jobs that do not 
provide private pensions. 
</P>
<P>
"As Americans live longer, they are more likely to need protection against the 
costs of long-term care for themselves and their family members; few are 
currently prepared for this eventuality," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"Such problems signal a mounting social deficit that is as troubling as 
government budget deficits or the deteriorating physical infrastructure of 
roads and bridges." 
</P>
<P>
The Ford Foundation study group said bringing the social welfare system in line 
with the needs of modern Americans will require public and private efforts, 
spread over a number of years. "Most of all, it will require a realistic new 
consensus about our responsibilities to each other, now and in the future." 
</P>
<P>
The panel called for expanding federal nutrition programs, providing child-care 
subsidies for lower-income families through changes in federal tax laws, 
requiring employers to offer a basic package of health insurance coverage to 
all workers or to contribute an amount for each employee to a public fund that 
would finance coverage for uninsured workers, and improving federal 
supplemental security income benefits for the elderly poor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Combination of Plans Urged 
</P>
<P>
The report strongly emphasized a combination of public and private insurance to 
cover long-term health care for the elderly and called for greater public and 
private insurance for home care. 
</P>
<P>
The panel estimated that the total government cost of implementing all of its 
proposals would be an additional $29 billion a year. It proposed financing this 
increase largely through taxation of Social Security benefits that exceed 
lifetime contributions, which would yield about $97 billion in federal revenues 
over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, if a worker contributed $100,000 to Social Security during employment 
years, any benefits in excess of that amount would be reported as taxable 
income and the resulting taxes would be set aside in a special fund to provide 
federal assistance to needy people of all ages. 
</P>
<P>
Such a fund, the study group said, "would reinforce the idea that America is 
one society with a variety of unmet needs, a place where each group has a stake 
in what happens to all others." 
</P>
<P>
"The children and workers of today are also the elderly of tomorrow, and 
elderly Americans have an immense concern for the well-being of their own and 
the nation's children and grandchildren," the panel said. "A fund that gives 
concrete expression to that idea would help counter the divisive 'we' versus 
'they' mentality in social welfare policy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Members of Panel Listed 
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the executive panel was Irving S. Shapiro, former chairman and 
chief executive officer of E. I du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. Panel members were

The former chairman of a West German firm alleged to have helped Libya make a 
suspected chemical weapons plant has been arrested, the Mannheim prosecutor's 
office said. A spokesman said Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen of the Imhausen 
chemical company was seized in the town of Bochum on suspicion of offenses 
against export laws. Imhausen-Chemie and several other West German firms are 
under investigation on suspicion of evading export laws to help Libya build a 
factory at Rabta. Libya has said the plant will make only medicines, but the 
United States and other Western governments believe it was designed to make 
poison gas. Hippenstiel-Imhausen resigned in March, saying he hoped this would 
help to clear up the affair.

Soviet Bloc delegations and the West joined forces at the World Health 
Organization's annual conference in Geneva, voting to delay for two days a 
decision on the Palestine Liberation Organization's bid for full membership. 
The vote was 56-47 with 20 abstentions, mostly by Latin American countries, 
according to an unofficial tally. Two draft resolutions are before the U.N. 
agency's assembly. One, sponsored by all 21 Arab members, would have the 
organization decide "to admit the state of Palestine." The other, designed to 
avert a showdown with the United States, which has threated to halt payments to 
the agency, would combine deferral of the issue until the 1990 assembly with a 
call for more aid to Palestinians in lands occupied by Israel.

A former U.S. Navy bomb handler, recalling the horror of losing a nuclear bomb 
at sea in 1965, said the accident may have been caused by improper preparation 
for a nuclear weapons loading drill, the San Diego Tribune reported. William 
Lane, who witnessed an A-4E Skyhawk jet equipped with a hydrogen bomb roll off 
the aircraft carrier Ticonderoga 24 years ago, said the jet's pilot apparently 
could not reach the pre-set controls with his feet to stop the plane from 
plunging into the Pacific Ocean off Japan. Lane said suspicions also focused on 
a possible failure of the plane's hydraulic brakes. Lane, of Santee east of San 
Diego, said the crew was unofficially asked to forget the incident.

Lacking a two-thirds majority, a ballot measure to raise property taxes to pay 
for new schools in the Capistrano Unified School District went down to defeat. 
The final, unofficial tally of the vote on Measure A was 10,278 to 9,420, or 
52.2% to 47.8%, the Orange County Registrar of Voters said. About 20.5% of the 
district's 96,521 registered voters went to the polls. The measure would have 
raised property taxes $100 a year on existing single-family homes and $60 a 
year on existing condominiums, apartments and mobile homes. School Supt. Jerome 
Thornsley blamed the defeat on some voters' beliefs that having inadequate 
schools would discourage new housing and that only new home buyers should pay 
for new school facilities.

The Coast Guard's on-site commander of the Exxon Valdez oil spill told Exxon

including weekly progress reports. Vice Adm. Clyde Robbins, the on-site 
commander of the Alaska oil spill cleanup, ordered Exxon to provide immediately 
a detailed operations schedule for areas outside Prince William Sound, along 
the fouled beaches southwest of Valdez that include the spectacular Katmai 
National Park wildlife refuge. In Washington, Exxon USA President W. D. Stevens

A distraught man who allegedly had just killed his ex-wife commandeered a small 
plane and held the city of Boston hostage for three hours, firing a 
semiautomatic weapon while flying within 50 feet of motorists and buildings 
before his capture. Traffic controllers at Logan International Airport said the 
pilot buzzed them repeatedly, forcing officials to close the facility for an 
hour and reroute several late-night flights. Controllers fled the tower twice. 
Alfred J. Hunter, 42, pleaded innocent to one count each of murder and armed 
robbery after a flight that began late Tuesday and reportedly included a dip 
beneath a harbor bridge. Essex County District Judge John T. Doyle ordered 
Hunter held without bail at Bridgewater State Hospital for psychiatric 
observation.

An Indian supertanker that ran aground last month off the Saudi Arabian coast, 
spilling 3.9 million gallons of oil into the Red Sea, was refloated after 
running aground for a second time, shipping officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The 276,744-ton Kanchenjunga was refloated Tuesday without damage or further 
oil spills off the Saudi Red Sea port of Gizan, gulf-based officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Maritime authorities in the Saudi Arabian port of Jidda said two tugs initially 
brought in to stabilize the vessel had to tow it about seven miles away from 
the spot where it ran aground for a second time. The authorities did not give a 
reason for the second accident. 
</P>
<P>
The Indian tanker first ran aground April 27 off Jidda, spilling 3.9 million 
gallons of Iraqi crude oil into the Red Sea and leaving a slick nearly 60 miles 
long.

Alleged satanic cult "witch" Sara Aldrete Villarreal has confessed to 
involvement in some of the ritual slaying of 15 people near the U.S. border and 
also exhibits signs of having a split personality, U.S. law enforcement 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In private, Aldrete loses that "charming aspect" she exhibits when she faces 
television cameras and seems to revert to another self, talking in detail about 
the cult's rituals, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say she has three personalities," a source at the Mexico City attorney 
general's office, who insisted on anonymity, said in an interview. One 
personality comes out when she faces the cameras and denies any involvement in 
the human slayings, another emerges when she talks to police and "the third one 
comes out when she talks to herself," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
The Houston Chronicle quoted U.S. Customs agent Oran Neck as saying that 
Aldrete has "confessed to conspiracy and involvement" in the killings. 
</P>
<P>
Neck, who spent several days in Mexico City assisting investigators, told the 
paper that "Sara has kind of lost touch with reality. . . . Her dual 
personality is coming up pretty strong right now. When you talk to her without 
the TV cameras there, she's pretty truthful. 
</P>
<P>
"She's giving a lot of data with great detail to investigators. . . . It seems 
like when the cameras come on, she kind of reverts back to this nice, young, 
clean-cut kid from Texas Southmost College," Neck said. 
</P>
<P>
"When the cameras were there, she was real nice. When she was with us, she was 
the same ol' witch," Lt. George Gavito, a U.S. investigator who accompanied 
Neck to Mexico City, said. 
</P>
<P>
Aldrete, 24, and five other cult members were arrested in a Mexico City 
apartment hide-out Saturday afternoon after a shoot-out with police.

PERSONNEL IN PANAMA ON HEIGHTENED ALERT AFTER VIOLENCE

<TEXT>
<P>
The Pentagon on Wednesday ordered all U.S. military personnel in Panama to 
remain on base or in their homes because of growing violence in the streets of 
Panama City and reports of harassment of U.S. service personnel there. 
</P>
<P>
Acting within minutes of an attack by Panamanian security forces on 
presidential candidate Guillermo Endara and other opposition leaders during an 
anti-government demonstration, the Pentagon increased its alert status for the 
20,000 U.S. troops and their dependents in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush called the attack on Endara one of a series of "blatant attempts 
at intimidation" by the regime of Manuel A. Noriega, the Panamanian strongman. 
</P>
<P>
Bush tried to reach Endara by telephone Wednesday afternoon but could not get 
through, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said. Bush asked Arthur 
H. Davis, the U.S. ambassador to Panama, to contact Endara "to commend him for 
his strength in standing up to the Noriega forces." 
</P>
<P>
And Bush once again accused Noriega of conducting a "fraudulent election" 
designed to deny democratically won power to the general's opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"He has now escalated this to include violence against opposition leaders, 
including Mr. Endara," Bush said. "This action underscores that Gen. Noriega 
does not have the interests of the Panamanian people at heart." 
</P>
<P>
The attack increased the urgency with which senior U.S. policy-makers are 
weighing steps to react to Sunday's election in Panama. Officials have said 
that the Administration is considering a number of actions, from economic 
sanctions to military force, to back up demands that Noriega step down. 
</P>
<P>
Bush contacted several Latin American leaders seeking their support for 
sanctions against Noriega, the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
A State Department official said that the attack on Endara "makes clear, if it 
wasn't already, the brutality of the Noriega regime. This is truly ugly stuff." 
</P>
<P>
But the official insisted that the Bush Administration will not be stampeded 
into acting until it has studied all available options for responding to what 
the United States considers blatant fraud in Panama's election. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher, however, kept up the 
Administration's public criticism of the Panamanian regime. "Having failed to 
rig the election in advance, Noriega is now doing everything he can to steal it 
after the fact, despite the clear message from the people of Panama," he said. 
But Boucher refused to discuss actions that the United States might take. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Immediate U.S. Action 
</P>
<P>
Other Administration officials said Wednesday night, however, that no immediate 
steps will be taken in the wake of the attack on Endara. 
</P>
<P>
American military personnel in Panama were advised Wednesday afternoon to stay 
out of all public areas except for essential business and to remain on U.S. 
military facilities until further notice. The warning -- code-named "Personnel 
Movement Limitation Charlie" -- is the second-highest alert status for U.S. 
military personnel overseas. 
</P>
<P>
"We have reports of . . . servicemen being harassed, possibly taken into 
custody, but we don't know for how long and under what conditions or when these 
things occurred," an Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
(Ambassador Davis said that five U.S. personnel were arrested by Panamanian 
authorities during the day Wednesday, Reuters news agency reported from Panama 
City. Two embassy military attaches were arrested while they were observing the 
opposition and remained in detention but "I imagine they'll be released soon," 
the news agency quoted Davis as saying. 
</P>
<P>
(Three military reservists were "arrested as spies" while taking pictures at 
the Panamanian military base at Amador Causeway but were later released, the 
ambassador added.) 
</P>
<P>
Army Maj. Kathy Wood, a Pentagon spokesman, said that officials are 
particularly worried about the safety of 5,700 U.S. personnel and their 
dependents living away from U.S. bases near the Panama Canal, including the 
U.S. Southern Command headquarters compound at Quarry Heights, on the outskirts 
of Panama City. 
</P>
<P>
All on-base housing is filled, and there is no place to shelter the off-base 
personnel, she said. But tents could be erected inside the base if the 
situation deteriorates further, Wood noted. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Rodman, a key National Security Council official, said that outrage -- 
both inside Panama and throughout the world -- over Noriega's brazen action 
might be enough to bring down the general. He compared the election in Panama 
to the one in the Philippines that led to the downfall of President Ferdinand 
E. Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Philippines, the election was stolen, but such a spotlight was shone on 
it that it became more than the dictatorship could survive," Rodman told a 
seminar sponsored by the World Freedom Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Noriega, however, Marcos was dependent on economic and political support 
from the United States. At the height of the Philippines' "people power" 
revolution, the United States withdrew its backing of Marcos, leaving him with 
no option but to resign. Washington has no similar leverage on Noriega.

MORNING BRIEFING: JORDAN MAY NOT BE THE ONLY CENTER OF ATTRACTION FOR BULLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The spotlight is on Michael Jordan during the Chicago Bulls' playoff series 
against the New York Knicks, but don't forget about center Bill Cartwright. 
</P>
<P>
Cartwright, who spent nine seasons with the Knicks before being traded to the 
Bulls last summer for Charles Oakley, also figures to play a key role. 
</P>
<P>
In the Bulls' 120-109 overtime victory Tuesday night, Cartwright had 18 points, 
14 rebounds and four assists. 
</P>
<P>
In the regular season, Cartwright averaged 12.4 points a game -- but 16 against 
the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What National Basketball Assn. team drew the largest crowds on the 
road during the regular season? 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time II: What NBA team drew the smallest crowds on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Bo, oh, Bo: How tough is Bo Jackson? Consider this: 
</P>
<P>
He broke a bat during the Kansas City Royals' 3-1 victory over Cleveland 
Tuesday night, but not in the usual way. Jackson broke the bat over his right 
thigh after striking out on a 3-2 pitch by Keith Atherton to end an 
eighth-inning rally. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson took a frustrated hop away from the plate and slammed his bat against 
his thigh. 
</P>
<P>
The bat shattered into two pieces, about 12 inches up the handle. Jackson 
dropped the pieces along the sideline and went out to his left-field position. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing's routine: New York Mets shortstop Kevin Elster's streak of 88 games 
without an error, a major league record for a shortstop, ended Tuesday night -- 
on a remarkably routine play. 
</P>
<P>
Elster dropped a two-hop grounder hit directly at him by Barry Larkin in the 
ninth inning of a 3-1 victory over the Cincinnati Reds. The ball came up on 
him, deflected off his glove and hit him in the chin. He recovered but Larkin 
beat the throw to first by a step. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe I did it on that play," Elster said. "It's not like it was a 
tough chance. It was an easy two-hopper. It was the ninth inning. It shouldn't 
have happened." 
</P>
<P>
Numbers aren't everything: K. C. Jones, who was part of the Boston Celtic 
dynasty that won eight consecutive NBA championships from 1959 to 1966 and of 
course later became the team's coach, did not have impressive statistics as a 
player. 
</P>
<P>
Jones averaged only 7.4 points a game and had a shooting percentage of 38.7. 
But this week he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of 
Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Said Celtic President Red Auerbach: "Maybe K. C. didn't score a lot. But the 
way I judge a player is, when I put him in the game, did the score go up or 
down in our favor? When K. C. was in there, the score usually went up in our 
favor." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The Chicago Bulls, who averaged 17,573, which tells you 
something about Jordan's value. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer II: The Sacramento Kings, who averaged 13,590, followed by the 
Clippers at 13,914, Miami at 13,928, and Charlotte at 13,960. Charlotte, 
however, led the league in home attendance with an average of 23,172.

SIMI VALLEY ADDS TO ITS COLLECTION OF TITLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM BROWN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the coach who seems to have it all, and for a team that has come close but 
never won it all, the Southern Section 5-A Division playoffs beckon. 
</P>
<P>
And, for the fourth time in a row and sixth time this decade, Simi Valley High 
will enter the playoffs as the Marmonte League champion. Still, the 1980s have 
left Simi Valley Coach Mike Scyphers wanting -- a banner, a ring, a Southern 
Section championship. 
</P>
<P>
After his Pioneers thrashed Thousand Oaks, 14-6, Wednesday at Simi Valley, 
Scyphers spoke of the league titles, the playoff berths (nine) and national and 
statewide recognition. 
</P>
<P>
"Still," he said, "something's missing -- a CIF championship." 
</P>
<P>
And what of this team, a group that forged a 21-3 record, including 10-2 in 
league play, despite modest expectations? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we have the league MVP," Scyphers said, "but one thing about 
this team, they play as a team with solid defense and good pitching." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, don't count them out. 
</P>
<P>
In their regular-season finale, the Pioneers roughed up four Thousand Oaks 
pitchers for 14 hits -- 11 in the fifth and sixth innings when they scored 11 
times to bury the third-place Lancers. Thousand Oaks cooperated by committing 
seven errors -- three during the 11-run outburst. 
</P>
<P>
"The mistakes were devastating," Thousand Oaks Coach Jim Hansen said. "They're 
a good ballclub. You make too many mistakes and they'll just gang up on you." 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Hood led the group effort with three hits and two runs batted in; Mike 
Jenkins had two hits, including a two-run home run in the sixth inning; and 
Jeff Sommer, Brandon Banaga and Chadd Johnson each added two hits. 
</P>
<P>
Hood was involved in a fifth-inning shoving match with Thousand Oaks third 
baseman Brian Higgins that was quickly broken up, but not before both benches 
had cleared. Hood and Higgins became entangled after Hood had stolen third base 
and attempted to score when the throw bounced down the left-field line. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't really want to fight," Hood said. "It was just emotions. We both 
apologized." 
</P>
<P>
At the time, with one run home in the inning for Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks 
trailed, 4-2, courtesy of solo home runs by Chris Grodell in the first and 
fourth innings. Simi Valley, however, scored four more times in the fifth -- 
all unearned -- and six times in a seven-hit sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins (7-0) pitched the first 5 2/3 innings for the win, leaving when Scott 
Barkman's three-run home run made the score, 8-5. Thousand Oaks starter John 
Bushart (6-3) took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
And Simi Valley, which only three games ago was in danger of letting the 
balance of power slip away after losing to Newbury Park, laid claim to the 
game, league title and decade. Game, set, match. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was lost," Jenkins said of the league championship. "Newbury 
Park, they're a strong team. It really kind of surprises me. We're here, and 
we're Marmonte League champions again."

BIRMINGHAM SWIMMER PUTS ON A SHOW IN CITY SEMIFINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN HERBERT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christian Ballard of Birmingham High presented his case as the City Section's 
top swimmer by posting top marks in two events Wednesday in the City semifinals 
at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The junior won the 500-yard freestyle in 4 minutes, 38.09 seconds and the 
200-yard individual medley in 2:01.35. "I hope to go faster in the finals," 
Ballard said. "I'd like to go 4:30 in the 500 and 1:58 in the 200 IM." 
</P>
<P>
Although the 500 is the longest event in high school swimming, to Ballard it is 
a mere swim in the park to what he is used to. Ballard won the 1,650-yard 
freestyle at the YMCA National Championships in Orlando, Fla., last month, and 
participated in the same event at the U. S. Swimming Short Course National 
Championships at Chapel Hill, N. C., a month earlier. "Swimming on the high 
school level is much easier," the 17-year old Ballard said. "A lot of people 
have just started swimming, while I've been swimming for 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Grant junior Tate Hurvits led all qualifiers in the 200-yard freestyle in 
1:50.26. 
</P>
<P>
Hurvits had the second best time in the 500, winning his heat in 4:56.66. Brian 
Leven of El Camino Real won the boys' 100-yard backstroke in 55.60. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' meet, Corinne Okamura of El Camino Real and Anne Bugarcic of 
Reseda were the only Valley-area qualifiers to lead in two events. Okamura took 
the 50-yard freestyle (25.76) and 100-yard freestyle (56.70). Bugarcic captured 
the 200-yard freestyle in 2:00.17. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Vetrie of Van Nuys took the girls' 100-yard backstroke (1:05.73). 
</P>
<P>
The finals are scheduled for Wednesday at Belmont Plaza.

NUMBER ONE . . . THAT'S WHAT MASAAKI YAMASHITA, AN EXCHANGE STUDENT FROM JAPAN, 
HAS BECOME IN HIS THIRD YEAR ON THE BASEBALL TEAM AT VERDUGO HILLS HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Curt Yarrington remembers having his eyes locked on uniform No. 1 for some 
time. That particular jersey, he reasoned, might signify many things, 
especially the fact that he was numero uno as baseball coach at Verdugo Hills 
High. And, what the heck, it was also his first year. 
</P>
<P>
A few days before the 1987 season, players began to place their requests for 
jerseys. All the popular numbers went fast, those commonly tied to major league 
stars or ones that older brothers might have worn. Yarrington held fast to No. 
1, until an earnest foreign-exchange student named Masaaki (Mo) Yamashita 
walked through his door. 
</P>
<P>
Yamashita, a sophomore infielder from Japan who spoke English in carefully 
measured sentences, had prepared a tersely worded statement. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked Mo what number he wanted and he says, 'Num-ber one,' " Yarrington 
recalls, enunciating each syllable of Yamashita's request in the same cadence 
used by the player. 
</P>
<P>
This exchange followed, more or less: 
</P>
<P>
Yarrington: "No. 1? Oh, yeah?" 
</P>
<P>
Yamashita: "Exactly." 
</P>
<P>
"I ask him why he wanted it and all he says is, 'Sadaharu Oh,' " Yarrington 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, of course, was Japan's big-league answer to Hank Aaron, a national hero who 
clubbed a world-record 868 home runs in a 21-year career. 
</P>
<P>
Once Yarrington realized Yamashita's reverential reasons, he quickly agreed to 
surrender the jersey. Besides, in the back of Yarrington's mind, he knew that 
in a few short months Yamashita would be back in his homeland. Then Yarrington 
would reclaim the jersey faster than he could say trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"I had really started to get pumped up about wearing it, but then I got to 
thinking, 'Why not let him?' " Yarrington said. "I thought, 'He can have it 
this year and I'll still get it back next year.' " 
</P>
<P>
Soon thereafter, teammates started kiddingly calling Yamashita "Ichiban," which 
in Japanese means "Number One." 
</P>
<P>
Three years later -- yes, he is still here and wearing the same numeral -- the 
nickname has proven prophetic: Yamashita is now the team's best player. 
</P>
<P>
The most established youth baseball program in Japan is called Little League, 
too, and it's not a wisecrack about height. Yamashita played before coming to 
the United States, where at 5-foot-11 and 185 pounds he is one of the biggest 
players on the Verdugo Hills team. 
</P>
<P>
Seconds into his first Verdugo Hills practice, he found that the differences in 
regimen alone are pronounced (and here, it's pronounced laid back). Yamashita 
spent a few weeks trying out for his high school team before he was shipped off 
to the United States and was startled by the lack of intensity here. 
</P>
<P>
"They practice much harder there. There is no talking. Some coaches come up to 
you with a bat and slam you in the back," he says, pointing to his rear end to 
indicate that a shot to the hindquarter is indeed an effective way to get one's 
attention. "We run more and work harder (in Japan)." 
</P>
<P>
The time-honored, All-American rite of umpire baiting is a no-no in Japan, 
where batters customarily bow to the plate umpire before taking their cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't say anything to the umpire," he says. "We aren't allowed to." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, in the United States, Yamashita has found that the umpires often wish to 
speak to him, especially about the bat he uses, a huge-barreled, golden 
aluminum Rawlings model he brought from home. 
</P>
<P>
The bat, which unlike those manufactured here has no plastic cap at the barrel 
end, makes a piercing ring when it strikes the ball. On the barrel, there are 
Japanese characters. When the bat is inspected, umpires act as though they have 
just looked under the hood of a foreign car -- everything is metric and in a 
foreign language. 
</P>
<P>
"All the umps have looked at it," Yamashita says. "They all have a strange 
look, like, 'What kind of bat is this?' I say, 'I brought it from Japan. 
Everyone uses these there.' " 
</P>
<P>
Yamashita, who is second on the team with a .368 batting average, carries the 
bat in its own padded case and does likewise with his spikes. This punctilious 
practice still draws curious looks from Yarrington, who admittedly is used to 
the tobacco-spewing, unkempt Don Zimmer-types. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the first things I noticed about him was that he was very meticulous, 
very neat and orderly," Yarrington says. "Must be a cultural thing." 
</P>
<P>
Yamashita has assimilated nicely in dozens of other ways, though. He has 
developed a taste for American food, preferring meat loaf, pasta and 
hamburgers, as well as American pop music. Yamashita sometimes goes to L. A. 
dance clubs and has collected more than 100 cassette tapes. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything from metal to KROQ dance music," says senior Ryan Paskwietz, whose 
family is boarding Yamashita this year and consequently is subjected to the 
auditory assault. "He's gone nuts since we got him that tape player for 
Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
Yamashita's Western ways extend to the moussed hair that juts from under the 
bill of his baseball cap. He has attended numerous Dodger and Laker games, 
traveled to Nevada and Arizona, and through the school, helped produce a 
videotape that was broadcast on local public-access cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yeah, we've Americanized him," Yarrington says. "If his name were, say, 
Mike Yamashita, people would think he was a Japanese-American who happened to 
be on this team." 
</P>
<P>
Mo, as it turns out, is short for Masaaki, which was difficult for some 
teammates to pronounce. Masaaki (pronounced, MOS-uh-kee) also answers to 
'Saaki, the latter half of his first name. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball, Yamashita says, has helped him tie all of his experiences together. 
</P>
<P>
"I actually came over here to learn English, but I felt that playing a sport, 
any sport, that's the best way to make friends," he says. "And I'd been playing 
baseball for a long time, so that seemed like the best way to go." 
</P>
<P>
Yamashita's objective upon graduating from a Japanese college is to use his 
language skills to travel internationally as a businessman. Playing baseball at 
a racially mixed school like Verdugo Hills has helped him expand his vocabulary 
well beyond English. 
</P>
<P>
"I even learned the dirty words from Spanish, too," he says, grinning. 
</P>
<P>
And what education would be complete without a lineup of choice baseball 
cliches? When asked what his baseball goals were for the season, he included: 
"To do whatever it takes to help the team." 
</P>
<P>
Yamashita was in junior high when he realized that he could turn his knack for 
languages into a trip to the United States. After faring well on a nationally 
standardized English test in his hometown of Kyoto -- English is part of the 
standard curriculum in grade school -- he signed up for the school's 
foreign-exchange program. After taking yet another English exam and batting 
about .333 ("I got about 20 out of 60 questions right, but I guess that was 
good enough," he says), Yamashita was sent to Verdugo Hills for his sophomore 
year. 
</P>
<P>
However, administrators at Verdugo Hills, he says, misinterpreted his class 
standing and placed him in an 11th-grade curriculum. After concluding the 
1986-87 school year, Yamashita said he was led to believe he could graduate the 
following year if he returned. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, he was still several units short of graduating at the end of 
1987-88 and was forced to return for his senior year. By then, Japanese 
universities he contacted had made it clear that if he had designs on a college 
education back home, he had to finish what he started abroad. 
</P>
<P>
But at least Yamashita was ahead of most Verdugo Hills students. Despite the 
language barrier, he is a solid B student. 
</P>
<P>
"School is harder there," he says of Japan. "I was ahead in math and stuff, but 
in government and English, I was behind. I was just trying to show up every day 
and pick up what I could." 
</P>
<P>
On the baseball field, he has picked up the team in a multitude of ways. 
Yamashita has been the team stopgap, the player Yarrington goes to when there 
is a hole to plug or a fire to extinguish. 
</P>
<P>
This year alone, Yamashita has played third base, shortstop, second base, right 
field and pitcher. Once Yarrington finally rid Mo of his Oh-style batting 
stance -- the left-handed slugger habitually raised his right leg as the pitch 
approached, similar to the style used by Hall of Famer Mel Ott -- Yamashita's 
offense improved, too. 
</P>
<P>
Besides being second on the team in batting average, Yamashita is second in 
runs scored (18) and leads the team in runs batted in (20). 
</P>
<P>
"I usually put my best hitter in the No. 3 position," Yarrington said. "He's 
earned that spot." 
</P>
<P>
He has been the team's most consistent pitcher, compiling a 7-4 record. 
Yamashita pitched a four-hit shutout over Eagle Rock on Tuesday and threw a 
three-hitter and struck out a career-high 13 in a 3-1 win over Belmont on April 
25. 
</P>
<P>
He is hardly overpowering -- in fact, Slow Mo has allowed 72 hits in 52 2/3 
innings -- but has nonetheless fanned 57 batters, mainly through guile alone. 
</P>
<P>
"He has good baseball sense," Yarrington says. "He does the things that the 
good players have to do to be successful. On the mound, his mechanics are 
better than anyone on the staff." 
</P>
<P>
It should be noted that, in terms of fundamentals, some of Yamashita's 
teammates are as raw as sushi. Verdugo Hills is having a so-so season, and is 
12-10 overall and third in the Northern League at 9-6. 
</P>
<P>
Yarrington insists that without Yamashita, well, he'd rather not even think 
about it. The coach is just happy Yamashita came back for more. Twice. 
</P>
<P>
"You never know what can happen in the off-season, but when school started, 
there he was," Yarrington said. "At the time, I didn't think it was a real big 
deal if he made it or not. But looking back now and seeing what he's 
contributed, whew, I don't know where we'd be without him." 
</P>
<P>
Shy or not, Yamashita knows he is having the best year of any of the Dons' 
players, although he admits he thought it would be tougher here. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured they'd be a little better than this, but I found out that I could do 
as well as these guys," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And while this has been his breakthrough season offensively, he has previously 
won acclaim for other reasons. As a sophomore, Yamashita was given the Coach's 
Award. 
</P>
<P>
"It goes to the exemplary player," Yarrington said. "The kid who gives 100%, 
never talks back, plays any position, all that stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"There was another kid who was a senior who I could have just as easily given 
it to, but I thought Mo wasn't going to be back. But then he shows up again the 
next year, and I give it to him again. 
</P>
<P>
"But, heck, he deserves it. And this year, he'll probably get it again." 
</P>

EL SEGUNDO NINE SLIPS PAST ST. BERNARD, 6-5, FOR CAMINO REAL TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM DERMODY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After much debate -- eight innings worth -- the verdict is in: El Segundo is 
the Camino Real League baseball champ. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Llamas' single over a drawn-in St. Bernard infield scored pinch-runner Rick 
Clark with the winning run as the Eagles defeated the Vikings, 6-5, and 
captured the league title Wednesday night at El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles scored three runs in the bottom of the eighth after St. Bernard had 
jumped to a 5-3 lead in its half of the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
The victory assures that El Segundo (21-5 overall and 12-1 in league) will 
enter the playoffs as the league's top seed. St. Bernard fell to 17-5 and 11-2 
in league. 
</P>
<P>
"We took a vote on the team on whether to be champs or co-champs and it came 
out 14-0 that we wanted to be outright champs," said El Segundo Coach John 
Stevenson. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles loaded the bases against pitcher Dan Melendez to start the inning on 
a walk, an error and a hit. Dan Manjarrez's single brought El Segundo to 5-4, 
and Chris Lane singled in a run to tie the game. 
</P>
<P>
With the infield drawn in and the outfield shallow, Llamas, on an 0-2 pitch, 
poked a chopper over third base and into left, scoring Clark with the winning 
run. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the best feeling I've had in my life," said Llamas, who had struck out 
twice against Melendez. "He had me the whole night, but that last pitch was 
right there." 
</P>
<P>
St. Bernard scored twice in the top of the eighth to take the brief lead. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who improved to 9-0, was in control from the second until the eighth 
when he walked leadoff hitter Chris Richardson on four pitches. One out later, 
Sean Friedin reached on an error and pinchhitter Phil Ruhl singled home 
Richardson. Sean Dunbar's suicide squeeze plated Friedin, who had gone to third 
on Ruhl's hit. 
</P>
<P>
But Melendez (9-2) and St. Bernard couldn't hold on, to the chagrin of Vikings 
Coach Bob Yarnell. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm more disappointed that we couldn't hold onto a two-run lead," he said. 
"I'm sure we'll still be seeded pretty high, but we just didn't make the plays 
when we had to." 
</P>
<P>
The game got off to a rocky start when both teams scored three runs in the 
first inning. 
</P>
<P>
Clark retired the first two batters but walked Melendez intentionally and hit 
Al Ibarra with a pitch. Richardson poked a single to center that scored 
Melendez. Ibarra scored when center fielder Erik Evans bobbled the ball and 
Grant Hohman then singled home Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles tied the game in their half of the inning. Jeremy Carr was hit by a 
pitch to lead off and Evans grounded softly to second. Sean Dunbar fielded the 
ball cleanly, but Hohman dropped the relay and both runners were safe. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett Quaintance singled home both runners and took second on the throw to 
the plate, which was too late to nail a sliding Evans. 
</P>
<P>
After reaching third on a wild pitch, Quaintance scored on Ken Talanoa's 
fielder's choice.

BRUCKNER, CHAMINADE HAMMER MONTEBELLO IN 3-A WILD-CARD MATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Senior Chris Bruckner, soon to be spiking the ball for UCLA, had a match-high 
26 kills Wednesday night as Chaminade High swept Montebello, 15-2, 15-10, 
15-11, in a Southern Section 3-A Division wild-card playoff at Chaminade. 
</P>
<P>
Bruckner (6-foot-5, 190 pounds), a three-year starter who is averaging 26.5 
kills and seven blocks this season, committed to UCLA earlier this year and 
said he will sign a letter of intent today. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't beat UCLA volleyball," Bruckner said of the Bruins, who have won 13 
national championships since 1970. "It's No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
Chaminade (13-6), which finished second in the San Fernando Valley League, fell 
behind, 2-0, in the first game before Steve Gerevas scored seven consecutive 
points. Marc Miles then served eight consecutive points to close out the game. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Hayes had 12 kills and Fran Reyes added nine. Chaminade, seeded 12th, plays 
fourth-seeded Brentwood in a first-round match Friday at Brentwood.

rallied in each of the final three games. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi (12-5) led, 14-13, in the third game after rallying in each of the first 
two games. San Marcos led, 5-1 and 7-2, before the Celts staged comebacks. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi led in each of the final two games, 7-3 and 6-3, but San Marcos rallied, 
scoring the final 12 points of the deciding game. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Lynch led Crespi with 24 kills. Chris McGee added 17 and Brian Scully had 
12. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale d. Lynwood, 15-9, 15-5, 15-6 -- Glendale, which finished third in the

(12-5) will play at unseeded Bishop Montgomery on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Dos Pueblos d. St. Francis, 15-5, 15-2, 15-13 -- The Golden Knights (10-9), who

CS NORTHRIDGE DOMINATES CCAA SOFTBALL AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As usual, Cal State Northridge won the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
softball championship. And, as usual, the Lady Matadors dominated the 
conference's postseason awards presentations. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Dickmann, Northridge's junior All-American, was selected the CCAA's top 
pitcher in a vote of coaches. Center fielder Lisa Erickson was selected most 
valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
Also gaining first-team all-conference honors were pitcher Heather Lindstrom, 
catcher Char Schmidt, first baseman Pam Smith, shortstop Anna Getherall and 
outfielders Lonnie Artis and Erin McGuire. 
</P>
<P>
Dickmann, who has an overall record of 28-6, was 8-2 in conference play with an 
0.84 earned-run average. Erickson, a junior, batted .438 and scored 12 runs in 
20 CCAA games. She also stole seven bases without getting caught. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Boyer, who guided Cal Poly San Luis Obispo to a second-place finish, was 
named coach of the year.

KICK-BOXING TITLES ON LINE AT STRAND IN REDONDO TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven national championships in savate -- French kick-boxing -- will be decided 
tonight when the European martial art makes its competitive West Coast debut at 
The Strand, 1700 Pacific Coast Highway, Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
There will be 10 bouts beginning at 7:30. Seven will be for U.S. titles in 
internationally recognized amateur weight classes. The bouts have the sanction 
of the California Athletic Commission and will be officiated by a French 
Federation referee under European rules. 
</P>
<P>
Among contestants is Trent Suzuki, a trainer and physical therapist in the Los 
Angeles area. Winners tonight will qualify for the world championships in 
Europe this year. 
</P>
<P>
Savate was developed in France in the late 1800s, first as a form of street 
fighting before it evolved into a contact sport. Savate combines the movement 
and gloved punching of boxing with Asian martial arts kicking techniques. 
Savate has been selected as a demonstration sport for the 1996 Olympics in 
Paris and may be in 1992 in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets cost $45 ringside, $35 for reserved and $25 general admission. The 
Strand box office is taking reservations at 316-1700.

SUCCESSFUL JUMP START; 
</P>
<P>
KEEPING GOOD COMPANY HELPED DAN RAATJES GET AIRBORNE IN A HURRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was easy to distinguish teacher and student when Leo Williams and Dan 
Raatjes went through their paces in the high jump pit on a recent wind-swept 
day at Balboa Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, the NCAA champion in 1981 and fourth-place finisher at the most 
recent Olympic Trials, likes to talk. 
</P>
<P>
Raatjes, who leads the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics with a jump 
of 7-feet-1 for Point Loma Nazarene College, prefers to listen -- especially to 
anything Williams has to say. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps because the two are so different, their relationship has developed 
beyond that of occasional training partners and into friendship. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, 29, has been jumping for 20 years and won the NCAA championships 
while competing for the Naval Academy. Raatjes, 21, had never jumped until two 
years ago but heads into the NAIA District 3 championships at Point Loma Friday 
and Saturday as the favorite in an event in which he finished sixth in 
nationally last year. 
</P>
<P>
Raatjes and Williams have come from opposite directions and met on common 
ground in front of a high jump bar. 
</P>
<P>
Their first meeting, however, gave little clue to what was ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (PLNC) Coach (Jim) Crakes said he had this basketball player who was 
high jumping that he wanted me to look at," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
And Williams' assessment? 
</P>
<P>
"I said 'He's a basketball player, coach.' " 
</P>
<P>
Raatjes, 6-3, played center on the junior varsity basketball team his freshman 
year at Point Loma, but after surgery to repair stretched ligaments in his left 
ankle, he decided against continuing with the sport. As his sophomore year 
rolled around, Raatjes found himself in an athletic void. 
</P>
<P>
"I was getting bored," said Raatjes, who was a three-sport letterman at 
Greenway High School in Phoenix. "I was so used to doing something. In high 
school, I played basketball, baseball and golf, and the seasons would overlap." 
</P>
<P>
While trying to find something to replace basketball, Raatjes happened upon the 
high jump pit at Point Loma Nazarene. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd never (jumped) before, but it looked like fun," Raatjes said. 
</P>
<P>
Raatjes was long on jump and short on technique but caught the eye of Crakes. 
</P>
<P>
"I said 'You might make a pretty good high jumper if you put your mind to it,' 
" Crakes said. "I didn't see him again until the following fall." 
</P>
<P>
By that time, Raatjes had decided he wanted to try it. And that's when he 
noticed Williams working out at Point Loma Nazarene. 
</P>
<P>
Williams and Atsushi Inaoka, the Japanese national high jump champion, usually 
worked out at Balboa Stadium but would go to Point Loma for a change of pace. 
</P>
<P>
Raatjes spotted Williams and his smooth style. He watched, and he listened. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd go out on Saturday, and he'd be there," Williams said. "He would just 
watch. Then he'd ask questions, but he'd never jump with us. When we were done, 
he'd ask us when we would be back out. 
</P>
<P>
"He was so naive because he didn't know anything about the sport. But he picked 
up a lot through osmosis." 
</P>
<P>
Raatjes was a little in awe of Williams at first. Eventually, he got up the 
nerve to start asking questions. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them I was pretending I was a high jumper for Point Loma," Raatjes 
said. "After the first couple times, I was more bold, and I could talk to him. 
Now I look at him as a friend." 
</P>
<P>
Williams gave Raatjes some high jump video tapes, which Raatjes watched over 
and over. 
</P>
<P>
He went out for the Point Loma track team the following spring and jumped 6-8 
in his first competition. By the end of the season, Raatjes had gone 6-11 and 
was rated the No. 2 NAIA jumper in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks partially to an off-season weight training program, Raatjes jumped 7-0 
early this season and pushed his personal best to an NAIA-leading 7-1 at the 
Pomona-Pitzer meet last month. He has already qualified for the NAIA national 
championships at Azusa Pacific May 25-27. 
</P>
<P>
Raatjes has his eye on 7-3, which would give him both the NAIA national record 
(7-2 1/2) and the school record (7-2 1/4 by Chris Branham in 1985). 
</P>
<P>
Raatjes is a sophomore athletically but a junior academically and will get his 
degree after next season. He said he doesn't think he'll stay at Point Loma for 
a fifth year and will instead concentrate on the high jump. Raatjes is looking 
to hit 7-5 in the next three years, a level that he says might qualify him for 
the Olympic trials for the 1992 Games in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
"I need four inches for Olympic qualifying, and I have three years to see what 
I can do," Raatjes said. "I think it's possible if I keep training. 
</P>
<P>
Crakes, however, has been trying to make Raatjes aware that sooner or later, he 
will hit a plateau. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to train when you are doing well, but (Crakes) is trying to prepare 
me," Raatjes said. "But that's probably the time you need to focus and train 
harder. I can see that may happen. I haven't hit it yet, but coach keeps 
preparing me for it. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, hopefully I haven't hit it yet."

DAVE DISTEL: CONTROVERSY TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT, INTO THE VALLEY OF SPORTS . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dave Distel 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just leave civilization for 10 days and watch what happens to the world of 
sports hereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
What had been a placid pond has turned into a boiling caldron. 
</P>
<P>
Everything had been going so smoothly. The Padres had made the transition from 
Camp Tranquility to an Appetizing April. The Chargers were applauding the 
fruits of their draft. Even the Sockers were sailing comfortably into the 
playoffs. Cup-of-tea time. 
</P>
<P>
It's amazing how quickly things can get turned upside down by controversies and 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
THE BEATHARD CONTROVERSY 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Beathard, who directs football operations for the Washington Redskins, 
announces that he is resigning. He does what he does as well as anyone in the 
National Football League, so he is obviously an attractive face to unexpectedly 
hit the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Spanos, who owns the Chargers, recognizes this. He says he would like to 
hire Bobby Beathard. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Ortmayer just happens to be employed by the Chargers, and he just happens 
to do what Beathard does. 
</P>
<P>
I have heard that you can never have too many good wide receivers or offensive 
linemen or cornerbacks, but I have never heard it said that you can never have 
too many good directors of football operations. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe one of them can play quarterback and solve . . . 
</P>
<P>
THE QUARTERBACK CONCERN 
</P>
<P>
One thing the Chargers do not have is a quarterback controversy. These are 
caused by abundance rather than absence. These are caused by having both Norm 
Van Brocklin and Bob Waterfield on the same roster. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, in the midst of mini-camp, are auditioning . . . 
</P>
<P>
* A veteran who was the lowest-rated NFL quarterback for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
* A youngster coming off a severe knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
* A journeyman whose most endearing credential is that he happens to know the 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
* A rookie whose last game was against Oklahoma State in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
You all come. There's still time to get in line. 
</P>
<P>
THE BENNY BENCHING 
</P>
<P>
Never on Sunday. That's when Benito Santiago doesn't play catcher for the 
Padres. That's Parent's Day. 
</P>
<P>
Not lately. 
</P>
<P>
I turned on the television Tuesday night, of all times, and there was Mark 
Parent behind the plate. And he had been there Saturday night as well as his 
usual Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
How badly was Santiago hurt? Not at all, except maybe for pride. Suddenly, the 
man who was supposedly the best at his business in the game today was unhappily 
camped on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
It seems Jack McKeon was making a point. A catcher who can throw strikes so 
well ought to concentrate a little more on hitting them. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago was swinging at anything airborne near the plate. That must be why the 
moths are gone from the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
GETTING SIDEKICKED 
</P>
<P>
The Too-Smooth Sockers had the home-arena advantage in their Major Indoor 
Soccer League semifinal series with the Dallas Sidekicks, until they took care 
of it at the Sports Arena Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
With a one game-to-zero advantage, they cleverly turned a 4-2 fourth-period 
lead into a 5-4 defeat. 
</P>
<P>
And so now they go to Dallas Friday with the home-arena disadvantage. Most 
teams would consider this to be an uncomfortable predicament, but not the 
Sockers. 
</P>
<P>
These guys think adversity is an entree. 
</P>
<P>
MUSICAL LINEMEN 
</P>
<P>
Forgive me if I get the impression that the Chargers are putting their 
offensive line together by having contestants dance around chairs and see who 
ends up where when the music stops. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's right guard is now a backup center, when he's not working at left 
tackle. 
</P>
<P>
The 13-year starter at center will learn to play guard. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's right tackle will learn to play guard. 
</P>
<P>
Neither of last year's regular left tackles seem to land anywhere but in a 
whirlpool. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's left guard is probably being groomed to be either quarterback or 
director of football operations. 
</P>
<P>
THE RASMUSSEN BLUES 
</P>
<P>
Having noted that Dennis Rasmussen has developed a propensity for giving away 
the store in the first inning or two, I have a solution. 
</P>
<P>
Where is it written that Mark Davis' two innings have to be at the end of the 
game? 
</P>
<P>
Give Davis the ball for the first two innings, and then turn it over to 
Rasmussen. 
</P>
<P>
These might not be the most wild and crazy of controversies and concerns, but 
face it. They're all we have. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State tried to help. Al Luginbill, a bit of a controversy himself as 
football coach, tried to convince the world all along that his quarterback job 
was up for grabs when everyone knew all along it would be Dan McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
Nice try, Al. We appreciate the effort.

Julie Berman had the dubious distinction of being the only UC San Diego women's 
tennis player to lose both her matches in the Tritons' first-round and 
semifinal victories in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division III team 
championships at Claremont-Mudd College. 
</P>
<P>
But Berman, a senior playing her last college match Wednesday in the final 
against Kenyon (Ohio) College, saved her best for last, and the Tritons went on 
to an 8-1 victory for their third women's tennis title since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Kenyon would be the team to beat because we lost to them, 5-4, last 
year in the semifinals, and they basically had the same team," said Liz 
LaPlante, UCSD coach. 
</P>
<P>
The Tritons led, 3-1, after singles victories by Christine Behrens, Nancy 
Calhoun and Susan Carne. But Berman and Kristen Diels were trailing in the 
third set. 
</P>
<P>
Berman was down, 4-2, but rallied to win the tiebreaker for an emotional 6-2, 
4-6, 7-6 victory over Kathryn Lane. 
</P>
<P>
"She wanted to win so badly," LaPlante said. "I'd never seen anyone so psyched 
up, and not because it was her last match but because she had lost both her 
(earlier) matches." 
</P>
<P>
Diels then came back to defeat Stacy Bear, 6-4, 3-6, 7-5 to clinch the UCSD 
athletic program's third national title of the season. Having locked up the 
title in singles, UCSD rolled through the three doubles matches. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams entered the championship match with a chance to win their school's 
third national title this season. Kenyon won both men's and women's swimming 
titles. UCSD, which finished second to Kenyon in those meets, won championships 
in men's soccer and women's volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD, the third-seeded team, defeated top-seeded Gustavus Adolphus, 5-4, and 
Kenyon upset No. 2 Pomona-Pitzer, 6-3, to reach the finals. 
</P>
<P>
The 32-player singles and 16-team doubles tournaments start today. 
</P>
<P>
The University of San Diego and San Diego State women's teams won first-round 
matches to advance in the NCAA Division I women's team tournament in 
Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the play of Jennifer Larking, who defeated the No. 2-ranked player in 
the nation, Stacey Martin, USD defeated Tennessee, 7-2. SDSU defeated William 
&amp; Mary, 6-3, by splitting the singles matches and sweeping doubles. 
</P>
<P>
In today's second round, USD (18-7) plays second-seeded host Florida (24-2). 
SDSU (17-9) faces top-seeded Stanford (23-0) for the third time this season. 
The Aztecs two previous losses to the Cardinal were 9-0 and 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
USD, seeded 15th, took five of six singles matches from the 17th-seeded 
Volunteers. Larking, Aby Brayton, Tonya Fuller, Christine Schmeidel and Christy 
Drage won their matches. 
</P>
<P>
Schmeidel (20-5) won easily, 6-0, 6-0, and Brayton won the clincher, defeating 
Wendy Ouwendijk, 1-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7-4), but Larking was most impressive in 
defeating Martin, 6-4, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
"Jen's a great player," said Sherri Stephens, USD's coach. "I've been saying it 
for a long time, and she's been playing like it for a long time. (Martin) may 
have a better record, but Jen's played against tougher competition." 
</P>
<P>
Larking (18-8) said she knew very little about Martin (32-2), except for her 
record and ranking. "I like it that way. I can concentrate on playing my game 
rather than playing to hers," she said 
</P>
<P>
SDSU, seeded 16th, got singles victories from Sondra Mitchell, Dorey Brandt and 
Jessica Buss. Brandt teamed with Kristin Hill, Buss with Mitchell and Susan 
Hawke with Claire Bateman for doubles victories.

MISSION BAY'S LENNAN BETTER THAN WEATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Like any pitcher, Mission Bay right-hander Tony Lennan prefers to minimize his 
time on the mound by throwing as few pitches as possible. 
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday against Clairemont, Lennan didn't mind spending a little extra 
time on the mound -- it was all he could do to keep his blood flowing. 
</P>
<P>
A game that began at 3 p.m. with the sun shining and the temperature quite 
pleasant ended with a biting wind whipping across the diamond, a slight drizzle 
and a temperature at least 10 degrees cooler. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, Lennan stayed focused and warm enough to win his 10th game against one 
loss, 7-2 over host Clairemont. 
</P>
<P>
"The weather conditions were horrible," Lennan said. "I was just trying to keep 
warm between innings. It seemed like every time I went out to the mound, it 
took me forever to get loose again. I just wanted to get it over with." 
</P>
<P>
Second-ranked Mission Bay (20-3) improved to 11-1 in the City Western League 
and kept its one game lead over USDHS, which beat University City, 2-1. Mission 
Bay meets USDHS next week in a game that will probably decide the league title. 
</P>
<P>
Clairemont (11-12) fell to 7-6 in league play and remained third. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the part of the season where it's a struggle," Mission Bay Coach 
Dennis Pugh said. "The kids are really looking toward the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Lennan, who had never pitched a high school game until this season, allowed six 
hits and struck out five. 
</P>
<P>
"It just shows you that you can take a great athlete and turn him into in a 
pitcher," Pugh said. Lennan, who pitched in Pony League, had played other 
positions in high school before this season. 
</P>
<P>
Lennan surrendered his two runs in the second on two walks and a misplayed fly 
ball that the Mission Bay outfield turned into a triple. Clairemont had mild 
rallies in the third and sixth, advancing runners to second and third each 
time. In the third with two outs, a groundout to shortstop ended the threat, 
and in the sixth with no outs, Lennan struck out the side. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Bay tied the game in the bottom of the third on three walks, a 
sacrifice fly by Tommy Lefevre and a single by Guillermo Aviles. It went ahead, 
4-2, in the fourth on a walk, a hit batsman and three consecutive hits. Brandon 
Farley drove in the go-ahead run with a double down the left-field line, and 
Aviles knocked out Clairemont starter Brandon Garland and knocked in the other 
run with an opposite-field triple to the alley in right center. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Betancourt and Brian Moranda broke open the game with home runs in the 
sixth and seventh innings, Moranda's for two runs. DAVE McKIBBEN

$86 MILLION FOR CHAIRMAN'S COLLECTION; 
</P>
<P>
SUITS OPPOSE USE OF OXY FUNDS FOR BUILDING HAMMER MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Several Occidental Petroleum Corp. shareholders are seeking to block the oil 
giant's plan to spend at least $86 million on a Westwood museum to house 
Chairman Armand Hammer's art collection. 
</P>
<P>
One of a pair of lawsuits asks for a preliminary injunction that could 
immediately stop Oxy's corporate gifts to the Armand Hammer Museum of Art and 
Cultural Center, which is under construction on a site next to Occidental's 
headquarters. The museum is expected to house Hammer's extensive collection of 
paintings and lithographs on completion in the fall of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Both suits claim that Occidental's gifts are a waste of corporate assets and 
glorify the 90-year-old Hammer without significant benefit to the company. 
"You've heard of the poison pill, the white knight and the golden parachute. 
We're calling this the golden casket," said an attorney for one of the 
plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Occidental spokesman Frank Ashley said: "I would refer 
you to Page 13 of our proxy statement of April 25, which states that a special 
committee of Occidental's board of directors, consisting entirely of outside, 
disinterested directors, approved the charitable contributions for the funding 
of the museum." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Kauffman, a Philadelphia attorney who advised the directors in approving 
the contributions, said he saw little chance that the suits would block the 
gifts. "The company meticulously followed the Delaware business judgment rule" 
approving the gifts, Kauffman said. 
</P>
<P>
The suits were filed in Chancery Court in Delaware, where Occidental is 
incorporated. Hammer, Occidental and the company's directors were named as 
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
In proxy materials related to Occidental's May 26 annual shareholders' meeting, 
the company said it planned to spend about $50 million, rather than an 
initially budgeted $30 million, to build and help maintain the museum. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Occidental has already allocated $36 million for an annuity that 
will provide payments to the institution over 30 years. The company's 
first-quarter earnings of $67 million, or 24 cents a share, were reduced by 
about $24 million, or 8 cents a share, to reflect the after-tax costs of the 
annuity. 
</P>
<P>
The proxy said Occidental will also give the museum an option to purchase its 
own complex and the Occidental headquarters building in 30 years for their 
future estimated fair market value of $55 million, which will be provided by a 
lump-sum payment from the annuity. 
</P>
<P>
According to one of the suits, however, Occidental doesn't currently own the 
property and plans to purchase it under an option later this year for $55 
million -- exactly the amount the museum can pay for it in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
An Occidental attorney said the future value was determined by an independent 
appraiser. The attorney said the property wasn't expected to appreciate, 
despite the boom in California real estate, because the existing Occidental 
headquarters is "quite old" already and could be expected to deteriorate with 
time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trustee Files Suit 
</P>
<P>
The attorney said the gifts had been approved by the outside directors but 
wouldn't be finalized for weeks or even months, because the company is 
completing documents and waiting for approval from the Internal Revenue 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
The first of the the two suits was filed May 2 by Alan R. Kahn, a New York 
securities dealer and investment adviser, as trustee for an estate that owns 
700 Occidental shares. Kahn declined to comment on the suit. One of his 
attorneys said no hearing was yet scheduled on the request for a preliminary 
injunction. 
</P>
<P>
Plaintiffs in the second suit, which was filed on Tuesday, were Joseph Sullivan 
and Alan I. Brody. William Prickett, a Wilmington attorney representing the 
pair, described Sullivan and Brody as "average shareholders," but declined 
further comment. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental has revealed plans to spend $375,000 on a new book about Hammer and 
has previously made gifts to pet charities of the executive, such as the Armand 
Hammer United World College of the American West. 
</P>
<P>
But the $86-million-plus museum gift apparently angered some shareholders 
because of its sheer size. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deal Fell Through 
</P>
<P>
Large American corporations have tended to give between 1% and 2% of their 
annual pretax income to charity, according to annual studies conducted by the 
New York-based Conference Board. Occidental had $574 million in pretax income 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer conceived the idea of building the museum after backing out of a promise 
to give his art collection -- which he has claimed to be worth $400 million -- 
to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The county museum's directors had 
balked at demands by the executive that the collection be kept intact forever 
and that it be hung on a single floor that would be named for Hammer and 
supervised not by the museum staff, but by the Armand Hammer Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
In its proxy statement, Occidental said it expected to receive "appropriate 
public acknowledgement" in return for its gift. 
</P>
<P>
But one of the suits alleges that "the contributions to the Hammer Museum . . . 
serve no business purpose or corporate interest, and constitute gifts to 
defendant Hammer."

DISSIDENTS' WIN AT MAZDA PLANT STUNS UAW, FIRM 
</P>

<P>
Dissident workers opposed to Japanese-style management techniques swept to 
victory Tuesday in the first local union elections at Mazda's new U.S. auto 
assembly plant in suburban Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
The dissident victory stunned both Mazda and the national leadership of the 
United Auto Workers, which represents the Mazda workers, and raised new 
questions about how well Japanese management policies can be integrated into 
the American workplace. 
</P>
<P>
"We're upset about it, and I'm sure Mazda is upset also," said one UAW 
official. 
</P>
<P>
For the UAW, in fact, the timing of the rebellion at Mazda couldn't be worse. 
The union, which now represents workers at three of the new Japanese-managed 
assembly plants in the United States, is on the verge of calling for an 
organizing election at Nissan's Tennessee complex. Any sign of labor trouble at 
Mazda could be used by Nissan management in a campaign to oppose the UAW's 
organizing drive. 
</P>
<P>
While UAW leaders and Mazda officials tried to downplay the significance of the 
vote, the election seemed to reveal a deep-seated sense of frustration among 
the workers over Mazda's labor policies, which are similar to those used by 
other Japanese companies now opening factories all over the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Dissidents, who ran on a platform opposing union cooperation with Mazda's 
policy of kaizen, or continuous improvement, took the top two posts in the 
first election of officers at the UAW's newly created Local 3000, which 
represents the 2,700 hourly workers at Mazda's Flat Rock, Mich., plant. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Keeling, a line worker at Mazda and kaizen foe, was elected president of 
the local by a margin of nearly two to one over Bill Judson, the incumbent 
appointed to the post by the UAW's leadership when the local was first created. 
</P>
<P>
According to results released Wednesday, Greg Drudi, who ran on Keeling's 
dissident slate, also defeated incumbent Ben Hemmingway for the powerful post 
of shop chairman. In UAW locals, the shop chairman handles union affairs on the 
factory floor, while the president administers the local. 
</P>
<P>
Keeling and Drudi are allied to a larger dissident movement, called "New 
Directions," that has been contesting local and regional elections throughout 
the UAW. The New Directions group has attacked the UAW leadership's willingness 
to cooperate on joint labor-management programs in the domestic auto industry. 
</P>
<P>
Donny Douglas, president of a UAW local at General Motors and the leader of the 
New Directions movement, spoke to a meeting of Keeling's supporters just before 
the Mazda election. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Mazda officials and UAW leaders were still trying to sort out the 
impact of the dissident victory. The American personnel director at the plant 
found that he had to give Mazda's Japanese executives a quick lesson in U.S. 
labor politics. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese executives here are concerned, from the standpoint that they 
didn't expect this," said C. Robert Leadbetter, Mazda's vice president of 
personnel. "They don't know the culture in this area, they don't know about 
union politics," he added. "This is something new to them." 
</P>
<P>
Keeling could not be reached for comment Wednesday, but Judson said he believes 
that the workers felt Mazda had not lived up to rosy promises of Japanese-style 
employee involvement that were given workers when they were hired. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't feel they have had the input in decision-making that they were 
told they would have," said Judson. "Management thinks that employee 
involvement means that managers listen to what the workers say, and then go 
ahead and make the decisions themselves. The people were told in orientation 
that it meant they would be involved in the actual decision-making." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Look for Improvement 
</P>
<P>
Such worker disillusionment seems to be at the heart of the dissidents' 
opposition to kaizen, which is the basis of Mazda's labor relations philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
Kaizen, defined by management as the search for continuous improvement, 
essentially calls on all workers to constantly look for ways to improve 
productivity and quality, even if those improvements make their jobs obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the workers are given job security; they thus have an incentive to 
make their jobs easier. 
</P>
<P>
However, workers at a number of Japanese plants in this country have complained 
that such policies often lead to heavier work loads and production line 
speed-ups. 
</P>
<P>
Workers at Mazda blame the American supervisors on the shop floor for 
manipulating the Japanese labor policies to increase output. 
</P>
<P>
"Kaizen is set up to benefit both sides, but it is something you have to 
police," said Judson. "You do have supervisors who will use it strictly as a 
productivity tool." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the dissident victory, Leadbetter said Mazda remains committed to 
kaizen -- and to working with the UAW. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had good relationship with the UAW, and we expect to continue to have 
a good relationship," he said. "We just need to establish a relationship with 
Keeling."

HOUSE PANEL HANDS BUSH SETBACK ON S&amp;L BAILOUTS;

<P>
ADMINISTRATION WARNS OF VETO; PROPOSAL WOULD SET ASIDE GRAMM-RUDMAN, ADD $50 
BILLION TO DEFICIT

<P>
The House Ways and Means Committee dealt a major blow to President Bush's 
savings and loan rescue plan Wednesday by voting for a financing proposal that 
would add $50 billion to the federal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials immediately warned of a veto and said the committee's 
action would virtually destroy the fiscal discipline of the Gramm-Rudman law, 
which requires that the budget be balanced by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
"The result of today's vote in the House Ways and Means Committee is a 
mistake," Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said in a statement. "If 
adopted, this action could force us to go back to square one on both the budget 
and the savings and loan plan. It could mean months of stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the way either to lower interest rates or solve the savings and 
loan crisis." Before the vote, Brady met with committee members for more than 
an hour in private session, trying to persuade them to support the 
Administration's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The panel voted 25 to 11 for a plan that would give the S&amp;L crisis special 
treatment by waiving the Gramm-Rudman restrictions on spending. Two 
Republicans, Willis Gradison of Ohio and Raymond McGrath of New York, joined 
the panel's 23 Democrats in approving an amendment to the House S&amp;L plan 
that would use special Treasury bonds to raise the funds to close or sell 
hundreds of insolvent S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the $50 billion would be spent to pay off the insolvent firms' 
depositors, whose accounts up to $100,000 are insured by the federal 
government. Under Bush's plan, a new agency outside the federal budget would 
sell a special bond issue without adding to the formal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
But the committee voted Wednesday to make the new agency part of the federal 
budget and have the Treasury sell bonds to raise the $50 billion. Treasury 
bonds, as the safest investment issued by the government, carry the lowest 
interest rates. Using Treasury financing instead of a special new agency would 
save $4.5 billion over the 30-year life of the bonds and thus place a lighter 
burden on future taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
The amended House plan adopted Wednesday -- a preliminary one that could be 
overturned next week when the committee formally votes on a savings and loan 
rescue package -- would allow Congress to raise the $50 billion without 
violating the stringent Gramm-Rudman law. Rep. Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.) said 
similar waiver tactics could be used again and again to evade the 
budget-balancing law. "You can breach it for toxic waste or homelessness or 
whatever else comes down the pike," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Rep. Sander M. Levin (D-Mich.) said the thrift crisis is "a unique 
situation" requiring special action. 
</P>
<P>
Committee members brushed aside warnings that their move could bring a 
presidential veto and thus delay the date when funds are available to close 
crippled S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be no delay unless the Administration wants a delay," said Rep. 
Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento). Congress, he said, will present a bill "in a 
timely fashion." 
</P>
<P>
Ways and Means has a hand in the legislation because the bill contains tax 
provisions. The main panel moving the bill is the House Banking Committee, 
which has already voted in favor of the Bush financing method. 
</P>
<P>
When the bill goes to the House floor, the members could select the Banking 
Committee version or accept the Ways and Means method adopted Wednesday. Once 
the full House acts, its bill must be reconciled with the Senate version in a 
compromise product. 
</P>
<P>
The bailout legislation, estimated to cost $157 billion over 10 years 
(including direct outlays and interest charges), is needed to make good the 
promises of the federal insurance fund for deposits. Because the fund is broke, 
there is no money to close crippled institutions and pay off their depositors.

NOBLE BROADCAST'S BID TO BUY RADIO NETWORKS FALTERS;

Noble Broadcast Group's $200-million bid for two radio networks, a deal that 
would have put the San Diego-based radio chain in the front rank in number of 
U. S. listeners, has been turned down, Noble chairman John Lynch said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego-based Noble said the offer for New York-based United Stations and 
Colorado Springs-based Transtar is still on the table and he is optimistic that 
his company and the networks will come to an agreement "down the road." The 
deal has been in negotiations for three months and has been followed widely in 
the broadcast industry. 
</P>
<P>
United Stations President Nick Verbitsky acknowledged the offer Wednesday, 
saying only that "we talk to a lot of people, and we get offers all the time." 
Verbitsky, who with Dick Clark is a principal shareholder of United, said "your 
guess is as good as mine" when asked the chances of striking a deal with Noble. 
</P>
<P>
Fast-growing Noble owns 18 radio stations, including XTRA-FM and AM in San 
Diego, up from two stations four years ago. To raise equity capital for the 
purchase of the networks, Nobel last month sold two Boston stations, WSSH-AM 
and FM, to a group led by entertainer Merv Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch said Noble's long-term goal is to own a major radio network in order to 
better exercise control over Noble's "inventory," or programming, and Noble 
will continue to look for suitable network acquisitions. Noble also plans to 
acquire more stations over the next year or two to reach the maximum 24 
stations allowed by the Federal Communications Commission, Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
31 Weekly Programs 
</P>
<P>
Closely held United Stations bought the RKO radio network in April 1985 and 
also owns a programming production company, Verbitsky said. The network 
produces about 31 weekly programs, including Dick Clark's weekly Top 40 
countdown show, that are sold to 1,200 affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
Transtar sells eight 24-hour radio formats, ranging from Top 40 and Golden 
Oldies to country-western and big band, which are fed to 1,400 affiliate 
stations via satellite. Transtar also produces a rock-'n'-roll countdown show 
featuring comedian John Candy and owns a radio market-research firm. 
</P>
<P>
Transtar principals C. T. Robinson and Bill Moyes were unavailable for comment 
Wednesday.

COSMETICS GIANT EXPECTED TO REJECT BID; 
</P>
<P>
AMWAY OFFERS TO BUY AVON FOR $2.1 BILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amway Corp. on Wednesday offered to buy Avon Products, the 103-year-old giant 
cosmetics firm, for $2.1 billion in cash. 
</P>
<P>
The deal would unite two companies that made their mark in business by selling 
door-to-door. Amway now also sells its household products by mail order, while 
Avon, long known for its "Avon Lady" direct sales force, is offering such 
fragrances as its Giorgio Beverly Hills and Parfums Stern lines through 
department stores. 
</P>
<P>
Amway's bid came one week after the Ada, Mich., company and Minneapolis 
investor Irwin L. Jacobs disclosed that they had acquired 10.3% of New 
York-based Avon's stock and might make a bid for the concern. On Wednesday, 
however, Amway announced the buyout offer on its own and did not indicate 
whether Jacobs would participate in the proposed deal. 
</P>
<P>
Avon Chairman James E. Preston last week rebuffed the initial overture, saying 
the company was not for sale. He reaffirmed that stance in a letter to Amway 
Wednesday responding to the takeover bid, but said Avon's board will meet its 
legal obligations to its shareholders by reviewing the buyout proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts predicted that Avon will reject the offer, at least 
initially, but added that the company has few defenses against a possible 
hostile takeover bid. Avon does not have enough cash to keep its stock out of 
Amway's control by buying large amounts of its own shares, said Bonita Austin, 
an analyst at the investment firm Wertheim Schroder. 
</P>
<P>
Austin said Avon, saddled with about $1.1 billion in long-term debt, lacks the 
cash to engineer a management buyout or to buy back much of its stock. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, Austin said, she believes that Avon "will just try to get a higher 
bid from Amway. "Avon doesn't have a lot of options." 
</P>
<P>
Prospects for finding a "white knight" to acquire Avon are not very promising, 
Austin said. Ronald O. Perelman, a takeover artist who is Revlon Group's chief 
executive, might be interested, but there are no other serious prospective 
buyers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Avon's stock climbed $3.875 a share to close at $39.875 Wednesday on 
the New York Stock Exchange, apparently indicating that some investors believe 
that a bid higher than Amway's current $39-per-share offer will emerge. 
</P>
<P>
Avon may rely on an existing defense, a provision that gives its shareholders 
the right to buy the company's stock at half price should another party 
accumulate more than 20% of the shares. Anticipating that a raider might 
challenge the legality of that provision, Avon on Monday asked a New York state 
court to declare that provision valid. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot depends on the shareholders rights provision," said Eileen Gormley, an 
analyst at Thomson McKinnon Securities. "Avon may have to depend on that 
provision if it wants to remain independent." 
</P>
<P>
Gormley and other analysts said the $39-a-share offer was a fair price. 
However, a suitor may have to offer $42 or $43 a share to get Avon's board to 
endorse an acquisition, she said. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Amway might have difficulty getting financiers to provide 
funding for any deal involving more than $41 a share, said Andrew Shore, an 
analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton. Shore, who expects Avon to eventually accept 
an Amway offer, said Avon stock would be selling in the $20-to-$25 range if not 
for the speculation over the takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
Shore, noting that Avon had a 1988 loss of $404.5 million, said the cosmetic 
company's directors were already under some pressure from shareholders and thus 
are not likely to use a "poison pill" takeover defense. 
</P>
<P>
"After disappointing earnings, they don't want to engage in a slash and burn 
policy of doing something to weaken the company to discourage Amway," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Amway referred to the possibility of a poison pill in its buyout proposal. 
Amway said it "reserves the right to reduce the per-share price of its offer" 
if Avon redeems the stock or takes any other action to reduce the value of the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
"After careful consideration," the proposal said, "we have concluded that our 
respective businesses are complementary and that a business combination would 
generate substantial benefits for both companies, their respective distributor 
organizations and their respective shareholders . . . . Our offer is, of 
course, subject to negotiation." 
</P>
<P>
Noting the conditions for the offer, Avon spokesman John Cox said the proposal 
"is not a firm offer -- it's conditional." Cox said Avon's board would meet 
soon to consider the offer. 
</P>
<P>
Amway today is expected to file a document with Securities and Exchange 
Commission providing some details on how it would operate Avon. 
</P>
<P>
Avon's 1.4-million-member independent sales force sells cosmetics, fragrances 
and small gift items for the home. The company had 1988 sales of $3.06 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Amway's product list includes toiletries, cosmetics, soaps and home-care, 
health and fitness goods.

SEC ALTERS RULES ON ARBITRATION SYSTEM; 
</P>
<P>
CHANGES INTENDED TO ENSURE FAIRNESS IN SETTLING INVESTOR DISPUTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday approved rule changes 
designed to make the securities industry's arbitration system more fair to 
disgruntled customers. 
</P>
<P>
By a 5-0 vote, the commission authorized a series of changes, spurred by 
complaints from unhappy investors who discovered after the October, 1987, stock 
crash that they had signed away their right to sue their brokers. 
</P>
<P>
Many firms, in the fine print in paper work required to open an account, 
require customers to agree in advance to settle any disputes through 
industry-administered arbitration proceedings, rather than through the courts. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC, under the new rule effective in 120 days, will require firms to 
highlight and fully explain arbitration clauses so investors know what they're 
signing. 
</P>
<P>
Arbitration, because it is cheaper and faster than suing in court, is a good 
deal for many investors, particularly those with small claims. But there is 
only a limited right of appeal and some investors may be better off in court. 
</P>
<P>
The commission decided against an outright ban of the clauses. Some members 
were reluctant to dictate the terms of contracts entered into by private 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
Also, brokerage firm executives had argued that banning the clauses could 
destroy the arbitration system and push more cases onto the nation's already 
crowded court dockets. 
</P>
<P>
In explaining the commission's decision not to ban the clauses, SEC Chairman 
David S. Ruder said enough firms offer cash accounts without arbitration 
clauses that investors still have access to the market even if they want to 
keep their right to go to court. However, he warned that the SEC will be 
checking to see if more firms start using arbitration clauses. 
</P>
<P>
The rules governing arbitration have become increasingly critical after a 
Supreme Court decision in 1987 that upheld the validity of arbitration clauses. 
Also, the number of arbitration cases has mushroomed from 830 in 1980 to 6,101 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC, in adopting the changes, acted on proposals from the New York Stock 
Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and the National Assn. of Securities 
Dealers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they will make the arbitration process better . . . and clear up some 
of the perception problems that have nagged the system," said commission member 
Charles Cox. 
</P>
<P>
Another important change requires the exchanges to keep track of the amounts of 
arbitration awards, the amounts originally sought, the issues in dispute and 
the brokers and firms involved. 
</P>
<P>
"We now for the first time really will be in a position to effectively monitor 
the arbitration process," Commissioner Mary Schapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
Other changes are aimed at ensuring that the "public" members of arbitration 
panels do not have ties to the securities industry, that arbitrators disclose 
any ties that may affect their decisions and that arbitrators get more power to 
compel brokers and plaintiffs to turn over relevant documents in a timely 
manner.

JEFFERIES SAYS HE HID STOCK FOR BILZERIAN; 
</P>
<P>
SINGER CO. CHIEF ACCUSED OF ILLEGAL TAKEOVER MOVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Former brokerage executive Boyd Jefferies said Wednesday that he illegally 
accumulated stock for corporate raider Paul Bilzerian, who wanted to conceal 
his stakes in various takeover targets. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies, looking tanned and fit, testified at the trial of the 38-year-old 
Singer Co. chairman, who is charged with 11 counts of securities and tax fraud, 
conspiracy and making false statements to the government. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Bilzerian, a Tampa, Fla., investor, faces a maximum sentence of 
55 years in prison and nearly $2.8 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government charges that Bilzerian made millions of dollars through 
illegal acts tied to corporate takeovers in 1985 and 1986. He is charged with 
secretly accumulating stock in takeover targets Cluett, Peabody &amp; Co. and 
Hammermill Paper Co. through the Los Angeles brokerage firm Jefferies &amp; 
Co., which was once headed by Jefferies, and later selling his shares at a 
handsome profit. 
</P>
<P>
Bilzerian is also charged with tax fraud for allegedly hiding shares of H. H. 
Robertson Co. and Armco Inc. through secret accounts at Jefferies &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies, a key government witness who has himself pleaded guilty to 
securities fraud charges, told the court Wednesday that his firm hid the shares 
for Bilzerian. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't really make any money. These transactions were really just customer 
accommodation, to do a favor for a client," Jefferies said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bilzerian trial is the second to grow out of information provided by 
Jefferies. The first was the stock manipulation case against GAF Corp. and its 
vice chairman, James Sherwin. The GAF case, after two mistrials, has been reset 
for Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Bilzerian's case is the second to be linked to former stock speculator Ivan F. 
Boesky and the first against a corporate raider since the illegal insider 
trading affair became public in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies, who was implicated by Boesky, pleaded guilty to two securities fraud 
felonies in 1987 and has cooperated with the government. GAF defense lawyers 
attacked Jefferies' credibility in court, implying that he lied about GAF and 
Sherwin to get a more lenient sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Mathews, Bilzerian's lawyer, tried the same strategy Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Under Mathews' questioning, Jefferies said he told prosecutors about other 
securities crimes, but the government agreed not to prosecute him for those if 
he cooperated. In addition, neither Jefferies &amp; Co. nor its employees would 
be charged. 
</P>
<P>
Mathews asked Jefferies about his current net worth. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm unemployed," Jefferies said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sought 'Special Situations' 
</P>
<P>
"You didn't go out penniless," Mathews said, asking Jefferies if his net worth 
at the time of his plea was $30 million to $40 million." 
</P>
<P>
"That's approximate," said Jefferies, who now lives at a country club in Indian 
Wells, near Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies said that when he first met Bilzerian, the Florida investor said he 
had made his money in Florida real estate but did not like the market and had 
liquidated his holdings. 
</P>
<P>
"He said now he had $20 million he was investing in the stock market and was 
looking for special situations in the stock market," Jefferies said. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies said he told Bilzerian he was looking forward to a "long and 
profitable relationship" with him. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying about the Cluett Peabody deal, Jefferies said that Michael Landry, 
the principal account executive who dealt with Bilzerian, "asked if we could 
buy Cluett Peabody for Paul Bilzerian, hold it and sell it later." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accommodation Account 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies said shares were held in the firm's customer accommodation account. 
"It's an account we use to do favors for customers," Jefferies said. 
</P>
<P>
The government has charged that Bilzerian acquired control of 24% of Cluett 
Peabody, made a tender offer for the rest of the company and then sold his 
stock to "white knight" West Point-Pepperell Inc. for a $7-million profit. 
</P>
<P>
As for Hammermill, Jefferies said Bilzerian had a 4.9% stake in the company in 
1986 and did not want to notify the group that he was buying its shares. The 
Securities and Exchange Commission requires investors to make a public filing 
when they obtain 5% of a company. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies said he bought 400,000 to 500,000 shares of Hammerhill for Bilzerian. 
</P>
<P>
"The arrangement was that I would buy the stock for Jefferies &amp; Co.'s firm 
inventory and would sell it back to Paul," he told the court.

Princeton/Newport Partners: Five indicted former officials of the 
Princeton/Newport Limited Partners investment firm received encouraging news 
when a federal judge dismissed three mail and wire fraud counts in a criminal 
indictment pending against them in New York. The counts related to charges that 
the Princeton/Newport officials had illegally agreed to hide the ownership of 
blocks of Mattel stock. The judge threw out the counts, saying the government 
hadn't shown that the Mattel transactions had caused anyone to lose money or 
property. Dismissal of the counts leaves 65 counts pending. But a defense 
lawyer claimed that the dismissal also wipes out a big portion of the pending 
racketeering charge against the group.

U.S. SEEKS $24 MILLION FROM 2 FIRMS IN FAILURE OF S&amp;L 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal regulators are seeking $24 million in damages from the investment firm 
of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. and from a now defunct Riverside County firm in 
connection with the May, 1986, failure of a San Diego County savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Savings &amp; Loan Insurance Corp., which insures the nation's 
thrifts, said in a lawsuit that Kidder Peabody and the Riverside County 
investment adviser failed to properly perform their responsibilities when they 
allowed Carlsbad-based Seapointe Savings &amp; Loan Assn. to enter risky 
securities, futures and commodity options deals. 
</P>
<P>
Officers of Strategic Investment Services (SIS), the now-defunct investment 
adviser based in Riverside County, "made representations and omissions to 
further their own interests without regard to the interest of Seapointe 
Savings," according to a prepared statement released by FSLIC spokeswoman 
Andrea Plater. "Kidder Peabody allegedly aided and abetted SIS by failing to 
warn Seapointe of SIS's fraudulent acts and practices and losses caused them." 
</P>
<P>
Although some financial institutions maintain futures and options portfolios to 
hedge against interest rate changes, the FSLIC complaint described Seapointe's 
futures and options trading portfolio as "risky speculation." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Kidder Peabody and SIS, the FSLIC suit named Robert Peacock, an 
account manager at Kidder Peabody; Dirk Rose, president of SIS, and Robert 
Forrest, a director of SIS. There was no spokesman available on Wednesday for 
the now-defunct SIS firm. 
</P>
<P>
Kidder Peabody spokeswoman Maureen Bailey denied any wrongdoing by the New 
York-based investment firm, suggesting that the FSLIC's claim was "based on a 
misunderstanding of the facts and an attempt to extend the liability of 
brokerage firms far beyond anything supported by existing law." 
</P>
<P>
Although Kidder Peabody conducted trades for Seapointe, the Carlsbad-based 
S&amp;L "had an independent trading adviser (SIS) who was responsible for all 
of its transactions," Bailey said. "Seapointe did not rely upon us to recommend 
trades nor did it share with us the information we would have needed to make 
recommendations." 
</P>
<P>
Bailey said that shortly before the losses occurred, Kidder Peabody warned 
Seapointe's board that its futures trading position had increased in "size and 
risk." Kidder Peabody at that time "turned (Seapointe's) business away," 
according to Bailey. The S&amp;L's losses occurred "only after (it) stopped 
doing business with Kidder Peabody," Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
Seapointe, which opened its doors on April 17, 1985, generated at least $24 
million in losses by the time federal regulators closed it on May 30, 1986. 
Most of those losses were generated by highly speculative financial options 
trades during a two-week period in February, 1986, state banking regulators 
said in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators seized the insolvent thrift in May, 1986, and sold its 
insured deposits to Monterey Savings Bank of Monterey Park for $42,000. 
</P>
<P>
Seapointe began "as a very traditional community-based S&amp;L," according to 
one banking industry observer in San Diego. "But they started to take deposits 
and buy immense positions on margin through Kidder or whomever, expecting that 
swings in the market would make them rich." 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of deception going on," according to Ernest Dronenburg Jr., a 
former Seapointe director who also serves as vice chairman of the State Board 
of Equalization. Prior to Seapointe's failure, its board had intended to sue 
SIS and Kidder Peabody for the risky trading practices, Dronenburg said 
Wednesday. However, "we were preempted" when federal regulators seized the 
institution, Dronenburg said.

JUDGE RULES CONTINENTAL CAN SCHEMED TO DENY PENSIONS 
</P>

<P>
Continental Can Co. developed a secret and sophisticated computer program used 
nationwide to deny longtime employees pension benefits, a federal judge ruled 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In a sharply worded opinion against the company, U.S. District Judge H. Lee 
Sarokin directed Continental Can to begin negotiating settlements with about 
2,500 Continental workers. Costs to the company could approach $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The plan was shrouded in secrecy and executed companywide at the specific 
direction of the highest levels of corporate management," Sarokin said in a 
written opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"It was intended to save hundreds of millions of dollars in unfunded pension 
liabilities," he wrote. "The evidence of the plan, its secrecy and its 
execution comes from the files of the defendants themselves. The documents are 
more than a smoking gun; they are a fusillade." 
</P>
<P>
Continental Can has a plant in Wayne, N.J., and 45 others nationwide. The 
company is based in Norwalk, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Several cases have been brought against Continental by aggrieved employees, 
including one in Sarokin's court, but he said in his ruling that there was no 
need for all to be heard. 
</P>
<P>
"What the judge has said is that this should end all the cases everywhere," 
said Robert Plotkin, an attorney for the workers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a case of a class-action suit where plaintiffs each have a claim 
to $10," he continued. "What we're talking here is, you have many former 
employees who have individual claims worth in excess of $100,000." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Douglas G. Eakeley of Chicago, who represented Continental Can, did 
not immediately return a reporter's calls. The pensions in question were 
negotiated in 1977 by the United Steelworkers for employees subject to periodic 
layoffs. They were designed to protect employees with long years of service who 
had not yet reached normal retirement age. 
</P>
<P>
But attorneys for the workers have maintained, and the judge agreed, that 
Continental management adopted a secret computerized plan to prevent employees 
from vesting in the costly pensions by laying them off before they became 
eligible. 
</P>
<P>
A federal pension law, called the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, 
prohibits employers from taking any action against workers for the purpose of 
interfering with their pensions. 
</P>
<P>
"For a corporation of this magnitude to engage in a complex, secret and 
deliberate scheme to deny its workers bargained-for pension benefits raises 
questions of corporate morality, ethics and decency which far transcend the 
factual and legal issues posed by this matter," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
Plotkin said that Sarokin's ruling should convince the company to stop dragging 
the suit on but that he wasn't counting on it. 
</P>
<P>
"Continental's continued efforts to avoid its obligations to those employees 
any way it can are deplorable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Company attorneys had argued that there was no secret plan in place, and that 
even if there were, the employees would have been laid off anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Sarokin rejected that argument. He appointed George L. Priest, a professor at 
Yale Law School, to assist the two sides in settling individual claims, and he 
ordered the money to be paid promptly.

EX-'TODAY' PRODUCER QUITS TINKER'S FIRM

Steve Friedman, the brash "Today" show producer whom Grant Tinker lured from 
NBC in 1987 to create the TV version of the USA Today newspaper, said Wednesday 
he's quitting Tinker's company on May 29. 
</P>
<P>
While the announcement was a surprise -- Friedman's contract runs through 
September, 1990 -- both he and Tinker, the former chairman of NBC, emphasized 
in interviews that the parting is amicable. They said it was prompted by the 
desire of Friedman, 42, to produce shows, but not to have to sell them to 
sponsors and networks. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman has been president of GTG East, the New York branch of the Culver 
City-based GTG Entertainment production company that Tinker founded with media 
giant Gannett Co. after leaving NBC. Tinker said no decision has been made on 
Friedman's successor. 
</P>
<P>
Responsible at GTG for creating what are known in the TV industry as 
"reality-based" programs, Friedman was the first executive producer of what now 
is "USA Today on TV." The show was critically drubbed when it premiered last 
September after $40 million in start-up costs. 
</P>
<P>
The syndicated series has been revamped several times and is on its third 
executive producer. It has been renewed for a second season. 
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation that Friedman might return to NBC, where for seven 
years he was executive producer of the "Today" show and engineered its rise 
from second to first in the network morning-show ratings. But he said he has 
had no talks with officials of NBC or any other network and has no immediate 
plans. JAY SHARBUTT

DOWNEY VOTES INITIAL OK ON ANTI-SMOKING LAW

The City Council Tuesday voted preliminary approval for an ordinance 
prohibiting smoking in most public places and requiring no-smoking sections in 
restaurants with seating for 20 or more patrons. 
</P>
<P>
If the proposed ordinance is given final approval on May 23, smoking would be 
prohibited at retail stores, medical facilities and child-care operations 30 
days after passage. 
</P>
<P>
Smoking would not be allowed in enclosed areas such as elevators, hallways and 
restrooms. It would be restricted to designated areas in the workplace, 
restaurants and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Smoking would be allowed in bars, malls, retail tobacco stores, private 
assembly rooms and in designated areas in places of work where smokers are in 
the majority. Certain sections of lobbies in theaters and auditoriums also 
would be designated for smokers. 
</P>
<P>
According to the measure, employers would be urged to make "reasonable efforts" 
to provide a smoke-free area, but they would not be required to erect barriers 
for nonsmokers. The rights of nonsmokers would be given precedence in disputes 
between nonsmokers and smokers. Signs indicating smoking and nonsmoking areas 
would be required in business establishments. 
</P>
<P>
Revisions and amendments are expected to be offered at a public hearing before 
the ordinance is given its final reading on May 23. 
</P>
<P>
The council gave tentative approval to the measure by a vote of 4 to 1 with 
Barbara Hayden voting no. She said the proposed law was "too wordy." 
</P>
<P>
The council considered the proposal after receiving phone calls, letters and 
other responses that favored a smoking ordinance by a margin of 2 to 1, 
according to a report presented to the council by June Yotsuya, assistant to 
the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Roy Paul said he was concerned about the effect the ordinance would 
have on small businesses. He said it showed signs of a "big brother" mentality. 
"I see this as just another infringement," he said, calling the ordinance 
confusing. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Robert G. Cormack said that the smoking regulation is necessary because 
76% of the people are nonsmokers. "The only laws we should have are those that 
protect the health and welfare of the people," Cormack said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Diane Boggs called the proposal fair. She said it would be 
irresponsible to ignore the statistical data on smoking. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Kenneth Wayne, a pulmonologist at Gallatin Medical Clinic in Downey, was 
instrumental in bringing the proposal for a smoking law to the council more 
than a year ago. Wayne said the ordinance should have been stronger. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't as tough as I would like, but it is certainly a first step," Wayne 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced of the hazards of active and passive smoke. . . . Nonsmokers 
shouldn't be forced to breath second-hand smoke," he said. He favors barriers 
to restrict smoke moving from room to room. 
</P>
<P>
The effects of second-hand smoke became a national concerned when U.S. Surgeon 
General C. Everett Koop issued a formal warning in 1986 on its danger to 
nonsmokers. The report stated that healthy nonsmokers have an increased risk of 
getting lung cancer and other respiratory diseases by breathing smoke-filled 
air. 
</P>
<P>
There are nearly 400 communities nationwide that have placed restrictions on 
smoking, according to Mark Pertschuk, director of Americans for Nonsmokers' 
Rights, headquartered in Berkeley. Pertschuk said he was aware of the Downey 
ordinance and said it was mild. 
</P>
<P>
If the proposal becomes law, Downey will join 169 other California communities 
with smoking ordinances.

RENAMING OF BLVD. STIRS IRE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE STREET

When Lynwood city officials renamed Century Boulevard in honor of Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr. last month, they forgot to tell South Gate. And South Gate had 
a stake in the decision because one side of a nine-block stretch of the 
boulevard is in that city. 
</P>
<P>
The name was changed along a 3 1/2-mile segment of Century Boulevard in 
northern Lynwood. South Gate merchants and residents, however, are concerned 
about the boulevard where for nine blocks it is in Lynwood on one side and 
South Gate on the other. 
</P>
<P>
South Gate City Atty. Bruce Boogaard said if the two sides cannot agree, one 
side of the street could be named Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard while the 
other side could remain Century Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
That is exactly what could happen, Lynwood Councilman Paul Richards said. "If 
they don't want the change, South Gate will have Century and Lynwood, Martin 
Luther King." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lynwood's Right Challenged 
</P>
<P>
South Gate officials question the right of Lynwood to change the name of that 
segment of the boulevard without telling them. 
</P>
<P>
"Lynwood doesn't have the right to change the name of streets in our city," 
Councilman William H. DeWitt said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a Martin Luther King Jr. Hospital. There's a Martin Luther King 
Boulevard in Los Angeles. We don't need another," said South Gate resident 
Maria Morales. 
</P>
<P>
The executive director of the South Gate Chamber of Commerce, Russell Lamkin, 
said: "It is stupid. All this will cost merchants a lot of money to print new 
letterheads and stationery." 
</P>
<P>
Merchant Cirilo E. Poots said he moved to 3077 Century Blvd. in South Gate 
about five months ago and believes a name change would disrupt his business. 
</P>
<P>
Poots, who owns Cirilo's Customs Tailor, said customers who frequented his 
previous location in Huntington Park are just beginning to come to his new 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'This Is Not Good' 
</P>
<P>
"I had to leave my Huntington Park shop because the city bought it as part of a 
redevelopment area," Poots said. "Now, they want to change the name. This is 
not good." 
</P>
<P>
Although Lynwood officials have apologized and asked that representatives from 
both cities get together and talk over the problem, neither side seems willing 
to change its position. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope they would change," Lynwood Mayor Evelyn Wells said. "It is up to 
them and their people. Hopefully, they will come along with us." 
</P>
<P>
But South Gate Councilman Gregory Slaughter said: "Everyone (in South Gate) is 
opposed to this change." 
</P>
<P>
During a council meeting Monday, Slaughter voted against meeting with Lynwood 
officials to discuss the problem. The other four South Gate council members 
voted to hold talks, but with some misgivings. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm opposed to changing Century Boulevard to anything," South Gate Councilman 
Robert Philipp said. "I don't see the benefit to South Gate or Lynwood." 
</P>
<P>
South Gate Mayor Herb Cranton said he would arrange a meeting with Mayor Wells 
to see whether a compromise can be worked out. Cranton also asked the city's 
administrative staff to poll merchants and residents in the nine-block area to 
see how they feel about the change. Philipp said he supports a survey but 
believes most people oppose the change. 
</P>
<P>
Unofficially, DeWitt said he counted 24 businesses and 40 homes in the area. 
DeWitt said he also believes most people in the poll area would be opposed to 
the change. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Law Allows It 
</P>
<P>
According to Boogaard, state law allows a city to change the name of a street 
within its boundaries. But Boogaard said there is no law requiring cities to 
"meet and confer" on a name change of a street located within the borders of 
each. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically, cities meet (to decide on name changes) as a matter of courtesy 
to residents who border the street," he said. 
</P>
<P>
South Gate Councilman DeWitt is concerned about giving the nine-block segment 
of the boulevard two names. "That would be confusing, especially during 
emergencies where ambulance drivers or police would be trying to find an 
address," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Joseph Wang, Lynwood public works director, said new street signs 
have been put up at some of the major intersections in Lynwood. Wang said it 
will take about two months to complete the task. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is prepared to change the signs in South Gate, too, if that city 
agrees to the name change. Signs on Century Boulevard between Alameda Street on 
the west and Long Beach Freeway on the east are being changed to Martin Luther 
King Jr. Boulevard. The portion in South Gate is on the north side of the 
boulevard between Santa Fe Avenue and Long Beach Boulevard.

VENTURA GROWTH ISSUE DIVISIVE AT TOP LEVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The continuing debate over the city of Ventura's future reached the Planning 
Commission this week, splitting members over the same issues of growth and 
development that have divided the community at large. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Comprehensive Plan, a document nearly three years in the making, 
was discussed for four hours Tuesday night without producing any consensus over 
just how big Ventura should be 20 years from now. 
</P>
<P>
The seven-member commission is faced with four possible scenarios that envision 
the city adding from between 2,000 to 56,000 residents by the year 2010. Debate 
has focused on two less extreme alternatives, which predict the city's growing 
from about 92,000 to either 102,000 or 122,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the six commissioners in attendance found themselves split over those 
numbers, with some wanting to increase the population to stimulate economic 
activity and others warning that such increases could have disastrous 
consequences for the quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Gary Nasalroad, hoping to strike a balance, suggested that the 
board plan for a population of 122,000 because the community would probably 
grow that large whether anyone liked it or not. 
</P>
<P>
"We may be looking at a larger population than maybe you even want," he told 
the other commissioners. "But it's a good thing to plan toward. . . . There's a 
certain inevitability to growth." 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Clark Owens agreed. "If we're too restrictive, we're going to 
weaken our economic base," he said. "We would wind up doing ourselves and our 
community a disservice." 
</P>
<P>
But Commissioner Todd Collart argued that such an increase in population could 
spell trouble for the city's water supply, air quality and traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"My view of it is that 122,000 is not a healthy number," he said. "I think 
we're better off going to a lower number that we know we can live with." 
</P>
<P>
An informal vote ended in a 3-3 tie, with Chairman Gary Pihlaja absent. After 
more discussion, Commissioner Marilynn Viles, who had opposed the 122,000 
figure, reversed her vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to vote for it on the reasoning that I can change my mind at the 
end," she said, "so we can get on with this." 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission is meeting again tonight at 7 to continue reviewing the 
document. The City Council is expected to study it later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The meetings are among the final chapters of a lengthy process begun in July, 
1986, when a committee of 14 citizens was appointed by the council to revise 
the existing Comprehensive Plan, a blueprint for growth that was last adopted 
in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting 40 to 50 times over 16 months, the committee recommended in 
October, 1987, that the city be allowed to grow to 122,000 by 2010 -- a rate 
just a bit below the current pace of development. 
</P>
<P>
An environmental impact report completed earlier this year by Ventura-based 
McClelland Engineers, however, favored a 102,000-resident alternative as 
providing for more "logical and planned growth . . . and to conserve the city's 
remaining natural resources." 
</P>
<P>
Public hearings April 18 and April 26 reflected the sharp division in the 
community over the growth scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
More conservative guidelines seemed to be favored by environmentalists, 
longtime residents and anyone else who came to Ventura to escape the congestion 
of the San Fernando Valley or Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Skyrocketing Prices 
</P>
<P>
Fewer restrictions on growth were advocated by developers, business interests 
and anyone else hoping that increased construction might help curb the city's 
skyrocketing housing prices. 
</P>
<P>
If, as city officials predict, the plan ultimately calls for between 102,000 
and 122,000 residents by 2010, it will still keep growth in Ventura at a rate 
about half that of the county. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last five years, Ventura has grown an average of 1.6% annually, or 
about 1,400 people a year. In the same time, Ventura County has grown an 
average of 2.5% annually, or about 15,380 people a year. 
</P>
<P>
Under a scenario of 122,000 people, the city could increase by only 1,000 
people a year. If the number is lowered to 102,000, the increase would be cut 
to 500 people a year. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 1,431 births and 711 deaths were recorded in Ventura, for a net 
increase of 720 people. 
</P>
<P>
City planners say they do not consider birth and death rates when making 
population estimates because they cannot predict how many of those new 
residents will remain in Ventura.

DISPUTE SWIRLS AROUND VACANT MEDICAL CLINIC IN TEST OF LONG BEACH'S RESOLVE TO

<TEXT>
<P>
Like a monument to the elegance of a former age, the Harriman Jones Medical 
Group building stands unobtrusively at the corner of Broadway and Cherry 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The shades on its front windows are pulled down. A paper sign announcing that 
the clinic has moved hangs over the building's directory, blocking the names of 
the physicians still listed there. And behind the locked front door, the 
spacious wood-beamed living-room-like waiting area -- complete with a piano and 
burning fireplace -- still holds the memories of thousands of area fathers who 
waited nervously in it for word of newborn babies. 
</P>
<P>
Far from being a relic of the past, however, the building may be a symbol of 
the future. For around it swirls a controversy which is testing he city's newly 
articulated resolve to preserve its cultural heritage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Historic Buildings Razed 
</P>
<P>
Recent years have seen several major defeats on that front. Despite public 
outcries, during 1988 the city's historic Jergins Trust Building was razed 
almost simultaneously with the Pacific Coast Club. Both buildings were the 
subjects of long and heated debates between preservationists and developers. 
</P>
<P>
One result was the appointment earlier this year of the city's first historic 
preservation officer, Ruthann Lehrer. Now along comes the old Harriman Jones 
clinic, the first major preservation controversy to erupt since Lehrer took 
office in February. The manner in which she handles it, both sides agree, will 
say much about whether and how her newly created post can function effectively. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a test to see whether or not we can all work together to resolve 
conflicts and agree to compromise," Lehrer said. "The loss of the Pacific Coast 
Club and Jergins Trust Building was disastrous, and people in this community 
still grieve over those losses. My job is to say that we're not going to do 
that anymore -- to develop a different approach in this city so that we don't 
have the (Pacific Coast Club) coming down again and again." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the protagonists say, Lehrer's involvement already has done much to 
create a new mood of negotiation between preservationists and would-be 
developers, which has resulted in optimism on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
The current controversy evolved from the actions of Rae La Force, a 60-year 
Long Beach resident who has lived within nine blocks of the Harriman Jones 
building since 1955. Like many of her neighbors, La Force frequented the clinic 
pharmacy for years and spent many an afternoon hobnobbing at the pharmacy's 
old-fashioned soda fountain that once served as a popular neighborhood 
gathering spot. 
</P>
<P>
During a visit last summer, however, she learned that the building was about to 
be sold. Alarmed at the potential implications of the move, La Force began 
researching the structure's past. What she discovered ultimately persuaded the 
city's Cultural Heritage Commission to recommend the site for landmark status. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trust Fund Begun 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1930, the clinic -- which initially also served as a hospital -- was 
the brainchild of Dr. Harriman Jones, who came to Long Beach in 1901 as one of 
the town's first doctors and eventually became its first public health officer. 
In that capacity, he is credited with establishing the city's first sewer and 
garbage disposal systems, as well as writing its first public health 
regulations. He also founded the city's first hospital in a small house on 
Daisy Avenue in 1902, and helped organize the medical institutions that 
eventually became St. Mary Medical Center and Memorial Medical Center of Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic bearing his name was innovative for its time, combining various 
medical services under one roof and establishing a trust fund by which medical 
services were provided to the needy. Many believe it signified the coming of 
modern and progressive medical health services to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Architecturally, the building is interesting as well, constituting the first 
major work of Kenneth Wing, a once-prominent local architect whose other works 
include the Long Beach Arena, Southern California Edison Co. building, Long 
Beach Community Hospital and Signal Hill City Hall. Patterned in the style of 
an Italian villa, the two-story Harriman Jones building is entered through a 
portico featuring stone benches and a tile mosaic. It once included a series of 
interior courtyards. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a beautiful piece of Mediterranean architecture that you won't see built 
again," said Charles Paap, son of the legendary Dr. George Paap who, as 
reigning obstetrician-gynecologist at the clinic from 1931 until his death in 
the early 1970s, delivered an estimated 3,000 babies, including some of the 
city's most prominent citizens. "It has a historical place in the city of Long 
Beach." 
</P>
<P>
After operating at the site for more than 50 years, the Harriman Jones Medical 
Group began expanding into other facilities in the early 1980s. The process was 
completed early last month when the company finally vacated four scattered 
satellite buildings, including the one at 211 Cherry Ave., and consolidated its 
services in a new building on Willow Street at Redondo Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Condo Units Planned 
</P>
<P>
Since late last year, the old Cherry Avenue clinic has been in escrow with a 
group of Newport Beach developers whose original intention was to replace the 
entire building with condominium units priced in the 
$200,000-to-$300,000-range, as well as 21,000 square feet of retail space 
fronting Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
The Cultural Heritage Commission's recommendation for landmark status was 
endorsed by the Planning Commission, putting that project on hold. A 
designation of landmark status by the City Council, while not preventing 
ultimate destruction of the building, could delay any action for up to a year 
while alternatives are being explored. 
</P>
<P>
Initial reactions were heated. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Terry/Nikols Development Co. said they had tried in vain 
to find a new tenant for the building willing to use it in its current 
condition. Their efforts were thwarted, said co-owner Don Nikols, by the lack 
of parking. And a spokesman for Harriman Jones Medical Group complained that 
the delay in escrow, which was originally scheduled to close on Feb. 9, is 
costing his company $38,000 a month in maintenance fees and mortgage payments. 
"It's a problem for us if it's an all-or-nothing situation," said Bob Nelson, 
the group's administrative director. 
</P>
<P>
Historic preservation officer Lehrer is trying to make it something other than 
an all-or-nothing situation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Delayed by City Council 
</P>
<P>
In a move she supported, the City Council last month delayed until May 23 any 
action on the request for landmark status. And in the interim, representatives 
of preservationist organizations, community groups, the developers and the 
owners are meeting regularly under Lehrer's guidance to work out a compromise 
they all can live with. 
</P>
<P>
On the negotiating table, Lehrer said, is a plan by which the developers would 
proceed with their condominiums but revise their design to preserve the 
building's entire Cherry Avenue side, including the portico, as well as an 
interior reception area, stairway and upstairs library. 
</P>
<P>
According to Nikols, who supports it, the change would cost his company about 
$1 million in added construction charges and lost income from the sale of the 
higher-priced condominium units it would eliminate. 
</P>
<P>
"The realities are that if I don't make a compromise now I may have no 
business," Nikols said. "And if the preservationists don't compromise, there is 
a likelihood that after (landmark status) holds up any action, the building 
will be demolished." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wait-and-See Stance 
</P>
<P>
Still uncertain is the fate of the living-room waiting area that 
preservationists say they want to save, but which Nikols says can't be 
preserved without eliminating valuable parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
While both sides say they are maintaining a wait-and-see attitude on the 
negotiations, they also say they are optimistic about the ultimate outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to open up new vistas to the developer," said Doug Otto, 
president of the private Coalition to Preserve Historic Long Beach, which 
recently organized a neighborhood rally to draw attention to the building's 
plight. "Things are moving relatively quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Said Lehrer: "There's a real spirit of cooperation here. I think the problems 
will be solved."

TEACHERS IN GLENDALE GIVE TENTATIVE OK TO CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Following months of negotiations, representatives of a Glendale teachers union 
this week tentatively accepted a new contract that calls for a 22.7% pay raise 
over three years. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers, who have been working without a contract since June, will be asked 
late next week to ratify the contract, which would give teachers an 8% 
retroactive pay raise this year. About 600 of the 930 teachers in the Glendale 
Unified School District are eligible to vote in the election, said Mark 
Desetti, president of the Glendale Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Desetti in March had called the district's pay raise offer "fairly good," but 
the union declared an impasse in negotiations because Desetti said teachers 
were demanding a greater say in the distribution of funds expected from the 
passage of the Proposition 98 school bond issue in November. 
</P>
<P>
Until last week, the district had refused the demand, postponing any benefits 
to teachers from bond funds until the final year of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Offer Modified 
</P>
<P>
Charles Duncan, district director of personnel and employee relations, said 
Tuesday that the district modified its offer Friday after state officials 
predicted that state bond money may be available to the district earlier than 
expected as a result of increased state tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
State officials earlier had indicated that no bond money would be available to 
school districts for at least three years and that any money allocated probably 
will be restricted to specific uses by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
With the latest revision, Duncan said, district officials offered to give 
teachers 55% of any unrestricted state bond money to use for their own 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Desetti said teachers have set three priorities for the money -- time during 
the school day for fourth- through sixth-grade teachers for paper work, 
increased health and welfare benefits for dependents of early retirees and, if 
any money remains, general salary increases for long-term teachers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Teachers' Demand 
</P>
<P>
Teachers had demanded that all of the priorities be financed through surplus 
revenues that they said they expect the district to receive as a result of 
rapid enrollment increases and from the state lottery. However, district 
officials have balked at committing uncollected surpluses to teacher salaries 
and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Desetti said the district offer "is significant, although not nearly what we 
wanted, ideally." 
</P>
<P>
Despite two sessions with a state-appointed mediator, union representatives 
"felt they had gone as far as they could go" in negotiations Friday, Desetti 
said. He said the next step would require an investigation by a state-appointed 
fact-finding committee, which could delay a settlement for six weeks or more. 
</P>
<P>
District officials have maintained that retroactive pay to teachers could be 
granted for this year only if a contract settlement is reached by June 30. 
</P>
<P>
In view of that, Desetti said, union representatives decided that teachers 
should be given the opportunity to review the district's latest proposal. A 
majority, although not all, of the teachers' 40-member representative council 
voted Monday to ask union members to ratify the package. 
</P>
<P>
He called the district's proposal on Proposition 98 funds "a major difference. 
This is a significant win for us." 
</P>
<P>
A general union meeting is tentatively scheduled at 3:30 p.m. Tuesday at R. D. 
White Elementary School, 744 E. Doran St. Balloting for union members is 
expected to be conducted the next two days.

POLICE ASK FOR MONEY TO HIRE 20 NEW OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In reaction to the city's rapid growth and the emergence of more law 
enforcement problems, the Glendale Police Department has asked for 20 new 
police officers this year and a total of 40 over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
If the request is approved, the department would expand the police roster of 
196 by more than 20% this year alone. It will be considered by the Glendale 
City Council in budget hearings next month. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief David J. Thompson said his department also requested a substantial 
budget increase to deal with the city's growing law enforcement problems, 
especially traffic management and gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
"I am praying very, very hard that the city will give a favorable review to our 
request," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
His prayers could go at least partly unanswered. Two council members said 
Wednesday that the council may not be able to come up with the $1.2 million to 
$1.4 million needed to pay and equip 20 new officers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Councilman Uncertain 
</P>
<P>
"The police request might be a reasonable one," Councilman Larry Zarian said. 
"But I don't think we can afford it, with all the requests from the other city 
departments." 
</P>
<P>
Zarian said he wants to add 35 to 43 new officers over the next five years, as 
requested by Thompson, but added that he believes that the city can afford no 
more than 10 additional officers in the upcoming budget year. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg said the biggest obstacle is finding 20 new 
officers without compromising the Police Department's recruiting standards. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see how we can accomplish it," she said. "I would hope we never lower 
our standards just to get numbers." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson acknowledged that it would demand a "Herculean effort" of the City 
Council to meet his department's requests. But he said the city is in dire need 
of such heroics. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, he said, his department has added only 25 sworn officers while the 
city's population has soared. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, the city has experienced significant changes in the patterns 
of criminal behavior, and the crimes prevalent today demand more manpower than 
those of yesteryear. 
</P>
<P>
"The burglary rate has gone down," he said, "but there's been an auto-theft 
explosion, and we're experiencing some gang-related behavior, both criminal and 
antisocial." 
</P>
<P>
To deter such activities, Thompson said, more foot-patrol officers are needed. 
"And foot patrols are much more expensive than car patrols because they cover a 
smaller area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Demands 
</P>
<P>
The booming downtown commercial district has put more demands on the police 
force, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
"The skyline is growing and the traffic congestion is growing correspondingly," 
he said. To avoid gridlock, Thompson said, police officers will have to be 
assigned to direct traffic during peak hours. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, police officers have directed traffic to help cope with Christmas 
shoppers, Thompson said. But given the city's soaring growth rate, officers 
will have to begin controlling traffic year-round, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Glendale is growing in numbers and diversity," Thompson said. "Our department 
has to grow accordingly."

Photo, First Tower of World Trade Center Opens -- Streams of festive balloons 
were loosed at a lavish ceremony Tuesday marking the opening of the first tower 
of the $550-million Greater Los Angeles World Trade Center in Long Beach. 
Future tenants and guests walked past displays and the International Children's 
Choir of America sang at opening ceremonies that included speeches by officials 
of the project's developers, IDM Corp. and Kajima International Inc. The Port 
of Long Beach obtained the land, is a sponsor of the project and is leasing 
three floors. The 27-story granite-sheathed building, the centerpiece of the 
city's redevelopment efforts, includes two levels of shopping and dining and 
will be the new Pacific headquarters for the U.S. Customs Service. It has a 
child-care center for 106 children. The tower is the first of four towers 
planned, in addition to a Hilton Hotel. Michael J. Choppin, president and 
chairman of the board of IDM, noted at the ceremonies that the combined ports 
of Long Beach and Los Angeles handle about two-thirds of the West Coast's cargo 
and 70% of California's international trade. RICK CORRALES / Los Angeles Times

3 CREDITED WITH SAVING LIFE OF STRICKEN RUNNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Long Beach police officer, an off-duty nurse and a spectator were being 
credited with taking quick medical action to save the life of a 64-year-old 
Claremont runner who collapsed Sunday in the last mile of the Long Beach 
Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
Bonard Morse's condition was downgraded from critical to serious Wednesday at 
St. Mary Medical Center, where he was taken after the 11:20 a.m. incident 
Sunday on Shoreline Drive at Linden Avenue. Hospital spokeswoman Mary Jane 
Foster said Morse was believed to have suffered a heart attack, but tests were 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
Police Officer Tom Ross, nurse Bonnie Schofield and spectator Dino Troche 
worked together in administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation to Morse until 
paramedics arrived, police spokesman Sgt. Bob Gillissie said. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't hesitate to take some action," Gillissie said.

Photo, When the sun finally came out, more than halfway through the running of 
the Long Beach Marathon, participants were looking for relief. They found it 
along 2nd Street in Belmont Shore. Volunteers had set up aid stations and were 
handing out paper cups of water to any runner looking for a handout. And along 
with the water to drink, there was water in the air to rinse off the sweat and 
briefly cool the skin. William Fitzpatrick, 36, of Long Beach takes a wet shot 
to the head from a volunteer with a hose. Fitzpatrick finished the 26.2-mile 
course in 3 hours 11 minutes 20 seconds. Steven Wille, 43, also of Long Beach, 
is silhouetted as he slows to a walk to linger in the misty air at the 
water-spray point. Wille's finishing time was 4:10:44. The winning time in the 
seventh annual marathon Sunday was 2:12:27, a course record set by Rex Wilson, 
28, of New Zealand. After a cloudy and cool start, excellent weather conditions 
most runners would agree, Wilson held himself behind the lead pack for the 
first 10 miles and watched the building heat and other physical problems take 
their toll on the leaders. When he took the lead, Wilson kept it to the finish. 
There were 4,021 entrants, including wheelchair competitors, race officials 
said. AXEL KOESTER

AROUND THE FOOTHILLS: LOOKING BACK, IT WASN'T A BAD HIKE, JUST DIFFERENT THAN 
ADVERTISED. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Concurrent with Historic Preservation Month in Glendale, the city is 
distributing a brochure called "Glendale: The Urban Hikeway." 
</P>
<P>
It's a potpourri of public relations ideas about the emerging urban scene. 
</P>
<P>
"Too often cities forget who they are, too busy in search of what they can 
become," its anonymous writer begins, drawing on a well-known theme. "Cities 
become impersonal -- inhumane." 
</P>
<P>
But not Glendale, the writer interjects reassuringly. 
</P>
<P>
"Glendale is rich in history and architecture. Glendale is unique with its own 
character and flavor. Glendale has charm -- truly a 'jewel city.' 
</P>
<P>
"And Glendale is people." 
</P>
<P>
There follows a list of three urban walking routes, accompanied by maps, to 
bring the reader face to face with the city's character, flavor and charm. 
</P>
<P>
Each route is meant to highlight a different facet of the jewel -- its 
financial center, its shopping district and its government row. 
</P>
<P>
Each is accompanied by a descriptive passage. The three-mile loop across the 
north side of downtown, for example, "lets you saunter through quiet 
residential streets before leading you to the heart of downtown Glendale's 
financial and business district." 
</P>
<P>
The writer has a touch, for sure, but couldn't be much of a gumshoe, I now 
suspect after falling for the pitch. 
</P>
<P>
I picked up the financial route at its southeast corner. The intersection of 
Lexington Drive and Brand Boulevard is as good as any to call the beginning of 
the financial district. The next five blocks merited the brochure's tout: 
"Blaze new trails through yesterday's history and watch today's history being 
made." 
</P>
<P>
The first sight on the right is a hole in the ground with one level of steel 
girders rising out of it, soon to be a high-rise. Across the street is Glendale 
Federal Savings' funny building with the blue shuttered windows and vertical 
red brick wedge imitating the bow of a ship. It was built as the flagship of 
Glendale's urbanization in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
Brand Boulevard shows promise in the next four blocks. The sidewalks, where not 
obstructed by construction, draw out crisply dressed young men and women all 
heading -- eyes forward -- toward some important engagements. Others gather 
around pillars on smoke break. The buildings are handsome and diverse, in 
red-and-white granite, blanched aggregate stone, mirrored glass and mauve 
paint. The sidewalk homeless avoid this part of town. 
</P>
<P>
Next comes the Ventura Freeway, wisely not mentioned in the text. Freeways make 
for poor walking, even where there is a sidewalk overpass. The noise is 
assaultive, the perspective too distant. It's where you're going, not where you 
are, that matters. On either side comes a gauntlet of left- and right-turn 
lanes slinging out cars whose drivers brook no interference in their moment of 
release from the tension of stop-and-go. 
</P>
<P>
The financial district spreads in both directions from the freeway, evidence 
that in spite of any brochure writer's rhapsodies, its organizing principle is 
the auto, not the pedestrian. 
</P>
<P>
On a gloomy Tuesday, the "hustle and bustle around Sears' Allstate Plaza" was 
not in evidence. No one sat beside four still-unfinished fountains. No one 
examined a series of candle-like statues in the lobby of a just-opened 
building. Warmer weather, new tenants and water in the fountains will 
undoubtedly soon fulfill the promise. 
</P>
<P>
Yet no such clear sense of future is evident on the next leg of the walk, going 
west on Arden Avenue. Here, the tour guide was either brutally honest or 
hopelessly naive. 
</P>
<P>
In the backwater of downtown, Arden is a hodgepodge of new and old with no 
apparent organizing principle at all: a couple of two-story office buildings, a 
1930s cottage that has become Decom Co., the Sloan &amp; Sloan School of 
Dancing in a kind of New York brownstone, a stucco apartment house, the yellow 
brick Glendale Moose Lodge 641, a concrete-walled factory, a pet hospital, the 
orange corrugated steel facade of the Verdugo Mental Health Clinic, the 
concrete foundation of something new, an Andy Gump, another stucco apartment, 
another professional building and so on. 
</P>
<P>
The route swings back along Burchett Street, definitely residential, but hardly 
quiet. Half a block north of the freeway, it hisses like a stadium. There are 
still pretty Craftsman houses there, but mostly the street serves three-story 
apartment complexes whose residents come and go by car through motorized steel 
grates. 
</P>
<P>
The last leg takes in the brick medical and optical buildings that cluster 
around Central Avenue, each oriented toward its own parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, it wasn't a bad hike, just different than advertised. 
</P>
<P>
Like many good urban walking routes, this one has some pleasures of the 
wilderness: a majestic skyline, several unexpected views of splashing water and 
lots of vegetation in the planters beside the buildings. And it can be taken by 
the introspective soul without engaging or being engaged by another human 
being. 
</P>
<P>
The walk is its own reward.

Fire officials confirmed Wednesday that an early-morning fire that destroyed a 
kindergarten classroom at Corona Elementary School in Bell was deliberately 
set. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze, which was reported at 1:29 a.m. Tuesday, caused about $250,000 in 
damage, Los Angeles County Fire Department spokesman Bill Franklin said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's of an incendiary origin," Franklin said, when asked if arson was 
considered the cause of the fire. "It's definitely that." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have not identified any suspects in the fire, Franklin said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire appeared to have started on a bookshelf a few feet from a doorway, and 
destroyed virtually all of the classroom, which was separated from the rest of 
the elementary school by a breezeway. There was no other damage to the school 
at 3825 Bell Ave., Franklin said. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin said investigators are not sure how the fire was started. "There is no 
evidence of a booster," such as gasoline, to ignite the blaze, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 27 kindergarten students displaced by the fire are attending class in the 
school's main building.

WORK TO BEGIN ON REGRADING 2 POST OFFICE LOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A contract to correct deficiencies in an Eagle Rock post office that is still 
unopened six months after its scheduled completion date has been awarded to an 
El Monte firm by postal officials. 
</P>
<P>
The $914,686 contract calls for regrading two parking lots built at a 10% 
grade, twice as steep as city ordinances allow. The contract was awarded to 
Extra Builders, which postal officials said submitted the lowest of four bids. 
</P>
<P>
The parking lots will serve the sleek, new Eagle Rock post office, a 
$7.9-million building that postal officials say will improve mail service in 
Eagle Rock and Highland Park. Work on the project has been stalled since 
September when, the U.S. Postal Service says, it discovered that the lots were 
too steep. 
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, workers will regrade the lots and move gasoline pumps for 
postal vehicles. Workers will also install a $3,900 fence around the parking 
lots. 
</P>
<P>
Postal officials attributed the grading problem to flaws in the building's 
design. Since the problem was discovered, they have replaced the architectural 
company, McCulloch Architects of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Postal Service officials said construction on the lot will begin this week. 
They said they expect work on the post office to be completed in July.

TAXPAYER-FUNDED GROUPS SUFFER FROM LAX ATTENDANCE; 
</P>
<P>
APATHY THREATENS TO KILL SIMI CITIZEN COUNCILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Once touted statewide as a model of grass-roots activism, Simi Valley's 
neighborhood councils program -- which advises city officials on matters 
ranging from repair of cracked sidewalks to the impact of development projects 
-- is in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
The Simi Valley City Council last month gave the four geographically based 
councils six months to improve attendance, which has fallen to an all-time low 
since the program was established 18 years ago. In a recent six-month period, 
for example, one of the 13-member councils only had enough members present once 
to vote on recommendations to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Those familiar with Simi Valley suggest the councils are victims of apathy 
common to bedroom communities, an overly bureaucratic structure and a lack of 
compelling issues facing the city. Whatever the reasons for their failure to 
involve residents, the councils, which together are funded by the city at about 
$60,000 annually, could be drastically restructured and possibly abolished if 
they do not bolster attendance by October, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Simi Valley City Councilman Bill Davis: "We've tried just about everything 
to get them to work. It seems to me there's no point in beating a dead horse, 
especially when you're doing it with taxpayers' money." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Valuable Voice 
</P>
<P>
But advocates of the councils say residents would lose a valuable voice in city 
affairs if the program perishes. Although Moorpark and Oxnard also have 
neighborhood councils, Simi Valley's program is unusual because it receives 
financial support from the city and its members are appointed by the City 
Council, said Stanley Moore, a professor of political science at Pepperdine 
University. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a way to be heard, and without the councils the city would miss out on a 
lot of good ideas," said John Etter, an engineering technician who recently 
joined one of the councils and used it as a forum to propose that the city add 
moisture sensors to its sprinkler systems to conserve water. "The councils 
ought to be saved." 
</P>
<P>
The program has changed significantly since its founder, Simi Valley's first 
mayor, Lester D. Cleveland, characterized it in a 1984 article published in the 
League of California Cities' magazine Western City as part of a revolution by 
citizens clamoring for a voice in municipal politics. Today, its critics 
acknowledge the councils' potential value as a means of increasing citizen 
participation, but say further modifications are needed because board members 
are out of touch with the residents they represent. 
</P>
<P>
Since the councils were formed in 1970, they have helped draw up an ordinance 
regulating signs, reviewed countless proposals for construction projects and 
recommended changes to the city's blueprint for development, known as a General 
Plan, which is updated periodically, officials said. The councils just 
completed one revision recently, which may be why interest has slackened, said 
Mike Stevens, a high school teacher who serves on one of the councils. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tend to Bypass Councils 
</P>
<P>
But in recent months residents have tended to bypass the neighborhood councils 
with the juicy issues that do exist, taking their concerns directly to the City 
Council. One of the councils recently recommended that the Planning Commission 
approve replacing some vacant buildings on Ralston Avenue near Tapo Street with 
a rental equipment yard, only to find that nearby residents actually were 
strongly opposed to the change. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really surprised when they showed up so angry at the Planning Commission 
meeting," said Albert Rosen, a retired high school teacher who serves on one of 
the councils. "Next time, we'll let residents know when something comes up that 
they might be concerned about." 
</P>
<P>
Grahame Watts, the city's neighborhood councils coordinator, said only two 
flyers were distributed by council members between October and March, the same 
six-month period in which attendance was so low. 
</P>
<P>
New residents, many of whom commute to work in Los Angeles County, may be 
unaware that the neighborhood councils exist, Watts said. When the program was 
originally established, there were five districts representing about 56,000 
residents citywide or about 11,200 neighbors each, and residents were excited 
about their new city, said founder Cleveland, who now lives in Indio. Two years 
ago, the City Council eliminated one council and redrew the boundaries of the 
remaining four in an effort to stimulate flagging participation, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the four districts represent about 101,000 people, or about 25,000 each. 
In contrast, Oxnard has 42 councils, each representing a much smaller pool of 
3,000 residents each, said Manny Vega, Oxnard's community relations officer. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Singleton, who helped form a citizens group last summer to fight irritating 
styrene odors emitted by a spa manufacturing plant in the west end of the city, 
ended up going directly to the City Council with the neighborhood's problem 
because she wanted quick action. She said she brought the matter to the 
attention of a neighborhood council, but was told she would have to wait a 
month until the issue could be listed on the next meeting's agenda. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Forget it, it's too dangerous to wait,' " Singleton said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brown Act's Role 
</P>
<P>
Because the neighborhood council members are appointed by the City Council, 
they are subject to a state law requiring governing bodies to give adequate 
notice when issues will be discussed, said Moore, the Pepperdine political 
science professor. The law, known as the Brown Act, was strengthened in the 
early 1980s, leading to frustrating delays and growing disenchantment with the 
neighborhood councils, said Simi Valley Councilwoman Ann Rock. 
</P>
<P>
In Moorpark and Oxnard, the councils can immediately respond to citizens' 
concerns because their members are elected by residents, although participation 
levels vary there also, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley officials say they are willing to consider abolishing the 
appointment system if it would save the councils. But their patience is growing 
thin. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to see the program die, but unless it improves soon, it's 
history," Davis said.

Photo, IVANHOE CELEBRATION -- Everything from 80-year-old class pictures to 
maps of what used to be called Ivanhoe Township are on display until May 19 at 
Ivanhoe School, where parents, administrators and alumni are celebrating the 
100th anniversary of the elementary school's founding. The school was the scene 
of a rollicking celebration Friday, with more than 500 people greeting friends 
they hadn't seen in years, listening to a Dixieland band and exchanging stories 
about things that happened when they were children. Ivanhoe School has held 
classes at the same site, 2828 Herkimer St., since it was founded in a 
two-story farmhouse in 1889. It is one of eight Los Angeles schools dating to 
1889 or earlier. The Ivanhoe School building that stands today, top, was 
completed in 1941. It is the third school building to be put on the site as the 
school's population grew. The school now has about 350 students. Pat Chow, 
left, and her son, Curtis, 3, took in the exhibits, as did some students, 
below. The exhibits include pictures, books, report cards and school equipment 
dating from the school's early days. LAWRENCE K. HO / Los Angeles Times

$693,000 STATE GRANT FOR PASADENA LANDMARK; 
</P>
<P>
FADED CASTLE TO GET A ROYAL RESTORATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ASHLEY DUNN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the corner of Raymond Avenue and Green Street, the Castle Green looms 
above rooftops of Old Pasadena like a musty, decayed vision of the city's grand 
past. 
</P>
<P>
Once considered the most sumptuous and exotic building in the city, the Castle 
Green has slowly weathered over the years into a soot-covered amalgam of 
peeling paint, cracked stucco and rusting ironwork. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like it suffered from deferred maintenance," said Claire Bogaard, 
executive director of the historical preservation group, Pasadena Heritage. 
"It's a bit shabby." 
</P>
<P>
But with the help of a $693,000 state grant awarded this month, Pasadena 
Heritage and the 39 owners of what is now a cooperative apartment building are 
set to embark on an ambitious plan to restore the exterior of the building to 
its old luster. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Craftsmen Needed 
</P>
<P>
Everything from its intricate Moorish plaster embellishments to window screens 
and copper gutters are to be restored to their original condition. 
</P>
<P>
Bogaard said if all goes as planned, craftsmen skilled in the antique trades of 
molding tin, repairing ancient plumbing and reforming cast plaster reliefs will 
finish their work by this time next year. 
</P>
<P>
"In the end, the city of Pasadena, Pasadena Heritage and the residents of 
Castle Green are going to be very proud of this building," said Willa Foster, 
who has lived in the building since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The Castle Green, originally part of the Hotel Green, is one of 33 projects in 
the state awarded grants from a one-time $11-million state fund earmarked for 
historical preservation and archeological projects. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Champion of the Cause 
</P>
<P>
Other projects that received grants include the old Chinatown site in 
Riverside, the sandstone camel barns in Benicia in Northern California and the 
Thomas Fallon House in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena Heritage decided to champion the cause of the Castle Green because it 
is close to the historic district of Old Pasadena, is one of the most widely 
recognized landmarks in the city and can be rented by the public for special 
events. 
</P>
<P>
In return, residents of the building gave Pasadena Heritage legal control over 
the facade of the building, meaning that the group will always be able to 
control any changes in the Castle Green's appearance. 
</P>
<P>
The building's eclectic mix of architectural styles has endeared it to 
generations of Pasadenans who have described it at various times as elegant, 
gloomy, charming, glorious, awesome and creepy. 
</P>
<P>
Film makers have used the 91-year-old structure as a stand-in for the French 
embassy in Turkey, a building in Hanoi, a funeral parlor in Chicago and, yes, 
even a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"I love this building, it has such an ambiance," resident Steve Hoskinson said. 
"It's sort of a dream to live here." 
</P>
<P>
The building, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, is one of 
the last vestiges of the great turn-of-the-century hotels that forged 
Pasadena's early reputation as a winter resort for the rich and famous. 
</P>
<P>
The Raymond and the Maryland were demolished in the 1930s. The Huntington has 
just been demolished to make way for a new hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The only hotels that remain are the Vista del Arroyo, which houses the U.S. 9th 
Circuit Court of Appeals, and two buildings of the Hotel Green. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Modest Beginnings 
</P>
<P>
The hotel began life as a modest two-story building called the Webster Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Construction began in 1887, but financial problems forced its owner, E.C. 
Webster, to sell the property two years later to an affluent Easterner who had 
fallen in love with Southern California and settled in Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
The new owner was Col. G.G. Green, who had made his fortune selling such 
popular elixirs of the time as "Green's August Flower" and "Green's Ague 
Conqueror." 
</P>
<P>
He set out to build the humble Webster Hotel into a veritable gem in the 
sunbaked flatlands below the San Gabriel Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
First, he enlarged the hotel to a five-story building, which was designed with 
a mixture of Spanish, Mexican and Moorish influences by architect Frederick L. 
Roehrig. 
</P>
<P>
In 1898, he built a western annex on the other side of Raymond Avenue that was 
even more exotically designed with Victorian, Mediterranean and pronounced 
Moorish features. A bridge that looked as if it was part of an ancient fortress 
was built over Raymond Avenue to connect the two buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Another wing was added to the western annex in 1903.

HELP WANTED ;

<P>
180 NATIONWIDE APPLY TO LEAD 1ST NEW CAL STATE CAMPUS IN 20 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It wasn't your typical help-wanted ad. 
</P>
<P>
The job description called for someone who is visionary, creative, a leader, a 
team player, a salesman, a personnel administrator, a business manager, a 
financial planner, an effective communicator and an accomplished academician. 
Preference, as they say, will be given to those who can walk on water. 
</P>
<P>
The ad ran once in a trade journal and, combined with a targeted direct mail 
campaign, helped generate 180 job applicants from throughout the United States. 
By June 13 one man or woman will be selected for the job that carries with it 
the title of president, San Marcos State University -- on a campus in San Diego 
County that today is in the clearing stages from its previous existence as a 
chicken ranch. 
</P>
<P>
On and around this person, a university will be built, the first new one in the 
California State University system in 20 years and, according to the American 
Assn. of State Colleges and Universities, the first one of its size and scope 
in 10 years in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
After San Marcos, the next likely site for a Cal State campus is Ventura. Cal 
State trustees are expected to start condemnation proceedings on 465 acres on 
the Taylor Ranch near Ventura for a university center, which could be expanded 
into a full four-year campus. 
</P>
<P>
That might be a long way down the road, but, if San Marcos's experience is 
indicative, competition for the president's job will be brisk. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
50 Presidents Among Candidates 
</P>
<P>
The names of the San Marcos candidates are not publicly disclosed, but among 
them are 50 current presidents of universities and colleges elsewhere. They 
come from private schools and public ones, including from the California State 
University system itself. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the largest turnout, the largest showing of interest we've ever had for 
any of our presidencies," said Caesar Naples, vice chancellor for faculty and 
staff relations for the CSU system and the staff executive leading the search 
for the president. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm impressed by the turnout but I'm not surprised," Naples said. "I can 
understand why almost anyone, from the East Coast to the West, north to south, 
large university or small, would be fascinated and captivated by the challenge 
of starting a new university. It would be the 20th campus in an outstanding 
public higher education system coupled with a wonderful location." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the ad that ran in the Chronicle of Higher Education, Naples 
sent letters about the San Marcos post to 1,400 college and university 
presidents and chancellors across the country, as well as 500-plus letters to 
heads of minority organizations involved in education, soliciting nominations 
for the job. 
</P>
<P>
The 13-member search committee has since narrowed the list to 15 semifinalists 
based on the strength of their resumes and a reading of their one- and two-page 
cover letters. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven of the 15 have already been personally interviewed by the search 
committee, which includes trustees, professors, alumni, a university staff 
employee and a student. The final four candidates will be interviewed May 24. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Field to Be Narrowed 
</P>
<P>
After the interviews, the 15 will be narrowed to three to five finalists whose 
names will then become public and who will be taken to the San Marcos campus 
site early next month for further interviews and meetings with university and 
community leaders. During the same period, background checks will be conducted 
on their home campuses, where a more accurate picture of the candidate may 
develop. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, on June 13, the finalists will be interviewed again by the full board 
of trustees in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
University trustees are expected to make -- and announce -- their decision that 
same day. 
</P>
<P>
There will be little negotiation between trustees and the applicant; starting 
salary will be about $106,000 a year, plus benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"All 15 people we're interviewing now meet all the requirements. Obviously, 
they're different people with different strengths -- some are stronger in one 
area than another," Naples said. "But we're in the fortunate position of not 
having to say, 'This particular person can't do X, but he does Y quite well.' 
In our situation, we have people who meet all the qualifications, and now it's 
a question of the fit, of who will be best for our needs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Finest Educators in Country' 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at the finest educators in the country," Naples said. "It's my 
job to be aware of all the presidential vacancies in the country, and to see 
who is available to fill them. I can tell you we're getting the lion's share of 
the best people in our search for San Marcos." 
</P>
<P>
And who wouldn't want the job? An offer to go out and build a university is a 
once-in-a-career opportunity. Hire your deans. Recruit your core faculty. 
Design a curriculum. Attract the students. Build a marriage between campus and 
community. Create a reputation. 
</P>
<P>
It would seem, then, that the best man or woman for the job is the trustees' 
for the picking. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Day, president of San Diego State University, isn't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
Day contends that the best person for the job will have to be convinced to take 
it. Anyone less cautious about stepping into the unknown should be viewed 
warily, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're looking for someone who is very good, as a general rule you're 
looking at someone who is doing well where he is, and who probably wants to 
stay there and is not desperate for a new job elsewhere," Day said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Don't Come Looking for You' 
</P>
<P>
"You could post almost any job and get 100 to 150 candidates. There are groups 
of people who will apply for anything, and may not be qualified," he said. 
"When you're in private industry, when you look for a CEO, you usually have to 
persuade that person to come to you. They don't come looking for you. 
</P>
<P>
"That shouldn't be any different with a university president," Day said. "The 
best people come from that small cadre who have to be persuaded they want your 
job more than they want their own." 
</P>
<P>
Day was not asked to participate in the search for a president at San Marcos, 
although he might seem a logical choice, given that San Diego State planted the 
seed for the campus when it opened its North County Center in Vista in 1979 
with 148 students. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its success, and the population growth in the north county, the 
state Legislature agreed that a full-fledged university should be built, and 
the 300-acre site in San Marcos was purchased. The campus will open in the fall 
of 1992 with upper-division and graduate students, and in 1995 will open to 
freshmen and sophomores as well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opening Is 4th in 2 Years 
</P>
<P>
The San Marcos presidency opening, Naples noted, is the fourth over the past 
two years within the CSU system, and through that repeated presidential search 
process his office has an extensive knowledge of who is, and isn't, on the job 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Naples won't say whether the chancellor's office has attempted to recruit 
specific candidates for the presidency of San Marcos. But the office has done 
it in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Day was a vice chancellor at the College Park campus of the University of 
Maryland when he took over as president of San Diego State in 1978. "I was 
perfectly happy there and wasn't looking around," he said. But a friend 
nominated him for the San Diego State presidency and he pursued it, partly 
because "I wanted to see San Diego. When it came to that stage of the 
interviews, I decided to fly out and look at the place." 
</P>
<P>
Day said visiting the campus convinced him he wanted the job, because of "its 
spirit, the atmosphere, the campus life and a tremendous faculty that was very 
alive and interesting." Such sales points don't exist when trying to persuade a 
university executive to commit to a non-existent campus, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Being a founding president "is too chancy," Day said. It could be a very 
attractive job if you've got the state giving you money for buildings and 
operations and the chancellor's office is behind you and the board is behind 
you so when the inevitable foul-ups occur during the first few years, they 
don't turn from you. 
</P>
<P>
"But it can be an absolute quagmire too," Day said. "The faculty can harass you 
if you don't hire this person or that. The funds can dry up." 
</P>
<P>
Day said he is especially doubtful that the search committee will find a 
sitting president in his 50s who wants the job. "It's most unlikely that a 
really talented, good-working, sitting president of that age would want to 
start over again. You've already gotten the adulation of being called 
president. You won't get anything new in being president of a small, unknown 
institution that you haven't already gotten where you are. If an older 
president really wants it, I'd be worried about why."

5 FINALISTS FOR PRESIDENT'S POST SHARE VISION OF CAL STATE DOMINGUEZ HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After two years under interim leadership, a new president for Cal State 
Dominguez Hills will be selected from five finalists next month at a meeting of 
university trustees in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates, in interviews last week, said they share with university 
officials a vision of the Carson campus as a model of what most California 
institutions of higher learning will become in the 1990s as the state's 
population and culture become increasingly diverse. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills, which was built in the postwar years to serve a largely white 
population explosion in the southern part of the county, now has a 58% minority 
enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
The five male finalists, selected from 134 applicants in a two-year search, 
will visit the campus on separate days this week. The board of trustees of the 
statewide university system will interview the candidates May 16 and announce 
their choice, a spokesman for the chancellor's office said. 
</P>
<P>
The winner will succeed Richard Butwell, who suffered a fatal heart attack in 
February, 1987, during a period of campus turmoil. John Brownell, who will 
retire later this year, has served as interim president during the search for 
Butwell's permanent replacement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5 Finalists 
</P>
<P>
The five finalists are Allan H. Clark, 53, executive director of Educational 
Consulting Services in Indianapolis and former president of Clarkson University 
in Potsdam, N.Y.; Robert C. Detweiler, 50, vice president for academic affairs 
at Cal State San Bernardino; John E. Kerrigan, 53, vice president for academic 
affairs at the downtown branch of the University of Houston; Herman Lujan, 53, 
vice provost for instruction of the University of Washington in Seattle, and 
William Earl Moore, 47, chemistry professor and former vice president for 
academic affairs at Texas Southern University in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking for a president who understands the multicultural dimensions 
and opportunities at Dominguez Hills," said Trustee Claudia Hampton, who 
chaired the 10-member selection committee. "We want a leader with lots of 
energy, lots of optimism . . . who sees Dominguez Hills as a microcosm of 
California's higher education in the next decade." 
</P>
<P>
The committee was composed of three trustees, three faculty members, an 
administrator, a student, an alumnus and a member representing the community. 
</P>
<P>
Hampton said the committee gave special attention to minority and female 
applicants, but though minorities were well represented among the applicants, 
only 10 women sought the position. She speculated that many women who might 
qualify already have good jobs that they would be reluctant to leave. The 
current salary for the Dominguez Hills post is $95,500. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Affirmative Action 
</P>
<P>
"Affirmative action was not the determining factor," Hampton said. "We felt we 
would know the individual who was right for Dominguez Hills, no matter what the 
sex or color." 
</P>
<P>
Three of the finalists are white, one is black and one is of Hawaiian and 
Latino descent. 
</P>
<P>
Don Hata, a history professor who served on the selection committee, said the 
group was "looking for someone who would strip off his shirt and reveal a big 
"S" on his chest -- in short, we need a super-person for this job. We've been 
in a maintenance mode for two years and now we need someone who can inspire the 
entire campus community to take a great leap forward." 
</P>
<P>
Hata, Hampton and others credited Brownell, the interim president, with 
bringing stability to the 8,200-student university after several years of 
declining enrollment and faculty unrest. Under Brownell's leadership, they 
said, enrollment has climbed by about 1,000 students, bringing it close to the 
high mark in the early 1980s. An additional 2,100 students are enrolled in a 
new nursing program. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews, the finalists said they thought they were selected because their 
experience and interest in multicultural education fit the leadership needs at 
Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cultural Diversity 
</P>
<P>
"Developing programs for urban universities has been a driving force in my life 
for 10 years," said Moore, of Texas Southern. "I believe Dominguez Hills can 
become a model institution that demonstrates that cultural diversity and 
excellence can coexist on the same campus." 
</P>
<P>
Moore, who is black, also was vice president for academic affairs at Prairie 
View A &amp; M University, a branch of Texas A &amp; M in Prairie View, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Detweiler, of San Bernardino, noted that "higher education in California has a 
long way to go before it really reflects the diversity of the state's 
population. Dominguez Hills is an ideal setting for developing the kind of 
programs that attract more students from the minority communities and help them 
achieve their highest goals." 
</P>
<P>
Detweiler, who has written papers on racism in the Americas, taught history at 
San Diego State University, where he also served as dean of the College of Arts 
and Letters. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan, of Seattle, was vice president for minority affairs at the University of 
Washington before becoming vice provost. Earlier, he was director of social and 
environmental studies at the University of Kansas and held a number of teaching 
posts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demand for Scientists 
</P>
<P>
Lujan, a native of Hawaii, said Dominguez Hills can become an important part of 
a national effort to bring greater numbers of minority students into the 
mainstream of education. In the next decade, he said, there will be a demand 
for scientists and other specialists that can "only be met by people of color 
and women. They are the largest single group available to move in as older 
people retire." 
</P>
<P>
Kerrigan, of the University of Houston, said the ethnic makeup of Dominguez 
Hills is similar to that at the Texas campus where he has been academic vice 
president for four years. A specialist in public administration and urban 
affairs, his experience includes administrative and teaching posts at the 
University of Nebraska and the University of Oregon, a stint with the Ford 
Foundation in Beirut and Jordan, and he has held the position of city manager 
of Aspen, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
That background, Kerrigan said, would be useful to a Dominguez Hills president 
in building closer relations with people, industries and institutions in the 
Carson area. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, of Indianapolis, was president of Clarkson University until 1987, when 
he helped found the private consulting firm. A graduate of Princeton, he taught 
at Brown University, where he was chairman of the math department, and then at 
Purdue University, where he was dean of the school of science for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Like other candidates, Clark said the Dominguez Hills presidency would offer an 
unusual opportunity for an administrator to work in the forefront of a new 
trend in education. 
</P>
<P>
"Dominguez Hills reflects the future of many other universities, where students 
are becoming a majority of minorities," he said. "It can set the pace on how 
such institutions should develop."

GUIMARAES SUPPLIES HAMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Pierce College men's volleyball team came within three points of sweeping 
heavily favored Orange Coast in the junior college state championships Friday 
at El Camino, before surrendering three consecutive games to lose. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Pierce Coach Ken Stanley wasn't about to blame it on Rio. 
</P>
<P>
Make that Rico from Rio. 
</P>
<P>
Rico Guimaraes, a sophomore outside hitter, might be the Brahmas' most valuable 
player. He was a foreign-exchange student at Hoover High, graduating in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"(Guimaraes) has got a good vertical jump and dynamite arm strength," said 
Orange Coast Coach Bob Wetzel, who watched the rangy, 6-foot-5 Brazilian 
force-feed the Pirates a team-high 30 kills. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley says Guimaraes is the consummate athlete. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 12 years I've been coaching at Pierce, he's probably in my top five 
players," Stanley said. "You never have to worry about motivating him. I think 
that's the true characteristic of a good athlete." 
</P>
<P>
Guimaraes, an All-South Coast Conference selection, is interested in several 
schools, including Long Beach State, Cal State Northridge, Hawaii and 
Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, three other Glendale players play for Pierce (18-3), runner-up to 
Orange Coast in the SCC. Milton Hahn attended Hoover and Mark Grist and Tyler 
Bates graduated from Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Bates, the starting setter, was also selected to the all-SCC team. "Bates is 
far and away the best setter in the conference," Wetzel said. 
</P>
<P>
Championship form: With just three returning players from last year's Southern 
Section 4-A Division championship badminton team, Pat Rogerson predicted this 
would be a rebuilding season for Glendale High. 
</P>
<P>
Happily, Rogerson's prognosis was inaccurate. The Dynamiters finished second in 
the Pacific League with a record of 11-4 and 7-2 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
The final match of the regular season against league-champion Alhambra might 
have been Glendale's most impressive. The contest lasted five hours, whereas 
most matches last about 2 1/2 hours. Glendale won, 10-9. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now the team looks in championship form," Rogerson said. "They've really 
fought tooth and nail the whole way." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale will be well-represented in the first round of the Southern Section 
individual finals Saturday at Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Twins Angela and Christian Armendariz will compete in the girls' doubles. Last 
month in Colorado Springs, Colo., the two won their second consecutive national 
title in girls' doubles for 18 and under. Christian and Jung Lee will play in 
the mixed doubles division. 
</P>
<P>
Lee and Eric Chu will compete in the boys' doubles. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental bound: Jeff Huerta, an all-Riverside County linebacker from Rubidoux 
High, recently announced his plans to enroll at Occidental College. 
</P>
<P>
Huerta, who led the Falcons with 107 tackles (58 unassisted) in nine games, was 
also named to the All-Citrus Belt League team. 
</P>
<P>
Add Occidental: Al Luginbill, head coach at San Diego State, is the scheduled 
keynote speaker the Occidental football coaches clinic May 20. Other lecturers 
include assistants from NCAA Division I and II programs such as Navy, Cal, and 
Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
The all-day clinic costs $17 and is intended for youth, high school and college 
coaches.

FOOTHILL TRANSIT ZONE TRIAL STARTS MONDAY IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opening arguments are scheduled Mondayon a court challenge to the San Gabriel 
Valley's Foothill Transit Zone, which began bus service late last year. 
</P>
<P>
Drivers and mechanics of the Southern California Rapid Transit District sued 
the zone last year, claiming that the agency threatened union jobs and 
constituted an illegal breakup of the RTD. The trial was scheduled to begin 
this week in Los Angeles Superior Court, but Judge Eli Chernow continued the 
case because one of the attorneys involved had a personal emergency. 
</P>
<P>
The transit zone, which was established and funded by the county Transportation 
Commission, is operating former RTD commuter routes from Glendora and Diamond 
Bar to downtown Los Angeles. It plans to expand its service by August. Its 
basic cash fare is 85 cents, compared to the RTD fare of $1.10. 
</P>
<P>
The United Transportation Union and the Amalgamated Transit Union, which 
represent the RTD drivers and mechanics, had sought to bar the commission from 
implementing or funding the zone on the basis that the commission has no power 
to establish a regional transit agency. The issue of whether the Foothill zone 
is a "regional" or "local" zone will be decided at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Chernow barred the transfer of the RTD lines to the zone without 
the RTD's consent. The RTD board subsequently gave its consent in exchange for 
the commission's release of $50 million in funds the Transportation Commission 
had withheld.

PERAZA RESIGNS OXNARD POSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Peraza has resigned only two weeks after completing his first season as 
baseball coach at Oxnard College. 
</P>
<P>
The Condors finished the season 16-15 overall, 11-9 in the Western State 
Conference, which was good for a third-place tie with Moorpark College and a 
berth in the conference's Shaughnessy tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Peraza, a Spanish teacher at Thousand Oaks High, said his decision stemmed from 
the difficulty of performing what was, in effect, two full-time jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"It was too hectic," said Peraza, who was paid a stipend for coaching the 
Condors on a walk-on basis. "Being a head coach is an enormous amount of work, 
and not all of it is coaching baseball. It's a lot of paper work." 
</P>
<P>
Peraza said his best years at Oxnard were the nine he spent as an assistant to 
Jerry White, who resigned a year ago citing health reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"That was nice," he said. "All I did then was come to the field and coach." 
</P>
<P>
Peraza said he would like to remain in coaching, but does not have any 
immediate plans. 
</P>
<P>
"If any full-time jobs open you'll see me there going for it," he said. "But 
for now I'm going to take care of the job that pays most of my bills." 
</P>
<P>
The opening for a baseball coach at Oxnard is the second among the three 
schools in the Ventura Community College District. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Stillwell resigned last month as coach at Moorpark after five seasons for 
similar reasons. Stillwell, who is also a teacher at Thousand Oaks High, said 
that serving as a walk-on coach at the community college level had too many 
drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
White said Tuesday that he has no interest in either the Moorpark or the Oxnard 
opening.

RIO MESA, OAK PARK TAKE STEPS IN DIRECTION OF SECTION TRACK TITLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Rio Mesa and Oak Park highs, both in search of a Southern Section track and 
field title, took impressive first steps toward that goal in the Channel League 
and Tri-Valley League finals last week. 
</P>
<P>
Rio Mesa -- powered by Angela Burnham -- won eight of 15 girls' events in the 
Channel League finals Friday at Santa Barbara City College. 
</P>
<P>
Oak Park -- led by Jason Stein -- won nine of 16 boys' events at the Tri-Valley 
League finals at Fillmore last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham won the 100 meters in 11.7 seconds and the 200 meters in 25.0, and 
anchored the Spartans' 400 and 1,600 relays to victories in 49.0 and 3 minutes, 
57.5 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Teammates Shannon Wiebelhaus, Danielle Tanner and Tarin Tucker also won events. 
</P>
<P>
Wiebelhaus, who runs the second leg on the Spartans' relays, ran 45.9 in the 
300 low hurdles and freshman Tanner set a personal best of 58.5 in the 400. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker, a junior, added victories in the long jump (15 feet, 11 1/4 inches) and 
triple jump (34-4). 
</P>
<P>
Rio Mesa, which tied Bakersfield for last year's state title, qualified two 
relay teams and seven athletes in nine individual events for Saturday's 3-A 
prelims at Gahr High. 
</P>
<P>
The top three finishers in each event in the league finals advanced to this 
week's Southern Section prelims. 
</P>
<P>
Second behind Hawthorne in last year's 4-A championships, Rio Mesa was moved to 
the 3-A last September when the Channel League switched divisions. 
</P>
<P>
The move has made the Spartans a favorite for the 3-A girls' title. The boys' 
team also has a good chance to place in the top five. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking good right now," Rio Mesa co-coach Brian FitzGerald said. "We 
didn't have any big disappointments in the league finals. Everyone who we 
needed to get through, did." 
</P>
<P>
The Rio Mesa boys' team -- led by Scott Guerrero -- won four events at the 
league finals and qualified 12 athletes in eight individual events -- plus the 
1,600 relay team -- for the 3-A prelims. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero won the 800 in 1:59.4, placed second in the 400 in 50.4, and anchored 
the victorious 1,600 relay (3:24.5). 
</P>
<P>
Teammates Eric Thomas (6-8 in the high jump) and Patrick Van Scoy (52-8 1/2 in 
the shotput) also won events. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Van Scoy added a second-place effort in the discus (149-0). 
</P>
<P>
Stein, the two-time defending 1-A champion in the 400, did it all for Oak Park, 
the defending 1-A team champion, in the Tri-Valley League finals. 
</P>
<P>
Stein, a senior, won the 220 yards (22.7), the 440 (50.6), the 330-yard 
intermediate hurdles (42.2) and also anchored the victorious 440 relay team 
(43.8). 
</P>
<P>
Rich Frank and Jess Garner were also instrumental in Oak Park's victory. 
</P>
<P>
Frank won the 100 meters in 10.7, placed second in the 220 (22.8) and ran the 
first leg on the 440 relay. 
</P>
<P>
Garner took the 120-yard high hurdles in 15.0, ran the third leg on the 440 
relay, placed second in the 330 intermediate hurdles (42.4) and was third in 
the 100 (11.4). 
</P>
<P>
Oak Park qualified 17 athletes in 10 events, plus both relay teams, for the 1-A 
prelims at Arcadia High on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Williamson of Thousand Oaks, Philip Antoine of Newbury Park, Tim Ross of 
Royal and Kim Mays of Westlake were double winners at the Marmonte League 
finals at Camarillo High on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Williamson, runner-up in last year's State Division I cross-country 
championships, had an impressive triple to help Thousand Oaks win the boys' 
team title with 119 points, 11 ahead of runner-up Royal. 
</P>
<P>
Williamson won the 1,600 in 4:21.67, the 3,200 in 9:19.15, and finished third 
in the 800 in a personal best of 1:58.41. 
</P>
<P>
Antoine won the 100 (11.03) and 200 (22.65), while sophomore Ross took the high 
jump (6-6) and triple jump (42-5 1/4). 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' meet, Mays led the Warriors to a 124-117 upset victory over 
league dual-meet champion Thousand Oaks, winning the 100 low hurdles in 15.61 
and the high jump at 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
Tiffany Lammers (12.68 in the 100), Christy Wede (1:00.31 in the 400) and 
Jeanine Rothman (11:23.28 in the 3,200) added victories for Westlake, which won 
both relays as well.

RECORD SEASON EARNS VENTURA A VACATION; 
</P>
<P>
PIRATES' WSC CHAMPIONSHIP EARNS TEAM A BYE INTO THIRD ROUND OF STATE TOURNAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
If Ventura College falters in the Southern California regional of the state 
junior college baseball tournament, the Pirates cannot use fatigue as an 
excuse. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates, seeded third, received a bye to the third round of the playoffs. 
Ventura earned its extended vacation by defeating Valley College, 5-1, in the 
championship game of the Western State Conference playoffs Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura (29-9), and the tournament's other five conference champions, receive 
byes into the double-elimination finals that will be held May 19-21 at Rancho 
Santiago and Cerritos colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Gary Anglin said the Pirates' jump into the third round takes pressure 
off his team. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at it this way -- nobody expected us to be here," Anglin said. "We 
don't want to go out and embarrass ourselves or our conference, but it's all 
gravy for us at this point. We're just having fun now." 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates enjoyed themselves last weekend against Valley. Sophomore 
right-hander Shane Espitia (8-2) threw a complete-game five-hitter and Brent 
Cookson, who set five school records this season, contributed a bases-loaded 
triple. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really looking forward to going to state," Cookson said. "I think the 
layoff will help, mainly because it will give our pitchers a little time to 
rest up." 
</P>
<P>
Cookson set career records for runs batted in (94); games played (74); total 
bases (156); and times on bases (151), as well as a single-season record for 
RBIs (57). 
</P>
<P>
The sophomore left fielder was not Ventura's only record-setter, however. 
</P>
<P>
Darren Lloyd and Gabe Diaz each tied the single-season record for runs scored 
(43). Lloyd also set a single-season record for walks with 43. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman left-hander Dean McMillin (10-4), the WSC Player of the Year, tied the 
school record for victories in a season. In addition, he was 8-2 in the WSC 
with 57 strikeouts, tops in the conference in both categories. 
</P>
<P>
As a team, Ventura set a school record for victories, despite fielding a squad 
of 22 freshmen and only eight sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime you can fool the critics it's nice," Anglin said. "Won-loss-wise, this 
is the best team we've had, but offensively it's not the best. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best pitching Ventura has had and defensively it ranks right up 
there with the '83 team." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura, which has won 11 of its last 12, is making its first trip to the state 
playoffs since 1972. Ventura was the co-champion in the WSC in 1974, but only 
one team advanced to state that season and Ventura was left behind. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura and Valley are the only WSC teams represented among the playoff's 14 
entries. Valley (29-11-1), seeded ninth, will play host to Orange Coast 
(30-10-1), seeded 13th, in today's playoff opener. 
</P>
<P>
Other first-round games include: Grossmont at Cerritos; East Los Angeles at 
Rancho Santiago; and Citrus at San Diego Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Both Canyons -- which tied Ventura to earn a share of its ninth consecutive WSC 
title -- and Moorpark failed to earn at-large playoff berths. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark, which finished third in the WSC tournament, ousted Canyons from the 
first round of the conference tournament and lost to Valley in the second 
round.

'AGHAST' AT LACK OF PROGRESS;

<P>
TORRES SETS HEARING ON WATER CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Dismayed by the slow pace of efforts to clean up contaminated ground water in 
the San Gabriel Valley, Rep. Esteban Torres (D-La Puente) will conduct a 
full-scale congressional hearing on the issue June 5 at Baldwin Park City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm aghast that after 10 years and $5 million spent on studies, (government 
efforts) have not produced a drop of clean water," Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
The congressman, who has called the hearing as chairman of the Small Business 
Committee's subcommittee on environment and labor, said he has asked Daniel 
McGovern, regional administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 
to explain the EPA's strategy for protecting the area's water supply. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said the San Gabriel Valley has "the largest known ground-water 
contamination problem in the United States." And yet, he said, it is not at all 
clear what sort of plan EPA has formulated to attack this problem or whether 
there is any hope of finding the polluters and making them pay for the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
About 1 million people in the San Gabriel Valley depend on the Main San Gabriel 
Basin for their water. More than one-fourth of the 400 wells in the basin are 
contaminated with volatile organic compounds, such as trichloroethylene (TCE) 
and perchloroethylene (PCE). At last count, 65 wells were shut down, 35 because 
of volatile organics and 30 because of high nitrate readings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Wells Dug 
</P>
<P>
San Gabriel Valley water producers have managed to deliver water that meets 
federal and state standards by digging new wells, installing treatment systems 
and blending lower-quality water with high-quality water. 
</P>
<P>
EPA put the San Gabriel Valley ground-water problem on its Superfund cleanup 
list in 1984, five years after TCE and other industrial solvents that are 
suspected carcinogens were first detected in area wells. 
</P>
<P>
EPA has put much of its Superfund effort in the San Gabriel Valley thus far 
into studies that define the extent of ground-water contamination and in 
developing plans to keep contaminants from spreading southward through Whittier 
Narrows into another water basin that also serves 1 million people. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, EPA approved its most ambitious project so far for the region, 
construction of a $5.4-million system to treat ground water at Whittier 
Narrows. It also began channeling funds to the Los Angeles Regional Water 
Quality Control Board to help it find companies that are polluting ground 
water. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complicated Cleanup 
</P>
<P>
Torres said he has asked state and regional regulatory agencies, local water 
officials, and businessmen and residents concerned about water quality to 
testify at the June 5 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Wil Baca, a Hacienda Heights environmentalist and engineer who has been asked 
to testify, said cleaning up the entire ground-water basin is so complicated 
and expensive that the best course might be to pump ground water only for 
nondrinking purposes and turn to bottled water or in-home treatment systems for 
drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
Baca noted that EPA has estimated that it would take decades and perhaps $800 
million to undertake a full cleanup of the basin, if the job can be done at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that the problem is hopeless," Baca said. 
</P>
<P>
Royall Brown, who was elected to the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water 
District board last year on a water cleanup platform, said he hopes the 
congressional hearing will have the impact on water contamination that another 
hearing had on a toxic waste problem six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weaknesses Exposed 
</P>
<P>
Brown recalled that Torres arranged a congressional hearing in West Covina in 
June, 1983, to examine problems at the BKK landfill. Brown, who lives near the 
landfill, said that hearing was a key event leading to a halt in toxic-waste 
disposal at BKK a year later. The hearing exposed weaknesses in regulatory 
oversight of toxic-waste disposal and offered the first strong scientific 
evidence that contaminants could seep out of the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he does not know whether the ground-water hearing will offer any 
scientific revelations, but it will at least focus attention on the 
water-quality problem. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said he, too, hopes that this hearing will be as productive as the BKK 
hearing six years ago. That hearing, he said, led to legislation that would 
have closed BKK to toxic waste if the dump operators had not taken that step 
voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said he expects the Baldwin Park hearing to be the first of a number of 
hearings on water contamination problems in the nation, and he expects to draft 
legislation based on the information that is developed.

NORIEGA AGENTS BEAT UP LEADERS OF OPPOSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
PANAMA CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guillermo Endara, leader of the effort to overturn the regime of Panamanian 
strongman Manuel A. Noriega, was attacked and beaten Wednesday by 
steel-pipe-wielding government security agents as he led a protest march 
through downtown Panama City. 
</P>
<P>
According to South American diplomatic sources, at least one bodyguard of 
Guillermo (Billy) Ford, one of two vice presidential candidates on Endara's 
ticket in last Sunday's presidential election, was shot and killed during the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
Ford himself was badly beaten and taken away by police. He was later released 
and turned over to his family. 
</P>
<P>
Endara's other vice presidential running mate, Ricardo Arias Calderon, was 
beaten in the same attack. However, he was only slightly hurt and sought refuge 
in a private home. 
</P>
<P>
An opposition spokesman identified the dead bodyguard as Manuel Alexis Guerra, 
22, and said that another of Ford's bodyguards, Umberto Montenegro, was 
hospitalized with a chest wound. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surge in Violence 
</P>
<P>
The brutalizing of Endara, whose claim to an overwhelming victory in the 
election has been legitimized by the Roman Catholic Church and independent 
foreign observers here, marked a day of accelerating violence by the Noriega 
regime in which at least two people were killed and seven were wounded by 
gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
Endara, 53, was hospitalized briefly with a slight concussion and a head wound 
that took six stitches to close. 
</P>
<P>
The attack on the leaders of the Democratic Alliance of Civic Opposition was 
followed by a raid on Endara's office, which his aides said was ransacked and 
burned. 
</P>
<P>
Also, according to an eyewitness, a key aide to the presidential candidate, 
businessman Luis Martins, was kidnaped by four armed men. 
</P>
<P>
The witness, who asked not to be identified, said that Martins was standing 
outside his office building waiting to join the demonstration when a vehicle 
carrying four men stopped and demanded that he get in. When he refused, they 
leaped from the vehicle and pushed him inside. The car, which carried no 
license plates but flew a Panamanian flag, then sped away with Martins' legs 
extending from an open door. 
</P>
<P>
The attacks and a general atmosphere of chaos, including roving bands of armed 
men firing randomly in the air and military units facing demonstrators, 
journalists and ordinary bystanders alike with water cannons, led the 
headquarters of the U.S. Southern Command here to restrict the movement of all 
American personnel in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the afternoon, after Endara was beaten, Noriega ordered the 
mobilization of the so-called Battalions of Dignity, paramilitary groups 
ostensibly organized by the regime to defend the country against an "American 
invasion." 
</P>
<P>
However, the battalions have been used frequently to intimidate Noriega's 
opponents and have threatened to raid wealthy neighborhoods where many of 
Endara's supporters live. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tactic to Keep Power 
</P>
<P>
The day's activities appeared to answer questions about how Noriega, who has 
been the object of determined but unsuccessful efforts to oust him from power, 
would deal with the apparent electoral defeat of his handpicked presidential 
candidate, Carlos Duque. In spite of a massive effort to steal the election by 
fraud, the regime failed to cast serious doubt on Endara's apparent victory. 
</P>
<P>
There had been speculation that Noriega, who has not been seen or heard from 
publicly in days, was under pressure from his political allies and some 
elements of the Panama Defense Forces to seek some sort of accommodation that 
would ease growing international condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
"But now it seems that the general has opted to brazen it out and put down the 
opposition by a show of force," one diplomat said. "His answer is what you see 
in the streets today." 
</P>
<P>
Noriega is Panama's de facto ruler from his base as commander of the Defense 
Forces, this country's sole military and police organization. 
</P>
<P>
The attack on Endara came as he, Ford and Arias Calderon were leading a caravan 
of cars and demonstrators on foot demanding recognition of an opposition 
electoral victory. "It is a celebration, not a protest," Endara said in an 
interview just before the parade began at noon. Ironically, he said there was 
no reason to fear government intervention. 
</P>
<P>
"They won't hurt us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As the demonstration moved through various areas of downtown Panama City, 
security forces -- known as Dobermans because they were insignia depicting that 
breed of dog -- fired tear gas and blocked the protesters' movements. But there 
were no serious incidents until the caravan reached Santa Ana Park in Old 
Panama, a run-down section of narrow streets and shabby wooden buildings. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Endara and the others got out of their cars to talk with a group 
of riot troops blocking the streets, Endara told reporters in the hospital 
after he was treated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Relates Incident 
</P>
<P>
With an aide standing behind waving the extra-large, bloodstained white shirt 
that his boss had been wearing, Endara sat in a wheelchair and related the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to turn right (into the park), but the lieutenant told us we had to 
wait while he got authorization. Suddenly somebody began to fight with me. He 
broke my glasses and hit me several times." 
</P>
<P>
A more complete account came from Julio Harris, secretary general of the 
Authentic Liberal Party, one of the three parties making up the Democratic 
Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
"I was standing just behind Endara," he told reporters. "Endara asked if we 
could move to our right into the park. A lieutenant told us we should wait 
because he had no authorization. 
</P>
<P>
"After about half an hour and while we were standing there, we noticed men in 
civilian clothes coming at us from the sides." Harris said they were carrying 
steel pipes wrapped with tape and wearing red T-shirts with writing identifying 
them as members of the Dignity Battalions. 
</P>
<P>
"Then suddenly they began firing in the air," Harris continued, "and I looked 
in that direction. When I looked back the dignity battalions were beating 
Endara with steel pipes." 
</P>
<P>
Harris, who also was bloodied in the fighting, said that Endara was hit in the 
forehead and was knocked to the ground unconscious. The leader was dragged by 
his followers to a taxi and taken first to the executive hotel where the 
alliance has its offices and then to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Endara told National Public Radio that "the soldiers did nothing to interfere" 
with the attackers. "They were protecting the others," he said in reference to 
the dignity battalion members. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the attack, reporters saw a man who had been shot to death on a 
nearby side street. Four other men were wounded in the area, while three people 
were hurt during confrontations in the city of Colon, at the Caribbean entrance 
to the Panama Canal. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the regime intermittently cut off outgoing international 
telephone calls and interfered with the transmission of the Armed Forces 
Television and Radio Service, broadcast from a U.S. installation. 
</P>
<P>
During the day, the government frequently broadcast on television scenes of 
trash thrown by the demonstrators and protesters' barricades, while a narrator 
said that troops and other security forces were defending the country against 
subversives and warning that the United States is planning to invade. 
</P>
<P>
According to diplomats and other experts, Noriega appears to be trying to cut 
off any serious popular uprising before it can get started by elevating the 
level of violence and thus frightening the public. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, this tactic has worked. Observers refer to a so-called wimp factor 
in talking about the generally disorganized and non-confrontational nature of 
Panamanian anti-government sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more a milling about than a demonstration," said one observer who has 
witnessed anti-Noriega protests since the current crisis began 15 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday, there were more militant signals by the protesters. Occasional 
barricades of stones and other debris were constructed and material was burned 
in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
There also were reports of rocks being thrown at troops. 
</P>
<P>
Endara told reporters that "I won't back off one inch in the fight. Noriega 
stands for everything bad in Panama. He has to leave."

MAN FIGHTING HIS OWN AIDS BATTLE IS NAMED TO HEAD L.A. PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR MERINA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Dave Johnson, the battle against AIDS has been both a personal and 
professional mission. 
</P>
<P>
A leader in the gay and lesbian community, Johnson is infected with the virus 
that leads to AIDS. Three years ago, his lover died from AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"For those of us who live in communities substantially impacted by AIDS, it's 
like being in a war. . . . And for those of us fighting AIDS, we've enlisted 
until the war is over," said Johnson, who was named Wednesday as the first AIDS 
coordinator for the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Associations 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who currently co-chairs the United AIDS Coalition, an umbrella group 
for 30 organizations that assist people with AIDS, was appointed to the 
$45,000-a-year-post and given the task of mobilizing the city's efforts to cope 
with the AIDS epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley, who joined several City Council members and other officials 
in announcing his appointment, praised the 34-year-old Johnson as "a strong and 
valuable asset to the city in our fight against the spread of AIDS. His direct 
service experience with persons with AIDS and with community organizations make 
him the best candidate for this position." 
</P>
<P>
Although statistics are not available for the number of AIDS cases in Los 
Angeles, health officials say that many of the 6,737 cases reported countywide 
as of March 31 are city residents. 
</P>
<P>
Parker Anderson, director of the Community Development Department where Johnson 
will work, said the new appointee was selected over an original field of 39 
applicants to "provide the glue that will pull together the disparate pieces" 
of the city's AIDS policy. 
</P>
<P>
As part of his new duties, Johnson will oversee a $1-million housing program 
that is aimed at building hospices or other shelters for people with AIDS that 
will receive funds from the CDD and the Community Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Job-Training Program 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Johnson will help coordinate a $600,000 job-training program, 
which won council approval Wednesday, that will train people to work at the 
homes of AIDS patients and provide needed assistance. Johnson will also be 
involved in advocating legislation to help AIDS patients and developing 
educational projects aimed at preventing the spread of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"We will focus on minority communities that have been underserved by AIDS 
education in the past," said Johnson, who mentioned the black, Asian and Latino 
communities as areas where more AIDS education is needed. "But I want to go out 
to the different communities, talk to their leaders and see what their agendas 
are." 
</P>
<P>
Bridging that gap between public agencies and community groups is part of 
Johnson's background. The former May Department Stores executive, who said he 
quit two years ago to become involved full time in the fight against AIDS, has 
served as executive director of Being Alive, a group that represents people 
with AIDS, AIDS Related Complex or are infected with the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
Among many in the AIDS community, Johnson is considered a quiet but effective 
voice whose political tactics reflect those of "a pinstriped activist." 
</P>
<P>
When vandals spray-painted county buildings in protest over the delay in 
opening an AIDS ward at County-USC Medical Center, Johnson denounced the move 
as counterproductive. Although Johnson agreed with complaints that government 
agencies have failed to adequately deal with the health crisis, he distanced 
himself from the tactics of the more militant groups. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson acknowledged Wednesday that Los Angeles' selection of an AIDS 
coordinator comes years after such cities as San Francisco, but he added that 
he believes his appointment signals a strong commitment, particularly after the 
city selected someone afflicted with the virus. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who has been taking the drug AZT and has no symptoms of the disease, 
said: "This says to me that the city wants the communities affected by AIDS to 
be in charge of the fight against AIDS."

CITY, STADIUM DISPUTE FOR WHOM THE WHO TOILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Who is the rock group bringing in the money, but the question is, who will 
get the money that The Who brings in? 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Manager Jack McGrory says the estimated $300,000 the British 
rockers are expected to net for the stadium should pass automatically into the 
city's general fund, to be used for city improvements as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
Stadium Authority Board member Mike Gotch said he and others on the nine-member 
body favor the money's being used for stadium improvements, such as seat 
replacement and the installation of rubberized, non-slip flooring. 
</P>
<P>
The stadium is bringing The Who to San Diego, Gotch argues, so the stadium 
should get the money. 
</P>
<P>
"I work for the city manager," said stadium Manager Bill Wilson, who has booked 
The Who for an Aug. 22 concert. "So you see where I stand on this one. My job 
is to run the stadium. I want to stay out of this one." 
</P>
<P>
McGrory said the City Council, which has jurisdiction over the authority board, 
may have to decide the matter at a stadium budget hearing in mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is that the stadium operation has been subsidized by the general 
fund as long as we can remember," McGrory said. "We put $500,000 to $1 million 
into the stadium every year just to help it break even. We think earmarking 
revenues is a bad precedent. It hasn't been done before. Why should we do it 
now? 
</P>
<P>
"Money coming into the city goes into a general fund and is spent according to 
citywide priorities," McGrory said. "Our suggested compromise is that, if the 
stadium breaks even on its own (in 1989), we could take the surplus revenues 
from the concert and put those into capital improvements at the stadium." 
</P>
<P>
Gotch said the authority board has recommended to the council that all 
stadium-generated proceeds be directed to the stadium for improvements. He said 
the rubberized, non-slip flooring has been budgeted for $140,000 for fiscal 
year 1990, $460,000 in 1992 and $600,000 in 1995. He said seat replacement will 
cost $125,000 a year over the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time those improvements are completed, the next Super Bowl will have 
come and gone," Gotch said, provided San Diego is approved as host of one of 
the upcoming games. "Hopefully, a World Series will have come and gone. At 
least 10 million people will have passed through the gates by then," he said 
"We're going to ask the City Council to condense the capital-improvement time 
frame to three years. It can easily be accomplished if revenues from concerts 
be directed to the stadium." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said the new flooring and seats could be installed sooner than expected, 
provided the National League Padres continue at a pace that will see 2.4 
million fans pass through the gates during the current baseball season. If the 
National Football League Chargers have a good year, that would only bolster the 
capital-improvement timetable, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Rolling Stones want to come to the stadium for a two-day 
concert in November that McGrory said could net the stadium (or is it the 
city?) as much as $750,000. But both said the Stones' chances are nil, since a 
two-day event, spanning seven hours each day, would do permanent damage to the 
field. They said the Stones' proposal is bitterly opposed by the Chargers and 
San Diego State University Aztecs, regular tenants who share the 
</P>
<P>
field during that month. 
</P>
<P>
"Two days of the Stones would reduce the field to what (Chargers' official) 
Jack Teele calls Astro Dirt," Wilson said. "We can't have a two-day concert on 
that field at that time under any circumstances. In August, we'd have a chance 
to repair the field. But in November, with two teams playing on it, we'd have 
to play 10 games on nothing but dirt." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said a one-day appearance by the Stones hasn't been ruled out, but rock 
fans shouldn't be optimistic about seeing them here; the Stones have said they 
want to play in November for two days or not at all. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$5 Million in Improvements 
</P>
<P>
McGrory said the city manager's office has approved $5 million in stadium 
improvements over the past four years, including a new parking lot and sound 
system. He said the stadium requires about $5 million a year from the general 
fund just to break even. He said its operating expenses run about $4.5 million 
a year and its annual bond payment of $2.5 million will have to be made through 
the year 2003. 
</P>
<P>
Its revenues run only about $6.3 million a year, McGrory said, "so if the 
Padres and Chargers have lousy years, we're the ones making up the difference." 
</P>
<P>
McGrory pointed out that, despite having jurisdiction over the authority board, 
the City Council need not approve events booked for the stadium. So the council 
won't be asked to rubber-stamp the Stones, The Who or any other group Wilson 
schedules for rock shows. 
</P>
<P>
What happens to the money such groups generate is, of course, a different 
matter. As McGrory pointed out, money is the only reason rock bands would ever 
be courted. As it is, the stadium has not permitted a rock show that required 
seating on the field since 1983, and the group playing that night was The Who. 
</P>
<P>
The unofficial ban on concerts came about because of the quagmire the field 
became and the extra security that such events require. 
</P>
<P>
If individual tenants had their way, "We'd never have a concert in the 
stadium," McGrory said, "and that includes The Who -- no matter how much money 
we make. The tenants just don't feel it's worth it. We've worked too hard to 
get the field in its present condition, and we're not going to tear it apart 
just for the sake of money."

ALLEGED VICTIM TESTIFIES;

<P>
PANEL HEARS STORY OF BEATING BY FIRED OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A Harbor View man testified Wednesday that a San Diego police officer, 
mistaking him for a shooting suspect, kicked him repeatedly in the groin, 
struck him in the ribs with a baton and sprayed Mace into his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony occurred during the first day of a hearing for Allen A. Stovall, 
a three-year veteran who was fired from the Police Department after the 
incident last year and is now appealing his dismissal to the city's Civil 
Service Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old officer was dismissed in December. His termination notice also 
referred to an incident in 1987 in which he was given a two-day suspension for 
striking a citizen with the butt of a shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time, you were advised that violations of a similar nature would 
result in more serious disciplinary action," the notice said. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Gonzalez was the first witness called in the appeals hearing Wednesday. He 
testified that police were called to the 1700 block of State Street on the 
night of March 25, 1988, to investigate a gang fight and later a drive-by 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned about the incidents, Gonzalez, 35, said, he walked outside his home 
to find out what was happening. He said he spoke briefly to Stovall and his 
partner, Officer Frank Almond Jr. Then suddenly, he said, the officers grabbed 
him and, fearing he would be placed under arrest for no reason, he held onto a 
street sign pole to prevent them from taking him into custody. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when all the problems started," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Almond twisted his arm around the pole, and Stovall stepped in front of 
him. He said Stovall kicked him about six times in the groin. He said Stovall 
thumped him in the side with his baton. And he said Stovall sprayed him in the 
face with Mace. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the reason I let the pole go," Gonzalez said. "My eyes were burning." 
</P>
<P>
He also testified that the officers did not allow him to clean the Mace out of 
his face until he was taken to the central police station 45 minutes later -- 
apparently in violation of the 20-minute limit set by Police Department policy. 
</P>
<P>
Under cross-examination by Stovall's attorney, Everett Bobbitt, Gonzalez said 
he had drunk three or four beers that night and he had been arrested twice 
previously for driving while intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Officer Recalls Threats 
</P>
<P>
He also said he could not remember if Stovall hit him with the baton on his 
right side or his left. And he said that, while he did at first suffer some 
bruises, he later told police investigators that he did not have bruises. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Gonzalez said his wife, Guadalupe Gonzalez, a diabetic, became 
highly emotional during the ordeal, and yelled at the officers to stop hurting 
him. He said she screamed out: "Get the cops' guns!" 
</P>
<P>
Officer Almond, who was not disciplined in the case, testified that he 
remembered Guadalupe Gonzalez threatening him and Stovall. 
</P>
<P>
"She was running around," he said. "She came up on Al a couple of times, 
screaming for us to let him go. She was screaming, 'Take their guns and shoot 
them!' " 
</P>
<P>
Almond also testified that he did not see Stovall kick Gonzalez in the groin. 
"I saw Al raise his knee up a couple of times," he said. "But I couldn't see if 
he was hitting him." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Stovall struck Gonzalez with the baton, Almond said: "No, Al drew 
his baton out and held it up, but then put it back. He didn't have time to 
strike anyone. He never swung and hit him." 
</P>
<P>
Almond also said he believed the Mace used against Gonzalez was an appropriate 
level of force, particularly since the officers at first had reason to believe 
the man may have been responsible for the drive-by shooting in which a door to 
a nearby home was damaged by a shotgun blast. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agreed With Termination 
</P>
<P>
"We were just trying to get Mr. Gonzalez controlled and detained so we could 
talk to him," Almond said. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Pinckard, a deputy city attorney, said he did not believe Gonzalez was 
ever prosecuted in the case, either for the shooting or for resisting arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Ken Moller, one of Stovall's supervisors, said he agreed with the 
termination. He cited Stovall's suspension in November, 1987, for striking a 
citizen with the butt of a shotgun as having a "great bearing" on the officer's 
eventual dismissal in the Gonzalez case. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a serious breach of conduct, in my opinion," Moller testified. "The 
first time, we hit him pretty hard, and I felt the second time we had a 
pattern. And the Police Department cannot afford to permit this kind of 
conduct." 
</P>
<P>
The hearing continues today at City Hall, where Stovall is expected to testify 
in his own defense.

VARIETY OF REASONS DRAW RECRUITS TO FILL POSSIBLE VACANCIES IN DISTRICT 
CLASSROOMS

Douglass E. Bruce has a simple reason for seeking work as a substitute if Los 
Angeles schoolteachers go out on strike next week. "I'm starving," the 
49-year-old unemployed education consultant said. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Wright, a substitute teacher who has worked for years in Norwalk, Downey, 
Little Lake and Whittier schools, is hoping that the Los Angeles Unified School 
District will assign her "a nice school." 
</P>
<P>
"There must be one somewhere. Maybe I'll get lucky," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Gajniak, a former computer salesman who is changing careers, said he wants 
to be a substitute teacher to qualify for an intern program that will enable 
him to gain a full-time credential. 
</P>
<P>
For all these reasons and others, dozens are answering the Los Angeles Unified 
School District's call to work as substitute teachers in case there is a 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
As the strike countdown continues, district administrators have spent more than 
$40,000 on a newspaper advertising campaign to find substitutes. They have 
raised the daily substitute pay from $98.31 to $137.63 and have set up two 
centers to process what they hope soon will be a flood of applications. 
</P>
<P>
The would-be substitutes are already bracing for the invective they know will 
be hurled at them if they cross picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't call me worse than the kids have," Wright said. "You even get some 
grade-oners who will blow your mind." 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-three applicants came to the administration headquarters Wednesday to 
fill out the forms required by the school system. 
</P>
<P>
Wright said she was still in bed in her Santa Fe Springs home Wednesday morning 
when her husband phoned her with news of the school district's job offer. 
Wright, 39, left her daughter with a baby-sitter and set off for district 
headquarters in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Just Might Stay' 
</P>
<P>
Wright hopes that she will be assigned to a school where student discipline is 
not a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"If they give me a nice one, I just might stay," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce, who said he has a Ph.D. from a university in the Philippines, has no 
plans to try for a permanent job with the school system. 
</P>
<P>
"No, no, no, just for temporary," he insisted. "I don't accept the educational 
program in the Los Angeles schools. There is no discipline. I am strictly here 
for the $137.50 per diem." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce said he worked as a full-time teacher in the Los Angeles schools for a 
number of years until 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never been part of the union," Bruce said, adding that he doesn't 
believe in unions and can handle any flak from union activists. "It doesn't 
bother me." 
</P>
<P>
Gajniak, 49, said he had decided about six months ago to switch from a 25-year 
career in the computer industry to teaching. 
</P>
<P>
"I like people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Teaching, he explained, "gives me more satisfaction than working with 
computers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Earn Credential 
</P>
<P>
To make the switch, he has been subbing in the Hart Unified School District in 
Newhall. He was drawn to Los Angeles schools because the strike pay is better 
than he was earning. There also is the chance to get into a two-year district 
intern program that allows people to earn a teaching credential while working 
as a substitute. 
</P>
<P>
Gajniak said he hopes striking teachers will understand his position. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure if I were a regular teacher and the sub needed the income . . . I 
wouldn't object to the sub filling my shoes in my absence," he said. "The main 
thing is the children need to be educated." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Acosta, the administrator in charge of recruitment, said the school 
system will not be hiring permanent replacements for striking teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that is sensitive," he said. "I don't want people to get the impression 
that we are hiring regular teachers." 
</P>
<P>
But Acosta said he does want to hire thousands of substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I sincerely doubt we will get 10,000. I would like to get as many as we can," 
Acosta said. 
</P>
<P>
Union leaders have predicted that a majority of the 32,000 teachers, nurses, 
counselors and librarians will go on strike. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ad Campaign 
</P>
<P>
District personnel specialist Cindy Walden, who is running the advertising 
campaign, said she is not sure how much the district will spend to find 
substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
"We just need to get the word out, and whatever that amount is, is what we will 
pay. That is the bottom line. We have got to staff our schools," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to substitute teachers, as many as 400 school administrators will 
be assigned to classroom teaching in the event of a strike.

TWO YOUTHS ARE SENTENCED FOR ESCONDIDO SCHOOL FIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two of four Escondido high school students involved in four school fires and 
vandalism of a Catholic church were sentenced Wednesday in county Juvenile 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
A boy, soon to be 18, was sentenced to the California Youth Authority for a 
maximum of 10 years, 8 months. But his attorney, Richard E. Mills, said the 
youth will serve about 18 months before his release. 
</P>
<P>
Mills objected to the scheduling of a restitution hearing for the youth on May 
23 as "a waste of time" because the teen-ager would, at best, be able to pay a 
maximum of "a dollar a week from his CYA earnings" toward the estimated $1.2 
million in damage caused at Escondido High School, Orange Glen High School and 
Del Dios Middle School during an arson spree March 10 and 18. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Karen Walter said the youth will probably serve a maximum of 
three years in the Youth Authority because the Juvenile Court loses 
jurisdiction over him on his 21st birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Walter added that she doubts the motive for the four fires and the church 
vandalism will ever be known. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Girl Gets 365 Days 
</P>
<P>
A 16-year-old girl who admitted involvement in two of the four fires was 
sentenced to a maximum of 365 days in the Girls' Rehabilitation Facility on 
Kearny Mesa by Superior Court Judge Hideo Chino. 
</P>
<P>
Her attorney, William Checkley, requested that the girl be given an educational 
aptitude evaluation to determine why she was not doing well in her high school 
courses, and Walter asked that restrictions be imposed on her, including a 
nightly curfew and a ban against her using any fire-starting materials. 
</P>
<P>
Checkley said it was unlikely the girl will be released to her family, noting 
that she has not been visited by any of her relatives since she was placed in 
Juvenile Hall in late March. 
</P>
<P>
Chino continued the sentencing of a third youth, who turns 18 today, until May 
24 after his attorney said that the boy had sought to enter the VisionQuest 
program but was ineligible because of his age. VisionQuest, a juvenile 
rehabilitation program, admits youngsters who will complete the major part of 
their sentences before their 18th birthdays. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth youth, 16, is scheduled to be sentenced May 19. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recovering Arson Losses 
</P>
<P>
Dr. John Cooper, superintendent of the Escondido Union High School District, 
said he expects a joint-powers authority that self-insures the district and 50 
other school districts in San Diego and Imperial counties to join with the 
districts' insurance company to try to recover the arson losses from parents of 
the youths involved. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Nygaard, risk manager for the joint-powers group, said the Escondido high 
school and elementary school districts were responsible for the first $10,000 
of loss and the joint-powers authority is responsible for the next $90,000 from 
the school fires. After the first $100,000 in costs, the joint-powers authority 
and Industrial Indemnity Co. share the next $900,000 in costs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nygaard said that, after the first $1 million in damages is met, the private 
insurance company bears the rest of the burden of the costs. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first "catastrophic loss" that the school districts' self-insurance 
fund has faced in its eight years of existence, Nygaard said. He added that the 
insurance fund accumulated by the districts will cover repair of the three 
schools' fire damages. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course," he added, "our premiums are probably going to go up." 
</P>
<P>
He added that the joint-powers authority has made no decision on whether to 
pursue recovery of the costs from the parents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Insurance Carriers Could Sue 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, the Juvenile Court could order each family of the four 
teen-agers to pay up to $17,500 for "willful misconduct" resulting in damage to 
the schools. Also, the insurance carriers could sue to recover additional civil 
damages from the families. 
</P>
<P>
The fires included one at an Escondido High portable classroom building March 
10 in which two of the boys participated. Damage was estimated at about 
$55,000. On March 18, a fire at Escondido High caused more than $800,000 damage 
to the building housing the cafeteria, kitchen for all the high schools, and 
the school drama department and theater. 
</P>
<P>
On the same night, a fire destroyed two classrooms and severely damaged others 
in a $250,000 blaze at Orange Glen, and a $30,000 fire damaged two classrooms 
and a storeroom at Del Dios Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
At the Church of the Resurrection, the sanctuary was broken into in 
mid-February, crosses on the premises were overturned and other damage was 
done. No estimate of loss has been made public.

SON'S LAWSUIT AGAINST SOL PRICE IS THROWN OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Arthur W. Jones on Wednesday threw out the $100-million 
emotional-distress lawsuit filed against multimillionaire Sol Price by his 
estranged son, Laurence, who claimed that his father was cruel, cold and 
domineering. 
</P>
<P>
After seven days of trial and bitter, searingly personal testimony, Jones said 
that Sol Price, 73, had been "reasonable" in the raising of Laurence, 43, who, 
evidence showed, was a difficult child and still has serious emotional 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Laurence had claimed that he was deeply hurt when his father refused to attend 
a bar mitzvah party -- a key issue in the case -- but Jones ruled that Sol 
Price had a First Amendment right not to go. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No 'Outrageous' Acts 
</P>
<P>
The dismissal came after Laurence's lawyer, Marvin Mitchelson, rested his case. 
Jones ruled that Mitchelson had shown no evidence that Sol Price had committed 
any "outrageous" acts and, therefore, there were no issues for the jury to 
consider. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Gerald McMahon, Sol Price's lawyer, announced that Price had decided to 
drop his counterclaim for $2.2 million in loans for which his son had failed to 
repay him. 
</P>
<P>
At issue in the ruling was an incident that occurred Jan. 24, 1987, when Sol 
Price arrived a few minutes late for the bar mitzvah of his grandson Benjamin, 
Laurence's child. Sol Price stayed in the back of the hall during the ceremony 
and did not attend the party afterward. 
</P>
<P>
The incident, a relatively minor event in the stormy history of one of 
California's wealthiest families, emerged this week as the crux of a novel 
lawsuit brought by Laurence Price. He claimed that the behavior of his father, 
founder of the Price Club discount warehouses, caused him such severe emotional 
distress that he should be awarded $100 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Nothing Else to Say' 
</P>
<P>
"It was a personal matter. It never should have been in court," Sol Price said 
Wednesday, his eyes brimming with tears. "There's nothing else to say." 
</P>
<P>
A few yards away, his son chatted with reporters and declared himself the 
winner because now "it was out and people knew it, and my family knew it, and 
they heard it from other people -- the truth about what happened with the kids, 
about what my father has done. That's a victory." He said he thinks it unlikely 
that the family rift can be healed anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
The question of whether such family disputes should be decided by the courts 
was at the center of Jones' ruling Wednesday. A difference of opinion over 
"social graces really should not be the subject of a legal action," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchelson, who set a precedent with the first successful "palimony" case a 
decade ago, said the Price litigation was a "cutting-edge case" because few 
emotional-distress cases are brought against family members. "We feel there are 
certain rights of children to sue their parents under these circumstances," he 
said. Mitchelson said no decision has been made on whether to file an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suit Filed in 1987 
</P>
<P>
Laurence Price filed the lawsuit, alleging intentional and negligent infliction 
of emotional distress, on Dec. 1, 1987, after losing a legal battle to retain 
leases for lucrative tire-installation centers attached to the Price Club 
discount warehouses his father started in 1976. Sol Price had arranged for 
Laurence to own and operate the centers in 1978 after Laurence, a high school 
dropout, had been out of work for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Sol Price and other officials of the Price Club testified that they decided to 
cancel Laurence's leases for the business, worth about $3.7 million, because he 
was mismanaging it and was extremely difficult to deal with, even on the most 
routine business matters. 
</P>
<P>
But, in testimony, Laurence Price claimed that his father ordered the leases 
canceled because he would not accede to his father's demand that he return his 
two sons to their mother, who had won custody in a divorce proceeding. During 
the seven days of trial this month, Laurence alleged that his father had always 
been cold and cruel. 
</P>
<P>
A psychologist testified that Laurence was so disturbed by his father's 
behavior that he could commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Laurence also complained of other incidents over the years that he believed 
were attempts by his father to inflict pain on him and alienate him from his 
sons. Once, he said, his father took his son Jonas on a trip to see the campus 
of Stanford University without notifying Laurence, and the father helped Jonas 
buy a car without consulting him, Laurence said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Statute of Limitations 
</P>
<P>
However, the only action that occurred within the year before the filing of the 
suit was the bar mitzvah incident, making it the only incident covered by 
California's statute of limitations on emotional-distress claims. 
</P>
<P>
In his ruling Wednesday, Jones said that, far from being cruel, Sol Price had 
taken a "reasonable" approach to the raising of his emotionally troubled son. 
Sol Price had tried "the soft line, the hard line and the middle line," Jones 
said. "You get into the considerations, 'Am I indulgent enough or too 
indulgent?' There are no answers to these questions." 
</P>
<P>
After the decision Wednesday, McMahon told reporters that Sol Price and his 
wife, Helen, "didn't want to be here in the first place. We tried in many ways 
and on many occasions to resolve this matter. He (Sol) could have foreseen the 
outcome and wanted to protect Larry from it." 
</P>
<P>
Evidence at the trial showed that Sol Price had helped Laurence financially 
with loans and gifts for most of his lifetime. Nevertheless, the two rarely got 
along. 
</P>
<P>
Sol Price testified that he believes he "spoiled" Laurence and that he bears 
the blame for his son's behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Larry feels that the world owes him a living," Sol Price testified. 
"He certainly is a person who wants a lot of benefits and no burdens. I think 
he's spoiled." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Jurors Sympathetic 
</P>
<P>
Several of the jurors expressed sympathy for Laurence Price in interviews 
Wednesday, but said they were unsure how they would have voted. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt sorry for Laurence, but not that sorry," said Julia L. James, an 
instructional aide at El Cajon High School. "I think he could have been more 
conciliatory. I felt that, if Laurence had wanted to, and felt a little empathy 
for his dad, they could probably have gotten together." 
</P>
<P>
Of Sol Price, she said: "He was the tough old patriarch of the family. He had 
the money, he had the business, but, golly, he has feelings too." 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Romo-Dutra, another juror, said she did not know what her decision might 
have been because the jury had not yet been instructed in the applicable law. 
However, she said: "I feel really sorry for Larry. I think he's a wonderful 
person. . . . I think he was deprived of the thing he needed most -- love and 
affection." 
</P>
<P>
Juror Lynda L. Breunig said she took an informal poll after the case was thrown 
out Wednesday and found that "there was an awful lot of emotion for Larry." 
</P>
<P>
However, she said: "The main thread that was running through the opinions I got 
was that there wasn't enough there to make an award of that amount."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN KILLS ANOTHER FAST-FOOD CUSTOMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An apparently mentally unstable man finished a cup of coffee at a McDonald's 
restaurant in Mission Hills on Wednesday, got a gun from his car, then walked 
back inside and shot another customer to death for no apparent reason, Los 
Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Pak, 43, calmly left the restaurant after the 6:05 a.m. shooting in the 
11000 block of Sepulveda Boulevard and drove away in his car, police said. He 
was arrested a few minutes later at his nearby Granada Hills home after police 
traced the license plate number provided by employees of the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Police identified the victim as Edward Capannelli, 60, of Van Nuys. Detectives 
said that he did not know Pak and that there was no apparent motive for the 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said Pak's relatives told them that in February he had been treated 
at a local hospital for a mental disorder but recently stopped taking 
prescribed medication.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CLIPPERS' OWNER WANTS NEW STADIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The owner of the Los Angeles Clippers basketball franchise, Donald T. Sterling, 
said Wednesday after a meeting with Mayor Tom Bradley and Coliseum Commission 
President Richard Riordan that unless an $85-million new indoor arena is built 
to replace the Sports Arena, the Clippers will move to "a new facility 
elsewhere in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Sterling did not specify which site he had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Riordan said he and the mayor had shown Sterling a new remodeling 
plan for the Sports Arena that was less expensive than those previously 
developed. Riordan characterized the meeting, which took place in Sterling's 
Beverly Hills office, as an informal exchange of views. 
</P>
<P>
The Coliseum Commission has been trying to get Sterling to sign a new, 30-year 
lease for the Sports Arena. Promoters of a proposed new indoor arena in Anaheim 
have also held discussions with Sterling.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DELAY ON CITYHOOD ACTION SPARKS ANGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angry Malibu residents screamed at Local Agency Formation Commission members 
Wednesday after the panel voted to delay action on the community's 
incorporation request for one week. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly two dozen Malibu residents had pleaded earlier with the panel to spare 
the community further delays and give residents a chance to vote on cityhood. 
After LAFCO approved in August a previous cityhood application for Malibu, a 
Los Angeles Superior Court judge rescinded the action and ordered an 
environmental impact report on the impact of cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
However, a majority of commissioners agreed with LAFCO member and county 
Supervisor Ed Edelman, who said that postponing a vote on Malibu's 
incorporation proposal one week would not harm the chances of placing the issue 
before voters later this year.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIGHT FOR ABANDONED NEWBORN BOY ENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A newborn boy abandoned three months ago in an automobile in Covina who was the 
focus of a struggle between two prospective adoptive families has been placed 
with an unidentified couple who have been waiting nine years for a white 
infant. 
</P>
<P>
Catherine Tracy, chief deputy for the Los Angeles County Department of 
Children's Services, said the infant's temporary foster mother obeyed a court 
order and surrendered him earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
She had gone into hiding with the baby last week after learning that 
authorities planned to place the infant with another family. 
</P>
<P>
The temporary foster mother and another distraught couple -- who said they had 
seen him daily and become attached to him despite his health problems as a drug 
baby -- had asked for a court hearing. However, a court commissioner declined 
to listen to their arguments, Tracy said, ruling that they had no legal 
standing to address the court.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ACTIVIST POLICEMAN GRANTED DISABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Calling self-styled activist Don Jackson "psychologically unfit" to return to 
his job as a sergeant with the Hawthorne Police Department, city officials 
announced Wednesday he will be granted a disability retirement. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by City Manager R. Kenneth Jue comes more than two years after 
Jackson, 31, was placed on temporary disability leave after his allegations of 
racism against Hawthorne police. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson gained national attention in January when a television camera crew 
filmed him as he was apparently pushed through a plate glass window by a 
policeman during a "sting" operation designed to uncover abuse in the Long 
Beach Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
His retirement will be retroactive to Feb. 3, the date of a psychiatrist's 
report that recommended that he be removed from the force, said Doug Gates, 
Hawthorne's employee relations officer. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson will receive $2,120 a month, 50% of his sergeant's pay, from the state 
Public Employees Retirement System, Gates said. Jackson had received $960 a 
month in temporary disability pay. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very relieved," Jackson said Wednesday. "It's been a burden economically 
as well as mentally."

FEE FOR BUILDING HOMES GOES UP 136% IN TORRANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With little debate, the Torrance City Council has approved a 136% increase in 
taxes and fees on all new residential units to pay for parks and recreation. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 5 to 1 to establish a new $750 fee for park rehabilitation 
and open space preservation, on top of an existing $550 park and recreation 
facilities tax, for a total of $1,300. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Objection to Fee 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bill Applegate objected to the new fee, saying it was a back-door 
method of raising taxes. "The reason for calling it a fee is so we don't have 
to go to the people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under Proposition 13, cities are required to obtain voter approval for any 
increase in special taxes dedicated to a specific purpose. Consequently, the 
existing park and recreation tax could not be increased without a vote. 
</P>
<P>
But a new state law allows cities to establish new fees if a direct 
relationship can be shown between the fee and public improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"We're using a loophole in the law to increase taxes," Applegate said. 
</P>
<P>
However, after the votes were counted and the fee had been approved, Applegate 
joined his colleagues in voting for a separate implementing ordinance. "I lost 
my battle so I just voted for it," Applegate said. "It was a done deal." 
</P>
<P>
If a builder refuses to pay the park fee, the ordinance provides for a new $750 
general tax on new residential units. Both the fee and the tax will be adjusted 
annually based on inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The money must be paid before a building permit is issued. 
</P>
<P>
The tax is permitted under state law because it would be used for general 
operations rather than a specific purpose. City officials were concerned that 
the fee might be subject to a legal challenge and enacted the tax as a backup. 
</P>
<P>
The tax or fee applies to each new single-family home, apartment, duplex, 
condominium, motel unit and any rebuilding project that increases the total 
floor area of a dwelling by more than 85%. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Katy Geissert said the alternative to imposing the fee is "doing nothing 
and letting our parks deteriorate." 
</P>
<P>
Geissert said population increases will create a need for more parks in 
Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
A detailed report, outlining the basis for the fee, notes that historically 
Torrance has provided 2.5 acres of developed park and recreation facilities for 
every 1,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
Based on projections of 5,100 new residents by 2010, the report said Torrance 
would need to develop 12.75 acres of undeveloped park land and open space and 
to restore and renovate existing parks and facilities that are suffering from 
deterioration or overuse. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the new $750 fee would be devoted to acquisition and 
rehabilitation purposes, such as replacement of worn-out equipment. Funds 
raised from the $550 tax are devoted exclusively to capital projects such as 
acquisition of parkland and construction of buildings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parks Expenditures Curtailed 
</P>
<P>
But Torrance's capital expenditures for parks have been curtailed because the 
city borrowed the entire balance of $1.75 million in park funds to help repair 
a major landslide on the north face of the Palos Verdes Peninsula. So far 
$200,000 of the loan has been repaid. 
</P>
<P>
"We would be in a much stronger position relative to our capital needs if the 
funds had not been loaned out," said Torrance Parks and Recreation Director 
Gene Barnett. "We are anticipating that will be paid back. We don't know when 
that will happen." 
</P>
<P>
He said improvements to Madrona Marsh and the former Greenwood school site have 
been delayed because the money is no longer available. 
</P>
<P>
Barnett said the fee was proposed because the $550 tax, last raised in 1975, is 
not keeping pace with inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the rise in the Consumer Price Index since 1975, Torrance Revenue 
Officer Ben Murdoch said, the tax should be about $1,300 today.

1-DAY ANAHEIM TEACHER STRIKE CALLED A SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN and MARCIDA DODSON, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anaheim Union High School District teachers declared their one-day strike a 
success after nearly 80% of the district's 900 instructors walked out and 
almost half of the students skipped classes Wednesday, crippling intermediate 
and secondary schools from Anaheim to Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
The strike, the first ever for members of the Anaheim Secondary Teachers Assn., 
forced the district to dispatch about 600 substitute teachers to its 21 
campuses where 665 regularly assigned teachers failed to appear. Administrators 
said 46% of the district's 20,000 students were truant, but students and 
teachers on the picket lines and at a noon rally reported that attendance 
dwindled even further as the day went on. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inconveniences Noted 
</P>
<P>
While a district spokesman assured parents that students were being properly 
supervised, administrators agreed that the strike over stalled salary 
negotiations had created significant inconveniences to the financially troubled 
district, which serves most of Anaheim, as well as Cypress and La Palma. 
</P>
<P>
The mood on the teachers' picket lines was buoyant as teachers reveled in the 
strike turnout. About 82% of teachers belonging to the association had voted to 
strike for one day after salary negotiations with district administration 
reached an impasse. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers are willing to settle for the offer the district has made for this 
school year, which could mean only a 1% pay raise. The point of contention is 
next year's salary. Teachers are demanding a 3.2% increase, equal to the 
state's projected inflation rate, plus a portion of the surplus after a 3% 
reserve is set aside. 
</P>
<P>
District officials, saying shrinking enrollment and rising costs have led to 
budget deficits, do not want to guarantee any increase.

CONTROVERSIAL REZONING OF PCH STRIP OKD BY LOMITA PLANNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposed ordinance to rezone a mile-long corridor of Pacific Coast Highway in 
Lomita was approved unanimously Tuesday by the city's Planning Commission, 
despite opposition from residents who say the change will force out small 
businesses and dramatically increase traffic. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 residents crammed the council chambers to voice opposition to the 
ordinance, which would prohibit or restrict a variety of businesses, including 
small motels, nail shops, auto repair shops and liquor stores. Churches would 
be prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, which will come before the City Council next month, would 
require commercial lots to be at least 100 feet wide and at least 10,000 square 
feet. New motels would have to be 50 units or larger and liquor stores would 
have to be at least 1,500 feet apart. 
</P>
<P>
The issues -- including a moratorium on new development on the Pacific Coast 
Highway while the ordinance is studied -- have galvanized many residents and 
business owners in the normally quiet community of 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Protect Lomita' Stickers 
</P>
<P>
Residents have plastered the neighborhood with literature opposing the 
ordinance, and at Tuesday's hearing opponents distributed stickers that read 
"Protect Lomita!" 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the ordinance argue that if it is passed, it will alter 
irrevocably the city's small-town character. 
</P>
<P>
Resident Toni King, whose family has lived in Lomita since 1938, told the 
commission they have remained "because we like the small-town atmosphere. We 
like dealing with the shopkeepers and with the personal, customized service 
they give us." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents also argued that the ordinance would lower property values and that 
the value of businesses on nonconforming lots would decrease. Several business 
owners also said they are concerned that traffic congestion will drive away 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials say the ordinance is a good way to tighten control over 
hodgepodge development along Pacific Coast Highway, increase the city's tax 
base and maintain the city's services and infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what we do, traffic (on Pacific Coast Highway) will be horribly 
impacted by the year 2000," Commissioner Dave Wilkinson said. "There's nothing 
your city Planning Commission can do about that. It's a fact of life we're 
impacted by our neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
33,500 Cars a Day 
</P>
<P>
According to state Department of Transportation figures for 1986 -- the most 
recent available -- about 33,500 cars a day pass through Lomita on Pacific 
Coast Highway. If the ordinance is approved and more retail businesses are 
allowed in the 19-acre area affected by the ordinance, that figure would 
increase between 18% and 54% over a 20-year period, according to a traffic 
study conducted for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Members of a residents' group,Citizens for a Better Lomita, disputed those 
figures, contending they are too low. Mark Hays, an organizer of the citizens' 
group, said a summary of the study misinterprets a chart on traffic generated 
by various businesses. 
</P>
<P>
He also criticized former Lawndale City Manager Paul Philips, head of Planning 
and Research Associates, the Manhattan Beach firm that conducted the study. He 
said Philips is unqualified to do the study because he is not a traffic 
engineer and because of his job history in Lawndale and South El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
Philips was fired as city manager of South El Monte in 1981 after he applied 
for another job in violation of a clause in his contract. In 1987, Philips 
resigned under fire as Lawndale city manager following council criticism of his 
job performance and alleged irregularities in the Planning Department. 
</P>
<P>
However, City Administrator Walker J. Ritter defended the report. 
</P>
<P>
"It's what we asked for," Ritter said. "All we wanted was an idea of the impact 
on traffic the change in the zoning would have." 
</P>
<P>
The citizens group has also criticized a City Council decision in April to 
exempt a Torrance developer from the building moratorium. The council approved 
an ordinance allowing developer Norman La Caze to build a 30,000-square-foot 
shopping center on the northeast corner of Pacific Coast Highway and Eshelman 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to Ritter earlier this month, the citizens' group 
challenged the legality of the exemption, arguing that it was passed in 
violation of the state Government Code. The city had initially introduced the 
measure as an urgency ordinance, but a shorter version was passed as a regular 
ordinance without proper public notification, the letter claimed. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Leland Dolley said the council introduced the ordinance for a first 
reading and subsequently went through the usual process for notice. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion the city has acted in a proper manner and the challenge is 
without merit," Dolley said. 
</P>
<P>
An adversarial tone between opponents of the ordinance and city officials was 
set before Tuesday's meeting, during an exchange between Hays and Ritter. 
</P>
<P>
As Hays addressed a group of about 50 residents assembled in the council 
chambers 30 minutes before the commission meeting began, Ritter interrupted and 
asked to speak with Hays privately. But Hays refused and the group adjourned en 
masse to the City Hall courtyard to continue its discussion. 
</P>
<P>
The group returned to the council chambers shortly before the Planning 
Commission meeting began.

FOES OF MIRALESTE CLOSURE HAIL RULING; 
</P>
<P>
APPEALS COURT SAYS DISTRICT MUST WEIGH ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An appeals court has ruled that the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School 
District must consider the potential environmental effects before it can close 
Miraleste High School. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, issued Tuesday by the 2nd District Court of Appeal in Los 
Angeles, upholds a May, 1988, ruling by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Miriam 
Vogel. The appellate ruling was hailed by a parents group as an important 
victory in their efforts to prevent the school board from closing the 
under-enrolled campus on the east side of the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Detrimental Effect' 
</P>
<P>
"We are elated that the appeal court understood and agreed . . . that closing 
Miraleste would have a highly detrimental effect on the safety and education of 
the children involved," Donna Perrin, president of the East Peninsula Education 
Council, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
However, the parents group, which has been fighting for more than two years to 
preserve the neighborhood high school, faces another hurdle. While waiting for 
the results of the appeal, the school board has been preparing an environmental 
impact report that could meet the requirements set by Vogel's order. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Jack Price said Wednesday that "it is unlikely but possible" that 
Miraleste will be closed this fall. He said "a lot depends" on when the 
environmental review process is completed. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel ruled that despite a 1983 law that generally exempts school districts 
from filing environmental reports when they close schools, the peninsula 
district must consider the potential cumulative effect of multiple school 
closings on the east side. 
</P>
<P>
Her ruling barred the school board from carrying out its November, 1987, 
decision to close Miraleste as part of a money-saving plan to consolidate the 
district's 9,800 students on campuses in the central and west side of the 
peninsula. Five other campuses on the east side have been closed in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Mahr, a spokeswoman for the peninsula school system, said the district 
based its appeal on the 1983 legislation that exempted school districts from 
requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act. She said it appeared 
unlikely that the peninsula board would carry its appeal to the state Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
The clear purpose of the 1983 law, she said, was to allow districts with 
declining enrollments to close surplus schools without going through the 
lengthy and costly process of preparing environmental reports. 
</P>
<P>
However, in a unanimous decision, the three-member panel of appellate judges 
focused on a related law that deals with the environmental consequences of 
transferring substantial numbers of students within a school district. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Safety Issue Cited 
</P>
<P>
About a thousand intermediate and high school students would be reassigned to 
campuses in the central and western parts of the peninsula if Miraleste closes. 
The parents group has contended that the safety and quality of education of 
east-side students would be endangered by daily commuting over the peninsula's 
rough terrain on winding roads. 
</P>
<P>
The group has rejected several compromise proposals by the school board, 
including a plan to preserve the Miraleste campus by converting it to a middle 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that the appeal process is over, we're hopeful that the school board will 
work with us in maintaining a quality, K-12 education program on the east 
side," said Ted Gibbs, a spokesman for the Miraleste parents group. "If they 
are not, then we will continue our efforts to form our own school district." 
</P>
<P>
Those efforts are stalled in Sacramento until the State Board of Education 
rules on the group's petition to secede. The agency was scheduled to take up 
the issue earlier this year but decided to wait until Gov. George Deukmejian 
fills four vacancies on the 11-member board. 
</P>
<P>
Mahr said a consultant is expected to present an environmental impact report to 
the peninsula school board at its June 5 meeting. That will be followed by a 
45-day period for public hearings, then two weeks more for the consultant to 
prepare the final report, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The school board could then declare that it has met the requirements set by 
Vogel and proceed with its plans to close Miraleste.

CAR STEREO SHOP FIRE CAUSES $1-MILLION LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fire swept through an auto stereo and alarm installation shop in Reseda on 
Wednesday, causing about $1 million in damage, mostly to equipment and cars 
inside the business, the Los Angeles Fire Department said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire at SNA Auto Sound Design in the 18500 block of Topham Street was 
reported at 4 a.m., said Jim Wells, department spokesman. About 40 firefighters 
controlled the fire in about half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time we got there, the flames were already through the roof," Wells 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The shop was in a 5,000-square-foot, one-story warehouse in an area where 
several other automotive businesses operate. An adjoining repair shop was 
undamaged by the fire and opened for business Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The fire gutted the SNA shop and destroyed or damaged 20 cars, including 
several Mercedes-Benzes and Porsches parked inside awaiting installation work, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the blaze was not known, and fire investigators from the 
department and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms spent much of 
Wednesday picking through the rubble and shells of burned cars looking for 
clues. 
</P>

Wells said ATF experts are routinely called in to help determine the cause of 
fires in which there are large losses. Officials estimated the SNA losses at 
$150,000 in damage to the structure and $850,000 to the cars and stereo 
equipment.

WRIGHT'S DEALINGS WITH PUBLIC OFFICIALS LISTED;

<P>
D.A.'S REPORT OUTLINES ATTEMPTS TO INTERVENE WITH JUDGES, SIMI VALLEY POLICE 
CHIEF AND DMV 
</P>

Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury released the findings Wednesday 
of a 10-week investigation by his office of reports that Assemblywoman Cathie 
Wright (R-Simi Valley) used her clout to keep her frequently ticketed daughter 
behind the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
The 97-page report asserted that Wright "has demonstrated a clear pattern of 
attempting to obtain special treatment for herself and her daughter with the 
police, the courts and the Department of Motor Vehicles." 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury's office found that Wright improperly intervened to keep her daughter, 
Victoria, from losing her driver's license or going to jail as the result of 28 
traffic violations since 1981. Nevertheless, he said, the inquiry "found no 
clear-cut criminal violations that would warrant prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Wright responded that "in spite of the amount of time, 
energy and countless tax dollars he spent trying to find something illegal, he 
found nothing." She said the inquiry by fellow Republican Bradbury was 
politically motivated and called his report "shameful." Her statement did not 
address most of the specific allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Following is a thumbnail chronology of the report's account of Wright's efforts 
on behalf of herself and her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 8, 1978: Wright, then a Simi Valley city councilwoman, persuaded Simi 
Valley police to void a traffic ticket that she received. Wright refused to 
sign a citation for driving without her headlights on at night and demanded 
that the watch commander be called. Sgt. William Schwartz subsequently decided 
to void the citation "due to the possible problems that Wright could make 
during the negotiation process," the report states. The police union was 
engaged in salary negotiations with the council at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 6, 1983: Wright unsuccessfully tried to fix a parking ticket with Simi 
Valley police. "You know what to do with this," she told the watch commander 
when she left the ticket at the police desk. It was returned to her to be paid. 
</P>
<P>
March 14, 1988: Wright called a deputy district attorney, who was the 
prosecutor that day of charges against Victoria for speeding and driving 
without a license. Wright identified herself as an Assembly member and said she 
hoped that Victoria would not be sent to jail, which would cost her daughter 
her job. 
</P>
<P>
March 28, 1988: Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) called Ventura 
County Municipal Judge Herbert Curtis III shortly before Curtis was to hear 
Victoria Wright's misdemeanor case for driving without a license. Curtis, a 
Democrat, said Brown identified himself as a close friend of Cathie Wright and 
said that Ventura County judges were too tough on traffic offenders and that 
Victoria did not deserve to go to jail. 
</P>
<P>
May 18, 1988: Wright asked Simi Valley Police Chief Lindsey P. Miller to "take 
back" a speeding ticket that Victoria had received. When he declined, she asked 
whether he could have the officer who issued the ticket call in sick at the 
time of the trial, thereby dismissing the charge. Miller refused. A year 
earlier, Wright had voted for a law that made it a crime for police chiefs to 
destroy a ticket before it is filed with the court. 
</P>
<P>
June 6, 1988, or Sept. 7, 1988: Wright asked Miller to void one of Victoria's 
traffic citations. Again, he refused. 
</P>
<P>
June 13, 1988: Wright represented her daughter at a DMV license suspension 
hearing in Sacramento. Her request that her daughter be given a license 
restricted to driving to and from work was denied. At this point, Victoria had 
25 moving violations since 1981, five in the past eight months. 
</P>
<P>
June 15, 1988: Wright asked Miller to intercede with a judge assigned to hear 
Victoria's traffic case. Miller declined. 
</P>
<P>
June 26, 1988: Wright visited Municipal Judge Bruce Clark at his home and 
discussed two speeding citations for Victoria that were pending before Clark. 
The next day, Clark entered a decision to dismiss both citations in exchange 
for Victoria attending traffic school -- even though county policy was to 
dismiss only one violation every 12 months for traffic school. 
</P>
<P>
July 8, 1988: Prompted by a letter from Wright to DMV Director A. A. (Del) 
Pierce, a veteran DMV administrator was sent from Sacramento to Van Nuys to 
hold a hearing for Victoria. Despite calling her record "horrendous," the 
administrator revoked the suspension and granted her a restricted license to 
allow her to drive to and from work. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 3 or 4, 1988: Wright told Simi Valley City Manager Lin Koester that Simi 
Valley police were "picking on my daughter." Koester then contacted Miller, who 
said "there was no indication" that individual officers or the department was 
singling out Victoria. Koester informed Cathie Wright of that and told her that 
"Victoria's driving posed a danger to herself and others." 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 6, 1988: Wright visited Ventura County Municipal Commissioner John Paventi 
at his home to discuss additional traffic citations that Victoria had received. 
Paventi, who had been advised by a Simi Valley police officer about Wright's 
intercession on her daughter's behalf with others, secretly tape-recorded the 
conversation. Wright said she was trying to keep Victoria from losing her 
license or going to jail, according to Paventi. He subsequently disqualified 
himself from the case.

P.V. ESTATES SHOULD KEEP VAN SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the voters of Los Angeles County endorsed Proposition A several years ago, 
they voted to tax themselves to provide funding not only for mass transit but 
also for local public transportation. Subsequently the cities of Rancho Palos 
Verdes, Rolling Hills Estates and Palos Verdes Estates joined together to use 
this local funding for P.V. Transit, an innovative, flexible van system which, 
from the beginning, has had heavy use. 
</P>
<P>
Presently, the city of Palos Verdes Estates is considering withdrawing from the 
P.V. Transit agreement, which, if it comes to pass, will make its citizens 
ineligible to use the service. It is legitimate for any city to trade away its 
transportation funds to another city; however, in that trade it gets only 50 
cents on every dollar and thus the city is trading away its own citizens' tax 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The League of Women Voters supported Proposition A and has consistently 
supported cooperative arrangements among the peninsula's local jurisdictions. 
Usage shows that the need for transportation is there. Local tax dollars are 
paying for it, which implies a responsibility for local government to provide 
the service. The league urges Palos Verdes Estates to continue to provide its 
residents with transportation service and we urge the three cities to work 
together to resolve any perceived problems.

FLOYD PRAISED FOR LAND BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I wish to commend Assemblyman Dick Floyd (D-Carson) for coming to the 
assistance of the Holly Glen Community in Hawthorne. He has introduced Assembly 
Bill 702, a bill requiring Caltrans (the state Department of Transportation) to 
sell surplus property known as "the Glasgow Strip" to the city of Hawthorne for 
development as a public park. Caltrans has allowed the Glasgow Strip, between 
the 405 Freeway and a residential area, to become an eyesore. As grateful as I 
am to Floyd, I am equally appalled that the Republican assemblymen on the 
Transportation Committee voted as a bloc against the citizens of Hawthorne when 
AB 702 came before the committee on May, 1. These Republicans have sided with 
Caltrans in its effort to subvert the city of Hawthorne's right and duty to 
govern the city and to promote the best interests of its citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The Glasgow Strip has been zoned urban open space since 1983. For six years 
Hawthorne has attempted to purchase the Glasgow Strip from Caltrans. 
Unfortunately, the city was forced to request the legislation in AB 702 because 
Caltrans would not conduct good-faith negotiations. Contrary to current law, 
Caltrans refuses to sell the property at "fair market value." Instead, Caltrans 
insists this property be appraised as residential, in violation of both the 
city's General Plan and the zoning that has been in effect for six years. This 
would result in a windfall for Caltrans and a hardship for Hawthorne and its 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
I understand the need for freeways, but I don't agree that Caltrans should make 
windfall profits by the disruption necessitated by freeway development. 
Hawthorne is attempting to improve through acquisition of open space, but 
Caltrans, acting from Sacramento, is trying to impose its will contrary to 
Hawthorne's General Plan and zoning ordinances. It distresses me that our 
Republican assemblymen would side with Caltrans against the residents of 
Hawthorne. I think we deserve better than this.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL APPROVES GENERAL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hawthorne City Council voted 4 to 0 Monday to give final approval to an 
updated General Plan that calls for commercial development near the I-105 
freeway. The area, the Imperial Highway Corridor, contains a mix of residential 
and commercial uses. 
</P>
<P>
The General Plan is a document that will be used to govern all future zoning 
for the city. 
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of the completion of the freeway in 1993, several developers 
have already expressed an interest in commercial projects there. The city could 
begin the redevelopment process in the area as soon as next year, according to 
Bud Cormier, assistant redevelopment director. 
</P>
<P>
At hearings on the updated plan, residents expressed concern that if 
development did not occur for several years, their properties would be left in 
limbo until the city had a development proposal in hand. 
</P>
<P>
But the council, in a 4-0 vote giving initial approval April 24, said that 
because development is imminent, residents are likely to benefit financially 
from an increase in property values in the area. City consultants and others 
said that, in general, commercial property is more valuable than residential 
because it can be more intensely developed.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SANTEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman who escaped from the Las Colinas jail was caught when she returned to 
claim $10 from jail officials, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Lou Nelson, 31, of Spring Valley escaped Monday when she posed as another 
prisoner, Mary Kay Winberg, 29, who was supposed to be released on her own 
recognizance. Nelson allegedly changed into Winberg's clothing and was able to 
answer personal questions that should have been known only by Winberg, a 
sheriff's deputy said. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, who was in jail for embezzlement, was captured when she returned to the 
jail to claim $10 owed to Winberg. 
</P>
<P>
Winberg was rebooked for conspiracy and aiding and abetting an escape. Both 
women could receive additional sentences of two to six years in the escape, 
said Sgt. Ron Cottingham of the Sheriff's Department.

<P>
Two pedestrians were killed Wednesday when they were struck by the driver of a 
pickup truck who lost control while exiting Interstate 5 onto Pershing Drive, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Dead at the scene were James Lawton Cook Jr., 36, of San Diego, and Albert 
Nolan Badon, 41, of Santa Ana, a deputy coroner said. 
</P>
<P>
Both men were walking along Pershing Drive just after 1:30 a.m. when the 
truck's driver, Melvin C. Jones, left the northbound I-5 off-ramp onto 
eastbound Pershing, swerved and hit them, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones' truck then crossed the center divider and westbound lanes of Pershing 
Drive before hitting an embankment, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, 37, was taken to UC San Diego Medical Center, where he was treated and 
released, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the district attorney's office is reviewing the case.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: QUARRY CAN COMPACT ITS FILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rolling Hills Estates City Council will permit Chandler's Palos Verdes Sand 
and Gravel to begin compacting fill at its 120-acre quarry near Palos Verdes 
Drive East and the Lomita city limit. But in the face of overwhelming 
opposition from residents across from the quarry, the council decided Tuesday 
not to approve Chandler's plans for a golf driving range there. 
</P>
<P>
While residents said they do not want to stop Chandler's from building the golf 
range, they want it located away from the street so homes will not be affected 
by noise and lights. 
</P>
<P>
John Robertson, Chandler's general manager, said the company has no timetable 
for compacting the inert materials that are dumped into the quarry landfill, 
but wants permission because compacting "gives more options for future use" of 
the quarry pit once it is filled. Compaction is required before buildings may 
be placed on the fill. 
</P>
<P>
On the golf-range use permit, the council indicated it would like Chandler's 
and the residents to agree to a plan that would be resubmitted. 
</P>
<P>
Residents also used the hearing to object to dust and noise from the "batch 
plant" which is part of the ready-mix concrete operations. Robertson said the 
company would reduce plant noise -- which the city said exceeds legal noise 
levels -- by moving the plant if necessary.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MURDER SOLICITATION CHARGES DISMISSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charges against a Canoga Park insurance agent accused of soliciting the murder 
of a client were dropped after the "star witness" in the case confessed that he 
had committed perjury, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Judith C. Chirlin on Tuesday dismissed the 
murder solicitation charge against Esmail Shokri, 34, at the request of Deputy 
Dist. Atty. John C. Spence. 
</P>
<P>
Shokri was accused of soliciting the murder of Iranian national Farhang 
Goudarzi, 38, of Woodland Hills, who twice in January, 1988, had cars he was 
driving damaged by bombs. Shokri was accused of offering Afshin Rahmani, 23, of 
Encino a cut of an insurance policy on Goudarzi if Rahmani killed him. 
</P>
<P>
Rahmani contacted authorities in March, 1988, and agreed to cooperate, later 
testifying against Shokri during a preliminary hearing in August. But Spence 
said that earlier this year, Rahmani went to the office of Shokri's attorney 
and admitted during a taped interview that he had lied during the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Although Rahmani later claimed that he had not committed perjury, "his entire 
credibility is highly suspect," Spence said. "We did not feel we had a provable 
case with him." 
</P>
<P>
Spence said his office is considering filing a perjury charge against Rahmani, 
who Monday faces sentencing on an auto theft conviction in Van Nuys earlier 
this year.

BOL HAS BECOME A TOWER OF POWER IN OAKLAND SKYLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
OAKLAND 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manute Bol, then a Dinka tribesman in the African nation of Sudan, visited a 
city for the first time in 1979, traveling to the southern town of Waw. When 
gawkers teased him about his height, Bol threw rocks at them. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, he arrived, all 7 feet 7 inches of him, in the capital city of 
Khartoum, carrying a tree limb, just in case anyone there wanted to taunt him. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, some did. He got in fights in market areas, on buses, in movie 
theaters, and once even brawled while watching a handball tournament. That 
time, he supposedly hit a female bystander over the head with a chair. 
</P>
<P>
The moral of the story? Do not make Manute Bol feel like a freak because of his 
size. Or else, be able to run fast. 
</P>
<P>
Now, four years into his National Basketball Assn. career, others have learned 
that lesson as well. This man, though he looks like a human exclamation point, 
is not some side-show spectacle. He is an important player with the Golden 
State Warriors, who will meet the Phoenix Suns in Game 3 of the Western 
Conference semifinals tonight at the Oakland Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Bol may not be a finished player, but he is an intimidating presence on 
defense. His flat-footed, arm-extended reach has been measured at 10-3, and NBA 
players have learned that, against him, they had better be able to put lots of 
arch on their shots. 
</P>
<P>
"When I left college, a lot of people said, 'You can't play in the NBA a long 
time,' " Bol recalled. " 'How will you guard Moses Malone? How will you guard 
(Patrick) Ewing?' I thought I did good the first year. I did a lot of things. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm learning a lot. I'm learning about the game, too. A lot of things. Signing 
autographs. When to do it, when not to do it. People want me to sign at 5 
o'clock, 6 o'clock in the morning. I don't want to sign then. I don't know why 
people want me to that early. I don't get it yet." 
</P>
<P>
Bol obviously is the stuff legends are made of -- while he was attending the 
University of Bridgeport, fans from a rival school were so taken with him that 
they threw a party for him -- and his legend grows almost daily. 
</P>
<P>
Bol, for instance, is the only player in NBA history to have recorded more 
blocked shots than points in a season, and he has done it all four years in the 
NBA, the first three with the Washington Bullets. 
</P>
<P>
He has led the league in blocked shots twice, including 1988-89, when he easily 
outdistanced runner-up Mark Eaton of Utah, 4.31 per game to 3.84. 
</P>
<P>
He set a playoff record in the first round against the Jazz with 18 blocks in a 
three-game series. 
</P>
<P>
But those, of course, are defensive accomplishments. What of offense? Surprise! 
There is a three-point shooter heating up in the Bol pen. 
</P>
<P>
With a 22% success rate -- Miami's Jon Sundvold led the league at 52.2% and 
eight others were higher than 40% -- Bol is not yet a long-range sharpshooter. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Warrior Coach Don Nelson not only allows Bol to shoot the three, he 
encourages it. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people think it's crazy to let Manute shoot those, but it lets him 
make a statement," Nelson said. "It lets him become part of the offense. 
</P>
<P>
"The crowd gets a kick out of it, and the team does, too. It makes everybody 
surge a little more. It gives Manute some confidence, allows him to play freer. 
It definitely puts a better stride into his steps, too." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, also the Warriors' general manager, traded for Bol last June, sending 
center Dave Feitl and a 1989 second-round draft choice to the Bullets. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been trying to acquire him ever since I made the mistake of not drafting 
him at Milwaukee," the former Buck coach said. 
</P>
<P>
Together, they have prospered. 
</P>
<P>
Bol took 674 shots in his three years with the Bullets, including only three 
three-pointers. But in his one season with the Warriors, the numbers soared to 
344 and 91, respectively. That's about half as many three-pointers as some of 
the league's best shooters, and Bol averaged only 22.1 minutes a game. 
</P>
<P>
A jump shot? Not really. For Bol, who has three slightly clawed fingers on his 
right hand, an inherited disability common in his family, it's more like a 
heave. He puts ball in palm, left hand on top for balance, and then cocks the 
shot just past the right ear, looking something like a construction worker 
tossing a bag of cement over his shoulder. Then he fires. "Some friends told me 
that when we play the Lakers, the announcer for L.A. said, 'Doesn't Nellie know 
he shouldn't shoot that? He has no business shooting from out there,' " said 
Bol, in his ninth year of playing competitive basketball. "But I don't take too 
many shots. (Nelson) said, 'If you think it's a good shot, take it.' " 
</P>
<P>
So Bol does, much to the delight of the fans, here and around the league. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, meanwhile, has a unique weapon, and, on defense, a high-impact player 
to bring off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the most dominating non-starter in the game," Nelson said. "I'm not 
saying he's the best sixth man in the league or whatever, but nobody can alter 
what the other team is doing better than Manute when he comes off the bench." 
</P>
<P>
So why not start him? 
</P>
<P>
"I like to have that weapon in my back pocket, to have that fellow on the bench 
who can come in and change the course of the game," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Bol apparently recognizes his impact, too, whether it is as a shot blocker or 
his personality. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a captivating personality," said Bruce Webster, his coach at 
Bridgeport. "To walk clear across our campus, it takes about 10 minutes. You 
couldn't get across campus in 45 minutes if you were with Manute. Everybody 
would have something to say to him, and he'd usually stop and talk. 
</P>
<P>
" Hiya, Texas,' he would say to some guy. I asked, 'Why do you call him Texas?' 
'He has a girlfriend from Texas.' Oh. They loved him. He had high fives and low 
fives all over campus." 
</P>
<P>
The gregarious habits carry over to the court, where he sometimes engages in 
glib conversation with opponents. Not bad for someone who at 18 couldn't write 
his name, who comes from a culture that uses the smoke of dung fires to keep 
malaria mosquitoes away, someone who threw rocks at people who teased him. 
</P>
<P>
"He always leans over and starts kidding about blocking our shots," Clipper 
Coach Don Casey said. "He said to me one game, 'How come you're not throwing 
the ball into Benoit (Benjamin) more?' 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'OK, we're coming right at you next time. Right at you.' He said, in 
his accent, 'Goooood, then I have NBA-record 15 blocked shots. Bring it right 
in, coooch.' " 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, teams do. Some people just don't learn.

U.S. COACH HOPES TO GUIDE COUNTRY INTO SOCCER ELITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Forward Frank Klopas of the United States soccer team entertains teammates with 
impressions. 
</P>
<P>
Klopas' funniest impression is of former coach Lothar Osiander, who resigned 
because he earned more as the headwaiter at a San Francisco restaurant than he 
did as a part-time coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Futbol must come from the heart," Klopas says, pounding his chest, as he 
mimics Osiander delivering a pep talk. 
</P>
<P>
His teammates chuckle at Klopas' routine. 
</P>
<P>
Klopas, though, has not perfected an impression of Bob Gansler, who succeeded 
Osiander last January. 
</P>
<P>
That's understandable because Gansler isn't flamboyant. He has the low-key 
manner of a college professor. 
</P>
<P>
As Gansler put the team through practice for Saturday's World Cup qualifying 
match against Trinidad and Tobago at El Camino College, he offered 
encouragement as he moved from player to player. 
</P>
<P>
"I like (Gansler) because he communicates a little bit better with the players 
than the previous coach," said midfielder Jim Gabarra, who also plays for the 
Los Angeles Lazers. "He's very straightforward. He tells you what your role on 
the team is and what you do well and what you need to work on. 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing wrong with (Osiander) but we weren't together as a team." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Soccer Federation (USSF), bidding to send a team to the 1990 World 
Cup, hired Gansler, of Milwaukee, as a full-time coach and gave yearly stipends 
of $20,000-$30,000 to the players on the national team. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the national team was assembled only before important matches, but 
this team trains together for a third of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Coaching the national team is the culmination of a dream for Gansler, 47, a 
player and coach for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob has devoted his whole life to soccer," said Gansler's wife, Nancy. "He 
took me to a soccer game on one of our first dates." 
</P>
<P>
Devoted may not even be a strong enough word. 
</P>
<P>
Once, according to Al Hospel, Gansler's best friend, Gansler was walking around 
a soccer field. He stopped behind the goal and said, "One of these days I'd 
like to be buried here." 
</P>
<P>
And yet, although he is consumed by soccer, baseball was Gansler's first love. 
</P>
<P>
A switch-hitting catcher at Marquette High in Milwaukee, Gansler attracted the 
attention of the Milwaukee Braves, who offered him a minor league contract. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have gone and played in their rookie league," Gansler said. "But I 
thought it was too long of a trek to the majors so I decided to go to college." 
</P>
<P>
He attended Marquette University, where he played on the club soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
But Gansler really learned the game with the Milwaukee Bavarians, a club for 
whom he has played 14 seasons, five as player-coach. He coached the Bavarians 
to a national championship in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Bavarians are an amateur team, Gansler took his role as coach 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Players weren't allowed to drink or smoke while in training and practice was 
mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a tactician," said Hospel, who plays for the Bavarians. "You had to 
follow your assignment or you'd get pulled out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"But I can't remember anyone who wouldn't accept what he said. A lot of guys 
were looking for discipline." 
</P>
<P>
His players respected Gansler because of his successful playing career. 
</P>
<P>
A sweeper, Gansler captained the 1964 and 1968 U.S. Olympic teams and the 1963 
and 1967 Pan American Games teams. 
</P>
<P>
He played one season for the Chicago Mustangs in the North American Soccer 
League before deciding to concentrate on coaching. 
</P>
<P>
Returning to Marquette University, he coached the soccer team from 1964-67 
while earning a master's degree in German. 
</P>
<P>
After graduation, he coached at Marquette High, where he won a state title and 
five conference titles in nine years, then moved on to the University of 
Wisconsin Milwaukee, where he spent five years before he was hired by the USSF. 
</P>
<P>
Did the USSF gamble by hiring a college coach? 
</P>
<P>
"College coaching is not the true test," said Wake Forest Coach Walt Chyzowych, 
a former U.S. national coach. "Bob has coached on the international scene." 
</P>
<P>
Said Gansler: "I don't think I'm coming in cold. I've been around the USSF for 
over 20 years. I've coached many of the players on this team as they came 
through the ranks." 
</P>
<P>
Gansler coached the U.S. under-19 team from 1979-82, and it qualified for the 
World Youth tournament in 1981, the first time a U.S. youth team had advanced 
that far in world soccer competition. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, he coached the under-20 team to fourth place in the same 
tournament, the best finish by a U.S. team in an outdoor soccer competition in 
59 years. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a great organizer. That's what helped us in (the World Youth 
Championships)," said Kasey Kellar, a goalie for the under-20 team. "He knew 
what the other teams were going to do before they did and he was really able to 
prepare us. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been with him since he first got hired on the under-20 team and he's a 
lot easier going. When he first got hired, he was anxious to prove himself. He 
has really relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
But all aspects of Gansler's new job have not been so smooth. 
</P>
<P>
After a 1-0 loss at Costa Rica in his first game with the national team, 
Gansler spirited the team out of the locker room, leaving reporters with nobody 
to talk to. 
</P>
<P>
John Polis, the USSF publicist, said he was embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
But Gansler called it a misunderstanding, saying that the locker room had been 
too small to accommodate reporters as well as the team. The coach and players 
later met the press at their hotel. 
</P>
<P>
And after beating Costa Rica last month in St. Louis, Gansler opened the locker 
room to reporters and said it will continue to remain open after games. 
</P>
<P>
That's important because the U.S. soccer team has attracted unprecedented 
attention. Its World Cup qualifying games are being televised and an ABC 
network news crew has followed the team this week. 
</P>
<P>
There have been other glitches as well. 
</P>
<P>
After the national team scored only one goal in two World Cup qualifying 
matches against Costa Rica, for instance, Gansler was criticized by some for 
using a rigid system, stifling creativity. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, said midfielder Tab Ramos. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he gives us more freedom than any other coach I've ever had with the 
national team," Ramos said. "He wants every player to do what they do best and 
he encourages them to be creative within the team concept." 
</P>
<P>
The criticism doesn't bother Gansler. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is entitled to their opinions," Gansler said. "In the first (Costa 
Rica) game, we didn't play at a fast enough pace. Using basketball terms, it 
was like we walked the ball up the court every time even when there were 
fast-break opportunities. We waited for them to set their defense and we were 
constantly attacking against 11 players. 
</P>
<P>
"We solved that in the second game but we went overboard. We were constantly 
looking for the fast break or, as we say in soccer, the quick play or counter. 
We were forcing it. We have to have a happy medium." 
</P>
<P>
Gansler is also under pressure as the U.S attempts to qualify for the World Cup 
for the first time in 40 years. The U.S. will automatically qualify for the 
1994 World Cup because it will be held here. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important for us as players to prove to the world that we can qualify and 
not have the World Cup handed to us as it will be in 1994," goalie David Vanole 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But if the U.S. fails to qualify, will Gansler lose his job? 
</P>
<P>
"If we were the Washington Redskins and we were favored to win the Super Bowl 
and we didn't make the playoffs, I think (Coach) Joe Gibbs would be looking for 
a new job," said Art Walls, chairman of the USSF coaching committee. 
</P>
<P>
"But you've got to remember that we're babies in world soccer. Although we've 
made a very strong impression on the world soccer scene in the last few years, 
we've got a long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
Gansler agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"The World Cup is Mt. Olympus," he said. "We want to climb that mountain, but 
in the meantime we have to scale some lesser peaks and be satisfied with Mt. 
McKinley." 
</P>
<P>
Gansler has instituted a rigorous training program to prepare for the climb. 
</P>
<P>
The national team's daily schedule includes team meals, practices, scrimmages 
and meetings as it prepares for Saturday's match. The players are busy from 7 
a.m. to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need a curfew because most of us are so tired at the end of the day 
that all we can do is sleep," Klopas said between practices. "Coach really 
works us." 
</P>
<P>
Gansler developed the work ethic at an early age. 
</P>
<P>
He was 11 when his parents emigrated to the United States from West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Gansler was born in Mucsi, Hungary, a small village where his family owned a 
vineyard. The southern Hungarian village had been settled by Germans, lured by 
the offer of free land. 
</P>
<P>
After World War II, the entire village was claimed by the Hungarian government, 
which gave the 3,000 residents three days to move. 
</P>
<P>
The Ganslers fled to Frankfurt, but didn't feel welcome there. 
</P>
<P>
"While we were in Hungary we were considered Germans, and while we were in 
Germany we were considered as Hungarians," Gansler said. "So we thought that we 
might as well try to be Americans." 
</P>
<P>
They settled in Milwaukee, where they joined 100 other families from their old 
village. 
</P>
<P>
"My first couple of weeks here, it seemed like it was going to be a tragedy, 
but I adapted pretty well," Gansler said. 
</P>
<P>
Gansler's father, a bricklayer, envisioned a better life for his only son in 
America, sending him to college and graduate school. 
</P>
<P>
And now, Gansler is trying to boost American stock in a European game.

JIM MURRAY: TODAY, HE'D REALLY BE A PEACHY GUY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once upon a time, there was this ballplayer and he was one of the best ever to 
play the game. He played with great intensity and verve, not to say abandon, 
and he got more hits than anyone else who ever played the game. You might say 
he sort of symbolized it. 
</P>
<P>
And then one day, rumors began to spread about him. He, of all people, had been 
betting on games, the whispers went. He was mixed up in some very bad company. 
All baseball was aghast -- to say nothing of the rest of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rose? Naw. Who said anything about Pete Rose? We're talking about Ty Cobb 
here. 
</P>
<P>
You heard me. Tyrus Raymond Cobb. The legend. The man who would do anything to 
beat you. 
</P>
<P>
The details are the least bit hazy. But that's because baseball wanted them 
that way. The word cover-up was not in use in those times. But that may have 
been what it was. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that the infamous Chicago Black Sox, thrown out of the grand old game 
for fixing the 1919 World Series, had come forward in 1927 to claim that, in 
1917, they were able to win a pennant because a collection had been taken up on 
the team to pay off key Detroit players to lose two consecutive doubleheaders 
to Chicago and insure the pennant for them. 
</P>
<P>
One of the key players? Ty Cobb. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the Black Sox ringleaders, Swede Risberg and Chick Gandil, were to 
testify. Even Cleveland's Tris Speaker was brought under suspicion. But Eliot 
Asinof, in his book "Eight Men Out," reports that the commissioner of baseball, 
Judge Kenesaw Landis, dismissed the charges. Why? "Because he was not 
interested in matters that occurred before he came to power." 
</P>
<P>
Except that the Black Sox scandal, on which he made his reputation, occurred 
before he came to power. 
</P>
<P>
What is more likely is that the judge couldn't bear to land another hard blow 
to the national pastime. Baseball couldn't handle a "Say it ain't so, Ty." 
</P>
<P>
A violent man who roughed himself up with paranoia, Cobb always saw a world of 
enemies. Fueled by hate, he drove himself with a frenzy unmatched in the 
history of the game. He may have been the most-feared man ever to put on a 
baseball uniform. Teammates said there were days they were afraid to say hello 
to him. 
</P>
<P>
Al Stump, free-lance journalist, is perhaps the foremost authority on Cobb. He 
lived with him for several months of Cobb's late life when he was preparing a 
biography on the dying star. 
</P>
<P>
"They're doing a story in the movies on Cobb," Stump writes. "I just signed a 
participation deal with Robert Greenwald Productions-MPI at MGM. Terrible Ty 
makes it to the silver screen. 
</P>
<P>
"Only there's this one big trouble: Who do you get to play the dyspeptic, 
villainous Tiger as hero of a drama depicting his life? 
</P>
<P>
"Do you call Central Casting or the Screen Actors' Guild and say 'Who've you 
got who can play a guy who could slug fans without arms, terrify umpires, slash 
folks with his spikes, brawl in ballparks and saloons, hate Babe Ruth, carry 
more scars than a bad fighter, abuse sportswriters, go four for five at bat 
wearing bandages, be charged with fixing games, have $12 million socked away 
but drive through blizzards looking for a crap game? Must be over 6 feet, 
squinty- eyed, as antisocial as Machine Gun Kelly. Packs a gun -- will travel." 
</P>
<P>
Adds Stump: "You need a Boris Karloff, at least. Or Bela Lugosi. Face it -- who 
could possibly portray someone so bilious, hostile to humankind and so driven 
to win that even gentle, kindly old Connie Mack called him 'a hellhound, a 
devil in cleats,' that several ladies divorced him for extreme cruelty, that 
only three baseball people showed up for his funeral? 
</P>
<P>
"It's a dilemma. All Hollywood needed for 'The Babe Ruth Story' was to fatten 
up jolly Bill Bendix a little bit and he wasn't too awful as Ruth. Gary Cooper 
as Lou Gehrig? OK if you overlooked his build. Ronald Reagan was a passable 
Grover Cleveland Alexander. Dan Dailey wasn't booed out of the theater as Dizzy 
Dean. 
</P>
<P>
"With T.R. Cobb, what we have is an anti-hero to surpass Edward G. Robinson as 
Scarface Capone. 
</P>
<P>
"For 24 incredible, almost-friendless seasons, Cobb didn't even like himself. 
In 1908, he beat the hell out of a poor street-worker. In 1909, he was booked 
for pulling a knife on a hotel detective. In 1912, he climbed into the stands 
to clobber a one-armed, razzing spectator. He claimed to have killed an 
attacker in Detroit with a pistol. 
</P>
<P>
"You want tough? In 1916, he used a gun on a butcher and trashed his entire 
shop over the price of a piece of liver. By that time, he was unable to enter 
the state of Ohio, where he faced jail for knifing a waiter. He was in more 
police lockups than a pickpocket. 
</P>
<P>
"After spiking some stitches on the beloved Home Run Baker, he drew packets of 
Black Hand (Mafia) mail. He was once chased by an entire enraged mob, escaping 
on a streetcar only by inches. At 73, he was still smashing whiskey bottles in 
bars and accusing Reno craps dealers of cheating him, cursing enemies dead for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's his good side . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Oh, I don't know, Al. Sounds like picture to me, as they say in Culver City. I 
haven't been to a movie in years where the hero wasn't an ugly thug, or an 
antisocial shrimp or a misunderstood sociopath. Clark Gable would starve to 
death today. Government is the villain. The first guy you see scratching his 
torn sweat shirt is the hero. 
</P>
<P>
Who was it said the plot of movies now is, "Boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy 
kills girl,"? I don't think you got a casting problem. What's the matter, Jack 
Nicholson busy?

LAWRENCE TAYLOR IS FOUND INNOCENT OF DRUNKEN DRIVING IN NEW JERSEY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Linebacker Lawrence Taylor of the New York Giants was acquitted Wednesday of 
drunken driving charges stemming from a March arrest on the Garden State 
Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
"The justice system works and I'm happy for myself," the eight-time All-Pro 
said shortly after he was found innocent of the charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge John Conte found Taylor innocent based on testimony from two 
doctors who said the National Football League star suffered from acute food 
poisoning on the night of his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities alleged Taylor was found sleeping at 3:30 a.m. March 24 behind the 
wheel of his Jeep, which was parked on the shoulder of the Parkway. He was 
charged with drunken driving despite two blood alcohol level readings of .09 
percent. Under New Jersey law, .10 percent is considered legally drunk. 
</P>
<P>
But food poisoning, and not alcohol, was the reason the NFL star felt ill, said 
two physicians called as expert witnesses by Taylor's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Alan Lupinacci of West Paterson said Taylor became sick from an organism 
contained in poorly prepared fettuccine Alfredo eaten on a flight from Atlanta 
to Newark the day before his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor has undergone drug rehabilitation twice in the last three years.

The perception of college sports as inherently corrupt is unfair to many good 
programs and changing that image is the top priority of the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn., Executive Director Dick Schultz said in a speech at 
Spartanburg, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting a pretty good handle on recruiting violations," Schultz said in 
his address at the Wofford College athletic awards banquet. "By the time that 
happens, we have the social problems that start popping up." 
</P>
<P>
Schultz referred specifically to several recent criminal incidents involving 
members of the University of Oklahoma football team. He later said the NCAA was 
following with interest the case at South Carolina, where four former coaches 
have been charged in federal court in connection with the purchase and 
distribution of steroids.

Jerry Parks, former Oklahoma cornerback on trial in Norman, Okla., for the 
shooting of teammate Zarak Peters, entered a plea of no contest, then quickly 
withdrew it. 
</P>
<P>
Parks withdrew the plea when District Judge Preston Trimble said he would not 
go along with a recommendation from Peters that Parks serve a two-year deferred 
sentence and pay Peters' medical bills as punishment for the shooting, which 
occurred Jan. 13 in the Oklahoma athletic dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
Parks was charged with shooting with intent to injure after Peters was shot in 
the chest during an argument.

Mike Tyson will defend his heavyweight title against Carl (the Truth) Williams 
July 21 at the Atlantic City Convention Center, according to Jack O'Donnell,

METS ROUT REDS FOR 11-4 VICTORY 
</P>

<P>
It seems that the New York Mets' weeklong batting slump has ended. After all, 
they defeated the Cincinnati Reds, 11-4, Wednesday night at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Not necessarily so. An error on a double play opportunity that would have ended 
the sixth inning helped New York break the game open with a six-run rally. 
</P>
<P>
With two on and one out in a 3-3 tie, Met pitcher Ron Darling hit the 
double-play ball to shortstop Barry Larkin, whose short toss sailed over the 
head of second baseman Ron Oester. 
</P>
<P>
Leadoff batter Mookie Wilson grounded to third, and Chris Sabo fumbled it. 
Before the inning ended, another error was made, and Kevin McReynolds and Keith 
Hernandez each singled in two runs. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets had gotten only seven runs and 22 hits in the last five games. They 
improved their figures, with nine hits, including two home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Johnson hit a two-run home run in the seventh to give the Mets the most 
runs they have scored in a game this season. Earlier, Barry Lyons, replacing 
slumping catcher Gary Carter, hit his first home run since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Aguilera pitched the final three innings for the Mets to earn his first 
major league save. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 10, Houston 1 -- For all intents and purposes, the game at Houston was 
over when the Expos scored eight runs in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight after that was a 15-minute free-for-all in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
It started when Astro reliever Larry Andersen threw a pitch close to Spike 
Owen. Owen charged the mound, and the benches emptied. Andersen suffered a cut 
on his nose. Three Montreal players and an Astro coach were ejected. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Foley sparked the Expos' attack with three doubles and a single to drive in 
three runs. The Expos were trailing, 1-0, when their first four batters hit 
safely in the second to start the rally. 
</P>
<P>
Bryn Smyth (3-1) gave up three hits in seven innings. It was the Expos' seventh 
consecutive victory at the Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 3, San Diego 1 -- Joe Magrane, the league's earned-run leader last 
season, lost a no-hit bid at St. Louis on a one-out double by Carmelo Martinez 
in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
He gave up an unearned run on shortstop Ozzie Smith's error before Martinez's 
hit. But Tom Brunansky hit a two-run home run in the seventh, and Magrane (3-2) 
earned the victory. He gave up two hits and struck out a career-high eight 
before Todd Worrell came in to strike out Marvell Wynne with two on in the 
ninth to get the save. 
</P>
<P>
It was Magrane's third start since coming off the disabled list on April 30, 
suffering from colitis. His longest stint this season had been 6 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 4, Chicago 3 -- Mitch Williams has given the Cubs' bullpen a big 
lift, but they often don't know what to expect from the 6-foot-4 left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't care much for what he did in this game at Chicago when he came in 
to protect a 3-2 lead in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
First, he let Will Clark single in the tying run. Then, he balked in the 
winning run. DAN HAFNER

<P>
Early this spring, Lt.(j.g.) Napoleon McCallum was publicly predicting that the 
Navy would allow him to play professional football for the San Diego Chargers 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
They Navy confirmed Wednesday morning that McCallum has been assigned to San 
Diego, effective immediately. The Navy also said it has approved McCallum's 
request for outside employment -- playing running back with the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
McCallum, who hasn't played a down in the National Football League in two 
seasons, could be in a Charger uniform as early as today at the club's spring 
mini-camp because he is on leave. 
</P>
<P>
McCallum graduated from the Naval Academy in 1986 and played in 15 games for 
the Los Angeles Raiders -- rushing for 536 yards and catching 13 passes. Then 
the Navy shipped send him to sea, and he missed the 1987 and 1988 seasons. His 
commitment with the Navy ends Jan. 1, 1991, but the sea duty portion of that 
commitment is over. BRIAN HEWITT

Second-seeded Michael Chang defeated Diego Perez of Spain, 6-3, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert, using a strong serve and forehand, dominated Pugh, ranked 69th in the

his serve that was changed by the line umpire. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert broke Pugh at 15-15 to open the second set, then earned a second break 
to win the match with a backhand down the line. 
</P>
<P>
Two-time Wimbledon champion Boris Becker of West Germany defeated Javier 
Sanchez of Spain, 6-1, 6-3, to advance to the third round of the $692,000

</P>
<P>
Top-ranked Ivan Lendl also advanced by beating Andrei Cherkasov of the Soviet 
Union, 6-4, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
"I had expected a tough match," Lendl said. "You can't get used to clay in just 
one game." 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Gabriela Sabatini, blasting heavy top-spin shots with precision, 
opened defense of the Italian Open title with a 6-2, 6-2 victory over Laura 
Golarsa of Italy at Rome. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini, of Argentina, ranked No. 3 in the world, settled down after a slow 
start and overpowered the 81st-ranked Golarsa in about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"I played really well," Sabatini said. "I moved really well and I had very good 
concentration." 
</P>
<P>
Golarsa, who has never won a pro tournament, said: 
</P>
<P>
"It's useless to look for a miracle."

SAN PEDRO HIGH PRODUCES CROP OF TOP CATCHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Their cumbersome equipment of shinguards, chest protector and face mask are 
known in baseball circles as the tools of ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
But catchers at San Pedro High needn't worry about their image. On the 
contrary, the school takes pride in having produced several of the finest 
players ever to crouch behind a plate in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Two former Pirates -- Alan Ashby of the Houston Astros and Brian Harper of the 
Minnesota Twins -- have enjoyed successful major league careers as catchers. 
Nick Castaneda, another ex-San Pedro catcher, is a first baseman in the Kansas 
City Royals' farm system. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts say Dale Johnson, a powerfully built junior with a cannon arm, 
will be the next Pirate catcher to play pro ball. 
</P>
<P>
It wouldn't surprise Jerry Lovarov, San Pedro's veteran coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Dale is right there with any catcher I've ever had as an 11th-grader," he 
said. "In terms of arm strength, I think he's a little stronger than all those 
other kids." 
</P>
<P>
An unassuming Johnson shies from comparisons to San Pedro's catching greats. 
He's more concerned with improving his game than measuring up to the memory of 
Ashby and Harper. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I take pride in knowing that they came from San Pedro," he said. "But 
I don't think about it much." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's thoughts are entrenched in the present, not the past. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro has won nine consecutive Southern-Pacific Conference games and sits 
atop the standings with a 12-3 record largely because of the exploits of its 
5-foot-11, 198-pound catcher. His three RBIs Tuesday helped the Pirates beat 
Carson, 15-5, and improve to 15-8 overall with two league games left before 
they advance to the L.A. City Section 4-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Although he missed three games because of a slight knee injury, Johnson leads 
the team with a .425 batting average (31 for 73), five home runs and 30 RBIs, 
the proverbial triple crown of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an excellent hitter," Lovarov said. "He can hit the fastball, and he hits 
the curveball as well as any player I've had. That's rare. Usually it takes a 
number of years to learn how to hit the curveball." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson is just as highly regarded as a defensive player. 
</P>
<P>
Narbonne Coach Nick Van Lue, a former assistant at San Pedro and Harbor 
College, says Johnson is nearly impossible to steal bases on because of his 
strong arm and quick release. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't steal bases off him," he said. "You have to steal off the pitcher 
when you play San Pedro." 
</P>
<P>
Van Lue has the numbers to back up his statement. In Narbonne's 12-1 loss to 
San Pedro last Friday, he timed Johnson's throw from home plate to second base 
in 1.9 seconds. Most high school catchers throw in the 2.2 to 2.3 range, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's probably one of the best catchers I've seen in a long, long time on the 
high school level," Van Lue said. "He's extremely intelligent behind the plate 
and he has a major-league arm. That's what the scouts look for." 
</P>
<P>
Said Banning Coach Syl Saavedra, whose team trails San Pedro by one game in the 
Pacific League: "I'd love to have him." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he strengthened his arm in the off-season by playing hours of 
catch and lifting weights. He regards his receiving skills as the area that 
needs the most work. 
</P>
<P>
"I need to block the ball better," he said. "I have to move quicker." 
</P>
<P>
However, Lovarov has no complaints. He says Johnson, aside from his playing 
skills, helps the team by bringing enthusiasm to games that rubs off on San 
Pedro's other players. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a kid that comes to play," Lovarov said. "He's always fired up. I have to 
calm him down sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson admits he's a "take-charge guy" on the field. Away from baseball, the 
burly athlete seems reserved and uncomplicated. He began playing organized ball 
when he was 5 years old and says the sport has occupied much of his time. 
</P>
<P>
"I've caught most of my life," he said. "I enjoy it. I guess I've been catching 
so long I just got used to it." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's early development can be traced to excellent youth baseball programs 
in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fantastic thing to have in a little town like that," Van Lue said. 
"It's the same thing with El Segundo. By the time the players get to high 
school, they have a pretty good idea how to play the game." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was so accomplished when he started high school that he became the 
Pirates' starting catcher last season as a sophomore. Lovarov said only one 
other catcher, Castaneda, has started as a 10th-grader during his 28 years as 
head coach. 
</P>
<P>
Lovarov, 58, says finding a competent catcher is vital to building a strong 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody who coaches does the same thing," he said. "You try to build 
strength up the middle. You have to work from somewhere. I've always felt that 
you have to develop a good pitcher and catcher first and work from there." 
</P>
<P>
To achieve that goal, Lovarov has had to convert many players to catcher from 
other positions. For example, he said Ashby and Harper were infielders before 
he moved them behind the plate during their junior years. 
</P>
<P>
They made the move willingly. Others need coaxing to play catcher because of 
the unglamorous nature of the position and its physical demands. 
</P>
<P>
"Very few kids like to play catcher," Lovarov said. "It's a lot of hard work. 
You damage your fingers and everything else. But all the good ones loved to 
catch after you got them back there." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson loved catching from the start. Some may consider that ignorant. But if 
he can follow in the footsteps of Ashby and Harper, it might turn out to be the 
smartest move of his life. 
</P>

International Museum, coined a new word in response to the unusual (to say the 
least) circumstances that disrupted the local fund-raising scene last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the Grand Ballroom of the U.S. Grant hotel, Ehringer inaugurated 
the word "bi-galal" to describe a pair of fellow committee members who worked 
not only on her "Encore 1989" event but also on the "Magical Experience" gala, 
given the same evening at the Sheraton Harbor Island for the La Jolla Cancer 
Research Foundation. The volunteers in question, artists Annette and Dick Ford, 
designed the decorations for both events and thus had to attend both parties on 
a part-time basis. 
</P>
<P>
The weekend strained the loyalties of many, since seven major fund-raisers were 
held Friday and eight Saturday. No one admitted to understanding how this 
traffic jam of good citizenry came to pass -- and good will between competing 
organizations was in some cases stretched thin -- but among the weekend's 
maelstrom of major events were the annual Gold and White Ball for the Crime 
Victims Fund, the annual Fiesta Grande for the Children's Museum, the 
Temptations concert at Del Mar Plaza for Casa de Amparo, the Mainly Mozart 
Gala, the Louis Ferraud haute couture show for La Jolla Chamber Music Society 
and -- well, too many others to mention. 
</P>
<P>
The Mingei event revealed itself through its details; since the museum houses 
collections of folk art from around the world, the decorations included fine 
specimens from private collections. A live auction offered items dear to the 
hearts of crafts collectors, including a Dogon granary door, an antique drum 
made of African lion skin and a hand-made wooden rocker commissioned by the 
museum's board of directors. The menu represented different parts of the globe, 
with emphasis on French cuisine, highlighted by consomme de canard and saumon 
avocat. Anthropologists Ethel and Burt Aginsky were the subject of a special 
tribute. 
</P>
<P>
The evening coincided with the 11th anniversary of the museum, but Mingei 
founder and director Martha Longenecker said that the occasion prompted her to 
look ahead, rather than to the past. "What's ahead of us is much greater than 
what is behind us," she said. "We're looking towards the future and towards 
building a permanent museum." 
</P>
<P>
Among those present were Katy and Michael Dessent, Barbara and Jim Sherrill, 
Roger Cornell, Edie Drcar, Nora and Alan Jaffe, Mary Rand Williams, Dorothea 
Cronogue, Alice and Tony di Gesu, Susan Eyer, and Judy and Thomas Buffaloe. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Theodore, a professional singer who attended Friday's Mainly Mozart gala 
as a guest of event chairman Jacque Powell, glanced around the Westgate Hotel's 
Versailles Ballroom and said, "If Mozart was only alive to see this . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, characterized in the film "Amadeus" as the bad boy of 
classical music, might have felt at home in the confines of the Baroque, 
candle-lit room, where an air of Viennese gaiety prevailed that could have been 
sweetened only if the guests had worn period wigs whitened with powdered sugar. 
</P>
<P>
The event anticipated the first Westgate Mainly Mozart Festival (ts proper, 
corporate-sponsored name), which will run June 2 through June 11 on the 
Festival Stage at the Old Globe Theatre and will feature, as should seem 
obvious, mostly Mozart. Festival President Laurie Waddy described the evening 
as the concert series' only fund-raiser, and predicted big things for Mainly 
Mozart. 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably going to be the biggest musical event ever to happen in San 
Diego," Waddy said. "We're hoping to do for San Diego what the Santa Fe Opera 
Festival has done for Santa Fe, and what the Spoleto festival has done for 
Charleston (South Carolina)." 
</P>
<P>
Event chairman Powell planned a lush, lavish evening for her 180 guests that 
began with a Champagne reception, continued with a dinner of filet 
strasbougeois and strawberries in sauce sabayon, and featured continuous 
dancing to society pianist Barry Levich and his ensemble. Perhaps because 
Mozart wrote relatively few syncopated rhythms, Levich played everything but 
Mozart, including the "Varsity Drag" and "Makin' Whoopee" (it can be 
conjectured that Wolfgang would have liked the latter of these). Climbing 
arrangements of miniature orchids towered above the dinner tables. 
</P>
<P>
Powell said she chose orchids as a symbol of the Mainly Mozart Festival's 
potential. "A first-time event is a lot like taking a chance on an orchid 
plant," she said. "Will it grow? Will it blossom? This one will." 
</P>
<P>
The guest list included many long-time supporters of San Diego classical music 
organizations, including BobbieCQ and Blaine Quick, Veryl and Aage 
Fredericksen, Martha and George Gafford, D'Neane Wilkinson, Dick Jacobson, 
Peggy Duly, Linda and Charles Owen, Lael and Jay Kovtun, Jeanne Larson, Sheri 
and Ben Kelts, Evelyn Truitt, Ed Pilkerton, Luba Johnston, Darlene Davies with 
Paul Marshall, and Kathy and George Pardee. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Spanos, the multimillionaire developer who founded his fortune on selling 
sandwiches from a panel truck, has been criticized once or twice since he took 
control of the San Diego Chargers in 1984, but he managed to maintain a 
cheerful countenance the other evening when Bob Hope, Telly Savalas and other 
pals stood to praise him as a philanthropist, leading citizen and all around 
good guy. 
</P>
<P>
The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith awarded Spanos its National 
Distinguished Community Service Award at the prejudice-fighting group's annual 
tribute dinner and dance, given May 3 at the San Diego Marriott. But while 
Spanos said he was pleased with the award, what he really wanted to talk about 
was football. 
</P>
<P>
Waving the award at the audience of 500, Spanos said, "As I look at this 
trophy, I want to thank the ADL, but I hope the next trophy I hold will be the 
Super Bowl trophy. I've given orders to director of football operations Steve 
Ortmayer and our new coach, Dan Henning, 'Whatever it takes, you get that 
talent and bring it in.' I hate losing, and I promise you will see dramatic 
changes this year." 
</P>
<P>
In reference to the main topic of the evening, the work of the ADL, Spanos 
said, "I believe there will be a day when no ethnic or racial minority will 
have to fight for its rights." In 1986, Spanos, the son of Greek immigrants, 
was among 80 Americans awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor by the Statue of 
Liberty Ellis Island Foundation and the New York Statue of Liberty Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The dinner's seven co-chairmen -- the group included banker Bob Adelizzi, 
attorney Miles Harvey and Chargers director of administration Jack Teele -- 
organized an elegant tribute for Spanos that ranged from delicately demure 
arrangements of white tulips to a training-table menu of steak and baked 
Alaska. The formal program opened with videotaped tributes from Spanos family 
members and assorted golfing buddies, including former President Gerald Ford, 
who said that Spanos "epitomizes the very best in our society." 
</P>
<P>
The audience was notably disappointed when the famous Hope-Spanos soft shoe 
routine, which the pair frequently dances at charity events, was performed on 
tape rather than the stage, but perked up when Hope took the microphone to 
reminisce about his long-time friend. 
</P>
<P>
"Alex is some kind of man," Hope said. "I taught him how to dance. He's a 
charitable guy, he's nice to know. But that's not what interests him right now 
-- what interests him now is getting a winning team for San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
The guest list was headed by Spanos' wife, Faye, and included Susie and Dean 
Spanos, Dea Economou, Dolores Hope, Warren Jones, Si Coleman, Gerry Wambach, 
ADL chairman Jodyne Roseman, Stanley Heyman, Mitchell Dubick, Jim Schmidt, 
Marilyn and Kim Fletcher, former Chargers coach Sid Gillman, County Supervisor 
Leon Williams, and Anne and Abe Ratner.

LAB IN GUEST HOUSE NURTURES A WORLD OF EXOTIC ORCHID CULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By R. DANIEL FOSTER, Foster is a Woodland Hills free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perched among the hills of Studio City, a tiny guest house is wreathed by 
violet ice plants that shimmer in the late afternoon sun. A mammoth stand of 
eucalyptuses frames a vista of clustered high-rises. But the tranquil 
atmosphere outside belies the complexity of the work going on within: This 
peaceful hillside cottage is the site of experiments in genetic engineering. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, a man wearing a spotless lab coat and surgical gloves labors over a 
green concoction, mincing it into tiny granules. Reflected in his round 
spectacles are endless rows of Pyrex flasks basking under florescent lights -- 
mini emerald worlds of roots and leaves at various stages of growth. Reams of 
typed formulas and petri dishes containing dried seed pods are stacked near 
heavy iron vats in another corner of the room. 
</P>
<P>
"Now these are a hot item," the man says, reaching for a flask. "Paphiopedilum 
kolopakingii -- a recent discovery. I have the first hybrids of it." 
</P>
<P>
The man behind the spectacles is Bob Hull, the guest house is the headquarters 
of Sunswept Laboratories, and the "hot items" are rare and endangered orchids. 
The mail-order business receives orchid seed pods regularly from about 40 
customers who need Hull's expertise in everything from asexual breeding to 
quadrupling chromosomes. In turn, Hull uses some of those seeds to grow new 
orchids that he sells to collectors and orchid societies. 
</P>
<P>
Orchids, Hull said, are delicate plants that require special conditions for 
growing outside their native tropical habitats. Without operations such as 
Sunswept Laboratories, the exotic plants have no way of rapidly multiplying. 
Collectors and hobbyists who want more orchids can divide their plants after a 
year or two, but that is a slow, uncertain process, said Hull, who is assisted 
by one full-time and two part-time workers. 
</P>
<P>
There are about a dozen orchids on the endangered species list put out by the 
U.S. government, but thousands more are considered rare. Rare and endangered 
plants, which can sell for as much as $6,000 a bulb, sell for about $10 each in 
the Sunswept catalogue. "We can spread a rare orchid around to the public very 
inexpensively," Hull said. "So the plants can go all over the world." 
</P>
<P>
Customers who want to propagate their own plants mail a seed pod to the lab. 
They are then charged $15 per pod and eventually receive two flasks, each 
priced at an additional $10, which individually contain about 35 tiny plants, 
ready for potting. Hull will sometimes waive his fee for rare pods in exchange 
for a few seedlings that they will eventually produce. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm willing to share seeds with Bob Hull because he keeps his cost within 
everyone's budget," said orchid curator Earl Ross, who tends 10,000 orchids at 
the Los Angeles State and County Arboretum in Arcadia. "We shouldn't limit rare 
orchids to just select individuals. If there's a demand, we need to supply the 
need." 
</P>
<P>
Ross said orchid prices are often artificially inflated. "It's a business and 
people who are in it commercially would like to protect the prices." 
</P>
<P>
Hull, a psychiatrist who treats psychotics at his Beverly Hills office, has 
combed the jungles of Ecuador, Colombia, Thailand, South Africa, Madagascar and 
Java for his stock of 1,000 species. He scours both public and private lands 
for plants and sometimes must pay a fee and obtain a collecting permit. He took 
his last trip five years ago and hopes to return to Panama in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
"Each time I go back, there are less and less species," Hull said, adding that 
back yards in various countries often turn up the best finds since many rain 
forests are being destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Orchids, traditionally associated with Mother's Day and proms, are termed 
"exotic" for good reason. "The crazy thing about orchid seeds is that they 
contain no food," Hull said, adding that most seeds contain a "starter pack" of 
nutrients essential for primary growth. 
</P>
<P>
When an orchid pod enters Hull's laboratory, it is first sterilized and then 
split open to reveal millions of seeds that are placed in a "mother flask" 
containing a blend of homogenized banana and charcoal. (In jungles, orchid 
seeds naturally fall upon fungi, which provide essential sugar and nitrogen, 
found in Hull's banana mixture.) Three weeks to two years later, the seeds 
germinate. Some species will not produce blooms for another seven years. 
</P>
<P>
An inspector from the Los Angeles County Department of Agriculture examines 
each Sunswept Laboratory shipment before it leaves the premises. A certificate, 
assuring that there are no pests on board, is packed inside. 
</P>
<P>
It was the absence of laboratories such as his own that prompted Hull to 
transform the guest house behind his home into a business 10 years ago. A 
degree in medicine from the University of Kansas and a few botany courses gave 
him the training needed for his work. "I started out with a few cymbidiums and 
then it spread from there. 
</P>
<P>
"The lab has cost me a lot of money," added Hull, who spends weekends and most 
evenings working in the guest house. "It's a losing operation." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to growing plants from seeds, Hull uses a propagation process 
called meristeming, which can produce thousands of genetically identical 
offspring from one shoot. A dissecting microscope is sometimes used to help 
pare down a shoot that is then put in liquid and tumbled in a flask for one 
month. 
</P>
<P>
In Hull's laboratory, a dozen flasks clamped to a mechanical wheel turn slowly 
under an artificial light. "We're tumbling the orchid tissue for about a month 
to confuse it," Hull said. "Then it won't put out roots or shoots and will 
instead form calluses." After tumbling, the tissue can be dissected further, 
eventually producing thousands of plants. 
</P>
<P>
Another propagation process alters chromosomes by treating seeds with a 
chemical. Although the offspring are slower-growing, the process can result in 
thicker leaves, greater color intensity, and wider sepals and petals. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the lab, there are two greenhouses on the premises that contain 
thousands of orchids. "It's a real jungle down here," Hull said, pushing his 
way past some Phalaenopsis orchids, commonly called moth orchids because of 
their lengthy blossom-covered stems, which appear to be smothered with hundreds 
of moths. 
</P>
<P>
Gnarly root systems hang from the ceiling, some rambling from pot to pot, 
refusing to stay put. Lengthy strands of Spanish moss drip from corners and a 
thickly leaved vanilla orchid winds around a doorway and across the ceiling. 
Multicolored blooms, some with ruffle-edged petals speckled with fuzz, emit a 
heavy perfume. The lab is equipped with a complex system of thermostats, 
louvers and misters to keep the proper humidity and air circulating around the 
roots. 
</P>
<P>
"Orchids are ugly plants, with nice flowers," Hull said as he caressed a 
Paphiopedilum, or slipper orchid. 
</P>
<P>
Recalling the first orchid collecting trip he took in 1976 to the highlands of 
Panama, Hull said: "I accidentally found a plant that was only collected once 
before in history -- at the turn of the century. It was a minor variety of a 
Lycaste orchid and very handsome. I traded it for a bunch of others, but should 
have kept the darn plant and propagated it."

CREATING A LIFE ON CAMPUS; 
</P>
<P>
WITH STUDENT DORMS, CSUN TRIES TO SHED IMAGE AS A COMMUTER SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For Amy Larson, Cal State Northridge was an escape from the small-town 
atmosphere at the University of Redlands, the private school near San 
Bernardino that she attended as a freshman. She regarded the CSUN campus as a 
comfortable place where she could regroup before applying to UCLA. It was an 
easy commute from her parents' Simi Valley home. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought of it as a transition school near home," Larson said. "You just 
think it's not in the same league as UCLA and USC." 
</P>
<P>
It is this image of a "second tier" institution, a suburban commuter campus, 
that officials at CSUN hope to erase within a generation or two. They envision 
a community -- like USC or UCLA -- in which students flock to campus for major 
sporting and entertainment events, a school with a reputation for turning out 
well-rounded graduates and alumni who recall their CSUN days fondly as they 
send in their contributions. 
</P>
<P>
University officials believe that students who live on campus can help turn 
those visions into traditions. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, CSUN is quadrupling the number of accommodations available to 
students who want to live on campus; by 1990 there will be nearly 3,000 spots. 
And as the university works to transform its campus culture, officials have 
started to market its new image as a residential school. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lifelong Allegiance 
</P>
<P>
"Once you've been at SC, you're a Trojan the rest of your life," said Diana 
Gruendler, CSUN's director of housing services. "You love it, you support it, 
and that's wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
"We are striving at CSUN to capture that same mentality, to cultivate and build 
that sense of spirit," she said. "It will influence future generations to come 
here. The sons and daughters of CSUN graduates will want to come here." 
</P>
<P>
Residence halls have existed at CSUN for about 20 years, and there has been 
interest in constructing more for at least a decade. Of the university's nearly 
30,000 students, about 1,400 live on campus. (At UCLA, 4,300 of the 34,650 
students live on campus; at USC, it's 6,562 out of 27,086.) In the fall of 
1990, when the new housing has been completed, about 10% of the Northridge 
student body will live on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the university started to send information to incoming students and 
high school counselors throughout the state, detailing new residential 
opportunities at the school. Community college counselors were alerted, and 
college guides were revised. More campus tours were scheduled. Available for 
the fall semester are 2,100 residential spots, and there are 2,600 
applications, Gruendler said. 
</P>
<P>
Amy Larson, who is about to finish her second year at CSUN, has lived on campus 
since last summer. "I didn't want to live at home with my parents," she said. 
"I was tired of commuting, getting here and never having a place to park. Then 
always rushing to get home to beat the traffic. Now I can hang out and just 
talk to people. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be around other students," she said. "I didn't want to get an 
apartment off campus with adults who have nothing to do with college." 
</P>
<P>
Although she has applied and been accepted to UCLA, Larson is staying put. "I 
ended up liking it so much," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Larson lives in the new, three-story University Park apartments, one of three 
existing residential complexes. The terra-cotta stucco building, which houses 
760 students, bears little resemblance to a traditional dormitory. Sunlight 
spills through large picture windows lining the hallways. The two-bedroom 
"deluxe" apartments are occupied by four students, each paying $3,255 for the 
school year -- or $361 a month for nine months. 
</P>
<P>
The cost is less in some of the older buildings -- $2,520 for the nine-month 
school year. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the new apartments has its own balcony. The units are furnished with 
butcher-block dining tables, chairs, couches, desks and lamps, all 
color-coordinated. Each apartment has its own bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
Fully equipped kitchens, complete with stove, refrigerator and garbage 
disposal, are standard features, and most students use them. Fewer than 
one-third of the residents participate in the meal plan. 
</P>
<P>
There is a small cafeteria with 13 tables in the Tower, the oldest of the three 
residence halls, and it is open to all live-in students. But at 6:30 one recent 
evening, only five people were feasting on that day's offering: barbecued ham 
or fish patties, with string beans, carrots or white rice. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing to write home about," freshman William Haul said as he polished off a 
plate of ham. 
</P>
<P>
Most students who spend the $1,100 to participate in the meal plan each year 
eat at the Student Union, which is a few blocks south of the residence halls. 
The food is better there, and the selection is greater, students say. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1987-88 school year, 672 students lived on the Northridge campus. 
That number more than doubled last fall, when the first of three new apartment 
complexes was completed, accommodating 760 more students. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complete in 1990 
</P>
<P>
Another complex, scheduled to open next fall, will house 750 students, and the 
final building, to be completed in 1990, will house 800. 
</P>
<P>
A satellite Student Union, complete with a dining hall, game rooms and meeting 
areas, will also open in 1990 as part of the residential development. 
</P>
<P>
When the final residence hall is completed, CSUN will have more on-campus 
housing than any of California's 18 other state colleges, administrators say. 
</P>
<P>
"Three-thousand students is a lot of people to have in one area," Gruendler 
said. "That's the size of many private universities. And those students are not 
just affecting each other. They're affecting the whole campus." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the students in campus residence halls, 5,000 more students live 
in apartments within three miles of the school, administrators estimate. 
</P>
<P>
They may not show up for dances at the dorms, but school officials say they 
take advantage of movie nights, theater productions, lectures and extended 
library hours. 
</P>
<P>
"All of those things make for a campus community," Gruendler said. "All of it 
starts to pull together. When you think of UCLA, that becomes real apparent." 
</P>
<P>
About 5,500 students live within a mile of the Westwood campus, either in 
private apartments or in fraternities and sororities, and they take advantage 
of what the community has to offer -- everything from bookstores and movie 
theaters to restaurants and upscale night spots. 
</P>
<P>
"It creates a collegiate atmosphere," Gruendler said. "I think that's what 
we'll start seeing in the Northridge area." 
</P>
<P>
One of the driving forces behind CSUN's desire to change its commuter-college 
image is a conviction that universities must do more than prepare students for 
their chosen professions -- that they must provide a well-rounded education 
grounded as much in human relations and social interaction as in literature and 
mathematical theory. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe a university is much more than a series of experiences in class," 
said Edmund Peckham, CSUN's vice president for student affairs. "A student 
grows as a person as well as an intellect in a discipline." 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, increasing numbers of college freshmen are campus residents -- 
49.9% in 1973 compared to 59.3% in 1988, according to UCLA's annual survey of 
college freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen to 20 years ago, living on campus was unpopular, college officials say. 
Students were protesting the Vietnam War and felt alienated from universities. 
They objected to the parental role assumed by dormitory staff and in many 
instances got more value for their money by renting private apartments off 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
Much of that has changed. Dormitories have fewer rules and have improved 
services. Their prices are more competitive with private housing. "Now," 
Peckham said, "students feel much more a part of the university." 
</P>
<P>
Several colleges in the state university system -- including Cal State Los 
Angeles, Cal State Hayward and Cal State Fullerton -- have opened residence 
halls for the first time in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it has to do with the serious look at educational policy over the last 
decade," said Ruth Goldway, a spokeswoman for Cal State Los Angeles. 
Universities have been increasingly criticized for churning out graduates who 
have technical expertise but are lacking in general knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
Students who live on campus are more likely to participate in school 
activities. That, in turn, "develops parts of the student other than their 
ability to be an accountant or engineer," Goldway said. 
</P>
<P>
In arguing for more dormitories, college officials also cite studies showing 
that resident students tend to have higher grade point averages and are more 
likely to earn a bachelor's degree in four years than students who commute to 
class each day. In theory, that means colleges have to spend less time 
recruiting students to replace those who drop out. 
</P>
<P>
"Philosophically, there is a bonding that takes place," Gruendler said. 
"Emotionally, there is a bonding that takes place. . . . It makes a student a 
better student." 
</P>
<P>
Surveys on student achievement figured prominently in the decision to build 
residence halls at Cal State Los Angeles, which has a large minority 
population, Goldway said. Historically, minorities have lacked some academic 
advantages enjoyed by Anglo students. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, residential units for 1,006 students have been constructed -- the 
first ever on the urban campus east of downtown Los Angeles. Units to 
accommodate 1,000 more students are part of the master plan, but there is no 
timetable for their completion. 
</P>
<P>
The residence halls at CSUN are part of a larger picture to enhance the 
reputation of the university. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, CSUN President James Cleary announced that the school -- previously 
in the NCAA's Division II -- would join the ranks of major college athletics in 
Division I in all sports but football. 
</P>
<P>
The new University Park apartments are part of a $150-million project that also 
includes an athletic stadium, performing arts center, entertainment center, 
hotel and restaurants -- all in a cooperative venture between the school and 
Watt Industries, a private developer. 
</P>
<P>
Profits from the commercial parts of the project will underwrite construction 
of university facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"I love CSUN," sophomore Anthony Magee said. "I consider it to be a pilot 
school. I consider us to be trend-setters." 
</P>
<P>
Magee, who has lived on campus since his first day at CSUN, wouldn't think of 
commuting to class. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that college should be an experience -- not an experience where you get 
up from your own bed and own home to go to school," he said. "I feel that 
college should be similar to going to the Army. You go off to learn and come 
home to tell your family and friends about your experience." 
</P>
<P>
The decision to build more residence halls, to become a different kind of 
campus, may be rooted in educational philosophy, but it is pragmatic as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Alumni support is the bottom line," Gruendler said. "Students who experience 
and have been a part of the residential bonding process give back to the 
university," much as the alumni of Greek fraternities and sororities tend to 
support their alma mater, she said. "For a university like ours, that's major." 
</P>
<P>
But the campus culture that administrators hope to create takes time to evolve. 
Eventually, officials say, athletic programs will enjoy more support as 
increasing numbers of students seek ways to occupy their time on weekends. 
Attendance at campus concerts, lectures and other off-hours events is also 
expected to jump. 
</P>
<P>
Those CSUN students who live on campus seem to enjoy the stereotypical Southern 
California life style. In warm weather, they congregate by swimming pools, 
barbecue pits and volleyball courts at the residence halls. The lights outside 
stay on until 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a community," senior Lesli Jones said. "Everyone who lives here knows 
each other." 
</P>
<P>
Students describe it as "a family," and their sense of camaraderie was evident 
in recent student elections. A CSUN resident, Erik Blaine, ran for student body 
president, and Julie Rams, another resident, ran for vice president -- the 
first time ever that campus residents had sought those positions. 
</P>
<P>
They lost, but their campaign became a rallying point for other resident 
students. And it made commuters aware of a different group on campus, 
university officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"So the issues were not just about where you're going to park," Gruendler said. 
"They were about the quality of life on campus, preservation of green space and 
security, round the clock."

NOT A VINTAGE YEAR FOR THEATRICAL FILMS ON AGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
There will be a touch of disappointment today when films and videos dealing 
with issues important to the aged are honored at the fifth annual Retirement 
Research Foundation National Media Awards. 
</P>
<P>
Never before has the engraved porcelain Owl and the $5,000 first-place prize 
for theatrical fiction gone unawarded. Three honorable mentions -- one in 
theatrical fiction and two in other categories -- will not be awarded either. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't find a film that met 100% of the criteria," Marilyn Hennessy, the 
foundation's senior vice president, explained about the theatrical fiction 
category. But, she said, the foundation will recognize Hollywood's effort, and 
honor two productions for their portrayals of older people. 
</P>
<P>
"Madame Sousatzka," starring Shirley MacLaine, will receive the second-place 
award and the TV movie "Marcus Welby, M.D.: A Holiday Affair," starring Robert 
Young, will receive an honorable mention, both in the theatrical fiction 
category. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago-based foundation, funded by money left by the late philanthropist 
John D. MacArthur, hopes to promote positive portrayals of the elderly through 
its awards program. 
</P>
<P>
The smaller number of awards this year highlights a continuing gap in film 
making -- the lack of quality films and videos on subjects important to 
increasing numbers of older Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"Its like wine," said foundation trustee William T. Kirby. "You have vintage 
years and non-vintage years. 
</P>
<P>
"We're interested in the way people think about the aged. Films about being old 
used to be sad because the ultimate prognosis is death." 
</P>
<P>
More than 380 entries, most independently produced, were screened this year. 
Judges from the media and experts in gerontology looked for productions that 
portray the aged without using stereotypes, and for meaningful and insightful 
treatment of economic, biological and social issues related to this growing 
segment of the U.S. population. There are about 31 million Americans 65 and 
older today; that group will grow to about 35 million in 2000, according to 
Department of Commerce projections. 
</P>
<P>
Foundation officials believe that Hollywood, concerned with demographics that 
show the largest portion of the movie-going audience to be under 30, favors 
romances and comedies and action films that feature younger stars. Thus, 
big-budget Hollywood films depicting older people in a positive light are rare. 
"Cocoon II," for example, was rejected by the foundation's judges because they 
believe it condones the preservation of youth, rather than accepting age. 
</P>
<P>
Most entries are not for mass audiences, but are nonfiction works responding to 
needs and questions that come with growing older: where to reside, who to turn 
to for help, how to deal with impairments and diseases. These were entered in 
categories for independent films and tapes, television nonfiction and training 
films and tapes. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a crying need for a lot more understanding of both the problems and 
opportunities of the elderly," said Joe Parkin, foundation president. "This 
kind of program, maybe, will (show) the need and attract the better independent 
producers to scratch their heads and say, 'Maybe I'll take a crack at that.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Independent film makers might like to make a film about aging, but 
fund-raising is difficult," said Dai Sil Kim-Gibson, a media consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Two-time Owl recipient Susan Stone Shapiro -- this year for "In Their Own 
Words: The Story of Search and Care," a 28-minute video about services for the 
elderly living at home -- relies on grants to produce her community videos. "I 
think it's helping as we write proposals to be able to say we are 
award-winning," she said. "The award is recognition that we've done something 
good for a group we believe in, for a cause we believe in." 
</P>
<P>
Owl award money -- from $500 to $5,000 -- is insufficient in itself to produce 
a quality film or video. Stone Shapiro's budget is $3,500 per video but she 
said that in-kind contributions bring the dollar value to $7,000 to $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Independent film makers tend to live project to project," said Steve Talley, 
who will receive a second Owl this year. "The awards have helped me keep body 
and soul together so I can pursue my dreams." 
</P>
<P>
Talley's latest winning entry, "A Cost of Caring," explores the economics of 
long-term health care. His winner last year, "Final Choices," looks at the 
right-to-die issue. Both pieces were funded by Los Angeles public television 
station KCET.

LOW-RATED KEDG-FM TO CHANGE ITS FORMAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KEDG-FM 101.9(the Edge), the troubled radio station that was a favorite of the 
record industry and adults with a taste for adventuresome rock, will play its 
last song Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The station will become K-LITE, changing its format from album-oriented rock to 
adult contemporary music beginning Saturday morning, executive vice president 
and general manager Bill Ward said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Where listeners had heard such critically acclaimed new artists as the Cowboy 
Junkies and Melissa Etheridge as well as such veteran figures as Bruce 
Springsteen and Elvis Costello, they will now hear Barbra Streisand, Neil 
Diamond, Diana Ross and Barry Manilow, Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
Ward expects that the new station will attract a larger audience than KEDG did 
and will fill the void left last month when another adult contemporary music 
station, also called K-LITE, went off the air to give way to KQLZ, "pirate 
radio." 
</P>
<P>
"We chose this format because K-LITE had a very loyal and large following and 
it was on the air in the market for about 3 years," Ward said. "We felt there 
was an obvious void and that it would be a real good companion station to our 
AM station, KMPC." 
</P>
<P>
Ward said the change in formats was due to KEDG's low Arbitron ratings, which 
put KEDG's audience at about 14,700 listeners, or a .9 share. 
</P>
<P>
Loyal listeners and employees at "the Edge" were shocked when they heard of 
KEDG's demise, which was announced to the staff Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"The deejays are just the greatest," said listener Kay Reindl, 23, of Reseda. 
"All my friends listened to it. We thought nothing could touch 'the Edge.' " 
</P>
<P>
Said J.J. Jackson, the station's program director: "We were completely blown 
away. The general manager's a very nice man but I just think he didn't 
understand what we were trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
What Jackson, who also functions as music director and deejay, was trying to do 
was "widen the parameters" of a rock station by playing mainstream favorites. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt there had to be enough people in enough numbers to support a station 
that had parameters as wide as we do," Jackson said. "We purposely didn't want 
that hipper-than-thou attitude that many stations get. We just tried to play 
those parameters real wide but keep away from formula bands." 
</P>
<P>
For Ward, the station's philosophy -- and its playlist -- didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
"It was quite inconsistent," he said. "The programming was never exactly in the 
position we had hoped it would be." But Ward said the decision to change 
formats was aimed at attracting a larger audience. "It has nothing to do with 
personal taste at all," he said. "It's purely a business decision." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said he thought the station was not given enough time to catch on and 
had not received sufficient promotion. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of that, the audience, which he said "had the most intelligent 
listeners -- doctors, lawyers, television producers, artists," had actually 
grown in the past few months. 
</P>
<P>
"We still get people all the time who say 'Gee I just found your radio 
station,' " Jackson said. " We did all this with word of mouth." 
</P>
<P>
The station made its debut as KMPC-FM in October, 1987. In March, its call 
letters were changed to KEDG to avoid confusion with its popular sister 
station, KMPC-AM, Ward said.

'GRAPES OF WRATH': IT'S MOTHER'S MILK TO STEPPENWOLF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For theaters in the 1980s, making poverty look real is a pricey proposition. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Steppenwolf Theatre Company unveils its newly revised version of 
"The Grapes of Wrath" at La Jolla Playhouse on Sunday, nearly $1 million will 
have been spent translating John Steinbeck's 50-year-old Pulitzer-Prize winning 
novel about migrant farm workers to the stage. 
</P>
<P>
Half of that was spent by Steppenwolf in its original 41-character Chicago 
production; the Playhouse ponied up $450,000 for Steppenwolf's revised (read 
"pared-down") version, making the now 35-character show the most expensive in 
the life of both companies. 
</P>
<P>
And more will be spent when "The Grapes of Wrath" leaves La Jolla on June 17 to 
open at the National Theatre in London a few days later. 
</P>
<P>
The stakes have certainly risen since Steppenwolf founders Gary Sinise, Jeff 
Perry and Terry Kinney, and their fellow high school and college students, 
jump-started the company 13 years ago in the basement of a Catholic elementary 
school in Highland Park, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Still, while much has changed for the troupe in the years since the trio had to 
scramble to find $300 to put on a show, much abides. 
</P>
<P>
What Sinise, Perry and Kinney wanted to create in that 88-seat basement was a 
family of actors who made group decisions about their choice of work and 
directors. Never mind that the acting ensemble in the early years often 
outnumbered the audience and that one of the main contentions backstage was 
whether they thought it was worth it to go on. ("We always did," Kinney said. 
"What else were we going to do?") 
</P>
<P>
The company's goal was to build a safe haven for performers in a world that 
provides no shortage of discouragement for unknowns. 
</P>
<P>
Their loyalty to each other in darker days continues to pay off with a variety 
of rewards, including a Tony Award in 1985. And some members of Steppenwolf 
have gone on to greater fame: John Malkovich ("Dangerous Liaisons"), John 
Mahoney ("Say Anything") and Joan Allen (now starring on Broadway in "The Heidi 
Chronicles"). 
</P>
<P>
It was the reputation of Sinise and Malkovich's work in the Steppenwolf 
production of Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men" that won the company the permission 
of Steinbeck's widow, Elaine, to adapt the book for the stage. 
</P>
<P>
During a rehearsal break, Sinise, Perry and Kinney, who act in the play as Tom 
Joad, Noah Joad and Jim Casy, marveled at their artistic journey, which, in its 
way, resembles the remarkable journey of the Joads themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The choice of a play about farmers who look for work in California after losing 
their Oklahoma land was in tune with the spirit of the company, they all agree. 
</P>
<P>
"The theme of the book is about 'I' becoming 'we,' " Kinney said. "It's 
something that moved us because it's about people who are disenfranchised. 
We've always felt communion with the underdog because we were that in what we 
did. 
</P>
<P>
"No one can relate to people who live in the street like actors. We are 
gypsies, itinerants, on the move. We really felt we could shed light on the 
project because of that." 
</P>
<P>
For the adapter, Frank Galati, who received an Academy Award nomination last 
year for the adaptation of "The Accidental Tourist" that he wrote with director 
Lawrence Kasdan, it is also a dream project, the first that came to mind when 
Sinise asked him what work he would most like to do with the ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than being intimidated by the 1940 movie, "Grapes of Wrath," which he 
said he admires, Galati was inspired to bring to the play what Hollywood could 
not more than 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the Joad daughter, Rose of Sharon, giving birth to a healthy baby as 
she does in the movie, Rose of Sharon's baby will be stillborn, as in the book. 
And, as in the book, playgoers will see Rose using her mother's milk to feed a 
starving man -- a scene not included in the movie. 
</P>
<P>
That scene lies at the heart of Steinbeck's message, that a man may not have a 
soul of his own, but instead may be part of one big soul. 
</P>
<P>
This message is reflected in Steppenwolf's commitment to elevate the work of 
the whole over that of the individuals. It's a commitment that gets 
increasingly tested since the early days when necessity was part of the glue 
that kept them together. 
</P>
<P>
"In the early days we would say half-jokingly that we stayed together because 
we were scared to audition," Perry said. "It was rare, it is rare, it shall 
always be rare for people to agree that what they can create together is 
greater than what they can create alone." 
</P>
<P>
Now that Perry, Sinise and Kinney are popping up as actors and directors on 
shows like "thirtysomething" and "Columbo," they have distanced themselves from 
the group's day-to-day decisions. In the last few years, they have moved from 
Chicago, home of Steppenwolf's 211-seat house. Perry and Sinise keep in contact 
by phone from Los Angeles and Kinney from New York, as plans are being made for 
a new 525-seat proscenium house that is scheduled to open in the fall of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
They all say they will remain part of the ensemble, even if the Hollywood doors 
open wider. 
</P>
<P>
"From a certain perspective they don't really need the company; from another 
perspective they desperately need it," said Galati, who keeps busy as a 
screenwriter, a professor at Northwestern University and associate artistic 
director of Chicago's Goodman Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"It meets an emotional and a spiritual need to work with this group of actors," 
he added. "There isn't a single person who isn't blessed by being in the 
company. Including myself. 
</P>
<P>
"The theater is such a torment. It's full of so many losses. Failure is such a 
part of the integral process; it is always just around the corner. In the face 
of that, this company offers the kind of bonding that settles in after many 
years of work and play. It's the kind of tensile strength that flows in the 
Joad family. It keeps us together even while we are flying apart."

SOVIET EMIGRES WIN PERMISSION TO BUILD BEVERLY HILLS HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After nearly a year of trying, Natalia and Leonid Glosman have won the right to 
build their dream house in Beverly Hills. It may be a little smaller than their 
dreams, perhaps, but it is still a far cry from the apartment that they left 
behind in the Soviet Union 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel exhausted. It's been a struggle but we're happy with the decision," 
said Natalia Glosman, who with her dentist-husband won the approval of the City 
Council Tuesday for the proposed French Baroque mansion in the heights above 
Coldwater Canyon Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The Glosman chateau will hardly be the biggest in Beverly Hills. But other 
residents said that three stories of 18th-Century opulence would be out of 
place in their neighborhood, which is largely made up of ranch-style homes 
measuring 3,000 to 4,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Months of Acrimony 
</P>
<P>
The result was months of acrimony, topped by an angry exchange before the city 
Planning Commission over whether working parents need a swimming pool and a 
tennis court so their children will not have to play in the street. 
</P>
<P>
In March, the Planning Commission voted to reject the proposal, which was then 
appealed to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's session was calmer, although planning commissioners showed some 
frustration as the City Council overruled their conclusion that the house would 
"materially and adversely change the scale, integrity and character of the 
area." 
</P>
<P>
By a 5-0 vote, the City Council said that construction could begin, although 
the size of the house would have to be reduced from 9,883 square feet to 8,883 
square feet, the tennis court would have to be replaced by a smaller court 
suitable for volleyball, and mature landscaping would have to be planted to 
hide the games court and the ground-level garage. 
</P>
<P>
"The result, although it was long in coming, is that a home is to be built 
which takes into account the concerns of the neighbors and also the interests 
of the family that wants to build the home and live there," said City 
Councilman Allan L. Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
He said the "excruciating time and effort" that went into the process shows 
that the city's hillside ordinance needs to be revised. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High-Priced Hills 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance was imposed last year in an effort to come to terms with a trend 
toward the construction of big houses in the high-priced hillside areas of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to develop more objective standards for hillside development, so that 
a person when he buys . . . in the hillsides, knows exactly the size of the 
house he can build, and it's not going to be left to the subjective 
determination of the Planning Commission, planning staff or the City Council," 
Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear they gave it to them lock, stock and barrel," said MeraLee Goldman, 
chairman of the Planning Commission, who did not attend the Tuesday session but 
was briefed by her colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
She said the Planning Commission labored through 13 versions of the plans for 
the proposed house in order to reach its conclusion, which was based on the 
requirements of the hillside ordinance. It requires that the scale, integrity 
and character of a neighborhood, the views of other residents, and other 
factors be taken into account in reviewing a project. 
</P>
<P>
"If the city is going to have good, caring, intelligent people working on its 
Planning Commission then there have to be appropriate directions from the City 
Council in advance on controversial issues so the Planning Commission can more 
efficiently do its job," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand frankly how the council reverses its planning commission's 
decision when the planning commission has followed its instructions and done a 
good job," Goldman said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the Planning Commission is scheduled to meet with the City Council 
next month to resolve their differences.

<P>
PROMENADE TO ALLOW CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time in 20 years, cars and trucks will be allowed along the Third 
Street Promenade, Santa Monica's downtown outdoor mall. 
</P>
<P>
The mall, which is undergoing extensive renovation, has until now been for 
pedestrians only. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday unanimously passed an ordinance that set the speed 
limit on the mall at 15 m.p.h. But members left for a future meeting the 
decision over the hours in which traffic will be permitted. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Carroll, director of Bayside District Corp., which manages the mall, 
recommended that traffic be prohibited from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. But council 
members proposed longer time periods during which only pedestrians would be 
allowed on the street. Councilwoman Judy Abdo suggested a 6 a.m.-to-6 p.m. 
period for foot traffic only. 
</P>
<P>
The council is expected to review staff suggestions in two weeks. If an 
ordinance passes then, traffic would be allowed on the Promenade a month later.

BUILDING MORATORIUM OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to complaints from residents over a surge in condominium 
construction, the City Council has passed a 45-day moratorium on residential 
building permits in a 14-block area north of Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the North of Wilshire Residents Group told the council on Tuesday 
night that their quality of life was deteriorating because of construction 
projects -- mostly condominiums -- that have brought traffic, noise, air 
pollution, dirt and litter to their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman David Finkel, who originally proposed the ordinance, said the 
moratorium will allow the council to "stop (construction) for the time being, 
step back, take a breath of fresh air and let the staff do its work" in coming 
up with solutions to the problems voiced by residents. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 5 to 1 to approve the emergency ordinance, with Councilman 
William H. Jennings absent and Councilwoman Christine Reed voting against it. 
Reed said she opposed the moratorium because no study had been conducted to 
show it was really necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium prohibits granting residential construction permits, including 
hotels and motels, retroactive to April 28. Low- and moderate-income housing 
and single-family homes are exempt from the moratorium. Also exempt is the 
rehabilitation or enlargement of existing buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The area affected is bordered by Ocean Avenue on the west, 14th Street on the 
east, Wilshire Boulevard on the south and Montana Avenue on the north. City 
planners said that, in a 26-month period starting in January, 1987, 
construction has been approved for more than 21 buildings containing 269 
residential units. In 1983-1986, only 93 units were built. 
</P>
<P>
The council scheduled a public hearing June 13 to decide whether to extend the 
moratorium for an additional 10 months and 15 days.

EDUCATORS SEARCH FOR WAYS TO HELP DRUG BABIES; 
</P>
<P>
PROGRAMS NEEDED FOR CHILDREN WHOSE SKILLS OFTEN LAG BEHIND CLASSMATES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A day-old infant goes "cold turkey," shivering and thrashing as his tiny body 
convulses during drug withdrawal. The infant, who appeared in a videotape, is 
one of 16,000 babies in Los Angeles County born each year to women addicted to 
drugs, health experts said. 
</P>
<P>
Although these children may often look healthy by the time they enter school, 
studies have shown that their motor and language skills and physical 
development can lag behind that of their peers, according to speakers at a 
seminar recently sponsored by the Arcadia Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
The seminar, which examined the effects of perinatal exposure to drugs on young 
children, attracted more than 150 education and health professionals interested 
in developing special programs to help those children. 
</P>
<P>
Such concerns are growing as drug abuse continues to rise in the United States. 
The number of illicit drug users nationwide increased from 33% of the 
population in 1982 to 37% in 1985, according to the National Institute on Drug 
Abuse. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Existing Programs 
</P>
<P>
State health department statistics show that in 1988, 375,000 babies, 5% to 10% 
of those born nationwide, were exposed to drugs while in the womb. 
</P>
<P>
The percentage is higher -- 11% -- for babies born to "high-risk" mothers, 
which includes women who had no prenatal care and those with a history of drug 
abuse, according to the National Assn. for Perinatal Addiction Research and 
Evaluation in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"We know in time these kids will come to our school district," said Diana 
Wright, a psychologist for the Arcadia Unified School District and one of the 
seminar's organizers. Wright, a member of the district's preschool assessment 
team, said she and her colleagues need to learn how to identify drug-exposed 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"Are they retarded?" Wright asked. "Do they have hand-eye coordination 
problems?" 
</P>
<P>
"We want to look at what services they actually need and use existing programs 
to meet their needs," said Nancy Gronroos, also a district psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unexpected Attendance 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, 60% to 80% of the more than 8,000 children who are 
dependents of the courts were born to substance-abusing mothers, said Marie 
Poulsen, a seminar speaker and director of training and education for 
Children's Hospital in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Although a majority of mothers who use drugs are poor, she said, the problem of 
drug babies cuts across socioeconomic lines. 
</P>
<P>
The urgency facing educators was underscored by the number of people who 
attended the seminar -- five times what organizers had expected. Psychologists, 
teachers, nurses and speech pathologists from a dozen communities including 
Alhambra, Duarte, El Monte and Pasadena all showed up in search of information 
and advice. 
</P>
<P>
Demand for information has been so great that the State Department of Education 
is planning a weeklong summer workshop for teams of educators and social 
service professionals, said Linda Brekken, who is in charge of personnel 
development for the education department's infant-preschool program. 
</P>
<P>
There were also some non-professionals at the seminar. Caroline Mraz is a South 
Pasadena foster mother who is raising seven children, all of them drug babies. 
She said she wanted to find out what special help schools can offer her 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"It scares me that these teachers and psychologists don't know how to deal with 
them," Mraz said. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles teacher Carol Cole cited her experiences as an example of what 
can be done. 
</P>
<P>
Cole teaches a special class in the Los Angeles Unified School District's pilot 
program for children prenatally exposed to drugs. Under the program, which is 
in its second year, three classes of preschoolers are observed by a team of 
teachers, psychologists and physicians. 
</P>
<P>
Cole said she is sharing her observations and strategies with other educators 
all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
Children who were drug babies may have problems with their motor or language 
skills, Cole said. They may walk into walls or their hands may tremble when 
they try to pour a glass of milk. They may also suffer extremes in behavior, 
ranging from apathy to aggressive outbursts, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Many times, the solution can be as simple as helping a child steady his hand or 
spending the time to find out what the child wants but for some reason cannot 
express, she said. When voice commands do not seem to register with a child, 
Cole makes eye contact and addresses a child by name before speaking. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to teach teachers that, unless a child's needs are consistently 
met over a period of time, they are not going to be interested in meeting 
someone else's needs," Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
Cole also described what teachers in the pilot program call "sporadic mastery" 
among former drug babies. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a child may be excited about learning to tie his shoes one day and 
"simply not know how to do it on a given Wednesday." 
</P>
<P>
To keep tantrums under control, Cole has taught the children that, if they are 
unhappy about something, they should say, "I'm having a hard time and I need 
help." The strategy has proven popular with the children, all of whom want to 
be the one to help their classmates, she said.

TENANTS TRICKED, FIND THEMSELVES OUT IN COLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
When her landlord promised Josephine Shields $4,000 if she would vacate her 
run-down apartment in San Pedro, she packed up her belongings and, with her 
three children, moved in March to a room in a motel on Pacific Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
She didn't expect to stay more than a night. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Shields family is still living at the Imperial Inn, paying $44 a 
night -- a sum Shields cannot afford on her monthly public assistance check. 
Her former landlord, convicted slumlord Martin Cantor, acknowledges that he has 
not kept his promise to provide relocation money. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Similar Predicaments 
</P>
<P>
Three other families -- all former tenants of Cantor and former neighbors of 
the Shields family -- are in similar predicaments. They and Shields wound up 
with no homes and no relocation money after taking the advice of a legal aid 
foundation in their dealings with Cantor. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't work," acknowledged Toby Rothschild, executive director of the Legal 
Aid Foundation in Long Beach, which represented the tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Shields wishes she had followed her initial instincts. "I kept telling (the 
other tenants), 'Do not make a move until you get your money,' " she recalled 
last week. "I was right." 
</P>
<P>
Shields said she moved out expecting to use some of the $4,000 as a deposit on 
another apartment. Instead, she has stayed at the motel, using money borrowed 
from friends and $210 a week in county emergency aid to the homeless to help 
pay her motel bill. The homeless aid ended after three weeks, although she 
continues to receive a monthly check of $663 in Aid to Families with Dependent 
Children. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dee Petty, a counselor at Toberman Settlement House, a San Pedro social 
service agency: "These people moved in good faith. They gave up their homes and 
they've been homeless and out of a lot of money. Josephine has paid more than 
$1,000 for a hotel, and that's $1,000 she does not have." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deny Charges 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview last week, Cantor said he changed his mind about 
paying his tenants $4,000 apiece because "they trashed the building" -- a 
charge they deny -- and because he believes that Los Angeles municipal law 
provides for evicted tenants to receive only $2,000 in relocation assistance. 
</P>
<P>
But that is not necessarily the case, according to Anna Ortega, the city's 
assistant director of rent stabilization. Although most tenants who live alone 
are due only $2,000, Ortega said that a disabled tenant, a tenant over 62, or 
one with a dependent is due $5,000 in relocation money. 
</P>
<P>
Juana Webman, the deputy city attorney who prosecuted Cantor, said she believes 
that Cantor offered immediate payment and the promise of his cooperation to get 
tenants to move out right away. 
</P>
<P>
Under the city's eviction law, a landlord must serve tenants with a 30-day 
notice of eviction and pay relocation money within 15 days of the notice. As an 
alternative, a landlord may give notice but place the relocation funds in a 
trust account with the money going to the tenant by the date of the move. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's so very, very sad," she said. "These people have lived in 
deplorable situations and conditions for a long time. This money would have 
enabled them to relocate effectively, and they can't do it." 
</P>
<P>
The tenants' battles with Cantor began last year, when they complained to the 
Los Angeles County Health Department about conditions at their apartment 
building at 2319 S. Pacific Ave. in San Pedro. Inspectors checked the building 
and found cockroaches, rats, a leaky roof, faulty wiring and "a hole the size 
of a bathtub, filled with sewage water," said Webman, who presented the 
evidence in court. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the findings, Cantor was charged with violating his probation on 
a previous conviction involving slum conditions at three houses he owned in 
Wilmington. The Rancho Palos Verdes resident was sentenced Jan. 11 to spend 120 
days under house arrest in one of his San Pedro apartments and told to fix up 
the apartment building. He was permitted to leave the apartment during the 
week, but only to work at the liquor store his father owns in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
But Cantor violated the terms of his house arrest by going to work on a 
Saturday. On March 15, San Pedro Municipal Judge Roy Ferkich extended the term 
of the house arrest by 30 days and also ruled that Cantor would go to jail for 
a minimum of 45 days at the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Report to the Court 
</P>
<P>
According to Ferkich's order, Cantor must report to the court June 27. If he 
has fixed up his property or sold it by then, and could show proof that he had 
given his tenants money to help them relocate, he would spend 45 days in jail. 
If not, he would serve 180 days. 
</P>
<P>
Webman said that if Cantor does not pay the relocation assistance by June 27, 
as the court order requires, she will ask Judge Ferkich to sentence him to jail 
for the full 180 days. 
</P>
<P>
According to Cantor, Petty and Rothschild, this is what happened after Ferkich 
ruled in March: 
</P>
<P>
Cantor, wanting to get out of the rental business, found a buyer for his 
building. But the sale -- Cantor would not disclose the price -- could not go 
through as long as the building was occupied. So Cantor asked the tenants to 
move. 
</P>
<P>
David Salisbury, the legal aid lawyer representing the tenants, struck a deal 
with Cantor: The tenants would move out on March 30 -- the day before escrow 
was to close on the building. In turn, Cantor would authorize the escrow agent 
to pay each family $4,000 out of the proceeds from the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Documents supplied by Petty show that Cantor signed an agreement with the legal 
aid foundation to this effect and that he also signed escrow instructions 
authorizing the payment to the tenants. Cantor acknowledges signing the 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
Based on Salisbury's assurances, the tenants moved out March 30, expecting to 
get their money the following day. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, escrow took an additional four weeks to close, leaving the tenants to 
find homes without relocation money. Some moved in with relatives. Others 
borrowed money to help them move, expecting they would be able to repay their 
debts when the sale of Cantor's building became final. 
</P>
<P>
But by the time escrow closed, Cantor acknowledged, he had changed the escrow 
instructions so that the money from the sale would go directly to him. Because 
the tenants were not a party to the sale, they did not learn of the change 
until Cantor had already received the money. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so dumbfounded," said Petty, who has been an informal adviser to the 
tenants. "All of this was in writing and was signed, sealed and delivered by 
the attorney and Martin Cantor." 
</P>
<P>
When asked why he changed the escrow instructions, Cantor exploded verbally. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should they get $4,000?" he thundered. "Why should I agree to $4,000? Ask 
yourself if I was in a corner or if I had any way out. . . . There's no way 
out. It's a nightmare and there's no way out." 
</P>
<P>
Salisbury, the legal aid lawyer, could not be reached. Rothschild, who got 
involved when the deal fell apart, said he now has second thoughts about the 
way his office handled the case. 
</P>
<P>
"In hindsight would I have done it differently? I think so," Rothschild said. 
"But that doesn't mean that what we did at the time we did it was wrong. . . . 
I don't feel good about it. I wish things had turned out differently, but they 
hadn't." 
</P>
<P>
Ortega, the rent stabilization official, said that if Ferkich's threat to 
lengthen Cantor's jail term doesn't induce him to pay his former tenants, they 
must file a complaint with her agency, or sue Cantor in civil or small claims 
court. But she was not optimistic. "It's harder to get the tenant relocation 
assistance once they've moved out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Shields, meanwhile, has discovered that she cannot find a suitable apartment in 
San Pedro for the amount she was paying Cantor, $475 a month. She said others 
should learn from her experience. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than moving "into a building that's shabby or no good, think about it," 
she advised. "It's worth paying a little more money to keep from going through 
the hell I'm going through."

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE

<P>
Free-Mail Issue 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 174 to 231, the House defeated legislation (HR 1149) allowing 
members of Congress to mail copies of the Constitution bearing their name to 
all households back home. The bill sought to ease franking, or free mail, rules 
to permit the one-time mass mailing at a projected cost of $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Lindy Boggs (D-La.) said the mailing would be "a great service to all 
of the people of the United States" in the bicentennial year of the Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.) called the bill "another congressional 
boondoggle . . . another chance to make ourselves look good at our 
constituents' expense." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the bill.

The 1990 Budget 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 263 to 157, the House approved a fiscal 1990 congressional budget 
resolution that envisions $1.17 trillion in spending, $1.07 trillion in 
revenues and a deficit of about $99.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The measure (HR 106) will guide House and Senate action on individual spending 
bills for the year beginning Oct. 1, and prod Congress toward 
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit-reduction goals. It also states congressional and 
presidential priorities for defense, foreign and domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
Lacking major tax increases or spending cuts, the House budget was widely 
viewed as a status quo plan that repeats the congressional pattern of pushing 
tough fiscal decisions into the next year. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) voiced support of the measure even though "we lacked 
the political will on both sides of the aisle to bite the bullet." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Bill Schuette (R-Mich.) called the plan "a cover-up for inaction, 
postponing for tomorrow . . . real deficit reduction." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the fiscal 1990 budget plan.

Budget Freeze 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 30 to 393, the House rejected a budget substitute seeking greater 
deficit reduction primarily at the expense of domestic programs. The amendment 
by Rep. John Kasich(R-Ohio) sought a 1990 deficit of $91.1 billion rather than 
the $99.7 billion targeted by the congressional budget resolution (above). It 
sought to curb Medicare outlays and block inflation-adjusted increases in 
certain non-entitlement domestic programs, and reaffirmed the defense spending 
freeze already a part of the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the substitute.

Oil Import Fee

The House voted 49 to 373 to reject an alternative fiscal 1990 budget, proposed 
by Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) that sought to increase federal revenue by $9 
billion annually by levying a fee on imported oil. About $3.2 billion of the 
yield was to have been applied to deficit reduction and the remainder to 
domestic initiatives such as anti-drug and anti-poverty programs.

SUITS FORCE MOUNTAIN GEAR FIRM TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While Yvon Chouinard may be best known for founding Patagonia, the 
Ventura-based distributor of outdoor clothing, the seeds of his $70-million 
empire were in the functional climbing gear he first fashioned in the early 
1960s in a metalworking shed in his parents' back yard. 
</P>
<P>
Chouinard Equipment Ltd. posted only $6 million in sales last year. But it was 
the industry leader, buoyed by the reputations of its high-performance gear and 
its high-profile founder, who has spent months at a time climbing treacherous 
ice in Antarctica or scaling Himalayan peaks without taking oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
So industry observers were surprised last month when the firm announced that it 
was filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials claimed that the firm's finances were sound but said that 
pending lawsuits and the rising cost of liability insurance prompted the move. 
</P>
<P>
"I've taken a lot of pride in making the world's best climbing equipment and 
trying to do a good job at it, but times have changed," Chouinard said this 
week. "Nobody wants to take responsibility for their actions, to say, 'I 
screwed up, it's my fault, I didn't bother to learn how to use the gear.' " 
</P>
<P>
Company officials said that four lawsuits blame Chouinard for injuries 
allegedly caused by inadequate instructions and warnings on climbing harnesses 
and other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Chouinard denies the allegations. Officials of Lost Arrow, the umbrella firm 
that runs Patagonia, Chouinard Equipment and several other companies, declined 
to identify the plaintiffs, or to say where or when the suits had been filed. 
</P>
<P>
"No equipment failed and no equipment broke, but when people get hurt . . . 
they sue," said Kevin Sweeney, a Lost Arrow spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Chouinard said that none of the lawsuits were filed by experienced climbers. 
They were filed by beginners in climbing school, a window washer and an actor 
who used the equipment on stage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lost Arrow officials, who donate 10% of pretax profits to climbing and 
environmental causes, said they aren't trying to evade their responsibilities 
or liabilities. They said they are trying to ensure the company's survival. 
</P>
<P>
They want to sever ties with Chouinard Equipment because they fear that Lost 
Arrow's $70 million in assets could be attached if a lawsuit against the 
mountaineering subsidiary succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Lost Arrow is trying to sell Chouinard Equipment. Lost Arrow 
officials hope Chouinard's 70 employees will be able to raise the money to buy 
the company themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"It definitely sets a precedent in the industry," said George Bracksieck, 
editor of Rock and Ice, a climbing magazine based in Boulder, Colo. "People 
have sued over equipment failure before, but this is the first time one of the 
major manufacturers of equipment has taken Chapter 11 because of suits." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
300 Trips Dropped 
</P>
<P>
The increasing number of lawsuits and rising liability insurance costs already 
have put mountaineers between a rock and a hard place. Last October, liability 
concerns prompted the Sierra Club to drop all club-sponsored climbing trips 
requiring ropes or ice axes. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Sierra Club chapter has dismantled part of its popular 
mountaineering training course and dropped 300 mountaineering trips from its 
extensive program of outings. 
</P>
<P>
Some outdoor equipment business people fear that manufacturers and consumers 
stand to lose if the suits against Chouinard succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have a chilling effect on the climbing industry," said Michael 
Kennedy, editor of Climbing, a magazine based in Carbondale, Colo. "The 
equipment won't be as good, and people won't have the money to do testing and 
development. You'll end up with a lot of smaller, fly-by-night companies." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the industry, climbing aficionados and business people say that 
while more people are climbing today than ever before, mountaineering remains a 
high-risk sport with inherent dangers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Firms 
</P>
<P>
"You can have the best equipment, but if you're high off the ground and make an 
error, you can get killed pretty easily, and I think that needs to be 
emphasized," Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
Chouinard is one of only a few firms to file for Chapter 11 in the wake of 
pending lawsuits. Johns Manville, which manufactured asbestos, and A. H. 
Robins, which made the Dalkon shield, an intrauterine device that caused severe 
medical problems for some women, filed for reorganization in two 
well-publicized cases. 
</P>
<P>
Legal experts said Chouinard might be making a smart move. 
</P>
<P>
"Filing Chapter 11 is not something that is socially reprehensible," said 
Kenneth N. Klee, a UCLA law school professor who helped draft the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code. "They could be doing two socially progressive things: Keeping 
the business intact while they find out if they are liable and keeping their 
employees in jobs while they litigate this issue." 
</P>
<P>
'Genuine Problem' 
</P>
<P>
"They're being pretty straightforward," agreed Chris Hughes, editor of 
Specialty News, a Bend, Ore., trade newsletter for the outdoor industry. "It's 
a genuine problem for the whole outdoor industry." 
</P>
<P>
Lost Arrow officials hope that the sale of Chouinard to its employees or 
another owner might help to discourage further lawsuits and reduce liability 
insurance costs. 
</P>
<P>
They added that Lost Arrow would retain responsibility for lawsuits filed 
against products sold before the ownership transfer. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, many who are familiar with Chouinard said the filing signifies the 
end of an era. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sweeney: "The company's roots were in hardware gear and to sever those 
roots does cause sadness around here."

MORE SPENDING FOR HEALTH SUPPORTED IN POLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAIRE SPIEGEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A majority of Californians want to see additional government funding of health 
care programs for the poor and are personally willing to pay more taxes to 
support these services, according to a new Gallup Poll commissioned by state 
hospital executives. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly nine out of 10 Californians believe that employers should be required to 
provide basic health insurance for their employees, and about 75% said the 
federal government should develop "some form of national health insurance 
program for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
More than 80% believe that additional revenue generated by the state's new 
tobacco tax initiative, Proposition 99, should be used to improve health care 
programs, not to fund other state services, as proposed by Gov. George 
Deukmejian. And, when asked to rate the governor's overall performance on 
health care issues, more people disapproved (36%) than approved (28%), with the 
remainder undecided. 
</P>
<P>
These were some of the findings of a wide-ranging annual poll that hospital 
executives said they commissioned in order "to take the temperature" of 
Californians on a variety of health concerns ranging from personal health 
habits to political views. The poll results were released Wednesday in Los 
Angeles at the offices of the Hospital Council of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The most significant trend that emerged, council Vice President David Langness 
said, is that "Californians are beginning to be more and more aware and 
concerned about the health of the entire state, not just their own . . . and 
they are enormously concerned about health care for the poor." 
</P>
<P>
The poll comes at a time when Deukmejian has proposed statewide reductions in 
health services, including a huge reduction in the amount of money Los Angeles 
County receives for medically indigent patients -- from $204 million to $56 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The state's health care crunch was expected to be somewhat relieved by the 
recent passage of Proposition 99, which raised taxes on cigarettes and other 
tobacco products. The additional $625 million that will be raised in the 
upcoming budget year was expected to be spent on new health care programs, but 
Deukmejian in January proposed spending most of the money on other financially 
strapped state services. 
</P>
<P>
"Californians do not want this money to be hijacked by the governor and used 
for other purposes," Langness said. About 82% of the 1,000 people queried by 
telephone in April said the money should be used to finance new health care 
programs, as the proposition intended. "That's a very high percentage," 
Langness said, "especially considering that only 58% of the people voted for 
Proposition 99 in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles) said the poll results "send a very 
clear message to Gov. Deukmejian that his health care policies are completely 
out of step with public opinion in California." 
</P>
<P>
Margolin said that the poll should also put the business community on alert 
that there is "clear support" for a requirement that employers provide basic 
health insurance for their employees. 
</P>
<P>
But several Orange County legislators were not so impressed. "You have to 
wonder how the questions were phrased," said Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport 
Beach). "I found it rather surprising politically in light of local elections, 
school bond issues that were turned down decisively." 
</P>
<P>
Added Assemblyman Nolan Frizzelle (R-Huntington Beach): "Do they know what 
they're paying now? . . . I don't think they're informed as to what we provide 
already." Frizzelle, who is an optometrist, said he thought "when push comes to 
shove and it comes out of their own pocketbook . . . they probably wouldn't do 
it (vote for an additional tax for health care)." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, health care experts in Orange County were delighted by the poll. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Walter Henry, vice chancellor of health services at UC Irvine, said he was 
gratified that "people are so compassionate" on the subject of indigent care 
and glad that so many realized that "there is a gap between what it costs to 
provide medical care and what the medical agency receives in payment for that 
medical care." (UCI's deficit-ridden medical center currently cares for half of 
the county's poor patients.) 
</P>
<P>
And Vicki Mayster, vice chair of the Orange County Task Force on Indigent Care, 
said she was delighted that so many people indicated that they are willing to 
be taxed for health care. "I say 'Amen' to that," Mayster said. "Now what we 
need is a way to get people organized in ways that our Legislature will hear it 
and take action. That's so often where the problem comes. That's where the gap 
is." 
</P>
<P>
The poll found that 65% of Californians believe government is paying too little 
money to hospitals to care for the treatment of senior citizens on Medicare, 
and 60% feel there is insufficient funding to help defray the cost of treating 
people with no medical insurance of any sort. 
</P>
<P>
About 80% said they believe that it is the government's responsibility to pay 
for medical care for people who cannot afford it, and 53% said they would 
personally be willing to pay up to $38 per month in additional taxes for this 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
If cutting back on other government programs were the only way to finance 
health care for the poor, 35% said that defense and military spending should be 
cut. 
</P>
<P>
If priorities had to be set singling out the neediest group for care, 41% said 
that children should be ranked at the top and 19% pointed to the elderly. 
Pregnant women, the disabled, the homeless, and mentally ill followed, in 
descending order. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what is the single most important threat to Californians today, 25% of 
the respondents ranked pollution at the top. Pollution of the air, water and 
general environment was ranked as the biggest threat statewide, with AIDS a 
close second. Only 7% of respondents ranked substance abuse and cancer as the 
biggest threat.

WALKOUT: DILEMMA FOR SOME TEACHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN and MARCIDA DODSON, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once teachers come to work at Walker Junior High in La Palma, say those who 
teach there, they tend to stay forever. 
</P>
<P>
Here at Walker, which was named a Distinguished California School in 1985, 
teachers spend some of their spare time raising money to buy computers for math 
labs. For many, Walker is the only place they have ever worked. And they say 
they would never dream of going anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
But on Wednesday, when the teachers union in the Anaheim Union High School 
District staged a 1-day strike, all but one of Walker's 34 teachers put aside 
school loyalty and joined more than 650 other picketing teachers. 
</P>
<P>
When the strike was called last week after 14 months of growing frustration 
over working without a contract, Walker teachers said they found themselves 
faced with a decision they never imagined they would have to make: whether or 
not to strike. 
</P>
<P>
"This is hard, very hard," said Linda Carter, who has taught at Walker since 
graduating from the University of Nebraska in 1964. "I come from a union 
family, and this is still hard." 
</P>
<P>
Carter and many other picketing teachers at Walker and other district schools 
spoke of their personal dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
Carter said she recalled the time in her youth when her father's union went on 
strike against an auto manufacturer, and he stayed off his job for 8 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
But when the strike vote came in the Anaheim school district, Carter said the 
choice that she thought had come easily to her pro-union father was difficult 
for his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"I called and told him, 'Daddy, I don't know if I can do this,' " she related. 
</P>
<P>
In several conversations, she said he told her why he believed in an employee's 
right to strike. On Wednesday, Carter proudly wore her "Day of the Teacher, I 
walked in '89" yellow ribbon on her sweat shirt that read "Walker, 
Distinguished School." 
</P>
<P>
Some teachers said Wednesday that they decided to go out on strike even though 
they didn't agree with the tactics because there was a lesson in it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think today's the worst day of my career," said Ed Craig, a band teacher at 
Orangeview Junior High School in Anaheim who walked the picket line despite 
having voted against the strike. 
</P>
<P>
"But I belong to the association and I believe if you belong to any group, you 
should follow its rules," explained the veteran of 24 years of teaching. 
"That's what I teach my kids in band." 
</P>
<P>
George Peterson, who teaches English and oversees the yearbook staff at Kennedy 
High School in La Palma, said: "A couple of teachers were crying to me on the 
phone (Tuesday night) because they didn't know whether they could do this or 
not. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say all the teachers I know, even the bad ones, are in the profession 
because they want to help kids," he said. "We're certainly not here for the 
money." 
</P>
<P>
One sympathetic teacher spent Tuesday night inside Western High School in 
Anaheim so that he would not have to cross the picket line Wednesday morning, 
according to Dan Saling, a field consultant with the California Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"The association understood his position," Saling said, explaining that the 
untenured teacher did not strike because he would have put his job at risk. 
</P>
<P>
Another teacher at Western, Don Crosby, said he had resigned Wednesday as an 
assistant football coach out of dismay that fellow coaches did not join the 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
"They talk about teamwork, then they cross the picket line," said Crosby, who 
also teaches business and has been with the district 23 years. "They bailed out 
on the team (of teachers) this morning." 
</P>
<P>
Even substitute teachers found themselves torn by loyalties. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin Tweedy, a retired teacher from Whittier Union High School District who 
filled in Wednesday as a substitute at Brookhurst Junior High in Anaheim, said 
he did not realize he would be called during the strike when he recently signed 
up to substitute. He wanted to work, he said, only to fulfill state 
requirements to keep his teaching certificate valid. 
</P>
<P>
"I have mixed emotions about it," Tweedy said of his day's assignment. "If I 
stopped to think about it, I might not be here."

STRIKE PROMPTS MANY STUDENTS TO STAY OUT OF CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Classes had only been under way an hour Wednesday when Tom Stuart pulled his 
14-year-old son out of Western High School in Anaheim. It wasn't that Stuart 
was worried about his youngster's safety during a daylong teacher strike or 
even that he was disappointed in the day's lesson plan. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart wanted his son to be able to join his instructors on the picket line, 
without reprisal. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't see my son being taught by what I call scabs pulling $180 while the 
others out here are trying to get more money," Stuart, a truck driver from 
Buena Park, said as he carried a picket sign with his son, Tom, and the 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's first strike in Anaheim Union High School District's history of 
more than 90 years forced teachers, administrators, students and parents to 
deal with a less-than-normal school day featuring security guards, substitute 
teachers and, in many cases, empty classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Scenes varied from campus to campus. While well-behaved pupils studied quietly 
at Brookhurst Junior High in Anaheim, students walked out of several high 
schools to show support for teachers, or just to play hooky. 
</P>
<P>
At Western High School, senior Brian Starkey was one of several students who 
casually strayed out of an economics class along the campus' edge to chat with 
striking teachers. His substitute teacher, he said, "is just sitting there, not 
doing a damn thing." He and other students milling about said their substitutes 
made no attempt to teach, and some were rude to the students, they said. 
Starkey said his substitute gave the students material to read "and then 
everybody got paper wads and threw them at her." 
</P>
<P>
Asked one teacher watching the unruly students, "This is the district's view of 
a safe learning environment?" 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, about 200 students streamed out of classrooms, marching 
around the campus to pick up additional followers before joining teachers on 
the picket line in a show of support. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not just a day out of school for us; this is a fight," said Ginny 
Hard, a 16-year-old junior at Western. Added another student: "We wouldn't be 
here (in the picket line at school) at all if we didn't care." 
</P>
<P>
Soon afterward, a school administrator walked past classrooms, closing doors 
that provided views of the strikers. According to the district, 596 of the 
campus' 1,300 students were truant. 
</P>
<P>
Hal Kough, a striking economics teacher whose students were observed wandering 
in and out of the classroom, said he left a detailed lesson plan for the 
substitute. "What they (students) are doing is not what I would call 
accomplishing the lesson. . . . The fact that they are outside is because of a 
lack of substitute supervision, not a lack of educational material." 
</P>
<P>
At Cypress High School, 431 of the campus' 1,400 students reported to school 
Wednesday morning, according to the district, but about 200 of those soon left. 
Students reportedly also left several other high schools. However, all campuses 
remained open throughout the day, according to district officials. 
</P>
<P>
At Loara High School, two-thirds of the 1,600 students were truant, according 
to district figures. And some of those who went to class said they didn't learn 
much. 
</P>
<P>
"They just baby-sat us," said Katherine Lo, a 15-year-old sophomore. "We just 
all goofed off and the (substitutes) just stared at us hopelessly." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Finch, 15, who was leaving Loara after school with Lo, said he had 
attended his classes because he wanted to "see what was going on," unlike 
classmates who had gone because their parents made them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Didn't Learn Anything' 
</P>
<P>
Although both Finch and Lo said they supported the strike, they felt the day 
was really a waste. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually nobody should have come today, because we really didn't learn 
anything," Finch said. But he said he was glad the teachers were on strike. 
"They deserve better, especially at the high school level where they have to go 
through so much junk." 
</P>
<P>
But other students expressed anger that the strike was interfering with their 
course work. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure they need more money, but what about us?" said Jennifer Chestnut, 17. "We 
have to learn." The junior said she spent one of her class periods filling in a 
coloring book. 
</P>
<P>
Another junior, Lisa McGinnis, 16, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"The teachers should negotiate on their own time and not take it out on us." 
</P>
<P>
At a fast-food restaurant across from Anaheim High School, about 10 boys hung 
out, debating where to go next. All said they had "ditched" their classes at 
the school at varying times during the school day, and now were anxious to move 
on. 
</P>
<P>
"During second period a lot of the juniors and seniors walked out, so we did 
too," said Roy Morales, 16, a sophomore. According to the district, 48% of the 
school's 2,000 students did not attend classes Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The boys discussed whether they backed the teachers, but soon the subject was 
where to go next. "Let's go check out Katella" High School, said one. 
</P>
<P>
When they got there, they saw a big marquee that announced, "Day of the 
Teacher, May 10." Under it, teachers with signs were marching around in a 
circle. 
</P>
<P>
The boys drove on. 
</P>
<P>
Students at junior high schools appeared more willing to stay on campus and 
study. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Calm, Cool, Collected' 
</P>
<P>
At Brookhurst Junior High, students quietly worked on science assignments, 
watched films on chemistry and discussed economics, all under the supervision 
of substitute teachers. No students wandered about on campus. 
</P>
<P>
"We're calm, cool and collected," said Principal Ken McKee. According to 
district figures, Brookhurst was one of the least impacted campuses, with 70% 
of the students accounted for, and 31 of 42 teachers on strike. 
</P>
<P>
McKee said the teachers left good lesson plans and no substitutes had to rely 
on the district's backup educational materials. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a good day. I'm proud of the whole outfit, the teacher substitutes, 
the kids, the clerical help," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brookhurst Assistant Principal Elizabeth Thom said several substitutes 
commented that they initially were apprehensive about the day, but were pleased 
at the organization. 
</P>
<P>
"One said it was nice to teach, not just baby-sit or show movies," Thom said. 
</P>
<P>
In front of Orangeview Junior High before school began, several students who 
were asked what they planned to do during the day shouted in unison, "Nothing!" 
They also talked about walking off campus to show their support for their 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
But a striking teacher who overheard told them they had better stay at their 
desks. 
</P>
<P>
"You guys can't go on a picket line," teacher Ed Craig told them. "Your place 
is in school."

MEASURE A VOTING SEEN AS GAUGE OF ANTI-TAX FEELING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Capistrano Unified School District's proposed property tax increase for school 
construction, which failed to get the necessary two-thirds majority at the 
polls Tuesday, was defeated by slow-growth and anti-tax sentiments, observers 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the fact that a 52.2% majority did vote for Measure A, the southern Orange 
County school district's proposal to raise $85 million over 25 years, may 
signal a weakening of Orange County's anti-tax fervor, some political activists 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of a proposed half-cent countywide sales tax for transportation 
improvements said they were encouraged by the results of Tuesday's election, 
because such a sales tax requires only a majority vote and public opinion 
surveys rate traffic as the county's worst problem. 
</P>
<P>
The election results demonstrate that "voters in Orange County are willing to 
have a tax increase if they're convinced that the bureaucrats won't use it for 
whatever little projects they have in their back pockets," said Eileen Padberg, 
an Irvine-based political consultant. 
</P>
<P>
But Sheila Benecke, who chaired the campaign in favor of Capistrano Unified's 
Measure A, said Tuesday's school tax defeat indicates that voters still have a 
"misperception that if you have inadequate, severely impacted schools, you can 
discourage growth." 
</P>
<P>
Measure A, which would have created a special tax district known as a 
Mello-Roos district, was widely viewed as a test to determine who will bear the 
future financial burden of school construction in the severely overcrowded 
district, which stretches from Laguna Niguel to San Clemente and includes much 
of fast-growing southern Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The final tally from Tuesday's balloting was 52.2% voting "yes" to 47.8% voting 
"no," according to the Orange County registrar of voters. About 20.5% of the 
district's 96,521 registered voters went to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
School Supt. Jerome Thornsley said the district is considering year-round 
schools, busing and other strategies for coping with Measure A's defeat. He 
also said the district, whose student population of about 22,500 is projected 
to grow by more than a third in the next 5 years, probably will return to 
voters next year with a similar ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would have raised property taxes $100 a year on existing 
single-family homes and $60 a year on existing condominiums, apartments and 
mobile homes. Future single-family homes would have been taxed an extra $200 a 
year as part of the plan to raise $85 million over 25 years. Some opponents 
criticized the measure because it also would have cut by 50% the fees 
developers are required to pay for schools. 
</P>
<P>
Thornsley blamed Measure A's defeat on voters' "no-growth" philosophy and a 
belief that school improvements encourage new housing construction. He also 
cited a belief held by some voters that only new home buyers should pay for new 
school facilities. "It's a narrow, selfish vision," he said. "The educational 
level of our citizens affects all of us." 
</P>
<P>
Benecke, chairwoman of Schools for Kids, the committee that campaigned on 
behalf of Measure A, said her group spent more than $80,000. Campaign finance 
reports filed at the county registrar's office showed several large 
contributions from developers, including the Santa Margarita Co., Mission Viejo 
Co. and The Lusk Co. 
</P>
<P>
Benecke said it may take a "crisis atmosphere" for the school district tax plan 
to gain a two-thirds majority, and such a climate was lacking in Tuesday's 
balloting. 
</P>
<P>
Thornsley and Benecke said Wednesday that they doubt a two-thirds vote is 
possible for any tax measure in Orange County, where few tax increases have won 
voter approval. Thornsley said he will support legislation in Sacramento aimed 
at reducing the requirement, perhaps to a majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who oppose only need to get 34%. . . . A 'no' vote is actually 
worth two 'yes' votes in this kind of election, and that's not equal 
representation," Thornsley said. "The majority's will gets frustrated by the 
minority." 
</P>
<P>
He challenged opponents of Measure A to come up with their own ballot measure 
to help fund needed school improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to San Juan Capistrano rancher Tom Rogers and his neighbor, Russ 
Burkett, who campaigned against the measure, Thornsley said: "They always say 
'no.' You never see them come here with an alternate plan." 
</P>
<P>
Rogers of San Juan Capistrano said the measure's defeat stemmed from 
slow-growth sentiment and the fact that it would have reduced some developer 
fees by 50%, thus "letting them off the hook." He said Wednesday that he might 
have supported the measure if developers would have been required to pass their 
savings from reduced fees on to new home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
School officials and developers, however, argued that new home buyers already 
pay taxes for schools, and improvements are needed in parts of the district 
where little or no new development is occurring. 
</P>
<P>
Burkett said he favors splitting the sprawling district into smaller units, 
each of which would deal with their own financial problems related to growth. 
He also said that officials have been too lax in pursuing available state 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
Both men saw Tuesday's results as a negative sign for proponents of the 
half-cent sales tax for transportation improvements -- a measure that so far 
both intend to oppose. Rogers and Burkett helped lead the opposition to a 
similar 1-cent tax that Orange County voters rejected by a margin of more than 
2-to-1 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had 2 more days to campaign, we would have defeated the school tax by 
65%," Rogers boasted. He noted that opponents spent only about $1,000 and 
distributed campaign literature by hand, not by mail. 
</P>
<P>
In March, voters in the Westminster School District soundly rejected a proposed 
property tax increase for schools. Only 26.5% of the city's voters favored the 
added $100-per-parcel tax for school improvements. Opponents there had argued 
that they pay enough taxes already and more money should come from the state. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike the Westminster balloting, Capistrano Unified's was a so-called 
Mello-Roos election, which involved creation of a special assessment district. 
Such districts have been set up throughout the county to help finance new 
public facilities such as roads, libraries and police and fire service. But in 
Orange County, Mello-Roos districts have been created only in cases where 
development had not yet occurred, and only the landowners needed to approve 
them. As development occurs later, bonds sold by the districts are then repaid 
from homeowner assessments. 
</P>
<P>
There have been 32 Mello-Roos voter (not landowner) elections in California 
since the Mello-Roos law took effect on Jan. 1, 1983, officials said. Of these, 
eight have been successful, and half have involved school taxes imposed in 
Yucaipa, Modesto, Sacramento and nearby Elk Grove. 
</P>
<P>
But one Mello-Roos effort aimed at acquiring a new school site went down to 
defeat in North Tustin recently, according to Sarah C. Walker of the county 
chief administrator's office. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some observers were encouraged Wednesday by Measure A's ability to 
attract a majority of the votes cast in the Capistrano Unified district. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it," said Supervisor Don R. Roth. "The sooner we put the (countywide 
sales tax) on the ballot, the better." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's significant," said Padberg, the veteran political consultant. "It 
shows that people will vote for a tax increase if they are convinced that the 
money is needed and will be put to good use. It's tough in a special election 
like Tuesday's, but that area is the most anti-growth, anti-tax area in the 
county. . . . There really is a pattern there." 
</P>
<P>
Padberg should know. She was co-manager of the ill-fated campaign on behalf of 
the 1-cent sales tax measure that was soundly defeated in 1984. Post-election 
surveys in 1984 showed that distrust of government's ability to spend existing 
revenue wisely was a key factor, as well as widespread belief that government 
agencies already have enough money and merely need to shift priorities. 
</P>
<P>
More recent polls show that such sentiment is still prevalent and is the main 
obstacle faced by sales tax proponents who are considering putting the proposal 
on the November ballot.

FBI NAMES SUSPECT IN $1-MILLION HOLDUP SPREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Federal authorities have identified a suspect in last summer's kidnaping and 
bank robbery in Buena Park where two gunmen in wigs strapped what they said 
were explosives around a teller's waist before escaping with $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Stephen Gambin, 42, is suspected of four other similar bank robberies 
netting a total of almost $1 million in the Southland and Florida since April, 
1988, said Jim Neilson, an FBI spokesman in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Gambin, who served 15 years in federal prison for a 1973 Iowa bank robbery and 
a failed escape attempt 3 years later in which he shot two U.S. marshals, is 
believed to be in Southern California with a female accomplice, Neilson said. 
The pair is considered "armed and extremely dangerous," Neilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Gambin was paroled from federal prison in March, 1988, and on Aug. 1 a federal 
warrant was issued for his arrest on parole violation charges, Neilson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disguised Bandits 
</P>
<P>
Gambin's suspected crime spree began only a month after his release from 
prison, FBI officials said. So far, no one has been injured, federal 
authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
On April 25, three men in disguises held a Wells Fargo Bank manager and her son 
in their Torrance home overnight and then forced the woman to open the bank's 
vault before the branch opened the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 28, in a similar scenario, two men wearing black wigs and beards forced 
their way into the La Habra apartment of a Buena Park bank teller, holding the 
woman and three family members at gunpoint until morning. 
</P>
<P>
They then forced the teller into a Security Pacific Bank branch after saddling 
her with a device that they claimed was a remote-controlled bomb. It was fake 
and no one was injured, but the pair fled with $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
Two Florida bank robberies followed in November and December, involving 
disguised bandits who kidnaped people using handcuffs and fake bombs, Neilson 
said. One robbery attempt failed, Neilson said, and the gunmen got away with no 
money. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Handcuffed to Briefcase 
</P>
<P>
The most recent robbery, also a botched attempt, occurred last week in 
Torrance, Neilson said. A gunman accosted a female employee outside a Security 
National Bank branch on May 5 and handcuffed a briefcase to her wrist, claiming 
that a bomb was inside. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrived while the bandit waited outside, and he escaped, Neilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Gambin has a female companion who is also wanted by the FBI and the U.S. 
Marshal's Service on suspicion of harboring a fugitive and unlawful flight to 
avoid prosecution, Neilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Julieta Flores Marquez, 46, is a disbarred San Antonio attorney, Neilson said. 
He could not say how long the pair had been traveling together or whether 
Marquez was suspected of participating in any bank robberies.

OIL COMPANIES DISPUTE RESULTS OF MCCOLL WASTE TEST BY EPA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN R. CHURM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A coalition of oil companies, which may be forced to spend millions of dollars 
to clean up the McColl dump in Fullerton, has questioned the results of a test 
burn of hazardous waste taken from the dump. 
</P>
<P>
Based on preliminary findings released last week, the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency said that the 4-day test burn in late March successfully 
destroyed a number of potentially carcinogenic compounds found in contaminated 
soil from the dump. The burn took place at a private La Jolla incinerator 
similar to the one that EPA officials eventually may use to burn an estimated 
150,000 tons of refinery waste buried at the abandoned McColl dump. 
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman for the oil companies, which federal officials have identified 
as responsible for cleanup of the toxic dump, said Wednesday that it is 
"premature" for the EPA to draw any "concrete conclusions" from the test burn. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Duchie, spokesman for the McColl Site Group, the name under which the oil 
companies have organized, also questioned why the EPA released its preliminary 
findings before the end of a public comment period on the agency's proposal to 
burn the wastes on site. Duchie suggested that the EPA's intent was to 
influence public acceptance of incineration at the 8-acre dump, which is 
flanked by several expensive, residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Releasing the results now, Duchie said, was misleading because there were no 
comments about the effect of incineration on heavy metals, which are found in 
large quantities at the dump and pose a potential health risk. Duchie also said 
that the EPA report lacked any specific reference to the level of emissions 
produced by the test burn. (The EPA has conceded that incineration at the site 
may violate local air-quality standards.) 
</P>
<P>
But John Blevins, the EPA's McColl project manager, said the agency had 
intended from the beginning to release whatever results were available as soon 
as possible, whether it was before or after the May 29 deadline for public 
comments on EPA's cleanup proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Blevins also said that the preliminary test report does not specifically 
mention heavy metals because that analysis is not complete. He also said that 
"it appears" that emission levels from incineration won't be a major problem. 
He cautioned, however, that any firm conclusions can not be reached until the 
full report on the test burn is completed in August. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials have estimated that it will take 4 to 7 years to burn the 
McColl waste at a cost of $117 million. The oil companies favor a plan to 
entomb refinery waste and oil until some technology can be found to remove the 
wastes. The cost of that option is estimated at $22 million.

UC IRVINE ATTRACTS STOCK EXPERT TO MANAGEMENT SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN DAVIDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A University of Chicago professor and nationally known expert in stock market 
risk has been recruited by UC Irvine's Graduate School of Management, the 
second big-name finance professor to join the growing business school in as 
many months. 
</P>
<P>
Nai-fu Chen, 38, turned down an endowed chair at the University of Illinois at 
Champaign-Urbana to take the UCI post at $85,600, according to Dennis Aigner, 
dean of the UCI Management School. Chen, along with finance professor Robert 
Haugen, who was recently lured from UC Riverside for $125,000 a year, will help 
revamp UCI's graduate finance curriculum and expand programs for working 
executives, Aigner said. 
</P>
<P>
"This was quite a coup," Aigner said Wednesday. "An endowed chair represents a 
solid guarantee backed up by gold in Ft. Knox." 
</P>
<P>
Chen, who holds Ph.D.s from UCLA and UC Berkeley, is best known for a 1986 
article he published with two other finance experts entitled "Economic Forces 
and the Stock Market." 
</P>
<P>
Aigner described the work, published in the University of Chicago Journal of 
Business, as "one of the most influential papers in finance." 
</P>
<P>
His specialty is the effect that fundamental economic factors, such as 
production growth, interest rates and inflation, have on the stock market. His 
empirical approach measures investor risk. 
</P>
<P>
Chen said that he looks forward to returning to California and that he sees 
great potential in UCI's graduate management school. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, the program is small, but since Orange County is exploding, I see a 
lot of opportunity for a very good school to become an excellent one in the 
very near future," he said in a telephone interview from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"I see a lot of opportunity in terms of contributing to graduate business 
education and also bridging the gap between education and the local business 
community," he said. "And Southern California is like home to me." 
</P>
<P>
Chen, who is now an associate professor of finance at University of Chicago, 
holds a doctorate in finance from UCLA and a doctorate in numerical analysis 
from Berkeley. In addition, he earned an MBA degree from UCLA and did 
post-doctoral work at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
He is expected to begin work here in the fall.

JURY BEGINS DELIBERATIONS ON BLAME IN FATAL CRASH OF POLICE HELICOPTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A jury Wednesday began debating whether to convict an Anaheim man of murder for 
leading police on a frenzied 1987 chase that led to the deaths of three men in 
a helicopter crash. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent William Acosta, who will turn 22 next week, could face 45 years to life 
in prison if the jury finds him guilty of second-degree murder in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
The key facts of the case remained virtually undisputed over the course of a 
weeklong trial before Superior Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
After stealing a car on the night of March 10, 1987, Acosta led police on a 
wild, 45-minute chase through the highways and surface streets of the county, 
at times reaching reported speeds of 90 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
About 12 minutes into the chase, two police helicopters collided in the sky 
above Irvine. Two officers and a civilian observer died in a fiery crash when 
their Costa Mesa police helicopter gave up the lead in the chase to a Newport 
Beach Police copter, then inexplicably doubled back and collided with the 
second helicopter. Officers in the Newport copter were not seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
In their summations Wednesday, the prosecutor and defense attorney used those 
facts to offer jurors widely different legal theories about Acosta's 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
State courts have generally held that a person can be criminally responsible -- 
and convicted of murder -- for the deaths of pursuing police officers, 
pedestrians or other motorists that result from the driver's utter recklessness 
and disregard for safety. 
</P>
<P>
But the Acosta case is the first known in the state, perhaps the nation, that 
seeks to extend that responsibility to the skies. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender William Kelley argued that the distinction means Acosta 
should be cleared of murder charges because he could not reasonably be expected 
to predict that his recklessness could result in the deaths of three men in a 
helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be stupid and absurd of me to stand here before you and argue that 
it's safe and OK to drive 90 miles an hour for 40 miles through Orange County," 
Kelley told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not here to defend (Acosta's) character. And I'm not here to tell you he 
didn't do something dangerous. I'm here to tell you he's not guilty of murder," 
Kelley said. 
</P>
<P>
He blamed pilot error for the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas J. Borris maintained that Acosta realized the dangers 
of driving at high speeds without headlights -- disobeying traffic laws all the 
while -- but took the risk anyway and caused the helicopter collision. 
</P>
<P>
That choice by Acosta, the prosecutor said, makes the defendant guilty of 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything Mr. Acosta did that night was intentional," Borris said. "The most 
telling evidence that we have that Mr. Acosta performed the dangerous acts in 
conscious disregard for human life are his own words." 
</P>
<P>
Acosta reportedly told police after the crash that "yeah, I knew it was 
dangerous -- to the bone," but continued his escape bid anyway, because he 
wanted to get home and feared going to jail, Borris said. 
</P>
<P>
The jury will resume deliberations this morning.

RANCHO SANTIAGO TRIES TO BRAVE ONE MORE BYE

Rancho Santiago College hasn't fared well this season after having byes in its 
schedule, so Coach Don Sneddon hopes he has came up with a way around this 
week's break. 
</P>
<P>
The Dons, who finished second in the Orange Empire Conference, had Tuesday -- 
their normal game day -- off before beginning the first round of the Southern 
California Regionals today with a 2 p.m. home game against East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago lost twice to last-place Riverside coming off byes this season. 
So instead of taking a break Tuesday, Sneddon held an intrasquad game. 
</P>
<P>
"We made it as real as possible," he said. "We had a draft, announced the 
lineups and had the national anthem and an umpire." 
</P>
<P>
With three games left in the conference season, Rancho Santiago had a one-game 
lead over Cypress. Following a bye, the Dons lost consecutive games to 
Riverside and Golden West before beating Saddleback on the season's final day 
to clinch second place. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress doesn't begin play in the regionals until the third round, which starts 
May 19. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago's opponent today, East Los Angeles, finished second in the 
Southern California Conference, but that's about all Sneddon knows of the 
Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
"No one knows too much about them and there really aren't too many people to 
call," Sneddon said. "All we know is that if we take them too lightly, our 
season will be over." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Bailey, a sophomore right-hander, will start for Rancho Santiago. Bailey 
is 11-4 with a 3.44 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
Today's winner plays the winner of the Orange Coast/L.A. Valley game in the 
second round Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
If Orange Coast and Rancho Santiago should meet again, it would mark the fifth 
time the teams have played this season. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago won the first two meetings, 9-0 and 7-5, and Orange Coast took 
the next two, 8-5 and 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast is expected to start sophomore left-hander Ryan Thibault against 
L.A. Valley today. Thibault is 9-1 with a 2.71 ERA and 94 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates' lineup also features Scott Talanoa, who leads the state in home 
runs with 16.

MARINA, CAMERON SURVIVE CHALLENGE BY NORTH TORRANCE 
</P>

<P>
After taking turns giving away the first three games of their Southern Section 
4-A wild-card match Wednesday, the boys' volleyball teams from Marina and North 
Torrance high schools slugged it out in Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
Marina, powered by 6-foot-5 Duane Cameron, took the game and the match, 15-6, 
6-15, 15-3, 15-13. But it wasn't easy. Not in the fourth game. 
</P>
<P>
Marina, which had blown out North Torrance in the third game to take a 2-1 
lead, looked to be in great shape when it jumped out to a 3-0 lead. That lead 
was 4-2 when North Torrance went on a 5-0 run that gave it a 7-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Marina went on an eight-point run of its own to go up 12-7. But North Torrance 
came back with a 5-1 spurt that left the score 13-12. 
</P>
<P>
Marina went ahead, 14-13, and then came seven side outs with each team's big 
hitter -- Marina's Cameron and North Torrance's Dennis Smith -- coming up with 
big hits. 
</P>
<P>
Marina finally won it on Braden Coenen's cross-court spike that landed just 
inside the left corner. 
</P>
<P>
"If this is the wild card, I'm not sure I want to go on to the first round," 
said Andy Read, Marina's coach. 
</P>
<P>
But Marina (12-4) will play Santa Monica (14-2), at Santa Monica, Friday. 
</P>
<P>
That seemed a foregone conclusion after Marina blew by North Torrance (13-4) in 
the first game, 15-6. 
</P>
<P>
Cameron had seven kills and a block and Dave Park had five kills in the game. 
But North Torrance was the main contributor to Marina's first-game victory, 
committing seven unforced errors. 
</P>
<P>
In a swift about-face of ineptness, Marina could do nothing right in the second 
game and North Torrance won, 15-6. Smith had five kills for North Torrance. 
Marina committed seven unforced errors of its own and added six service errors 
in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"You saw a lot of tense, nervous kids out there," Read said. "It took a while 
for us to settle down." 
</P>
<P>
Marina did more than settle down in the third game. It laid North Torrance out 
flat, 15-3. Marina started with a 6-0 run before North Torrance scored its 
first point. Then came a 8-0 run to make the score 14-1. Cameron, who finished 
with a game-high 27 kills, had six kills in the game. Coenen, who had 19 kills 
in the game, added five.

WORKING TO BECOME A COMPLETE CATCHER; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA ANA'S VARGAS JUST MAY BE A NATURAL, BUT HE CONTINUES TO STRIVE FOR 
PERFECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Glassman, baseball coach at Willard Intermediate School in Santa Ana, took 
one look at Julio Vargas and knew the seventh-grader was born to catch. 
</P>
<P>
Vargas had never played organized baseball when Glassman persuaded the 
youngster to put on a mask and shin guards and get behind the plate. Glassman 
quickly discovered that Vargas was a natural. 
</P>
<P>
"He had the physical and mental tools and was eager to play," Glassman said. 
"Catching can be a very difficult position for someone who has never played, 
but it came easily to him. We never lost a game in two years with Julio at 
catcher. 
</P>
<P>
"He was confident and self-assured. He was a real student of the game. It was 
like he was born to play baseball. I think he could make a living off the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
In the past six years, Glassman, an 11-year veteran at Willard, has watched 
Vargas grow into a 6-foot-2, 220-pound senior at Santa Ana High School. 
</P>
<P>
Vargas, a two-time All-Southern Section selection, is batting .457 with three 
home runs and 17 RBIs and has struck out only two times. Power? Vargas has hit 
13 home runs at Santa Ana, including two in a playoff game against Upland as a 
sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Ross, Santa Ana's coach, says Vargas has become a more disciplined hitter 
this year, hitting to all fields. He showed plenty of patience last season when 
he walked 36 times. He has 27 walks this season, including eight in the past 
three games. 
</P>
<P>
Vargas has paid a price for the long hours he spends on weekends at a batting 
cage in Tustin. He quit wearing batting gloves, saying he was wearing out a 
pair every three weeks and it was getting expensive replacing the worn gloves. 
</P>
<P>
"I've concentrated on becoming a better hitter," Vargas said. "I'm trying to go 
with the pitches to right field, hitting the curveball and the inside fastball. 
</P>
<P>
"I've also worked a lot with Coach (Herschel) Musick on my catching. He'll put 
me against a wall and throw a whiffle ball into the dirt to test my reflexes. 
I've still got a lot to learn. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting better at handling pitchers. I'm not only watching where a batter 
stands in the box, but how much bat speed he gets on inside or outside pitches. 
I've also worked a lot on my picks (pickoff throws) to second." 
</P>
<P>
In short, Vargas is working to become the complete player. He is very agile and 
quick for his size -- physical tools that also make him attractive to football 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Vargas was a starting tight end for Santa Ana for three seasons despite missing 
summer passing league competition and workouts each year because he had to 
work. Vargas said he hasn't ruled out a future in football. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to go out for football as a sophomore," he said. "But Coach 
(Dick) Hill talked me into coming out and then made me work my tail off for a 
starting position. Coach Hill taught me the rewards for hard work. We won the 
league title three times." 
</P>
<P>
Ross wonders how much better Vargas could have been if he concentrated solely 
on baseball at Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"He needs to get away from football for a year and then I think he'll really 
develop," Ross said. "He came out this year with nagging shoulder and ankle 
injuries after playing football that set him back. 
</P>
<P>
"He's had some trouble with his elbow and I'm sure the scouts are a bit suspect 
of his arm. But there are games where he just dominates. He picked off two 
runners against Villa Park and tagged out two runners at home against Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
"Julio is a big, aggressive kid who's not afraid to throw. Very few players run 
on him. In fact, we hope they try to run." 
</P>
<P>
Vargas, who plans to attend Rancho Santiago College in the fall if he is not 
taken in baseball's amateur draft June 5-7, rated himself in five phases of the 
game and gave himself high marks with the exception of power. Here's the Vargas 
meter: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Arm strength: "Better than average. My elbow was sore at the beginning of 
the year, but it's fine now. I like to throw and I think runners respect my 
arm." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Speed: "Good. I think I run pretty good for a guy my size. I've been timed 
under 5.0 in the 40." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hitting: "Better than average and improving. I'm trying to become a more 
aggressive hitter." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Power: "Average. I'm not getting good pitches to hit. I'm a little 
disappointed here. I had more homers when I was a sophomore than I do this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Intensity: "Good. My intensity is up and improving. I've heard people say 
that sometimes it looks like I'm just going through the motions. I'm hustling 
all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this season, Vargas learned that he can't go out of his way to please 
the scouts after a disappointing afternoon against Ocean View. 
</P>
<P>
"I concentrated too much on who was watching me and how I looked," he said. "I 
had a poor game. Now, I'm just going day to day and not worrying about who's 
watching me. I'm out there having fun. 
</P>
<P>
"If I got drafted, I would probably sign. My dream is to play professional 
baseball. But I'd also like to get an education. We'll just have to see what 
happens and take it from there."

MATER DEI STUNNED BY SERVITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Playing solely for pride, Servite High School probably cost Mater Dei its 
third-place seeding in the Southern Section 5-A division playoffs and its top 
ranking in Orange County with a stunning 8-1 victory Wednesday in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Servite (11-11-1 overall, 4-7 in Angelus League play) entered the game knowing 
it had no chance of earning a berth in the playoffs that begin next week. 
</P>
<P>
But the Friars chased Mater Dei pitcher Scott Corliss, one of the county's best 
pitchers, with a seven-run outburst in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
First baseman Tom Jacobs hit a two-run homer over the left-field fence to 
trigger the big inning, and then pitcher Cliff Mierendorf belted a grand slam 
off reliever Brian Frankel to finish off Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
Mierendorf (3-2) struck out seven and had Mater Dei shut out until the seventh, 
when the Monarchs scored an unearned run to avoid their first shutout in two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"We've either looked real good or real bad this year," said Mike McNary, 
Servite's coach. "I'd like to think that was our real team that you saw today. 
This week against Mater Dei is our CIF playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to end the year on a losing note. The players thought they had 
a lot to prove. Hopefully, this game was a sign of things to come." 
</P>
<P>
McNary starts six underclassmen, including Mierendorf. The sophomore 
right-hander continually kept Mater Dei's hitters off stride by hitting the 
corners and allowed only four hits. Mater Dei failed to advance a runner to 
third base until the seventh. 
</P>

Afterward, Mater Dei Coach Bob Ickes said he saw the loss coming on Monday, 
when he felt his team had one of its poorest practices of the season. Mater Dei 
(19-5, 10-2) had been the top-ranked team in the Orange County Sportswriters 
Assn. poll for five consecutive weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a terrible practice and then went through the motions in pregame 
today," Ickes said. "We've been living off our pitching for too long. We 
haven't hit the ball the past couple of games." 
</P>
<P>
Corliss (7-2) struck out 13 batters the last time he faced Servite, but it was 
clear in the first inning that the senior right-hander wasn't sharp when he 
walked Servite's Rob Walker to load the bases and then gave up his first run by 
walking the next batter.

In-N-Out Burger -- which has eight Orange County restaurants -- has hiked its 
starting salary from $4.75 to $6 per hour, the company announced this week. 
</P>
<P>
The decision means a salary increase for more than 75% of In-N-Out's 1,500 
employees, according to the fast-food company. 
</P>
<P>
California's minimum wage is $4.75. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Snyder, In-N-Out's president, said the increase is intended to encourage 
workers to stay with the chain and "to attract good, quality people" to the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
The pay raise could be particularly helpful in Orange County, where retailers 
face fierce competition for minimum-wage workers. 
</P>
<P>
In-N-Out Burger's Orange County stores are in Anaheim, Buena Park, Costa Mesa, 
Garden Grove, La Habra, Laguna Niguel, Placentia and Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The company is headquartered in Baldwin Park.

KOLL HEADS EAST TO SEEK TEXAS DEALS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For years, Texas developers fanned out over the rest of the country, at first 
flush with success from building Texas-size projects in the state's big cities 
and later -- after the crash in oil prices -- looking for markets with sound 
local economies. 
</P>
<P>
Now Koll Co., a big Newport Beach developer, is heading in the other direction. 
Koll said Wednesday that it was opening a Texas division in Dallas and named 
Lucien B. Crosland, formerly chairman of Dallas' Crosland Investment 
Properties, as president of the division. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expects Rebound 
</P>
<P>
The office will probably start with a couple dozen people, a spokesman said, 
and grow from there. 
</P>
<P>
Koll said it wanted to get in on the ground floor when the Texas economy 
rebounds, which the company said it anticipates soon. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it would be seeking to buy offices, factories, warehouses, 
shopping centers and apartment complexes, many of which have been selling at 
dirt-cheap prices since the Texas economy crashed in the early 1980s. It won't 
be doing any development or construction at first. 
</P>
<P>
Crosland's old company will continue to buy and develop property under the 
Crosland name in the Southeast, mid-Atlantic and Southwest regions. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Koll's operations are on the West Coast, and Texas will be the furthest 
east the company has put an office.

POMONA IS AS TORN AS ITS COUNCIL OVER WILSON OUSTER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
They came in unprecedented numbers. An hour before Monday night's City Council 
meeting, all 138 seats in the council chambers were filled. An estimated 600 
more residents stood outside, listening to the meeting via loudspeakers. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd had come to give the council an earful of community sentiment on its 
decision last week to fire City Administrator A. J. Wilson. But after more than 
five hours of praise, criticism, accusations and personal attacks, the only 
thing clear was that residents were as sharply divided on the issue as their 
elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
A new council majority, created when Councilman Tomas Ursua took office April 
24, voted last week in closed session to oust Wilson after 13 months on the 
job. Mayor Donna Smith voted against the firing and Councilman Mark Nymeyer 
walked out of the meeting in protest. 
</P>
<P>
The new council majority justified its decision to fire Wilson by citing his 
$125,000 salary, his failure to follow council direction and his alleged 
violations of city hiring policies. Essentially, the three council members 
said, Pomona needed a new administrator to reflect a new philosophy in city 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The action instantly polarized the community. Residents formed a group called 
Citizens for a Positive Pomona to call for Wilson's reinstatement and, failing 
that, to seek the recall of council members who voted to fire him. The loss of 
Wilson, they said, would sound the death knell to the troubled city's efforts 
at revitalization. 
</P>
<P>
"Pomona will cry from within for the loss of (Wilson's) leadership," Rod Tapp, 
a member of the citizens group, told the council Monday. "The city will be 
hard-pressed to find an equal." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called Necessary Step 
</P>
<P>
Other residents, however, contended that Wilson's firing was a necessary step 
in the city's political evolution. The election of Ursua, they argued, signaled 
a shift of power in the city from a small clique of influential business 
interests to a broader constituency that includes minorities and low-income 
residents threatened by gentrification. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a giant step for Pomona," resident Frank Estrada said. "We're going to 
stand behind these three people we elected. . . . My vote is worth as much as 
(that of) anybody with money." 
</P>
<P>
The council's discussion on Monday of Wilson's firing culminated in a motion by 
Nymeyer to reinstate the administrator. Smith supported him, but council 
members Ursua, C. L. (Clay) Bryant and Nell Soto reaffirmed their votes to 
terminate Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that we even have to defend ourselves," Soto said. "We had the 
right and prerogative to do that. . . . It is clear that the balance of power 
has shifted on this council. We three think and feel that we are representing 
the majority of this city. . . . Mr. Wilson was not the Messiah." 
</P>
<P>
Smith countered that the firing of Wilson was unwarranted and unfair. 
</P>
<P>
"He was only here a little over a year," she said. "I hardly think that a year 
qualifies as a report card for anyone. . . . He wasn't God. Well, no one member 
of the council up here is God either, though they act like it sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Wilson said they believed that he was the victim of a "power 
play" by Bryant and other members of the new majority to install a city 
administration they can control. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, members of this council intend to manipulate this city's government 
and its day-to-day operations," said Detective Raul Camargo, president of the 
Pomona Police Officers Assn. "The residents of this community, as well as our 
association, will no longer tolerate your antics and quests for power. . . . 
This insanity must cease as of now." 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, members of Citizens for a Positive Pomona said they would 
mount a drive to recall council members who voted to fire Wilson. Under the 
state Elections Code, a recall effort may not begin against an elected official 
within the first 90 days of a term. Ursua joined the council and Bryant was 
sworn in for his fourth council term on April 24. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Target 
</P>
<P>
Because of this, members of the citizens group said Soto, who is in the middle 
of her first four-year term, would be their first target. Soto, in an interview 
this week, said she believes that the council majority has the support of most 
Pomona voters and that she is not worried about being recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not so concerned that I'm going to lose sleep over it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents who sided with the council majority denounced Smith and the would-be 
recall proponents as "poor losers" for opposing the preference expressed by 
voters in the March election. Ursua accused Smith of orchestrating community 
opposition to Wilson's ouster. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lack of Respect' 
</P>
<P>
"What you have here is a lack of respect for the democratic process," he said. 
"I think the (termination) vote was a legitimate vote and I really don't 
understand why people are not willing to live by it." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the council's decision to fire Wilson hailed the administrator's 
vision of Pomona's future and the confidence and charisma that enabled him to 
persuade residents, local business people and developers to share his faith in 
the city's potential. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt so very, very positively about the things we could do here," resident 
Jean Todd said, adding that the community's enthusiasm died abruptly with 
Wilson's firing. "I've never see anything disintegrate so fast." 
</P>
<P>
Other residents disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think one man is the future of Pomona," Roberto Curiel said. "A. J. 
Wilson is gone, but he didn't take the future with him." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's supporters included attorney Christopher Brancart of Pomona Legal 
Services, who filed suit last year against the city, claiming racial 
discrimination in the Fire Department's hiring and promotion practices. 
Brancart lauded Wilson's response to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lost an Ally' 
</P>
<P>
"In two weeks, we were able to reach an agreement that would have taken two 
years of federal litigation," Brancart said. "The result (was) the most 
sweeping and progressive affirmative action program of any fire department in 
Los Angeles County. As a civil rights attorney, I have lost an ally. Mr. Wilson 
will be missed." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Bryant portrayed Wilson as an official who showed flagrant 
disregard for the law. The councilman has accused Wilson of violating the City 
Code by hiring Hector Godinez -- a former colleague of Wilson's in Santa Ana 
city government -- as his executive assistant in January without the approval 
of the city's Merit System Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"Wilson has never cared about the law and it finally caused his firing," Bryant 
said. "He should have been fired 20 times over." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant placed an item on Monday's agenda calling for the council to fire 
Godinez and file suit against Wilson to reclaim the wages paid to the executive 
assistant. But when the matter came up early Tuesday morning, the council voted 
3-2 against waiving procedural rules that prohibit considering an agenda item 
after 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Council Pledge 
</P>
<P>
The acrimony that has enveloped city politics since Wilson's firing followed 
close on the heels of an April 24 pledge by council members to bury their 
personal differences and work for the common good. Smith noted that relations 
on the council are so strained that the three majority council members never 
tell her of their intentions. 
</P>
<P>
"All I know is what I read in the papers," Smith told Bryant, Soto and Ursua at 
this week's meeting. "I don't know what you're thinking. I can't read your 
minds. We have to talk. We're not communicating, and it's the people who are 
losing out." 
</P>
<P>
Although Soto has blamed Smith for fomenting much of the divisiveness in the 
community, she joined the mayor in calling for unity on the council. 
</P>
<P>
"Unity is the key to progress," Soto said. "Negative attitudes and petty 
personality clashes have no place in our city government."

A STARTLING DELAY IN OLD TOWN;

<P>
DEVELOPER EXPECTED APPROVAL FOR NEWEST PROPOSAL

PASADENA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Historical preservationists were cautiously optimistic last year when developer 
Douglas L. Stitzel took over the ambitious Marketplace project, long considered 
the cornerstone of rejuvenating historic Old Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Stitzel had a reputation as a builder of high-class shopping areas and he said 
he was willing to work with preservationists to end the rancorous debate over 
the fate of the block of 16 historic contiguous buildings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Design Unveiled 
</P>
<P>
But whatever good will existed last year disappeared in a puff Monday night 
when Stitzel unveiled a new design for the project before the city's Design 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
True to the promise he made last year, Stitzel abandoned the idea of building a 
contemporary-style mall, by boring an atrium through the middle of the 
turn-of-the-century buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Preservationists, however, say that despite that improvement, Stitzel's design 
is no better and in some areas is worse than previous proposals because of its 
effect on parts of the historically important buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"It is as damaging and in some cases more damaging than before," Claire 
Bogaard, executive director of the preservation group, Pasadena Heritage, told 
the commission. "Let us direct the developer to go back to the drawing board." 
</P>
<P>
Although three members of the Design Commission were prepared to approve the 
project, the four other members voted to delay action until next month so the 
commission could receive an initial environmental review of the project. 
</P>
<P>
It was a seemingly benign decision, but Stitzel, who expected approval Monday 
night, said he saw the delay as a sign that the project may face tough 
opposition from some in City Hall as well as from preservationists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Battle Stage Set 
</P>
<P>
Supporters and opponents agree that the commission's decision has set the stage 
for a battle that could be as bitter as the one that has raged since the mall 
concept was proposed in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Bogaard said Pasadena Heritage has begun considering a lawsuit to force the 
project to undergo a more strenuous environmental review, which would include 
an assessment of the damage to historic structures. 
</P>
<P>
Stitzel appealed the Design Commission's decision to the Board of Directors on 
Tuesday, asking it to step in approve the project, which he has renamed One 
Colorado Boulevard. The issue is scheduled to be taken up next week. 
</P>
<P>
But he said he has no desire for a protracted war in court or City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to build a project and I have the financial wherewithal to do it," he 
said. "But I'm not into spending months fighting through the bureaucratic 
process. The fear is of eternal bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
If his new design is not supported, he said he may resurrect the idea of 
building the same mall, which the city approved last year over the protests of 
historical preservationists. 
</P>
<P>
"We have worked for the better part of the last 4 1/2 months to come up with a 
better project," Stitzel said. "But if they want a Marketplace, they may just 
end up with one." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Aspects Better 
</P>
<P>
Opponents agree that Stitzel has improved on some aspects of the original 
Marketplace design, which was proposed by developer John Patrick Wilson in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson believed the only way to attract shoppers and get them to browse on the 
hard-to-lease second floor was to build a mall atrium through the buildings. 
The facades of the buildings would be left in place and restored. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of a 350,000-square-foot mall in Old Pasadena, which is listed on the 
National Register of Historic Places, provoked an outcry from preservationists, 
who called it glitzy, phony and historically outrageous. (The nearby Plaza 
Pasadena has 584,485 square feet of leasable space.) 
</P>
<P>
Thus began the six-year battle over the block of 16 buildings, bounded by 
Colorado Boulevard, Fair Oaks Avenue, De Lacey Street and Union Street. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's plans began to crumble in 1987 because of problems in securing 
financing for the $60-million project. 
</P>
<P>
The project was sold to CMC Capital Corp. and then Pierce/Lange Development. 
Both groups adhered to the mall concept and both ran into similar financial 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
The project was sold last December to Stitzel and his partners, Berisford 
Capital Corp. and San Francisco developer Leslie Schilling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Design Details 
</P>
<P>
Unlike a mall, Stitzel has proposed a design that would keep the interior walls 
of each building intact. The design calls for ground-floor entrances to shops 
on both the first and second floors using a plan that even some 
preservationists have called the plan ingenious. 
</P>
<P>
To accomplish this, the front entrances of several buildings would lead down a 
few steps to a first floor several feet lower than the street. The rear 
entrances would lead up a few steps to a second floor slightly above the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
Because the floors would be lowered by a few feet, the buildings could 
accommodate a third floor for offices, storage or retail shops. 
</P>
<P>
The design not only allows an extra floor in a building, but it also doubles 
the amount of valuable space accessible from the street. 
</P>
<P>
The plan also includes a new three-story building on Union Street housing 
restaurants, shops and six movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changes Raise Concerns 
</P>
<P>
Preservationists argue that the design requires too many changes to the floors 
of the buildings, the rear facades and a cobblestone alley -- all historically 
important features, they say. The changes could result in the block being 
dropped from the National Register of Historic Places, according to Pasadena 
Heritage. 
</P>
<P>
The changes include burying Hugus Alley under 2 1/2 feet of dirt and pavement 
to meet the new heights of some rear entrances. The floors of some buildings 
would also have to be adjusted to accommodate the double ground-floor scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Preservationists also say the size and design of the new three-story building 
overwhelms the architecture of the rest of the block. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first saw this, I thought it was intriguing and ingenious," said Sue 
Mossman, program director for Pasadena Heritage. "Now I find it to be an 
artificial and phony concept for Old Pasadena. It is artificial Old Pasadena, 
not real Old Pasadena." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Nyberg, a business owner in Old Pasadena, said the One Colorado project 
will hurt businesses in the area because it is too focused on a central plaza 
located behind the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Interior Focus' 
</P>
<P>
"This project is designed to have an interior focus," she said. "That is not 
what Old Pasadena is about. All the energy will be drawn off Colorado 
Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
Stitzel's lead architect, Jeffrey Horowitz, said the design requires far less 
demolition of walls and floors than Wilson envisioned and the vast majority of 
the facades would be untouched. 
</P>
<P>
By abandoning the mall idea, the project also would fit in better with the rest 
of Old Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal has won the backing of the Chamber of Commerce, Board of Realtors 
and the Old Pasadena Business Improvement District, an association of Old 
Pasadena business people.

Responding to opponents who had gathered more than 500 signatures on petitions, 
the City Council on Monday unanimously rescinded its decision to spend $50,000 
on a statue honoring George Washington and the U.S. Constitution and agreed to 
a compromise instead. 
</P>
<P>
The council, at the suggestion of Councilman Christopher F. Houseman, voted to 
create a committee to seek private funding for a statue celebrating the 
nation's founding and to find a suitable location for it. Mayor Barry L. Hatch 
will oversee the committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Embarrassed, Appalled' 
</P>
<P>
The council originally approved the statue expenditure on a 3-2 vote in March. 
But some critics questioned using city funds, and others questioned the need 
for the statue at all. 
</P>
<P>
But Hatch, who since he took office in 1986 has wanted a statue to commemorate 
America's founding, said he was "totally embarrassed, appalled" by the attitude 
of the critics. "Those great men (who founded the United States), we couldn't 
even cast a shadow upon their feet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (Hatch) has a misplaced sense of what patriotism is," resident 
Marjorie Kemmerer said in an interview. "He is overly fixated that we're not 
patriotic enough." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Olympic Statue 
</P>
<P>
Hatch had also been criticized for his desire to remove a City Hall statue 
dedicated to the 1984 Olympic Games and replace it with the monument to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Houseman and Patricia M. Reichenberger, the two council members who had 
supported Hatch's proposal for a Washington monument, did not agree with his 
proposal to move the Olympic statue across town to Garvey Ranch Park. 
</P>
<P>
Houseman's compromise resolution acknowledged the importance of the Olympic 
statue. 
</P>
<P>
"We treasure the fact that the (Olympic) torch was carried through our city, 
and the monument which commemorates that will remain intact," Houseman said. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-foot-high sculpture depicts the Olympic torch and five interlocking 
rings. It marks a spot near where a torch-bearing runner passed en route to the 
Los Angeles Coliseum. Monterey Park, which has since dubbed itself "an Olympic 
City with a Heart," was the site of the Olympic field hockey competition. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Chu and Betty Couch, the two council members who originally opposed the 
Washington statue, indicated that they will go along with the compromise 
because city funds will not be used. Chu and Couch had said a city struggling 
to balance its books could not afford to spend money on the statue. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, statue opponent Kemmerer told the council that the city has "so many 
unmet needs" that it can ill afford to spend the $50,000. It would be better, 
she said, to spend the money to help the handicapped or homeless, provide 
better child care, hire more police or restore cuts to the budgets of the 
library and the Parks and Recreation Department. 
</P>
<P>
Complaining about the critics, Hatch said Monday: "How much are we spending on 
new immigrants?" He said he had simply proposed "spending a little" to remember 
the nation's founders, who created "this great nation for all the immigrants 
around the world to enter." 
</P>
<P>
But Hatch said creating a statue committee is an excellent idea because "it 
certainly would diffuse any concerns that residents have voiced."

PRIVATE FIRMS TO CLEAN OII LANDFILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will hand over the job of cleaning up 
and monitoring the Operating Industries Inc. landfill to a group of private 
companies within the next four months. 
</P>
<P>
The companies will do the work under terms of an agreement that was approved 
this week by U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Wilson, EPA spokesman, said responsibility for day-to-day monitoring and 
cleanup work at the site will be transferred gradually to the OII Steering 
Committee, organized by a group of companies that disposed hazardous waste at 
the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Landfill Gas 
</P>
<P>
The transfer of responsibility means that new contractors hired by the steering 
committee will replace the contractors that have been doing cleanup work for 
the EPA. The EPA and the state Department of Health Services will continue to 
supervise cleanup of the site, and the EPA will continue to develop a 
long-range cleanup plan. 
</P>
<P>
The dump received more than 200 million gallons of hazardous waste from oil 
refineries, food companies and chemical and industrial plants before it was 
closed in 1984 after complaints about odors and other environmental problems, 
including the buildup of landfill gas laced with toxic chemicals. It was placed 
on the national priority list for cleanup under the federal Superfund program 
in 1986. The federal Superfund law makes companies liable for the hazardous 
waste they generate even after they have legally disposed of it in a landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA gave companies that shipped more than 24,450 gallons of hazardous waste 
to the dump the choice of paying cash for the cleanup or taking on the work 
themselves. More than 50 companies agreed to pay more than $31 million in cash. 
An additional 60 companies chose to pay a much lesser amount, $1.9 million, and 
spend $34 million on cleanup work. The agreements cover only the initial 
cleanup efforts. EPA officials have said the cost ultimately could reach $200 
million to $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Zimmerman, steering committee chairman, said the companies that took on 
the cleanup task believe they can do the job more efficiently than the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we can speed it up," Zimmerman said. "The whole idea is to accelerate 
the cleanup." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aggressive Approach 
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman said that experience has shown that the cheapest, most efficient way 
to deal with a toxic waste site is to tackle the problem aggressively, 
installing environmental controls as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
The steering committee, through its contractors, will take over and expand the 
system for monitoring, collecting and burning landfill gas, improve irrigation 
and erosion control at the site and collect and haul away leachate, the 
contaminated liquids that accumulate in the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman said the group also will design and construct a plant to treat 
leachate at the site. Complicating the design of the leachate system is the 
fact that the 190-acre dump is bisected by the Pomona Freeway, and it may be 
necessary to install pipes over or under the freeway to carry leachate from the 
south side of the dump to the plant on the north side, he said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 4,000 companies sent hazardous waste to the landfill, but 80% of the 
volume came from 182 of them, EPA officials said. Nearly two-thirds of the 189 
companies are parties to the agreement, including the top 10 sources: Chevron, 
Atlantic Richfield, American National Can Co., Texaco, Exxon USA, McDonnell 
Douglas Corp. Union Oil, Norris Inc., Sun Oil and Occidental Petroleum. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Firms Added 
</P>
<P>
The cash settlements approved by the court this week for the initial stages of 
the cleanup range from $15,000 from the Coca-Cola Co. to $5.9 million from 
Atlantic Richfield. Two companies that were not part of the original settlement 
announced in December were added to the settlement this week. The companies, 
Ameroil and Southwest Processors, will pay a total of more than $440,000, 
including a 10% penalty for settling late. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said the EPA intends to pursue action against companies that shipped 
hazardous waste to the dump but have not agreed to contribute to the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said the next step in the cleanup plan will be construction of an 
expanded system to collect and burn landfill gas. The EPA has estimated the 
cost of building and operating the system for 30 years at $73 million. 
</P>
<P>
Landfill gas is created by the decomposition of trash. EPA studies indicated 
that the landfill will generate gas for 45 to 60 years.

<P>
FIRE, RESCUE IDEA APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved a proposal that 
could pave the way for Monterey Park's fire and rescue operations to be 
consolidated into the county Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
A study by the county indicated a possible annual savings of $594,571 to the 
city. The board's vote authorizes the county fire chief to negotiate with 
Monterey Park, if the city wants to pursue the topic. 
</P>
<P>
But Monterey Park officials are reacting cautiously to the idea, which over the 
years has been suggested as a cost-saving measure for the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd certainly be interested in seeing what they've come up with," City 
Manager Mark Lewis said. But, he said, the issue is not a priority. "We're 
concerned that there may be hidden costs that would significantly add to the 
city's costs." 
</P>
<P>
Fire Chief Allen E. McComb said: "I haven't been convinced yet that 
consolidation is the best solution. We're providing some services, such as 
paramedic ambulances, which would not be as readily available with the county." 
</P>
<P>
Neither McComb nor Lewis have seen the county's detailed proposal.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: CHILD-CARE POLICY ADOPTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Monday unanimously adopted a child-care policy with the 
goal of ensuring "quality, affordable care for children of all ages." 
</P>
<P>
To solve an "infant-care crisis" in Monterey Park, the policy suggests that the 
city promote parental leave, flexible work hours and job sharing in the private 
and public sectors. The city itself will "work to become a model employer" 
regarding child care for its employees. 
</P>
<P>
The policy was drafted by the city's Child Care Task Force, which the council 
created last year. 
</P>
<P>
The policy recommends that the city support state and federal legislation to 
make child care more readily available, eliminate city regulations that may 
adversely affect child-care facilities and encourage a "team effort" among 
schools, city agencies and community groups to care for school-age children.

CITY HALL CONTRACT OK SPARKS NEW ATTACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After the City Council last week awarded a $2.97-million contract to renovate 
City Hall, critics of the project renewed their attacks on what they believe is 
a financially foolish undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
City Hall, a 59-year-old building near the corner of Citrus Avenue and College 
Street, has been the subject of debate for nearly three decades. On one side 
are those who agree with Mayor Robert Low, who believes the Spanish-style 
building should be preserved as a link to the city's past. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side are those who say the building is too small and dilapidated 
and should be replaced by a new facility. A leading voice in this effort is the 
Covina Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The future of City Hall, which was a major campaign issue in the 1988 City 
Council race, has split the council as renovation costs escalate beyond the 
original estimate of $2.3 million. Doug Ewing, the architect hired by the city 
to design the renovation project, later modified the estimate of construction 
costs to $2.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reconsideration Urged 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Low and Councilmen Thomas O'Leary and Gary Coffey back the renovation 
project, while Councilmen Chris Lancaster and Henry Morgan favor building a new 
facility near the Police and Fire departments at the corner of San Bernardino 
Road and Citrus Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Chamber of Commerce President Tim Burlingame wrote Low on May 1, urging him to 
reconsider the renovation project. 
</P>
<P>
"The renovation bids are as high as it would be to build a new building," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Low said his critics are comparing apples and oranges because they are using 
old estimates on how much a new building would cost. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager John Thomson said his staff made a study 1 1/2 years ago and 
estimated that a new building would cost no more than $3 million. Thomson said 
he is neutral on the issue. "Our position is to follow the direction of the 
council." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the chamber board voted unanimously to urge the City Council to 
abandon a renovation project in favor of building a new complex, said Randy 
Gordon, director of the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Although Low did not respond to Burlingame's letter, O'Leary wrote to 
Burlingame, saying the decision to renovate is "wise and educated" and will 
help the city retain its self-identify. 
</P>
<P>
At a special meeting last Thursday, the council voted 3 to 2 to award the City 
Hall renovation contract to FTR International Inc. of Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
John Rose, one of approximately 25 people at the meeting who opposed the 
renovation project, described the council's vote as a politically driven 
decision and said that Low is interested in seeing his name on a plaque after 
the building is renovated. 
</P>
<P>
Low dismissed that charge, saying that after the renovation, City Hall will 
bear the same plaque listing council members who were in office when the 
building was completed in 1930. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have a far greater chance in having my name on a city plaque if there 
were a new City Hall," Low said. 
</P>
<P>
Burlingame, who spoke at Thursday's meeting on behalf of the chamber, said he 
and others were frustrated that their comments elicited no response from Low, 
Coffey and O'Leary. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like they had made up their minds and were not going to be confused by 
the facts," Burlingame said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a stupid decision," Morgan said of the vote to award the 
contract. "The contractor, that's not the issue. The issue is we shouldn't be 
wasting public funds renovating a building that old." 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster, who last month voted against a bond issue to fund the renovation, 
also said the project is one that residents can ill afford. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster said he had approved architectural plans for the renovation only 
because he and Morgan were outnumbered. He said that now that he knows 
renovation is going to cost more than $2.97 million, he will vote no on 
everything else related to the project. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an awkward, old building." Morgan said. "It's not an edifice that can be 
considered of great significance." 
</P>
<P>
But Low believes City Hall is an important link to Covina's past. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up in California in the '30s and '40s," Low said. "I have fond memories 
and I think they are worthwhile in preserving." 
</P>
<P>
Coffey agreed, adding that "Covina is a city that's very history-minded." 
</P>
<P>
A disappointed Rose said he and other critics do not plan to continue fighting 
the renovation. "As long as a decision has been made, I think the city should 
get behind the City Council and make this the best sow's ear in Covina."

CASA AMONG THE WINNERS ON DERBY DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAMELA MARIN, Pamela Marin is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was Sunday Silence's day, but at local Kentucky Derby outposts, it played 
more like Saturday Hullabaloo. 
</P>
<P>
At Remick's restaurant in Irvine, party guest Jan Smith squealed, "I won! I 
won! I won! How did that happen?" (All that for the first of five pre-Derby 
races -- taped races, mind you, from Santa Anita -- run a month ago.) 
</P>
<P>
The Derby Day party at Remick's was hosted by the local chapter of 
Court-Appointed Special Advocates, or CASA, a privately funded, 
volunteer-staffed agency that provides specially trained adult advocates for 
abused and neglected children. 
</P>
<P>
The benefit drew 210 guests at $75 each and raised more than $50,000 in net 
proceeds, including money bid on auction items, underwriting and donations. 
That amount represents nearly half of CASA's annual budget, according to event 
chairman Fred Port. 
</P>
<P>
Port and his committee nixed mint juleps ("because they taste really gross," 
explained one committee member), but otherwise held a traditional line, filling 
the airy restaurant with bushels of flowers and fixings for a Southern feast. 
</P>
<P>
A banjo-and-clarinet duo worked Dixie melodies as guests sipped mimosas, bid on 
silent auction items and feasted from buffet tables loaded with baked ham, 
roast turkey, biscuits and gravy, strawberries and cream, "Derby cheese" 
(grits, cheddar and cayenne pepper) and Kentucky bourbon balls. 
</P>
<P>
At one dining room table papered with racing forms, Dennis Leibel and pals Fred 
Sher and Dave Smith sipped champagne and placed bets with CASA funny money. 
</P>
<P>
When a photographer swooped in for a shot, Leibel, sporting "Upsand Downs" 
suspenders, flashed a smile and flicked a CASA grand. 
</P>
<P>
His wife Susan, executive director of CASA, just rolled her eyes. "This is my 
husband's track personality," she said with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
Across town: "Dress up and lose money for a good cause" was how Beverly 
Thompson summed up the Balboa Bay Club's Derby Day bash. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson was a vision in polka dots, topped with a hat the size of a saddle -- 
a modern note in the mixed-bag, dress-up benefit for two local children's 
causes, the Orange County Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation and Childhelp, 
U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
More than 400 guests paid $50 each to enjoy a program similar to the one at 
Remick's -- taped races and the live broadcast from Churchill Downs, 
funny-money betting, auction bidding, buffet lunch. But many in the crowd at 
BBC's seventh annual "Run for the Children" dressed thematically. The question 
was: what theme? 
</P>
<P>
There were a number of Rhett and Scarlett manques (Tara was in Georgia, not the 
Bluegrass state), as well as half a dozen generically hoop-skirted 
antebellumites. Suzy Sutton was a standout in a homemade red velvet and white 
lace creation, complete with lacy pantaloons. 
</P>
<P>
Event chairwoman Joan Richardson was outfitted as a jockey, and joked as she 
raced between chairwomanly duties, "Me? A jockey? In the last 2 days of setting 
up this party, I've eaten so many doughnuts, I don't think I'd get past the 
weigh-in room." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Matthey wore white knickers and spats because, well, "I collect antique 
cars and these go with the cars." 
</P>
<P>
Matt Schafnitz wore a silk tie with a fishing motif, "which just shows how 
confused I am," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds, not yet tallied, were expected to be $70,000, according to BBC social 
director Linda Essig.

ASK THE VET: FITNESS PROGRAM FOR DOG SHOULD BE FUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

immediate past president of the Southern California Veterinary Medical Assn.

Q: Jasper, our 7-year-old beagle, weighs almost 30 pounds and is pretty much 
confined to the back yard as his only source of exercise and entertainment. My 
husband and I are starting our own exercise program which includes some 
walking/jogging and we would like to take Jasper with us. Is there a certain 
way that we should start him with us or do you think he will be able to keep up 
without any problem? Should we change his diet or just feed him less? Jasper 
seems to be healthy and is fairly active when we are around. Will any of this 
be harmful for him? 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. R.L. Ellis, Seal Beach 
</P>
<P>
A: Beagles are usually very active dogs and are generally eager to run and 
play. Starting a diet and exercise program for a pet is very much like a 
program for ourselves. Everything should be done in graduated steps and should 
also be done on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
At Jasper's age, I would recommend a checkup by your veterinarian before 
starting a program. You need to be sure that he does not have any physical 
problems that may restrict his exercise. A target weight should be determined 
and a proper timetable established to avoid stress. 
</P>
<P>
When you take Jasper for his walks/jogs, always use a leash to keep him under 
control and make sure his collar fits properly and won't break. Don't force him 
if he starts to get tired and wants to slow down. Dogs do not sweat like people 
to lose excess heat, so avoid hot days or prolonged jogging. At the age of 7, 
he will have his physical limitations too. Let him cool down gradually and give 
him only small amounts of water on a frequent basis until he returns to his 
normal resting state. Avoid runs on asphalt or very rough surfaces in order to 
prevent injury to his paws. Most of all, make this fun for the both of you and 
enjoy the activity. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What is the proper age to wean our puppies from the mother and when should 
we find them a new home? We have six poodle-cross puppies that are now 4 weeks 
of age and starting to eat some solid foods although the mother still nurses 
them periodically. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Sallenberg, Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
A: Since your puppies are 4 weeks of age and starting to eat regular foods on 
their own, now may be a good time to start the weaning process. You can offer 
the pups regular baby cereal mixed with water as a start and gradually mix in 
regular dog food as they become more accustomed to eating on their own. This 
should take place over a 2-week period, so that by 6 weeks of age they are 
eating regular dog food without any nursing from the mother. She should stop 
nursing them on her own by this time and her mammary glands will gradually dry 
up. A good quality puppy food is the proper choice to feed these puppies and 
the amount will vary as they get older and eat more. 
</P>
<P>
Finding new homes for the pups should be done between 6 to 12 weeks of age 
since this is a prime time for socialization with humans. Advise the new owners 
of what you are feeding to avoid problems with diet changes. This is also the 
time to start the pups on their immunization programs and to have a stool 
sample checked for intestinal parasites.

IT'S PLANE TO SEE WHY MATH STUDENTS ARE CHAMPIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HOLGUIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The problem was fairly easy for Arthur Nam, a 17-year-old geometry student at 
Warren High School in Downey. 
</P>
<P>
"A plane 15 centimeters from the center of a sphere cuts the sphere in a circle 
of radius 8 centimeters. Find the diameter of the sphere." 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-four centimeters, of course. 
</P>
<P>
Nam answered that problem and 28 others correctly -- he missed only one -- to 
lead Warren High to victory in the geometry division of the 1989 National 
Mathematics League competition. More than 430 schools from across the country 
entered the geometry division, said league director Diane Riley, who released 
the final results. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, this competition was easy," said Nam, who one day would like to be 
a researcher or a professor. 
</P>
<P>
But the first-place finish was no mean feat, according to Riley. The contest 
problems are more advanced than those that would be presented in the average 
high school geometry course, she said. The league, an organization of math 
teachers, has run the contest for the last six years to stimulate interest in 
mathematics. "The schools that participate are the top schools in the country," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The competition consisted of five, 30-minute tests, with six geometry problems 
per test. It was given by teachers and administrators at participating high 
schools. School personnel used answer keys to grade the tests, and then 
reported the scores to the National Mathematics League. The top five scores in 
each round represent a school's overall score. The league relies on an honor 
system, counting on school officials to report accurate scores. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-eight Warren High students had perfect scores on the first test, but so 
did at least five students from 72 other schools. Warren and South Pasadena 
High were tied for first place with perfect scores after the second round, 
according to the league. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leading After 3 Rounds 
</P>
<P>
The Warren High students had a rougher time with the third test. The top five 
scorers missed four problems for a combined mark of 26 points out of a possible 
30. Nevertheless, Warren High held the lead after three rounds. Vestavia Hills 
High of Birmingham, Ala., and Grissom High of Huntsville, Ala., were in second 
and third places. 
</P>
<P>
One of the two problems Jane Kang missed during the competition was on the 
third test. She is Warren's second-highest scorer. 
</P>
<P>
"They test your thinking. You have to think about everything you learned and 
gather data," said Kang, a 16-year-old who says she plans to study science in 
college. 
</P>
<P>
Warren was one of four schools with perfect scores in the fourth round. At that 
point, Vestavia, last year's geometry division winner, was in second place 
trailing by four points. Warren sealed the victory when its top five scorers 
correctly answered all the problems on the fifth test. Runner-up Vestavia also 
had a perfect score on the last test. Stevenson High of Prairie View, Ill., 
came in third, with Grissom High and Berkeley Preparatory School of Tampa, 
Fla., tied for fourth place. 
</P>
<P>
Six students finished with perfect scores, while five, including Nam, missed 
only one. Riley estimated that more than 10,000 students of different ages 
participated in the geometry competition. To compete, a student must be 
enrolled in a geometry class. 
</P>
<P>
Warren will receive a plaque for the victory and the top students will receive 
ribbons. It was the first time the Downey school participated in the 
competition, said Dianne Camacho, Downey Unified School District's mentor math 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 Warren High students took one or all of the tests, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Camacho, who teaches honors geometry and other math courses, said she was proud 
of the students for winning. But perhaps more important, Camacho said, was that 
the competition enabled her to further sharpen her students' skills. 
</P>
<P>
"After the exam, I put the (missed) question on the board and said 'What would 
you do?' " Camacho said. "Sometimes they'd say: 'That's easy. Why didn't I 
think of that?' " 
</P>
<P>
Camacho attributed the school's success to hard work by instructors and 
students in their math classes. The students had no school-organized 
preparation outside of class, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Camacho also credited a testing program, in which the district has participated 
for the past five years. The program, offered through the University of 
California and the California State University and Colleges system, uses 
testing to identify students' weaknesses and enable teachers to provide better 
instruction. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's helped us a lot," Camacho said. 
</P>
<P>
Nam said he benefitted from outside math work with his father, a physicist who 
would make up problems for his son. He also said he was helped by years of 
schooling in Korea, where advanced math is taught at an earlier age than it is 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time you go to high school you're in calculus," Nam said. 
</P>
<P>
Warren's top scorers had something else in common -- they said they enjoy math. 
</P>
<P>
"Math is challenging," said Chang Kim, 14, who missed three problems during the 
competition. Kim said she also studies math on her own. She wants to be a 
doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Warren High also participated in the National Mathematics League's math 
analysis division, which required students to work 30 problems over five tests. 
The school finished 14th among 269 schools that entered the division, Riley 
said. Twenty-five students participated, Camacho said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to geometry and math analysis, the league stages competitions in 
sixth-grade math, pre-algebra, algebra I and algebra II. 
</P>
<P>
"I think next year we're going to try to (participate) in all the levels if we 
can," Camacho said. 
</P>
<P>
The Downey Unified School District has been working to improve its math program 
in recent years. It began offering advanced placement calculus three years ago. 
Twenty-two district students took calculus during the 1986-87 school year. Last 
year, 27 students took calculus, and this year, 32 students are enrolled, 
Camacho said.

POMONA EXPECTS BERTH IN PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having wrapped up third place in the Big West Conference, the Cal Poly Pomona 
women's softball team will conclude its regular season with a double-header 
against U.S. International University at 1 p.m. today at San Diego and expects 
a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos, who finished conference play at 24-12 and were four games behind 
Cal State Fullerton (28-8) and five behind Fresno State (29-7), have a 38-11 
overall record and are ranked No. 11 in the NCAA Division I coaches poll. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona is expected to earn a spot in the Division I playoffs that start next 
week. The Broncos have advanced to the playoffs in the last seven seasons. 
</P>
<P>
They won three of four games last week, including a sweep of San Diego State in 
a double-header. Pomona has been led by the hitting of all-conference catcher 
Denise Correa, infielder Shellie McCall and outfielder Nikki Busch. 
</P>
<P>
But the key to the success of the Broncos has been the pitching of senior Lori 
Thompson and sophomore Nicky Luce. Thompson has not allowed an earned run in 49 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
A transfer from San Diego State after her freshman season, Thompson recorded a 
3-0 shutout of her former team last week and also blanked Long Beach State, 
4-0. She has an 18-7 record and 0.66 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
USIU has a 15-34-1 record as a Division I independent. The Gulls are led in 
hitting by sophomore catcher Shannon Riley, who has a .273 batting average, and 
their top pitcher is freshman Cindy Oliver, who is 9-16 with a 1.67 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal Poly Pomona baseball team saw its California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
title hopes vanish by dropping two of three games against first-place Cal Poly 
San Luis Obispo last week. 
</P>
<P>
But the Broncos still have an opportunity to finish second in the conference 
entering a three-game series against Cal State Los Angeles on Friday at Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
They will play a single game at 3 p.m. Friday and a double-header at Cal State 
at 1 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona enters the final week of the conference season in third place in the 
CCAA at 14-13 and 21-28 overall. Cal State L.A. is tied with UC Riverside for 
fourth at 11-13 and 21-27. San Luis Obispo leads the conference at 19-10 and 
Cal State Northridge is second at 14-11-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos have been led by the batting of catcher Chris Goldbach, who has a 
conference-leading .397 average and leads his team with 75 hits, 51 runs batted 
in and 18 doubles. 
</P>
<P>
The hottest hitters for the Broncos recently have been outfielder Brian Grier 
and second baseman Dave Hajek. Grier has increased his average to .378 with 30 
RBIs, thanks largely to a 14-game hitting streak. Hajek has an 11-game hitting 
streak and has climbed to .349. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State L.A. has been led by outfielders Frank James and Rex De La Nuez and 
second baseman Ed Pimental. Among the pitching leaders have been starters Paul 
Spere, a freshman from Diamond Bar High, and Abdom Pinon and reliever Joe 
Cypert. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Amat, Blair and San Marino high schools have the most players selected 
to compete in the National Football Foundation and Hall of Fame All-Star Game 
on July 21 at Arroyo High School in El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
Each has four players selected to the game, which features many of the top 
graduated seniors in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Amat, which finished second in the CIF Southern Section Division I last 
season, placed quarterback Brian Harmon, offensive lineman Ken Canchola, 
linebacker Wade Kennedy and defensive back Loren Cannon on the East team. 
</P>
<P>
San Marino, which won the CIF Division VII title, landed defensive linemen Jeff 
Dolan and Mike Arens, linebacker Jerry Dietrick and defensive back Robbie 
Santos on the West. Blair will be represented on the West by tight end Jeff 
Parcell, wide receiver Demetrius McWhorter and offensive linemen Marcus Bolton 
and Roland Hemming. 
</P>
<P>
Muir had three players selected on the West, including all-valley performers 
Darick Holmes at running back and Mumbie Mushonga at tight end. Arroyo landed 
three on the West team including all-valley players Chad Plaisted on the 
defensive line and Danny Ibarra at defensive back and place-kicker. 
</P>
<P>
Standouts on the East include running backs Daryl Green of Nogales and Mike 
Galindo of Northview, offensive linemen Kenny Hall of Garey and Lou Parra of 
Los Altos and defensive back Jason Martin of Los Altos.

OLYMPIC HOPEFUL; 
</P>
<P>
FROM THAT VERY FIRST FIGHT -- BEFORE HE WAS 9 -- SHANE MOSLEY'S FATHER KNEW HE 
HAD THE ABILITY, AND HE JUST KEEPS ON WINNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It did not take long for Shane Mosley to demonstrate that he had a talent for 
boxing. 
</P>
<P>
His father says he had a strong inclination about his son's ability after he 
polished off a more experienced boxer in his first bout before he had reached 
age 9. 
</P>
<P>
"He beat an open junior," Jack Mosley remembers. "That's a guy with 10 or more 
fights. Shane won Junior Olympic tournaments, regional tournaments. It seemed 
like he won a regional tournament every year." 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Mosley has been winning with consistency. 
</P>
<P>
He has been attracting more attention since he defeated Rodney Garnett of the 
Army in the 132-pound division of the USA-Amateur Boxing Federation 
Championships last month in Colorado Springs. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the one we've been chasing," says Mosley's father, who trains his son. 
"If we could've gotten by Kelcie Banks, we could have won that last year, too." 
</P>
<P>
After winning the USA-ABF championship last year, Banks competed for the U.S. 
in the 1988 Olympics at Seoul. Mosley is hoping his son's victory in the 
tournament this year will provide the impetus for similar success, although the 
1992 Olympics in Barcelona is more than three years away. 
</P>
<P>
But winning the USA-ABF title has meant a difference in the young boxer's 
career. It has enabled the 5-8 senior at Pomona High School to move into the 
No. 1 position in the USA-ABF national rankings at 132 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
It has also qualified him for international bouts, such as his lopsided victory 
last month over John Erskine of Ireland in the U.S.-Ireland Box-Off at Las 
Vegas, Mosley's first international bout. 
</P>
<P>
"When you win a national tournament, you're No. 1 and that qualifies him for 
the Olympic Festival trials, the Canada Cup and the Junior World 
Championships," his father said. "At the end of the year he should be ready to 
do his thing." 
</P>
<P>
"Just being in those tournaments helps a lot," Shane added. "It helps people 
notice you and it helps mature you as a boxer." 
</P>
<P>
Winning the national tournament has also earned him a position in the USA-ABF's 
Operation Gold, which helps sponsor the top amateur boxers in the nation. "When 
they give you money, it's mostly for training equipment and gloves and stuff 
like that," he said. "It helps you a lot, though." 
</P>
<P>
"I think he still has a lot to learn," the father said. "He has a lot of 
physical growing and mental maturing to do and he needs to build more power. He 
has a lot of room for improvement. It just depends on how great he wants to be. 
The potential is there." 
</P>
<P>
Mosley said his son has movement and hand speed. His jab is considered his best 
punch. 
</P>
<P>
"It keeps people off balance," Shane said. "All the other punches I use well, 
but the jab is the one I use best." 
</P>
<P>
It is Mosley's quickness that earned him the nickname "Sugar" early in his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
"They just started calling me that because I was quick and I throw a lot of 
combinations," he said. "I was a thinking fighter and I'm still a thinking 
fighter. I don't just go out and throw punches for no reason." 
</P>
<P>
The elder Mosley credits his son's success partly to all-around athletic 
ability derived from competing in numerous sports from an early age. 
</P>
<P>
"He had been in karate, T-ball, everything," he said. "But he wanted to box. So 
we started him in it and it's worked out." 
</P>
<P>
Mosley has competed in football, basketball, track, cross-country, swimming and 
even dances. 
</P>
<P>
But boxing has always been his first love. 
</P>
<P>
"I just went to the gym and I like to spar and I was energetic," he said. "I'd 
just like to get into the ring and fight." 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't hurt to have motivation. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants to do it for himself," his father said. "A lot of parents force their 
kids into something, like swimming, and they're no good at it and don't really 
want to do it, and then it's just a bad scene all-around." 
</P>
<P>
That has never been a problem for Mosley, who trains for two to three hours a 
day, usually at the Pasadena Youth Athletic Club in Villa Parke. 
</P>
<P>
Mosley said his father has been his trainer all along. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel comfortable with him in my corner, and when he's not there I do what 
he's taught me," Mosley said. "I listen to other people, too, but he teaches me 
a lot. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a hard trainer. He likes people to have endurance. He stresses that. He 
wants you to be in shape." 
</P>
<P>
Mosley said he has never had problems getting his training methods across to 
his son. 
</P>
<P>
"In the gym you have other coaches that lend a hand, but ultimately I work with 
him," he said. "I like the boxer-puncher style, and that's what I've tried to 
teach him. Some guys like to stand there and slug it out, but I like a guy to 
move around. 
</P>
<P>
"I like a boxer to be flexible and work on arms and legs. Like any other sport, 
it's one where perseverance pays off. If you're true to your sport, your sport 
will be true to you, and he's a very hard worker. 
</P>
<P>
"He's busy, but we'd like to see him busier. The strength and stamina are 
pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
Mosley said the fault of not being busier led to losses against Banks and Ed 
Hopson, another top amateur. 
</P>
<P>
"They took those (fights) from him," he said. "He beat those guys but he let 
them off the hook. He's got to learn to stay on top of those guys. But he's 
still maturing." 
</P>
<P>
Maturing and growing. 
</P>
<P>
The father thinks he will grow and compete at the 147-pound welterweight level 
by the 1992 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll probably go up soon," Mosley said. "We'll see if we can hang in there 
(at 132 pounds) for the Goodwill Games (in July of 1990 at Seattle). He's going 
to start growing, though." 
</P>
<P>
Even though he says he might be capable of competing as a professional soon, 
Mosley said the lure of the Olympics is enough to keep him in the amateurs for 
a few more years. 
</P>
<P>
"If it wasn't for that, I probably would turn pro at 19, maybe even 18," he 
said. "But I will wait until the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"Making the Olympic team will make my professional career better. It's a good 
steppingstone for a pro career." 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, Mosley is thinking more about upcoming bouts. 
</P>
<P>
There is the Canada Cup and box-offs against the Soviet Union and Poland in 
June, the Olympic Festival in July and the Junior World Championships in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
But he always keeps the Olympic dream in the back of his mind.

PEPPERDINE REIGNS ON DIAMOND FOR 6TH STRAIGHT YEAR -- NCAA TOURNEY NEXT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pepperdine baseball team claimed its sixth straight West Coast Athletic 
Conference Championship by defeating archrival Loyola Marymount three times 
last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Ranked No. 14 by Collegiate Baseball, the Waves (40-14-1 overall and 20-4 in 
league) also clinched their fifth consecutive NCAA tournament berth by winning 
the conference title. Four regular-season games remain. Pairings and seedings 
for the 48-team tournament will be announced May 22. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine plays host to Stanford, the two-time defending NCAA champion, on 
Saturday at 1 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought our team played with a tremendous amount of intensity last weekend," 
first-year Coach Andy Lopez said. "I was extremely proud of the team's effort. 
It is a great feeling to win the conference championship and secure a 
tournament berth, but everyone realizes there is more work to be done this 
season." 
</P>
<P>
Dating to March 31, Pepperdine has won 23 of 25 games. 
</P>
<P>
Junior right-handed pitcher Britt Craven, senior center fielder and relief 
pitcher Rick Hirtensteiner and Lopez each garnered top WCAC honors as five 
Pepperdine players were named to the All-WCAC first team in a vote by league 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Craven and Hirtensteiner were joined on the first team by junior left fielder 
Richard Barwell, junior right-hander Wayne Helm and senior second baseman Matt 
Howard. Sophomore right fielder Jalal Leach and junior shortstop Chris Martin 
were second-team selections. 
</P>
<P>
Craven, 10-2 overall with a 3.05 ERA, who defeated all six WCAC opponents, was 
named Pitcher of the Year. Hirtensteiner, a three-time WCAC first-team 
selection, leads the Waves in batting average (.379), runs (66) and home runs 
(12). He also appeared in 10 games in relief and recorded a 3-1 record plus 
three saves and a 2.12 ERA. Lopez was named Coach of the Year.

The Pepperdine men's tennis team is waiting for the announcement on Sunday of 
pairings and seedings for the 20-team NCAA tournament to be played at Athens, 
Ga. 
</P>
<P>
According to NCAA guidelines, the top team from each of the nation's eight 
regions must be selected, and the remaining 12 teams are chosen on an at-large 
basis. Since four of the regions are not represented by teams in the Top 20, 
the No. 17 Waves find themselves in a precarious position in the viewpoint of 
the selection committee. 
</P>
<P>
"I do believe our team is deserving of an NCAA Tournament bid," said Pepperdine 
co-Coach Allen Fox. "Our schedule was extremely tough. All of our losses were 
to top-ranked teams, and we also beat a few quality opponents such as (No. 12) 
Clemson and (No. 8) TCU." 
</P>
<P>
The No. 11-seeded Pepperdine women's tennis team, 17-8 in dual matches, will 
meet the No. 7 Miami Hurricanes today at Gainesville in a first-round match in 
the NCAA championships. Miami is 18-5. 
</P>
<P>
"We are excited about our chances of pulling off an upset or two," Pepperdine 
Coach Gualberto Escudero said. "The team is well rested. Our lineup has the 
potential to be extremely dangerous. The match against Miami figures to be 
extremely close."

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 15 PROJECTS NEED NEIGHBORS' OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Torrance City Council on Tuesday unanimously approved an interim procedure 
that will require 15 Torrance property owners to win approval from their 
neighbors before they can begin work to tear down or substantially rebuild 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
The 15 projects were left in limbo last week when the council adopted an 
emergency ordinance that limits the floor area of single-family dwellings to 
60% of lot area. The projects, which exceed that limit, now cannot proceed 
until neighbors either approve plans or fail to comment after being notified by 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
If a project is controversial, the matter may be appealed to the City Council, 
a process that planning officials said can take several months. 
</P>
<P>
Several property owners objected to the new procedure, but Mayor Katy Geissert 
defended the approach. "It's been a tough issue," she said. "There are people 
who are really up-tight on both sides. . . . We are honestly trying to be 
fair." 
</P>
<P>
The interim procedure will apply only to those 15 projects. Any new proposals 
that exceed the 60% limit will be unable to proceed until the city completes a 
study on permanent size and height limits for single-family homes.

A car crashed into the main gate of the Camp David presidential retreat, 
seriously injuring the driver, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
There were no guests at the retreat in the Catoctin Mountains, and President 
Bush was in Washington at the time of the incident late Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman B. J. Cooper said the gate was heavily reinforced and was 
not damaged. "We don't have any motive at this stage," he said. "There's no 
indication that this is a plot." The driver, Mary Louise Tasler, 48, was taken 
to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore.

BUSH AIDE ASSAILS SOVIET DISPATCH BLAMING U.S. FOR PANAMA TROUBLES

sident Bush's chief spokesman today criticized the official Soviet press agency 
Tass for a dispatch blaming the United States for election disruptions in 
Panama. The spokesman said it raised new questions about Soviet intentions on 
improving relations with the West. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater called the Tass account "very 
disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly tends to throw cold water on many of the claims of a new 
thinking, a new openness in foreign relations," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Tass, in a dispatch from Panama City reporting on Wednesday's nullification of 
elections in Panama, said the action was necessary because the Panamanian 
opposition, "directly instigated by the United States," violated election laws 
and tried to rig the results through "subversive actions." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said, "These statements reflect a lack of changes that we all would 
do well to keep in mind."

President Bush said today that he is sending combat troops to Panama and 
evacuating dependents to protect Americans in the turmoil arising from a 
presidential election that the White House condemned as "electoral theft" by 
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, facing the first foreign policy crisis of his presidency, said about 
2,000 troops will be sent "to protect the lives of American citizens." About 
21,300 American civilians, many of them retired, live in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also recalled the U.S. ambassador, Arthur Davis, and said companies doing 
business in Panama will be asked to bring home dependents. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not be intimidated by the bullying tactics of the dictator, Noriega, 
brutal though they may be," Bush declared. 
</P>
<P>
Bush acted after consulting with congressional leaders, who gave him their 
backing, and with leaders of other Latin American countries. He promised to use 
"regional diplomacy" to try to remove Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"The Noriega regime first tried to steal this election through massive fraud 
and intimidation and now has nullified this election and resorted to violence 
and bloodshed," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Americans in Panama will be asked to leave the country or move within 
U.S. compounds there. The United States maintains 10 military facilities there. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he would not rule out "other steps" if needed. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also called on the armed forces of Panama -- Noriega's power base -- to 
stand up for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States stands with the Panamanian people. We share their hope that 
the Panamanian defense forces will stand with them and fulfill their 
constitutional obligation to defend democracy," he said. "The professional 
Panamanian Defense Force can have an important role to play in Panama's 
democratic future." 
</P>
<P>
Administration sources said the Pentagon was preparing to send the troops from 
Ft. Ord, Calif., and Ft. Polk, La. The sources said one group of about 1,000 
would be dispatched immediately from the 7th Light Infantry Division at Ft. 
Ord. The other, a mechanized infantry division from Ft. Polk, will be 
transported by ship and will not arrive in Panama for several days, the sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said 5th Infantry Division units from Ft. Polk will probably be 
dispatched with armored personnel carriers and only a small number of tanks. 
One official said a mechanized force would be sent as a precaution in case the 
situation deteriorates and additional protection is needed to help dependents 
evacuate. 
</P>
<P>
The sources also disclosed that a "very small" unit from the Marine Corps at 
Camp Lejeune, N.C., might be dispatched via ship transport, but declined to 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
And the officials said Bush had the option of ordering an aircraft carrier 
battle group to the region. By coincidence, the carrier America and six escorts 
departed Norfolk, Va., and two other ports today, bound for a routine 
deployment in the Mediterranean Sea. 
</P>
<P>
"The group was told to stay loose, they might have to hang a right turn," one 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush met with his national security advisers and called in congressional 
leaders to outline his plans.

PANEL NARROWLY SUPPORTS FSX PROPOSAL

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted narrowly today to approve the 
$7-billion U.S.-Japanese program to develop and co-produce the advanced FSX 
fighter plane for Japan. 
</P>
<P>
On a 9-8 vote, the committee rejected a resolution to disapprove the deal, 
which has sparked strong criticism on Capitol Hill over technological and 
economic issues. 
</P>
<P>
A companion resolution of disapproval has been introduced in the House. 
</P>
<P>
Today's committee action on the FSX followed a closed-door intelligence 
briefing for the Senate panel on Japanese involvement in a suspected Libyan 
chemical weapons complex. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Frank H. Murkowski (R-Alaska) requested the briefing, saying, "I want to 
be certain that our co-producers of the FSX, or their associates, are not also 
co-producing chemical containment components for Libya. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is Japanese involvement in Libyan chemical warfare production, we 
have the opportunity with the FSX to leverage them out," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Murkowski's concern focused on an industrial complex being built at Rabta, in 
the desert southwest of the Libyan capital of Tripoli. U.S. officials believe 
that the complex includes a poison gas plant as well as a metal fabrication 
plant to produce bomb and shell casings. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing Wednesday, Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger told 
the Senate committee that there is no evidence that Mitsubishi Heavy 
Industries, the prime Japanese contractor for the FSX, had any involvement with 
the Rabta complex. 
</P>
<P>
Even if resolutions of disapproval to try to block the FSX clear both the full 
Senate and House, a two-thirds majority in both chambers would be required to 
override a likely presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, General Dynamics and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries would jointly 
develop and produce the FSX.

Arms dealer Richard V. Secord was charged with nine new felony counts of lying 
during the 1987 congressional Iran-Contra hearings in an indictment unsealed 
today in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
Secord, a retired Air Force major general, is accused of giving false testimony 
to the House and Senate Iran-Contra committees that investigated the U.S.-Iran 
arms deals and the diversion of profits from them to the Nicaraguan rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Secord, already charged with participating in the Iran-Contra conspiracy, was 
the lead witness in the televised hearings conducted in the spring and summer 
of 1987 by the House and Senate committees. He testified without immunity from 
prosecution before the congressional panels. 
</P>
<P>
The latest indictment was returned by a federal grand jury on April 7 but was 
kept under seal until the end of the trial of former White House aide Oliver 
North, who was convicted last week of three felony counts in the Iran-Contra 
affair.

Amway Corp. said today it would sell Avon Products Inc.'s prestige fragrance 
business if its attempt to buy Avon for more than $2 billion succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
The business includes such higher-priced perfumes as Giorgio Beverly Hills, 
Oscar de la Renta, Cher, Valentino, Perry Ellis and Deneuve, which are sold in 
stores instead of by Avon's person-to-person sales force. 
</P>
<P>
Avon said the business is expected to run up sales of more than $300 million 
this year. Spokesman John Cox said the company had no comment on Amway's stated 
plan, which was in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

SENATE URGED TO REWRITE QUAYLE'S JOB TRAINING ACT

<P>
The Bush Administration today proposed rewriting the nation's major job 
training program, which was co-authored by Vice President Dan Quayle, to direct 
most spending to the poor and teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
It also warned states that their programs will have to be improved to receive 
federal support. 
</P>
<P>
"For years, the government has been distributing money to youth programs in a 
fragmented and piecemeal fashion, and sometimes without clear expectations of 
what these youths should achieve," Labor Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole told 
the Senate subcommittee on employment and productivity. 
</P>
<P>
Dole and three Job Training Partnership Act participants who attended the 
hearing were meeting with President Bush in the afternoon in a session designed 
to demonstrate the President's support for the changes. 
</P>
<P>
The amendments would significantly change the job act created by Quayle, then a 
Republican senator from Indiana, and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) that was 
highly touted by Quayle during his campaign for vice president. Dole said the 
revisions are necessary because of the changing American work force, not 
because of any major flaws in the program. 
</P>
<P>
"But JTPA can be made even better," she told the subcommittee, which has 
jurisdiction over the act. "Funds do not always reach the individuals and areas 
who need help the most. In some communities it is felt that the program does 
not always result in good jobs and a higher standard of living."

DUPONT PLAZA SETTLES FIRE LAWSUITS

<P>
The DuPont Plaza Hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico, has agreed to pay about $100 
million to settle lawsuits stemming from the New Year's Eve 1986 fire that 
killed 97 people, newspapers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Telegram of Bridgeport, Conn., and the Hartford Courant attributed the 
figure to unidentified sources. The Star Tribune of Minneapolis quoted James 
Fetterly, a Minneapolis lawyer for the hotel, as saying the settlement would be 
substantially less than the $200 million in settlements from the 1980 MGM Grand 
Hotel fire in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
A former hotel maintenance worker pleaded guilty to setting the DuPont Plaza 
fire during a labor dispute at the 22-story hotel, which was packed with almost 
1,000 tourists. More than 140 people were injured. About 2,300 plaintiffs sued 
for a total of $1.8 billion.

American Stock Exchange Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. resigned today after 11 
years heading the nation's third-largest trading system. 
</P>
<P>
Board members said they expect Levitt, 58, to take a larger role in the 
publishing industry. 
</P>
<P>
Levitt heads Levitt Communications Inc., which publishes Roll Call, a 
government news-oriented paper delivered twice weekly to the White House and 
congressmen's homes. The company in April agreed to acquire a controlling 
interest in B&amp;B Enterprises Inc., which owns the publisher of Stagebill, a 
magazine distributed at performance arts centers. 
</P>
<P>
The Amex is the nation's third-largest stock exchange, far outpaced in volume 
by the New York Stock Exchange and the National Assn. of Securities Dealers 
over-the-counter market traded electronically nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Howard Brenner, executive vice president of Drexel Burnham Lambert 
Inc., said Levitt will remain at the exchange until a replacement is named.

Rick Adelman, who became interim coach of the Portland Trail Blazers in 
February, will be retained as head coach through next season, the club 
announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Team President Harry Glickman said no other candidates were interviewed 
although team officials briefly examined a "short list" of other possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Adelman, 42, was in his sixth season as a Trail Blazer assistant coach before 
he was named interim coach Feb. 18 when the team fired Mike Schuler. His 
contract is for one year with an option for a second year. 
</P>
<P>
Adelman posted a 14-21 record through the remainder of the season and guided 
the team into the playoffs, clinching a berth by winning the final game of the 
regular season. Defending champion Los Angeles Lakers swept Portland in three 
games of the first round of the playoffs.

BEN JOHNSON HURT IN TORONTO STREET FIGHT

Ben Johnson, world record-holder in the 100-meter dash and disqualified from 
the 1988 Summer Olympics after testing positive for steroids, suffered minor 
injuries in a fight involving five men in the city's swank Yorkville District 
early today, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson had just left a nightclub and was driving his mother's car about 1:45 
a.m. when he slowed to allow a group of pedestrians to cross the street. As 
they were crossing, a man banged on Johnson's car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that when Johnson got out of the car to challenge the men, he was 
punched in the face. They said another man then jumped on the hood of the car 
and kicked in the windshield, causing $700 in damage. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson chased a suspect and held him until police arrived, Sgt. David Donald 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hurdler Mark McKoy, who was on the scene along with sprinter Desai Williams, 
also chased a suspect, police said. The three other men ran away. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's positive test for a banned steroid cost him an Olympic gold medal at 
Seoul and prompted the ongoing federal inquiry into the use of banned drugs 
among amateur athletes. 
</P>
<P>
At the inquiry today, Johnson's lawyer said the suspects knew it was Johnson in 
the car. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what most members of the public don't realize is what this young man 
goes through on a daily basis -- the verbal abuse and the physical harassment," 
Ed Futerman, Johnson's lawyer, said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was treated in a hospital for a broken tooth and swollen lip and was 
released.

PITCHERS ON THEIR GAME; 
</P>
<P>
HOME RUNS DOWN; 62 SHUTOUTS RECORDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Get ready to lower the mound or bring back the rabbit ball. Pitchers are ahead 
of hitters again. 
</P>
<P>
Home runs are way down. So are balks. Shutouts are about even with last season. 
It just seems there are more this spring. 
</P>
<P>
But it is no illusion. Kirk McCaskill, Roger Clemens and other pitchers are 
flourishing while Gary Carter, Don Mattingly and many big-name batters are 
flopping. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm off to a slow start, but I've had bad periods like this before," 
said Carter, hitting just .114 with only one home run for the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just magnified because it's at the beginning of the season," he said. "If 
this was the middle of the season, no one would notice." 
</P>
<P>
Mattingly is in another of his early-season slumps. He has not hit a home run 
and is batting .241 for the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sick and Tired of It' 
</P>
<P>
"This has happened to me before, but I'm getting sick and tired of it," 
Mattingly said. "I just want to start hitting well again." 
</P>
<P>
Overall, home runs are down 13% in the American League and off 12% in the 
National League contrasted with the same time last season. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, home runs dipped 28.7% in both leagues. That decrease came after an 
all-time record 4,458 home runs in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"The weather in the East has been terrible this year, and I think that has 
something to do with it. It's just hard to hit when the temperature is 50 
everyday and you're playing in a drizzle half the time," Yankees manager Dallas 
Green said. "We haven't taken batting practice on a regular basis because of 
the conditions." 
</P>
<P>
Some hitters are already in the swing. Kevin Mitchell, Mark McGwire, Mike 
Schmidt, Will Clark, Julio Franco and Darryl Strawberry are among those doing 
what they do best. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the Wilsons. Willie is batting .180, and Mookie is at .189. 
Candy Maldonado, John Kruk and rookie Gregg Jefferies are under .200 with Lloyd 
Moseby, Shawon Dunston, John Shelby and Rich Gedman below that, not even 
hitting their weight. 
</P>
<P>
Pitchers, meanwhile, continue to rule. For 29 straight days, starting April 10, 
there was at least one shutout somewhere in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, it was a coincidence. Shutouts are not up significantly this year," 
Seymour Siwoff, head of the Elias Sports Bureau, said. "But the early evidence 
points to another decline in hitting." 
</P>
<P>
There have been 62 shutouts this year; there were 60 at the same time last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Only Houston has not been shut out. Cincinnati got blanked in three straight 
games for the first time since 1951 and has been shut out six times. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, the Mets, who pitched 22 shutouts last year and had seven at this 
time, are one of three teams without one. 
</P>
<P>
The California Angels, who had nine in 1988, have seven shutouts so far. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the staff ever doubted that we had the ability," said McCaskill, 
who leads the AL with an 0.89 earned run average. "It was a matter of health 
and consistency." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Morgan, traded from Baltimore to Los Angeles before the season, leads the 
majors with an 0.69 ERA. Dave Stewart is the top winner at 6-0 with Dwight 
Gooden at 5-1 and Clemens at 4-1.
