REP. BURTON ON ERADICATING COCA CROPS IN SOUTH AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What arrogance Burton displays! To suggest that the United States should 
undertake to wipe out the coca fields in South America "with or without the 
cooperation of its (elected) leaders," reveals a contempt for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
How would Americans feel if some self-righteous foreign nation undertook to 
wipe out our tobacco fields "with or without" the consent of the American 
people? 
</P>
<P>
Why do the impoverished people of South America grow coca? During the last few 
decades, the United States applied strong economic pressures for countries like 
Bolivia to adopt economic policies that would encourage "export crops" like 
sugar and, yes, bananas. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the U.S.-backed governments pushed the poverty-stricken people off 
the good land where they could raise their own potatoes, then pushed them off 
the land where they could survive on corn, and on and on until they found 
themselves on land where they couldn't grow food very well. What grows well 
there? Coca. 
</P>
<P>
Burton expects "hostility by the international community." How astute you are, 
Mr. Burton, especially given the results of previous U.S. plans. He wants to 
destroy the ecology of Latin American in a harebrained scheme to wipe out a 
robust native plant. Trying to eradicate coca in South America would be about 
as successful as trying to wipe out crabgrass in Washington.

<P>
JIMMY BRESLIN: THE COLUMNIST FLEW INTO A RAGE. NOW IT'S THE DEBATE ABOUT WHAT 
HE SAID THAT'S RAGING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Tony Kornheiser's column in the Washington Post. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last Friday, Jimmy Breslin burst out of his office at New York Newsday and 
spouted off sexist and racist invectives against an Asian-American colleague, a 
reporter, who had written an internal memo complaining of sexism in his column. 
Newsday has suspended him for two weeks without pay. Following are two views on 
the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people have lumped Breslin with Al Campanis, Jimmy the Greek and Andy 
Rooney, all of whom came under fire for stupid remarks. The differences are in 
where and how Breslin spoke. Rooney's comments were made to an interviewer. 
Campanis and The Greek spoke on camera. Had Breslin said this on TV or written 
it in his column, he would be fired, and justifiably. But he launched his 
tirade in the newsroom. 
</P>
<P>
You'll have to trust me on this; the newsroom has always been one of those 
places where people rant and rave. To folks who work there, the inside of a 
newspaper, like the inside of a locker room, is not a public place -- it's more 
like the family den. Rowdy comments are passed there that are never intended to 
be brought to public light. You fire all the reporters and editors who've 
shouted repulsive, obnoxious taunts at one another, there won't be anybody left 
to turn out the lights. 
</P>
<P>
Campanis, The Greek and Rooney spoke temperately, of things they believed. 
Breslin lashed out in rage, without thinking. It's how he's always been. 
</P>
<P>
He quickly apologized to the entire staff and sent a private letter to Ji-Yeon 
Mary Yuh. Apologies can be easy to make and they don't excuse the behavior. 
</P>
<P>
But if his comments are inexcusable, are they forever unforgivable? We all have 
prejudices. Part of the struggle for all of us is to keep them in check. 
Breslin simply has to try harder.

BEEFING UP THE CLEAN AIR ACT; 
</P>
<P>
BUT AN AMENDED MEASURE IS A LONG WAY FROM LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years Washington has ignored its own policy requiring that local 
transportation systems match local clean-air plans and goals. But now here 
comes the U.S. Senate with a list of quite simple but, for an 
automobile-oriented society, revolutionary ways to make the policy work. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, the Senate says that if air chemists agree a region's air cannot 
tolerate the pollution from more than, say, 5 million cars, the region cannot 
build a highway network to carry 6 million of them. 
</P>
<P>
This seems such basic good sense that the obvious question is why it didn't 
occur to somebody before. It did. The idea has been federal policy since the 
Clean Air Act was last amended in 1977, but the wording of the act was so loose 
that dubious highway projects kept slipping through. In voting to amend the act 
again this year, the Senate included a series of steps to slow down highway 
spending when a region must choose between cleaner air and more automobiles on 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of cutting off highway funds to regions that fail to clean up their 
air, which seldom happens anyway, the Senate proposes to keep transportation 
money flowing to non-complying states but restricting its use to projects that 
promote cleaner air, such as construction of rail-transit systems and programs 
to expand ride-sharing. 
</P>
<P>
A drastic change would let state governors divert federal highway funds to rail 
construction or other projects designed to reduce automobile pollution. Over 
the years, the so-called highway lobby has guarded the federal highway trust 
fund against such raids. Token sums have been diverted from highways to rail 
systems, but nothing on the scale of the Senate plan. Thus the lobby is almost 
certain to try to block it. 
</P>
<P>
For clean-air planning, the attraction of rail is clear. A commuter driving 
alone generates eight times as many hydrocarbons during rush hour as a commuter 
riding the rails. 
</P>
<P>
What encouraged the Senate to tighten up the machinery for designing and 
funding transportation networks? Apparently the pioneering work done by the 
Southern California Assn. of Governments in its regional mobility plan, 
published in 1989. The local plan persuaded the Senate that making 
transportation plans conform to clean-air goals is workable, not wishful 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
An amended Clean Air Act is a long way from law. The House plans to vote on its 
own bill before the end of the month, but there will be enough difference 
between the two versions to touch off a grueling, perhaps even brutal, 
conference, considering the likely lobbying frenzy to negotiate away 
disparities. The Senate language still is fuzzy on the question of who bears 
the ultimate responsibility for making the revolutionary new approach work. 
</P>
<P>
There is a warning in the Southern California mobility plan that applies just 
as well to other metropolitan areas. Noting that if Southern Californians do 
not change their transportation habits over the next 20 years, they would waste 
more than 16 times as many hours sitting in traffic jams in 2010 as they do 
now, the report said: 
</P>
<P>
"The streets and roads of the region simply cannot accommodate the additional 
traffic suggested by these projections, even with virtually unlimited 
construction. But perhaps even more important, the automobile is one of the 
major causes of the region's severe air-quality problem . . . . " The dilemma 
can't be put any more clearly. The Senate's Clean Air Bill should be enacted 
and signed by President Bush.

REP. BURTON ON ERADICATING COCA CROPS IN SOUTH AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Burton ignores two laws: the Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act of 1989, 
U.S.; and the resolution by the United Nations, signed by 80 nations, to 
control drug abuse and chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
If these laws were fully implemented, we could shut down most, if not all, drug 
production in the Andean nations. 
</P>
<P>
It would not be necessary to violate the borders, infiltrate nor negotiate with 
the countries. 
</P>
<P>
The laws prohibit the importation of the necessary chemicals to make cocaine. 
The drug war can be won by an offshore, peaceful shutdown of these chemicals. 
It will not be necessary to eradicate crops or create hostility by using 
air-dropped plant-killing chemicals that will no doubt go astray and create 
other problems. 
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that any activity within the producing nations will be met with 
strong resistance, assassinations, etc. The laws are in place -- now for the 
will to use them.

Father Boyle expressed the economic and social tragedy facing millions of 
Mexican and South American immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
And the good father is right -- it is our duty to help out the less fortunate. 
But the Catholic Church's generous offer of U.S. tax dollars isn't going to 
solve the problem. Modern birth control will solve the problem. If women used 
their God-given intelligence and reproduced responsibly, a great deal of 
poverty would be eradicated.

I feel obliged to respond to Father Gregory J. Boyle's column "Still They Come; 
There Is No Choice," Commentary, May 3: 
</P>
<P>
Everything in it is admirable, but I want to add a few words of my own. 
</P>
<P>
In 1951 my husband and I immigrated to this country as "displaced persons" from 
a refugee camp in southern Italy. 
</P>
<P>
We came legally. (I know well what it is to be an immigrant.) We were both 
Yugoslavs (specifically Serbs), and in addition I was a Yugoslav Jew. While 
everybody is aware that in an Anglo society we were not of optimum descent, we 
were still accepted fairly. 
</P>
<P>
Now we, the former "displaced persons," have an occasion every week to be 
confronted with a scene of would-be immigrants from Latin America. As we are 
returning from San Diego, where we visit our son, we pass through a Border 
Patrol checkpoint. The cars line up, the guards wave everybody by -- except 
those people who have the misfortune of having Latino color and features. Only 
they are instructed to park on the side, only their trunks are opened as guards 
look for "illegals." 
</P>
<P>
My heart cries out "Shame, shame! You guards are only carrying out orders, but 
you congressmen and you, Mr. President, can't you change the laws, can't you 
make them more humane?" 
</P>
<P>
Up to this moment my cry has been only silent, but if enough of us voice our 
anguish, perhaps some laws will be changed.

Kennedy Controversy: Rhode Island State Rep. Patrick Kennedy, 22, has had a 
run-in with the Catholic Church over the abortion issue, just as his father, 
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), did. Kennedy was to speak at Prout Memorial High 
School in South Kingstown, R.I., last Sunday, but the engagement was canceled 
because of Kennedy's abortion rights' stance. Kennedy said he planned to urge 
students to get involved and "make a difference." He did not plan to discuss 
abortion. Almost a year ago, the St. Vincent de Paul Society canceled an 
appearance by Sen. Kennedy in Providence. Both Kennedys favor abortion rights.

MARIONETTES IN AN AUSSIE MORALITY PLAY; 
</P>
<P>
TAKING SHELTER BY JESSICA ANDERSON VIKING $17.95, 232 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE KENDALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recipient of Australia's two major literary awards for fiction, Jessica 
Anderson concerns herself in "Taking Shelter" with the somewhat tardy impact of 
AIDS on the previously carefree morality of her country's younger generation. 
So far, that impact seems to have been largely intellectual -- a troubling 
possibility rather than a frightful reality. References to the disease have a 
curiously remote and theoretical quality, almost as if the allusions were 
inserted into the novel as an afterthought to an otherwise bland story. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Jeams is a wispy young woman of 20, engaged to the sophisticated and 
ambitious Miles Ligard. After an intense courtship, Beth and Miles become 
lovers, but now Miles has inexplicably decided that they should remain chaste 
until their marriage. 
</P>
<P>
There have been unsettling rumors about Miles' sexual preferences, and dark 
hints that he may be planning to marry Beth only because of his political 
ambitions. Beth summons her entire stock of courage and asks Miles' elderly 
cousin Julia McCracken if there is any truth to the gossip. 
</P>
<P>
Julia, who has strongly favored the marriage out of deep affection for Miles, 
is forced to confront the morality of her position, which she does in a series 
of dreams, sequences that bring the pace of the novel virtually to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
When Beth asks Miles flat out if he is a homosexual, he says, "At this time of 
my life it is a preference, which doesn't mean that it will remain one. It's 
known to quite a number of discreet and decent people, including my parents, 
who have always been simply splendid about it. As I took it for granted you 
would be too, Beth." 
</P>
<P>
Beth, however, is not quite able to be simply splendid about spending her life 
as the public cover for her fiance's private life, and in short order, she 
abandons Miles. Almost at once, she meets and falls in love with Marcus Pirie, 
whose sexual preference is unambiguous, though he had been the lover of Beth's 
promiscuous cousin Kyrie in the uninhibited '70s, when Sydney was apparently 
the sexual hub of the Antipodes. The subject of AIDS arises again when Beth and 
Marcus are tested for the virus. Before the results are in, Beth learns that 
she's pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
Long discussions, eerily reminiscent of American soap-opera summaries, ensue. 
Will Marcus marry Beth and settle down into faithful domesticity? Can they be 
absolutely sure that Beth hasn't become infected with AIDS via Miles? 
</P>
<P>
These matters are still unsettled when Marcus' mother, Nita, arrives for an 
extended stay in the newly established love nest. Representing the sexual 
values of the older generation, Nita is in flight from her philandering 
husband, who has not only appropriated her interest in their jointly owned 
restaurant, but also betrayed her with a teen-age employee. 
</P>
<P>
Happily, the ever-present Juliet McCracken comes to the rescue by arranging for 
the financially embarrassed Nita to work as housekeeper for Juliet's aunt. Now 
that Beth has found true love with Marcus, Julia does everything she can to 
ensure the permanence of the match, thereby atoning for her previous efforts on 
behalf of Miles. 
</P>
<P>
Though the novel is crowded with characters illustrating a wide variety of 
sexual manners and mores, 68-year-old Juliet McCracken is the most pivotal. 
Though married twice, she has decided that she's "one of those rare creatures 
born without sexual feelings." As such, she functions as a sort of moral 
puppeteer, pulling the strings that put these wooden figures through their 
paces. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Beth, Miles, Marcus, Kyrie, Nita, nor the briefly met homosexual 
couple, ever manages to become more than marionettes illustrating the range of 
attitudes prevailing in Australia in the late '8Os, attitudes not only observed 
from Juliet's vast emotional distance but removed still further from the 
American reader by time, language and geography.

Will women continue to follow Candice Bergen's fashion lead when she appears on 
"Murphy Brown" dressed as a lavender lampshade? In the two-part season finale 
(Monday nights at 9 on CBS), Bergen, who often wears Donna Karan clothes on the 
series, is decked out as an antebellum bridesmaid for the wedding of Faith Ford 
(Corky Sherwood). Bill Hargate, the show's celebrated costumer, designed the 
five bridesmaid's hoop-skirted, triple-tiered, lace-trimmed confections to 
reflect Corky's Southern roots. "We had to rehearse with the hoops so they 
could get used to wearing them," Hargate said. "You forget how much room they 
really take. We had to rearrange some furniture a couple of times."

* SUN-SENSITIVE: Estee Lauder's Baby Sun, a PABA-free sunscreen for infants 
that has an SPF (sun protection factor) of 30, debuts later this month. The 
product evolved from a request from Estee Lauder's grandson, William, according 
to Ida Stewart, vice president of Estee Lauder. William recalls having to wear 
a hat, a long-sleeved shirt and pants to protect himself from the sun. He asked 
his grandmother to create a product so his children could run unfettered in the 
sunshine.

* CAFE SOCIETY: The NBC miniseries "People Like Us" (airing May 13 and 14), 
adapted from Dominick Dunne's novel about New York's high-society set, is a 
study in style, from the old money elegance of Carolina Herrera, Gianfranco 
Ferre and Carolyne Roehm for Eva Marie Saint's character to the modern flair of 
Valentino, Escada and Isaac Mizrahi for the nouveau nob played by Connie 
Selleca. Most everything, reports costume designer Buffy Snyder, came off the 
rack from Saks Fifth Avenue, Bullock's, I. Magnin and Barneys New York, 
including sale-priced Donna Karan blazers, Christian Lacroix accessories and 
assorted scarfs, which Snyder made into sarong skirts and bandeau tops for the 
fashion show segment. But Ben Gazzara and other leading men are likely to be 
wearing just one name: Nino Cerruti.

* RODEO COME LATELY: Is Rodeo Drive passe? "Absolutely not," huffed French 
designer Bernard Perris (sounds like Paris), who was there last week for the 
official opening of a new Rodeo Collection boutique featuring "the total look" 
of his creations. The small, three-shades-of-gray Perris boutique is owned by 
Gloria Blackburn, who also owns Jean Claude Jitrois, also on Rodeo Drive. 
Perris agreed on a business relationship with Blackburn because he likes her 
style. Not only is she "a tall, beautiful blonde who wears Perris tremendously 
well," she's "a career woman. That's what fascinated me. She's made her own 
success." After she saw the Perris boutique in New York, she decided she wanted 
one just like it on Rodeo Drive. "It's still the avenue on the West Coast," 
said Perris. 
</P>

* GRAY FLANNEL SUIT: For once, the man behind the fashion shoot is going to 
show the world what he wears. Matthew Rolston, the celebrity portraitist whose 
photos appear regularly on the covers of Vanity Fair, Harpers Bazaar, Interview 
and L.A. Style, takes the stage himself at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre May 15 to 
talk about his work. His outfit, he says, will be the one he always wears after 
5: a gray flannel suit and a white shirt. Jim McCreary, head of the L.A. 
chapter of Advertising Photographers of America, got Rolston this latest 
assignment. He's fourth in an annual series, after Helmut Newton, Annie 
Leibovitz and Herb Ritts.

* OPENING DOORS: "I met him when he was working on 'Evita.' He told me when the 
right project came along, he'd call me," says costume designer Marlene Stewart 
of her first encounter with director Oliver Stone. Stewart is costuming Stone's 
current film based on the life of the Jim Morrison, lead singer for The Doors 
and a '60s rock icon. (Val Kilmer plays the lead.) "The '60s was a time of 
total freedom and experimentation. Fashion wasn't just one look: It seemed to 
change with each person, with each year. The challenge is being able to capture 
the essence of what people were expressing about that revolutionary era through 
their clothes," says Stewart.

'Bonfire' Gets Hotter: Another controversy surrounding the filming of "Bonfire 
of the Vanities" is starting to flame up. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey Supreme Court Chief Justice Robert Wilentz is refusing to allow the 
producers to film in the Essex County Courthouse, saying the scene would be a 
negative portrayal of blacks. The scene calls for Morgan Freeman, playing a 
judge, to dismiss charges against Tom Hanks' character, touching off a riot by 
blacks. Wilentz says it could undermine blacks' confidence in the court system. 
The movie already has drawn criticism from officials in the Bronx for its 
depiction of the borough, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art has not allowed 
the producers to film inside the museum. GREG BRAXTON

Watching While You Work: Word that hundreds of thousands of Americans watch TV 
at work may trouble their bosses, but it was welcome news to network 
executives. An A. C. Nielsen Co. study estimated that more than 1 million TV 
viewers aren't counted by current rating methods because they watch at work, in 
bars or other places. GREG BRAXTON

Jerry Lewis Angered: Jerry Lewis has lashed out at a National Enquirer report 
that he will play a diminished role in the Muscular Dystrophy Telethon he has 
headed for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, come on, if you're gonna lie, at least make up something that has some 
meat to it," Lewis said. The paper reported that Lewis went "berserk" when 
informed that he had been stripped of his production duties and would be 
primarily the telethon's emcee. The story said the move was made in a January 
MDA board meeting because telethon ratings were slipping and contributions were 
not as high as expected. Lewis and MDA officials denied the claims. GREG

Downbeat Cannes: The 43rd Cannes film festival opened on a somber note Thursday 
night with Akira Kurosawa's "Dreams," an exploration of the famed Japanese 
director's hopes, fears and premonitions of death. 
</P>
<P>
Fear was the key to the eight dream sequences that comprised the 80-year-old 
artist's 28th and most personal film. It is already being spoken of as 
Kurosawa's last testament. But Kurosawa made it clear he was not finished yet, 
saying he hoped eventually to be able to film three dreams omitted from the 
original work because of expensive special effects required. GREG BRAXTON

'BIG BANG' A WITTY, VENAL LOOK AT FILMMAKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the genial documentary "The Big Bang" opens, its director is wooing a money 
man across a dinner table with that patented combination of cool and fervor 
that constitutes the perfect pitch. The filmmaker may be a little fuzzy about 
his project, but it came to him at the Shangri La Hotel when he realized he 
knew how it all started. 
</P>
<P>
"How what started?" the backer asks, carefully. 
</P>
<P>
"The cosmos," the director expands, "with the orgasmic explosion of God." 
</P>
<P>
And that's what he wants the backer to put up money for a film with no stars, 
no script, no sets, just a buncha people talking about the Big Question. And 
besides God and orgasms, they'll touch on creation and disintegration, life, 
love, sex, crime, madness, death, everything. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, this opening is all a bit disingenuous. The money is already, as 
they say, on the screen. Prospective backer Joseph Kanter, whose last time out 
was as a co-executive producer of "Ironweed," is "The Big Bang's" producer; the 
ebullient James Toback ("Fingers," "Love and Money") is its director, and the 
film is already underway. And for a movie whose staple element is conversation 
and revelation -- blurted or weighed for effect -- it's a surprisingly 
interesting way to spend an evening. 
</P>
<P>
Although the guests never do solve the Big One, "The Big Bang" (at the AMC 
Century 14 and Beverly Center Cineplex) has wit and unfolding moments of 
poignancy, unexpected depths and a flash or two of pure venality -- just enough 
to keep the eyes open wide and the jaw a little dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Toback blandly describes his guests by their professions. In outline, it sounds 
like the cast of an epic disaster movie: a model, a philosopher/nun, a writer, 
a medical student, a gangster, two children, an astronomer, a painter, a 
"survivor." A few people may spot New York restauranteuse Elaine Kaufman of 
Elaine's, NBA notable Darryl Dawkins, violinist Eugene Fodor, New Yorker 
magazine humorist Veronica Geng, jazz saxophonist Julius Hemphill, former light 
heavyweight boxing champ Jose Torres and producer Don Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
You can find tragedy, irony, banality, self-importance. There are lives pulled 
back from suicide by a sheer act of will, stories that have the patina of many 
repetitions and some that seem to come out spontaneously, even in this 
hot-house environment. There may even be a surprise or two, like filmmaker 
Simpson's account of his hellfire and damnation Southern Baptist upbringing in 
Alaska, and of a life lived in retaliation for it. ("Love is not something that 
I understand. . . .") 
</P>
<P>
As frequently happens, intrinsic natures come across absolutely. Some are 
self-effacing and all the more interesting for it: Anne Marie Keyes, a 
philosopher who is a member of the order of Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Mary 
and was this year one of the international team of observers at the elections 
in Nicaragua; novelist Barbara Traub, an Auschwitz survivor, is marked by a 
remarkable clarity and lack of self pity; Elaine Kaufman is a nice, brisk whiff 
of New York smelling salts. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes-actor (for Toback) Tony Sirico is defined by the movie as a 
"gangster"; is that what gangsters call themselves? Aren't they all 
entrepreneurs? Or venture capitalists? A few, like Darryl Dawkins, come on 
strong -- "I'm 6-foot-11 inches of steel and sex appeal and I try to live up to 
that" -- then develop unexpected vulnerability. And some, pick your candidate, 
just sail off like hot-air balloons. 
</P>
<P>
While the deliberately crisscross editing of Stephanie Kempf keeps the R-rated 
film moving briskly and probably glosses over a few wobbly thought processes, 
it sometimes breaks up a narrative or makes it unnecessarily melodramatic. Yet, 
all in all, this is fascinating stuff. 
</P>
<P>
And when Don Simpson -- cheerfully grandstanding an image -- says, "I would 
kill somebody with absolutely no compunction if they transgressed me. . . . I 
have seen people killed -- I have seen them killed in the act of self-defense, 
not by me, by somebody else -- it was justified, and you know what . . . that's 
show biz," one or two people may be more inclined to believe the tone and the 
words of the man than any previous image concocted by a publicity department. 
</P>

SENSUAL SURPRISE IN CLEVER 'BODY CHEMISTRY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every blockbuster movie can be expected to yield carbon copies, but Concorde's 
modestly budgeted "Body Chemistry" (citywide) is something different: it 
emulates "Fatal Attraction" only to improve upon it in several ways. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Singer stars as Tom Redding, a respected human sexuality researcher with a 
beautiful, loving wife (Mary Crosby), small son (H. Bradley Barneson), a nice, 
large house and a bright future. Indeed, he's a top candidate to move up to 
director of the lab, and a new project is sure to cinch the promotion. The 
hitch is that the project consultant Dr. Claire Archer (Lisa Pescia), who wants 
to prove that a lust for power is the prime ingredient in the sex drive, is 
intent upon practicing what she preaches -- on Tom. With the speed of 
lightning, Claire seduces him, and as he later remarks, takes him "beyond my 
limits." She uncovers in him a need to be dominated in sex that he never knew 
he possessed, and in doing so, leads him to experience levels of sexual ecstasy 
he never before imagined. 
</P>
<P>
Like Michael Douglas in "Fatal Attraction," Tom soon comes to his senses, 
realizing he's jeopardizing both marriage and career, but Claire proves to be 
as crazy as Glenn Close: she's not about to turn him loose. Director Kristine 
Peterson and writer Jackson Barr explore, with both sensuality and discretion, 
the psychology of sexual danger to a far greater extent than the makers of 
"Fatal Attraction" did. They suggest that the capacity for self-destructiveness 
that threatens Tom lurks within everyone: it's only a matter of the right 
person and circumstance to bring it out. This is far more legitimately 
disturbing than the effect of "Fatal Attraction" which exploited the widespread 
unconscious fear of the liberated woman represented by Close. Pescia's Claire 
hearkens back to an icon almost as old as the movies themselves: the vamp; 
Claire is really a contemporary Theda Bara. Yet, unlike "Fatal Attraction," 
"Body Chemistry" dares to take Tom's predicament to its logical extreme. 
</P>
<P>
With a bodybuilder's physique and a boyish face, Singer is perfectly cast to 
express the contradictions within the increasingly tormented Tom. Pescia, in 
her big screen debut, is certainly sexy and confident, and Crosby, who bears an 
uncanny resemblance to "Fatal Attraction's" wife, Anne Archer, is properly 
perplexed. David Kagen and Elizabeth Harnett impress as Tom's lonely playboy 
colleague and his loyal but hard-pressed secretary. Joseph Campanella is Tom's 
profit-minded boss. "Body Chemistry" (rated R for considerable if tasteful sex) 
is both stylish and darkly surprising.

'FAR OUT MAN' RESURRECTS HIPPIE ERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One satisfied viewer at a screening of Tommy Chong's "Far Out Man" (citywide), 
exclaimed "A blast from the past!" That is surely the only way to look at this 
zany business about a rocker stuck in the '60s, seemingly permanently 
traumatized by the departure of his wife after firing her for being a terrible 
backup singer. For this comedy to work for you, you've really got to be still 
amused by Chong's familiar pothead humor, not an easy task for everyone now 
that we're in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Chong seems to be resurrecting his old persona in order to move 
beyond it, both as an actor and as a writer-director. That's the right 
direction, but in the meantime, like it or not, we're asked to think of someone 
who's stoned all the time as funny. (Who but Chong would even think of trying 
to make a joke out of a drug overdose?) 
</P>
<P>
You may find yourself more amused by Chong's relatives than him. Chong's 
gorgeous daughter, Rae Dawn, plays the Far Out Man's daughter, who is forever 
having her big movie scenes interrupted by her father. It's Rae Dawn who at 
last manages to get a psychiatrist (Martin Mull, quite funny) to treat her dad 
at his ramshackle Hippieland lair, with the roundabout result that the Far Out 
Man eventually tries to get his act together by becoming a roadie. 
</P>
<P>
Chong's real-life wife, Shelby, plays his ex-wife, who has taken up with C. 
Thomas Howell (Rae Dawn's real-life husband) in hopes of advancing her career 
as an actress. Shelby Chong is hilarious as a send-up of every sexy celebrity 
wife intent on having her own career, regardless of whether or not she is 
talented, and Howell is also a delight in his own send-up of Brat Packer 
pretensions. 
</P>
<P>
Serving as the linchpin in this rambling adventure is Paris Chong, Tommy and 
Shelby's teen-age son, who plays "Far Out Man's" dismayingly studious kid who 
never met his father. In cameos are Paul Bartel, Judd Nelson and Michael 
Winslow. 
</P>
<P>
There's an amiable nonchalance in Chong's film (rated R); let's hope that his 
next venture is as much a departure and breakthrough for him as his former 
partner Cheech Marin's "Born in East L.A."

DANCERS' INDIVIDUALITY LOST IN AILEY PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre turned to works not created by 
the company founder, Wednesday at the Wiltern Theatre, it still honored Ailey 
by emphasizing his generous support of other choreographers. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, although the company danced with superb control and commitment, 
works by Ulysses Dove, Donald Byrd and Talley Beatty relied upon 
all-too-familiar, hard-sell sexuality or massed effects, all but burying the 
individuality of these worthy dancers. 
</P>
<P>
If some choreographers seem content to tackle the battle of the sexes, Dove, in 
his new "Episodes" -- receiving its first Los Angeles performance -- appears to 
be taking on World War III. 
</P>
<P>
Against Robert Ruggieri's percussive electronic score, Dove sets dancers 
hurtling down diagonal corridors created by John B. Read's dramatic lighting 
design. Men and women meet, or rather hurl themselves at each other. 
</P>
<P>
The men are almost invariably tough, arrogant and swaggering monsters; the 
women, cool, contemptuous, hysteric or needy. Tenderness, where it exists at 
all, is reduced to a stroke of a palm. Get-togethers are slam, bam, 
no-thank-you, m'am. The person with the most attitude wins. 
</P>
<P>
When the music runs out, Dove adds a final heel-stomping section in silence for 
the nine dancers, who regard each other coldly before turning and walking away. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the choreography requires split-second timing and virtuoso power, which 
the dancers handled with ease. The audience yelled approval for every backward 
bend to the floor, catch in the air or "so-what?" swagger. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the violent sexual pairings envisioned by Dove, the hard-driving 
Spanish-flavored nightclub encounters at the close of Beatty's "Come and Get 
the Beauty of It Hot" (to a compiled score) looked positively healthy. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the mock-fighting episode, danced with relish by Raquelle Chavis and 
Michael Joy, could be regarded only as a hoot. Marilyn Banks also brought 
cheers from the audience with her extensions and balances on the ladder in the 
"Rooftops and Stairwells" section. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd's "Shards" (music by Mio Morales) begins and ends with a group cluster 
that may be an homage to Ailey's "Revelations" (as are the hovering arm 
movements). 
</P>
<P>
But as the work unfolds, Twyla Tharp appears to be a major influence, as a 
balletic couple (Dana Hash and Andre Tyson) offer serene, supported arabesques 
amidst a swirl of vigorous or funky company movement. The only problem is that 
the work quickly loses focus and coherence. CHRIS PASLES

JAZZ NOTES: A CLUB THAT WORKS: CHADNEY'S IN BURBANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the latest tally of openings and closings of Los Angeles jazz spots, the 
score is 3 to 1 for the good guys. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, there are only two new venues to report -- the Silver Screen Lounge 
and Sasch -- but why not count Chadney's, since, as of a week or two ago, the 
Burbank room has increased its jazz schedule to seven nights a week. The lone 
closure was Churchill's in Glendale, which decided to drop the jazz policy in 
favor of Top 40 groups after giving the music a scant two-week tryout. Heard 
that song before? 
</P>
<P>
With proper presentation, jazz can work. Chadney's is a perfect example. "We 
went to jazz three nights a week almost a year ago, and the popular response 
has allowed us to extend the schedule as planned," said Chadney's owner Steve 
Hoeller, in a press release. 
</P>
<P>
The reopening of the Silver Screen Lounge is reason for celebration. During the 
early '80s the nightspot, located in a ground floor corner of the Hyatt on 
Sunset Hotel (8401 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood, (213) 656-1234), presented 
such greats as pianists Tommy Flanagan and Hank Jones and the late saxmen Eddie 
(Lockjaw) Davis and Warne Marsh. The current policy, co-sponsored by the Hyatt 
and the Los Angeles Jazz Society, will feature jazz artists Thursday-Saturday, 
9:30 p.m.-1:30 a.m. There will be no cover charge. 
</P>
<P>
Guitarist John Collins' quartet kicks off the series on Thursday, followed next 
by Don and Alicia Cunningham with the Al Aarons Quartet, then by Bob Cooper's 
quartet and the Clayton Brothers, and many more. 
</P>
<P>
And there's Sasch, the rock haunt in Studio City (11345 Ventura Blvd., (818) 
769-5555) that now offers a Sunday Jazz and Fusion series at 7:30 p.m. This 
Sunday, it's flutist Tim Weisberg and guitarist Jeff Richman, with pianist Rob 
Mullins and the group Accent scheduled for May 20. Cover charges vary. 
</P>
<P>
JAZZ GOES TO SCHOOL: The sound of jazz will spread to four junior and high 
school campuses under a program co-sponsored by the International Assn. of Jazz 
Appreciation (IOAJA) and the Playboy Jazz Festival. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, saxman Herman Riley's foursome plays for students of Washington 
High School in Los Angeles at 1:20 p.m. On Friday, the IOAJA Goes to School 
Band, with bassist Larry Gales and drummer Ndugu Chancler, performs at Sun 
Valley Junior High School in Sun Valley (10:40 a.m.), and trumpeter Bobby 
Rodriguez' Latin/jazz band entertains the troops at Stevenson Junior High in 
Los Angeles (1 p.m.). The brief series wraps up on Tuesday,with a performance 
by trombonists Buster Cooper and Thurman Green at Canoga Park High in Canoga 
Park at 10:30 a.m. Following each concert, the musicians will hold clinics for 
interested students. 
</P>

BASSIST ON THE MOVE: The above-mentioned Larry Gales, currently part of the 
back-up band (see below) working with singer Jon Hendricks at St. Mark's in 
Venice through Saturday, is heading back to New York for some well-deserved 
exposure. "I'm going home," said the former Thelonious Monk sideman, referring 
to his native Manhattan, during intermission at the Venice club. "I'm going to 
do a quartet date at Bradley's, with tenor saxophonist Junior Cook, pianist 
Walter Davis Jr. and drummer Ben Riley, and then later I'll do a sextet stint 
at Birdland." Gales plans to record the sextet. 
</P>
<P>
Gales, who worked and recorded with Monk -- alongside drummer Riley and the 
late saxophonist Charlie Rouse -- during the mid-to-late '60s, was featured 
prominently in the recent film, "Straight No Chaser: The Music of Thelonious 
Monk." "That really helped me," he said. "These New York dates are the result 
of that film." 
</P>
<P>
MORE HENDRICKS QUARTET TIDBITS: Pianist Benny Green, whose Blue Note debut, 
"Lineage," is due out in early June, is working all over. The New York-based 
artist, whom Angelenos have heard here with Betty Carter and Art Blakey, goes 
to San Francisco after the Hendricks gig to do a solo recital. He'll perform a 
similar program at the JVC Newport in New York festival in June. The 
up-and-coming giant will also appear with altoist Bobby Watson's band in the 
Midwest this month, and at Bradley's with a trio led by tenor ace Ralph Moore. 
This summer, he heads to Europe as part of a quintet headed by trumpeter 
Freddie Hubbard. 
</P>
<P>
Splendid saxophonist Noel Jewkes, an off-and-on Hendricks associate for over 20 
years who all but never plays the Southland, said he's working a lot in his San 
Francisco base, "though it's not always jazz," he noted. "That's not so great, 
but it's good to be working. I am looking to perform more with a seven-piece 
band for which I have about 70 charts, including many originals." 
</P>
<P>
Drummer Eddie Moore, who has played L.A. with the likes of vibist Bobby 
Hutcherson, looked much trimmer than usual on Wednesday. "I've lost 78 pounds," 
he beamed on his way to the bandstand.

STAGE BEAT: MAMET'S 'SHAWL' FEELS LIKE AN EARLY WORK AT THE WATERFRONT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Mamet has, jokingly perhaps, referred to his 1985 play, "The Shawl," as 
"my 'Twilight Zone' episode." But except for a jarring moment during Tuesday's 
performance when the building of the Waterfront Stage shook with perfect 
dramatic timing from a small earthquake, the play never realizes its ambitions 
for eeriness. 
</P>
<P>
This is the Los Angeles premiere, but "The Shawl" is so slight that it feels 
and sounds like a very early Mamet work, earlier even than his other spooky 
piece, "The Water Engine." 
</P>
<P>
Like Miss A., a desperate woman who comes to John, a low-life psychic, for help 
with her dead mother's will, we must accept this seer for the man he is. 
Director Duane Whitaker severely undercuts this, though, with some faulty 
casting. Shelly Desai as John voraciously swallows precious lines where he 
should be pulling us into his orbit, so that the plot curves carry a curiously 
empty feeling. 
</P>
<P>
We also can't accept Strawn Bovee's skeptical-looking Miss A. stomaching John's 
visions of her mother very long (she even out-tricks him, then doesn't leave). 
There's no emotional union between Desai and Bovee, and no link of any sort 
between Desai and Robert Patrick as Charles, John's lucre-sniffing lover. 
Without these, the implication of danger in the play's mood -- not abetted by 
the severely reined-in dialogue -- floats like a cloud above these people 
without entering their lives.

'To Forgive, Divine' a Farce at Colony 
</P>
<P>
The Colony Studio Theatre is a place that knows what its audience wants: 
familiar, accessible plays with beginnings, middles and ends, and productions 
in which all the actors remember their lines. That is why it has as healthy a 
subscriber base as any smaller theater around. It is also why the subscribers 
loved Jack Neary's "To Forgive, Divine" at the performance seen. 
</P>
<P>
They took to Jonathan Palmer's Father Jerry Dolan, and how he gets the hots for 
a married woman (Cara Roe's Katie) whom he's admired from afar since they were 
in high school together. They were charmed by Kathryn Fuller's Milly, the 
crusty unofficial chief around this New England Catholic church. Isn't it cute 
how Milly has to corral in her teen helper, Margaret (Debra J. Rogers), then 
chide Jerry for dancing with Katie in the middle of the sacristy? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe, especially if you like the idea of a Pat O'Brien movie retooled for the 
'90s, but should a faithful audience be subjected to the bad farce Neary's play 
becomes? The lengths taken to create a high-tension situation involving Jerry, 
Katie and Katie's burly husband (David Drummond) and a large closet is simply a 
case of a playwright imposing his need for comedy on characters against their 
wills. For farce, that is fatal. 
</P>
<P>
But everyone, as always, remembers their lines; some, like Fuller, etch out 
some memorable moments. Susan Gratch's set is an authentic sacristy and Michael 
David Wadler's direction is professional. There's more to a show, though, than 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1944 Riverside Drive, on Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 7

'Ruby Ruby Sam Sam' on the Cast's Menu 
</P>
<P>
Director Lee Garlington has become a specialist in plays about women who work 
in eateries. But where her 1987 production of "Waiting" was a sweet and 
scintillating comedy with refreshing views of how women deal with work in 
public, her current staging of Stan Edelman's "Ruby Ruby Sam Sam," at the Cast 
Theatre, is a contradictory muddle. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of it is Edelman's doing. Clearly, we're meant to wonder why Ruby (Catlin 
Adams), owner of a Southern diner, allows Sam (Van Quattro), a late-night 
customer, to hang around the estabishment after closing time. There's something 
about Sam, a struggling playwright, that attracts her, and something about the 
danger of the situation that contains an aphrodisiac quality. 
</P>
<P>
But Edelman never pins this something down, nor does he affix it to the 
character's needs. If "Ruby Ruby" was about the mystery of human contact -- 
which it isn't -- a certain vagueness would be apt. All we can do is wonder 
about Ruby's judgment, since Quattro plays Sam as a borderline nut case. Adams 
puts her heart into a role that's ultimately two irreconcilable women in one. 
She keeps a good diner though, judging by Andy Daley's detail-rich set.

RARE WORKS AT SEASON'S END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra's final program of the current season -- this 
reviewer attended Wednesday's performance, the first of two at Ambassador 
Auditorium with a third offering scheduled for Royce Hall Sunday -- found guest 
conductor Helmuth Rilling leading two rarely heard works: Bach's "Hunting" 
Cantata, BWV 208, and Mozart's incidental music to "Thamos, King of Egypt," K. 
345. 
</P>
<P>
Bach's youthful secular cantata is a celebration of the hunt, the principal 
pursuit of the Saxon duke for whom it was written. 
</P>
<P>
Bach's characterization in the recitatives is particularly sharp, but the 
ensuing arias tend to be commonplace -- with a single exception. Still, the 
listener could delight in the expert handling of their tortuous pitches and 
endless fioriture by a crack team of vocalists: sopranos Henriette Schellenberg 
and Ibolya Verebics, tenor Jonathan Mack and baritone Daniel Lichti. High marks 
too to the floridly imaginative harpsichord continuo of Patricia Mabee. 
</P>
<P>
The exception previously referred to is the justly popular aria known in 
English (the entire program was sung in the original German) as "Sheep may 
safely graze," delivered with exquisite poise and purity of tone by 
Schellenberg accompanied by the sweetly tootling recorder duo of Lisette 
Rabinow and Scott Wilkinson. 
</P>
<P>
If Bach had the evening's big tune, Mozart walked off with overall musical 
honors for his "Thamos" choruses and orchestral interludes, brimming with 
harmonic invention, thunderous drama and thematic prefigurings of "Die 
Zauberflote," whose plot also bears resemblances to that of "Thamos." 
</P>
<P>
Rilling led the score with blazing conviction while his pickup chorus (prepared 
for the occasion by Gordon Paine) sang with admirable strength and clarity of 
tone. HERBERT GLASS

'SANCTIFIED': LAST DAY OF ZORA HURSTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Zora Neale Hurston were enjoying a physical resurrection to match the recent 
revival of interest in her work, there's a good chance she'd approve strongly 
of it all -- from "Color Purple" poet-novelist Alice Walker's placement of a 
marker on Hurston's unmarked grave (the first step, taken in the '70s), to 
playwright George C. Wolfe's boisterous dramatization of her short stories 
("Spunk"), to the more straightforward biography shown months ago on PBS. 
</P>
<P>
But Ellen Sebastian's "Sanctified," a multi-media evocation of Hurston's last 
day in the world, might have given her the greatest pleasure and the greatest 
pause. 
</P>
<P>
How true the show at the Temporary Contemporary is to the real Zora is almost 
beside the point. It provides an impression -- a kind of ritualized flashback 
to selected moments in her life that invokes gospel and voodoo, touches lightly 
on biography, serves up fragments of her search for Afro-American cultural 
iconography and sauces up the whole with Hurston's rich capacity for humor and 
colloquialism. 
</P>
<P>
The 90-minute piece would have set her laughing -- much as it does Esther 
Scott, the impressive actress who plays Hurston here with contagious fullness 
and abandon, but who never underestimates the lingering pain below. "I'm a 
train," she tells us early on, "travelin' on the fast tracks of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Fact is not what one turns to Sebastian's piece for. Flavor is. Impressionism 
-- and quite abstract at that. In life, Hurston, a prominent figure in the 
Harlem Renaissance circles of the 20s, was both courageous and outrageous, 
serious and eccentric. An anthropologist by training, a folklorist by 
profession, she was inspired as a writer to liberally use lip-smacking black 
American in her stories. 
</P>
<P>
Sebastian's "Sanctified" opens with titles superimposed on a scrim, movie-like. 
It separates the present from the past, if not always the real from the 
imagined. We find Hurston herself on the sand at Eau Gallie, Florida, in front 
of the crumbling shack where she had lived at various times and where she has 
returned. A spider web blocks the entrance to the shack. Hurston talks to the 
spider. 
</P>
<P>
But we are quickly plunged into the world that was her life. On the scrim are 
Voodoo symbols and designs. Behind the scrim are other influences -- a gospel 
choir on the one hand, Voodoo musicians and Mambo dancer (Shakiri) on the 
other. We see the context of her life: a shifting panorama that repeatedly 
includes a patronizing patron (Janeen Wyatt), a white anthropologist (Malcolm 
Wood), her father (Artis Fountain) and her mother (Margarette Robinson). 
</P>
<P>
The mother, who encouraged her to be unafraid, died when Hurston was nine, 
telling her daughter to get "all the education you can because, baby, that's 
the onliest way you can keep from under people's feet." 
</P>
<P>
Ceremony and symbolism abound, starting with Hurston carefully removing books 
and a pillow, a looking-glass and a clock from an old suitcase on the sand -- 
an echo of her dying mother asking her to not allow anyone to take the pillow 
from under her head, or cover up the mirror or the clock after her death. It is 
picked up again when the time comes for Hurston's own death. ("Father, I'm 
coming home; Holy Ghost, don't leave me . . . ") 
</P>
<P>
Sebastian, a co-founder of San Francisco's Life On the Water, is the 
imaginative creator and director of "Sanctified" (written by Marilyn Waterman), 
though that invention slips in the last 30 minutes when repetition begins to 
set in. Jack Carpenter's lights and Grant Ditzler's set and props use levels 
and distance to fine effect, making a visceral contribution to the emotional 
tone of the piece. 
</P>
<P>
But it is Scott's bonhommie and performance as the irrepressible Hurston that 
ultimately holds us in thrall. (A word of warning: seating is on bleachers with 
no backs -- and there is no intermission.) 
</P>
<P>
 At 152 N. Central Ave., 8 p.m., through Sunday. $12; (213) 626-6222.

OLD MASONIC LODGE: PAST AND PRESENT WIN APPRECIATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETSY BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the old days, the distinguished gentlemen of the Highland Park Masonic Lodge 
sat along the ornate paneled walls of their grand meeting room and listened to 
programs such as "Snappy Kidding Songs by Mr. Warner" and "Two Organisms 
Universally Feared and Hated by Man," one of Alfred Cookman's science talks. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the handsome halls of the lodge -- renamed, refurbished and added 
to the National Register of Historic Places -- still echo with the sounds of 
popular entertainment in Highland Park, but the particulars have changed. 
</P>
<P>
No longer a Masonic hall, the building at Avenue 56 and North Figueroa Street 
now houses the Highland Cultural Center, a community meeting place and banquet 
hall. 
</P>
<P>
Up the sturdy stairway that in the 1920s welcomed 8-foot, 2-inch, 450-pound 
Masonic brother John Aasen, one of the lodge's most memorable members, now skip 
the feet of Catholic girls celebrating quinceaneras, their 15th birthdays. 
Brides, TV producers and Playboy models, the Highland Park Chamber of Commerce 
and politicians of almost every leaning now admire the rare Victorian paneling 
and run their fingers softly along time-smoothed cherrywood. 
</P>
<P>
Completed in 1923, the building ran the length of the block, featuring, as was 
typical for fraternal organizations, "spectacular" lodge and banquet rooms on 
the second floor and a row of retail outlets on the ground floor, said Christy 
Johnson McAvoy, a well-known preservation expert and consultant on the lodge's 
restoration. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement gave the Masons a lavish meeting place while generating income 
from the shops on the ground floor, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as then, the solid brick building, with its beautiful frieze near the roof 
line, anchored a pivotal corner in Highland Park, McAvoy said. Security Pacific 
National Bank and Charlie Chan's restaurant now share the intersection with the 
former Masonic building. A few doors down on Figueroa is the Highland Theater. 
</P>
<P>
Occupying the former Masonic building, where a barbershop and a cafe once were, 
are the headquarters of Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) and a 
computer school. Project Head Start has a regional office over the Highland 
Cultural Center in the building. 
</P>
<P>
The corner is a hub of activity, as it's always been. On Friday afternoons, 
when people are banking and parties are setting up at the Highland Cultural 
Center, finding a parking space is nearly impossible, tenants say. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mason building, along with the bank building and the theater, signaled the 
coming of age of the Highland Park community in the 1920s," McAvoy said. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Malone, a former member of the Masons' youth group, the Order of DeMolay, 
remembers the building in its declining years during the late 1970s. The 
once-white banquet room walls had turned gray, and the elegant original 
chandeliers in the lodge room had been replaced by dull green 1950s-era 
fixtures that Malone said reminded him of inverted bottle caps. 
</P>
<P>
Malone, now 27 and a press secretary to Polanco, said he was sorry to see the 
Masons leave in 1982, but has been impressed by the transformation of the 
building since then. 
</P>
<P>
"Where our office stands now" on the first floor, along Avenue 56, "was a dingy 
sort of place we used to call 'The Dungeon,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all really quite beautiful now," Malone said. "The building has served as 
a catalyst for redevelopment . . . in this stretch of Highland Park." 
</P>
<P>
McAvoy said the project was the first in the neighborhood to obtain historic 
designations that qualified its owners for tax breaks when they restored the 
building. Other historic structures are now being identified; the Security 
Pacific Bank nearby recently underwent remodeling and other projects are 
planned, signaling that renovation is catching on near the lodge. 
</P>
<P>
But as is often the case with historical renovations, transformation of the 
one-time Masonic building into a cultural hall was slow and sometimes painful, 
McAvoy said. 
</P>
<P>
The Masons were forced to abandon the building in 1982 because they could not 
afford to pay for earthquake renovations mandated by the city. Two Glendale 
stepbrothers, Jerry Manpearl and Jerry Sullivan, purchased the building and 
applied almost immediately for local, state and historic designations to help 
offset the estimated $400,000 cost of shoring up and restoring the hall's 
interior and exterior. 
</P>
<P>
Begun in 1985, the major work took three years. The old lodge room was left 
essentially intact but was rehung with antique light fixtures that the owners 
found at an auction. It was then renamed the Chandelier Room. Across the 
landing, the Masons' banquet room was dubbed the Terrace Room. Its French doors 
open to a balcony overlooking Figueroa. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, an engineer, oversaw the earthquake repairs, ensuring that period 
doorknobs and architectural detailing were not lost. Most important, he said, 
was preservation of intricate panels in the former lodge room. Called 
anaglyphs, they are made of embossed cotton on wallboard and represent a lost 
Victorian art form. 
</P>
<P>
Reinforcement beams were attached to the outside, not the interior, of 
18-inch-thick brick walls to preserve the interior; molding that had to be 
removed to reinforce walls with steel was painstakingly reassembled using saws 
and pocketknives. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the project was not without its critics. Local historians balked when signs 
they considered intrusive and out of historic character were mounted outside, 
so they quickly came down. McAvoy and others regret the loss of an interior 
balcony, which was partially removed to accommodate third-floor offices 
occupied by Project Head Start. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, though, McAvoy said the renovation work was of high-enough quality to 
earn the stamp of approval of the U.S. Department of the Interior, which judges 
projects on stringent restoration criteria. 
</P>
<P>
By 1988, newly refinished doors were thrown open and on Jan. 18 this year, the 
old Masonic Hall, now the Highland Cultural Center, was added to the National 
Register of Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
Old iron restaurant stoves that once cooked steak-and-potato lodge dinners are 
more likely to warm canapes and tortillas for wedding receptions and 
anniversary celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
Sun filtering through the lace curtains in the Terrace Room serves as natural 
photographic lighting for furniture ads and telephone commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Secret doorways that might have been lost to the wrecking ball were 
incorporated into movie sets. 
</P>
<P>
But the Masons who once conducted solemn ceremonies in the historic building 
rarely return. 
</P>
<P>
If they ever stopped by for nostalgia's sake, the Masons might be gratified to 
see the new shine on the doorknobs still embossed with Masonic symbols. 
</P>
<P>
They might like to know that the manager, Tom Buford, is a Mason. He treasures 
yellowed letters that he found in the hall that recall good deeds of the 
Highland Park Masons of decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm familiar with all this symbolism. I probably have a deeper appreciation 
for the place than somebody else might," Buford said.

BUDGET CRUNCH SEEN HURTING PROSPECTS OF ETHICS PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH CONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Council members -- who are cutting millions of dollars in 
services from Mayor Tom Bradley's $3.6-billion budget and adding new taxes as 
they confront a looming fiscal crisis -- acknowledged Thursday that their 
actions might make it more difficult to convince voters to give them a pay 
raise next month. 
</P>
<P>
"This budget situation doesn't help," said Councilman Michael Woo, a leading 
supporter of an ethics reform package that will go before the voters June 5. 
</P>
<P>
The $5-million ethics reform package includes salary increases and provides 
campaign matching funds for council members and other elected officials. Money 
for the ethics measure has not yet been budgeted, meaning that the council 
would have to dip into reserves or make additional spending cuts to fund the 
ethics package if it is approved. 
</P>
<P>
Tax hikes and threatened cutbacks in a host of services from tree trimming to 
police add "another complication" to getting voter approval for the ethics 
reform proposal, Woo said. 
</P>
<P>
He nonetheless argued that the ethics proposal has merit because, among other 
things, it places bans on officials' outside income. 
</P>
<P>
Other council members who voted to place the measure on the ballot appeared 
more pessimistic about its chances in light of the budget troubles. "It'll have 
(a negative) effect," said Councilman Hal Bernson. "But I don't know if 
anything could help" the ethics package, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The leading opponent of the ethics package, Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, claimed 
that with the money spent on the ethics package in the first year alone, nearly 
100 officers could be put on the street. 
</P>
<P>
The debate over the budget turned increasingly grim as various department heads 
went before the council arguing that they should be spared from a proposed 
$40-million package of salary, equipment and supply cuts that go deeper than 
the belt-tightening already proposed by Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, who would lose nearly $13 million for salaries 
under the proposals by the mayor and council, told the council he would not be 
able to hire the 400 new officers envisioned by the mayor and council. He said 
he also would have difficulty maintaining current levels of officers on the 
street. If the council fails to restore at least $7 million in police overtime, 
Gates said there would have to be a "net reduction" in service and officer 
response times could increase. 
</P>
<P>
Several council members responded skeptically, noting that Gates' budget is $1 
billion and suggesting that there are other places to reduce expenses. Gates 
repeatedly insisted that such trims were impossible. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. James Hahn said the proposed reductions in his spending request come 
as the number of criminal cases filed by his office has increased by 13%. He 
said the reduction would mean his office would have to cut back on a variety of 
legal services, including advice given City Council members. 
</P>
<P>
To lessen cuts in services, Hahn called on the council to adopt higher rubbish 
collection fees to cover the full $40-million to $60-million yearly cost of a 
major new curbside recycling program. The program is one of several key factors 
contributing to the budget squeeze. 
</P>
<P>
But there was no scrimping in the council chambers Thursday, as taxpayers 
funded a two-table lunch that Council President John Ferraro said was becoming 
too elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
While reviewing ways to slice the budget, council members munched on skewered 
meats, tacos, salads, soups, deep-dish cheesecake and an array of pastries. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a ton of food over there," observed Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Legislative Analyst William McCarley said the lunch cost several hundred 
dollars and was part of an effort to upgrade the fare at the annual budget 
session. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Ferraro allowed that the luncheon ritual might have to be scaled back to 
the previous fare of sandwiches and soda because it " has "gotten out of hand. 
It has become a buffet banquet" 
</P>
<P>
The budget deliberations continue today.

PROSECUTORS IN CAMARENA CASE WANT LIMITS ON QUESTIONING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal prosecutors are trying to prevent defense lawyers in the Enrique 
Camarena murder trial from cross-examining a prospective government witness who 
is reputed to have killed 35 to 50 people while working as an interrogator for 
Mexican law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The killings, carried out by Jesse Najar Zuno, were disclosed recently in 
documents that prosecutors turned over to lawyers for four men who are on trial 
in Los Angeles for the 1985 slaying of Camarena, a U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration agent who was based in Guadalajara, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The documents stated that in his capacity as an interrogator and trainer for 
the Federal Security Directorate -- Mexico's equivalent of the FBI -- and other 
government agencies from 1974 to 1987, Najar "killed 35-50 persons" but the 
documents offer no further details. 
</P>
<P>
Najar is expected to testify against Ruben Zuno Arce, a Mexican businessman who 
has been indicted as one of the plotters of the Camarena murder. 
</P>
<P>
Najar has worked as a DEA informant since October, 1986, and has been paid 
$32,440 by the agency for information and expenses since then, according to the 
government documents. He is one of 18 informants prosecutors say they plan to 
put on the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
In February, the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles notified Najar's lawyer, 
David Reed of Beverly Hills, that his client would be subpoenaed to testify at 
the Camarena trial. The letter stated that Najar was not considered a suspect 
in Camarena's death and would get immunity in return for his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
The Feb. 1 letter from Assistant U.S. Atty. Manuel A. Medrano, the lead 
prosecutor in the Camarena case, indicates only that Najar will be questioned 
about Zuno's alleged role in the case. Zuno has proclaimed his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
Reed has declined to discuss the killings attributed to his client. 
</P>
<P>
Jury selection in the case began Tuesday before U.S. District Judge Edward 
Rafeedie and testimony is expected to begin next week. 
</P>
<P>
A motion filed by prosecutors Medrano and John L. Carlton this week asked 
Rafeedie to issue an order prohibiting defense lawyers from making any 
reference to the killings attributed to Najar in opening statements to the 
jury, or even allowing them to cross-examine Najar about the killings. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors say that defense lawyers should be prohibited from raising the 
killings because it could unfairly undermine his credibility as a witness. The 
killings, they stress, had nothing to do with the Camarena case. 
</P>
<P>
Zuno's lawyers said they would ask Rafeedie to deny the request, but declined 
to elaborate on their position Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
However, two UCLA criminal law professors who have no connection with the 
Camarena case said they thought the prosecutors' request should be denied 
because they consider the killings an appropriate subject for 
cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm astounded that the government would seek to prevent cross-examination on 
the killings," said Prof. Robert Garcia, who was a federal prosecutor in New 
York from 1983 to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"The government is wrong when it says this does not go to truthfulness or 
veracity," Garcia said. He noted that the judge has discretion under the 
Federal Rules of Evidence to determine whether past acts of violence affect a 
witness' credibility. 
</P>
<P>
The professor also said that if Zuno's lawyers were not allowed to 
cross-examine Najar about the killings it could improperly infringe on his 
constitutional rights to confront a witness against him. 
</P>
<P>
"The government's claim is that it is unduly prejudicial" to ask about the 
killings, Garcia said. "Where is the prejudice in letting the jury know the 
truth?" 
</P>
<P>
Prof. Peter Arenella of UCLA said the issue facing Rafeedie is whether a jury 
would be so "distracted and inflamed" by testimony about the killings that it 
would not be able to fairly judge the credibility of Najar's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
"The relevance of questioning him concerning his (alleged) killings of 35 
individuals while in the employ of the Mexican government is clear," Arenella 
said. "One implication from such an admission is that this is an individual who 
would be willing to do anything for the right price." 
</P>
<P>
Charles Weisselberg, a USC law professor, took a slightly different view. 
</P>
<P>
He said the act of killing someone does not necessarily indicate that the 
individual would testify untruthfully. "I think the court will have to figure 
out the circumstances of the alleged killings, which would take a lot of time," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense would be within its rights to ask about each of the killings," to 
determine if there was anything about the nature of the killings that impugn 
Najar's credibility. 
</P>
<P>
Najar's lawyer said that he thought the government may have grounds for keeping 
the defense from asking about the slayings because killing someone doesn't make 
the person a liar. He said he could not reveal how the federal prosecutors 
obtained the information about the killings. 
</P>
<P>
Camarena was abducted on a Guadalajara street in February, 1985. He was 
tortured and killed by drug traffickers and his body was found a month later at 
a ranch 65 miles outside that city. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, 22 people have been indicted in the United States and three have been 
convicted in Los Angeles in connection with the murder.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SENATE OKS COMMERCIAL BAN ON WHITE CROAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Commercial fishermen would be banned from catching white croaker in certain 
areas of San Pedro and Santa Monica bays under legislation approved 38 to 0 
Thursday by the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, by Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), would not affect 
sportfishermen and party boats run by commercial enterprises, which generally 
do not go into the areas that would be closed off, a Rosenthal aide said. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Health Services in 1985 determined that consuming white 
croaker caught near the White Point sewage outfall off the Palos Verdes shelf, 
in Santa Monica Bay or near the Palos Verdes Peninsula could pose a health 
hazard. Particularly high levels of DDT and PCBs were found in white croaker.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RITCHIE VALENS TO GET STAR ON WALK OF FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Famed Latino rocker Ritchie Valens, whose death in a 1959 plane crash with 
Buddy Holly is still considered one of the greatest single tragedies in popular 
music history, will be honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame today. 
</P>
<P>
A ceremony unveiling the star is set for 12:30 p.m. at 6733 Hollywood Blvd., 
according to the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Valens' family, including two sisters and two brothers, are expected 
to attend the ceremony, along with actor Lou Diamond Phillips, who starred in 
the movie "La Bamba," about Valens' life. 
</P>
<P>
Valens, whose real name was Richard Valenzuela, rose from obscurity as a 
teen-age guitar player in Pacoima to become an internationally known performer 
on the strength of hits such as "Come On, Let's Go" and "Donna," a love song 
about his high school sweetheart.

The University of Southern California conferred degrees on 7,397 graduates 
Thursday, with 1,717 receiving B.A. degrees, 1,837 B.S. degrees, 1,206 M.A. 
degrees, 1,582 M.S. degrees, 474 doctor of philosophy degrees and 581 
professional doctorate degrees. Robert F. Erburu (USC, 1952), chairman of the 
board and chief executive officer of Times Mirror Co., delivered the keynote 
address. 
</P>
<P>
From his prepared text: 
</P>
<P>
 "The great myth of our age is that our problems are too enormous, and our 
institutions too cumbersome, and that nothing matters. The truth is that 
everything matters; there is no big solution to any of our national problems, 
only 240 million small ones. Those who seek solutions in the sacrificial and 
honorable living of their own lives are beginning aright." 
</P>
<P>
 Honorary degrees were awarded to Erburu; Kenneth O. Emery, marine geologist 
and professor emeritus at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute; Cecil H. Green, 
exploration geophysicist and founding member of Texas Instruments, and Jean 
Rouch, professor of anthropology, University of Paris. Carlyn Renee Taylor of 
Whittier, a dual-degree honors major in economics, was class valedictorian.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ACTOR KELSEY GRAMMER ARRESTED IN 2 CASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two judges took action Thursday against actor Kelsey Grammer, who plays 
psychiatrist Frasier Crane on the "Cheers" TV show, in two cases involving 
failure to enroll in substance-abuse programs. 
</P>
<P>
Grammer surrendered to Van Nuys Municipal Judge Aviva K. Bobb, who had issued 
an arrest warrant last week after Grammer failed to appear in court to prove he 
had completed a drug rehabilitation program after an arrest for cocaine 
possession. 
</P>
<P>
Grammer's attorney, Robert L. Diamond, requested that Grammer be given another 
chance to take part in the program. But Bobb ordered Grammer arrested, set bail 
at $7,500 and scheduled a May 21 hearing on the cocaine charge. 
</P>
<P>
Grammer was then taken before Judge Patricia Gorner Schwartz on a warrant 
issued Feb. 6 after he failed to complete an alcohol rehabilitation program 
imposed after he pleaded no contest to a 1987 drunk-driving charge. The judge 
scheduled a hearing for May 16 and set bail of $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Grammer posted bail on both charges.

CITY AIDE BACKS BILL TIED TO STUDY THAT EARNED HIM $30,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After getting paid $30,000 to conduct a study for a California landlord group, 
a mid-level employee with the city's Rent Stabilization Division submitted an 
official report last week urging the city to support proposed state legislation 
that is backed by his private research. 
</P>
<P>
Senior management analyst James C. Fleck in his personal time produced a study 
last year that concluded California landlords lose up to $270 million annually 
because of the lag time between filing a lawsuit for nonpayment of rent and 
seizing the property. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, he prepared a city evaluation of a state bill that would require 
tenants to post rent deposits if they go to court to contest eviction notices 
for nonpayment. The legislation is supported by the California Apartment Law 
Information Foundation, the group that paid Fleck to conduct the study last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Fleck's dual role as city analyst and landlord consultant is "outrageous," said 
Larry Gross, executive director of the Coalition for Economic Survival. 
</P>
<P>
"For a tenant to see someone in that department actively working on behalf of 
landlords, one has to question what kind of fair shake they are going to get," 
Gross said. "I think it is totally inappropriate for someone there to be 
involved in legislation that basically takes away rights from tenants." 
</P>
<P>
Fleck and his city supervisor said that he has done nothing improper. 
</P>
<P>
However, the mayor's office last week moved quickly to "insulate" Fleck from 
any further discussions or decisions on the proposed legislation, said Deputy 
Mayor Mark Fabiani. Moreover, the city will take no position on the proposed 
legislation because of Fleck's role in the bill, Fabiani said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Fleck's activities raise conflict-of-interest concerns, Fabiani said, 
the mayor's office has no plans to to file a complaint with the city attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
"Since he's been insulated, for our purposes that solves the problem," Fabiani 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Concerned parties," he said, could request an opinion from the city attorney 
on the matter. Conflict-of-interest provisions of the City Charter have been 
used to bar people from matters when their involvement might give the 
appearance of a conflict, Fabiani said. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Atty. Tony Alperin declined to comment on the matter or to 
discuss city conflict-of-interest regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Fleck and his city supervisor, Barbara Zeidman, insisted in separate interviews 
that he has no such conflict and handled the matter properly. Fleck said he 
received approval from Zeidman and the city's Community Development Department 
to work for the California Apartment Law Information Foundation. He also 
publicly disclosed the $30,000 fee on his statement of economic interest. 
</P>
<P>
"There can't be anybody in the city who has been more open about this than me," 
Fleck said. "If you want a model of someone who has followed every rule the 
city has, that is what I have done." 
</P>
<P>
Fleck suggested in an interview that the mayor's office is waging "a 
last-minute political effort" to attack a bill that it doesn't support, even 
though the city passed a similar ordinance several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"They have succeeded in intimidating this department into not taking a position 
that the mayor's office doesn't like," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As a $49,000-a-year city analyst who is responsible for reviewing all pending 
legislation on rent control, Fleck said he was following his routine duties 
when he issued an assessment of the state bill last week. In his city report, 
Fleck said, he noted that he had conducted the field research that was used to 
help prepare the bill, introduced by state Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
Fleck said he recommended that the city support the bill because Los Angeles 
already has a similar ordinance, not because he was paid to do the survey. The 
city ordinance has not been enforced by the courts because of the cost of 
establishing escrow accounts to hold rental deposits. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a technician," Fleck said. "I do research for the city, no question about 
that. What I did for the landlords, frankly, was get information that the city 
was interested in as well. The city was able to get $30,000 worth of 
information for free." 
</P>
<P>
The study examined a sampling of 2,400 unlawful-detainer cases in 21 counties 
and concluded that landlords lose up to $270 million a year because of delays 
between filing a lawsuit for nonpayment of rent and the seizure of property, 
Fleck said. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's office has no problem with Fleck's conducting the study, Fabiani 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is one thing to work on a report on your own time," Fabiani said. "It's 
another to come back to your job and work to influence the position that your 
department or the city takes on that report." 
</P>
<P>
Fabiani said that Fleck's supervisor should have known of Fleck's previous 
involvement in the study and assigned someone else to review the bill. 
</P>
<P>
But Zeidman, head of the city's Rent Stabilization Unit, said she did not 
hesitate to have Fleck evaluate Kopp's bill. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not see a conflict of interest," Zeidman said. "Jim is a mid-level staff 
person. He does not make policy. . . . He is the head of the research unit. The 
other (researcher), frankly, has been with me three months and doesn't know 
enough to do a fast piece of legislative analysis."

As a child born and raised in Hollywood, one of the rites of fall, along with

Our street was lined with large palm trees, and colonies of kangaroo rats lived 
in them. 
</P>
<P>
When fall came and the weather cooled, they all came into our house and those 
of our neighbors. Hence, the necessity for a visit from the cheerful "Rat Man" 
to rid the neighborhood of these filthy, disease-carrying pests. We all got to 
know him well. 
</P>
<P>
So you can understand my disbelief -- my disgust -- at seeing in the paper that 
these pests had become an "endangered species" and so had to be protected and 
preserved. Can fleas, cockroaches or termites be far behind? 
</P>
<P>
It is such idiocy that will make the whole environmental movement look foolish 
and thwart perfectly logical and necessary actions with which no right-thinking 
person can disagree.

GRAD WEAR: DANCING ON A THIN LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
You've seen them on Saturdays, shopping at the mall, girls too young for a prom 
but too old to stay home and play with Barbie dolls. 
</P>
<P>
This June, thousands of these young teen-agers will graduate from the eighth 
grade of private and public schools around Southern California. With Madonna as 
their idol, they are planning for the most important social event on their 
calendar: the graduation dance. But these 13- and 14-year-olds must deal with a 
major sartorial dilemma: the graduation night dress code. 
</P>
<P>
The dances they look forward to attending range from semiformal to downright 
casual events. Either way, school administrators have instituted scores of 
fashion guidelines to keep dare-to-bare looks at bay. 
</P>
<P>
Myrna Fujimoto, principal of Thomas Jefferson Middle School in Long Beach, said 
her school's rules came about as a natural extension of the school's 
philosophy: nurture the children. 
</P>
<P>
"We separate them from high school activities such as proms and its formality," 
Fujimoto said. "Let them be children here, and adults when they go to high 
school." 
</P>
<P>
This spring for the first time, Fujimoto sent an activities bulletin home with 
students which parents were to sign and return. Among the statements included 
about graduation activities: ". . . formal dress is neither desirable, suitable 
or acceptable for graduating students." 
</P>
<P>
To further discourage inappropriate evening wear for girls, the school dance 
has been recast from formal to informal, and Fujimoto set the time at the early 
hour of 5 p.m. These changes came about, she said, after she spent one too many 
graduation nights in the ladies room, helping 13- and 14-year-old girls pull up 
their falling, strapless dresses, which slipped downward every time they took a 
spin on the dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
"The rules are not to stifle fashion individuality but to ensure that what is 
worn is appropriate," Fujimoto said of the changes she has put into effect. 
</P>
<P>
At St. Mel's Catholic School in Woodland Hills the dress code is even more 
specific. The graduation dance fashion code requires that dresses must not be 
too tight or too short. Above-the-knee styles are acceptable but none can be in 
the mid-thigh range. Dresses must not be too sheer or feature cutouts or 
strapless necklines. One concession: Some strapless dresses will be permitted 
if an accompanying jacket is sewn onto the dress. 
</P>
<P>
Similar rules apply at neighboring Our Lady of the Valley school in Canoga 
Park, where strapless dresses have been vetoed as inappropriate attire for the 
school's semiformal dance. Teachers have already briefed students about the 
fashion guidelines. Parents were informed of the rules as well, during a 
general meeting held at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Given the guidelines, young shoppers are combing the L.A. area's junior shops 
and department stores in search of something they like and can wear without 
fear of rejection. 
</P>
<P>
At this late date, with most of the high school proms already past, many 
junior-sized special occasion outfits are marked down. Still, what most girls 
find in stores are as far outside the guidelines as Madonna's lingerie-like 
stage clothes would be. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't wear anything radical, but we don't want anything too conservative, 
either," explains Jennifer McNicoll, a 13-year-old West Hills resident who will 
be attending the dance at St. Mel's. McNicoll, who recently combed San Fernando 
Valley malls with pals Lori Hanis, Judy Munoz and Melanie Walker, had little 
luck finding anything in her first few mall expeditions. 
</P>
<P>
As the foursome combed the racks in department and specialty stores in search 
of dresses in Topanga Plaza, they complained of the lack of selection in stores 
and the rules at school. 
</P>
<P>
"I would wear this but I'd get busted," McNicoll muttered as she held up a 
white strapless gown at the Judy's boutique in Topanga Plaza. Her friends 
admired the dress but moved on in search of something that would pass 
inspection. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so frustrating," moaned Walker as she made a beeline into neighboring 
Contempo Casuals to comb the racks there. No luck. After two hours (and only a 
couple of try-ons at Saks Fifth Avenue at Promenade Mall in Woodland Hills) the 
girls gave up for the day. 
</P>
<P>
McNicoll said she shopped nine stores before finally finding a dress. She was 
shopping with her mother that day, in the Ames store at the Northridge Mall. 
The long-sleeve ivory dress with lavender Swiss dots is mid-knee length. But 
the low-cut back had to be altered to pass school inspection. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the dress," said McNicoll, "so many of the others I tried on were ify 
-- like, I could wear one if I had to but I really didn't like any of them." 
</P>
<P>
Hanis, a 13-year-old Woodland Hills resident and classmate of McNicoll, finally 
found a suitable dress that she liked at Windsor Fashions in the Sherman Oaks 
Galleria. 
</P>
<P>
"I even like it better than the ones that break the rules. It's not trashy -- 
it's beautiful," said Hanis of the white long-sleeve dress enhanced with a 
lattice front of white ribbon and a flirty flounce. Hanis said she shopped 
dozens of stores before finding something that was "legal." 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Hanis, Lori's mother, said she sympathized with her daughter after going 
shopping with her. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't find that many dresses that look right for young teens," she said. 
"What they have in the stores looks more like dresses for a senior in high 
school." Hanis was with her daughter when she finally found the right dress. 
</P>
<P>
Some store personnel have taken it on themselves to help the girls select 
clothes that conform to school guidelines. And some sales people at local mall 
boutiques know the codes as well as the students do, since hordes of girls have 
been in the stores during the past several months, rattling off the dos and 
don'ts. 
</P>
<P>
Sheri Odefey, assistant manager of Windsor Fashions in Northridge Mall, said 
she tries to talk pre-high school girls into cotton dresses in pastel shades. 
</P>
<P>
"What they need for this is a little different from a prom dress," Odefey said. 
"When they try to go toward a prom look, I try to show them what will be more 
appropriate." To date, Odefey said, she can't recall any returns made because 
of rule-breaking selections. 
</P>
<P>
"These girls know what they need when they come in," said Odefey. 
</P>
<P>
Do designers of special-occasion dresses know what these girls need? Carlotta 
Khero, vice president of design at New Leaf, an L.A.-based special-occasion 
wear manufacturer, personally sympathizes with the problem. Her 14-year-old 
daughter, Marvi, who attends A.E. Wright Middle School in Calabasas, shopped 
her mother's designer line and checked out local stores. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, she asked her mother to whip up a black strapless dress and a matching 
bolero jacket since her school required that girls cover their shoulders for 
the graduation dance. The 14-year-old said many of her friends ordered fitted, 
long-sleeve dresses at above-the-knee length, from the Victoria's Secret 
catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
"I was dreading going to the stores to find something," she admits. 
</P>
<P>
Her mother, speaking as a designer, said the market is a tough one to service. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a quandary. Girls want sophisticated, sexy dresses and they'll head to 
the missy department to find them. These 14- and 15-year-olds don't want to be 
categorized as younger," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Several students at Thomas Jefferson are disappointed that the traditionally 
more "grown-up," night-time graduation dance was changed to an informal 
late-afternoon event this year. 
</P>
<P>
"So they don't want it to seem like a prom? It's our last dance," said Shannon 
Brown. Instead of a fancy dress, she said she will probably wear jeans and a 
new shirt. 
</P>
<P>
Classmate Joanne Batshon of Seal Beach, informally referred to as the school's 
fashion plate, said she had purchased a strapless dress before she found out 
about the rules. 
</P>
<P>
"It's supposed to be special. Now it's just a dance," she sighed. 
</P>
<P>
Britt Nilsen, a 14-year-old Long Beach resident, bought a new outfit at The 
Gap, one she plans to wear later to school. The peach color, long-sleeve top 
has a matching skirt. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Nilsen said, her mother gave her a choice of getting a new 
Easter dress or a new dress for the dance, which, at the time, she thought 
would be semi-formal. 
</P>
<P>
"I missed out a new dress for Easter for nothing," said Nilsen. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen year-old Evelyn May, student council president at Jefferson Middle 
School, is one of the few students who favors the new guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"We should hold some things back until we get to high school," she said. "If 
we've already done it all, we won't have anything to look forward to."

TECHNOLOGY: A BOSTON MEDICAL WRITER SOUNDS THE ALARM ABOUT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL 
COST OF HIGH-TECH LIVING. A FIRST-AID KIT FOR THE FUTURE IS A MUST, HE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The symptoms include tension, paranoia, overstimulation, anticipatory 
disaffiliation, psychosomatic headaches, fatigue, sagging libido, psychic 
numbing, low self-esteem and high anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
What is the ailment? 
</P>
<P>
"Technostress," says Philip T. Nicholson, a Boston medical writer and seasoned 
watcher of Life in the Information Cyclone. He defines technostress as a 
contemporary disease caused by the pressures of living in a high-tech world. 
</P>
<P>
"This can lead to panic, alienation and a sense of hopelessness," says 
Nicholson, who is organizing a Technostress Information Network to coordinate 
research on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
As our lives at home and at work become relentlessly computerized (President 
Bush's recent quip about a nation where every citizen would be able to set the 
clock on his VCR indicates that technostress has struck the White House), and 
as we flounder in tides of information and electronic images and call-waiting 
buttons and laser printers and fax machines, we may experience not only 
headaches and back pains, but a range of contradictory psychological changes, 
such as sharp impatience with any process that takes more than a few seconds, 
or the inability to make decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Considering that rapid technological change is expected to whiz us right into 
the 21st Century, Nicholson is convinced that studying the prospects for 
humankind in a nanosecond-paced world is a necessity. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'm doing is looking at the eroding aspects of the communications 
revolution," he says. "Somebody needs to be designing a technostress first-aid 
kit for the future -- thinking about the glue that will hold people together." 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson sees his role as sounding the alarm, but he is not alone. Although 
technostress has not been officially recognized in the medical Establishment (a 
spokesman for the American Psychiatric Assn. did acknowledge a concern over 
growing symptoms of mechanization and dehumanization), it is attracting 
researchers from all disciplines. Studies on the effects of computerization on 
humans can be weighed by the ton. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Brod, a Silicon Valley psychotherapist who coined the phrase in his 1984 
book "Technostress," agrees with Nicholson that we are producing a 
technological society that is leaving us tuned into machines but starved for 
personal contact. 
</P>
<P>
In clinical interviews, Brod noticed similar patterns in patients who worked 
with high technology, whether they were data processors or CEOs. Not only were 
they suffering such stress symptoms as headaches, but they also were 
internalizing the computer process itself, developing such behavioral symptoms 
as a sense of accelerated time, a desire for perfection, and difficulty in 
relating lovingly to others. 
</P>
<P>
"With a typewriter there were time and motion interruptions when you tore up a 
piece of paper or hit the carriage return -- there were all kinds of 
separations between you and the machine," says Brod. "Then comes this wonderful 
technology that alters time. You can work for hours being almost motionless, 
and basically you are hooked into this machine." 
</P>
<P>
The key, he thinks, is that high-tech environments create their own kind of 
stress -- the stress for perfection -- and when life falls short of that, 
technostress victims react with "a lot of anger and hostility." 
</P>
<P>
What alarms Brod is the disappearance of a "human sense of time" on a 
widespread public scale as society becomes increasingly computerized. He sees 
symptoms everywhere. For example: 
</P>
<P>
* We used to get money by standing in line at the bank and exchanging greetings 
with the teller. Now we withdraw money from a self-service automated teller, 
and if it takes more than 60 seconds we get impatient. 
</P>
<P>
* At the market, we shuffle past a checkout clerk who is frantically running 
groceries over a computer scanner. Clerks now handle two and three times as 
many people in their lines as they used to, so they can't afford to stop and 
say "hello." 
</P>
<P>
* On the telephone we used to give the number to an operator, and sometimes ask 
for help finding a number. Now the telephone is so automated that machines 
answer when the phones ring. 
</P>
<P>
* Many offices are so computerized that even people sitting next to each other 
converse by electronic messages. The office water cooler conversation is 
history. 
</P>
<P>
In every direction, "we are producing this automated society not meeting our 
needs for personal contact, for a human sense of time," says Brod. "I even have 
patients who ask me how much time they should spend with their children." 
</P>
<P>
Brod foresees an eventual revolt if technostress is not addressed because "we 
are automating the human element out of our lives." 
</P>
<P>
Other experts see the technostress problem through a different lens. 
</P>
<P>
At USC, Ann Majchrzak, an organizational psychologist, says workplace stress 
isn't caused by technology itself but by the way management handles it. 
</P>
<P>
"My research shows a critical correlation between the amount of time you give 
employees to prepare for the new technology and their acceptance of it," says 
Majchrzak who helps managers lay the groundwork for introducing new technology 
to workers. 
</P>
<P>
"That new software package comes in the door with only the manual, and 
technostress happens when you get companies who do training once, then keep 
handing the updated packages to the workers. (Many clerical computer workers 
report learning as many as 20 new software programs in the last two or three 
years). 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the midst of a hardware revolution and a software revolution," she 
says, "and the combination of the two is very challenging. Workers are going to 
participate in the change or fall by the wayside, and they need management 
support." 
</P>
<P>
The most successful firms today devote up to 10% of their time to ongoing 
high-tech training, which means that workers are spending four hours a week 
learning something new. 
</P>
<P>
"That means you are not in a stable work environment, and I think that is the 
case for almost everybody today," she said. 
</P>
<P>
If the workplace computer keeps its user in a state of change, the home 
computer tends to reinforce a household's existing family pattern, whether 
healthy or dysfunctional. 
</P>
<P>
"When a computer comes into a home, it does have impact and the impact is a 
shift in how people use their time," said Nicholas Vitalari of UC Irvine, who 
studies information systems and the social impact of computer technology. 
</P>
<P>
With fellow UCI management professor Alladi Venketesh, he conducted the NOAH 
(National Outlook for Automation in the Home) project for the National Science 
Foundation. The two-year study, the first of its kind, tracked personal 
computer use in 900 U.S. households. 
</P>
<P>
Like many researchers, the two were intrigued by the technological explosion of 
the 1980s which saw computer households grow from 1 million in 1980 to nearly 
35 million in 1990 (out of 90 million U.S. households). 
</P>
<P>
"When we did pilot studies, it became very clear that buying a computer is very 
different from buying a toaster. You know what a toaster does," says Vitalari. 
</P>
<P>
At home, the computer's role waits to be defined. What researchers found is 
that "people didn't really know what they wanted. Early on they thought they 
could do their home finances, balance their checkbook, keep records, that sort 
of thing. 
</P>
<P>
"That turned out to be unrealistic, in most cases. Primarily, the computer is 
used by children to do homework and by adults to extend their workweek by doing 
work at home," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Research revealed that as the computer ate into an adult's leisure hours, 
trade-offs had to occur. "Usually it meant less time sleeping and less time 
spent watching television. These were statistically significant," says 
Vitalari. 
</P>
<P>
And although their study showed that most people were happy, not stressed, with 
their home computers, he said, "you do run across interesting situations that 
are cause for concern." 
</P>
<P>
These are the homes where using the computer becomes a way to act out 
dysfunctional relationships, he said, such as a husband making his wife a 
computer widow. 
</P>
<P>
"There were situations where the female spouse sees the computer as an invasion 
of the household unit, so you know there is something else going on," he said. 
"We also found situations where the female brings the computer into the home, 
and she and the kids bond around it." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Vitalari said, their research showed that the computer can 
reinforce a healthy family -- "one Northern California family linked together 
by computer when their children went off to college." 
</P>
<P>
And in one single-parent household where the mother and children had a good 
relationship, the mother used the electronic mail system at her office to leave 
messages that the children called up on the home computer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like an electronic refrigerator door," said Vitalari. 
</P>
<P>
The high-tech relationship achievable between an individual and a machine 
spurred Philip Nicholson to organize his Technostress Information Network. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that people want to bail out; it's the intoxication with technology 
that is unsettling," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson, 45, has an interdisciplinary degree from Stanford University in law 
and psychiatry and a master's degree from Harvard in public health. He has been 
"intoxicated" with technology since he bought his first word processor in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great big clunky beige-and-black Lanier and it cost $14,000," he 
recalls. "I tripled my output of medical writing and paid back the investment 
in six months." 
</P>
<P>
Five years later, the microcomputer boom washed over everything and Nicholson 
got interested in the future of humans faced with an accelerating rate of 
high-tech speed and information. 
</P>
<P>
"I was fascinated by the technology, but also feeling the psychological 
consequences," he said. "I had the best education money can buy, and a nice 
family, but I still felt like I was just hanging on the edge, and all my 
friends were feeling the same way." 
</P>
<P>
When Nicholson began to compile technostress research, he realized he was not 
alone in his feelings. Technostress was an unidentified epidemic. He devised a 
chart of symptoms, including an "Information Worker's Spiral of Ascending 
Anxiety," that he uses for the lectures he hopes will spread the word. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Nicholson hasn't made much impact. 
</P>
<P>
"People are not swarming to this subject," he says. When he addressed the World 
Future Society last summer on "Conservation of the Self in a High-Tech 
Environment," he found the lack of interest disappointing. "This should be a 
major concern for futurists." 
</P>
<P>
He also thinks technostress research could be of interest to the computer 
industry, human factors specialists, psychologists, psychiatrists, sociologists 
and "anybody else interested in behavioral sciences." 
</P>
<P>
In Silicon Valley, Brod agrees. "I think people need a place to think about 
this whole question of speeded-up life. I want a broader discussion of this. 
It's a contemporary disease and it needs to be acknowledged." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Brod offers this self-help prescription: 
</P>
<P>
* Don't blame the victim. And if you are a sufferer of technostress don't blame 
yourself. 
</P>
<P>
* Analyze the symptoms. Look at the work environment, the way things are 
arranged. Ask questions about how much work people really can take, about the 
best human flow of communication. 
</P>
<P>
* Ask yourself questions about how you are spending your time.

A JEWELRY MOGUL BY HER OWN DESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Michael Caine goes off and makes movies, his wife of 17 years, Shakira, 
doesn't stay home playing the role of the stereotypical Hollywood wife. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, after seeing an exhibit of royal costumes of India organized 
by the late Diana Vreeland at the Metropolitan Museum in New York, Caine, a 
former Miss Guyana and second runner up to Miss World, went to India to check 
out the jewels for herself. 
</P>
<P>
"Being Indian, I was inspired by all the Mogul jewelry," she says. She decided 
to have copies made for herself, including a dramatic necklace woven with gold 
thread that originally held gold stones and diamonds. She took her dozen 
samples to Harrod's in London, where the Caines had just moved after living in 
Los Angeles for 10 years. "They said to come back with more scarfs, bags, 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Caine added more jewelry, as well as shawls embedded with "beaten" silver. Now 
the collection is carried at several American specialty stores, including 
Neiman-Marcus in Beverly Hills. Prices for the jewelry range from $60 to $300; 
shawls are $600. 
</P>
<P>
Recently ensconced in Beverly Hills for a month while her husband filmed "Mr. 
Destiny" in North Carolina ("He's playing God -- he's finally typecast," she 
cracks), Caine made the social rounds with a little camera at the ready. "I get 
lots of ideas from real jewelry, so I steal all my girlfriends' jewelry ideas." 
In return, she gives her girlfriends, including Wendy Goldberg, Barbara Davis, 
Jackie Collins and Joanna Poitier, pieces of her costume jewelry, which is all 
signed, "Shakira." 
</P>
<P>
Caine says she has started moving away from the ethnic look. The inspiration 
for her newest line, full of seashell motifs, came from the couple's seaside 
Christmas holiday in Barbados. But Caine says her threaded Mogul necklace, 
earrings and bracelets are classics and will always be available. Later this 
year, she says, Neiman-Marcus will carry her new handbags and belts, which, 
along with the jewelry, are being manufactured in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been interested in fashion and accessories," says Caine. "I never 
particularly wanted to spend a massive amount of money to buy real jewelry, and 
you can be so outrageous with costume jewelry. I have a huge collection. I've 
been buying it since the '60s." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, she adds, since she and her husband travel so much, if she had the 
real thing, "I'd always be worried."

STUDENTS EXHIBIT THEIR OWN STYLES

With spring temperatures hitting 90-something degrees earlier that day, 
sunburns were as plentiful as the de rigueur short black cocktail dresses many 
women wore to the 10th annual Otis/Parsons Critics Award Fashion Show on 
Saturday night. More than $525,000 was raised for the design school's 
scholarship program, while guests were treated to dinner, dancing, a solid show 
of student designs and a silent auction. 
</P>
<P>
"When I hired my first assistant from Otis/Parsons, I thought it was just a 
coincidence," said the evening's honoree, Guess? designer Georges Marciano. 
"But now all 10 of my assistants are Otis/Parsons graduates. That's no 
coincidence. I think Otis/Parsons is the best design school in the United 
States." 
</P>
<P>
After a worshipful tribute to Marciano's world of denim, sportswear, eye wear, 
footwear, swimwear, children's wear, watches and the introduction of the new 
Guess? fragrance, the student show began. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the academic year, established designers work with the school's 
fashion department director, Rosemary Brantley, and the students on specific 
design directions. Each designer then awards a Silver Thimble Award for 
outstanding achievement. Georges Marciano chose Erich Archuleta and Aaron Paule 
for their black denim men's wear; Judy Knapp, of Nordstrom's Brass Plum 
department, selected Tiffen Dove for her black velvet pants and skirts mixed 
with white lace-trimmed blouses; Christina Johnson, of Olga's Christina, 
awarded her Thimble to Adrienne Grande and Connie Kolupa for their lingerie; 
Gary Nickerson, of La Blanca Swimwear, chose Dorene Williams for her chartreuse 
sequined bikini. And that was just the junior class. 
</P>
<P>
Designer critics for the senior class included Isaac Mizrahi, whose Thimble 
went to Adrienne Wait for her blue and green sportswear separates in taffeta 
and satin; Henry Duarte, of Sqwear, who chose Alice Boner for her colorful 
interpretation of men's wear; Carole Little, who honored Shelly Boies for her 
flared, fake-fur jacket lined in red; Richard Tyler and Lisa Trafficante, of 
Richard Tyler, who singled out Leticia Banuelos for her tailored blue coat with 
a trompe l'oeil jacket; David Hayes, who selected Scott Williams for his long 
black velvet gown with white satin collar and cuffs; and Bob Mackie, who closed 
the show with a Beaton-esque finale of Truman Capote's 1966 formal Black and 
White Ball, and who awarded Paula T. Corley, also the school's designer of the 
year, his Silver Thimble. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the silent auction bidding was fast and furious. Barbara 
Lazaroff, restaurateur and wife of chef Wolfgang Puck, was holding back. 
</P>
<P>
"People see my name and they immediately start bidding against me. I've spent 
thousands here," Lazaroff said. "A lot of my honeymoon clothes were designed by 
Otis/Parsons students." 
</P>
<P>
This year, students proved their prowess at following the direction of 
established designers as well as their ability to select fabrics and execute 
designs with astute workmanship. If this is the future, let it begin.

WALTER MATTHAU AND MOZART . . . ANOTHER ODD COUPLE; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: ACTOR WILL GUEST-CONDUCT THE LOS ANGELES MOZART ORCHESTRA ON SATURDAY AT 
THE WILSHIRE EBELL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the Red Room of a sprawling Pacific Palisades mansion, pianist Antoinette 
Perry sits at a shiny red baby grand, conferring on the intricacies of Mozart's 
Concerto in A with host Walter Matthau, who for inspiration sports a yellow cap 
embroidered with the insignia "Mozart." 
</P>
<P>
Matthau, who has had no formal musical training -- he cannot read music -- is 
preparing for a performance Saturday night at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre. He 
will conduct the Los Angeles Mozart Orchestra with Perry as soloist in the 
allegretto from the K. 414 concerto, marking his second appearance at the helm 
of the 28-member ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
"Am I supposed to conduct while you are playing?" Maestro Matthau deadpans to 
the pianist. "Listen, Zubin (Mehta) told me nobody listens to him anyway. So 
why doesn't the orchestra just come in when it's supposed to?" 
</P>
<P>
Matthau soon tires of discussing things Mozartean, preferring instead to take 
his visitors on a tour of his home of 20 years that is bright and flowery and 
perfumed with potpourri. Piped-in music plays in the pink-and white-boudoirs 
and bedrooms, even reaching across the pool and gazebo into Matthau's office, 
where memorabilia from his films "Hopscotch," "The Fortune Cookie" and "Charley 
Varrick" line the walls, along with a couple of Tonys for his work in "The Odd 
Couple" and "A Shot in the Dark." 
</P>
<P>
Matthau, 69, believes his passion for music was born in the womb. 
</P>
<P>
"My father played music on the phonograph and I think it got through to me," he 
says. "He moved out just after I was born. Then there was no music in the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
"As a child we were too poor for me to study. We grew up on the Lower East Side 
of Manhattan; you know, dead-end kids in the ghetto. But when I was 6, I went 
to public school where each Friday they had music appreciation on the radio. My 
love of music must be some kind of genetic transference." 
</P>
<P>
As an honorary trustee, Matthau provides incalculable publicity to the Los 
Angeles Mozart Orchestra. He also has made a small donation used to purchase a 
computer. "They want money from me for the privilege of getting up there," says 
Matthau who accepts no fees for his podium excursions. 
</P>
<P>
Although Matthau will donate his services to the Beverly Hills Symphony in 
August and in December conduct an orchestra from USC at a dinner at the 
Biltmore, he entertains no musical aspirations. Rather, he laments the dearth 
of acting jobs. (Matthau last appeared in "The Incident," a TV movie drama that 
aired in March.) 
</P>
<P>
"I am an actor who should be working a lot more than I am," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Music director David Keith, who founded the Los Angeles Mozart Orchestra in 
1975, will conduct Haydn's Symphony No. 82 and Mozart's Piano Concerto in G at 
Saturday's concert. He says that Matthau exhibits a "good sense of Mozart." As 
the music unfolds, he "choreographs what he feels the sound can be." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a "safety net" will be in place. Concertmaster Frances Moore is 
expected to provide cues, determine dynamics and above all, give the downbeat 
that portends tempo and tone to come. 
</P>
<P>
Pianist Perry, a member of the UCLA music faculty, welcomes the opportunity to 
work with the actor, believing his impeccable sense of timing will lead to a 
successful collaboration. 
</P>
<P>
"Timing in music is so important, as it is in acting," she said. "There is a 
lot of overlap between comedy and music." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Danny Kaye, who regularly conducted pension-benefit concerts for some 
of the leading orchestras, was not above throwing a baton or two in the air, 
kneeling in prayer, kissing a player or yelling bravo midway through a 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
Dudley Moore, an Oxford-trained pianist and composer, has appeared several 
times with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, performing Gershwin's "Rhapsody in 
Blue" and other selections at the Hollywood Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis Diller, who studied keyboard for more than 26 years and at one point 
had 12 pianos in her home, landed several orchestral engagements for her alter 
ego Illya Dillya, a grande dame of music partial to performing Beethoven's 
First Piano Concerto. 
</P>
<P>
"Comedy, like music is about not only timing, but hearing and listening," says 
Diller, who in April joined the Oakland East Bay Symphony in an arrangement of 
Bach's Prelude No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Actor David Ogden Stiers, (Winchester on "MASH") is building a secondary career 
conducting pension-benefit concerts across the country. He charges no fee, 
serves on no boards. "I don't buy my way into conducting," said Stiers, who 
studies "offbeat" recordings and works with a conducting coach. His most recent 
appearance was leading the Utah Symphony in the last two movements of 
Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto, played by Joseph Silverstein. 
</P>
<P>
Stiers also is a regular at "Battle of the Bands," an annual benefit bash for 
the Eugene, Ore., Symphony. (The Colorado Springs Symphony stages a similar 
do.) 
</P>
<P>
Here, prominent local personalities conduct selections before a panel of 
celebrity judges. Participants have included marathon runner Alberto Salazar 
clad in running shorts and conducting Vangelis' score to the film "Chariots of 
Fire," and Atty. Gen. David Frohnmayer. 
</P>
<P>
The would-be conductors are trained at the University of Oregon School of 
Music, where, according to Dean Bernard Dobroski, they are taught how to hold a 
baton, how to stand, how not to fall off the podium and how to give the 
downbeat. They also study videos of Karajan, Toscanini, Ormandy, Bernstein -- 
and Danny Kaye. 
</P>
<P>
"Celebrities take these sessions very seriously," says Dobroski. "We teach them 
how a conductor re-creates the essence of what a composer wants and talk about 
the mystical qualities that distinguish the great conductors from the ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
"But, above all, we want these people to feel the sensation of what it is like 
to bring their hands down and have an orchestra respond."

FISCHL'S GROWTH DEFINED IN WIGHT EXHIBIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUVAN GEER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the years Eric Fischl's paintings have gone from being single glimpses of 
depraved lifestyles into more fluid, multipanel paintings which build to 
ambiguous but distressing scenarios. This shift to a composite reality is due 
to the influence of his drawings on transparent glassine. 
</P>
<P>
But, as is clear from this UCLA exhibit of 58 prints from 1986, it was in his 
serial monotypes that Fischl really developed fluidity of image. These series 
gathered under the title "Scenes and Sequences" allow him to alter the story 
repeatedly leaving behind a cumulative paper trail for the viewer. 
</P>
<P>
Fischl's images include figures, a touch of landscape, a hint of scene. But the 
artist zeroes in on the narrative power of the figure, on the way groups 
relate. He stirs things up so nothing can be taken for granted. Figures are 
based on old master art, historic photographs and snapshots he took at a 
clothing-optional Riviera beach. Expressive and bold in their chiaroscuro darks 
and lights they form an ambiguous world. Image to image males become female, 
whites becomes black, age happens before your eyes, animals become people and 
personal power drops in and out like a prodigal son. 
</P>
<P>
That kind of instability is possible because the artist exploits the serial 
possibilities of the monoprint. Ghosts of an original drawing reappear 
overlapped by new imagery or altered by new drawing and their own washed-out 
pallor. One series entitled "Backyard" begins with two women. Both are naked. 
The older one sits looking with affection at the younger woman who stands 
holding her swimsuit like a dirty rag in one hand while a dog in the foreground 
chews relentlessly on his posterior. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next two prints the older woman ages and fades away. The young Venus 
ages as well and the dog seems to give birth to a shadowy male figure who 
crouches behind. In the last two prints, only the crouching man remains but he 
is accompanied by a naked woman crawling around on all fours. Their 
relationship is detached voyeurism at first but remarkably becomes sexually 
intimate in the last image though little seems to change but the brushwork. 
</P>
<P>
Like first impressions, these are quick images, made rapidly with thin washes 
of paint and smears of a dry brush. Their spontaneity calls for a quick read 
and seems perfectly suited to a book where one image leads rapidly and 
inevitably to the next. Not as muscular as his painting, nor as deeply 
disturbing, they are nonetheless still impressive for the spirit of the 
drawing, and the way the narrative remains as fluid as the medium. (Frederic S. 
Wight Art Gallery, UCLA, through Sunday.) 
</P>
<P>
Show With a Social Conscience: Big, brash and pointedly bilateral, the 
paintings of Karen Carson overflow with exuberance and just a touch of social 
conscience. That moral stance is unexpected in such bubbly paintings as the 
ticking ecological tribute to Rachel Carson's "The Silent Spring." Here, wooden 
frame molding, energetic paint and a garish clock keeping accurate time all 
whirl in chaos around a dark book-shaped plexiglass form, almost completely 
obliterating a small strip of verdant garden. 
</P>
<P>
But there is little of the scold or the gloomy prophet about any of these 
paintings. One after another they explode into radiant sunbursts of color, 
determined to be passionately upbeat. Pieces of molding stroked by jittery 
paint or emblazoned with shards of mirror fracture the surface into a 
glittering dynamism. Mimicking the duality of the brain and owing as much to 
Modernism's love of the found object as barrio graffiti, the paintings 
appropriate beauty in all its guises -- from decals of butterflies to junk 
jewelry or the flames painted on hot-rods. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed Carson's appreciation for gang insignias gives her series of small 
black-and-red morality tales a haunting edge. Looking for all the world like 
designs worked up by a tattoo artist for a motorcycle gang, these "Dangerous 
Drawings" herald such unsavory topics as "Hate," "Greed," "Cancer" and "Drunk" 
with skulls, guns, flaming hearts and radiant arachnids. Distasteful in 
subject, threatening by association yet still powerful, each insignia is an 
intelligent lesson in attraction and repulsion. (Rosamund Felsen Gallery, 669 
N. La Cienega Blvd., to May 19.) 
</P>
<P>
Issues' in 3-D: James Trivers' newest 3-D paintings are getting better at 
fooling with the tricky comic book dimensionality that marks his oeuvre, but 
the ideas this time around get bogged down in heavy-handed, montage 
illustration. Granted, "Issues Without Answers," like AIDS and the narcissism 
behind plastic surgery, aren't easy to corral on one painting, but instead of a 
hard look we get headlines. Only occasionally, as in "Either or," do the 
fragmented pieces of information make something of the painting's struggle for 
depth and space to generate any kind of insight. (Newspace, 5241 Melrose Ave., 
to May 26.)

HOME TECH / CD CORNER: 'PET SOUNDS' FINALLY REISSUED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just in time for summer, Capitol Records is releasing three Beach Boys compact 
discs next week. 
</P>
<P>
The classic Los Angeles band's first two albums -- 1962's "Surfin' Safari" and 
1963's "Surfin' USA" -- will be released in a single, 56-minute CD, while a 
second, 60-minute CD will contain 1963's "Surfer Girl" and 1964's "Shut Down 
Volume 2." 
</P>
<P>
But the main prize for Beach Boys fans will be the long-overdue CD release of 
"Pet Sounds." Though the album was viewed as a commercial disappointment when 
first released in 1966 (it was one of the few Beach Boys albums in the '60s 
that didn't go gold), it is now widely regarded as the group's most 
accomplished work. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, "Pet Sounds" seems to gain in stature as the years go by. When British 
pop journalist Paul Gambaccini asked an international group of rock critics and 
disc jockeys in 1978 to name the best rock albums ever, "Pet Sounds" finished 
12th on the list of 200. When Gambaccini posed the same question to another 
group of writers and disc jockeys nine years later, the album moved up four 
places to No. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting a sophistication and emotional range that was far beyond almost 
anything attempted in early years of rock, "Pet Sounds" featured such graceful 
and endearing tunes as "Wouldn't It Be Nice," "God Only Knows" and "Caroline 
No." 
</P>
<P>
All three of the new Beach Boys CDs contain three bonus tracks and a booklet 
with photos, recording session information and comments from Brian Wilson about 
the albums. 
</P>
<P>
In his introduction to "Pet Sounds," Wilson recalls the way the Beatles' 
"Rubber Soul" inspired him in December, 1965. "I saw that every cut was very 
artistically interesting and stimulating . . . ," he writes. 
</P>
<P>
"In January, I started making the instrumental tracks for the album. I made 
each track a sound experience of its own. I was obsessed with explaining, 
musically, how I felt inside. This, I thought, could be the beginning of a new 
type of sophisticated-feeling music. I definitely felt the need to compete with 
the Beatles." 
</P>
<P>
The three CDs, which are scheduled to be in the stores on Tuesday, are part of 
a much larger series of Beach Boys reissues. Five other CDs -- all featuring 
two of the old Beach Boys albums -- are due by Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
IN THE STORES -- New CD releases include Leon Russell's "Stop All That Jazz" 
and "Hank Wilson's Back" (both featuring two bonus tracks). . . . "A Donny 
Hathaway Collection" (15 selections, including "In the Ghetto" and "Where's the 
Love"). . . . Hank Snow's "I'm Movin' On and Other Great Country Hits" (a 
20-song reissue also featuring "The Rhumba Boogie" and "I Don't Hurt Anymore").

HOME TECH / VIDEO: 2 FILMS ON FAMILIES WORTH A LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY ATKINSON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THIS WEEK'S MOVIES 
</P>
<P>
Who says there aren't any family films anymore? Well, at least there are still 
some movies about families. This weekend at the video store you can choose 
between two recent theatrical releases, one about a family ("Dad") and the 
other about a potential one ("Immediate Family"). 
</P>
<P>
"Dad" (MCA, priced for rental, PG) is a comedy/drama about growing old in 
America and the relationship between a father (Jack Lemmon) and son (Ted 
Danson). If that reminds you of "On Golden Pond," it should -- "Dad" has the 
same mix of smart lines and sentimentality. One more "family" element: Gary 
David Goldberg, from TV's "Family Ties," wrote, directed and co-produced. 
</P>
<P>
In "Immediate Family" (RCA, $89.95, PG-13), a couple (Glenn Close, James Woods) 
considers adopting the child of a pregnant, unwed teen-ager (Mary Stuart 
Masterson). The drama, also starring Kevin Dillon, was directed by Jonathan 
Kaplan. 
</P>
<P>
(Actually, your best bet is to skip the videos entirely and head for a theater 
where the sweet and sassy and very funny family comedy "Daddy's Dyin' . . . 
Who's Got the Will?" is playing.) 
</P>
<P>
Maybe you don't want a family film. You can't get much more non-family-oriented 
than "Drugstore Cowboy" (IVE, $89.95, R), a gritty, critically acclaimed 1989 
look at a drug addict (Matt Dillon). TERRY ATKINSON

REGULATORS MEET WITH BANKERS TO EASE CREDIT FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's top financial regulators held an extraordinary meeting with 
bankers on Thursday to avert fears of a credit crunch and to encourage the 
bankers to continue making "prudent" loans. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the regulators and the board of the American Bankers Assn. 
was scheduled several weeks ago at the regulators' request "to dispel a lot of 
rumors" about the federal agencies' examination of real estate loans in bank 
portfolios, said Lee Cross, a spokeswoman for Comptroller of the Currency 
Robert Clarke. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Clarke in a show of unity before the bankers were Federal Reserve Board 
Chairman Alan Greenspan and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William 
Seidman. 
</P>
<P>
"We are hearing stories of banks overreacting," Cross said. "We're not saying 
to banks, don't make loans. We're saying, make good loans." 
</P>
<P>
Many bank customers -- notably small businesses, real estate developers and 
builders -- have complained that they find it increasingly difficult to borrow 
money. They complain that bankers are exceedingly nervous about pressures from 
federal regulators, and have become wary of dealing with some of their oldest 
customers. The bankers, in turn, say the regulators cast a very critical eye on 
real estate loans. 
</P>
<P>
The financial regulators' mission Thursday was to tell the bankers to keep the 
money flowing in a judicious manner. 
</P>
<P>
"They were carefully trying to give the message not to overreact to examination 
policies, and to continue to make prudent loans," said Mary-Liz Meany, a 
spokeswoman for the American Bankers Assn. "They let us know they were 
listening to bankers' concerns," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the assurances, regulators are clearly worried about the real estate 
market, which has suffered sharp price declines in some regions. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman, who is also chief of the federal thrift cleanup effort, said Thursday 
in a breakfast meeting with Times reporters and editors that even in California 
weak real estate markets will cripple many already-troubled savings and loans 
-- forcing them into government hands and driving up the cost of the massive 
S&amp;L bailout. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate prices in the San Francisco area have "topped out now, by every 
indication," said Seidman. Government will be taking control of "a number of 
S&amp;Ls in the San Francisco area," he predicted, without naming any 
individual institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators have seized 400 failing S&amp;Ls and could acquire several 
hundred more, depending on the health of real estate markets, Seidman said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a moving target all the time, which is tied into the marketplace," said 
the chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp., which administers the takeover of 
S&amp;Ls and the sale of assets from defunct institutions. Taxpayers will bear 
the burden as the government closes insolvent S&amp;Ls and pays off depositors, 
whose accounts are insured up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;Ls are big construction and real estate lenders. When sales of homes and 
rentals of office buildings lag, borrowers default on loans, and thrift 
institutions suffer financial difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
The real estate depression in Texas and Oklahoma, under way for years, has 
spread to Arizona, and the Northeast is showing severe signs of weakness, 
Seidman said. "There is not a developer from here to Maine who doesn't have a 
problem on one of his projects," the RTC chairman said. "They're all under 
stress." 
</P>
<P>
Seidman avoided making any flat predictions of widespread economic trouble for 
California. But he noted that people in Arizona and Massachusetts were saying 
several years ago that their economies were too diversified to suffer a 
Texas-type plunge in real estate values.

"The California economy has been very strong; real estate markets are very 
strong," Seidman said. However, he said, in some areas of the state, there are 
"high new-construction levels, relatively low employment gains, and high 
new-vacancy rate gains." This means the supply of office space is apparently 
outpacing the economic activity needed to fill those new buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman came under criticism recently after issuing a list of real estate 
market indicators showing that some California cities had the highest office 
vacancy rates outside the depressed markets of Texas, Oklahoma, Arizona and 
Colorado.

BOESKY TO BE WITNESS AT TRIAL FOR FIRST TIME; 
</P>
<P>
SECURITIES: THE CONVICTED FINANCIER IS SCHEDULED TO TESTIFY IN NEXT WEEK'S 
TRIAL OF A FORMER ASSOCIATE INDICTED FOR INSIDE TRADING.

<P>
Ivan F. Boesky, the notorious former stock speculator whose aid to prosecutors 
toppled some of the mightiest figures on Wall Street, may soon debut as a 
prosecution witness in a criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
Boesky is slated to testify in the federal securities fraud trial of his former 
friend and business associate, John A. Mulheren Jr., who, like Boesky, was a 
stock arbitrager. Mulheren, 40, is accused of engaging in phony securities 
trades with Boesky and manipulating the stock market at his request. Jury 
selection is to begin Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Since Boesky agreed to plead guilty to two felony counts in 1986, he has 
cooperated with federal investigators and testified behind closed doors in 
front of grand juries. The beans he spilled led to the cases against Drexel 
Burnham Lambert and its former junk bond chief, Michael Milken; against Boyd L. 
Jefferies, former head of the Los Angeles brokerage Jefferies &amp; Co., and 
against Martin A. Siegel, a former takeover expert at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. 
and at Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
But because these cases led to guilty pleas rather than trials, Boesky hasn't 
had to appear publicly as a government witness. In the Mulheren trial, his 
credibility will be on the line for the first time in front of a jury. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Puccio, Mulheren's pugnacious defense lawyer, says he is looking forward 
to cross-examining Boesky, an admitted felon. "I think he's a pathological 
liar," Puccio said. 
</P>
<P>
A telephone call to Boesky's lawyer, Robert B. McCaw, for comment wasn't 
returned Thursday. Prosecutors declined to discuss the impending trial, 
including how much of their case against Mulheren hinges on Boesky's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
The case has additional interest because Mulheren was arrested in 1988 after he 
allegedly attempted to drive away from his Rumson, N.J., mansion with a loaded 
Israeli-made assault rifle, planning, police said, to kill Boesky. Prosecutors 
said Mulheren was angry because Boesky was providing evidence against him. 
</P>
<P>
However, Mulheren's lawyers at the time said he was suffering a flare-up of his 
longstanding manic-depressive illness. New Jersey authorities dropped the gun 
case on the condition that Mulheren undergo treatment. Federal charges related 
to the alleged plan to shoot Boesky also were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Mulheren was indicted in June, 1989, in the case coming to trial Monday. He 
faces 41 counts of securities fraud, mail fraud, conspiracy and falsifying 
books and records. 
</P>
<P>
Mulheren was a general partner and head of the now-defunct Jamie Securities, a 
firm that specialized in investing in takeover stocks, and he allegedly 
manipulated the price of Gulf &amp; Western shares at Boesky's request. He also 
allegedly engaged in sham securities trades that, the indictment charges, 
enabled Boesky to evade income taxes and circumvent the minimum capital 
requirements that the federal government imposes on securities firms. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, Mulheren allegedly got secret inside stock information from 
Boesky. If convicted, Mulheren faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison 
and a $250,000 fine on each count. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard L. DeStefano, a former trader at Jamie, also is a defendant in the 
case. Like Mulheren, he has denied wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Mulheren currently is a partner in a New York Stock Exchange specialist firm, 
J&amp;B Specialist Corp. In association with a unit of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., 
J&amp;B makes a market for a variety of stocks, including those of Texaco and 
Prime Computer, on the floor of the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Bear Stearns said Mulheren doesn't have a direct relationship 
with the firm and doesn't receive money from it. A New York Stock Exchange 
spokeswoman declined to say if the exchange might discipline Mulheren if he is 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors are keeping mum about when Boesky will appear during the trial. 
Puccio says only that he has been informed officially that Boesky will testify. 
</P>
<P>
Puccio declined to comment on the defense's strategy in the trial. "In this 
business, one doesn't telegraph any punches," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Puccio said Mulheren "expects to be vindicated" in the trial and continues 
to maintain that "he hasn't violated any laws." 
</P>
<P>
Mulheren is said to feel particularly betrayed by Boesky, in part because he 
arranged a bailout of Boesky's company when it nearly went under in 1982 due to 
a bad investment. Mulheren and Boesky were close friends and had worked 
together in charitable activities. 
</P>
<P>
Boesky recently completed a sentence that included time in a minimum-security 
federal prison.

Bell Atlantic Suspension Dropped: The Treasury Department said it agreed to let 
Bell Atlantic Corp. and a subsidiary, Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Co., 
bid on government contracts again. The department had suspended Bell Atlantic 
and C&amp;P on April 3 from contracting with the executive branch on the 
grounds the companies had "made a material misrepresentation in competing for 
the contract" in January to provide a new digital telephone system for Treasury 
offices in the Washington area.

Cummins Engine Fends Off Investors: Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd. agreed not 
to buy more shares of Cummins Engine Co. or seek representation on its board of 
directors for 10 years. The Hong Kong investment group made the announcement as 
part of a settlement agreement with Cummins that would dismiss all litigation 
concerning alleged securities laws violations. Industrial, which owns nearly 15 
percent of Cummins, agreed to make an acquisition proposal for the diesel 
engine maker, not to make a tender offer and not to solicit proxies to elect 
one or more directors.

Consumer Credit Swells by $2.6 Billion: Americans took out $2.6-billion more in 
consumer credit than they paid off in March as borrowing to buy automobiles 
rebounded from February, the Federal Reserve reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed said consumer credit increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
4.4%, up from a scant 0.1% rise in February. That represented a sharp revision 
from the 5.7% rate estimated earlier for February and made the month the 
weakest in a year. Automobile loans in March advanced $1.8 billion, a 7.5% 
annual rate, after falling at a 5.2% rate in February. The total consumer debt 
at the end of March was $721.5 billion.

AN EX-PRESIDENTIAL BAN IS IMPOSED ON TUNA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former President Gerald R. Ford has banned tuna at his family table. But he's 
not worried about dolphins. He wants to save U.S. fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
"I am sad and angry, " Ford fumed in a May 4 letter to the three big tuna 
canners, who announced recently that they wouldn't buy any tuna caught in ways 
that kill dolphins. "This is a clear-cut case of unfair discrimination against 
American fishermen." 
</P>
<P>
Ford continued, "Your decision means you will buy tuna from foreign sources 
where there is no monitoring of the dolphin kill . . . The Ford family has 
always enjoyed tuna. However, we have now decided to remove tuna from our 
family menu." 
</P>
<P>
The American Tunaboat Assn. and others have charged that the canners' ban on 
tuna caught in connection with dolphins will only encourage foreign fishermen 
to use such techniques more, while forcing the U.S. fleet to make expensive 
changes in technique or get out of fishing altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, the canners think otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's got some of the facts confused, or whoever is helping him out 
here is a little bit confused," said Daniel P. Sullivan, president of San 
Diego-based Bumble Bee Seafoods Co., one of the targets of Ford's ire along 
with H.J. Heinz Co., which owns StarKist Seafoods, and Van Camp Seafood Co. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists used tougher language. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he has the slightest bit of knowledge about this issue," said 
Samuel LaBudde, a former federal fisheries biologist and long-time 
environmental activist. "These vessel-owners are multimillionaires, and they 
can afford to fish in ways that do not slaughter dolphins." 
</P>
<P>
StarKist "will continue to buy from American fishermen who are 'dolphin safe,' 
" reads the letter that StarKist intends to mail today in response, said Bill 
Fallon, StarKist vice president. "We have made specific proposals to the U.S. 
government and to Congress to protect the livelihood of the American fisherman 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
Bumble Bee also plans to answer Ford's letter in the next few days, Sullivan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, we would not expect any real decrease in the amount of U.S. fish that 
we will buy," he said. "The indication in the letter is that we will be buying 
fish from foreign-flag vessels that don't follow the rules, and that simply 
isn't the case." 
</P>
<P>
This isn't the ex-president's only brush with tuna. Ford's son, Jack, recently 
married Juliann Felando. Her father, August Felando, happens to be president of 
the American Tunaboat Assn. 
</P>
<P>
That had nothing to do with it, a spokeswoman says. 
</P>
<P>
"It originated with President Ford," said Penny Circle, Ford's chief of staff.

Eastern Switches Ad Agencies: Eastern Airlines handed its $45-million 
advertising account to the New York ad agency Ogilvy &amp; Mather. 
</P>
<P>
The business was formerly handled by Lintas: New York, which had been the 
agency of record since 1982. Martin Shugrue, recently named as the bankruptcy 
trustee for the struggling unit of Texas Air Corp., said the change was 
prompted by the airline's current opportunity to "make a new beginning" with 
the direction of its marketing and advertising. The agency transition will take 
place over the next 90 says, although Ogilvy will begin working on the account 
immediately.

WIRELESS, NON-CELLULAR PHONE TO GET TEST

A New York company said Thursday that it will begin testing within two years a 
revolutionary wireless telephone system in Houston and Orlando, Fla., designed 
to compete with wired and cellular systems. 
</P>
<P>
The lightweight, wallet-sized phones will use high-frequency microwave signals 
to connect with each other over short distances, such as in office buildings or 
within neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The new system, known as a personal communications network, could be connected 
with PCNs in other cities to provide nationwide communications. Owners would 
only need to dial a code to let the system know where they were, said J. Shelby 
Bryan, chairman of Millicom Inc., a New York-based international cellular 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Shelby said the Federal Communications Commission on Thursday approved a 
request for a Millicom subsidiary, PCN America Inc., to test the system. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, American Personal Communications Inc. received FCC 
permission to test a similar phone, but it would operate with certain 
restrictions. The company hopes to begin testing next year. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the short range of high-frequency microwave signals -- as little as 
600 feet -- PCN, unlike regular cellular service, will be able to share space 
with other private microwave users. 
</P>
<P>
This feature greatly increases the system's capacity -- and its attractiveness 
to businesses, which may find PCNs more convenient in an office building than 
wired systems. 
</P>
<P>
A large number of users in small areas would greatly lower the cost of the 
phone units -- perhaps to $100 or less, Bryan said.

REBATES COST FORD $4 BILLION ANNUALLY

Rebates are costing Ford Motor Co. about $4 billion a year, eroding the auto 
maker's profit as it fights to hold its U.S. market share, executives said at 
the company's annual meeting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Ford President Philip Benton said after the shareholders' meeting that the 
average of about $1,000 in incentive costs for every car and light truck Ford 
sells is about double last year's rate. 
</P>
<P>
Ford, GM and Chrysler all reported last week that incentive costs helped push 
their first quarter profits sharply lower from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Ford, the nation's second-largest auto maker behind GM, earned $506.2 million 
during the first three months of the year, down 69% from last year's company 
record first-quarter earnings. GM's quarterly earnings fell 54%, and Chrysler's 
dropped 80%. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the increased marketing and product expenditures will continue to 
affect profits throughout the year," Ford Chairman Harold Poling told 
shareholders. Poling succeeded Donald Petersen as Ford's chairman March 1. 
</P>
<P>
If incentives work, they boost a company's sales pace but cut directly into 
profit. Ford's share of the U.S. market for domestically built cars stood at 
28.6% at the end of April, compared to GM's 46% and Chrysler's 11%. 
</P>
<P>
In a news conference after the two-hour meeting, Poling said he hoped that with 
the new products Ford is offering this year, including a new Escort subcompact 
and Explorer sport-utility vehicle, the company will be able to reduce its 
rebate costs. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, auto makers hesitate to put incentives on new vehicles, thinking 
that their freshness makes them popular without the enticements. 
</P>
<P>
GM President Robert Stempel said Wednesday that the new vehicles his company 
introduces this year should cut GM's incentive costs.

30-YEAR TREASURY BILLS SELL WELL AT FINALE OF AUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
Heavy buying by institutional investors helped bring the final and most 
sensitive stage of the government's $30.5-billion Treasury auction to a 
successful conclusion Thursday at lower-than-expected interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury Department auctioned off $10 billion in 30-year bonds at an 
average yield of 8.84% -- 0.04 percentage point less than the average yield on 
10-year Treasury bonds auctioned off the day before. 
</P>
<P>
The relatively low yield and warm reception to the sale was a surprise to many 
bond traders, who had feared that there would be slack demand for the long-term 
securities. Small investors and the Japanese, who bought a substantial portion 
of the three- and 10-year Treasury notes sold earlier in the week, were not big 
participants in Thursday's auction. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller investors bought a full 23% of the three-year notes on Tuesday but less 
than 5% of Thursday's issue. No precise figures are available for Japanese 
purchases, but bond traders estimated that they bought about 20% of the 
offering, compared to 25% to 30% of the shorter-term securities. 
</P>
<P>
Big institutional investors that apparently had been sitting on substantial 
cash reserves stepped in with heavy purchases during and after the auction, 
said Anthony Vignola, managing director of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw tremendous buying by institutions," added Alan McClymonds, co-manager 
of government trading at First Boston Corp. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Hours after the auction, in fact, buying was so strong in the secondary market 
that prices were bid up and yields fell to 8.81%, said Michael Ingraham, senior 
vice president and manager of the investment division at Mitsui Manufacturers 
Bank in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
That may seem like a tiny change, but these bonds typically sell in large 
blocks. The 0.03 percentage point difference amounted to a $3,050 profit for 
someone buying $1 million in bonds at the average auction price and selling 
only a few hours later, Ingraham added. 
</P>

The success of the auction helped bolster the government securities market, 
which had been languishing for three weeks, bond traders said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of fear that the market couldn't handle this much new debt," 
McClymonds said. But it is stronger than it usually is after a quarterly 
Treasury auction -- a bullish signal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If trading keeps up like this tomorrow, I think we are going to see this 
market take off," McClymonds said.

INTEREST RATE DECLINE SENDS DOW UP 5.63

<P>
Stocks managed a slight gain Thursday, helped by a U.S. Treasury auction of 
30-year bonds that left the bond market higher and lowered interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, which had slipped 0.68 on Wednesday, 
rose 5.63 to 2,738.51. 
</P>
<P>
In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 4 to 
3 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 847 up, 
601 down and 522 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's sales of three-year and 10-year notes Tuesday and Wednesday both 
met with what analysts described as good receptions. 
</P>
<P>
But many observers believed that the sternest test of the interest rate outlook 
came in Thursday's offering of $10 billion in 30-year notes, which came to a 
less definitive outcome. The issue sold at an average yield of 8.84%, producing 
no great surprise favoring either the bulls or the bears. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers noted that upward pressure on interest rates has lately been 
concentrated in the longest-maturity sector of the credit markets. 
</P>
<P>
"The market has had its eye on this Treasury refunding for a fair amount of 
time. I believe that's been one of the stumbling blocks to getting this market 
moving," said Gene Jay Seagle, director of technical research at Gruntal &amp; 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
The benchmark 30-year bond ended the day up about a third of a point. 
</P>
<P>
Another source of uncertainty was the impending report today on the producer 
price index of finished goods for April. The index, a closely watched gauge of 
inflationary pressures, is expected to show a rise in the 0.1% to 0.3% range. 
</P>
<P>
Gainers among the blue chips included Eastman Kodak, up 1 at 39 1/8; General 
Electric, up 1/2 at 67 1/4 ; Bristol-Myers Squibb, up 7/8 at 59 3/8; 
International Business Machines, up 1 1/8 at 112 3/8, and American Telephone 
&amp; Telegraph, up 3/4 at 41 1/4 . 
</P>
<P>
Honeywell gained 1/8 to 95, trading at 52-week highs. The company said it had 
decided to spin off its defense and marine systems business after failing to 
find a buyer for those operations. 
</P>
<P>
Gap Inc. climbed 3 7/8 to 67 3/8. The company reported a 25% jump in same-store 
sales for April, pacing what analysts described as a good month for apparel 
sales in general. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 158.46 million shares, up from 152.22 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo stock prices closed higher on optimism that the yen would continue to 
strengthen against the dollar despite its decline on the day. The key 225-share 
Nikkei index closed up 34.65 points at 30,980.26. 
</P>
<P>
Prices fell on the London Stock Exchange, weakened by profit taking and 
declines among blue chip stocks. The Financial Times 100-share index finished 
5.7 points lower at 2,157.0. In Frankfurt, West Germany, shares finished mixed. 
The DAX 30-share index ended 3.16 points lower at 1,893.42. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CREDIT 
</P>
<P>
Bond Prices Rise as Auction Winds Up 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices pushed higher with the completion of the government's auction of 
$10 billion in 30-year bonds. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for already issued 30-year bonds, prices rose 9/32 
point, or about $2.80 for every $1,000 in face value. Their yield fell to 8.83% 
from 8.86% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The bond market also got a lift from a new government report on consumer credit 
that indicated credit demand may be growing slower than expected, lessening 
pressure on interest rates, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve said Americans' consumer credit rose at a seasonally 
adjusted 4.4% annual rate in March. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.188%, unchanged from late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Falls Against Swiss Franc, Mark 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell to two-year lows against the Swiss franc and West German mark 
but managed to gain ground against most other foreign currencies. 
</P>
<P>
Investors continued to flock to the Swiss franc, sending the dollar to levels 
not seen since April, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the Swiss leading the way here and it has been for the last 48 hours," 
said Andrew Ellott, international foreign exchange dealer at Chase Manhattan 
Bank in London. 
</P>
<P>
The Swiss currency moved aggressively higher in overseas trading, and dealers 
struggled to assess whether talk that $2 billion had been sold to buy Swiss 
francs was more than a rumor. 
</P>
<P>
"It may have happened," said Bob Morrissey, a senior trader with Bank of 
Boston. The franc has been rising because of high Swiss interest rates, strong 
Asian demand and the increasing view of the franc as a "safe haven" currency. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar finished mixed in Europe and initially rose when trading shifted to 
the United States. But the U.S. currency fell back when traders, "who retain an 
overwhelmingly bearish outlook, sold into the dollar's strength," said Marc 
Chandler, an analyst with MMS International in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 156.75 Japanese yen from 157.03 yen on 
Wednesday. Later in London, it rose to 156.97 yen. In New York, the dollar rose 
to 156.73 yen from 156.50 yen on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the British pound fell to $1.6770, from $1.6785 late Wednesday. In 
New York, it cost $1.6775 to buy one pound, cheaper than Wednesday's $1.6785. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices fell after rising overseas. 
</P>
<P>
In precious metals trading, gold bullion for immediate delivery on the New York 
Commodity Exchange fell $1.80 an ounce to $370.10. Republic National Bank in 
New York also quoted bullion at $370.10 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, off $1.80 
from late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Grain, Soybeans Up in Cautious Trading 
</P>
<P>
Grain and soybean futures closed mostly higher in quiet trading on the Chicago 
Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
Trading was subdued in advance of the Agriculture Department's first estimate 
of U.S. winter wheat production, corn and soybean production, and new supply 
and demand tables. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, precious metals and copper were mixed, while livestock, pork 
and energy futures were mostly lower. 
</P>
<P>
After trading ended, the USDA estimated winter wheat production at a nine-year 
high of 2.09 billion bushels, up 44% from last year's drought-reduced harvest 
of 1.45 billion bushels. 
</P>
<P>
Winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the following year. It 
accounts for about three-fourths of the U.S. total wheat production. The 
remainder is produced in spring. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 corn harvest was projected at 8.1 billion bushels, up from 7.53 
billion harvested last year. Soybean production was projected at 1.925 billion 
bushels, nearly identical to the 1.927 billion bushels in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the winter wheat harvest estimate was larger than expected, 
adding that they believe that the figure would be a drag on prices in today's 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, strong activity in the European meal market gave a boost to 
soybean futures, as did steady demand in the export market. 
</P>
<P>
Corn futures were boosted by rain and cool temperatures in the Midwest, which 
could cause delays in planting both corn and soybeans, said Pat O'Connell, an 
analyst with Refco Inc. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat futures received some support from the Soviet Union's latest bid for 
550,000 metric tons of wheat under the export bonus program. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat settled 2.50 cents lower to 2.50 cents higher, with the contract for 
delivery in May at $3.82 a bushel; corn was 0.75 cent lower to 3.25 cents 
higher, with May at $2.8925 a bushel; oats were unchanged to 0.75 cent higher, 
with May at $1.655 a bushel, and soybeans were 3 cents lower to 1.25 cents 
higher, with May at $6.48 a bushel.

MIKE DOWNEY: HE DOESN'T FIGURE TO BE COOPED UP TOO LONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By MIKE DOWNEY

<TEXT>
<P>
Sad is the day that the Lakers must sit down Michael Cooper. As a rule you 
don't take out Michael Cooper when you want to give your basketball team a 
lift. You put him in. 
</P>
<P>
The Coopster, alas, donated 20 literally if not figuratively pointless minutes 
to Game 1 of the Western Conference playoff series against the Phoenix Suns, 
which the Lakers lost. So, Coach Pat Riley felt compelled to do something. The 
time had come to shake up and wake up the Lakers, if only gently. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Larry Drew. Early. When Riley made his first substitution in the 
backcourt Thursday night at the Forum, there were no cries of "Cooooop! 
Cooooop!" Of course, there were no cries of "Drewwwww! Drewwwww!" either, but 
that may be because some of those in the postseason-party crowd of 17,505 
didn't recognize Larry Drew. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Drew had worked only 11 minutes in five Laker playoff games, 
including the series against Houston. He didn't even get into two of the five 
games. And there isn't much a dude can do when they only allot you a couple of 
minutes. It is plenty of time if you happen to be riding Unbridled, but for a 
professional basketball player, two minutes is barely enough time make it 
necessary to launder your socks. 
</P>
<P>
Hard to tell what part Larry Drew played in the Lakers' 124-100 Game 2 victory. 
You couldn't exactly call him an inspiration. In the 19 minutes he spent on 
court, Drew made no hoops, took no shots, snatched no rebounds, had three 
assists. It was what you might call a quiet contribution. 
</P>
<P>
"Pat just told me to be ready to get the call when my number's called," Drew 
said later. "It really doesn't matter if I'm the first guard off the bench or 
not. I'm just trying to do something positive. And the first thing on my mind 
is defense, not offense." 
</P>
<P>
Drew did do something positive. He must have. And that's good. Because the 
Lakers need backcourt backup. Magic Johnson and Byron Scott are made of flesh 
and blood; never was that so apparent as last season, when side by side they 
watched a Laker dynasty end, hamstrung to do anything about it. 
</P>
<P>
In olden days, Michael Cooper would have come to the rescue. Riley called on 21 
the way others dialed 911. But Coop's heroism nowadays is confined more to 
specific plays than to total performance. 
</P>
<P>
Is Michael Cooper washed up? 
</P>
<P>
We hope not and think not. Coop still has plenty of smarts and heart. The legs 
might have betrayed him a bit, and his shooting certainly has -- he is one of 
18 from the floor in the playoffs, thus the demotion -- but nobody is inclined 
yet to say that Michael Cooper's NBA days are numbered. One will get you 10 
that before these playoffs are over, Cooper will do something spectacular, 
something that will have the Forum faithful cooing his name. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Riley evidently has decided to move Drew from fourth guard to 
third. And this is no unimportant promotion for the Lakers. They have depended 
on Cooper so long and so often that it has become second nature. The Lakers of 
the 1980s expected no serious dropoff in quality when Riley went to his bench. 
Cooper would take the baton from Scott or Johnson and run a beautiful relay 
leg. 
</P>
<P>
That is the one thing missing with the Lakers of today. The irony of Life After 
Kareem is that the team seems as sound as ever on the front line, where Orlando 
Woolridge and Vlade Divac, the Flying Getashotov Brothers, virtually never fail 
to enter a game and motivate both the Lakers and their fans. They did so 
Thursday. They do what Coop used to do. 
</P>
<P>
It is at guard, where Los Angeles has perhaps the greatest one to ever play the 
game, that the Lakers must show improvement if they are to wear the NBA crown 
for the third time in four years. Drew did his bit in Game 2. He gave the 
regulars a rest, and attached himself close enough to Phoenix's Jeff Hornacek 
that at times they appeared to be dancing the lambada. 
</P>
<P>
But there was precious little offense supplied by the Laker reinforcements at 
guard. In fact, this entire postseason has been nothing but bad news in that 
department. How many baskets have Laker backup guards made in six playoff 
games? Two, that's how many. Repeat: two. We are not exactly talking Vinnie 
Johnson here, are we? 
</P>
<P>
"At least we got off to a fast start -- finally," Drew said. "I don't know what 
the reason was. I doubt it was me. But at least we finally got off to a good 
start instead of a bad one." 
</P>
<P>
The No. 3 guard situation might not be something Pat Riley considers to be of 
an urgent nature, but it doesn't exactly put him to bed dreaming of City Hall 
and parades. As long as playing Larry Drew earlier proved worthwhile in Game 2, 
might as well do it again in Game 3. Do whatever works. 
</P>
<P>
And Michael Cooper? Don't worry. We may be seeing him later than usual, but we 
haven't seen the last of him.

ANGELS APPROACH THE CELLAR;

BASEBALL: LOSS TO MARINERS LEAVES TEAM IN A VIRTUAL TIE FOR LAST PLACE WITH THE 
ROYALS.

There is talk of patience around the Angel clubhouse, but there are also signs 
of desperation. 
</P>
<P>
There are pitchers who say they are pressing, trying to pitch too fine. They 
understand that they might not get enough runs to win if they do not. There are 
hitting worries and there are fielding worries. And there is General Manager 
Mike Port, who says he sees his team pressing -- "Just like people falling down 
a cliff, grabbing at every bush and shrub." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels have been unable to stop themselves until they hit bottom, which 
they did Thursday night with a 5-2 loss to the Seattle Mariners that dropped 
them into a virtual tie with the Kansas City Royals for last place in the 
American League West, 11 games behind the Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, who remain ahead on percentage points only because they have played 
two more games than the Royals, have not made up any ground on Oakland since 
April 22, and have won only six of their past 22 games, and only one of their 
past eight. 
</P>
<P>
They are chasing a team that is not cooperating. The A's have won nine of their 
past 10. But the A's were not the problem Thursday. They didn't even play. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' loss in front of 13,958 at the Kingdome, combined with Kansas 
City's victory over the Texas Rangers, left the two teams expected to contend 
against Oakland tied for last instead. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels are groping for ways to change that. 
</P>
<P>
"What turns this thing around is that one internal spark," Manager Doug Rader 
said. "I know it's there. I know it's going to happen. I know we're very close. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels showed possibility early in Thursday's game. Luis Polonia led off by 
beating out a grounder to short for a hit. He took second on a wild pitch and 
stole third. 
</P>
<P>
Wally Joyner's one-out single to left brought him home, and sent Chili Davis, 
who had walked, to second. Dante Bichette's single to right-center drove in 
Davis and gave the Angels a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But the lead disappeared in the fourth inning, when starter Kirk McCaskill, who 
had allowed only one hit over the first three innings, gave up four runs on 
five hits. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Briley and Alvin Davis singled with no outs. That brought up Jeffrey 
Leonard, who homered twice in the Angels' 10-8 loss to the Mariners in the 
Kingdome last Thursday and irritated some Angels with his languorous trot. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill went to 2-and-0 against Leonard, who then lined a single to left, 
scoring Briley and moving Davis to second. Edgar Martinez's single tied the 
score. 
</P>
<P>
With two out and runners on second and third, catcher Dave Valle came to the 
plate. Valle is batting .253 overall, but is hitting .400 with men in scoring 
position. 
</P>
<P>
Valle knocked a two-out single up the middle, driving in Ken Griffey Jr. and 
Darnell Coles for a 4-2 lead. McCaskill struck out Mike Brumley to end the 
inning, but the Angels never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Rader contends that the team is not far from being good, that the big trouble 
is the result of small shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
"Invariably, most of the damage is done with two outs," Rader said. "That's 
what I mean about not making one pitch or one play." 
</P>
<P>
Twice, the Angels had promising opportunities to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth, with Kent Anderson on first after a single to left, Chili Davis 
drove a ball deep to right, but Coles made a leaping catch against the wall. 
</P>
<P>
"Another foot or so on Chili's ball would make a difference," Rader said. 
"Those are the kind of things that make the difference you need." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels put runners on first and second with none out in the sixth on 
singles by Joyner and Bichette off Seattle starter Brian Holman (5-2), but the 
inning ended without a run after Brian Downing flied to left, Jack Howell 
struck out, and Lance Parrish flied to left. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle added another run in the seventh inning when Valle reached on a 
fielding error by third baseman Jack Howell, his fifth of the season, and 
Brumley hit a ball off the wall in right-center for a triple. 
</P>
<P>
Port, who says he continues to hold discussions about possible trades, said he 
is standing by the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I continue to have a lot of faith and confidence in these fellows," Port said. 
"As they say, on paper, we are a better ballclub than we have been playing." 
</P>
<P>
On paper, they are listed at the bottom of the division, along with Kansas 
City. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Center fielder Devon White, who is batting .192, was not in the lineup for only 
the third time this season. Manager Doug Rader repeated his stance that each 
day's lineup is the one he believes will be most productive that day. "There's 
no question Devon is struggling, no question at all," Rader said. "But I don't 
want anybody to get the impression we're hanging the whole thing on him. That's 
not our intent." . . . With White sitting out, Dante Bichette moved to center, 
and Chili Davis started in right, making his first appearance there since Oct. 
2, 1988. Brian Downing was the designated hitter, marking the second time in 
three games that both he and Davis, who have shared DH duties, were in the 
lineup.

APARTHEID: COUNTRY HAS MADE STRIDES, BUT CAN'T RE-ENTER WORLD SPORTS STAGE WITH 
SEPARATIST POLICY.

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why anyone would care about sports in South Africa, a country flirting 
simultaneously with democracy and anarchy, is a good question. Surely, the 
officials attempting to hold the country together have more pressing concerns. 
</P>
<P>
This is understood. So why, then, do politicians here come back again and again 
to the plight of the athletes of South Africa, who ask: When will we become 
acceptable enough to the world sports community to be let back in? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it is because every day, in offices and schools and bars and clubs, South 
Africans of all colors talk about sports; they debate and even come to blows 
about sports. And as sports is a mirror of society, so does society mirror 
sports. This color-conscious land is peopled with fans who fall in along color 
lines: Blacks love soccer, Afrikaners love rugby and English-speaking whites 
love cricket. 
</P>
<P>
If only every issue in South Africa were so simple. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem facing South African sports officials is how to get back 
into the Olympic movement. The problems are not simple, and many of the 
solutions are out of the hands of sports officials and in the hands of South 
Africa's legislators. 
</P>
<P>
After three decades of boycotts and isolation, South Africa wants back. It 
wants to be friends again. South African sports officials have tried 
everything. They have lobbied. They have hovered in hotel coffee shops. They 
have attended conventions and congresses and meetings to which they have not 
been invited, and smile even when delegates walk briskly past. 
</P>
<P>
"We go to all the (International Amateur Athletic Federation) meetings, but no 
one will meet with us," said Gert le Roux, director of the South African 
Amateur Athletic Union. "We are never welcome, and some of these people used to 
be our friends. After a while, we become embarrassed by hanging about in hotel 
lobbies." 
</P>
<P>
The snubs are difficult to swallow. Professor J.S. Vermaak, President of the 
South African Rugby Board, explained that while South Africa is still a 
founding member of the International Rugby Football Union, the country is 
effectively banned. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year, South Africa is on the schedule," he said. "Every year, no one 
comes." 
</P>
<P>
In their search for acceptance, sports officials even placed a "sports 
ambassador" from South Africa in London. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Barlow was one of South Africa's best cricket players when he was sent on 
a three-year stint to England to direct South Africa's sports office there. His 
mandate: Promote South African sport internationally and let the world know how 
integrated it was. 
</P>
<P>
Barlow came back to South Africa in 1987 a disillusioned man. He said the job 
was nearly impossible, especially with the fast-growing international 
anti-apartheid lobby. 
</P>
<P>
In his contacts with sports officials, Barlow said he made a significant 
discovery: The sporting world was not anti-South Africa, it was anti-apartheid. 
He transmitted this message many times to sports officials in South Africa, and 
it was their lack of response that drove him to quit. 
</P>
<P>
"If sports administrators continue to wrap themselves up in political 
ideologies, and believe that South Africa is right and the rest of the world is 
wrong, then they shouldn't cry if we remain isolated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The name of the game is upholding human rights, not playing political power 
games. Doors will open if we abandon apartheid as a repressive and political 
tool -- that's the chance our sporting friends abroad are asking for." 
</P>
<P>
Since the begining of South Africa's isolation, the intent of the world's 
sporting bodies was to pressure politicians through sport. Since the beginning, 
South African officials believed they could withstand the pressure, and the 
world sporting community believed the pressure would work. Both appear to have 
been correct. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, three decades of sports boycotts have brought about change in South 
Africa, not only in sports but also in society as a whole. It is equally clear 
that the very relic the boycotts meant to cast out still remains in place -- 
apartheid has been chipped at since 1948, but it remains one symbolic wall that 
hasn't been brought down. 
</P>
<P>
So, there has been some change and some resistance. South African sports 
officials today find themselves holding onto a taut line with no more to give 
either way. 
</P>
<P>
"In the early days, they really thought they would be able to overcome all the 
pressure from the world. I think that was the big mistake they made in the 
past." said Johan du Plessis, president of the South African National Olympic 
Committee. "That (mistake) was, from our side, matching up with Europe and 
maybe America, that (coalition) would be strong enough against Africa. They 
didn't realize the whole thing was going to turn in favor of Africa. Africa 
took over the United Nations, the IOC." 
</P>
<P>
Agonizing over missed opportunities doesn't help solve problems -- even if the 
mistakes are grave, such as South Africa's snubbing of its neighbor nations in 
favor of "white" countries in which it felt more kinship. Now, in an era of 
reconciliation, African countries are not in the mood to overlook past slights 
-- or present conditions. 
</P>
<P>
But the delicate relationship with the rest of Africa is crucial to South 
Africa's future in the Olympic movement, for Olympic officials have made it 
clear that the way back for South Africa must wind through Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Two workmen are sitting in a tin shed by the Eastbank Hall swimming pool in 
Alexandra, waiting for the delivery of paint for the bottom of the pool. They 
have been waiting for two weeks. When the pool was built, the wrong paint was 
used, and ever since it hasn't been right. Sometimes someone comes by with some 
paint for the pool, but it isn't right, either. 
</P>
<P>
So, here in the middle of South Africa's summer, the only pool in this black 
township is closed. 
</P>
<P>
Alexandra's best soccer field was partially covered with brown grass and 
potholes because residents weren't able to water, resod or bring in equipment 
to grade it. 
</P>
<P>
Soweto, with a population of 2.5 million, relies largely on its schools to 
provide sports facilities for the black children. It is a faint hope, however, 
in a country where schools are segregated and the government spends five times 
more money to educate its white children than its black. 
</P>
<P>
"They are telling you lies abroad," said a community activist in Soweto who 
would give only his first name, Rapu. "They tell you our facilities are equal. 
You can see they are not. South Africa belongs to all who are in it. We must 
work to make a country for all the people. Sport has a significant role to 
play. But there are priorities. You can't have a society that has thousands of 
sports facilities when you have people who are not healthy enough to play the 
sports." 
</P>
<P>
Rapu is fully behind the sports boycotts, even though he acknowledges that 
black South Africans are doubly punished: They are not allowed free and open 
competition within South Africa, and, as South Africans, they are not allowed 
to compete against the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
There is an argument advancing the notion that rather than stifling sports in 
South Africa, those who seek to bring about political change ought to encourage 
sports and nourish them. This argument holds that the interaction among races 
that sports bring, the camaraderie it engenders, is a far more effective tool 
to bring people together than laws and edicts. 
</P>
<P>
Jannie Momberg, a Member of Parliament from the Democratic party, agrees with 
this view and says that in South Africa, sports has another role. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that sport has been used by the South African government as a kite 
-- to see which way the wind was blowing in the country," he said. "If it 
worked in sports, they put it in place elsewhere in society." 
</P>
<P>
This kite is difficult to fly in a wind so strong that it seeks to bring it 
down. However, in the last year, three historic meetings took place that may 
have changed the direction of the anti-South African wind. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 11, Johan du Plessis and J.B. du Plessis, the director of the South 
African National Olympic Committee, met in Lausanne, Switzerland, with Juan 
Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee. The topic: 
How to get South Africa back into the Olympic movement. 
</P>
<P>
Samaranch explained that for South Africa to get back, it must work through its 
continent -- only the IOC members from Africa will be able to help South 
Africa. "If they accept you, the rest of the world will accept you," Samaranch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Events moved swiftly. On Oct. 11, the Du Plessises (they are unrelated) met 
with Judge Keba Mbaye, an IOC vice president from Senegal. Mbaye told them that 
Africa was their ticket back, and expected no less than the abolition of 
apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
That paved the way for a meeting on Jan. 9 in Paris with Sam Ramsamy and Fekrou 
Kidane, who are advisers to the IOC Commission on Apartheid and Olympism. 
Ramsamy, in particular, has devoted his life to the anti-apartheid sports 
movement. The South Africans were excited about the unprecedented meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, apartheid was singled out as the biggest problem. Another was the 
IOC's concern about lack of unity among South African sporting bodies. In some 
sports, there are five or six governing bodies. The IOC, through Ramsamy, told 
the SANOC to unify its sports bodies under one umbrella and get rid of any 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
The South Africans came away from the 5 1/2-hour meeting excited about the 
future for the first time in decades. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the first time we had concrete suggestions," Johan du Plessis said. "We 
didn't talk about politics. We talked about sports. We know what we have to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Some sports administrators here are angry at what they see as the IOC's 
selective boycott of South Africa. Ray Moore of the South African Tennis Union 
said: "Listen, in 1980 the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, and the IOC saw fit to 
hold the Games in the capital city of the invading nation. Where is the line of 
demarcation? Is there a set of standards for Africa?" Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to go into human rights in Africa . . . most of the countries in 
Africa are governed in tyranny. They have dictators. You have people who have 
sworn themselves into a presidency or as king for life. Ethiopia . . . what is 
happening in Ethiopia is unbelievable. And Uganda. They are in the Olympics. 
They are a respected member of the IOC. This was during a time when Africa was 
becoming more powerful internationally. They could turn the whole thing the way 
they wanted it to turn." 
</P>
<P>
In their excitement about the opening of a dialogue with the IOC, South African 
officials are overlooking other signs. Last month Samaranch was asked about the 
possibility of South Africa being readmitted in time for the 1992 Olympics. 
Samaranch said it would not be possible. And the African nations are no less 
militant regarding their neighbor to the south. 
</P>
<P>
Rise like Lions after slumber 
</P>
<P>
In unvanquishable number -- 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Ye are many -- they are few. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Percy Bysshe Shelley, The Mask of Anarchy 
</P>
<P>
Despite political changes and some historic talks with the IOC, South Africa is 
no nearer to being readmitted to the international sports community. And while 
some officials in South Africa are optimistic, others note that only a month 
ago, Samaranch rejected the notion that South Africa would be back in the IOC. 
He called the changes "cosmetic." 
</P>
<P>
Said Momberg: "I'm very negative about being readmitted before South Africa 
becomes an independent, non-racial democracy. We've done a lot in certain areas 
to integrate, but then we have segregated schools. I would be most amazed if 
the people in the Olympic movement, after so many years of successfully 
pressuring South Africa, would give up and say, 'Come back, all is forgiven.' " 
</P>
<P>
One likely scenario for South Africa is for sports to be recognized piecemeal, 
federation by federation. The IAAF could allow the South African track 
federation back, for example, the international governing body for swimming 
could recognize South Africa's federation, and so on. In this way, South 
Africans may compete internationally before they compete as a team in the 
Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa has its friends within the IOC, proof enough that its years of 
lobbying have not gone to waste. But others have read the IOC charter and see 
no allowance for a country where apartheid is still the law. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all held hostage by apartheid -- the black athletes in South Africa, 
the white athletes in South Africa," said Anita De Frantz, a U.S. 
representative on the IOC. "The black and white athletes in the rest of the 
world are held hostage by that system. That's why it must be dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
"Our charter says you cannot discriminate. I don't know if it's politics and 
sports not linking, but it's part of the rule of the Olympic movement. While it 
may look to the rest of the world as politics and sport, it's our charter, it's 
our document describing what it takes to be a part of the Olympic family that 
prohibits them from being a part. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the rejoinder is, 'Well, what about places where there are human 
rights violations?' Yes. But this is a country that openly, notoriously, says 
that on the basis of the color of your skin, your rights are different. It's 
just so clear. I use the word open and notorious -- there's just no mistake." 
</P>
<P>
This, then, is the rope South Africa clings to. Its end is in the isolation of 
home; the other is in the freedom abroad. South Africa's inability to pull the 
rope, or to allow itself to be tugged, has kept this athletic landscape static. 
</P>
<P>
"We have done all we can do," they say to the world. "Let others compromise." 
</P>
<P>
While black and white athletes clamor to break free of the borders of South 
Africa's exile, sports officials are held hostage by politicians who are held 
hostage by apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
And so South Africa remains, clenching its fist and stamping a tiny foot 
against the world.

Isiah Thomas sank three of his five three-point baskets down the stretch as the 
Detroit Pistons beat the New York Knicks, 104-97, for their 12th consecutive 
NBA playoff victory and a 2-0 lead in their Eastern Conference series Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a big-game player," Detroit Coach Chuck Daly said. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed that kind of outside shooting." 
</P>
<P>
The series shifts to Madison Square Garden for Game 3 Saturday and Game 4 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The game was tied, 92-92, with 6:36 remaining, but Thomas made two three-point 
shots and Joe Dumars sank a free throw to put Detroit ahead, 99-94, with 4:27 
left. Thomas hit another three-point shot with 1:03 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a case of me trying to break open a big game," Thomas said. "It was 
really the only shot I had. They had great defense. You have to give them 
credit." 
</P>
<P>
The defending champions, bidding to become only the third franchise to repeat 
as NBA champions, need one victory to match the Lakers' record for consecutive 
playoff wins set last year. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas had 23 points and James Edwards scored 32 for Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Wilkins of the Knicks, held to one-of-13 shooting in the Pistons' 112-77 
victory in the first game, scored 24 points. Charles Oakley had 22 and Patrick 
Ewing added 20 for New York. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth consecutive game the Pistons held the opposition under 100 
points. Detroit has held playoff opponents under 100 in 20 of 22 games.

Michael Zanoli of the Netherlands won the 10th stage of the Tour de Trump on 
Thursday and Soviet amateur Vladislav Bobrik retained his overall lead for the 
fifth consecutive day. 
</P>
<P>
Three riders were injured in a four-bike crash about 50 miles into Thursday's 
120.5-mile Stroudsburg to New Paltz Road Race, none seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Zanoli, 22, who resides in Boulder, Colo., came out of a group of four riders 
about 30 miles from the finish and outsprinted Ron Kiefel, also of Boulder, 
Colo., by about two feet for the stage victory. Kiefel's finish moved him into 
fourth place overall. 
</P>
<P>
Bobrik, 19, has worn the leader's jersey since last Saturday after winning the 
third stage, the Fredericksburg to Richmond Road Race. 
</P>
<P>
After finishing 11th Thursday in 5:21:19, Bobrik leads Mexico's Raul Alcala by 
1:27 and Atle Kvalsvoll of Norway by 2:10 with three stages in the 1,107-mile 
race remaining.

Jari Kurri's record-tying playoff goal late in the second period carried the 
Edmonton Oilers to a 4-3 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks Thursday night and 
to within one game of the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers have a 3-2 lead and can wrap up the best-of-seven Campbell 
Conference series Saturday night in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Awaiting the winner in the NHL championship series are the Boston Bruins, the 
Wales Conference champions who recently completed a sweep of the Washington 
Capitals. 
</P>
<P>
Kurri, who has four Stanley Cup rings, broke a 3-3 tie with a power-play goal 
at 18:29 of the second period after the Blackhawks rallied to tie the score on 
goals by Trent Yawney and Denis Savard. 
</P>
<P>
Kurri, taking a pass from Mark Messier, put the puck past Chicago goalie 
Jacques Cloutier, making his first start in the playoffs. That was Kurri's 89th 
goal, tying former teammate Wayne Gretzky, on the all-time playoff list. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers took a 1-0 lead at 2:08 of the first period on a goal by Randy 
Gregg, who beat Cloutier from in front after taking a pass from Joe Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Simpson made it 2-0 when he tipped in a shot from inside the blue line by 
Reijo Ruotsalainen at 12:25 while the Oilers were on the power play. The goal 
was Simpson's 11th of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Konroyd cut the Oilers' lead to 2-1 when he redirected a pass by Steve 
Larmer into the lower left circle at 14:14. 
</P>
<P>
But the Oilers responded with a goal 18 seconds later when Adam Graves hit a 
wraparound shot that bounced off the post into the net. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago tied it, 3-3, on consecutive goals by Yawney and Savard in the second 
period.

Fred Couples was quick to admit that "a lot of luck was involved" in a

<P>
His was the only sub-par round of the wet, cold, windy day when the average

Winds gusted to 40 m.p.h. and caused a wind-chill factor in the 30s. Some rain

<P>
The Pittsburgh Pirates entered Thursday night's game against the Cincinnati 
Reds with a five-game winning streak and an unbeaten bullpen that had a 1.55 
earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
The streak ended and the ERA ballooned when the Reds launched an eight-run, 
eighth-inning rally in a 10-4 victory at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Joe Oliver hit a three-run home run, and Paul O'Neill had a sacrifice 
fly and two-run single in the eighth as the Reds improved to 13-3 on the road 
and raised their National League West lead to seven games over the Dodgers. The 
East-leading Pirates lost for the fourth time in the past 19 games and lead the 
Montreal Expos by 2 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Pirate reliever Ted Power (0-1), who was previously unscored upon in 13 
innings, saw his ERA jump to 3.38 by giving up six hits and six runs in the 
eighth. 
</P>
<P>
With the score, 2-2, after seven innings, Barry Larkin doubled, Todd Benzinger 
tripled and O'Neill hit a sacrifice fly off Power to make it 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
Mariano Duncan and Billy Hatcher singled, Oliver homered and Norm Charlton 
(1-0) beat out an infield hit to chase Power, who is 0-4 in four appearances 
against the Reds in his career. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Kipper, making his first appearance after elbow surgery, retired Chris Sabo 
on a groundout before Herm Winningham singled and Larkin walked to load the 
bases. Shortstop Jay Bell committed a error on a grounder by Benzinger allowing 
Charlton to score, and O'Neill's two-run single capped the inning. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 9, St. Louis 1 -- Roberto Alomar raised his average to .358 with two 
doubles and two singles at St. Louis, and the Padres handed the Cardinals their 
sixth loss in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Alomar has batted .458 while hitting safely in 11 of his last 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
Garry Templeton and Bip Roberts each hit two-run homers to back Dennis 
Rasmussen (3-1), who scattered seven hits. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Magrane (0-6) lost for the eighth consecutive time in 13 starts since Aug. 
29. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Zeile hit his third homer for the Cardinals, who have scored three or 
fewer runs in seven of their last eight. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 6, Texas 2 -- Bo Jackson's three-run homer off the right-field foul 
pole keyed a six-run eighth inning at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's homer off reliever Gary Mielke was his second of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Montgomery (3-1) pitched 2 2/3 hitless innings after relieving starter Tom 
Gordon, who gave up two runs on six hits. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Brown (5-1), who had a six-hit shutout after seven innings, suffered his 
first loss. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 10, Toronto 5 -- Temperatures were in the 30s and there were occasional 
snow showers at Detroit, but Cecil Fielder continued to swing a hot bat for the 
Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder had three hits, including his major league-leading 13th home run, and 
drove in three runs as the Tigers beat Todd Stottlemyre (4-3), who had won four 
consecutive decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Mookie Wilson homered for the Blue Jays, and Larry Sheets homered for the 
Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Robinson (2-3) gave up five runs and seven hits in 6 1/3 innings for the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 3 Cleveland 2 -- Gary Gaetti's two-run double at Minneapolis capped a 
three-run sixth inning that gave the Twins their seventh victory in eight 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Smith (1-3) got the victory, giving up six hits in 6 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Aguilera pitched two scoreless innings for his seventh save. 
</P>

Nineteen years after he first went to a pro football training camp, eight years 
after his Raider debut and four years after retiring, Lyle Alzado is back. 
</P>
<P>
Alzado, 41, announced Thursday that he will attempt a comeback with the 
Raiders, hoping to recapture both his own glory and that of his team. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a violent game," Alzado said. "I miss the violence. It's just that 
simple." 
</P>
<P>
Despite a yearlong training program, the 270-pound Alzado figures to face a 
grueling battle to make it through training camp against players 20 years 
younger. 
</P>
<P>
"I know to make it, I have to dominate on the field," he said. "I intend to do 
that. 
</P>
<P>
"If they call me in at camp and tell me it's not working out, I could handle 
it. My ego is not that bad. If they say goodby, I'll say goodby. But I think 
I'll do it." STEVE SPRINGER

U.S. PROTESTS VOTE TACTICS IN ROMANIA, RECALLS ENVOY

<P>
The Bush Administration called home the U.S. ambassador to Romania on Thursday 
to protest intimidation of opposition candidates and other irregularities that 
have marred the campaign for the country's first multi-party election in more 
than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Margaret Tutwiler said Ambassador Alan Green Jr. was 
recalled for consultations as "a public signal of our concern." 
</P>
<P>
But she said Green's stay in Washington would be short and that he would return 
to Bucharest before the May 20 election. 
</P>
<P>
"This decision has been taken in light of the reports of irregularities in the 
Romanian electoral process which raise questions about whether those elections 
will be free and fair," Tutwiler said. 
</P>
<P>
In Bucharest, Prime Minister Petre Roman accused opposition candidates of 
claiming electoral fraud because they realize that they have no chance of 
defeating interim President Ion Iliescu. 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats in the Romanian capital said last week that the election 
would be "ragged," but not bad enough to require the postponement that 
opposition parties have demanded. 
</P>
<P>
"Among the electoral problems which concern us is the incidence of organized 
acts of intimidation and harassment directed against some opposition parties 
and candidates," Tutwiler said. "We are also concerned about complaints that 
several major parties still encounter obstacles in obtaining their fair share 
of broadcast time on the publicly controlled radio and television and in 
distributing their campaign literature through the mail, as well as problems 
with distributing independent newspapers." 
</P>
<P>
The two leading opposition parties, the National Peasants Party and the Liberal 
Party, have complained bitterly that the National Salvation Front, which 
controls the interim government that replaced executed dictator Nicolae 
Ceausescu, has blocked their access to radio, television and the mails. 
</P>
<P>
Liberal Party presidential candidate Radu Campeanu was attacked Saturday by 
about 40 toughs armed with rocks, bricks and bottles. Green, the U.S. 
ambassador, issued a statement at that time condemning "all acts of 
intimidation and violence." 
</P>
<P>
One Western diplomatic source, who spoke on condition that he not be 
identified, said it is difficult even for informed observers to tell whether 
the restricted press access and late mail distributions suffered by the 
National Salvation Front's political rivals are intentional or simply failures 
of a chaotic and underdeveloped system. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats added that they have seen no evidence of direct front involvement in 
incidents of harassment claimed by opposition parties. But they said the 
reports are frequent and consistent enough to give cause for concern. 
</P>
<P>
Adrian Nastase, a leading front figure responsible for foreign relations, has 
denied that the party has in any way obstructed its political opponents. He 
conceded that numerous incidents of harassment had occurred, but attributed 
them to rural extremists outside the control of any political party. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomats blamed the incidents in the provinces on former Communists and 
secret police agents who fear harsh retribution if any political force other 
than the front should get into power. 
</P>
<P>
The British news agency Reuters reported that a poll published by the 
state-funded Romanian Opinion Poll Institute indicated that Iliescu would be 
elected president by a sweeping majority with 69.3% of the vote. It showed 
12.9% for Campeanu and 6.4% for National Peasants Party candidate Ion Ratiu. 
</P>
<P>
Campeanu and Ratiu said Wednesday that they would pull out of the election if 
Iliescu did the same. They accuse him of links with Ceausescu's hard-line 
Communist regime and of attempting to hijack Romanian politics. 
</P>
<P>
Roman, the prime minister appointed by Iliescu, said Thursday that Campeanu and 
Ratiu were saying, in effect: "I have no chance of winning so I'll withdraw." 
He said that such a decision should be left to the electorate. 
</P>

Times staff writer Carol J. Williams, in Bucharest, contributed to this story.

HOUSE APPROVES UNPAID-LEAVE BILL; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS: WORKERS WOULD BE GRANTED UP TO 12 WEEKS A YEAR FOR FAMILY AND MEDICAL 
REASONS. THE 237-187 VOTE INDICATES THAT A THREATENED BUSH VETO WOULD BE 
UPHELD.

<P>
Despite a presidential veto threat, the House approved landmark legislation 
Thursday that would require large employers to grant workers unpaid leave to 
care for newborn babies and seriously ill family members or to recover from 
sickness. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which now goes to the Senate, was passed by a larger-than-expected 
margin of 237 to 187, but fell far short of the two-thirds majority required to 
override a veto. A total of 198 Democrats and 39 Republicans voted for it, and 
133 Republicans and 54 Democrats opposed the bill. 
</P>
<P>
It would require firms with 50 or more workers, as well as state and local 
governments, to allow workers to take as many as 12 weeks of unpaid leave a 
year for specified medical or family reasons, including the adoption of a 
child. Employers would have to continue health benefits during the leave and 
guarantee that the workers would get their jobs -- or equivalent jobs -- back. 
Federal employees would be entitled to longer leave periods under the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates said the measure is the first breakthrough in the five years they 
have been attempting to pass a law that recognizes the vast increases in the 
labor force of mothers with small children and families with two wage earners. 
</P>
<P>
"You shouldn't have to decide not to have a child because you don't want to 
lose your job," said Rep. Lynn Martin (R-Ill.). 
</P>
<P>
Opponents, however, contended that the bill would increase costs to employers 
and set a bad precedent for government intervention in setting job conditions 
that might reduce other benefits now enjoyed by employees. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a solution in search of a problem," contended Rep. Fred Grandy 
(R-Iowa), floor manager of the opposition forces. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents relied on government figures that showed nearly three-fourths of 
married women with school-age children work, as do more than half of all 
mothers with preschool children. They also noted a Government Accounting Office 
study that said the unpaid leave requirement would pose only a minimal cost to 
employers. 
</P>
<P>
"Family leave is a basic necessity," said Rep. Marge Roukema (R-N.J.), a key 
architect of the bipartisan compromise that sailed through the House despite 
strong opposition from organized business. "It's a bedrock family issue." 
</P>
<P>
The bill also provides unpaid leave to care for adult family members, which 
supporters said is crucial for the growing number of families with elderly 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the setback in the House, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National 
Federation of Independent Business vowed to continue their fight against the 
bill in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Cass Ballenger (R-N.C.), a business owner, said the legislation would 
force many businesses to pay overtime to cover the absent worker. Rep. Steve 
Bartlett (R-Tex.) called the legislation "a yuppie bill," saying that only 
professionals could afford to take 12 weeks unpaid leave. 
</P>
<P>
White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu told business lobbyists Monday that 
President Bush would veto the family leave bill. Secretary of Labor Elizabeth 
Hanford Dole tried this week to persuade House Republicans to support Bush and 
oppose the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Alixe Glen, a deputy White House press secretary, said that Bush 
is holding fast to his position. The President, she said, believes that 
flexible family leave "should not be dictated by a Washington mandate." 
</P>
<P>
Roukema, however, said she and other GOP backers of the measure would try to 
see Bush and ask him, "as a sincere and compassionate grandfather," to sign the 
legislation to help working families. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Bill Green, a liberal Republican from New York, quoted from remarks Bush 
made as a presidential candidate: 
</P>
<P>
" 'We need to assure that women don't have to worry about getting their jobs 
back after having a child or caring for a child during a serious illness. That 
is what I mean when I talk about a gentler nation,' " Green quoted Bush as 
saying in September, 1988. Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) said Bush has 
heard from only one side in the dispute and might change his mind once he hears 
from supporters of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"The message today is that you can't talk kinder and gentler and vote for 
corporate interests," Schroeder told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder's original bill required longer maximum periods of leave and applied 
to smaller firms. It was put aside in favor of a less generous bill 
co-sponsored by Rep. Bart Gordon (D-Tenn.) and Rep. Curt Weldon (R-Pa.) to 
guarantee House passage. 
</P>
<P>
The substitute bill limited coverage to firms with 50 or more employees -- thus 
exempting 95% of the smallest businesses but still covering 44% of the work 
force. It also reduced the total amount of unpaid family or medical leave an 
employer would be required to provide and would insist on a doctor's 
certificate -- rather than a statement by a nurse or other medical practitioner 
-- that an employee is seriously ill. 
</P>
<P>
Like the original bill, the substitute would allow federal employees to take as 
much as 26 weeks of unpaid medical leave each year and as much as 18 weeks of 
family leave every two years. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic leadership in the House -- working closely with a group of 
moderate Republicans -- put on a major drive for the modified family leave 
legislation. Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) broke with precedent to endorse 
it before it came to the floor for a vote. Rep. Norman Y. Mineta (D-San Jose) 
led a group of 99 Democratic whips assigned to push for the measure's passage. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the bill said they anticipated a narrow margin of victory -- by 
10 votes or so -- and were pleased to rack up a 50-vote margin on final 
passage. 
</P>
<P>
One unexpected backer was Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.), usually a major voice 
for conservative opinion in the House. 
</P>
<P>
"Society should have a policy of encouraging motherhood and not encouraging 
abortion," Hyde said. "This (bill) does not involve apple pie and motherhood, 
but it does involve motherhood." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-Ga.), a Southern conservative, also voted for the measure 
and told his colleagues: "Have we abandoned those people who work every day of 
their lives, paying taxes, asking nothing more than decency?" 
</P>
<P>
In a preliminary test of strength, the Gordon-Weldon compromise was adopted by 
an overwhelming vote of 259 to 157, including 212 Democrats and 47 Republicans. 
But when the same legislation came up for final approval a short time later, 
the margin of approval shrank to 237 to 187 as lawmakers switched sides for 
reasons that remain unclear. 
</P>
<P>
In the California delegation, for example, all Democrats voted for the family 
leave bill. Republicans who voted on the first round all opposed it, except for 
Rep. Charles Pashayan Jr. (R-Fresno). But on the final vote he switched and 
voted against the bill. In contrast, Rep. Tom Campbell (R-Palo Alto) voted 
against the substitute amendment but later voted in favor of its passage. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands) was the only member of the California delegation 
who did not vote.

2 INDICTED IN HAULING OF TOXIC WASTE TO MEXICO; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: CHARGES ARE THE FIRST UNDER A FEDERAL LAW INVOLVING SMUGGLING OF 
HAZARDOUS MATERIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN and LARRY B. STAMMER, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal, state and Los Angeles County law enforcement officials announced 
Thursday the first federal felony indictment under an environmental law in a 
case involving the smuggling of toxic wastes from California into Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Citing growing trafficking of hazardous garbage from California across the 
border, the officials also announced the creation of a new multi-agency task 
force intended to remove jurisdictional problems that have hampered such 
smuggling investigations in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of types of crime that have gone global -- white collar crime, 
terrorism and drugs, just to name a few," said William Stollhans, assistant 
special agent in charge of enforcing environmental laws for the FBI. "The 
indictment today is an example of where environmental crimes have now gone 
international. They know no international boundaries." 
</P>
<P>
The indictment charges that Raymond Franco, 57, a licensed waste hauler from El 
Toro, accepted money from California businesses to take their wastes to legal 
landfills or recycling facilities. But instead of going to the designated 
sites, the indictment says, Franco and an accomplice, David Torres, 39, of 
Huntington Park, loaded drums of the dangerous materials into enclosed trucks 
destined for Mexico, concealing the barrels under cardboard and wood and 
surrounding them with empty drums. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the dangerous material allegedly was dumped at a Tijuana warehouse 
owned by Torres, and investigators fear some of the barrels later may have been 
used by nearby residents to store water. Prosecutors said the government of 
Mexico cooperated fully in the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
Among the firms whose waste ended up in Tijuana was Barmet Aluminum Corp. of 
Torrance, which paid Franco a total of $12,000 in 1988 to haul 57 drums of 
hazardous material to a treatment facility and a licensed hazardous-waste 
landfill, according to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Had the material actually gone to a legal landfill, the cost would have 
approached $28,000, more than twice as much as the firm paid Franco, 
investigators said. The division manager of the Torrance facility, which was 
not charged, said the company trusted Franco to dispose of the material 
lawfully. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, The Times reported that increasingly strict environmental laws 
and the escalating costs of legal disposal are prodding more and more hazardous 
waste generators in Southern California to send their toxic garbage illegally 
into Mexico, where it is dumped or used in industrial processing. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment announced Thursday marked the first time transporters of 
hazardous waste have been charged with illegal smuggling under the U.S. 
Resource and Conservation Recovery Act, which prohibits, among other things, 
disposing of hazardous waste without a permit. 
</P>
<P>
In a similar case in 1986, three Americans were indicted by a federal grand 
jury in San Diego for falsifying shipping documents. That case was filed under 
federal mail fraud statutes. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that California law enforcement officers have in fact 
witnessed the unlawful smuggling of toxic waste into Mexico and have documented 
it," said William Carter, a Los Angeles County deputy district attorney who 
helped investigate the case. "This is just one set of players out of dozens who 
are out there operating in similar fashion. We just have to take them one set 
at a time." 
</P>
<P>
In a separate case stemming from the Franco investigation, the federal grand 
jury also indicted Laminating Co. of America, a Garden Grove firm, accusing it 
of conspiracy to dispose of and transport hazardous waste and 46 counts of 
illegal transportation and disposal of toxic waste -- all within Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Rex Scatena, an attorney for Laminating, said the company is "an old, 
family-run business." He said he had not yet seen the indictment, but he 
defended the firm. 
</P>
<P>
"They have all the necessary permits to dispose of and handle the materials 
they use there," Scatena said. 
</P>
<P>
Franco, who authorities said disappeared from his Orange County home a year 
ago, was arrested in New York on Wednesday. He was arraigned before a federal 
magistrate in Brooklyn on Thursday and was held pending a bail hearing today. 
Authorities said they were planning to summon Torres to appear before a federal 
magistrate in Los Angeles. Torres is believed to be cooperating with 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Franco and Torres could not be reached for comment, but a woman who identified 
herself as Franco's wife said her husband is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
Reached by telephone at the couple's El Toro home, the sobbing woman said, "He 
did nothing wrong. . . . He is a good person." 
</P>
<P>
Franco was charged with one count of conspiracy, seven counts of illegal 
transportation and disposal of hazardous waste and one count of illegal export 
of hazardous waste to Mexico. Torres was charged with one count of conspiracy, 
six counts of illegal transportation and disposal of hazardous waste and one 
count of illegal export of hazardous waste to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Franco faces a maximum sentence of 32 years in prison and a fine 
of $250,000 on each count. Torres faces a maximum of 27 years in custody, and a 
fine of $250,000 for each count. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said they placed Franco under surveillance in 1988 after he was 
identified as a possible suspect during routine monitoring by county health 
department officials of local waste generating companies. 
</P>
<P>
While under surveillance in October, 1988, Franco and Torres met at Laminating 
Co. of America in Garden Grove and loaded 16 drums of hazardous waste onto two 
trucks. Torres headed north in his truck but investigators lost track of him 
before he made any stops. 
</P>
<P>
The other truck, driven by a Mexican national, headed to the border, 
investigators said. The CHP stopped the vehicle before it reached the border 
and the driver was arrested and subsequently prosecuted by Orange County 
authorities for illegally transporting hazardous waste, according to Los 
Angeles County investigators. The man served jail time and eventually returned 
to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
As undercover investigators continued to watch Franco, prosecutors said, they 
saw repeated illegal activities at Laminating Co. According to the indictment, 
the firm's employees were seen on several occasions illegally disposing of 
hazardous wastes in trash bins destined for a municipal landfill in the city of 
Orange. Franco also was seen dumping hazardous materials into an ordinary trash 
bin. 
</P>
<P>
The waste, eventually picked up by the municipal garbage company and taken to 
Santiago Landfill, should have been put into special containers and taken to a 
licensed hazardous waste facility. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Barmet Aluminum Corp. notified the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency that hazardous waste facilities where Franco and Torres were 
supposed to have taken Barmet's materials had not, in fact, received them. The 
corporation, based in Ohio, has aluminum recycling plants across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy (Franco) did something wrong," said Jorge Eulloqui, division manager 
of the corporation's Torrance facility. "We trusted him, we hired him under 
good conscience and he defrauded our company." 
</P>
<P>
Eulloqui, who said his plant budgets about $50,000 a year for the treatment, 
recycling and disposal of hazardous waste, said the company employee who 
contracted with Franco is no longer with the firm. Eulloqui said he does not 
believe that the former employee suspected anything was amiss even though the 
fees paid to Franco were unusually low for legal disposal. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County and federal prosecutors, who announced the filing of the 
indictments at a news conference in Los Angeles, said they hope they will deter 
illegal dumping in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"Companies realize it's cheaper to pollute than to dispose of hazardous 
material properly," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Adam B. Schiff, who is helping to 
prosecute the cases. "We hope the announcement of the indictments and the task 
force will impress individuals that the calculus is changing dramatically, that 
the costs are going up dramatically." 
</P>
<P>
The new environmental task force will include representatives of the FBI, the 
EPA, the U.S. Department of Transportation, the California Highway Patrol and 
the California Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said halting waste trafficking into Mexico will be a top priority of 
the task force, which will have jurisdiction over much of Southern California. 
Previously, law enforcement investigators told The Times that little was being 
done to stop toxic waste smugglers because of jurisdictional problems and lack 
of adequate staffing. Officials from the various agencies pledged Thursday to 
provide enough resources to give the task force muscle. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be as diligent at the border in stopping those poisons that are 
going south as we are in trying to stop the drugs that are coming north," said 
Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner. "In both cases, it comes back to 
haunt us." 
</P>
<P>
Reiner said crops imported from Mexico may be contaminated by toxic ground 
water and poisons that have been dumped in Mexican rivers. 
</P>
<P>
State officials also have worried that toxic waste dumped by Americans in 
Mexico is contributing to contamination in California. An internal state 
government memo obtained Thursday by The Times warned a year ago that the 
illegal disposal of hazardous waste in Mexico posed ground water contamination 
and air pollution threats not only to Mexico, but also to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The May 30, 1989, memo to state Health Director Kenneth W. Kizer said the 
potential for environmental problems "appears to be extreme," both from the 
illicit trafficking of hazardous waste into Mexico, and from waste generated in 
Mexico by American-owned factories along the border.

3 BALTIC STATES FORM ALLIANCE FOR AGRICULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Soviet Union's three Baltic republics, frustrated so far in their efforts 
to secede and re-establish their independence, Thursday took the first concrete 
step toward forming a united front to battle Moscow together. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with the Kremlin's three-week-old partial economic blockade of Lithuania 
and its threats of similar measures against Estonia and Latvia, the nationalist 
governments in the three republics created a common market in agricultural 
produce and in farming equipment and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Although part of a program for the economic integration of the three republics 
on the basis of market forces and private entrepreneurship rather than on 
central planning and state ownership, the move was immediately portrayed as a 
strengthening of their solidarity in the face of increasing pressure from 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Estonia urged Latvia and Lithuania to go further and revive the Council of 
Baltic States, which operated in the 1930s before World War II, to promote 
political coordination as well as economic integration. 
</P>
<P>
Estonian President Arnold Ruutel invited President Vytautas Landsbergis of 
Lithuania and President Anatolijs Gorbunovs of Latvia to Tallinn, the Estonian 
capital, for weekend discussions on a coordinated strategy. 
</P>
<P>
The Council of Baltic States, which would comprise the presidents, prime 
ministers and foreign ministers of the three republics, would attempt to work 
out joint but non-binding positions on a variety of issues, according to 
Estonian officials. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuanian and Latvian officials said their governments are studying the 
Estonian proposal. The agricultural agreement, while originally part of a 
Kremlin-approved program of the decentralization and reform of the whole Soviet 
economy, took on a distinct political coloration as a result of Moscow's 
efforts to squeeze Lithuania into submission through increasing economic 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
While Lithuania is largely self-sufficient in food, as are Latvia and Estonia, 
the creation of what is intended to become a regional free market is a 
significant step toward economic independence after 45 years of incorporation 
in the Soviet Union's long-stagnant economy. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the republics will have representatives in the others, according to the 
official Soviet news agency Tass, and they will "function as coordinators and 
assistants in joint efforts to resolve agricultural issues" as the three small 
states face increasing pressure from Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Official figures released Thursday by the Lithuanian government put the cost so 
far of Moscow's sanctions at nearly $32 million; more than 23,000 people are 
unemployed as a result, the government added. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has demanded that Lithuania rescind its 
declaration of independence, or at least "freeze" its implementation, and 
negotiate its secession on the basis of the Soviet constitution and 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
When Lithuania refused, Gorbachev curtailed deliveries of oil, gas and other 
raw materials. He is now threatening to take similar action against Estonia and 
Latvia, although those republics decided on more cautious, step-by-step 
approaches to independence. 
</P>
<P>
Algirdas Brazauskas, Lithuania's deputy prime minister and the leader of its 
independent Communist Party, said he doubted whether Lithuania could hold out 
against the central government's sanctions for more than four or five more 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"More factories could close very quickly, and the government might face 
pressure from the people as the stranglehold tightens," he said during a visit 
to Switzerland, where he was trying to gather support for Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian government, continuing to loosen its ties with the Soviet Union, 
formally asserted its control of television and radio broadcasting in the 
republic Thursday. The Lithuanian Supreme Council, the republic's Parliament, 
adopted legislation assuming responsibility for all broadcasting, which had 
always been under centralized control. 
</P>
<P>
The new law requires radio and television to abide by Lithuanian rather than 
Soviet regulations and legislation, and to reflect the viewpoints of 
Lithuania's residents. 
</P>
<P>
In Paris, French President Francois Mitterrand met with Kazimiera Prunskiene, 
the Lithuanian prime minister, and renewed his call for negotiations to resolve 
the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"I see no other solution than the opening of a real dialogue and talks at an 
institutional level," Mitterrand told her, according to Hubert Vedrine, his 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand had jointly proposed with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl that 
Lithuania suspend measures linked with its March declaration of independence in 
order to facilitate a dialogue with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lithuania offered to suspend some of the legislation, Landsbergis said 
the declaration of independence stood and would not be withdrawn or 
reconsidered. Gorbachev welcomed the Franco-German initiative, but has 
continued to insist that negotiations be carried out solely on the basis of the 
Soviet constitution and legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"We will do everything in our power to avoid a deterioration of the situation," 
Vedrine added, noting that Paris is in regular contact with Moscow about the 
crisis.

MURDOCK WILL QUIT JOFFREY, CO-CHAIR SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERARD GARZA and JOHN HENKEN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Murdock, the prominent businessman and multimillionaire who was 
instrumental in the Joffrey Ballet's adopting Los Angeles as a second home in 
1983, has submitted a letter of resignation from the board of the troubled 
company, according to a fellow board member. 
</P>
<P>
Murdock was unavailable for comment, but Anthony Bliss, who served as 
co-chairman with Murdock, said he was told by a Joffrey staff member that 
Murdock's resignation letter was at the ballet's office at the Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
The company has been in turmoil since last week, when Joffrey co-founder and 
artistic director Gerald Arpino submitted his resignation on the eve of the 
company's first performance of the spring season at the Dorothy Chandler 
Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Arpino resigned because of a board reorganization, which he claims stripped his 
authority. His attorney subsequently advised the company to refrain from 
performing Arpino's works, claiming that the choreographer owns the rights to 
his ballets. 
</P>
<P>
The company is also suffering from severe financial problems, with a deficit 
approaching $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Murdock's resignation would be significant, because he has been a major donor 
to the company and reportedly offered to lead the effort to erase the Joffrey's 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, (the company) is in jeopardy," Bliss said from his New York home 
Thursday night. "One of the main problems has been getting people together to 
talk. And this has all made it difficult to raise funds. 
</P>
<P>
"We all hope it will be settled, that everybody would agree on the problems and 
agree to conquer them." 
</P>
<P>
Bliss said such an agreement, in his opinion, would include Arpino's return to 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
The embattled Joffrey received yet another blow Thursday when Cal Performances, 
the presenting organization at UC Berkeley, canceled the company's scheduled 
July 17-29 engagement. 
</P>
<P>
Paulette Wamego, a spokeswoman for Cal Performances, said negotiations for a 
final contract were terminated as a result of the resignation of Arpino. 
</P>
<P>
Wamego said the Berkeley contract rested on Arpino's personal appearance at 
Berkeley and the inclusion of his works on four of the six scheduled programs. 
The company was scheduled for 14 performances in the 2,000-seat Zellerbach 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Davis, the Joffrey's West Coast manager, tried to minimize the Berkeley 
situation Thursday. "Nothing is final. We're trying to work something out right 
now and we'll be talking to Berkeley tomorrow," she said. "I don't have a sense 
of why this happened. I think we'll be able to get something settled." 
</P>
<P>
The Joffrey board is scheduled to meet this morning in a continuing effort to 
resolve the dispute with Arpino.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS GOVERNOR;

<P>
DEMOCRATS SPAR OVER FINANCES, WASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Limbering up for the first head-to-head weekend debate, John K. Van de Kamp and 
Dianne Feinstein traded barbs on personal finances and toxic waste Thursday 
that had each accusing the other of failing to live up to their 
responsibilities to Californians. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general, in particular, spared no niceties in raising questions 
about Feinstein -- questions to which he admitted he did not have any answers. 
His opportunity came during a question-and-answer session at the Los Angeles 
World Affairs Council breakfast, when an audience member asked what he thought 
about the loan of more than $1 million to Feinstein's campaign by her husband, 
investment banker Richard Blum. 
</P>
<P>
"It does raise a very interesting point," said Van de Kamp. "Who is behind that 
money? Where did that money come from? What is she influenced by?" 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters later, Van de Kamp said it was Feinstein's responsibility 
to make a "full disclosure" of her husband's clients and added that her 
personal wealth created "an imbalance, an inequity" in the governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Van de Kamp cited Blum's representation of some insurance 
companies, and suggested that was responsible for Feinstein's 1988 support of 
an auto insurance initiative sponsored by the industry. Blum has released a 
list of his corporate clients but has not released the names of individuals 
whose investments he manages. 
</P>
<P>
Hours later at a press conference she called to chide Van de Kamp for his 
treatment of toxic waste disposal cases, Feinstein issued a strong denial that 
her husband's finances had in any way influenced her political positions. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing in my husband's background, foreground, past or future that's 
going to influence me," she said. "Anybody who knows me knows I'm going to make 
up my own mind. Additionally, my husband has never tried to influence me. . . . 
He's ethical. He's moral. He's got a basic integrity and credibility." 
</P>
<P>
The former San Francisco mayor termed Van de Kamp's insinuations "baloney." She 
refused, however, to release a list of her husband's individual clients on the 
grounds that to do so would cost him business. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein and her husband, in tax returns released last month, reported earning 
nearly $7.4 million in 1989, in what Blum described as the best year of his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to reminding voters of Feinstein's wealth, Van de Kamp appeared to 
be trying to cast doubt on her integrity. And Feinstein, too, appeared to be 
playing to a deeper agenda -- cleaving environmental support from Van de Kamp 
by criticizing his handling of toxic waste issues. 
</P>
<P>
Standing in front of an abandoned North Hollywood plating company, Feinstein 
said that as chief law enforcement officer of the state, the attorney general 
has been apathetic about enforcing toxic dumping regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, Feinstein disclosed that she sent a letter to Van de Kamp 
pressing for an investigation of the North Hollywood firm's apparent dumping of 
50 drums of cyanide. The 55-gallon barrels were supposed to have been sent to 
Mexicali; the address on the bill of lading was actually a wheat field there, 
Feinstein said. An inspection of the field turned up no such barrels, and their 
present location is not known. 
</P>
<P>
"What I am suggesting is 'Get with it,' " she said in comments directed at Van 
de Kamp during the North Hollywood press conference. "We've got fifty 55-gallon 
drums of deadly cyanide out there somewhere. Let's find it. Let's see that it 
is properly disposed of." 
</P>
<P>
Repeatedly, Feinstein referred to Van de Kamp as the "environmental czar" -- a 
dig at the attorney general, who helped write the so-called "Big Green" 
initiative that calls for an elected environmental officer for the state. She 
said the description was legitimate because Van de Kamp has authority over the 
legal jurisdictions in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp said his opponent was simply wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Feinstein does not know too much about state government," he said, adding 
that cases such as the one she described were primarily to be handled at the 
local, not state, level. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein, in announcing her environmental platform last month, said she would 
push for formation of a statewide "strike team" to hunt down illegal dumpers 
who carry hazardous material across county lines. On Thursday, she said she 
would not hesitate to send the National Guard to the border to help stem the 
flow of wastes into Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the candidates' time this week has been spent preparing for Sunday's 
debate, the first of two starring the Democratic candidates. The second debate 
will take place a week later, and both are expected to be pivotal to the 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
With fighting words, Van de Kamp on Thursday said he was looking forward to the 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that people will . . . understand that there's a real choice in this 
race, a choice between some specific ideas and a specific attack, a person who 
stands up for things -- as opposed to one who talks and walks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein was less confrontational in describing what she hopes will come out 
of the hourlong session in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"All I look forward to is an opportunity to reach the people of the state of 
California," she said. "I think they'll make up their own mind." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp began the day at the World Affairs Council breakfast at the 
Biltmore Hotel by promising, if he is elected, to press the federal government 
to turn over a chunk of the so-called "peace dividend" and use it to retrain 
defense industry workers expected to be laid off by cuts in defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
He added that he would establish a venture capital fund to help finance new 
businesses and a "director of conversion assistance" to help the state manage 
the economic changes posed by likely defense cutbacks.

A weekly window on the California elections.

INTELLIGENCE 
</P>
<P>
Stop if you've heard this: "He fought to enforce the death penalty and waged 
the toughest battle to save the environment of any attorney general in 
America," the announcer for a paid political advertisement intones. John K. Van 
de Kamp? Try again. The ad, it turns out, is about Democratic attorney general 
Anthony Celebrezze, who is running for governor of Ohio. If the commercial 
sounds familiar, it should. It was drafted by the campaign firm of Doak and 
Shrum, which also happens to be running the campaign of that other attorney 
general who wants to be governor -- Van de Kamp -- who has struck similar 
themes. 
</P>
<P>
Earache: To explain the 17 propositions on the June ballot to voters who are 
blind, the secretary of state's office has produced audiotapes for public 
libraries. Total listening time to get the lowdown on Prepositions 107 through 
123 at "talking book" speaking speed: 5 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
No sweat: Among the candidates who won't be breaking a sweat in the primary 
campaign's final days are the 20 members of the state Senate up for reelection 
this year. All of them filed for another term; only one drew a primary foe. And 
the lone incumbent who missed a free nomination ride -- West Los Angeles 
Democrat Herschel Rosenthal -- is expected to easily defeat his challenger, 
lawyer William Graysen. The democratic process is a bit more alive among 
Assembly races, although it's hardly at a fever-pitch. Of the 73 Assembly 
members seeking reelection, only 18 face a primary opponent. 
</P>
<P>
SOUNDINGS 
</P>
<P>
From the San Diego Union, in urging defeat of Proposition 112: 
</P>
<P>
 "The Legislature, which has a talent for doing the wrong thing, has done so 
once again by linking a long-overdue ethics package with a pay raise . . . 
California voters resent being extorted, even in an ostensibly good cause." 
</P>
<P>
From Mervin Field, director of the independent California Poll, in predicting 
that only about one-third of the eligible voters will cast ballots in June: 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in reality a nation of non-voters . . . this state's ballot boxes are 
becoming more and more empty." 
</P>
<P>
WORDWATCH 
</P>
<P>
"We've all watched the McNaughton trial." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dianne Feinstein, emphasizing the need for strict monitoring of preschools 
and other day-care facilities in the wake of the celebrated McMartin child 
abuse case. 
</P>
<P>
EXIT LINE 
</P>
<P>
"Politics is not like entering a convent." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sam Singer, Ira Reiner's campaign manager, explaining why Reiner rebuffed 
opponent Arlo Smith's call for him to take a vow not seek a higher office if 
elected attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FEINSTEIN VS. VAN DE KAMP 
</P>
<P>
 There was not much in the way of good news for John Van de Kamp in the recent 
Los Angeles Times Poll of 792 registered Democrats. Van de Kamp did not lead 
Dianne Feinstein in any of the major voter categories, although the margin of 
error of 5 points means that there is no statistical difference in some 
categories.

BIDEN DOUBLES GOVERNMENT ESTIMATE OF COCAINE USERS; 
</P>
<P>
ADDICTS: KEY DEMOCRAT CITES A NEW STUDY THAT PUTS THE NUMBER AT 2.2 MILLION 
AMERICANS. BUSH'S DRUG POLICY CZAR ANGRILY CHALLENGES THE FIGURE.

<P>
Charging that the Bush Administration has underestimated the extent of the 
nation's drug problem, a key Democratic senator Thursday unveiled a new staff 
study estimating that 2.2 million Americans are frequent users of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
The figure, more than twice the number cited in the most recent government 
report, incorporates new estimates of drug use among criminals and the 
homeless, who are not included in an authoritative household survey by the 
National Institute on Drug Abuse. 
</P>
<P>
If accurate, the conclusion would mean that about one in 100 Americans uses 
cocaine at least once a week. 
</P>
<P>
"These findings should give pause to us all," said Senate Judiciary Committee 
Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., who said the new report on "hard-core addicts" 
raises new questions about an Administration strategy based on more sanguine 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
But William J. Bennett, director of the White House Office of Drug Control 
Policy, angrily retorted that Biden ought to "do his homework." A top aide 
contended that the Administration already has taken into account the fact that 
significant sectors of society were overlooked in the previous study. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a cheap shot," said David Tell, Bennett's deputy chief of staff. Tell 
charged that Biden had "cooked up" the report in a bid to "resuscitate" support 
for his own drug strategy. Biden's plan would add nearly 40% more money to a 
$10.6-billion Administration package. 
</P>
<P>
With the contending plans soon to come before Congress, the harsh exchange 
appears to mark the onset of a new political drug war, with Biden leading an 
effort to put a Democratic stamp on the electorally potent issue. 
</P>
<P>
In his opening salvo at a news conference Thursday, Biden said the findings of 
his report demonstrate the need for spending on drug treatment and prison 
construction far beyond what the Administration has endorsed. 
</P>
<P>
The senator charged that the nation "cannot afford" to continue with an 
Administration policy that leaves "addicts roving the streets of our cities and 
towns, neither in treatment or in prison, wreaking havoc on our neighborhoods 
and on themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett has warned that the number of cocaine addicts is increasing even while 
the overall number of drug users declines. But in recent appearances, both he 
and President Bush have emphasized more positive signs, saying they believe the 
United States is beginning to succeed in its anti-drug effort. 
</P>
<P>
Aides to Bennett questioned some of the methodology used by the Senate staff in 
developing the new estimate of American cocaine addiction and said the small 
number of individuals sampled made it impossible to know if the figure is 
accurate. 
</P>
<P>
In measuring the extent of the nation's drug problem, they said, Bennett's 
office has given more credence to a broader survey by the National Institute on 
Drug Abuse showing that some 4 million Americans use illegal drugs more than 
200 times a year. 
</P>
<P>
The new congressional study was drafted for Biden by staff members of the 
Senate Judiciary Committee and was not endorsed by any other panel member. 
</P>
<P>
It used as a starting point the 1988 household survey by the institute, which 
put the best estimate of weekly cocaine users in the United States at 862,000. 
But in adding projections based on studies of criminals, the homeless and 
others, it concluded that more than 1.7 million frequent cocaine addicts likely 
had been overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
Among those the study said had not previously been included in government 
assessments were 1,530,000 people arrested for criminal offenses, 200,000 in 
prisons, hospitals or drug treatment facilities and about 55,000 homeless 
people. 
</P>
<P>
The study sought also to provide estimates of cocaine addiction by state and 
identified Washington, D.C., as the home of the largest number of frequent 
cocaine users per capita, with 32.9 such users per 1,000 population. 
California, with an estimated per capita rate of 11.8 per 1,000, ranked fifth 
among states, behind New York, Nevada, Arizona and Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
In appealing for additional anti-drug spending Thursday, Biden repeatedly 
labeled these once-a-week users as "hard-core addicts." But Mark A. R. Kleiman, 
a Harvard University professor who helped to oversee the project, described 
them only as frequent cocaine users and said: "I would not use the phrase 
hard-core addict." 
</P>
<P>
Those who expressed skepticism about the new study focused most often on its 
conclusions about frequent drug use among people arrested, who are reported to 
represent by far America's largest segment of weekly cocaine users. 
</P>
<P>
The conclusions were based on the national Drug Use Forecast system, which 
collects data from 20 cities where some of those arrested are tested to 
determine if they had used drugs in the last 72 hours. 
</P>
<P>
The study assumed that 80% of those arrestees who tested positive for drugs 
were likely to be weekly users of cocaine. Dr. Edgar Adams, chief of 
epidemiology at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, said that assumption "may 
be too high."

A twin-engine commercial airliner crashed into a sorghum field outside this 
southern Mexico city and burst into flames Thursday, killing 27 of the people 
aboard, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Those killed included Bishop Luis Miguel Canton Marin and two other priests who 
were flying in for Pope John Paul II's scheduled visit today to Tuxtla 
Gutierrez, about 375 miles southeast of Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the state-run airline Aviacsa, which owned the Dutch-made 
Fokker F-27 turboprop, said there were 35 passengers and five crew on board. 
</P>
<P>
The flight originated in Tapuchala, near the border with Guatemala, where 
Canton, 49, was the bishop. 
</P>
<P>
Police commander Jorge Luis Yanez said the crash occurred about three miles 
from the airport outside the capital of Chiapas state. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just terrible, and to think that this happened the day before the Pope's 
visit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yanez said mechanical difficulties were believed responsible for the crash. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope is due to arrive today at Tuxtla Gutierrez, where he will say a Mass 
during a brief visit before departing for the nearby city of Villahermosa.

POPE GOES BARNSTORMING WITH BIRTH CONTROL PLEA;

<P>
MEXICO: HE DELIVERS HIS MESSAGE IN A COUNTRY WHOSE GOVERNMENT ACTIVELY SEEKS TO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A tireless Pope John Paul II barnstormed through bruising heat and buoying 
crowds in the Mexican north Thursday to deliver an uncompromising message 
against artificial birth control to a nation whose government aggressively 
seeks to limit population growth. 
</P>
<P>
John Paul spent three hours in Chihuahua, enough time for 600 new babies to be 
born in Mexico where the population, now around 83 million, has grown by about 
16 million since the Pope's first Mexican visit in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Pilgrims from El Paso, Tex., 225 miles to the north, joined hundreds of 
thousands of festive Mexicans at a wind-whipped outdoor service in a dusty 
field here in Chihuahua, an agricultural and mining state of copper-colored 
hills, endless blue sky and wide-brimmed cowboy hats beneath an unblinking 
summer sun. 
</P>
<P>
An afternoon Mass in a dry riverbed at industrial Monterrey took John Paul to 
within 100 miles of Laredo, Tex., his closest stop to the United States on an 
eight-day Mexican pilgrimage that ends Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Once again Thursday -- Mother's Day in Mexico -- huge friendly crowds stalked 
John Paul's every step through a day that began early in Durango and ended late 
in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
In a modern society scarred by "violence, abortion, euthanasia, the 
marginalization of the disabled and the poor," John Paul said, it is the woman 
who "is called to keep alive the spark of life, the respect for the mystery of 
all new life." 
</P>
<P>
Terming Catholic marriage a "demanding reality," the Pope said that Roman 
Catholic couples must always be open "to the gift of life." 
</P>
<P>
"You must keep in mind that if the possibility of conceiving a child is 
artificially eliminated in a marriage, the couple is shutting itself off from 
God and opposing his will," the Pope said in reiterating the church's unbending 
opposition to artificial birth control. 
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore," he said, "the husband and wife close themselves off from each 
other because they reject the mutual gift of fatherhood and motherhood, 
reducing the conjugal union to an opportunity to satisfy each other's egotism." 
</P>
<P>
The church-state split over population policies in Mexico is a variation on a 
theme that courses through all countries of Catholic Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
The church, whose teaching allows only natural methods of family planning, is 
at odds with a Mexican government whose development efforts are compromised by 
a mushrooming population. There will be 100 million Mexicans by century's end 
in a nation struggling to lift living standards for a people whose average 
annual income is now only around $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
Government birth control programs, criticized by Catholic groups, include 
television ads urging couples to limit themselves to two children. 
</P>
<P>
The programs have helped to reduce the population growth rate to 2.4% a year. 
Even that, though, means about 2 million births per year and -- with about 40% 
of Mexicans under age 15 -- a doubling of the population in 29 years. 
</P>
<P>
About 96% of Mexicans are professed Roman Catholics, but 48% of Mexican women 
now use contraception, according to International Planned Parenthood. In the 
United States, about 85% of Catholic couples ignore the church teachings on 
birth control that the Pope reaffirmed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Telling Chihuahua worshipers that the health of a society depends on the health 
of its families, John Paul urged greater respect for the rights of children, 
including the unborn. 
</P>
<P>
"Society is more sensitive every day to the rights of the child," the Pope 
said. But he warned that any child is nevertheless still a potential victim of 
a long list of ills, including "the evil of a part of society that makes 
attempts on his life even before birth through the practice of abortion." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Pope travels to extreme southern Mexico for visits to Chiapas and 
Tabasco states, where he is expected to address refugee issues.

BRITISH DIPLOMAT SPY RING HAD 'FIFTH MAN,' EX-KGB AGENT SAYS;

<P>
A former Soviet undercover agent in Britain said Thursday there had been a 
"fifth man" in the spy ring of British diplomats who worked for the Kremlin 
from the 1930s until three of them fled to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"There was definitely a fifth man. I knew him personally," Yuri Motin, a 
retired KGB colonel, told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after a press showing of "A Cambridge Graduate," a film 
about the life of Harold (Kim) Philby, the main figure in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
British and American intelligence chiefs have agonized for years over whether 
there was a fifth member of the group, which included Philby, Donald Maclean, 
Guy Burgess and Anthony Blunt. 
</P>
<P>
Maclean and Burgess, also graduates of Cambridge University in the early 1930s, 
fled to Moscow in 1951 after Philby told them they were about to be arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Philby was retired from the intelligence service under heavy suspicion but he 
was officially exonerated after years of intermittent interrogation. He finally 
fled in 1963 to Moscow, where he helped train other Soviet agents. 
</P>
<P>
Blunt, who was a senior adviser on art to Britain's Queen Elizabeth II for many 
years, was publicly revealed to have been part of the ring in 1979. He died in 
Italy in 1983, just a few weeks before Maclean's death in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Burgess died in Moscow in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Motin told foreign reporters he had been one of Philby's controllers in 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
His phrasing at the news conference and in interviews during the film, made in 
the Soviet Union and Britain, indicated the mysterious figure is still alive. 
</P>
<P>
"He is an interesting person, with his own strong character and personality. I 
don't want to say any more about him to avoid giving any reason for him to be 
persecuted," he told a Soviet interviewer in the 90-minute documentary. 
</P>
<P>
The film, which will be shown on Soviet television Friday night on the second 
anniversary of Philby's death in Moscow, says the spy provided the Kremlin with 
vital information on German military plans during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
He also passed on news to Moscow in May, 1941, of the secret flight of Rudolf 
Hess, deputy to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, to Britain on a mysterious mission 
apparently aimed at negotiating peace.

In a tragicomic way, the stork incident shows that what really separates the 
two Germanys are the little things that never make it into the history books. 
</P>
<P>
If West Germany is a high-performance model of affluence and efficiency, then 
East Germany is Teutonic topsy-turvy, sort of "Deutschland Through the Looking 
Glass." 
</P>
<P>
Start with transportation. 
</P>
<P>
In the West, there is the famous autobahn, a scientifically perfect freeway on 
which you may drive at whatever speed you want in a scientifically perfect West 
German car. All they ask is that you keep it out of the Rhine River. 
</P>
<P>
Should you venture off the autobahn and break any traffic law, hidden cameras 
will photograph you in the act -- and your license plate as well -- and the 
police will send you a ticket in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
Across the border in East Germany, there are also roads, deceptively called 
highways. Sometimes they are cobblestone. Sometimes a lot of cobblestones are 
missing, which you might not notice at night, since there are no lights. 
</P>
<P>
You also might not notice that there is a speed limit in East Germany -- about 
62 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
This is more a comment on technology than character. Plastic cars with 
2-cylinder engines don't go all that fast. Not even plastic 2-cylinder police 
cars, which is why East German police officers have to stand in the middle of 
their highways and wave speeders down. 
</P>
<P>
Communication is even dicier. When Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere took 
office as the first democratically elected leader of East Germany several weeks 
ago, his inaugural speech contained no grand plans to colonize Mars or even 
lure over the Disney folks. His promises were more basic. 
</P>
<P>
"The days of waiting 16 years for a telephone are past," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, about 10% of the new legislators didn't hear him say it, because 
they don't have telephones and the "blitz telegrams" fired off to notify them 
of the parliamentary session arrived two days too late. 
</P>
<P>
But then, there almost wasn't a government to convene, since a broken copying 
machine delayed the historic signing of their coalition agreement. 
</P>
<P>
A West German entrepreneur thought for awhile that he had the communications 
problem solved. He formed a partnership with two little East German girls and 
their homing pigeons. 
</P>
<P>
The man had set up a real estate office in Magdeburg, but he soon learned that 
real estate dealers can't do a lot of business without a telephone. So he would 
tie messages to the legs of pigeons and send them east. The girls would collect 
their birds and relay the message to the man's secretary. 
</P>
<P>
But there was a hitch: They were one-way pigeons. 
</P>
<P>
So after the last winged messenger was dispatched, the man would have to drive 
to East Germany, collect the birds and return them to his office. 
</P>
<P>
At least crossing the border is easy, without those notoriously vicious East 
German guard dogs. No longer needed to patrol the border, the dogs have been 
exposed as frauds, all bark and no bite. The humane society is finding them 
homes as family pets. 
</P>
<P>
They may have to compete for attention with sequined cockroaches. A Hamburg 
woman bought one -- complete with a little leash -- on vacation in Mexico. She 
flew it back to West Germany, where, stricken with guilt, she turned it over to 
an animal shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Which sort of brings us to the subject of Germans and trash. West Germans love 
sorting trash. There are specific days to throw away specific things in 
specific receptacles. 
</P>
<P>
West Germans are so good at trash that they actually bought some nuclear waste 
from Washington state recently, just to prove that they could find a way to 
dispose of it efficiently -- once they persuade the environmentalists to let 
them sail radioactive debris across the Atlantic, that is. 
</P>
<P>
If the West Germans had trash they couldn't think of anything else to do with, 
they paid East Germany to take it and burn it, creating a pollution problem 
West Germany will now marry into. 
</P>
<P>
East German environmental controls are typified by the guppies used to monitor 
the country's only biological water purification system. The water is 
considered pure if the guppies can survive in it for 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Our gift for improvisation" is one of the major contributions East Germany has 
to make in a united Germany, Prime Minister De Maiziere has said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the world champions of improvisation," agreed Juergen Nowak, editor of 
Eulenspiegel, an East German satirical magazine.

Radical students and dissidents fought South Korean riot police in street 
battles in Seoul and other cities Thursday for the second day, despite a 
government warning against violence. 
</P>
<P>
Riot police moved swiftly to disperse the groups of 200 to 500 students who 
chanted "Down with President Roh Tae Woo!" during scattered protests in the 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of riot police were deployed in downtown areas. They tightened street 
checks and took away young pedestrians suspected of participating in the 
clashes. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before nightfall, riot troops fired tear gas to disperse 1,500 students 
carrying firebombs who had occupied a main street on the eastern edge of 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
News reports said thousands of radical students armed with rocks, steel pipes 
and firebombs battled police Thursday outside about 40 campuses or in the 
streets nationwide. Details were not given. 
</P>
<P>
Police did not say how many people were arrested Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Police detained 1,864 people in Seoul and 16 other cities during Wednesday's 
street clashes, the largest and most violent since Roh took office in February, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 students and dissidents participated in Wednesday's protests, and 
247 police were injured. Protesters demanded that Roh annul the January merger 
of his governing party with two opposition groups and resign. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition and radical students say that Roh's ruling Democratic Liberal Party, 
formed after the merger of three parties, was a "political coup d'etat" because 
it was not ratified in an election. They contend that the merger in effect 
nullified elections in which people voted for the two opposition parties as an 
anti-government expression. Before the merger, Roh's party lacked a majority in 
the National Assembly; the merged party has a sizable majority. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, protesters attacked 24 police stations, governing party offices 
and government buildings. An office of the U.S. Information Service center in 
Seoul was gutted by firebombs. 
</P>
<P>
Roh's government warned Thursday that it would move swiftly and forcibly to 
block labor and political violence. 
</P>
<P>
Dissidents said they would stage more protests. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's destroy the pro-American fascist" and "Drive out the Yankees," about 200 
people shouted during a rally Thursday at Myungdong Cathedral in central Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the cathedral was the focal point of nationwide anti-government 
protests. That unrest forced authoritarian President Chun Doo Hwan to carry out 
major democratic reforms, including the presidential election that brought Roh 
to office.

CHAMORRO FACES HER FIRST UNION CRISIS; 
</P>
<P>
NICARAGUA: 40,000 CIVIL SERVANTS STRIKE. THEIR ACTION FOLLOWS AN OFFICIAL MOVE 
TO REORGANIZE THE BUREAUCRACY. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Sandinista union representing Nicaragua's 40,000 government employees 
declared an indefinite strike Thursday, plunging President Violeta Barrios de 
Chamorro into her first labor crisis two weeks after taking office. 
</P>
<P>
The union called the strike after Chamorro suspended the civil service law to 
give her Cabinet ministers a free hand to dismiss senior holdovers from the 
Sandinista administration and to reorganize the government bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
A decree signed by Chamorro and her labor minister, and issued without comment, 
also announced that large wage increases decreed by the Sandinista government 
in its final weeks were being "reviewed." 
</P>
<P>
Hours after the decree was broadcast, workers left their desks but remained 
inside several ministries and locked out Chamorro's officials. Police made no 
move to oust them. The president continued working in her downtown office and 
was not affected, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The strike -- preceded by walkouts Wednesday by workers in the National 
Assembly, the Labor Ministry and the Foreign Ministry -- shut down 11 
government ministries but no public services. Sandinista labor leaders, who 
claim to represent 200,000 workers nationwide, threatened a disruptive general 
strike -- shutting down banks, schools, public transportation and utilities -- 
if Chamorro does not settle personally with the government workers by the 
weekend. Union leaders said she agreed to meet with them today. 
</P>
<P>
The labor dispute broke an uneasy truce that had prevailed between the 
center-right government and Sandinista-led unions since Chamorro's inauguration 
April 25, and it underscored the obstacles Chamorro faces in trying to mend the 
war-battered economy by reducing huge government deficits. 
</P>
<P>
The Sandinista National Liberation Front, defeated in the Feb. 25 election, 
remains the strongest force in organized labor. The union leading the strike is 
the General Confederation of Public Administration Workers. It was formed under 
a Sandinista-inspired civil service law that took effect in March, and it is 
affiliated with the main Sandinista labor organization. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Angel Bermudez, the union's secretary general, called the president's 
decree an illegal attempt "to prepare the conditions for a massive layoff of 
state workers." But he emphasized that the union was open to negotiations with 
her. 
</P>
<P>
Labor Minister Francisco Rosales, a former Sandinista, declared Wednesday that 
the new civil service law is unconstitutional. He said it violates a provision 
of the labor code that prevailed throughout a decade of Sandinista rule 
prohibiting government employees from having their own union or going on 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
Rosales said the law tied the new government's hands by making it impossible to 
dismiss senior Sandinista officials, such as the directors of state-owned 
banks, without proof that they committed crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"The strategy of the Sandinista government in its final days was to set the 
stage for increasing chaos," he told reporters. "This is why this union was 
created." 
</P>
<P>
The suspension of the law will allow the government to fire employees who 
strike or leave their jobs to hold demonstrations such as the march Wednesday 
by 2,000 government workers demanding wage increases. Officials said the law 
would be modified by administrative regulations before being put back into 
force. 
</P>
<P>
Underlying the conflict is a wage dispute touched off by the new government's 
50% devaluation of the cordoba, which caused prices to soar during its first 
week in office. Promising to keep wages apace with inflation, the government 
last week decreed a 60% pay raise for its employees, but the Sandinista union 
is demanding a 200% raise.

Thirty-four tombs at a Jewish cemetery were desecrated by vandals, and the body 
of an elderly man was dug up and impaled on an umbrella, authorities said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders across the political spectrum reacted with outrage at the desecration, 
one of the worst such incidents ever in France. 
</P>
<P>
It occurred two days after a nationwide telecast of a three-hour documentary 
about Nazi Germany and the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Pierre Joxe said several tombs in the south-central town of 
Carpentras were left "in conditions so abominable that one can't describe them 
without embarrassment." 
</P>
<P>
"I learned with horror of this criminal act," President Francois Mitterrand 
said in a telegram to Freddy Haddad, a Jewish leader in Carpentras. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the body of an 81-year-old man who died about two weeks ago was 
found impaled on an umbrella when the desecration was discovered early 
Thursday. Grave markers were knocked over and flower pots were trampled, but no 
graffiti were found. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unimaginable that such deeds are possible in France," Joxe said.

DE KLERK MEETS MITTERRAND ON EUROPEAN TOUR

<P>
President Frederik W. de Klerk met Thursday with French President Francois 
Mitterrand, launching a nine-nation diplomatic offensive by becoming the first 
South African leader to visit the Elysee Palace in more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
The talks underscored the progress De Klerk has made in eight months as 
president toward easing South Africa's isolation and convincing Western leaders 
that he is serious about ending apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
Paris is the first stop for De Klerk on an 18-day European tour to seek support 
for his reform initiatives and a lifting of economic sanctions. It is the most 
extensive foreign mission by a South African head of state since the National 
Party took power in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand and other Western leaders agreed to receive De Klerk after he 
ordered the release of Nelson Mandela in February and lifted a 30-year ban on 
the African National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, the ANC deputy president, is expected to meet Mitterrand on June 7 
when he visits France as part of his own European tour, Hubert Vedrine, the 
Elysee Palace presidential spokesman announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela and De Klerk agreed during talks last week to work together to end 
political violence and clear the way for formal negotiations on a 
post-apartheid constitution that would extend voting rights to the black 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk is scheduled to leave Paris on Friday for Greece, with later stops 
planned in Portugal, Belgium, Britain, West Germany, Switzerland, Spain and 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mandela arrived Thursday in Angola and thanked the Marxist 
government and its allies for supporting his African National Congress in its 
struggle against white-minority rule in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
In an emotional speech to tens of thousands of Angolans packing Luanda's dusty 
May 1 Square, Mandela said, "I pay tribute to comrade President (Jose Eduardo) 
dos Santos, his government and the Angolan people for all the help they have 
given us."

SUBWAY BEGGING NOT FREE SPEECH, U.S. COURT RULES

<P>
A federal appeals court ruled Thursday that begging on the subways is not a 
constitutionally protected form of free speech and is "nothing less than 
assault" on citizens by panhandlers. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a Jan. 26 
ruling by U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand that poor people had a First 
Amendment right to beg. 
</P>
<P>
Sand's ruling had fueled a heated debate on panhandling and heightened 
frustration of commuters complaining about increasingly aggressive homeless 
people asking for money. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems fair to say that most individuals who beg are not doing so to convey 
any social or political message," said Judge Frank Altimeri, who wrote the 
50-page, 3-1 decision. "Rather, they beg to collect money. 
</P>
<P>
"Begging is inherently aggressive to the captive passengers in the close 
confines of the subway atmosphere. Begging in the subway often amounts to 
nothing less than assault, creating in the passengers the apprehension of 
imminent danger." 
</P>
<P>
Sand had directed that begging and panhandling be permitted on subway platforms 
and mezzanines but temporarily prohibited such behavior on subway trains and 
other areas.

CHICAGO MURDER CASE TO TEST FEDERAL DEATH PENALTY LAW; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: TWO ALLEGED MEMBERS OF A DRUG RING FACE CHARGES IN THE SLAYING OF AN 
INFORMANT. A COURT CHALLENGE IS EXPECTED IF THE SENTENCE IS IMPOSED.

<P>
Stepping up the government's war on drugs, prosecutors said here Thursday they 
would seek the first test of a controversial 1988 law that established a 
federal death penalty for certain drug-related murders. 
</P>
<P>
If such a sentence were carried out, it would be the first federal execution 
since the 1953 electrocution deaths of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. They were 
convicted of slipping atomic secrets to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after a federal grand jury charged two members of an 
alleged South Side heroin and cocaine distribution ring with the 1989 
execution-style murder of a government informant. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, fiercely criticized by foes of capital punishment and sure 
to be challenged in court the first time such a sentence is imposed, anyone 
convicted of murder or ordering a murder while committing a drug-related felony 
is subject to the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Ira H. Raphaelson, the acting U.S. attorney for the Northern District of 
Illinois, declined to specify why the government had chosen the Chicago case to 
test the statute. But he said the government had a special duty to throw the 
book at anyone who kills an informant in drug cases. 
</P>
<P>
"When insiders in these organizations are murdered because of their cooperative 
efforts, we have a need to vindicate their efforts," Raphaelson said. "The 
message that we're trying to send is that the drug war is going to be fought at 
every level. . . . We will not shy away from seeking the ultimate sanction." 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released in Washington, U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said the 
murders of inside informants were especially heinous because their cooperation 
was often key to breaking up drug rings. 
</P>
<P>
"Street-level distribution networks such as the one alleged in this indictment 
cannot be effectively dismantled without the cooperation of citizen-witnesses," 
Thornburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Miller, executive director of the Illinois chapter of the American Civil 
Liberties Union, declined comment on the development until he could study the 
charges. The ACLU is a staunch critic of capital punishment on both the state 
and federal levels. 
</P>
<P>
The indictments charge Alexander Cooper, 30, the alleged boss of a major drug 
ring on the South Side of Chicago as well as northwest Indiana, with ordering 
the Feb. 6, 1989, murder of Robert Parker in order to silence him. According to 
the charges, Parker was passing information about the ring to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Also charged with murder is the alleged triggerman, 39-year-old Anthony Davis. 
Parker's body was riddled with five bullet holes when it was found, prosecutors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, an ex-garbage collector for the city, has been in federal custody since 
last year. Prosecutors said his nickname on the street was "Ghost" because he 
rarely showed up at his legitimate job but still managed to stay on the 
payroll. Davis, also known as "Future," is still at large. 
</P>
<P>
The two were originally indicted on drug charges in October along with 19 other 
people after Chicago police and federal investigators cracked the ring in a 
series of pre-dawn raids. At the time, then-U.S. Atty. Anton Valukas referred 
to the ring as a "family affair" and described it as one of the largest 
continuous drug operations in the Chicago area. Cooper's mother, two brothers, 
a sister and a cousin were arrested in the crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
Raphaelson said the ring, which allegedly began selling drugs in 1982, 
sometimes distributed as much as two kilograms of cocaine and six kilograms of 
heroin a week and grossed as much as $50,000 a day in street sales. 
</P>
<P>
The death penalty provision was part of an omnibus anti-crime bill passed by 
Congress two years ago. There are several federal death penalty statutes on the 
books, but most were rendered unenforceable by a 1972 U.S. Supreme Court 
decision that also invalidated state death penalty laws. Executions later 
resumed in some states after legislatures rewrote capital punishment statutes 
to satisfy high court objections. 
</P>
<P>
The only other federal crimes currently subject to capital punishment are 
espionage committed by a member of the military and murder committed during an 
airline hijacking.

<TEXT>
<P>
Canadian police seized about $800,000 in drugs and cash on strife-torn Mohawk 
territory and arrested 21 people on drug and weapons charges Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 officers led by Ontario Provincial Police seized cocaine and 
marijuana from homes at Cornwall Island on the St. Regis Indian Reservation and 
in nearby Cornwall, Ontario, police spokesman Peter West said. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve guns were seized, including at least three automatic rifles. Police also 
seized about $32,000 in U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 21 people arrested, 16 were being sought, West said. Police 
said about half of the suspects lived on the reservation, which straddles the 
U.S.-Canadian border. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the raid was not connected with a violence-filled struggle 
over gambling rights on the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
Reservation violence had been quelled since hundreds of New York and Canadian 
police swarmed onto the Mohawk land on May 1, when two Indians were shot to 
death in a 10-month-old casino gambling feud.

RACE RELATIONS: MURDER CASE SHOWS HOW ANXIETY RACKS NEW YORK. MAYOR DINKINS IS 
SHARPLY CRITICIZED FOR INACTION.

A large contingent of riot-helmeted police guarded the courthouse Thursday 
where twin juries were considering the fates of two white 19-year-olds accused 
of playing a principal part in the killing of a black teen-ager in the 
predominantly white Brooklyn neighborhood of Bensonhurst. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of the police underscored not only the explosive potential of the 
case, but also racial anxiety in the city. 
</P>
<P>
As both juries asked for portions of testimony to be read back to them, another 
judge in the same courthouse sharply criticized Mayor David N. Dinkins for 
failing to "personally intervene" in a bitter dispute between black protesters 
and Korean-American grocers in another Brooklyn neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
This dispute, coupled with the Bensonhurst case, has created the most serious 
problem in race relations so far for Dinkins, who was elected New York's first 
black mayor on a platform stressing his ability to bring about a gentler racial 
climate in the city. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to diffuse tension and make his positions clear, Dinkins announced 
Thursday he would deliver a major address on racial problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that we are doing pretty well with respect to race relations," Dinkins 
said Thursday. ". . . I want to try to put things in perspective. I don't mean 
to say I am unconcerned, that things are all rosy in our town. They have never 
been." 
</P>
<P>
The murder of the black teen-ager as he walked with friends last Aug. 23 
sparked street protests and was a racial flash point in the bitter primary 
contest between former Mayor Edward I. Koch and Dinkins. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third full day of deliberations in the case of Joseph Fama, accused 
of killing Yusuf Hawkins, 16, with a .32-caliber pistol. A separate jury worked 
for the second day, considering accusations against Keith Mondello, who 
prosecutors claim organized a group of whites carrying bats who surrounded 
Hawkins and three companions who had entered the neighborhood to look at a used 
car. 
</P>
<P>
Each defendant faces 25 years to life if convicted of murder. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to Wednesday, when demonstrators calling for convictions of both 
youths punched Mondello's lawyer Stephen Murphy as he went to lunch outside the 
courthouse, the scene was quiet on Thursday. Only a handful of demonstrators 
showed up in a pelting rain. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the dispute over whether a Korean-American grocer or a black 
customer was at fault in a scuffle at the store has escalated into a boycott by 
black protesters of two Korean American-run groceries in Brooklyn's Flatbush 
section. 
</P>
<P>
State Supreme Court Justice Gerald Held, hearing legal arguments in the grocery 
boycott, urged both sides to attempt mediation. He said demonstrations could 
take place, but no closer than 50 feet from each grocery. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he took Dinkins to task. 
</P>
<P>
"The court regrets the failure of the mayor of the city of New York to 
personally intervene and use the prestige of his office and his high standing 
in the community to convince the parties to bring a suitable end to this 
dispute," Held said. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to earlier criticism, Dinkins has claimed that both sides in the 
dispute were close to a settlement before media attention began and the number 
of pickets outside the stores grew dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor has tried to resolve the grocery boycott through quiet negotiations 
by his aides -- a style that has brought him criticism from Koch and from the 
New York Times, which editorially prodded him for not acting more forcefully. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the mayor had appointed the deputy mayor to try to resolve the 
dispute, the Times nevertheless asked: "Is that all Mayor Dinkins can think to 
do? Racist fires are alight. . . .The boycott rides on a tide of ugly, 
unmistakably racist rhetoric that warrants condemnation from every fair-minded 
New Yorker, starting with Mayor David Dinkins." 
</P>
<P>
In a television interview, Koch declared that as mayor he would have gone down 
to the grocery and bought provisions for Gracie Mansion, the mayor's official 
residence, to show his support. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute began in January when a Haitian customer complained she was beaten 
without provocation by the store's employees. The store's owner countered by 
charging that the woman refused to pay the full price for her groceries and had 
to be restrained. 
</P>
<P>
One of the store's employees was charged with assault, and the case is being 
handled by the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office. 
</P>
<P>
The situation simmered until Robert C. (Sonny) Carson became one of the 
boycott's leaders. Carson, a convicted kidnaper, received $9,500 from Dinkins' 
mayoral campaign in what campaign officials described as part of a 
get-out-the-vote drive in the Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
Later, during the election, Dinkins disavowed Carson, who had proclaimed he was 
anti-white. But the campaign never produced complete receipts for Carson's 
expenses, and the fact it dealt with Carson at all disturbed some voters. 
</P>
<P>
In its editorial, the Times acknowledged the facts in the grocery store dispute 
may be ambiguous. But it said there was nothing ambiguous about Carson's 
behavior, calling him a "racial provocateur" and noting that leaflets handed 
out by pickets urged people to "boycott all Korean stores" and not to shop 
"with people who do not look like us."

INSURERS' MOTIVES ON PROP. 115 QUESTIONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Insurance companies have contributed more than $300,000 to the campaign for 
Proposition 115 -- an anti-crime initiative on the June ballot -- and 
suspicious foes charged on Thursday that insurers may have hidden motives for 
their generous support of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative's opponents contend that insurers may be backing the measure 
because, under it, the courts could be so busy with criminal cases it would be 
increasingly difficult to bring civil suits to trial. That could enable 
insurers to stall or obtain more favorable settlements in cases where they are 
being sued, the foes said. 
</P>
<P>
The accusations were heatedly denied by insurance officials, who said they 
support the initiative as an effective device to curb crime and thus trim 
insurance losses. And backers of the proposition said the opponents' claims 
reflected a resort to desperation tactics in the face of a losing battle to 
defeat it. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Wickers, campaign director for the main group backing the initiative, also 
said that the $322,000 insurance companies have donated represents a relatively 
small proportion of the $2.2 million raised in behalf of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Most suits involving insurance are civil cases. The initiative, sponsored by 
prosecutors and victims' groups, aims to reduce delay in the criminal justice 
system and curb the constitutional rights of criminal defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the measure eases requirements that witnesses testify 
personally at preliminary hearings, requires that court-appointed defense 
attorneys be ready for trial by certain dates and imposes deadlines on courts 
to bring felony cases to trial. 
</P>
<P>
"Experts tell us that if 115 passes, it will all but consume every judge in the 
county in order to try criminal cases," said Ian Herzog of Los Angeles, 
president-elect of the California Trial Lawyers Assn. and an initiative 
opponent. "It means innocent civil victims won't have a place to have their 
cases tried." 
</P>
<P>
Another spokesman for initiative opponents, Sacramento defense attorney Michael 
Rothschild, said: "The insurers are giving a lot of money to 115 because they 
know it will shut down the civil courts. . . . Insurance companies only do 
things because they can make money from it; they don't do things for benevolent 
purposes." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Nickell, campaign director for Californians for Privacy, a coalition of 
groups opposing the measure, said that insurers may stand to gain better access 
to personal medical records if, as opponents claim, the measure weakens state 
privacy protections. 
</P>
<P>
Another motive for the big contributions, Nickell said, could be to provide 
indirect support for the gubernatorial candidacy of Republican U.S. Sen. Pete 
Wilson, who is honorary chairman of the initiative campaign. 
</P>
<P>
While some industry officials remained tight-lipped or unavailable for comment, 
others reacted vehemently to the charges, calling them "silly" and a "big lie." 
</P>
<P>
James Snyder, president of the Personal Insurance Federation of California, an 
industry association, said the initiative could result in faster and more 
effective prosecution in insurance-fraud cases. At a "bare minimum," he said, 
fraud against insurers costs consumers over $100 million annually in Southern 
California alone. 
</P>
<P>
"We all pay the cost of crime -- and we're all frustrated with the inefficiency 
and what appears to be the lack of effectiveness in the criminal justice 
system," Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
"Crime is a major contributor to insurance costs," said Curt Olsen, a spokesman 
for TransAmerica Insurance Co., which contributed $25,000 in support of 115. 
"The less crime there is, the less our losses will be. Crime is expensive to 
insurance companies and their policyholders." 
</P>
<P>
Top officials of Mercury General Corp. and Surety Co. of the Pacific, which 
each contributed $100,000, were not available for comment. George Joseph, chief 
executive officer of Mercury General, and Bill Erwin, chief executive officer 
of Surety, are known in political circles as strong Republican Party 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Wilson joined in blasting the the opponents' claims. 
</P>
<P>
"The opponents are trying again to create the big lie," said Bill Livingston, 
press secretary of Wilson's campaign for governor. "The initiative will do the 
very opposite of what they say. . . . It sounds like they are desperate." 
</P>
<P>
Livingston said that, in fact, the initiative will relieve congestion in the 
courts -- speeding both criminal and civil cases -- and that it does not 
threaten the confidentiality of medical records or any other rights to privacy. 
"There is no hidden agenda," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nickell released a list showing that 14 insurance companies had donated 
$322,000 to the "Yes on 115" campaign, in amounts ranging from $500 to 
$100,000. The larger contributions are unusual, he said, because the industry 
traditionally has not made major donations in campaigns that do not appear to 
involve it directly. 
</P>
<P>
While conceding there was no way to determine the motives for the 
contributions, Nickell contended that the prospect of a "logjam of criminal 
cases" in the courts and more readily available medical records seemed the most 
likely explanations.

SENATE OKS REDISTRICTING REFORM MEASURE; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT WOULD OVERHAUL THE METHOD OF 
REDRAWING LEGISLATIVE AND CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS AFTER THE CENSUS.

<P>
In a move fraught with political overtones, the state Senate on Thursday 
approved a proposed ballot measure to overhaul the way in which legislative and 
congressional districts are redrawn after the present census. 
</P>
<P>
A 28-4 bipartisan vote sent the constitutional amendment, sponsored by Sen. 
Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), to an uncertain fate in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Majority Democrats voted for the new plan, which could appear on the November 
ballot, in hopes of undermining the chances of Propositions 118 and 119 in the 
June 5 primary election. 
</P>
<P>
Most Republicans, on the other hand, voted for it as a safety valve in case the 
two propositions, which have broad GOP support, fail to pass. GOP lawmakers are 
still smarting from what they consider an adverse 1982 reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
In brief, the constitutional amendment calls for the Legislature to draw a 
redistricting plan and submit it to an independent 12-member citizens 
commission for review and possible changes. The commission would hold at least 
five public hearings on the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The redistricting plan would go back to the Legislature, which could adopt or 
rewrite it. It would become law if approved by a two-thirds vote of both 
houses. But the governor's signature would not be required. 
</P>
<P>
At least 40% of all districts would have to be "competitive" or winnable by 
either a Democrat or a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
Redistricting is a politically explosive task that the lawmakers accomplish 
every decade after the federal census. The party in power usually tries to 
maintain its majority status by drawing districts that will remain "safe" for 
them until the next redistricting. The way district lines are redrawn can spell 
either political survival or extinction for individual legislators. 
</P>
<P>
"The non-productive trench warfare that we go through every decade needs to be 
eliminated," Lockyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Noting the growing use of the initiative process in recent years to overcome 
legislative reluctance to act on crucial issues, Senate Democratic leader Barry 
Keene of Benicia said, "Representative government is on trial in California, 
and the outcome is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
"We are faced with the possibility of turning over the reins of public 
policy-making to the initiative process. We've got to start thinking consensus 
on more issues around here." 
</P>
<P>
Senate Republican leader Ken Maddy of Fresno said the GOP suffered from the 
1980 reapportionment, which he called the "worst gerrymandering" that he had 
ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to do something to increase fairness," Maddy said. "I suggest we move 
this along and give the Speaker and the Assembly a chance to review it to see 
if they also want fairness." 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) last week called Propositions 
118 and 119 "frauds" designed by Republicans to seize power from the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 118 would require that any reapportionment plan be approved by 
two-thirds votes of both houses of the Legislature, be signed by the governor 
and ratified by the voters. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 119 would create an independent commission to draw new district 
lines after the 1990 census is completed. 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Elliott, a League of Women Voters official and strong supporter of 
Proposition 119, said the Lockyer bill was no more than an attempt to undercut 
support for the two ballot measures. She said lawmakers have had a decade since 
the last redistricting to change the system. 
</P>
<P>
"The thought of real reform is causing some movement" in the Legislature, 
Elliot said.

LOCKHEED STRIKERS WILL VOTE ON TENTATIVE ACCORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lockheed Corp. and negotiators for 935 union workers who have been striking 
Lockheed facilities in Upland, Chino and Ontario have reached a tentative 
agreement on a new contract, company and union officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiators for Local Lodge 821 of the International Assn. of Machinists 
accepted a three-year wage and benefit offer Tuesday night and will submit the 
proposal for a ratification vote Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the agreement would end a strike that began March 12. 
</P>
<P>
Machinists at the three plants voted to strike after rejecting a proposal by 
Lockheed Aircraft Service Corp. Leaders of the union local said the offer was 
inferior to a three-year pact accepted March 4 by about 18,000 machinists at 
Lockheed manufacturing plants in Burbank, Sunnyvale, Calif., and Marietta, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides, assisted by a federal mediator, compromised on a number of 
issues after a nine-week impasse, said Bob Gregory, a union negotiator. For 
example, union workers at the Burbank plant were given a $2,500 signing bonus. 
Gregory said Lockheed had initially offered no signing bonus to his workers, 
but the two sides eventually agreed to a $2,000 signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank workers received a 4% wage increase. Under the proposed pact negotiated 
Tuesday, all of the striking workers would receive a 5% bonus during the first 
year. Some striking workers would receive a 3% wage increase during the second 
and third years of the contract and others would receive bonuses amounting to 
5% of their salaries during that two-year period. The two sides also 
compromised on a cost-of-living formula, Gregory said. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed officials had said that the firm could not afford to match the 
Burbank-Palmdale offer because the Upland, Chino and Ontario operations are not 
production facilities. More than 1,000 supervisors and salaried employees 
maintained some operations during the strike, involving the maintenance and 
modification on Air Force aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed would not provide details on the proposed contract.

SACRAMENTO FILE: 2 RIVAL HEALTH INSURANCE BILLS ARE APPROVED BY SENATE PANEL 
</P>

<P>
A Senate panel has approved two rival bills to provide health coverage for the 
state's uninsured, while an Assembly committee continues to wrestle with a 
third proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Health Committee approved a bill (SB 2505) by Senate Republican 
leader Ken Maddy of Fresno that would use increased liquor and sales taxes to 
subsidize insurance for about 4 million working people and their families. 
</P>
<P>
Also approved was another bill (SB 2868) by Sen. Nicholas C. Petris (D-Oakland) 
that would create a universal health insurance program for all Californians, 
financed by a payroll tax, increased sales taxes and possibly a higher income 
tax. 
</P>
<P>
Both measures now go to the Revenue and Taxation Committee for further 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an Assembly Finance and Insurance subcommittee is holding hearings 
on a third bill (AB 3032) by Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) to require 
employers to provide health insurance for their employees. 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNOR 
</P>
<P>
Signed into law a bill (AB 1314) by Assemblyman Steve Clute (D-Riverside) to 
require automobile dealers to report all cash transactions exceeding $10,000 to 
the state Department of Justice to help crack down on illegal drug dealers.

subject to regulation by the Public Utilities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Maritime Academy: Passed and sent to the Senate on a 47-23 vote a bill (AB 
3038) by Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-South San Francisco) to make 
gubernatorial appointments to the Board of Directors of the California Maritime

charges of sexual harassment of female cadets during the last year. 
</P>
<P>
Fish and Game: Passed and sent to the Senate on a 62-1 vote a bill (AB 3159) by

</P>
<P>
Credit Cards: The Finance and Insurance Committee approved a bill (AB 2920) by 
Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-Los Banos) to prohibit merchants from asking for 
telephone numbers on credit card slips. These phone numbers are sometimes later 
sold for advertising lists and can also contribute to credit card fraud. A 13-1 
vote sent the bill to the Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
More Credit Cards: The Judiciary Committee approved another bill (AB 2880) by 
Areias to prohibit merchants from asking a customer for his or her credit card 
verification when cashing a check. A 9-0 vote sent the bill to the Ways and

BOMB BOOM: Setting bombs is becoming more popular in Orange County, and no one 
seems to know why. . . . In 1988, the sheriff's bomb squad handled 98 exploded 
and unexploded bombs, but last year the figure was 138, and this year is ahead 
of that pace. . . . The good news: Nearly half of the bombs never go off, most 
are directed against property, not people, and bombs have killed only three 
people since 1980 -- and one of them was the bomber. Jeffrey A. Perlman and

SWOON: It's only May, but you can forget about the Angels. . . . At least 
that's the view of columnist Mike Penner (C1), who ponders the Halos' awful 
start and says "it's over."

.. . Don't blame $16-million pitcher Mark Langston, says Penner, although his 
2-3 record hasn't helped. More at fault: General Manager Mike Port, who 
"entered the season standing pat and with fingers crossed." . . . Things 
deteriorated further last night in Seattle, where the Angels lost 5-2. Jeffrey

MIDWESTERNERS DIG OUT PARKAS AS SNOW MAKES WINTRY ENCORE 
</P>

<P>
Residents of Wisconsin, Illinois and Michigan traded swimsuits and garden hoes 
for parkas and snow shovels Thursday as a freak storm brought back winter in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
The spring shocker was worst in Wisconsin, where snowfall of up to 8 inches 
shattered records for late-season snow. 
</P>
<P>
Some communities had to reassemble snowplows already stored for the season. 
Residents who had broken out the lawn furniture and headed for the beach just 
two days before, when temperatures reached the 70s and 80s, dug their coats out 
of mothballs. 
</P>
<P>
In Marquette, Mich., police officer Ron Michelson said: "I had my lounge out. 
It's still sitting on the porch getting full of snow." 
</P>
<P>
The Wisconsin storm, accompanied by wind up to 30 m.p.h., was blamed for 
hundreds of accidents and two traffic deaths. Downed power lines caused 
blackouts in more than 40,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
Weather service specialist Edmond Lowe said the snow broke a 5-inch record that 
had stood since April 30, 1907. The latest spring snow ever in Wisconsin was 
May 31, 1889. 
</P>
<P>
In Hartford, a city of 7,000, Mayor Dean Kirley declared a state of emergency, 
ordering residents off streets and advising businesses and schools to close. 
</P>
<P>
In Illinois, more than 4 inches of snow fell Wednesday night and Thursday 
morning on Chicago's northwest suburbs.

HILLARY FOLLOWS IN FATHER'S STEPS TO EVEREST SUMMIT

The son of the man who first climbed Mt. Everest reached the peak of the 
world's highest mountain Thursday, following an American team and members of a 
three-nation climb to the crowded summit. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Hillary, 36, son of mountaineer Edmund Hillary, reached the top of the 
29,028-foot-high peak 37 years after his father and Sherpa guide Tenzing Norgay 
pioneered the way. It was his fourth attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Hillary followed the traditional southeastern route first used by his father. 
He reached the top at 7:30 a.m. with the two leaders of an eight-member New 
Zealand team and a Nepalese Sherpa guide. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes before Hillary completed his feat Thursday, five Americans -- three 
lawyers, a geologist and a mountain guide -- reached the summit, the Nepalese 
Tourism Ministry said. The Americans are members of an 11-member team that also 
followed the traditional southeastern route. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, the first joint climb of Everest by U.S., Soviet and Chinese 
mountaineers broke the record for the number of climbers from the same 
expedition to scale Everest. Six climbers made it, bringing to 20 the number 
reaching the summit, among them the first Soviet female climber to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Thursday, a Belgian Everest expedition abandoned its attempt on the 
same route after the regulator of an oxygen cylinder burst, the ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
Three days ago, climbers from a three-nation team -- its members were from the 
United States, China and the Soviet Union -- scaled Everest from its northern 
side through Tibet. Six climbers in the fourth and last group from that 
expedition reached the summit Thursday, China's official news agency reported. 
American Mark Scott Tucker, 32, who grew up in Huntington Beach, was a member 
of that group. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker works as a hiking guide at Mt. Rainier, Wash., in the summer and on a 
ski patrol at Snowbird, Utah, during the winter months, his mother, Peggy 
Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
"Climbing Mt. Everest has been a dream of his for a long time," she said. "I'm 
very thrilled for him."

DIANNE KLEIN: COWED BY THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL THING; 
</P>
<P>
NEWS ITEM: BOVINE FLATULENCE GENERATES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF METHANE, A 
GREENHOUSE GAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cows, none too couth to begin with, contaminate. Only the cows can't help it. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that all that cud-chewing gives off lots of gas, an average of 400 
liters per cow per day, and, environmentally speaking, that stinks. 
</P>
<P>
So this is a serious problem. A '90s kind of problem. Cows are not conversant 
with catalytic converters. 
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources, this makes cows the world's third-largest source 
of methane released into the atmosphere, behind only natural wetlands and rice 
paddies. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't know about the paddies or the wetlands either. I'm learning a lot in 
the afterglow of Earth Day '90. 
</P>
<P>
Take dolphins. I love dolphins. Before I became environmentally aware, I wanted 
nothing more than to have a dolphin live in our back yard swimming pool in 
Miami. I was in the sixth grade. I was selfish. 
</P>
<P>
I know better now, of course. I'm a grown-up, thinking globally. Dolphins don't 
do private back-yard swimming pools. They hang out at posh Hawaiian resorts, 
where tourists pay an hourly rate to frolic with them in man-made lagoons. 
</P>
<P>
But seriously, the slaughter of dolphins in the pursuit of tuna has always 
weighed heavily upon my environmental conscience. Even when I didn't know 
that's what I had. 
</P>
<P>
Loving dolphins was the perfect excuse for hating tuna, ranking right up there 
with smelling like old, pulverized fish and tasting like worse. 
</P>
<P>
Things are changing, however. 
</P>
<P>
The three companies that produce 70% of the tuna sold on the U.S. market have 
agreed to stop using nets that kill dolphins, and, effective immediately, Alpo 
Petfoods says that its yummy tuna cat food will also be dolphin-safe. Estimates 
are that tens of thousands of dolphins will be saved each year. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the environmental movement has shown me how intertwined things really 
are on Planet Earth. So I'd been wondering about what all those dolphins were 
going to do with their new lease on life. 
</P>
<P>
Then I picked up Newsweek magazine, and I may have found out. Seems the U.S. 
Navy might be hatching plans to turn them into warmongers. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy "would neither confirm nor deny" that it is arming dolphins with nose 
cones spring-loaded with .45-caliber bullets as part of a "swimmer 
nullification" program against enemy frogmen. 
</P>
<P>
But let's get real here. Dolphins are no dummies. Give those babies weapons 
and, next thing you know, they'll be taking their revenge against tuna 
fishermen, Hawaiian hotel owners and schoolchildren on field trips to Sea 
World. 
</P>
<P>
Look for gang graffiti on boat hulls. It could be an early warning sign. 
</P>
<P>
What I'm saying here is that if there's one big lesson from Earth Day '90, it's 
that everything's connected. What goes around comes around. In other words, 
just when you think you might have one problem licked, you find out your 
so-called solution is giving off toxic wastes. 
</P>
<P>
Gasohol's another example. For years, grain alcohol in gasoline has been touted 
as a sure-fire way to help clean up the air we're breathing. An amendment to 
the Clean Air Act approved by the Senate mandates its use. 
</P>
<P>
Well, a study's just been released that concludes that using gasohol would cut 
carbon monoxide by 25% but that nitrogen oxides, which cause smog and acid 
rain, would jump as high as 15% and hydrocarbons would double. Net impact: 6% 
more smog. 
</P>
<P>
The upshot, I suppose, is that being environmentally correct these days is no 
easy task. It takes stamina and mental acuity, a conclusion that all the 
public-opinion polls bear out. 
</P>
<P>
When asked, people say they'll separate their trash, forgo patterned toilet 
paper and cut a plastic ring to save a sea gull. And the excuses they come up 
with for not car-pooling! I tell you, it really makes an American proud. Those 
poll respondents can really think on their toes! They're definitely sharp. 
</P>
<P>
Not that we Americans don't deserve to be cut some slack. Most people want to 
do what's environmentally sound. And only the extremely environmentally earnest 
don't get discouraged about it all now and then. 
</P>
<P>
Lords knows, even I have been known to get a little down in the mouth. 
Sometimes the complexity of The Issue just gets to be a bit much. 
</P>
<P>
Defiance takes over. At these times, it seems to be in my blood. I want to mow, 
mulch, fertilize and water turf grass. The urge to fire up the back-yard 
barbecue, using lots of starter fluid, is strong. Ordering my groceries bagged 
in double plastic wouldn't be out of the question during flashes like these. 
</P>
<P>
But then I get ahold of myself. I realize that, deep down, I really do want to 
be part of the solution. 
</P>
<P>
Only a cynic would say that I didn't care.

FERGUSON BACKS CABLE OPERATORS IN BATTLE AGAINST TAX INCREASES

NEWPORT BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblymen Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) has taken up the cause of cable TV 
operators, calling on colleagues in the state Legislature to "move immediately 
to quash" industry tax increases imposed this year by Orange County Assessor 
Bradley L. Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
In a news release circulated Thursday by a public relations consultant for 
cable operators, Ferguson criticized Jacobs for "attempting to make an end run 
around Proposition 13." On Wednesday, county officials criticized cable 
representatives for privately lobbying county supervisors in an attempt to 
enlist them in their campaign against Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
Outraged by recent tax increases of as much as 400%, 
</P>
<P>
cable operators have launched an expensive campaign -- running full-page 
newspaper advertisements and threatening to sue the county -- over a new 
assessment method used this year by Jacobs. Orange County is one of several 
jurisdictions around the state to now take into account a cable operator's 
intangible assets, such as the value of an exclusive franchise, in computing 
its tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson could not be reached for comment Thursday. But according to his 
statement, he will try to tack a rider on some pending bill that would prevent 
an assessor from applying such a method to cable operators and other businesses 
that have not been taxed this way in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the consumer who subscribes to cable services who will actually end up 
paying for this gigantic tax increase," Ferguson said in the statement. "Unless 
we act now, counties up and down the state will pounce on this, and the 
consumer will suffer a new form of taxation." 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs could not be reached for comment, but Deputy Assessor Ronald G. Cooper 
dismissed the criticism that his office is violating Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
"If, in fact, what we're doing is wrong under existing law, why is new 
legislation needed to stop it?" Cooper asked rhetorically. Cooper said the 
higher cable assessments simply reflect higher market values more accurately. 
</P>
<P>
"When Orange County real estate that used to sell for $100,000 is selling at 
$250,000, the assessments are going to go up," Cooper said. "When the market 
changes such that properties become two or three or four times more valuable, 
the assessments are going to go up." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said earlier this week that Jacobs' office has received about 50 letters 
that are overwhelmingly "anti-cable." But on Thursday, Cooper refused to make 
the letters public. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson's support of the cable operators "was something that caught us by 
surprise," said Harvey Englander, a public relations consultant representing 
the cable firms. "Obviously, we're extremely pleased." 
</P>
<P>
Englander said while he and other cable representatives have met individually 
with county supervisors over the past two weeks, no one in the Orange County 
group ever discussed the issue with Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
Englander said he received the written announcement from Ferguson's office 
earlier this week and decided to circulate it Thursday, after two supervisors 
criticized the cable operators' lobbying attempts. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of private meetings over the past two weeks, cable industry 
officials told the supervisors they plan to sue Jacobs and urged them to 
question the assessor before entering what they predict will be a protracted 
legal battle that could prove costly to taxpayers.

PETTI WILL BE RELEASED FROM PRISON TODAY; 
</P>
<P>
SILBERMAN CASE: REPUTED MOBSTER SERVED TWO-THIRDS OF A SENTENCE FOR VIOLATING 
PROBATION. HE MUST CONFINE CALLS TO HIS FAMILY AND LAWYER BECAUSE OF HIS PHONE 
USE IN ALLEGED MONEY-LAUNDERING SCHEME. 
</P>

<P>
Chris Petti, a reputed mob figure indicted with San Diego financier Richard T. 
Silberman on money-laundering charges, is due to be released today from a 
federal prison after serving about two-thirds of an 18-month sentence imposed 
for violating his probation. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief hearing held behind closed doors after the conclusion of another day 
of jury selection in Silberman's trial, federal District Judge J. Lawrence 
Irving set Petti's bail at $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
An unusual condition of the bail is that Petti is not allowed to use a 
telephone except to call his family or his lawyer, Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles 
F. Gorder Jr. said after emerging from the closed-door hearing. The bond was 
secured in part by a house in Arizona that belongs to Petti's brother, Gorder 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Petti's lawyer, Oscar Goodman of Las Vegas, said he expected Petti to 
immediately post a second $10,000 bond that Irving imposed as further security 
of return to San Diego. Petti has been held since last May at the Terminal 
Island federal prison, near Los Angeles, after violating his probation in a 
federal bookmaking case. 
</P>
<P>
Petti, who has been linked to organized crime in Chicago and Las Vegas, was 
convicted in 1984 of bookmaking -- in a case that covered the 1980-81 football 
season -- and sentenced to five years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
He was released from prison in 1984, after serving just under nine months of 
his year-and-a-day sentence. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1989, he and Silberman, along with several others, were arrested in 
an FBI sting. Prosecutors allege that they laundered $300,000 that an 
undercover FBI agent had characterized as the proceeds of Colombian drug 
trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Though the others were released on bail, Petti was held because of his 
probation status, and court testimony later showed he never paid any of the 
$250,000 in fines levied in the bookmaking conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, Petti was convicted of violating probation and sentenced to 18 months 
in prison. He is due to be released today, however, under rules that mandate 
release after the service of about two-thirds of a sentence, Gorder said. 
</P>
<P>
It was via Petti that Silberman was arrested, according to prosecutors. In 
October, 1988, Silberman, who had known Petti for years, asked him for help in 
finding people who would be "interested in moving cash out of the country, with 
no record," the FBI contends. 
</P>
<P>
Through government informant Robert Benjamin, Petti already had met an FBI 
undercover agent, Peter Ahearn, who was posing as Pete Carmassi, a 
representative of Colombian cocaine dealers. At a November, 1988, meeting, 
Petti introduced Carmassi to Silberman, setting in motion what prosecutors 
claim was the scheme to launder $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
Much of what FBI agents learned about the case was developed through wiretaps 
aimed at Petti, including taps on pay phones they suspected Petti commonly used 
to try to avoid being detected. 
</P>
<P>
Petti's heavy reliance on the phone, documented in hundreds of pages of 
affidavits filed with the court, explained Irving's order on Thursday 
restricting his calls to family or Goodman, Gorder said. 
</P>
<P>
Irving also restricted Petti's travel to California and said Petti was 
forbidden from any contact with Benjamin except in Goodman's presence, Gorder 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Petti and two other men, Jack Norman Myers and Darryl Nakatsuka, both of Los 
Angeles, are scheduled to stand trial together July 17. Myers and Nakatsuka 
remain free on bail. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-area investment broker Terry Ziegler, who also had been set to go 
to trial on July 17, pleaded guilty April 10 to one criminal count of violating 
federal currency laws. He is scheduled to be sentenced June 18. 
</P>
<P>
Trial for Silberman, 61, who once served as a top aide to former Gov. Edmund G. 
Brown Jr., began last week with jury selection. The first phase of the lengthy 
selection process -- formal interviews in open court with potential jurors 
about the intense publicity the case has attracted -- concluded Thursday as 
Irving seated 28 people who said they could be fair. 
</P>
<P>
The selection process is to resume today with Gorder and lead defense attorney 
James J. Brosnahan aiming to winnow those 28 to the 12 who actually will hear 
the case. Under the rules, Gorder may arbitrarily excuse six potential jurors, 
and Brosnahan may dismiss 10. 
</P>
<P>
After the lawyers pick the panel, they must go through the selection process 
again -- to seat six alternate jurors. Only then will the substance of the 
trial begin, with the lawyers' opening statements. 
</P>
<P>
At the current pace of jury selection, which has been far slower than expected, 
the opening statements are not likely to be delivered until well into next week 
or even the week after that.

THE SCIENCE PROJECT THAT WAS PUT ON ICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Teachers at a Carlsbad Catholic school and a drunk-driving watchdog group may 
have heaped praise on eighth-grader Andy Rock's science experiment, but 
officials of the Greater San Diego Science and Engineering Fair decided to 
disqualify it. 
</P>
<P>
The 13-year-old student at St. Patrick's Catholic School had hoped to show the 
effect of alcohol on the reaction time of adults, using a medium to which 
teen-agers can relate: a Nintendo video game. The project measured the response 
times of 30 adults, ages 35 to 40, who played the simulated-driving game. Each 
subject played four times, sober, and their performance was recorded. 
</P>
<P>
The subjects, all friends of the La Costa teen-ager's family, were then given a 
drink of alcohol every 15 minutes, playing a game between each of the four 
drinks. The results showed that, after the second drink, the subjects' scores 
decreased substantially. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids thought it was pretty funny that the adults were doing so bad on a 
car game," Andy said, adding that most kids who play the game consider it 
"pretty easy." 
</P>
<P>
"Nintendo being so popular with the kids right now, I think the experiment had 
more meaning to the kids and to him," eighth-grade science teacher Peggy 
Coughlin said. 
</P>
<P>
After winning first place at the school's science fair, Andy's project was 
disqualified at the Diocesan Science Fair in February by the Greater San Diego 
Management Committee, a screening committee of the San Diego Science and 
Engineering Fair, which was held in April. 
</P>
<P>
"Our policy on research with human subjects does not allow any kind of research 
that would bring any known psychological or physical risk to any of those 
involved in the experiment," said Phil Gay, a science and math administrator 
for the San Diego Unified School District and the director of the science fair 
screening committee. 
</P>
<P>
This week, however, Andy was honored by the group Mothers Against Drunk Driving 
for his research and focus on the growing problem of alcohol abuse among 
teen-agers, said Cindy Roark, president of the San Diego chapter of MADD. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt that he was right on, and he's going to be our future advocate. It's 
more education for young people," Roark said. 
</P>
<P>
Gay said the committee concluded that the use of alcohol in the experiment 
endangered both Andy and his subjects, even though they were adults. He cited 
research showing that alcohol creates long-term psychological and physical 
effects, particularly the destruction of brain cells. 
</P>
<P>
Gay noted that there had been no medical supervision of the experiment and that 
the amount of alcohol "seemed to be beyond any reasonable likely level of 
consumption." 
</P>
<P>
"It could send a message to students that we might be condoning this type of 
(dangerous) research, and that we weren't abiding by the rules that we stated 
ourselves," Gay said. 
</P>
<P>
Sally Todd, who is in charge of the Diocesan Science Fair, said that, if Andy 
had conducted the experiment with "some type of medical supervisor that 
understood laboratory situations, clinical procedures in this particular area" 
of study, his experiment might have been allowed to be part of the fair. 
</P>
<P>
But Heidi Rock, Andy's mother, said a sober adult was present throughout the 
experiment and no more than four adults were tested at any one time. She noted 
that, even though previous research has shown the ill effects of alcohol, it is 
a basic tenet of science that every conclusion must be rigorously retested. 
</P>
<P>
"If you assume their premise, then you have to say it's ridiculous to retest 
any scientific theory because it's been tested already, and you don't have to 
retest it," Rock said. 
</P>
<P>
When Andy's experiment was disqualified, she said, the screening committee told 
her that "it was entirely inappropriate for a 13-year-old to be exposed to 
adults drinking alcohol." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that (the committee) is willing to face the fact that our 
children are living in a world so different than they're used to, they haven't 
caught up with the world," Rock said. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess they are frightened of what alcohol does to people and that children 
shouldn't be in that kind of environment," Andy said. "Most kids know that 
drinking will affect them, and I just hope that (this experiment) is a reminder 
to them and that they will think first." 
</P>
<P>
"What I would hope is that the Greater San Diego Science Fair would take a look 
at their guidelines, because I think they're outdated," Andy's mother said. "If 
they really seriously think that a 13-year-old cannot be exposed to adults 
drinking in a controlled environment, they've got to update their rules."

OFFICIALS STUMPED BY RETURN OF MARAUDING SEA LIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

First Gumby was spotted taking a nap on a platform in Puget Sound near Seattle. 
Then Colin and Vern showed up at a popular sea lion hangout north of the city. 
And this week, to the dismay of weary marine biologists, George was found in 
the Columbia River between Washington and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
One by one, four of six California sea lions -- packed up by Washington state 
officials in March and sent back to their birthplace near the Channel Islands 
off Ventura County -- have returned to feast on the northwestern state's 
precious steelhead trout. 
</P>
<P>
And Hondo and Sandy, the two other mammals, are expected to reappear in the 
Northwest soon. In fact, one of them was recently spotted on an island off the 
San Francisco coast, marine officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is getting increasingly frustrating," said Doug Zimmer, spokesman for the 
Washington state Department of Wildlife. "We're at the point where our 
steelhead trout cannot take much more abuse, and we're running out of options." 
</P>
<P>
Since sea lions became a protected species in 1972, their West Coast population 
has virtually exploded. They have been running amok from Fisherman's Wharf in 
San Francisco to the waters of Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
In Seattle, the sea lions have eaten so much steelhead trout on their way to 
spawn in tributaries of Lake Washington that the run at the Ballard Locks canal 
has shrunk from about 4,000 fish annually to only 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
Two Indian tribes in Seattle, the Muckleshoot and the Suquamish, have federal 
treaty rights to fish for the trout and have pressured the state and federal 
governments to do something about the carnage. 
</P>
<P>
But nothing seems to keep the animals away, said Martin Fox, a biologist hired 
by the Suquamish. 
</P>
<P>
State and federal officials decided to detonate firecrackers underwater to 
scare away the sea lions, but after a couple of years, the animals became used 
to the sound. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, biologists fired plastic arrows at them, but "they got used to 
being bonked on the head," Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials then turned to feeding them fish laced with a non-lethal substance 
that makes them vomit. But the animals were able to detect the tainted fare 
after a while. 
</P>
<P>
So, in March, Washington wildlife experts decided to capture the six sea lions 
and ship them back to California to see how they would react. 
</P>
<P>
Within a month, Gumby, Colin, George and Vern -- named by Washington wildlife 
officials -- had returned. They could be detected because radio transmitters 
had been glued to their backs. 
</P>
<P>
"We were surprised they came back so fast," said Joe Scordino, a deputy chief 
with the National Marine Fishery Service in Seattle. "I guess they like the 
food up here better." 
</P>
<P>
Scordino said marine officials are now looking for other options to control the 
beasts, which number up to 1,000 in the Seattle area alone. 
</P>
<P>
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is considering asking the 
federal government to allow it to kill the bothersome mammals, an idea that has 
been sharply criticized by environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a bind," Fox said. "We have our fish to protect, but we want to 
protect the animals too."

FAMILY DENIES SLAIN MAN A GANG MEMBER; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: A SATANAS MEMBER DESCRIBES THE WEAPONS AND RACIAL HATRED THAT LED TO THE 
KILLING OF MANUEL RODRIGUEZ. 
</P>

<P>
Outside a murder trial at Ventura County Superior Court on Thursday, the 
parents of a slain 20-year-old and his accused killer tearfully refused to 
admit that youth gangs in Oxnard even exist. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the courtroom, a smooth-faced 17-year-old member of the Satanas 
described the weaponry, racist hatred and gang allegiance that culminated in 
the Nov. 22 slaying. 
</P>
<P>
The two faces of Oxnard gang activity -- death and disbelief -- emerged with 
painful clarity in the trial of Arnel Salagubang, 20, a reputed member of a 
Filipino gang known as the Satanas. 
</P>
<P>
Salagubang is charged with first-degree murder, inflicting great bodily harm 
and use of a weapon in the death of Manuel (Deadeye) Rodriguez, a member of a 
Latino gang called the Lemonwood Chiques. 
</P>
<P>
An imaginary line along Bard Road has always separated Oxnard's Latino and 
Filipino residents, said the victim's grandmother, Stella Geraldo. 
</P>
<P>
But Bard Road has never been a gang turf border, because gangs do not exist in 
Oxnard, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always called Oxnard 'Chiques' so why they call it a gang, I don't 
know," Geraldo said as she waited in the hallway for testimony to resume. 
"Those are his friends, they're not gang members. . . . I've never seen him 
with a gang. He has never carried a weapon. He never carried a knife; he never 
carried a gun; he never came home with black-and-blue marks." 
</P>
<P>
Salagubang "belongs on the other side of Bard Road. Manny belongs on this side, 
Lemonwood," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez's mother, Martha Geraldo, sniffed back tears and said, "Manny had 
just started to change and settle down" when he was killed; he had rented an 
apartment for his girlfriend and their 14-month-old son. 
</P>
<P>
Just down the hallway, the defendant's mother, Presentacion Salagubang, wept 
softly behind dark glasses. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel bad for Arnel's mother. She's crying," Martha Geraldo said. "She's 
losing him too. We buried Manny, but she's not burying her son." 
</P>
<P>
Salagubang's mother declined to comment, but his father said, "Sometimes I 
would think we would be better off dead than in the position he's in right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Felipe Salagubang said he first learned that his son was a gang member at the 
preliminary hearing for his murder trial in January. He had never noticed the 
burn scars that fellow Satanas had put onto his son's hands during initiation, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I still believe that my son didn't do it," Felipe Salagubang said. "He's not 
the type of person that could do this type of crime. He's never been involved 
in any type of crime. His demeanor overall is not violent." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the courtroom, however, a Satanas member told a different story, 
describing how he provided the .22-caliber derringer that Salagubang used to 
kill Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Cortinas testified that Salagubang shot Rodriguez once in the head after 
Rodriguez had cruised past Channel Islands High School shouting challenges and 
racist slurs at a group of Satanas. 
</P>
<P>
"He was challenging all of us," Cortinas testified. 
</P>
<P>
"What was he yelling?" asked defense attorney Willard P. Wiksell. 
</P>
<P>
Cortinas, who has agreed to testify against Salagubang and plead guilty to 
murder in juvenile court to avoid being prosecuted as an adult, replied that 
Rodriquez had shouted several racial slurs derogatory to Asians. 
</P>
<P>
Salagubang said, "Gimme the gat," or gun, Cortinas testified. 
</P>
<P>
Cortinas said he handed the tiny, loaded pistol to Salagubang because he 
believed that Rodriguez was reaching for a gun of his own. 
</P>
<P>
Cortinas testified that Salagubang then walked up to Rodriguez, saying, "You 
want some of this?" 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez replied, "Go ahead, shoot me," and Salagubang shot him, Cortinas 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
Salagubang then hopped into his own car, saying that he had made a "big-time" 
mistake, Cortinas testified. 
</P>
<P>
At the defense table, Salagubang listened, his knees jiggling nervously and 
eyes cast downward to his folded hands. 
</P>
<P>
The trial is scheduled to resume Monday.

SIMI CRITICIZES CRANSTON OVER JORDAN RANCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Simi Valley City Council on Thursday sent a letter to Sen. Alan Cranston 
(D-Calif.) protesting his opposition to a complex land deal that would allow 
development of 59 acres of federal parkland in eastern Ventura County in 
exchange for the state acquiring 5,700 acres of surrounding wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
"The land transfer proposal which is currently being discussed would preserve 
and protect significant open space lands adjacent to Simi Valley for future 
generations," city officials stated in the letter to Cranston. 
</P>
<P>
The letter was sent in reaction to the senator's announcement last week that he 
opposes the land-swap proposal and will work to prevent the use of federal 
funds for the land transfer. Federal money is needed to fund an environmental 
review of the land swap. 
</P>
<P>
Under the land swap proposal, the National Park Service would give up 59 acres 
in Cheeseboro Canyon needed for an access road to a planned golf course and a 
750-house subdivision on property now owned by entertainer Bob Hope. In return, 
the park service would receive 1,100 acres of Hope's 2,308-acre Jordan Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
If the land swap is approved, Hope would sell 5,700 acres in the Santa Susana 
and Santa Monica mountains to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy for $20 
million, an amount that is considered lower than Hope could get from 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston, in his announcement last week, said that rather than permit the land 
deal to take place, the Park Service should work to acquire the Jordan Ranch 
property to protect it from development. 
</P>
<P>
However, Simi Valley Councilwoman Ann Rock, who urged the City Council earlier 
this week to send a letter to Cranston protesting his position, said the land 
swap proposal may be the state's only chance to acquire the 5,700 acres in 
Cheeseboro Canyon for park use. 
</P>
<P>
"I see no other way of acquiring that land," Rock said. "With or without the 
land swap there is going to be a proposal for development" on the Jordan Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie Carpenter, a member of the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District, 
said the district supports Simi Valley's action and will consider writing a 
similar letter to Cranston at its next meeting, onMay 17. 
</P>
<P>
Murray Flander, a Cranston spokesman, said Thursday that the senator had not 
received the letter from Simi Valley officials, but that it would not have any 
bearing on his opposition to the land deal. 
</P>
<P>
"These are irrelevancies to the main issue," Murray said. "The major concern is 
that you're going to have major development inside a national park on land that 
the Interior Department for years has cited as a parcel it wants to get for the 
Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area."

RAPE ARREST IS COUNTY'S FIRST USING DNA TEST; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: OFFICIALS SAY 'GENETIC FINGERPRINTING' LED TO THE ARREST IN THE RAPE OF 
AN ELDERLY WOMAN, USHERING IN A NEW ERA FOR ORANGE COUNTY LAW ENFORCEMENT.

WESTMINSTER 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what law enforcement officials call the first case of its kind in Orange 
County, Westminster police Thursday announced the arrest of a rape suspect on 
the strength of "genetic fingerprinting" involving the use of DNA testing. 
</P>
<P>
The case involved the November rape of a 79-year-old widow at her mobile home 
in Westminster. Classified by police as a suspect at the time, Frank Lee Soto, 
30, of Westminster was arrested Tuesday after results from a DNA testing lab 
linked him genetically to the crime, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Although there have been three other Orange County criminal cases involving use 
of DNA in court evidence, local law enforcement officials said this was the 
first in which genetic testing led directly to an arrest. Westminster Police 
Chief James Cook said that before a genetic match was made between Soto and 
evidence at the crime scene, investigators had only circumstantial evidence 
against the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"We could never have completed this arrest without DNA," Cook said in a press 
conference with Orange County Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates and Dist. Atty. 
Michael R. Capizzi. 
</P>
<P>
Gates and Capizzi, who face opponents in the June 5 election, hailed the arrest 
as 
</P>
<P>
"We now have a tool just a little dissimilar to fingerprints," Gates said. "You 
can put on gloves to hide your fingerprints and a mask to hide your face. (But) 
there's no way to get away if we can identify you with DNA. My best advice (to 
criminals): Don't commit the crime." 
</P>
<P>
Gates and Capizzi both denied that their appearance at the press conference was 
tied to their election campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just here doing our job," Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
Gates faces challenger Don Bankhead, a Fullerton police captain, in June, while 
Capizzi faces Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Avdeef, Assistant Dist. Atty. Edgar A. 
Freeman and Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. James Enright in the nonpartisan race. 
</P>
<P>
Genetic testing was first used successfully to help capture a serial killer in 
Great Britain about five years ago. That case was popularized in Joseph 
Wambaugh's novel, "The Blooding." American prosecutors subsequently began using 
the technique and claimed that they could pinpoint to a 99%-plus accuracy 
whether semen left in a rape victim can be matched to a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
The testing involves studying the unique genetic codes in DNA -- 
deoxyribonucleic acid -- that are found in everything from hair and skin 
samples to blood and other body fluids. 
</P>
<P>
If a match is made between a defendant's blood sample and semen sample, DNA 
specialists say their tests are so accurate, that only one person in a billion 
could be the victim's assailant. 
</P>
<P>
Some scientists have said, however, that DNA fingerprints sometimes stretch and 
shift, making them difficult to read and match. Some Orange County defense 
lawyers also have criticized law enforcement officials for beginning to abandon 
former methods of identification in favor of DNA. 
</P>
<P>
In an article this month in the Scientific American, for example, two 
scientists question the accuracy of DNA testing, saying that, among other 
things, crime scene specimens are often too contaminated by bacteria to be 
reliable. 
</P>
<P>
Cook said DNA will never replace the cop on the street, but "this is a very 
important tool to help the community." 
</P>
<P>
In the Westminster case, the 79-year-old woman answered a knock on the back 
door of her residence on Nov. 17. When the victim opened her door, she was 
confronted by a masked, knife-wielding man who threatened to kill her if she 
did not do as he instructed, Police Investigator Dave McDowell said. The victim 
was pushed into her bedroom, where she was raped. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of blood tests conducted shortly afterward by the Orange County 
Crime Lab, McDowell said it was discovered that Soto has a rare blood type. 
Soto was further identified by the positive DNA match, McDowell said. Police 
declined to say whether the genetic link came from blood, hair or some other 
body fluid left at the rape scene. 
</P>
<P>
Soto was booked into Orange County Jail on suspicion of rape, and bail was set 
at $200,000. His arraignment is set for this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Gates said his office next week will begin processing at least four new DNA 
cases through the sheriff's new genetic testing laboratory, which became fully 
operational this week. The cases involve two rapes, one incest and one child 
abandonment, Gates said, declining to reveal additional details. 
</P>
<P>
Gates' new laboratory is the only DNA laboratory west of the Mississippi and 
one of only six in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
With the new laboratory, Gates said his Orange County Crime Lab will have to 
wait only six to eight weeks to receive DNA testing results, compared to as 
long as six months from the private labs the county has been using. The county 
has been using a laboratory in New York, which is heavily backlogged with other 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi said the genetic testing can be used not only in identifying suspects, 
but in eliminating them as well. To date, Capizzi said, there have been six 
Orange County criminal cases in which suspects were eliminated because they did 
not genetically match evidence found at the scene of a crime. 
</P>
<P>
"It (DNA testing) gives all of us a comfort level in solving some of these 
allegations," Capizzi said. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi said DNA testing has been used in three other Orange County cases, 
including one in which a rape suspect pleaded guilty after being genetically 
linked to a crime. The other two cases, both involving sexual assault, are 
still pending, Capizzi said. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, prosecutors in March obtained their first conviction 
against a suspect arrested on the basis of DNA testing. Henry Wilds, 34, was 
sentenced to 42 years in prison for a series of rapes and robberies in the 
North Hollywood area.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FINANCIALLY AILING HOSPITAL TO SELL LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Pedro Peninsula Hospital, which has struggled for a year to improve its 
finances, is about to sell a parcel of land to get money for capital projects. 
</P>
<P>
President John Wilson announced the proposed sale at a recent meeting in San 
Pedro, where he released a report on the hospital's financial condition. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said the hospital has accepted a $4.7-million offer for 17 contiguous 
lots that now house an old medical building and parking lots. The hospital 
would use the money to improve the facilities of its maternal and child health 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson declined to release the identity of the buyer until the deal is closed. 
</P>
<P>
The land sale is part of the hospital's drive to pull itself back from severe 
financial difficulty. In early 1989, it had accumulated losses of $9 million 
leading to layoffs and program cutback. By the end of 1989, the deficit was 
reduced to $1.3 million, Wilson said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA MONICA MOVES TO BAN TROPICAL TIMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has moved to make Santa Monica the nation's first city to ban 
the use of tropical timber in construction as a protest against destruction of 
rain forests. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 5 to 1 this week to ask City Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Myers to research the legality of an ordinance similar to one proposed 
in Berkeley that would prohibit the use of exotic woods. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance would ban tropical timber in municipal and private projects in 
the coastal community. Suppliers would have to provide written statements 
certifying that their wood is not from tropical rain forests. Councilman David 
Finkel, who proposed the ban, said the city's commitment to environmental 
issues makes the law appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Only the University of North Carolina has passed such a ban. Massachusetts 
lawmakers are considering a statewide ban. 
</P>
<P>
Similar campaigns are under way in West Germany, where 30 local councils have 
stopped using exotic woods, and in Holland, where 40% of the municipalities are 
reducing their tropical timber use.

for stick huts without running water. 
</P>
<P>
But as she embarks on her two-year stint this summer, Meehan will make history 
by joining the Peace Corps' first mission to the Eastern Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic uprisings have landed her a job teaching English in Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
Although the conditions in Central Europe may not be as backward as in other 
host countries, the challenges will be just as great, Meehan said. "The 
Hungarians are highly educated," she said. "I'll be under a lot of pressure to 
meet their high standards." 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in the Peace Corps' 28-year history, volunteers are 
venturing into Hungary and Poland to teach English. International talks are 
under way to send volunteers to East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria, said 
Peace Corps spokeswoman Paula Kuzmich. 
</P>
<P>
"We are following the path of democracy around the world," Kuzmich said. 
</P>
<P>
The Peace Corps selected Meehan to join the first 120 volunteers to represent 
the United States in these countries. Meehan spent two summers teaching English 
to Japanese students studying in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
With a degree in English and another one in journalism on the way, the Peace 
Corps considers her well qualified for the job. Meehan initially expected to 
work as a volunteer in North Africa or the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
To prepare herself, she studied French, the tongue of many North African 
countries, and sign language, so she could work with deaf Filipino children. 
</P>
<P>
"I've lived in Ventura for 20 years and I just thought it was time to do 
something else," said the 38-year-old substitute teacher for Rio Elementary 
School District in Oxnard. "I wanted to do something where I could immerge 
myself in a culture and really be with the people." CAROLYN KUSKY

MAN ARRESTED OVER 3 BANK ROBBERIES

<P>
An Oxnard man was being held Thursday in Ventura County Jail on suspicion of 
robbing three banks, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Murillo Martinez, 32, turned himself in Wednesday night after learning 
that he was a suspect in three Oxnard bank robberies that occurred in October, 
February and April, said FBI Special Agent Gary Auer. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez was being held in lieu of $35,000 bail, Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
Information from witnesses and videotapes taken during the holdups led FBI 
agents to believe that Martinez was responsible for the Oct. 31, 1989, robbery 
at the American Savings Bank, the Feb. 9 robbery at the First Nationwide Bank 
and the April 20 robbery at a branch of the Security Pacific National Bank, 
Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
If Martinez is convicted on federal bank robbery charges, he could be sentenced 
to a maximum of 20 years and a $5,000 fine for each robbery, Auer said. CAROLYN

HOUSE SEARCHED IN HACKER INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Secret Service searched a house in Ventura this week to gather 
evidence for Operation Sundevil, a two-year national investigation into 
computer hackers who are suspected of committing credit-card fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura Police Department helped execute the search warrant, one of 24 
served in 16 cities nationwide Monday and Tuesday, said Richard Griffin, 
special agent in charge of the Los Angeles field office of the U.S. Secret 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
Seven of the warrants were executed in the Los Angeles area, Griffin said. The 
U.S. Secret Service, the U.S. attorney's office and the attorney general of 
Arizona were provided with technical assistance for tracking down suspects by 
telecommunications companies, such as Pacific Bell, Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
The computer hackers are suspected of gaining access to and using information 
from other computers, long-distance dialing codes and credit-card numbers, 
Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the losses from those activities may run into the millions 
of dollars, said Wendy Harnagel of the U.S. attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Criminal charges will follow in the next several months, after agents have 
processed information from 23,000 floppy disks and handwritten material seized 
in the nationwide searches, Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
The hackers are suspected of belonging to underground groups that were formed 
to exchange information relevant to their criminal activities through their 
computers, Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin said the U.S. Secret Service has noticed that an alarming number of 
people adept at computer science are using their skills for crime, mistakenly 
believing that they can avoid detection. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Secret Service has jurisdiction over computer fraud and credit-card 
fraud.

MODEL OF OLYMPIC TRAINING CENTER, PLANNED FOR CHULA VISTA, IS DISPLAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Olympic silver medalist Jeanne Collier Sitzberger chipped a tooth diving in a 
shallow pool during training. 
</P>
<P>
"To practice diving during the winter, we would have to drive overnight from 
Southern California to a pool in Arizona," said the 1964 Olympian. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Toomey, a 29-year old high school teacher when he won his 1968 gold medal 
in the decathlon, trained for track and field events without proper facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"If a high school teacher can train himself to become a gold medalist, just 
think of what our athletes can achieve now with world class training centers 
available," said Toomey, now 51. 
</P>
<P>
Toomey came a step closer to seeing a dream turn into reality with the 
unveiling Thursday of a full-scale model of the United States Olympic Training 
Center/San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The $59-million training facility will open in 1992 on 150 acres on the shores 
of the Lower Otay Reservoir in Chula Vista, according to Toomey, now a 
corporate fund-raiser for the San Diego National Sports Foundation. The 
nonprofit foundation was established in 1987 to raise money for the facility. 
</P>
<P>
The center, the country's first warm weather, year-round training center, will 
be the third operated by the United States Olympic Committee. The Olympic 
Committee also operates training centers at its headquarters in Colorado 
Springs and Lake Placid, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
The Olympic Committee "is excited about the prospect of the new Olympic 
Training Center in San Diego because we finally have a state-of-the-art 
facility in California where a huge number of our 1992 Olympic team members 
currently live," said Robert L. Helmick, president of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, California has on several occasions provided as many as one-third 
of the members of our summer Olympic teams." 
</P>
<P>
The first phase will give particular emphasis to Olympic sports not fully 
served at existing training centers, including archery, track and field, 
canoe-kayaking, cycling, field hockey, soccer, and water polo. 
</P>
<P>
To support these sports, the complex will house a sports medicine and testing 
facility, a boat house and a 2,000-meter regatta course, a 50-meter pool, 
residence for more than 300 athletes and a visitor's center, Olympic officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
The focal point of the visitor's center will be the open-air "Court of 
Champions" for ceremonies and small presentations. A large tile map of the 
United States will be inlaid with medallions, one for every Olympic medalist 
from each state. 
</P>
<P>
Planning for the athletic complex was begun in 1987 by the San Diego National 
Sports Foundation. The nonprofit fund-raising group, headed by former San Diego 
Councilwoman Gloria McColl, has raised $39 million toward its $59-million goal, 
foundation officials said.

NEW AMBULANCE STATION TO OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A new ambulance station is expected to open near Moorpark in a few days, 
despite one city official's criticism that it is outside the city. 
</P>
<P>
Pruner Ambulance owner Don Pruner said Thursday a fully staffed station will 
open at 2201 Olsen Road. 
</P>
<P>
The company has provided Moorpark residents with emergency ambulance service 
from stations in Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The new station, within two miles of Moorpark's city limits, is expected to 
trim three minutes off the average response time for ambulances, Pruner said. 
That would make the average response eight minutes. Ambulances will carry a 
paramedic and an emergency medical technician. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have been calling for a new station to serve the Moorpark area 
after noting that ambulances were arriving up to 30 minutes after they were 
called. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, City Councilman Clint Harper said the station represents an 
improvement in service but said ambulances ought to be based within the city 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
Harper and Councilwoman Eloise A. Brown are scheduled to discuss ambulance 
service today with officials of Ventura County Emergency Medical Services, the 
county agency that contracts with the company. 
</P>
<P>
Pruner, the company president, said the station is less than six miles to city 
hall and the center of downtown. Ambulances arrive well within the 15-minute 
response time required by the county in the company's contract to serve cities 
in the eastern part of the county, he said. PSYCHE PASCUAL

HOMEOWNERS AWARDED $8.1 MILLION FOR DEFECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what was believed to be the largest award in a construction-defect case in 
San Diego, a Tierrasanta homeowners' association has won an $8.1-million 
judgment against a builder, who, in the jury's opinion, constructed homes that 
were unlivable and unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict, amounting to $162,000 for each of the 50 single-family homes, was 
delivered Tuesday to El Cajon Superior Court Judge Dennis Adams and announced 
by the homeowners' association Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The action against Christiana Community Builders was first filed in March, 
1985, and may be appealed, attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
At issue in the suit were leaky roofs, poorly compacted soil, inadequate 
foundations and substandard attic framing that homeowners in the Villa 
Dominique Courts residential development in Tierrasanta say were caused by 
Christiana. 
</P>
<P>
The homes were constructed from 1978 to 1980 on Mayita Way, Oporto Court, 
Oporto Place, Ocana Street and Quito Court and, according to the lawsuit, were 
beset by leaky roofs almost immediately. Christiana agreed to make repairs 
until late 1984, but ignored all requests after that, the suit alleged. 
</P>
<P>
"We expected Christiana to honor their contractual obligation," said Jim Price, 
president of the homeowners' association since 1985. "What we got were bubble 
gum and Band-Aids. Nothing they did made our homes livable." 
</P>
<P>
"Elated? Very much so," said J. Michael Reed, the lawyer for the homeowners. 
"The verdict was a little bit better than we expected." 
</P>
<P>
Reed said he believed that the outcome of the case hinged on the testimony of 
expert witnesses, such as architects and soil experts, who said the homes would 
suffer extensive damage in the event of an earthquake greater than 6.0 on the 
Richter scale. 
</P>
<P>
"The jury told us our architectural expert came across as the most honest 
person they'd ever met," Reed said. "Whereas, they said the soils person for 
the other side was not credible. They said even his body language gave him 
away." 
</P>
<P>
Reed said symptoms of the damage included water leaking into the home "every 
time it rained," in addition to cracks in the foundation slabs, "entire roofs 
having to be replaced," and so on. 
</P>
<P>
Price, the president of the homeowners' association, said, "The problems were 
so bad that many owners sold their homes and left the area." 
</P>
<P>
Reed said that, if the decision is not appealed, money could be awarded to the 
plaintiffs' fund within 60 days, with improvements commencing almost 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Executives with Christiana were unavailable for comment.

B-17 BOMBER FLYING IN FOR AIRCRAFT MEET

<TEXT>
<P>
Don't be alarmed if you see a giant bomber flying over Ventura County today. 
Its mission is peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
The B-17, one of about 10 of the planes still in existence, is flying in from 
Visalia to help kick off the Camarillo Experimental Aircraft Assn.'s swap meet 
and aircraft display at the Camarillo Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The four-engine bomber will be escorted by a Camarillo-based Navy SNJ, which, 
like the B-17, was used extensively during World War II. The planes are 
scheduled to rendezvous over Fillmore at 11:30 a.m. and fly in formation to the 
airport, where they will be on display through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The B-17 is being supplied by the Confederate Air Force, a nonprofit historical 
group. About 13,000 B-17s were built in the late 1930s and early 1940s, but 
today only about 10 remain capable of flying. GARY GORMAN

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: STUNT FLYERS PLAY IN 'BOXES' FOR AEROBATICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
High above orange groves near Santa Paula, stunt planes regularly dip, dive and 
roll in one of two "boxes" or airspaces set aside for aerobatics in Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Designated by the Federal Aviation Administration at the request of pilots, the 
boxes are like giant playpens for stunt pilots, said David Flick, an aviation 
safety inspector for the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
But commercial aircraft and private planes of all types may enter the 
airspaces, which are away from congested airports and clearly marked as stunt 
boxes on aviation charts, Flick said. Stunt pilots have to remain aware at all 
times of other planes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big responsibility," said Rich Stowell, a professional stunt instructor 
based at Santa Paula Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Stowell, 32, of Ventura, was hanging upside-down recently in a single-engine 
plane in the 7-mile-long by 2-mile-wide box above South Mountain Road. His 
parachute strapped to his back, he was demonstrating a roll. 
</P>
<P>
"Watch the left wing," he advised a passenger. "Halfway through, you'll feel a 
little light in your seat." 
</P>
<P>
The move perfectly executed, Stowell took a breather to explain that he is 
afraid of heights and does not enjoy roller coasters. Then he demonstrated a 
"hammerhead," flipping the plane over sideways, heading straight down to the 
ground 2,000 feet below and pulling up at the last minute. JANET BERGAMO

VALENS' STAR TO SHINE IN HOLLYWOOD TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Famed Latino rocker Ritchie Valens, whose death in a 1959 plane crash with 
Buddy Holly is still considered one of the greatest tragedies in popular music 
history, will be honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame today. 
</P>
<P>
A ceremony unveiling the star is to be held at 12:30 p.m. at 6733 Hollywood 
Blvd., according to the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is long overdue," Judy Rocha, secretary of the Ritchie Valens 
Recognition Committee, said Thursday. "He has never received the recognition he 
deserved. It was up to us to do something about that." 
</P>
<P>
Members of Valens' family, including two sisters and two brothers, are expected 
to attend the ceremony, along with actor Lou Diamond Phillips, who starred in 
the movie, "La Bamba," about Valens' life, Rocha said. The Valens star will be 
the 1,913th such award on the Walk of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Valens, whose real name was Richard Valenzuela, rose from obscurity as a 
teen-age guitar player in Pacoima to become an internationally known performer 
on the strength of hits such as "Come On, Let's Go" and "Donna," a love song 
about his high school girlfriend. His rollicking version of the folk song, "La 
Bamba," became a standard in greatest hits packages of the 1950s and helped 
clear the way for a generation of Latino rock 'n' rollers from Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
He also recorded three gold albums. 
</P>
<P>
Valens became a legend when the plane in which he was riding with Holly and J. 
P. (Big Bopper) Richardson crashed shortly after takeoff in a Feb. 3, 1959, 
snowstorm in Clear Lake, Iowa. Holly was an established star, but Valens was 
only 17 when he died. 
</P>
<P>
"When Ritchie died, we felt cheated," Gil Rocha, whose Mexican combo the 
Silhouettes first gave Valens a chance to play, said recently. "He was our 
hometown hero." 
</P>
<P>
Valens' fame and influence continued to grow after his death, culminating in 
the production of the recent movie, "La Bamba." 
</P>
<P>
Friends of Valens organized the Ritchie Valens Recognition Committee in 1987 to 
campaign for a Walk of Fame star. The committee raised $3,500 to pay for 
installation of the star by holding a dance at the American Legion Hall in San 
Fernando, where Valens first played in public. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony will be followed by a tribute to Valens at the Chuck Landis 
Country Club in Reseda at 8 p.m., featuring Ernie Valens, a cousin who performs 
many of Ritchie's songs in an evocative style. Also performing will be Bobby 
Cochran, a nephew of rocker Eddie Cochran, and Rosie of Rosie and the 
Originals, whose hit "Angel Baby" became an anthem of teen-age romance.

'CHEERS' ACTOR IS ORDERED TO STAND TRIAL ON DRUG CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA KLEIN LERNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
Two judges took action Thursday against actor Kelsey Grammer, a star of the 
"Cheers" TV series, in separate cases involving failure to enroll in alcohol 
and drug abuse programs. 
</P>
<P>
Grammer surrendered to a Van Nuys Municipal Court judge, who had issued an 
arrest warrant for him last week, and was ordered to stand trial on a cocaine 
possession charge. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, another judge in the same courthouse scheduled a probation 
violation hearing into Grammer's failure to enroll in a court-ordered alcohol 
abuse program stemming from a 1987 drunk-driving arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Grammer, who plays the comically egotistical psychiatrist, Dr. Frasier Crane, 
on the popular NBC television series, was surrounded by reporters and 
photographers as he entered the courthouse to surrender to Judge Aviva K. Bobb. 
The judge last week issued an arrest warrant because Grammer failed to appear 
in court to prove he had completed a drug rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
Grammer's attorney, Robert L. Diamond, requested that Grammer be given another 
chance to take part in the program, which allows first-time drug offenders to 
avoid jail and expunge the arrest from their records. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond said Grammer failed to attend the course because his fiancee suffers 
from a seizure disorder requiring constant medical supervision. 
</P>
<P>
"We all have other responsibilities," Bobb responded, and ordered Grammer 
arrested. She scheduled a preliminary hearing on the cocaine charge for May 21 
and set bail of $7,500. He faces a maximum three-year jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Grammer, 35, of Van Nuys, said that he thought he "was supposed to show up on 
the 8th. It was just an oversight. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been going through a time with my girlfriend who's been very ill. It has 
interfered with my complying with the court," said Grammer. The actor said his 
girlfriend underwent brain surgery two weeks ago, and the couple went on a 
cruise to Mexico while she recovered. "I'm ready to go now," he added. 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing in Bobb's court, Grammer was taken before Judge Patricia 
Gorner Schwartz in a courtroom six floors below. Schwartz issued an arrest 
warrant for Grammer on Feb. 6 after he failed to complete 10 days of community 
service and an alcohol rehabilitation program imposed after he pleaded no 
contest to drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
Grammer was sentenced to community service for previously failing to show up in 
court to prove that he was enrolled in the alcohol program, court records show.

FISHERMEN SAY BAN WOULD DOOM A WAY OF LIFE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A proposed ban on using gill nets for near-shore fishing in Southern California 
has been a hot topic of discussion in recent days at Canetti's Seafood Grotto, 
the traditional early-morning gathering place for San Pedro fishermen. Many 
fear that the proposal, if it becomes law, could end their decades-old way of 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"We get accused of raping the ocean," said Joe Cracchiolo, president of the Los 
Angeles Fisherman's Cooperative Assn. in San Pedro. "But we are 
environmentalists too. To kill fish, that is our business, but we more than 
anyone want to maintain the health of the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
The initiative would ban the use of the nearly invisible monofilament nets by 
1994 anywhere within three miles of the coast between the Mexican border and 
Point Conception. Gill nets, which kill fish by immobilizing them, have been 
blamed for the deaths of non-game fish and mammals in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Cracchiolo and others admit that the nets kill sea lions and an occasional gray 
whale, but they say that sea lions are not endangered in this area and that 
their numbers are growing. They also admit that about 25% of what they catch 
can't be sold and is thrown overboard. But they say much of that is alive. 
</P>
<P>
Local fishermen say there are about 250 men who fish commercially out of San 
Pedro and that many of them use gill nets, particularly for halibut. Although 
there are alternatives to gill nets, such as lines and more visible nets, 
halibut are not easily caught by those methods, the fishermen say. 
</P>
<P>
If gill nets are banned, Cracchiolo and others say, some local fishermen will 
be forced out of business. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists counter that the nets kill indiscriminately and threaten the 
near-shore marine ecosystems. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not efficient. They are simply cheap and wasteful," said Scott 
Trimingham, president of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, an 
international ocean preservation group based in Redondo Beach. "There are other 
ways of fishing and making a living. But we are not a job placement agency, and 
changes to protect our environment may adversely affect some people." 
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted between 1983 and 1989 by the state Department of Fish and 
Game, which is officially neutral, shows between six and 12 whales killed by 
gill nets annually. Between 800 and 1,000 deaths of seals and sea lions were 
attributed to the nets in the 1986-87 fishing season, said Doyle Hanan, 
coordinator of the department's marine mammal program. He said only one dolphin 
was known to be killed by gill nets in the survey period. 
</P>
<P>
But environmentalists charge that some dolphin, whale and shark kills go 
unreported. Trimingham cites as evidence dead dolphins that have been found 
with their tails cut off, indicating that they were trapped in nets and cut 
loose by fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
Hannon of Fish and Game said fishermen have accepted compromises in recent 
years to reduce incidental deaths, such as increasing the size of net openings 
to allow younger fish to pass through unscathed and building break points in 
the nets to allow marine mammals to escape more easily. 
</P>
<P>
Some fishermen say pollution and such popular activities as whale-watching are 
more destructive to marine life than gill-netting. 
</P>
<P>
Gill-netters in San Pedro accuse the sportfishing lobby, which also supports 
the measure, of cynically drawing environmentalists into the fight simply to 
remove competition for fish. 
</P>
<P>
"There are 2 million sportfishermen in California, and only about 250 of us," 
said Andy Kuglis, a 79-year-old who has fished off San Pedro for nearly 60 
years. "They catch more fish than we do. But we are a small minority. We are 
easy to fight."

JORDAN RANCH LAND EXCHANGE DECISION PUT OFF; 
</P>
<P>
PARKLAND: A HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE DELAYED ACTION AT THE URGING OF REP. BEILENSON, 
WHO HAS MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT THE DEAL WITH BOB HOPE.

<P>
The chairman of a key House subcommittee agreed Thursday to postpone a decision 
on whether to block a controversial land exchange involving federal parkland in 
Cheeseboro Canyon and property owned by entertainer Bob Hope. 
</P>
<P>
"All right, we'll be glad to wait," said Rep. Sidney R. Yates (D-Ill.), 
chairman of the interior subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee, in 
response to a request by Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson, who has been lobbied heavily by both sides in the controversy, told 
the panel he had mixed feelings about the proposed exchange of 59 acres owned 
by the National Park Service in Cheeseboro Canyon for 1,100 acres of the 
adjacent Jordan Ranch in eastern Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson said later that before taking a position he wanted to see the Park 
Service's environmental impact statement and a separate environmental impact 
review that Ventura County is expected to produce next month. 
</P>
<P>
Potomac Investment Associates, which has obtained an option to purchase the 
Jordan property from Hope, wants to build a golf course and 750 homes on the 
ranch but needs the Cheeseboro parcel for an access road. Both properties are 
located within the boundaries of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation 
Area. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with intense public criticism about his vast holdings within the 
recreation area, Hope sweetened the deal last month by agreeing to transfer 
about 5,700 acres he owns in the Santa Susana and Santa Monica mountains to 
park agencies for a below-market $20 million if the Cheeseboro-Jordan Ranch 
swap is approved. His proposal was praised by some conservationists but did not 
appease critics who maintain that the Park Service should not promote 
development. 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee, which oversees funding for national parks, has been flooded 
with letters and phone calls from both sides in the Jordan Ranch controversy, 
Yates said. Foes have asked Yates to include language in the Interior 
Department's appropriations bill for 1991 that would prohibit the Park Service 
from using any federal funds to proceed with the exchange for one year. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) announced last week that he would urge the 
interior subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee to insert such a 
provision in next year's Interior appropriations bill. He became the first 
elected official to oppose the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson appeared before Yates' subcommittee to ask for $33 million to buy 
parkland in the mountains as well as $3 million to fund elephant protection in 
Africa under a 1988 elephant conservation bill he authored. 
</P>
<P>
But before he had a chance to discuss either subject, Yates asked, "What do you 
want us to do about Jordan Ranch?" 
</P>
<P>
Neither the ranch nor Cheeseboro Canyon are in Beilenson's 23rd District, which 
extends from the West Valley over the Santa Monicas to the Westside. But he 
wrote the 1978 bill that created the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation 
Area and is the leading congressional advocate of preserving significant 
stretches of the mountains as parkland. 
</P>
<P>
"It's far from clear what the course should be," Beilenson replied after 
stating his ambivalence about the proposed exchange. "On the one hand, one 
worries about a park making available even a modest amount of acreage, as would 
be the case in this particular instance, which would allow development. 
</P>
<P>
"But on the other hand, the park, in return, would get some wonderful acreage, 
and it's been getting better slowly and that's one reason I would like to wait 
a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Beilenson said: "There's going to be development in Jordan Ranch no 
matter what. The question is, in a sense, whether the park can and/or should 
get something in return." 
</P>
<P>
In response to a question by Yates about the possibility of purchasing the 
entire 2,308-acre Jordan Ranch as parkland -- a position advocated by land-swap 
opponents -- Beilenson said, "It's too expensive." He estimated the ranch's 
value at $20 million to $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the swap maintain that without the exchange and the access road 
through Cheeseboro Canyon, Jordan Ranch would be valued at less than $20 
million. They also point out that current zoning permits the construction of no 
more than 14 homes on its land. 
</P>
<P>
"We're disappointed in his position," Donald J. Hellmann, an attorney for the 
Wilderness Society and a leading opponent of the swap, said following 
Beilenson's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Yates' subcommittee is expected to begin deliberations on the Interior 
appropriations bill next month. Hellmann had asked Yates during a March 7 
hearing to prohibit the park service from proceeding with the exchange in the 
funding bill. 
</P>
<P>
In his testimony on the Santa Monica Mountains, Beilenson asked for $23 million 
to complete the acquisition of lands along the Backbone Trail in Zuma and 
Trancas canyons and to buy one of two private properties in Corral Canyon in 
Malibu. The Backbone Trail stretches along the Santa Monicas from Will Rogers 
State Park in Pacific Palisades to Point Mugu State Park in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
He also asked for $10 million to help fund the purchase of one or more 
additional properties in the mountains, including land adjacent to the Circle X 
Ranch, land adjacent to Rancho Sierra Vista in Ventura County, lands in 
Topanga, Tuna or Temescal canyons, and the Rancho Sierra Vista-Leo Carillo 
connection. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of providing outdoor activities for the greatest number of people now 
and in the future, there is probably no better use of limited federal park 
funds," Beilenson said of the Santa Monica Mountains acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
The $33-million request was supported by other California lawmakers, including 
Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) and Cranston. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush proposed $11.55 million for the Santa Monicas out of a total of 
$80 million for parkland acquisition nationwide. The Santa Monicas received $12 
million last year, the largest amount ever. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to the House interior subcommittee said that the $11.55 million 
proposed by Bush is a more realistic figure than the $33 million sought by 
Beilenson, given budget constraints.

SCHOOLS: A STATE COMMITTEE WANTS TO LOOK AT REORGANIZATION ON A STATEWIDE 
BASIS, RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON JUST THE LOS ANGELES DISTRICT.

Opening a new front in the fight to break up the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, a state Board of Education committee Thursday recommended spending 
$250,000 to develop models for school district reorganizations throughout the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of dividing the Los Angeles district hope that by approaching the 
issue statewide, they can win support from legislators who must approve the 
funding and are wary of focusing only on Los Angeles schools. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Education's Policy and Planning Committee voted 4 to 1 to 
recommend that the full board, scheduled to meet today, support development of 
guidelines to reorganize extremely small school districts as well as large. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm encouraged that the entire board will accept it," said Assemblywoman 
Marian W. La Follette (R-Northridge), who for years has maintained that the 
610,000-student Los Angeles district is too large. 
</P>
<P>
Still, La Follette must persuade skeptical legislators, facing shortages in 
state revenues, to earmark the funds in the state budget being drawn up for the 
fiscal year that begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian in January set aside $250,000 in his proposed state 
spending plan to study reorganizing the Los Angeles district. But members of 
two legislative budget subcommittees this week voiced reservations about 
appropriating the money to look at that district only. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Robert J. Campbell (D-Richmond), chairman of a key Ways and Means 
subcommittee that reviewed La Follette's proposal, cautioned that the state 
"ought to be careful about telling a local district what to do." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, La Follette on Thursday sought to round up support for her 
compromise statewide proposal. She also suggested that if more money is 
necessary, it could be provided by private corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Voting against the proposal was Kenneth L. Peters of Tarzana, former 
superintendent of schools in Beverly Hills. Peters said he agrees that the Los 
Angeles district has too many students. But he said the state Board of 
Education does not have its own staff to oversee the development of plans to 
overhaul school boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how you resolve it . . . for $250,000," Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, board President Joseph Carrabino of Encino, a professor emeritus 
at the UCLA Graduate School of Management, said he supports the appropriation 
and breakup of the district. Carrabino, who is not a member of the committee 
but attended the hearing, described the district as "a big Pentagon-type 
structure that's paralyzed. It's muscle-bound." 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Prescott, a lobbyist for the Los Angeles district, defended the district 
as well-administered and questioned whether smaller districts could be operated 
as efficiently. Prescott said the district is taking a wait-and-see attitude on 
the results of any study conducted by the state. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our bottom line is what the plan would produce," he said. "Would it in 
effect help us achieve more for the kids?" 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Los Angeles school officials have also said attempts to break up 
the district would probably face legal challenge on grounds that such a plan 
would create more segregated districts. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a task force formed by La Follette reported that dividing the Los 
Angeles district into at least eight and as many as 49 smaller districts would 
improve academic performance and reduce the number of dropouts. 
</P>
<P>
According to La Follette, the report showed that the district is "incapable of 
addressing the legitimate education needs of Los Angeles-area students." 
</P>
<P>
For much of the past decade, La Follette has championed plans to restructure 
the district. In 1988, a La Follette bill to appropriate $215,000 for a study 
on school district size failed in the Assembly Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Six years earlier, the Legislature allocated $100,000 for a study that, among 
other things, concluded that the best alternative would be to dissolve the Los 
Angeles Unified School District and other districts in Los Angeles County and 
create a number of new, autonomous ones.

Embry to a two-year term as a regular public member. 
</P>
<P>
Embry, a Thousand Oaks resident who has served the last two years as the 
commission's alternate public member, will take office June 20. 
</P>
<P>
He replaces James E. Gordon, an Ojai resident who has served on the commission

Larry Rose, former head of the Ventura County Farm Bureau's Land Use Committee, 
was chosen as LAFCO's new alternate public member. 
</P>
<P>
The appointments were made by the two county supervisors and two city 
councilmen who sit on the five-member agency. Members usually serve two-year 
terms as alternates before serving a second two years as regular members.

Two robbers tied up a video store owner and threatened him with a shotgun 
Thursday while they stole an undetermined number of videotapes and $100 in 
cash, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The robbers walked into Odyssey Video at 16481 Springdale St. about 2:40 p.m. 
when no other customers were inside, locked the door and put up the closed 
sign, Police Lt. Roger Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
The pair tied up the owner, identified as Tuyen Thien Dao, 53, of Irvine, with 
a telephone cord and spent about 10 minutes ransacking the store, looking for 
money, Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
Dao was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
Both men were described as being Asian, about 5 feet, 3 inches tall and 
weighing about 115 pounds, with short black hair. One man was wearing a white 
glove on his left hand, and the other was wearing a black leather jacket, 
Parker said.

BRAUDE PROPOSALS FOR MINIBUS, RUSH-HOUR LANE GAIN SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Proposals to spend $1.2 million to start a fixed-route minibus service between 
Sherman Oaks and Studio City and to make a lane of Sepulveda Boulevard 
reversible to speed rush-hour traffic were unveiled Thursday by Los Angeles 
City Councilman Marvin Braude and quickly endorsed by Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
Braude said the money would come from funds raised by the countywide half-cent 
Proposition A sales tax, which is supposed to pay for transportation 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, which is debating how to spend the Proposition A funds, must 
approve the spending. 
</P>
<P>
Braude, who represents the Ventura Boulevard area in the west San Fernando 
Valley, said he was hopeful that the projects would easily win council approval 
because the city's Proposition A fund has a surplus. 
</P>
<P>
"The money is already there, sitting in the bank and not being used," the 
lawmaker said. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Braude, Bradley said the projects were similar to ones that he 
had urged the city to adopt in March, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Nate Holden, chairman of the council's transportation committee, 
said he wanted to review the status of the Proposition A fund surplus before 
taking a position on the Braude proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Rapid Transit District board member Nicholas Patsaouras, 
who joined Braude in introducing the projects, said the minibuses could be 
running within three months. 
</P>
<P>
The shuttle buses would require a $1.1-million subsidy in the first year. 
</P>
<P>
That project calls for six buses to run 15 hours daily along a route that would 
pick up passengers at several stops within the Van Nuys Civic Center, at Valley 
College and along the Ventura Boulevard commercial corridor. 
</P>
<P>
An RTD staff study found that the route, one of five studied, would have the 
most ridership and would best supplement the existing RTD routes, Patsaouras 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers would pay 25 cents and would be able to transfer to regular RTD 
buses without paying any additional fare. 
</P>
<P>
The reversible lane project would cost $100,000 annually and would have the 
effect, during the morning rush hour, of adding an additional lane for cars 
traveling south on Sepulveda Boulevard between the Ventura Freeway and 
Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, the direction of traffic in that lane would be reversed. 
</P>
<P>
The two projects would help bring equity to the distribution of the 
transportation funds, Braude said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Valley has not had its fair share of Prop. A funds in the past," he said.

COMMUTER BUS FARES BOOSTED TO DISCOURAGE OUT-OF-TOWNERS; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA CLARITA: ANTELOPE VALLEY RESIDENTS USE THE CITY'S SUBSIDIZED LINE TO SAVE 
MONEY ON TRIPS TO DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES.

Forget the Antelope Valley. Call it the Interlope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
A number of residents from the Antelope Valley have been using a commuter bus 
service, subsidized by the city of Santa Clarita, to ride to work in downtown 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The reason: A commuter line from the Antelope Valley to downtown Los Angeles 
charges $155 a month. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clarita line was $65. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned that the practice could become widespread, the Santa Clarita City 
Council has decided to more than double the monthly fees for non-Santa Clarita 
Valley residents to $132. 
</P>
<P>
"We have found that commuters from the Antelope Valley are car-pooling to our 
city and board our commuter buses to take advantage of our lower fares," Public 
Works Director John Medina wrote in a memo to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, the council also approved a $10 fare increase for Santa 
Clarita Valley residents, raising the monthly fee to $75. 
</P>
<P>
The $75 fee would cover about half the cost of running five 47-seat buses that 
carry riders between Santa Clarita homes and Los Angeles offices each weekday. 
</P>
<P>
Medina said the fare increases probably will discourage commuters from the 
Antelope Valley from taking Santa Clarita buses and will provide extra funds 
for Santa Clarita to expand its commuter bus program. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials don't want fares to rise too much, Medina said, because "we 
have to make sure we don't start losing riders." 
</P>
<P>
There were three commuter buses when the city was created two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Demand has continued to rise and now the city is considering the addition of a 
sixth bus, Medina said.

BRAVE GIRL WHO WON HEARTS OF MANY DIES OF LEUKEMIA

A memorial service for Christina Schnabl, a schoolgirl whose courage in 
battling leukemia captured the hearts of hundreds of strangers, including 
President Bush, will be held Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The 9-year-old student at Wagner Elementary School in Placentia died Tuesday at 
Western Medical Center in Santa Ana, where she had been hospitalized since she 
learned in January that she was suffering from an aggressive form of leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
Christina's parents, Jerry and Linda, along with the Covina-based Life-Savers 
Foundation worked throughout her illness, but without success, to find a bone 
marrow donor. A transplant would have dramatically increased her chances of 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
"Her situation is a situation happening around the country," said Chuck Pruitt, 
director of recruitment for donors at the Life-Savers Foundation. "There are 
just not enough donors available to help people in need. We are working hard to 
find donors but unfortunately it didn't happen in enough time for Christina." 
</P>
<P>
More than $20,000 for research and the costs associated with the search for a 
marrow donor was raised by classmates at Wagner school, the Cal State Fullerton 
women's softball team, where Christina was a bat girl, and Allstate Insurance 
Cos. 
</P>
<P>
"We all understood that Christina was very ill and worked hard to find possible 
donors," said Wagner Principal Dale Downey. "But we knew she probably would not 
get better, and on Monday we told the other third-graders that her condition 
wasn't improving and that she wouldn't be returning to class." 
</P>
<P>
A family member contacted President Bush, who in March wrote to Christina, 
wishing her well and calling her an "inspiration to all who know you." 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service will be held at noon Saturday at San Antonio Catholic Church 
in Anaheim Hills, 5800 E. Santa Ana Canyon Road. The family requested that 
donations be sent to the Life-Savers Foundation of America.

4 HONORED FOR ROLE IN CATCHING ARSON SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four North Hollywood residents who helped authorities capture an arsonist 
responsible for several fires in their neighborhood were honored Thursday by 
the Los Angeles Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Sheppard-Tapper, Linda Ornelas, Jim Khavarian and Sam Silberscheim, 
all residents of the 5400 block of Bellingham Avenue, were awarded certificates 
of appreciation by the Fire Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The certificates cited the foursome for "unselfish courage and acts of heroism" 
in the Feb. 5 capture of Reunald Parker, 31, after a fire was intentionally 
started in a parking garage on the block. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the four residents were members of a fledgling Neighborhood 
Watch group that had begun patrolling the area after several arson fires had 
occurred. On Feb. 5 they saw Parker leaving the scene of the garage fire and 
followed him. They later led fire investigators to Parker and he was arrested 
on suspicion of arson. 
</P>
<P>
Parker pleaded guilty to 17 counts of arson on April 18 and was sentenced to 14 
years in prison.

RETIRED PRO WARNS STUDENTS ABOUT STEROIDS

<P>
Five years ago, when Steve Courson retired from professional football, he 
discovered that he suffered from a heart condition that he blames on his use of 
anabolic steroids. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Courson, a bulky former offensive guard and two-time Super Bowl 
player, told an assembly of 1,200 Fountain Valley High School students that 
those who use performance-enhancing drugs are risking their health. 
</P>
<P>
"I used steroids," Courson told the audience in the basketball gym. "I had the 
worldly vision of success. . . . But if I knew then what I know today, would I 
use steroids? The answer is no." 
</P>
<P>
Courson first used steroids in 1974 while playing college football. He gained 
30 pounds in 30 days, he said. When he was playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers 
and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he used them again. At his peak, he could bench press 
605 pounds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1985, he retired from football and found he suffered cardiomyopathy, a 
weakened heart muscle, and later learned that he needed a heart transplant. He 
blamed steroids. 
</P>
<P>
In a sport where heft and power make the difference in crucial plays, Courson 
said he feared losing the edge to linemen who used steroids to build muscle and 
gain explosive strength. 
</P>
<P>
"It's business and it's money," he said in an interview before the lecture. 
"You do what you have to do. . . . Do you think I wanted to take that stuff? I 
did it because it was my job. It's a war out there." 
</P>
<P>
Courson told the students that performance-enhancing drugs help athletes train 
more aggressively, revive more quickly between workouts and build body mass. 
But they also pose long-term threats to the heart and liver, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Anabolic steroids are synthetic hormones sold as pills or injectable liquids. 
Courson estimated that one in 15 high school students nationwide use steroids. 
State law prohibits the use or sale of steroids without a prescription. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Schoemann, 17, a senior, objected to the presentation's inclusion of 
slides showing steroids-using body builders, which drew expressions of wonder 
from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"Showing the guys who were huge only made a lot of the guys (in the audience) 
want to be like that," she said. "Rather than have the opposite effect, it just 
made people wonder what it would be like to be like that." 
</P>
<P>
But some members of the varsity football team disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"He tried to gain our confidence by not saying (steroids) don't work. We know 
they work," said Scott Wohrman, 18, a senior. "We wouldn't have listened to 
anything else he said" if he had lied about steroids, Wohrman said. 
</P>
<P>
The varsity team's center, Wohrman said he suspects some of his opponents use 
steroids but has withstood the temptation to use steroids himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen huge guys, and they can't get that big -- unless they were lifting 
since they were 2-year-olds. These guys are just gigantic for 17-year-olds," 
Wohrman said. But "you can't do anything about it unless you want to risk your 
health." 
</P>
<P>
Courson, originally from Pennsylvania, has been on the waiting list for a heart 
transplant for more than a year, he said. He is touring the country speaking to 
high school students about his experience with steroids to raise money for his 
heart transplant, said John L. Lestini, Jr., co-chairman for the Steve Courson 
Medical Trust Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Charter Hospital of Fountain Valley, which sponsored Courson's talk, paid 
$1,500 to a trust fund toward the transplant, Lestini said.

DAUGHTER ADMITS SHE JOKED OVER MURDER PLOT

Teen-age murderer Cinnamon Brown conceded in court Thursday that she once 
laughed about the idea of electrocuting her stepmother in a bathtub, but she 
asserted that she viewed the prospect of killing the woman as deadly serious 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Under often-tough cross-examination, the 19-year-old woman closed out her two 
days of testimony as the star witness against her father, 38-year-old David 
Brown, who is on trial for murder for allegedly orchestrating his wife's 1985 
shooting death. 
</P>
<P>
Cinnamon Brown, incarcerated in the California Youth Authority facility in 
Camarillo for nearly the last five years, admitted that she shot to death her 
stepmother, 24-year-old Linda Brown, while the victim slept in their Garden 
Grove home in March, 1985. But the teen-ager said she committed the crime under 
the prodding of her father, who made her keep silent about the scheme and then 
collected $835,000 from his wife's insurance and married the victim's sister. 
</P>
<P>
In her testimony, Cinnamon Brown recounted that, while on a drive a few months 
before the killing with her father and Patti Bailey, the victim's 17-year-old 
sister, Cinnamon suggested that the trio could kill Linda Brown by throwing an 
electrical appliance into the bathtub with her. 
</P>
<P>
The trio then broke into laughter when they realized that this would not work 
because "Linda never took baths -- she always took showers," Cinnamon Brown 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Gary M. Pohlson pounced on the remark in an effort to portray 
Cinnamon Brown before the Superior Court jury as a callous and opportunistic 
murderer who feels no remorse. 
</P>
<P>
Noting the air of levity surrounding the conversation, Pohlson asked in an 
incredulous tone: "I mean, it's kind of a big deal, isn't it -- killing 
someone?" 
</P>
<P>
Cinnamon Brown said she first thought that her father and Patti Bailey were 
just kidding about the need to get Linda out of the way before Linda could 
carry out her own plan to kill David Brown and take over his lucrative computer 
data-retrieval company. 
</P>
<P>
But soon, she said, she became convinced that there was a real danger and that 
she had to be the one to kill Linda Brown -- in part because her father had 
assured her that her youth would preclude a prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to lose my dad," she said, breaking into loud sobs. Killing her 
stepmother "showed that I loved him," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Cinnamon Brown said she kept silent about her father's role in the alleged 
scheme for more than three years out of loyalty to him. But her loyalty waned 
-- and she was willing to cooperate with authorities -- once she heard about 
the insurance money her father had collected and his marriage to Patti, she 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
"I was mad and angry because (David Brown and Patti Bailey) didn't tell me. And 
I felt hurt because they just left me there. And it seemed like it was not 
important to them anymore," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For the only time in her two days on the witness stand, Cinnamon Brown then 
appeared to glance quickly at her father and, motioning toward him with her 
hand, said in tears: "They were just as involved as I was. . . . They killed 
Linda just as much as I did."

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: NORTH COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
North County's fast growth has generated so much mail volume that the U.S. 
Postal Service has created additional ZIP codes for Oceanside and Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
Postal Service spokesman Mike Cannone said Thursday that five ZIP codes will be 
added in Oceanside and three in Escondido, beginning "a whole series of 
changes" to keep pace with growth in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
The new ZIP codes will go into effect July 1. 
</P>
<P>
"Five new ZIP codes in one city is definitely the biggest change we've had 
probably anywhere in Southern California," Cannone said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the additional ZIP areas will help speed up automated mail sorting, 
affecting about 19,000 deliveries in Oceanside and 13,500 in Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of areas where the ZIP code will be changed began receiving notices 
this week so they will have time to order new stationery. 
</P>
<P>
Mail addressed to the old ZIP codes will be delivered after July 1, but the 
Postal Service is asking residents to promptly use the new codes to avoid 
delays. 
</P>
<P>
Beside the new ZIP codes, some postal box prefixes will be changed in Oceanside 
and Escondido.

Opponents of a proposed landfill on Aspen Road will hold a protest walk at the 
site, starting at 10 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Walks ranging from 100 yards to 3 miles -- around the perimeter of the proposed 
dump -- are planned, said Gib Lee, organizer of the protest. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the Aspen Road landfill say it would worsen the area's air quality 
and endanger the ground water, which is tapped by neighboring Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
The Aspen Road site is one of three being considered by county officials -- the 
others being in the Pauma Valley east of Interstate 15 and near Warner Springs 
-- to accommodate North County's trash as the existing landfill in San Marcos 
approaches capacity.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: OTAY MESA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One man was in custody Thursday after attempting to rob three uniformed San 
Diego police officers about half a mile north of the border, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The officers, members of the Border Crime Intervention Unit, were at an 
observation point at Old Dairy Mart and Monument roads when they were 
surrounded by three men about 11:45 p.m. Wednesday, said Bill Robinson, a San 
Diego Police Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
One of the men asked the officers if they had any "weed" (marijuana), Robinson 
said. As they were talking, the officers noticed that one of the men, Jose 
Ramirez, had a knife in his hand. Then, as the first man asked the officers for 
money, the third man pulled out a gun, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The officers struggled with the men and Ramirez was taken into custody. The 
other two fled south across the border. Officers seized the knife Ramirez was 
holding and a .22-caliber Ruger pistol, which was dropped by the third suspect, 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez, 18, was booked on three counts of suspicion of attempted armed robbery 
and was being held in lieu of $45,000 bail at County Jail downtown. Ramirez, a 
native of Los Mochis in Mexico, told police he has been living in Tijuana, 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The officers -- Joe Bane, Paul Hollman and Michael Richardson -- have been with 
the unit for less than a year, Robinson said.

COUNTY RECOMMENDS DISSOLVING COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHANNON SANDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NORTH TUSTIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For more than a decade, the North Tustin Municipal Advisory Council has fought 
commercial developments and piecemeal annexations to maintain the rural, open 
atmosphere of the prestigious unincorporated area that includes Cowan Heights 
and Lemon Heights. 
</P>
<P>
Although the council is a strictly advisory body to the County Board of 
Supervisors, its members say they have been instrumental in controlling 
building in the area. They point, for example, to their role in the approval of 
the North Tustin Specific Plan, which limits development there. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, it appears likely that the council will be disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a $58,000 budget deficit for the North Tustin service area, the 
county Environmental Management Agency is recommending that the seven-member 
council be dissolved. The recommendation has the support of Supervisors Roger 
R. Stanton and Gaddi H. Vasquez, who represent the area, but it has brought a 
mixed response from the community and from the council itself. 
</P>
<P>
The council was formed as the Santiago Municipal Advisory Council in 1979 with 
the understanding that it would be funded by donations, said Ken Scattergood, 
county special districts administrator for the Environmental Management Agency. 
That was never the case, however, Scattergood said. The money for its annual 
budgets of $20,000 to $25,000 has instead come from service area funds, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
If the county does not eliminate the council, he said, it will probably have to 
start charging the 25,000 to 30,000 residents of North Tustin for some of their 
county services, beginning in the 1990-91 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Council Chairwoman Dessa Schroeder argued that the group has saved the county 
money because its unpaid members have spent hours researching issues ranging 
from cat mutilations to lighting on tennis courts. 
</P>
<P>
But Stanton said the council has little real authority in any case. 
</P>
<P>
"They and their claque have continually said that the board wanted to take 
their power and authority, and that's been puzzling to Gaddi and me. They have 
no more power than making recommendations. . . . Their recommendations carry no 
more weight than those of individual constituents." 
</P>
<P>
Council member Phyllis Spivey, a vocal critic of the body, agrees with the 
agency's recommendation. "I think the supervisors should be commended for 
removing an unnecessary layer of government," Spivey said. Spivey, a 
real-estate broker who was elected to the council in 1988, has repeatedly 
clashed with the other members over numerous issues. 
</P>
<P>
Some council members and others in the community, however, say disbanding the 
body would be a victory for a small but active group of real-estate developers.

A Saturday of glorious sunshine will be sandwiched between two, gloomy overcast 
days today and Sunday, according to the National Weather Service in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
No significant rainfall is forecast, but a low pressure system near the central 
California coast is causing a buildup of a deep marine layer, said forecaster 
Harvey Hastrup. 
</P>
<P>
"This resulted in lower temperatures and cloudy skies on Thursday compared to 
the previous few days," Hastrup said. 
</P>
<P>
Sunshine and clearing skies may break through this afternoon as the low 
pressure system moves inland, but temperatures will rebound only slightly, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
By Saturday, a high pressure system building along the coast is expected to 
drive away the clouds and bring abundant sunshine and warmer weather. But the 
reprieve is only temporary, Hastrup said. 
</P>
<P>
Another weak disturbance is approaching San Diego and will bring with it 
increasing cloudiness and lower temperatures on Sunday and Monday, Hastrup 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At the beaches, the high for today and the weekend will range from 63 to 68 
degrees. Sea breezes of 12 to 20 m.p.h. are forecast, with surf expected at 2 
to 4 feet. The ocean temperature is 66 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
For the coastal strip, temperatures will range from 67 to 72, dipping down 
between 58 and 63 degrees at night, Hastrup said. 
</P>
<P>
Inland areas can expect highs of 69 to 76 and lows 53 to 60.

MIKE PENNER: IN THIS RACE, ANGELS STEER INTO THE WALL ON FIRST LAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Angels have begun their September swoon a little early this season, but 
then, Luis Polonia was supposed to give them more speed. 
</P>
<P>
It's over. Look at the calendar. Look at the standings. Friday is the 11th of 
May. The Angels are 11 games back. 
</P>
<P>
That's tough to do, even if you're trying. 
</P>
<P>
Now look at the Athletics. Their record on the same day is 21-6. They're 
playing at a pace of .778. They're playing with everyone in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
It's over. 
</P>
<P>
So what's your definition of runaway inflation? The Angels have theirs. Not 
only won't $16 million buy a pennant anymore, it won't even keep you in the 
race for five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels is dead. It isn't Mark Langston's fault, although his 2-3 record 
hasn't helped much, but he was never the answer anyway. The acquisition of 
Langston was significant, mostly, for the possibilities it created. 
</P>
<P>
Namely, more acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
Langston gave the Angels a surplus of pitching, which was supposed to give Mike 
Port the ammunition to correct an offensive deficiency. Trade a pitcher, gain a 
hitter. It was the logical, and essential, next step. 
</P>
<P>
But the second shoe never dropped. Port made one trade all winter -- to bring 
in another pitcher, Scott Bailes. He entered the season standing pat and with 
fingers crossed, hoping that Dick Schofield might transform into Cal Ripken 
overnight and that Lance Parrish might turn back the clock a half-dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
That's the new Angel mind-set. In 1979, it was Yes We Can. Today, it's We Hope 
We Can. 
</P>
<P>
To have any chance of hanging with the A's, the Angels needed an impact move -- 
a Joe Carter, an Ellis Burks, or, more realistically, both -- that never came. 
All baseball fans play the match-up game. Didn't Port? Left field: Rickey 
Henderson or Chili Davis? Right field: Jose Canseco or Claudell Washington? 
Third base: Carney Lansford or Jack Howell? 
</P>
<P>
Reality check, anyone? 
</P>
<P>
When it came to assessing, and assembling, this Angel team, Port made two 
mistakes. The first is Port's chip-on-the-shoulder approach to the trade table. 
"I'm ready to be overwhelmed," Port always quips, which sounds glib and cute 
and will never get the job done in the real world. In the real world -- and 
this excludes the New York Yankees -- nothing comes free. To get the goods, or 
the greats, a price must be paid, a price Port has refused to pay. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Because Port's other mistake is the way he has evaluated his team's 
talent. In short, Port has overrated the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, we kept hearing about The Best Young Infield in Baseball. Wally 
Joyner at first, Mark McLemore at second, Howell at third, Schofield at short. 
Port kept comparing Howell to Gary Gaetti. Cookie Rojas, then the Angels' field 
manager, kept saying he'd rather have Schofield than Ozzie Smith. 
</P>
<P>
You will notice that the Angels' field manager now is named Doug Rader. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner has settled into the type of player all the scouts said he'd be coming 
out of triple-A -- a .290ish hitter, a smooth fielder, an 80-RBI man with some 
power, but certainly not the stuff that taunted the Angels with 34 home runs in 
1987. Nothing wrong with that. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, however, expectations have exceeded results. 
</P>
<P>
Howell has developed, not into Gary Gaetti, but into Steve Buechele with a 
better glove. He hit .228 last season. He is hitting .218 this season. He's 28 
and in his fourth full season, so by now, you have a pretty good idea of what 
you're getting when you write his name into the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Schofield, meanwhile, has developed the worst injury known to man -- the Torn 
Rotator Hamstring. Pulled hamstrings can be bad things, and two of them wiped 
out the Lakers in the 1989 NBA Finals, but Magic Johnson and Byron Scott came 
back to play again. No one's yet sure about Schofield. 
</P>
<P>
Schofield first hurt the hamstring in March. It is now May. The Angel trainers 
say Schofield has regressed in his rehabilitation and they've taken the 
timetable for his return off the table. 
</P>
<P>
Ever hear of a career-ending hamstring pull? Stay tuned. 
</P>
<P>
Schofield's pain was supposed to have been McLemore's gain, the foot in the 
door McLemore has been looking for ever since Johnny Ray showed up. McLemore 
would get a chance to play shortstop and would get a chance to show he could 
hit major-league pitching. 
</P>
<P>
McLemore's batting average after 29 games: .136. 
</P>
<P>
Add Devon White's arrested development into the equation and the Angels have 
the look of a team that has found its level. A mediocre team, in its prime. 
</P>
<P>
If the Angel front office is fooling itself, Angel fans no longer are. I spent 
Wednesday night's game, a 9-1 loss to Baltimore, in the stands and listened as 
some fans booed White and others laughed as each pathetic batting average was 
flashed upon the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
"We've only got one guy who's hitting," said one of them. "The French guy." 
</P>
<P>
Dante Bichette is no foreigner, but his current average -- .295 -- does speak a 
different language than those surrounding him in the Angel batting order. 
</P>
<P>
Where do the Angels go from here? First place is already gone and it won't be 
long before everybody else in the American League West is choking on Oakland's 
exhaust fumes. These seasons happen. The A's are on a pace to win 126 games, 
but probably will slack off to 110. 
</P>
<P>
Port and Rader shouldn't waste the next 4 1/2 months. They should try some 
things. Keep Bichette in the lineup and see what happens. Keep Polonia in the 
leadoff spot. Play John Orton. Bring up Gary Disarcina, the Angel shortstop 
prospect with the healthy hamstring. Maybe place a call to Mike Fetters too. 
</P>
<P>
Play it as if it's September. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels already are.

FLASH! CHARGERS TINKER WITH LINE!; 
</P>
<P>
NFL: A NEW OFFENSIVE LINE COACH? PLAYERS IN DIFFERENT POSITIONS? THAT'S HARDLY 
NEWS, GIVEN RECENT HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In an area where statistics aren't easily generated, use this as a measure of 
the Chargers' recent troubles on the offensive line: four coaches in four 
seasons. The turnover has not been because of success. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Gibbs is the latest choice to turn the unit around. A former assistant 
with the Raiders and Denver Broncos, Gibbs is finding part of his job at this 
week's mini-camp has been making the players feel comfortable not just with him 
but with themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Several years of being blamed for offensive ineffectiveness, of watching draft 
day come around with team officials saying improving the offensive line is a 
priority, of watching coaches come and go, of seeing your job threatened and 
your position changed . . . all that has a way of getting to a player. 
</P>
<P>
"They have been browbeaten and have been through so much," Gibbs said Thursday. 
"Now the idea is to get them proud of what they're doing, proud of themselves, 
and start to make some progress." 
</P>
<P>
But first, he has had to break them down again. The process began, as in the 
past, with a few more position changes. 
</P>
<P>
After two seasons at left guard, Broderick Thomas was moved to right tackle to 
replace Brett Miller, lost to the New York Jets in Plan B free agency. And 
Dennis McKnight, back for his eighth season after missing last season because 
of leg surgery, was moved into Thompson's old position. KcKnight's change comes 
after a 1988 season in which he was named a Pro Bowl alternate at right guard. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs said he spent the early weeks after his hiring was announced Feb. 8 
studying Charger game films and contemplating the changes. He said his 
rationale was what he saw and how he likes to structure his lines. 
</P>
<P>
"Broderick Thompson is a power guy, and I like the power player on the team to 
be our right tackle," Gibbs said. "I knew in Dennis McKnight I had a guy who 
has played in the league and understands what it takes to play smart. I knew he 
had to be on our unit." 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the line is unchanged, with David Richards at right guard, Courtney 
Hall at center and Joel Patten at left tackle. But this will be only their 
second season at the same position for the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got them all thoroughly confused now," Gibbs said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
By now, most of the veterans are used to adjustment. Change has been the only 
constant these past few years. 
</P>
<P>
Few know that better than Thompson. In his four Charger seasons, he has worked 
under four position coaches at three different positions. This year, he is back 
at right tackle, where he started in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"My biggest wish is to get some consistency with the coaching so we can get 
acclimated to doing some of the same things for a couple of years," Thompson 
said. "Four coaches in four years is tough. You have to change techniques and 
calls from year to year. There is no consistency to it." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said that at first he was hesitant to change positions. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been at guard for 2 1/2 years and I was looking for great things at that 
position because I was starting to get all my confidence there," Thompson said. 
"I had my goals set on all pro, then this happened." 
</P>
<P>
But on reflection, Thompson said he decided the move might be for the best. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought about how when I played tackle how good I felt after the games 
because there is not as much physical contact at tackle as there is at guard," 
Thompson said. "You get more exposure at tackle. Tackles get a lot more 
exposure in the league than guards. But I knew it is going to take a lot of 
work on and off the practice field." 
</P>
<P>
McKnight is going through a similar adjustment process. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very hard for me right now," McKnight said. "I've been on the right side 
of the line for seven years, and now I'm on the left. What were my strong 
points on the right are now my weak points on the left. 
</P>
<P>
"This is easier on Broderick because he is such a good athlete. I'm more of 
what I call a ham-and-egg man, a Rocky Balboa, a club fighter. I'm not a good 
technician. I just go out and street brawl, and it's not pretty. But when the 
game is over, the guy across from me didn't get any tackles." 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs expects McKnight to succeed in his new role. 
</P>
<P>
"I know he is going through some frustrations," Gibbs said. "But when the games 
start, he will be fine." 
</P>
<P>
For all the changes, there could have been more, and instead of shuffling 
positions, they might have left one of the returning players out of a job. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers went into the draft three weeks ago looking for help at offensive 
line. They had planned on taking offensive tackle Richmond Webb of Texas 
A&amp;M in the first round until inside linebacker Junior Seau of USC fell to 
them with the fifth pick. After they passed on Webb, who was taken ninth by 
Miami, they tried to trade up for offensive guard Keith Sims of Iowa State. 
</P>
<P>
When that too failed, the Chargers had to wait until the seventh pick of the 
third round for their first offensive lineman -- Leo Goeas of Hawaii. The 
Chargers then took four more, but while Gibbs said some have impressed him, he 
considers them players for the future rather than challengers for starting 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't see anybody threatening the front group for jobs," Gibbs said. 
"What I am looking for is three good backups. Looking at last year, it was when 
there were injuries that things went worse." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the help at guard and tackle could come from three Plan B players 
signed over the past two seasons. But Gibbs so far has only been able to 
evaluate Tom Toth, signed from Miami. Injuries have kept tackle Larry Williams 
and guard Mike Simmonds on the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Reserve outside linebacker David Brandon will undergo knee surgery within the 
next two weeks and could be out for the season, Coach Dan Henning said. Henning 
said the injury was diagnosed as a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament 
during an arthroscopic examination conducted by team doctor Gary Losse. 
Brandon, 25, injured his right knee in practice Wednesday as he was trying to 
go around rookie offensive tackle Leo Goeas. Brandon, acquired in a trade with 
Buffalo in 1987, is a free agent. But a team spokesman said all unsigned 
veterans at mini-camp signed a waiver promising they would receive at least an 
amount equal to their 1989 salary if injured. Brandon received $145,000 in base 
pay in 1989. . . . Several other players did not practice because of injuries: 
Wide receiver Quinn Early (hamstring), defensive end Burt Grossman (groin), 
cornerback David Pool (hamstring) offensive tackle David Richards (back), and 
wide receivers Wayne Walker (quadriceps) and Walter Wilson (ankle). Henning 
said none of the injuries were considered serious, and most of the players were 
held out for precautionary reasons. . . . Rookie outside linebacker Jeff Mills 
has been excused to return to New Jersey to attend to personal business. . . . 
Offensive guard Dennis McKnight said he has resigned after two seasons as the 
team's player representative because he was upset that the NFL Players Assn. 
has not taken a stronger stance against the league's drug-testing policies. He 
said he was particularly upset by a meeting between Atlanta tackle Bill Fralic 
and NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue. Fralic is an outspoken advocate of a more 
rigorous testing program. The Chargers have not elected a replacement for 
McKnight. . . . The mini-camp concludes today with workouts at 10:30 a.m. and 4 
p.m.

CHALLENGE MAY AWAIT TOP DUO; 
</P>
<P>
HORSE RACING: OPENING VERSE COULD POSE A THREAT TO SUNDAY SILENCE AND EASY GOER 
THIS SUMMER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW BEYER, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although neither Sunday Silence nor Easy Goer has raced as a 4-year-old -- both 
are absent from the field for Saturday's Pimlico Special -- it is widely 
assumed that they will dominate U.S. racing this year. 
</P>
<P>
However, there may be one racehorse capable of giving them a serious challenge. 
He doesn't have much national recognition yet, and he isn't even listed as the 
morning-line favorite at Pimlico Saturday, but Opening Verse has the potential 
to be a champion. He can show how good he is when he faces a top field in 
Maryland's first $1 million race. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago his trainer, Dick Lundy, won the Special with Blushing John, whom he 
later sent into battle against Sunday Silence and Easy Goer in the Breeders' 
Cup Classic. Blushing John finished only a length behind the top two. So Lundy 
has a good perspective from which to evaluate Opening Verse. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people thought I was crazy for thinking that Blushing John could beat 
those horses in the Breeders' Cup," Lundy said, "but they both had to run their 
best races to beat him. And I think Opening Verse may be better than Blushing 
John. He's more versatile -- he can run on the inside, he can run on the 
outside, he can make a couple of different moves in a race. If he runs the way 
I think he will in the Special, we'll take him to California for the Hollywood 
Gold Cup, where he'll face Sunday Silence." 
</P>
<P>
Lundy is a low-key trainer who doesn't routinely boast about his horses, but he 
talked as if the outcome of the Pimlico Special almost was a forgone 
conclusion. And he is probably right. 
</P>
<P>
Opening Verse never got a chance to show how good he is before he turned 4, 
because of a major recent trend in the sport: the domination of U.S. yearling 
sales by European buyers. Many of this country's best-bred horses are sent to 
race in England; even though they may have pedigrees that would make them 
effective dirt runners, they are never exposed to dirt tracks abroad. Blushing 
John was one such horse: He raced in Europe at 2 and 3, then came to this 
country and became an Eclipse Award-winner running on the dirt at 4. 
</P>
<P>
Opening Verse was bought for $800,000 as a yearling by Mohammed al Maktoum, and 
raced creditably during two seasons in England, although he never won a major 
stakes. Owner Allen Paulson then acquired him as part of a package deal with 
Maktoum after Lundy had made a trip to Europe to watch the colt run. "He was a 
good-moving horse who was sound and correct," the trainer said. "There are a 
lot of horses in Europe who want to come from 10 or 12 lengths behind and make 
a late kick, and they don't necessarily do so well here. But Opening Verse had 
a lot of natural speed." 
</P>
<P>
He displayed that speed when he ran the fastest mile of the Santa Anita meeting 
this winter, winning in a blistering 1:34 1-5. But it was his most recent 
start, the Oaklawn Handicap at Arkansas, that showed Lundy (and plenty of 
handicappers, as well) just how good he is. He stalked the early leaders and 
then accelerated powerfully through a narrow opening to take the lead; jockey 
Chris McCarron told Lundy that he made contact with the horses on both sides of 
him, but that Opening Verse was undeterred. He drew away to run 1 1/8 miles in 
1:47 1-5. From the speed- handicapping standpoint this was as good as any horse 
in the country has run this year (and not much slower than the Sunday 
Silence-Easy Goer Breeders' Cup Classic). 
</P>
<P>
On the basis of this performance, Opening Verse should be able to beat 
Ruhlmann, the morning-line favorite for the Pimlico Special. Ruhlmann has won 
his last two starts in California impressively, but he was able to get 
relatively easy leads over a racing surface that is traditionally conducive to 
speed horses. Opening Verse's major competition may come from two other rivals. 
</P>
<P>
Gorgeous beat the champion mare Bayakoa last month by equaling a track record 
at Oaklawn. She has not faced males before, but her speed figures suggest that 
she can handle competition of this quality. DeRoche finished 2 1/4 lengths 
behind Opening Verse in the Oaklawn Handicap, but his effort was better than it 
looked on the surface. The inside part of the track was horribly 
disadvantageous, and the only person at the track who seemed oblivious to the 
strong bias was DeRoche's jockey, Sam Maple, who was hugging the rail all the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Gorgeous and DeRoche are both formidable contenders in the Special, but they 
are likely to play only supporting roles in a race in which Opening Verse 
demonstrates what a high-class horse he is.

SIDEKICKS AGAIN TEST SOCKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON PATTERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
DALLAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One year later, the Sockers are back for another run through J.R. Ewing's town 
and another run-in with the Dallas Sidekicks. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers continue their quest for an eighth indoor title when the MISL's 
best-of-seven Western Division championship series begins tonight at 5:35 in 
Reunion Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The Sidekicks extended the Sockers to the limit in last season's playoffs 
before midfielder Branko Segota sent a 30-footer that curved into the right 
corner of the goal in Game 7 to give the Sockers a 1-0 victory and a trip to 
the finals against Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
What's new with the Sidekicks? Well, they've improved. 
</P>
<P>
If Socker Coach Ron Newman goes by the numbers, he has to figure his team is in 
for trouble. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, Dallas finished the regular season 31-21, six games ahead of the 
Sockers (25-27). Forward Tatu led the MISL in points with 64 goals and 49 
assists, defender Wes McCleod led in blocks with 154 and goalie Joe Papaleo had 
the best goals-against average at 3.34. 
</P>
<P>
Statistically, the Sockers fell well short. At the conclusion of the regular 
season, Segota was the points leader with 27 goals and 34 assists, defender 
George Fernandez led in blocks with 98 and goalies Zoltan Toth (3.48 GAA) and 
Victor Nogueira (3.61 GAA) were both behind Papaleo. 
</P>
<P>
About the only thing the Sidekicks didn't do was play consistently against the 
Sockers, who won the series, 5-3. Dallas did pound them, 9-3, in the opener 
Oct. 28. The Sockers were only potent with their words that night. 
</P>
<P>
Said midfielder Waad Hirmez: "If they're going to peak in the first game of the 
season, that's fine. We peak at the end." 
</P>
<P>
Nice try, but Dallas was at a peak throughout the season, while the Sockers 
peeked timidly at the standings to see how far behind they were. 
</P>
<P>
What remains to be seen is if intangibles will help the Sockers. The reward the 
Sidekicks received for winning the division was a 20-day vacation and 
home-field advantage. A week ago, that looked awfully important, but after 
winning just six of 26 games on the road during the regular season, the Sockers 
went 2-0 in St. Louis in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers now have four tough games with St. Louis to their credit, and that 
might work in their favor. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's the best situation (for the Sidekicks) to go into," Newman 
said. "I know I wouldn't like it. If you're resting, you're getting your 
players fit again. But the down side is you're not getting any competition. 
We've got the best of both worlds. We've gained four competitive games without 
any injuries." 
</P>
<P>
Dallas is a young but experienced team that returned 15 of 18 players from last 
season. The only real loss during the off-season was forward Michael King, who 
departed to the Cleveland Crunch and then finished fourth in the league in 
scoring with 45 goals and 26 assists. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to tell yet if the Sockers are better or worse than they were at this 
point last season. Veteran forward Steve Zungul was at his best during the 
playoffs in 1989 and provided the Sockers with an extra splash of experience. 
Arthritic hips will prevent him from doing anything more than watching now. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers lost some offensive punch when forward Zoran Karic, who led the 
Sockers in scoring during the regular season last year, was traded to Cleveland 
for forward Paul Wright. What they gained was chemistry that has helped them 
win 12 of 19 games since. 
</P>
<P>
If Segota's game picks up and forwards Rod Castro and Damir Haramina continue 
playing well, the Sockers figure to have an offense as potent as last year's. 
</P>
<P>
There are two big questions: 
</P>
<P>
Is Dallas good enough to send the Sockers home before the championship series 
for only the second time in nine years? Or is Dallas good enough to be here but 
not good enough to win? 
</P>
<P>
Series Notes

A HUE AND CRY OVER A BATTING CAGE; 
</P>
<P>
BURBANK: A HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL COACH AWAITS TRIAL ON CHARGES THAT HIS BUSINESS 
VIOLATES CITY NOISE ORDINANCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Dave Johnson would rather forget his first season as Burbank High baseball 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
For openers, the Bulldogs have a 5-13-1 record and are 2-12 in Foothill League 
play entering today's season-finale against Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it would be rough," said Johnson, who inherited a fourth-place team. "I 
told the administration when I was hired that I didn't expect to win many games 
the first year." 
</P>
<P>
Neither did he expect to be involved in a season-long legal rhubarb with 
Glendale city officials over his operation of the Glendale Batting Cage -- a 
fixture at 620 E. Colorado St. since 1965. But Johnson has been forced to 
answer to attorneys and city inspectors about as often as he answers to 
umpires. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't really affected the team, but it's taxed my enthusiasm for life, I 
can tell you that," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the season's final pitch draws near, Johnson's headaches are going 
into extra innings. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 31, is scheduled to stand trial Wednesday in Glendale Municipal Court 
on two misdemeanor counts of violating the city's noise ordinances. The batting 
center, which Johnson has owned since 1982, was determined last fall by city 
officials to be operating in excess of the legal 65-decibel noise limit in 
commercial zones. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also faces misdemeanor charges that he has an illegal advertising sign 
above the batting cage and that the facility's now-closed snack bar is illegal 
for that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
For 18 months, tenants of an apartment building behind the batting cage, as 
well as owners of neighboring businesses, have complained about excessive noise 
generated by balls hitting bats and balls striking metal posts. They also have 
complained about clanging gates, disorderly patrons and noise made by baseballs 
being loaded into automatic pitching machines. 
</P>
<P>
According to neighbors, Johnson has repeatedly reneged on promises to make 
adjustments to lessen the noise. In a letter to the Glendale City Council, 
Robert P. Paone, a tenant of the neighboring apartments, said that, "No changes 
of any kind have been made" and "(Johnson) simply doesn't want to be bothered.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Charges were filed in January as a last resort, according to Assistant City 
Atty. Ron Braden, after Johnson repeatedly failed to heed instructions from 
city officials to comply with noise regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an ongoing problem," Braden said. "Mr. Johnson was told several times . 
. . that the noises were exceeding regulations and he has not complied." 
</P>
<P>
The maximum penalty for each violation is a $500 fine and six months in jail. 
Braden, however, said he will seek a three-year probationary period for Johnson 
with the condition that he comply with all noise ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
"If he complies by keeping the noise down, that's what we're interested in," 
Braden said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson argues that he is being characterized as "a bad guy" who is 
uncooperative and unsympathetic to community concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm being treated like I'm selling pornography or crack cocaine or something," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson claims that he has made repeated efforts to comply with city 
regulations and appease his neighbors -- so much so that he has become 
frustrated with city officials. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he has applied for a permit for his sign and that he has asked 
city officials if he could use his snack bar for storage. In both cases, he 
said, the city has not replied. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, Johnson shut down the two batting cages nearest the apartment 
complex. He also says he has encouraged patrons to use quieter foam-filled bats 
and has experimented with the use of softer rubber baseballs. 
</P>
<P>
"He had me hitting some of those balls to hear what it sounded like," said 
Jeremy Sparks, a pitcher for Burbank High. "There was a major difference. 
They're softer and they don't make as much noise." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Johnson has covered exposed metal pipes and pitching machines with 
rubber padding. But those efforts, Braden said, have fallen short. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, he hasn't done everything he can to comply," Braden said. "We 
have two (noise) readings that indicate he has not complied. I don't know what 
steps he has taken since the filing of the complaint. The problem is (that) he 
didn't take those steps before the complaint was filed." 
</P>
<P>
Not so, according to Johnson. He said he had asked city officials which 
measures he could take to quiet the facility and subsequently acted on their 
suggestions. He was told by one city noise inspector last summer that the 
batting cage would be in compliance if Johnson simply would cover exposed metal 
surfaces with the aforementioned padding. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson did and believed the matter closed. By December, however, threats of 
legal action once again surfaced. "They keep saying, 'What you've done is not 
enough,' " Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Four sound experts have conducted tests to determine whether the batting cage 
was in violation of noise regulations. One hired by Johnson said the facility 
was not in violation. City officials were forced to void the results of two 
tests because of errors in the use of measuring devices. 
</P>
<P>
Last July and October, city officials finally were satisfied with two tests 
that indicated that the batting cage indeed was too loud. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson argued that he was never informed of the results of the final two tests 
and therefore not given an opportunity to comply. But Braden said that the city 
was not obligated to notify Johnson of the latter tests. 
</P>
<P>
"It is his responsibility to comply with the law," Braden said. "The city does 
not have to notify him if he has complied or tell him how to comply. . . . My 
concern is that (the batting cage) may be in compliance at any given point in 
the day, but it's going to go back to prior levels (of noise)." 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, Johnson has struck out trying to make amends. Now he'll go 
to bat in court.

In another Bay League game: 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes 11, Rolling Hills 4 -- Pat O'Hara and Jason Goldberg each drove in 
four runs and the Sea Kings roughed up Rolling Hills' ace Kirt Kishita for five 
runs at Palos Verdes to finish in fourth place in the Bay League. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes (15-11, 8-6) snapped a 2-2 tie with five runs in the fifth. Four 
of the runs came off Kishita, who relieved starter Tristan Paul with no outs 
and a runner on first. 
</P>
<P>
Kishita, who allowed another run in the sixth before being pulled, was pitching 
on a day's rest after hurling a three-hitter Tuesday in Rolling Hills' 
playoff-clinching 8-2 victory over Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
"Was he ready when I brought him in?" Coach Garry Poe said. "I don't know. The 
problem with Kirt is he always wants the ball. He's so enthusiastic." 
</P>
<P>
But Poe said it was obvious that the junior right-hander didn't have his best 
stuff. Kishita gave up six hits and two walks, one with the bases loaded, in 
his inning of work. 
</P>
<P>
"We teed off on him, didn't we?" said Palos Verdes Coach Gil Eberhard. "I don't 
know why we didn't hit the ball the other day." 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg highlighted the Sea Kings' five-run fifth with a two-run double down 
the first-base line. They added four runs in the sixth, capped by a towering 
three-run homer to right-center field by O'Hara. 
</P>
<P>
A junior left-hander, O'Hara pitched 6 2/3 innings for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes managed to remain in playoff contention until the final day of the 
season despite the loss of two starters. Second baseman Chuck Okada, the team's 
leading hitter, was sidelined with a knee injury April 5 and Steve Hoye, the 
top pitcher and shortstop, was suspended from the team last week because of a 
school violation. 
</P>
<P>
Said Poe: "They did a great job to hang in the way they did. They faced a lot 
of adversity."ROB FERNAS

FAMILIARITY BREEDS A CHAMPIONSHIP FOR SAN FERNANDO; 
</P>
<P>
PREP BASEBALL: CENICEROS EMULATES POWER-HITTING COUSIN NAJAR BY DRIVING IN SIX 
AS TIGERS BEAT KENNEDY IN TITLE SHOWDOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A beaming John Najar stole up behind a San Fernando High teammate Thursday and 
placed one of his Popeye forearms around his victim's head, immobilizing him in 
a headlock. 
</P>
<P>
Some cousins kiss. These two hammer one another after hammering baseballs. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy's my cousin," Najar yelped. "It's aaaall in the family." 
</P>
<P>
No kidding. While Najar is known for his power and run production, his cousin, 
catcher Jess Ceniceros, has been on a rampage of his own, setting a school 
record for doubles in a season with eight. 
</P>
<P>
In a North Valley League regular-season finale, Ceniceros also did a pretty 
good imitation of Najar, slamming a monstrous three-run homer and driving in a 
career-high six runs in an 8-4 win over Kennedy that gave the Tigers their 
first league title since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for a player who started the season as San Fernando's backup backstop. 
</P>
<P>
"When the season started, he wasn't doing much," San Fernando Coach Steve 
Marden said. "I think he was trying to hit every ball out of the park." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, that didn't sound like such a bad notion. 
</P>
<P>
Ceniceros, who bats fifth behind Najar, delivered a bases-loaded, two-run 
single in the first to help San Fernando take a 3-1 lead. In the fifth, he 
slammed a Cody Beaumaster fastball over the left-field fence to give the Tigers 
(16-6-2, 11-5-1 in league play) a 7-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Ceniceros credited Marden with an assist. The San Fernando coach stole a sign 
from former Tiger assistant Manny Alvarado, now coach at Kennedy (16-9, 11-6). 
</P>
<P>
"Coach told me it was gonna be a fastball," Ceniceros said. "He told me to hit 
a line drive somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Ceniceros did, a few feet beyond where his cousin had smashed a 360-foot flyout 
two innings earlier. Ceniceros' homer was his first and severely dented 
Kennedy's hopes for a third consecutive league crown. Kennedy made a run in the 
sixth, scoring three times against junior left-hander Canto Franco (7-0) to 
close within 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
After Franco had walked home two runs, right-hander Rick Savala relieved with 
two out and the bases loaded and retired Garret Anderson on a pop fly to 
center. Anderson, who hit three home runs last week and entered the game 
batting .403, was San Fernando's fall guy. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking at the newspaper (statistics) and I saw his name," Franco said. 
"He was the one I really wanted." 
</P>
<P>
It definitely wasn't Anderson's day -- the All-City Section outfielder was zero 
for four and stranded seven runners. With runners on first and second and 
Kennedy trailing, 4-1, in the top of the fifth, Franco fanned Anderson on three 
pitches. The third strike -- a mistake that should have been thrown off the 
plate, Franco admitted -- typified Kennedy's day. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I let it go, I thought, 'He's gonna hit that out,' " Franco said. 
"But at the last second, it rose. It was magic or something." 
</P>
<P>
Franco's sleight of hand was impressive. 
</P>
<P>
After allowing a run in the first, he allowed two singles over the next four 
innings. Before he was victimized by some shoddy defense and was relieved by 
Savala, he had struck out four, walked five and allowed five hits. 
</P>
<P>
Beaumaster (5-4) threw a five-hitter and struck out six, but he walked six, hit 
two batters and threw three wild pitches. He was also the target of a bevy of 
barbs for his assertion that "the best team won" when Beaumaster beat the 
Tigers in the league opener 2 1/2 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The best team won -- today," said Marden, who knows too well that one victory 
is all relative. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, anyone looking for a real lesson in relativity might want to talk to 
Najar and Ceniceros, the crushin' cousins.

EMPIRE LEAGUE SOFTBALL ROUNDUP;

<P>
CYPRESS' HOWARD STOPS KATELLA ON ONE HIT, STRIKES OUT EIGHT

<P>
Beth Howard pitched a one-hitter and struck out eight to lead Cypress to a 5-0 
victory over Katella Thursday in an Empire League game. 
</P>
<P>
"That was about normal for Beth," Centurion Coach Jim Pittinger said. "Her 
location was great. She was hitting spots we needed on key batters." 
</P>
<P>
Howard faced a challenge in the seventh inning. With two outs, she walked Lisa 
Helg and Dena Hartman, but then struck out the last batter for Katella (13-7, 
7-3). 
</P>
<P>
But the victory meant more to Cypress (22-6 overall, 8-2 in league play) than 
just a league co-championship. Centurion Coach Tom Farr died in November, and 
the team had a special motivation. 
</P>
<P>
"From the very first, the girls dedicated this season to him," Pittinger said. 
"As a matter of fact, the girls wear black armbands as a tribute to him." 
</P>
<P>
Cypress, which left men on in every inning but the sixth, scored in the bottom 
of the third. With one out and the bases loaded, Sarah Powers hit a fly ball to 
right that landed between Katella first baseman Helg and right fielder Kelsi 
Armbruster, scoring Holly Pittinger, who had reached base on an error by 
shortstop Tammy Lohman. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth, Liz Moore doubled to left field, scoring both Pittinger and 
Azuer Calderella. One inning later, Jodi Miller scored when a throw from third 
bounced in front of Helg, and Kelly Snethen scored on a wild pitch from Leslie 
Gerbin. 
</P>
<P>
Katella's only hit came in the top of the third, when Tonya Armbruster hit a 
line drive to left, but Howard struck out the next batter, and caught a pop-up 
bunt. 
</P>
<P>
"They got the hits when they needed to," Katella Coach Rhonda Weyer said. "We 
just didn't make as much contact as they did, and when we did, it was right at 
them." 
</P>
<P>
In another league game: 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos 4, Esperanza 1 -- Christy Bowles had three hits and scored twice 
and Kandi Rehard had two hits, including a solo home run in the second inning, 
to lead visiting Los Alamitos (18-7, 8-2).

SKELTON'S RETURN TO DANA HILLS ONE OF FOUR COUNTY COACHING CHANGES; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: HE GOES BACK AFTER A ONE-YEAR SUSPENSION. KIERNAN MOVES FROM LA 
QUINTA TO GUIDE SAVANNA BOYS' TEAM. RIVERA, ADAMS RESIGN.

<P>
Four Orange County high school basketball coaches, including Rich Skelton of 
Dana Hills, were involved in job changes Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Skelton, who served a one-year suspension for violating a Southern Section 
rule, will return to his job at Dana Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The three others are: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nash Rivera, who resigned as Santa Ana boys' coach after one season at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kevin Kiernan, who has been named the boys' coach at Savanna after spending 
five seasons as girls' coach at La Quinta. The Anaheim Union High School 
District board approved his appointment Thursday night, Savanna Principal 
William Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sheila Adams, who resigned as Foothill girls' coach after 15 seasons at the 
school, Athletic Director Jerry Whitaker said. 
</P>
<P>
The Capistrano Unified School District suspended Skelton last June for the 
season under the "undue influence rule" because Skelton had contact with the 
father of basketball player John Vivona before Vivona was enrolled at Dana 
Hills. Vivona, a transfer from Texas, later lived at Skelton's home in Dana 
Point for three weeks in the fall of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Skelton acknowledged his guilt on both counts, but has taken issue with the 
penalty imposed. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said the district made it clear to him that he would be allowed to 
return to his job after a year passed, if he so desired. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little discouraged," said Skelton, a history teacher at Dana Hills. 
"I've been coaching for (25 years) and basically, I had a pretty good track 
record. I felt like what happened wasn't fair. I was a little bitter about it. 
It dimmed my enthusiasm (for coaching)." 
</P>
<P>
But Skelton said Thursday he decided last month to return to coach the 
Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
Rivera led Santa Ana to a 10-14 record and a third-place finish in the Century 
League this season. 
</P>
<P>
He was the El Dorado boys' coach from 1966-80, winning two Southern Section 
championships and five Orange League titles. He coached the girls' team at El 
Dorado for three seasons before becoming an assistant coach at Chaffey College 
for one season in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In the five seasons before going to Santa Ana, Rivera was an assistant coach 
for the women's team at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in basketball a long time and maybe it's time to change my 
priorities a little more," said Rivera, 55, who cited family reasons for his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
Kiernan, while at La Quinta, established the Aztecs as the Garden Grove 
League's dominant team. They won 54 consecutive league games and five league 
championships under him and were 112-24 overall. Kiernan also was an assistant 
to Jim Perry, La Quinta boys' coach. "It's a challenge," Kiernan said. "I've 
done as much as I can do (at La Quinta) with the girls. It is real hard to 
leave because I put a lot of time in this program." 
</P>
<P>
Kiernan replaces Tom Gregory, who resigned at Savanna at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Adams' teams won 12 league championships and played in three Southern Section 
championship games in her 15 seasons at Foothill, winning the 3-A title in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think it's time to move on," said Adams, a former player at UCLA. "I 
want to go into other areas of education. And coaching was really time 
consuming." 
</P>
<P>
Adams will remain as Foothill activities director.

WHITE SEA BASS ANGLERS FIND LUNKERS LURKING AND BITING OFF CATALINA

<TEXT>
<P>
It's a wide-open scramble for white sea bass off Catalina Island as anglers 
continue to catch 30- to 50-pound lunkers. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Hall at 22nd Street Sportfishing in San Pedro recalls the early 1950s and 
'60s when the bass caught off of Catalina's west end weighed upwards of 70 
pounds. 
</P>

Hall said some big fish were also caught during the years of the El Nino, but 
not the quality his boats have been returning with the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Anglers are using squid for bait and 30-pound-test line. The limit on bass 
remains one per angler until June 15. 
</P>
<P>
After anglers catch their limit, the boats have been moving up the island and 
locating good action on barracuda and calico bass. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest sea bass caught the past week was by Stan Pleasonto of Culver City, 
who landed a 59-pound fish aboard the Shogun of L.A. Harbor Sportfishing. 
</P>
<P>
Catalina Island Isthmus sheriff's Deputy Joe Stoveres was diving at the back 
side of the island and speared a 34 1/2-pound fish. His partner, Paul Eire, 
brought up a 33-pound fish. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Luchau of Avalon speared a 39 1/2-pound halibut near shore. 
</P>
<P>
Marty Simon of Hermosa Beach was fishing off the King Harbor rocks for halibut 
when a bonito struck his anchovy. 
</P>
<P>
Simon battled the fish for several minutes. While he was reeling in the fish, 
estimated to weigh about five pounds, his line snapped, breaking the tip of his 
fishing rod. A seal had gobbled up his catch. 
</P>
<P>
The winners for returned tags during the recent halibut derbies has been 
announced. Bob Burnham of Hawthorne won $500 and Bill Northington of Redondo 
Beach won $200.

SOUTHERN SECTION 4-A SWIMMING;

<P>
FOOTHILL GIRLS MAKING THEIR OWN SPLASH

<P>
A year ago, Tom DeLong coached the Foothill High School boys' swim team to the 
top. That Southern Section 4-A title by the Knights ended Mission Viejo's 
14-year reign as champions. 
</P>
<P>
This year, DeLong would like a repeat of that -- only this time from his girls' 
team. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights' girls are among the favorites in the 4-A meet tonight at the 
Belmont Plaza Pool, starting at 7 o'clock. El Toro, Mission Viejo and Fountain 
Valley are expected to be Foothill's main challengers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big chance for us," DeLong said. "We have some strong senior 
swimmers, so I think we have a good chance." 
</P>
<P>
He said this is the best girls' team in Foothill's history, and that's saying 
something since he has coached at Foothill for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been telling the girls it's their turn this year," DeLong said. "The 
boys won last year, so we're calling it deja vu this year. At least, we hope 
we'll be calling it that." 
</P>
<P>
A Foothill title would be its first in girls' swimming since 1974. The girls 
also won in 1972. Since 1976, the 4-A girls' title has been won by South Coast 
League teams, with Mission Viejo taking it from 1976-86 and Capistrano Valley 
the past three years. The closest the Knights came was in 1979, when they 
finished second. They have finished no higher than third since. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights' chances are built around four swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
Sionainn Marcoux set school records in the 200 and 500 freestyle; Laura Ellison 
did the same in the 100 backstroke, and Megan Logan set a school mark in the 
200 individual medley. Those three also teamed with Heather Marks to set the 
school record in the 400 freestyle relay. 
</P>
<P>
Of the top teams, El Toro appears to have the best depth. The Chargers won the 
Southern Section relays this season, rallying to edge Foothill. El Toro's top 
swimmers include Kendel Mueller, Erin Pyka and Michelle Perry. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo, which finished second a year ago, is led by Katrina Triska and 
Claudia Franco. Fountain Valley features Michelle Ham and Julie Vogt. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley, the defending champion, might have impact in the meet. The 
Cougars were down this year, but scored 36 points in the diving competition 
Wednesday and have Christy Carolin, one of the top sprinters in the Southern 
Section. 
</P>
<P>
In the boys' competition, Capistrano Valley and Mission Viejo are rated the two 
top teams, with Villa Park and El Dorado a notch below. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley defeated Mission Viejo in a South Coast League dual meet this 
season, only to forfeit the victory because it had changed its lineup in both 
the 200 medley and 400 freestyle relays between the time the meet rosters were 
turned in and the event was run. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano routed Mission Viejo in the league championship meet three weeks 
later, and is led by Kevin Eggert, Ryan Cox and Paul Felton. Mission Viejo is 
led by Tsukasas Kawabuchi, Eric Diehl and Matt Turnbull. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley scored 16 points in Wednesday's diving, Mission Viejo 12. 
</P>
<P>
Gavin Arroyo and Gary Larson are Villa Park's top swimmers; Greg Milton and 
Kyle Utsumi El Dorado's.

IRVINE FALLS TO DANA HILLS BUT GETS PLAYOFF BERTH

<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Flint, Irvine High School's baseball coach, predicted four days ago that 
his team would miss the Southern Section playoffs by splitting a two-game 
series with Dana Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine, Dana Hills and Mission Viejo went into the week contending for third 
place and the final playoff berth in the South Coast League. Flint thought 
Mission Viejo would sweep last-place San Clemente and get the final berth. 
</P>
<P>
Flint was almost right. Dana Hills shut out Irvine, 2-0, behind the two-hit 
pitching of Albie Sukut Thursday, getting a split with Irvine. Mission Viejo 
shut out San Clemente, 2-0, to earn the sweep Flint had predicted. 
</P>
<P>
But Flint failed to foresee Capistrano Valley's collapse. Capistrano Valley 
lost to league-leading El Toro, 4-1, dropping its third game in its last four 
outings and fading from the playoff picture. 
</P>
<P>
The unpredictable outcome meant that Mission Viejo (11-11-2 overall, 8-6-1 in 
league) was second while Irvine (13-13, 8-7) finished tied for third with Dana 
Hills (14-10-1, 8-7). Irvine earned the final playoff berth by winning two of 
three games against Dana Hills this season. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills was eliminated Tuesday from the playoffs and hoped to return the 
favor two days later. Sukut (2-0) retired 14 of the last 15 batters he faced. 
</P>
<P>
Sukut, making his second start of the season, allowed only a triple to Irvine 
designated hitter Bobby Garcia in the second and a single by leadoff batter 
Mark Huffman in the third. 
</P>
<P>
"Albie broke his collarbone and has only pitched in three games this season," 
said Dana Hills Coach Bob Canary. "I thought he pitched an outstanding game." 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills catcher Lance Marks failed in his bid to establish an Orange County 
career home run record, going hitless in four at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Marks walked twice, struck out and flied out deep to left field, finishing his 
three-year career with 22 home runs. Marks is tied with Valencia's Andy 
Ruscitto, who set the county mark from 1984-86. 
</P>
<P>
Leadoff batter Mike Robertson scored both of Dana Hills' runs and had four 
consecutive hits. He singled and scored on a double by designated hitter Ryan 
O'Leary in the third and singled, stole second and scored on a single by Sukut 
in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
In other South Coast League games: 
</P>
<P>
El Toro 4, Capistrano Valley 1 -- Pitcher Rob Johnson (8-1) scattered seven 
hits as El Toro (20-6, 12-3) won 20 games in the regular season for the first 
time in school history. Left fielder Tim Powers had two hits and leadoff batter 
Chris Sauritch hit a homer for El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo 12, San Clemente 3 -- Mike Boucher hit a home run and drove in 
two runs and Greg Parsons (3-3) earned the win by pitching six innings.

FULLERTON'S OLSEN HITS RECORD 13TH HOMER

<P>
Catcher D.C. Olsen of Fullerton High School hit his 13th home run to set an 
Orange County single-season record in Fullerton's 6-1 Freeway League victory 
over host Troy Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The junior hit a three-run homer over the left-center field fence off Troy 
starter Robbie Williams to break Andy Ruscitto's mark of 12, set in 1986 for 
Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen, who had gone four games without a homer, now has 18 home runs in his 
high school career and is four shy of the county career mark of 22. That was 
set by Ruscitto from 1984-86 and tied by Lance Marks of Dana Hills this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so relieved when I saw the ball go out," Olsen said. "I've been really 
pressing the last two weeks, but I found out you can't hit a homer whenever you 
want, so I just came in today relaxed and looked to hit the ball hard." 
</P>
<P>
Olsen's record was soon in jeopardy because teammate Bobby Patel had two homers 
through five innings, giving him 12 for the season. But Patel struck out in his 
final at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really pulling for Bobby to tie me," Olsen said. "It would have been 
great for both of us to share a record like that in the same season." 
</P>
<P>
Olsen's homer was his only hit of the game and left him one hit shy of the 
county's single-season record of 51 set in 1985 by Los Alamitos' Robbie 
Katzaroff. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen claimed the county's best-ever season batting average, finishing at .595. 
Steve Evans of Anaheim set the old mark of .585 in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly lost in the record-setting was the two-hit pitching of Fullerton's Rene 
Arias. Arias (8-3) allowed only a double to the first hitter he faced, Steve 
Freidrich, and a fourth-inning leadoff homer to Matt Carter. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (13-12 overall, 7-8 in league play) stopped Troy's 10-game winning 
streak, but Troy (14-9, 11-4) had previously clinched the league title. 
</P>
<P>
In another Freeway League game: 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills 10, Sonora 1 -- Chris Looney pitched a five-hitter, striking out 
nine, to lead Sunny Hills (15-11, 10-5) at Sonora (12-12, 7-8). Jason Sugarman 
had three hits, including a two-run home run in the sixth inning, and Kenny 
Overby had two hits, including a two-run home run in the seventh inning. Steve 
Ashton had three hits, scored twice and had one RBI for Sunny Hills. KEN HILL

<P>
The 11th-ranked Loyola Marymount baseball team plays its last home games of the 
season Sunday in a noon non-conference double-header against U.S. 
International. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions (41-13) lead the West Coast Conference by 3 1/2 games pending 
second-place Pepperdine's three-game series at San Diego this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions and Waves will complete the WCC schedule and decide the conference 
title May 19-20 at Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions, who are completing finals week, will be playing for the first time 
in eight days when they face USIU. The same teams will play a single game 
Tuesday in San Diego to make up an earlier game that was rained out. Loyola won 
the first game, 16-7. 
</P>
<P>
All-American catcher Miah Bradbury has taken over the conference lead in runs 
batted in with 59 and trails Tony Kounas for the team lead in home runs, 15-14. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions' Rick Mediavilla remains the WCC's leading hitter at .410. He has 98 
hits and needs only eight more hits to break Don Sparks' school record set in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
In sweeping a three-game series against Santa Clara last weekend, the Lions 
raised their team average to .338. ALAN DROOZ

SIMI VALLEY WINS; GORDON HELD WITHOUT HOME RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joe Gordon of Simi Valley High came up short in his last shot at the Southern 
Section home run record Thursday when he went zero for four in the season 
finale, a 7-2 nonleague win over visiting L.A. Baptist. 
</P>
<P>
After Simi Valley jumped to a 6-0 first-inning lead, Coach Mike Scyphers 
cleared the bench, replacing every starter but Gordon and pitcher Jeff 
Treadway. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon finished the season with 15 home runs, tying Scott Sharts for the school 
record but leaving him one shy of the Southern Section record of 16 set by 
Channel Islands' Arnold Garcia in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Treadway (4-2), a freshman right-hander, earned the win. He struck out seven 
and allowed three hits in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
In other games: 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills 7, Cleveland 5 -- The Highlanders overcame a three-run deficit to 
earn a wild-card berth in the City Section 4-A Division playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills' Jon Condos was three for three with two runs batted in, and 
Robert Vasquez and Scott Berger each added two hits. Granada Hills (7-15-2 
overall, 5-10-2 in North Valley League play) scored two runs on suicide squeeze 
bunts. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood will play host to the Highlanders in a wild-card game 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real 6, Taft 0 -- Jason Cohen was three for five with a pair of 
doubles, and left-hander Ryan McGuire (6-1) threw a five-hitter to lead El 
Camino Real (18-2-1, 15-1-1) in a West Valley League game at Taft. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Marks and Pat Treend each went two for three for El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth 5, Canoga Park 2 -- Reed McMackin and Danny Rodriguez combined to 
limit Canoga Park to three hits in a West Valley League game at Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
McMackin (10-2) allowed two hits in the first four innings to earn the win, and 
Rodriguez picked up his first save. He pitched three shutout innings and struck 
out five. 
</P>
<P>
Chaminade 4, La Salle 2 -- Ted Corcoran threw a two-hitter and struck out nine 
to lead host Chaminade (16-8-1, 8-2) in a San Fernando Valley League game.

CHATSWORTH NOTCHES SWEEP IN VOLLEYBALL QUARTERFINAL

<TEXT>
<P>
Chatsworth High has three City Section 4-A volleyball championship banners 
hanging on the gymnasium wall. And needless to say, another would be mighty 
nice for the mighty Chancellors. 
</P>
<P>
They are well on their way after after easily defeating Cleveland, 15-9, 15-8, 
16-14, Thursday in a quarterfinal match at Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
There was a brief letdown in the third game, however. A five-point lead became 
a 14-14 tie, but the Chancellors survived the scare after two sideouts and a 
missed kill attempt by Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Chatsworth (13-2), which will meet Palisades in the semifinals 
Tuesday at Chatsworth, played strong defense in the first two games. 
</P>
<P>
In the match, Chatsworth middle blocker Craig Hewitt had 12 kills and 10 
blocks. Ryan Labovitch (12 kills) and Mike Nash (14 kills) also played well. 
Setter Greg Salzberg, who missed the first round because of a cold, recorded 30 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole team was really on today," Coach Steve West said. "We came into this 
game knowing that (Cleveland) was a good team, and we played tough." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland (5-8), seeded No. 8, was led by Chin Tran with eight kills, 10 
assists and nine blocks. Cesar Guttierez added 11 kills and Yan Huang had nine 
kills and 19 assists. 
</P>
<P>
"They were good," Labovitch said. "They chose the right angles and we had 
problems with their block." 
</P>
<P>
The Chancellors, who won City championships in 1981, 1984 and 1989, were 
undefeated in the West Valley League this season. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be especially nice to win the finals this year," Labovitch said. 
"We're almost all graduating and it would be really nice to leave with the 
title."

Granada Hills erased a nine-point deficit to tie the deciding game, but 
Palisades came back and secured a 15-12, 8-15, 6-15, 15-3, 16-14 victory in a

Matt Lackie spent a good part of the season helping Rancho Santiago College win 
the Orange Empire Conference baseball title. 
</P>
<P>
On April 17, the sophomore right-hander pitched a seven-hitter as the Dons 
defeated second-place Golden West, 12-3, to take a 2 1/2-game lead with six 
left. 
</P>
<P>
The victory improved his record to 10-2, but it also turned out to be his last 
appearance for more than two weeks. The day after that victory, Lackie started 
to feel sick. Two days later, he was too ill to attend classes. 
</P>
<P>
He spent most of the next two weeks in bed, waiting for calls from Coach Don 
Sneddon to see how the team did. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so weak," Lackie said, "that all I could do was just lay there. It was 
terrible. But I'm doing much better. I can feel my strength coming back." 
</P>
<P>
At first it was thought to be just the flu, but it was discovered that the 
6-foot-2-inch Lackie had a viral infection. He lost 20 pounds and was down to 
165 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Lackie, from Mission Viejo High School, finally returned to the mound last 
Saturday in Rancho Santiago's final conference game. 
</P>
<P>
But things didn't go too well. 
</P>
<P>
He allowed nine runs, four earned, in 1 2/3 innings of a 14-6 loss to 
Fullerton. Rancho Santiago's defense didn't help, making four errors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been hard to tell how well he's doing," Sneddon said. "Because of the 
heat and our poor defense in the Fullerton game, we didn't get a very good 
read. He got the ground balls he needs to be effective, but we didn't field 
them. He pitched in a squad game Tuesday and was better, but his arm strength 
isn't back yet. We'll start him and just see how far he can go Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
The Dons (32-9) open the Southern California Regional playoffs at home against 
Mt. San Jacinto (20-21) at 2 p.m. today. The teams play again at 11 a.m. 
Saturday in the best-of-three series. Lackie is scheduled to start Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Lackie's recent illness was his second at Rancho Santiago. He had mononucleosis 
and was forced to redshirt in the 1988 season. Last season, he worked in 
relief, getting two victories with a 5.85 earned-run average in 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
He remained a reliever last fall, but was moved to the starting rotation just 
before the season because he was the Dons' most consistent pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Lackie has pitched in a team-high 18 games this season despite missing two 
starts because of his illness. He also had two saves. Lackie was 7-2 with a 
save and a 3.86 ERA in conference games. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the guy that did it all year," Sneddon said. "Now we just have to see 
if he is healthy enough to do it again." 
</P>
<P>
In today's 2 p.m. playoff games: 
</P>
<P>
Mt. San Jacinto (20-21) at Rancho Santiago (32-9) -- Jerry Aschoff (7-3), a 
sophomore left-hander, will start for Rancho Santiago. The Dons led the 
conference with 53 home runs, including 15 by Marty Neff and 10 by Steve Grack. 
Neff had 50 RBIs, Grack had 47 and Conrad Colby 43. Colby was the conference's 
top hitter with a .404 average. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago stole 67 bases in 77 attempts. Left-fielder Jeremy Sherman 
stole 22 in 24 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Cuesta (23-12) at Golden West (25-12) -- Golden West is led by sophomores Frank 
Herman and Robb Carabba and freshmen Gerad Cawhorn and Gary Christopherson. 
Christopherson, a designated hitter, hit .386 and had 10 home runs and 51 RBIs; 
third baseman Cawhorn hit .375 with 15 doubles and 35 RBIs; Herman, a center 
fielder, had a .379 average with 16 doubles and 35 RBIs, and Carabba hit .385. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore right-hander Todd Long (7-3) will start for Golden West. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (24-13) at College of the Canyons (24-12) -- Fullerton will start 
Steve Trachsel (8-3), who was bothered by a tired arm the final two weeks of 
the conference season. He last pitched April 28. Jim Short, a sophomore first 
baseman, hit .326 and 26 of his 47 hits were for extra bases. He had 12 home 
runs, 13 doubles and one triple and drove in 53 runs. Fullerton has 42 home 
runs, 10 by Gary Mota and eight by Tom Wilson.

CLU GAINS SPLIT WITH ADAMS STATE IN SOFTBALL PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal Lutheran fell a run short of a berth in the NAIA softball championships 
Thursday when the Regals dropped the second game of their Bi-District 2 
playoffs at Adams State College in Alamosa, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
The Regals (32-11-2) won the first game of the best-of-three series, 14-1, but 
lost the second, 4-3, forcing a decisive game against Adams State today. 
</P>
<P>
The winner advances to the 16-team national championships at the University of 
West Florida, May 17-19. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran is vying for its third consecutive appearance in the national 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran was trailing, 4-1, with two out in the seventh and final inning of 
the second game before Brenda Lee drove in two runs with a pinch-hit single. 
The threat ended when the next batter was retired on a popup. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't able to play our game," Regal Coach Tony Venditto said. "We didn't 
get our lead batter on base." 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran pitcher DeeAndra Pilkington (17-7), who collected a win and a loss 
on the day, had three hits in the opener, and Danielle Piotrowski, Leslie 
Stevens, Kim White, Alysa Mathews, and Brenda Frafjord each had two.

<TEXT>
<P>
Thurlow Rogers of Van Nuys continued his steady climb up the Tour de Trump 
overall standings Thursday, recording his best stage performance for the second 
consecutive day. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers finished 25th in the rain-plagued 120.5-mile Stroudsburg, Pa., to New 
Paltz, N.Y., road race, covering the distance in 5 hours 22 minutes 25 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Zanoli of the Netherlands won the stage in 5:18.11. Rogers' previous 
best finish was 26th in Wednesday's Lehigh Valley, Pa., circuit race. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers, 126th after the first day, is currently in 34th place overall. He is 21 
minutes 26 seconds behind leader Viatcheslav Bobrik of the Soviet Union. The 
11-day, 1,107-mile race continues today with a 49.7-mile circuit race through 
New York City's Central Park. STEVEN HERBERT

Saudis to Expand Oil Output Capacity: Saudi Arabia will soon start a 
multibillion-dollar oil production capacity expansion program aimed at keeping 
the kingdom the world's biggest oil exporter in the next century, industry 
sources said. Saudi Arabian Oil Co., or Saudi Aramco, is expected to award 
contracts in June for oil field facilities and equipment upgrading that will 
push its sustainable outut to around 10 million barrels per day in the next 10 
years from the current average of 6.5 million to 7 million barrels per day. The 
cost of the project is estimated to be somewhere between $12 billion and $15 
billion.

ALTERNATIVE TO COSTLY SUPERCOMPUTERS; 
</P>
<P>
TECHNOLOGY: AMT OF IRVINE BELIEVES THAT THE "MASSIVELY PARALLEL PROCESSING" 
FIELD HAS GAINED LEGITIMACY BUT NEEDS COMPATIBLE SOFTWARE TO GET INTO THE 
MARKETPLACE.

<TEXT>
<P>
Active Memory Technology Inc. has made its mark with super-fast computers that 
can perform dizzying tasks involving millions of calculations such as creating 
a precise, three-dimensional image of a DNA molecule, or searching for booby 
traps in a mine field. 
</P>
<P>
But Geoff Manning, chairman and chief executive of the small Orange County 
company, doesn't want AMT's computers to be locked in guarded research 
laboratories and worshiped like a national treasure. Instead, Manning aims to 
sell to mainstream corporate users at a price that delivers more bang for the 
buck than some supercomputers. 
</P>
<P>
Manning's challenge is to wait until corporate America and other big technology 
users such as hospitals, universities and the military are ready to develop the 
software that could take full advantage of his machines. 
</P>
<P>
After 3 1/2 years and $17 million in financing, AMT is a leader in the 
so-called "massively parallel processing" field with 1989 sales of $7 million, 
up from $6.5 million in 1988. But the company isn't profitable yet and has been 
troubled by management turnover: Its former chief executive quit four months 
ago, forcing Manning to step in to fill that job. 
</P>
<P>
And several other parallel computer companies with similar goals as AMT have 
given up waiting for the market to develop and have gone out of business. 
</P>
<P>
"Aficionados would say massively parallel processing has taken a long time to 
develop a market," Manning said. "But I believe it is now accepted as the only 
way to move computing forward." 
</P>
<P>
AMT, Thinking Machines of Boston, Intel Scientific Computers of Portland, Ore., 
MasPar in Sunnyvale and a half-dozen other makers of massively parallel 
computers are taking a chance that computing's future lies in their particular 
approach to making faster machines. 
</P>
<P>
The traditional "serial" computer, which has been the primary computer 
architecture for three decades, has a smart central processor that receives 
data in a single stream from main memory and solves one problem one at a time. 
</P>
<P>
But as performance demands heighten, serial computers are slowed by something 
called the "Von Neumann bottleneck," named after mathematician John Von 
Neumann, who dreamed up the idea of a central processor in 1946. The 
bottleneck, which results as data flows to a computer's central processor, is 
like a traffic jam on a bridge with a single toll booth. 
</P>
<P>
Massively parallel processors, on the other hand, use anywhere from 1,000 to 
64,000 simple processors that together work on different pieces of a problem. 
The process more closely mimics the way the human brain works, researchers say, 
and would be like adding thousands of toll gates to that toll bridge to unlock 
the traffic jam. 
</P>
<P>
Breakthroughs in both component manufacturing and computer design have enabled 
AMT to build a machine that can outperform minicomputers at the same price. 
While parallel systems cannot beat conventional computers in some tasks, such 
as balancing a checkbook, they perform well in tasks with intensive amounts of 
uniform data to process, such as analyzing a satellite image. 
</P>
<P>
While parallel processing computers have been around since the 1970s, they have 
been largely ignored for commercial applications because of the difficulty of 
developing software to run on the machines, said Chris Willard, a supercomputer 
analyst at Dataquest, a San Jose market research firm. 
</P>
<P>
But as parallel processors become faster, and traditional supercomputer 
designers run into physical barriers that limit their performance gains, the 
parallel approach is gaining legitimacy, Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
That view was underscored by reports out of Tokyo last week that Japan's 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry is planning a major research 
program to develop massively parallel processing. With such an effort, Japan's 
leading supercomputer makers -- Hitachi Ltd., Fujitsu Ltd. and NEC Corp. -- 
could start playing catch-up with the American parallel computer makers. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's moves are "a sign of legitimacy, or rather a reaction to the legitimacy 
of applications that have been developed," said Danny Hillis, founding 
scientist at Thinking Machines. While some believe that the Japanese face a 
daunting task in catching up on a decade of software development in the United 
States, Hillis takes no comfort in that argument and says U.S. companies will 
face intensified pressure to find commercial markets. 
</P>
<P>
Manning agreed, noting that "once (the Japanese) start, they go very fast." 
</P>
<P>
The United States, Hillis said, staked out a lead in parallel computing with 
help from the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which began 
funding research into the field in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to Thinking Machines, AMT isn't aiming to build the world's fastest 
computer for the scientific community. Instead, AMT is focusing on users in the 
defense, commercial and academic fields. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, AMT has introduced three generations of its parallel computers. In 
late April, AMT unveiled the DAP/CP8 series, which is 40 times faster than the 
company's first machine. To keep pace with competitors, Manning wants to 
improve speeds by a factor of 25 by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
AMT's machines are connected to Sun Microsystems Inc. or Digital Equipment 
Corp. workstations and employ between 1,024 and 4,096 processors. They sell for 
$120,000 to $415,000 and reach speeds in the low-end supercomputer range. 
</P>
<P>
The medical school at Washington University in St. Louis has purchased two AMT 
computers to help it speed up the process of scanning images to detect tumors 
in humans. Instead of waiting days for a minicomputer to generate sharp scanner 
images, the AMT machines complete the task in minutes, said Robert Morley, an 
associate professor of electrical engineering. 
</P>
<P>
"A supercomputer would have cost millions of dollars, and that would have been 
out of the question," Morley said. 
</P>
<P>
Willard, the Dataquest analyst, said parallel processing has potential in 
commercial markets. He said the market for such computers has sprouted from 
$8.5 million in 1984 to $75 million in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the progress, "this is an industry waiting for the users to catch up 
with it," Willard said. "No one has figured out how to use the potential 
because it takes a lot of rethinking when writing software." 
</P>
<P>
Through its former owner, British-based International Computers Ltd., which 
spun off 80% of AMT in 1986, the Irvine firm has developed software based on a 
modified version of the Fortran programming language. Manning said the software 
gives the company a head start on would-be challengers. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, AMT has sold only about 75 computers. Thinking Machines has sold 60 
computers since 1983, while MasPar has sold seven since introducing its first 
line in January. 
</P>
<P>
Manning's biggest goal is to secure a significant sale to a defense customer or 
major oil company to help defray the costs of future product development. 
</P>
<P>
But he worries that other larger companies such as International Business 
Machines Corp., which has invested in a small parallel computer firm founded by 
former Cray Research chief scientist Steve Chen, may muscle in on AMT's 
territory.

SPORTS CLUBS LIKELY TO PLAY TUG OF WAR WITH NEW CUSTOMERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's the dueling health clubs again. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest dispatches from the workout war here, the super-snazzy Sports 
Club/Irvine says new members are getting harder to find, and a competitor 
across the street could make customers even scarcer when it starts to build its 
Sporting Club soon. 
</P>
<P>
At the extra-spiffy Sports Club/Irvine along the San Diego Freeway, the stream 
of new memberships has slowed since the club opened over the winter. So far 
about 4,500 health-conscious office workers have paid the stiff initiation fees 
to join. (The cheapest is $550 and they run up to $1,500.) 
</P>
<P>
But April was slow, and May's looking the same way, say the owners. The club 
can handle 1,700 customers a day; so far it's not even seeing 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
"And if the other guy builds, we'll never reach capacity," grumbles Michael 
Talla, president of Los Angeles' Sports Club Co. and one of the club's owners. 
</P>
<P>
When last heard from, the other guy, San Diego developer Naiman Co., was saying 
it was just a hop, skip and a jump from building its ballyhooed new Sporting 
Club. That was last summer. Then it was December. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, workers are actually grading a patch of ground near John Wayne 
Airport, and construction may begin as soon as next month. 
</P>
<P>
The delay proved fatal to the proposed kayak run, however, which now exists 
only in old press releases. It's been dumped from the health club's plans. And 
Naiman is trying to figure out other ways to cut construction and operating 
costs after building plans came in over budget. 
</P>
<P>
The Sporting Club will have to go a way to upstage the Sports Club/Irvine, 
which has all the usual stuff: exercise bicycles, weights and a running track. 
But it also has some Southern California touches: valet parking, a cafe, a 
conference room and a child-care center. 
</P>
<P>
Sports Club also owns the ultra-chic Sports Club/LA, where the elite meet to 
pump iron, check their pulse rates and eye each other's sweat suits. Those who 
know about these things, like the writers at People magazine, credit the Los 
Angeles club with starting a whole new trend toward posh health clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Naiman, on the other hand, has been opening its own opulent workout palaces all 
over the country, which may have distracted it from the business at hand in 
Irvine. Whatever the problem, Naiman has been slow to get building approvals 
from the city here. The company should have a building permit in hand and be 
starting construction by June, its landlord now says. 
</P>
<P>
The second club almost didn't get started. Awhile back, the two club owners -- 
worried two such clubs might be too much for the Irvine market -- talked about 
joining forces and building only one club. Talla, the owner of Sports 
Club/Irvine, still insists two such plush clubs can't succeed so close 
together, although he may be trying to psych out the competition. 
</P>
<P>
Why would Naiman persist in such a risky gamble as building the second club? 
</P>
<P>
First, the company says, it really believes that the market can bear two fancy 
clubs. But more important may be the fact Naiman simply committed itself to 
build the thing long before it became clear what a huge head start its 
competitor would have. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's a little matter of a 75-year lease signed with Laguna Niguel 
developer Birtcher Co., which owns the land. And Birtcher really wants the 
club: It will make the company's nearby high-rise office building at the 
Lakeshore Towers office project more appealing to tenants when the building 
opens next spring. (That's the reason so many of these new clubs get built near 
office buildings. In fact, the other club is part of Koll Center Irvine North, 
another office project.) 
</P>
<P>
Birtcher has lowered Naiman's rent and passed up "a significant amount" of 
revenues from the lease to help the club, the developer says. 
</P>
<P>
"We restructured the lease because the folks across the street opened first, 
and we wanted to encourage Naiman to build their club," said Bill Kearns, the 
Birtcher executive in charge of Lakeshore Towers. 
</P>
<P>
With office vacancy rates above 20% in Orange County and millions of feet of 
office space going begging for tenants -- and with one boxy glass office tower 
looking very much like another these days -- it helps a landlord to have a 
little something on the competition, like a health club or a fancy restaurant 
near his building. It also makes local government happy because a health club 
means some of the office workers are going down to burn calories after work 
instead of jumping into rush-hour traffic.

INSIDER-TRADING TRIAL OF BROKER, MAGAZINE PRINTER OPENS IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff and wire reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A government attorney told a federal jury in Los Angeles Wednesday that a 
former Orange County stockbroker and a Torrance printer knew that they were 
breaking insider trading laws when they used advance information from Business 
Week to make profits in stock trades. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers argued that Brian J. Callahan, a former stockbroker for 
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in Anaheim, and William N. Jackson, a one-time 
printer for R. R. Donnelley &amp; Sons, did not realize that they were doing 
anything wrong in making the trades. 
</P>
<P>
Those arguments came in the first day of a jury trial in a civil suit filed in 
January by the Securities and Exchange Commission against the two men. The SEC 
alleges that the men violated securities law when they used advance information 
from a Business Week "Inside Wall Street" column to buy stocks. 
</P>
<P>
The suit is one of five the SEC has filed nationwide involving insider trading 
on advance knowledge of the contents of the Business Week stock column. 
</P>
<P>
In this suit, the SEC alleges that Callahan and several brokerage clients made 
at least $19,684 from an illicit scheme and that Jackson made illegal profits 
of $19,506 for himself and two brothers. 
</P>
<P>
The printer and the broker made at least 53 trades between July, 1987, and 
July, 1988, before their scheme was discovered, SEC attorney Jeffrey Zuckerman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In opening statements before U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson, Zuckerman 
said the "Inside Wall Street" column contains "the most highly sensitive 
information" that "generally affects the stock market." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was a quality analyst who checked the color on Business Week's pages at 
Donnelley's Torrance plant, which prints the magazine. He had access to the 
magazine on Wednesday evening; the magazine is not officially released until 
Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC charges that Jackson used that information to make trades with 
Callahan. The stockbroker, Zuckerman said, "suggested ways to refine the scheme 
and maximize profits" by giving Jackson the lowest commission rate and helping 
him to select the stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's attorney, Jack I. Samet, told jurors that his client "didn't believe 
he was doing anything wrong and did not think he was breaking his employer's 
rules -- and he wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
The attorney representing Callahan, J. Joseph Connolly, said Callahan did not 
learn that Jackson worked at the printing house until a month before 
Prudential-Bache fired him. Callahan was fired in July, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC is seeking a court order barring the defendants from future insider 
trading and also asks that they be required to repay illegal profits, plus pay 
a penalty equal to three times the amount of illegal profits.

CONFRONTING LOSS IN 'CHERRY ORCHARD'; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE: CHEKHOV'S ENDURING PLAY HITS HOME FOR ACTRESS LYNN REDGRAVE, DIRECTOR 
TOM MOORE AND THE PLAYHOUSE ITSELF.

<TEXT>
<P>
The proof of the poetry in Anton Chekhov's plays is their durability. Like a 
divining rod, they continue to plunge into the emotional life of everyone who 
touches them, opening up fresh wells of feeling every time. 
</P>
<P>
For director Tom Moore, Chekhov's "The Cherry Orchard," opening Sunday at the 
La Jolla Playhouse's Mandell Weiss Theatre, is more than a story of a great 
estate that must be sold if a certain sum of money isn't raised by August. He 
stresses the universal story of individual loss. 
</P>
<P>
"The range of the play is so great," Moore said. "It encompasses your entire 
life because it is continually fresh. Whenever you do a production of it, it 
has to do with your life." 
</P>
<P>
Moore looks into the script and sees his own memories: his parents' separation 
when he was 8 years old and later their deaths -- first his mother's, then his 
father's. 
</P>
<P>
But, for Lynn Redgrave who stars as Mme. Ranevsky, the stylish and charismatic 
owner of the orchard who must now set her wits to saving it, the play makes her 
think of the loss of her father, Sir Michael Redgrave, who received acclaim for 
his portrayal of Vanya in Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya." 
</P>
<P>
And for theatergoers who have been watching the financial struggles of the La 
Jolla Playhouse over the past year, they see the perfect tale to start a season 
that almost didn't happen because of money troubles. Not only does the 
production, like the script, begin in May when the cherry orchard is in bloom, 
but, just as Mme. Ranevsky is desperately trying to raise money, the Playhouse 
itself, in bloom with this play, is still trying to meet its $1-million 
fund-raising goal by June 30. 
</P>
<P>
If the play is about the Playhouse at its most stressed and stretched, it is 
also about what the Playhouse does best: giving top artists a chance to work on 
the projects of their dreams with the artists of their choice. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cherry Orchard" was a dream project for Moore and Redgrave, who have 
wanted both to work together and to work at the Playhouse for years. 
</P>
<P>
Their acquaintance dates back to "Fridays," an ill-fated television takeoff on 
Saturday Night Live that Moore directed and Redgrave once guest-starred on in 
the early 1980s. Her most memorable skit was "The Eleven Faces of Muriel," in 
which she played a woman with multiple personalities, including Ethel Merman 
and Connie Chung. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody got my Connie Chung," she said ruefully on the set of "The Cherry 
Orchard." 
</P>
<P>
For Moore, who directed the long-running hit musical "Grease" and has been 
nominated twice for Tonys (for the Pulitzer Prize-winning " 'night, Mother" and 
"Over Here"), Redgrave's performance was his one good memory from a TV show he 
would prefer to forget. 
</P>
<P>
"She's an actress of great depth and range," said Moore. "She's a well-known 
personality who is also capable of hard work, which doesn't necessarily happen 
together. She has a lot of life on stage, and she wants to tackle the hard 
roles. And this is one of them." 
</P>
<P>
He also values her sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of melancholy and ennui in Chekhov, but there is also a lot of 
fun. You suffer, but when you can laugh, you do." 
</P>
<P>
For Redgrave, a frequent face on television ("House Calls" and "Chicken Soup") 
who makes it a point to perform on stage at least once a year, the opportunity 
to work with Moore was an offer she couldn't resist. 
</P>
<P>
"I particularly liked ' 'night, Mother.' And there really aren't many theater 
directors who go out and direct theater anymore." 
</P>
<P>
That, in fact, could have been said of Moore, for whom "The Cherry Orchard" 
will be a return to the stage after four years of directing television shows 
such as "thirtysomething," "L.A. Law," "The Wonder Years" and a variety of 
television movies. 
</P>
<P>
Then, too, the Playhouse was a powerful calling card for both stars. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw 'Romeo and Juliet' with Amanda Plummer and John Vickery at the Playhouse 
in its first year, and I really liked it," said Redgrave. "So I called up Des 
McAnuff," he said of the artistic director of the theater, "and said, 'Can I do 
a Shakespeare with you?' " 
</P>
<P>
Their schedules didn't coincide until 1985, and it wasn't a Shakespeare piece. 
Redgrave was set to do Anton Chekhov's "The Seagull" in La Jolla, but her 
Broadway run of "Aren't We All?" with Rex Harrison and Claudette Colbert was 
extended, and she had to cancel. She jumped at the opportunity to do "The 
Cherry Orchard," which will be her first Chekhov play. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm nervous," she said with a smile. "Nerves don't get any better with 
experience. I woke up several times during the night (before the first preview 
Tuesday)." 
</P>
<P>
But the play has also been restorative for her. Mme. Ranevsky may forfeit her 
past in the play, but Redgrave, who comes from a long line of actors, reclaims 
hers every time she performs on stage. 
</P>
<P>
Redgrave deeply misses her father, who died in 1985. And this play brings her 
closer to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a great sense of family along with my sister and brother, three acting 
nieces and a student-acting daughter. We all have the sense of carrying on a 
family tradition. I very strongly conjure up before a performance a memory of 
the generations of actors in my family and find strength in that." 
</P>
<P>
Moore was motivated to return to the theater with this play because, "I missed 
working on a piece of literature that one is incredibly passionate about." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes that passion comes at a price. It was his extreme disappointment over 
his first Broadway flop, "Frankenstein," that allowed him to pour frustration, 
pain and a feeling of vulnerability into Chekhov's "The Three Sisters" at the 
American Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco, which was one of his great 
successes. 
</P>
<P>
The Cherry Orchard "is much more synthesized," Moore said. "By the time he 
wrote this, he was quite ill. He died six months later. He was writing about 
his own death." 
</P>
<P>
It is that sense that Moore is trying to capture. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't do Chekhov until you've experienced loss and frustration. Our best 
production of Chekhov would be if we all got together just before we died."

<P>
The Coach House in San Juan Capistrano will host a benefit May 19 for Stop the 
Pain Inc., a Santa Ana-based organization devoted to helping victims of child 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
The lineup for the 6 p.m. show features an array of strong local talent. 
Performers include Kerry Getz, Ann De Jarnett and Jim Bemis, Naked Soul, Don't 
Mean Maybe, 3D Picnic, Wood &amp; Smoke and the Beat Pests. 
</P>
<P>
Advance tickets, priced at $6, are available at the Coach House and through 
Moby Disc in Westminster, Music Mart and London Exchange in Costa Mesa and Pier 
Records at UC Irvine. Tickets cost $10 at the door. Information: (714) 
496-8930. 
</P>
<P>
Other newly booked shows at the Coach House include Venice on May 25; Beat 
Farmers and Food For Feet, June 1; Shawn Colvin, June 12; Pato Banton, June 18; 
Dennis Quaid and the Swamp Tones, June 22; Albert King, June 29; and Natalie 
Cole, Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
BYRDS WON'T ROOST: The May 16 Byrds show advertised at Hamptons will not take 
place. The booking was not solidified with a deposit, according to the band's 
agent, and the group has accepted an offer to play in Tulsa, Okla., instead. 
</P>
<P>
The version of the Byrds that had been scheduled to play at Hamptons includes 
only one original Byrd, drummer Michael Clarke. A Florida judge last year 
awarded Clarke the right to continue touring under the Byrds name, throwing out 
a legal challenge that had been mounted by Clarke's better-known former band 
mates, David Crosby, Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1989, Crosby, McGuinn and Hillman played a series of Southern 
California dates, including a show at the Coach House, as part of their failed 
attempt to wrest legal control of the Byrds name away from Clarke. 
</P>

Hans Prager's Yankee Tavern has drawn a large, steady stream of patrons since 
the day it opened last year, just plain folks who come for all-American fare 
like pot roast, succotash and blueberry cobbler. Now I'm happy to say that any 
of the restaurant's opening wrinkles have been totally ironed out. 
</P>
<P>
I enjoyed a delightful dinner there this week; the service was speedier than I 
remembered, and the food tasted more American than ever. Maine lobster bisque 
is one of the best I've ever tasted -- rich, ruddy and velvety smooth, with 
chunks of lobster like sunken treasure on the bottom. A large, tender T-bone 
steak comes with perfect onion straws, lightly dredged in flour and crispy as 
can be. 
</P>
<P>
There is an excellent stuffed chicken that will remind you of the holiday 
season, complete with cranberry relish and a medley of julienned vegetables. 
And Monday nights even feature a clambake, with steamers, fresh lobster, boiled 
potatoes and corn. 
</P>
<P>
Don't forget about the excellent desserts. The restaurant's strawberry 
shortcake, a superbly flaky sweet biscuit with a mountain of berries and fresh 
whipped cream, has no equal in the area. Cobblers and cakes are exemplary, too. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant retains its harbor-side Cape Cod look. The enormous windows and 
high-beamed ceiling give the room a lofty, spacious look, and the framed 
watercolors of ships and nautical scenes recall a small-town art gallery. Now 
Prager has added a champagne brunch on Sundays, featuring such down-home dishes 
as silver dollar-size blueberry pancakes with Vermont maple syrup, poached eggs 
with grilled ham and cheddar cheese rarebit, and skillet-browned roast beef 
hash. The price includes fruit, fresh breads and muffins, and domestic 
champagne. I can't wait for Sunday.

CONCEPTUAL PREGO MENU READS BETTER THAN IT PLAYS 
</P>

<P>
Prego is still one of Orange County's most impressively designed restaurants: a 
gorgeous Tuscan villa with high vaulted ceilings and a gleaming open kitchen 
along one wall, dominated by a huge rotating brass rotisserie. Soaring glass 
panels separate the dining areas. Monster tropical plants dominate the 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
The menu has been carefully designed here, too. This is a concept restaurant 
where everything from breadsticks to mints have been market-tested and given a 
stamp of approval by the corporate fathers of the upscale Spectrum restaurant 
chain. Perhaps that accounts for the restaurant's unbridled success. Prego has 
been jammed to the rafters with a well-heeled clientele from Day One and shows 
no signs of slowing down. 
</P>
<P>
The cuisine is Tuscan, sort of. Dishes are simple and direct: homemade pastas, 
simple sauces, grilled meats served with roasted potatoes. The new executive 
chef, Luigi Giordani, is actually a Roman, rather than a Tuscan, and plans to 
introduce more of his own regional dishes in the near future, if the company 
lets him. 
</P>
<P>
The former chef, Tim Dobravolskis, has moved up the corporate ladder and now 
oversees five of Spectrum's Southern California kitchens. "We get everyone from 
Newport Beach yuppie to Anaheim local -- everything from Topsider to tuxedo," 
Dobravolskis said by phone recently, "So we aim to play it safe. The concept 
has worked so far, so why tamper with success?" 
</P>
<P>
I can think of one reason. Prego is a stunning restaurant, but it just isn't as 
good as it could be. The truth is, I am never as happy eating off this menu as 
I am reading it. It isn't in playing it safe that the restaurant occasionally 
slips up. It's a simple matter of cooking. "In a restaurant of this size," 
Dobravolskis said, "you have to depend on your line cooks." Sorry, Tim, but 
these guys can be awfully erratic. 
</P>
<P>
Why else would well-conceived dishes made from first-rate ingredients fail to 
impress? Sadly overcooked spaghettini spoil a wonderfully rich, grainy pesto 
sauce. Luganega (thin coiled sausages) come flanked by vegetables quite sodden 
with olive oil, making a little pool on the bottom of the plate. A pool of high 
grade olive oil, to be sure. 
</P>
<P>
That said, there are many things to relish from Prego's kitchen. The antipasti 
are uniformly delicious. Soncino con anitra is a tempting salad of mache, cold 
roasted duck breast, goat cheese and balsamic vinegar; an intelligent blend of 
northern Italy and California. Insalata al salmone affumicato is arugula topped 
with lightly smoked salmon, bow-tie pasta and plenty of capers. It sounds 
quirky but works like a charm. 
</P>
<P>
The pizzas are even better. They generally have a thick crust and are the ideal 
size as an intermediate course for about three people. My favorite among them 
is pizza alla salsiccia, topped with chunky sausage, salami, fresh tomato sauce 
and oregano, all partially concealed under a blanket of bubbling mozzarella. 
</P>
<P>
But the best things served at Prego come from that rotisserie: duck, rabbit, 
chicken and/or leg of lamb, all of which you'll smell as you enter the 
restaurant, long before you see them. I have tasted only the duck and the lamb, 
but I am willing to predict that the other two are every bit as terrific. All 
the meats here are rubbed with fresh rosemary and sage, an irresistible 
perfection of nature, and look as well dressed as most of the customers. 
</P>
<P>
The pastas are a different story. Trenette alle cozze affumicate, a narrow, 
linguine-like pasta, was good in itself but came with smoked mussels that were 
hard and chewy and tasted canned. Agnolotti d'aragosta is a dish of 
crescent-shaped pockets filled with lobster, prosciutto and ricotta in lemon 
and lobster sauce that never quite lives up to its billing. I couldn't taste 
anything but ricotta in the filling, though the sauce was so good I didn't 
leave a single drop. 
</P>
<P>
Neither are the grills, as distinguished from the spit-roasted dishes, always 
good. Grilled salmon, a daily special, was dry and salty, hardly the chic way 
to prepare salmon these days. But pollo all'aiglio e rosmarino, Prego's 
trademark garlic chicken breast with rosemary, fared much better with its crisp 
blackened skin and a lemon flavor permeating every bite. 
</P>
<P>
As for desserts, there are the usual northern Italian offerings; gelati, 
tiramisu, semifreddo and various pastries. The tiramisu is especially good: a 
fat, indulgent one with a double portion of mascarpone and what must be a 
tablespoon of cocoa per slice. 
</P>
<P>
I do have a couple of bones to pick with Prego regarding service: The seating 
can be awfully rigid here, so you had better arrive bang on time for your 
reservation. We were exactly 10 minutes late one evening and waited half an 
hour for a table. The kitchen can be sluggish, too. While you are waiting for 
your first course, it's easy to fill up on those good bread sticks -- but 
that's hardly what you have come for. 
</P>
<P>
I should also say something about the wine list, on the menu's left page. 
There's a wide variety of good Italian wines on this list, and I especially 
urge you to try one. Times wine writer Dan Berger recommends an '83 Chianti 
Classico Machiavelli for $18 and an '84 Barolo Ceretto for $33. Interestingly, 
if you show a lot of interest in wine they may bring out a short, erratically 
priced list that does have some real bargains on it. On Dan Berger's word I 
tried the '88 Ca' del Bosco Chardonnay ($30) and found it delightfully fruity 
and springlike. 
</P>
<P>
For all its grand style, Prego is moderately priced. Antipasti are $4.85 to 
$8.75. Pizzas are $6.95 to $10.95. Pastas are $8.50 to $11.75. Grills are $9.95 
to $17.50. Desserts are $3.95 to $4.95.

The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews. 
</P>
<P>
* The Cat and Custard Cup, 800 E. Whittier Blvd., La Habra. (213) 694-3812 or 
(714) 996-6496. Open Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.; 
Mondays from 5:30 to 9 p.m., Tuesdays through Fridays till 10 p.m., Saturdays 
till 10:30 p.m., and Sundays from 5 to 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Cafe El Cholo, 840 E. Whittier Blvd., La Habra. (213) 694-4600 or (714) 
525-1320. Open Mondays through Saturdays from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., Sundays 
from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Cat and Custard Cup and Cafe El Cholo are located across a La Habra parking 
lot from one another and their themes couldn't be more divergent. One is a 
lovingly reconstructed English pub with a campy Continental menu and dark, 
medieval trappings. The other is bright, festive and Mexican, with fajitas, 
guacamole and frosty margaritas. Both are charming, cheerful, and worth a wide 
detour. 
</P>
<P>
* 3-6-9 Shanghai, 613 N. Euclid St., Anaheim. (714) 635-8319. Open daily except 
Sundays from 11:30 a.m., Mondays through Thursdays till 9:30 p.m., Fridays and 
Saturdays till 10. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best small Chinese restaurants in the heavily ethnic San Gabriel 
Valley, 3-6-9 Shanghai has opened this storefront sister in an Anaheim shopping 
mall, bringing nearly all of its popular dishes. Handmade breads and savory 
dumpling preparations excel here along with such exotic cold appetizers as tea 
smoked chicken and braised baby bamboo. The restaurant is cheap and basic; tell 
them to tread lightly on the MSG. The steamed pork with rice powder is a 
revelation. 
</P>
<P>
* The Dining Room at the Ritz-Carlton, 33533 Ritz-Carlton Drive, Dana Point. 
(714) 240-5008. Open nightly for dinner from 6 to 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
A meal at the Dining Room at the Ritz-Carlton is always a memorable experience, 
but in some instances the memories tend to be a bit flawed. Amidst the 
beautiful surroundings, elegant service and well-heeled clientele, chef Fabrice 
Canelle has introduced a creative, eccentric but imperfect cuisine, a blend of 
French, Californian and international influences. The menu is small, and dishes 
have a tendency toward the sweet. Salads, Sonoma duck liver, lamb and 
outstanding desserts are the hallmarks. 
</P>
<P>
* Voila Bistro and Grill, 16871 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach. (714) 841-1166. 
Open Tuesdays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., Tuesdays through 
Saturdays from 5 to 10 p.m., Sundays from 4:30 to 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
A new local dining spot, Voila Bistro and Grill is a surprising find indeed, a 
combination of Paris casual and Huntington Beach chic. Chef Rochelle Robinson 
turns a brilliant onion soup -- a bistro classic -- and does fine braised duck 
and lamb dishes. Dessert souffles such as chocolate and lemon are on the varied 
menu, and given proper notice the chef will even make a cheese souffle. Salads, 
pizzas and a respectable little wine list fill things out nicely. 
</P>
<P>
* Heritage Brewing Company, 24921 Dana Point Harbor Drive, Dana Point. (714) 
240-2060. Open Sundays through Thursdays from 11:30 a.m. to midnight, Fridays 
and Saturdays till 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Heritage Brewing Company has the somewhat dubious distinction of being Orange 
County's only brewpub, a rowdy place with dart boards, foosball and a young, 
party crazed crowd. If the beer had any flavor at all one could even call the 
place lively. Four brews are offered -- pale ale, golden ale, Irish red and 
Dana porter -- along with a variety of salads, finger foods and sandwiches, the 
best of which is beef on wick, wafer-thin roast beef on a salted bun. The 
burgers aren't bad. 
</P>
<P>
* Kotobuki, 24356 Avenida de la Carlota, Laguna Hills. (714) 587-0290. Open 
Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., Mondays through Saturdays 
from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Totally awesome. That's how Hiro Watanabe, sushi-maker extraordinaire, 
describes most of his creations at Kotobuki, his pint-size, big-hearted new 
Japanese restaurant. Hiro-san's food has a quirky appeal -- from Philadelphia 
roll (crab, avocado and cream cheese) to the more authentic preparations such 
as uni (sea urchin) and hamachi (yellowtail). Put yourself in the chef's hands 
and let him do his thing. He probably will anyway. 
</P>
<P>
* Panda Inn, 2 Center Point Drive, La Palma. (714) 522-6082. Open daily from 11 
a.m. to 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Panda Inn, an upscale Chinese restaurant chain, recently arrived in La Palma. 
It can credit its success to its attractive, mildly Americanized 
interpretations of traditional Mandarin cuisine. Purists beware. Shy away from 
the complicated fare (lemon this, orange that) and stick to basics: the 
well-crafted soups, the excellent lamb and pork dishes, and the first-rate 
sauteed vegetables. Don't go home without a serving of mango pudding for 
dessert. It is a real palate cleanser, with a refreshing taste. 
</P>
<P>
* Ciao, 1730 E. 17th St., Santa Ana. (714) 972-3101. Open Mondays through 
Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m., Saturdays from 4:30 to 9:30. 
</P>
<P>
Ciao is one of those indistinct little neighborhood restaurants you can drive 
by 100 times without noticing, but it happens to be an exceptional one. Bina 
Crivello, a Sicilian mater familias who runs the restaurant with the help of 
her five sons, makes most of the food herself: crusty pizzas, earthy pastas, 
and a good rich tomato sauce to go with them. Bring a hefty appetite, and leave 
room for the excellent tiramisu -- intense, mocha rich, and drooling mascarpone 
cheese. 
</P>
<P>
* Morell's, in the Irvine Hilton, 17900 Jamboree Road, Irvine. (714) 863-3111. 
Open daily except except Sunday from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., 6 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
Morell's is one hotel restaurant making an obvious effort to keep up with the 
times, but one still comes away with the impression that instituitional 
practices die hard. It's a quietly elegant room done up in various shades of 
pink, and there is a formal quality to the service. Appetizers such as 
sweetbreads and smoked salmon are among the strong suits. Desserts are visual 
stunners. The basically sound main dishes suffer occasionally from a desire to 
impress. 
</P>
<P>
* Singapore Corner, 1401 S. Coast Highway, Laguna Beach. (714) 494-0787. Open 
Tuesdays through Sundays from 7:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Tan and Ruby Barkineyn, Singaporean and Indonesian respectively, serve 
up credible versions of their native dishes at this hole-in-the-wall breakfast 
joint. Satay, the region's most famous dish, is grilled skewers of various 
meats eaten with spicy peanut sauce. Nasi rames is a quintet of pleasantly 
unfamiliar dishes surrounding a mound of white rice. Ask Tan about specials, 
which range from yellow rice noodles to various things eaten from banana 
leaves. Laughably inexpensive. 
</P>
<P>
* Emperor's Fortune, 3820 Plaza Drive, Santa Ana. (714) 850-9008. Open Mondays 
through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., Saturdays till 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Emperor's Fortune is the latest incarnation in haute Chinese, a Hong 
Kong-elegant dining room designed with obvious expense. Everything is 
well-crafted, even if the taste spectrum tends to be on the bland side, and 
there is considerable imagination in the presentations. Peking duck, with an 
amazingly crispy skin, is the big hitter, and you will want to try such dishes 
as Shrimp Go Nuts, mussels in garlic sauce, and any of the wonderful desserts 
(from Grand Finale). Expect to have your wallet lightened considerably. 
</P>
<P>
* Showley-Wrightson, 2531 Eastbluff Drive, Newport Beach. (714) 760-9700. Open 
Mondays through Fridays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., Tuesdays through Saturdays from 
6 to 9:30. 
</P>
<P>
 Showley-Wrightson is an unlikely little gem of a restaurant, hidden away in a 
tony Newport Beach shopping center (the owners have tried to infuse the place 
with atmosphere, but it still looks like an upscale grocery store with tables). 
Wonderful breads like fougasse and a dense walnut loaf begin the proceedings, 
and there is a wide array of entrees and desserts to choose from, all made on 
the premises. Don't miss risottos, grilled smoked beef, or the flourless 
chocolate cake. They pack picnic baskets, too.

ACTORS PAY THE RENT TO REVIVE THEATER; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE: THE 50-MEMBER COMPANY OPENS ITS FIRST SEASON WITH DAVID RABE'S 'IN THE 
BOOM BOOM ROOM.' 
</P>

<P>
Above Jerry's Deli in Studio City is a 48-seat theater that until January was 
the home of the Donald O'Connor Family Theater. After a rent hike, however, the 
theater decided to close its doors. 
</P>
<P>
But this being Los Angeles, as soon as it folded, another group of actors was 
waiting in the wings. And now the space is the home of the Company of 
Characters. 
</P>
<P>
Headed by Herb Mitchell -- a former stockbroker and businessman who turned to 
acting 10 years ago -- the 50-member company is ready to start its first 
season. It opens tonight with David Rabe's "In the Boom Boom Room" and ends in 
the fall with "Fiddler on the Roof" -- a production that will also play the 
900-seat Komedy Theater in Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
To help the company survive, Mitchell realizes he will have to take a different 
tack. After all, after opening in November, 1988, the Donald O'Connor Theater 
experienced a modicum of success. 
</P>
<P>
During its 15 months at the Studio City location, it produced four main-stage 
productions, beginning with "Charley's Aunt," starring Donald O'Connor, and 
ending with "The Great White Way . . . Broadway." 
</P>
<P>
The latter, said Alicia O'Connor, producing director of the theater and Donald 
O'Connor's daughter, received good reviews and was sold out every weekend 
during its three-month run. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, ticket sales alone could not offset the theater's increase in 
rent. And there were other reasons the theater closed, Alicia O'Connor said. 
She became more interested in producing films and in acting, and her father 
decided a larger theater would better suit his needs. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell says the rent he pays on his monthly lease is "pretty high." But he 
said all theater spaces are expensive these days. 
</P>
<P>
He expects to keep his theater alive through a plan that clearly exhibits his 
business acumen. 
</P>
<P>
Each member of the Company of Characters is charged $125 a month -- which is 
not unusual for participation in a theater group. But what sets Mitchell's 
company apart from some others is that in exchange for their dues, members are 
offered a variety of classes and workshops. 
</P>
<P>
Included are scene study classes twice a week, a commercial workshop once a 
week and showcases twice a month for producers and casting directors, to help 
them shop for talent. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights, the theater will feature a production on 
its main stage. Each member of the company is guaranteed the opportunity to 
appear in one major production a year, although not necessarily in a major 
role. In addition, beginning this summer, a series of one-act plays will be 
presented on Thursday nights. 
</P>
<P>
Diana Carpenter, a Marina del Rey resident who has been acting for seven years, 
said one reason she joined the company was because of the classes and 
workshops. "To me it seems like a reasonable price," she said. "It's a unique 
program. . . . It's a very aggressive plan." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell expects that next year the company will start presenting four 
main-stage productions. This year's three shows tentatively include a comedy 
set for this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said his philosophy in choosing shows is to pick plays that are 
uplifting, both spiritually and emotionally, "although this doesn't apply to 
the first show we are doing." 
</P>
<P>
"We want to do good theater. I want the audience and actors to find love in the 
work. With all the hate in the world, we want to do our part in showing there 
is a lot of love." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said the company will probably focus on doing established works since 
he is particularly interested in well-written plays. Often, he said, original 
material by unknown writers does not fill the bill. However, he added, "We're 
not closing our eyes to original stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Another objective is to present plays that have roles for women. That's one of 
the reasons he chose "In the Boom Boom Room." Of the 50 members in the company, 
about half of them are women. 
</P>
<P>
Company members, whose acting experience varies, range in age from 18 to 60. 
Many of the performers are in their 40s and 50s, he said, so they can play 
roles close to their actual ages. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the members hold other jobs while waiting for a break in show business. 
"We even have two accountants and an attorney," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone wants to act. The Company of Characters includes about half a 
dozen people interested in producing, eight to 10 directors, and several 
writers and choreographers. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell started the theater group, he said, after he got tired of hearing 
friends say, "Let's get a show up." So he took the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
All the company's members are his friends or acquaintances. 
</P>
<P>
"I called them up and asked them if they'd be interested in joining the group," 
he said. "I respected them, and they respected me." 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Leonardi, an actor who lives in Reseda, said the main reason for 
joining the group "is Herb Mitchell. . . . He's a great acting coach. He lets 
actors find their way." 
</P>
<P>
As president of the company, Mitchell decided to direct its first show. It will 
be his second directing endeavor. "I'm a dictator," he said with a laugh. "I'm 
controlling the company's destiny from the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell views his roles as director and teacher as secondary to his role as 
actor. When the Company of Characters produces "Fiddler on the Roof," Mitchell 
will play Tevye, the part that got him started in acting in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell was working as a stockbroker in Maine, with a wife and four children 
to support. He didn't take acting seriously, he said, because of his family 
obligations. But after working in a community theater, he became aware of his 
creative instincts. 
</P>
<P>
"All I was dealing with was one plus one equals two," he said. "Now, I could 
take someone from tears to laughter. I thought to myself, 'What a wonderful 
feeling to do this!' " Mitchell's performance earned him a very favorable 
review from playwright Samuel Taylor, who happened to be vacationing in Maine. 
</P>
<P>
Several years later, when his children were grown, Mitchell went into business 
with his brother. In Maine, they opened up a jazz club and bar called Geddy's. 
Since it was a seasonal business, Mitchell was free for about six months of the 
year, and he found his way to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
He arrived on a Friday night, auditioned, and by Monday morning had landed a 
part in an Old Globe Theater production of George Bernard Shaw's "Arms and the 
Man." Mitchell subsequently was cast as Captain Allard in "Short Eyes" at San 
Diego's Puppet Theater. Soon after, he decided to make acting his career. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell has appeared in more than 100 television commercials, most recently 
for Kellogg's Common Sense Oat Bran Cereal. He has also appeared on a variety 
of television shows, including "Cheers" and "Mike Hammer." And he has just 
signed a contract to be the spokesman in Dean Witter ads. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said he was interested in reviving "Fiddler on the Roof" because "It's 
universal. It's not just a Jewish play," he said. "Every man has his own 
struggle of bringing up a family." 
</P>
<P>
The Company of Characters will perform in Leningrad as a result of Mitchell's 
longtime friendship with Bill Raiten, who directed Mitchell in his stage debut. 
</P>
<P>
Raiten, who will direct "Fiddler" for the Company of Characters, has been 
involved in a cultural exchange program with the Soviets since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"The object is to not only exchange culture," he explained, "but also to get to 
know and better understand the people" of the Soviet Union. Raiten has arranged 
for the Company of Characters to perform at the Komedy Theater from Nov. 29 to 
Dec. 3. The Company of Characters will be the first American company to perform 
"Fiddler on the Roof" in the Soviet Union, Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
Making arrangements to go to the Soviet Union while operating a new theater 
company is a challenge. Mitchell's wife, Janet, is especially helpful, he said. 
She is the theater's administrative assistant. Mitchell said he receives little 
compensation from the theater, except for a portion of the proceeds from the 
commercial workshop he teaches, and says his efforts are not solely 
self-centered. 
</P>
<P>
"But life has never been better to me. I'm a working actor. I've got a great 
family. And now I've got my own theater company," he said. "I'm exhausted. I'm 
overwhelmed. I'm tired, but it's a good tired." 
</P>
<P>
The Company of Characters is located at 12655 Ventura Blvd. in Studio City. "In 
the Boom Boom Room" opens at 8 tonight. The production continues Fridays 
through Sundays until July 1. Tickets are $12 Fridays and Saturdays, $10 on 
Sundays, when curtain time is 7:30 p.m. For more information, call (818) 
508-4538 or (213) 466-1767.

MARCELA'S IN VAN NUYS COOKS TO THE BEAT OF THE TANGO;

<P>
It was a Tuesday night at Marcela's, an Argentine Italian Continental 
restaurant in Van Nuys, and things were awfully quiet. The tables were all 
dressed up in peach and gray linens, with accordioned napkins and fresh 
flowers. The wooden dance floor was gleaming. 
</P>
<P>
I was there with a friend and his 15-year-old son. There was also a table of 
three women and one man -- their tango instructor, who periodically escorted 
one of them to the dance floor. Two other men sat at a table, far from us. 
</P>
<P>
The dining room looked as if it went on forever through white arches, but this 
was an illusion. The people looking back at us in the next rooms all turned out 
to be us -- as reflected in many large mirrors. We were it. A busboy brought us 
some bread, hard little rounds cut from a baguette -- we didn't know if they 
were toasted or dried out. The owner came over to take our order. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, he told us, there's a professional waiter, but not tonight. We fought 
flagging spirits, felt just a little out of sorts, not really sad, not really 
lonely, but in touch with the peculiar out-of-the-way feeling that comes in a 
restaurant that's been gussied up for a crowd that never arrives. 
</P>
<P>
That night, the three of us had a good but not extraordinary dinner at a 
reasonable price. We loved the hot, juicy chicken empanadas and agreed that my 
skirt steak was the best entree. And the crepes, filled with dulce de leche, a 
caramelized condensed milk-like substance, were wonderful. The cannelloni, the 
scampi, the soups and salads were not remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
"Come see us on a Friday or a Saturday night," said the owner, almost 
apologetically. "We have the tango then. You should see it. People here in this 
country are more serious about the tango than anybody I've ever met." 
</P>
<P>
After 10 p.m. on a Saturday I returned to Marcela's with my friend Kate. A 
major transformation had taken place within those white and mirrored walls. The 
crowd had arrived. A very lively crowd. There was also a three-piece band, 
"Tango Tres" and a cover charge ($5) for the entertainment. I will say right 
now: That was one of the best $5 I have ever spent. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, I understood the reason behind all those mirrors: You could see what 
was happening on the dance floor from several angles. And what was going on was 
some of the most adept, alluring, fascinating tangoing I've ever seen. Couples 
of all ages were out there, legs closely spaced, dragging their feet, traveling 
in broad, fast parallel strides across the floor, kicking, feinting, dragging 
heels slowly up calves, looking this way and that. We watched in amazement. 
"Gosh," I said to Kate, "it's so controlled, and brazen, and complicated and 
wanton." 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," she said, "and so technical, and brave, and amazing and sexy." 
</P>
<P>
All told, we couldn't see enough of it, or come up with enough adjectives to 
describe it. 
</P>
<P>
When the dancers rested, the band and the singer kept us equally well 
entertained. All four men wore suits and ties. The bass player, a young man 
with a ponytail, played the stand-up bass sitting down. And the bandonion 
player looked like a man who had had his heart irremediably broken and who was 
now condemned to play this most heart-wrenching of instruments for the rest of 
his life. 
</P>
<P>
The singer, a well-coiffed, silken-voiced gentleman, sang intense, dramatic 
songs in Spanish, songs that had some members of the audience groaning in 
anguish and recognition. "Oh!" cried a woman near us. She beat her brow and 
clutched at her head. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kate and I had dinner. We started with chicken empanadas because I 
couldn't resist ordering them again. Kate had a grilled trout that was stuffed 
with celery and tomatoes. Juicy, delicate, perfectly cooked, it was one of the 
best trouts I've ever had in a restaurant. My very garlicky garlic-marinated 
chicken, however, was just OK. The accompanying vegetables were also heavily 
doused in garlic -- too heavily for my taste. We ate at a leisurely pace. In 
spite of all that was going on -- the dancing, the singing, the busy, social 
crowd -- the service was attentive and prompt. 
</P>
<P>
In a word, we were transported. We were as far away from our daily lives and 
concerns, as distant from Van Nuys Boulevard as we might have been in a Buenos 
Aires nightclub. Hours passed. We kept saying we would leave after the next 
dance, after the next song. We ordered cappuccino. 
</P>
<P>
A South American actress who had been the liveliest, the most notable tango 
dancer, came up on the small stage and sang with the band. She sang jazz songs 
in Spanish and English with such verve that Kate and I looked at each other and 
agreed: one more song, and maybe one more after that. And then we went ahead 
and ordered those good crepes. 
</P>
<P>
They came out perfectly. The filling was soft and warm, the top coated with the 
lightest, crispest film of caramelized sugar. One more tango. One more bite of 
the little pancakes. The truth was, we were too happy to move. 
</P>

DOING 'AS YOU LIKE IT' JUST THE WAY HE WANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Eric Bryce Wallach, a senior at Chatsworth High School, has learned a lot about 
theater in the last month while producing and directing "The Curate Shakespeare 
as You Like It." 
</P>
<P>
Because the school has no official ties to the production -- which opened on 
its outdoor stage Thursday and plays today, Saturday and Sunday at 5 p.m. -- he 
had to raise the funds, choose the cast, write the press releases, negotiate 
with school officials and make arrangements for ticket money to go to charity, 
all while trying to find time to oversee rehearsals. 
</P>
<P>
"I never, never knew how hard all this would be," Wallach said earlier this 
week as he squeezed in a quick telephone conversation between rehearsals. He 
sounded frantic but elated. "I ditched a lot of classes the last couple weeks. 
It's been hard, but great." 
</P>
<P>
Wallach, 18, who has acted in several school productions but never before 
directed or produced, was chosen by his classmates in the senior play 
production class to do the play. The class annually puts on a stage production 
at the end of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
The play, written by Don Nigro, is a contemporary interpretation of the 
Shakespeare classic. Unlike the original, it's anything but a comedy. "The 
Curate Shakespeare" is about a bedraggled acting company that exists in a sort 
of limbo state, and each member of the small cast has to struggle to come to 
terms with his or her role. 
</P>
<P>
"What began as torture and humiliation evolves gradually into a kind of 
triumph," Wallach wrote in his press release. It's a message of hope that led 
him to decide that 75% of the proceeds realized from the play should go to AIDS 
Project Los Angeles. "I was sick of having productions being done and the money 
going nowhere meaningful," he said. "I wanted it to go where it would really do 
something." 
</P>
<P>
Admission to the play is on a "pay-what-you-can" basis, although the class is 
suggesting a $5 donation. 
</P>
<P>
The 25% that doesn't go to APLA will be used to pay back investors in the show. 
Wallach said the show will cost about $500 to produce -- most of it for sets, 
costumes and programs; most of it from family, friends and local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
After graduation, Wallach will head for London, to take an acting workshop at 
the Shakespeare Globe Center. 
</P>
<P>
"I love acting; I love directing; I want to do them both," Wallach said. And he 
has learned one lesson above all from doing "The Curate Shakespeare." 
</P>
<P>
"I learned that I never, never want to produce again."

INNOVATIVE GLASSES GO WINDSURFING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERRY ANGEL, Sherry Angel is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Arthur Charap is a little embarrassed to admit that, until recently, he 
rarely wore protective eye gear while windsurfing. He didn't want to worry 
about losing expensive sunglasses in the water -- or having them shatter on his 
face. 
</P>
<P>
But Charap never felt comfortable leaving his shades on shore. He's an Anaheim 
Hills ophthalmologist, and he's seen the injuries that can result from engaging 
in water sports without protecting your eyes from ultraviolet light or sudden 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
Now he wears the kind of protection he recommends for his patients, because 
after years of searching, he's finally found sunglasses that provide safety 
without cramping his style. 
</P>
<P>
They're called Spex, and if you take a spill in these sunglasses, you can 
retrieve them easily because the frames float, and they come in trendy neon 
colors visible from quite a distance. 
</P>
<P>
They're made of a soft, pliable material designed to bend on impact. 
</P>
<P>
They were invented by a windsurfer who, like Charap, was unable to find the 
right kind of protective eye gear for water sports. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't buy one, so I went out and made one," says 33-year-old Casey 
Patelski, who is senior vice president of Costa Mesa-based Sport Eyes 
Enterprises -- the company created to market his invention. 
</P>
<P>
Patelski made nine different prototypes before he finally found the right 
formula for a frame that would float, using a material that he created with 
help from a chemist and patented under the name Floatron. 
</P>
<P>
His prototypes also reflected his efforts to structure Spex -- a cross between 
sunglasses and goggles -- so their shatter-proof lenses wouldn't fog or collect 
water and so wearers would have peripheral vision. 
</P>
<P>
Spex -- now being sold for about $65 throughout the United States and in more 
than 60 other countries -- come with an amber lens that provides 100% 
ultraviolet light protection and can easily be interchanged with clear or gray 
lenses, available for about $10 for each pair of lenses. 
</P>
<P>
Although they were designed for windsurfers, Patelski says they're being used 
in a variety of water sports -- jet skiing, surfing, sailing, water skiing. 
He's even seem them used for protection from impact in racquetball and karate 
matches. 
</P>
<P>
Once he had a prototype, it didn't take Patelski long to get his product into 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
One of his high school surfing buddies, Steve Teregis, 33, liked it so much 
that he showed it to Shawn Troup, a friend who had been a professional 
windsurfer but had never worn eye protection. Troup, 28, was equally impressed 
and took a prototype with him to a popular windsurfing spot in the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
He was the only one in the water wearing sunglasses, he recalls. "I felt funny, 
so I took them off. But it was so bright that I put them on again. Then I took 
them off and threw them. I could see them floating 200 yards away." 
</P>
<P>
Soon he had some of the world's top windsurfers asking to try them out. The 
demand has been growing ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Sport Eyes Enterprises was incorporated in April, 1989, with Teregis as 
president, Patelski as senior vice president in charge of research and 
development and Troup as vice president of sales and marketing. Jim Nanko, a 
29-year-old Newport Beach attorney who loves to surf and sail, is the fourth 
co-owner and handles the firm's financial and legal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Teregis says they sold about 5,000 Spex in last month. At the end of last year, 
they were selling about 1,750 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Spex are sold locally by Nordstrom, Bruce Jones Surfboards Inc. in Sunset Beach 
and Newport Ski Co. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Owen, manager of Newport Ski Co. and a windsurfer who wears Spex, says he 
hasn't seen any other product on the market that offers the same protection for 
high-speed water sports. 
</P>
<P>
"They do float," he says. "And you can step on them and turn them inside out 
and they don't break. They can take a lot of abuse. In windsurfing, your 
equipment has to hold up or it's no fun." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Nolan, product manager for Denver-based Bolle America and a windsurfer, 
says it's been frustrating to work for a sunglass manufacturer that doesn't 
provide protective eye gear for his sport. But that will soon change. He says 
Bolle America is developing a pair of sunglasses for windsurfers with a 
lightweight frame that will float. They're expected to be on the market by 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
Oakley Inc. in Irvine also is developing special goggles for windsurfing and 
other water sports that will be designed to float, Advertising Director Kris 
Anderson says. 
</P>
<P>
Patelski, who is now working on prescription lenses for Spex, says he sees the 
competition as a compliment rather than a threat. 
</P>
<P>
The trend thrills Charap, who is an assistant clinical professor of 
ophthalmology at UC Irvine. He feels protective eye wear for water sports is 
long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
He hopes products such as Spex will become as fashionable as regular 
sunglasses, which, he says, "are not made to take any of the punishment these 
sports deliver. 
</P>
<P>
"Spex aren't a crash helmet," he says, "but they will give you 95% protection 
against most things that can happen to you in the water."

New single-family home permit activity during the first two months of the year 
fell off slightly from 1989's level, making 1990's total the lowest for any of 
the last five years. The January-February total was 3% fewer than last year, 
but fell much lower than the preceding three years. In fact, the two-month 
total for such permits has declined steadily since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Although permit activity this year began on a fairly brisk note, February's 
total of 352 was the lowest single monthly number since the 322 issued last 
September. That also makes this the lowest February in five years. 
</P>
<P>
Pulling the two-month total lower this year as opposed to 1989 were major 
decreases in Mission Viejo and the city of Orange. The largest increase came in 
Yorba Linda. There are eight cities that, through the first two months of the 
year, had let no permits for single-family homes this year.

FIVE-COUNTY COMPARISON 
</P>
<P>
Not only Orange County incurred a decline in single-family home permits during 
the first two months of the year. All four of the surrounding counties had 
lower numbers as well, led by the 35% drop in Los Angeles. The statewide total 
was also off the 1989 pace. And the five-county total dropped from 49% of 
January-February statewide action to 46% this year.

BENEFITS, TRIALS OF BECOMING YOUR OWN LAWYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI DUCKETT, Jodi Duckett is a writer with the Allentown Morning Call. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He strode toward the witness confidently, his cordovan loafers shining and his 
graying hair neatly slicked back. 
</P>
<P>
Carrying a yellow legal pad filled with detailed notes, the man confronted the 
witness, asking carefully worded questions. The man was well-prepared. He had 
to be. His freedom was at stake. 
</P>
<P>
The man was 61-year-old Richard Hughes and the scene was the Pennsylvania 
courtroom of Lehigh Judge Maxwell Davison. Hughes was on trial for theft, a 
serious crime that carries a possible sentence of five years in jail. Yet 
Hughes had no lawyer. He was representing himself, depending on his own 
knowledge and finesse to save his good name, and his liberty. 
</P>
<P>
"I rest my case," he told Davison optimistically when he had finished asking 
the questions he felt would prove he did not illegally withhold a commission 
from a salesman who worked for his real estate company. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes won his case, something the Allentown, Pa., man had done many times 
before. Though this was the first time he had faced a possible jail sentence, 
Hughes was no more intimidated by the prosecutor from the district attorney's 
office than he has been by the private attorneys he faced in civil matters or 
the judges who have controlled his fate. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people, when you say court, they immediately have fear," Hughes said 
outside the courtroom. "A lot of people see a judge like a god. Most people 
wouldn't even think of trying (to represent themselves), but a lot of people 
are being taken over the coals by lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
In an era where there is hardly a dearth of lawyers -- about 700,000, or one 
for every 250 U.S. residents -- thousands of people across the country are 
going pro se, the Latin term meaning for yourself used by those in the legal 
profession to refer to people who represent themselves. 
</P>
<P>
These are people who say they can't afford a lawyer, often people caught in the 
gap between those poor enough to receive legal assistance and those with enough 
money to pay fees that can reach several hundred dollars an hour. These are 
people who feel that lawyers will not give service worth their high fees. And 
these also are people who simply want to be in charge of their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
If there is any truth to the adage, "He who represents himself has a fool for a 
client," these people are ignoring it. And they are supported by organizations 
across the nation, many of which have produced "how-to" books and guides 
designed to help people wade through the bureaucracy that is the American legal 
system. 
</P>
<P>
"Law is not this mystical thing," said Leili Eghbal, publicity director for 
Nolo Press, a 20-year-old Berkeley-based publisher of self-help legal 
information. "Basically, people can do it themselves; we are making sure we can 
provide them with the most up-to-date information." 
</P>
<P>
There seems to be little connection between the apparent simplicity of the 
matter and whether or not a lawyer is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Many people find drawing up a will to be their first legal task and the first 
time they decide whether to hire a lawyer. Consumer groups say there is no 
reason why a person can't write his own will, especially with the help of books 
like Nolo's "Simple Will Book," which even contains legal forms. 
</P>
<P>
Many lawyers suggest that people work on their wills themselves, but then find 
a lawyer to look them over. Some lawyers will do a simple will for less than 
$100. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers often use the same philosophy when it comes to resolving domestic 
disputes such as divorce. A couple might want to try to work through some of 
the issues before getting a lawyer to seal the deal. No-fault divorce, however, 
has led many couples to do it themselves. In California, for example, 70% of 
divorces are handled pro se. 
</P>
<P>
Public-interest groups say more people would represent themselves if more 
attitudes changed. 
</P>
<P>
"Judges are incredibly hostile and impatient with pro se litigants. They don't 
cut any slack," said Debbie Chalfie, legislative director for HALT, a nonprofit 
public-interest group that seeks to make the legal system simpler, more 
accessible, more affordable and more equitable. 
</P>
<P>
Judges say pro se litigants put them in a jam. 
</P>
<P>
"Theoretically we are supposed to treat someone with a lawyer and without a 
lawyer the same," said Lehigh County (Pa.) Judge Robert Young. "My experience 
is we end up helping the person without the lawyers. The judge is biting his 
tongue time and time again because it isn't fair to the other side." 
</P>
<P>
Young said that he might extend a filing deadline or help a pro se litigant get 
something into evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you don't want a guy thrown out of court because they don't know 
procedure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Young said one reason to hire a lawyer is "not because the lawyer is so smart, 
but because the lawyer is supposed to be detached and logical." 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult for an emotionally involved person: 'That's my kid. That's my 
car.' It's difficult for them to know what's relevant and they end up telling 
you all kinds of stuff they shouldn't tell you because it hurts them. . . . The 
lawyers have learned what the judge needs to know to resolve that particular 
issue. They don't go off on these lifetime stories." 
</P>
<P>
HALT's Chalfie said: "The pro se litigant has to learn procedure and evidence 
and all forms of proceedings, and whether the form is double-spaced or 
single-spaced. There are a lot of pitfalls and barriers. Some of them are there 
for the parties' protection and the integrity of the court. Others are there 
just to place barriers, so you need to hire someone to maneuver their way 
around it." 
</P>
<P>
Pro se litigants across the country tell stories of court clerks who won't 
answer simple questions, of being denied access to legal records and legal 
forms. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that judges are malicious. They just don't know how to deal with 
people on their own," said George Milko, HALT education director. "When they 
are faced with pro se litigants, even the most well-meaning judges also stumble 
around." 
</P>
<P>
HALT, when it began 12 years ago, stood for Help Abolish Legal Tyranny. But the 
group, which keeps the HALT acronym, now refers to itself as an organization of 
Americans for legal reform. 
</P>
<P>
HALT is working to get states to expand the dollar limits for small-claims 
court, replace legalese with plain language, allow court personnel to help 
non-lawyers with simple legal matters and change restrictions on who may 
practice law. 
</P>
<P>
Both HALT and Nolo publish books and guides. Nolo has 60 titles, many of which 
contain legal forms. Some of the titles include "Plan Your Estate," "Fight Your 
Ticket" and "The Living Together Kit." 
</P>
<P>
The issue of who may practice law is one of the hottest on the legal front 
these days. 
</P>
<P>
Across the nation, paralegals are seeking the right to work without an 
attorney's supervision to help people resolve simple legal matters. The theory 
is that they can answer questions that would allow people to go into court 
without a lawyer, or that they can help do the paper work that often accounts 
for much of lawyers' fees. 
</P>
<P>
A Nolo study concluded that paralegals could save consumers billions annually. 
</P>
<P>
According to the study, it would cost $750 to get a divorce from a lawyer at a 
nationally advertised clinic, a figure considered low compared to most lawyers 
fees. On the other hand, a paralegal would charge about $125.

A BAD ATTITUDE CAN ZAP STAMINA, STUDY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERYL LIEFF BENDERLY, Beryl Lieff Benderly writes for American Health and 
Psychology Today Service. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the biggest problems of everyday life is keeping our energy level up. 
Sometimes our stamina just seems to sag, and what should be a routine task 
becomes a boring, almost unbearable job we just can't seem to get done. 
</P>
<P>
While physical problems can be involved, our psychological attitude more often 
decides whether stress is energy-inducing or energy-zapping. How we perceive 
events can be more important to our stamina level than the events themselves. A 
recent study by psychologist Martin Chen of the National Center for Health 
Services Research in Maryland concludes that the most powerful predictors of 
exhaustion are not physical but psychological factors. 
</P>
<P>
People who reported feeling depressed or anxious were seven times more likely 
to report being fatigued than those in the study who had no such problems. 
</P>
<P>
Other studies show that personality plays a big part in energy levels. People 
who view their lives with optimism, feel in control and see problems as 
challenges are more likely to tackle them with energy and enthusiasm. 
Understanding how moods fluctuate and how emotions affect energy levels can 
help you use your daily rhythms to achieve what you want. What's more, you can 
take steps to change your outlook. 
</P>
<P>
"Intelligent adults can usually modify moods to a more positive level," reports 
psychologist Robert E. Thayer of Cal State Long Beach, who believes that mood 
is a crucial correlate of energy level. Our "subjective sensations of energy, 
vigor or peppiness," he says, are but one aspect of the "broadly inclusive mood 
systems" that dominate consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
But why should an idea or attitude become a physical feeling? Because our 
energy level isn't an accident, Thayer argues. It's the brain's shorthand for a 
person's total well-being at any given moment. The "core-mood states give vital 
signals about one's readiness for action and need for rest," he notes. 
"Feelings of energy and tiredness are the subjective signal systems of these 
crucial conditions of life." 
</P>
<P>
Health psychologist Richard Dienstbier of the University of Nebraska believes 
that research has paid disproportionate attention to the negative aspects of 
stress. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Dienstbier says, we respond to stress with a good deal of subtlety. 
He distinguishes two major types of response: 
"sympathetic-nervous-systemadrenal-medullary arousal," which results in a 
raised adrenaline level, and "pituitaryadrenal-cortical arousal," which results 
in the release of cortisol. 
</P>
<P>
Useful energy, Dienstbier says, relates to adrenaline, which helps in 
generating glucose, "the fuel of the nervous system," and to noradrenaline, 
which helps produce muscular energy. Cortisol, on the other hand, relates to 
tension. 
</P>
<P>
But how does the brain determine which arousal complex to call into play? 
According to Dienstbier, through its appraisals of the situation. "Am I up 
against sure defeat or a test of my ingenuity and skill?" The issue, Dienstbier 
believes, comes down to whether a stressful situation represents a challenge 
you can meet or harm about to happen to you. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that some experiences and activities can toughen people, 
encouraging the energy-producing adrenaline response. And a toughened person 
has a more effective adrenaline response that peaks higher and lasts longer. 
Aerobic exercise and mental challenge build toughness, says Dienstbier, as does 
finding humor in everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
Positive thinking can cause a positive spiral of responses. Challenges 
successfully overcome lead to greater toughness, which in turn leads to further 
successes. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently "there has been almost no research on how people perceive their 
energy and how they experience it when it is high or low, let alone what they 
do to maintain it on good days or boost it when it flags," says Clive Wood, 
research fellow at Oxford University and director of the Oxford Energy Project. 
This new multiyear research effort aims to "look at the positive side of 
energy."

Q We have a new litter of kittens in our house, and soon these kittens will be 
crawling around and getting into everything. I have a large number of various 
house plants and was told that I should probably remove them until I find homes 
for the kittens. How can I find out which of my plants are dangerous for the 
kittens? 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. T. Goldman, La Habra 
</P>
<P>
A There are a great number of plants that can be toxic to your cats. The Cat 
Fancier's Assn. has a very nice pamphlet that lists the most common toxic 
household plants. You can get a copy by writing to the CFA, 1309 Allaire Ave., 
Ocean, N.J. 07712. Enclose a self-addressed, stamped envelope. 
</P>
<P>
Q We have a 7-year-old golden retriever/shepherd mix. Very shortly after she 
was spayed, about five years ago, she began urinating while lying down wherever 
she was. The problem continues as if she has no control, yet we have seen her 
urinate properly like other female dogs. Could something have gone wrong during 
her spay surgery or is this just laziness or something else? How can we correct 
it? 
</P>
<P>
L. Maloney, Laguna Niguel 
</P>
<P>
A Lack of control of urination may be the result of many different problems. 
Nerve injuries, muscle weakness, defects of the urethra and infections may lead 
to a lack of control. Injury during surgery to the bladder or its nerves is 
another possible cause. 
</P>
<P>
It would be helpful to have your dog get a complete examination, including a 
urinalysis and a lab profile of the blood. Estrogen and thyroid hormone levels 
may be measured to see if there is a marked deficiency. Radiographs will be 
necessary, including special studies such as a cytogram, which will demonstrate 
the size and shape of the bladder. 
</P>
<P>
An intravenous pylogram should be done to outline the ureters from the kidneys 
to the bladder, making sure that they enter the bladder and not the vagina, 
which would give the appearance of urine dribbling. The spinal column should 
also be viewed on X-rays to make sure there are no disk defects that may cause 
neurological weakness of the bladder. 
</P>
<P>
A complete neurological examination may be necessary to help determine if 
spinal cord or peripheral nerve disease is causing your pet's problems. 
</P>
<P>
Treatment will depend on the findings of the examination and tests. In some 
cases, surgery may be necessary to either repair a defective ureter or get a 
biopsy sample of the bladder wall. Medications may be able to eliminate or at 
least control the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Lack of urination control, or incontinence, can be difficult to diagnose and 
even more difficult to treat.

HOW PERSONALITY, SPORTS MATCH UP

<P>
Are certain personalities attracted to specific sports? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, says James Gavin, a professor of applied social science at Concordia 
University in Montreal. Our personalities affect our choice of sports, our 
willingness to participate in a sport and how we perform in the sport. Which 
may explain why you're gagging on your weekly regimen of running, aerobics or 
yoga. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certain emotional qualities reinforced by the choice of exercise, 
and within that exercise," Gavin says. "It's hard to get people to adhere to an 
activity that doesn't feel right to them." 
</P>
<P>
Define your measure of sociability, spontaneity, discipline, aggressiveness, 
competitiveness, mental and risk-taking abilities, and you'll have a better 
understanding of your sport of choice. 
</P>
<P>
Gavin, who has written "Body Moves: The Psychology of Exercise," says that any 
physical activity can be analyzed in three dimensions he refers to as the 
psychological, physical and body movement domains. Our psychological 
preferences are bolstered by our body type and preference for certain kinds of 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
On Gavin's scale, swimming ranks very high in requiring discipline, and low on 
spontaneity, sociability and mental focus. In other words, once you get 
yourself into the water, you can glide solo on autopilot. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, "Basketball demands you pay attention; you have to be riveted in 
the moment," Gavin points out. "The activity by definition draws certain things 
from you." 
</P>
<P>
Like swimming, running demands discipline, but it's also low on spontaneity, 
risk-taking and mental focus. 
</P>
<P>
Walking may be the ultimate sport for meeting physical fitness needs over a 
broad range of personalities. It can be played either way for spontaneity and 
sociability. It requires little in the way of competitiveness, mental focus, 
risk-taking or aggressiveness, and it offers plenty of opportunity for 
spontaneity and sociability; in other words, walking is tailor-made for the 
individual seeking exercise without commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Gavin's psychological parameters may give you some clues as to why you're not 
enjoying your fitness program, and what you can do about it. But while 
psychological and physical factors may determine what sport you'll enjoy most, 
there are other considerations. Time, convenience and cost also enter the 
picture, Gavin points out. 
</P>
<P>
Scientific research seems to show that a person will be motivated to exercise 
if he or she picks an activity that appeals to him. A study of Harvard 
graduates by a Dartmouth Medical School researcher indicated personality was an 
important factor in determining if an individual would stick with a fitness 
program. 
</P>
<P>
In the March, 1989, issue of Psychology Today, Gavin presented a chart showing 
how various sports and fitness activities rank according to seven parameters. 
Gavin refers to these parameters as Psychosocial Activity Dimensions. 
</P>
<P>
Gavin provided a work sheet that allowed us to rank ourselves from very high to 
very low in each dimension. Then we can compare our preferences to his 
evaluation of specific fitness activities. (In evaluating the activity, Gavin 
assumed the individual participates regularly in the sport or activity). 
</P>
<P>
The psychosocial activity dimensions include: 
</P>
<P>
* Sociability: Do you most enjoy being alone or having people around? 
</P>
<P>
* Spontaneity: Are you a quick decision-maker or do you prefer detailed 
planning? 
</P>
<P>
* Discipline: Do you prefer to stick it out once you start something? Or do you 
abandon activities that require continued effort? 
</P>
<P>
* Aggressiveness: Do you try to control events? 
</P>
<P>
* Competitiveness: Do you enjoy competitive situations or shy aware from them? 
</P>
<P>
* Mental focus: Are you able to concentrate on one thing when you want or have 
to? 
</P>
<P>
* Risk-taking: Do you enjoy taking risks or do you prefer tried-and-true 
approaches? 
</P>
<P>
Answering such questions gives us a clearer idea of how well our sport suits 
us, and why certain sports won't satisfy us. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem in determining an individual's sports personality is that 
people may play the same sport in different ways. An individual's behavior 
pattern in sports may be either participatory or competitive, according to Dick 
Lister, a clinical psychologist and sports psychologist in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"The participatory golfer may be on the course as much to enjoy its aesthetic 
qualities, the trees and the lakes, as he is to put the ball in the hole," 
Lister explains. "The competitive golfer may see the lake because his ball is 
in it." 
</P>
<P>
The participatory and competitive categories are roughly equivalent to the Type 
A and Type B behavior patterns with which we're familiar. In their book, "Type 
A Behavior and Your Heart," Drs. Meyer Friedman and Ray H. Rosenman define the 
Type A behavior pattern as an "action-emotion complex" in anyone "aggressively 
involved in a chronic, incessant struggle to achieve more and more in less and 
less time." 
</P>
<P>
There's also an environmental element to Type A behavior, the physicians say; 
an individual may behave in a hard-driving fashion only in certain situations, 
for example, at work, or on the racquetball court. 
</P>
<P>
An individual with a Type A personality who is trying to relieve some of the 
stress his behavior creates, may want to choose a sport that doesn't lend 
itself easily to competition, Gavin says. What the Type A character may need is 
a dose of playtime -- going out to walk streets he has never traveled before or 
maybe going fishing. 
</P>
<P>
"While (their favorite sport) may benefit them cardiovascularly, it may not be 
the best psychologically, because it reinforces qualities they already have an 
abundance of," Gavin says. "The Type A personality will go into a sport with 
real aggression. From health to performance to super performance in a very 
short time. If a Type A takes on a Type B activity, it quickly becomes a 
performance contest." 
</P>
<P>
But while the participatory athlete may be more relaxed than the competitive 
athlete, both may be benefiting from their approach to exercise. The 
competitive athlete doesn't have to consider taking the participatory approach 
unless he's doing damage to himself, Lister says. Competitive jocks are usually 
having a good time improving their performances. It's when the obsession with 
improvement actually leads to declining performance that things get weird. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers believe different personalities prefer different movements. 
</P>
<P>
"Type A movements are typically quick and linear, a sudden changeability as 
opposed to a flow," Gavin says. "The movement would be more in tune with 
racquet games or running than with yoga or t'ai chi. A Type A individual will 
gravitate toward those types of movements. There's a quantitative, performance 
emphasis." 
</P>
<P>
The Type B personality has a different attitude toward movement. "More likely 
you'd find them doing activities with more enjoyment to them, and with more 
movement flow," Gavin says. "Type B's may be runners, but they won't be likely 
to enter races with the same emphasis. (And) they might be more varied in the 
routes they take." 
</P>
<P>
While sports can be played in either a participatory or competitive fashion, 
some require more concentration than others even in the participatory mode. If 
you want to escape the pressures of your own personality, choose your sport 
wisely. After all, it's all in fun. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHAT'S YOUR SPORT PERSONALITY? 
</P>
<P>
Matching your personality with your sport of choice will increase the 
likelihood that you'll stick with it, says Dr. James Gavin, a professor of 
applied social science at Concordia University in Montreal and author of "Body 
Moves: The Psychology of Exercise." 
</P>
<P>
Bodybuilders are characterized by Gavin as people who are persistent despite 
the obstacles. They don't like to change plans and they try to control 
situations by being forceful. Downhill skiers, on the other hand, are very 
social people who love spur-of-the-moment decisions. Sticking with things is 
difficult for them but they love a challenge and taking risks. Where do you 
stand?

LIZ TAYLOR SUFFERS RELAPSE, WILL BE IN HOSPITAL SIX MORE WEEKS

Pneumonia-stricken actress Elizabeth Taylor has suffered complications in her 
fifth week of hospitalization, including new infections, and doctors now say 
she will be hospitalized six more weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The recovery of Miss Taylor, near death two weeks ago with a viral pneumonia, 
has been complicated by bacterial pneumonia and a yeast infection, her doctors 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
"Miss Taylor has a resolving, newly acquired bacterial pneumonia secondary to 
her hospital stay at St. John's Hospital and Health Center," the doctors said 
in Santa Monica through Taylor's publicist, Chen Sam. 
</P>
<P>
"It is improving significantly," the physicians said. 
</P>
<P>
"She has also developed a fungemia of Candida albicans (infection in the 
blood), more commonly referred to as yeast and will be hospitalized for 
approximately six more weeks for intravenous therapy," the doctors added 
without elaboration. 
</P>
<P>
Bacterial pneumonia is generally considered less serious than the viral 
pneumonia Taylor initially contracted because antibiotics are effective against 
bacteria but not viruses.

<P>
A Long Beach man was killed today when his car slammed into a bridge in Buena 
Park, police said. 
</P>
<P>
William J. Baxter, 21, was pronounced dead at the scene after the accident at 
1:16 a.m., Buena Park Officer Rich McMillen said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred on Valley View Street south of Artesia Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Baxter, the lone occupant of the vehicle, drifted across a lane and rammed into 
a concrete section of a bridge spanning a flood control channel of Coyote 
Creek, police said. 
</P>
<P>
After crashing into the bridge, the car slammed into a light pole, McMillen 
said, adding that Baxter died from massive head and internal injuries. 
</P>
<P>
An investigation revealed that the Long Beach man was driving at a minimum 
speed of 65 m.p.h., police said. 
</P>
<P>
McMillen said an autopsy would seek to determine whether Baxter was driving 
under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

A 43-year-old Acton man was arrested this morning following a two-hour standoff

deputies, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
John Patrick Sass was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder at 4 a.m. and 
was being held without bail, Deputy Bill Wehner said. 
</P>
<P>
Two hours earlier, deputies arrived at Sass' home in the 5800 block of Hubbard 
Road after receiving reports of gunfire. As deputies approached the house, Sass 
fired several shots at them, Wehner said. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies surrounded the house. After two hours of negotiating with Sass by 
telephone, the gunman surrendered, Wehner said. Deputies had not determined why 
Sass began firing his gun, he said.

WIDOW CHARGES 'FRAUD' IN GUCCI'S WILL

The widow of Italian fashion magnate Aldo Gucci is challenging a will that 
leaves all of his American property to the woman he lived with and to the 
daughter she bore him. 
</P>
<P>
Gucci, who died Jan. 19 in Rome at age 84, left an estate worth millions of 
dollars. But his will, filed for probate in Manhattan Surrogate Court, says 
only that the estate is worth more than $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Olwen Price, 82, Gucci's English-born wife who bore him three sons, filed a 
challenge to the will two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Gucci's will, executed in Palm Beach, Fla., leaves half of his U.S. estate "to 
my wife Bruna Palombo Gucci" and half to their daughter, Patricia Gucci Losio, 
25. 
</P>
<P>
There is no indication that Gucci and Palombo ever formally married, nor that 
he divorced Price, though they lived apart for many years. 
</P>
<P>
In their petition for probate of the will, Gucci's lawyers named Price as 
Gucci's wife, although the will names Palombo. 
</P>
<P>
The will also says Gucci "openly acknowledges Patricia Gucci Losio as his 
daughter." 
</P>
<P>
Price, who lives in Rome, and two of the sons, Paolo of West Sussex, England, 
and Roberto of Florence, say the will was "not freely or voluntarily made." 
</P>
<P>
They charge that it was "procured by fraud, duress and undue influence 
practiced upon the decedent by an individual purporting to be his wife, to wit, 
Bruna Palombo." 
</P>
<P>
Price's third son, Giorgio, of Rome, is not contesting the will. 
</P>
<P>
Price, who says she is entitled to the "widow's share" of the estate, says the 
10-page will filed here was revoked by a will handwritten by Gucci on Nov. 8 in 
Rome. She did not cite that will's provisions. 
</P>
<P>
Gucci pleaded guilty and was sentenced in 1986 to a year and a day in prison 
for evading $7.4 million in income taxes.

Gov. Gaston Caperton, whose messy divorce from his wife of 23 years made 
headlines last year, today announced his engagement to Wheeling Symphony 
conductor Rachael Worby. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a really special day for us," Caperton said at a news conference at 
Oglebay Park Amphitheater, where the orchestra appears during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement comes less than a year after the first-term Democratic 
governor and his wife, Dee, divorced and she sued him for fraud. 
</P>
<P>
After the divorce, Dee Caperton, a former House of Delegates member, ran for 
the Democratic nomination for state treasurer, saying she would be able to work 
cooperatively with her ex-husband. She was defeated in Tuesday's primary. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation that Caperton, 50, and Orby, 41, were romantically involved sprang 
up when they attended many public functions together, including a visit to the 
White House.

A mother and her boyfriend were arrested on charges of neglect today after a 
smoky house fire that killed four of the woman's children and critically 
injured two others, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
An investigator said the fire may have been caused by children playing with 
matches. 
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out before 10 p.m. Thursday, trapping six of seven siblings left 
alone in their two-story downtown home, said police spokesman Lt. Roosevelt 
Harrell. 
</P>
<P>
An 11-year-old girl was helped to safety from a second-story window by a 
neighbor, Harrell said. 
</P>
<P>
Four girls -- Lashandra Moore, 5; Alexis Moses, 6; Jocelyn Moses, 8, and Daphne 
Moses, 9 -- died. Two brothers, Antonio Moore, 3, and Justine Moses, 2, were 
hospitalized in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old mother of the victims, whose name was not made public, was 
arrested on suspicion of neglect of children leading to death, Harrell said. 
The woman's 43-year-old boyfriend also was arrested on suspicion of child 
neglect.

A Philippine Airlines jet carrying 119 people exploded and burned today as it 
prepared to take off, and officials said a bomb may have been planted on board. 
Seven people were killed and more than 80 hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors spoke of up to three blasts aboard the Boeing 737-300, and at least 
three large holes were torn in the roof. 
</P>
<P>
Flames quickly gutted the interior. 
</P>
<P>
The plane was being towed to the runway for a domestic flight when it was 
rocked by at least one explosion, which occurred before the jet's two engines 
were started, said Oscar Alejandro, director of the government's Air Transport 
Office. 
</P>
<P>
The cabin filled with smoke, but most passengers escaped by sliding down 
emergency chutes before flames engulfed the plane, he said. Passengers said 
some people panicked and trampled one another rushing for the exits. 
</P>
<P>
"There was an explosion in front of me and there was a very bad smell," said 
passenger Isidro Retaso, 33, of Iloilo. "So I immediately opened the emergency 
exit. I was the first one out of the plane. 
</P>
<P>
"They were still demonstrating the safety equipment when it occurred. There 
were three explosions, loud explosions, and the ceiling shuddered. On the 
second explosion, I immediately opened the emergency exit." 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of six adults and one child were found inside the burned-out cabin, 
said Ed Carrascoso, manager of Manila's domestic airport. He said they were 
either killed by the blast or died of smoke inhalation. All were passengers. 
</P>
<P>
At least 82 passengers were treated for injuries at the airport clinic, most 
for slight sprains and bruises, said airline employee Alfredo Estrella. 
Twenty-two passengers were hospitalized, one in serious condition, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The plane was bound for Iloilo, 290 miles to the south, with 113 passengers and 
six crew members aboard. It was not known how many foreigners were among the 
passengers, although authorities said a Japanese man was treated for burns. 
</P>
<P>
The injured included Aurelio Periquet Jr., a nationally prominent business 
leader and president of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce, and Rep. Albertito 
Lopez, a congressman from Iloilo. 
</P>
<P>
The plane's departure had been slightly delayed because of heavy air traffic 
over Manila, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Carrascoso said there had been no bomb threats. But Oscar Alejandro, director 
of the government's Air Transport Office, said: "We're looking into the 
possibility that a bomb was placed aboard."

American Savings Bank completed the liquidation of its $400-million junk-bond 
portfolio last month, a spokeswoman for the privately held thrift disclosed 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Dianne S. Nelson said the Irvine-based thrift has not determined 
the cost of the liquidation, but said a reported estimate of a loss of $125 
million was probably "too high." 
</P>
<P>
American, a 177-branch thrift that was acquired in late 1988 by Texas financier 
Robert Bass, bought the portfolio last spring and summer before Congress banned 
thrift ownership of junk bonds as part of the savings and loan bailout 
legislation. The portfolio had a peak value of $493 million, Nelson said, 
making American one of the largest holders of junk bonds among thrifts.

<P>
A second steep drop in vegetable costs helped push wholesale prices down 0.3% 
overall in April, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
It was the sharpest decline since August and the third consecutive moderate 
report after a severe cold snap sent prices spiraling 1.8% in January, a 
15-year record. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department's producer price index for finished goods, one stop short 
of retail, had fallen 0.2% in March and showed no change in February. The 
monthly numbers are all adjusted for seasonal variations. 
</P>
<P>
For the first four months of the year, wholesale inflation was running at a 
4.2% annual rate, down from 4.8% for all of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"The numbers are increasingly ratifying the fact that we've dodged the 
inflationary bullet, at least for a while," said Dirk Van Dongen, president of 
the National Assn. of Wholesaler-Distributors. "The bad news is that maybe the 
soft landing (economic slowdown) is a little softer than we would like." 
</P>
<P>
In April, food prices fell 0.6% after an identical 0.6% decline a month 
earlier. Prices rose for eggs, rice, pasta and pork. They fell for fruit, 
chicken, cooking oils and candy. 
</P>
<P>
Vegetable prices, which fell 25.5% in March after record increases the previous 
two months, fell another 31.1% last month. It was the biggest drop since the 
government began tracking those costs in 1967. Tomato prices fell 73.3%. 
</P>
<P>
"They are no longer boxing tomatoes in Florida because the boxes are worth more 
than the tomatoes. . . . Thus the winter freeze is nothing more . . . than a 
bad memory," said economist Donald Ratajczak of Georgia State University. 
</P>
<P>
Energy prices dropped 1.7% after declining the two previous months. Gasoline 
prices, with the start of the warm weather driving season, climbed 2.2%. 
However, fuel oil fell 1.9% while natural gas dropped 5.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, prices rose a modest 0.2% after 
rising a moderate 0.3% in March. Economists said this "core" number is often a 
better indicator of underlying inflationary pressures in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Automobile prices fell 0.9% in April. Clothing price inflation recovered from 
increases a month earlier. Women's, men's and boys' clothing costs were 
unchanged. Girls' and infants' clothing fell 0.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Prices rose for medicines, soap, floor coverings and toys. They fell for 
alcoholic beverages, jewelry and magazines. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the moderate report for April prices at the wholesale level, economists 
are still concerned that inflation may be accelerating this year.

LOWER AUTO SALES DRAG DOWN APRIL RETAIL FIGURES

Dragged down by lower auto sales, total U.S. retail sales fell 0.6% in April 
after dropping 0.2% in March, signaling an economic slowdown, the Commerce 
Department reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Retail sales fell to $148.6 billion in April from $149.5 billion in March, the 
department's Census Bureau said. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers were adjusted for seasonal factors but not for price changes. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding automobiles, U.S. retail sales were unchanged in April after falling 
0.2% in March and increasing 1.6% in February and 1.1% in January. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers were worse than markets had anticipated, indicating that consumers 
are skittish about spending their money. 
</P>
<P>
Most private economists had predicted flat retail sales in April, with the more 
optimistic expecting a 0.5% advance for the month. The numbers, however, have 
proved to be both volatile and somewhat unreliable, since the Census Bureau has 
frequently revised them later. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Census Bureau, auto sales fell 2.7% in April to $30.5 billion, 
after declining 0.2% in March and falling 1.7% in February. 
</P>
<P>
The bureau said that April total retail sales were 3.4% above April, 1989, 
which would make them lower after adjusting for inflation. Sales in the 
February through April period were 5.2% above the same period a year ago, 
virtually flat after adjusting for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Total U.S. retail sales were unchanged in February and increased 2.8% in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
In April, retail sales of durable goods -- big ticket items designed to last 
three years or more -- fell 1.6% from March. Non-durable goods sales were 
unchanged for the second consecutive month.

AETNA DEFIES GOVERNOR IN PENNSYLVANIA

Aetna Casualty and Surety Co. said today that it will stick with its decision 
to stop selling car insurance in Pennsylvania despite a written admonition from 
Gov. Robert P. Casey, who called the giant insurer "arrogant and callous." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Casey sent a strongly worded, three-paragraph letter to Aetna's 
president, David A. Kocher, criticizing the company's decision Wednesday to 
terminate business with its 200,000 Pennsylvania customers. 
</P>
<P>
Casey said the company's withdrawal violated Pennsylvania law and displayed "an 
arrogant and callous disregard for our state and your policyholders." 
</P>
<P>
"If you persist in your decision, I hereby put you on notice that Pennsylvania 
will use all remedies against your company which the law allows to protect the 
200,000 Aetna policyholders in our state and the broad public interest of all 
our citizens," Casey said in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
Aetna, a Sears, Roebuck and Co. unit and the state's fifth-largest insurer, 
said Pennsylvania's new car-insurance law would cause it to lose $20 million 
during the next year. 
</P>
<P>
The law enacted in February lowers all motorists' rates by 10% as of July 1 or 
by 22% if they give up their rights to sue in most cases. 
</P>
<P>
Aetna has also asked the courts to block the state Insurance Department from 
trying to foil its exodus from the car-insurance market. 
</P>
<P>
The Insurance Department filed a cease-and-desist order on Thursday against 
Aetna to force it to stop sending out renewal notices and to reinstate 
customers who are dropped. Aetna then asked the U.S. District Court in 
Philadelphia to issue a temporary restraining order to block the department's 
order. 
</P>
<P>
John C. Hawkins, an Aetna spokesman, said in a statement that the company's 
action was within its rights. 
</P>
<P>
"The company holds the position that its actions in Pennsylvania to withdraw 
from the personal auto insurance market and begin orderly non-renewal of its 
policyholders are legal," Hawkins said. "There is nothing in Pennsylvania law 
that prohibits us from taking this action."

"EVEN WHEN you win the rat race, you're still a rat," opined Joan Collins. Now 
Joan has left Simon &amp; Schuster after writing her first novel, "Prime Time," 
for them, and she turns up -- courtesy of her agent, Irving (Swifty) Lazar -- 
at Random House with a new contract for $4 million for two new works of 
fiction. 
</P>
<P>
And to think I had to hear about this elsewhere, call Swifty and dig it out of 
him! (I suppose he was saving it for one of the Mica and Ahmet Ertegun dinner 
parties.) 
</P>
<P>
When I commented, "How incredible!" Swifty was indignant: "Why? She's bloody 
good!" OK, hooray for Joan, who has proved that there is life after Warren 
Beatty, after Tony Newley, after Peter Holm, after "Land of the Pharaohs," 
after "Empire of the Ants" and after TV's "Dynasty." 
</P>

You are no rat to your fans, Joanie. You are a beautiful, let's say 
"Spectacular," kitty-kat.

TEXANS ARE going to lead the June 6, Eisenhower Centennial D-Day Salute in New 
York City, aboard the aircraft carrier "Intrepid." Zach Fisher, the skipper of 
the "Intrepid's Museum of Patriotism," has invited the PR king, Tex McCrary, to 
round up a herd of Texans to lead this event. It takes place just three days 
after President Bush's summit meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Tex has already invited the President to come to this party, along with the 
four other living U.S. ex-Presidents -- Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, Gerald R. 
Ford and Richard M. Nixon. Tex has reminded each of them that this will be an 
historic occasion, just right for a unique photograph of the five together. 
(And I might add, if all five don't accept, then the next time most of them 
meet will most likely, sadly, be at the funeral of one of them.)

NBC ROLLS WITH THE DICE MAN

NBC management did not seem too troubled Thursday by the controversy 
surrounding comedian Andrew Dice Clay's appearance as guest host of this week's 
"Saturday Night Live." In fact, it seemed as if the network welcomed the 
publicity. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's put it this way," said Rick Ludwin, NBC's senior vice president for 
specials and late night television, "things have gotten real interesting within 
the last few days. . . . My own fix on the situation is that there have been a 
lot of people who have accused 'Saturday Night Live' of becoming boring and 
predictable over the last few years. Well, something tells me that this 
Saturday is not going to be boring and predictable." 
</P>
<P>
The network has not yet decided if Saturday's show will be put on a 
seven-second taped delay because of Clay's material.

<P>
"We were in a mutual state of disbelief. They did not believe I was serious."

EASTWOOD TALKS HIS WAY INTO CHANGE OF PACE ROLE

<P>
The usually taciturn Clint Eastwood's acting career takes a new turn in "White 
Hunter, Black Heart," which received its world premiere in Cannes today. 
</P>
<P>
Eastwood sprang to fame as the near-silent hero of "spaghetti" westerns and 
pared his script down to little more than a husky "Make my day" as detective 
Dirty Harry. 
</P>
<P>
But he waxes positively wordy in his role as devil-may-care director John 
Wilson, a closely modeled portrait of the legendary John Huston. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't do this kind of film without being wordy," Eastwood said. 
"Certainly, it's different to anything else I've played before, though I've 
played a wide variety of roles in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Eastwood, who has been coming to Cannes for the last three years, acts and 
directs in this production. The film is based on a story by screenwriter Peter 
Viertel, who went to Africa with Huston in the 1950s to shoot the star-studded 
classic "The African Queen." 
</P>
<P>
But Viertel soon discovered Huston was obsessed with quite another kind of 
shooting -- of an African elephant -- a fixation which led Huston virtually to 
abandon his staff and come close to wrecking the entire project. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this film has a big message about responsibility," said Eastwood. "The 
character at the end becomes a tragic figure because he has allowed his 
obsession to kill someone he respected and has lost a bit of himself in the 
process." 
</P>
<P>
Eastwood depicts Wilson as "a violent man given to violent action" -- cruel to 
those he loves, sarcastic, unpredictable, but redeemed by his rejection of 
racism, defense of the underdog and determination to value art over box-office 
receipts. 
</P>
<P>
"To write a movie you must forget that anyone's ever going to see it," says the 
Wilson character when he is reproached for choosing an ending the public will 
not like. 
</P>
<P>
"White Hunter, Black Heart," is regarded as a strong entry among the 19 works 
competing for the palm at the 43rd Cannes film festival. The 60-year-old 
director's performance is also being tipped for a possible Best Actor award.

Former Boston Celtics Coach K. C. Jones has withdrawn from consideration for 
the Atlanta Hawks' coaching job, leaving New Jersey Nets Vice President Willis 
Reed as the likely favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Jones "called me late yesterday and said he wanted to withdraw his name from 
consideration," Atlanta General Manager Pete Babcock said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"No reason. That's all he told me. It was out of the blue." 
</P>
<P>
Jones, now an assistant coach with the Seattle SuperSonics, won two NBA titles 
with Boston before joining the staff of Seattle Coach Bernie Bickerstaff. He 
had been scheduled to interview with the Hawks today. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Fratello resigned last month as Atlanta coach. 
</P>
<P>
Reed, who interviewed Wednesday, was Fratello's top assistant with the Hawks in 
1985-86 and 1986-87, when they won 107 games. 
</P>
<P>
Among the others being considered are assistants Dave Wohl of Miami, Bob Weiss 
of Orlando and Paul Silas of the New York Knicks.

Chris Doleman has signed a contract that makes him the best-paid player in 
Minnesota Vikings' history and one of the NFL's best-paid defensive linemen, 
according to agents with knowledge of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The agents said Doleman's one-year contract is worth about $1.4 million, the 
Star Tribune reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The deal might be worth as much as $1.6 million including incentive clauses, 
the agents said. The agreement also includes money from an out-of-court 
settlement, the agents said. 
</P>
<P>
Doleman, an All-Pro defensive end, made $300,000 in base salary last season. 
</P>
<P>
If the estimates are correct, Doleman's contract would eclipse those of the 
highest-paid Vikings, quarterback Wade Wilson and running back Herschel Walker, 
both of whom will make more than $1 million for the 1990 season.

Mariano Duncan of the Cincinnati Reds was suspended for one game today by 
National League President Bill White for bumping umpire Mark Hirschbeck earlier 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
Duncan also was fined an undisclosed amount. The suspension was effective 
immediately, which meant Duncan would sit out tonight's home game against the 
Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
Duncan was suspended for running into Hirschbeck in the third inning at 
Pittsburgh last Wednesday night. Duncan threw his helmet and charged the 
third-base umpire after being thrown out trying to steal. 
</P>
<P>
Duncan had to be restrained by third base coach Sam Perlozzo, and was 
immediately ejected.

RUHLMANN AFTER ANOTHER BIG STAKES WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Ruhlmann is named for an interior designer in Germany who did exquisite work 
for the horse's owners, Mr. and Mrs. Jerry Moss, and he does exquisite work on 
the race track when he is at his best. 
</P>
<P>
"When he runs a big race," trainer Charles Whittingham said, "it is very, very 
big. When he puts in a bad one, it is bad." 
</P>
<P>
Coming off two huge stakes victories at Santa Anita, Ruhlmann is the 5-2 
favorite in the $1-million Pimlico Special Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In a 10-horse field where With Approval, the Canadian Triple Crown winner, is 
sixth choice at 10-1, Ruhlmann is eligible to be beaten. But that is never 
really easy. 
</P>
<P>
Calumet's Criminal Type (8-1 Saturday) ran Ruhlmann down in the 9-furlong San 
Antonio the last time he was beaten, but he had to shadow him through a 
half-mile in :45 2/5 and three-quarters in 1:09 4/5. 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham was asked which of the field he thought might "go with" Ruhlmann's 
speed. "If there is any (early speed)," the 77-year-old trainer said, "they 
won't go with him for very long." 
</P>
<P>
Ruhlmann, by Mr. Leader, was a relative bargain for the Mosses (he founded 
A&amp;M records and the A is for Alpert). Trainer Bobby Frankel picked him, 
sight unseen, out of the Keeneland yearling sale for $40,000 and he has won 
$1,564,353. But it wasn't simple. 
</P>
<P>
As a 3-year-old, Ruhlmann was scary, and Whittingham thinks he might have 
scared himself as well as his owners, trainer and the competition. 
</P>
<P>
Ruhlmann made everybody nervous when Frankel brought him to the 1988 Florida 
Derby. In his only race that year he had run away in the El Camino Real at Bay 
Meadows. Made the 9-5 favorite, he bled and ran eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Given the appropriate medication, Ruhlmann went in the California Derby at 
Golden Gate in April. He was on the lead in the stretch when a horse clipped 
heels from behind. A third horse joined the collision and the winner, All Thee 
Power, was fatally injured when he went down after the wire. 
</P>
<P>
Ruhlmann's injuries weren't serious but the accident aggravated a bone chip in 
his knee. After arthroscopic surgery he came back to the track in August. On 
Oct. 2 he won the Jamaica Handicap in New York, where medication is not 
permitted. 
</P>
<P>
"He's still hyper sometimes," Whittingham said. "That was a bad crash he had, 
and horses don't forget things like that.

BCR A Blurr ForSure puts her undefeated record on the line Saturday night at 
Los Alamitos Race Course when the speedy quarter-horse filly faces nine of the 
nation's top sophomore sprinters in the $111,300 Los Alamitos Derby. 
</P>
<P>
The Grade I Los Alamitos Derby highlights a 12-race program with opening post 
set for 7:25 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
After stepping off the fastest qualifying time for the 37th running of the Los 
Alamitos Derby, BCR A Blurr ForSure is the strong favorite to walk off with the 
$58,000 winner's share. The Blane Schvaneveldt trainee came out on top of 21 
hopefuls who faced off in three quarter-mile trial divisions May 2. With Roman 
Figueroa in the saddle, BCR A Blurr ForSure drew off to a three-quarter-length 
victory in 21.73 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third consecutive win this year for the daughter of thoroughbred 
Murrtheblurr. 
</P>
<P>
Come Azure Are, a daughter of Azure Request trained by Bob Baffert, is the 
likely choice to pull off an upset. The Oklahoma-bred miss won her trial 
division with the second-fastest clocking of the 10 finalists. Kip Didericksen, 
Los Al's leading rider, loads into the No. 7 post aboard Come Azure Are. 
</P>
<P>
Dashin Dee Dee breaks next door in the eight hole under veteran reinsman Danny 
Cardoza. The chestnut filly will be seeking to avenge her loss as the 
even-money favorite in the West Texas Derby at Sunland Park this spring. She 
finished second in that stake after being bumped around considerably in the 
early going. 
</P>
<P>
Merriette deserves mention after winning four of her five starts this year for 
trainer Bob Baffert, including the Redwood City and Debutante Handicaps at Bay 
Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
The field for the 440-yard Los Alamitos Derby (in post-position order with 
jockey assignments): Dadburn Swift, Steve Treasure; Middock, John Creager; 
Special Elan, Henry Garcia; Here Comes The Band, Ralph Seville; Newmont, Jesse 
Godinez; Come Azure Are, Kip Didericksen; Dashin Dee Dee, Danny Cardoza; 
Merriette, Bruce Pilkenton; and Hugo Streakin, James Lackey. Dadburn Swift and 
Middock race as an Ed and Collette Lisenby-owned entry.

GRIFFEY JR. A NATURAL AT BEING BASEBALL'S NEW STAR ATTRACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SUDYK, THE HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is not true that the skies parted and Ken Griffey Jr. floated down on a 
cloud, nor that a voice of a prophet came out of an Iowa cornfield and told of 
the coming of the perfect ballplayer, one who would dominate the national 
pastime during the last decade of the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
But such cosmic entrances might have been appropriate given the real-life 
achievements of Junior Griffey, 20, a center fielder with the Seattle Mariners, 
who began his second season as American League Player of the Month for April. 
</P>
<P>
Not even halfway into May, Junior, still the youngest player in the big 
leagues, is hitting .357 with five home runs and 20 runs batted in. Out of 
respect normally reserved for veteran sluggers, he has been intentionally 
walked twice this season with runners on first and third. 
</P>
<P>
Already, he is the cornerstone of the franchise and darling of Seattle. 
Twenty-thousand pens were given out on "Ken Griffey Pen Night," and they 
already are worth $20 each to collectors. Few would argue that he is baseball's 
most salable commodity of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
Junior is built like Darryl Strawberry, plays like Willie Mays, hustles like 
Pete Rose and is as dedicated to excelling as Carl Yastrzemski and his 
blistered and bleeding hands. Even now this Junior achiever is being measured 
for the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. Many suggest that he only has to put 
in 20 years and his inevitable statistics will make his election automatic. 
</P>
<P>
"Junior's the best prospect I've ever seen," Seattle Manager Jim Lefebvre said. 
"I've told our coaches, 'We're going to be able to go through our lives and say 
we were there at the start of Ken Griffey Jr.'s career, a once-in-a-lifetime 
kid to come along.' He is so far ahead of his talent, it's frightening. He's 
got God-given instincts." 
</P>
<P>
Mariner batting Coach Gene Clines said, "There isn't a pitch he can't hit. I've 
never seen him in a slump. He adjusts like a 10-year veteran. Without a doubt 
he's a God-given natural. The scary part is what he'll be accomplishing when 
he's 25 years old." 
</P>
<P>
It begins in the genes. His father, Ken Griffey, is winding down a fine career 
(.297 lifetime hitter) with the Cincinnati Reds, making the Griffeys the first 
father-son act performing in the majors at the same time in baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
Ken, who now refers to himself as "The Original Griffey," said, "Kenny is 
impressive in all the five important categories in the game (hitting for 
average, hitting with power, running, throwing, fielding). It just doesn't make 
sense for someone to have that much talent. Watching him play is almost 
frightening." 
</P>
<P>
There is a sixth category everyone is watching: Junior's ability to handle his 
onrushing celebrity that is growing into a monster with every breath. It began 
in the Class-A California League when the club held an unprecedented poster 
night for him and sold out the ballpark. When he would go to the plate, the 
public address announcer would ask, "What time is it?" The crowd would respond, 
"Griffey Time." 
</P>
<P>
In this first major league at-bat, he doubled. In his first at-bat in the 
Kingdome, he homered. In his first pinch-hitting appearance, he homered. By the 
end of his 1989 rookie season he had his own candy bar with his image on the 
wrapper (which is ironic because his only known flaw is being allergic to 
chocolate). 
</P>
<P>
Fans also could have their choice of five Griffey posters and two Griffey 
T-shirts. He more than doubled his $68,000 salary with royalties from his 
off-the-field ventures. He is on the cover of Sports Illustrated and has a book 
due out soon. 
</P>
<P>
His love for the game is all-consuming. He usually is at the ballpark as many 
as five hours before game time. He skitters about mischievously, teasing and 
trading insults with his older teammates and is a card-game kibitzer. He wears 
a fixed wide smile and Christmas morning excited eyes and swings a can't-wait 
bat at imaginary pitches. With his cap on backward, his pant legs reaching his 
ankles and his giddy air, he reminds one of some hotshot dude at the drive-in 
after a softball game. 
</P>
<P>
He was a leading Rookie of the Year candidate last season, batting .287 with 13 
homers and 45 RBIs, when he broke his hand in a fall in a Chicago hotel room in 
August. He missed four weeks. "When he returned he tried to make up the lost 
time and began swinging for the fences," Lefebvre said. Griffey finished with a 
.264 average, 16 homers and 61 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
He has a youngster's fascination for automobiles. He is driving his third BMW. 
The current one has $8,000 of stereo equipment that includes 14 speakers. And, 
of course, a cellular phone. 
</P>
<P>
Junior phones his dad, his mother, Bertie, and his brother, Craig, every day. A 
$600 monthly phone bill is routine. Craig is enrolled at Ohio State, where he 
is a defensive back. The family is very close. Ken visited Kenny three times 
when their schedules permitted last season. Last month, when both the Reds and 
Mariners were playing in New York, Ken saw Kenny rob Jesse Barfield of a home 
run with a spectacular catch. "I was stunned like everyone else in the stands," 
Ken said. 
</P>
<P>
Ken did not push his son into baseball. "He plays the game with such ease and 
has so much fun with it," Ken said. He believes that Kenny's lack of awe of the 
big leagues has helped his development. He grew up in the Reds' locker room in 
the 1970s when the Big Red Machine was winning two world championships. The 
sons of those players included Pete Rose Jr., Eduardo and Victor Perez, Lee May 
Jr. and Brian McRae. They were called the "Little Red Machine." By the time 
Kenny was 11, Ken could no longer strike him out. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews, his voice barely audible, Junior said, "Only thing dad ever told 
me was to go out and have fun. Whatever happens, happens. Stay out of trouble 
and be a good kid. . . . Playing in the big leagues while my father is still 
active is the biggest thrill of my life. I try to see him play whenever I can." 
</P>
<P>
Junior holds no awe of big league pitching. "I've been swinging the same way 
since I was born. It's always worked. Why change now?"

STAGE BEAT: MAMET'S 'SHAWL' FEELS LIKE AN EARLY WORK AT THE WATERFRONT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Mamet has, jokingly perhaps, referred to his 1985 play, "The Shawl," as 
"my 'Twilight Zone' episode." But except for a jarring moment during Tuesday's 
performance when the building of the Waterfront Stage shook with perfect 
dramatic timing from a small earthquake, the play never realizes its ambitions 
for eeriness. 
</P>
<P>
This is the Los Angeles premiere, but "The Shawl" is so slight that it feels 
and sounds like a very early Mamet work, earlier even than his other spooky 
piece, "The Water Engine." 
</P>
<P>
Like Miss A., a desperate woman who comes to John, a low-life psychic, for help 
with her dead mother's will, we must accept this seer for the man he is. 
Director Duane Whitaker severely undercuts this, though, with some faulty 
casting. Shelly Desai as John voraciously swallows precious lines where he 
should be pulling us into his orbit, so that the plot curves carry a curiously 
empty feeling. 
</P>
<P>
We also can't accept Strawn Bovee's skeptical-looking Miss A. stomaching John's 
visions of her mother very long (she even out-tricks him, then doesn't leave). 
There's no emotional union between Desai and Bovee, and no link of any sort 
between Desai and Robert Patrick as Charles, John's lucre-sniffing lover. 
Without these, the implication of danger in the play's mood -- not abetted by 
the severely reined-in dialogue -- floats like a cloud above these people 
without entering their lives. 
</P>

 At 250 Santa Monica Pier, on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, 8 p.m., until June 6.

'To Forgive, Divine' a Farce at Colony 
</P>
<P>
The Colony Studio Theatre is a place that knows what its audience wants: 
familiar, accessible plays with beginnings, middles and ends, and productions 
in which all the actors remember their lines. That is why it has as healthy a 
subscriber base as any smaller theater around. It is also why the subscribers 
loved Jack Neary's "To Forgive, Divine" at the performance seen. 
</P>
<P>
They took to Jonathan Palmer's Father Jerry Dolan, and how he gets the hots for 
a married woman (Cara Roe's Katie) whom he's admired from afar since they were 
in high school together. They were charmed by Kathryn Fuller's Milly, the 
crusty unofficial chief around this New England Catholic church. Isn't it cute 
how Milly has to corral in her teen helper, Margaret (Debra J. Rogers), then 
chide Jerry for dancing with Katie in the middle of the sacristy? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe, especially if you like the idea of a Pat O'Brien movie retooled for the 
'90s, but should a faithful audience be subjected to the bad farce Neary's play 
becomes? The lengths taken to create a high-tension situation involving Jerry, 
Katie and Katie's burly husband (David Drummond) and a large closet is simply a 
case of a playwright imposing his need for comedy on characters against their 
wills. For farce, that is fatal. 
</P>
<P>
But everyone, as always, remembers their lines; some, like Fuller, etch out 
some memorable moments. Susan Gratch's set is an authentic sacristy and Michael 
David Wadler's direction is professional. There's more to a show, though, than 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1944 Riverside Drive, on Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 7 
p.m., some Sunday matinees, until June 17. $15-$17; (213) 655-3011.

'Ruby Ruby Sam Sam' on the Cast's Menu 
</P>
<P>
Director Lee Garlington has become a specialist in plays about women who work 
in eateries. But where her 1987 production of "Waiting" was a sweet and 
scintillating comedy with refreshing views of how women deal with work in 
public, her current staging of Stan Edelman's "Ruby Ruby Sam Sam," at the Cast 
Theatre, is a contradictory muddle. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of it is Edelman's doing. Clearly, we're meant to wonder why Ruby (Catlin 
Adams), owner of a Southern diner, allows Sam (Van Quattro), a late-night 
customer, to hang around the estabishment after closing time. There's something 
about Sam, a struggling playwright, that attracts her, and something about the 
danger of the situation that contains an aphrodisiac quality. 
</P>
<P>
But Edelman never pins this something down, nor does he affix it to the 
character's needs. If "Ruby Ruby" was about the mystery of human contact -- 
which it isn't -- a certain vagueness would be apt. All we can do is wonder 
about Ruby's judgment, since Quattro plays Sam as a borderline nut case. Adams 
puts her heart into a role that's ultimately two irreconcilable women in one. 
She keeps a good diner though, judging by Andy Daley's detail-rich set. 
</P>
<P>
 At 800 N. El Centro Ave., Mondays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 7 p.m.,

'Rizzo,' Italian-American Comedy, at the Whitefire 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Rizzo is not asleep in Frank Adamo's Italian-American comedy at the 
Whitefire Theatre, "Waking Jimmy Rizzo." Jimmy kicked the bucket during 
intercourse with a woman other than his wife. Now, his pals down at the bar are 
figuring out how to send him off. His family is figuring out if Jimmy is worth 
the trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Adamo breaks up his play into scene pieces -- not always to the play's benefit, 
but an efficient way of getting to know the people in this 14-character work. 
</P>
<P>
Much time is spent on Edna, Jimmy's forlorn wife (the perfectly cast Rhoda 
Gemignani) convincing her bitter son Tom (Nick Vallelonga, who does an 
excellent slow boil) to go to the wake. This is balanced off with the comic 
spats, in the funeral parlor no less, of Laura and Bert (Carol Ann Susi and 
Adamo, who alternates with Anthony John Denison, are an Italian Nichols and May 
team). Other couples spat too, and we can see Jimmy in all these men, short on 
feelings and long on mouth. 
</P>
<P>
A final set-piece in the parlor, when everyone comes together in the play for 
the first time (including Mary Tower's funny Judy, the woman Jimmy slept and 
died with) goes on too long under Frank Megna's direction, and reminds you that 
too much of "Waking Jimmy Rizzo" is just another comedy about how rotten most 
men are, without having anything new to say on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 At 13500 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks, on Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., 
Sundays, 7 p.m., until May 27. $12-$15; (213) 466-1767.

GREAT 'TRAVELLING PLAYERS' MAKES IT TO L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They enter the city slowly: a quiet, sad, stately group of actors who, for 
years, have been roaming the countryside, performing Perisiadis' hackneyed but 
wildly popular folk tale "Golfo the Shepherdess." 
</P>
<P>
Their names and fates, now and past, bizarrely mirror the major figures in 
Aeschylus' "Oresteia": Agamemnon, Orestes, Elektra. They are "The Travelling 
Players" (at the Monica 4-Plex), central figures of a towering modern 
masterpiece by Greek filmmaker Theo Angelopoulos. 
</P>
<P>
As the players arrive it is 1952. Suddenly, as they walk with desultory 
slowness through the streets, we are back in 1939. Instead of campaign trucks 
for Marshal Papagos, a visit from Goebbels is being announced. For the next 
four hours, we will watch this troupe as they pass in and out of present and 
past, through the major upheavals of a violent era. 
</P>
<P>
We will watch them struggle, starve, betray and even kill each other; dance in 
the mountains; cavort beachside for British troops; mad with hunger, stalk a 
solitary chicken in the snow; sneak through streets aflame with rebellion and 
riot. We will see history as they do, from the edges and far away. 
</P>
<P>
"The Travelling Players" is one of the major neglected movie masterpieces of 
our times. First made in 1975 and a legendary work in Europe for years -- 
winner of 15 major festival awards and innumerable "best film" polls -- it is 
receiving its first Los Angeles commercial release beginning today, for one 
week only. 
</P>
<P>
Because the film is so extraordinary, and so easily misunderstood and 
undervalued, some misconceptions have to be attacked. "The Travelling Players" 
is not pretentious, opaque, self-indulgently static and slow -- though some 
will definitely see it that way. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the confusion involves Angelopoulos' unique style: the long-take, 
moving camera mise-en-scene, which he takes to such harrowingly beautiful 
extremes -- using only 80 shots in nearly four hours. This austerity will 
madden some audiences. 
</P>
<P>
But, watching "The Travelling Players," our emotional temperature changes, 
cools out. We are not jerked from point to point, hammeringly, insistently. We 
have to do our own editing, become more intellectually and emotionally alert. 
Each scene is a memorable, masterful set-piece. For those willing to do so -- 
and Angelopoulos' strongest partisans include brilliant colleagues like 
Bernardo Bertolucci and Akira Kurosawa -- the rewards of this movie are 
intense. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Travelling Players," the characters are less individuals than groups, 
less groups than figures of the Earth, lost in what surrounds them: the land, 
the sky and the sea. Angelopoulos -- and his virtuoso cinematographer Giorgio 
Arvanitis -- give us bewitchingly lovely landscapes, made increasingly 
significant because of the terrifying events enacted against them. National 
betrayals echo personal ones. The Metaxas dictatorship falls with its Hitlerite 
allies; the resistance fighters are duped into giving up their arms; the 
British assume greater control; the left splits; finally Papagos, a scant 
improvement, takes over. 
</P>
<P>
"The Travelling Players," melancholy, profound and humane, is a great 
anti-fascist epic. Incredibly, most it was shot in a country under the tyranny 
of a military junta. The ellipsis and indirection, even the parallels to 
Aeschylus, were all part of an elaborate strategy to dupe the censors and speak 
to the audience, right over their heads. The film, one of the biggest popular 
hits in Greek history, did just that -- though the "colonels" fell before its 
release. (Ironically, some "progressive" American critics have proven just as 
dense as the fascist censors.) 
</P>
<P>
I haven't mentioned actors -- which may seem a contradiction. All of them, Eva 
Kotamanidou, Aliki Georgouli, Stratos Pichis, and Yannis Firios -- the frail 
old accordionist who opens the show -- are perfect. Yet "The Travelling 
players" is far more an ensemble effort: a poetic vision of a world in all its 
facets, human and inanimate, living and dead. 
</P>
<P>
Poetry in the movies is always rare; Angelopoulos' is to be particularly 
cherished because it is wedded to such profound intelligence, such stunning 
sensitivity and courage. "The Travelling Players" (Times-rated Mature for 
nudity, sexual scenes and adult themes) has the kind of high artistic 
significance that "Intolerance," "The Rules of the Game," or "Greed" had in 
their day. A classic of our times, it is a work whose purpose, as Joseph Conrad 
and D. W. Griffith claimed for themselves, is to make you hear and feel: above 
all, to make you see.

THE RESTLESS J.J. CALE AND HIS 'TRAVEL-LOG' OF AN UNPLUGGED LIFE; 
</P>
<P>
CALE'S LATEST ALBUM IS AN ENLIVENED WORK; IT OVERFLOWS WITH IDEAS AND HINTS 
HE'S READY TO KICK THE BLOCKS FROM UNDER HIS MOBILE HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To anyone familiar with his music, it's tremendously apropos that J.J. Cale has 
spent the past decade living in a mobile home. While loose and laid-back, 
Cale's songs -- which include the Eric Clapton-covered "After Midnight" and 
"Cocaine" -- are anything but stationary. 
</P>
<P>
His current, groove-laden "Travel-Log" album is redolent of low-rent good 
times, barbecue smoke and corrugated metal, but there is also enough rhythmic 
snap and sizzle present that it's clear Cale could kick the blocks away from 
his tires and scream down the road any time he chose. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always enjoyed being a Gypsy," the soft-spoken Oklahoman said Wednesday 
from his new home near Escondido, where his 24-foot trailer remains parked out 
back. "I basically make my living writing songs, so I've been able to go around 
in my trailer. If I got tired of a place, I could move on and roam around. It's 
a nice environment for writing songs, as opposed to sitting at a recording 
studio console all day." 
</P>
<P>
A Tulsa native, Cale first came to Los Angeles in the early '60s in a musical 
migration that also included fellow Tulsans Leon Russell and Carl Radle. He got 
in the habit then of living in hotels wherever his club gigs took him. 
Following his introduction to fame with Clapton's 1970 hit with "After 
Midnight" and his own subsequent success with "Crazy Mama" in 1971, Cale 
relocated to Tennessee and adopted his trailer park lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
When he again moved West a decade ago, Cale settled in Orange County because "I 
didn't want to live up by the (Los Angeles) music industry. I was trying to cut 
down that jones. So I moved down around Anaheim. There's a lot of trailer camps 
around Disneyland, and I kind of liked it there. It was real straight, as 
opposed to the Hollywood environment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a quiet life and it had its advantages. There's no responsibility: You 
don't have anything to clean up, it's cheap, the bills are a cash deal. I'd 
bicycle most places, which I found could be faster than a car. I didn't own a 
phone. As far as business goes it was kind of slim because if you don't 
communicate you don't do too much business nowadays." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Cale's unplugged lifestyle and infrequent output -- "Travel-Log" is his 
first LP in six years -- has led to his being typified as a recluse in the 
press. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one of the reasons I've been doing quite a few interviews lately: If 
you don't say anything, they make up things. So suddenly I'm a recluse. But I'm 
a songwriter basically, not a performer, and selling songs is kind of an inside 
deal, so I didn't need to be hyped for that." 
</P>
<P>
Along with presently making himself more available to the press, Cale has 
expanded his typical annual six-week tour -- conducted by mobile home, 
naturally -- to a four-month outing. The greater activity is reflective of the 
album itself, as "Travel-Log" may be Cale's most enlivened work, and it simmers 
with more ideas and feeling than some of his more famous emulators have 
mustered in eons. 
</P>
<P>
It helps no small amount that Cale is surrounded by excellent and kindred 
musicians on the album, including pianist Spooner Oldham (a true legend in 
Southern soul music), bassist Tim Drummond (whose credits include James Brown, 
Ry Cooder and Bob Dylan), saxophonist Steve Douglas (the honk on Duane Eddy's 
hits) and percussionist Jimmy Karstein, who has worked with everyone from Gary 
Lewis to James Harman. Joined by singer-guitarist Christine Lakeland and 
drummer Jim Cruce, they also form the band that will perform with Cale at the 
Coach House on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
More than the linking geographical theme to some of the "Travel-Log" songs -- 
titles include "Shanghaied," "New Orleans" and "Tijuana" -- the tracks add up 
to a coherent whole, suggesting a musical journey. Surprisingly, the album's 14 
songs were recorded over a five-year period, employing a variety of studios and 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
"I really scattershot things," Cale said. "Sometimes I'd write the song first 
then hire the musicians or write the song into a tape recorder and have the 
band learn off that, record the rhythm track with a band and write the song 
from that, sometimes do it in a big studio with real fine gear, sometimes do it 
in my trailer with real funky, cheesy equipment." It's a matter each time, he 
said, of finding a special atmosphere, "trying to find something I can relate 
to myself." 
</P>
<P>
After a successful release in Europe last year, "Travel-Log" was issued 
domestically this year on Silvertone/RCA. Though Cale earns his bread chiefly 
as a songwriter, occasionally as a performer, the influences he cites are all 
guitarists: Chet Atkins, Les Paul, Scotty Moore and Clarence (Gatemouth) Brown 
among others. Cale usually submerges his guitar technique deep in the grooves 
of his songs, surfacing with short, brilliant solos. Clapton and Mark Knopfler 
both list Cale as a source for their styles. 
</P>
<P>
Both on record and live, what Cale tries to communicate through music is "the 
same feeling I get from playing it. Music is a kind of magical thing, and you 
can't make magic every time, but you try. Every once in a while it has that 
magic, and the audience knows that. I probably miss it more than I hit it, but 
I think that's what all musicians try for." 
</P>
<P>
Years ago Cale opined that, given the compromises of the music business, "the 
true art stays at home." He still feels that way. "It can be more artful there 
because you don't have to come up with formulas and business decisions, all the 
money things don't affect what you do. You just do it for art, for your own 
enjoyment or for friends, and there's no connections or financial rewards. With 
each generation it seems like music is more of a business. People look at the 
music business like doctors look at medicine." 
</P>
<P>
Not that Cale objects to the rewards. He generally is against classic songs 
being cheapened through use in commercials, but the appropriation of "After 
Midnight" by Michelob doesn't faze him: "Number one, because they pay me for 
it. I sold all my songs and have no control over them, but I do get paid when 
they use them. And -- modest fellow -- I didn't think 'After Midnight' was one 
of those kind of special tunes, so it didn't bother me." 
</P>
<P>
Cale's "Cocaine" offers an ambivalent view of that drug's lure, and was written 
at a time when it was far from being the societal problem it has since become. 
Though the song remains a party anthem for some, Cale said he can't have any 
regrets about penning it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't because I'm a writer. I'm a great believer in freedom of speech. The 
song is not for cocaine, and it's not against cocaine. It's something I 
observed and wrote a song about. That's what all writers do, in prose, poetry, 
whatever. I wasn't trying to turn anybody on to cocaine, or turn anybody off. 
When I wrote it I didn't realize that 10 years later it would be a big thing 
the government was going crazy over." 
</P>
<P>
He's glad that the fans he attracts know his material well enough to not be 
shouting for "Cocaine" or his other familiar songs during his shows. They can 
present other problems, though. "The songs people do request are the obscure 
ones off some old B-side that I probably can't remember." 
</P>
<P>
Cale recently purchased a genuine house without wheels on the rural outskirts 
of Escondido. He explained, "I thought I'd get me a little place and see what 
mowing the lawn was like." 
</P>
<P>
He's 51 now and never thinks of retiring because, he said, "I'm kind of retired 
now. You have to remember I didn't do anything for the last five years. I'd 
rent a recording studio for two days once or twice a year, then once a year 
ride around in a motor home for six weeks. So basically for 10 months of the 
year I've been retired. 
</P>
<P>
"It's generally really hard to pay your rent playing music. Most people have to 
quit after a couple of years. I've been real lucky to be able to do it for 30 
years. I didn't get rich. But I can pay my bills. I wouldn't want to have 
gotten any bigger than I did because when you're that famous people really get 
on your case. My days are all kind of like Saturday because I don't have a 
regular job to go to at 9 every day. I read a lot and have a lot of time on my 
hands." 
</P>
<P>
Cale recently learned that fans in England publish a newsletter dedicated to 
his doings called "Troubadour" (the title of an album he released in 1976). 
"Finding out about that was a real surprise," he said with a chuckle, "I have 
no idea what they manage to fill it with."
