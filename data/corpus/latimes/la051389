<P>
Sex on television can provide the "opportunity for dialogue" on a subject that 
most parents find uncomfortable initiating with their children, suggests Sister 
Elizabeth Thoman, Media &amp; Values editor. 
</P>
<P>
While recognizing that tasteless or demeaning use of sexual images may call for 
objections to networks and advertisers and monitoring of TV viewing in the 
home, Thoman's quarterly magazine, published in Los Angeles with both religious 
and secular financing, recommended in its spring issue on sex what it called a 
"creative and positive response." 
</P>
<P>
What is sexy and suggestive to an adult is not necessarily so to youngsters, 
Thoman said. "Adults come to the viewing experience with more life experience 
and thus can 'read' more into media plots and scenarios than children can," she 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine's pragmatic approach comes at a time when debate has increased on 
whether a new skittishness about offending viewers evident at TV networks has 
arisen from efforts of religious boycotts, the wariness of cautious advertisers 
or a pullback from excess by TV executives. 
</P>
<P>
Thoman discounted the impact of boycotts by "thousands" when viewers are 
counted in the millions. She also wrote in the magazine that it is 
"unrealistic" for parents to severely restrict television time for children. 
</P>
<P>
Suggestions on "teachable moments," written for possible use by church and 
synagogue groups, were included in the magazine, published by the Media Action 
Research Center. "In the end, what the media communicate to our kids about sex 
is less influential than what we communicate to them," Thoman said, citing 
studies summarized in the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
MOTHER-SON 
</P>
<P>
A mother and son in Boston who are both Episcopal priests were described as 
possibly the first such combination in that denomination by a Religious News 
Service story last Saturday. However, according to the Center for Christian 
Spirituality-West, that distinction was reached in Los Angeles at least 10 
years ago with the ordination of the Rev. Emily Stevens Hall. Daughter of a 
former Los Angeles Episcopal bishop, she was ordained Jan. 20, 1979, by the 
late Bishop Robert C. Rusack. Her son, Mark Hall, was ordained three years 
earlier by the Diocese of Maine and currently serves the Diocese of San 
Joaquin. Emily Hall, now living in Santa Paula, is president of the center's 
board.

The First Baptist Church of Los Angeles will add a second full-time clergywoman 
to its five-person ministerial staff on June 1 -- Mary Jane (Janey) Smith, a 
widowed former missionary to Zaire and a Fuller Theological Seminary graduate. 
Admitting that the 760-member congregation was "making an important symbolic 
statement to our denomination," Senior Pastor John H. Townsend said only a few 
women clergy serve American Baptist Churches in Southwestern states. The 
churches "have been slow to recognize the gifts of women whom God has called 
into the ministry," he said. Already on staff is the Rev. Ruth S. Morales, who 
is preaching Sunday, which happens to be Mother's Day on the secular calendar 
and Pentecost Sunday on the Christian calendar.

JUDGE'S REVERSAL OF CLEANUP ORDER MAY SLOW STATE'S POLLUTION FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A court decision blocking the state-ordered cleanup of an industrial site at 
Agua Dulce could help polluting companies resist costly cleanups at other 
California waste sites, according to state and private attorneys involved in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
The court case, which involves Space Ordnance Systems' Mint Canyon plant at 
Agua Dulce, is the first successful legal challenge of a cleanup order issued 
under the state's Superfund program, according to state officials. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the ruling last year by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Loren 
Miller Jr., Space Ordnance may never have to carry out a ground-water cleanup 
at an estimated cost of $726,800. 
</P>
<P>
And if the ruling is upheld on appeal, it could complicate attempts to 
decontaminate some other sites among the 423 on the state Superfund list, 
lawyers in the case agree. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Be Restrictive 
</P>
<P>
The ruling could "place a restriction on the state's ability to fashion an 
appropriate cleanup plan for the different hazardous waste sites in the state 
of California," said Deputy Atty. Gen. Donald A. Robinson, who represents state 
health officials. 
</P>
<P>
Ernie Getto, a lawyer for the firm that filed the challenge, said it might 
force the Department of Health Services to take a "more practical approach to 
seeking cleanup," with "a harder look at a cost-benefit kind of analysis." 
Getto represents Allied-Signal, Space Ordnance's landlord, which would have to 
share the cost. Allied-Signal argued in court that the cleanup would produce 
"no meaningful public health benefit." 
</P>
<P>
The state Court of Appeal may hear oral arguments on the state's appeal by the 
end of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Challenge Filed 
</P>
<P>
Allied-Signal filed the challenge late in 1987 after state health officials 
directed Space Ordnance, a defense and aerospace contractor, to purge soil and 
ground water of chemicals at both its Mint Canyon plant and its Placerita 
Canyon plant 15 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Space Ordnance, a division of Sherman Oaks-based TransTechnology Corp., came 
under health department scrutiny in 1984 when a small army of health and law 
enforcement officers swarmed over its plants in a probe of hazardous waste 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
The raids turned up evidence that Space Ordnance had improperly stored and 
disposed of solvent-tainted waste water, including dumping it along creek beds 
and spraying it from sprinklers. The company eventually paid $300,000 in fines 
for misdemeanor violations of hazardous waste rules, and two executives served 
brief jail terms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Plants On State List 
</P>
<P>
Both the Mint and Placerita Canyon plants were put on the state Superfund list 
of toxic cleanup sites. As with the parallel federal Superfund program, state 
Superfund sites are considered a threat to health or the environment. Those 
responsible for the wastes are required to do cleanup work as prescribed by the 
state. If they cannot be identified, the state can finance the work. 
</P>
<P>
But the Space Ordnance affair produced more legal pyrotechnics than proof of 
grave environmental harm. And in November, 1987, soon after the state issued a 
cleanup order for the Mint Canyon plant, Allied-Signal went to court. 
</P>
<P>
Allied-Signal, an aerospace and chemical giant, had just acquired Garrett 
Corp., which owned and leased the Mint Canyon plant to Space Ordnance. In 
acquiring Garrett, Allied-Signal also took over its obligation to share in the 
cost of the Space Ordnance cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
The main ground-water contaminant was trichloroethylene (TCE), a solvent used 
to degrease metal and a suspected human carcinogen. But even TCE was present 
only in low concentrations, averaging between 5 parts per billion and 8.5 
p.p.b. in the most polluted test wells. Although the state followed an "action 
level," or advisory limit, of 5 p.p.b. for TCE in drinking water, no one drank 
this ground water after 1984, when Space Ordnance switched to bottled water at 
the plant. 
</P>
<P>
"Ground-water contamination at the site is exceptionally minor," Allied-Signal 
argued in court. The $726,800 cleanup was "not justified by the levels of 
chemicals reported," it said. 
</P>
<P>
Space Ordnance petitioned to intervene on Allied-Signal's side, arguing in 
court papers that carrying out the cleanup would place it in legal jeopardy of 
violating Proposition 65. Passed by the voters in 1986, the measure bars 
release into water of cancer-causing chemicals and allows private citizens to 
sue to enforce its provisions. 
</P>
<P>
Under the state's order, Space Ordnance was to extract ground water, filter it 
and return it to the ground, but "not every molecule of TCE will always be 
removed," the company said in court papers. As a result, the company could "be 
exposed to potential civil penalties" under Proposition 65 for following the 
state's orders, Space Ordnance said. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general's office countered that the Department of Health Services, 
as "the state agency with experience and expertise" in the area, should have 
broad authority to direct cleanup work without being second-guessed. 
</P>
<P>
As for contentions that the water pollution was minor, the state said the water 
was not Space Ordnance's or Allied-Signal's to pollute. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Replies 
</P>
<P>
"The People of the State of California did not choose to have its ground water 
contaminated by TCE," the state said. "The People are entitled to have their 
ground water free of a probable human carcinogen. . . . It makes good technical 
sense (and good common sense) to remove as much TCE as possible from the ground 
water now, rather than to allow it to remain there and hope that some future 
generation will not have to reckon with it." 
</P>
<P>
But in his order in July, Judge Miller found that the state did not have the 
"substantial evidence" needed to support the cleanup plan. In particular, 
Miller said, to require TCE levels to be reduced below 5 p.p.b. was not 
justified because this was merely an "action level" -- an informal guideline 
adopted without public hearings or comment. 
</P>
<P>
The four-paragraph ruling made no mention of the fact that 5 p.p.b. already was 
the formal federal drinking water standard for TCE. The level was in the 
process of being adopted as a formal state standard, and since has been. 
</P>
<P>
And Space Ordnance's Proposition 65 concerns have since been addressed by a 
state regulation. The rule makes it legal to put contaminated water back even 
if a trace of pollution remains. 
</P>
<P>
Many toxic compounds found in soil or water at hazardous waste sites are not 
yet covered by formal state standards. This has not stopped the state from 
ordering cleanups, using informal guidelines or its best judgment of health 
risks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Effect Noted 
</P>
<P>
Still, Miller's ruling has received virtually no public attention and has not 
noticeably affected the state toxic waste program, said Bob Borzelleri, a 
spokesman for the health services department's toxics control program. Agency 
officials "are not shaking in their boots over this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A ruling by one Superior Court judge is not binding on another. And lawyers for 
both sides said an impact would be felt only if the Court of Appeal upholds 
Miller's decision. 
</P>
<P>
With Allied-Signal challenging only the ground-water filtering at Mint Canyon, 
Space Ordnance has gone ahead with the rest of the work. 
</P>
<P>
Contaminated soil at the Mint Canyon plant has been removed, said Alan Opel, 
chief technical officer for TransTechnology, the Space Ordnance parent. 
</P>
<P>
The company has also gone ahead with a $1.5-million cleanup at the Placerita 
plant, where contaminated soils and buried tanks have been removed, and ground 
water is being extracted and filtered at a rate of about 15,000 gallons per day 
to remove chemicals, primarily TCE and benzene. Opel said the ground-water 
cleanup will probably continue for five years.

GRANT HIGH GETS READY FOR TEACHER STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The career center at Grant High School -- usually cluttered with books, 
pamphlets, posters, student files and scholarship announcements -- was neat and 
bare Friday afternoon, its contents packed into 21 cardboard boxes ready for 
storage. 
</P>
<P>
Center director Alan Ringer's desk was cleared of its paper work, except for a 
few snapshots and an appointment book. Chairs were upended on tables, 
typewriters and a computer locked away. 
</P>
<P>
Ringer said the equipment and materials, collected during a long career, are 
too valuable to risk losing during the chaos that may ensue if Los Angeles 
teachers strike Monday. 
</P>
<P>
He said most teachers plan to lock their important materials away or take them 
home. "It's not to be defiant but only to make sure that everything is secure," 
said Ringer, co-chairman of the Grant chapter of United Teachers-Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers, administrators and students at Grant, in Van Nuys, tried to keep cool 
heads Friday, despite a giddiness born of adrenaline and uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors flew about negotiations, and teachers held a spirited 
question-and-answer session with union officials in the school's library. The 
gathering was accented with mild profanity, anti-Board of Education repartee 
and declarations of solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't remember this much spirit the first time," said English department 
chairman Garrett Wossner, a veteran of the 1970 Los Angeles teachers' strike. 
"There's a spirit of militancy abroad." 
</P>
<P>
Principal Robert Collins worked with Grant's four other administrators to put 
the final touches on plans for security, scheduling and staffing for 3,300 
students and more than 100 classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Students fretted over whether to show up at Grant on Monday or to wait the 
strike out at home. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the main things confusing us is what teachers say," said Ron Brigel, 
17. "Some tell us to raise hell with the substitutes, some say don't come at 
all, and others said the work assigned during the strike won't count so don't 
even bother doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Brigel said he planned to attend because not showing up could hurt his grades. 
</P>
<P>
Others planned to stay at home to avoid a rumored gang fight. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel there might be rioting or other things going on because there's a lot 
of bad feelings," said Kenisa Stalling, 16, explaining why she plans to stay 
home. "If I come, we'd just be sitting around and I come here to learn." 
</P>
<P>
Collins offered assurances of safety. A police officer, two administrators and 
three campus aides will be present. He said he did not believe the gang fight 
rumors but said his staff would be ready in any case. 
</P>
<P>
He and other administrators met with a group of parents Friday, and he had met 
earlier in the week with student leaders and teachers. He issued a two-page 
memo telling pupils what to do in case of unstaffed classrooms and promising 
that scheduled activities would take place. 
</P>
<P>
The plans were listed in a sheaf of papers covering nearly every aspect of how 
to run a sprawling urban high school during a teachers' strike. Collins said he 
expected more than 80% of the school's 132 teachers to honor the picket line. 
</P>
<P>
As he planned for the strike, he looked beyond it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see this as a battle or a war," he said. "My concern right now is 
absolutely for the smooth operation of my school when teachers return, so that 
the deep divisions that can exist when some go out and others do not, don't 
occur." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers scheduled picket-line duty, urged one another to bring cameras to 
photograph strikebreakers and talked about how to apply for emergency loans. 
They also thought about their students. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Check on Students 
</P>
<P>
Ringer, for example, on Friday broke the news to one girl that she had received 
a $500 scholarship. He arranged to use a telephone next week to check on 
working students he supervises. He discreetly handed out his unlisted home 
telephone number to some pupils needing advice on college or career plans. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of them will come and talk to me on the picket line, and I will still 
talk to them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Gruenberg, the school's dean of students, tried to settle all the 
discipline cases that still remained on his desk Friday. "I don't want students 
coming in Monday having to serve detentions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pam Felcher, an English teacher, said she told her students that their term 
papers were due Monday, strike or no strike. "If we're all here on Tuesday, I 
want to go right on," she said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN SENTENCED TO 4 YEARS IN STABBING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A21-year-old Tujunga man was sentenced Friday to four years in prison for a 
stabbing death that occurred during an argument about a woman. 
</P>
<P>
Jaime Marquez Alvarez was sentenced by San Fernando Superior Court Judge 
Meredith C. Taylor after pleading guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the Jan. 
25, 1988, slaying of Martin Jimenez Pelayo, 25, of Tujunga. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez received a lesser penalty for the offense because it was determined 
that he may have suffered brain damage in a fight with the victim, triggering 
his behavior, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Meredith S. Rust. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Alvarez had gone to an apartment in the 10200 block of Tujunga 
Canyon Boulevard to see a woman. Pelayo, who was in the apartment, told Alvarez 
that the girl did not want to talk to him because he was drunk. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Rust said, the men started fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez eventually left and returned a short time later with a sharp object 
that he used to stab the victim, Rust said.

<P>
A jewelry store in Northridge Fashion Center was burglarized of an estimated 
$100,000 worth of rings, watches, diamonds and other jewelry, Los Angeles 
police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
One or more burglars broke into Hudson-Goodman Jewelers shortly after 2 a.m. 
Thursday, Lt. Harvie Eubank said. 
</P>
<P>
A rear door of the store was pried open and a battery-operated alarm was 
deactivated, but investigators have not determined how the burglar or burglars 
entered the mall, Eubank said. 
</P>
<P>
Several glass display cases were smashed, and items were taken selectively, 
with the least valuable jewelry left behind, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The store opened about a week ago.

HALL BEGINS MAIL CAMPAIGN AGAINST BERNARDI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With slightly more than three weeks left before the runoff election, Los 
Angeles City Council candidate Lyle Hall launched the first phase of his mail 
campaign Friday by sending flyers to two groups of voters. 
</P>
<P>
One went to absentee voters. Another went mostly to people whom polls have 
identified as being similar to Hall's supporters in the April 11 election, said 
Hall's campaign consultant, Harvey Englander. He declined to describe that 
group in detail. 
</P>
<P>
Hall's material is less personal than it was before the April election. Instead 
of reminding voters that his opponent in the June 6 runoff, Councilman Ernani 
Bernardi, is 77 years old and has often been absent from council meetings, the 
latest flyer argues that it is time for a change and criticizes the councilman 
on issues. 
</P>
<P>
"I have known Ernie Bernardi for 18 years and I know that he is a good family 
man and that he has tried his best," Hall says in the mailer. "But Ernie has 
been on the council since 1961 -- 28 years -- and it's time to bring new ideas 
and energy to the job." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fencing Complexes 
</P>
<P>
Hall -- a city fire captain and former president of the firefighters union -- 
attacks the incumbent for suggesting that fences around apartment complexes 
solve crime and drug problems. The issue surfaced recently over a fence planned 
for the San Fernando Gardens public housing project in Pacoima, which is 
opposed by a small group of tenants. 
</P>
<P>
The fences force "many of our neighbors to feel like they are being caged," 
Hall proclaims in his mailer. "I believe that we should put criminals behind 
bars, not innocent people." 
</P>
<P>
He also blames Bernardi for not attacking problems of San Fernando Valley 
crime, gridlock and uncontrolled growth. 
</P>
<P>
"The haphazard planning he has permitted has hurt our neighborhoods," Hall, 49, 
says. "We have too many mini-malls and not enough single-family homes to move 
up to." 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi refused to respond to Hall's mailers Friday, saying: "There isn't 
anything here to react to. I don't want to react. 
</P>
<P>
"There'll be plenty of time to put our position out, and it'll be coming out 
pretty quickly . . . and we'll do it in a positive way," Bernardi said, 
referring to his own plans for a mail campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi has hired campaign consultant Allen Hoffenblum to coordinate mailings 
for the runoff. This is the first time that Bernardi has hired a consultant 
since the 1960s. Bernardi received 41.5% of the vote in April, forcing him into 
a runoff with Hall, who was second with 25.7%. 
</P>
<P>
The two campaigns have differed markedly in tone. Hall has relied mostly on 
news conferences to announce endorsements. Bernardi has mainly shaken hands at 
ground breakings and community events. 
</P>
<P>
The two have displayed their different styles publicly three times, twice in 
debates and once in a community forum. Bernardi, his face red and a fist in the 
air, delivered stentorian defenses of his record. Hall was much quieter and 
usually didn't react to Bernardi's speeches. 
</P>
<P>
Consultants Englander and Hoffenblum were on different sides in a City Council 
race in 1985. Englander worked for a challenger then too, developing strategy 
for Michael Woo in a successful campaign against Councilwoman Peggy Stevenson 
in the 13th District.

SPACE ORDNANCE SYSTEMS WILL CLOSE PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Space Ordnance Systems, the defense and aerospace firm, has begun phasing out 
operations at its Mint Canyon plant at Agua Dulce northeast of Santa Clarita, 
company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the 60 workers at Mint Canyon will lose their jobs, but others will be 
transferred to the company's Placerita Canyon plant about 15 miles away, said 
Sheila Klein, director of administration for the firm. 
</P>
<P>
The plant phase-out, which is to be completed by July, results from reduced 
orders for the infrared decoy flares manufactured at Mint Canyon, Klein said. 
The flares are used by military airplanes to divert heat-seeking missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Space Ordnance, a division of TransTechnology Corp. of Sherman Oaks, has 
occupied the Mint Canyon plant for 10 years under a lease from Garrett Corp. 
and later Allied-Signal, which acquired Garrett in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
At the Placerita plant, which employs about 130 workers, Space Ordnance 
manufactures explosive bolts and other devices for military hardware and the 
space program.

ONE MORE GO-AROUND ON BLACK-WHITE ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Murray gets an F in genetics for his column, "One Man's Sun-Baked Theory on 
Athletic Supremacy," in which he criticizes NBC for broadcasting the results of 
scientific research indicating that athletes with African ancestors have 
superior athletic skills over those without such ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
Murray argues that the results are incorrect because many black athletes also 
have white ancestors. Anyone who passed Biology I or Anthropology I knows that 
genetically it is irrelevant whether those athletes have white ancestors. If an 
athlete has any African ancestry and Africans have superior athletic skills 
that are not possessed by other races, then there is a strong probability that 
that person will inherit those skills.

SOLAR-POWERED CSUN STILL ALIVE IN CCAA TITLE RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cal State Northridge baseball team, refusing to let the sun set on its run 
for the school's first California Collegiate Athletic Assn. title since 1981, 
lately has been driven by Solar power. 
</P>
<P>
Friday at Northridge, freshman shortstop Mike Solar hit his second home run in 
as many days as Northridge beat Cal State Dominguez Hills, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
The victory improved the Matadors record to 30-18-1 overall, 16-11-1 in 
conference play, and set the stage for today's final regularly scheduled game 
at Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
If Northridge beats the Toros (15-29-2, 10-18-1), the Matadors will play a 
make-up game against conference-leading Cal Poly San Luis Obispo on Sunday. A 
victory over San Luis Obispo would pull Northridge within a half-game of first 
and likely force a makeup game at home Monday against UC Riverside. A victory 
would automatically give the Matadors a berth in the NCAA Division II 
regionals, which begin May 19. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to go out and play like we always do," said Solar, who hit a grand 
slam Thursday during a 9-0 win at Dominguez Hills. "We're pretty confident 
right now. We just have to stay with it." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge pitcher Vale Lopez (6-9) took it to Dominguez Hills on Friday, 
pitching his 12th complete game. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, a junior right-hander from Port Hueneme, gave up 10 hits, struck out one 
and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills pulled within two runs in the ninth on consecutive two-out 
doubles by Adrian Rodriguez and Robert Campbell, but Lopez stifled the rally by 
inducing pinch-hitter Vic Fresca to fly to center. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess this is where we want to be," Lopez said. "We just need someone to 
push a little and we come through." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge managed eight hits off Dominguez Hills right-hander Charlie Plumley 
(4-5), the victim of first-inning errors that allowed Northridge to take a 1-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Clayton led off with a single and moved to third when Toro left-fielder 
Lenny Hokanson dropped Greg Shockey's slicing fly ball near the left-field foul 
line. Rusty McLain drove in Clayton with the first of his two run-scoring 
sacrifice flies. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills, however, took a 2-1 lead in the second. Mike Gabbani hit a 
solo home run and Tom Acuna singled before Solar committed consecutive errors 
on grounders by Bill Keep and Rodriguez that allowed Acuna to score. 
</P>
<P>
Solar redeemed himself in the fourth by following McLain's single with a 
two-run shot over the left-field wall that put Northridge ahead, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills' Ruben Jauregui tied the score with a two-out solo home run in 
the fifth before CSUN again rallied in its half of the inning. After Randy 
Thompson led off with a double, Shockey came through with a run-scoring single 
that broke the 3-3 tie and proved to be the game-winning hit. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge scored its final runs in the seventh on a run-scoring double by 
Chae-Ho Chong and a sacrifice fly by McLain. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we came out early and played tight for the first time since the 
beginning of the year," Northridge Coach Bill Kernen said. "But I think our 
players are ready for tomorrow. They're as ready as they're ever going to be." 
</P>

RIO MESA'S 8-0 WIN CAPS STRONG FINISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Senior right-hander Jon Rust won his seventh consecutive Channel League start, 
and Rio Mesa High completed a strong second half to clinch second place with an 
8-0 victory over Hueneme on Friday at Rio Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Rust, who has not allowed a run in 24 innings, gave up only three hits to 
improve his record to 9-2. Rio Mesa (14-8-1, 10-3-1), the defending league 
champion, won eight of its final nine league games. 
</P>
<P>
After throwing 65 pitches Wednesday against San Marcos in a 13-3 victory, Rust 
needed 84 to dispatch Hueneme in a complete-game performance. 
</P>
<P>
"Jon just gets better and better," Rio Mesa Coach Rich Duran said. "He's strong 
as a bull and he wants the ball. And it's real easy to give it to him." 
</P>
<P>
David Frazier had three hits, including a solo homer in the fifth, and two runs 
batted in. Carlos Cendejas had three hits for the Spartans, and Steve Soliz 
added two hits, including a home run. Dmitri Young contributed two singles and 
two RBIs.

LESSON LEARNED FROM A NET LOSS AT PIERCE

<P>
Sundantha Soysa came to the United States from Sri Lanka to improve as a tennis 
player while getting a college education. 
</P>
<P>
No problem on the first count. Paul Xanthos, tennis coach at Pierce College, 
reports that Soysa has improved vastly since arriving at the Woodland Hills 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
But what of his education? Well, most of it has come outside the classroom in a 
lesson that could be called Real Life 101.

Soysa had it good in Sri Lanka where his father, Lal, is a spice-commodities 
exporter. The family had drivers for its three cars and a number of servants. 
"I never tasted the hard life," Soysa said. 
</P>
<P>
Soysa started playing tennis when he was 8. At 10, he was playing in 
tournaments. Eventually, he became the youngest player to be selected for Sri 
Lanka's Davis Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
The easy life continued in Hawaii, where Soysa played in a series of satellite 
tournaments the summer before his 17th birthday. His coach paid for everything. 
"All I did was play tennis and run a little," Soysa said. 
</P>
<P>
The next fall he came to Pierce, where his family hoped his performance on the 
court and in class might earn a college scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
That was almost two years ago. Two long years, according to Soysa, who 
estimates that he has earned only 12 units of college credit. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1988, Soysa enrolled at Pierce but was dropped from all of his 
classes because of excessive absences. This spring, he didn't even manage to 
enroll. He didn't have the money. 
</P>
<P>
The family's exporting business is going through difficult times and Soysa's 
father was unable to transfer tuition money for his son. And, because of the 
terms of his visa, Soysa is not allowed to work. 
</P>
<P>
"I socialize and pay my room rent," Soysa said. "But that's it." 
</P>
<P>
Soysa, now 18, has played only a handful of matches for Pierce and for that he 
blames himself (for at first not going to class), the administration at Pierce 
(for not giving him more time to come up with tuition money) and his parents. 
</P>
<P>
"Their fault, not mine," Soysa said, referring to his parents. "If I had a job 
or something then I could blame myself." 
</P>
<P>
Soysa's visa is good through April, 1990, but he says that he may have to 
return home sooner. 
</P>
<P>
"If I don't go to school I can always go back to my dad's business," Soysa 
said. "But I would like to be richer than my dad was, to live a nice life and 
do it myself. If I don't go to school, the only thing going for me is tennis. 
My tennis is the answer to the whole thing, so I have to keep playing and 
hoping something will happen." 
</P>
<P>
Although he wasn't able to play much for Pierce, Soysa practiced with the team 
every day. And he considers himself a better player and person for his college 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned a lot. Much more than I ever thought I could learn. I didn't get 
a classroom education, but I've learned to be a man the last few months. I've 
gone from a kid to an adult." 
</P>
<P>
He's No. 1: Brad Gossen, formerly of Westlake High, has won the No. 1 
quarterback job at Washington State after strong outings in four spring 
scrimmages, according to Coach Mike Price. 
</P>
<P>
Gossen completed 56 of 74 passes (75.7%) for 773 yards and threw two 
interceptions in spring practice. The No. 1 job opened when Timm Rosenbach 
announced that he would forgo his senior year and enter the NFL's supplemental 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
Gossen played for Westlake in 1984-85 and holds every significant career and 
single-season school passing record. 
</P>
<P>
Caged cats: The College of the Canyons baseball team might have been a victim 
of the program's past success. 
</P>
<P>
After winning the Western State Conference title outright the past eight 
seasons, Canyons tied Ventura for the championship this year. But the Cougars 
were left out in the cold when the Southern California regional of the junior 
college state tournament began Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons was excluded because of a WSC rule that provides for only one automatic 
bye into the conference championship round. Because two teams are taken from 
the WSC, the regular-season champion is thereby guaranteed an automatic berth 
in the state tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura had beaten the Cougars in the season series, so the Pirates were given 
an automatic bye into the championship of the WSC playoff tournament, which 
they won by defeating Valley. Canyons lost in the first round, losing all 
chance of qualifying for the state playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, WSC coaches amended the conference rules for co-champions. 
</P>
<P>
Co-champions will now gain automatic bids into the state tournament while teams 
that finish third through sixth will compete in a conference tournament to 
determine a potential third-place representative.

BIRMINGHAM'S BURT ADVANCES IN THREE EVENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE GLAZE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rodney Burt of Birmingham High decided not to run in the 100 meters at the City 
Section quarterfinals Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel too confident about it," Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
The other 100-meter runners may have breathed a sigh of relief when Burt 
scratched, but confidence was probably what most of his adversaries were 
lacking when they saw Burt setting his starting blocks in Lane 5 prior to the 
400 at Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
Burt easily made up the stagger on Alonzo Catia of Van Nuys and Greg Solis of 
Wilson within the first 100 meters. The Brave senior built a five-meter lead 
and won in 48.95. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was an easy heat," said Burt, who finished fifth in the 400 at last 
year's City final. "I didn't run for time, just to win." 
</P>
<P>
Burt also ran a heat in the 200, in which qualifying for next week's semifinals 
wasn't so easy, and the anchor leg for the Braves' 1,600-meter relay team. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley Pac-8 Conference champion finished third in the 200 in 22.71 behind 
Washington's Donovan Burkes (22.02), the third-place finisher in the City final 
last year who was later disqualified for a lane violation, and Kevin Copeland 
(22.35) of Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
"I could do much better. I'll just keep running it," Burt said. "I'm sure I'll 
make it to City finals. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1,600 relay, Burt covered the final 400 meters in 47.6 seconds to 
overtake North Hollywood and help Birmingham, which finished fourth in 3 
minutes, 26.71 seconds, qualify for the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
William Childs of Reseda led all qualifiers in the 110 high hurdles, winning in 
14.96. Childs, a senior, also finished second in the 300 intermediates in 
41.28. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Gastelum of Birmingham surged past Belmont's Natividad Gaona in the final 
50 meters of the 1,600, winning in a personal best 4:22.57. 
</P>
<P>
Feltina Means of Van Nuys qualified for the semifinals in four events. 
</P>
<P>
Means ran 47.11 in the 300 low hurdles. The junior placed second in the 100 low 
hurdles (16.53), third in the long jump (16-3) and seventh in the high jump 
(4-8).

SYMPHONY FLAILS MOZART UNDER GUEST CONDUCTOR

<TEXT>
<P>
Contrasted with the elation of last week's San Diego Symphony performances 
under music director-designate Yoav Talmi, the ethos of Thursday's symphony 
concert was dispirited to say the least. Guest conductor Reinhard Peters, the 
Berlin Philharmonic's permanent guest conductor, started the program 
inauspiciously with a testy, unrefined reading of Mozart's "Jupiter Symphony." 
Although Mozart is not the local orchestra's strong suit, it has seldom treated 
poor old Amadeus with such careless, unsympathetic playing. Peters slashed away 
as if he were beating a foe into submission, turning the usually sunny work 
into a dour exercise. 
</P>
<P>
Following the Mozart symphony with Chopin's First Piano Concerto may not have 
been a programming stroke of genius, but at least it brought Cuban pianist 
Juana Zayas into the picture. Her brilliant grasp of the concerto and her 
refined sense of style exorcised the negative karma from Symphony Hall. 
Especially in the concerto's shimmering middle movement, she waxed poetic 
without a hint of indulgence. Her execution of a true Chopin rubato was 
exemplary, as were her phrasing and articulation. She made the rondo dance with 
the clarity of her rhythmic ideas. Fortunately, the orchestra managed to absorb 
a modicum of her generous spirit in its accompanying role. 
</P>
<P>
The longish first half was followed by Hindemith's symphonic extracts from his 
opera "Mathis der Maler." Peters seemed much more comfortable with this 
colorful orchestral showpiece, although his podium style still bristled with 
busy, exaggerated movements. Most compelling was the orchestra's dramatic final 
movement, "The Temptation of St. Anthony." Peters demanded bold declamation, 
and the orchestra responded eagerly, especially the brass choirs, whose 
burnished flourishes had the unwavering strength of a mighty cathedral organ. 
</P>
<P>
Peters' interpretation of the opening movement, "Angelic Concert," lacked the 
ethereal edge, that sense of awe the composer meant to instill as he depicted a 
mystical panel from Matthias Grunewald's Isenheim altarpiece. These jaunty 
angels sounded more like gamboling nymphs. Nevertheless, the orchestra pulled 
together and redeemed the sins of the first half.

3 DIE AS RUNAWAY TRAIN TUMBLES ONTO HOMES; 
</P>
<P>
FREIGHT HITS 90 M.P.H. BEFORE LEAVING TRACKS IN SAN BERNARDINO; MAN PULLED 
ALIVE FROM RUBBLE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A runaway freight train careened down the Cajon Pass, leaped the tracks, 
plunged down a 30-foot embankment and slammed into seven homes Friday morning, 
killing two boys in one of the houses and a trainman. 
</P>
<P>
One man was missing and 10 were injured, but a man sitting on his couch when 
the train derailed and flattened his home was miraculously discovered alive 
beneath 15 feet of rubble more than 13 hours after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Shaw, 24, was discovered shortly after 9 p.m. by firefighters using 
shovels to pick through the ruins of his house. Rescue workers lifted him to 
safety late Friday night, as onlookers cheered. 
</P>
<P>
Railroad officials said that minutes before the 7:38 a.m. crash, a crewman 
radioed a "Mayday" call that the heavily laden train was out of control as it 
began to accelerate down the long 2.2% grade. 
</P>
<P>
All six locomotives and 69 cars of the Southern Pacific freight were hurled 
from the tracks as the train entered a curve at 90 m.p.h., about three times 
the normal speed, Southern Pacific officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The wreckage piled up in a grotesque heap of twisted metal that literally 
flattened two of the homes, including Shaw's and the one in which the young 
stepbrothers died. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of tons of sand-like sodium carbonate, also known as sal soda, spilled 
from the hopper cars into yards, houses and streets, burying much of the 
rubble. Stuffed toys, furniture and kitchen utensils were scattered amid the 
massive, dune-like heaps of dusty, splintered debris. 
</P>
<P>
Police, firefighters and neighbors clawed through the wreckage to free the 
injured and take them to nearby hospitals. Paramedics worked with power tools 
for more than three hours before they were able to free the body of the 
trainman from the lead locomotive. He was identified as Everett S. Crown, 35, 
of Bakersfield, the train's conductor and a 17-year employee of the railroad. 
</P>
<P>
The two dead boys were identified as Jason H. Thompson, 9, and Tyson White, 7. 
</P>
<P>
One missing man was identified as Alan R. Riess, 42, of Bakersfield, a brakeman 
riding near the front of the train. He was believed still buried in the 
wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Presumed Dead 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day, Shaw was also missing and presumed dead. His home, which he 
shares with his mother, Maryann, was the most seriously damaged -- totally 
obliterated by several locomotives. 
</P>
<P>
But persistent efforts by specially trained search-and-rescue dogs and workers 
digging through the rubble paid off. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad my son is out of the house," said a jubilant Maryann Shaw. "It was up 
to God. I thank God he's made it." Despite his ordeal, Christopher Shaw was 
described as lucid and conversing with firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
Riding with Crown and Riess in the lead locomotives had been the engineer, 
Frank W. Holland, 33, of Bakersfield, who suffered head injuries, cuts, a 
broken shoulder and broken ribs in the crash, according to Southern Pacific 
officials. None of the others injured were identified. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately determined what caused the train -- bound for Long Beach 
from Mojave with the load of sal soda that is used in fabric and water 
softeners -- to burst out of control on the long grade down through the San 
Bernardino Mountains to San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
Some officials said the train's brakes apparently failed, but others said an 
examination of the wheels showed that the brakes had been applied for at least 
part of the long ride down. 
</P>
<P>
Railroad officials said three event recorders were on board the train and have 
not yet been recovered. The devices record crucial data on the train's 
operation and actions of its crew. 
</P>
<P>
The train sped for miles down the grade before leaping from the tracks, ripping 
through some power lines and crashing into the tract of modest, single-story 
houses in the largely minority neighborhood near Highland Avenue and Duffy 
Street on the northwest side of San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard a noise that sounded like an earthquake," said Ruth Green, who has 
lived on Duffy Street since 1972. "I looked out and I saw that train flying." 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it wasn't going to make that curve," said Walt Greenwood, another Duffy 
Street resident, whose back fence was crumpled by one of the train's huge steel 
wheels. "I grabbed my wife and son and we ran." 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino Sheriff's Capt. Ray Harper saw the crash while driving to work 
on Highland Avenue: "There was a bright blue light, a huge flash as the 
transformers blew. It was eerie. I thought the thing was coming toward me." 
</P>
<P>
Diesel fuel leaked from the shattered locomotives and officials, concerned 
about the threat of fire from the fuel evacuated the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
However, the fuel did not ignite and officials said the train was not carrying 
any toxic material that could have posed a hazard to residents or the 
environment. Pumps were used to empty the remaining fuel from the tanks of the 
locomotives. 
</P>
<P>
Two towering cranes were brought in to start moving the wreckage. Officials 
waited several hours to make sure of the location of an underground jet fuel 
line before they started using the heavy equipment to dig through the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
The railroad said it may be weeks before they can clean up enough of the mess 
to rebuild the torn track and get traffic moving on the heavily traveled line 
again. On Friday, Southern Pacific rail traffic was rerouted on other tracks, 
but officials said they plan to construct a temporary bypass around the damaged 
stretch soon. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross set up an emergency shelter near the crash scene, serving coffee 
and food and providing trauma counseling and cots for victims. School children 
from the neighborhood spent about three hours at the shelter, but most of the 
50 families evacuated were housed by the railroad for the night at hotels in 
San Bernardino. Officials said those whose homes were not destroyed probably 
could return to them today. 
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board sent a field representative from Los 
Angeles and a team of experts from its headquarters in Washington to 
investigate the accident. Railroad officials said they expect the investigation 
to take weeks. 
</P>
<P>
A team of dogs specially trained to sniff out the dead and injured was flown in 
from the Bay Area to search for additional victims. The dogs, used previously 
to hunt for survivors of the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, were provided by the 
California Rescue Dog Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The injured were being treated at three hospitals in the area -- St. 
Bernadine's Hospital and the San Bernardino County Medical Center in San 
Bernardino and Loma Linda Medical Center in Loma Linda. 
</P>
<P>
Police said several of those hospitalized owed a word of thanks to the 
neighbors who helped pull them from the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
Lavene Brewster said her husband, Dudley, was one of those who helped. 
</P>
<P>
"He heard a lady screaming across the street and he ran to rescue her," 
Brewster said. "She passed out in his arms. He carried her over to our house." 
</P>
<P>
Brewster, visibly shaken as she sat with her two young sons at the Red Cross 
shelter, said the railroad line looming over the homes had always seemed 
menacing. 
</P>
<P>
"I have worried about those trains for years," she said. "It's a nightmare, a 
nightmare come true." 
</P>
<P>
As the daylight faded, the devastated block took on a surreal look, as mangled 
barbecues, automobiles and patio furniture were bathed in a pink light. 
Occasionally, a bewildered cat or pet rabbit scampered through the streets, 
which were thick with the smell of diesel and periodically swirling with clouds 
of ash.

AN URGE TO BURN;

<P>
MADAGASCAR: RARE ISLAND UP IN SMOKE

ANDASIBE, Madagascar 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Madagascar is burning. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence is everywhere: in the haze of smoke that drapes itself into the 
steep dales of the capital, Antananarivo, in the evening; in acres of hillside 
blackened with fire that line the road on the three-hour drive from there to 
this forest glen near the east coast, leaving nothing but a stubble of tree 
stumps. 
</P>
<P>
It is visible in the appearance from the air of the great island's central 
highlands, its once-deep forests burned away, leaving only a threadbare 
coverlet of green, as thin as the felt of an old billiard table, through which 
the rich red of Madagascar's soil bleeds. 
</P>
<P>
Blessed with a bounty of plant and animal life almost unique on Earth, thanks 
to 165 million years of geographical isolation from the African mainland, 
Madagascar is cursed with a human population of pyromaniacs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Centuries-Old Habit 
</P>
<P>
The result of their fires is that this fourth-largest island in the world is 
also the most heavily eroded. Compounded by a population explosion, the 
residents' centuries-old habit of slash-and-burn agriculture today menaces the 
island's future. 
</P>
<P>
The story is told here of a visiting Soviet cosmonaut who told his hosts that 
their island is the only land mass he could never fail to identify from space. 
It is always surrounded by a halo of bright red sea, he explained, the color of 
the soil relentlessly scrubbed off its denuded surface by the wind and rain. 
</P>
<P>
Madagascar's prized lemurs, the squirrel-tailed, dog-muzzled, monkey-like 
primates of which 23 species are unique to the island, have been pushed out of 
their accustomed habitats into progressively smaller strips of forest. 
</P>
<P>
Its precious rice fields, which feed the world's heaviest per capita consumers 
of rice, are fouled by soil eroded off the bare hills. Its best west coast port 
is all but useless today, so full is it of silt carried off the hills by its 
river. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spreading Malnutrition 
</P>
<P>
As the forests dwindle and the soil is degraded, charcoal and rice alike become 
more expensive, and malnutrition spreads among Madagascar's children. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Nicoll, a World Wildlife Fund official here, observed: "Virtually 
everyone in Madagascar is dependent on an endangered ecosystem." 
</P>
<P>
That ecosystem is one of the world's wonders. The island may not have lions, 
elephants or giraffes, but not one of its more than 400 species of primates, 
rodents, carnivores and insects is seen anywhere else on the globe. About 95% 
of its reptile species and 46% of its birds are also unique. 
</P>
<P>
Its outstanding diversity and sheer strangeness often have naturalists talking 
of Madagascar as if it were the product of a fabulist's imagination. 
</P>
<P>
"Butterflies as big as birds, and birds as colorful as the rainbow" were among 
the wonders listed by British environmentalists Gerald and Lee Durrell in their 
keynote address to a 1985 scientific conference marking the start of worldwide 
concern over the island's environment. 
</P>
<P>
Mammals here have retained traits that their mainland cousins lost in 
prehistoric times, such as the ultrasonic alarms and signals that tenrecs -- 
small, burrowing insectivores -- produce by vibrating their quills. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unusual Ecological Niches 
</P>
<P>
Others have filled ecological niches left vacant by the vagaries of evolution. 
For instance, the nocturnal aye-aye, perhaps the strangest of Madagascar's 
lemurs, fills the role of the rest of the world's woodpeckers by digging under 
tree bark for grubs with its spindly, "E.T"-like middle finger. 
</P>
<P>
But the Malagasy love affair with fire is increasingly at odds with this 
otherworldly population of animals and plants. 
</P>
<P>
The Malagasy burn for many reasons. They burn the hillsides to clear land for a 
form of rice culture known as tavy. They burn the flatlands to bring up new 
shoots of grass for their cattle to graze. They burn irreplaceable forest to 
make charcoal. 
</P>
<P>
"And sometimes," said Voara Randriamasolo, director of the national zoo in 
Antananarivo, "when they're unhappy with the government, they burn." 
</P>
<P>
The fires set in pastureland eat away at the edges of the rain forest, drying 
them up until they flake away like the pages of a yellowing book. "The fires 
get out of hand because the people set them and let them burn until they just 
die out," said Sheila O'Connor, a Cambridge University biologist working in the 
south of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Unprotected by forest, the rolling hills of the highlands are scarred by 
crescent-shaped earthslides and eroded gullies, so common that the Malagasy 
have a word for them in their quasi-Polynesian language: lavaka. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conservation Effort 
</P>
<P>
Yet for all that, Madagascar has today become the focus of one of the world's 
most ambitious conservation programs. Development agencies, including the U.N. 
Development Program and the U.S. Agency for International Development, have 
over the last three years made the environment their prime focus. 
</P>
<P>
In the same period, the government has awakened to the threat. After an 
international conference in 1985, the government approved a program to improve 
management of its 22 preserves and to add 14 sites to protect such delicate 
ecosystems as coral reefs and mangrove swamps. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, there's often no staff in some preserves, or sometimes one nominal 
guide, with no transport, no training," said Nicoll. 
</P>
<P>
With foreign help, the government is prepared to spend as much as $200,000 per 
year to train and equip wardens for each of 14 particularly important reserves 
selected for intensive management. The programs will include rural development 
schemes aimed at providing local farmers with alternatives to the ancient 
destructive practices. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, Madagascar is a test of environmental preservation programs in 
the Third World. Where environmentalism is no luxury, such programs must have 
their own justification. Farmers cannot simply be instructed not to burn; they 
must be told how to find alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Why Should We Stop?' 
</P>
<P>
"The difficulty," said Randriamasolo, "is the chiefs say, 'We've been burning 
for 100 years. . . . Why should we stop now?' " 
</P>
<P>
Complicating the process here has been a history of political, not just 
geographical, isolation. For 10 years beginning in 1975, the Malagasy 
government barred all foreign researchers from the island. When they were 
permitted to return, the government itself was just beginning to realize the 
seriousness of the decline. 
</P>
<P>
Even today, some Malagasy, just like many other Africans, bristle at the 
suggestion that foreign help is crucial to preservation of the island's 
ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
"It must be the Malagasy themselves who take matters in hand," said Bartholom 
Voahita, chairman of the World Wildlife Fund's local office. "The British or 
Americans wouldn't allow their patrimony to be taken over by Tanzanians, would 
they? So, why should we let ours be taken over by them?" 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the pace of destruction is so great, and the rate of discovery so slow, 
that scientists are convinced that countless species are going extinct without 
ever having been known. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the arrival of man on the island (1,500 years ago), two species of 
tortoise, three of birds and 11 of lemurs have disappeared," the Durrells told 
the 1985 conference. At least 238 others are endangered. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you'd have to conclude that there have been extinctions here in the 
last 20 years," said George Schatz, a botanist from the Missouri Botanical 
Gardens in St. Louis who has been helping the government chart a proposed 
reserve. "Sometimes a species is localized to just the side of a hill. When the 
hill goes, the species goes." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, new species are constantly being discovered in the island's 
newly explored areas. 
</P>
<P>
Not too long ago, botanists discovered a new palm -- not just a new species, 
but a new genus. It wasn't that the palm was so inconspicuous that no one 
noticed it before. Rather, it is a majestic tree, 100 feet high and crowned 
with a red crest that proclaims its presence from half a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
"It was in a place where people had never gotten to," said Schatz. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that one of every 20 plants I collect here is probably a new species," 
he added. "In my preserve, there might be 500 new species altogether." 
</P>
<P>
The decline of Madagascar's ecosystem began, if at a leisurely pace, with man's 
arrival from the South Pacific about 1,500 years ago. At that time, much of the 
island was covered with virgin rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the forest has receded to a thin strip along the island's eastern 
coast and clumps in the isolated northern and southern tips, and the Malagasy 
have perfected their slash-and-burn methods of cultivation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Population Explosion 
</P>
<P>
Destructive as they are, the impact of these techniques was limited when 
Madagascar was relatively thinly populated and the land plentiful. But in the 
last 20 years, the population has nearly doubled, to about 11 million from 6.2 
million in 1966. The pace of destruction has grown proportionately. 
</P>
<P>
"The farmers might get 400 to 500 kilograms of rice per hectare the first year 
(of slash-and-burn cultivation)," said the World Wildlife Fund's Nicoll. "The 
second year, they only get half as much. The third year, they get a tremendous 
infestation of pests and weeds because the soil is dying. So, it's abandoned. 
They pull out and leave it fallow for 11 to 15 years." 
</P>
<P>
That's long enough for the land to recover. But the population explosion has 
forced the Malagasy to telescope this cycle. 
</P>
<P>
"There is so little land now that the cycle is three to five years," said 
Nicoll. "That's not enough time for anything but grass and bamboo, so the cycle 
spirals downhill. They go into more difficult areas -- steeper hills, poorer 
climates." The destruction builds geometrically. 
</P>
<P>
Conservationists say the government's emphasis on preservation has borne some 
fruit in recent times, particularly by halting the commercial exploitation of 
endangered forest land for timber and by controlling the poaching of lemurs. 
</P>
<P>
Some local people have discovered that conservation pays more directly, too, in 
guide fees and jobs in tourist lodges. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps one of the greater successes is a small reserve known as Perinet, about 
50 miles east of the capital and just outside the railroad stop of Andasibe. 
Tree cutting and lemur hunting have all but ceased in the reserve, said Maurice 
Bedo, a young guide who explained that he grew up inside the forest of Perinet. 
</P>
<P>
"I spent all my childhood hours in here because I love nature," he said. Being 
a guide is so lucrative here that Maurice's brother, Joseph, recently gave up 
on his college preparation because no job he could aspire to with a college 
education would pay more than he gets now. 
</P>
<P>
In his patched blue jogging suit, Maurice leads a troop of researchers deep 
into the woods. Tree roots interlock in a sort of ladder up the steep 
hillsides. He stops frequently to point out the peculiar characteristics of the 
plants lining the path. This one is an anodyne for a scorpion bite, he 
explains, showing how one crumples the leaf and rubs the moisture on the skin. 
</P>
<P>
Perinet is dedicated to the preservation of Madagascar's largest lemur, the 
indri, a tailless brown-and-white teddy bear of a primate. 
</P>
<P>
The indri's most appreciated feature is its call. "A Callas among the lemurs," 
is the description of one naturalist, "who composes and performs its own 
operas." 
</P>
<P>
Presently, Maurice's brother, Joseph, emerges from a thicket with the news he 
has tracked down an indri family of five. Suddenly, they are spotted flinging 
themselves, limbs outstretched, across the wedge of sunlight coming through the 
treetops. Two can be seen folded together in the crook of a tree. 
</P>
<P>
Silence. 
</P>
<P>
Then with the abruptness of a foghorn comes a symphony of pentatonic sound, a 
song of greeting, alarm or awakening in five harmonizing pitches. The calls 
continue for perhaps five minutes. Then they end as suddenly as they began. 
</P>
<P>
All over Madagasgar, the Malagasy and foreign visitors alike have been 
discovering those hitherto-hidden qualities of the island's wildlife. But 
resistance to changing the old ways still thrives. 
</P>
<P>
Cambridge University's O'Connor was confronted by resistance just last year, 
after she and some colleagues emerged in their Land Rover from the depths of a 
forest preserve they were helping to chart. 
</P>
<P>
"We came across a huge plot on fire," she recalled. "Later, one of the 
villagers told us they had done it to display annoyance at our not having made 
contact with them before going into the forest. It may or may not have been 
true, but they never did cultivate it."

PRESSURE MOUNTS TO AVERT STRIKE BY L.A. TEACHERS 
</P>

<P>
Pressure mounted Friday for the Los Angeles Unified School District and its 
teachers to reach a contract settlement, or at least postpone a strike, as 
campuses struggled through a confusing last day of classes before a scheduled 
teacher walkout. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-area legislators and Parent-Teacher Assn. leaders called for 
'round-the-clock negotiations. In Sacramento, there was talk of how much 
additional state tax revenues would be available to increase the district's 
salary offer and what effect, if any, a strike would have on Gov. George 
Deukmejian's expected announcement of a revised budget next week. 
</P>
<P>
United Teachers-Los Angeles President Wayne Johnson, in an interview at his 
office, said he met Friday morning with two members of the school board and 
characterized the discussions as "positive and friendly" but stressed that 
there had been no breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
"Our communications are like a professional boxing match in the first round. We 
are sort of feeling each other out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson added that he hoped "the meetings might get us to a point where we feel 
we can make a deal and then make one." 
</P>
<P>
Negotiators were talking over the telephone Friday in discussions that were 
expected to last late into the night. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Jackie Goldberg, who showed up at a morning press conference by 
Democratic legislators, urged lawmakers to help free up additional state tax 
money. 
</P>
<P>
"Communication is going on very nicely," she said, referring to informal talks 
with the union. "The problem is whether we can agree." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, campuses throughout the nation's second-largest district were in a 
free-fall toward a Monday strike, with teachers packing up materials and some 
students skipping school. The district said it was beefing up police patrols 
and considering hiring off-duty officers from other local agencies in case of a 
walkout. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Fisher, the district's chief negotiator, stressed Friday that the district 
remains committed to using 60% of any new state monies to fulfill the current 
offer. The offer guarantees teachers 21.5% over three years -- 8% this year, 
5.5% in 1990 and 8% in 1991 -- and pledges to raise the second year to 8% if 
the district receives sufficient additional state funds. That would allow the 
district to offer a total raise of 24% over three years. 
</P>
<P>
Asked Friday night if the union would accept such a 24% offer, UTLA spokeswoman 
Catherine Carey said: "We don't speculate on trial balloons. We want an offer 
across the table in writing. . . . When it's offered at the table, we will 
consider it." 
</P>
<P>
The seven-member school board is reported badly divided on how quickly to make 
a new offer, and that was compounded by uncertainty about the size of the state 
surplus. On Friday, board members talked informally, clustering in groups of 
twos and threes in district headquarters hallways. Board President Roberta 
Weintraub said a closed meeting of the school board was scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
Several well-placed sources on legislative staffs and among Sacramento 
lobbyists Friday offered three scenarios for the use of what many expect will 
be a $750-million revenue surplus. The most optimistic scenario for a strike 
settlement is that the Legislature would allow all the provisions of 
Proposition 98 and the Gann spending limit to take effect, sending about $560 
million to schools and community colleges; under that, the Los Angeles district 
might receive $60 million, most of that with no strings attached. 
</P>
<P>
Another possibility will be offered next week by Democratic leaders. That would 
shift budget limits around, allowing only $300 million extra for schools, with 
$33.7 million going to Los Angeles, according to the experts. The Los Angeles 
share available for salaries could be much lower if legislators and the 
governor require that education funds go for school maintenance or textbook 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
"But the informal thinking is that most of it would be available for local 
districts to do what they want," said one legislative aide. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, an influential lobbyist stressed that there is much Republican hostility 
toward the overwhelmingly Democratic Los Angeles district and its teachers' 
union. 
</P>
<P>
The third option is that two-thirds of both houses of the Legislature and the 
governor move to suspend Proposition 98, the measure passed last fall by voters 
that guarantees much state funds for schools. A suspension could mean no extra 
monies for schools. 
</P>
<P>
The governor, who was in Los Angeles Friday, refused to comment on the surplus. 
He is expected to present his budget revisions by the end of next week. The 
Senate Budget Committee is expected to discuss the surplus Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
At their downtown press conference Friday, nine Democratic state lawmakers 
called for a settlement of the teachers' contract. Los Angeles Assemblywoman 
Maxine Waters warned that a walkout could put more students on the street and 
increase the risk of gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PTA Chides Both Sides 
</P>
<P>
While emphasizing their collective political clout, the lawmakers sidestepped 
questions about using that influence to help increase state funding for the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the uncertainty of how much money will be available, and the complexity 
of the legislative process, Waters said, "for us to commit on (future) dollars 
that will be available would be irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
During their own press conference, leaders of PTAs throughout the district 
echoed the call for negotiations and criticized both the union and the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that rancor has been building for many months, resulting in the 
current lack of trust between the parties. If a strike occurs, there will be no 
winners," the PTA announced. 
</P>
<P>
State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig, saying he has been in touch with 
both sides, called on the union to delay a strike until after a fact-finder's 
report and the governor's budget update are released next week. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance at some schools dropped as much as 15% Friday, with absent students 
apparently figuring little would be accomplished in the tense prestrike 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
Feelings of division grew between those teachers who are committed to a strike 
and those who say they will go to work Monday. Some faculty lounges were said 
to be as unpleasant Friday as border state households were on the eve of the 
Civil War, with sons heading to opposing armies. 
</P>
<P>
At Marshall High School in the Los Feliz-Silver Lake area, Principal Donald 
Hahn said about 600 students -- 50 more than usual -- were absent out of a 
total enrollment of 2,800. He estimated that only about 1,600 students would 
come to school if there is a strike. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect most of the seniors will come in because they want to ensure 
graduation," he said, adding that younger students have less at stake. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 students at Palms Junior High School walked out of classes for about 
an hour Friday to show support for teachers but also to express concern that 
many teachers have pledged not to file student grades next week. At Nightingale 
Junior High School near downtown Los Angeles, about 100 students left campus 
during a break Friday morning, but school officials persuaded most to return to 
class, Principal Jess Bojorquez said. 
</P>
<P>
Both district and union leaders expressed concern about possible violence on 
campuses next week if there is a strike. District police canceled all vacations 
and training programs and are placing officers on longer shifts as of this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers committed to a strike were also worried about finances because they 
could face weeks without pay during a lengthy walkout. To aid them, the 
teachers' credit union announced Friday that it would allow a moratorium on 
payments due on car and personal loans for the duration of a strike but that 
mortgage payments could not be postponed. 
</P>
<P>
During breaks Friday, teachers carried the last boxes full of personal 
belongings and teaching materials from classrooms to their cars. School-owned 
materials were tucked away in locked storage closets, and classroom bulletin 
boards were stripped of displays. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a hard day," said Adele Mallin, a drama teacher at Reed Junior 
High School in North Hollywood. "You don't know when you're saying goodby to 
these students whether you're going to ever see them again." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers who decide to work can earn extra pay by teaching additional classes, 
as well as by adding extra students to their regular classes, school officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
School principals and their staffs will schedule classes during the strike. The 
district has insisted that all schools remain open. Room keys were collected 
from teachers as they left school Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators at Huntington Park High School mailed letters to parents on 
Friday directing students to meet at various locations -- such as the 
cafeteria, library and gymnasium -- according to grade levels. 
</P>
<P>
Some students at Reed said they will wait until Monday before they decide 
whether to attend school during the strike. Reed eighth-grader Ethan Krupp, 14, 
said that if after a couple of days "all we are doing is watching movies in the 
auditorium, then I'm going to stay home." 
</P>
<P>
Krupp's classmate, Justin Schneiderman, 14, said he and his brother are already 
making plans to take Monday off. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be great," he said.

BUSH CALLS FOR SOVIET OPENNESS; 
</P>
<P>
URGES GORBACHEV TO TAKE SPECIFIC MOVES TO BETTER RELATIONS

President Bush, declaring that "a new breeze is blowing across the steppes and 
the cities of the Soviet Union," challenged Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev on Friday to make concrete moves now toward a new openness with the 
West, including Kremlin agreement on allowing unarmed spy planes to fly over 
the countries of the Eastern and Western alliances. 
</P>
<P>
In his first major speech on the Administration's view of relations with the 
Soviet Union, Bush expressed encouragement -- tempered with caution -- about 
the prospects for greater cooperation between the superpowers. 
</P>
<P>
He unveiled a series of tit-for-tat proposals intended to push the Kremlin 
toward a more open society, matched by reciprocal gestures from the United 
States, following much the same course as former President Ronald Reagan did. 
</P>
<P>
"A new relationship cannot be simply declared by Moscow or bestowed by others," 
the President said in a commencement address at Texas A&amp;M University. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Promises Not Enough 
</P>
<P>
Specific deeds are now necessary, he said, because "promises are never enough." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's address summed up the results of a four-month Administration review of 
the U.S.-Soviet relationship. It provided the first pronouncement of policy on 
the East Bloc and offered a framework for future proposals as well as a 
counterpoint for recent Soviet overtures on arms reductions. 
</P>
<P>
Sounding a note of wariness about the true depth of the reforms sweeping the 
Soviet Union, Bush said: "The Soviet Union has promised a more cooperative 
relationship before, only to reverse course and return to militarism. Soviet 
foreign policy has been almost seasonal -- warmth before cold, thaw before 
freeze." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Chill of Distrust' 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, he said, "We seek a friendship that knows no season of 
suspicion, no chill of distrust." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the steps Bush proposed are already being undertaken to some degree by 
Moscow or have been promised as the Soviet Union undergoes the political 
openings of Gorbachev's glasnost campaign and perestroika, the economic 
restructuring of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
In the address, Bush called on the Soviets to: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reduce their military forces. In December, Gorbachev announced a 10% cut in 
Soviet armed forces personnel, and on Thursday he told Secretary of State James 
A. Baker III in Moscow that he would remove 500 nuclear warheads from Eastern 
Europe. Bush said that the Warsaw Pact has more than 30,000 tanks, more than 
twice the artillery of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization nations and 
hundreds of thousands more troops. "They should cut their forces to less 
threatening levels," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Allow self-determination for all the nations of Central and Eastern Europe. 
In a symbolic move, a section of barbed wire on Hungary's border with Austria 
was torn down by Hungarian troops earlier this month. "One day it should be 
possible to drive from Moscow to Munich without seeing a single guard tower or 
a strand of barbed wire. In short, tear down the Iron Curtain," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Work with the West "in positive, practical -- not merely rhetorical -- 
steps" toward resolving regional disputes. The Soviets have withdrawn troops -- 
but not military supplies -- from Afghanistan and worked with the United States 
to oversee an agreement to withdraw Cuban troops from Angola. While saluting 
such efforts, Bush said, "there is much more to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Establish lasting political pluralism and respect for human rights in the 
Soviet Union. Praising the "limited, but freely contested, elections" and the 
"greater toleration of dissent" there, Bush said: "Mr. Gorbachev, don't stop 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Join the United States in fighting environmental problems and "the 
international drug menace." 
</P>
<P>
The President's proposals reflected an effort to join more aggressively in the 
battle for international favor between Moscow and Washington. In recent months, 
Gorbachev has served up one proposal after another for wider cooperation and a 
reduced military threat, while Bush has held back and awaited completion of 
in-depth studies of the United States' relations around the world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Idea Raised by Eisenhower 
</P>
<P>
The President's proposal to open the skies of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact 
nations, as well as those of NATO members, to surveillance flights reached back 
to an idea posed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1955. It was rejected at 
that time by the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"Let us again explore that proposal," Bush said. ". . . Such unprecedented 
territorial access would show the world the true meaning of the concept of 
openness. The very Soviet willingness to embrace such a concept would reveal 
their commitment to change." 
</P>
<P>
He said that the flights "would provide regular scrutiny for both sides." 
</P>
<P>
But Administration officials, including retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Brent 
Scowcroft, the President's assistant for national security affairs, and a 
senior Pentagon official described such a move as primarily symbolic. 
</P>
<P>
Spy satellites already provide virtually all of the intelligence that such 
overflights would offer, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The White House said that the idea has not been explored in detail with the 
NATO allies. Scowcroft indicated that it has been presented to the Soviets, who 
have not yet responded. 
</P>
<P>
In seeking greater U.S.-Soviet economic cooperation, Bush offered a broader 
trade relationship, which he said in the past was "stifled by Soviet internal 
policies" and efforts to steal Western technology under "the cloak of 
commerce." 
</P>
<P>
He said that he would work with Congress to temporarily lift a 1974 U.S. trade 
sanction denying special benefits to the Soviet Union if that nation codifies 
and enforces its emigration laws to guarantee that citizens seeking to leave 
can do so. 
</P>
<P>
The Jackson-Vanik Amendment denied the Soviet Union "most-favored-nation" 
status, which would give it the same trade preferences and tariff concessions 
that the United States extends to most major trading partners. 
</P>
<P>
A White House official, noting a recent upsurge in Soviet emigration, said that 
departures had reached 87,000 in 1988, including 19,000 Jews, and that in the 
first three months of this year, Soviet citizens were being allowed to emigrate 
at the rate of 9,700 a month -- a rate well above last year's. In the peak 
year, 1971, 51,000 Jews were allowed to leave, a White House official said. 
</P>
<P>
While much of the U.S.-Soviet relationship has been built on arms control, 
there were no new proposals from Bush in this field. 
</P>
<P>
But Scowcroft, speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One as Bush flew here 
from Washington, was critical of Gorbachev's proposal to remove 500 nuclear 
warheads from Europe. He said that the offer was "designed principally to 
create problems" within the Atlantic Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was made as NATO leaders are about to gather at a 40th anniversary 
summit at the end of the month, torn by a West German proposal to move toward 
speedy negotiations with the Warsaw Pact to limit short-range nuclear forces in 
Europe. The United States objects to such a plan out of concern that it would 
leave the West at a disadvantage in the military balance because of the Soviet 
Bloc's superior conventional forces. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on the impact that the changes in the Soviet Union have had on NATO, 
Scowcroft said: "The glue which has held the alliance together . . . has been 
the kind of overwhelming threat from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"Now as the perception of that threat diminishes, then the glue tends not to be 
there, and what we need to do is to replace it by a sense of mission for the 
alliance itself for the future," he said.

The President's speech was the first of three commencement addresses he is 
giving this weekend. He is scheduled to deliver two more speeches in 
Mississippi today. And, leading up to the NATO summit in Brussels on May 29-30, 
he will speak on additional foreign policy subjects at Boston University and 
the Coast Guard Academy over the next two weeks.

ECCLESIA FOUR GUILTY IN FATAL BEATING OF GIRL

<TEXT>
<P>
Four members of the Los Angeles-based Ecclesia Athletic Assn., a 
quasi-religious group formed to shepherd children away from inner-city strife, 
were found guilty Friday of manslaughter in the beating death of the 8-year-old 
daughter of the group's founder and spiritual leader. 
</P>
<P>
After 11 hours of deliberation, the jury voted 10 to 2 to deliver the harshest 
verdict possible in the case, which has been a source of fascination in this 
small Oregon mill town for several months. Unlike California, Oregon does not 
require unanimous verdicts in criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants -- Willie Chambers, 35; Constance Jackson, 39; Frederick 
Doolittle, 28, and Brian Brinson, 31 -- face maximum prison terms of 20 years 
each. 
</P>
<P>
They had been accused of beating Danya Broussard to death seven month ago at a 
farmhouse maintained by Ecclesia. Evidence showed that the beating had been 
conducted in front of other children in the group after consultation by 
telephone with the child's father. Testimony indicated that Eldridge Broussard 
Jr. thought his daughter should be punished after she stole a vegetable from 
another child's plate and then bit Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
"I was convinced that basically they were good people, good people who went 
wrong," said juror Marilyn Simonsen, a retired nurse who voted with the 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
Clackamas County Circuit Judge John Lowe read the verdict without comment. 
</P>
<P>
As the verdict was read, Jackson began to sob. Afterward, Brinson and Chambers 
shook the prosecutor's hand, and the four were led away in handcuffs. Their 
attorneys said the decision will be appealed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very emotional case involving the beating death of a child," said 
defense attorney Tim Lyons. "It's hard to be objective." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wanted Lesser Charge 
</P>
<P>
The two jurors who voted in the minority wanted to convict on a lesser charge 
that would have required only five-year sentences, one of them said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision marks a climactic chapter in a story that has captivated this 
largely white, rural county for seven months, ever since members of the mostly 
black group from South-Central Los Angeles arrived at a fire station here with 
Dayna's battered body. 
</P>
<P>
The verdicts do not, however, end Ecclesia's legal morass in Oregon. Jackson 
and three other women in the group still face charges of criminal mistreatment 
in the alleged beatings of other Ecclesia children. 
</P>
<P>
And juvenile proceedings are continuing in the cases of 53 Ecclesia children 
who were placed in foster care in the wake of Dayna's death. Oregon authorities 
are seeking long-term, although not permanent, custody of those children, whose 
parents are, for the most part, sticking by Broussard. 
</P>
<P>
Before coming to Oregon, the children, along with their parents, had lived for 
more than a decade in a converted bakery on Avalon Boulevard in South-Central 
Los Angeles. Their life style was communal -- they call themselves an extended 
family -- with shared finances, meals and child-rearing duties. 
</P>
<P>
Ecclesia's dream of helping black children out of the ghetto through a strict 
regimen of religion, discipline and athletics was a persistent theme throughout 
the manslaughter trial, in which nine children, aged 6 to 14, were the state's 
star witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
In voices so tiny that prosecutor Alfred French repeatedly asked them to speak 
up, the children described how they gathered in the garage of their farmhouse 
to watch the defendants discipline Dayna -- who was described as a 
strong-willed, stubborn child -- for stealing a piece of zucchini from another 
child's plate and then biting Jackson, who had tried to punish her. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution charged that Dayna was struck more than 500 times with a 
variety of instuments -- among them a rubber hose, a braided electrical cord, a 
bamboo stick, a weight belt and a PVC pipe -- and then draped over a window 
when she complained she could not breathe. 
</P>
<P>
"She tried to tell Willie (Chambers) how she couldn't breathe," 14-year-old Joe 
Williams testified, "but Brian (Brinson) wouldn't let her tell, and he kept 
holding her arms and her head down to the floor. . . . She said she couldn't 
breathe real softly. She kept on saying it, and then Willie grabbed her and 
just put her out the window." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Put Her on Floor 
</P>
<P>
After the child was removed from the window, the Williams boy told the jury, 
the defendants placed her on the floor directly in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
"She just took two last breaths, two last breaths, and her eyes rolled back, 
and after that, I guess Brian noticed it because he rushed over there, and he 
picked her up, and I just seen -- I just seen them take Dayna out of the room, 
and that was it." 
</P>
<P>
During closing arguments and throughout the trial, defense lawyers -- and 
Chambers and Brinson, both of whom testified -- maintained that the children's 
statements were exaggerated and that much of the discipline was actually 
theatrics, with Chambers striking the floor rather than Dayna in an attempt to 
frighten the other children into behaving. 
</P>
<P>
The four criminal lawyers also argued that the defendants made several attempts 
to help Dayna, including checking her breathing and taking her to the fire 
station. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, the defense lawyers also introduced an independent autopsy in 
an effort to persuade the jury that Dayna died, not from the beating, but from 
being draped over the window -- an act they said was intended to help the child 
by giving her some air. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dismisses Theory 
</P>
<P>
But in his closing and rebuttal arguments before the jury Thursday, prosecutor 
French dismissed that theory. "Hanging that child out the window was not an act 
of compassion. . . ," French said. "Ladies and gentlemen, that's what you do 
with a carpet. That's not what you do with a badly injured little child." 
</P>
<P>
As to the cause of Dayna's death, French told the jury: "Your own common sense 
tells you that she was beaten to death. She walked into that room of her own 
ability and she was carried out dead. She didn't die of any strange disease or 
unknown causes. She was beat to death, and that's all there is to it." 
</P>
<P>
Although Broussard was in Los Angeles at the time of his daughter's death, 
there was testimony during the trial that he gave the defendants permission to 
discipline Dayna. In an unusual twist for the father of a victim, he has 
remained in the defendants' camp.

STATE CASH SEEN AS LAST HOPE TO AVERT TEACHERS' STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

As teachers packed up materials and some students skipped school, leaders of 
both the teachers' union and the Los Angeles Unified School District held out 
hope Friday for a last-minute contract settlement based on an infusion of 
additional money from the state. 
</P>
<P>
Campuses throughout the district struggled through a confusing last day of 
classes before a scheduled teachers' strike, as pressure grew for a settlement 
-- or at least a postponement of the Monday walkout. Los Angeles-area 
legislators and PTA leaders called for round-the-clock negotiations. In 
Sacramento, there was much talk of how a strike could influence Gov. George 
Deukmejian's expected announcement of a revised budget next week and Democratic 
plans for the state tax revenue surplus. 
</P>
<P>
United Teachers-Los Angeles President Wayne Johnson, in an interview at his 
office, said he met Friday morning with two members of the school board and 
characterized the discussions as "positive and friendly" but stressed that 
there had been no breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
"Our communications are like a professional boxing match in the first round. We 
are sort of feeling each other out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson added that he hoped "the meetings might get us to a point where we feel 
we can make a deal and then make one." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Good Communication 
</P>
<P>
Board member Jackie Goldberg, who showed up at a morning press conference by 
Democratic legislators, urged lawmakers to help free up additional money. 
"Communication is going on very nicely," she said, referring to informal talks 
with the union. "The problem is whether we can agree." 
</P>
<P>
Dick Fisher, the district's chief negotiator, stressed Friday that the district 
is committed to using 60% of any new state monies to fulfill the current offer. 
He said the offer guarantees teachers 21.5% over three years -- 8% this year, 
5.5% in 1990 and 8% in 1991 -- and pledges to raise the second year to 8% if 
the district receives sufficient additional state funds. That would allow the 
district to offer a total raise of 24% over three years. 
</P>
<P>
But Fisher said a stumbling block is the union's reluctance to agree to a 
settlement based on the contingency of the state funds. "If those funds occur, 
it gives the contingent part of our offer more hope," he said. "We see no 
possibility of the board going beyond" a 24%, three-year increase. 
</P>
<P>
The seven-member school board is reported to be badly divided on how quickly to 
make a new offer, and that was compounded by uncertainty about the size of the 
state surplus. On Friday, board members talked informally, clustering in groups 
of twos and threes, in district headquarters hallways. Board President Roberta 
Weintraub said that a closed meeting of the school board was scheduled for 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Several well-placed sources on legislative staffs and among Sacramento 
lobbyists on Friday offered three scenarios for the use of what many expect 
will be a $750-million revenue surplus. The most optimistic scenario for a 
strike settlement is that the Legislature will allow all the provisions of 
Proposition 98 and the Gann spending limit to take effect, sending about $560 
million to schools and community colleges; under that, the Los Angeles district 
might receive $60 million, most of that with no strings attached. 
</P>
<P>
Another possibility will be offered next week by Democratic leaders. That will 
shift budget limits around, allowing only $300 million extra for schools, with 
$33.7 million going to Los Angeles, according to the experts. The Los Angeles 
share available for salaries could be much lower if legislators and the 
governor require that education funds go for school maintenance or textbook 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
"But the informal thinking is that most of it would be available for local 
districts to do what they want," said one legislative aide. Yet an influential 
lobbyist stressed that there is much Republican hostility toward the 
overwhelmingly Democratic Los Angeles district and its teachers' union. 
</P>
<P>
The third option is that two-thirds of both houses of the Legislature, and the 
governor, move to suspend Proposition 98, the measure passed last fall by 
voters that guarantees much state funds for schools. A suspension could mean no 
extra monies for schools. "The big question mark on this is where the governor 
is," another source said. 
</P>
<P>
The governor, who was in Los Angeles Friday, refused to comment on the surplus. 
He is expected to present his budget revisions by the end of the week. The 
Senate Budget Committee is expected to discuss this Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
At their downtown press conference Friday, nine Democratic state lawmakers 
called for pressure on the school board and the teachers to settle without a 
strike. Los Angeles Assemblywoman Maxine Waters warned that a walkout could put 
more students on the street and increase the risks of gang violence. While not 
taking sides, Sepulveda Assemblyman Richard Katz hinted that the Los Angeles 
school system could have trouble getting funding and programs through the 
Legislature if a strike occurs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PTA Chides Both Sides 
</P>
<P>
While emphasizing their collective political clout, the lawmakers sidestepped 
questions about using that influence to help increase state funding for the 
district so the board can boost its pay offer. Citing the uncertainty of how 
much money will be available, and the complexity of the legislative process, 
Waters said, "for us to commit on (future) dollars that will be available would 
be irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
During their own press conference, leaders of Parent-Teacher Assns. around the 
district echoed that call for negotiations and criticized both the union and 
the district. "It is clear that rancor has been building for many months, 
resulting in the current lack of trust between the parties. If a strike occurs, 
there will be no winners," the PTA announced. 
</P>
<P>
State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig, saying he has been in touch with 
both sides, called on the union to delay a strike until after the fact finder's 
report comes out on Wednesday and the governor's update on state revenues is 
released next Friday. "If there is an offer on the table that's substantial and 
there is a chance of more money, it seems to me that (a strike) is not a 
responsible action." 
</P>
<P>
Attendance at some schools dropped as much as 15% Friday, with absent students 
figuring that little would be accomplished in the tense pre-strike situation. 
Feelings of division grew between those teachers who are committed to a strike 
and those who say they will go to work on Monday. Some faculty lounges were 
said to be as unpleasant Friday as border state households were on the eve of 
the Civil War with different sons heading to opposing armies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Seniors Expected 
</P>
<P>
At Marshall High School in the Los Feliz-Silver Lake area, Principal Donald 
Hahn said that about 600 students -- 50 more than usual -- were absent out of a 
total enrollment of 2,800. He estimated that, if there is a strike on Monday, 
only about 1,600 students would come to school. "I expect most of the seniors 
will come in because they want to ensure graduation," he said. But younger 
students have less at stake, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 students at Palms Junior High School walked out of classes for about 
an hour Friday to show support for teachers but also to express concern that 
striking teachers pledged not to file student grades next week. Principal 
Minnie Floyd described the rally as "extremely orderly." 
</P>
<P>
At Nightingale Junior High School near downtown Los Angeles, about 100 students 
left campus during a break Friday morning, but school officials persuaded most 
to return to class, Principal Jess Bojorquez said. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody mentioned anything about the strike but there's a lot of anxiety and 
uncertainty going on," Bojorquez said. 
</P>
<P>
Both district and union leaders expressed concern about possible violence on 
campuses next week if there is a strike. District police canceled all vacations 
and training programs and are placing officers on longer shifts as of this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers committed to a strike were also reviewing their finances, as they 
could face weeks without pay during a lengthy walkout. To aid them, the 
teachers' credit union announced Friday that it would allow a moratorium on 
payments due on car and personal loans for the duration of a strike but that 
mortgage payments could not be postponed. 
</P>
<P>
During breaks Friday, teachers carried the last boxes full of personal 
belongings and teaching materials from classrooms to their cars. School-owned 
materials were tucked away in locked storage closets, and classroom bulletin 
boards were stripped of their construction paper displays. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a hard day," said Adele Mallin, a drama teacher at Reed Junior 
High School in North Hollywood. "You don't know when you're saying goodby to 
these students whether you're going to ever see them again." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers who decide to work can earn as much as three and four extra hours 
worth of pay each day of the strike by teaching extra class periods, as well as 
for admitting extra students to their regular classes, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The job of scheduling and operating classes during the strike will rest with 
individual school principals and their administrative staffs. The district has 
insisted, however, that all schools remain open. Room keys were collected from 
teachers as they left school Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators at Huntington Park High School mailed letters to parents on 
Friday, directing students to meet at various locations -- such as the 
cafeteria, library and gymnasium -- according to grade levels.

$100-MILLION SETTLEMENT OKD IN PUERTO RICO HOTEL BLAZE

A federal judge on Friday accepted the proposed payment of up to $100 million 
to settle hundreds of lawsuits stemming from the 1986 Dupont Plaza Hotel fire 
that killed 97 people. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Court Judge Raymond L. Acosta said the agreement was binding on 
all parties but contingent on unspecified conditions being met within 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
Agreement in the case, involving about 2,300 plaintiffs seeking damages from 
230 defendants, was approved Thursday night in Philadelphia by District Judge 
Louis C. Bechtle, who was appointed by U.S. Supreme Court Justice William H. 
Rehnquist to head the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed in Philadelphia, $50 million will be paid by the 
insurer, American International Underwriters Corp., and $35 million by the 
Dupont-family group of partnerships and individuals who owned many hotel 
enterprises, including the Dupont Plaza. Other insurance carriers will pay the 
remaining $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
The fire on Dec. 31, 1986, killed 97 people and injured more than 140. It 
occurred during bitter labor negotiations between the Teamsters Union and hotel 
management. Three former employees who were union members were accused of 
setting the fire and were convicted in 1987 of murder.

Israel, for the fourth year in a row, asked the United States on Friday for $3 
billion in yearly aid, and U.S. Ambassador William Brown said he is confident 
it will be granted without political conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Shimon Peres asked for the aid at a meeting with Brown. Israel 
receives the largest amount of U.S. foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he does not think the Bush Administration or Congress will use aid 
as a lever to force Israeli concessions in response to the Palestinian uprising 
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. He also said the request will 
probably be approved despite efforts to cut the giant U.S. budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic, fundamental sentiment . . . remains of staunch, unswerving support 
for Israel and an appreciation of its security needs," Brown told Israel Radio. 
</P>
<P>
Peres expressed confidence that the request will be granted and said a peace 
settlement might someday reduce the need for aid.

CHINESE MUSLIMS PROTEST 'SEX HABITS' BOOK 
</P>

About 2,500 Chinese Muslims chanting "Punish China's Rushdie!" marched through 
Beijing on Friday demanding that two editors be imprisoned for publishing a 
book that purportedly describes the sexual habits of Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
"These men must be jailed," said Li Jing, a Uighur Turk from the Central 
Academy of Nationalities and a leader of the protest. "If they disappeared from 
the face of the earth, we would be happy." 
</P>
<P>
The protest came a day after Iranian President Ali Khamenei told a news 
conference in Beijing that Iran still demands the execution of British author 
Salman Rushie, who is accused of blaspheming the Islamic religion in his book, 
"The Satanic Verses." 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese book in question is called "Sex Habits," a compilation of essays on 
the sexual tastes of people around the world. 
</P>
<P>
The section on Islam says that the purpose of a Muslim's pilgrimage to Mecca is 
to engage in bestiality. It said the domes and towers of Muslim mosques 
symbolize human sex organs. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusually early report by Chinese standards, Beijing's afternoon 
newspaper, the Beijing Evening News, reported the demonstration. It also said 
the book had been banned in Beijing "because it has hurt the unity of China's 
minorities." 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration, which included students from eight school and 13 minority 
groups, twisted through the streets of Beijing's Muslim quarter to the Niujie 
Mosque, Bejing's oldest. 
</P>
<P>
Mullahs at the temple set out tea for the marchers and police directed traffic 
out of their path. The demonstration was the first in more than three weeks of 
student protests in Beijing to be given official approval. Earlier protests 
have called for a free press and democracy. 
</P>
<P>
The book's editors, apparently teachers from Shanxi province, wrote under pen 
names. 
</P>
<P>
The book has sold rapidly since it was published by the Shanghai Cultural 
Publishing Co. in March. Sources said that in early May, the Shanghai city 
government stopped a second printing of the book, which had already sold 50,000 
copies. 
</P>
<P>
City officials also are trying to recall the book, offering three times its 
official price of 94 cents, but to no avail, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"The black market price has already hit 50 yuan ($13.50)," said one Chinese 
journalist.

REJECTION OF PURGE BASIS FOR ITO'S DECISION; 
</P>
<P>
REPORTEDLY ASKED JAPAN'S SCANDAL-TAINTED PARTY CHIEFS TO QUIT

Masayoshi Ito made it clear Friday that his decision to turn down his party's 
offer to succeed Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita stemmed from 
rejection of his demand for a purge of all leaders of the party. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about reports of his demand that all party leaders tainted by the Recruit 
influence and bribery scandal resign their seats in Parliament, Ito said: 
"Today, I won't say anything about that. I have made my ideas known to 
(Takeshita and ruling party Secretary General Shintaro Abe) . . . and there was 
a discrepancy in my opinion from theirs." 
</P>
<P>
Ito indicated that he was prepared to resign his own seat, but said only, 
"Right now, here, I cannot comment." 
</P>
<P>
At a Thursday meeting with Takeshita, Ito was reported to have told the prime 
minister: "It is a terrible thing to say, but if I succeeded you, my 
administration would become one sustained by Takeshita, (former Prime Minister 
Yasuhiro) Nakasone, (former Finance Minister Kiichi) Miyazawa, and Abe, all of 
whom are linked to (the) Recruit (scandal). People would say Ito is the same 
(as the others)." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Party 
</P>
<P>
Those four leaders head the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's major factions, 
which dispense political funds and party, Cabinet and Parliament posts to their 
followers in exchange for unquestioned loyalty and support. All four received 
favors from Recruit Co., an information-real estate conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
Ito demanded that the factions be disbanded and leadership turned over to a 
younger generation. 
</P>
<P>
He also demanded the resignation from Parliament of Michio Watanabe, who, as 
chairman of the ruling party's Policy Board, ranks among the top leadership. 
He, too, received favors from Recruit Co. 
</P>
<P>
Ito, chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's executive board, informed party 
Secretary General Abe of his decision a day after he presented his purge demand 
to Takeshita. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Willing to Resign 
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, who received more than $1.5 million in stock profits, 
political contributions and a loan from Recruit, told Ito that he would be 
willing to resign his own seat in Parliament. But Takeshita said that asking 
the others to quit, even if only until the next election for the powerful lower 
house of Parliament, was impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Ito has said that "it's not enough to change the cover of the book. The 
contents must be changed, too. A revolution in consciousness is needed." 
</P>
<P>
Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Liberal Democrats' deputy secretary general, told 
reporters that Ito cited his health and the party's "inability to reach a 
conclusion to the Recruit scandal" as reasons for rejecting the offer. He said 
the party's top executives, including Ito, would meet again today. 
</P>
<P>
Barring unlikely announcements by Takeshita, Nakasone, Miyazawa, Abe and 
Watanabe of their intent to give up their seats in Parliament, no change was 
expected in Ito's decision. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Ill Health 
</P>
<P>
Ever since Takeshita announced April 25 that he would resign after the fiscal 
1989 budget is enacted to assume responsibility for the scandal, Ito, 75, who 
suffers from diabetes, has said he did not want to become Japan's top leader. 
</P>
<P>
But Thursday night he told Takeshita that if he were to accept the post despite 
his health concerns, he would insist on guarantees that the Recruit scandal be 
"concluded" by his proposed purge and other reforms. 
</P>
<P>
His rejection of the party's and the nation's highest post threw the ruling 
party into what one political commentator called "anarchy," facing an election 
for the upper house of Parliament in July or August with no obvious leader to 
succeed Takeshita. 
</P>
<P>
Although his reputation as a "Mr. Clean" had won him nearly unanimous backing 
to succeed Takeshita as premier, Ito, a former foreign minister, is a 
second-echelon politician with no personal following -- or power -- of his own. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Third Echelon of Leaders 
</P>
<P>
His departure from the picture left the party the unwelcome prospect of having 
to dip into a third echelon of leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The party's choices include turning to aging leaders with little remaining 
influence or picking a new leader from younger politicians. Two of the younger 
group, however, also have been tainted by the Recruit scandal and all of them 
are a generation younger than the party's strongmen. Like the aging statesmen, 
they exercise no political power in their own right. 
</P>
<P>
Masaharu Gotoda, 74, chairman of a ruling party reform committee, whose name 
was mentioned as a dark horse when Takeshita announced his intention to resign, 
emerged again as a possibility among the older group. 
</P>
<P>
Also named as a man who has no enemies -- but also no influence -- was Michita 
Sakata, 72, a former Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
If the party loses its majority in the House of Councilors election, it could 
be forced to form a coalition with one or more of Japan's four opposition 
parties. Except for the budget and treaties, bills rejected by the upper house 
can be enacted only by a two-thirds vote in the lower house, where the Liberal 
Democrats now hold 58% of the seats. 
</P>
<P>
The scandal broke into the open last July with disclosures that Recruit Co. 
handed over unlisted stocks in one of its subsidiaries, Recruit Cosmos Co., at 
cut-rate prices to 168 selected politicians, businessmen, bureaucrats and 
journalists. When the stocks were put on the market, their price shot up, 
allowing the privileged owners to reap windfall tax-exempt profits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unpopular Tax 
</P>
<P>
Passage of a 3% consumption tax, which went into effect April 1, in the midst 
of the scandal, exacerbated public disapproval by creating an image of 
politicians stuffing their own pockets while imposing a new burden on 
taxpayers. An intensive mass media campaign, moreover, has lumped all links 
with Recruit Co., including legal political contributions, into the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve businessmen and two former bureaucrats have been arrested and indicted 
for bribery and other charges.

U.S. STANCE AGAINST NORIEGA WINS BACKING BY 11 NATIONS; OAS TO MEET

<P>
The Bush Administration claimed an early advantage Friday in its contest with 
Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega for international diplomatic support. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, the Pentagon said newly arrived U.S. troops will travel in 
armed convoys on Panama's highways with orders to defend themselves if 
attacked. 
</P>
<P>
White House National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft said the Administration 
is content for the time being to follow the strategy of diplomatic and military 
pressure that President Bush announced Thursday after Noriega's regime 
nullified Sunday's disputed election. 
</P>
<P>
However, Scowcroft said other steps might be tried later if Noriega retains his 
grip on power. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Situation Under Review' 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of things that we could do," Scowcroft told reporters aboard 
Bush's Air Force One on a flight to College Station, Tex., where the President 
the commencement address as Texas A&amp;M. "We will have the whole situation 
under review constantly. There are more options that one could consider. . . . 
We've looked over the range of things, and we've picked a package we think 
suits the situation." 
</P>
<P>
The State Department said that at least 11 nations and two multinational 
organizations have condemned Noriega for attempting to steal the election in 
favor of his preferred candidate. Noriega, who heads the Panama Defense Forces, 
is his nation's de facto ruler. 
</P>
<P>
In perhaps the most telling diplomatic event, Japan issued a statement 
denouncing irregularities in Sunday's presidential election and the ensuing 
violent attacks on opposition political leaders. Japan, which is Panama's most 
significant trading partner, had never before publicly criticized the Noriega 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese Ambassador Jumpei Kato delivered a note to opposition presidential 
candidate Guillermo Endara that described the regime's actions as "inadmissible 
in a civilized society." 
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, the Organization of American States approved an American-backed 
proposal for an emergency foreign ministers' meeting next week to consider the 
implications of the election and its violent aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said: "Foreign reaction continues to 
strongly condemn developments in Panama. Peru has issued a second statement 
condemning the annulment of the elections. . . . President Oscar Arias 
(Sanchez) of Costa Rica has said the Panamanian people were betrayed. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"By latest count, I note 11 individual countries, in addition to the United 
States, have issued individual statements. In addition, Colombia made a 
statement on behalf of the Group of Eight (Latin American nations), and the 
European Community's 12 nations have issued a statement." 
</P>
<P>
As the vanguard of nearly 1,900 new U.S. troops began to arrive in Panama, 
Richard L. Armitage, acting assistant defense secretary for international 
security affairs, said the soldiers and Marines will not engage in provocative 
action but will not be confined to U.S. military bases, either. 
</P>
<P>
"If (American troops) have to get from Point A to Point B, they'll do so in 
military fashion, without straggling," said Armitage, the Administration's 
nominee for Army secretary. "These guys won't be looking for trouble or causing 
trouble. But if the PDF (Panama Defense Forces) causes trouble, these forces 
are the best suited to respond. 
</P>
<P>
"If Noriega or his thugs are pestering or hurting American citizens, these 
forces will be there to go out and clean up the situation," he added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Carrier in Atlantic 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the aircraft carrier America steamed in the Atlantic less than 500 
miles off the East Coast. The ship, which left its home port of Norfolk, Va., 
on Thursday, is bound for the Indian Ocean, but officials have stressed that it 
could be diverted to Panama on short notice as long as it remains in the 
Western Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
The America carries a total of 40 planes capable of bombing strikes, as well as 
helicopters and planes that could be used to evacuate American civilians. 
</P>
<P>
In Panama, Noriega reacted with defiance. But there were persistent rumors that 
he will ultimately accept asylum, perhaps in Spain, in exchange for his 
departure from Panama. Asked if the United States has discussed such a deal 
with Spanish authorities, Scowcroft said after a long pause: "I don't want to 
get into specifics, but we have been talking to a number of our allies." 
</P>
<P>
Noriega rejected just such a deal last year because U.S. negotiators refused to 
promise to dismiss drug charges that are pending against him in Florida. Bush 
said Thursday that the indictments will not be dismissed, although he hinted at 
a possible compromise during his press conference, saying, "But look, I will be 
open-minded about seeing what it might take to see him leave." 
</P>
<P>
Boucher said half the staff at the U.S. Embassy in Panama City has been brought 
home and that all remaining staff members and their families have moved into 
secure housing on U.S. military bases. He said the U.S. government is urging 
Americans to avoid travel to Panama and advising Americans traveling on ships 
through the Panama Canal to remain aboard their vessels at all times. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Serious Crisis' 
</P>
<P>
In unanimously approving a Venezuelan-backed resolution, the 31 member nations 
of the Organization of American States called for a foreign ministers' meeting 
Wednesday to debate the "serious crisis in Panama in its international 
context." 
</P>
<P>
Panamanian representative Carlos Russell, backed by Nicaragua, voted for the 
debate, although he said the organization should consider the issue of U.S. 
"intervention" in Sunday's election through clandestine funding of the 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Other delegates openly attacked the Noriega regime. For instance, Jamaica's 
ambassador, Keith Johnson, declared, "The world has witnessed an absolute 
betrayal of the democratic rights of the Panamanian people . . . a blatant rape 
of democracy." 
</P>
<P>
Boucher refused to say what the OAS -- which has no enforcement powers -- could 
accomplish. But, he said, "We believe it's very critical for the OAS to speak 
out in one voice in support of the democratic aspirations of the Panamanian 
people." 
</P>

College Station, contributed to this story.

BOTHA HEIR-APPARENT VOWS DRASTIC S. AFRICA CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Frederik W. de Klerk, the man expected to be South Africa's next president, 
unofficially opened the nation's general election campaign Friday by declaring 
his party "totally opposed" to white minority rule as well as black majority 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk, leader of the ruling white National Party, said in a speech to the 
white chamber of Parliament that he is seeking drastic changes in South 
Africa's political system. But he gave no details. 
</P>
<P>
The speech represented De Klerk's first major policy address since President 
Pieter W. Botha set Sept. 6 for parliamentary elections and indicated he would 
then retire after 11 years at the helm of the white minority-led government. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk, 53, the minister of education, was effectively designated as the next 
president when he was elected party leader in February to replace Botha, who 
had suffered a stroke and stepped down from the party post. The National Party, 
which has controlled the government for 40 years, is heavily favored in the 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
Although little is known about De Klerk's plans for the country, he is viewed 
by some political analysts as more likely to pursue the apartheid reforms begun 
by Botha but allowed to rust in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Other analysts think that De Klerk, while more willing to compromise with the 
government's opponents than is the autocratic Botha, will focus his attention 
on protecting the interests of the white minority. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk's speech Friday set out a middle road for the National Party in the 
forthcoming elections by criticizing both its principal white challengers -- 
the right-wing Conservative Party, the official opposition in Parliament, and 
the anti-apartheid Democratic Party, formed recently by the merger of the 
Progressive Federal Party and two smaller parties. 
</P>
<P>
"You dare not destroy your future by chasing after leftist and rightist 
dreams," De Klerk told white voters. Then, in a remark directed at conservative 
whites, he added: "The National Party is the only party not running away from 
reality. The present situation cannot last indefinitely. Things will have to 
change drastically and quickly." 
</P>
<P>
He said he envisions a system of government in which decisions are made by 
consensus and disputes settled by "a fair referee." More specific plans for the 
future would have to wait until after the election, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The country's black majority, which accounts for about 75% of the population, 
has no vote in national affairs. Asians and mixed-race Coloreds have their own 
subordinate chambers in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Minorities Not Protected 
</P>
<P>
The National Party has in the past said it supports limited black participation 
in national government. But party leaders oppose the one-person, one-vote 
system, contending that it provides no protection for minorities and would 
allow blacks to dominate whites. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk did not stray from that position Friday. On the one hand, he said: 
"White domination, as the Conservative Party calls for, leads inescapably to 
catastrophe . . . conflict and revolution. White security can never be built on 
injustice toward others." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he said, the liberal white Democratic Party's support for a 
one-person, one-vote system "would inevitably lead to majority rule and (black) 
domination . . . and is therefore totally unacceptable." He called the 
Democratic Party's platform "an unattainable non-racial Utopia." 
</P>
<P>
In the past week, two of Botha's Cabinet ministers, both provincial National 
Party leaders, have announced plans to resign. One is Chris Heunis, architect 
of the five-year-old tricameral Parliament and leader of the government's 
mostly unsuccessful effort to undertake talks with black leaders respected by 
the black masses. 
</P>
<P>
Both Heunis and Stoffel Botha, who resigned as minister of home affairs, said 
they were leaving politics for personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
But Heunis, a strong supporter of President Botha and the party leader in Cape 
province, resigned a week after suggesting, in a Parliament speech, that blacks 
be given a role in Parliament, in the Cabinet and in the selection of a 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative Party leaders had criticized Heunis, saying that his remarks had 
many National Party whites worried that the Pretoria government was planning to 
turn the country over to the black majority. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk said Friday that Heunis' "exploratory speech" had been misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
"To deduce that the National Party is now following in the Democratic Party's 
tracks on the way to majority rule is untrue," De Klerk said.

NASA plans to close out 1989 with a flurry of launch activity, scheduling three 
flights between Oct. 12 and the end of the year and pushing the launch of the 
Hubble Space Telescope into 1990, sources said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In a three-paragraph statement, the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration announced a new order for the next seven shuttle missions, which 
has been under debate for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anticipated Dates 
</P>
<P>
Although NASA declined to release any launch dates, sources said recent 
internal planning documents listed these anticipated dates for the mission 
order announced by the space agency Friday: 
</P>
<P>
 -- July 31: The flagship shuttle Columbia takes off on a classified military 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Oct. 12: The shuttle Atlantis carries the Galileo Jupiter probe into space. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nov. 19: Another military payload is carried into orbit by the shuttle 
Discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 -- December: Columbia returns to space to launch a military communications 
satellite and to retrieve the "long duration exposure facility," or LDEF, a 
science satellite left in orbit in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Feb. 19, 1990: Atlantis blasts off on a military mission. 
</P>
<P>
 -- March 26: Discovery carries the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit, three 
months later than had been planned. 
</P>
<P>
 -- April 26: Columbia returns to orbit for a Spacelab astronomy mission.

MANY ADIRONDACK LAKES FOUND TOO ACIDIC TO SUPPORT FISH LIFE

More than a quarter of the lakes studied in Upstate New York's Adirondack 
Mountains are so acidic that they contain no fish or very few fish, concludes a 
study on the effects of acid rain that was released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Shallow lakes in the southwestern Adirondacks are the most susceptible to high 
acidity, according to the study by the Adirondack Lakes Survey Corp., a company 
formed by utilities and state environmental officials. 
</P>
<P>
The survey of 1,723 lakes, mostly in the Adirondacks, is the most comprehensive 
work ever done by a state to examine the effects of acid rain, said James 
Mahoney, director of the federal Acid Precipitation Assessment Program, which 
hopes to finish a 10-year study on acid rain next year. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the contamination of New York state lakes can be traced to sulfur 
dioxide emitted from factories in the Midwest and borne by prevailing wind to 
the north and east, said Charles Driscoll, a civil engineering professor at 
Syracuse University. 
</P>
<P>
But since many lakes in the Adirondacks are naturally acidic, it is premature 
to conclude that the blame for all of the damage can be traced to Midwest 
factories, Driscoll said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,469 lakes surveyed in the Adirondacks, investigators found no fish in 
346 and fewer than 10 fish in 79. That's 29% of the total. 
</P>
<P>
The survey found that 352, or 24%, of the Adirondack lakes studied had pH 
levels of 5 or below. The pH level is a measurement of acidity. Anything below 
5 is considered unlikely to support life. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists had some good news. The survey examined 254 lakes in New 
York's lower Hudson River Valley and Catskill Mountains, south of the 
Adirondacks, and found only 3% with pH levels of 5 or below. 
</P>
<P>
And a related continuing study of 17 Adirondack lakes that has been under way 
since 1982 shows that the level of sulfur dioxide in the air has been 
declining, although, Driscoll said, the improvement has yet to be reflected in 
the lakes.

Authorities have smashed a $100-million-a-year money-laundering ring linked to 
a major Colombian cocaine cartel, arresting 12 people, including the 
ringleader, officials announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The network, allegedly headed by Guillermo Gomez, was believed to be 
responsible for sending millions of dollars out of the United States to 
Colombia and Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the ring laundered money for Jose Santa Cruz Londono, a leader 
of the Cali cartel, which reputedly operates the biggest cocaine ring in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
The network was smashed after an investigation began last year when banks in 
Elizabeth and Paterson, N.J., reported suspicious currency transactions by 
Colombian nationals, said Edward Litchko, chief of criminal investigation for 
the Internal Revenue Service in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation culminated with the arrest of the 12 people, including Gomez, 
during raids in Queens, Paterson and Elizabeth that also netted $500,000 in 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
The probe was conducted by the IRS, the office of the U.S. attorney for the 
Eastern District and other law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven of the 12 defendants are Colombian nationals and the other was born in 
Puerto Rico.

UP TO 36,000 BURIED IN CHICAGO'S OLD POTTER'S FIELD; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPER UNEARTHS A GRAVE SITUATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Graveyards have long figured prominently in Chicago lore, so many of their 
occupants having managed to make it to the polls come election time. But the 
latest graveyard story to be unearthed here may be hard to top. 
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, workers on the northwest side were excavating land for a new 
private housing development when they uncovered some bones -- old human bones. 
That, in itself, is not so unusual. Contractors in these parts occasionally 
stumble over Indian graves or unmarked family plots from the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
But the more they dug, the more they uncovered. There were fragments of arms, 
legs, ribs and skulls by the shovelful. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
As Many as 36,000 Bodies 
</P>
<P>
This was not some makeshift resting place for a few isolated corpses but rather 
the former site of a large public cemetery. From 1855 to 1912 it was the main 
potter's field for Cook County. The state then took over the land for an insane 
asylum and continued to bury dead patients there for at least another decade 
and possibly longer. 
</P>
<P>
Prairie fires and rot long ago had obliterated the modest wooden crosses and 
other traces of a graveyard that once dotted the landscape. Still, cemetery 
historian Barry Fleig said he has found proof of at least 15,000 burials that 
had taken place at the 26-acre site over the years. Extrapolating from gaps in 
the records, Fleig estimated that the ground is filled with as many as 36,000 
bodies, including 117 of the approximately 300 known victims of the 1871 
Chicago fire. 
</P>
<P>
"It's well documented," said Fleig, an official of the Chicago Genealogical 
Society. "I've got names and addresses of people who are buried there. I've got 
death certificates. I've got annual reports (of cemetery operations.) I've got 
weekly reports. I can tell you how much varnish was used on the caskets." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, authorities somehow -- no one for the time being is saying for sure -- 
either forgot or ignored the cemetery last year when the state sold a chunk of 
surplus land adjacent to what is now a mental hospital for more than $5 
million. Officials of Pontarelli Builders &amp; Realtors, the developers of the 
site, have failed to respond to queries about the transaction from The Times 
and other media. 
</P>
<P>
After the initial discovery in March, digging continued because of a 
bureaucratic mix-up between city and county authorities. But last week, Richard 
Cieslik, a supervisor with the Chicago Health Department, ordered a halt to 
further excavation until it could be determined where all the bodies were and 
what's to be done with them. Chicago law forbids anyone to disturb a cemetery 
and stipulates that only licensed funeral directors can move, rebury or dispose 
of buried human remains. 
</P>
<P>
In a ghoulish twist, Cieslik also asked Pontarelli to post guards at the site 
to stop curiousity seekers who, apparently intrigued by local news accounts of 
the find, had been carting away souvenir bones by the dozens. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legal Quagmire 
</P>
<P>
The situation is almost sure to lead to a monumental legal quagmire. Past 
disputes over abandoned cemetery plots in the city have rarely involved more 
than a handful of bodies. Faced with such an unprecedented dilemma, Cieslik 
said it was doubtful that any bodies could be removed or excavation work 
resumed without a court order. "We don't have anybody legitimate to represent 
these people," said Cieslik. "There's no relatives to say, 'yes, go ahead,' 
move them." 
</P>
<P>
And then, of course, there's the question of who should pick up the bill for 
removing the bodies. "As of the moment, the developers are going to have to 
cover the costs . . . " said Cieslik. "I would imagine they'll sue the state, 
and the state will sue the county, and this will go on for years." Cieslik said 
a similar, although less extensive, case in South Carolina rambled through the 
judicial process for seven years before it came to a final disposition and 
disinterment was allowed to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
Fleig said the poorhouse cemetery find was by far the largest such 
"rediscovery" of any such case he has ever encountered and it has generated the 
most interest. "It's a very emotional issue," said Fleig. "I get calls all the 
time from people who are outraged that the dead are being disturbed. Our 
culture doesn't allow for that. It's one thing to forget about a cemetery and 
quite another to desecrate it with a sewer line."

POSSE TRACKS DOWN MAN SOUGHT IN WIFE'S SLAYING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
An Anaheim man who allegedly killed his wife and threatened to "punish" 54 
other people was arrested Friday after a posse of Montana deputies chased him 
down in the rugged, snow-capped mountains of Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
David L. Schoenecker, 48, was arrested without incident by Mineral County, 
Mont., deputies who had tracked him on horseback through the wooded, 
mountainous terrain of western Montana and eastern Idaho, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Schoenecker was booked at the Mineral County Jail in Superior, Mont., and bail 
was set at $500,000. At an arraignment hearing, he refused to waive extradition 
to Anaheim, where he is wanted in the murder of his 40-year-old wife, Gail 
Schoenecker. 
</P>
<P>
Her body was discovered by police Thursday after Schoenecker allegedly sent a 
five-page letter to a columnist for the Register of Orange County claiming that 
he had killed his wife and telling where her body could be found. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim police searched the couple's north Anaheim home and found a woman's 
body on a bed in the master bedroom. Police said the body was badly decomposed, 
and formal identification had not been made, but they believed that it was 
Schoenecker's wife. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy revealed that the woman had died of a single gunshot wound to the 
head from a large-caliber weapon. At the time of Schoenecker's arrest, Montana 
authorities said, he was carrying a .357-caliber revolver. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter to the newspaper, Schoenecker made reference to a list of people 
he had left behind who would be "punished." Police said they found a list of 54 
names in the Schoenecker house, all of them from Wisconsin. Schoenecker and his 
wife lived for a time in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
"Not everyone on the list will receive total punishment -- but they will be 
punished," said an excerpt of the letter, which was obtained by The Times. "The 
images in my mind shows me exactly how and when and where the punishment will 
be delivered. It has to be done." 
</P>
<P>
The letter gave no clues as to what precipitated the killing, and police 
remained puzzled over why it happened. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no hatred -- I loved her -- but the action was necessary because I 
have a purpose, and one that cannot have an interruption or interference," the 
letter said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Marc Hedgpeth, an Anaheim police spokesman, said detectives were to fly to 
Montana Friday night with an arrest warrant and seek to have Schoenecker 
returned to Orange County to face charges.

REPORT URGES OVERHAUL OF COASTAL PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, Times Environmental Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Declaring that budget cuts by Gov. George Deukmejian have seriously limited the 
effectiveness of the California Coastal Commission, a state Senate citizen 
advisory panel called Friday for a major overhaul of the commission along with 
tough new conflict-of-interest prohibitions. 
</P>
<P>
The current 12-member, part-time coastal commission should be reduced in size 
to nine full-time members who serve fixed four-year terms, the panel said in a 
report. It also urged that coastal commissioners be prohibited from raising 
political campaign funds from individuals with business before the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners should draft a new code of conduct, and existing laws should be 
"strictly enforced" to prohibit commissioners from voting on any issue that 
materially affects their personal financial position, the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope that this will help to insulate the commission from any political 
distractions and influences which might have an affect on the commission's 
implementation and enforcement of the coastal act," the advisory panel said. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations, among 33 delivered Friday to the state Senate by the 
25-member Senate Advisory Commission on Cost Control in State Government, 
culminated a yearlong investigation into the coastal commission's operations. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear what reception the recommendations will get in the Legislature, 
which appoints some of the coastal commission members. Others are appointed by 
the Assembly Speaker, the governor and local officials. 
</P>
<P>
The advisory panel was created by legislation carried in 1984 by Senate 
President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), who in 1987 fired the 
Senate's appointee to the coastal commission after Roberti was told that the 
commissioner, Gilbert R. Contreras, intended to vote in favor of Occidental 
Petroleum's controversial Pacific Palisades coastal oil drilling project, which 
Roberti opposed. 
</P>
<P>
Without mentioning specific incidents, the advisory panel said the coastal 
commission had lost credibility with the public. Panel Chairman Milton G. 
Gordon referred reporters to newspaper accounts detailing the Contreras 
episode, as well as fund-raising activities by commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti had no immediate comment on the Senate panel's recommendation to 
establish fixed terms for commissioners. Such a rule would have prohibited the 
Senate Rules Committee, which Roberti chairs, from firing Contreras on the day 
he was supposed to vote on the Occidental case. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti's office issued a statement calling the panel's work "a thoughtful 
report." 
</P>
<P>
Hampered by an inadequate staff and budget that is less than half what it was 
in 1977, the coastal commission has approved only 56% of local coastal plans in 
the state, has an ineffective enforcement program, a growing backlog of 762 
enforcement cases and has little ability to conduct long-term research and 
planning on issues ranging from rising seas due to global warming to offshore 
oil development and earthquake hazards, the advisory panel said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission budget should not fall below its current level until all local 
coastal plans are completed and approved, the report said. The commission's 
current budget is $7.5 million, but the governor has proposed a $695,000 cut in 
the 1989-90 fiscal year, which begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon said that if all the panel's recommendations were carried out, the 
commission would require an annual budget of $20 million. However, the panel 
offered no suggestion as to where the money would come from, saying that was a 
decision the Legislature would have to make.

'INTERVENTION TEAM' WILL WATCH INSURANCE HEARINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Formation of an "intervention team" of actuaries and financial experts to 
represent consumer interests in hearings by the state Insurance Department into 
rate rollback exemptions was announced Friday by Harvey Rosenfield, Proposition 
103 chairman, and Conway Collis, a prospective candidate for state insurance 
commissioner in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Sutter Creek insurance consultant Mark Gerlach, a former rate analyst for the 
state Insurance Department, was named to serve as the paid executive director 
of the group, which will analyze and comment on insurance industry documents 
submitted to support exemptions from the 20% rate rollbacks from 1987 levels 
called for under Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
The group applied Friday with Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie for 
intervenor status in the forthcoming hearings. Under one provision of 
Proposition 103, Gillespie may order the insurance companies to reimburse such 
intervenors if she finds that they substantially contributed to eventual rate 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it's essential that consumers have their own representation in these 
proceedings," said Collis, a member of the state Board of Equalization who has 
Rosenfield's support in his developing campaign for insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield said he also welcomes the participation of other consumer groups, 
such as Consumers Union and the Insurance Consumer Action Network, as 
intervenors in the hearings, although he noted that earlier in the week their 
leaders had said they lacked the resources to fully participate unless they 
were to get advance funding from insurers. Rosenfield said his initiative does 
not permit such advance funding. 
</P>
<P>
Also named as experts assisting the Rosenfield-Collis group were San Diego 
actuary Clarence Atwood and Beverly Hills public accountant H. Les Kornblatt.

SOUTHERN PACIFIC'S ACCIDENT RECORD IS 'NOTHING EXTRAORDINARY,' OFFICIALS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials at the Federal Railroad Administration said Friday that Southern 
Pacific "is pretty much in the middle range compared with other railroads" in 
terms of frequency of accidents and casualties suffered. 
</P>
<P>
From 1982 through 1987, the latest year for which a Southern Pacific breakdown 
was available, the agency said the line had a total of 1,789 derailments. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Pacific accidents, including collisions and derailments, reported 
during the six-year period caused a total of 43 fatalities and 176 injuries. 
</P>
<P>
William Loftus, the Railroad Administration's executive director, said that in 
1987 Southern Pacific reported 129 derailments along with seven collisions, 
causing six fatalities and 29 injuries. 
</P>
<P>
He said that constituted a ratio of 1.04 casualties per million miles of travel 
by Southern Pacific trains along its nearly 13,000 miles of track in 14 states. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 129 Southern Pacific derailments in 1987, Loftus said his agency had 
ascribed 70 to track defects, 28 to mechanical and equipment failures, 10 to 
human factors, including human errors or substance abuse, and 21 to 
miscellaneous factors such as load shifts or vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
The proportion of equipment and mechanical failures in 1987 was a little higher 
for Southern Pacific than for American railroads as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
But, Loftus said, there is really "nothing extraordinary" about Southern 
Pacific accident losses or causes as compared to the rest of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Other statistics provided by the agency showed that the number of railroad 
accidents in the United States overall has been declining in the last seven 
years, although there was a slight rise in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Human factors and track defects, such as warps or cracks, were far more often 
found to be the cause of accidents than mechanical and electrical failures, 
according to a spokeswoman for the Railroad Administration. Indeed, from 1982 
to 1988, only about one-sixth of all accidents investigated were ascribed to 
mechanical and electrical failures. 
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman, Claire Austin, said that during the seven-year period, there 
were 24,081 rail accidents in the United States that caused at least $4,700 
damage each. 
</P>
<P>
Of these, 8,914 were found to be caused by track defects, 7,183 were caused by 
human factors, 4,029 by mechanical and electrical failures and 3,955 by 
miscellaneous factors. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for both the Railroad Administration and the National Transportation 
Safety Board declined all comment on what might have caused Friday's Southern 
Pacific crash, saying they would not speculate until their investigations are 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
Loftus said that in both 1987 and 1988 Southern Pacific had won an award for 
being the railroad with the lowest number of employee injuries considering 
miles traveled.

A brain-dead teen-ager was removed from life-support equipment Friday, two days 
after giving birth to a premature daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Tanya Marie Rivera, 15, had been kept on life-support systems after county 
officials rejected the initial pleas of her parents not to do so. 
</P>
<P>
She died at 12:58 p.m. at San Bernardino County Medical Center, while her 
2-day-old daughter remained in very critical condition with lung problems, 
according to a hospital statement. 
</P>
<P>
"The parents of Tanya Rivera met with administrators and physicians responsible 
for her care and it was jointly decided that continuing to keep Tanya on 
life-support would serve no purpose," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager was declared brain dead March 15 after she suffered a gunshot 
wound to the head, which police say was inflicted by her 16-year-old boyfriend, 
a reputed gang member who is believed to be the newborn's father. 
</P>
<P>
No charges have been filed against the boy, who is in jail in Los Angeles on an 
unrelated murder charge.

SDG&amp;E VOWS TO BATTLE BILL SMOOTHING PATH FOR A MUNICIPAL TAKEOVER 
</P>

<P>
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. officials vowed Friday to strenuously oppose 
the latest legislative effort to make it easier for the government to take over 
the investor-owned utility. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Hutchens, director of governmental affairs for the company, said the firm 
will try to defeat a bill by Sen. Larry Stirling (R-San Diego) in a Senate 
committee next week. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was recently amended so that it would allow the county to call for an 
election, at which a majority of voters could approve creation of a 
seven-member County Utility District that could sell bonds and purchase the 
utility. The bonds would be repaid by revenue from utility users. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Different Process 
</P>
<P>
Under existing law, the formation of such a district would first require each 
of the county's city councils to vote to place the issue on the ballot. Then 
two-thirds of the voters in each participating city would have to approve the 
measure before the public utility could be formed. 
</P>
<P>
Stirling's bill would also allow the San Diego County Board of Supervisors to 
appoint the original seven members of the public utility's board of directors. 
These members would then be phased out and replaced by elected members during a 
four-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Existing law requires that members of a public utility be elected at the same 
time the utility is formed. 
</P>
<P>
Hutchens said Stirling's bill was no more than an indirect attack by San Diego 
politicians on SDG&amp;E's proposed merger with Los Angeles County-based 
Southern California Edison Co. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Why Is This Needed?' 
</P>
<P>
"Our question is, 'Why is this needed?' " Hutchens said. "What makes San Diego 
so different? We already have existing laws on the books which provide for the 
formation of municipal utility districts. Why do we have to go to another 
method?" 
</P>
<P>
Hutchens said recent opinion polls show that most county residents oppose a 
government takeover of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric. 
</P>
<P>
"The people of San Diego County thought that the municipal takeover issue was 
dead and buried," she said. "The merger is the real issue. Yet we have 
legislation like this still coming up in Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
Deleting the two-thirds vote requirement, Hutchens said, "really takes the 
voters out of the process." 
</P>
<P>
In its earlier form, Stirling's bill would have allowed the San Diego County 
Water Authority to go into the energy business and purchase SDG&amp;E. Stirling 
had all but abandoned that measure amid signs that legislators would not 
support it. 
</P>
<P>
Stirling, in fact, said last month that the strategy of proposing a public 
takeover of the utility was a "mistake" that had been used by SDG&amp;E as a 
"red herring" to divert attention from the merger issue. 
</P>
<P>
In that interview, Stirling said: "What I've done is make a tactical mistake by 
raising the issue of municipalization so heavily. It's given the Edison people 
a perfect straw man to fight against." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, however, Stirling said that, despite the political strategy, he 
continues to believe that a municipal utility is the best alternative for San 
Diegans. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the municipal utility will provide the best service at the cheapest 
cost," Stirling said. "I think it's important that the voters get their best 
chance at evaluating that and acting on it if they so choose." 
</P>
<P>
Ben Clay, a lobbyist for the County Water Authority, said the bill was changed 
to overcome the objections of state legislators who opposed the measure in its 
original form. 
</P>
<P>
Clay said the bill's provision for a countywide majority vote, rather than a 
city-by-city and two-thirds majority, would prevent the establishment of a 
"patchwork quilt" utility system in which some cities were served by the public 
utility and others by an investor-owned company. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it makes more sense to have them all in or have them all out," Clay 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Stirling's bill is scheduled to be heard Tuesday in the Senate Agriculture and 
Water Resources Committee. It may also be referred to the Energy and Public 
Utilities Committee, which last month killed another Stirling bill that would 
have provided for an advisory vote of San Diegans before the SDG&amp;E-Edison 
merger could go forward.

WASTE RECYCLING PLAN DRAWS SOME UNLIKELY CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A plan for recycling residential trash in Los Angeles drew criticism from 
unexpected corners Friday at the first public hearing on the project. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the city's 720,000 houses and small apartment buildings, who would 
bear the weekly burden of having to prepare their trash for recycling, were 
conspicuously absent from the hearing before the Board of Public Works. But 
environmentalists and private trash haulers were ready to debate the 800-page 
proposal submitted by the city's Bureau of Sanitation. 
</P>
<P>
If enacted by the City Council, as expected, the plan would require city 
residents to sort their glass and plastic bottles, aluminum cans, newspapers 
and yard debris before the trash is collected. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the extra work, city residents may also have to pay for the 
project. Among the financing plans being explored by a special mayoral task 
force is a $3.66 monthly fee for each household. 
</P>
<P>
But no one who appeared at the hearing complained about extra work or new fees. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, several environmentalists criticized the proposal for not going far 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
"Styrofoam really should be banned," said Sally Neubauer of the Citizens 
Committee to Save Elysian Park. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Parks 
</P>
<P>
Neubauer also said she was concerned that the city would use landfills that 
have already been converted to public parks to process the recyclable trash. 
</P>
<P>
Others complained that the proposal does not adequately address what will 
happen to the recycled trash. For the plan to work economically, some 
environmentalists said, the city must find buyers for the recycled trash. 
</P>
<P>
"The key to the success of this recycling program will be the ability to 
develop new markets for this material," said Barbara Fine, chairwoman of Solid 
Waste Citizen Advisory Group. 
</P>
<P>
Hearing chairman Dennis Nishikawa, vice president of the Board of Public Works, 
said he was not surprised that no residents came to oppose the plan Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think residents are pretty well educated to the fact they want to do 
something about the environment," Nishikawa said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, each household would be given three containers, one for 
recyclable trash such as aluminum cans, the second for garbage that cannot be 
recycled and the third for yard debris. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Yard Wastes 
</P>
<P>
About 90,000 households would begin separating all but the yard wastes as early 
as July. The rest of the city's households would be phased in within three 
years. Separating yard wastes would also be added within two years. 
</P>
<P>
During the first five years, the program would cost an estimated $66 million a 
year, city officials have said. But $13 million of the cost could be earned 
back through the sale of recyclable material and reduced landfill costs. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Public Works will hold a second public hearing on the plan at City 
Hall on Thursday at 6 p.m.

COUNCILMEN INVEST IN FIRMS WITH CITY TIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL STEWART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A number of City Council members own significant amounts of stock in banks and 
other companies that do business with the city or seek rulings from the city, 
and at least one member of the council is reassessing her personal investments 
in the wake of conflict-of-interest troubles facing Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of council members investing in locally operating companies emerged 
publicly several days ago when Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores had to excuse 
herself from voting as a member of the city's Board of Referred Powers. 
</P>
<P>
The special board makes decisions on behalf of the council or city commissions 
whenever those groups face conflicts of interest that prevent their voting. 
</P>
<P>
But when the board ruled on an issue involving a lawsuit by the Bank of San 
Pedro, in which Flores owns $5,000 worth of stock, she bolted from the room to 
avoid any appearance that her investments might influence the vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not here! I'm not here!" she cried, scooping up her files and 
disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
Flores, who bought the stock long before being elected to the council, put it 
up for sale this week to avoid any perception of a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that in today's times we have to be free of any potential conflict of 
interest," Flores said, adding, "We have an obligation to eliminate any 
potential conflict." 
</P>
<P>
Although Flores' investment in the bank is a relatively modest $5,000, council 
members Michael Woo, John Ferraro and Marvin Braude reported in official 
disclosure statements that they each own stock worth tens of thousands of 
dollars in banks and other firms involved in city matters. 
</P>
<P>
None of the three plan to sell any of the stocks. They argue that they are 
easily able to steer clear of votes and decisions related to the companies. And 
they say they cannot personally gain by voting because the companies in which 
they own stock are so vast that council votes have no measurable effect on the 
companies' financial status. 
</P>
<P>
Under the state Political Reform Act, elected officials generally cannot act on 
issues in which they stand to gain materially from income, investments, 
directorships or landholdings. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley faces four independent investigations into his income from two local 
financial institutions and his investments with Drexel Burnham Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
Woo, who heads the Governmental Operations Committee looking into Bradley's 
financial affairs, owns significant stock in Cathay Bank, which his father 
founded in the 1960s. The bank currently holds $1 million in city deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Cathay Bank "has never asked me any special favors," Woo said. "I don't see it 
as a conflict at all." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Mount, an aide to Ferraro, said Ferraro "has always been very conscientious 
about that kind of thing and does not vote when a related company is involved. 
. . . He is not going to make any changes. He told me he'll only sell stocks 
when it's financially prudent." 
</P>
<P>
Braude, who owns stock in Xerox Corp. and telecommunications firms involved in 
city business, said: "Those are very large companies and my stock holdings are 
infinitesimal (compared to total shares in the companies). I don't have any 
holdings that present any conflicts." 
</P>
<P>
Because council members are allowed to report their investments in broadly 
drawn categories of value -- $1,000 to $10,000, $10,001 to $100,000, and more 
than $100,000 -- the full extent of the three council members' holdings are not 
known. However, their 1988 reports and past disclosures show: 
</P>
<P>
* Woo's wealth is largely derived from a substantial but undisclosed interest 
in his parents' wholesale business, Chungking Produce Co. Woo reported those 
holdings as "over" $100,000 in 1988. His Cathay Bank stock is worth $10,001 to 
$100,000 and paid dividends of $1,300 last year. 
</P>
<P>
* Ferraro is a multimillionaire who gained success many years ago partly as a 
young insurance broker with a well-connected state senator for a father-in-law. 
Since those days in the 1940s and '50s, he has accumulated land and stock. 
Among his other holdings in 1988, he reported owning stocks in 70 local and 
Blue Chip companies worth between $367,000 and $3.67 million. 
</P>
<P>
* Braude built his fortune by helping found Scientific Data Systems, now the 
computer division of Xerox Corp. In 1988 he reported owning 25 stocks worth at 
least $403,000, but possibly worth more than $2.2 million. His holdings include 
six telecommunications firms in addition to utilities and chemical companies. 
</P>
<P>
* Another council member, Hal Bernson, reported owning no stocks, land or other 
investments in 1988. But he faces a potential conflict of interest over a firm 
that employs his wife and is involved in city business. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson has funneled more than $17,000 in business to his wife's employer, 
Emerald Travel in Northridge, which handles Bernson's unusually heavy travel 
and hotel bookings, city records show. Bernson, who has been under 
investigation by the Fair Political Practices Commission since 1988 concerning 
the issue, did not return a phone call made by The Times seeking his comments. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson spent $78,000 in campaign funds on travel in 1987 and 1988 alone, and 
has spent more than $10,000 in city funds for travel since 1986, making him one 
of the most extensive travelers in City Hall, according to city records. 
</P>
<P>
In Woo's case, although his father Wilbur still sits on Cathay Bank's board, he 
said he sees no conflict of interest because his bank shares -- gifts from his 
family -- cannot substantially be affected by votes on the council. 
</P>
<P>
"The stock I own is less than one-tenth of 1% of the shares held in that bank, 
and if I knew of a conflict I would avoid it," he said. "In the last four years 
I've only known of one case of a development in my district in which the 
financing came from Cathay Bank, a mini-mall that I have opposed." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Woo said he was comfortable enough with his relationship to Cathay Bank 
to honor its 25th anniversary a few years ago with a formal commendation during 
a council meeting. Council members regularly commend schools, individual 
constituents, companies and groups involved in community activities. 
</P>
<P>
Cathay is one of several banks in Los Angeles that has been sought out by City 
Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg under his personal policy of encouraging city 
deposits at minority-owned banks. 
</P>
<P>
Rittenberg has said he does not attempt to determine whether banks such as 
Cathay, a highly successful venture, demonstrate any need for being included in 
the special program. His policy is likely to be challenged by several council 
members who have already questioned it. 
</P>
<P>
According to city records, Cathay became a constant recipient of city deposits 
in early 1986, several months after Woo was elected to the council. Before 
that, the treasurer had deposited money with Cathay, but on a more sporadic 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
However, both Rittenberg and Woo said there is no connection between the 
councilman and city deposits. Rittenberg said his office established a 
relationship with Cathay Bank long before Woo's 1985 election. For instance, 
Rittenberg said, in 1982, the treasurer's office deposited $1 million in a 
six-month interest-bearing account at Cathay Bank, and other deposits were made 
after that. 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro's portfolio includes many companies involved in city business, 
according to his public disclosure report. He owns $10,001 to $100,000 worth of 
stock in Anheuser-Busch Co., Columbia Savings &amp; Loan, Craig Corp., Exxon 
and GTE, all of which have been granted city business or have sought zoning 
decisions or other rulings from the city. 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro, a heavy stock trader who moves tens of thousands of dollars worth of 
stock nearly every month, also owns between $10,001 and $100,000 in stock at 
Wells Fargo, which holds city deposits. In 1987 he sold $10,001 to $100,000 
worth of stock in Bank of America, one of the biggest recipients of city 
business both then and now. 
</P>
<P>
He owns $1,000 to $10,000 worth of stock in Wilshire Bankcorporation, which has 
city deposits, and he owns $10,000 to $100,000 in stock in Hollywood Park, to 
which he has been granted a free pass as a gift. 
</P>
<P>
Mount, his aide, said that because of these extensive holdings, Ferraro tries 
to avoid "the appearance of conflict, so when he isn't sure, he does not vote." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, she said, the city attorney's office knows which stocks Ferraro 
owns "and usually notifies him ahead of any related vote." 
</P>
<P>
Braude owns an undisclosed amount of stock, worth more than $100,000, in Xerox, 
which provides service and equipment to the city. He also owns $10,001 to 
$100,000 worth of stock in Pacific Telesis, Merrill Lynch and Citicorp, all of 
which do business with the city. 
</P>
<P>
Other council members have small to moderate holdings in locally operated 
companies that are involved in city matters. 
</P>
<P>
Zev Yaroslavsky in 1988 owned $1,000 to $10,001 worth of stock in Pep Boys, 
which in recent years received federal grants from the city to help build a new 
headquarters in the Pico-Union District. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky also listed in his disclosure statements $1,000 to $10,001 worth of 
stock in Bank of Los Angeles, which does not hold any city deposits, and he 
owns $1,000 to $10,000 worth of stock in IBM, which does business with the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a problem because whenever an issue comes up, I will disqualify 
myself," Yaroslavsky said. "The problem is when you own stock or have an income 
and go ahead and act and fail to disqualify yourself. But my portfolio doesn't 
have much in it, so I don't really face any decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Joy Picus owns $1,000 to $10,000 worth of stock in Pacific Telesis Group and in 
Southern California Edison, two of the city's largest service providers. 
</P>
<P>
Nate Holden owns a note worth $7,000 in Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital, which 
he bought several years ago when the hospital was selling notes to finance a 
new wing. He said he plans to sell the note because it no longer pays him 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
Four council members are landlords and they must sometimes weigh citywide rent 
control issues and a wide range of other matters affecting landowners and land 
use. The FPPC, in an opinion, ruled that elected officials can vote on rent 
control if they own fewer than four rental homes, but those owning four or more 
can vote only if they would not materially gain from the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Only Councilman Gilbert Lindsay owns four residential rental properties, all of 
them in South-Central Los Angeles, from which he collects between $4,000 and 
$40,000 in rental payments per year. The properties' total value is listed at 
between $40,000 and $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro, in addition to his own five-bath, two-fireplace home in Hancock Park, 
owns a Hollywood townhouse, a 30,000-square-foot office building in Woodland 
Hills and a garage in Covina, according to DAMAR Corp. Real Estate Information 
Systems. His properties are worth well over $3 million, according to real 
estate reports. He receives an undisclosed amount of annual rent, listed only 
as "over" $30,000, from his townhouse, office building and garage. 
</P>
<P>
Holden reported owning an interest in four homes and one parcel in Los Angeles 
and neighboring cities in 1988 that are worth more than $410,000. He reported 
that none generated rental income. Councilwoman Gloria Molina owns a single 
rental property in El Monte worth more than $100,000 and receives rental income 
of $1,001 to $10,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Richard Alatorre, Ernani Bernardi, Robert Farrell, Ruth 
Galanter and Joel Wachs reported owning no stock, investments or land of any 
kind beyond their personal residences in 1988.

PRODUCER ROBERT EVANS INVOKES 5TH AT HEARING IN MURDER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McDOUGAL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Cotton Club" producer Robert Evans, the first witness in a preliminary hearing 
into the 6-year-old murder of Broadway entrepreneur Roy Radin, took the witness 
stand Friday just long enough to invoke his constitutional right against 
self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know a man by the name of Roy Radin?" asked Deputy Dist. Atty. David 
Conn. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on the advice of counsel, I refuse to answer the question," answered the 
tanned, dapper producer of such film classics as "Chinatown" and the 
"Godfather" movies. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-minute debate that followed, in and outside of Municipal Judge Patti Jo 
McKay's chambers, set the stage for a Monday morning showdown between Conn and 
Evans' attorney, Robert Shapiro, over the question that has hung over Evans 
since last October: 
</P>
<P>
Is the 58-year-old former head of Paramount Pictures a suspect in the 
cocaine-related shooting death of Radin on March 13, 1983, in a remote canyon 
in the northeast corner of Los Angeles County? 
</P>
<P>
Judge McKay warned Shapiro that Evans might be jailed for contempt if she finds 
him to be improperly invoking his constitutional right against 
self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
Three men and a woman, alleged cocaine dealer Karen Jacobs Greenberger, have 
been formally charged in the execution-style killing of Radin. One defendant, 
Robert Lowe, 42, remains in custody in Maryland where he is fighting 
extradition. The other defendants are ex-security guards William Mentzer and 
Alex Marti. 
</P>
<P>
In a public statement last October, shortly after the arrests of Marti, Mentzer 
and Greenberger, Conn refused to rule Evans out as a suspect in the murder. 
Since then, news articles, television programs and magazine studies have 
explored virtually every aspect of what has come to be called the "Cotton Club 
case." 
</P>
<P>
"This audience is filled with writers and reporters for one reason and one 
reason only," Shapiro told Judge McKay, motioning toward the packed spectator 
benches of her courtroom. "Mr. Evans is here . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Evans himself has remained silent about the case. 
</P>
<P>
Police reports filed in support of search warrants in the case indicate that at 
least two potential witnesses implicated Evans in the murder. According to the 
reports, Evans was believed to have entered into a pact with Greenberger to 
hire Mentzer, Marti and Lowe to kill Radin. 
</P>
<P>
Radin, a corpulent theatrical promoter from Long Island, had struck a deal with 
Evans to raise $2 million for production of feature films, including "Cotton 
Club," according to court records. According to the prosecution, Greenberger 
sought to become a partner in the deal. After being squeezed out, she allegedly 
plotted Radin's murder.

In a letter attorney Shapiro had hand-delivered to Conn on Tuesday, the lawyer 
detailed Evans' cooperation with the Radin murder inquiry from its inception in 
1983. He warned that Evans would not testify as a witness for the prosecution 
until Conn rules Evans out as a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like something you'd see in a movie," Shapiro said outside the 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Conn refused comment on Evans' status as a suspect. He said he did not have 
"sufficient evidence" to file charges against Evans, but also declined to offer 
him immunity from prosecution. He told McKay he believes Evans does not want to 
testify because "it involves an episode in his life that he may look back upon 
with regret." 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the murder, Evans was deeply in debt from his involvement in the 
$42-million "Cotton Club" movie. He also had an admitted history of cocaine 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Evans recently began a comeback in film production after a five-year hiatus 
following the disappointing release of "Cotton Club." In addition to an 
executive producer credit on "The Two Jakes" sequel to "Chinatown," which stars 
Jack Nicholson and is now filming in Valencia, Evans is also distributing a 
home video documentary on the life and times of Pope John Paul II entitled "The 
Planet Is Alive."

OWNER OF FUND TRANSFER FIRM ACCUSED OF BILKING IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, saying he supports a bill that would regulate a booming 
industry that transmits money and goods to foreign countries, announced charges 
Friday against the owner of a fund transfer operation that allegedly cheated 
100 immigrants out of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner and Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) said the proposed 
legislation is aimed at "fly-by-night" money transmittal operations that prey 
on Latino and Asian immigrants sending money home to their relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, the businesses promise to transmit cash to Mexico and other 
countries in Latin America and Asia overnight. Some, however, delay delivery 
for months or shut down and disappear without delivering the money at all, 
Reiner said. 
</P>
<P>
"These businesses are taking advantage of people who are very vulnerable and 
are not familiar with the laws," Reiner said. "This is a crime that is 
happening with great frequency but we don't hear about it." 
</P>
<P>
Reiner said his office filed an arrest warrant Friday against Maritza Perez, a 
Downey woman who allegedly defrauded immigrants at a money transmittal business 
with branches in Silver Lake, Huntington Park, Anaheim and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Perez opened El Espanol Internacional in 1985; the business catered mostly to 
Cuban immigrants, Reiner said. Among the victims of the alleged fraud was an 
80-year-old man who lost more than $4,000 he gave the company to send to 
relatives in Cuba. About 100 other immigrants were cheated out of amounts 
ranging from $100 to $700, Reiner said. 
</P>
<P>
Andres Mucino, an investigator for the district attorney's office said Perez 
had closed the businesses and fled her home. She was still at large Friday, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed legislation, authored by Polanco, would close "loopholes" in the 
laws that regulate the businesses. Under existing law, money transmittal 
businesses must be licensed by the state Banking Department, but the businesses 
are not required to give refunds to their customers if the money is not 
delivered promptly. Nor is the there any limit to when they must deliver the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
The new legislation would eliminate exemptions for businesses that transmit 
money via telegraph and would require these businesses to deliver within 10 
days. Penalties for violating the proposed law would range up to three years in 
prison and a $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner said most of the money transmittal companies in Southern California are 
licensed and don't take advantage of customers. Carlos Mendoza of Fiesta 
Exchange, one of more than a dozen downtown businesses offering "instant" 
delivery of cash to Mexico and other parts of Latin America, said he welcomed 
the proposed legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"Those of us who are licensed are audited regularly," he said. "Other companies 
that aren't licensed can commit abuses and frauds. (The bill) is a good thing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big Source of Income 
</P>
<P>
Economists estimate that money sent by immigrants in the United States to one 
Central American country alone -- El Salvador -- total at least $500 million. 
The remittances are an important source of income for many impoverished 
families in Asia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
Not affected by the legislation proposed by Polanco and Reiner would be express 
courier companies that send money orders overnight to Latin America. Dozens of 
the courier businesses operate in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Polanco's office said the bill passed the Assembly Finance and 
Insurance Committee on May 2 and is pending before the Assembly Ways and Means 
Committee.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GUNMAN KILLS DRIVER AS HE GETS INTO VAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Atlantic Richfield refinery worker leaving his Carson home for work with a 
colleague was shot and killed Friday by a gunman apparently hiding in the back 
of his van, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was not immediately identified. 
</P>
<P>
After shooting the 55-year-old man in the chest, the gunman also fired at the 
man's co-worker, who was sitting in the passenger seat of the van, but he 
missed, Deputy Dan Cox said, adding that the attacker then fled. 
</P>
<P>
The co-worker drove the van about a block back to the victim's house at 250 
Carriagedale Drive, where the victim died. 
</P>
<P>
Cox said the victim had just driven away from his home about 5:20 a.m. when the 
gunman appeared from the back of the van and fired at him. 
</P>
<P>
The motive for the attack was not immediately known and no suspects were in 
custody.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EXTRA DEPUTIES DUE AT GANG KILLING SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the wake of a drive-by shooting of a star athlete in Norwalk, the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department will send extra deputies to the area's gang 
hot spots this weekend to prevent retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies will enforce a 10 p.m.-to-sunrise curfew in the south end of Norwalk 
and the northern part of Artesia, where two rival gangs, Varrio and Chivas, 
have fought over the last year. 
</P>
<P>
At a special meeting Friday to discuss gang-related problems, members of the 
Artesia and Norwalk city councils expressed fear that there might be some 
violence because of the killing of Juan Enriquez. 
</P>
<P>
Enriquez, 18, an honor student whose death was mourned Thursday by about 2,000 
fellow John Glenn High School students, was not a member of either gang, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm fearful of what might take place this weekend," said Norwalk Councilman 
Marcial Rodriguez.

NRC TO OK START-UP OF PLANT DESPITE BOLT DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite damage to bolts holding an important thermal shield in Unit 1 at the 
San Onofre nuclear power plant, federal regulators plan to give permission for 
the plant's operators to start up the reactor. 
</P>
<P>
Lando Zech, chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said in a letter to 
four San Diego congressmen that problems with the bolts do not threaten safe 
operation of the reactor. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Congressman Jim Bates (D-San Diego) continued to press Friday for 
officials to delay restarting the plant, arguing that the NRC in 1987 required 
operators of a Connecticut reactor with similar problems to do repairs before 
resuming operations. 
</P>
<P>
Bates also has requested that the NRC hold a hearing on the issue before the 
reactor is fired up, suggesting that some critics may have misunderstood a 
deadline for requesting such a forum. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Typographical Error 
</P>
<P>
Because of a typographical error, a notice published March 2 in the Federal 
Register said that hearing requests had to be filed by April 3, 1988, instead 
of the correct date of April 3, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those arguments, an NRC spokesman in Washington said Friday that the 
agency will probably give the plant's operators, Southern California Edison, 
permission early next week to start up Unit 1. 
</P>
<P>
The thermal shield, a 2 1/2-inch-thick cylinder that absorbs gamma rays from 
the nuclear core, rests on six supporting blocks and is linked to the reactor 
floor by 30 bolts. Three of those bolts have come partly unscrewed, and others 
appear to be in a degraded condition. 
</P>
<P>
Although critics worry that problems with the bolts could cause the shield to 
come loose and block the flow of reactor coolant, Zech said his staff agrees 
with an Edison assessment that such a scenario is highly unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
"The analysis concludes that the thermal shield will remain safely in place, 
or, in the unlikely event it should move, flow to the reactor core would not be 
significantly affected," Zech said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Monitoring Condition of Shield 
</P>
<P>
Zech also noted that Edison plans to carefully monitor the condition of the 
thermal shield and promises to shut down immediately if problems arise. 
</P>
<P>
At the very latest, the utility will make repairs when the reactor is again 
shut down for servicing about January, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Edison officials discovered the problem bolts earlier this 
year during an inspection of the reactor core during refueling at Unit 1. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Cook, the NRC's Western Region spokesman, said Southern California Edison 
officials want to delay repairs because they would require removing all the 
fuel from the reactor core at a time when storage space for the spent material 
is scarce at Unit 1.

<P>
Coronado police are seeking a man in connection with a series of sexual attacks 
against several women in their homes over the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
In one assault, the intruder entered the home through an unlocked door. In the 
other, he entered through a second-story window, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The man tried to rape the women in each attack, but was fought off and fled, 
police said. He has struck at random spots in Coronado, police said. 
</P>
<P>
All the attacks have occurred either late at night or early in the morning in 
homes where a woman lives without a husband or male companion. 
</P>
<P>
The assailant is described as being in his 20s, 6 feet tall and weighing 200 
pounds. Witnesses told police that the man wears military work clothing, 
including a light blue denim shirt, blue pants and work gloves.

<P>
San Diego police arrested a 32-year-old man Friday in connection with four bank 
robberies over the last six weeks, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Using a Nevada license plate number given to them by a witness to one of the 
robberies, detectives found a parked car believed to have been used in the 
robberies, police spokesman Bill Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Allen Chandler of San Diego was arrested about noon as he came out of 
the Home Depot in the 6600 block of University Avenue, Robinson said. 
Chandler's brother-in-law, who was with him, was questioned and released. 
</P>
<P>
Police later searched Chandler's home in the 3600 block of 42nd Street and 
found $3,800 in cash and firearms, including a semiautomatic rifle and a 
9-millimeter automatic pistol, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler was turned over to the FBI and is being held in the downtown 
Metropolitan Correctional Center. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said Chandler is also suspected in eight bank holdups in Colorado and 
four in Los Angeles.

<P>
A man convicted of shooting a "Good Samaritan" who stopped to offer him a ride 
was sentenced Friday to life plus 11 years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Manuel Brito, 25, was given the term for his conviction March 3 of 
premeditated attempted murder, which carries a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Smith, 27, a San Diego Park and Recreation Department employee, 
testified that he offered Brito a ride Aug. 12 when he saw him walking on 
Interstate 94 at Euclid Avenue with a gas can. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said Brito fired a shot that struck Smith in the back, then stole his 
1981 Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Superior Court Judge Ross Tharp also imposed a consecutive 11-year 
term because Brito stole the car. Brito was convicted of burglary in 1983, and 
later of grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
Tharp described Brito as "a serious danger to society." 
</P>
<P>
Brito's attorney, William Saunders, said afterward that Brito probably won't 
become eligible for parole until after he serves 15 to 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also ordered Brito to pay back $3,500 to Smith from his prison 
earnings for stealing the car, which was recovered after it had been stripped. 
</P>
<P>
Smith testified that Brito, whom he had never seen before, demanded all his 
money when pointing the gun at him. He said Brito shot without warning. 
</P>
<P>
Smith ran to a nearby gas station and was hospitalized 10 days. He did not 
suffer permanent injury.

A MORE HONEST APPROACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congress is challenging President Bush regarding the funding for his plan to 
bail out the ailing savings and loan industry, and a welcome challenge it is. 
The House Ways and Means Committee has adopted a proposal that would save 
taxpayers an estimated $4.5 billion over the next 30 years. And it has the 
additional virtue of dealing more directly and more honestly with the deficit 
in the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
The congressional action has drawn a threat of presidential veto from Treasury 
Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who seems more concerned with preserving an 
illusion of reducing federal costs than in the real savings inherent in the 
congressional plan. Brady is right in sticking firmly to the strict financial 
rules proposed in the original savings and loan bailout plan that he devised 
for the Bush Administration. But he is wrong in hiding the plan's real cost. 
</P>
<P>
Some Republicans as well as the great majority of the Democrats in Congress 
want to place the bailout where it belongs, on the budget, for everyone to see, 
even though it would immediately pose a problem in meeting the mandates of the 
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation on reducing the deficit. The implication is 
that the President would be faced with revenue needs at a time when he insists 
that there is no need for additional revenue. 
</P>
<P>
But the Bush proposal would cost more, not less, no matter how he conjures the 
bookkeeping. Brady has proposed funding the bailout by creating a new entity 
that would issue its own bonds to raise the funds, a maneuver that keeps the 
transaction off budget. In the long run, however, the taxpayers would end up 
paying more, not less.

'BIG OIL' IS ALL OF US; 
</P>
<P>
A NATION OF GAS GUZZLERS CAN'T BLAME THE SUPPLIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN McCARTHY, Colman McCarthy writes a syndicated column in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was lively theater -- but not much more -- when a member of Congress stood 
in the well of the House the other day and scissored in half his Exxon credit 
card. It was heady populism -- but not much more -- when some talk-radio 
babblers called for a boycott of Exxon. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from a few satisfying moments of stick-it-to-the-bums glee, these attacks 
on Exxon the oil spiller do little to protect the world from the next 
blackening, in Alaska or wherever. 
</P>
<P>
What does a boycott accomplish? Don't fill up at the Exxon gas station but 
drive down the street to Amoco? That's the company guilty of Europe's worst oil 
spill when its Amoco Cadiz came apart off the coast of Brittany in 1978. Or 
perhaps instead of Exxon, boycotters should buy from Unocal? It was 20 years 
ago this spring that one of Union Oil's offshore rigs broke and blackened the 
beaches of Santa Barbara, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
I went to Santa Barbara in May, 1969, to write about the spill. Boycott fervor 
was in the air then, too. Union was vilified by a citizens' group, GOO (Get Oil 
Out). 
</P>
<P>
Big oil didn't get out -- not out of the Santa Barbara Channel, nor Prince 
William Sound, nor Antarctica's Palmer Peninsula where 250,000 gallons of oil 
were spilled last January. 
</P>
<P>
To be meaningful, a boycott of all oil companies would be needed. The 
congressman-showman who snipped his Exxon credit card would have been credible 
had he announced, say, that he was cutting in half his personal consumption of 
oil or was taking public transportation or commuting by bicycle to work or 
insulating his home, or was pushing for heat-tight buildings back in his home 
district where he rents office space. 
</P>
<P>
Energy conservation and energy efficiency is the only boycott that oil 
companies respect, because it's the only one that can last beyond the latest 
post-spill furor. If a nation's habits of consumption are radically changed, 
the oil industry's habits of production are forced to change also. 
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace magazine reports this month that "the United States loses more 
energy each year through poorly engineered windows than is provided by all the 
oil flowing through the Alaska pipeline." 
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups have deep wells of information to prove that America can 
save more oil than it can produce or import. The ability to change cars from 
gas guzzlers to gas sippers has been demonstrated. In 1973 automobile 
efficiency was an inefficient 14 miles per gallon. Two years later federal 
standards were passed and the efficiency doubled to 28 m.p.g. by 1987. The 
technology is available to increase it to 45 m.p.g. by 1995, which would 
eventually more than eliminate the need to import any oil at all. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing has been said by George Bush since the Alaska spill about rallying the 
country to conservation or efficiency. The former Texas oil man doesn't think 
that way. When he was vice president, Bush's Task Force on Regulatory Relief 
tried to repeal the 1975 fuel-efficiency standards. Congress refused, but did, 
as a compromise, weaken them. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the President promoting conservation and efficiency, his Department 
of Interior is advancing proposals for exploiting coastal oil off Washington, 
Oregon and Florida, as well as in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Of seven 
industrial nations, the United States ranks last in the percentage of income 
devoted to energy-conservation research. 
</P>
<P>
If oil were an illegal drug, the United States would be the world's sorriest 
addict. It has 5% of the Earth's population but consumes 25% of its energy. 
</P>
<P>
The high from this addiction is so pleasurable that only a few politicians dare 
advance the conservation ethic. A member of Congress who called on Americans, 
let's say, to bicycle to work would be as ridiculed as Jimmy Carter was when he 
asked citizens to lower their thermostats. 
</P>
<P>
When freebasing, whether on crack or oil, addicts lose touch with reality. Now 
the Exxon addicts are announcing that they are changing dealers, as if becoming 
an Amoco addict is the answer. It's not. A boycott high, apparently, has some 
of the same thrill as an oil high. And the same downer after.

A LOYAL CHINA HAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forty years ago China's long civil war effectively ended with a military 
triumph by Mao Tse-tung's Communist forces. Newly installed in Beijing, Mao 
demanded international recognition of his regime as China's legitimate 
government. The United States was among the countries that refused. The last 
American official to leave China was a foreign-service officer named O. Edmund 
Clubb, who returned to Washington to serve as head of the State Department's 
China desk. Within a year, however, Clubb found himself suspended and accused 
of being a security risk. Two years later, cleared of all allegations but 
nonetheless shunted aside to a meaningless job, he resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Clubb was one of a number of talented specialists on China who were forced out 
of government in the eruption of inquisitorial hysteria, suspicion and 
fabricated charges that followed the defeat of Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists 
and, less than a year later, the invasion of South Korea by the Communist 
north. They included John Paton Davies Jr., John S. Service and John Carter 
Vincent, all of whom had extensive service in China. The chief sin attributed 
to these old China hands was that for many years, in Clubb's case from the 
early 1930s on, they had accurately reported that the Communists were steadily 
gaining popular support as Chiang's regime proved to be increasingly corrupt, 
brutal and inefficient. Diplomats who should have been hailed for their 
prescience were instead accused in the catchword of the day of "losing China," 
as if China had in any way ever been America's to dispose of. 
</P>
<P>
Victims of a gross injustice, the purged China experts saw careers ruined and 
incomes lost. But even worse was the harm done the nation, first by the denial 
of their services and subsequently by the timid conformity their fate imposed 
on others who stayed in government. At a minimum, their retained expertise 
could have helped significantly to deepen U.S. policy-makers' understanding of 
China in the turbulent 1950s and '60s. It's even possible that some major 
mistakes might have been avoided, among them perhaps the development of the 
strategic rationale that had the United States fighting in Vietnam in an effort 
to block Chinese expansionism to the south. Had they remained in government the 
China experts could have reminded their masters that rather than being natural 
allies China and Vietnam were in fact historic and bitter national enemies. 
</P>
<P>
O. Edmund Clubb died this week at the age of 88. He served his nation honorably 
as a diplomat and later as a scholar and teacher. With others, in a painful 
time when ignorance and vengefulness were allowed to ride high, he was scorned 
and punished. Like others, he has long since been vindicated.

A DOCTOR UP TO THE TASK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. C. Everett Koop put public health before politics as the nation's surgeon 
general, and President Bush should keep that example in mind as he seeks a 
replacement. Koop, who announced last week that he would leave his post in 
July, provided much needed leadership in educating the public about acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome and the health hazards of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
It was on AIDS that Koop's leadership was both timely and bold. The nation's 
top doctor, he insisted on the importance of early sex education about AIDS and 
advocated the use of condoms to reduce the spread of the virus. He spoke 
bluntly on the issue at a time when many in the Reagan Administration either 
wanted to pretend it would go away or to blame the victims, many of whom are 
homosexual men. As Jeff Levi of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force put it, 
Koop helped transform public discussion of AIDS "from moral judgment to public 
health." 
</P>
<P>
We did not always agree with Koop. He continued to speak out against abortion. 
He did, however, argue that there was not enough scientific information on the 
physical and psychological impact of abortions on women to write a report that 
President Reagan sought. Koop also defended the Reagan Administration rules 
that brought the federal government into treatment of deformed babies, a matter 
that should be strictly left to doctors and the infants' parents. 
</P>
<P>
Not since the days of the earliest surgeon general's report on smoking has that 
issue had the government-sanctioned visibility that Koop has given it. He 
warned that smoking kills some people and cautioned that people are at risk 
even if they don't smoke but inhale other people's tobacco smoke. He called for 
a smokeless society by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
A White House source said the Bush Administration has a litmus test for the 
next surgeon general. "The President couldn't take the heat if he appointed 
anybody pro-choice" on the abortion issue, the source said. It would be far 
more fitting if Bush used scientific judgment as a litmus test for the job of 
surgeon general. Koop passed that test; his successor should, too.

CONTROVERSY OVER KOREAN WAR MEMORIAL SITE IN SAN PEDRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It now appears that a proposed Korean War memorial will not be placed near the 
Korean Friendship Bell at Angels Gate Park in San Pedro. The reason for this is 
that many people are opposed to the warlike nature of the proposed sculpture, 
which depicts larger-than-life soldiers in fighting stances and positions with 
their weapons in a simulated battle scene. These people say that such a 
memorial would glorify war and destory the peaceful nature of the bell and 
surrounding park. 
</P>
<P>
The bell was given by the government and people of South Korea as an expression 
of friendship to the government and people of the United States on the occasion 
of our 1976 Bicentennial. The bell is truly a wonderful gift and a fitting 
symbol of the good will and harmony between our two nations. 
</P>
<P>
However, I wonder how many people ever give thought to how it was that a free, 
sovereign and friendly South Korea existed in 1976 to give such a gift to this 
country. It is only because nearly 40 years ago American soldiers and Marines, 
along with South Koreans, British and other United Nations troops, took up the 
fighting stances and weapons that the proposed sculpture depicts and accepted 
the hardships, injuries, death and all the horrors of war in order to keep 
South Korea a free and independent nation. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose it is more pleasant to think only of the bell and its peaceful 
surroundings, and not have to be reminded that men once left their homes, and 
all that was dear to them, to fight a war that made it possible for people 
today to enjoy the beauty of the bell in its peaceful setting. Yes, peace is a 
wonderful thing, and people talk about it as if it is a very natural and 
permanent part of life. And war, and guns, and fighting are awful things, and 
have nothing whatsoever to do with peace. 
</P>
<P>
The reality, however, is that the peace and freedom that people enjoy today are 
here because people yesterday fought for them. No one wants to glorify war, but 
neither should we forget that men fought and died to ensure that there would be 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
It is regrettable that the Korean War memorial will not be placed in close 
proximity to the bell, because there is a powerful and symbolic connection 
between the two. But I say that the Korean War memorial, wherever it will 
eventually be placed, should be as the veterans who fought that war want it, so 
that people will look upon it and understand what men had to do those long 
years ago that made it possible for a free South Korea and the gift of its bell 
to exist today.

PROTECTING TELEPHONE ANONYMITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gary T. Marx ("When Anonymity of Caller Is Lost, We're That Closer to a 
Surveillance Society," Op-Ed Page, May 3) writes that a system that displays a 
caller's telephone number to his would-be receiver before he answers it is a 
mixed blessing. One of its problems, he argues, is that sometimes it's good for 
society that a caller knows he can be anonymous. He writes approvingly of a 
plan that would allow callers to block display of their numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps telephone anonymity sometimes is socially helpful. Most of the time, 
however, it isn't. For many of us, evening may too often be a time when we run 
a gauntlet of harassing cranks, telemarketers, bill collectors, and others who 
invade our privacy, with telephones that we, not incidentally, have paid for. 
Since, given the opportunity, these are precisely the people who would choose 
to remain anonymous, a system that allows them to do this is fatally flawed to 
begin with. 
</P>
<P>
What about callers to counseling hot lines and others for whom anonymity serves 
a genuinely useful purpose? They could be protected by regulations prohibiting 
the use of caller identification devices. This would be easy to enforce 
because, like call forwarding or call waiting, the telephone company must patch 
the subscriber's line into special switching equipment. 
</P>
<P>
For the rest of us, however, a system that forces the caller to be responsible 
for his actions by stripping away his anonymity is a long overdue development. 
When someone rings my doorbell, I can look through the peephole and decide 
whether I want to answer it. There is no good reason that I shouldn't be able 
to look at a display screen and make the same judgment when someone rings my 
telephone.

VERDICT IN NORTH'S IRAN-CONTRA TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Philip Lacovara presents an intellectually seductive review of history and the 
law in support of his thesis that Judge Gesell was remiss in seeming to 
overlook the special rules that exempt members of the military from having to 
examine too closely the legality of orders from their commanders ("A Case of 
Missing Prologues," Editorial Page, May 6). Unfortunately, Lacovara's argument 
fails to take the facts of the situation into account. 
</P>
<P>
North, albeit a member of the Marine Corps, did not find himself on a 
battlefield facing enemy fire when he so willingly set up a shadow government 
run from the White House basement. Neither his life nor that of anyone around 
him was in immediate danger when he agreed to lie to Congress. No split-second 
decisions were needed in taking on the Reagan-Casey mandate to subvert the 
Boland Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
North certainly had enough time, at the outset or any other point in his 
zealous operations, to reflect, consult others and obtain advice as to the 
legality or even just the advisability of his international machinations. 
Lacovara has done a serious disservice in assuming that the very knotty problem 
of morality and ethics in wartime applies to North in Washington, D.C.

VERDICT IN NORTH'S IRAN-CONTRA TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The North verdict confirmed that the diversion of funds from Iranian arms sales 
was not just the harebrained inspiration of an off-the-wall lieutenant colonel 
who chose to keep his superiors in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Iran-Contra was the result of two very unique personalities, Oliver 
North and Ronald Reagan. North frequently acted like a disciple of Inspector 
Clouseau, who had the misfortune to stumble upon "the Great Communicator." We 
know from President Reagan's press conferences, and from accounts of former 
officials in his Administration, that his strong points did not include 
unrehearsed articulation of complex issues, and that his management style could 
best be described as "hands-off." 
</P>
<P>
Iran-Contra was the likely result of a series of rambling "body language" 
meetings among Reagan's inner-circle, including North, about such issues as the 
plight of the hostages, the communist threat in Central America, Freedom 
Fighters, and our wimpy Congress. From these meetings emerged the preposterous 
plan to sell a deadly enemy some of our most lethal and advanced weapons. This 
probably triggered North's globe-trotting activities, and left him with the 
belief that his antics had the approval of higher-ups, and consequently carried 
the force of law. It is pretty obvious that North could not have diverted 
Iran-Contra funds without heavy-hitter support. 
</P>
<P>
We should be more concerned with President Bush's next move than with North's. 
</P>
<P>
While Ollie is not deserving of much sympathy, he was probably set up by 
individuals many rungs above him, and consequently should be pardoned. As uch 
of an affront as this might be tosome Americans, it is even more of an affront 
to the entire nation to punish an underling for lousy and naive judgment, while 
looking the other way as to the real kingpins.

<TEXT>
<P>
The seldom mentioned fact that North's acts, deeds and operations were covert 
is the crux of the entire situation. This simply means he cannot reveal all the 
facts -- to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Covert operations are a vital part of the nation's intelligence lifeline. 
Having established that fact, do you really think a mere lieutenant colonel, 
who in this situation, is the low man on the totem pole with many superiors, 
acted on his own? He reported to those superiors when he carried out orders. 
</P>
<P>
Can you imagine telling a secret to Congress? Or any congressman? When you're 
dealing with the national interest and security, some classified information 
does not belong to everyone, not even Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad President Reagan didn't pardon North. There would have been an initial 
flap and flurry but it would have blown over and he'd still be the popular past 
President and the country would be better for it. 
</P>
<P>
But this way, Reagan has left everyone with an unhappy legacy. Especially 
North, the pawn, the scapegoat, the fall guy.

<P>
By offering a device that would identify a caller, we are taking one more step 
toward the day when our lives are monitored totally by Big Brother. 
</P>
<P>
This plan would almost negate the benefits afforded by having an unlisted 
telephone number and possibly subject telephone users to a rash of unwanted 
solicitations. I feel that there should be public hearings conducted by the 
Public Utilities Commission, so that everyone may have the opportunity of 
airing their opinions and that we are able to carefully weigh all the aspects 
of such a program. 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that being able to identify a caller has many benefits, 
particularly in the case of obscene, crank calls and overzealous salesmen. 
However, the price we pay in our loss of privacy may be too great. The 
telephone has been a wonderful invention that has greatly enhanced our lives, 
but it can also be an intrusive method to deprive us of privacy and anonymity. 
Some safeguards must be offered before we are able to reap the benefits of this 
system.

I feel that Marx has overlooked the most positive aspects of this welcomed 
feature. Realistically, many residences cannot afford or would not be 
interested in spending more money to know who is calling them. This decision is 
left to the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
Marx failed to point out the advantages of medical and business uses of knowing 
the origin of incoming calls. A loved one or any elderly person could have a 
life saved in the event of a medical emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Businesses would benefit by being able to route a call to the proper service 
person or department instantly. 
</P>
<P>
If Marx contends that calling a spouse from somewhere other than work is a 
reason to hinder a potential life-saving capability, he needn't worry about 
receiving phone calls anyway.

NORTHROP'S STEALTH BOMBER MARKS A CRUCIAL MILESTONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Northrop fired up the B-2 stealth bomber's engines for first time late Thursday 
night in Palmdale, a technically important, if long overdue, milestone in the 
controversial and costly aircraft program, it was learned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The engine test is an important step toward the first flight of the new bomber, 
a so-called flying wing that lacks a conventional fuselage. The first flight is 
already about a year and a half behind the original schedule and some four 
months past the date set by the Air Force only last November. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Four Engines Started 
</P>
<P>
Aeronautics experts said Northrop will need a minimum of another 30 days to 
complete engine testing, if everything goes perfectly, before attempting 
flight. Owing to the craft's radical design, some skeptics say it may not be 
airworthy. 
</P>
<P>
The nuclear bomber's four General Electric F-118 jet engines, which each 
generate about 19,000 pounds of thrust, were started inside a large engine test 
facility, according to employees. Later, Northrop officially confirmed that the 
test had been conducted. 
</P>
<P>
Another industry source said, "All four engines ran, and things went well." 
</P>
<P>
The critical test had been repeatedly delayed in recent days and on Thursday 
had been scheduled for early and then late afternoon, the sources said. 
Finally, they added, engineers started the engines late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Congress has been scrutinizing each delay in the bomber program, and the 
successful test is encouraging at a critical time for Northrop. 
</P>
<P>
The B-2 cost has been spiraling upward rapidly. Only last week, Air Force Chief 
Gen. Larry C. Welch said that, because of delays caused by budget constraints, 
the cost had jumped another $3 billion to about $74 billion to build 132 of the 
planes -- $560 million each. 
</P>
<P>
But congressional sources say that even the $74-billion figure is based on 
"highly optimistic" assumptions that everything will go perfectly in the 
testing and production program. Numbers as high as $650 million to $700 million 
per aircraft are being considered as more realistic estimates. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the $74-billion cost estimate assumes that the research and 
development cost will not increase further than it already has. It also assumes 
that the Pentagon will have "significant budget resources" to devote to rapid 
B-2 production, meaning more than $4 billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
A Northrop spokesman said Friday that bombers will cost $265 million each, not 
including the development costs and future inflation that are part of the 
higher cost estimates being quoted by the Air Force. "If you reduce the 
production rate, the cost goes up," Tony Cantafio said. "You could call it 
pay-as-you-slow." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Costello, undersecretary of defense for acquisition, said in an 
interview Thursday that, as the cost of the B-2 approaches $700 million each, 
it begins to look unaffordable. He confirmed assertions by Rep. Les Aspin 
(D-Wis.) that the cost of the program is headed toward $75 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"That's as good a figure as I've seen to date, but it may go higher," Costello, 
a holdover from the Reagan Administration who left his job Friday, said. "The 
role of this office is to say at some point, 'Hey, boss, is it too expensive?' 
I've just raised the warning flag." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deciding on Cuts 
</P>
<P>
The cost increases are driven by two factors: technical problems and budget 
shortages, both of which cause delays. Each delay drives up the cost of the 
overall program, which threatens a cutback in the rate of production. In turn, 
the rate cutbacks drive up the cost per aircraft, leading to a vicious circle 
of escalating costs. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional committees will be marking up the fiscal 1990 budgets next month 
and will decide how large a cut to make in the B-2 budget. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney submitted a budget last month that cut the 
program by $885 million in 1990 and $3.2 billion in 1991. Although he did not 
disclose current funding, the sharp reductions mean that the program will not 
go into full-scale production. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the Air Force has moved to offset criticism of the bomber by 
increasingly declassifying its technical capabilities while continuing to keep 
secret the budget details. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force Gen. Bernard P. Randolph said the B-2 will be capable of carrying a 
nuclear or conventional payload of 50,000 pounds. He said it has a range of 
6,000 nautical miles at high altitude without refueling.

GOOD NEWS ON INFLATION SENDS STOCKS UP 56.82 TO POST-CRASH HIGH OF 2,439.70 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

NEW YORK

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Elated by better-than-expected inflation news, investors raced into the stock 
market Friday, triggering the strongest rally in nearly a year and lifting the 
Dow Jones index 56.82 points to its highest point since the October, 1987, 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
The surge began at the opening bell, after the government reported that 
wholesale prices rose only 0.4% in April. The increase, below an expected 0.7% 
to 0.9%, prompted a decline in interest rates and buoyed hopes that inflation 
has moderated. 
</P>
<P>
"People came in prepared to buy stocks cheap on bad news," said Michael Metz, 
managing director and market analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co., a New York 
investment bank. "But (the economic news) created a great sense of urgency." 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average reached 2,439.70, well ahead of the previous 
post-crash high of 2,418.99 on April 27. The gain was the biggest for a single 
day since the average leaped 74.63 points on May 31, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blue Chips Strong 
</P>
<P>
Analysts pointed to solid gains across the board, but particularly in blue chip 
stocks. Issues that advanced outnumbered declining stocks by a ratio of about 
10 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,214 issues up, 353 down and 408 
unchanged. Big Board trading was heavy, with more than 221 million shares 
changing hands. 
</P>
<P>
"We do have an institutional buying rampage," said Eugene E. Peroni Jr., 
director of technical research for Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, 
shortly before the market's close. 
</P>
<P>
"Portfolio managers . . . might not have any real conviction with the market, 
but they are being pressured to make commitments," Peroni said. "Managers are 
throwing up their hands and saying, 'We have to have equities.' " 
</P>
<P>
"If you consider the longer-term trend in the market, it has been very 
positively biased. This suggests the market is looking ahead toward a brighter 
economic outlook." 
</P>
<P>
Both Peroni and Metz said they expect the market to continue its upward march 
next week, with Metz anticipating a further rise of 100 points and Peroni 
expecting a gain of 60 to 90 points. 
</P>
<P>
However, others noted that investors' attention would shift to the April 
Consumer Price Report, due next Thursday, for confirmation of the moderate 
inflation indicated by Friday's wholesale price report. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding a 7.2% rise in energy prices, the report would have shown a decline 
in April wholesale prices. 
</P>
<P>
Optimism that the Federal Reserve would ease up on interest rates in light of 
the favorable producer price index report prompted simultaneous rallies in the 
stock and bond markets, noted Ronald Reuss, an economist for Piper Capital 
Management in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
"People are getting out of their short-term money market positions and are 
buying longer-term bonds and stocks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Reuss cautioned that, if interest rates drop too quickly, inflation could once 
again heat up, making the market uneasy again. However, he added, "I think the 
Fed will remain relatively tight until it's sure the economy is slowing 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
Friday's boost in the Dow industrial average accounted almost solely for the 
week's overall rise of 57.74. 
</P>
<P>
Consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades on regional 
exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 261.42 million shares 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000 actively traded 
stocks, the market rose $55.32 billion, or 1.82%, in value. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks jumped 3.42 to 
175.13. 
</P>
<P>
Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 7.40 to 360.88, and S&amp;P's 
500-stock composite index closed 6.89 higher at 313.84. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NASDAQ, Amex Up 
</P>
<P>
The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose 4.20 to 434.83. 
The American Stock Exchange's market value index closed at 348.30, up 2.68. 
American Stock Exchange volume totaled 14 million shares, up from 9.2 million 
Thursday, with 396 issues advancing, 210 declining and 257 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, IBM rose $1.625 to $110.75, Motorola 
gained $2.25 to $50.625, General Electric advanced $2 to $51, and American 
Express jumped $2.25 to $34. 
</P>
<P>
Eastman Kodak fell 50 cents to $42.75, Northwest Airlines dropped 75 cents to 
$102.25, and Newmont Mining slid $2.375 to 39.25. 
</P>
<P>
The savings and loan sector, which stands to benefit from lower interest rates, 
was at the rally's forefront. H. F. Ahmanson rose 75 cents to close at $20, 
Great Western Financial gained $1.125 to $19.125, and Golden West Financial 
added $1.75 to $45. And Federal National Mortgage Assn. leaped $3.375 to 
$73.25. 
</P>
<P>
Utility stocks also gained on optimism about interest rates, with Pacific Gas 
&amp; Electric rising 87.5 cents to $19.625. 
</P>
<P>
Viacom, which was sued Thursday by Paramount Pictures over a five-year movie 
agreement, lost $1.25 to $51.75.

'JUNK BOND' ISSUE BY RJR IS SNAPPED UP; 
</P>
<P>
$4-BILLION SALE GOES BETTER THAN EXPECTED 
</P>

<P>
RJR Nabisco Inc.'s $4-billion "junk bond" sale, the largest such public 
offering in history, sold out Friday as buyers snapped up securities that had 
been priced low enough to assure demand. 
</P>
<P>
Registrations of the mammoth issue were also declared effective by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission, meaning the securities could be traded. "It 
seems that almost everyone wants a piece of the action," said one junk bond 
trader, noting that the bonds had moved better than some had expected. 
</P>
<P>
The registration was so large that it immediately doubled the underwriter 
Drexel Burnham Lambert's share of the high-yield, high-risk junk bond market 
for the year. Drexel's share jumped to 50.2% from 21.5%, according to 
Securities Data Co. 
</P>
<P>
Nabisco, maker of Ritz crackers and Oreo cookies, went private last year in a 
record $24.7-billion leveraged buyout. The company, bought by LBO specialists 
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., is now working to pay back the $23 billion 
it borrowed for the deal. 
</P>
<P>
The five tranches, or installments, in the offering were selling at near the 
bonds' par value, or higher, traders said, reflecting the strength of demand. 
Typical buyers in such offerings are thrifts, insurance firms, high-yield funds 
and money managers. 
</P>
<P>
The Friday offering is part of an $8-billion securities package. Analysts and 
traders said the bond sale will probably be considered a benchmark in the 
nearly $190-billion junk bond market. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Solid Credit Risk 
</P>
<P>
Drexel, lead manager of the offering, priced RJR Nabisco's offering late 
Thursday. Merrill Lynch Capital Markets co-managed the deal, which has five 
installments. The formal name of the issuer is RJR Holdings Capital Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Investors are scooping up the debt issue because RJR is regarded as a solid 
credit risk, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is one of the strongest companies around in terms of resisting a 
recession," said Tom Razukas, high-yield analyst with McCarthy Crisanti Maffei 
Inc. "Historically, food sales are not hurt during economic downturns. People 
still have to eat." 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of confidence in the RJR Nabisco deal," said Michael Dahoud, a 
high-yield analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. "The company has 
recession-proof businesses, there are indications of a lot of interest in the 
assets RJR is planning to sell, and Kohlberg Kravis has a good track record in 
leveraged buyouts." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, RJR has a wide arsenal of products, such as Winston, Salem and 
Camel cigarettes, an array of baked goods and the Del Monte, Planters and Life 
Savers brands. 
</P>
<P>
All of the debt securities are rated B-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and 
B-plus by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. Some of the coupons were raised from 
initially expected levels to attract and win over investors, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The mammoth size and complex pricing of the RJR issue drove yields well above 
the levels Drexel initially expected, analysts said.

FIRMS SUE AGENCY TO GAIN CONTROL OF LINCOLN SAVINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Claiming that federal regulators had no legal right to seize Irvine-based 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, the thrift and its parent company Friday filed suit 
to regain possession and control of Lincoln's operations. 
</P>
<P>
In suits filed separately by Lincoln and American Continental Corp., attorneys 
claim that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board exceeded its authority by putting 
the S&amp;L in a conservatorship April 14. 
</P>
<P>
The suits ask the U.S. District Court in Washington to remove the conservator 
-- the bank board's Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. unit. 
</P>
<P>
"The conduct by the government in this case was outrageous," said Donald B. 
Craven, one of American Continental's Washington lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
The takeover of Lincoln came a day after Phoenix-based American Continental 
filed a U.S. Bankruptcy Court petition for protection from creditors while it 
reorganized under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws. 
</P>
<P>
The bank board said it seized Lincoln because the parent firm was dissipating 
the S&amp;L's $5.3 billion in assets and operating it in an "unsafe and 
unsound" manner. 
</P>
<P>
But American Continental and Lincoln claim in their lawsuits that the statutory 
conditions for appointing a conservator did not exist at the time of the 
takeover. The primary requirements permitting a regulatory seizure are the 
insolvency of the institution or a finding that it is being operated in an 
"unsafe and unsound" manner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Delays Weakened S&amp;L 
</P>
<P>
They also accuse the bank board of acting in bad faith in examining Lincoln's 
financial condition for the last few years and in unreasonably stalling the 
proposed sale of the S&amp;L to a group headed by former U.S. Rep. John H. 
Rousselot. 
</P>
<P>
Delays in reviewing the Rousselot sale, along with public disclosures of the 
S&amp;L's condition, financially weakened the S&amp;L and American Continental, 
according to the suit. The delays also made the S&amp;L and its parent 
suspicious that the board was trying to force the company "to take some action, 
such as filing for bankruptcy, that could serve as a pretext for placing 
Lincoln in conservatorship," the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
A bank board executive denied the general allegations contained in Friday's 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the facts will support the actions we've taken," said Karl T. 
Hoyle, a bank board spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Hoyle said the board was "more than fair" because it threw out a critical 
report on a two-year examination of Lincoln's financial condition so a new team 
of examiners could take "an independent look." 
</P>
<P>
He also said the bank board met "up to the 11th hour" with Rousselot but that 
the former congressman's group was "short on one simple item without which we 
can't do a deal, and that's called cash." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuits, though, claim that the bank board was not an impartial decision 
maker in the last examination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Shocked' by Comments 
</P>
<P>
Persistent leaks by regulators of confidential information about the S&amp;L's 
financial condition, the suits say, injured the S&amp;L and demonstrated the 
bank board's bad faith. 
</P>
<P>
At a breakfast meeting on March 17, the suit states, Rousselot and "an ACC 
representative" were "shocked" to hear comments made by Roger Martin, one of 
the three bank board members. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said the application to buy Lincoln had to be "as attractive as 
possible" because the bank board's staff was pushing the board to put Lincoln 
into conservatorship, according to the suits. 
</P>
<P>
Though Martin said he hoped a sale could be approved, "he acknowledged that it 
would be politically expedient for the board to bow to staff pressure and to 
establish a conservatorship," the suits say. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, who is not named individually as a defendant, could not be reached 
Friday for comment.

Reservation System Breaks Down: The computerized reservation system for 
American Airlines failed for nearly 12 hours, hindering flight scheduling for 
the airline's passengers around the world. John Hotard, a spokesman for the Ft. 
Worth-based airline, said the Sabre II computer reservation network went down 
shortly after midnight and was reactivated just before noon Friday. The 
computer network, based in an underground bunker in Tulsa, Okla., drives 
American Airlines' computerized reservations system worldwide and provides 
services to more than 14,000 other entities, including car rental companies, 
hotels and a third of all U.S. travel agencies. There was no immediate 
explanation for the failure.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: PUT SAVINGS BONDS IN KIDS' NAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Carla Lazzareschi 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Currently I buy U.S. savings bonds through a payroll savings plan at work. I'm 
buying them in my name, but they are eventually intended to cover the cost of 
sending my two young children to college. Please explain the pros and cons of 
purchasing these bonds in my name or in my children's. I am in the 28% tax 
bracket and do not plan on cashing in the bonds for about another 12 years. -- 
R. V. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: According to our advisers, you would be better off -- at least through 
1989 -- buying the savings bonds in the names of your two children. How you 
treat the interest that these bonds accumulate depends on how much unearned 
income your kids receive each year. 
</P>
<P>
If they receive less than $500 annually, including the bonds' interest, you 
should declare that income annually. Children under age 14 are entitled to keep 
the first $500 of their income, tax-free. 
</P>
<P>
Income between $500 and $1,000 is taxed at 15%, and income above $1,000 is 
taxed at the highest rate applicable to the parents. If your children, like 
most kids, have relatively small investment portfolios, they probably will end 
up not owing any taxes on the bond interest. 
</P>
<P>
However, if your kids have several investments and actually pay taxes, you 
should carefully evaluate whether the interest should be recognized each year, 
or if you should wait until you sell the bonds to deal with the taxes owed on 
the accumulated interest. You might want to consult a personal finance adviser 
for suggestions tailored to the child's specific holdings. 
</P>
<P>
You might also be interested in some pending changes affecting savings bonds 
that are purchased to finance college education. Beginning in 1990, interest 
earned on Series EE bonds issued after Dec. 31, 1989, can be free from federal 
taxation if they are redeemed to pay for college or vocational school. 
</P>
<P>
However, as you might expect, there are several restrictions. Bond buyers must 
be at least 24 years old. The tax break can be applied only to bond proceeds 
used for tuition and required school fees -- not books and room and board. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, it can be applied only to degree programs at colleges, 
universities and certain vocational schools. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the tax break can be used only by families and individuals meeting 
certain income standards. For couples filing jointly, a $90,000 adjusted gross 
income is the cutoff; for individual filers, the cutoff is an annual adjusted 
gross income of $55,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plan to Reduce Taxes Probably Won't Work 
</P>
<P>
Q: My wife and I have just sold an investment condominium in Cali fornia and 
were thinking of using the money to buy a retirement house out of state that we 
would move into in about three years. If we go ahead with this purchase, will 
it reduce any of the taxes we are responsible for from the sale of the condo? 
-- W. D .P. 
</P>
<P>
A: In theory, yes. But this strategy probably won't work for you. First of all, 
investment property, such as your rental condo or any other business-related 
real estate, is not treated like residential property when it comes to 
deferring taxes. When you sell your principal residence, you can defer all of 
some of your tax obligation by purchasing another home. But this is not true 
with investment real estate. 
</P>
<P>
The only way to defer your tax obligation on a gain generated by the sale of 
investment property is through what is known as a "Section 1031 exchange or 
trade of business property." Under these transactions, which are also called 
"Starker exchanges," you are allowed to trade the property you are selling for 
another piece of real estate through what is known as an "accommodator," or, in 
plain terms, a middleman. 
</P>
<P>
This accommodator, who acts independently of the buyer and seller, takes 
possession of the money and title for both the property sold and the property 
purchased, and then passes them on to their rightful owners. In order to have 
your transaction qualify as a true tax-deferred exchange, you may never take 
possession of any part of the money generated by the sale of your property. 
</P>
<P>
So, if you have taken possession of the proceeds from the sale of your condo, 
as your letter suggests, you are ineligible to take advantage of the 
tax-deferred exchange rules. For more information about these transactions, 
contact the Society of CPA Financial Planners at 1-800-445-7526. 
</P>
<P>
Another caveat: Exchanges are allowed for only like kinds of property, so your 
exchange would have to be for a piece of investment real estate. 
</P>
<P>
A condo could qualify as an investment property if you treat it as a rental for 
at least one year. After renting it for that period, you could move into it. 
However, be warned that the government frowns on overt attempts to avoid 
taxation. If the Internal Revenue Service should suspect that your efforts were 
so motivated you could be hit with a tax bill and potential penalties. Our tax 
advisers suggest that you use discretion when discussing your financial 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Think Twice Before Donating Stock 
</P>
<P>
Q: My daughter's school is holding a major fund-raising campaign and I am 
thinking of donating 50 shares of stock I hold in a utility company instead of 
giving cash. This type of donation strikes me on the surface as a smart move, 
since I would be credited for making a donation of the full fair market value 
of the stock but would only have an out-of-pocket expense of my initial cost of 
the shares. Can you evaluate the wisdom of my reasoning and tell me how I might 
actually execute such a donation? -- L. M. C. 
</P>
<P>
A: What you say is true, but it is hardly the whole story. Indeed, your 
our-of-pocket expense is only what you paid for the shares, and that could be 
considerably less than their current value. 
</P>
<P>
However, our advisers urge you to think more of what the shares are worth now 
-- and what they could be worth in the future -- than what they were worth at 
some point in time long since passed. By focusing on the past, you could be 
ignoring the potential of these shares to continue appreciating in value. Our 
advisers say the best candidates for donation to charity are shares whose value 
appears stagnant. 
</P>
<P>
Making the donation is an easy matter. Simply sign the stock certificate over 
to the charity. For tax purposes, your donation is valued at the fair market 
value of the shares on the date of the gift. You are allowed a deduction for 
the full value of the charitable contribution on your income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
However, be advised that you must declare as taxable income any amount the 
shares appreciated in value above your initial purchase price. In case you were 
thinking you got a free ride, you are not entitled to a deduction for a 
contribution of untaxed appreciated assets.

PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: HOW TO AVOID, RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH BROKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bill Sing

<TEXT>
<P>
Stock market investors, take at least a little bit of heart. New rules approved 
this week should make arbitrating disputes with brokers more fair and open. But 
these rules are no substitute for taking more care to avoid misunderstandings 
in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Arbitration cases between investors and brokers mushroomed in the 1982-1987 
bull market and continued to grow following the crash. Investors complained of 
everything from mishandling of orders, to misrepresentation of investment risk, 
to unauthorized trading. 
</P>
<P>
Investors have been required to resolve their beefs through arbitration instead 
of the courts because the industry contends that it is less costly and time 
consuming. But investors complain that arbitration panels operated by the New 
York and American stock exchanges and the National Assn. of Securities Dealers 
(NASD) are biased toward the industry. 
</P>
<P>
The process hasn't allowed investors to obtain enough information, and the 
results of proceedings were often kept under a shroud of secrecy, investor 
advocates have complained. 
</P>
<P>
These and other concerns prompted the Securities and Exchange Commission this 
week to unanimously approve new rules, effective in September, covering 
arbitration systems run by the exchanges and the NASD. One of the most 
important rule changes requires brokerages to clearly highlight and explain 
pre-dispute agreements that bind investors to use arbitration instead of 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
New rules also require arbitrators to disclose their employment history over 
the previous 10 years and take other steps to disclose possible conflicts or 
pro-industry bias. Brokers will be required to produce more documents, and 
investors may be allowed pre-hearing conferences or preliminary hearings in 
large or complex cases. Results of arbitration proceedings will be made public. 
</P>
<P>
The rules are an important step forward, but many investor attorneys and 
lawmakers say they don't go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
"They aren't a panacea for arbitration," says Theodore G. Eppenstein, a New 
York attorney who represents investors in arbitration cases. He and others want 
a ban on pre-dispute arbitration agreements, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
But that may be pie in the sky, at least for now. Given what you have to work 
with, here are some tips on how to better police your broker and take advantage 
of the new arbitration rules: 
</P>
<P>
* Shop carefully for a broker. Get referrals from friends or colleagues. 
Interview several brokers. Visit their offices. Ask for references of clients. 
Ask clients if the broker had ever executed unauthorized trades. 
</P>
<P>
Be sure a prospective broker tries to understand your investment preferences 
and goals. "If he or she immediately tries to sell you something before even 
finding out who you are, that means they are a product pusher," says Michael E. 
Friedman, a Pasadena attorney who represents investors in arbitrations. Avoid 
such brokers, he urges. 
</P>
<P>
* Don't assume you must sign the arbitration clause. Many brokerages don't 
require you to sign an arbitration clause if you are just trading on a cash 
basis (that is, you are not trading on margin using borrowed funds, or you are 
not trading stock options). 
</P>
<P>
See if you can cross off the arbitration clause while agreeing to the rest of 
the brokerage agreement, Friedman suggests. Or write in a clause that permits 
you the option of also using the American Arbitration Assn., a more expensive 
but less industry-biased arbitration service. However, if you do this, be sure 
to keep a copy of the form. 
</P>
<P>
* Don't allow your broker discretionary power over your account. A broker can 
make trades without your consent only if you grant power of attorney. In almost 
all cases, don't do this, Eppenstein advises. That is an invitation for an 
unscrupulous broker to churn your account. 
</P>
<P>
If you plan to be out of town but want your broker to keep an eye on your 
account, ask him or her to check with a family member before trading, 
Eppenstein suggests. 
</P>
<P>
* Take and keep detailed notes and records. Keep copies of all mailings from 
your broker. And keep a log of all orders you place, with the date and time, 
price and type of order. Compare that with your trade confirmations and account 
statements. If there is a discrepancy, write immediately to your broker and 
branch manager. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't rely on your broker's word that he will fix it," Eppenstein says. If you 
don't respond promptly, the brokerage will assume the statement is correct. 
</P>
<P>
You might also consider tape recording conversations with your broker. But make 
sure the broker knows you are doing this. Under most circumstances, it is 
illegal in California and many other states to record phone conversations 
without the other party's consent. 
</P>
<P>
* Conduct important business in writing. If you are making a complex or 
expensive transaction, don't just have your broker repeat back to you the 
terms. Send a letter confirming what you ordered, Friedman suggests. 
</P>
<P>
* Keep track of commissions. These usually are reported on your confirmation 
slips. But ask your broker periodically for a cumulative accounting of total 
commissions you are paying. 
</P>
<P>
* Ask to be kept up to date. Ask your broker to contact you if the value of 
your account falls 10% or 15%. "Don't wait for your monthly statement in order 
to find out if you're in trouble," Eppenstein says. "Put the onus on your 
broker to let you know what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
* Be wary of aggressive sales pitches. If your broker tries to sell you 
something you don't understand or that is inappropriate for you, beware. That 
type of broker may succumb to unauthorized trading or other misdeeds. 
</P>
<P>
If questionable trades occur more than once, get a new broker. Request in 
writing that the offending broker halt trading immediately, Friedman says. 
</P>
<P>
If your brokerage is unable to resolve your dispute and you have to go to 
arbitration, consider these steps: 
</P>
<P>
* Seek counsel if appropriate. For small cases you probably won't need an 
attorney. Cases of under $5,000 ($10,000 starting in September) can use small 
claims arbitration, a quicker and less costly route. But a key drawback is that 
there are no oral hearings. Each side simply presents its written case. 
</P>
<P>
For almost all cases involving losses of $50,000 or more, you will want to seek 
counsel. Try to get one that specializes in securities litigation. 
</P>
<P>
* Be prepared. Collect and organize documents. Find witnesses. Work to be 
credible. 
</P>
<P>
* Check the backgrounds of arbitrators. Ask attorneys or others who have had 
cases heard by your arbitrators. Check their backgrounds to make sure their law 
firms aren't representing the brokerage firm you are against. In proceedings 
before the exchanges and the NASD, you have the right to preempt one 
arbitrator, Friedman says. 
</P>
<P>
* Consider alternatives. Arbitrators working for the American Arbitration Assn. 
are less likely to have served the securities industry. 
</P>
<P>
However, the AAA won't be better in all circumstances. AAA's fees can cost as 
much as three times more than those charged by the exchanges or the NASD, 
Friedman notes. In cases of clear-cut and serious securities law violations, 
exchange or NASD arbitrators will be more familiar with the rules, he suggests.

Tandon Corp.: The Moorpark, Calif.-based computer company reported a loss of 
$9.9 million for the first quarter ended March 31, compared to a $7.16 million 
profit a year earlier. Tandon also reported that revenues rose 15% to $92.7 
million. Tandon said that 89% of overall first-quarter revenues were accounted 
for by sales of personal computer systems and subsystems in Europe, which 
remained its predominant market. Tandon attributed some of the loss to the 
scaling back of its of U.S. operations so that it could function more 
cost-effectively and to the strengthened value of the U.S. dollar against 
European currencies compared to the first quarter a year ago, translated into 
about $5 million fewer dollars earned.

BLOCKBUSTER BOYCOTT

<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the comment of Mark Hayden, marketing director of the Blockbuster 
Video chain, that "The Last Temptation of Christ" was "enough of an insult to 
our senses that we chose not to carry it" (Morning Report, May 10): To which 
senses does he refer? With video titles such as "Saturday Night Sleazies," "The 
Sadist" and "Rest in Pieces" currently available in Blockbuster stores, one can 
reasonably assume that those senses exclude taste, morality and intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
What my senses detect is an arbitrary and hypocritical censorship and 
spinelessness in the face of controversy.

Liska says O'Day's 1981 autobiography is "High Life, Hard Times." The correct 
title is "High Times, Hard Times" -- and to sensationalize O'Day's 
well-publicized battle with drugs is to do an incredible injustice to one of 
the true -- one of the only -- survivors of the swing era.

<P>
My husband and I have traveled in Chile twice in the last three years. Does 
that mean we are making (as it was put by Erik Nelson, former "Eye on L.A." 
producer) "a passive endorsement of what, at best, is a murky political 
situation"? Come on -- give me a break.

<P>
Using O'Day's age (almost 70) and her well-publicized personal problems against 
her is a cheap shot. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to what Liska writes, O'Day was never known for her "bell-clear" 
instrument. She never had a voice and is famous for that fact. She is also 
famous for not having any vibrato because her uvula was accidentally cut during 
throat surgery when she was a child. 
</P>
<P>
She's the first to admit that she's not a singer. She's a song stylist renowned 
for her timing and interpretation, and for that reason she's considered one of 
the four or five most important vocalists of the century.

YANKEES QUICKLY JUMP ON ABBOTT, CRUISE TO WIN; 
</P>
<P>
EARLIER RAINOUTS CAUSE ROOKIE TO DRAW HOT TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jesse Barfield, Tom Brookens and the rest of the New York Yankees had the 
greatest immediate impact on Jim Abbott's third major league defeat Friday 
night, but the seeds for the Angels' 5-2 loss at Anaheim Stadium were sown by 
the rainstorm that washed out last Sunday's game in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
One postponement led to another, the second being the postponement of Abbott's 
next start, which was supposed to have been Wednesday in Detroit against the 
floundering Tigers but wound up getting delayed until Friday against the 
recently resurgent Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Funny what two extra days can do to a guy. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of Pat Sheridan or Ken Williams or whoever Sparky Anderson is leading 
off these days, Abbott had to deliver his first pitches of the evening to 
Rickey Henderson. And by the time Abbott had finished pitching to Henderson, 
the Yankee left fielder had driven the baseball off the base of the wall in 
left-center for a double. He was soon to score on a sacrifice fly by Don 
Mattingly. 
</P>
<P>
Another Yankee run followed in the second inning, with Abbott loading the bases 
and Steve Sax singling off the glove of Angel third baseman Jack Howell. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, in the third inning, it all fell apart for Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
Barfield, who was a Toronto Blue Jay the last time the Angels played in 
Anaheim, opened the third with a home run, his seventh of the season and his 
third as a Yankee. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Balboni then singled, and one out later, Brookens sent his third home run 
of the season over the left-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott was down, 5-0, and two outs later, he was out of the game, his record on 
its way to 2-3. 
</P>
<P>
"He really seemed uptight tonight," Angel Manager Doug Rader said. "In all 
honesty, he didn't have his very best stuff. That 2-0 pitch to Barfield was 
kind of a goose ball, and he hit it out." 
</P>
<P>
A goose ball, apparently, is any pitch that makes a pitcher want to duck. In 
this case, Abbott reported it was a fastball, delivered too high and too 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
"I fell behind in the count and threw him a high fastball over the plate," 
Abbott said. "That's his pitch. You can't do that." 
</P>
<P>
This was the second time in less than a month that Abbott had been victimized 
by bad weather. In late April, he had a start rained out in Chicago, which 
forced him to delay his first big league victory until April 24 against 
Baltimore -- coming on nine days' rest. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, Abbott attempted to beat the Yankees while pitching on six days' rest. 
The result was his shortest, and most ragged, outing as an Angel. 
</P>
<P>
In three innings, Abbott made 78 pitches, yielding six hits and three walks. 
All told, he put nine Yankees on base -- and five of them scored. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson got things rolling early with his first-inning double. He advanced to 
third base on an infield out by Sax and came home on Mattingly's sacrifice fly 
to left. 
</P>
<P>
In the second inning, catcher Don Slaught drew a leadoff walk from Abbott, 
followed, one out later, by a single to center by Alvaro Espinoza. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott came back to strike out Roberto Kelly for the second out but walked 
Henderson to load the bases. Sax then hit a sharp grounder down the third-base 
line, which Howell failed to grab in a diving attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Slaught scored on the play, giving New York a 2-0 lead that would become 5-0, 
just as soon as Barfield and Brookens got in their third-inning swings. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't as free and easy and relaxed as he has been," Rader said. "But 
that's part of learning. You can't have it every night." 
</P>
<P>
New York starter Richard Dotson turned that 5-0 lead into his first victory of 
1989, lasting seven innings before giving way to relief pitcher Lee Guetterman. 
Dotson (1-0) allowed two runs on six hits to set up Guetterman for his fifth 
save. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels managed but two hits in five innings against Dotson, who was making 
his second start of the season after two relief appearances. 
</P>
<P>
The only runs they could muster came in the sixth, following a leadoff single 
by Dick Schofield. Brian Downing singled Schofield to second, and when Wally 
Joyner forced Downing, Schofield advanced to third. 
</P>
<P>
Schofield and Joyner eventually scored on a single to center by Devon White, 
giving White 21 RBIs for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Dotson completed the seventh inning before New York Manager Dallas Green called 
on Guetterman, who worked the eighth and ninth innings for the save. In 16 
appearance and 23 innings, Guetterman has yet to allow an earned run. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Petry and Willie Fraser mopped up for the Angels. Petry pitched four 
innings, surrendering only a fourth-inning walk to Sax. Fraser worked the last 
two innings, walking two and hitting a batter. 
</P>
<P>
"They really shut them down," Rader said, referring to his long-relief men. 
"That was outstanding to see." 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't enough to offset the sight of those first three ugly innings. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Claudell Washington rejoined the Angels Friday after spending 10 days in 
Northern California to be with his daughter, Camille, who had to be 
hospitalized after a home accident. "She's recovering, out of the hospital and 
now in physical therapy," Angel Manager Doug Rader reported. Washington was 
held out of the lineup Friday and, according to Rader, probably won't play 
until Sunday. "You can't dump him in there right away," Rader said. "It's gonna 
take him a little bit. He took a lot of extra hitting today and he'll do the 
same thing (this) morning. Hopefully, he'll be ready by Sunday." Rader lamented 
the fact that the layoff will may dull the swing of "probably our best hitter 
at the time, but personal business comes first. No question about that. I'm 
just glad everything's turning out good." 
</P>
<P>
Third baseman Jack Howell had to be removed from Friday's game after a sharp 
grounder off the bat of Steve Sax struck him in the left wrist. Initially, the 
injury was diagnosed as a contusion of the left hand but X-rays were done in 
the Angel clubhouse, which proved inconclusive. Howell is scheduled to have the 
hand examined today by specialist Dr. Norman Zemel at Centinela Hospital in 
Inglewood.

LAKERS FINISH MEEKLY BUT HOLD OFF SONICS

<P>
Swaying unsteadily in a barely conscious state, Xavier McDaniel then fell to 
the floor Friday night after colliding with Magic Johnson late in Game 3 of the 
NBA Western Conference semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Down and out went McDaniel and, eventually, his Seattle SuperSonics teammates 
followed. But not before putting up quite a fight after spending most of the 
night in a daze. The Lakers quelled a late Seattle uprising and secured a 91-86 
victory that most assuredly was more difficult to attain than the two 
double-figure blowouts at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to give them credit," Laker Coach Pat Riley said. "They could've 
thrown in the towel. But they didn't. To me, it still was a great win. It was 
91-86, and that's all that matters." 
</P>
<P>
Looking as if they were on the verge of another early knockout and seemingly 
able to cruise to a three-games-to-none lead in the series, the Lakers nearly 
wasted a 13-point lead in the final eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But right in the thick of the SuperSonic rally, McDaniel collided with Johnson 
while going for a rebound that SuperSonic forward Jerry Reynolds eventually 
converted to cut the Laker lead to one point with 1:22 to play. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel later returned, his lip bandaged. But from that point, the Lakers 
converted all of their free-throw opportunities and never let the lead dip 
below three points. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers now are one victory away from their second consecutive sweep in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
No one expected Game 3 to be easy for the Lakers. They had lost here twice 
during the regular season, looking bad doing so. 
</P>
<P>
But for much of this game, played before 14,541 at the Coliseum, the 
SuperSonics played even worse than they had in Games 1 and 2 in Inglewood. 
Entering the fourth quarter, Seattle had made only 34% of its shots. 
</P>
<P>
Just when it seemed that victory was out of reach, the SuperSonics went into 
their standard form of counterpunching. They threw a half-court trap at the 
Lakers, which didn't come as a surprise. How poorly the Lakers handled it was a 
surprise, however. 
</P>
<P>
The last Laker field goal of the game came with 7:39 to play when Mychal 
Thompson scored inside to make the score 81-68, Lakers. After that, the 
SuperSonics went on a 12-0 run that slashed the lead to 81-80 with 3:37 to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Riley called a timeout but he could have used a corner man to salve the blows 
the Lakers endured during Seattle's comeback. In eight possessions, his team 
committed four turnovers and missed four shots. 
</P>
<P>
Playoff veterans that they are, the Lakers still seemed rattled by the 
SuperSonics' pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Included in that Laker lapse was a 24-second violation, Orlando Woolridge 
stepping on the end line while driving to the basket, Johnson missing a 
technical foul shot and Johnson and Michael Cooper throwing the ball away. 
</P>
<P>
But the Lakers made 10 straight free throws in the final 3:19 to eke out the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers might not have looked dominating in the fourth quarter after 
limiting the SuperSonics to 15 points in the third period, but they were 
pleased with the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as we won, that's all," said James Worthy, who made 10 of 16 shots for 
20 points. "We have to put together a 48-minute defensive game. We didn't do 
that, and they came back. 
</P>
<P>
"They did a really good job of pressuring us (in the fourth quarter), and we 
didn't attack it. We tried to play out the lead and it cost us." 
</P>
<P>
Almost. 
</P>
<P>
Laker players, a confident bunch, said they were never really concerned, even 
when the SuperSonics pulled within one point on the play during which McDaniel 
and Johnson collided. 
</P>
<P>
No foul was called, although replays showed that Johnson clearly ran into a 
stationary McDaniel. Reynolds retrieved the ball and sank a jump shot to make 
the score 83-82 with 1:22 left. 
</P>
<P>
What followed was a series of Laker free throws. McDaniel returned 40 seconds 
later and made a jump shot to cut the deficit to three points. But as long as 
the Lakers made their free throws, which they did, they prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle was determined, it seemed, to go down firing. They shot only 36%, 
attempting 103 shots. With so many misses, it was not surprising that the 
SuperSonics held a 52-38 rebounding advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Ellis, averaging only 16.5 points in the first two games, scored a 
game-high 30. McDaniel added 20 points but made only 10 of 27 shots. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers shot 46.4%. They went from extremely hot during the impressive 
third-quarter surge, making 64.7%, to extremely cold in the fourth quarter, 
sinking only 27.3%. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy was the only Laker who shot well but was not the only contributor. Byron 
Scott added 17 points, and Johnson had 10 points and 14 assists. The Laker 
bench outplayed the SuperSonics, holding a 28-8 scoring advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to think about the last eight minutes," said Riley, dismissing 
the notion that in Game 4 the SuperSonics would start the small lineup they 
finished with Friday night. "A lot of the time, when a team comes back on you 
like that, you could crumble. But we didn't. We maintained it and got the win. 
</P>
<P>
"We did a hell of a job in the third quarter to get the (15-point) lead. We 
didn't let them convert their second shots -- and they had a lot of shots. The 
bottom line was that we won, no matter what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Seattle Coach Bernie Bickerstaff, however, wasn't conceding anything. 
Bickerstaff said the SuperSonics' chances were diminished by a blocking foul 
called on Reynolds with 3:19 left. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers held an 81-80 lead at that point, and the foul sent Johnson to the 
free-throw line. Magic made both shots, and the Laker lead never dipped below 
three points thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
"It could have gone either way, but they got it," Bickerstaff said. "Jerry did 
a great job on that drive. Our guys are busting their tails and it's 
disheartening (not getting foul shots)." 
</P>
<P>
As was the case in Los Angeles, the Lakers held a significant advantage in free 
throws attempted. Friday, they made 27 of 35, while Seattle sank only eight of 
17. 
</P>
<P>
The only numbers that matter to the Lakers today, however, are 3 and 0. 
</P>
<P>
They need only one victory to advance to the conference finals. They said they 
want it to come Sunday afternoon in Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to prolong it," Worthy said. "You never know what could 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Seattle point guard Nate McMillan, who missed most of Game 2 Wednesday because 
of a sprained left ankle, came off the bench Friday night and scored two points 
in 16 minutes. Sedale Threatt started in McMillan's place and had 10 points and 
nine assists. . . . Xavier McDaniel suffered a deep cut on his upper lip during 
as a result of his collision with Magic Johnson in the final two minutes. After 
the game, McDaniel needed four stitches to close the wound. He will be 
available to play Sunday in Game 4.

MAYWEATHER, CHAVEZ SQUARE OFF IN TITLE FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has been a busy week for promoter Don King. So busy, the poor man hasn't had 
time to comb his hair. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, he is helping to resurrect big-time boxing locally with 
tonight's Roger Mayweather-Julio Cesar Chavez World Boxing Council 
super-lightweight title fight at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
King is campaigning for a future match between his fighter, Julian Jackson, and 
International Boxing Federation middleweight champion Michael Nunn. 
</P>
<P>
And he's still found the time to work behind the scenes to finalize a deal for 
the next title defense of heavyweight champion Mike Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody said this business was easy. 
</P>
<P>
Zeroing in on the fact that Mayweather (34-5, 23 knockouts) has defeated eight 
consecutive Mexican fighters, King proudly announced the other day that 
Mayweather has come "to kill a Mexican." 
</P>
<P>
Pause. Smile. 
</P>
<P>
"In the ring, that is." 
</P>
<P>
That's reassuring. 
</P>
<P>
Moving quickly to quash any thoughts that he might be a bigot, King has bragged 
that "Mexican fighters love me because I promote more of their fights than 
anybody else. I am going to make Julio Cesar Chavez the highest-paid Mexican 
fighter ever." 
</P>
<P>
Explaining Mayweather's motivation, King said, "Roger was knocked out by a 
Mexican, and since then, he has been trying to vindicate himself." 
</P>
<P>
The man who delivered that knockout blow was none other than Chavez, who has 
become a hero to Latinos. Owner of a 62-0 record with 50 knockouts, Chavez is 
the latest to inherit the description once reserved for Sugar Ray Robinson -- 
greatest fighter, pound for pound, in the world. 
</P>
<P>
In Chavez's case, as in Robinson's, it might be more than hyperbole. At 26, the 
native of Sonora, Mexico, has already won both the WBC super-featherweight and 
lightweight titles as well as the World Boxing Assn. lightweight crown. 
</P>
<P>
One of Chavez's super-featherweight title defenses came in Las Vegas, 
Mayweather's hometown, in 1985 when Mayweather went down and out in the second 
round. 
</P>
<P>
Mayweather, however, picked himself up and went on to win 14 of his next 15 
fights, losing only to Pernell Whitaker by decision in a 12-round WBC 
Continental Americas lightweight title fight in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Mayweather subsequently beat Rene Arredondo on a sixth-round knockout in Los 
Angeles to win the WBC super-lightweight title in November 1987, and 
successfully defended it three times last year. 
</P>
<P>
He decisioned both Harold Brazier and Vinnie Pazienza in Las Vegas and beat 
Rodolfo Gonzalez in a 12th-round knockout at Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In this bout, each boxer is coming off a title fight -- Mayweather from his 
victory over Pazienza last November, and Chavez from his victory over Jose Luis 
Ramirez that gave him the WBC lightweight championship last October. 
</P>
<P>
In Mayweather-Chavez II, each fighter will be 10 pounds heavier. In their first 
meeting, they fought at 130. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to lose 13 pounds at the end the last time I met Chavez, including two 
the day of the fight," the 28-year-old Mayweather said. "That kills any 
fighter. But people don't want to hear that. The fact is I lost. I just feel at 
this weight, it's going to be altogether different." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking through an interpreter, Chavez indicated he also has had weight 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Three months ago," he said, "I weighed 148. But I am ready. I think he 
(Mayweather) will be a little bit stronger at the additional weight. He has a 
good right hand." 
</P>
<P>
If that right hand does sufficient damage, it could be a breakthrough fight for 
Mayweather. But he doesn't see it that way. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot say this fight will determine how great Roger Mayweather is," he 
said. "Every fight determines that. If this is a big fight, how about the other 
38? 
</P>
<P>
"People argue about who is the best running back, Jim Brown or Walter Payton. 
Who is the best basketball player, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar or Wilt Chamberlain. The 
important thing is, they are all in the history books." 
</P>
<P>
Chavez already seems assured of his place in his native country, where his fans 
waited in a line of cars more than a mile long just to greet him at the airport 
after he beat Edwin Rosario in 1987 to win the WBA lightweight title. 
</P>
<P>
Forum officials expect a crowd of at least 13,000 tonight and predict that the 
building's all-time attendance record for a boxing match -- 18,796 for Ruben 
Olivares-Rafael Herrera in 1972 -- could be broken. 
</P>
<P>
Each fighter will earn $750,000 plus 37.5% of the live gate after expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The first undercard fight is scheduled for 6:30 p.m., with the main event, to 
be televised by HBO, expected to start approximately an hour later.

National Football League players have no right to sue the league under 
antitrust laws because the labor laws that govern collective bargaining 
supersede them, a league attorney told a federal appeals panel in St. Paul, 
Minn. 
</P>
<P>
If a three-judge panel of the U.S. 8th Circuit Court of Appeals sides with the 
owners, the players' union could not proceed with its claim that the NFL's 
free-agency system restricts competition and suppresses wages. 
</P>
<P>
But if the panel decides not to rule on the league's request, or rules in favor 
of the players, the union could proceed with a trial, scheduled for November 
before U.S. District Judge David Doty in Minneapolis, said Paul Tagliabue, an 
NFL lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals panel took the case under advisement and did not say when it would 
rule.

Relief pitcher Jim Gott of the Pittsburgh Pirates will be sidelined for at 
least the rest of the season after arthroscopic surgery to remove a bone spur 
from his right elbow also revealed a damaged ligament, an injury that could end 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
Gott, 29, a right-hander, pitched just two-thirds of an inning this season, 
giving up one walk and one hit and getting one strikeout, against the Montreal 
Expos on April 6 before leaving with a sore arm.

<P>
GIANTS' REUSCHEL SCORES 200TH WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although arm problems cost him almost five seasons, right-hander Rick Reuschel 
of the San Francisco Giants has reached the 200-victory mark. 
</P>
<P>
Reuschel, who will turn 40 Tuesday, held the Expos to four hits before 
faltering in the ninth inning Friday night at Montreal. Rich Gossage then came 
on to get the last out in a 2-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Reuschel (6-2) had a string of 22 consecutive scoreless innings until Tom Foley 
singled, went to second on an infield out and scored on Hubie Brooks' single in 
the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Gossage, whose career appeared to be over until Giant Manager Roger Craig gave 
him a chance this season, didn't have to get a hitter out to earn his second 
save. Otis Nixon, running for Brooks, was out stealing to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
An error by Foley in the eighth inning resulted in the run that gave the Giants 
their fifth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
Reuschel had 20- and 18-victory seasons for the Chicago Cubs before his arm 
troubles began in 1981. After he had several operations and missed the 1982 
season and most of 1983, Reuschel's career appeared to be over. From 1981 until 
he joined Pittsburgh late in the 1985 season, he won only 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
The arm continued to get stronger. He went to the Giants in August 1987 and was 
the key to the late drive that gave the Giants the pennant in the West. 
</P>
<P>
When he was a 19-game winner last season, it seemed that he may have reached 
his peak. But he has already won six games this season and appears to have an 
excellent chance to win 20, a dozen years after he did it the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 3, Chicago 1 -- The light-hitting Astros make it tough on their 
pitchers, but in the early going, at least, left-hander Jim Deshaies has 
handled the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Deshaies improved to 5-2 and barely missed his third shutout in eight starts 
this season in the game at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros took a 2-0 lead in the third inning when Gerald Young stole home and 
Bill Doran hit a run-scoring single. 
</P>
<P>
A steal of home in the sixth ruined Deshaies' shutout. Darrin Jackson scored on 
the front end of a double steal. 
</P>
<P>
Deshaies, better known as a fly-ball pitcher, got 16 groundouts and four 
strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 10, Atlanta 2 -- Glenn Wilson's two-run double keyed a five-run 
third-inning rally at Pittsburgh as the Pirates ended the Braves' seven-game 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
John Smiley (5-1) pitched a five-hitter, and Bobby Bonilla keyed the attack 
with three hits and three runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 4, New York 3 -- When Dwight Gooden went into the ninth inning at New 
York with a one-run lead and couldn't hold it, the Mets' chances appeared slim. 
They committed five errors and finally lost in the 12th inning on Marvell 
Wynne's run-scoring single. 
</P>
<P>
Gooden, working on a two-hitter, gave up three consecutive singles before Randy 
Myers came on with runners on first and third and nobody out in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Lyons, playing for injured Gary Carter, had given the Mets a 2-1 lead 
when he homered with two out in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 5, St. Louis 0 -- Rick Mahler pitched a five-hitter at St. Louis to 
win his fourth game in a row, and Barry Larkin drove in two runs. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals, who lost another pitcher -- Scott Terry -- because of a sore 
arm, brought up Ted Power for his first National League start since 1987. He 
was the loser. DAN HAFNER

PORT HIRES AN EXPERIENCED ASSISTANT; 
</P>
<P>
DAN O'BRIEN HAS 35 YEARS OF ADMINISTRATIVE KNOW-HOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angel Vice President Mike Port hired an assistant Friday afternoon, but he 
didn't hire anyone who had previously served as an Angel designated hitter, 
homered in the World Series, won a league MVP award or written a book. 
</P>
<P>
Dan O'Brien is no Don Baylor. Dan O'Brien is no Reggie Jackson. Dan O'Brien, in 
fact, never played an inning in the major leagues, his career as a professional 
baseball player beginning and ending with a tryout with the Brooklyn Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
But Dan O'Brien has 35 years' worth of administrative experience, which is the 
main reason he today holds the title of senior vice president in charge of 
baseball operations for the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Concluding a search that began last December when owner Gene Autry promoted 
Port from general manager to chief operating officer with instructions to 
expand the front office, O'Brien, 59, joins the Angels after serving as general 
manager of the Texas Rangers, president of the Seattle Mariners and assistant 
to the president of the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
"As you know, we have given a considerable amount of thought to expanding the 
base of our baseball operations," Port said, "and it was certainly important to 
all of us to locate and identify the proper and right individual. 
</P>
<P>
"The position we were looking to fill calls for a well-experienced and senior 
baseball executive. Dan certainly fits that description." 
</P>
<P>
And that, apparently, ruled out Baylor and Jackson, the former Angel sluggers 
whose names repeatedly cropped up while Port conducted his search. Neither 
Baylor nor Jackson has any baseball administrative experience. 
</P>
<P>
However, Baylor and Jackson remain candidates for another vacancy created by 
the Angels' front-office expansion -- a sort of "junior executive" who would, 
as Port put it, "go through things with Dan and learn through observation." 
</P>
<P>
Port refers to such a position as "our social and affirmative-action 
obligation." 
</P>
<P>
"With Dan O'Brien and his experience," Port said, "we now have a situation 
where I can say, 'Dan, I'll be back in three days. Take over.' 
</P>
<P>
"(The other position) would entail more participatory legwork. . . . It would 
involve player development and scouting and general major league operations." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien's assignment will be similar to the one Port held during Buzzie 
Bavasi's tenure as Angel general manager, with Port overseeing the club's 
scouting department and negotiating player contracts and Bavasi making trades 
and personnel decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"Structurally, what we're getting back to is how things were done when Buzzie 
Bavasi was here," Port said. "That system paid off in a pair of division titles 
(1979 and 1982). 
</P>
<P>
"The best approximation (of the Port-O'Brien relationship) is that Dan will do 
many of the same things that Mike Port did when Buzzie Bavasi was here." 
</P>
<P>
And that is? 
</P>
<P>
"I handled a lot of contract matters under Buzzie," Port said. "There was a lot 
of paper work -- record-keeping, waivers, rules, assignments, spring training 
planning, clubhouse matters. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are all things Dan has done." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien began his career in management in 1955 when Branch Rickey hired him as 
general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates' Burlington, N.C., farm team. He also 
served in a similar capacity with three Milwaukee Braves minor league teams. 
</P>
<P>
After that, O'Brien spent nine years as assistant to the president of the 
National Assn. of Professional Baseball Leagues before serving as vice 
president and general manager of the Texas Rangers from 1973 to '79. 
</P>
<P>
Then came stints as president of the Seattle Mariners (1979-1984) and assistant 
to the president of the Cleveland Indians (1984-1989). 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien was hired in Cleveland by Peter Bavasi but had his responsibilities 
reduced when Hank Peters replaced Bavasi as the Indians' president. 
</P>
<P>
"My involvement in Cleveland was not as broad as it is here," O'Brien said. 
"Hank brought in some of his own people, and that narrowed my involvement at 
that time. (The last fews years) I mostly oversaw player development." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien considers his expertise to be the "the player evaluation side of it, 
the contract negotiation area," and Port said O'Brien will assume a major 
portion of that role during the off-season. Last winter, after catcher Bob 
Boone's defection to Kansas City, there were charges of Port spreading himself 
too thin in that department.

<P>
RELAY WIN GIVES FOOTHILL TITLE OVER MISSION VIEJO

After more than a decade of dominance, Mission Viejo wasn't about to go down 
without a fight in the Southern Section 4-A boys' swim championships. 
</P>
<P>
But down they went. 
</P>
<P>
The team championship was decided by the 400-yard freestyle relay, the final 
event of the evening at Belmont Plaza Pool in Long Beach. And Foothill won the 
race in convincing fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill was timed in 3 minutes 6.88 seconds with Mission Viejo second in 
3:10.32. The victory gave Foothill 147 points to end Mission Viejo's 14-year 
reign as 4-A champion. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo was second with 115. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley won its third consecutive girls' title with 166 points. 
Mission Viejo was second with 156. 
</P>
<P>
The last team to win a 4-A boys' title besides Mission Viejo was Foothill, in 
1974. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, the teams were even through the first two legs of the deciding race, 
but Andy Musch gave Foothill a 25-yard advantage with 100 yards to go. Brian 
Cowdell maintained that lead on Mission Viejo's Tsukasa Kawabuchi down the 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Kawabuchi earlier swam the 100 freestyle in 46.56 seconds to edge Cowdell and 
also won the 50 freestyle in 21.19. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Scott was Foothill's only individual champion, winning the 100 butterfly in 
50.30. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' competition, Amy Shaw was the driving force behind Capistrano 
Valley's victory. 
</P>
<P>
She won the 200 freestyle in 1:47.91 and the 500 freestyle in 4:46.45. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars also received a strong performance from sprinter Christy Carolin, 
who won the 50 freestyle in 23.94. She finished second in the 100 freestyle in 
52.26. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo, which won 11 consecutive girls' titles in 1976-86, finished 
second for the third straight year. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo set the only Southern Section record during the meet as its 
girls' 400 freestyle relay team swam 3:28.56.

THE PITCH FOR BASEBALL; 
</P>
<P>
DOES IT MAKE FOR A GREAT MOVIE, OR WHAT?

Baseball brings out the satirist in some, the sentimentalist in others. The 
game itself is so rich in costumed imagery, so rife with colorful personalities 
and vivid vocabularies, that a goofball film such as "Major League" truly might 
be more documentary than parody. At the same time, the game is so steeped in 
tradition, so evocative of heartfelt childhood memories, that a storybook fable 
such as "Field of Dreams" makes a straight-faced, strait-laced pitch that 
baseball is as everlasting and reliable as anything in our lives, and just 
about gets away with it. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever eternal appeal baseball does have, it clearly is a pastime this nation 
cannot seem to do without. Even those who do not follow the box scores, who 
could not tell AB from R from H, must agree that in an often-confusing world, 
baseball gives us undeniable winners and losers, telltale statistics, 
occasional pageantry and various degrees of tragedy. In person, someone could 
be captivated so much by a baseball game's simple choreography as to make 
keeping score completely unnecessary. Baseball is a dance in baggy pants. 
</P>
<P>
Possibly this explains why Hollywood cannot resist cranking out movies such as 
these new ones, movies that show polar-opposite sides of the sport. Even 
baseball in its rawest form -- playing catch with your old man -- becomes the 
central image of "Field of Dreams," same as it is in "The Natural," proposing 
the game as a natural extension of family love, as important as baby's first 
step or daughter's first date. 
</P>
<P>
So, if we are willing to follow and swallow all this, we might also go along 
with every other preposterous notion of "Field of Dreams," which supplies an 
amazing assortment of malarkey presenting baseball as a magical, mystical world 
where wishes can come true. Those of us who do not buy into this sweet movie's 
premise undoubtedly will be painted as unfeeling, unimaginative ogres who 
deserve all the kung fu and car-chase cassettes we can rent. People do take 
their baseball seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Anyhow, I already can see producers scrambling for new baseball-related ideas. 
No doubt some will draw from real life -- as well they should. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the Cincinnati Reds' major-league baseball team also owns a St. 
Bernard named Schottzie, who is pictured in the team's yearbook, has full run 
of the ballpark and someday might even -- it would not surprise us a bit -- 
inherit the ball club. Now would that make a movie or what? 
</P>
<P>
The best player in the history of the Cincinnati Reds, a man who now manages 
them, recently has been accused of everything from betting on games to selling 
bogus copies of his memorabilia to exchanging hand signals from the dugout with 
gamblers in the stands. Now would that make a movie or what? 
</P>
<P>
A young outfielder for the Kansas City Royals, who is playing quite well at 
present, quit baseball for the entire 1985-86 season because of a nervous 
disorder, later diagnosed as Tourette's syndrome, which gave him something 
tantamount to a classic case of stage fright. Some cruel souls joked that he 
had turned into a twitch-hitter. Now would that make a movie or what? 
</P>
<P>
A young left-handed pitcher for the California Angels has no fingers on his 
right hand, but won the final game of the Summer Olympics in South Korea and 
reached the majors in his first year out of college. He says the only real 
problem he has in life is fastening his left cufflink. 
</P>
<P>
C'mon. Ideal film fodder, right? Almost right up there with that Lou 
Gehrig-Gary Cooper "I'm the luckiest man on the face of the (echo) 
Earth-Earth-Earth" stuff. 
</P>
<P>
So, expect a deluge of baseball comedies, baseball dramedies, maybe even 
baseball biographies. Danny Glover as Hank Aaron. Bruce Willis as Roger Maris. 
James Woods as Wade Boggs. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad that guy Joe E. Ross ("Ooh! Ooh!") from the old TV series "Car 54, 
Where Are You?" is not around anymore. What a Yogi Berra he would have made. 
</P>
<P>
Funny how baseball is no longer profession non grata in the minds of producers. 
Or was it ever? Supposedly, baseball themes were to be avoided at all costs, 
the key word here being costs. Baseball was anathema to women and lacked appeal 
internationally, the reasoning went. Baseball movies were going, going, gone. 
Yet, within a year, "Eight Men Out," "Stealing Home," "Bull Durham," "Major 
League" and "Field of Dreams," a virtual murderers' row of baseball-related 
movies have been released. 
</P>
<P>
Well, nobody knows anything, right? Nobody knows what will sell. Perhaps we are 
due for a glut of sports pictures, and not just about baseball, either. More 
basketball films. "Amazing Grace and Chuck II: Amazing's Revenge." More 
football films. "Everybody's All-American II: He's baaaaack!" More 
track-and-field films. Florence Griffith-Joyner, starring in: "Stripped to 
Run." 
</P>
<P>
Oh, and don't forget white boxers. Hollywood can't get enough of white boxers. 
Never mind those Joe Louis, Sugar Ray Robinson nobodies. Commission a few more 
scripts about the white guys who fought them. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball, though, is the game for which Americans reserve a heartfelt love, a 
tenderness almost, that likely will keep the national-pastime movies coming. 
Clearly there will always be some love interest ("Pride of the Yankees," "Bull 
Durham") or some tragedy ("Bang the Drum Slowly," "The Natural") or some other 
subplot that will keep the film from being entirely about baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Also of continuing importance is The Happy Ending. Moviegoers must leave the 
theater smiling, evidently, to enjoy today's feel-good baseball films. Someday 
when they remake "Pride of the Yankees" or "Bang the Drum Slowly," miracle 
cures undoubtedly will save Lou Gehrig and Bruce Pearson just in time. Too bad 
nobody had the nerve to make "The Natural" the way Bernard Malamud wrote it in 
1952, with Roy Hobbs striking out in the end. Then again, Malamud's Hobbs put 
himself into the hospital by gorging himself on greasy food. Not exactly a 
leading man's dream scene. 
</P>
<P>
I love most baseball movies, even the bad ones. Mainly the bad ones. One hasn't 
really lived life to the fullest until one has seen William Bendix as Babe 
Ruth, rushing a sick puppy to a veterinarian's hospital, still wearing his 
Yankee uniform. One hasn't really lived at all until one has seen William 
Bendix as Bill (Two-Call) Johnson in "Kill the Umpire," in which he mistakenly 
uses somebody else's eyedrop prescription just before a big game, then ends up 
seeing double and calling every play twice. (The umpire: "Ball! Ball!" The 
catcher: "I hoid ya da foist time!") 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, I save a special place in my heart for Ray Milland in "It Happens 
Every Spring," pitching baseballs dabbed with a top-secret solution that makes 
them repellent to wood. (Why he didn't have 27 strikeouts a night, I'll never 
know.) I also look forward to Late, Late Show telecasts of "Angels in the 
Outfield" (which has nothing to do with Reggie Jackson or Chili Davis), "The 
Kid From Left Field" (the original peanut-vendor movie) and "Rhubarb" (Ray 
Milland, again, in the story of a baseball franchise willed to a pet cat. And 
you think it can't happen with the Cincinnati Reds.) 
</P>
<P>
Non-sports movies have been known to slip in a ballpark scene, here or there. 
Let us not forget Doris Day causing Berra, Maris and Mickey Mantle to be 
ejected from a Yankee game in "That Touch of Mink." Or, Lana Turner catching a 
foul ball at Dodger Stadium in "Bachelor in Paradise," while a very young Vin 
Scully calls the action. Or, Matthew Broderick ditching school and nabbing a 
souvenir at Wrigley Field in "Ferris Bueller's Day Off." Or, Glenn Ford gunning 
down Ross Martin on the pitching mound of Candlestick Park in "Experiment in 
Terror." 
</P>
<P>
Baseball also has been very good to television, if for no better reason than to 
provide a colorful means of identifying a character's favorite team. Tom 
Selleck in a Detroit cap. Brian Keith in a New York cap. Victor French in an 
Oakland cap. Jamie Farr in a Texas cap (actually intended to represent Toledo). 
About the only guy you never see in a baseball cap is Ted Danson on "Cheers," 
and he is supposed to be an ex-pitcher for the Boston Red Sox. Guess he just 
hates covering that hair. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose we will be seeing more and more baseball-themed screenplays and 
teleplays in months to come, and I have some ideas. Or, rather, I have stolen 
some ideas. Stealing is permitted, remember, both in Hollywood and in baseball. 
After all, "Bull Durham" dealt with an aging catcher in his last season, a wild 
pitcher with a great fastball that he cannot control and a first baseman who 
practiced voodoo. 
</P>
<P>
"Major League" deals with an aging catcher in his last season, a wild pitcher 
with a great fastball that he cannot control, and a first baseman who practices 
voodoo. 
</P>
<P>
One film was released first. For all I know, the other film, might have been 
written first. 
</P>
<P>
Well, it's baseball's oldest argument: Who's on first? 
</P>
<P>
I intend to pitch to the major studios a sequel to "Pride of the Yankees," with 
Arnold Schwarzenegger as Lou Gehrig. Only this time, Lou's last line is: "I 
vill be back!"

FROM FATHERS TO SONS: CATCHING A MEMORY

<P>
"You ought to see my dad's fingers. They're this big!" 
</P>
<P>
Whenever I told childhood friends about my father's fingers, I illustrated it 
by making a circle with my own hands that suggested something with a 
circumference of a fire hose. 
</P>
<P>
To small kids, a man's hands are natural wonders, great leathery clumps with 
oak branches attached, amazing devices that can lift you to the sky or adroitly 
button your shirt. 
</P>
<P>
But in my father's case, I didn't exaggerate much. As a catcher on a semi-pro 
baseball team in Kansas during the Depression, he had had his fingers broken so 
often by foul-tipped pitches that the joints were left permanently twisted and 
swollen. 
</P>
<P>
His hands were as ugly as spiders but he took great pride in them and so did my 
brothers and I. For boys growing up in the postwar years, there was nothing 
more important than baseball and our dad had been paid to play it! Only a 
couple of bucks a week, but what did we care? 
</P>
<P>
I was reminded of the family's brush with baseball immortality by Phil Alden 
Robinson's "Field of Dreams." In the opening moments of the film, the major 
character -- an Iowa farmer played by Kevin Costner -- tells how his father had 
given up on a baseball career for the security of a job in the Brooklyn 
shipyards and worked himself to death. 
</P>
<P>
Upon those reflections hang both the film's theme -- dreams unpursued are 
dreams unfulfilled -- and its plot. Through a series of magical events that 
occur on a baseball diamond carved out of a cornfield, Costner's Ray Kinsella 
sets out to understand the father he never knew. The movie is not about 
baseball, of course. It's one more in a never-ending series of attempts by men 
to understand bonds with their fathers. Kinsella didn't connect with his father 
when he was alive and, like many men reflecting on their relationships with 
their dads, he has found a bond in baseball. The symbol was Shoeless Joe 
Jackson, a great Chicago White Sox player who was banned from the game for life 
for his part in the fixing of the 1919 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
In the movie, Kinsella recalls hurting his father, a devoted Shoeless Joe fan, 
by asking him how he could revere a cheater. It's a question that, given the 
moral lapses by many current sports heroes, kids may be asking their fathers 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"Field of Dreams" doesn't deal with the integrity of baseball heroes but with 
how the game has -- for much of this century, at least -- provided a special 
bond between boys and their fathers. 
</P>
<P>
My earliest memories of my father are of those gnarly fingers and the stories 
that went with them. Dad would hold up one of his fingers and tell how he had 
had it broken by a foul-tipped slider thrown by Hungry Boyd. As he told it, he 
would merely set the break himself, wrap some tape around it, and keep playing. 
</P>
<P>
Kids understand these things. You can't quit in the middle of a baseball game. 
Not unless it's so dark, you might catch the next one in the face. 
</P>
<P>
When he wasn't talking about Hungry Boyd or his other pitcher, Turk Henderson 
(he and Turk were once invited to the Chicago Cubs training camp, but Turk got 
sick and they both stayed home), he was talking reverently about his own 
Shoeless Joes -- Stan Musial, Joe DiMaggio and Bob Feller. Once in a while, he 
piled us all in the car and took us to Wrigley Field in Los Angeles where we 
rooted for Pacific Coast League stars named Max West and Dee Fondy. 
</P>
<P>
More than anything, I remember the summer evenings playing catch. There was no 
conversation that I can recall, just a ball being thrown back and forth until 
he decided it was time to go in. 
</P>
<P>
Why is an activity of such apparent monotony remembered with such fondness? And 
why does "Field of Dreams," a blatantly sentimental film with fewer 
complications than an overhand fastball, have so many grown men weeping in 
their popcorn? 
</P>
<P>
For many men, at least for those of us who were raised before early gender 
identification was deemed a form of child abuse, baseball was the simplest and 
most intimate way for an American dad to let his Y chromosome toddler know what 
he was. 
</P>
<P>
The truth of most father-son relationships is that they don't become openly 
close -- if ever -- until the son is himself a man. Between the first game of 
catch and the first adult connection, there is a lot of livin' to do. Oedipal 
complexities, adolescent rebellions and the inevitable burden of youth knowing 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
If the father doesn't live long enough, the bond simply never matures. 
</P>
<P>
That's the case with Ray Kinsella in "Field of Dreams." He didn't get a chance 
to square his disappointments with his dad before his dad was gone. Only 
through this dreamy baseball metaphor -- with his father's hero summoned from 
the beyond for batting practice in an Iowa cornfield -- is he able to get on 
with his own life. 
</P>
<P>
People have been lumping "Field of Dreams" in with the current "Major League" 
and last year's "Bull Durham" as evidence of baseball's commercial viability on 
film. Certainly, the game is bedrock American, a handy remedy for all sorts of 
literary ailments, but it doesn't explain the success of "Field of Dreams." 
</P>
<P>
Judging by the exit polls, which show that the movie is equally liked by all 
ages and both genders, Robinson has tapped into something very basic about the 
early bonds formed between children and their parents. That this story is 
specifically about fathers and sons doesn't, as Yogi Berra might have put it, 
include anyone out.

CRITIC AT LARGE: MURDER, THEY WRITE -- A GATHERING OF THE GENRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a room full of murderous thoughts, but you'd never have known it to look 
about you. The auditorium at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice on 
Manhattan's West Side contained some 200 present and future writers of crime 
fiction, come to hear a symposium on physical evidence. To a person, they were 
making furious notes that will undoubtedly shape the creation of tomorrow's 
vile deeds. 
</P>
<P>
The witness included author William Caunitz ("Black Sand"), who before he took 
up writing was for 29 years a high-ranking New York Police Department officer; 
Lt. Frank Bunting, a 20-year narcotics detective with the department; and 
Lawrence Kobilinsky, who is an expert on DNA "fingerprinting." The DNA work, 
already the subject of a book by Joseph Wambaugh, is the hot news in forensic 
medicine. Judging from all the note-taking and question-asking, it will be soon 
be harder to escape in crime fiction than red herrings. 
</P>
<P>
The symposium was a feature of the annual gathering of the 2,500-member Mystery 
Writers of America, who met this time in an atmosphere of ebullient 
satisfaction. Measured by sales of both new and reprinted works (the mystery 
past is being ransacked), and by other symptoms, like the popularity of 
"Murder, She Wrote," there seems clearly a resurgence of interest in the form, 
which has never quite been out of fashion but rarely been chic. 
</P>
<P>
The late eminent literary critic Edmund Wilson once wrote a snarling essay 
called "Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?" a slighting reference to one of 
Dame Agatha Christie's earliest and most controversial works, about whose 
denouement cries of "Dirty pool!" are still heard. But the equally eminent poet 
W. H. Auden countered with a celebration of the mystery form called "The Guilty 
Vicarage," evening the score so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
The danger facing the form at the moment may not be overt hostility but a 
smothering and dissecting interest from the academic community, which is 
subjecting crime fiction to various forms of analysis, from Marxist to 
semiotics. 
</P>
<P>
But the mystery writers go about their work rather serenely indifferent to 
these academic flurries. Possibly inspired by the model of Dame Agatha herself, 
a sturdy grandmother figure surely more at home among primroses than police 
procedures, the writers are as benevolent-looking a group as you could hope to 
find this side of the Chelsea Flower Show. (Given the ruthless competition 
amongst hybridizers, possibly even more benevolent.) 
</P>
<P>
On the evidence of the turnout for the group's annual Edgar Awards dinner 
Thursday night -- the awards named, naturally, for Edgar Allan Poe, the 
acknowledged procreator of the modern detective story -- the mysterians are 
predominantly female, in their early to middle years. 
</P>
<P>
Why the writers, except for the occasional sporty and raffish exception, should 
appear so uniformly kindly, men and women alike, is good question. It may be 
because they are able to exorcise their lethal angers and frustrations by 
putting them down on paper. The rages that others harbor, gnawing at their 
innards like concealed foxes, the crime-writers can assign to the bad guys or 
the good persons (who are able to vent their spleens in ways denied to lesser 
humans). 
</P>
<P>
One says good persons these days, because there is a rising trend toward female 
operatives, not just the amateur sleuths in the folksy tradition of Jane 
Marples, but private eyes, like Sara Paretsky's V. I. Warshinsky, who can take 
a punch as well as Lew Archer ever could, and unmask and unhand the villain 
with equal knightly flair. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal of crime fiction is, as ever, primarily escapist -- an antidote to 
insomnia, worldly cares and the tedium of travel. But, as the work of this 
year's Edgar winners suggests, the field is not easy to summarize. It ranges 
form the traditional "cozies" (set in small towns with a tight cast of 
suspects) to more exotic situations. 
</P>
<P>
Present stories offer moral ambiguities and sexual and linguistic candor 
eschewed in classic crime fiction. The best writing offers a background of 
well-observed social history that in decades to come will give accurate clues 
to the way we lived now. 
</P>
<P>
This year's top winner, appropriate to a year of glasnost, was Stuart M. 
Kaminsky's "A Cold Red Sunrise," one of his series featuring a Moscow 
policeman. It was chosen from more than 200 entries. 
</P>
<P>
The eagerly sought and career-launching Edgar for the best first mystery by an 
American writer went to "Caroline Skeletons" by David Stout. The best paperback 
original was Timothy Findley's "The Telling of Lies." There were 93 entries in 
the category, a measure of activity in the field. 
</P>
<P>
Winner for the best factual book on crime was "In Broad Daylight" by Harry 
Mclean, about the murder of an unpopular man in a Missouri town, a crime that 
has gone unpublished because none of the four dozen eyewitnesses would testify. 
</P>
<P>
The Edgar for best biographical or critical study went to Francis M. Nevins Jr. 
for his exhaustive book, "Cornell Woolrich: First You Dream, Then You Die." An 
Edgar for best movie went to Errol Morris for his documentary, "The Thin Blue 
Line," which was instrumental in the freeing of an unjustly convicted man after 
he had spent more than a dozen years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The television honors went to a feature, "Man Against the Mob," written by 
David J. Kinghorn and shown on NBC, and to "The Devil's Foot," an episode from 
the PBS Mystery! series, "The Return of Sherlock Holmes." 
</P>
<P>
A special Ellery Queen Award went to the partnership of William Link and the 
late Richard Levinson for their body of work, which included the creation of 
"Columbo" and "Murder, She Wrote." 
</P>
<P>
The Mystery Writers highest honor, the Grandmaster Award, went to the veteran 
Hillary Waugh, whose classic thriller, "Last Seen Wearing . . ." has twice been 
included on lists of the 100 best crime novels of all time. 
</P>
<P>
As banquets go, Thursday night's could have used more mystery and suspense and 
somewhat better plotting. But it was congenial and, above all, benevolent.

'HARD TIME' COPES WITH RENEWAL JITTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRV LETOFSKY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the series "Hard Time on Planet Earth," hero warrior Jesse is exiled to our 
planet. Then CBS exiled the series to another netherworld . . . the Wednesday 
abyss. 
</P>
<P>
A comedy-fantasy-adventure with Martin Kove (the macho cop Victor Isbecki on 
"Cagney &amp; Lacey") as the innocent alien abroad, "Hard Time" runs an hour 
those nights at 8, which has been devoid of life for CBS. 
</P>
<P>
The time period is bounded by a rock ("Unsolved Mysteries" on NBC) and two hard 
places ("Growing Pains" and "Head of the Class" on ABC). 
</P>
<P>
Are there enough people left over to make survivable ratings? Will Jesse live 
to see the fall schedule, due to be announced later this month? 
</P>
<P>
"Hard Time" went on the air March 1 and clawed its way to the status of 
"marginal" with 14 and 15 "shares" (the percentage of sets in use that are 
tuned to that program). By contrast, the other shows hover around 25 and 30 
shares. By further contrast, previous CBS entries such as the Mary Tyler Moore 
and Dick Van Dyke series and "TV 101" had death-dealing 8s and 10s. 
</P>
<P>
Co-executive producer E. Jack Kaplan acknowledged that this is life on the edge 
of extinction: "We expect to hear within the next two weeks. A CBS guy was 
trying to be hopeful. He said, 'Who knows what will happen when they get behind 
the oak doors in New York? Who knows what they will decide?' " 
</P>
<P>
The "oak doors" refers to the culmination of what's called "the pilot season" 
and those mysterious executive rituals by which the networks select next 
season's hits and, undoubtedly, misses. 
</P>
<P>
If there are any answers, officials weren't even available for the questions, 
including Kim LeMasters, president of CBS Entertainment, and producing Disney 
TV officials Randy Reiss, president of network TV, and Tony Jonas, vice 
president for network development. They pleaded busy. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran writer-producers Kaplan and Richard Chapman seem to retain a veteran 
sense of equilibrium. Kaplan did shows such as "Laugh-In," "Hill Street Blues," 
"Designing Women"; Chapman did "Simon and Simon," "Leg Man" and "The Oldest 
Rookie." 
</P>
<P>
On one Monday, only two acts (of the required four) were written for the 
episode that was to start shooting three days hence. On Tuesday, a third act 
was finished. On the next morning the last act was up for contemplation. 
</P>
<P>
CBS was calling: Was there was a script yet? No. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan said: "Every indication we get from CBS is that they like the shows, 
they love the shows, they like the demographics. . . . Marty (Kove) has amazed 
a lot of people. Marty's always played macho tough and (in this) he's 
vulnerable and he is genuinely funny. 
</P>
<P>
"(But) we don't have enough 'numbers.' CBS has four or five shows that are 
getting the same sort of numbers -- 'Tour of Duty,' 'Beauty and the Beast,' 
etc. -- which are consistent but probably not (strong enough). CBS has some 
tough decisions to make." 
</P>
<P>
Kove, in his trailer awaiting what would be another 14- or 18-hour day, was 
rapping with a CBS executive on how to improve the show. The executive used 
terms like adult relate-able. 
</P>
<P>
The show has a heavy young audience -- "Kids love the superhero element," said 
the star -- but now needed sophistication. 
</P>
<P>
Kove was suggesting, "Why not have a nemesis who occasionally comes down? Like 
in 'The Fugitive' (Lt. Gerard, always in hot pursuit of Kimball). Jesse never 
knows what body, what form, this guy appears in. The audience sees but Jesse 
doesn't know." 
</P>
<P>
The producers were especially pleased with the episode running that night in 
which the Amazonian dancer-actress Sandahl Bergman played an alien hit-woman 
who comes to Earth to toy with Jesse -- some playful girl-boy business -- then 
terminate him. This may be what TV folk call "an 8 o'clock show," as in family 
time, but it's not all kiddie stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse was a great revolutionary hero but peace has broken out and his planet 
doesn't need warriors anymore. So the Tribunal consigns Jesse to Earth for 
rehabilitation, along with a computer-generated cybernaut -- like a little 
flying eye -- to keep watch. But "Control" is short of circuits and darts about 
dispensing malaprops of wisdom: "A penny saved is a joy forever." 
</P>
<P>
(Control's four to six minutes of shtick per episode is animated onto the film, 
adding considerable time to the post-production burden and a major blip on what 
a source said was an estimated $1.2 million-plus per-episode budget.) 
</P>
<P>
The pilot was shot last year during the writers' strike, so that creators Jim 
and John Thomas (they wrote the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, "The Predator") 
couldn't do corrective rewrites. But even though all parties agreed that 
radical changes were needed, CBS ran the pilot as the premiere. The critics 
beat it to death. 
</P>
<P>
Then the resurrection. The "look" of the show was enhanced, different lighting, 
trickier camera work; Control lost powers to make its persona more interesting; 
Jesse was made less Rambo and more vulnerable, therein more appealing to women 
viewers. 
</P>
<P>
But should Jesse be more Incredible Hulk? Or more Chauncey Gardiner (as in 
"Being There")? 
</P>
<P>
Said Chapman: "The tightrope we walk is having him learn too fast and lose some 
of the ingenuous quality or -- does he look silly if he doesn't learn fast 
enough?" 
</P>
<P>
Jesse takes Earth on literal terms: "He sits down with you over a cup of tea -- 
but he doesn't know what to do with the lemon. But he knows how to convert a 
computer." 
</P>
<P>
In one episode, Jesse sees a TV commercial about a Cal Worthingtonian-type car 
dealer named Buck who's in big trouble because he has so many cars to sell. 
Jesse dashes off to help Buck. 
</P>
<P>
CBS gave the "go" order in early December, with production to start in early 
January. 
</P>
<P>
"So when the people were writing these scripts," said Kaplan, "the show hadn't 
been on the air yet. They weren't familiar with the show and the nuances that 
changed week to week." 
</P>
<P>
Of the first 10 scripts commissioned, Kaplan and Chapman wrote one themselves 
and "massively" rewrote eight: "In many cases, not a word was left standing." 
</P>
<P>
For a brawny guy (6-feet-1, 180 pounds), the star was looking a bit peaked, 
even through the haze of the day's careful makeup. He plays in virtually every 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
He has little time for basic actor amenities, so his assigned hairdresser had 
to stop over at the Kove home on a day off to lighten his hair for the cameras. 
On one Sunday the director was coming over to talk about the next episode. 
</P>
<P>
In the middle of this series he was doing double duty by continuing his role in 
the "Karate Kid" films as Kreese, the vicious sensei. But the producers of "KK 
3" were displeased to the point of being angry with his TV schedule and were 
forced to rewrite the role. 
</P>
<P>
How is life on the edge? 
</P>
<P>
"I've been through 'Cagney &amp; Lacey' for six years," Kove said, "and we were 
canceled twice and the first year they fired every writer after six shows. I've 
been through the ups and downs and I know how it works." 
</P>
<P>
On one of the upcoming "Hard Times," Al Waxman, Kove's crusty precinct boss on 
"Cagney and Lacey," directs an episode that employs Jesse's brain power. A 
university scientist claims to have a microchip that can contact alien life, 
but Jesse reveals him as a fraud. "Not the innocent comedy anymore," Kove 
asserted. 
</P>
<P>
Is it too late? Viewers have to know more about Jesse to care about Jesse, 
"other than see him tossing people over cars." Kove wants a bigger scope, a 
Jesse bigger than life. 
</P>
<P>
"The character's a little more sophisticated," Kaplan said. "The last few shows 
are more concentrated on his stories. In one he runs across another prisoner 
like himself who's in the body of a high school kid who's determined to rule 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
"The final show is poignant, with Gordon Jump (from "WKRP in Cincinnati") 
playing a kid-show host who tries to commit suicide and Jesse saves him." 
</P>
<P>
Star and producers have arm-wrestled over just how to achieve "bigger than 
life," but they seem to get along pretty well considering the state of a series 
on life support. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll see," said Kaplan. "I'm having supper with Marty this week and we'll see 
if he picks up the tab."

TONI CHILDS DELIGHTS HER DISCIPLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a performance that swung wildly between the inspirational and the 
insufferable at the Palace, Toni Childs came off as something of a Carly Simon 
figure for the '80s: a soulful-sounding, striking-looking thoroughbred with a 
major mouth, an aristocratic air and a dose of smugness. 
</P>
<P>
The Palace show Thursday night marked a slight step up in status from her last 
local date at the Roxy, but Childs is the kind of artist whose progress is 
measured in intensity of response, not in number of bodies. Like Simon, Joni 
Mitchell and a few others, she's more a guru than a plain performer, and her 
audience seems more like disciples than just fans. 
</P>
<P>
The downside of that loyalty on Thursday was the gush-fests between songs. The 
needle went clear off the indulgence meter when Childs, having proclaimed 
herself proud to be a "hippie," led the crowd in a game of Simon Says. Maybe 
she wants to be a Grace Slick figure for the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the music that was so rudely interrupted helped explain the strong 
bond. Though she took time to demonstrate that she is neither a rock 'n' roller 
nor a torchy blues singer, her powerful voice trumpeted with authority on the 
progressive-flavored pop of the best songs from her album "Union." 
</P>
<P>
The minimally accompanied version of "Where's the Ocean" and the fervent 
rendition of "Stop Your Fussin" represented her range, from intimate 
expressions of yearning to big statements about life. In both performances she 
connected directly with an emotional core, and the show hit a crescendo on 
"Fussin" when she issued a call to social action before taking the song into a 
charged call-and-response finale. RICHARD CROMELIN

POP BEAT: SLICK RICK: MAKING MUSICAL ADVENTURES IN RAPLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Slick Rick doesn't look like most rappers. He's toothpick-thin, with a black 
patch over his right eye -- sightless since it was struck by shattered glass 
when he was 18 months old. His smile sparkles with gold teeth decorated with 
diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
Rick's accent is a startling mixture of Bronx and British, a result of growing 
up in England and moving to the Bronx when he was 12. Otherwise, Slick Rick's 
traits -- the swagger, the rebelliousness, the swearing -- are normal for 
rappers. 
</P>
<P>
At a hamburger joint in West Hollywood on a recent afternoon, he was explaining 
how good he is -- also typical for a rapper. 
</P>
<P>
"My stuff hits home, it hits hard," he boasted. "I'm a great rapper. I have 
insight. I have humor. I have it all. Some people say my material is offensive 
-- that's their problem. They should listen to something else if they don't 
like me." 
</P>
<P>
On his Def Jam/Columbia album, "The Great Adventures of Slick Rick," Rick's 
coy, droning, playful raps make him sound, as someone once cracked, like an 
English gentleman on speed. The music is eclectic, branching out in all 
directions, highlighted by bizarre rhythm patterns. The album -- which is No. 1 
on the black-music charts and has sold nearly 750,000 copies -- includes 
standard radio fare, like the tame, sentimental "Teenage Love." But there's 
also the riotous, X-rated "Indian Girl" and "Children's Story," a violent, 
clever bedtime tale. 
</P>
<P>
Rick, whose last name is Walters, grew up in London. When he was 12 his 
parents, who are of Jamaican ancestry, moved to the Bronx. He was an art major 
at a special New York high school for musicians and artists. 
</P>
<P>
Rick first gained fame as part of Doug E. Fresh's Crew. In 1985, they did a 
12-inch single whose B-side, "La-Di-Da-Di" -- a racy, rambling romp featuring 
Rick's distinctive, smug style -- established him as a rapper on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
Then Rick, 25, hooked up with rap impresario Russell Simmons, head of Rush 
Artist Management. It was the beginning of what Rick called "the ugly 
adventure." 
</P>
<P>
Rick disappeared for three years. Rumors circulated that he was a drug casualty 
-- in jail or even dead. But he says he was really just working all that time 
on the album. 
</P>
<P>
Though he co-wrote the album, Rick is not fond of some of the production or the 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of versions of the songs on the album aren't the best versions," he said. 
"What they put on the album is garbage compared to what could have been on 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Rick claimed Simmons was trying to turn him into a pop-rapper, like another 
Simmons client, D.J. Jazzy Jeff. "I wanted the album to be real and he wanted 
it to be more like that phony stuff Jazzy Jeff does -- that namby-pamby, 
whitewashed junk," Rick said. 
</P>
<P>
A primary point of contention is money. "Russell says I owe him $120,000 for 
all the work done on the album," Rick said, fuming. "It's more like $40,000 -- 
and that's stretching it." 
</P>
<P>
Rick can't wait for June, when, he said, he'll be contractually free of 
Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
For emphasis, Rick tore off a small piece of his hamburger bun, put it down on 
the table and pounded it with his fist. 
</P>
<P>
"Get me Rick on the phone!," Russell Simmons yelled to an associate during a 
separate, later interview. "We'll straighten this out now." But Rick wasn't 
around. 
</P>
<P>
First, Simmons, 31, responded to Rick's charges about the $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Rick doesn't understand the money part of this. A lot of artists are like 
that. They don't add things up right sometimes. I advance him money all the 
time. Technically, he owes me that $120,000. It comes out of what he'll earn on 
the album." 
</P>
<P>
When asked about Rick's contract terminating in June, Simmons replied, "That's 
not right. It's a five-year contract. In June, it will be 2 1/2 years." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, despite his initial anger, Simmons didn't seem to take Rick's 
comments that seriously. "He's an artist," Simmons calmly pointed out. "They 
all have these mood swings. One day he's mad and the next day he's bringing me 
a bottle of champagne and we're laughing and having fun. He hasn't brought me a 
bottle of champagne in a while, though." 
</P>
<P>

RATHER TO COVER SINO-SOVIET SUMMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY SHARBUTT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last February, what some called the Battle of the Burberrys erupted when 
trench-coated Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw and Peter Jennings went to Japan to cover 
the funeral of Emperor Hirohito and report on the changing social, economic and 
political conditions there. 
</P>
<P>
Next week, though, only CBS' Rather of network anchordom's Big Three will be in 
China anchoring coverage of the Sino-Soviet summit meeting of Soviet leader 
Mikhail Gorbachev and China's Deng Xiaoping, the first such meeting since 1958. 
</P>
<P>
Rather will have a cable competitor: CNN's Bernard Shaw, who, backed by three 
correspondents, also will be anchoring there, starting Sunday, when he'll do 
three live newscasts, starting at 4 p.m. PDT. 
</P>
<P>
ABC and NBC will have correspondents in China -- three for NBC and four for 
ABC, including one for ABC's "Nightline." But anchormen Peter Jennings of ABC 
and Tom Brokaw of NBC are staying home this time, their networks say. 
</P>
<P>
The CBS expedition is by no means as ambitious as the $2.5-million pilgrimage 
the network mounted for the Japan trip, when Rather's newscast, "48 Hours" and 
"CBS This Morning" all originated from Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
But five CBS correspondents will be part of a week's worth of "CBS Evening 
News" broadcasts from China that start Monday, preceded by a special 90-minute 
"Sunday Morning" that Charles Kuralt will anchor from there. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to reporting whatever news emerges from next week's summit, all 
three networks and CNN will be doing stories that seek perspective on the 
meeting and what all this means for communism. 
</P>
<P>
Rather considers the CBS expedition part of what he calls a "new wave" in 
network news coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that network news is sometimes at its best when it's concentrating 
on those things that affiliated stations either cannot do, or choose not to do 
themselves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the China trip, he said, is to strike more of a balance in 
foreign coverage, giving the Pacific Rim as much attention as the Atlantic 
side. 
</P>
<P>
Asserting that print and TV journalism "historically has been too 
European-focused," he said he's "trying to get us to have more balance between 
looking across the Atlantic and looking across the Pacific." 
</P>
<P>
Rather, who first went to China in 1972, covering President Richard Nixon's 
historic trip, also says that being on the scene again in a much-changed China 
will help him deal with future stories about that nation. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't think, from a windowless room on the West Side of Manhattan, that 
you can expect to be in touch with the world simply through technology," he 
said. "You've got to be a wear-out-shoe-leather, go-there reporter at least 
some of the time. Otherwise, you're out of touch." 
</P>
<P>
While ABC's Jennings isn't going to China, a network spokeswoman said that he 
and "World News Tonight" will broadcast from Brussels and London, starting May 
29, as part of ABC's coverage of the coming NATO meetings. 
</P>
<P>
A CBS spokeswoman said that it's expected that Rather and his "CBS Evening 
News" also will will do that. An NBC spokeswoman said there are no plans for 
Brokaw's "NBC Nightly News" to make that trip.

ASHKENAZY ON TAPE AT CRYSTAL CATHEDRAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A special Mother's Day worship service featuring a taped performance by 
renowned pianist Vladimir Ashkenazy will take place at 9 and 11 a.m. Sunday at 
Garden Grove's Crystal Cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
Ashkenazy's recital was taped in the 3,000-seat cathedral on May 3 before his 
performance at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. He gave a private recital of 
Brahms' Rhapsody in E flat, Opus 119, according to Colleen Johnson, assistant 
program director at Crystal Cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Schuller happens to know him (Ashkenazy) personally and asked him to come 
perform and he did," Johnson explained.

Curtain calls galore highlight Sunday night's TV schedule as two trend-setting 
series and the longest and most expensive miniseries of all time take their 
final bows. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's "Family Ties" unravels in a special 70-minute episode beginning at 8 p.m. 
Sunday (4)(36)(39) as Alex (Michael J. Fox) finally leaves home for a 
high-powered job on Wall Street after seven seasons of wisecracks and tears in 
the Keatons' Columbus, Ohio, kitchen. The final show includes a curtain call 
featuring hugs and goodbys from the entire cast. As a preview to the end, KTTV 
Channel 11 will air the very first episode of the series Sunday at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
In a less ballyhooed finale, the once-proud cast of "Moonlighting," plagued 
this season by dismal ratings, will also bid farewell Sunday at 8 p.m. 
(7)(3)(10)(42). The razor-tongued Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd, once the 
daring darlings of television, star for the last time. 
</P>
<P>
And with the death of F.D.R., Hitler's suicide and the collapse of the Third 
Reich, the 29 1/2-hour saga of the Henry family, "War and Remembrance," draws 
to a climactic conclusion Sunday at 9 p.m. on ABC (7)(3)(10)(42). 
</P>
<P>
For those with an eye toward current history, Cable News Network will offer 
live coverage of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit to China 
beginning Sunday at 2 p.m. STEVE WEINSTEIN

TRAILBLAZERS CHALLENGE LA TUNA CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rising above the southeast end of the San Fernando Valley, the Verdugo 
Mountains are a surprisingly rugged, usually overlooked place to hike. One 
reason the mountains are an overlooked destination is the scarcity of hiking 
trails. 
</P>
<P>
Just-completed La Tuna Canyon Trail is the first foot trail built in modern 
times to explore these mountains. The trail was built by Los Angeles 
Conservation Corps under the leadership of Ron Webster. The Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy, a state conservation agency, provided funds for the 
project. A ribbon-cutting ceremony to officially dedicate the new trail as well 
as the 1,015-acre La Tuna Canyon Park is scheduled for May 21 at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"The mountains are really steep and presented quite a challenge to trail 
builders," said Webster, who, with his band of young workers, recently put the 
finishing touches on La Tuna Canyon Trail. Steep slopes, sizzling-hot days, 
poison oak and heavy brush were some of the obstacles the corps had to overcome 
to build the trail. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Conservation Corps is a private, nonprofit organization that 
specializes in giving young people, ages 18-23, work experience in the great 
outdoors. The corps is funded by grants from the City of Los Angeles, state 
agencies such as the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and private 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Members begin each work day with half an hour of calisthenics at corps 
headquarters, a former fire station at the corner of 29th and Main streets in 
Los Angeles. The 70 full-time employees then are divided into crews and 
dispatched to work sites around the county. Brush clearance, tree planting, 
landscaping and recycling are among the physically demanding tasks the groups 
undertake. 
</P>
<P>
A corps specialty is trail building. A crew of half a dozen young workers 
labored five months to construct La Tuna Canyon Trail. 
</P>
<P>
"We moved a lot of dirt and dug up a lot of brush," Trina Bird, trail foreman, 
said. "Now that I see the trail finished, I feel it was worth all the work." 
</P>
<P>
Hikers who have hiked a lot of trails will be delighted with the look and feel 
of La Tuna Canyon Trail. The hand-built trail follows the lay of the land and 
is not at all obtrusive. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to blow hikers' minds when they get out here and see the waterfall, 
the oaks and sycamores and the great views from Horny Toad Ridge," Webster 
said. "Plus, aesthetically, this trail's really beautiful."

CALIFORNIA CAVE TRIPS OFFER EXPLORATORY PLUNGE INTO ABYSS OF ANCIENT EARTHLY 
DELIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER BENNETT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you're looking for a pristine getaway that promises unforgettable beauty, 
the lure of the abyss and the rare exhilaration of discovery, spend a weekend 
underground -- exploring caves. 
</P>
<P>
"Caving is about the spirit of adventure," said John Scheltens, a civil 
engineer and president of the National Speleological Society based in 
Huntsville, Ala. "You're constantly asking yourself what's around the next 
corner . . . the next bend." 
</P>
<P>
Schelten's wife, Pat, values the friendships she has made in more than 12 years 
of caving. "It's an uncommon group of people -- nuclear scientists, engineers, 
plumbers, teachers and so forth -- who share the common goal of exploring and 
preserving one of our last frontiers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best place to start is at a meeting of the Southern California 
Grotto of the National Speleological Society. Members meet at the Pasadena 
Library the first Tuesday of every month at 7 p.m. to show slides of recent 
outings and to preview upcoming trips. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Right Direction 
</P>
<P>
"Local grottoes can point novices in the right direction so they don't endanger 
themselves or the environment," Scheltens said. "Caving is like anything else. 
To enjoy it, you have to know what you're doing. We certainly don't want people 
out there with just a flashlight." 
</P>
<P>
Grotto members show a willingness to share information with those who express a 
serious interest in underground exploration, although some hard-core spelunkers 
are tight-lipped when asked to disclose their favorite caves. They worry about 
vandals with spray cans and curiosity seekers who stray from clearly marked 
paths inside the caves for picture-taking or mischief-making. 
</P>
<P>
"Living caves are extremely vulnerable to any form of human intrusion" said 
Eldon Hughes, past chairman of the Angeles Chapter of the Sierra Club. "The oil 
from the touch of a single fingertip can abruptly halt the growth of a 20-foot 
stalactite that has been forming at the rate of 1 inch per 100 years." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cave Allies on the Hill 
</P>
<P>
Cave conservationists are recruiting powerful allies on Capitol Hill. Last 
November, Congress passed the Cave Resources Protection Act (100-691), which 
authorizes the aggressive protection and conservation of the nation's 
underground caverns. And the California Cave Protection Act (Section 623 of the 
California Penal Code) is another example of the new measures now on the books. 
If a souvenir hunter snaps off a stalactite, he is breaking not only a bridge 
to the past but also the law. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody who's in it (caving) is trying to keep it as pure as it was," said 
Lisa DeLuchia, a Southern California Grotto member and television publicist for 
KCOP. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to their concern for conservation, many members of the underground 
believe caving is in danger of becoming the next yuppie sport. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to go snow skiing with the rest of L.A.," said DeLuchia, who 
spent a recent holiday with her husband, Don, 1,000 feet underground in 
Lechuguia Cavern in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
If you get below the surface to probe some of the planet's deepest and darkest 
mysteries, take precautions: Any cave that is not commercial -- one without 
benefit of a guided tour, professional lighting systems, well-marked paths and 
the like -- can be extremely hazardous. Even seasoned cavers rarely travel in 
groups of fewer than four and with fewer than three sources of light. And 
always remember the caving credo: "Take nothing but pictures, leave nothing but 
footprints and kill nothing but time." 
</P>
<P>
For those who are eager to be underground, here are some places to go: 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell Caverns 
</P>
<P>
Spring is an ideal time to visit Mitchell Caverns, which are part of the 
Providence Mountains State Recreation Park in the Eastern Mojave Desert. 
</P>
<P>
At an elevation of 4,300 feet, the limestone caves retain a temperature of 65 
degrees and feature a wide variety of spectacular formations. 
</P>
<P>
The Chemehuevi Indians settled on the Providence mountain slopes about 500 
years ago. Charred cavern walls and hidden caches of food and tools are 
evidence of their frequent visits to the caves. The Indian way of life began to 
change in earnest in the mid-1800s as miners, explorers, settlers and the Army 
began arriving in large numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Chemehuevis live on a reservation next to the Colorado River, but 
members of the tribe occasionally return to the place of their ancestors and 
even take the Mitchell Caverns tour, according to George Hernandez, who leads 
visitors through the caverns. 
</P>
<P>
"They always add some personal stories and remembrances that you won't find in 
any official history of the area," Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
The Mitchell Caverns owe their name to Jack and Ida Mitchell, who in the 1920s 
ran a successful construction and real-estate business in Los Angeles. Then 
Jack inherited a silver mine in Kingman, Ariz., and on one of his frequent 
trips to work the mine, he stopped in Essex, where a rancher told him about the 
caverns in the Providence Mountains 23 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
With grand visions of the West's newest tourist attraction, Mitchell soon 
gained the rights to the caves by staking claims in the area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bottom Fell Out 
</P>
<P>
The Great Depression dried up Mitchell's financial resources and his potential 
pool of sightseeing customers. Disconsolate, he returned to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The couple eventually moved 
</P>
<P>
back to the caverns and in 1934, began offering tours to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, Jack was killed in 1954 when a car he was working on rolled off its jack. 
</P>
<P>
Later that year, the State of California purchased 97 acres from the Mitchell 
family. The official grand opening as part of the state park was in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 The caverns are open Sept. 16 through June 15. Tickets: adults, $3; children 
6-17, $1. From Los Angeles, take Interstate 15 north to Barstow, head east on 
Interstate 40 to Essex Road turnoff. Go north on Essex Road for 17 miles, park 
below the visitors' center. Campsites are $6 a night. 
</P>
<P>
 The park also is the home of the Cave of the Winding Stair, 1 1/2 miles north 
of Mitchell Caverns. Because of its level of difficulty, qualified cavers must 
make reservations at least two weeks in advance, sign waivers and undergo a 
sort of dress rehearsal in front of the ranger before he hands them the keys to 
the cave gate. 
</P>
<P>
 Write Providence Mountains State Recreation Area, Post Office Box 1, Essex, 
Calif. 92332-0001. There is no phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Pisgah Lava Tubes 
</P>
<P>
Described as caves only a geologist could love, the Pisgah lava tubes are, 
nonetheless, examples of caves created by volcanic action. The lava that spewed 
from the volcano cooled and solidified on the surface and also hardened along 
the ground. Streams of molten rock then flowed through the slowly hardening 
channels and drained away, leaving a network of tunnels behind. 
</P>
<P>
The horizontal passageways here are small and cramped, unlike some of the lava 
tubes in Lava Beds National Monument in Northern California. The lava tubes are 
on land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management and the Twin Mountain 
Quarry Rock Co., about 35 miles east of Barstow. 
</P>
<P>
 For access, call Ken Schulte of the BLM at (619) 256-3591, Monday through 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 La Jolla Sea Caves 
</P>
<P>
For thousands of years, the fury of waves blasting into the sandstone cliffs 
has carved out the seven sea caves of La Jolla. The largest cave is called 
Sunny Jim, which at the entrance looks like the profile of a man's head. While 
it's not known who "Sunny Jim" was, one popular theory suggests he was a 
comic-strip character at the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Access to Sunny Jim is through a man-made tunnel from the La Jolla Cave and 
Shell Shop, 1325 Coast Blvd. Visitors descend 133 steps, then cross a walkway 
to a platform near the ocean entrance of the cave. Take a moment to contemplate 
the great natural forces at work, because there's only one way back -- the same 
133 steps you came down. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the tunnel began innocently enough in 1902, when Gustav Schulz, 
a German professor, began digging with a pick and shovel for fossils in the 
sandstone. About halfway up, he decided to complete the tunnel so that it would 
exit into his cabin, which is the present-day curio shop. The next year, 
visitors were hauling themselves up and down the 125-foot tunnel with ropes to 
meet Sunny Jim face to face. While there are no man-made tunnels to the other 
six caves, they can be viewed from the sandstone bluffs above. 
</P>
<P>
 Fee: adults, $1; children 3-11, 50 cents. Exit the La Jolla Village Drive 
turn-off and head west to Torrey Pines Road. Turn left and proceed to Prospect 
Place. Turn right and continue to Coast Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The Northern part of California is honeycombed with caves. A few of the more 
popular ones that are well within the reach of Southern California are: 
</P>
<P>
Crystal Cave 
</P>
<P>
Discovered in 1918 by two trout fishermen, Crystal Cave in Sequoia National 
Park sparkles with delicate crystals, translucent pastel draperies and 
pencil-thin stalactites. The Sequoia Natural History Assn. conducts 45-minute 
tours Friday through Monday, May through June 16, and daily through Sept. 11. 
There's a long waiting list for the extended tour -- limited to eight people 
who are outfitted with overalls, knee pads and helmet lights -- which takes 
visitors to little-known areas of the cave. Cost: $35 per person, by 
reservation only. 
</P>
<P>
 For information and reservations, write the Sequoia Natural History Assn. of 
Ash Mountain, Box 10, Three Rivers, Calif. 93271, or call (209) 565-3341, Ext. 
234. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyden Cave 
</P>
<P>
Boyden Cave in Kings Canyon National Park, open May through October, is a 
1,000-foot marble cave that runs beneath part of the massive Kings Gate. The 
50-minute walking tour is $4 for adults, $2 for children 6-12. 
</P>
<P>
 Write Boyden Cave, P.O. Box 78, Vallecito, Calif. 95251, or phone (209) 
736-2708. 
</P>
<P>
 Moaning Cave 
</P>
<P>
Located near Angel's Camp in the Mother Lode, Moaning Cave is a limestone cave 
dominated by one room that is big enough to house the Statue of Liberty. For 
the daring, a 180-foot rappel into the cave is offered for $20. 
</P>
<P>
"We've taken almost 20,000 people down into the cave with a perfect success 
record," manager Jim Algeo said. 
</P>
<P>
For the fainthearted, a walking tour via the spiral staircase is $5 for adults 
and $2.50 for children 6-12. There's also a three-hour general spelunking trip 
for $35 that includes the rappel and the deeper exploration of the caverns. 
Reservations are required. 
</P>
<P>
 Write Moaning Cave, P.O. Box 78, Vallecito, Calif. 95251, or phone (209) 
736-2708. 
</P>

A FAIRE TO REMEMBER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Revelers and carousers in motley, with the wind in their faces and ribbons in 
their hair, can dance a jig and rejoice: The annual Renaissance Pleasure Faire 
is back, starting this weekend and continuing weekends through June 25. After a 
long search for a place to relocate the elaborate 16th-Century setting, a home 
was found near Devore in San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
So, m'lords and ladies, freemen and women everywhere, 'tis time again to pull 
out your leggings and leather vests, the long skirt and peasant blouse and your 
desire for a Renaissance good time. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 15 years, the Faire was held in the soft, oak-shaded hills of 
Agoura at the old Paramount Ranch. When that site was tentatively approved for 
a single-family home development, the search began for a new location. In late 
March, the San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors gave permission to hold 
the event at Glen Helen Regional Park, site of the 1982 and 1983 U.S. Festival, 
which drew 175,000 a people a day. (The Faire is expected to attract about 
12,000 people a day.) 
</P>
<P>
The new site, several acres larger than the previous one, has two lakes (aptly 
named Willow Pond and Lake Elizabeth, which the Faire will surround on three 
sides), ample shade from a plethora of trees and cool grass instead of dust and 
straw to stroll over as you appreciatively eye the handmade wares for sale. 
And, like the previous Faire, to keep the mood Elizabethan, the parking will be 
out of sight behind Faire structures. 
</P>
<P>
The setup will remain pretty much the same personable yet grungy affair, what 
with hawkers, buskers, men and maids of "questionable reputations" strolling 
and entertaining through the crowds, bright banners and flowered garlands 
overhead, and many, many places to part a soul from his coins. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coins From Metal 
</P>
<P>
Booths that show as much character as their owners will once more display 
handmade ceramics, glass, clothes, jewelry and perfumed oils. 
</P>
<P>
New this year in the crafts area is a coin striker who will demonstrate the 
production of finished coins from raw metal. Also new is a woodworker who will 
make lathe-turned vases from hardwood. In its second year is a bronze foundry, 
where the smith casts goblets and sometimes face masks (your face can be done 
-- from a plaster mold, of course). 
</P>
<P>
You also can have your fortune told, your body massaged, your runes cast and 
your aura read, but it's those "past" entertainments, and not so much the 
future, that are so engrossing in this little bit of the 16th Century. 
</P>
<P>
New on the agenda also is a rounders tournament (a predecessor to baseball) 
organized by Wells Twombly, sports director for Community Outreach for the 
Living History Center, producers of the Faire. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Renaissance Rules 
</P>
<P>
"We have 14 teams signed up (with 12 members each; though only eight play at a 
time)," Twombly says. "In rounders, there are eight outs because there are 
eight players, so a whole inning entails 16 outs. On top of everything else, 
there are no strikes and no balls. 
</P>
<P>
"Outs occur by catching the ball in the air, catching the ball on one bounce 
with one hand or hitting the runner with the ball as he's running," Twombly 
says. "Everyone has to get a hit. Just touching the ball with a bat constitutes 
a hit. The only foul area we recognize is hitting a ball into the stands." 
</P>
<P>
The game was the predecessor to a game played in the United States in the early 
1800s called "townball" (played on the town green). The tournament will be 
played every day at 4:30 p.m. until the Faire closes at 6 p.m. There will be 
feature games earlier in the day and pickup games with Faire-goers joining the 
teams. See the schedule board at the horse-tournament area for specific games. 
</P>
<P>
There also will be demonstrations of battledore (predecessor to badminton, 
played with leather paddles), goff (the old version of golf, played with a 4 
1/2-foot club) and football -- sort of a combination of Rugby and soccer, from 
which both games actually were derived. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Time to Eat 
</P>
<P>
In the delectable, savory, mouth-watering and messy food stuffs, one may wander 
and make a splash with a turkey drumstick dripping with sauce, or attempt to 
keep sherbets and ices from running down the chin. There are cookies and 
artichokes and baklava and piroshki, Turkish coffee, English ale and lemonade. 
</P>
<P>
A new catering booth, aside from its a la carte service, has set up a feast you 
may join (for $12.50 and a reservation). You sit at a communal table, are 
served by costumed performers and partake of a grand meal consisting of a 
Cornish hen in nutted wine sauce, pork baby-back ribs, steamed vegetables with 
cheese sauce, fresh baked loaves of bread and your choice of a poached pear 
filled with carob cream or baked apple, all washed down with iced tea. Beer and 
wine are extra. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reservations Required 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that reservations are required in advance (taken the day you are 
there only if there's room). The number for reservations: (714) 642-0262. 
Seating for 30, twice a day. 
</P>
<P>
But more than all the food, crafts and extravaganzas, mummers, jugglers and 
belly dancers, it's the ambiance, the whole fragrance, color and swash of the 
Faire that make this event so special. Take a moment to sit somewhere and watch 
the Faire-goers and players. Take a moment to really drift back and imagine 
yourself in the 16th Century. 
</P>
<P>
It's better than beer and much more soul-satisfying than an amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
 From downtown Los Angeles take Interstate 10 (San Bernardino Freeway) to 
Interstate 15 north. Follow the signs to Interstate 215 south and exit 
immediately at Devore Road. From the east, take Interstate 215 north to Devore 
Road. Follow signs to parking. Tickets are available at Ticketmaster or May 
Co., by telephone (800) 52-FAIRE and at the gate. Admission: adults, $14.50; 
children 3-11, $7.50; seniors and students at the gate, $11.50. Children under 
3, free.

<P>
It's Founders Day in Fullerton, and those intrepid souls who first settled the 
Orange County city would scarcely recognize the place, at least not today and 
definitely not at the Street Faire. 
</P>
<P>
With free shuttle service wheeling visitors to and from the "fair grounds" 
(Pomona Avenue, between Chapman and Commonwealth avenues), the celebration, 11 
a.m. to 4 p.m., is a continuation of a pancake breakfast, a 10 a.m. parade down 
Harbor Boulevard and Open Houses at the police and fire departments. 
</P>
<P>

With a tea party, vaudeville show and Victorian home tour in the offing, this 
Mother's Day weekend shows real potential for a non-commercial, old-fashioned 
celebration. Best of all, children can escort their mothers to family events 
without breaking the piggy bank. 
</P>
<P>
At Heritage Square Museum in Highland Park, a mother accompanied by a child 
will be admitted at half-price. In addition to touring the carefully restored 
homes, there will be a fashion show of Victorian clothing on the lawn 
throughout the afternoon. Guides, dressed in period costume, will conduct tours 
of the village and some of the homes, including the spectacular Hale House. 
</P>

Heritage Square is located at 3800 Homer St., off the Avenue 43 exit of the 
Pasadena Freeway. Admission: adults, $4.50; free to children under 12. Hours: 
noon to 4 p.m. Information: (818) 796-2898. 
</P>
<P>
The Discovery Museum of Orange County celebrates Mother's Day today with an 
old-fashioned tea party, in the museum's new Centennial Garden. With classical 
music filling the air and dainty sandwiches, tea cakes, scones and preserves 
filling the appetite, youngsters and their mothers also can visit the Kellogg 
House, which is being restored by the museum. 
</P>
<P>
The tea party begins at 11:30 a.m. today. Admission is $10 for adults, $7 for 
children 12 and under. Reservations are suggested. The museum is at 3101 W. 
Harvard St. in Santa Ana. Information: (714) 540-0404. 
</P>

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE

<TEXT>
<P>
Free-Mail Issue 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 174 to 231, the House defeated legislation (HR 1149) allowing 
members of Congress to mail copies of the Constitution bearing their name to 
all households back home. The bill sought to ease franking, or free-mail, rules 
to permit the onetime mass mailing at a projected cost of $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Lindy Boggs (D-La.) said the mailing would be "a great service to all 
of the people of the United States" in this bicentennial year of the Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.) called the bill "another congressional 
boondoggle . . . another chance to make ourselves look good at our 
constituents' expense." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the bill.

The 1990 Budget 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 263 to 157, the House approved a fiscal 1990 congressional budget 
resolution that envisions $1.17 trillion in spending, $1.07 trillion in 
revenues and a deficit of about $99.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The measure (HR 106) will guide House and Senate action on individual spending 
bills for the year beginning Oct. 1, and prod Congress toward 
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction goals. It also states congressional and 
presidential priorities for defense, foreign and domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
Lacking major tax increases or spending cuts, the House budget was widely 
viewed as a status quo plan that repeats the congressional pattern of pushing 
tough fiscal decisions into the next year. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) voiced support of the measure even though "we lacked 
the political will on both sides of the aisle to bite the bullet." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Bill Schuette (R-Mich.) called the plan "a coverup for inaction, 
postponing for tomorrow . . . real deficit reduction." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the fiscal 1990 budget plan.

Budget Freeze 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 30 to 393, the House rejected a budget substitute seeking greater 
deficit reduction primarily at the expense of domestic programs. The amendment 
by Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio) sought a 1990 deficit of $91.1 billion rather than 
the $99.7 billion targeted by the congressional budget resolution (above). It 
sought to curb Medicare outlays and block inflation-adjusted increases in 
certain non-entitlement domestic programs, and reaffirmed the defense spending 
freeze already a part of the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the substitute.

Oil Import Fee

The House voted 49 to 373 to reject an alternative fiscal 1990 budget, proposed 
by Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) that sought to increase federal revenue by $9 
billion annually by levying a fee on imported oil. About $3.2 billion of the 
yield was to have been applied to deficit reduction and the remainder to 
domestic initiatives such as anti-drug and anti-poverty programs. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported a federal fee on imported oil.

"punish" 54 other people was arrested Friday after a posse of Montana deputies 
chased him down in the rugged, snowcapped mountains of northern Idaho, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
David L. Schoenecker, 48, was arrested without incident by mounted Mineral 
County, Mont., deputies who had tracked him through the wooded, mountainous 
terrain of western Montana and eastern Idaho, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Seemann, a Montana Highway Patrol officer, said Schoenecker surrendered 
after being surrounded by Mineral County Sheriff Wade Van Gilder and 11 
deputies on foot and on horseback in an area of Idaho known as Hoodoo Pass. 
</P>
<P>
The pass through the Bitterroot Mountains along the Montana-Idaho border is 
just south of the point where Schoenecker's 1989 Pontiac was found abandoned on 
an old mining road Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Schoenecker was placed in the Mineral County Jail in Superior, Mont., and bail 
was set at $500,000. At an arraignment hearing, he indicated he would fight 
extradition to Anaheim, where he is wanted in the murder of his 40-year-old 
wife, Gail Schoenecker. 
</P>
<P>
Her body was discovered by police Thursday after Schoenecker allegedly sent a 
five-page letter to Orange County Register columnist Bob Emmers, claiming that 
he had killed his wife and telling Emmers where the body could be found. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim police searched the couple's north Anaheim home and found a body on a 
bed in the master bedroom that was identified Friday as Gail Schoenecker's. 
Police said she apparently had been dead for 5 or more days. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy revealed that the woman had died of a single gunshot wound to the 
head from a large-caliber weapon. At the time of Schoenecker's arrest, Montana 
authorities said he was carrying a .357-caliber revolver. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter to Emmers, Schoenecker made reference to a list he had left 
behind of people who would be "punished." Police said they found a list of 54 
names in the Schoenecker house, most of whom live in and around Milwaukee, 
Wis., where Schoenecker and his wife first met and lived. 
</P>
<P>
"Not everyone on the list will receive total punishment -- but they will be 
punished," Schoenecker said in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The 
Times. "The images in my mind shows me exactly how and when and where the 
punishment will be delivered. It has to be done." 
</P>
<P>
The letter gave no clues as to what allegedly precipitated the killing, and 
police remained puzzled over just why it happened. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no hatred -- I loved her -- but the action was necessary because I 
have a purpose and one that cannot have an interruption or interference," 
Schoenecker wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Before his arrest, Anaheim police expressed fear that Schoenecker planned to 
kill the people on the list, and they worked through Thursday night and early 
Friday notifying those named that they could be in danger. Some of the homes of 
people in the Milwaukee area were placed under police surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
One name on the list was Vincent M. Halsall, a vice president for Johnson 
Controls Inc. and Schoenecker's former employer. 
</P>
<P>
Schoenecker had some difficulties working with people, Halsall said, "but by 
and large he did a pretty good job." 
</P>
<P>
Halsall said he knew about 20 other people on the list, but "I don't know 
anyone on that list who I feel had anything in for David." 
</P>
<P>
Another person on the list was Dave Nuss, 49, of Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
"Last night I didn't sleep well," Nuss said. He and Schoenecker were high 
school classmates and were on the school football team, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Schoenecker's arrest in the hills of Idaho allayed Nuss' fears, and the focus 
of the investigation turned to bringing the former Globe Union Co. engineer to 
California to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
Schoenecker resigned from Globe in the late 1970s and was fired by two 
companies, said Halsall. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Marc Hedgpeth, an Anaheim police spokesman, said detectives would fly to 
Montana Friday night with an arrest warrant and seek to have Schoenecker 
returned to Orange County to face charges. 
</P>
<P>
At the 1912-vintage Mineral County jail, officials said Schoenecker was being 
held in a cell with three other men and seemed calm. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not talking to him," said Seemann, the state patrol officer. "We're 
waiting for them (Anaheim detectives) to get here. We don't want to violate his 
rights." 
</P>
<P>
Seemann said Schoenecker seemed neither afraid nor remorseful, and his only 
words since being jailed came after he was given a cup of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he didn't like hot drinks," the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
The capture of Schoenecker ended a nationwide manhunt that had focused both on 
the small mountain towns of Montana, where Schoenecker was traced to a motel 
last weekend and where his car was found abandoned, and on Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey O'Brien, a dispatcher for the Mineral County Sheriff's Department, said 
Schoenecker was first spotted Friday morning by two people on snowmobiles. He 
said Schoenecker was walking in snow in the Lolo National Forest with a 
backpack and sleeping bag. 
</P>
<P>
A posse of 12 men was formed, most of them volunteer firemen and 
search-and-rescue workers from Superior, to join the manhunt. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so deep (with snow) up there that we couldn't get snowmobiles in," 
O'Brien said. "We had to go in on foot and on horses." 
</P>
<P>
Advised by Anaheim police that Schoenecker was likely armed and dangerous, 
O'Brien said the deputies carried rifles and side arms and approached the 
suspect cautiously. As the posse moved in, O'Brien said a private helicopter 
borrowed by the Sheriff's Department scanned the Lolo National Forest and 
spotted Schoenecker trudging through the snow into Hoodoo Pass. 
</P>
<P>
The helicopter, carrying Sheriff Van Gilder, dropped the sheriff and a member 
of his posse south of Schoenecker as the posse moved in from the north. 
</P>
<P>
"The sheriff then headed back north toward Schoenecker," O'Brien said. "The 
rescue posse was headed south, so they had him surrounded." 
</P>
<P>
"We waited for him and let him get within 20 or 30 feet," Van Gilder said. 
</P>
<P>
Schoenecker surrendered peacefully and was returned to Superior in handcuffs by 
helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
After his arraignment, and before being returned to jail Friday, Schoenecker 
asked deputies if he could have the Bible, the Book of Mormon and reading 
glasses from his backpack, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
With the arrest of Schoenecker, speculation centered on what provoked the 
slaying and caused Schoenecker to allegedly threaten to punish the 54 people on 
the list. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that something happened to make him snap," said Sgt. Chet Barry 
of the Anaheim police. "It was well thought out over an extended period of 
time. I would say at least 3 years, but that is just an approximation." 
</P>
<P>
More than 24 hours after the body was found, police were still trying to 
develop a profile of the man that neighbors described as quiet and retiring, 
more likely to spend his days working on the lawn and playing with his two dogs 
than socializing with neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Even those who shared the cul-de-sac on East Amanda Circle in north Anaheim 
seemed unsure of where Schoenecker worked, with some speculating that he was 
self-employed in the computer business, and others saying he was a private 
contractor doing work for the county. 
</P>
<P>
What is known is that the Schoeneckers had moved to Orange County from 
Milwaukee in December, 1987. Gail Schoenecker took at job teaching fifth- and 
sixth-grade students at Adelaide Price School in Anaheim, where co-workers 
described her as industrious and friendly. 
</P>
<P>
Randall Wiethorn, the principal at the school, said that Schoenecker had called 
the substitute answering service last weekend to report that his wife would not 
be in because her mother had died. 
</P>
<P>
By Thursday, Wiethorn said the school became concerned when they could not 
reach her by telephone and called the police. By then, the body had been found. 
</P>
<P>
Wiethorn said Gail Schoenecker's students learned of her death Friday, and a 
staff psychologist was called in to answer their questions. In the afternoon, 
the students put together a large poster that turned into a kind of farewell 
card to their teacher. 
</P>
<P>
The couple belonged to the Yorba Linda United Methodist Church and attended 
regular Sunday services, and were remembered there as friendly, if not 
outgoing, people. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a total surprise to us," said Pastor Kenneth Criswell. "They were 
perceived here as very nice people. They seemed to want to know people, but in 
another respect they wanted to keep to themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Gail Schoenecker was a member of the church choir. She was to perform in 
concert the night her body was found. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Wyatt, bell choir director at the church, said the couple had wanted to 
adopt a child and had filled out preliminary paper work with the County 
Department of Social Services. She said Gail Schoenecker's inability to have 
children was the impetus for the adoption and was caused by a severe diabetic 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
"She was on medication and was very diligent about her health," Wyatt said. "If 
we would go out for pie and coffee she would have a piece of fruit or nothing." 
</P>
<P>
While neighbors said they occasionally heard the couple arguing, there seemed 
to be no warning of what would eventually happen. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter to the Register columnist, Schoenecker spoke of the "images" he 
had of people who had wronged him. 
</P>
<P>
"Several times I tried to explain these 'happenings' to Gail but she dismissed 
them," he wrote. "I was never understood. I knew that as these feelings and 
'pictures' continued to occur and repeat that I had to prepare a way, develop a 
plan, make arrangements. And I have done so." 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I had to eliminate my wife. She wouldn't believe me. She wouldn't even 
listen. So in order to keep her from finding out, I developed a separate plan 
or storyline that totally misled her, but it did make her happy. She was very 
happy on Friday."

THE KRAFT VERDICT; 
</P>
<P>
FIVE LONG YEARS: PROFILES OF THE KEY COURTROOM FIGURES IN KRAFT TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For some of the key figures in the Randy Steven Kraft trial, the case has 
dominated their professional and personal lives for more than 5 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I wake up at 3 o'clock in the morning thinking about the case," said Kraft 
attorney C. Thomas McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a look at some of the people most involved in the case: 
</P>
<P>
THE JUDGES 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin, 54. He has sent more men to Death Row 
(six to date) than any other judge in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
McCartin is well known among both prosecutors and the defense bar for his 
impatience with slow trials. He is also known for showing a quick temper one 
minute and a quick quip the next. McCartin sat through most of the Kraft trial 
in pain, wearing a brace because of a back injury. Still, when attorneys needed 
an extended recess and when jurors began deliberating, McCartin asked for 
other, short cases to hear. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Luis A. Cardenas, 44. Cardenas, responsible for overseeing 
the defense team's spending, remains one of the most controversial figures in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
Many in law enforcement have criticized the amount spent by the defense, which 
has not yet been made public. During closing arguments, for example, the 
defense lawyers staged a computer graphics presentation of moving color graphs 
and charts. Some officials say the defense could have saved taxpayer money by 
using cardboard instead. 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas' most controversial ruling was his decision to seal all the defense 
expenses on the case, including the salaries of the three defense lawyers. But 
Cardenas said it was the only way to assure that jury selection did not occur 
in the midst of public debate over the trial's costs. 
</P>
<P>
THE PROSECUTION 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown, 47. A former California "prosecutor of the 
year," Brown has succeeded in sending three other men to Death Row, including 
William G. Bonin, convicted of killing four young boys in Orange County, and 10 
others in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Brown is a supervisor in the district attorney's office. While he is highly 
rated by fellow prosecutors, some defense lawyers complain that Brown plays too 
much on his down-home, folksy image with jurors. 
</P>
<P>
Brown entered the Kraft case just a few hours after Kraft's arrest, when he was 
called at home to help prepare search warrants for Kraft's house and car. 
</P>
<P>
After the verdicts Friday, many were crediting Kraft's convictions in all 16 
murders to Brown's courtroom skills. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas M. Goethals, 37. He has been assigned as the legal 
motions specialist on the Kraft case for only about a year. But Goethals shined 
during the trial, when he dramatically argued that if Kraft testified, the 
defense did not have the right to limit Brown's cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Department investigator James A. Sidebotham, 53. Brown claims that 
Sidebotham was brilliant in his preparation of the three search warrants that 
produced most of the evidence against Kraft. 
</P>
<P>
Sidebotham set a record in the county for remaining on the witness stand for 
most of 5 months during the search warrant hearings. The defense challenged 
thousands of pieces of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Sidebotham sat in the back of the courtroom and listened to the 
guilty verdicts for Kraft. 
</P>
<P>
"We've only cleared the first hurdle," he said. 
</P>
<P>
THE DEFENSE 
</P>
<P>
C. Thomas McDonald, 47. McDonald left the public defender's office, where he 
was second-in-command, after the Board of Supervisors balked at allowing him to 
take a leave of absence to take the Kraft case. McDonald is known for his fiery 
courtroom demeanor. While many prosecutors dislike him intensely, he has many 
supporters among the defense bar. 
</P>
<P>
"If Kraft tells you he didn't kill anybody, then you need a lawyer like 
McDonald who will say OK, 'that's our position, now let's go in there and kick 
some tail,' " said fellow defense attorney Mike Horan. "Anybody who criticizes 
McDonald for getting fired up about Kraft's defense is crazy." 
</P>
<P>
James G. Merwin, 45. Although McDonald handled most of the trial, Merwin did 
much of the behind-the-scenes work, such as preparing the motion to sever the 
case into multiple trials, which the defense considered the most critical 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
It was Merwin who brought McDonald into the case. The two are longtime friends 
who had worked in the public defender's office together. 
</P>
<P>
Merwin impressed many courtroom observers with his closing arguments, in which 
he quoted Roman history, Abraham Lincoln, and his own mother. Merwin has been 
particularly sensitive to complaints about how much the Kraft defense was 
costing taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
"I regret taking this case every time I read that I'm stealing funds from the 
county," he said. 
</P>
<P>
William J. Kopeny, 38. Kopeny also left the public defender's office to take 
the Kraft case. His specialty is legal motions, and Merwin and McDonald 
consider him the best at what he does. While he lost most of his motions, 
Kopeny won high praise from fellow defense lawyers for his work. 
</P>
<P>
Kopeny, a strong opponent of the death penalty, contends that it was impossible 
for Kraft to receive a fair trial charged with so many counts.

Here is a list of the young men Kraft killed: 
</P>
<P>
Terry Lee Gambrel, 25, stationed at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, found 
dead in Kraft's car when Kraft was arrested May 14, 1983, on Interstate 5 in 
Mission Viejo. The Marine had been strangled with his own belt and bound at the 
wrists with his own shoelaces. Drugs identical to those Kraft possessed were 
found in his system. A missing shoelace from a victim's sneaker has been called 
a Kraft "signature," something prosecutors say is unique to the crimes and 
links them. 
</P>
<P>
Rodger James DeVaul Jr., 20, of Buena Park. His body was found Feb. 13, 1983, 
in Angeles National Forest north of Claremont Men's College, where Kraft 
graduated. Pictures of DeVaul were found in Kraft's possession, showing his 
wrists bound and a ligature mark on his neck. Drugs in his system matched those 
possessed by Kraft. Evidence showed that the body had been redressed, another 
key link with other murders. Kraft was acquitted of sodomizing DeVaul. 
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey Alan Nelson, 18, of Buena Park. Last seen with DeVaul on Feb. 12, 
1983, he was found dead at 5:20 that morning on the Euclid Street on-ramp to 
the Garden Grove Freeway in Garden Grove. Prosecutors alleged that the 
emasculation of the victim was one of Kraft's signatures. Fibers from the socks 
of another victim were found both on Nelson's corpse and in Kraft's car. Kraft 
was also linked with Nelson through the DeVaul pictures and drugs in Nelson's 
system. Prosecutors contended that Nelson and DeVaul are the 2 in 1 Beach 
referred to on a list found in Kraft's car. Kraft also was convicted of mayhem 
for the attack on Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Herbert Church, 21, of Coventry, Conn. He was found dead Jan. 27, 1983, 
along the northbound San Diego Freeway on-ramp to the San Gabriel River Freeway 
in Seal Beach. Prosecutors said the interchange area in Seal Beach was the site 
where several corpses were dumped, another Kraft signature. Church's razor and 
clothing and a picture of Church seated in Kraft's car were found in Kraft's 
possession. Drugs in his system matched those in the possession of Kraft. 
Ligature marks on the victim's neck and wrists were called a Kraft signature. 
Fibers from Church's maroon-colored socks were found in Kraft's car. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Wyatt Loggins Jr., 19, a Tustin Marine. His decomposed body was found in 
a plastic bag Sept. 3, 1980, on a dead-end El Toro street. Pictures of Loggins 
in nude poses were found in Kraft's possession. Prosecutors contend he is 
referred to by the notation MC HB Tattoo on Kraft's list, because he was last 
seen in Huntington Beach and was heavily tattooed. 
</P>
<P>
Donnie Harold Crisel, 20, a Tustin Marine. Found June 16, 1979, on the 
northbound Irvine Center Drive on-ramp to the San Diego Freeway in Irvine. He 
had ligature marks on his neck. Prosecutors called the burning of his left 
nipple with a cigarette lighter another Kraft signature. Crisel was considered 
Marine Drunk Overnight Shorts on Kraft's list because he was found only in his 
boxer shorts and had a high blood-alcohol level. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Joseph Inderbieten, 21, of Long Beach. Found Nov. 18, 1978, on the 
northbound 7th Street on-ramp to the San Diego and San Gabriel River freeways, 
considered a Kraft signature dumping ground. His eyelids had been burned with a 
cigarette lighter, also called a Kraft signature. Prosecutors said he was Dart 
405 on Kraft's list. Kraft also was convicted of sodomizing Inderbieten. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Arthur Klingbeil, 23, of Everett, Wash. Found July 6, 1978, on northbound 
Interstate 5 in Mission Viejo, less than half a mile from where Kraft was later 
arrested. Burnt left nipple, wrist marks and missing shoelace were called Kraft 
signatures. Klingbeil was Hike Out LB Boots on Kraft's list, prosecutors said, 
because he was in hiking boots and because advertising on a matchbook found at 
the crime scene indicates that he had hitchhiked through Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Allen Keith, 20, a Camp Pendleton Marine. Found June 19, 1978, along 
Moulton Parkway in Laguna Hills. Strangulation, wrist marks and drugs in his 
system matching those in Kraft's possession are all considered Kraft 
signatures. Strongest evidence may have been Marine Carson on Kraft's list; 
Keith was last seen leaving his girlfriend's house in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
Roland Gerald Young, 23, of Maywood. Found June 11, 1978, on Irvine Center 
Drive in Irvine, shortly after he was released from Orange County Jail on a 
public drunkenness charge. Kraft attorneys considered this their strongest 
case, because Young had been stabbed instead of strangled; they presented 
witnesses who they believed pointed to a young Mexican as the killer. But 
prosecutors considered Jail Out on the Kraft list damning evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Michael Hughes, 18, a Camp Pendleton Marine. Found April 16, 1978, on the 
Euclid Street on-ramp to the eastbound Riverside Freeway. Prosecutors contended 
that he is represented by the Euclid entry on the Kraft list. Missing shoelaces 
called a Kraft signature. Fibers found on his body matched samples taken from 
carpets from Kraft's house and garage. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Howard Hall, 22, of Santa Ana. Found Jan. 3, 1976, near Bedford Peak in 
Silverado Canyon. Emasculation, burnt eyes and nipples all called Kraft 
signatures. Because Kraft's fingerprints were found on a broken vodka bottle at 
the scene, prosecutors used Hall to tie Kraft to other signature deaths where 
no direct ties to him existed. Prosecutors consider Hall's murder to be the 
entry reading New Year's Eve on Kraft's list. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Daven Crotwell, 19, of Long Beach. His head was found on May 8, 1975, 
washed up near a marina jetty. His body was found in Laguna Hills on Oct. 18, 
1975, but no one realized the pieces were of the same corpse until after 
Kraft's arrest. Crotwell was last seen alive riding in a car with Kraft after 
they met at the Belmont Plaza parking lot. The Parking Lot entry on the Kraft 
list was considered to refer to Crotwell. Kraft's own statement to police in 
1975 that he had driven Crotwell to Orange County, to the same area where the 
body was found, was considered key prosecution evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Ronnie Gene Wiebe, 20, of Fullerton. Found July 30, 1973, on the eastbound 7th 
Street on-ramp to the San Diego Freeway in Seal Beach, which prosecutors called 
a Kraft signature dumping ground. Sexually mutilated, and the corpse had been 
redressed, with ligature marks on his neck. Prosecutors contended that Wiebe's 
death is 7th St. on the Kraft list. 
</P>
<P>
John Doe (never identified), found April 4, 1973, along Ellis Avenue in 
Huntington Beach. The corpse had been redressed. Prosecutors say Airplane Hill 
on Kraft list ties him to the murder, because that area of Huntington Beach was 
once known as Airplane Hill before it was developed. Edward Daniel Moore, 20, a 
Camp Pendleton Marine. Found Dec. 26, 1972, on the 7th Street off-ramp of the 
San Gabriel River Freeway in Seal Beach. The dumping of a corpse in the area 
was considered to be a Kraft signature. Ligature marks were found on his neck. 
The victim had been sexually mutilated, and the corpse had been redressed. 
Prosecutors contend that Moore's initials, EDM, appear the Kraft list.

<P>
When the next phase of Randy Steven Kraft's trial begins -- to determine 
whether he should die in the gas chamber -- prosecutors may link Kraft to even 
more murders than the jury has yet glimpsed. 
</P>
<P>
While Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown has not yet announced how many murders 
he will introduce during the so-called penalty phase, his office has tied Kraft 
in court papers to 29 murders in three states besides the 16 Orange County 
murders for which Kraft was convicted on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Kraft has been convicted 16 times, Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. James G. 
Enright said Friday, "I'm hoping I can talk Bryan (Brown) into paring down the 
numbers a little." 
</P>
<P>
In a penalty phase, a prosecutor can introduce any acts of violence, or acts 
which show a propensity for violence, by the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
In arguing that Kraft deserves the death penalty, the prosecutor is expected to 
rely heavily on the Orange County convictions. Here, however, is a look at how 
the other slayings might be included in the penalty phase: 
</P>
<P>
OREGON: SIX 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors would show the jurors that Kraft was in northern Oregon on business 
for Lear Siegler Inc. when six murders were committed between Portland and 
Salem between 1980 and 1982. Items belonging to two of those men were found at 
Kraft's house in Long Beach, prosecutors say. A third man's jacket was found on 
the floor of a hotel in Grand Rapids, Mich., where Kraft, on the same business 
trip, was staying a day after that slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Autopsies on the three other victims found drugs which Kraft was known to 
possess. And one of the Oregon victims was sexually mutilated in a way that 
bears similarities to some of the mutilations in the Orange County cases. 
</P>
<P>
The most damning evidence could be the list found in Kraft's car. It has six 
consecutive entries which begin with "Portland." 
</P>
<P>
MICHIGAN: TWO 
</P>
<P>
Records show that Kraft was on business for Lear Siegler in Grand Rapids, 
Mich., when two cousins attending a horticulture show at the Amway Grand Hotel 
there were killed in December, 1982. Kraft stayed at that hotel, and 
prosecutors claim that witnesses saw him talking to the two young men. Some of 
the victims' possessions were later found at Kraft's house, according to 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Again, prosecutors consider the list from Kraft's car as potent evidence. 
Directly after the six Oregon entries, Kraft has written "GR2." That means 
Grand Rapids 2, prosecutors contend. 
</P>
<P>
SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY: FOUR 
</P>
<P>
Items from two men found here were found at Kraft's house, according to 
prosecutors' court papers. One was Vincent Mestas, 23, of Long Beach. 
Prosecutors allege that "Vince M" on Kraft's list stands for his death. 
</P>
<P>
ORANGE COUNTY: SIX MORE 
</P>
<P>
Six murders in Orange County were not included in the charges against Kraft 
that went to trial last September. Some were still being investigated when 
Kraft's preliminary hearing occurred, and prosecutors could not add them to the 
charges without delaying the trial. 
</P>
<P>
But most of these deaths occurred in the early 1970s, and prosecutors so far 
have not shown physical evidence directly linking them to Kraft. Prosecutors 
primarily have relied on their similarities to 16 murders in the charges, plus 
the list found in Kraft's car. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors believe that Wayne Dukette, 30, found dead on Sept. 20, 1971, was 
Kraft's first victim. Dukette worked at the Stables Bar in Sunset Beach, which 
Kraft frequented. "Stable" is the first notation on the Kraft list. 
</P>
<P>
Some cases were not presented to the jury because the prosecution felt that the 
evidence was not compelling. For example, the body of 15-year-old Jeffrey Bryan 
Sayre of Santa Ana, who disappeared Nov. 24, 1979, has never been bound. 
Prosecutors so far have noted only two connections to Kraft: "Westminster Date" 
is on the Kraft list, which prosecutors say stands for Sayre, last seen after a 
date with a girl in Westminster. Also, he was seen at a bus stop near the home 
of Kraft's parents. 
</P>
<P>
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: THREE 
</P>
<P>
Single slayings in Los Angeles, Imperial, and San Diego counties were tied to 
Kraft by prosecutors in papers filed in court in 1983 and 1984. Two were linked 
to Kraft because of similarities with other victims. The third, that of 
21-year-old Mikeal Lane of Stanislaus County, was mentioned after prosecutors 
found his torn Social Security card among Kraft's possessions. Lane's body was 
found Jan. 9, 1984, in a remote area of northern San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
LOS ANGELES COUNTY: EIGHT 
</P>
<P>
Because these deaths were not added to the Kraft case by prosecutors until 
shortly before the trial, Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown is not expected to 
introduce them during the penalty phase. They were not included in the "notice 
of aggravation" prosecutors must file in death penalty cases. 
</P>
<P>
But Brown has tied these eight to Kraft through the list found in his car. If 
the defense tried to introduce the rest of the list in an attempt to show holes 
in Brown's theory, then the judge might permit Brown to introduce the Los 
Angeles deaths in rebuttal.

TRUCK LOSES BRAKES, SLAMS INTO CARS ON I-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 18-wheel tractor-trailer rig with faulty brakes plowed into congested 
traffic at 50 m.p.h. on southbound Interstate 5 Friday afternoon, causing minor 
injuries to three people and backing up cars for 7 miles until the wreck was 
cleared 3 hours later, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Treated for minor injuries at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center were 
Mike Dabney, 36, of Dana Point; Guillermo Montez, 28, of San Leandro; and Kathy 
Illera, 19, of Laguna Niguel, according to the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
The truck driver, Enrico Santo Romero, 43, of Tijuana, who was not hurt in the 
4 p.m. collision, was cited for speeding and operating an unsafe vehicle, 
California Highway Patrol spokesman Matt Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
Romero was southbound in the slow lane of the freeway just south of Oso Parkway 
when he tried to brake for slowing traffic ahead, Clark said. The brakes of the 
empty rig didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
Romero crashed into the rear of a Mercedes-Benz stopped in traffic, pushing it 
into another lane and into the rear of a Chevrolet, which rolled over twice 
before landing upright, Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
Romero's truck, still rolling forward, slammed into a Nissan that hit a station 
wagon, Clark said. Romero's truck plowed the now-tangled mass of cars for 
another 60 feet before stopping. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a miracle that there were only minor injuries," Clark said.

UNITARIAN CHURCH TO PRESENT 'ROE V. WADE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Unitarian Church of Orange County will host an informal reading of "Roe v. 
Wade," an original script by congregation member Ruth Shapin, at 10:30 a.m. 
Sunday at the church facility in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
The play describes the history behind the precedent-setting 1973 legal case, in 
which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that women have a constitutional right to 
abortion. That issue is now back for review before the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
"Unitarian women were very active in giving their support to the two women 
attorneys who first brought the case to the courts," said Rosalie Abrams, a 
church member and founder of the Orange County Feminist Repertory Theater. 
</P>
<P>
The play is based on the book, "Roe v. Wade" by Marian Faux and is directed by 
Abrams. 
</P>
<P>
"Mother's Day is a very important time to say something important about 
motherhood, that is, that we should be mothers by choice. We should have the 
option of having babies when we want them and can take care of them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The church is at 1120 W. Santa Ana St., Anaheim.

STATE TO BEGIN TESTING SOIL, AIR FOR OIL WASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State health officials will begin testing soil and air in a Westminster 
neighborhood next week to determine the hazard posed by a petroleum sludge that 
began oozing into back yards several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators from the state Department of Health Services will take soil 
samples from 12 homes built on an abandoned oil industry waste pit, said John 
Scandura, a supervising hazardous materials specialist in the department's 
toxics division. 
</P>
<P>
Results of the monthlong sampling are expected to be used to determine how long 
the cleanup will take, Scandura said. A cleanup plan is to be completed late 
this year, then circulated for public comment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 Westminster residents attended a Thursday night meeting with state 
health officials to discuss the soil and air tests in the neighborhood located 
east of the San Diego Freeway, near the Golden West Street off-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
Since the state first began looking into the pollution in 1987, the 
investigation has cost nearly $1 million, Scandura said. The site is on the 
state's Superfund cleanup list, and Scandura said the contamination may be 
serious enough to qualify the site for the federal Superfund program. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, state officials removed 25 drums, each containing 55 gallons of 
petroleum sludge, from beneath the site and conducted soil tests that showed 
the presence of low levels of benzene, a carcinogenic chemical.

CHARGES FILED AGAINST MAN IN RANCH SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Matthew G. Kaufman, the 25-year-old man wounded in a shoot-out with Orange 
County sheriff's deputies Monday, was charged with attempted murder, assault 
with a deadly weapon, possession of a firearm, auto theft, receiving stolen 
property and resisting arrest, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office filed the charges against Kaufman in the 
attempted murder of Sheriff's Deputies Steve Ripple, Wayne Peters and John 
Heppert Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman, whose last known address was in Portland, Ore., was originally 
approached by a deputy in Mission Viejo for driving a car reported stolen from 
San Francisco last month, police said. After the suspect led deputies on a 
5-mile chase from Mission Viejo to a residential cul-de-sac in the Nellie Gail 
Ranch area of Laguna Hills, a gun battle took place. 
</P>
<P>
A bullet grazed Ripple's forehead when Kaufman shot at the officers who had 
pursued him, authorities said. The other officers were not injured. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman, a fugitive wanted in Nevada for parole violation, was wounded in the 
chest, and a second bullet grazed his forehead when deputies cornered him on 
the front steps of a home he was trying to enter. 
</P>
<P>
He was taken to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center where he was listed in 
satisfactory condition Friday morning. When discharged, he will be in custody 
at Orange County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail. Ripple was discharged from the 
hospital earlier this week.

SENTENCED IN MURDER OF EX-GIRLFRIEND; 
</P>
<P>
KILLER FACES 25-YEAR-TO-LIFE TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A spurned lover convicted of killing his girlfriend and burying her body twice 
in the Mojave Desert was sentenced Friday to 25 years to life in state prison, 
the maximum allowed by law. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Lee Bishop Jr., 24, of Westminister was sentenced by Orange County 
Superior Court Judge Jean M. Rheinheimer in Santa Ana. Bishop was convicted of 
strangling, then drowning his ex-girlfriend, Marina Garcia, 23, of Huntington 
Beach, nearly a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a particularly deplorable crime, and we're pleased that (Bishop) was 
sentenced to the maximum allowable punishment," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard 
Toohey. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop's attorney, public defender David C. Biggs, said he felt the sentence 
was too harsh. Biggs contended that Bishop killed Garcia in a fit of passion, 
and was only guilty of manslaughter, punishable by a maximum of 11 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop was convicted of the June 3, 1988, murder of Garcia. A former girlfriend 
of Bishop's testified during the trial that she heard him mention the idea of 
killing Garcia the day before the murder. According to testimony, Garcia was 
attempting to end a long relationship with Bishop shortly before the crime. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Bishop choked and then drowned Garcia in the bathtub of her 
Huntington Beach home. After cleaning up the house, Bishop took her body and 
buried it in the desert near Victorville. He returned later with his brother to 
dig a deeper hole for fear that the body would be discovered. 
</P>
<P>
Biggs maintained his client killed Garcia in the heat of passion during a 
vicious argument and should have received a lighter sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"He will be punished like everyone else," Biggs said Friday. "But he is not 
like everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
He described Bishop as having learning difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop "understands very little of what is going on," Biggs said. "He only gets 
about a third of what he is hearing." 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutor Toohey disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"He certainly knew what he was doing that day" when the murder was committed, 
Toohey said. Bishop tried to feign ignorance about the crime by going to 
Garcia's father's house to ask where the victim was after her murder, Toohey 
said. He also cashed a paycheck that Garcia had just received, according to 
Toohey.

NEW SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE IS SWORN IN, LAWYER APPOINTED TO MUNICIPAL BENCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH T. YAMADA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian appointed two Orange County judges Friday, promoting a 
Municipal Court jurist and filling that vacancy with a Newport Beach lawyer, a 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Judge William R. Froeberg , 39, was sworn in as a Superior Court judge after 
having served 3 years as a Municipal Court judge in Santa Ana. He will be 
replaced on the Municipal Court bench by attorney Claude E. Whitney, 58. 
</P>
<P>
Froeberg said Friday that he is looking forward to the challenges of Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the complexity of the cases will be greater and the penalties will 
be greater" than Municipal Court, he said. "There will be more zeroes behind 
the numbers." 
</P>
<P>
Fairness will be of utmost importance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The ideal of every judge is to make sure everyone gets a fair hearing," he 
said. "That's the only preconceived notion I have." 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court judges earn $84,765 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Whitney, who was told Friday of his appointment to the $77,409 Municipal Court 
position, said he was "very excited" and "very surprised." He had applied for a 
judgeship 2 years ago and did not know he was being considered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope I can contribute in a meaningful way in speeding up the (legal) process 
so that people can have justice in a meaningful manner," Whitney said. 
</P>
<P>
Froeberg's Superior Court position was created by a trial court funding bill, 
AB 1197, which was signed by the governor Sept. 17, 1988, Deukmejian spokesman 
Kevin Brett said. The bill created 109 new judgeships throughout the state to 
ease the burden of an overworked court system. In Orange County, Froeberg's 
appointment fills the fourth of five judgeships created by the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Froeberg was selected because "he has 3 years' experience as a Municipal Court 
judge and has lengthy experience as an attorney in private practice," Brett 
said. "He is certainly more than qualified in the governor's mind to serve." 
</P>
<P>
Senior public defender Jim Spellman, who has appeared several hundred times 
before Froeberg in court, said the appointment was well deserved. 
</P>
<P>
"He was professional, he knew the law and he was fair to all sides," Spellman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Before being appointed to the bench, Froeberg practiced family law from 1975 to 
1986 in San Clemente, where he lives with his wife, Rosanne, a deputy district 
attorney in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Froeberg, born in Chicago and raised in Claremont, attended UC Riverside, where 
he graduated in 1971 with an undergraduate degree in political science. He went 
on to earn a law degree from McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Whitney worked as a building materials salesman for about 10 years after 
graduating from the University of Minnesota in 1956. After returning to school 
and earning a law degree in 1971 from San Fernando Valley College of Law in Los 
Angeles, he began a family law and general practice in Beverly Hills before 
moving to Newport Beach in 1978.

CHURCHES TARGET PENTECOST TO MOUNT ANTI-APARTHEID CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Religious News Service 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This Sunday, Pentecost Sunday, churches across the country will formally embark 
on a multi-phased ecumenical campaign to protest the South African government's 
apartheid system of racial segregation. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign's first phase begins with local Pentecost worship services and 
vigils focusing on South Africa and culminates June 17 with a rally at the 
Washington Monument. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign grew out of a meeting here in October of eminent U.S. church 
leaders -- calling themselves the "South Africa Crisis Coordinating Committee" 
-- who responded to calls for support from South African churches concerned 
about increasing incidents of violence against the churches. 
</P>
<P>
In August, the headquarters of the South African Council of Churches in 
Johannesburg, Khotso House, was bombed. And just 6 weeks later, an arson fire 
gutted two floors at Khanya House, the Pretoria offices of the Southern African 
Catholic Bishops' Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Diana Scott, who is coordinating activities for the United Church of Christ's 
Board for World Ministries here, said that a number of UCC events related to 
the campaign have already been held, including workshops on apartheid and the 
circulating of petitions. 
</P>
<P>
She reported that 7,000 information packets were mailed to UCC anti-apartheid 
activists across the country to bring the campaign to the grass-roots level. 
</P>
<P>
Backers of the U.S. campaign include the historic black churches and mainline 
Protestant denominations. The U.S. Catholic Conference and Evangelicals for 
Social Action are also involved, providing a broadened ecumenical base for the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
After the Pentecost Sunday observances, the committee is calling for a day of 
fasting and prayer May 26, a series of national speaking tours by North 
American and South African church leaders June 1 to 15 and a day of lobbying 
for sanctions in the states and on Capitol Hill June 16 before the Washington 
Monument rally the following day. 
</P>
<P>
The coordinating committee is also asking opponents of apartheid to sign a 
"covenant" statement that says: "The time has come for the faith, prayers and 
energy of the worldwide church of Jesus Christ to be clearly focused on 
bringing to an end the diabolical system known as apartheid. We hereby make a 
covenant with the church and people of South Africa -- until South Africa is 
free." 
</P>
<P>
Signers of the pledge card are being asked to assist in adopting campaigns in 
their communities to pressure the South African government to abandon 
apartheid, focusing on support for comprehensive economic sanctions and 
"people's sanctions" such as corporate campaigns and bank boycotts directed at 
institutions doing business with South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
High on the agenda of the coordinating committee are two pieces of legislation 
under consideration in Congress. The bills were introduced by Rep. Ronald V. 
Dellums (D-Berkeley) and Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.). 
</P>
<P>
According to the committee, the proposed legislation would "significantly 
expand" existing U.S. sanctions that now permit American businesses to continue 
basic operations in most industries.

FULLERTON LOSES FOUR-RUN LEAD, FALLS IN 11 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton opened a four-run lead after two innings Friday, but Fresno 
State rallied and finally came away with a 6-5 victory over the Titans in 11 
innings in a Big West Conference baseball game at Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans (30-25 overall and 10-9 in conference play) remain tied for third 
with Las Vegas, which lost to Cal State Long Beach Friday night. Third in the 
conference could carry a possible NCAA playoff berth with it. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State (39-17, 14-4) rallied for three runs in the fifth and one in both 
the sixth and seventh to tie it at 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno had the bases loaded and one out in the ninth when Steve Josey grounded 
back to reliever Chris Robinson. Robinson threw home to catcher Brent Mayne for 
one out, and Mayne threw on to first baseman Rex Peters to complete the 
inning-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
In the 11th, Tom Goodwin singled, stole second, and scored the winning run on a 
single by Steve Vondron. Robinson (6-5) took the loss. Bobby Jones (4-4) got 
the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton got two unearned runs in the first and scored two in the second on a 
two-run single by Dave Staton to take a 4-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Zosky hit a three-run home run off Fullerton starter Huck Flener in the 
fifth as Fresno cut the lead to 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
Mate Borgogno's RBI single gave Fullerton a 5-3 lead in the sixth. Fresno 
State's Chris Falco had an RBI single in the sixth, and Mike Burton had an RBI 
single to tie it in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton got a runner to second in the ninth with two outs but could not 
score. 
</P>
<P>
In another Big West Conference game: 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine 2, Pacific 1 -- Brian Young scored the game's winning run in the 
fourth, coming home on Chris Gallego's fielder's choice. UCI (4-15, 18-35-1), 
playing at Stockton, had taken a 1-0 lead in the first when Ed Luna, who had 
doubled, scored on Al Rodriguez's double. Pacific (4-14, 15-39) tied the score 
at 1-1 on Mark Trounter's RBI single in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
Winner Ken Whitworth (6-7) pitched a complete game, giving up 10 hits, walking 
five and striking out five. Pacific left 10 men on base.

DISTANCE DOUBLES HELP IRVINE MEN TO SECOND, WOMEN TO THIRD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBIE LUDOVISE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For many years, UC Irvine's track and field program has based its strength on 
its distance corps. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, at the Big West Conference championships, things were the same as 
both the Anteater men and women gained the majority of their points from 
distances 800 meters and up. 
</P>
<P>
Over the two-day meet, Irvine received double victories from four runners: Beth 
McGrann (women's 10,000 and 5,000); Brigid Stirling (women's 1,500 and 3,000), 
Pete Vicencio (men's 10,000 and 5,000) and Marc Goulet (men's 1,500 and 800). 
</P>
<P>
With those victories, Irvine managed to finish second in the men's competition 
with 122 points -- behind Fresno State, which won its seventh consecutive title 
207 -- and third among the women with 107.5, behind UNLV (178.5) and Fresno 
State (147). 
</P>
<P>
For the men's team, the difference between second and third might came down to 
an event that has been anything but an Anteater mainstay -- the 1,600-meter 
relay. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's Scott Click, Jeremy Ball, Brian Whitmore and Adam Shanks combined for 
fifth in the final event. While not spectacular in itself, it gave Irvine the 
two points it needed to edge third-place Long Beach, which had 120 points. 
</P>
<P>
"We came through, and in the mile relays of all things," Coach Vince O'Boyle 
said. "Those kids have a lot of heart. All we had to do is beat two teams (in 
the field of eight), and they gave everything and did it." 
</P>
<P>
But the basis of Irvine's success was its double winners. 
</P>
<P>
McGrann, who was named co-athlete of the women's meet along with UNLV's Carrie 
Franklin (who won three individual events and two relays) became the first 
woman in conference history to win four titles in the same event, the 5,000. 
McGrann, who had won her second consecutive Big West 10,000 title Thursday, 
took the lead from the start and cruised to victory in 16 minutes 38 seconds, 
tying her season best and breaking her own meet record of 16:59 set in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Vicencio, also coming off a victory Thursday night in the 10,000, had few 
challengers in winning the men's 5,000 in 14:31.34. 
</P>
<P>
Stirling, the Big West cross-country champion last fall, started the evening 
with a victory in the 1,500 in 4:25.24 and later won the 3,000 in 9:39.54. Mary 
Kenny of Cal State Fullerton was second in 9:55.56. 
</P>
<P>
While McGrann, Vicencio and Stirling all won by wide margins, Goulet used 
impressive tactics -- and late speed -- for his victories. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1,500, Goulet was in third on the last lap, but with 120 yards to go 
shot around the leaders and down the stretch to win in 3:47.40. Later in the 
800, Goulet was in fourth and boxed in with 100 meters to go but managed to 
sprint around three runners to win in 1:50.67. 
</P>
<P>
In the weight events, Irvine junior Mike Morales made up for a disappointing 
performance Thursday -- third in the hammer throw, fourth in the discus -- with 
a victory in the shotput. Morales, a former Garden Grove High School standout, 
put the shot 55-feet-10 1/4, a lifetime best by a foot and an inch. 
</P>
<P>
He is Irvine's first conference shotput champion. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really disappointed yesterday, bummed isn't the word," said Morales, who 
qualified for the NCAA championships earlier this season in the hammer. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came out today, it was hard not to think of yesterday, that maybe that 
same bad luck would carry over to today. But I competed well today. I'm glad 
because it'll give me some confidence going into the NCAA meet." 
</P>
<P>
Decathlete Jeff Williams gave Irvine its only other victory, winning the 
10-event, two-day competition with 7,236 points, a lifetime best by 35 points. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV's Franklin is the first person in Big West history to win five events in a 
single conference meet. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin, a senior, won the 100 meters in 11.76 seconds, the 100 hurdles in 
13.98 and the 200 in 23.86, and also ran the second leg on the winning 
400-meter relay team and leadoff on the winning 1,600-meter relay team. 
</P>
<P>
Utah State's Craig Carter, who won the discus and hammer and placed second in 
the shotput, was named the men's athlete of the meet.

SOUTH AFRICAN MUSIC HINTS AT GOSPEL, JAZZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA BRYSON, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEWARK, N.J. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rich, infectious singing style of Thokoza may have an exotic name -- 
ingom'esbusku -- but the South African harmonies are familiar to American music 
lovers. 
</P>
<P>
The four women who make up Thokoza (Zulu for happiness) are accompanied by 
traditional drums, and the band Bayeza (they are coming) which re-creates the 
bouncy, guitar-driven sound of South Africa's black townships. 
</P>
<P>
The result, punctuated by distinctly African ululations and the "click sounds" 
of the Zulu language, hints of the call-and-response style of American gospel, 
the emotion of blues and the energy of jazz improvisation. 
</P>
<P>
The group once shared the bill with a gospel quartet led by a staid 78-year-old 
minister who at first looked askance at Thokoza's brightly colored African 
costumes, recalled Thuli Dumakude, the group's lead singer. 
</P>
<P>
"After we sang, the reverend came and said, 'Wow! Was that gospel? I couldn't 
tell because of the language.' But he heard the spirit," she said. "The music 
broke the ice; we started relating to each other." 
</P>
<P>
Ingom'esbusku (night music) is gaining a new, international audience thanks in 
part to Grammy-winning Ladysmith Black Mambazo, the South African group that 
recorded the "Graceland" LP with Paul Simon. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent concert in Newark, the singers wore black dresses with splashes of 
brightly patterned cloth tied around their waists and hair, and white canvas 
shoes that flashed like semaphore as they moved in quick, high steps. 
</P>
<P>
"South African dancing is more like the sound of the drum," said Dumakude. "The 
footwork is just complementing the drums." 
</P>
<P>
Dumakude, whose quiet speaking voice contrasts with her soaring, emotional 
singing, is the only Thokoza member born in South Africa. Linda Carter is from 
Orange, N.J.; Amma Oloriwaa and Ghanneiyya Green were born in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"South Africans will come backstage to talk to the performers. They ask, 'Which 
part of home are you from?' And the people say, 'I'm from Brooklyn,' " said 
Welcome Msomi, Dumakude's husband and Thokoza's producer. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some of us who only came in 1979, and there are others who have been 
here for hundreds of years. But still, we are Africans," said Msomi, who 
occasionally adds a bass line to Thokoza and writes some of its songs. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though we can't trace our roots, maybe by singing we can hear where we 
came from," Oloriwaa said. "If you have a deep, guttural gospel sound, then 
maybe your people came from South Africa. If it's high, maybe it's West 
Africa." 
</P>
<P>
Thokoza's repertoire includes traditional African songs as well as original 
pieces that often call for social and political change in racially torn South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The group recently completed several concerts on the East Coast -- including 
performances at New York's Town Hall and Atlanta's Symphony Hall -- with a 
Gambian balladeer, a gospel choir and Puerto Rican plena and bomba band in a 
show called the African Heritage Tour. Thokoza also performed at 25 elementary 
and high schools in the New York area last year, and on college campuses in 
Missouri, Illinois and California. 
</P>
<P>
The group grew from the theater that Dumakude and Msomi founded in 1979 in the 
largely black Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. Msomi started the 
original IZulu Theater in 1965 in Durban, South Africa. In 1977, the Royal 
Shakespeare Company brought IZulu to London to stage "Umbatah," which Msomi 
describes as a Zulu version of Shakespeare's "Macbeth." 
</P>
<P>
"Umbatah" later played at the Spoleto Festival in Charleston, S.C., where it 
was seen by producers who offered to stage it in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"When the show closed (in New York), I made up my mind that I was going to 
start up a branch of the theater in the United States," Msomi said. "I love the 
challenge." 
</P>
<P>
Msmoi and Dumakude began with Zulu dance and language classes, nurturing an 
interest in African culture among U.S. blacks that allowed the South African 
couple to build a company. The plays they produced often included song and 
dance. 
</P>
<P>
"As we were growing, people began demanding to hear more of the music," Msomi 
said. "Then, when Paul Simon came out with 'Graceland,' people started to 
discover South African music. People started to demand South African music, 
then Thokoza started to develop." 
</P>
<P>
"Graceland" was named Album of the Year in 1986, and Ladysmith Black Mambazo 
went on to capture its own Grammy for best traditional folk album, "Shaka 
Zulu," a year later. 
</P>
<P>
Dumakude had at first planned to find other South Africans for Thokoza. In 
South Africa, she was taught that blacks in the United States were not African, 
and found that many black Americans were unaware of, or unwilling to 
acknowledge, their ties to her home.

KEITH CLARK'S NOT-SO-GRAND FINALE; 
</P>
<P>
DEPARTING MUSIC DIRECTOR DOES GET SOME APPLAUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Outgoing music director Keith Clark got some respect from the Pacific Symphony 
at his final classical concert Thursday at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
A day earlier, at a similar program, Clark had turned to applaud the orchestra 
he founded in 1979 after leading Mozart's "Ave, verum corpus" as an encore 
after Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
No one had applauded back. ("A lot of bad feelings had built up over the last 
year," said one musician, who requested anonymity. "I wondered if anyone would 
notice."). 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, however, the response was more generous, although not 
universal. Many of the cellists and string bass players, a smattering of 
violinists and some other instrumentalists tapped their bows or clapped their 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Chorale, whose music director, John Alexander, had also just been 
cheered on stage, joined in with spirited applause. 
</P>
<P>
The audience had been extraordinarily subdued during most of the concert but 
came alive at the conclusion of the Beethoven Ninth. Many people -- more than 
on Wednesday -- rose to their feet, and a few shouted "Bravo!" 
</P>
<P>
No one, however, handed up bouquets of roses or offered farewell speeches in 
tribute. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra's board of directors had planned to present a commemorative gift 
to Clark during Wednesday's concert, and had gone as far as setting up a 
microphone for some post-intermission speech-making. Clark, however, would not 
let the gesture take place, and the audience watched perplexed as a stagehand 
took away the microphone without explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"For musical reasons, Keith Clark did not wish to disturb the performance with 
a stage presentation," executive director Louis G. Spisto said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Clark again declined the offer when it was extended before the concert on 
Thursday, orchestra officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance figures for the two concerts also sent a curious message. Although 
2,691 tickets had been sold for Wednesday's concert, only 1,814 persons 
attended, according to orchestra figures. (An orchestra spokesman said he did 
not know whether the 33% no-show rate was unusual for Pacific Symphony concerts 
in general.) Likewise, a near-capacity 2,903 tickets were sold for Thursday's 
performance, yet only 1,947 showed up. 
</P>
<P>
Some music directors don't get any respect.

ELECTRONICS MUSEUM BOASTS RADAR, OTHER GEAR THAT HELPED WIN WARS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Robert L. Dwight, creator, curator and director of the Historical Electronics 
Museum Inc., walks amid an incredible collection of electronic equipment, 
predominantly radar, and says, "This is the least-known museum there is." 
</P>
<P>
If so, that should change. A visitor comes away from it wanting to tell the 
world to hurry up and visit this small spot where the history of radar and of 
other military and commercial electronic equipment is displayed with detailed 
and understandable information. 
</P>
<P>
The tour guides, particularly Dwight, are Westinghouse retirees who very likely 
designed or worked on the items displayed. 
</P>
<P>
The museum in the Baltimore suburb of Linthicum houses electronic equipment 
developed by Westinghouse, Boeing, RCA, Hughes, GE, Raytheon and Texas 
Instruments. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors can see the U.S. Army's long-range radar, the SCR-270 (Signal Corps 
Radar-270), built in the 1940s by Westinghouse-Baltimore. It tracked the 350 
Japanese airplanes headed for Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941. 
</P>
<P>
The 270 was in continuous action in World War II and it was also used in 
moon-bounce experiments. Parts of that radar and a workable model are on 
display at the museum. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a great desire to find an original one," Dwight said. 
</P>
<P>
A lunar TV camera like the one used to photograph man's first giant leap for 
mankind is displayed along with an award given to the Westinghouse development 
team by the National Academy of Arts and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, in front of the museum, is a large trailer-like truck with what 
appears to be a TV scanner on top. It is the SCR-584 radar, possibly the only 
one in existence. In World War II, the 584 played a major role against the V-1 
buzz-bomb assault on England. The 584 was capable of automatically tracking a 
target out to 40 miles and would feed its calculations to a mechanical 
anti-aircraft gun control. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the SCR-584 was sought by the public television program "Nova" for a 
segment on defense and radar during wartime, to be aired in November. "When 
asked if it worked, I told them it was in mint condition, but I wasn't telling 
them the truth," Dwight said. "Then they asked if we'd ship it to the MIT 
Radiation Laboratory in Boston where the unit was originally designed and where 
the film would be made. Well, our volunteers worked around the clock." 
</P>
<P>
The volunteers included Westinghouse retirees and museum volunteers Harold 
Watson, Heru Walmsley, Ernie Farkus and Warren Cooper, who headed the group 
responsible for returning the radar to working order. 
</P>
<P>
Then the 18,000-pound unit was loaded on a flatbed truck bound for Boston. The 
584 was designed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and 735 of them 
were built at the Westinghouse plant in Landsdowne, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Dwight's idea to begin the preservation of electronic equipment came to him 
suddenly in 1973 at a Westinghouse family day. 
</P>
<P>
Dwight was standing next to an old airborne radar unit, the AERO 13, when a man 
told his wife and two sons about his role in designing part of the radar 20 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"His excitement and pride in telling his family about it gave me a sudden 
knowledge that we should try to get back some of this electronic hardware we 
had built and to preserve it for history," Dwight recalled. 
</P>
<P>
From 1973 to 1980 when the museum was established -- it officially opened in 
1983 -- Bob Dwight and four co-workers, Cooper, Chester T. Kelley, Eugene P. 
Krach and Jack K. Sun, collected and stored and planned. 
</P>
<P>
"We reached a point where we had a warehouse full of equipment and no place to 
put it. Then Westinghouse gave us this space. 
</P>
<P>
"We also have another 5,000 square feet of storage space that houses exhibits, 
which we rotate. The Smithsonian displays only 5% of what they have," he 
pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
Dwight began working at Westinghouse in 1954 as a mechanical engineer in the 
airborne defense center, which he says has grown from 500 people to 17,000. He 
retired in 1984 and spends most of his days as a museum volunteer. He and his 
wife, Alice, live on Gibson Island. 
</P>
<P>
If the radar is out there, Dwight will find it. However, when he first began 
collecting, "we discovered that no matter how obsolete, the military equipment 
belongs to Uncle Sam first, then all of the states have a crack at it; then 
nonprofit organizations, fully qualified under the Internal Revenue Service, 
have third choice." 
</P>
<P>
"Now, as a museum, we have much success, particularly with the Navy, in getting 
calls asking if we want this or that. When we discover something is available 
someplace, we go after it. Private donations have come in, plus the 
interrelations between museums is marvelous. 
</P>
<P>
"We have loans from about five museums and we have loans out, such as the extra 
AWACS antenna we lent the Baltimore Museum of Industry," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Dwight says people can't believe that AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control 
System) is out of date, although some are being built. That radar provides an 
instant overview of more than a 300-mile radius and allows surveillance of all 
high- and low-flying aircraft. A maritime mode detects moving and stationary 
surface ships. 
</P>
<P>
The museum has 24 volunteers and a paid staff that consists of a half-time 
secretary, Affie Poulos. Its board has not sought volunteers or grants yet but 
is planning to, Dwight says. 
</P>
<P>
"Westinghouse funds us, modestly, but we have not established fund-raising 
programs, nor do we charge admission or have a museum store. This will come 
slowly, but we do welcome any funding or volunteer assistance," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The museum is in Airport Square III Building, at 920 Elkridge Landing Road in 
Linthicum near the Baltimore Washington International airport. It is is open to 
the public from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. weekdays except holidays. Extended hours for 
research in the library or for tour groups are available by appointment.

Looking for something for a college graduate who has just about everything 
except money and domestic skills? Take some tips from Susan Kleinman, author of 
"Real Life 101: (Almost) Surviving Your First Year Out of College." 
</P>
<P>
For the multitudes who will live on pasta and Chinese takeout: "A dozen boxes 
of assorted pasta, a large pot and a colander." 
</P>
<P>
For those who want to create their own fast food: a microwave oven. "For fun, 
throw in a few chocolate bars and wooden skewers for fondue." 
</P>
<P>
For those who have more trouble cleaning than cooking: A housekeeper whose 
cleaning frequency is limited only by your budget. It could be a one-shot deal 
or into perpetuity. 
</P>
<P>
For graduates moving to a new city: Tuition for a continuing-education course 
where he or she could meet people with common interests. Membership to a gym or 
health club for social as well as physical well-being. 
</P>
<P>
For the culture maven: A museum membership or subscription to a local ballet. 
</P>
<P>
For those entering the business world where campus clothes don't fit: Scarves, 
belts and costume jewelry for women; suspenders, belts, ties for men. 
Accessories help prevent them from looking like corporate clones. 
</P>
<P>
For the apartment: A gift certificate to a framing store for a favorite poster. 
A telephone-answering machine. Many of the graduates interviewed for "Real Life 
101" (April, MasterMedia Ltd., $9.95), said an answering machine was the one 
thing they couldn't live without, Kleinman said.

HERE'S THE PAYOFF: JUMPING THE GUN ON SALARY CAN KILL PROSPECT OF JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN L. JAMES, The Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a dilemma that makes even experienced job-seekers feel awkward. When in 
the interview process, should you bring up money? How should you respond to 
inquiries about your present pay? How hard should you bargain? The questions 
can be baffling. 
</P>
<P>
Salary negotiating is well worth worrying about, says Ronald M. Shapiro, a 
Baltimore attorney often involved in salary talks involving clients in sports 
and the media. A prospective employee who brings up salary issues too early or 
aggressively can kill his chances, because money issues are sensitive and can 
chill otherwise friendly negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't negotiate salary as the first item. You have to sell yourself first," 
cautions Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
The same advice is offered by employment specialist John Challenger. 
</P>
<P>
"Salary should never be brought up until an offer has been made, because if 
you're too high, they'll knock you out of the process, and if you're too low, 
they'll say, 'He or she is not at our value,' " says Challenger, vice president 
of Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas Inc., a Chicago-based placement firm with 
offices throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
Challenger worries that a job candidate who jumps the gun on salary questions 
could be unfairly slotted before he has enough information to negotiate over 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't pigeonhole yourself," he counsels. "Generally, what you want to do in 
the interviewing process is to put off the salary question as long as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
If you hold off the salary issue until the company is determined it wants you, 
you'll have more clout in pay negotiations, Challenger believes. "The 
difference is between you as a seller versus a buyer. You're a seller until you 
get an offer." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the employer could always jump the gun and raise the salary issue 
early in the interviewing process. In that case it's unwise to refuse a 
response to the inquiry ("This is not a game," Shapiro reminds). Still, it's 
smart to deftly finesse your responses. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, suppose the employer confronts you with a question about your 
present salary. You don't really want to answer, but can't afford to appear 
uncooperative. The next best approach is to present the information in the most 
favorable light. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro suggests that you respond by giving the value of your entire "salary 
package," a figure that includes all the benefits that go along with your base 
salary -- everything from medical care to pension and insurance coverage as 
well as any special benefits you normally receive. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell them your package is worth $80,000, if that's true," says Shapiro, who 
adds that it would be a serious mistake to misrepresent your compensation 
because "you can't afford to break your integrity." 
</P>
<P>
Early on, you're also likely to confront a question from the employer about 
your "salary requirements." In response to this sort of inquiry, Challenger -- 
whose company helps laid-off employees gain new positions -- suggests that you 
offer a general, rather than specific, answer. You might say, for example: "I'd 
be very open to whatever you think would be appropriate for a person with my 
kind of background, skill, knowledge and expertise. Tell me how you could use 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro advises that you respond to the "salary requirements" question with 
actual numbers, though presented as a range that's on the high side of what 
you're seeking, "to protect yourself." 
</P>
<P>
For example, if you're seeking to make $50,000, indicate you'd like to make 
$55,000 to $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
A key to the salary negotiation process is to amass as much information as 
possible before you get to the bargaining stage. 
</P>
<P>
"It's essential that you go into any negotiation -- salary or otherwise -- with 
advance research and knowledge," James E. Savitz, a Maryland attorney, says. 
</P>
<P>
One reason research is essential is that there can be wide variations in pay 
for people in essentially the same occupation, depending on where they work and 
for whom, Savitz observes. 
</P>
<P>
In law, for instance, the starting salary of a fresh-out-of-school attorney 
taking a job in New York City could be $70,000 to $80,000. However, the same 
lawyer taking a position in a mid-level suburban firm in Maryland could expect 
to start at $20,000 to $30,000, he estimates. 
</P>
<P>
There are plenty of sources of information on the average salaries of various 
occupations, says Susan W. Miller, a Los Angeles-based career counselor. Such 
data may be found through libraries, trade associations, trade journals or, if 
your field is unionized, union publications, she says. Another possibility is 
to contact a benefits consulting firm, many of which frequently survey local 
employers about their pay rates. 
</P>
<P>
Other clues to understanding the would-be employer and his approach to salary 
matters may become apparent to you in the interviewing process, says Shapiro, 
who contends that careful listening to what the employer is saying can be an 
astute way to gather information. 
</P>
<P>
"The rule of negotiating is to do as much listening and get as much information 
as possible," he says. 
</P>
<P>
If the interviewing process winds up with you receiving an offer, the deal is 
likely to contain a salary proposal. Assuming you're happy with the offer, 
Challenger thinks you should "take it right away -- so that you don't lose it. 
Sometimes people think they can sit around and wait and then they wind up 
losing the offer," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro, however, prefers to take some time -- as much as you can afford to 
take -- to think things over. It's often a mistake to react immediately to a 
job offer without thinking things through, he thinks. Ask for at least an hour, 
he says, before presenting your reply. Often you can ask to consider an offer 
overnight or, if you're in a favorable negotiating position, as long as a week, 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to get as much time to think as possible so that you don't let 
some instinct, rather than a rational determination, drive you to a decision 
you might some day regret," says Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, there's always the possibility you'll receive a salary proposal 
that doesn't please you. If that's the case, think about whether it's worth it 
to you to seek higher pay. 
</P>
<P>
"If you decide that you can take the risk of losing that offer, then you might 
go back and say, 'I'm very interested in the position that you've offered, but 
I feel I need to make $60,000. Where do we go from here?' " Challenger 
suggests. 
</P>
<P>
No matter what your objective, the most important rule of negotiation is to 
avoid an aggressive, adversarial style, say the experts. 
</P>
<P>
"There should be no ultimatums or burning of bridges," says Shapiro. "After 
all, when it comes right down to it, the art of negotiation is basically the 
art of good human relations."

IN HER FAMILY, A PUBLIC MEDIUM RELAYS MEMBERS' PRIVATE MESSAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Most days, mail call at our house is a ho-hum event. Only an occasional letter 
breaks the monotony of all those catalogues, credit-card applications, 
sweepstakes entries, and Cape Cod time-share lures that burden our mail carrier 
and quickly fill our wastebaskets. 
</P>
<P>
But several times a month an oversize envelope bearing a Florida postmark and 
the familiar handwriting of one of my parents appears in the mailbox. Instantly 
my spirits rise: another batch of clippings! 
</P>
<P>
For more years than I can remember, my parents and I have been trading 
clippings the way boys trade baseball cards. In the beginning, we simply 
enclosed an article or two in the same envelope with a letter. But gradually, 
as we spent more time talking on the telephone and less time writing letters, 
the clippings assumed a life of their own. Now bulky Manila envelopes regularly 
wing their way between our respective ZIP codes, carrying everything from 
editorials, political cartoons and interviews to columns, book reviews, and 
recipes. 
</P>
<P>
The best packets of clippings are, in fact, like a balanced meal, offering 
something nutritious -- a well-argued op-ed piece, perhaps -- topped off with 
something light and sweet such as a cartoon or comic strip. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with scissors and a ballpoint, veteran clippers approach each day's 
newspaper with enthusiasm. We read. We clip. We underline. We write relevant, 
and sometimes funny, comments in the margins. We also attach yellow Post-It 
notes explaining our choices or amplifying points. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Network Expands 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, my network of newsprint pen pals has expanded. In a typical 
week, I might save an article about a major auction for an aunt and uncle in 
Milwaukee who collect antiques. For my sister, a high school Spanish teacher in 
Minneapolis, I may clip a travel story about museums in Mexico City. A New 
Yorker cartoon about cats and a story on Madonna's controversial new video will 
be tucked into the next letter to our daughter at college. And the latest 
position paper on the Great Books controversy will find its way into an 
envelope for a self-improvement enthusiast in California. 
</P>
<P>
Even the most dedicated clipper knows better than to think that borrowed words 
on folded newsprint can ever take the place of a real letter containing 
personal news and private opinions. But for those of us whose busy schedules 
allow little time for proper correspondence -- and who have the phone bills to 
prove it -- these patchwork collections, custom-tailored to the recipient, can 
serve as love notes on the run. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone agrees, of course. There are those who disdain the smudgy 
practice, harrumphing all the way to the post office that only a handwritten 
letter in the 18th-Century manner constitutes a proper communication with 
friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
But as a veteran collector of mailable tidbits, I disagree. I like to think of 
a clipping as a compliment, a shorthand way of saying, "You're in my thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
Over time, a collection of clippings forms a mosaic, creating a portrait of the 
sender. In our choice of articles and jokes and photos, we give ourselves away, 
revealing our senses of humor, our politics, our serious and not-so-serious 
interests. Indirectly we are saying, "This is who I am." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coded Messages 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, as we choose subjects of interest to the recipient, we are 
saying, "This is who I think you are; send me a clipping if you think I'm 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
On sensitive subjects, clippings can serve as diplomatically coded messages. My 
mother, for instance, might send a page from a catalogue with the notation, "I 
think these curtains could look very nice in your family room." An article on 
overwork, passed along without comment, is her oblique way of expressing 
maternal concern. 
</P>
<P>
As a daughter, I love this particular form of conversation with my mother. So 
charmed am I by her mastery of the game that one Mother's Day I sent her a 
sterling silver paper clipper -- the perfect gift from one clipper to another.

PHOTOGRAPHY: HIS MODELS HAVE ENGINES, WHEELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LACHMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone who wants a high-quality photograph of a prized automobile quickly finds 
that geting it is not a simple task. It generally takes strobe lighting by the 
megawatts, a huge photo studio, a 4-by-5 camera -- or somewhere between $1,500 
and $2,000 to pay a professional to do it. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to spend a lot less -- and you're not a commercial enterprise -- 
Kelly Herrin will do the whole job for about $350. Herrin operates what he 
calls the largest one-man photography studio on the West Coast, an 
8,000-square-foot operation in Santa Ana that will accommodate any size 
automobile and is always set up to take a picture of one. 
</P>
<P>
His busiest times for personal auto shoots (which represent about 5% of his 
business) are Valentine's Day and Christmas, when women want to have their 
pictures taken with their husbands' or boyfriends' cars. In fact, almost 70% of 
his car portraits for individual customers are taken for these holidays, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It takes about 90 minutes for Herrin to photograph a car. Herrin's setup 
includes a Sinar 4-by-5 inch camera, a 4-foot-high custom-built light bank, 
eight strobe heads of 1,000-watt seconds each, and a black backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
First, the car is wiped down and its chrome is polished. The tires are placed 
on blocks and rotated to get the logos on the hubcaps right side up. Baby 
powder is then put on the windshield to catch the light. 
</P>
<P>
Herrin then shoots a Polaroid to make sure everything is in its proper place. 
He takes the final shots -- an average of 10 -- with the 4-by-5 camera. 
</P>
<P>
Herrin, who is now 28, opened the studio in 1984. He has a varied background 
that includes modeling, sales and training as a race-car driver and mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
And he is quick to credit his success to his knowledge of sales principles. "A 
lot of guys who come from a fine arts school background are lacking in the 
skills to sell their commercial and advertising photographs," he said. "That's 
where I'm fortunate. Commercial photography is about 60% sales, 20% business 
and 20% photography. A lot of the guys who go to Brooks (Photographic Center in 
Santa Barbara) or Art Center (College of Design in Pasadena) are excellent 
photographers technically, but not much into sales. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to realize that you are self-employed. That's what separates the 
successful photographers from the unsuccessful photographers. You are selling 
an intangible. It's not like going door to door with a vacuum cleaner; you're 
selling them an idea that you're going to create an image that's going to help 
sell their product." 
</P>
<P>
For those who want to improve their own photographs of cars, Herrin offers a 
couple of tips: 
</P>
<P>
Choose as simple background. It should have one or two elements at the most. A 
brick wall and a gravel street, for example, are enough. Although you might 
want to shoot at a park (many people do), that background will create unwanted 
clutter in your picture. 
</P>
<P>
Shoot on overcast days or just before sunrise or after sunset so as to avoid 
getting a reflection of the sun on the car. Under these lighting conditions, 
you will need to use filters to correct for the bluish cast.

FAMILY LIFE: HAMMOCK MADE A STATEMENT; CHILDREN'S GIFTS MADE HER DAY

<P>
Tomorrow, they tell me, is my day off -- that once-a-year respite during which 
we moms don't have to perform our usual duties. 
</P>
<P>
I'd better hurry, then, and get the laundry finished up tonight. 
</P>
<P>
As any mom could tell you -- if she dared -- that "day off" business is a hoax. 
We spend just as much time and energy being moms on Mother's Day as we do the 
rest of the year. We just do it differently, that's all. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of preparing a big Sunday dinner for four, for example, we prepare four 
for dinner, scrubbing faces instead of vegetables, making sure everyone is 
washed and brushed and wearing matching socks for our trip to the fancy 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
For a few hours, our families try to be responsible for themselves. Nobody asks 
us to help find lost shoes or books or keys. But by then, we've spent several 
days answering such questions as, "Where's the tape?" and "Mom, can you show me 
where we keep the shiny wrapping paper?" 
</P>
<P>
What's often inside those wrappings says as much about the Mother's Day hoax as 
anything. If you believe the ads that abound this time of year, the perfect 
Mother's Day gift is a vacuum cleaner or computerized recipe retriever or some 
other handy household appliance that will make it so much easier for Mom to do 
what she usually does for everybody else. Contrast that with the Father's Day 
ads that will arrive next month, touting specials on the ideal gifts for Dad: 
hammocks and reclining chairs, of course. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, I decided it was time to rebel. After the traditional breakfast in 
bed -- as usual, delivered hours before my eyes were ready to open -- I got up, 
got dressed and announced that we were going shopping. I marched purposefully 
into the store, pulled out my credit card, and marched back out with a 
brand-new hammock under my arm. 
</P>
<P>
"Wow! Who's that for?" the kids asked.

"It's for me," I told them sternly. "This is my gift to me for Mother's Day." I 
explained, using a manner and vocabulary appropriate to their ages (then 10 and 
12) about Mother's Day vs. Father's Day and the dichotomy and sociopolitical 
implications thereof. The hammock, I told them, was far more than a fun place 
to lounge around. It was a statement, a manifesto, not just for me but for moms 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"I get to sit in it first!" they shouted simultaneously, launching an argument 
that lasted until we pulled into the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
I rephrased my statement. "It's mine. I'm going to sit in it. All day." 
</P>
<P>
They were stunned. 
</P>
<P>
"It's Mother's Day. Remember?" I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yeah." 
</P>
<P>
But first, we had to hang it. They helped, fetching tools from the garage and 
crawling around in search of dropped drill bits. By the time I was finished, 
they had bought into the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, Mom," my daughter said, handing me her whistle. "Whenever you need 
anything today, just blow and we'll be here to wait on you." 
</P>
<P>
I climbed in. Then I looked at their faces and climbed back out. "Get in," I 
said. "But one at a time." Wisely, they didn't bicker over who went first. 
</P>
<P>
After they had both given the hammock a thorough test swing, they turned it 
back over to me. Then they ran back and forth into the house to haul out 
newspapers, iced tea, cookies, a sweater, a pillow -- whatever they thought I 
might want. 
</P>
<P>
I blew the whistle as soon as they disappeared inside, and they both hurried 
back over to me. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, Mom?" 
</P>
<P>
"What can we do for you?" 
</P>
<P>
"Close the door behind you," I told them, as if to prove that I was still 
actively a mother. 
</P>
<P>
I spent a delicious afternoon there in my Mother's Day hammock, dozing, 
reading, and dozing some more. I even swung it just a little, and felt as if I 
had achieved some sort of justice at last. 
</P>
<P>
But I have to confess, even though I picked it out myself, that hammock was 
hardly my all-time favorite Mother's Day gift. To be honest, it's not even in 
the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
How could it compare with the handmade construction paper daisy I got one year, 
with each of its petals a coupon good for a free hug or bedtime story or other 
special favor? It's still intact -- I could never bring myself to cash in any 
of the petals. 
</P>
<P>
Or the stationery my daughter made, decorated with her own handprints? Or the 
card my son gave me when he was in third grade, with a pair of paper lips that 
sprang toward me when I opened it to deliver a Mother's Day kiss? 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the Mother of the Year award they gave me, even though I hardly 
deserved it. And the ceramic plate my daughter made, decorated with a smiling 
elephant and equally smiling sun. I still have the poems they wrote me, and the 
bouquet of flowers made of tissue paper and pipe cleaners. Over the years, let 
me tell you, I've made quite a haul. 
</P>
<P>
Every mother has similar treasures, whether she keeps them on display or 
stashed away in a box somewhere. They're the reason we maintain our conspiracy 
not to expose the Mother's Day hoax. 
</P>
<P>
So tomorrow, like all the other moms, I'll go along with the myth that I'm 
taking the day off. After all, someday I'll have more time off than I want. I 
just hope the hammock holds out until then.
