RECALLING OTHER MEMORABLE PLAYOFFS

<P>
Some of the best of the 1,658 other NBA playoff games played before this year, 
according to TV Times' informal survey. 
</P>
<P>
Game 7, 1970 NBA finals, New York 113, Lakers 99 -- In a series that included 
Jerry West's 63-foot shot (in a game the Lakers ultimately lost in overtime), 
the Lakers were denied their first championship in Los Angeles, while the 
Knicks captured the first in that team's 24-year history. This game will be 
remembered for Willis Reed's inspirational return from a painful hip injury 
that had kept him out of the previous game. 
</P>
<P>
"I was watching Willis practice two hours before the game and get the OK from 
the doctors to play," recalled Chick Hearn, who has announced Lakers games 
since their first Los Angeles season, 1960-61. "I thought there was no way he 
could play. Just before the tip off, he came hobbling onto the court, 
literally, dragging a leg behind him. 
</P>
<P>
"The Knicks got the tip, controlled the ball and got the ball down to him down 
the middle. He took off and made a basket around the free throw line. The 
(Madison Square) Garden exploded. It was like lighting a cannon, because the 
Lakers were never able to get into the game after that." 
</P>
<P>
Game 6, 1980 NBA finals, Lakers 123, Philadelphia 107 -- The first championship 
of the 1980s. With Kareem Abdul-Jabbar sidelined because of a sprained left 
ankle, then 20-year old rookie Magic Johnson started at center, scored 42 
points, grabbed 15 rebounds and handed off seven assists. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a team meeting that night," Johnson recalled, "and we said let's go out 
and win this, because nobody thinks we can. Let's go out and go for it. We did 
that. We started the game up-tempo because they were so much bigger than we 
were. I played guard, forward and center, and it worked out for us." 
</P>
<P>
Hearn's call at the conclusion of the game: "There can never be a more 
incredible championship game for the Lakers than this one." 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps that was the cement foundation that the Lakers built to becoming the 
team of the decade," Hearn said. "After that, success just seemed to roll on. 
I've never thought of it before, but that just might have been the stepping 
stone that started all of it." 
</P>
<P>
Game 5, 1976 NBA finals, Boston 128, Phoenix 126 (triple overtime) -- The 
Celtics blew a 22-point second quarter lead, trailed by a point with five 
seconds left, but regained a one point lead with one second left. 
</P>
<P>
Even though he had no time outs left, Phoenix Coach John MacLeod called time 
out, so his team could in-bound the ball at midcourt, instead of under the 
Boston basket. After Jo Jo White hit the technical foul free throw, Garfield 
Heard, with Don Nelson's hand in his face, hit a high-arching jump shot from 
beyond the top of the key as the buzzer sounded. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics held leads in the first two overtimes, but Phoenix mounted 
comebacks on both occasions. In the third overtime, Boston went on a 12-4 
spurt, and was able to overcome two late baskets by Paul Westphal. 
</P>
<P>
Postscript: Among the players on Phoenix's roster that evening was Pat Riley, 
now the Lakers coach. He did not play. STEVEN HERBERT

COVER STORY: THE GREATEST NBA PLAYOFF GAME EVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steven Herbert 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the National Basketball Assn. in the midst of its annual two-month long 
tournament to crown a champion, TV Times commenced an informal survey of NBA 
announcers to determine the greatest game ever played during an NBA playoff 
series. The verdict: Game 6 of the 1985 NBA Finals between the Lakers and 
Boston Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
First a bit of history. 
</P>
<P>
Before 1985, the Lakers and the Boston Celtics had met eight times for the NBA 
title. The Celtics won each of those championships. 
</P>
<P>
Included in that stretch: a seventh game loss in 1962 (when Frank Selvy missed 
a 10-foot shot at the buzzer before Boston won by three in overtime); two point 
seventh game losses in 1966 and 1969, and another seventh game loss in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the following year, when the Lakers and Celtics met again for the 
NBA title, that left thousands of Southern Californians delighted and made for 
what many consider the most memorable playoff game ever in the National 
Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics began the series with a 148-114 win in a game dubbed "The Memorial 
Day Massacre." But the Lakers responded to win games two, three and five. 
</P>
<P>
That set the stage for the memorable Game Six. 
</P>
<P>
"To me that carried the most drama of any game," said CBS' NBA play-by-play 
announcer Dick Stockton, who will again call this year's finals with analyst 
Hubie Brown. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to myself, 'If this gets any better, there ought to be an 
investigation,"' said Pat O'Brien, who hosts "At the Half" and "The Basketball 
Show" for CBS. "I couldn't believe the intensity. I was sitting courtside and 
there were goose bumps on my arms because it was so thrilling." 
</P>
<P>
It was a Sunday, June 9. It was hot in Boston -- the Lakers were so concerned 
about the heat at the Boston Garden that they took oxygen into their locker 
room. 
</P>
<P>
More foreboding than the conditions was the knowledge that the Celtics had 
never lost a deciding game in the championship series on their home court. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' chief nemesis turned out to be Celtics forward Kevin McHale, who 
finished with 32 points before fouling out with 5:21 left. 
</P>
<P>
"McHale was great, and we never found an answer to him, but he didn't beat us," 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar said after the game. 
</P>
<P>
McHale had 13 points in the first quarter, but the Lakers led 28-26. At 
halftime, the game was tied, 55-55, and McHale's total had grown to 21. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers began the second half making their first five shots, four by the 
38-year-old Abdul-Jabbar, and took the lead, 65-61. After Larry Bird sank a 
jumper to bring the Celtics to 65-63, the Lakers quickly moved to a 73-63 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar (the series' most valuable player who had a team-high 29 points 
that afternoon) scored on a drive; James Worthy dunked off an assist by Magic 
Johnson. Then Byron Scott, a non-factor for the first five games, made his 
presence felt. 
</P>
<P>
Scott dropped a jump shot from the baseline, then stole the ball from McHale, a 
play that led to Kurt Rambis tipping in a missed shot, giving the Lakers their 
10-point margin. 
</P>
<P>
"From that point on, it was ours," coach Pat Riley said after the game. 
</P>
<P>
Boston did have one spurt left, coming as close as 86-82 with 8:56 left. But 
two free throws each by Abdul-Jabbar and Worthy and a Rambis lay-up rebuilt the 
lead to 92-82. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what broke their backs," Rambis said, as the closest the Celtics would 
come for the rest of the game was five points. 
</P>
<P>
As Michael Cooper dribbled out the clock for the final seconds of the 111-100 
win, listeners to the Lakers radio broadcast heard Chick Hearn proclaim, "At 
last, the suffering is over!" 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien had the difficult assignment of going into the Celtics' locker room. 
</P>
<P>
"They were not too pleased," O'Brien recalled. "There was a hush over Boston 
Garden. The ghosts of the Garden were scared off by that one." 
</P>
<P>
Following the broadcast, O'Brien went into the Lakers locker room. 
</P>
<P>
"Magic was sitting by himself in the trainer's room saying, 'I did it, I did 
it,' " O'Brien said. "They were so happy to get it done." 
</P>
<P>
A season later, the Lakers were upset by the Houston Rockets in the Western 
Conference finals, and the Celtics won another title. But in 1987, the Lakers 
again beat Boston in the finals at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the Lakers became the first team since the 1968-69 Celtics to win 
consecutive titles, and with their five titles of the decade, earned the 
billing as the team of the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
But to at least two who were there, that Sunday afternoon in Boston was 
special. 
</P>
<P>
"That game really started them on their way," Stockton said. "Who knows what 
would have happened if Lakers hadn't won that one?" 
</P>
<P>
"That's always the best," Johnson said recently. "A tremendous feeling that 
you'll never forget."

CHINA'S LOST GENERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nine months after the Tian An Men Square massacre, while some people have 
almost forgotten what happened there last June, we Chinese students in the 
States are still struggling with the painful reminiscences of the blood bath 
and with the dilemma of longing to contribute to our motherland but at the same 
time facing possible political persecution if we go back. We are so grateful to 
you for letting our experience be known to the public. 
</P>
<P>
After reading "China's Lost Generation" (March 25), many of our American 
friends told us that they were moved by our stories vividly portrayed by Jim 
Mann. Many of them asked whether they could do anything for us. 
</P>
<P>
At the turning point of this century, democracy is triumphing in almost every 
corner of this planet. Why should China be left out of this worldwide 
megatrend? We believe a democratic and economically strong China is of great 
importance to a peaceful world, especially to a peaceful Asia. We also believe 
that the seeds of the democratic ideal have already been brought to China. A 
noble course needs to be urgently pursued to spread these seeds on the vast 
land of China and to let them sturdily grow there. It is for these beliefs that 
we Chinese students in the United States are still forcefully fighting.

THE MAN WHO SENT SIGNALS TO SATAN; 
</P>
<P>
THE RUSHDIE AFFAIR THE NOVEL, THE AYATOLLAH AND THE WEST BY DANIEL PIPES (BIRCH 
LANE PRESS: $18.95; 224 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Amir Taheri, Taheri is the author of The Spirit of Allah: Khomeini and the 
Islamic Revolution (Adler &amp; Adler) and Nest of Spies: America's Journey to 
Disaster in Iran (Pantheon Books). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For more than a year now a tragedy has been writing itself with the whole world 
as its stage. At the center of the plot is a man whose death has been ordered 
by a religious patriarch. Scores of people have taken a ritual oath to kill the 
man, when and if he emerges from hiding. The man's sin: writing a novel that 
challenges the basic tenets of one of the world's major religions. 
</P>
<P>
The hunted man is, of course, Salman Rushdie, the British author of 
Indian-Muslim origin, whose novel, "The Satanic Verses," is, arguably, the most 
controversial book since the appearance of the Holy Koran 14 centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
Accused of insulting the Prophet Muhammad and doubting the divine origin of the 
Koran, Rushdie was formally sentenced to death on Feb. 14, 1989, in a fatwa 
(edict) issued by Iran's "Supreme Guide," Ayatollah Khomeini. 
</P>
<P>
"The Satanic Verses" has been banned and burned in nearly 100 nations while it 
has topped the best-seller lists in a handful of Western countries. 
</P>
<P>
The cataclysmic events set in motion by the publication of Rushdie's rather 
complex novel provide the theme of Daniel Pipes' fascinating new essay, "The 
Rushdie Affair: The Novel, the Ayatollah and the West." 
</P>
<P>
Pipes, author of five books on the Middle East, begins his study by drawing the 
outer contours of the drama: So far more than 20 people have been killed in 
anti-Rushdie riots. Hundreds more have been injured. Relations between several 
states have been affected, and billions of dollars worth of trade has been 
lost. The process of freeing hostages and prisons in the Middle East has been 
delayed. The threat of censorship and self-censorship has hit at the heart of 
Western belief in freedom of expression. Finally, a clash of civilizations, 
East versus West and Muslim versus Judeo-Christian, has assumed an intensity 
virtually unknown since medieval times. 
</P>
<P>
Pipes might have added to his inventory another important consequence of the 
controversy: the civil war of ideas that has been unleashed within Islam 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
Pipes' book is one of nearly a dozen published by Western and Muslim scholars 
on the subject in recent months. It merits special attention for at least two 
reasons. First, this is a highly enjoyable book to read, a work of impeccable 
scholarship that can be read like a thriller. Second, Pipes does not seek 
refuge in spineless excuses of scholarly objectivity in order to hide his own 
views. We know right from the start that he is an opponent of Islamic 
fundamentalism and a supporter of Western-style human rights. He also makes it 
clear that he does not like Rushdie's politics or, rather, what might have been 
Rushdie's politics when he wrote "The Satanic Verses." 
</P>
<P>
No serious study of civilization's confrontations over basic values can be 
written from a totally neutral point of view. Even choosing a camera angle 
becomes a statement of principle. 
</P>
<P>
Pipes does not try to understand "the other side" in a condescending way with 
the aim of justifying every excess, every enormity, in the name of real or 
imagined grievances of Islam against Western colonialism and imperialism. That 
Britain once interfered in Persian politics, for example, is no justification 
for exporting terrorism to Britain today. 
</P>
<P>
Having made his own position clear, Pipes uses every ounce of information 
available on the subject to offer a complete picture of a complex and 
passionate debate about the basic values of existence. So careful is he to give 
everyone, especially his designated betes noires, a fair hearing that he offers 
the most painstakingly detailed account of Khomeini's stance that this reviewer 
has seen even in the official literature from Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
Pipes' essay is divided into two parts. The first part studies two texts: the 
Rushdie novel and the Khomeini fatwa. In the section on "The Satanic Verses," 
Pipes dispels many of the misconceptions that had crept into the media's 
account of the novel. He also draws attention to the little-known fact that 
Rushdie's novel includes a savage satire on Khomeini himself. 
</P>
<P>
Part II is devoted to the responses provoked by the clash of the two texts. It 
is here that the international aspects of the "affair" and the crucial issue of 
freedom of expression as a global right are analyzed against a background of 
dramatic events. 
</P>
<P>
Khomeini and Rushdie, as Pipes shows, began as potential political allies, 
united by their intense hatred of the West and, most specifically, the United 
States. Khomeini has described the West as "hell on earth" and given the United 
States the sobriquet of "The Great Satan." Rushdie, an early supporter of 
Khomeini's revolution, was something of a hero in the ayatollah's republic 
until "The Satanic Verses" came out. 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie's first three novels were translated into Persian and published by the 
Ministry of Islamic Guidance in Tehran. His novel, "Shame," even won the 
Ayatollah Beheshti Literary Prize in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie, however, proved to be too much of a free thinker for the ayatollah's 
taste. The ideal vision of fundamentalist Islam is a world in which zikr, the 
mere repetition of traditional incantations, has totally replaced fikr, 
critical thinking. "A man who thinks sends signals to Satan," says one 
much-quoted fundamentalist dictum. Virtually all writers and poets, Muslims 
included, have at one time or another been accused of "sending signals to 
Satan" by trying to see a different image of things from the one reflected by 
Islamic fundamentalism, the Islam of fear. 
</P>
<P>
Even Ayatollah Khomeini himself was for a time, in the 1940s, suspected of 
apostasy by those more zealous than himself simply because he had introduced a 
philosophy course in the holy city of Qom. 
</P>
<P>
The tragic irony of Rushdie's situation is that he knows that only the West can 
offer him a measure of safety and security against scores of zealots who dream 
of murdering him. Pipes has a bit of fun on this score -- the only time his 
excellent book falls to the level of a polemical pamphlet. 
</P>
<P>
Pipes describes Rushdie as an "immature and spoiled intellectual" who 
"criticizes and makes fun of nearly everything. One book attacks the Gandhis 
and modern India, another reviles the leadership in Pakistan, a third takes on 
American foreign policy, the fourth one blasts fundamentalist Islam and 
Britain." 
</P>
<P>
Pipes then goes on to offer an exhaustive list of Rushdie's sorties of hate 
against the West. But those who read "The Satanic Verses" as a work of 
literature know that Rushdie's politics amount to no more than irritating 
chaff. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, a year of living with the danger of death has modified Rushdie's 
excessive political views. But his latest pronouncements simply came too late 
to be included in Pipes' book. Rushdie has expressed gratitude to the 
government of "Maggie-the-Bitch" Thatcher for having saved his life. The recent 
collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe and the defeat of the Sandinistas in 
Nicaragua also have tempered his naive, leftist illusions. 
</P>
<P>
Was Khomeini's decision to issue the fatwa based on political calculation or 
the result of purely religious reflection? Pipes raises the subject and studies 
the many different views expressed on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that for Khomeini there was no distinction between the sacred and 
the profane. He used religion in the service of political aims and, as Pipes 
brilliantly shows, set the interests of his own government above the basic 
principles of Islam itself. 
</P>
<P>
Pipes offers a number of important conclusions that merit attention at all 
levels. He writes: "The 'Satanic Verses' controversy confirmed once again that 
appeasement does not pay, especially when dealing with a militant, dogmatic 
state such as Iran." 
</P>
<P>
More important, Pipes shows that Khomeini was, in the end, isolated even within 
Islam, although the vast majority of Muslims found "The Satanic Verses" 
offensive. Khomeini was part of Islam but was not all of Islam. 
</P>
<P>
Pipes ends on a note of hope: "For all the battering they have taken, liberal 
ideas remain alive in the Muslim world; not all is submerged under the darkness 
of fundamentalism."

"China's Lost Generation" is another lesson for us in what our freedoms mean to

"Tyranny Begins at Home" (by Harry Shearer), is a well-worded warning that we

Thanks for both, and let me say the magazine has become a must-read for me; it

Oliver Stone's 1986 film brought the Vietnam War home at last with a fiery 
implacability impossible to ignore or forget. Charlie Sheen stars as Viet vet 
Stone's young alter ego, caught between two rival sergeants, the brutal Tom 
Berenger and the humane Willem Dafoe. There's one key disappointment: the 
presence and contributions of blacks are slighted, even though Forest Whitaker 
is in the cast.

Another major Stone film, in which an ambitious young stockbroker (Charlie 
Sheen) latches onto high roller Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas, so deservedly an 
Oscar winner) of no discernible principles whatsover -- but no pretensions 
either. This vastly absorbing and exciting 1987 film remains a morality play 
for our time.

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: BACHELOR GIRLS BY WENDY WASSERSTEIN (ALFRED A. KNOPF:

Playwright Wendy Wasserstein (author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning "The Heidi 
Chronicles," among other plays) practices a mordant style of humorous feminist 
essay which broadens the category familiar from columnists like Cynthia Heimel 
and Alice Kahn. Wasserstein's "Bachelor Girls" are not just women caught 
between post-puberty and middle-aged Angst; they are sisters doing battle with 
the woman's lot in life from from Day 1 to death. 
</P>
<P>
Not that Wasserstein ignores the complexities of the twenty-somethings to 
forty-somethings. Her piece on "The World's Worst Boyfriends" acknowledges the 
woes of women whose fate it is to live in a time when People magazine can run 
an article on "the three available, sensitive, attractive men." But the 
anxieties of weight she lampoons in "To Live and Diet" begin early and last 
into old age. Even as a slender 8-year-old, she recalls, she and her friends 
were aspiring to the three "perfect diamonds" as the legs were pressed 
straight: between ankles, knees and upper thighs. "As I ramble through life, 
whatever be my goal," she observes, "I will unfortunately always keep my eye 
upon the doughnut and not upon the whole." Sonja Bolle

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: HUSBAND IS THE PAST TENSE OF DADDY AND OTHER DISPATCHES

The title of Teryl Zarnow's collection, published in time for Mother's Day, 
speaks for itself. 
</P>
<P>
These pieces from her syndicated Knight-Ridder column, "Color Me Mommy," 
maintain a humorous character while serving up the undercurrent of 
self-conscious "what have I done?" lament popular in the new genre of parenting 
literature. When Zarnow writes, "Rules have civilized us; they have created 
order out of chaos. I am Ayatollah the Mommy; my rulings come swift and 
merciless," the reader can be sure there are some laughs in this collection 
that will be appreciated only by those whose normal sleeping patterns have been 
irretrievably disturbed by night feedings. Sonja Bolle

LURID CONFESSIONS

<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KOWIT, From Stand Up Poetry: The Poetry of Los Angeles and Beyond (Red 
Wind Books, c/o Ron Koertge, English Department, Pasadena City College, 1570 E. 
Colorado, Pasadena, 91106: $7.95; 84 pp.; 0-9622847-2-6), edited by Charles 
Harper Webb and Suzanne Lummis. Steve Kowit is the author of several books of 
poetry and the winner of a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship. The 
phrase stand-up poet, a back-formation from stand-up comic, was coined by 
Gerald Locklin and Charles Stetler for a kind of poetry that, though not 
confined to Southern California, seems to flourish here. Webb notes that the 
stand-up poets are by no means unpublished poets and have won their share of 
the usual prizes. Their distinctive movement, he says in the forenote to Lurid 
Confessions, is not away from print to performance but away from the dour and 
ponderous, toward creativity, spontaneity, and childlike (not childish) joy.

BLOODY SUNDAY

<TEXT>
<P>
When is a mystery not exactly a mystery? The question arises with K. C. 
Constantine's fine, slim new novel, Sunshine Enemies (Mysterious Press: $18.95; 
167 pp.). 
</P>
<P>
There is a crime, certainly. A man has been found stabbed to death outside the 
porn shop at the edge of town, the same shop the new Lutheran minister has been 
bugging Police Chief Mario Balzic to shut down. But the murder, and the 
perspiring minister, are only the backdrop to Balzic's struggle with his grief 
over the death (from old age and a failing heart) of his mother. 
</P>
<P>
This is the ninth of the Balzic stories by the pseudonymous Constantine, whose 
real identity remains a well-guarded secret. He has been described as a 
newspaper writer in a small Pennsylvania city much like the one he describes as 
Rocksburg. 
</P>
<P>
The pleasure of the series is that Constantine knows his turf and its people as 
well as Tony Hillerman knows the Navajo-Hopi Southwest or Raymond Chandler knew 
Southern California. Balzic, half-Italian, half-Slavic, blue collar turning 
white, always has felt like a very autobiographical character: direct, profane, 
street smart, hard-drinking, emotional, and never more so than when he falls 
apart after his mother dies. It's hard not to believe that Constantine is 
remembering battles with a grief of his own. 
</P>
<P>
Balzic drinks himself silly, is rude to the kindly mourners, his wife and 
daughters among them. He is the perfect portrait of a man suddenly confronting 
his own mortality and assessing his own achievements, which considered under 
the guise of eternity he finds inadequate. Having outfoxed a pompous new mayor 
and most of the State Police muckymucks in previous novels, Balzic discovers 
the one situation his street smarts can't handle. He is funny, sad and quite 
believable. 
</P>
<P>
Almost as afterthoughts, he uncovers the real story on the protesting minister 
and deals sympathetically with the distraught mother who guesses her uptight 
son may have done the stabbing. 
</P>
<P>
Constantine's publisher, Otto Penzler, remarked recently that the writer may be 
on the verge of winding up the Balzic series and coming out from beneath the 
pseudonym. It would be too bad to lose the chief, but nice to acknowledge the 
real man who has created him so vividly. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara's Sue Grafton continues to work her imaginative way through the 
alphabet. Her private eye, Kinsey Milhone, has now achieved G Is for Gumshoe 
(Henry Holt: $16.95; 261 pp.). She is 33, 5-feet-6, 118 pounds, and her 
apartment, gutted by a bomb blast during a previous caper, has been 
redecorated. 
</P>
<P>
Yet all is not wonderful, naturally. She's the subject of a contract written by 
a thug she helped send to prison, and the hit guy or guys come nastily close. 
Her new case is to find and return an eccentric old woman living in a no-rent 
compound deep in the desert. The trail, as usual, leads not only from the 
desert back to Santa Teresa (as Grafton calls Santa Barbara, to protect the 
innocent) but into a family past and the madness born of greed. 
</P>
<P>
Milhone, tough and resourceful but less abrasive than Sara Paretsky's V. I. 
Warshawski, is a sympathetic figure whose character grows richer and rounder 
with each outing -- and with 19 letters left to go. 
</P>
<P>
A widening and deepening regionalism is one of the characteristics of present 
American crime fiction, and hardly a locale from Vermont to Puget Sound has not 
been found fraught with murder and other deadly sins. 
</P>
<P>
Frederick D. Huebner is a Seattle lawyer who writes about a Seattle lawyer 
named Matt Riordan. Picture Postcard (Fawcett/Columbine: $16.95; 281 pp.) is 
the fourth Riordan caper, this one involving the newly valuable work of an 
artist who presumably died in a suicidal car crash into deep waters nearly a 
half-century before. 
</P>
<P>
The artist's granddaughter, launching an art gallery featuring some of his 
work, receives a freshly painted post card that is an uncannily good forgery 
(if it is a forgery) of his style. She suspects some paintings in a rival show 
of her grandfather's work may be fakes, and she is unpleasantly warned to shut 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Riordan's investigations on her behalf lead back to a art-colony houseboat 
party at which a young model was murdered 50 years ago, not long before the 
suicide. There are survivors, among them the artist who did time for the 
killing and the lawyer who tried to defend him. 
</P>
<P>
The plot is solid if unspectacular, but Huebner's comfortable familiarity with 
the Northwest and its art scene give the book its fresh, brisk charm. 
</P>
<P>
One of the newest of the print detectives to find his way onto television is 
Colin Dexter's Inspector Morse, who first appeared in "Last Bus to Woodstock." 
He is British, resident in Oxford (Dexter is a Cambridge man) and is irascible 
where P. D. James' Dalgleish is dour. 
</P>
<P>
The ingenious The Wench Is Dead (St. Martin's: $15.95, 200 pp.) is clearly a 
homage to Josephine Tey's "The Daughter of Time." Tey's man, marooned in a 
hospital bed, rethought the character of Richard III and found him innocent. 
Dexter's Morse, hospitalized for an ulcer brought on by a mixture of 
irascibility and strong drink, and maddened with inactivity, finds a book in 
the hospital library about a murder case more than a century old. 
</P>
<P>
A girl was found murdered, her body floating in a canal near Oxford. Two men 
were hanged, but Morse is persuaded they were innocent. Time would have taken 
care of the guilty as well and it is as cold a trail as they ever get. But 
Morse, using his bed as command post, gets a young librarian and his long- 
suffering sergeant to do his researches for him. 
</P>
<P>
In the end he does leave his bed, finding by flashlight some ancient markings 
beneath layers of peeling wallpaper that make everything clear. Puzzle 
mysteries are really not much done these days, but this is one -- an author 
challenging himself to do something fiendishly clever, and succeeding. 
</P>
<P>
Keating's The Bedside Companion to Crime (Mysterious Press: $19.95; 191 pp.) is 
just that, a delightful compendium of essays and oddments about crime fiction. 
There are brief, biographical tributes to Agatha Christie, Margery Allingham, 
Ellery Queen, Emma Lathen and several others; a long and thoughtful 
appreciation of P.D. James' "A Taste for Death"; an essay on the great villains 
of crime fiction; notes on pseudonyms and on the baffling title changes when 
British tales hit the American market; a summary of all the send-ups of 
Sherlock Holmes, and so on into the night. 
</P>
<P>
The Writer's Complete Crime Reference Book by Martin Roth (Writer's Digest 
Books: $19.95; 308 pp.) is not exactly engrossing bedtime reading, but for the 
novice eager to try writing crime fiction, what better place to find several 
pages worth of lethal instruments, smuggling techniques, criminal slang, police 
codes and other police procedures, chapters on criminal law and court 
procedures, the forensic lab, organized crime and secrets of surveillance. All 
you need is the odd motive or two and you're in business. Sue Grafton

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: SPRING SNOW RUNAWAY HORSES THE TEMPLE OF DAWN THE DECAY OF 
THE ANGEL BY YUKIO MISHIMA (VINTAGE: $10.95 EACH) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the morning of Nov. 25, 1970, the day of his flamboyant suicide, Yukio 
Mishima wrote the last lines of the "Sea of Fertility" tetralogy and sent it to 
his publisher, believing he had completed his masterpiece. Twenty years later, 
the four novels remain one of the outstanding works of 20th-Century literature 
and a summary of the author's life and work. 
</P>
<P>
The series begins in 1912, with the ill-fated passion of Kioyaki, the son of a 
wealthy parvenu, for Satoko, the daughter of a waning noble clan. Honda, 
Kioyaki's blandly passive friend, witnesses the inevitably tragic conclusion of 
their romance: Satoko enters a convent; Kioyaki dies, promising his confidant 
that they will meet again "beneath the falls." The purposeless Honda dedicates 
his life to pursuing his friend's restless spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years later, Honda finds Kioyaki reincarnated as the kendo champion 
Isao. Handsome, athletic and fanatically dedicated to samurai ideals, Isao is 
Mishima's idealized vision of a hero. His ritual suicide after a failed attempt 
to restore the absolute power of the emperor recalls Mishima's own death. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Temple of Dawn," Honda rediscovers Kioyaki, this time in the person of 
Ying Chan, a lovely Thai princess. Honda's carnal desires and longing for 
enlightenment are mirrored in his visit to the squalid yet holy city of 
Benares. Mishima's epic climaxes in the "The Decay of the Angel," when Kioyaki 
reappears as the thuggish Toru. Like the angel in the Noh play, "The Robe of 
Feathers," the spirit's divine nature is devolving into a baser form: a 
powerful metaphor for the corruption of traditional Japanese culture. 
</P>
<P>
In a final, desperate attempt to comprehend the unhappy mysteries he has 
witnessed, Honda visits Satoko, now a holy abbess, only to have the reality of 
Kioyaki's incarnations -- and his own existence -- called into question: There 
is no comfort to be had in a debased world. The series ends with a chilling 
vision that evokes the real Sea of Fertility, a barren area of the moon. 
</P>
<P>
Like "The Divine Comedy" and "Remembrance of Things Past," "The Sea of 
Fertility" gives the reader the sensation of being carried to a great height. 
But Dante and Proust conclude with the reassurance that anyone can scale the 
summit, through divine love or the redeeming power of art. Mishima abandons the 
reader at the edge of the precipice, revealing the abyss beneath the degraded 
life of the post-war world. 
</P>
<P>
When Honda confronts the uncertainty of his own existence ("perhaps there has 
been no I"), Buddhist theology merges with existential philosophy, and a tiny 
sunlit garden expands into an all-encompassing void.

CLASSICS ON CASSETTE: 'GREAT EXPECTATIONS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEITH LOVE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Charles Dickens' weekly magazine, All the Year Round, was going through a 
circulation slump in 1860, his friend Wilkie Collins had an idea: Write a 
mystery. 
</P>
<P>
It came naturally because Collins already was thinking through the idea and 
plot that would result in his 1868 book, "The Moonstone," the first detective 
novel in English fiction. As he had in previous books, Dickens decided to pour 
much of his painful childhood experience into his new book, and, taking 
Collins' suggestion, he added the mystery that makes "Great Expectations" so 
compelling: Who was Pip's benefactor? 
</P>
<P>
Dickens published "Great Expectations" week by week in his magazine over 
1860-1861, and it was such a sensational success that it revived the 
publication. It was later a best seller in book form. 
</P>
<P>
By listening to "Great Expectations" on audio cassettes, you have something in 
common with those very first readers of the work -- the magazine subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
Those readers had to wait for the next week's issue to find out the latest 
twist in this marvelous plot. They could not flip ahead in the book, as some 
readers of mysteries are tempted to do. 
</P>
<P>
And as you listen to the mystery unfold on tape, you're a captive, too. 
</P>
<P>
Good luck on fast-forwarding to just the right spot to satisfy your curiosity 
about certain elements of the plot. You're just going to have to put yourself 
in Dickens' hands and enjoy every minute of the nearly 20 hours of this 
unabridged reading. 
</P>
<P>
Does 20 hours sound like a lot of listening? Here's a tip: You'll find yourself 
wishing it would never end. 
</P>
<P>
"Great Expectations," in my opinion, is Dickens' most disciplined work, and the 
credit again goes to Collins, who kept Dickens from going off on some of the 
delightful -- but distracting -- tangents that distinguish some of Dickens' 
other works. And surely the characters in "Great Expectations" are the greatest 
collection in all of English fiction. On audio cassette, they are brought to 
life magnificently by British actor Martin Jarvis for Cover to Cover Cassettes 
Inc. of Wiltshire, England. 
</P>
<P>
He'll hook you early on, in Chapter 8, when Pip meets Miss Havisham in the 
eerie house where the clocks were stopped at the exact minute that Miss 
Havisham was jilted many years before. 
</P>
<P>
From the book: 
</P>
<P>
"Look at me," said Miss Havisham. "You are not afraid of a woman who has never 
seen the sun since you were born?"

(Pip tells the reader:) I regret to state that I was not afraid of telling the 
enormous lie comprehended in the answer, "No." 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know what I touch here?" she said, laying her hands one upon the other, 
on her left side. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, mam." 
</P>
<P>
"What do I touch?" 
</P>
<P>
"Your heart." 
</P>
<P>
"Broken!" (shrieks Miss Havisham). 
</P>
<P>
Jarvis will put an arrow through your own heart as he emits that shriek in the 
voice he has adopted for Miss Havisham. 
</P>
<P>
His voices for the other characters, from the convict Magwitch to gentle Joe 
the blacksmith, are also magnificent. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, his "Great Expectations" is the most brilliant reading of an English 
classic that I ever hope to hear.

If you want to rent, there are good readings from Books on Tape (800-626-3333) 
and Recorded Books (800-638-1304), but the version I most strongly recommend is 
that done by Gene Engene for Books in Motion of Spokane, Wash.

<P>
If you don't believe an American can read a British classic to your 
satisfaction, Engene will convince you otherwise. Also, if you prefer a little 
slower reading, his is the one. It rents for $15 a month; you can buy it for 
$48.95.

Dickens loved reading his own work to audiences, according to Norman and Jean 
MacKenzie's "Dickens: A Life" (Oxford University Press, 1979). They write that 
the author's lecture tour in America over the winter of 1867-68 earned him more 
than $200,000, an enormous sum for the day. 
</P>
<P>
It also taxed his health. E. M. Forster said he noticed a loss of Dickens' 
"natural force" when the author returned to England. His health steadily 
declined, and he died in 1870 at age 58.

THE AUTUMN OF A DICTATOR; 
</P>
<P>
A CHILEAN DIARY BY ARIEL DORFMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Ariel Dorfman, Ariel Dorfman teaches literature at Duke University each 
spring. His latest book is My House is on Fire (Viking).

<TEXT>
<P>
ARIEL DORFMAN, ONE OF Latin America's best-known writers, was exiled from his 
native Chile in December of 1973, a few months after a military coup ended 
democracy there. After he had wandered with his family from Paris to Amsterdam 
and then to Washington, D.C., the dictatorship allowed him to return in 1983. 
During the ensuing years, whenever he visited his country, he invariably 
approached the airport with a dread that turned out to be prophetic. Arriving 
one day in 1987, he was arrested and deported with his young son, a punishment 
for his human-rights campaign against the government. Although the deportation 
order was rescinded some weeks later, Dorfman could never be sure thereafter 
what fate might await him each time he went back. On March 10 of this year, he 
again returned to the airport from which he had been exiled. But this time, he 
was offered champagne, and his customs and immigration procedures were waived: 
He was coming home as a guest of Chile's democratic president-elect, Patricio 
Aylwin. This is the story of the days that followed, the story of a country 
that, after years of repression, surprisingly returned to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, March 11, 1990 
</P>
<P>
GEN. AUGUSTO PINOCHET has just made the last mistake of his long dictatorship. 
On his way to hand the presidency of Chile over to opposition leader Patricio 
Aylwin, the general has, incredibly, decided to ride in an open car, in full 
uniform, for everyone to see, through the streets of his native Valparaiso. 
Perhaps he thought that the people of his country would cheer him for this 
peaceful transfer of power -- not a habitual gesture, after all, in tyrants. 
But the thousands of Chileans who have filled the streets to celebrate the 
return to democracy are not in a magnanimous mood. "Asesino! Asesino!" they 
chant, "Murderer! Murderer!" -- a thunderous shout that the TV technicians 
transmitting the ceremonies cannot filter out, which not even the military band 
that begins to play the national anthem ahead of schedule manages to stifle. 
Nor would the censoring of sound do any good. Because now Pinochet's bodyguards 
are forced to hurriedly raise black umbrellas to stave off a downpour of 
tomatoes, eggs and sticks thrown by the irate crowd. 
</P>
<P>
It is not only this trip, the general's last ride as dictator of the country he 
has ruled with an iron hand for 16 1/2 years, that is turning out differently 
from the way he had expected. In his worst nightmares, he could never have 
imagined that he would take this ride at all, that he would someday be forced 
to give up power. 
</P>
<P>
When, exactly 10 years ago, on March 11, 1980, he rammed his constitution down 
the throats of a terrorized populace in a referendum that international 
organizations and the Roman Catholic Church called clearly fraudulent, he 
believed that he had created the mechanisms that would allow him to govern the 
nation for the rest of his life. A plebiscite, scheduled for faraway 1988, in 
which the people of Chile would be asked to say yes or no to his perpetuation 
as president, seemed a mere formality. He was sure that the citizens were too 
scared, the opposition parties too dispersed and fractious, his support in the 
armed forces and middle class too massive for a victory to be seriously denied 
to him. He was wrong. The people found courage, and in the intervening eight 
years, an economic crisis shattered his middle-class support, the opposition 
hammered out a difficult unity and important sectors of his own military told 
him that they intended to respect the outcome of the popular vote. On Oct. 5, 
1988, almost 55% of the voters rejected his claim to remain as president, and 
on Dec. 14 of 1989, a larger majority elected Aylwin, a Christian Democrat, to 
be Chile's first constitutional president since Socialist Salvador Allende died 
in the bloody 1973 military coup. 
</P>
<P>
So sure had the general been of his power that he had ordered an enormous hall 
built for his inauguration, the new Congress of the Republic whose steps he is 
now mounting in defeat. That building, which combines the pomp and grandiosity 
of a Cecil B. De Mille Roman set with the bad taste of a Mussolini 
architectural extravaganza, perversely expresses both the general's dreams of 
eternal power and, now that those dreams have proven false, his capacity to 
leave permanent scars on the face of this country. Worse than this monstrous 
edifice is the deeper damage to the people of our land: the millions ravaged by 
persecution, unemployment, detention, incessant fear; the thousands killed, 
tortured, exiled. All too many of us bear the psychological wounds that terror 
inflicts on both victim and abuser, the implacable consequences of years of 
authoritarianism and humiliations to the moral fiber of a nation. 
</P>
<P>
Aylwin inherits from Pinochet a deeply fractured country, split between the 
very rich and the extremely poor, between the privileged military and the 
outcast civilians, between those who want to forget the "unpleasantness and 
excesses" (as they call them) of this period and those who feel that all the 
atrocities must be remembered so they will never again be repeated. 
</P>
<P>
But the very violence of the confrontation of the past 16 1/2 years has, 
paradoxically, created in the whole of Chile, among haves and have-nots alike, 
a nearly unanimous desire for unity and fraternization. "National 
reconciliation" is the phrase on everybody's lips. I had only been in the 
country since yesterday, but I could already sense that this is no passing 
rhetorical fad. 
</P>
<P>
THE NEW NATIONAL obsession of Chile is the abrazo. 
</P>
<P>
Chileans have always loved to greet each other with a warm bear hug, but I have 
never before known such a mania for hugging and being hugged as that which 
welcomed me in the past 24 hours. It is not merely that everybody you encounter 
-- whatever the class, whatever the political persuasion -- squeezes you 
tightly and pummels your back with an unfamiliar intensity, but that the 
language itself overflows with proclamations of the need for Chileans to reach 
across barriers that separate them. Such a widespread and exaggerated panegyric 
and practice of the embrace reveals, I believe, just how weary of war my 
compatriots are and to what lengths they will go, after so many years of 
confrontation, to heal the wounds of the past. 
</P>
<P>
There are limits, however, to this conviviality. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Pinochet will get no abrazo today -- or ever, I suspect -- from his 
adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
From a colossal screening room in Santiago, I watch, along with many other 
guests and a number of Chilean artists, as the general enters Parliament and is 
greeted by dozens of new congressmen who show him photos of the "disappeared." 
A friend of mine tells me later that the photographers themselves muttered 
insults in his face as they snapped his picture. 
</P>
<P>
At the podium, Pinochet is confronted by the irrefutable evidence of his 
failure to modify forever, as was his intention, the soul of Chile. During 150 
years of a history that had its share of massacres and disparities of wealth 
and power, my country managed nevertheless to construct a strong and stable 
democratic tradition in which differences were settled through negotiations and 
by consensus. So much so that, with Allende in 1970, we became the first 
country in the world to attempt the experiment known as the peaceful road to 
socialism, trying to radically alter the country's chronically unfair social 
and economic structure through democratic, electoral means. 
</P>
<P>
This adherence to pluralism was so ingrained that when the military, backed by 
the United States, rose against Allende, accusing him of putting the fatherland 
in danger by fomenting confrontation instead of harmony, it did so precisely in 
the name of democracy, even though Pinochet soon decided that it was the chaos 
and disorder of democracy itself that was to blame for Allende's revolution 
and, therefore, in dire need of total restructuring. Pinochet swore, shortly 
after the coup, to "extirpate (politicians) like weeds," calling them rats, 
traitors, thieves -- vowing that they would never return. But there on the 
podium in front of him are Gabriel Valdes, a man he jailed, now president of 
the Senate, and Jose Antonio Viera Gallo, a man he exiled for 10 years, head of 
the House of Representatives. Worse still, they represent the two major 
political parties, the Christian Democrats (Valdes was the foreign affairs 
minister of the late Eduardo Frei, who governed from 1964 to 1970) and the 
Socialists (Viera Gallo was Allende's undersecretary for justice), whose 
feuding and bitter antagonism during the past 30 years opened the way, 
according to many analysts, to a military intervention. The general had gambled 
that they would never be able to overcome the antagonisms of the past. After 
all, many Christian Democrats, including Aylwin himself, welcomed the coup 
against Allende, and many of Aylwin's current left-wing ministers detested 
Eduardo Frei's policies, proclaiming that they would deny him even salt and 
water. That these rival parties, along with several smaller ones on the left 
and the right, are now allies in a governing coalition is a stunning historical 
achievement and may be proof that the Chilean elite has learned, in the hard 
struggle to regain its freedom, something that everyday people always knew: 
that what separates us is not as important as what joins us. They have 
embraced, in fact -- but for Pinochet, now there is only a cold, distant 
handshake. 
</P>
<P>
Though it remains to be seen how this new experiment will turn out -- if 
yesterday's enemies can be tomorrow's friends -- so far it has been successful: 
If there had been no unity, there would be no President-elect Aylwin advancing 
toward the podium. 
</P>
<P>
The general must now take off his presidential sash, the symbol of his 
authority. But it has become entangled and refuses to unbuckle. For three 
eternal seconds, all Chile holds its breath. It is as if power were clinging to 
Pinochet like a magnet. But now it's done, it's over, the sash is off and 
pandemonium breaks loose. Pinochet watches morosely as Valdes solemnly swears 
in Aylwin, and now, yes, it is true, the moment we have been awaiting for 6,026 
days has finally arrived. Our country has returned to democratic rule. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, Pinochet still hovers around. Then he turns stiffly and leaves -- 
still with no abrazo. The only presence that remains, like a curse, is the 
heavy empty armchair that he occupied a few minutes earlier. As nobody comes to 
cart it away, Viera Gallo boldly stands up and, amid widespread laughter, sits 
down in the place of the man who banished him, supposedly forever. 
</P>
<P>
It is as if a ghost had been chased away. 
</P>
<P>
AND YET, OUR relief may be premature. 
</P>
<P>
Pinochet has stepped out of the presidency and automatically into the post of 
commander in chief of the army for another eight years. He will have at his 
disposal an enormous contingent of troops paid for by a bloated, unmovable 
budget and dozens of houses and mansions hastily transferred to the army during 
the past few months, along with hundreds of cars and tons of furniture, tens of 
thousands of security agents and their weapons, documents and property -- and 
even his wife's multiple charity organizations, fully financed. 
</P>
<P>
The road the Chilean people have taken from dictatorship to democracy has had 
the advantage of being basically nonviolent; but it also has given the general 
time to prepare, particularly in the year and a half since his loss in the 
plebiscite, a parallel base of power, inside and outside the state, from which 
to threaten our renascent, fragile democracy. 
</P>
<P>
He has carefully infiltrated each institution with his cronies, who cannot by 
law be dismissed: Not only are the army and the National Security Council at 
his command but also the Supreme Court, part of the Senate (enough to stop 
major constitutional revisions), most of the townships, as well as universities 
and thousands of administrative posts -- even the chauffeurs of the new 
ministers are rumored to be Pinochet agents. 
</P>
<P>
During the years of Pinochet's rule, the opposition created islands of 
resistance. It took over the surface of the country space by space; it defied 
him and paid the terrible cost for that defiance, but it was that collective, 
never-ending struggle of a whole community that finally weakened and cornered 
the military regime. Now Pinochet intends to reverse the situation with his own 
islands of obstructive power, tying Aylwin's hands so that he cannot solve the 
country's problems, many of them exacerbated by Pinochet himself. And if this 
leads to disorders, Pinochet has promised that he is ready, like the Roman 
general Cincinnatus, to come out of retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Just yesterday, when actress Maria Elena Duvauchelle had driven me from the 
airport to the center of Santiago, we felt suddenly liberated by the 
realization that this was real, that soon we would cease to be strangers in our 
own land, that we would begin to have rights, that we were -- amazing that one 
should even have to write the word -- persons. For Maria Elena, specifically, 
it meant that she would never again receive death threats, as she had several 
times since 1987, and that she would not be "protected" by a police major who 
turned out to be a member of a death squad. For me, it meant that my exile was 
really over. For every Chilean, democracy was not something abstract but the 
opportunity to be treated with dignity, to be given back some control over our 
bodies and our future. 
</P>
<P>
Then three camouflaged army trucks spilling over with mattresses, furniture, 
and lamps crossed our paths and shocked us back into reality. Here in front of 
our eyes, Pinochet was stealing part of the country that our taxes had paid 
for. Pinochet's booty, taken from government houses that tomorrow he would no 
longer command, mocked us with the idea that the general may, after all, be no 
more than loaning us a constrained country, already mounting in his imagination 
those steps he built for himself when he thought he would reign among us 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
NOT EVERYBODY IN Chile, I find out, wants an abrazo. 
</P>
<P>
With my eldest son, Rodrigo, a 23-year-old actor who returned to Chile just a 
few months ago to spend some time here, I mingle with the enormous crowd that 
awaits Aylwin's arrival from Valparaiso. The problem is that when the new 
president finally appears, he passes in such a rush and with such a heavily 
armed escort that it is as if we had not seen him at all. The crowd is in a 
good mood, but I can sense its frustration: It is sad to wait this long, in 
this 92-degree heat, and capture no more than the blur of an image shielded by 
the same guards who only a few hours ago were defending the tyrant. 
</P>
<P>
Half an hour later, incidents flare up. An enormous multitude has filled the 
Alameda, and not far from where Rodrigo and I wait, fighting breaks out between 
bands of adolescents and carabineros, the militarized national police. We can 
see stones and sticks flying through the air, over the heads of the spectators, 
and as we try to press away, an armored vehicle charges into the crowd, spewing 
tear gas indiscriminately. Gagging, crying, our eyes and throats and skin 
burning, we escape -- and end up several blocks away from where the incidents 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the disorders were provoked by extreme-left guerrilla activists, as the 
police suggest, or right-wing provocateurs linked to Pinochet's secret police, 
as other sources indicate, is for the moment irrelevant. What does matter is 
that roving bands of adolescents, drunk or drugged, their faces covered with 
bandannas, have joined in with gusto. To dismiss these actions as the work of 
marginals is to forget that more than half of Chile's youth feel absolutely 
left out, unemployed and disaffected. We sit and talk to some of them and find 
them dazed, isolated, rebellious. Their hatred of the police is unlimited; they 
had all -- every one of them -- been beaten and been in jail, and not one had a 
job. These are the children of the dictatorship, its continuing legacy. Yes, 
Aylwin is their president, but they are not so sure that democracy will mean a 
difference, suspecting that they will be as excluded tomorrow as they have been 
yesterday. That night, I mention these youths to a friend who is working with 
the new minister of education and wonder whether cultural programs can be 
developed in the shantytowns where they live. 
</P>
<P>
My friend smiles. "We'll try," he says. "Except for one problem." He pauses. 
"Pinochet left us 10,000 pesos ($35) in the budget item to spend on those 
projects for the rest of 1990." 
</P>
<P>
Monday, March 12 
</P>
<P>
DURING THE 1973 COUP, Chile's new military leaders, finding themselves with an 
excess of political prisoners on their hands, hit upon what they must have 
considered an ingenious idea: Turn the National Stadium, our largest sports 
arena, into a gigantic concentration camp. Then, a few months later, after 
thousands of dissidents had been arrested and tortured, after hundreds had been 
interrogated and executed, the authorities scrubbed the floors and painted the 
benches, and reopened the coliseum to the public. The referees again blew their 
whistles, the ball once again thudded across the field . . . and gradually 
soccer fans began coming back. 
</P>
<P>
I have always refused to do so. Before I could go back to the place where I had 
watched so many sports events in democratic times, I desperately needed to 
witness some sort of act that would transform it, that would reject its 
purported normality as obscene and confront the terrible pain still echoing 
there. 
</P>
<P>
What I was waiting for, I now realize, was an act of exorcism. Because today, 
under the majestic Andes mountains, the people of Chile performed that act. 
Aylwin, by accepting this place as the site of his first official encounter 
with Chile, by referring in his speech to the horrors that had happened here 
and pledging that "nunca mas," never again, would they occur, helped us rid the 
stadium of its demons. Far more significant than his words, however, was the 
communal act of mourning that preceded them. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy thousand people suddenly hushed as they heard a solitary pianist 
playing, down on the green field, variations on a song by Victor Jara, the 
celebrated protest singer murdered by the military a few days after the coup. 
As the melody died, a group of women in black skirts and white blouses emerged, 
carrying placards with photos of men whose kidnapings by the secret police have 
never been acknowledged by Pinochet's government. These are the relatives of 
the "desaparecidos," left in a particular form of hell, not knowing if their 
loved ones are alive and being tortured, or dead and namelessly buried 
somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
That very morning, I had been to see these women, to find out their plans now 
that there is a democratic government. After all, many people -- even among 
Aylwin's allies -- feel that to normalize the country, it might be necessary to 
start forgiving the crimes of the past and start living for the future. The 
answer was calm and stubborn: Before the relatives forgive anybody, they first 
have to know the truth about what happened to their men, and once that is 
established, the criminals must be put on trial. When I press them, they admit 
that this might be difficult to attain, given that the Aylwin coalition does 
not have the votes in parliament to modify the amnesty that Pinochet offered to 
his own agents. But as we talked, I sensed the deepest of their desires: that 
the pain that the military regime had mocked should be publicly assumed and 
acknowledged by the community. 
</P>
<P>
Now on the field, one of the women -- a wife, a daughter, a mother -- begins to 
dance a cueca, expressing all her immense solitude because she is dancing, 
alone, a dance meant for a couple. There is a moment of shocked silence -- then 
people start, slowly, clapping along with the music, a savage, tender beating 
of palms that indicates that we are sharing this sorrow, that we are also 
dancing with all our missing loves of history, all our dead, and that we have 
brought them back somehow from the invisibility to which Pinochet has banished 
them. And as if answering us from beyond time, the Symphonic Orchestra of Chile 
bursts out with the chorale from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and the song of the 
Chilean resistance, Schiller's ode to joy, his prophecy of a day "when all men 
will once again be brothers." 
</P>
<P>
I have never seen -- and never want to see again -- 70,000 people crying 
together as they lay their dead to rest. 
</P>
<P>
In the years to come, we will have to repeatedly liberate all the zones, one 
after the other, that Pinochet invaded. That very night I visit La Moneda, the 
presidential palace bombed by Pinochet, where Allende died -- a place I had not 
visited since the day before the coup. And later I put on the television, where 
I have not seen a friendly face for ages, and all of a sudden there appears a 
journalist, banned for all these years, who can now gain entry to every home in 
Chile. And the feeling of victory grows giddy: If we can reconquer so much of 
the forbidden country, it is because we have resisted. The dictatorship tried 
to isolate people from one another, to isolate the present from the past and 
the future. It only wanted people to produce and consume and dream of nothing 
else. Somehow we managed to reconnect Chile. That is why we won. Because we 
kept the future alive, anticipating these moments when we would be able to 
really cleanse Pinochet's shadow from the land that he never managed to totally 
contaminate. We won because our love was fiercer than his hatred. 
</P>
<P>
But if we never want to lose our country again, then celebratory acts of magic 
are not enough. The poorest 20% of the population has decreased from consuming 
7.6% of the national total in 1969 to 4.4% in 1989, whereas the consumption of 
the richest 20% has increased from 44.5% to 54.6% in the same years. Pinochet 
has increased a disparity that he did not, however, invent. How will the new 
government deal with Chile's persistent poverty? 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, March 13 
</P>
<P>
ALTHOUGH PINOCHET supporters feel uncomfortable when asked to address 
human-rights issues, they tend to grow extremely vocal on the subject of 
Chile's economic indicators. "The rest of Latin America is a disaster," a high 
school chum who is now an impresario tells me. "Look at us: 10% growth last 
year, a modernized export sector, gradual payment of the external debt, a 
streamlined state, telephone and fax machines, a moderate inflation rate. As 
long as the new government doesn't come along and screw it up . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Aylwin's ministers have no intention of screwing it up, I discover as I hop 
around Santiago today gathering opinions. Even the Socialists -- not a 
surprise, given the worldwide trend -- do not feel they should tamper with a 
market economy that is making Chile the envy of its chaotic neighbors. But they 
dispute that it is anywhere near the "miracle" that the former government's 
experts claim: Statistics show that Chile grew less (2.6%) between 1974 and 
1989 than the rest of Latin America (2.8%). 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Ominami is an old buddy from the days of my Parisian exile. He also 
happens to be the new economy minister. "All commentators," he tells me, "focus 
on the macroeconomic factors, but there's a second story: the devastating 
social debt that has been incurred." He ticks off a series of anecdotes: Women 
giving birth on the dirty floors of hospitals because all the beds are taken. 
Slum dwellers waiting four or five hours in line for an aspirin. Dilapidated 
schools. Overexploited workers with no social benefits or health coverage. 
Rising suicide rates because of unemployment. "Aylwin's government is assigning 
priority to the 48.6% of Chileans living below the poverty level, those who go 
hungry every day. And we have to do so precisely when the economy is 
dangerously overheated; when inflation has started to rise alarmingly. And we 
have to do it with a budget that postpones social issues, with a state 
apparatus that has been mutilated by Pinochet, and without the personnel 
because the former government left thousands of its own technicians in key 
posts. And we can't upset the entrepreneurs." 
</P>
<P>
It sounds like a task that, if not impossible, is fraught with conflicts: to 
satisfy the all-powerful social class that was the main beneficiary of 
Pinochet's economic model, and at the same time attend to those who were its 
victims and who are the primary source of the government's electoral support. 
</P>
<P>
How is it to be done? Where is the money to come from? 
</P>
<P>
Ominami's budget officer insists that the new government will not pay for the 
social programs by printing money and with deficit spending. A law is being 
prepared that would raise the taxes of wealthier Chileans -- presently at a low 
15% to 20%rate. It is a solution the entrepreneurs will resist, according to 
Roberto Fantuzzi, a major industrialist. A maverick himself, Fantuzzi believes 
that it is time that some of the pain of the country should be felt by his 
colleagues, but he doubts that they, "holding all the winning cards," will 
cheerfully accept a lowering of profits. 
</P>
<P>
So what happens if the entrepreneurs don't want to cooperate, if they are not 
ready to reduce their consumption levels? What if there is no abrazo between 
workers and owners? 
</P>
<P>
I speak to several ministers in the next few hours and they all agree that 
Aylwin's style is not confrontational. "Things could get rough," Alejandro 
Foxley, minister of finance, admits, "but for now we've got them sitting down 
at the same table -- and that hadn't happened in all these years." And if the 
talks fail? Can the government simply impose the new legislation, including a 
law that makes it easier for workers to organize and strike? 
</P>
<P>
"Not really," says Rene Cortazar, the labor minister. The government may have a 
large popular majority in the House, but in the Senate the balance of power is 
held by nine senators designated by Pinochet. Each piece of legislation will 
have to be negotiated, and although there are positive signs that right-wing 
parties are willing to collaborate with Aylwin's administration -- Valdes, 
after all, was elected president of the Senate with votes from several Pinochet 
followers -- it means that some changes will simply have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
The one change that cannot wait, everybody agrees, is the democratization of 
the townships. Pinochet, in a much-needed reform, has decentralized power, 
giving local communities responsibility for education, health and housing 
projects -- but he has designated 310 of the 325 mayors for the next four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few mayors that Aylwin could name is Antonieta Saa in Conchali, a 
sprawling impoverished suburb of half a million people on the northern 
outskirts of Santiago. I am glad to see Antonieta, who happens to be my wife's 
cousin, in such an important post. A feminist, she was one of the few women 
given a job by Aylwin -- a situation that irks the many female activists who 
were protagonists of the resistance against the dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
"They've unloaded all the problems at the local level, but not any money or 
participatory channels to deal with the solutions," she says with a grin. 
"Decentralization doesn't work," she adds, "if it is authoritarian. The former 
mayor never once, in 10 years, met with the teachers or the hospital workers." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Antonieta is not waiting for the new legislation that will allow 
the citizens of Conchali to elect their own authorities. She is bubbling with 
projects. "We're going to use all the alternative non-governmental 
organizations that dissidents created all these years in order to survive, that 
made us self-reliant and independent from the state. If families discovered how 
to cook together in soup kitchens, why can't they build together, organize ways 
of buying materials, help each other now?" 
</P>
<P>
And if the 20,000 families of Conchali sharing the crowded, squalid rooms of 
their relatives cannot wait and begin to take over municipal lands and pressure 
her to act, what will she do? "People have to understand that we can't solve in 
one day the legacy of 16 1/2 years. One million new houses are needed, and we 
can only build 40,000 in the whole country in 1990. I think people will be 
patient if they themselves set the priorities, if they understand." 
</P>
<P>
And what about education? 
</P>
<P>
She is glad I asked. Off we rush to School No. 134 of Conchali, three large 
wooden shacks nicely spruced up. The director tells me that last Friday, when 
the former authorities heard that this locale had been selected for the signing 
of the new government's first international agreement for foreign assistance, 
they sent painters, carpenters and plumbers to clean it up -- the first such 
visit since the school had been inaugurated many years ago. There is now a 
flurry of activity. While a group of children who do not quite understand what 
is going on watch and cheer and make jokes, Ricardo Lagos, minister of 
education, signs with Sweden's vice-chancellor, Pierre Schorri, a protocol 
establishing that $5 million will be donated to Chile's 900 poorest elementary 
schools. The money will be channeled through the Fund for Solidarity that 
Aylwin's administration has set up -- a direct-aid-to-the-poor sort of program 
that is supposed to attract dozens of friendly foreign gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Late that afternoon, I find myself holding a long and serious conversation in 
Santiago's central plaza with a diminutive 10-year-old beggar girl, Jocelyn, 
who happens, by an extraordinary coincidence, to be a resident of Conchali. 
When I ask her how long she's been begging, she answers, "Since I was born. My 
mama begged with me in her arms right away." 
</P>
<P>
I ask her if she knows she has a new president, a new minister of education, a 
new mayor? 
</P>
<P>
She shakes her head quite emphatically, no, and happily licks away at the ice 
cream I've bought her. 
</P>
<P>
The distance between us could not be greater. The transition I have been 
immersed in these days, that I have been working for during one-third of my 
life, has totally passed her by. And yet, after all, this is more her 
transition than mine. It will have been real, it will become something more 
than an illusion, only if, six, or if she's lucky, 10 years from now, her own 
baby does not start begging as soon as it comes out into the world. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, March 14. 
</P>
<P>
I AM TO leave in a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
With Rodrigo, I go to the Vicaria de la Solidaridad, the Catholic Church's 
human rights office, to buy some gifts for friends back home. I love the 
arpilleras -- tapestries woven by women in the slums out of colorful bits and 
pieces of material and through which, during the years, they have been telling 
the stories of their everyday lives. The one thing that was rarely missing from 
those arpilleras all this time was the military. No matter what the woven 
characters were doing -- cooking, gathering wood, picking up pieces of 
cardboard to be sold to factories, hooking up illegal wires to power lines to 
heat their stoves in the winter -- the brooding presence of darkness, of 
soldiers, of ghosts, inevitably erupted into the picture. 
</P>
<P>
In the newest arpilleras, just finished, woven only yesterday, there is not one 
military figure, not one army truck, not one stretch of barbed wire. Just 
people working and people dancing. 
</P>
<P>
The women have not depicted reality as it is but reality as they want it to be. 
</P>
<P>
Will their dreams come true? Will Chile now be able to solve the problems that 
has mired it and the rest of Latin America in poverty for all our history? Or 
will the pressures from below, the accumulation of pain from the past, be so 
vast that the military will come back once again like a nightmare to repress 
the explosion of needs and desires that the present social system cannot 
satisfy? 
</P>
<P>
The answer may depend on the people of Chile, their patience, their passion, 
their maturity. 
</P>
<P>
On the Sunday of Aylwin's inauguration, I accepted an invitation to an early 
morning Mass at a small church near one of Santiago's poorest shantytowns, La 
Victoria. When the priest asked the congregation to tell their stories and 
their hopes, many stood up. I remember two women above all. One addressed God 
as if speaking to Aylwin. Or was it the other way around? "I don't want a raise 
for myself," she prayed. "All I want, Lord, is bandages at the hospital where I 
work, so I don't have to turn my patients away. Just give me enough so I can 
take care of those who are in need." 
</P>
<P>
Then another woman spoke of the Chile we were leaving. "It was a badly woven 
cloth," she said, using imagery from her everyday life. "We got the stitches 
wrong. But this time" -- and she paused and took a deep breath, "this time we 
can't fail," she said fervently. "We have to sew this one right."

COLEUS AND CALADIUMS PROVIDE A JOLT OF GARDEN COLOR

TIRED OF IMPATIENS? Try coleus and caladiums. 
</P>
<P>
Where summers are warm, these two plants -- grown for colorful foliage, not 
flowers -- thrive in the shade. At Villa Abondanza, a private estate in the 
Hollywood Hills, these two tropical-looking plants fill the beds with 
luxuriant, even exuberant, color all season long. 
</P>
<P>
Villa Abondanza's formal beds are part of the estate's original 1920s landscape 
design. They line both sides of a cascade and pool that was inspired by the 
water chain of Villa Lante at Bagnaia (considered by many to be the finest of 
the Renaissance Italian villas). They were restored and replanted in this lush 
fashion by landscape designers Patrick Turnbull and Collie Valadez. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, after the designers became bored with impatiens, they 
discovered that caladiums and coleus grow in the same amount of shade as do 
impatiens. Every spring, the two replant the beds as though these perennial 
plants were annuals. There is no attempt to keep the coleus and caladiums 
year-round, which is possible with impatiens. Furthermore, caladiums shrivel 
with the first frost, though they can come back from their underground tubers 
with the return of warm weather. 
</P>
<P>
Turnbull and Valadez are quick to point out that Villa Abondanza has a warm 
garden with a southern exposure and that the pittosporum trees above the coleus 
and caladiums are trimmed high (the lowest branches are 7 feet up), so that 
their shade is neither dark nor dreary. The designers report similar success in 
a Brentwood garden and at their own home in Monrovia. They suspect, however, 
that where ocean breezes are more constant, and at the bottom of Coldwater and 
other cool canyons, coleus and caladiums might not find enough of the warm days 
and evenings they so obviously enjoy. In such locations, try them in sun or 
where walls protect them from ocean breezes. Because coleus are poisonous, the 
plants are not suitable for gardens visited by small children. 
</P>
<P>
Pampered as they are by Turnbull and Valadez, the standard coleus planted in 
the centers of these beds grow as tall as 4 1/2 feet by summer's end. Around 
them are caladiums, and along the edges of the beds are lower, spreading kinds 
of coleus. 
</P>
<P>
The designers plant the coleus in spring, as the season's flowers fade and 
provide space in the beds. The caladiums are planted a little later, just 
before the coleus grow together and touch. "The caladiums won't grow until the 
soil is almost hot," Turnbull says, "so we may buy the tubers earlier, but we 
don't plant them until May or June." Caladium tubers, which produce 18- to 
20-inch plants, are available from January through May; the small potted plants 
that sometimes show up at nurseries don't grow as well or as tall. 
</P>
<P>
Turnbull and Valadez use the all-green or all-red coleus but tend not to mix 
them. "Some coleus colors can really clash," Valadez says, "so we are careful 
to pick only those that go together. Too much variety makes the eye very 
nervous." Adds Turnbull: "They can look terrible, like colored popcorn." 
</P>
<P>
The designers, who handpick every plant, buy coleus as small as they can find 
them, in color packs or quart pots, because an important part of coleus culture 
is pinching -- every week the growing tips of the plants must be nipped to 
encourage bushiness; left alone, the plants tend to become tall and leggy. When 
the standard varieties in the centers of the beds are between 16 and 18 inches 
tall, they are tied to stakes so that overhead watering will not flatten them. 
</P>
<P>
And they are fed, and fed, and fed. First at planting time, when the soil is 
heavily amended with organic matter (Turnbull and Valadez use a 2-cubic-foot 
bag of planting -- not potting -- mix for every 100 square feet), a pre-plant 
fertilizer (one with numbers on the label such as 2-10-10 or 2-12-8) and a 
peppering of the slow-release fertilizer Osmocote. All of this is mixed into 
the soil. Then the plants are fertilized every week with a liquid fertilizer 
used at half-strength. "We feed them to the point of almost burning the 
foliage," Valadez says. "They are very hungry plants." The beds are also 
protected with snail bait because snails love coleus. 
</P>
<P>
All flower buds on the coleus are pinched off until about two weeks before 
Thanksgiving. By holiday time, the plants are covered with pretty blue flowers. 
Once the plants flower, they are finished and the leaves begin to drop. Even 
the flowers look good for only a week, but by then it's time to plant the 
spring garden, and out they go. 
</P>
<P>
Though this combination of coleus and caladiums lasts only through summer and 
fall, and must be replanted every spring, Turnbull will testify that "it's 
worth the extra effort because it is such high drama" -- something that would 
be too much to ask of the trusty but commonplace impatiens.

LOOKS: MY MOTHER, MY SELF-IMAGE; 
</P>
<P>
HOW A WOMAN FEELS ABOUT THE WAY SHE LOOKS CAN BE LINKED TO MATERNAL INFLUENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
IF A WOMAN HAS a positive attitude about her looks, chances are that her mother 
did, too. By the same token, psychologists say, if a woman is never satisfied 
with her appearance, her mother probably never was either. Consider Judi Baker, 
whose fashion-model mother taught her to feel confident about her looks. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I could make money looking my best, but I also knew that looks weren't 
enough," says Baker, who followed in her mother 's into the field and then 
spent her earnings from modeling and acting to attend college. "My mother 
always had a very practical, conservative attitude. There was nothing unhealthy 
about it; I just learned that it was important to look your best." 
</P>
<P>
Baker, now 40 and owner of a Los Angeles public relations and marketing firm, 
recalls that because her mother always used cosmetics, she grew up fascinated 
with makeup and learned to apply it while in the third grade. Baker's daughter, 
Lauran, a child actress who has just completed her first television commercial, 
already knows how to use makeup, but Baker doesn't allow the 10-year-old to 
wear cosmetics when she isn't working. "My mother stressed good, consistent 
skin care," Baker says, "and I'm teaching Lauran the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
Although helping young girls take pride in their appearance is desirable, 
placing too much emphasis on physical beauty can have negative effects on a 
woman's self-image, says Dawne Schoenholz, a Santa Monica-based psychologist 
who studies family relationships. "The mother who is narcissistic and spends a 
disproportionate amount of time grooming gives her daughter a distorted sense 
of value," Schoenholz says. "The young girl begins to believe that the image in 
the mirror is all-important." 
</P>
<P>
Schoenholz cites the case of a mother who wouldn't allow her young daughter to 
sleep on her stomach for fear that the girl would develop wrinkles, a fallacy 
the woman had learned from her own mother. "This kind of pressure teaches a 
child that she can be valuable only if she's beautiful -- the Marilyn Monroe 
syndrome," Schoenholz says. 
</P>
<P>
Cri Cri Solak-Eastin of Pasadena remembers her mother as "the only woman on the 
beach who would wear a French bikini, and she was always paranoid about gaining 
weight." The result, Solak-Eastin says, was that "I felt like a fat, ugly 
duckling. I was resigned to the fact that my mother was always going to be the 
more glamorous one in the family." 
</P>
<P>
Such competitive situations often can lead to a daughter's not caring about the 
way she looks or becoming even more narcissistic than her mother. In 
Solak-Eastin's case, she says, she became "determined to find my own paths to 
excel in." Now 37, a spokeswoman for a diamond-industry trade organization and 
the mother of two young daughters, Solak-Eastin says that her mother "passed 
along the idea that looks make the person. I'm trying to be sure to never send 
that message to my little girls." 
</P>
<P>
Equating self-worth with appearance is a common problem between mothers and 
daughters, explains Allana Cummings Elovson a professor at the California 
School of Professional Psychology in Los Angeles. "Even among many of the most 
educated women, the belief is still that beauty is power," says Elovson, who 
studies the link between appearance and women's mental health. "Many girls are 
pressured to believe that being a 'perfect' woman means being beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
At the other extreme, a mother who attaches almost no importance to appearance 
also communicates a silent but powerful message. "She is typically a woman with 
low self-esteem," Schoenholz says. "Her daughter not only inherits the poor 
self-esteem but also may place no value on taking care of herself. So she often 
looks as bad as she feels." 
</P>
<P>
A Pacific Palisades woman, for example, says that her mother never wore 
cosmetics or went to the hairdresser. "I thought that was absolutely normal 
until I got to high school and saw girls with styled hair and makeup," the 
44-year-old says. "I rebelled and started wearing cosmetics and dyeing my hair 
all through my teens and 20s. But look at me today -- I'm 'the natural look' 
all the way. My mother influenced me more than I ever thought she could." 
</P>
<P>
So what's a mother to do? Emphasize looks? De-emphasize looks? Schoenholz 
suggests finding a balance: "The most important thing a mother can teach her 
daughter is that she is valuable no matter what she looks like, while always 
encouraging her to look the way she feels best."

STAGE WEEK: ISRAEL HOROVITZ RETURNS TO GLOUCESTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Playwright Israel Horovitz thinks Los Angeles is a wonderful place to work out 
a new play. But not for the reasons one might imagine. 
</P>
<P>
"L.A. is so focused on TV and film that theater is kind of an arcane sport," 
the Obie- and Emmy-winning writer said. "People look at you like you're doing 
something cute." 
</P>
<P>
Despite those external perceptions, his own commitment perseveres. "As a 
playwright, I'm very close to the work," said Horovitz, author of "Strong-Man's 
Weak Child," opening Friday at Los Angeles Theatre Center. "And now, being the 
director too, it's right at the end of my nose . . . though with my nose, 
that's not so close." 
</P>
<P>
"Strong-Man" is the latest in Horovitz's "Gloucester plays" (he counts "9 or 
10" of them), a cycle of works rooted in Gloucester, Mass. Horovitz visited the 
town as a child; as an adult, he traveled back "to this place I loved so much 
and went to work in this little Victorian house on a hill." Formerly a 
working-class area, Horovitz has seen "Boston yuppies" drive the real estate 
prices up; at the same time, local businesses -- some of them five generations 
old -- began to founder and disappear. 
</P>
<P>
With local suicides on the upswing, morale at a low ebb and drugs taking fierce 
hold, Horowitz began thinking of the community as a microcosm of society's 
contemporary ills. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed if I could write about life in this little dot, it might be a 
metaphor for what's going on in the larger world," he said. "So with the 
Gloucester plays, I started to make (the setting) as important as the story. I 
had the feeling that if I got it right for Gloucester, it would work for the 
entire world." 
</P>
<P>
"Strong-Man" was inspired by Horovitz's time at a gym there. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been a runner since I was 13; now I'm 51," he said. "I've been working 
out in gyms because I don't want to look like other writers -- but since I run, 
I'm very thin. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been around gyms forever, and I really love them. What you see in 
Gloucester are these lampers (stevedores), big, beefy strong men who're not 
trained for anything else -- and now the shipping industry is closing down. I 
loved the metaphor of the men keeping their bodies in shape, almost as an 
antidote for the work going away." 
</P>
<P>
The piece, which features Meg Foster, Peter Iacangelo, Nick Mancuso and Don 
Yesso, tells of a body-builder whose daughter is stricken with bone-marrow 
cancer. "I used bone-marrow because it's the deepest possible rotting," 
Horovitz noted. "The story sounds like a soap opera, but when you see it, it's 
larger than that. You have these uneducated people discussing deeply 
philosophical issues without a sophisticated language -- dealing with questions 
like 'What is a father?' 'What is a parent?' "

There is something disarmingly refreshing about ex-Shalamar member Daniel's 
musical style. But Daniel lacks a great instinctual producer like Andre Cymone 
(who works with another Shalamar alum, Jody Watley) in his corner. The 
liveliest cuts seem to cry out for remix treatment and Daniel, who's best known 
for his choreography, needs at least one killer dance track. CONNIE JOHNSON

POP FACES: CHADWICK'S 'HOUSE': IS THIS BLASPHEMY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lot of rock music has been termed blasphemous, though rarely by the people 
who created it. 
</P>
<P>
But that's the term used by Guy Chadwick, singer-songwriter of the English 
quartet House of Love, to describe his use of religious imagery in several 
songs on the band's new album, "House of Love." The group will be at the Roxy 
on June 15 and 16. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mean to be blasphemous," the sunken-cheeked Chadwick, 30, said 
recently over a beer in the bar of a West Hollywood hotel. "But I'm sort of 
challenging my own beliefs. I don't know how I feel about religion or God. The 
power of religion has always interested me, and to an extent I'm flirting with 
it in a dangerous way. I do sometimes think, 'God, should I write that? Will He 
let me get away with that?' " 
</P>
<P>
The truth is, Chadwick's references to Jesus and God are most often ambiguous 
and ambivalent, and at worst questioning. His attitude, he says, was shaped by 
his upbringing, in which, after spending his first two years in Germany where 
his father was stationed with the British Army, he was exposed to a colorful 
world of wonders first in Singapore and then Malaya. But at age 13 he found 
himself stuck in a relatively drab boarding school in the English Midlands. 
</P>
<P>
"It was dreary, and in some ways affected me," he said. "I remember being 
disappointed in my adolescence -- a particularly bad hand dealt me, moving from 
somewhere like (Asia) to such a boring place." 
</P>
<P>
Then in the late '80s, the flowering punk scene turned his head. "It literally 
made me pick up a guitar and learn to play," he said. "It was really that 
corny." 
</P>
<P>
After several years of struggling to get a foothold in music, Chadwick signed 
an ill-fated solo deal with RCA in England in 1983. Then four years ago he 
formed House of Love, which released an independent album in 1988, drawing 
critical praise for its brisk, thoughtful guitar-pop. The new album, with a 
sound that harks back both to punk and '60s pop in a manner somewhat akin to 
that of the Church or the Stone Roses, has won even greater accolades in the 
British rock press. 
</P>
<P>
Some rock fans may consider Chadwick's biggest blasphemy to be a song on the 
new album titled "Beatles and Stones," in which he sings, "The Beatles and the 
Stones / Made it good to be alone," countering the communal-spirit party line 
associated with those groups' music. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything, that song's reverent," Chadwick maintained. "I vaguely remember 
seeing Jimi Hendrix on 'Top of the Pops,' " he said. "And I barely remember the 
Beatles." 
</P>
<P>
And he readily acknowledges ambitions that are far from Beatlesque. Instead, he 
admires the accomplishments of the Only Ones, a late-'70s English band greatly 
loved by those who remember it, but remembered by few. 
</P>
<P>
"At least they made some records, left something behind," Chadwick said. "It 
wasn't all in vain. They left something and got something as well." STEVE 
HOCHMAN

RECORD RACK: *** 1/2 JOHNNY GILL "JOHNNY GILL" MOTOWN: ALBUMS ARE RATED FROM 
ONE TO FIVE STARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the fading art of R&amp;B ballad singing, this album by one of the stars of 
New Edition is a badly needed boost. Kids today consider R&amp;B ballads old 
folks' music because the leading practitioners are in their late 20s and older, 
singing to a largely thirtysomething audience. 
</P>
<P>
The genre needs a dose of youth from good-looking, hip and prominent artists 
like Gill who are idolized by female teens. What makes Gill's album especially 
valuable is that it's one of the best R&amp;B ballad albums of the last few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most of the current crop of young, black, male artists, Gill can really 
sing. The impact of cuts like "My, My, My" and "Let's Spend the Night" show 
that he clearly understands that a good R&amp;B ballad has the intensity of a 
smoldering ember and is an exercise in sensuality and romanticism. 
</P>
<P>
Like most first-rate ballad singers, Gill is just an ordinary up-tempo singer, 
and he doesn't do justice to the few quality hip-hop tunes here. Two elite 
teams -- Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, and L.A. Reid and Babyface -- are 
responsible for the exceptional songs and production. DENNIS HUNT

WHAT THE ORIGINAL STARS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TED SHACKELFORD 
</P>
<P>
"We are this quiet little show that keeps getting better," said Shackelford, 
who plays Gary Ewing. "There is a very loyal staunch audience. People have 
'Knots Landing' parties. I think the audience likes the characters." 
</P>
<P>
Especially Gary and Val. Fans, he said, are eager to see the couple get back 
together. This season, Gary came to Val's side when she learned the truth about 
Danny. "We are getting closer," Shackelford said, laughing. "But if we got back 
together, neither one of us will have a job." 
</P>
<P>
Shackelford's willing to play Gary for as long as "Knots" is on the air. "I 
don't want to write, produce or direct," he said. "I am too old and I make too 
much money. The show has been real good to me. You will never hear me say 
anything bad publicly about the show. I am delighted to be working. You can't 
ask for better working conditions." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
JOAN VAN ARK 
</P>
<P>
"We are the darling of the network," said Van Ark, who plays Val. "We are right 
there delivering week after week. It's really quite amazing and deserves more 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
Van Ark gives most of the credit for the series' success to executive producer 
and creator David Jacobs. "I equate the show with an elite sports team like the 
Lakers. Each person in the ensemble has a position they play. The quarterback 
changes, but each player knows its game. It's a true ensemble effort. It's 
composed of players who have a position and know their position. The coach is 
David Jacobs." 
</P>
<P>
Though she said the show's fans in New York and Los Angeles usually leave her 
alone, Van Ark is constantly recognized when she visits other areas of the 
country. "People hit on you like crazy," she said. "They do come up and talk to 
you. A lot of what they talk about is about Gary and Val. People appreciate 
Val." 
</P>
<P>
And how long will she stay with the show? "Well," said Van Ark, coyly. "I think 
I will pass on that question." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MICHELE LEE 
</P>
<P>
Lee agrees with her co-stars that it's their characters that keep the audience 
tied to "Knots." "Our characters have histories and back stories," said the 
actress. "There is also a sense of future. They are three-dimensional and are 
honest and decent." 
</P>
<P>
But it's getting more difficult for Lee to do the show. "It's harder to make 
realistic and believable stories and make them interesting," she said. "You 
fight to keep it interesting for yourself and the show. I find myself having 
less fun in that area. I think the reason Joan and I get so obsessive about the 
show and our characters is that we care deeply about what's going on in the 
screen. I think it's possible to bend and squeeze yourself into a situation. I 
try to do that, but there have been moments when I have been opposed to a 
situation that goes against the grain of my character. We have dropped the 
storyline." 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Lee was allowed to direct an episode of "Knots"; she's also 
directed two more this year and hopefully will do more next season. "I had been 
interested in directing before TKnots,"U she said. "It's one of the reasons I 
still want to be on TKnots.' You can love a character to death, but you can do 
it so many years and then you need other things."

THE SCENE 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 artists will participate this year in the annual Venice Art Walk, 
which will be held next Sunday from noon-5 p.m. Organizers say they expect more 
than 5,000 people to attend the event, at which each guest will be given a map 
of Venice for a self-guided walking tour of studios of such noted artists as 
Laddie John Dill, Fritz Scholder, John Okulick and Daniel J. Martinez. Tickets 
for the event are $45 each and include admission to 24 special exhibitions 
ranging from kinetic art, to a billboard installation, to photography shows. 
</P>
<P>
Among other activities included during Art Walk will be a silent auction -- 
featuring more than 300 works by contemporary Southern California artists 
including Carlos Almaraz, Billy Al Bengston, Jonathan Borofsky, Sam Francis, 
and Lawrence Gipe; a food fair featuring samplings from 13 Westside restaurants 
-- including Campanile's, Chaya Brasserie, 72 Market Street and DC3; and the 
sale of the Art Walk '90 poster by Peter Alexander and the T-shirt by Jeffrey 
Vallance. 
</P>
<P>
But while the main activities will be held next Sunday, Art Walk -- which 
engages the services of 500 volunteers and benefits the Venice Family Clinic -- 
actually begins on Saturday. The first activities will be docent tours -- led 
by familiar art figures such as curator Josine Ianco-Starrels, gallery owner 
Jan Turner and arts lawyer Sylvia Haimoff White -- to artists' spaces in Santa 
Monica, West L.A. and downtown L.A. The tours will visit studios of artists 
including Lari Pittman, Lita Albuquerque, George Herms and Robbie Conal. The 
cost for each tour -- there are a total of six, three each on Saturday and next 
Sunday -- is $90 and includes a catered lunch. Also on Saturday, the Art Walk 
'90 dinner will be held at the Santa Monica Airport from 6:30-11 p.m.. Tickets 
are $225 each. 
</P>
<P>
Art Walk's starting location and registration center will be at Westminster 
School, 1010 W. Washington Blvd., Venice. for information or reservations, call 
(213) 392-WALK, Ext. 343. 
</P>
<P>
Jenny Holzer isn't just for the museums any more. In fact, even couch potatoes 
can now be privy to her art. Today through Saturday, TV spots by the artist 
will be shown during regular commercial and program breaks on Los Angeles 
stations KCOP Channel 13 and KTLA Channel 5. 
</P>
<P>
The works were originally conceived and created by the New York-based Holzer 
for cable video network MTV in 1989, as part of the network's "Art Breaks" 
program. Consequently, newer versions have been produced for Italian TV in 
conjunction with the upcoming Venice Biennale, at which Holzer will represent 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The 27 spots, running from 6 to 14 seconds in length, will be aired in the 
early-morning, daytime and late-night slots, and are expected to be seen by 
nearly a million viewers. Like the rest of her work, the TV spots present 
deceptively simple sequences of text -- such as "Private property created 
crime" -- that mix provocative social commentary with resonant poetic 
reflection. 
</P>
<P>
Television isn't the only direction the Long Beach Museum of Art is branching 
out into. Beginning this Friday, the museum is holding a mystery/dinner theater 
production that will be held every Friday when exhibitions are up in the 
museum. The play, "Consequences," features a tangled maze of clues that takes 
the audience through the Museum and its sculpture garden as they strive to 
solve the crime. The event costs $49.50 per person, with dinner and hors 
d'oeuvres included. Advance reservations are required. Information: (213) 
439-2119. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OVERHEARD 
</P>
<P>
"People still think the entertainment world is sexier than the arts. But if 
they could just hear the stories circulating these days -- about things like 
all the older women having affairs with younger men -- they might not still 
think so." -- A certain well-connected L.A. arts figure during a recent private 
reception. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

EATING AMOK (AND OTHER CAMBODIAN WONDERS) 
</P>

<BYLINE>

By LINDA BURUM

<TEXT>
<P>
"Little Phnom Penh" is easy to spot. Suddenly, a plain-American street in Long 
Beach sprouts dozens of signs in wiggly Khmer script -- you're in the middle of 
the largest Cambodian expatriate community in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Cambodian businesses have revived this once-decaying strip of Anaheim Street, 
but oddly, there were few Cambodian restaurants until a short while ago. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 40,000 Cambodians live here. Traditionally, though, Cambodian food 
was cooked at home, from ingredients picked in the backyard and fished from a 
nearby stream. When Cambodians did go out, it was usually to a Chinese 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 At last a sort of restaurant row has developed. After more than a decade of 
radical cultural adjustments, including the two-income family, 
Cambodian-Americans have discovered the advantages of leaving the 
time-consuming preparation of their favorite dishes to restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 The new places cropping up in Little Phnom Penh have also become the hub of 
business and social activity. Some are booked for weddings and parties on 
weekends. It isn't necessary yet to make reservations at a Cambodian 
restaurant, but it's wise to call ahead and make sure it's open. 
</P>
<P>
 Cambodian cooking has a lot in common with the food of its neighbors, Thailand 
and Vietnam, and shares the same Indian and Chinese influences. Although not as 
spicy-hot as Thai, it relies on similar seasonings. One thing that identifies 
the food as Cambodian is the emphatic use of salted, pickled or fermented fish 
condiments; if you like Thai food, the tastes will be instantly familiar. 
</P>
<P>
The owners of Battambang turned an Anaheim Street auction house into a 
pleasant, roomy restaurant, a sort of community clubhouse. At the end of the 
dining area, opposite a hand-painted mural of Angkor Wat, a 50-inch television 
set screens Cambodian movies, singers and sports. 
</P>
<P>
The menu, a thick tome written in four languages -- English, Khmer, Chinese and 
Vietnamese -- may look exotic, but with a few exceptions it proves to be 
everyday Chinese food. My Cambodian friends put this printed menu aside and 
ordered duck sour soup, amok and praw hok k'tee, dishes not listed at all. 
</P>
<P>
Memorize the phrase: "Please bring us the small plastic table-top menu written 
in Khmer." That's what you have to say to get the menu that lists complete 
Cambodian meals. You won't be able to read it, but you can point to the A or C 
dinners, which are particularly good ways to explore the cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
On the $16 "A" dinner, suitable for two or three, you get your choice of beef 
hot-and-sour soup or duck sour soup. The latter is a robust curry-like dish in 
which tamarind, lemon grass and leaves from the tropical "kaffir lime" each 
lend a different tone of tartness, mellowed with the richness of coconut milk 
and the ethereal aroma of ground toasted rice. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time you'll be served two other dishes. For one of them, be sure to 
choose praw hok k'tee, one of the best dishes Cambodian cuisine has to offer: 
minced pork cooked in coconut milk, beautifully seasoned with lime leaf, a 
little fresh chile and pickled fish. It's one of a number of Cambodian minced 
meat dishes served with a plate of raw vegetables for scooping up the seasoned 
meat. 
</P>
<P>
For the other dish, you might choose the clams fried with mint to study the 
similarities between Cambodian and Thai cooking. I'd really recommend picking 
the outstanding beef salad, though. For dessert you'll get a typical Southeast 
Asian-style tapioca soup, slightly sweet, topped with slices of yu t'iao -- 
Chinese doughnut. 
</P>
<P>
A dish worth ordering a la carte with the "A" dinner is amok, a creamy Asian 
pate of fish and coconut milk steamed on a bed of Chinese greens (if you've had 
the Thai hormok you'll recognize it). On the "C" dinner, though, you can get 
amok without having to order a la carte. 
</P>
<P>
That "C" dinner ($28) serves four or five. For starters, choose Cambodian-style 
lobster soup with banana blossoms. It tastes like a milder version of the Thai 
hot-and-sour shrimp soup tom yam koong and sparkles with the heady scent of 
lemon grass. 
</P>
<P>
The second dish, a whole fish, may be ordered deep fried with a tart dipping 
sauce or with Chinese-style brown bean sauce. If you wish, though, the waitress 
will substitute amok. Mandarin fried chicken, the third item, may seem to lack 
Cambodian character but my friends, reaching for second helpings of the 
deliciously crunchy bird, informed me that mixing Chinese and Cambodian food in 
a restaurant was perfectly natural -- particularly since this is 
Cambodian-style Chinese food. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth dish, trey praw ma chum hoy, is a steamed cake of pork, fish and egg 
with a potent fishy flavor that is best eaten with lots of rice. Dessert is the 
same exotic tapioca soup as on the "A" dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Battambang Restaurant, 2501 E. Anaheim St., Long Beach. (213) 439-9301. Open 7 
a.m. to 9 p.m. daily. 
</P>
<P>
Monorom is the least opulent of Little Phnom Penh's restaurants. But the 
frail-looking lady behind its stoves has a knack for creating spectacular 
flavors. 
</P>
<P>
Although Monorom's menu does describe some dishes in English, ordering has its 
share of frustrations. Here, as in most of the other restaurants, the Khmer 
name of a dish is not given in Roman letters, making it impossible to order 
most of the dishes except by pointing. And sometimes delicious-looking food 
appears on other tables that isn't on the menu at all. 
</P>
<P>
But if you point or ask the owner what he has on special, you're likely to wind 
up with something wonderful. That's how I discovered nataing, one of the most 
delicious Cambodian dishes I've ever eaten. It looks like a bowl of chili and 
comes with puffy rice cakes and French bread, which you dip in the nataing. The 
secret of the dish's creaminess is the ground peanuts and coconut milk in the 
mild pepper-flavored sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The first section of Monorom's menu lists rice plates, including a house 
specialty, pork stew over rice. Below the rice plates are 16 dishes, mostly 
written in Khmer. Count down to the eighth one (like all Cambodian restaurants, 
Monorom makes things tough for most of us by using Cambodian rather than Arabic 
numerals on the menu) and order tak kruen, a dip accompanied by a plate of 
vegetables. It's rather like praw hok k'tee, using grilled fish in place of 
meat, and is dressed with lime sauce, fresh Asian basil and chiles. 
</P>
<P>
Monorom's fish sour soup with banana blossoms (third on the list) consists of 
catfish slices, tomatoes, pineapple and, of course, banana buds (think of them 
as hot-pink hearts of palm), in a clear, tangy broth generously sprinkled with 
fried garlic. The curry-like beef sour soup (fourth down), dosed with tart lime 
leaf and turmeric, is flecked with delicate, pointed "water grass" leaves that 
resemble very tender spinach. Water grass also appears, sauteed with bit of 
minced pork and a light sweet garlicky sauce, in the last (16th) dish on the 
list. 
</P>
<P>
 Monorom, 2150 E. Anaheim St., Long Beach. (213) 987-0130. Open 9 a.m. to 9 
p.m. daily. 
</P>
<P>
Peilin is one of the oldest of the Cambodian places. The large, open dining 
room is dazzling: vibrant coral-colored walls rimmed with electric blue and 
vermilion neon strips. And when the restaurant is full, which it often is at 
lunchtime, there's a lively energy in the room. 
</P>
<P>
As at Battambang, the four-language printed menu primarily lists Chinese items 
and a table-top menu lists the Cambodian dishes in Khmer script. My Cambodian 
friends recommended the second item on the table-top menu, a home-style dish 
called samlaw. Cambodian cooks make many kinds of samlaws and this one, a soupy 
stew of quail and beef, included exotic vegetables such as Asian pumpkin and 
golf ball-sized eggplants. 
</P>
<P>
We also had succulent Cambodian-style sates (fifth on the list), and a 
Cambodian beef salad (No. 6). This fresh-tasting toss of thinly cut beef and 
cabbage, bathed in a sweet-tart lime dressing, comes artfully garnished with 
red bell pepper strips and roasted peanuts. 
</P>
<P>
You can try giant Asian prawns by ordering the crab soup, No. 57, and asking 
that "lobster" be substituted (Cambodian restaurants refer to their giant 
prawns as lobsters). The huge meaty prawns are cooked shell and all in a tart 
and spicy seafood broth fragrant with lemon grass. 
</P>
<P>
 Peilin Restaurant, 2232 E. Anaheim St., Long Beach, (213) 433-3810. Open 7:30 
a.m. to 9 p.m. daily. (Note: Peilin plans to move to 1350 E. Anaheim sometime 
in June.) 
</P>
<P>
 Kim and Sophy Ngann have opened Royal Palace in the North Long Beach-Lakewood 
area, a suburban outpost of Little Phnom Penh. It has the usual Chinese menu 
that doesn't tell the whole story. In this case, the two back pages of the menu 
are written in Khmer, as are the Cambodian specialties listed on the wall above 
the buffet area. Sophy Ngann's descriptions of these are dependable. 
</P>
<P>
The Nganns are justly proud of their sates, which make good appetizers. When 
you've finished them, bypass the first 20 items on the Khmer menu, all Chinese, 
for the more traditional Cambodian dishes, the 21st through 32nd, plus the 
50th. 
</P>
<P>
Of these, Kim Ngann recommended kapi cha kreung (29th down), one of the 
Cambodian dishes of minced meat to be dipped up with vegetables. This version, 
flavored with salty shrimp paste and a little chile, went perfectly with cool, 
tart slices of green mango. 
</P>
<P>
Royal Palace's tak kruen, the pounded fish dip with lime (31st down), lacks the 
chile and basil flavors that make Monorom's so exciting. But a hearty samlaw 
that combined squab, catfish, eggplant and Chinese greens in curry-like broth 
was the tastiest I've had. Cambodians have a particular way of eating this 
dish: put a fish slice and a little liquid over some rice, and proceed with a 
spoon in the right hand and a fork in the left. 
</P>
<P>
From the Cambodian dishes listed on the wall, I chose poh 'ohw cham hoy, 
another meat dip for vegetables. This time the meat was flavored with pickled 
fish called poh 'ohw. Tre kaw svei katchai, a dish of sliced catfish, came 
lightly coated in a rich, slightly salty glaze and topped with julienne of 
green mango. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal Palace, 3713 E. South St., Long Beach. (213) 630-7306. Open Monday 
through Friday 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
At Banteay Srey Village, ordering is relatively simple. The dishes are listed 
by categories, such as soft noodle, appetizers, spicy soups and chowders 
(thickened samlaws), and they are described in English. 
</P>
<P>
"Hot pot" dinners at a Cambodian restaurant can be any kind of dish cooked 
communally at the table, whether in the familiar Mongolian hot pot or a chafing 
dish. But not all of Banteay Srey's hot pots are successful. Beef with anchovy 
sauce a la Cambodia is an unappealing plate of barely seasoned, lukewarm 
grilled beef that had been cooked in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Another time we ordered the Banteay Srey Village hot pot No. 27, which may be 
the restaurant's best item. First the waitress brings a chafing dish filled 
with a slightly sweet curry and coconut milk broth. As it begins to simmer, 
platters of soft fresh rice noodles, raw vegetables and herbs, and thinly 
sliced beef and seafood arrive. You are equipped with long-handled wire baskets 
for retrieving the food from the simmering pot. To eat, you either wrap pieces 
of meat and seafood in lettuce with a few sprigs of the herbs, taco-fashion, or 
mix them into a small bowl of silky noodles and broth. 
</P>
<P>
Other good bets are the Cambodian sausage, any of the seafood hot-and-sour 
soups and the soft rice noodle Cambodian-style. But it must be said that some 
of Banteay Srey's less successful dishes could discourage one from ever trying 
Cambodian food again. The quail and vegetable chowder was murky tasting, the 
dressing on our squid salad lackluster, and tre pa ma chum hoy overcooked and 
dry. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday and Saturday evenings when Banteay Srey has live entertainment, the 
restaurant is filled to overflowing with groups of smiling eaters. And when the 
singer takes the stage some diners applaud as she begins a favorite song. It's 
clear Cambodian people are beginning to feel at home in Long Beach. And they 
are making restaurant dining part of the new Cambodian-American culture. 
</P>
<P>
Well and good. Now, if only someone would spell out the Cambodian names on 
these menus, we would know what to call our favorite dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Banteay Srey Village Restaurant, 1020 Anaheim St., Long Beach. (213) 495-4140. 
Open 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. daily.

ANGKOR: CAMBODIAN FOR BEGINNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH REICHL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angkor is a Cambodian restaurant you don't need a crib sheet to eat in. 
</P>
<P>
It is about the gentlest place you can imagine. 
</P>
<P>
Walk in with your own bottle of wine, ask if the management minds, and you get 
a smile and the following response: "We would like you to have whatever would 
please you." 
</P>
<P>
And it is very hard not to be pleased here. Is the food completely authentic? 
Probably not. I sense that it has been tamed for the American palate. It is, 
however, completely delicious. The flavors are as gentle as the atmosphere, 
every sharp accent kissed with coconut, every sweet balanced by sour. 
</P>
<P>
The same flavors appear again and again: pork and prawns are a common 
combination, as in the shredded green papaya salad with pork and prawns in a 
light lime sauce. Lime is another recurring theme: you find it, for instance, 
on the appealingly simple baked eggplant. And coconut weaves its way through 
the menu in a particularly appealing way. A fabulous soup of chicken, pineapple 
and red curry is stirred into a coconut broth. Even better, however, is the 
chunks of boneless chicken mixed with vegetables and curry and steamed in a 
whole young coconut. 
</P>
<P>
The food rarely has much real bite; when the menu says spicy, it only means 
sort of spicy. The food here is as gentle as the atmosphere, and when you put 
them together it makes you very glad that there is at least one Cambodian 
restaurant outside of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Angkor, 16161 Ventura Blvd., Encino. (818) 990-8491. Open for lunch 
Monday-Saturday 11 a.m.-3 p.m.; for dinner nightly 5-10 p.m.

INFLUENCING TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Mahler's "The New Power of TV Advertisers" (May 6) described the 
growing influence that Christian Leaders for Responsible Television (CLeaR-TV) 
is gaining with TV advertisers. This frightens me far more than any of the junk 
on the air. 
</P>
<P>
I strongly object to clergymen of a religion that is not my own trying to 
dictate what I will be able to watch by pressuring TV advertisers not to 
sponsor certain shows. I hope that both the broadcasters and the companies 
mentioned in the article recognize that CLeaR-TV does not speak for all 
Christians. 
</P>
<P>
More important, I hope they realize that not all TV viewers and not all 
customers for their products are Christians. Some of us are Jews, Muslims, 
Sikhs, Buddhists or Bahais. I think even atheists watch TV and buy cars.

ORIGINAL 'RUNNER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Concerning Michael Wilmington's capsule review of "Blade Runner" in the May 6 
list of special screenings: 
</P>
<P>
I agree with Wilmington's criticism of "the tough-guy narration and a tacked-on 
happy ending" in the version of "Blade Runner" that has been seen by millions 
since 1982. But had he attended last Sunday's screening at the Cineplex Odeon 
Fairfax, he would have been happy to be proven wrong, I believe. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere, the exhibitor obtained a print of what looked to be the director's 
cut of the film. 
</P>
<P>
It was obviously an audience test print, as it had no titles, and only half of 
the music was finished. But it had no "tough-guy narration" by Harrison Ford, 
no "tacked-on happy ending," and it was perfect. 
</P>
<P>
Warners had cut all that was important out of this film, apparently trying to 
make it a "Star Wars." A film about a sociopath who develops a sense of mercy 
and, in dying, passes it to the hero with no conscience was made into a movie 
about tall buildings and flying cars. 
</P>
<P>
Warners should come clean and release a director's cut of this film, if only on 
home video. Until it does, it will be denying the world a potential classic. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Cineplex Odeon Corp. confirmed that the special print (70 millimeter) shown in 
its Classic Film Festival was the cut of director Ridley Scott and that it 
differed from the released version. A company spokesman said the publicity 
material for the screening was sent out before this was known.

Re "Yoko Ono, a Decade After the 'Horrible Thing,' " May 6: 
</P>
<P>
Interviewer Glenn Plaskin wasted little time with polite patter and dug into 
the subjects that we're all dying to know about: Yoko's abortions, finances, 
sexual conduct and drug history. 
</P>
<P>
Amid all this he asks, "No matter what Yoko does, she's frequently the victim 
of bad press. Any idea why?" 
</P>
<P>
More amazing still is that Yoko somehow felt obliged to answer these inquiries. 
Being famous must be a real treat.

ARTISTIC SURVIVAL

"Lewd, immoral, obscene . . . the lowest expression of pure filth." The above 
statement was made not made about a Robert Mapplethorpe or Andres Serrano 
exhibition in 1990 but rather in 1939 concerning Thomas Hart Benton's painting 
"Susanna and the Elders." 
</P>
<P>
(The current Los Angeles County Museum show of Benton works was reviewed by 
William Wilson April 29.) 
</P>
<P>
It has been interesting to re-read quotes from Benton and Mapplethorpe, very 
different artists from very different eras. It would appear both were concerned 
with (and condemned for) presenting images that existed in America at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Would Thomas Hart Benton have had trouble getting National Endowment for the 
Arts support for an exhibit in 1939? One knows that "Susanna and the Elders," 
or for that matter, 1939's "Persephone" (also a nude), would probably still 
raise eyebrows in Cincinnati in 1990! 
</P>
<P>
The Bentons of yesteryear and the Mapplethorpes of today will survive their 
eras' condemnation to enlighten our descendants; with or without a public's 
"Cincinnati mentality" . . . and with or without government funding!

MISSISSIPPI DELTA: THIRD WORLD POVERTY IN AMERICA'S HEARTLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT McCARTNEY and CHRISTOPHER SULLIVAN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SHARKEY COUNTY, Miss. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Willie Mae Watson lives with her six children and 11 grandchildren in a 
four-room shanty without plumbing or even an outhouse. It is little more than 
plywood walls and a torn tin roof. 
</P>
<P>
Not far away, 22-year-old Flora Knight is struggling to earn a high school 
diploma while rearing her six children -- ages 7, 6, 5, 3, 2 and 4 months. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't have too good a chance," she said of the youngsters. "I don't think 
they'll have a job waiting here for them, even if they go to school and 
finish." 
</P>
<P>
The mighty river and loamy soil of the Mississippi Delta, from downstate 
Illinois to Louisiana's Gulf Coast, form one of the world's most bountiful 
basins. It is land that produces agricultural treasures for the rest of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Why, then, does this place Mark Twain called "the body of the nation" not 
support its own children? 
</P>
<P>
Why does this area have a larger proportion of its people living in extreme 
poverty than Appalachia? Why do the rich cargoes of the river's barges and 
tankers pass these children by? 
</P>
<P>
The Delta ranks below some Third World countries in its infant mortality rate. 
Unemployment runs 60% above the nationwide average and income per person, at 
$10,192 a year, is 25% less. It is a region that is little noticed by most 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The Delta, which gave birth to the blues, has seen decades of racism, economic 
failure and indifference, according to a federal commission that has studied 
the region and its 8 million people for 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Monday members of the Lower Mississippi Delta Development Commission will 
recommend to Congress how to stimulate growth in the area, which runs through 
Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas and Louisiana and 
Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
But forging a better future for the 3 million children of the Delta will take 
more than suggestions in a report. 
</P>
<P>
"This ain't no good place to grow up, but we try our best," said Mavis Watson, 
one of the 18 inhabitants of the shack on the Panther Burn Plantation here. 
</P>
<P>
Although the states have made a concerted effort to improve Delta schools, a 
pattern of poor education scares off businesses that might bring jobs to the 
area. Too many people fail to take advantage of the meager medical care 
available, and environmental pollution compounds public health problems. 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture remains the dominant industry, but farm jobs have been lost to 
mechanization. Many of the poor here (most are black) can find only 
minimum-wage labor at harvest time. Most work so rarely that they cannot draw 
unemployment benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear people say nothing good ever going to happen here," said Bubba 
Sullivan, who runs an eclectic blues record store in Helena, Ark. "If you don't 
have industry, you don't have a middle class, you can't blame kids on welfare." 
</P>
<P>
Unskilled, uneducated and without savings, the adults cannot find a way to a 
better life and their children often face a future as bleak as the past. 
</P>
<P>
School dropout, pregnancy and unemployment rates among teen-agers here are some 
of the worst in the nation. Babies born in some Delta counties are less likely 
to survive than infants in French Guiana or Malaysia. Tunica County, in 
Mississippi, has been called "America's Ethiopia." 
</P>
<P>
The people matter-of-factly tell horror stories: A 10-year-old boy burning 
scraps of paper in his house to keep warm; a child saved by $100,000 worth of 
medical treatment in a university hospital only to return home to a shack and 
die of rat bites. 
</P>
<P>
The 1980 census found that more than a third of all households lacked indoor 
plumbing or central heating. Although federal programs have replaced some 
shacks, crumbling houses are still a common sight. 
</P>
<P>
Potential leaders and role models -- the people with grit and drive -- usually 
move away. Those who earn college degrees or learn skills can't find jobs that 
pay well, so they go elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana, for example, once kept 70% of the doctors it educated and trained. 
Now only 30% of them stay, Greg Bowser of the Louisiana Health Care Authority 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our biggest export? People," said Stan Hyland, a Memphis State University 
anthropologist who works with the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Welfare payments through Aid to Families with Dependent Children in 1986 
totaled almost $340 million in the 214 counties of the Delta region. That was 
only a fraction of the government transfer payments to the poor people of the 
Delta. They amounted to almost $2 billion, excluding Medicare and Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
Even with so much aid, the most basic want still can be found in countless tiny 
towns and clusters of workers' houses on the farms. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're getting children ready to go to school and they don't have the 
proper clothes to put on, and they're old enough to know that this is not the 
way they're supposed to go to school . . . . We've found that that is causing a 
lot of our dropouts," said the Rev. Bertha Thurman of Belzoni, Miss. "They're 
ashamed." 
</P>
<P>
Thurman is rearing a 16-year-old foster daughter and the daughter's 2-year-old 
son on food stamps and money she earns cleaning houses. 
</P>
<P>
"You've just got to have a heart full of love, and you can't buy groceries with 
it, either," she said. "Make you pray a whole lot!" 
</P>
<P>
At the northern end of the Delta region, Cairo, Ill., businesswoman Helen 
Bishoff sees children similarly disadvantaged. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing as an alternative to drinking and drugs and standing around on 
street corners and sitting on hoods of cars. We do not have a movie theater. 
There's no teen center," said Bishoff, who is pushing to get a center built. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no enrichment for these children," she said, "nothing to show them the 
world beyond." 
</P>
<P>
Rims Barber, who has worked with the poor in Mississippi since 1964, said that 
for many Delta youngsters, "life is only something that happens to them. 
They're only passive players. 
</P>
<P>
"Ask me what I might do tonight; I can handle that. Ask me what I might do when 
I grow up; I can't handle that." 
</P>
<P>
Annie Brown is working to change things, but has found that people here aren't 
always eager for change. 
</P>
<P>
The daughter of a sharecropper, she runs a literacy program in Rolling Fork, 
Miss., that she started in 1985 with classes around a card table in her funeral 
home. Since then, 27 adults have earned high school diplomas. 
</P>
<P>
"Illiteracy is a poisonous disease to our children," said Brown, who thunders 
with a preacher's fiery passion in describing how whites fought her efforts 
because they feared losing their cooks, maids and farmhands. 
</P>
<P>
"Here you have to push, you have to demand, you have to say, 'This is what we 
are going to do,' " she said. "I get knocked down sometimes, but I bounce back 
like a rubber ball." 
</P>
<P>
Blacks and whites in the Delta agree that leaders in the past were reluctant to 
diversify the agricultural economy that so enriched its owners. Development 
lagged, river ports lost business and the area fell further and further behind. 
</P>
<P>
If progress is to be made, attitudes must change -- especially the "plantation 
orientation" that lingers from the days of slave labor, said Emma 
Cooper-Harris, who runs a community development organization in Rolling Fork. 
</P>
<P>
"This goes way back, beyond what the eye can see," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"My daddy is illiterate, but he had visions for his children. He'd often tell 
us -- and give us a paddling if he thought that we weren't doing what we were 
supposed to have done in school -- 'I want you to grow up and be somebody. I 
don't want you to have to work on this farm like I have ever since I was 8 
years old.' He had visions for us. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got teen parents in the 10th grade -- and their children are in 
kindergarten! We have sixth and seventh-graders that have had abortions. I'm 
empty when I talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
Martha Ann Michael, a mother prodding her three children to study in their 
15-by-30-foot shack outside Cary, Miss., tries her best to preach the value of 
education. 
</P>
<P>
"My baby," she said of her 6-year-old daughter. "She's an honor roll student." 
</P>
<P>
The family survives on food stamps and $144 a month in welfare. Their name is 
on a long waiting list for public housing. 
</P>
<P>
When there's work at a local cotton gin, the mother pays off backlogged bills 
and tries to set aside something for small Christmas or birthday presents. 
</P>
<P>
How would she change things? 
</P>
<P>
"My children would have everything they wanted," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"And what do I want? I want me a job."

BUSH PLEDGES 'GOOD FAITH' BUDGET TALKS; 
</P>
<P>
DEFICIT: THE PRESIDENT WON'T SAY WHERE HE STANDS ON A POSSIBLE TAX INCREASE BUT 
PROMISED NOT TO SET ANY PRECONDITIONS IN HIS SUMMIT WITH CONGRESS.

President Bush brushed off a political firestorm over possible tax increases on 
Friday by saying, "I can't be ruffled," and he refused to reveal what he will 
put on the table at this week's budget summit with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to show you my hand. I haven't seen a lot of hands being laid 
down," Bush said as he embarked on a weekend trip of college commencement 
speeches. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats have been reluctant to be the first to mention taxes, urging Bush 
instead to take the lead in offering a formula to cut the growing budget 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has warned that there would be mandatory spending cuts 
approaching $100 billion this fall unless Congress and the White House agree on 
major reductions in the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, talking with reporters on Air Force One, refused to provide any clues 
about his strategy but promised to bargain in good faith with Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
En route to a commencement address at Texas A&amp;I University -- his first of 
three for the weekend -- the President moved quickly to put out a brushfire 
fueled by distrust and concern over his true intentions in the process. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no conditions, and that's the way it is," Bush said. "That's the way 
it's going to be and that's the way it must be." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.) said the budget talks shouldn't 
just work toward a broad agreement. He suggested that members dealing with the 
budget should be given official status as a joint committee that actually 
shapes a final budget bill for House and Senate action. 
</P>
<P>
But Lugar said he is not optimistic the planned talks can produce an agreement. 
"The gaps are so large, and the politics of it are so difficult," Lugar told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's invitation to budget negotiations has raised suspicions among Democrats 
of an election-year tax trap and sparked fears of election setbacks for 
Republicans who have made anti-tax pledges a key part of their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has not said he would endorse tax increases, but he has muted his 
no-new-taxes pledge for the budget talks, which begin Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration is telling Republicans privately that the "no preconditions" 
stance offered by the White House does not necessarily mean Bush will accept 
increased taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere for the talks was clouded when White House chief of staff John 
Sununu suggested last week that the President would not accept a tax increase 
regardless of what the Democrats propose. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, asked if Sununu's remarks reflected his position, said, "I would ask you 
to reflect my posture, to talk about what I say. . . . So I'd respectfully 
suggest you take your guidance from me on this one, because that's the way it 
is." 
</P>
<P>
And Bush said Sununu was not in trouble for his remarks. "That's silly, so 
stupid. None of these congressmen are in trouble, either," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm approaching it very openly, and I recognize the controversy swirling 
around from one statement or another," he said. "But look, stay on track, 
steady as she goes, and be open, deal frankly with people and deal in the way 
I've said." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said, "Tomorrow there'll be another tidal wave so keep your snorkel above 
the water level and do what you think is best. 
</P>
<P>
"(It) goes back to what my mom taught me when I was about 6: 'Do your best, do 
your best.' Well, I'm trying hard. Stay calm." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said, "I think the President has a certain responsibility to stay cool, 
make clear to people that he's dealing in good faith and do my best. 
</P>
<P>
"That's exactly what I intend to do, and I can't be ruffled by these things," 
Bush said. "I've got to be understanding when people come forward and express 
themselves forcefully on something like this." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, (D-Tex.), on board the President's plane, said he was 
willing to give Bush "the benefit of the doubt." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's back on track," Bentsen, one of the Senate negotiators, said of 
the budget talks, "as long as we can keep these fellows in line." 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Bush began the two days of commencement speeches at Texas A&amp;I 
with the promise that an American flag will be planted on Mars by the year 
2019, although he had no specifics on how to achieve that costly goal. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who would be 95 years old if he lived to see that promise fulfilled, 
later traveled to Columbia, S.C., for a fund-raiser for Republican Gov. Carroll 
A. Campbell Jr.

FASHION SHOWS -- A FAMILY AFFAIR; 
</P>
<P>
CHILDREN: HARD-TO-PLACE YOUNGSTERS PUT ON A SHOW TO TRY TO WIN HEARTS OF 
PROSPECTIVE PARENTS.

<P>
Milton and Emmie Douglas had seen photographs of children who needed parents. 
They wanted a closer look, and got it at a special shopping mall fashion show. 
</P>
<P>
A 9-year-old boy who had been left on a doorstep as an infant won their hearts 
by walking offstage and asking: "Y'all gonna be my mother and father?" 
</P>
<P>
"He just picked us out of the crowd," Milton Douglas said. "We don't know what 
drew him to us. But we're glad it happened that way." 
</P>
<P>
"What made me think they were my parents was the way they looked at me," said 
Larry, now 11 and the Douglases' adopted son. Using spring fashion shows as a 
way to find families for hard-to-place children may be unique to Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
J.C. Penney puts on the shows, and for the last eight years has invited the 
state Department of Social Services to bring children who have been ruled free 
for adoption but don't have a family waiting for them. 
</P>
<P>
Penney's supplies clothes for the children to model, and a social worker tells 
shoppers about the need for foster and adoptive parents and says a sentence or 
two about each child. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not familiar with anybody else that does fashion shows. That doesn't mean 
it's not being done," said Mary Beth Seader, vice president of the National 
Committee for Adoption. 
</P>
<P>
Some viewers, like Gloria Mitchell, were offended. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going back in time. This is like slavery," said Mitchell, who went to a 
show March 17 to see if an advertisement she'd read was real. "We're auctioning 
off these kids." 
</P>
<P>
But state social workers say it finds families. And officials with other 
adoption agencies say that as long as the children understand that there is no 
guarantee they will find parents and are treated with sensitivity, it sounds 
like a reasonable technique. 
</P>
<P>
"I would love to not have to do this. I would love it if we had more families 
than children. But that's not the reality," said Kerry Ermon, one of two family 
recruitment workers for the Social Services agency. "Let me tell you, it is a 
very effective recruitment campaign." 
</P>
<P>
In the month after this year's shows, about 80 people called to ask about 
fostering or adoption as a direct result of seeing the shows or news reports 
about them, according to Ermon. 
</P>
<P>
Larry was one of hundreds of thousands of children around the country who were 
in state custody because they were orphaned, abandoned, abused or neglected, 
because their parents couldn't control them, or for some other reason. 
</P>
<P>
Most eventually are returned to their parents or raised by relatives, but more 
than 15% eventually are released for adoption, according to the National 
Committee for Adoption, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the last year for which figures are available, an estimated 276,000 
children nationwide were in what bureaucrats call substitute care, according to 
the organization. 
</P>
<P>
Of about 5,000 children in Louisiana's custody, 800 are eligible for adoption. 
Half will be adopted by their foster parents, but caseworkers are still trying 
to find homes for 416, said Bobby Ann Clark of the Department of Social 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
When Larry sauntered across the stage at a suburban mall, he had been in foster 
care for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Emmie Douglas said he had been left as an infant on the doorstep of a couple 
who cared for him for seven years. But after the woman died, state welfare 
workers decided that the man was too old to take care of the boy, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Larry knew the fashion show didn't guarantee him parents. He was optimistic 
when he walked onto the stage, but became nervous when couples walked up 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought they were going to pick either Nina or Jerry, but they came and 
picked me," he said. "I thought, 'Wow! I'll finally be adopted!' I was happy." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of state and local adoption groups said their main concerns 
about the fashion shows were that all applicants for foster care or adoption be 
carefully screened, and that children be prepared for the show and treated 
during it with understanding and sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to expose the child to a situation where there may be 
embarrassment and a big letdown. If the child is prepared in a sensitive 
manner, I guess it could work very well," Seader said.

DEAL TO SELL PTL NETWORK TO ORAL ROBERTS UNIV. TOLD

A court-appointed trustee says he will sell Jim Bakker's former satellite 
network to Oral Roberts University for $6 million at the end of the month 
unless he finds a buyer for the entire PTL complex. 
</P>
<P>
"I do have a firm deal with Oral Roberts University. 
</P>
<P>
However, in the contract, I expressly reserved the right to sell all the assets 
until the point of approval of the sale of just the network," the trustee, 
lawyer Dennis Shedd, said last week. 
</P>
<P>
The 500-acre Heritage USA Christian retreat founded by Bakker and 1,700 acres 
of undeveloped PTL land in South Carolina have been for sale along with PTL's 
broadcasting holdings since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Roberts ministry has been plagued by tight finances in the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Oral Roberts, a 72-year-old faith healer, closed his City of 
Faith hospital and medical school in Tulsa, Okla., and put his home and other 
ministry-owned property on the market to repay $25 million in debts. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts' son, Richard, said God told his father, "in what my dad believes is 
his last major charge from God, to create a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week 
global Christian, charismatic healing network." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Roberts said the university raised the $1 million down payment from 
longtime backers. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Swadener, chief financial officer for the ministries, said he thought the 
network could provide a vital source of revenue for the university. He called 
the plan to purchase the network "an act of faith." 
</P>
<P>
The ministry also was seeking guaranteed access to the airwaves at a time when 
secular networks are displacing evangelists on Sunday mornings in favor of news 
shows and cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
Bakker was convicted last fall of fraudulently raising $158 million from PTL 
contributors and is serving a 45-year prison sentence in a federal prison in 
Minnesota.

DELTA STUDY TO SEEK 'DECADE OF ACTION'

<P>
A federal commission that has studied the Mississippi Delta for 18 months will 
offer a formula for improvement in its report to Congress Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Lower Mississippi Delta Development Commission will call for greater 
regional cooperation through environmental compacts and university research 
programs, extra efforts to steer pupils toward college, "leadership training" 
to dispel 19th-Century attitudes that have held the Delta back, and further 
government aid. 
</P>
<P>
While emphasizing that more help from the federal government is needed, Govs. 
Bill Clinton of Arkansas, Buddy Roemer of Louisiana and Ray Mabus of 
Mississippi, all members of the commission, said they won't be asking for a 
quick fix or a vast, New Deal sort of program. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is a peace dividend . . . you want to invest in America. Why not 
start here?" Roemer asked. 
</P>
<P>
"The work of this commission is not about handouts, though. It's about giving 
choices and some options to people who too often feel they have none," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Wilbur Hawkins, the federal commission's executive director: "We bail out 
the savings and loans; we send millions to Poland and to Panama. I just don't 
want this nation, for the first time in its history, to say we can't help the 
unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
The Memphis-based commission has not escaped controversy. Black leaders noted 
angrily that all nine of its appointed members are white men, even though a 
third of the Delta population is black. (Director Hawkins, hired after the 
uproar, is black.) 
</P>
<P>
The commission has spent $3 million on its study. The panel is modeled after 
past federal bodies formed to deal with regional problems, such as the 
Tennessee Valley Authority and the Appalachian Regional Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Clinton, the commission chairman, said he believes the report to be released 
Monday will be unique in government. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a handbook for a decade of action," he said. "We want a report that 
says what the national government is supposed to do, what the state governments 
are supposed to do, the local governments and private sector." 
</P>
<P>
Tourism is one resource the commission hopes to help develop, officials said. 
Marketing will be another; some commissioners hope for Common Market-type 
cooperation among the states, and perhaps even a trademark and promotional 
campaign for Delta products. 
</P>
<P>
"People on Wall Street see more attractive investments in Venezuela than in the 
Mississippi Delta, and that's a marketing problem," said Stan Hyland, a Memphis 
State University anthropologist working on the commission staff. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to put in place incentives to bring our youth back home, and our 
capital back home," Hawkins said. "We can't afford to take just a Band-Aid 
approach."

Signs with skulls and crossbones are posted now in Devil's Swamp, but nothing 
warned Barbara Dixon's husband of the dangers when he hunted and fished there 
in 1986, bringing home the bounty of this "Sportsman's Paradise." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Dixon loved the crawfish, the catfish and the rabbits, and ate them all 
while pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
At age 3 weeks, her daughter began having seizures. Before her first birthday, 
tiny Emily was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a rare cancer on her spinal cord. 
Before her fourth birthday, she had endured chemotherapy and three operations. 
</P>
<P>
But Emily Dixon is one of the luckier victims in what locals call the "cancer 
corridor" for its concentration of chemical companies. She survived, and is 
considered 90% cured. 
</P>
<P>
There's no doubt in her mother's mind the chemical companies are to blame.

"It's easy to say they are ruining our water and doing this and that, and it's 
no big deal. But when you're ruining our children, that's something else," 
Barbara Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
Across the Mississippi Delta region, which includes parts of Arkansas, 
Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee, health and 
environmental problems are intertwined, and troubles abound. 
</P>
<P>
They hit hardest, it seems, at those most vulnerable: the 3 million children of 
the Delta. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Lingafelter runs a Mississippi program called Partners for Improved 
Nutrition and Health, which uses techniques developed in the Third World to 
fight the Third World conditions sometimes seen in the Delta. 
</P>
<P>
He sees progress since the days, only 25 years ago, of "Biafra-style 
malnutrition." And yet, "in the face of what has not yet been done," he called 
the Delta "a national tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
Death rates in many counties by the river are higher than the national average. 
Along Louisiana's chemical-producing region, cancer rates are higher than would 
normally be expected, though scientists have yet to establish a direct cause. 
</P>
<P>
Poverty, teen-age motherhood and poor nutrition, along with shortages of 
doctors and nurses, exact a toll on health, exacerbated by lax environmental 
laws and the heavy use of agricultural pesticides and other chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has a national infant mortality rate of 10.7 per 1,000 live 
births; in the Delta, the rate is 12.5. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Humphreys County, Miss., has had one of the highest infant mortality 
rates in the world -- higher than Malaysia, French Guiana and other 
less-developed nations. Eight infants died in 1988, giving the county a rate of 
33.2. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't really know why," said Lou Anne McLendon, the county's public health 
nurse, who runs a clinic offering prenatal care and nutrition. But most of the 
mothers whose infants died did not take advantage of the prenatal care offered, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
One-third of the babies delivered last year were born to teen-agers, including 
59 to mothers 13 and 14 years old, according to Dr. Alfio Rausa, a Greenwood, 
Miss., physician who oversees the Delta district for the state health 
department. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of it is lack of education. No hope, no recreation," Rausa said. "The 
family structure has broken down." 
</P>
<P>
Lake County, Tenn., population about 7,500, has only one doctor, who runs a 
clinic and serves as director of the health department, assistant director of 
the nursing home and county medical examiner. 
</P>
<P>
"Should an emergency, such as cardiac arrest (or) multiple trauma occur, the 
chances of survival in Lake County are approximately zero," Dr. Renee Lamb said 
at a public hearing before the Lower Mississippi Delta Development Commission. 
</P>
<P>
In many parts of the Delta, residents believe the polluted environment is as 
much a culprit for their ills as inadequate care. 
</P>
<P>
They point to the dozens of sprawling, shiny manufacturing plants tucked in the 
swampy Delta amid moss-covered trees -- plants that spew chemicals, including 
known carcinogens, into the air and water. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana ranked 48th in an environmental health survey released in April by 
the Durham, N.C.-based Institute for Southern Studies. It was no surprise to 
those who live here. 
</P>
<P>
"For decades the South, Louisiana, has taken its environment for granted," 
Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer said. "We had to hustle so hard for jobs, people 
just gave up their environmental considerations." 
</P>
<P>
The Mississippi River not only provides drainage for two-thirds of the nation, 
but also is a disposal route for tons of chemicals and pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
The river carries 213 million pounds of toxic chemicals through New Orleans 
each year, according to a 2-year study by the environmental group Greenpeace. 
</P>
<P>
Teresa Robert, who lives near the river in the middle of the so-called "cancer 
corridor," remembers swimming in the river as a child almost 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I would not think of sticking my foot in it," said Robert, who formed an 
environmental group that blocked a planned waste dump in Ascension Parish. The 
parish already is home to three of Louisiana's 11 Superfund sites targeted by 
the federal Environmental Protection Agency for cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
Pharmacist Kay Gaudet in nearby St. Gabriel can chart her town's health through 
the drugs she dispenses. In a 9-month period in 1986, Gaudet discovered that 
the second most commonly prescribed drug was for breast cancer. Only this year 
has that drug made it into the top 200 drugs used nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question in my mind what causes it, but if you try to find a 
smoking gun, it's going to be impossible," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Louisiana Chemical Assn., the trade group for the state's largest industry, 
insists that its products are not responsible for the high cancer rates. 
Residents' penchant for spicy food, rich living, smoking and other factors all 
play a part, the group says. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Richard Kleiner added, however, that the chemical companies know they 
have "a lot of problems of the past to correct." 
</P>
<P>
St. Jude's Hospital, an international center specializing in children's cancer, 
ended up in Memphis, Tenn., in part because of the health problems of the 
children of the region. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana parents gather in support groups there and shake their heads in 
disbelief at their numbers in the waiting rooms. 
</P>
<P>
But Dr. Elizabeth Thompson, St. Jude's physician-in-chief, said researchers 
there, like others, have been unable to find a link between the chemical 
discharges and the high incidence of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Dixon says she doesn't need proof. She brings Emily to testify in 
support of environmental bills, hoping lawmakers will reverse concessions to 
the chemical industry and tighten pollution controls. 
</P>
<P>
She says she doesn't want the plants to close because too many people depend on 
the jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"I want them to be responsible," Barbara Dixon said. "I want them to stop 
saying the cost is too much to control our air quality or our water quality. 
</P>
<P>
"What is the cost of my child's life?"

RADIATION DETECTOR AT LANDFILL MAKES HOSPITAL ALTER PRACTICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA ROACH MONROE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It all began on a sunny afternoon last September, as a garbage truck drove into 
the city's Miramar landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Before dumping that load Sept. 20, the Laidlaw Waste Systems driver had to take 
the truck past a radiation monitor, the radiological equivalent of an airport 
metal detector. Drivers do it dozens of times every day without incident. 
</P>
<P>
But this time the detector began beeping and a warning light flashed. Something 
in this load was radioactive. 
</P>
<P>
The same thing happened with another garbage truck at the landfill on Dec. 6. 
</P>
<P>
The discoveries set in motion a chain of events that culminated March 2 in a 
state order that Sharp Memorial Hospital stop performing radioactive implants 
because of two incidents in which radioactive iridium-192 was thrown out with 
normal trash. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital has since revamped its radiation-safety procedures with the help 
of a consultant, hired new staff and applied for a revised license. The 
inspector who cited the hospital says he is confident Sharp is cleaning up its 
act. 
</P>
<P>
But what happened at Sharp could happen at any institution where personnel 
turnover and a heavy workload combine to make "doing it by the book" 
impossible, said the inspector, Frank O. Bold. 
</P>
<P>
"The license is issued for a period of seven years. Over the years, if the new 
personnel don't sit down and immediately read the entire license, then they 
really don't know what needs to be done," said Bold, a health physicist who 
spent 26 years in charge of radiation safety at General Atomics. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the responsibility of the radiation-safety committee to make sure that 
everything is going as it should. But like everything else, when you have busy 
people, those things fall through the cracks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last few years, Sharp has been a model in the San Diego medical 
community of a nationwide trend toward a bottom-line approach to hospital 
staffing. 
</P>
<P>
Since patient-care positions cannot be trimmed much, this has meant eliminating 
many middle managers and consolidating multiple responsibilities under the few 
managers left. 
</P>
<P>
"Hospitals are looking to reduce the layers of management, to cut through the 
bureaucracy. It's a real trend in the industry," said Jan Frates, a hospital 
consultant in San Diego. "So they're often eliminating multiple checks and 
balances. Fewer people have to do the same amount of work." 
</P>
<P>
But the rules for assuring radiation safety are complicated and require close 
attention. With the Sharp staff new or very busy, it was easy for basic 
radiation-safety precautions to be ignored, Bold said. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp itself said in a written response to Bold that "a turnover of personnel 
and associated lack of continuity" were among the more important contributors 
to the problems he uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
State law calls for inspections every three years, with a grace period of up to 
1 1/2 years beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
The grace period on Sharp's license, issued in April, 1985, was about to expire 
when the first iridium incident occurred, Bold said. An inspection backlog was 
created, he said, when the county took over enforcement of radiation-safety 
laws from the state in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes to reach a three-year cycle on hospital inspections within the 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ronald S. Scott, the doctor whose work with radioactive iridium-192 at 
Sharp was halted by the state action against the hospital, thinks it is the 
regulators who are at fault for lax radiation-safety procedures. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were to apply for a license to set up a little operating room in my 
office (to do radioactive implants), the state would spend from now to the year 
2000 getting around to approving every little tiny detail," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
"But with an outfit like Sharp, it's a big hospital, it's got credentials -- so 
the state says OK, you can do implants without checking very carefully that (it 
has) a really ironclad safety system in place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But in state documents, Scott receives some of the blame for the Sharp 
radioactivity incidents. 
</P>
<P>
In the first incident, five tiny "seeds" of iridium-192, shrink-wrapped 
together in a plastic strip, were in the trash truck. After checking the 
manifest, Bold concluded that the iridium came from Scott's office. Scott says 
it was accidentally discarded during office remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
And, although Scott contends the seeds had very little radioactivity in them, a 
report from the supplier indicates they contained eight times as much 
radioactivity as Scott said in a report he gave to Sharp. 
</P>
<P>
The first investigation was fairly straightforward and took about a week. But 
tracing the second strip of seeds, 10 of them this time, took two months. The 
strip apparently had been included in linen sent from the hospital to 
California Linen Supply, and discarded when it was found there. 
</P>
<P>
In both cases, the amount of radioactivity was so small that there was no 
danger to public health, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
The citations against the hospital noted problems with handling of radioactive 
materials both by Scott and the hospital: 
</P>
<P>
* Deliveries were made to the main hospital receiving dock, rather than to the 
nuclear medicine department. 
</P>
<P>
* Scott was allowed to order radioactive materials on the hospital's license. 
</P>
<P>
* Scott and the hospital failed to maintain accurate and complete written 
records on the materials. (For instance, on Sept. 21 Sharp returned 665 
millicuries of iridium to the supplier -- but was licensed to have only 500.) 
</P>
<P>
* The individual designated in the license as custodian of the iridium-192 no 
longer worked at Sharp. 
</P>
<P>
* Records of deliveries and returns of iridium-192 and other "sealed sources" 
of radiation were not kept. 
</P>
<P>
* Iridium-192 seeds removed from a cancer patient last Nov. 20 were not 
counted. (Scott contends he did count them, but says he missed the fact that he 
was 10 short.) 
</P>
<P>
* Linens from the room used in that procedure were not monitored for 
radioactivity before being sent for laundering. 
</P>
<P>
An inspection also found a series of other problems, from lack of training of 
employees in radiation safety to the use of inappropriate instruments for 
radiation monitoring. Radioactive materials were being sent to another hospital 
without license authority, it was found. 
</P>
<P>
Explanations from Scott and the hospital, sent to Bold, detail a series of 
wrong assumptions by both parties. 
</P>
<P>
Scott said he assumed he bought a radioactive-materials license along with the 
medical practice he acquired in February, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
When Scott ordered iridium seeds sent to Sharp under the hospital's license, 
"there was confusion at the hospital receiving point," he said. Scott said that 
at the urging of Robert Cook, radiology administrator at the time, he arranged 
to have the iridium sent to his office instead. 
</P>
<P>
When the shipments to the hospital stopped, "the Radiology Department assumed 
Dr. Scott had received his own license and was ordering from it," the 
hospital's Oct. 17 response to Bold says. 
</P>
<P>
Bold said inspections at other hospitals have not revealed problems as serious 
as those found at Sharp. 
</P>
<P>
In four years in charge of radiological inspections for the county, Bold said, 
he has been called to a landfill half a dozen times because of radioactive 
trash. Before the Sharp incidents, none involved institutional problems. 
</P>
<P>
Once, the trash contained a diaper from a child who had undergone a radioactive 
diagnostic test, he said. Another time someone who had undergone such a test 
discarded tissue used to wipe up after being sick. 
</P>
<P>
If there was anyone pleased by the iridium incidents it was Robert Epler, 
deputy waste management director for the city of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Epler takes pride in the fact that radiation monitors at the only city-run 
landfill -- and the only landfill equipped with monitors -- could detect a 
minuscule bit of iridium-192 inside a 37-cubic-yard capacity truck. 
</P>
<P>
The five small seeds of iridium found there in September, and the 10 found in 
December, are described by Scott as 6 millimeters long and a half-millimeter in 
diameter, smaller than a grain of rice. 
</P>
<P>
Radiation monitors were placed at entry points to the Miramar landfill several 
years ago to prevent dumping of radioactive waste, he said. At the same time, 
landfill employees learned to call the county's hazardous waste response team 
when a monitor beeps. 
</P>
<P>
Those iridium seeds "weren't found by happenstance. I felt so proud," Epler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
If the seeds had been in trash sent to any of San Diego County's five other 
landfills, however, they would have stayed there. None have radiation monitors, 
said Jeff Bosvay, a sanitarian with the county Department of Public Works.

<P>
MEASURE PROVIDES $150 MILLION TO HOUSE HOMELESS 
</P>

<P>
Proposition 107, which would provide $150 million to help house the homeless 
and other low-income people, was born more than two years ago at a meeting 
between Gov. George Deukmejian and legislative leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Like so many major decisions in the Capitol, the question of how much to spend 
on housing for the poor was settled by top political figures meeting behind 
closed doors, not in a public forum. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican and Democratic decision-makers sorted through bond proposals and 
determined which ought to go to the voters and how much money should be sought 
for each. 
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) went into the meeting 
with a proposal to spend $850 million on the problem of homelessness. 
Deukmejian, on the other hand, wanted even more to fix and expand the state's 
crumbling system of highways. 
</P>
<P>
In the final agreement, Deukmejian won a place on the ballot for a $1-billion 
transportation bond measure, which later went down to defeat by just 545 votes 
out of nearly 5.3 million cast. 
</P>
<P>
But Roberti, along with Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), got 
the support of the Republican governor and GOP legislative leaders to place 
three housing measures totaling $600 million before voters over the next two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The first two measures, Propositions 77 and 84, won easy voter approval in 
1988. The third part of the package is Proposition 107 on the June 5 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti argues that the state must step in to help low-income people find 
decent housing because traditional federal support has dried up in the last 
decade. "Part of the problem of homelessness is that there haven't been any 
programs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 107 would mean $100 million for an estimated 2,371 low-rent 
apartments, $25 million for 1,875 low-income, first-time home buyers, $15 
million to buy and restore 1,000 residential hotel units, and $10 million to 
add 9,506 additional beds in emergency shelters for the homeless, according to 
the Senate Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds would be paid off over 20 years at a total cost to taxpayers of $295 
million, according to the nonpartisan legislative analyst's office. 
</P>
<P>
Despite agreement among leaders of both parties and Deukmejian, several 
Republican lawmakers oppose Proposition 107, just as they opposed the two 1988 
bond measures. 
</P>
<P>
These avowed conservatives argue that government cannot solve the state's 
housing crisis and that state and local governments have been largely 
responsible for a sharp rise in the cost of homes and apartments. 
</P>
<P>
"As a philosophical principal, government should not be in the housing 
business," said Sen. Bill Leonard (R-Big Bear). "Most of the housing problems 
are actually caused by government," he said, citing restrictive zoning 
requirements and building standards that he believes are largely responsibile 
for an escalation of housing costs. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an elitist, exclusive attitude in some communities," Leonard said. 
People are too sophisticated to say openly that "we've got our home, we don't 
want others in," Leonard said. Instead they respond by increasing lot size and 
setbacks, and by tightening health and safety requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard, once a landlord himself, said that the poorest tenants, given a choice 
between a leaking roof or no roof, will choose a roof that leaks. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmaker contends that unshackling the housing industry by eliminating 
restrictions would increase the supply of housing and bring down prices. 
</P>
<P>
But Roberti has little patience with Leonard's argument. "He's giving a 
philosophical answer to a pragmatic problem," Roberti said. "If people are 
without shelter, you build shelters. You don't have to have a political science 
course to know that." 
</P>
<P>
Among lawmakers, Roberti is the acknowledged leader in efforts to attack the 
state's housing crisis. "This is my big issue," he said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
"I live near Griffith Park," Roberti said. "When I go home every week, I see 
unfortunate women pushing their carts into the park. It's for real. We've got 
to do something about it. It's a scandal. We have people who don't have homes." 
</P>
<P>
"In Los Angeles County, 1,800 people a night are turned away from shelters," 
Roberti said. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is Roberti helping housing advocates raise money for a Proposition 107 
campaign, he also is carrying a bill that would ask voters to approve an 
additional $165 million in bonds for rental housing and emergency shelters in 
the November election. 
</P>
<P>
Even if both Proposition 107 and the new measure are ultimately approved by 
voters, Roberti acknowledged that these bond issues will not eliminate the 
problem. And he worries that voters might not continue to support even what he 
regards as modest steps toward dealing with housing problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a built-in aversion toward spending money on people who are not an 
integrated part of society," he said. "That's what we have to overcome. That's 
never a small feat." 
</P>
<P>
Although arguments in favor of Proposition 107 in the official state ballot 
pamphlet focus on taking care of the homeless -- just $10 million out of the 
$150 million would go directly to expanding the number of spaces available at 
emergency homeless shelters in the state. 
</P>
<P>
But backers of the measure say that the rest of the money -- much of it 
earmarked for building low-cost rental housing and rehabilitating residential 
hotels -- will have an impact on the problems of homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
"Providing temporary shelter for someone who is homeless, if you think about it 
for a moment, is not the long-term response to the problem," said Marc Brown, a 
lobbyist for the California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is a broken bridge upstream and people are falling through into the 
water, the immediate response is to help those poor people in the stream who 
are drowning -- to pull them out, clothe them and give them hot food," Brown 
said. "But you need to fix the bridge upstream, to look beyond the emergency 
needs." 
</P>
<P>
In their official opposition arguments in the ballot pamphlet, Leonard and 
Assemblyman Phillip Wyman (R-Tehachapi) point out that relatively little of the 
$450 million from the two 1988 ballot measures has been spent. 
</P>
<P>
However, Brown said that all of the money from Propositions 77 and 84 will be 
either spent or committed by next January. 
</P>
<P>
He contended that a great deal more government assistance will be needed even 
if 107 passes. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just a platform on which to build," he said. "It's not going to be the 
solution to homelessness. We're looking at probably years of bonds on the 
ballot before we can declare the war is won." 
</P>
<P>
Brown is treasurer for the Housing Opportunities Mobilization Political Action 
Committee, which he said has already raised $80,000 to run the campaign for 
Proposition 107. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest backers thus far are the California Assn. of Realtors and the 
Construction Industry Advance Fund. Each has pledged at least $20,000 to the 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Yes on 107 campaign have also prepared a series of television 
commercials and hope to raise an additional $200,000 to purchase broadcast time 
before the election. 
</P>
<P>
In the ads, such celebrities as comedian Bob Hope and Woody Harrelson of 
"Cheers" point out that as many as 250,000 Californians are homeless, including 
"single mothers with children, veterans, battered women, the mentally ill."

A Rancho Santa Fe couple returned from a European vacation to find that their 
luxury automobiles had been trashed. Vandals weren't to blame. Rats were. 
</P>
<P>
Their $70,000 Jaguar and two vintage Rolls Royces were dead, victims of the 
omnivorous jaws of rats that chewed up the wiring like spaghetti. It took 
$50,000 in repairs to get the three automobiles running again. 
</P>
<P>
In San Marcos, an 80-year-old woman lived in terror of rats that had invaded 
her mobile home. She treated the invaders like honored guests, putting out food 
at one end of her trailer in hopes the rats would leave her alone at the other 
end of the confined space. But the rodents took over, even invading the oven 
where she had hidden her eggs. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the worst infestation of rats I had ever seen," said Patricia Cawthon, 
a vector control supervisor for the county. "They had taken over." 
</P>
<P>
Rats can scamper along a wire only 1/64th of an inch thick. They can swim and 
tread water for two days. They can squeeze through openings only half an inch 
wide. They can jump 4 feet horizontally and 3 feet vertically. And they have 
few enemies except man. 
</P>
<P>
They are gourmet eaters, preferring escargot (snails), macadamia nuts, 
chocolates and avocados. They also desire citrus fruits, often sampling oranges 
by eating them at the peak of ripeness, still on the tree. 
</P>
<P>
They are the prime prey of county vector control workers who are now traveling 
throughout the county responding to citizen complaints about the unpleasant and 
unwanted invaders. 
</P>
<P>
California roof rats are the most numerous of the rat species found in San 
Diego County and, unlike their Norway rat cousins found mainly on the East 
Coast, roof rats gravitate to affluent neighborhoods where food is plentiful 
and predators are few. There, in the lush landscape of Rancho Bernardo or 
seaside La Jolla, they breed and prosper without the interference of their 
natural enemies -- coyotes, owls and hawks. 
</P>
<P>
They prefer to live up high, in attics or leafy bowers, rather than in dank, 
dark holes in the ground. And, they can do thousands of dollars in damage with 
their sharp teeth, even starting fires when they nibble at wiring insulation. 
</P>
<P>
Roof rats and their fleas also spread dozens of diseases, including bubonic 
plague. 
</P>
<P>
For almost a year now, since July 1 when city councils in all 18 cities and the 
county Board of Supervisors approved an assessment to fund the program, vector 
control workers have had the authority to carry on their war against the roof 
rat and other varmints that carry and transmit diseases that afflict humans. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, county abatement of roaches, rats, mice, skunks, bats, opossums, 
etc., was limited to the cities of San Diego and Coronado and the tidelands 
controlled by the Unified Port District, because those were the only entities 
paying for the service. 
</P>
<P>
Cawthon, vector control supervisor, acknowledges that the first year of 
countywide vector eradication "has been pretty wild," and believes that it will 
only get wilder as more San Diegans realize what vectors are and what services 
they can get from the county free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
The county agency now responds to citizen complaints, does free inspections, 
makes recommendations on how to control the problem, and even provides the 
information and the pesticides or traps needed to end the problem. 
</P>
<P>
With roof rats, the service does not end with solving the problems of a single 
householder, Cawthon said. "We spread out through the neighborhood, informing 
neighbors of the problem and offering to help," she said. "Rats are a 
neighborhood problem." 
</P>
<P>
Cawthon also participates in an educational program, training people in 
sensitive city positions what to do when an anguished caller asks for aid in 
rodent control after hearing what sounded like a herd of elephants galloping 
across his or her roof the night before. 
</P>
<P>
Rats are prime suspects in about one-third of the house fires labeled as 
"undetermined origin," she said. The statistic is one supplied by insurance 
adjusters and investigators. 
</P>
<P>
They chew through almost anything, including washer and dryer hoses, car wiring 
and upholstery, electrical cables and the like, she said. Rats can even chew 
through a lead pipe, although they seldom do, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Although vector control is a deadly serious business, there is a lighter side, 
Cawthon said. She and her workers often hear homeowners flatly deny that they 
could be harboring rats in the household "because we have a cat." 
</P>
<P>
Cawthon then asks politely, "Do you feed your cat?" The response is usually a 
look of disbelief and an affirmative nod. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I tell them that a cat that is fed will not hunt rats or mice," she said. 
"In the early days, farmers didn't feed their cats. The cats were forced to 
earn their keep," by ridding the barnyard of creatures that contaminate the 
grain. 
</P>
<P>
Rats defecate 50 to 75 times a day, she explained, "and that's a lot of 
contamination. They often urinate when startled, and we can trace their 
activities by using a 'black light' that picks up their urine trails." 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Rodeos, a veteran vector control officer, remembers a time last 
year when he visited a home in Leucadia. He lifted the opening to the attic 
crawl space and a rat fell down into the hallway. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that roof rats, some Norway rats and even wood rats or pack rats 
infest most of San Diego County, living off the fat of the land and the 
unwitting largess of homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
One woman called vector control officers out to her home at mid-day to show 
them the usually nocturnal rodents had adapted to human schedules. 
</P>
<P>
She put out dry dog food, and, within minutes, a bevy of rodents had converged 
on the bowl to gorge on the food. 
</P>
<P>
Cawthon and her vector control crews sometimes carry a caged rat with them when 
they are making educational talks because, she said, "one live rat is worth a 
thousand words. 
</P>
<P>
"And it also puts things back into perspective. Many people are afraid of rats, 
and they grow to think of them as the size of dogs or even elephants." 
</P>
<P>
Before the county vector control program went countywide, most property owners 
called in private exterminators to rid them of rats and other pests. Now, for a 
modest fee that appears automatically on property tax bills, any county 
resident can call in the county vector control teams to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
The cost averages $3.80 a year for residences and ranges from a low of $1.55 
for a vacant lot to a high of $19 a year for large commercial complexes. That 
seems formidable competition for private firms but Ken Field, entomologist with 
Lloyd Pest Control, said there are enough rats and other varmints to go around. 
</P>
<P>
"Our business has not dropped off," Field said of the period since the county 
began its vector control service countywide. "Actually, we have called them in 
on some of our jobs where there is outside work to be done. They concentrate on 
the exterior of buildings, and we concentrate on the interiors." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Field said, there are still plenty of fleas and ants and termites and 
other bugs that do not pose health risks to humans but certainly do not make 
good house guests and keep private pest control companies in business. 
</P>
<P>
Cawthon agrees that both private and public agencies have a place in the 
extermination business but points out that private firms do not have authority 
to place poisons outside a building, nor can they teach homeowners the 
do-it-yourself extermination measures that vector control agents do. 
</P>
<P>
The county vector control division, which has swelled in numbers since its 
territory expanded, offers free advice, materials and hands-on demonstration on 
how to eradicate any varmint or bug which transmits disease to humans, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cawthon would criticize only one feature of the county agency, its name. 
</P>
<P>
"People just don't know what vectors are. We should list ourselves in the 
telephone book as 'rat exterminators' or 'pest control' so people would know 
what we are and that the service is available to them," she said. 
</P>

What did I ever do to Tony Perry? 
</P>
<P>
Each week I have come to expect a new "hit" in his "San Diego at Large" column. 
</P>
<P>
City Hall regulars assured me that Tony's critiques were simply a result of my 
disagreements with Mayor O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
Although I have mended fences with Mayor O'Connor, my problems with Tony Perry 
remain! 
</P>
<P>
For example, Tony's May 7 column described the big "flip-flop" on the minds of 
all San Diegans: After criticizing the neon El Cajon Boulevard sign during his 
campaign, Hartley puts a photo of the sign up at his office! 
</P>
<P>
If he would contact me on these matters, I would be glad to set him straight. 
</P>
<P>
I criticized the sign because it was not designed or placed in accordance with 
community wishes. I also questioned whether the sign represented the most 
pressing needs of a community ridden with street violence and gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
I feel the same way today. 
</P>
<P>
The photo of the sign was ordered by my predecessor, prior to my swearing-in. 
The photo was not placed in my office; it is in the hallway outside my office! 
I did not choose the photo to decorate the hall with; the deputy mayor handles 
the hall-decorating responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike council members, Tony Perry apparently enjoys the ability to work 
without accountability to anyone for the quality of the product. 
</P>
<P>
I offer Tony Perry the same deal I made with the mayor. Let's disagree 
agreeably. I'll do my job and expect you to do yours. When I make a mistake -- 
nail me. But let's keep it above the belt! 
</P>
<P>
JOHN HARTLEY

San Diego City Councilman

Editor's note: Perry did contact Hartley's office before the item appeared, but 
his telephone call was not returned.

IF ROUNDUP POLICY EXISTS, IT SHOULDN'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A disturbing development in the current trial of two San Diego police officers 
was testimony last week from seven of their colleagues about an informal policy 
known among police as "Greyhound therapy." 
</P>
<P>
Allegedly condoned by the police high command, this approach to what ails 
downtown calls for officers to routinely clear transients from the streets in 
department vehicles, ferrying them to less populated parts of the city as dawn 
-- and the arrival of the work force -- approaches. 
</P>
<P>
Patrolmen Lloyd J. Hoff Jr. and Richard P. Schaaf, charged with kidnaping three 
undocumented workers last August and robbing two of them, claim as part of 
their defense that they were simply participating in the longstanding practice. 
Their guilt or innocence is for the jury to decide. 
</P>
<P>
But, if there is even an informal police policy of detaining transients without 
probable cause that they committed a crime, Chief Bob Burgreen should put a 
stop to it now. It is not illegal to be homeless or on the streets downtown 
before dawn. The police are well aware of this: The department's own conduct 
manual prohibits such roundups. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen and other top police officials have so far refused to comment on the 
officers' testimony. The chief should waste no time issuing a directive to his 
employees halting "Greyhound therapy" and leave public policy decisions about 
downtown's homeless to elected officials.

REFLECTIONS: 'THERE'S ALWAYS THAT SPECIAL PATIENT THAT GIVES YOU THAT GOOD 
FEELING AFTER YOU'VE GIVEN CARE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. Jeanette Avent, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lorene Schwartz, 58, graduated in 1953. Her son Kent, 25, finished school last 
May. What bonds the mother and son as much as family is a common profession. 
They are both registered nurses in Grossmont Hospital's emergency room. The 
team was interviewed by Times staff writer G. Jeanette Avent and photographed 
by David McNew. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kent: I first went to Colorado State University on a football scholarship. As 
far back as when I was 7 years old, I've always wanted to play football. In 
high school, I always thought I'd go into biology or oceanography, but football 
was the main thing. But I decided to dump the scholarship and come back to San 
Diego, because I wanted more academics. I came back here thinking I'd pick up 
another scholarship, but I injured my knee playing touch football. So that 
ended that. 
</P>
<P>
Then I got into nursing at Grossmont College. I didn't have any idea when I was 
growing up I'd be in nursing, but I was always aware of it. My mom was working 
here at Grossmont while she was pregnant with me. She'd work nights and come 
home and make us breakfast. She put in a lot of hours in addition to being in 
the PTA and room mother. 
</P>
<P>
I started here last June as a registered nurse. I work from 7 at night to 7 in 
the morning, and mom works from 3 a.m. to 3 p.m. About two days every two weeks 
we have about a four-hour lap-over. We vent our frustrations with each other. 
</P>
<P>
Lorene: The interesting cases we do talk about at home. It's nice when you can 
talk with someone who understands what you're saying. 
</P>
<P>
Kent: The doctors are great. They don't treat us like a lower class at all. But 
there's always a high quantity of people going through the emergency room and a 
chronic shortage of nurses. That's a national problem. Because of that, we just 
don't get to spend the time we'd like with each patient. You just go and do a 
treatment on a patient and then go to another patient. We don't have enough 
time to put in the caring that we'd like to. It's just there are more people, a 
greater population to deal with than there used to be. 
</P>
<P>
Lorene: I recently read that more girls are now going into medicine than 
nursing. When I was growing up, a woman had two career choices: nursing or 
school teaching. 
</P>
<P>
Kent: Guys are trying to get over the stereotype that nursing is associated 
with females and nice little white caps. Almost every time when I go up to a 
patient, they always ask me, "Are you a doctor?" I answer no. Some are 
surprised, some aren't. More men are getting into the field now. 
</P>
<P>
The best part of the job is the camaraderie among the nurses, and there's 
always that special patient that gives you that good feeling after you've given 
care. You don't necessarily have to save their life or anything, but there's 
always the really nice or happy patient, someone who says thanks. 
</P>
<P>
But we rotate from station to station in the emergency room, so you never have 
a certain type of patient every night. One night you may be dealing mostly with 
lacerations and pediatric patients. Sometimes you have people with abdominal or 
chest pains. 
</P>
<P>
Lorene: I love kids because I worked in pediatrics before I worked in the 
emergency room. But I like all age groups. With very ill people, there's the 
challenge of helping diagnose what's wrong. With a headache, you have to 
determine if it's a migraine or a cranial bleed. You have to determine whether 
you should go grab that doctor and tell them to get over to a patient right now 
or if they can wait their turn to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
Kent: With the more acute patients, you have to hang multiple drips and 
multiple IVs. Certain medications give some pretty hairy side effects 
sometimes, so you have to watch for them and really monitor the patient almost 
one-on-one, sometimes two nurses with one patient. Time really is a factor. You 
just want to treat them and get them upstairs (into recovery.) 
</P>
<P>
Lorene: That's probably why so many patients make it. You keep thinking, I 
don't want them to die on me on my shift. Way back when I graduated (from 
nursing school) in 1953, there was no such thing as a nurse starting an IV. So 
many things were done only by doctors. There were no such things as 
intensive-care units. I worked in the operating room and there were no recovery 
rooms. We probably did more what LVNs and nurse's aides do now. 
</P>
<P>
Kent: My future plans really depend on how nursing goes and the pay scale. But 
there are so many different things you can do in nursing that it really is a 
good career. You can go into home health care, administration and to different 
floors of a hospital such as orthopedics or the intensive-care unit. I'm happy 
in the emergency room for now. I like the variety. You don't have the same 
types of patients every day. 
</P>
<P>
Lorene: I've gotten a couple of good comments that we work well together and 
don't step on each other's territory. When he first started, I didn't let too 
many know he was my son, because I wanted him to make his own mark. 
</P>
<P>
When he first said he wanted to be a nurse, I wasn't too sure about encouraging 
him. I worried about the pay and the stereotype he'd have to overcome. But I 
thought, well, my parents let me make my own choices, and he should make his 
own choices, too. Seeing how he has done and how he's been accepted, I would 
recommend it to other mothers' sons.

FIVE MERCURY 7 SPACEMEN HELP OPEN HALL OF FAME

Five of the Mercury 7 astronauts, America's first and perhaps most beloved 
space explorers, returned to their history-making roots Friday to help dedicate 
the Astronaut Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't sit around getting nostalgic," said Donald (Deke) Slayton, now 66. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to make things happen for the future." 
</P>
<P>
The United States Astronaut Hall of Fame, 13 miles from where the men rocketed 
into history three decades ago, is a tribute to their exploits. 
</P>
<P>
There is an "umbilical" plug from the Freedom 7 spacecraft that carried Alan 
Shepard on a 15-minute suborbital flight in 1961, making him the first American 
in space. There is a chunk of the Atlas rocket that propelled John Glenn into 
space in 1962, America's first manned orbital mission. 
</P>
<P>
There is Walter Schirra's Mercury spacecraft, the late Virgil (Gus) Grissom's 
spacesuit, L. Gordon Cooper's spacecraft heat shield, Malcolm Scott Carpenter's 
camera with which he photographed Earth, and Slayton's food tubes from the 1975 
Apollo-Soyuz mission.

COUNTY RESIDENTS ARE FORTUNATE TO HAVE A UCI MEDICAL CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read your article (May 2) concerning the allegations by the state Medi-Cal 
administration that UCI (Medical Center) is not scheduling Medi-Cal patients as 
rapidly as patients with other types of funding. 
</P>
<P>
I have no knowledge as to whether this is true. I do have strong feeling, 
though, on how UCI, on the whole, cares for the poor unfunded patients, 
including Medi-Cal, of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Since the sale of the Orange County hospital to the university system in 1976, 
UCI has been forced to perform as a "county hospital." Even though the indigent 
problem affects all hospitals in Orange County, UCI takes far more than its 
share. It has been doing this year after year and now is staggering from the 
tremendous financial losses that it sustains in caring for these patients. 
</P>
<P>
I have been an emergency physician here in Orange County for the past 16 years. 
I am constantly amazed that UCI can continue to give the excellent care to its 
patients that it does -- to all of its patients -- when so much of the care it 
gives goes unfunded. 
</P>
<P>
The reality is that UCI is not funded by our county government in the same way 
as other counties support their hospitals that do significant amounts of 
indigent care. To top it off, the state university system is allegedly now 
questioning its willingness to continue to help fund UCI's losses. 
</P>
<P>
From my experience with how UCI cares for it patients, I would guess that if 
there was some delay in the elective scheduling of surgical patients (I do not 
know that to be true), none of those patients sustained any ill consequences as 
a result. That is just not UCI's way of doing business. 
</P>
<P>
I also believe that the benefits that UCI gives the citizens of this county are 
immense, from the offering of the most specialized of services, such as its 
nationally known burn center and its excellent trauma center, to the offering 
of care to all of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
I believe there is no university hospital in California today that does more 
for the community it serves than UCI. We are very fortunate to have this superb 
facility in Orange County.

THE PROBLEMS AT FOOTHILL HIGH IN TUSTIN NEED TO BE RESOLVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Historically, teachers have been underpaid. The profession was dominated by 
women, who in prior years could be paid less for the same work. Times are 
changing with regard to women's ability to earn equal pay for equal jobs, but 
the teaching profession is still woefully behind in its salaries. 
</P>
<P>
No one will argue that the teaching profession is one of the finest and most 
honorable of the professions. Nor would anyone argue that it is one of the most 
important if we are to improve the standard of living of our nation. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin teachers want more money, and they deserve more money. 
</P>
<P>
The Foothill High School teachers are not assigning homework as part of a job 
action in protest of their no-contract situation. In other words, they 
theoretically teach the material, and the student is somehow supposed to learn 
the material without ever having to study outside the classroom or perform any 
repetitive reinforcement tasks. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers claim they will not give 120% in the classroom. No one has ever 
asked them to give 120% in the classroom. However, as long as they are in the 
classroom, we as parents and taxpayers deserve 100% effort, including the 
traditional assignment of homework in the form of outside research, outside 
reading, mathematics assignments, chemistry assignments, etc. 
</P>
<P>
The Foothill High School teachers are still collecting their wages for their 
"work" but yet are not willing to perform their "work." Since they are working 
without a contract and believe that wage negotiations are at a standstill, they 
have the option of going on strike. 
</P>
<P>
If they choose that option, they should go on strike and close the schools down 
completely. They should bring the district to its knees and force it to pay an 
adequate wage. 
</P>
<P>
If they are not willing to go on strike, then they must accept the wage the 
district is paying and perform their jobs as required or seek employment 
elsewhere.

Tustin Unified School District seems to have "Lost Sight of the Principle of 
the Thing" (Editorial, Orange County, May 4). The problems at Foothill High 
School need to be resolved, not suppressed. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill students come from homes where parent education levels are superior. 
Of 56 high schools in Orange County, only two (Corona del Mar and University) 
have a higher percentile rank in parent education. Only one (Corona del Mar) 
has a smaller percentage of parents who haven't finished high school. 
</P>
<P>
But California Assessment Program (CAP) test scores at Foothill are low by 
comparison. Average CAP scores are better in reading at 24 Orange County high 
schools, in writing at 10 high schools and in math at six high schools. The 
dropout rate and pupil attendance rate also need improvement. Fourteen high 
schools have a lower percentage of dropouts, and eight have a higher attendance 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem at Foothill is the number of seniors who take the Scholastic 
Aptitude Test (SAT) and get high scores. The percentage taking the SAT is 
larger at four high schools in Orange County. Average scores are better in the 
verbal section of the SAT at five high schools, and better in the math section 
at 10 high schools. 
</P>
<P>
This information comes from recent California Department of Education 
statistics printed by The Times (Orange County, Section U, Dec. 10). The facts 
indicate something is wrong at Foothill High School. If Tustin Unified School 
District will improve its vision, solutions can be found.

LET'S WORK TOGETHER ON HEALTH-CARE MATTERS

<TEXT>
<P>
Re "Laguna AIDS Refuge Cited" (May 3): I would like to commend Ahimsa and the 
staff for courageously providing care for persons with AIDS when other 
facilities make excuses for not doing so. 
</P>
<P>
Since Ahimsa opened its doors in November of 1988, I have personally visited 
the facility and found the environment to be clean and most of all staffed by 
incredibly caring individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Have you ever visited a convalescent home or other skilled-care facility? The 
smell of urine is often overwhelming; not so Ahimsa. The patients appeared well 
cared for and in good spirits. 
</P>
<P>
Providing quality care in this day and age is extremely expensive, and hiring 
good help is very difficult. Ask any acute-care hospital where wards are being 
closed because of the nursing shortage. Instead of attacking their efforts, it 
would behoove us to roll up our sleeves and ask what can we do to help Ahimsa 
provide quality care. 
</P>
<P>
We are in the midst of a health-care crisis not just related to AIDS. The 
medical needs of many residents are not being met; the Medi-Cal system is in 
disarray; the thousand points of light in Orange County are being stretched to 
their limits. 
</P>
<P>
Let's not waste our time and energy bad-mouthing people like Sharon Lucas and 
Ahimsa. Let's work together to solve these problems.

IRVINE CO. CAN SET PRICES AT WILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Irvine Co. Vice Chairman Ray Watson's primer on affordable housing in Orange 
County (May 6) had all the validity of a used-car salesman trying to sell us a 
lemon. 
</P>
<P>
Watson's solution to the exorbitant housing prices charged by developers in 
Orange County? "Build enough housing to meet the need and watch what 
old-fashioned competition will do to prices." 
</P>
<P>
Who are you kidding, Mr. Watson? According to your own article, Irvine has "a 
shortfall of 60,000 homes." Assuming that this dubious statistic is accurate, 
just how the heck do you expect our overtaxed infrastructure to handle the 
impact of all those people? 
</P>
<P>
In case you haven't noticed, we haven't enough water to satisfy our current 
needs. Our traffic system is at near-gridlock. How do you propose to pay for 
the huge increase in demand for municipal services? 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Watson blames the controlled-growth policies of the Irvine City Council for 
the high cost of housing. Gee, Mr. Watson, why don't you tell us how much it 
really costs the Irvine Co. to build one of those $300,00 homes? Why is a 
$100,000 house in Riverside three times more expensive in Irvine? 
</P>
<P>
The truth, Mr. Watson, is that more housing has been built in Irvine in the 
last five years than during any other period. Despite that growth, prices have 
skyrocketed because the Irvine Co.'s status in the community as a monopolistic 
landowner permits it to set the cost of housing at whatever it darn well 
pleases. And that growth, without the necessary municipal resources, has 
resulted in taxing our traffic, our public safety and our water supply. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine City Council has shown farsighted restraint in restricting growth 
until the funding and natural resources are available to support it.

CRUISE WASN'T JUST FOR FUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I really get irritated by statements like the one made by (the Irvine Co.'s 
Larry Thomas, May 7) when he said that they only invite supervisors' aides 
because "it's fun" to participate in yacht cruises, etc. 
</P>
<P>
If Thomas does it for fun, why didn't he invite me? Why didn't he give that 
money to the United Way, Girl Scouts or an old folks' home? Why didn't he 
sponsor some dancers at a Cinco de Mayo festival? 
</P>
<P>
Obviously because none of the aforementioned people are in a position to give 
something back. Thomas fully expects a reward, maybe not a tangible one, tit 
for tat, but a reward in some way, shape or form. 
</P>
<P>
The irritating part of it is that he expects people to believe him. Does he 
really think we are that stupid? 
</P>
<P>
Let's call it a bribe because that's all it is. A legal one perhaps, but a 
bribe nonetheless, and the results are the same as with an illegal bribe. You 
give me something, I'll give you something. 
</P>
<P>
When bribes are given to elected representatives or their staff, it's wrong, 
it's a circumvention of the elective process and it should be illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Either Thomas is very naive or he thinks I am very stupid. Either way, his 
statement was very irritating. Why doesn't he come out and say the truth. "We 
do it because it's good for business and we can get away with it."

DEFINING 'PRO-LIFE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with interest the frequent commentaries and letters concerning abortion 
published in your newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
On April 13, an Operation Rescue demonstration was held at Doctors Family 
Planning Clinic in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
As a pro-choice volunteer who took part in the clinic defense early that 
morning, and other mornings, I wish to make a few observations. 
</P>
<P>
The term pro-life is a misnomer when used to describe people who oppose legal 
abortion because it implies that they have a greater respect for life than 
those who support it. So-called pro-life people are, in effect, anti-choice. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-choice people are certainly as pro-life as anti-choice people. The 
difference is that they define the life in question as that of women who will 
die from illegal abortion and children who will die from abuse, whereas 
so-called "right-to-lifers" define it as the life of a fetus. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-choice people are not pro-abortion. They are for the right of the 
individual to make her own decision about abortion. They do not believe that 
decision should rest with the government or any religious organization. 
</P>
<P>
At the demonstration in Tustin, anti-choice people sang religious hymns, held 
up rosaries and were led by a priest in cassock and a minister in clerical 
collar. At the same time they were pushing clinic defenders, trying to dislodge 
them in order to prevent patients from receiving legal medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
By their own actions, anti-choice people show us their intention -- it is to 
impose on others their religious belief concerning abortion. That intention is 
the essence of this controversy.

STOP THE DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why should I have my leaky faucet fixed or put a brick in my toilet tank to 
save water? Around us, all over the hills, thousands of houses are being built. 
</P>
<P>
Think of the dishwashers, toilets, baths and sinks that will require gallons of 
water and they will have tons of garbage, and each home will have one or more 
cars to clog up the roads and pollute the air. 
</P>
<P>
All the beautiful grassy hills will be a thing of the past, and all the wild 
animals will die out. Development should be stopped now if it is not too late. 
In light of this, I have no incentive to save water.

FOR OPENERS, A STRANGE LAPSE OF MEMORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
MEDINAH, Ill. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Strange guy, this Curtis. Wins back-to-back U.S. Open championships and thrives 
on pressure, yet doesn't love reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Met the media horde gathered Tuesday at the site of the 1990 U.S. Open and said 
he'd played Medinah Country Club just once in his life, a just-for-fun outing 
last fall with some of the boys from GOLF magazine. Said he didn't remember any 
of the holes, particularly, or much else about it. 
</P>
<P>
"Shot 74," he said. "Think I lost a couple of dollars, too." 
</P>
<P>
What a coincidence this is: A guy with the same name wrote (and presumably 
reported) a first-person article for the June issue of the same magazine 
titled, "Monsters of Medinah." In it, that Curtis Strange analyzed in depth the 
five holes at the suburban Chicago venue that he predicted "will be key in 
deciding the U.S. Open champion." 
</P>
<P>
"Here's how the holes play," the introduction went on, "with some of my ideas 
(I can't give everything away) on how to conquer them -- or at least come away 
with par." 
</P>
<P>
That Curtis Strange sounds like a quick study. Bet he took a couple of bucks 
off those boys from GOLF, too. But wait, there's more. 
</P>
<P>
In another first-person story in the same issue -- "Medinah on My Mind" -- 
Strange said he's consumed with the idea of becoming the first man in 85 years 
to three-peat in golf's grandest test. 
</P>
<P>
Toward that end, he said he would shut off the phones at his home in Virginia 
for the month of June and wouldn't take calls at hotels on the road where he is 
playing in tournaments either. Imagine that. 
</P>
<P>
He also let slip that he will shoehorn in a practice round or two before 
tournament week begins by sneaking onto Medinah's exclusive grounds to practice 
some morning at the crack of dawn, "but I won't tell you when." 
</P>
<P>
"All this pre-Open stuff, the attention and everything, adds to the pressure a 
little bit, but once I hit that tee shot Thursday (June 14, the start of the 
Open), I'll be OK. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where I'm most comfortable. There, I'm in my office," he continued, 
breaking into a grin, "and I can shut all of you out." 
</P>
<P>
One gets the idea that he is awfully enamored of the big silver cup (not to 
mention the money) they give the U.S. Open champion every year. And that it is, 
having been lodged in his home for two years now, an integral part of the 
interior decorating scheme. 
</P>
<P>
It is a reassuring thing to take down from the shelf and look at and hold when 
the blinds are drawn, hefty, an immeasurable comfort to the one-time brilliant 
amateur who expected to set the golfing world on fire and spent a long time 
learning to strike the competitive match. 
</P>
<P>
Strange is said to be a funny, charitable man away from the course, but his 
concentration on it remains trance-like and he does not hesitate to run over 
over anybody -- photographers, officials or the occasional fan -- who crosses 
his tunnel vision. It may hurt his image, but it is the secret of his success. 
He needs focus, not more questions from reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Strange never forgets that he failed on his first run at the tour's 
qualifying school, that he failed on the first run he ever made in a regular 
PGA event, and then did it yet again in the first major tournament in which he 
was a legitimate contender. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, Strange started the final day of the Masters with a three-shot 
lead, went for the green of the par-5 13th in two and came up wet. Bernhard 
Langer won that year and many people -- most of all, those damned reporters -- 
said he might never recover. And now, every time that splash ripples through 
his memory, he can grab the large looping handles on the silver cup and keep 
himself from slipping under again. 
</P>
<P>
"You come out on the tour as a 21-year-old hotshot," Strange recalled in one of 
his more reflective moments Tuesday, "and you think you can do no wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"But after you're finished with your amateur career, you go from the top of the 
totem pole to the bottom. And it's a big blow to your self-esteem to find out 
you can't compete for everything like you did just a day earlier." 
</P>
<P>
He went two years on the tour before he won his first tournament, the Pensacola 
Open in 1979, and his game has refined itself ever since. Far from the longest 
player out there, Strange instead became one of the most accurate. It is a 
trait that, combined with considerable grace under pressure, makes him a threat 
in every major tournament and the closest thing to a lock on the narrow, 
unbearably penal layouts on which U.S. Opens are staged. 
</P>
<P>
Having fulfilled that promise twice now, he is in position to do what none of 
the greats alongside whom he played -- Nicklaus, Palmer, Player, Watson, 
Trevino -- could manage: to win a third. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Strange joined the short list of golfers who have won back-to-back 
-- it has only five names, the last being Ben Hogan almost 40 years ago -- and 
over tight, tree-lined Medinah later this summer, he can segue onto the 
short-short list. 
</P>
<P>
It has just one name: Willie Anderson, who turned the trick 85 years ago. 
"Don't know much about Willie Anderson," Strange said. 
</P>
<P>
Which probably means he's got a book in the works.

TORONTO EMERGES AS CITY OF LONG-BALL HITTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
TORONTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Los Angeles and Baltimore, they manufacture pitchers. In St. Louis, 
shortstops roll off the assembly line. In Boston, left fielders come cranking 
out. 
</P>
<P>
But baseball's biggest factory these days is in Toronto. It's the Blue Jays' 
power plant. 
</P>
<P>
First it was Jesse Barfield, who led the majors with 40 home runs in 1986. Then 
George Bell hit 47 in 1987. Last season, Fred McGriff topped the American 
League with 36 homers. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Kelly Gruber is second in the big leagues with 10 home runs. He 
trails only Detroit's Cecil Fielder, who, naturally enough, rose through 
Toronto's minor league system but left the Blue Jays after the 1988 season 
because he couldn't break into the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
So with every team in the major leagues searching desperately for sluggers, how 
come the Blue Jays always seem to find them? 
</P>
<P>
"There was never any intention to actually look for a home-run hitter back in 
the early '80s," Blue Jays assistant general manager Gord Ash said. "The fact 
that this club has produced that type of player stems more from our policy, 
which was to draft the best available athlete." 
</P>
<P>
That's how Boston maintained its long line of left fielders, which started in 
the late 1930s with Ted Williams, continued through Carl Yastrzemski and Jim 
Rice, and now is carried on by Mike Greenwell. The Cardinals became 
shortstop-crazy with Jose Uribe, Rafael Santana and Jose Oquendo growing up in 
their organization, but none beating out Ozzie Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers have produced pitchers like Sandy Koufax, Don Sutton and Orel 
Hershiser. The Orioles have done well with Jim Palmer, Dave McNally and Scott 
McGregor, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
Gruber, who hit a career-high 18 home runs last year, was drafted from the 
Cleveland organization after the 1983 season. 
</P>
<P>
If Gruber could win the league home-run title, it would give Toronto three 
different champions in five years. That hasn't happened in the AL in the span 
of five full seasons since 1939-43, when Williams, Jimmie Foxx and Rudy York 
did it for Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The last time any team produced three home-run champions in such a short time 
was 1961-63, when Willie Mays, Willie McCovey and Orlando Cepeda won titles for 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not about to get into any home run races with Bell or McGriff," Gruber 
said. "I'm not a home run hitter and I don't get paid to hit them. My job is to 
hit the ball hard. If I do that, the home runs will come." 
</P>
<P>
The home runs are now coming for all the Blue Jays, who lead the majors with 42 
in 28 games. Bell is second on the team with six, McGriff and Pat Borders (in 
only 52 at-bats) are next with five. John Olerud has hit four and fellow rookie 
Glenallen Hill has three. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Hill hit 21 home runs at Class AAA Syracuse. Julian Yan led the Blue 
Jays' system with 24 homers at Class A Dunedin and Pedro Munoz had 19 for 
Double-A Knoxville. 
</P>
<P>
And more home runs are likely, now and in the future. After all those panicky, 
early reports last year that the SkyDome was a pitcher's park, Toronto's home 
is turning out to be a homer haven, after all. 
</P>
<P>
Of the Blue Jays' 42 home runs, 34 have been hit at home. All 10 of Gruber's 
shots have come at the SkyDome. 
</P>
<P>
"Every player likes hitting at home," Gruber said. "Besides, the wind is never 
blowing in. The weather is always good." 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't true at Exhibition Stadium, the only place the Blue Jays had played 
before moving last June. There, tricky winds off Lake Ontario were as common as 
the ever-present seagulls. 
</P>
<P>
But so were home runs. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is any question that Exhibition Stadium was a hitter's 
park," Ash said. "But Bell and Barfield are true sluggers with the ability to 
hit the ball out of any park. I don't think it's fair to say the stadium was 
the reason for their high totals." 
</P>
<P>
After several seasons in which aging veterans like Ron Fairly and John Mayberry 
had led the expansion Blue Jays in homers, Toronto began to produce its own 
power five years later in 1982. That when Barfield, a little known right 
fielder, hit 18 homers in 395 at-bats to become the team's first home-grown 
home-run hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Barfield hit 27 homers in 1983 to tie Willie Upshaw, another draft pick, for 
the club lead. 
</P>
<P>
In that same season, Bell, who had been drafted from Philadelphia's system, 
joined Barfield and Lloyd Moseby to form what would eventually become one of 
the most formidable outfields of the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
"Players like Bell and Barfield were a direct result of our draft policy," Ash 
said. "The intention of the club was to draft positional players in the early 
years. Moseby, Barfield, Upshaw and Bell were all a part of that policy, which 
didn't really change until the early '80s when pitching became the priority of 
this club." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the fun really started. Bell and Barfield battled all season for the 
club lead in homers with Bell eventually coming out on top with 28, to 
Barfield's 27. 
</P>
<P>
Barfield really turned on the power in 1986, leading the majors with 40. Bell 
wasn't far behind with 31. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Bell was the AL's Most Valuable Players with 47 homers and 134 RBIs. 
The lively ball may have had something to do with Bell finishing second in the 
league's home-run race to Oakland rookie Mark McGwire's 49. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays had their own rookie at first that season, a tall skinny kid the 
team had swiped from the New York Yankees. McGriff set a club record with 20 
homers in 295 at-bats in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
McGriff was traded with outfielder Dave Collins and pitcher Mike Morgan to the 
Blue Jays on Dec. 9, 1982, for pitcher Dale Murray and a minor leaguer. At that 
point, McGriff had played just two seasons in the Gulf Coast League, hitting a 
total of nine home runs in 298 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
"When we picked up Fred from the Yankees, he was more or less part of a 
package. The immediate need for our club was an experienced outfielder. Dave 
Collins was the guy we were really after," Ash said. "But again, with McGriff, 
it was a case of going after the best possible player." 
</P>
<P>
McGriff hit 34 home runs in 1988 and the doubt had officially been removed as 
to who the real slugger was in the Blue Jays' lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"Freddie's just a natural," Blue Jays manager Cito Gaston says. "With his arm 
extension and his strength, he's ideally suited for hitting home runs. It's not 
something you can teach a kid to do. When you're blessed with the physical 
ability of a McGriff, hitting home runs is something that just comes naturally 
to him."

JAZZ FORCED TO LOOK TO THE FUTURE AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As the Utah Jazz players cleaned out their lockers and split their playoff 
money, team owner Larry H. Miller puzzled over their failure to make it past 
the first round of the playoffs for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
The Jazz, leading 95-86 with 6:55 to play in the fifth and deciding game of the 
Western Conference quarterfinal Sunday, went cold down the stretch and lost 
104-102 when Phoenix Suns' guard Kevin Johnson scored with eight-tenths of a 
second to play. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very difficult one to accept," Miller said Monday. "I feel a lot of 
frustration and anger right now." 
</P>
<P>
The millionaire car dealer said he remained "unequivocally" committed to Coach 
Jerry Sloan, who led Utah to a record 55 wins in the regular season. But the 
Jazz roster will get a hard look, Miller said, though "not until we have time 
to allow emotions to drain off." 
</P>
<P>
"If I'd made the decisions yesterday, I'd probably have changed all 12 of 
them," he added with disgust. 
</P>
<P>
Sloan and Scott Layden, director of player personnel, indicated wholesale 
changes in the roster were not likely. 
</P>
<P>
The players autographed souvenirs, distributed their summer phone numbers and 
divided their $69,375 playoff money into 13 shares. 
</P>
<P>
"No one thought it would be over this quick," Karl Malone said. "It's one of 
those things; you can't do anything about it now. But we wanted to play on. 
Just winning the Midwest Division (in 1989) and 55 games isn't enough any 
more." 
</P>
<P>
John Stockton, a red welt on his neck from Sunday's action, said the playoff 
loss didn't take anything away from the Jazz' best season ever. 
</P>
<P>
"It's disappointing, but you can't cash in your whole future for it," he said. 
"We'll just have to get started again, to improve both individually and as a 
team." 
</P>
<P>
Miller said there was no doubt that losing a crucial playoff game at home -- 
where the Jazz were 36-5 this season -- was worse than the Golden State 
Warriors' lopsided sweep last year. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a lot more frustrating. To get that close and not get the job done," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller would discuss little of his intentions regarding player personnel, but 
offered, "I think we've got to do some things next year. 
</P>
<P>
"We clearly need to get some outside shooting to take pressure off Karl 
(Malone)," he said, noting that opponents were able to "double, triple, even 
quadruple cover" the All-Star forward this season. 
</P>
<P>
While denying any trades are in the works, Miller said he had expected more 
from off-guard Bobby Hansen, a seventh-year pro who averaged 7.6 points a game, 
and second-year backup center Eric Leckner, averaging 4.3 points. 
</P>
<P>
"Bobby has played well in streaks," he said. "This year, he's been in a Jekyll 
and Hyde syndrome. (But) today, I'm not aware of any urgent need to do anything 
there." 
</P>
<P>
He said Sloan and Layden feel Leckner has a lot of talent. "I hope that 
sometime soon with him we see more of that come through. He gets so many fouls 
early," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Jazz did not pick up the contract of Darrell Griffith and he will become an 
unrestricted free agent on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to come back.... My No.1 choice would be to come back here," said 
Griffith, 31, Utah's No.1 draft pick in 1980 and the team's all-time leader in 
games played at 670. "If it doesn't wor out here, hopefully it will somewhere 
else." 
</P>
<P>
Layden said he could not comment on whether Giffith will be with the Jazz next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
As for major roster changes, Layden sad, "We don't want to screw up what we 
have. . . . Collectively, counting all 12 guys, this is a unique group." 
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the season, unless you win a championship, everybody assumes you 
have to make changes because you lost," Sloan said. "Of course we want to make 
ourselves better. But we're not going to make drastic changes because of 
outside pressure." 
</P>
<P>
If Johnson's last shot and missed and the Jazz had moved into the second round, 
"the last question that anybody's going to ask is, 'What changes are you going 
to make?"' Layden said. "Because of that, we don't want to do anything rash or 
out of character for this franchise."

ALICE KAHN: HAPPILY, SHE'S DRIVEN TO MEMORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICE KAHN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I remember what her face looked like in the delivery room mirror. I remember 
seeing her bouncing up and down in her Jolly Jump-Up. I remember her in that 
red, checkered party dress taking her first steps. 
</P>
<P>
I wiped her nose. I counted her toes. I changed her nondisposable diapers. And 
now, I am teaching my baby to drive. 
</P>
<P>
"Where do you go to practice driving?" my friend asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Up to the regional park," I said. "I figure if I'm going to die, I might as 
well do it in a beautiful place." 
</P>
<P>
Ju-u-u-st kidding, as my daughter Emma, now 15 1/2, would say. Actually, the 
odd thing is I don't feel frightened with my baby behind the wheel. I feel 
exhilarated. There are several reasons for this. 
</P>
<P>
One is that driving with my very own Student Driver is no more frightening than 
driving with myself. Not that I'm a terrible driver. I'm fine, really, once I'm 
on the road. My main problem has always been those darned parked cars that 
suddenly materialize while you're backing out of the driveway. You know, those 
little phantoms that are always ducking out of range of your rear-view mirror, 
taunting you with, "Hit us if you can." 
</P>
<P>
The second thing I like is that Emma driving represents a certain amount of 
freedom for me. Not only will I be off chauffeur duty for her, but she'll be so 
eager to get in the car that she'll end up driving around her younger sister, 
Hannah. Right? My days Driving Miss Hannah and being forced to listen to Paula 
Abdul are numbered. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason I like driving with Emma is that it gives us something to do 
together. It's a chance to heal whatever wounds remain from our boxing-kangaroo 
days of mother-daughter junior high hassles. And I like to be with her. She's 
fun. When she's driving, boys pull up to the car and wave. 
</P>
<P>
But most of all, what I love is the look on her face when she's driving. You 
can see in her eyes when the light changes from red to green, the very gates to 
the universe open up. 
</P>
<P>
When she was little, we had so many nicknames for her. "Nucky" was the most 
common, short for Nucknose, short for Nucknosed Nuckersucker. She hated that 
one. "It's not even a common nickname," she complained once. "You know, like 
Snugglebunny." 
</P>
<P>
For a while, we called her "Sockeye," short for sockeye salmon. That came on a 
trip to British Columbia when she was 9 months old. She accidentally gave her 
dad a black eye by beaning him with her diaper-rash ointment jar after a 
wonderful salmon cookout. 
</P>
<P>
I won't tell you the names she's called me over the years. A sarcastic "Yes, 
Your Majesty" was one of the nicest. Then there was the time she threatened to 
write a tell-all biography of her mother, "Blankety-Blank, Dearest." 
</P>
<P>
But when I see her behind the wheel, I think of another nickname we gave old 
Sockeye, old Nucky, old Erma La Dooby. She used to have a rattle, one of those 
Educational Playthings-type things. Maybe your baby has one. It was a flower 
with a mirror in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
We used to call her: Flower-With-a-Face-on-It. And she really did look like 
that, wrapped in her blanket, with her peachy skin, her little black baby 
bangs, her tufts of curls around her ears. 
</P>
<P>
So today, when I see her maintaining an exact 25 on Spruce Street or executing 
a perfect left onto Cedar, I just kind of look at her and sit back and gasp. 
She's still my little Flower-With-a-Face-on-It coming into full bloom.

RESPONSE TO 'ALLIED WAR CRIMES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In March 1945, the German Army unit I served with surrendered to American 
soldiers. I was relieved that the war was finally over and our captors were not 
Soviet forces. 
</P>
<P>
If we had known the misery we had to endure, we would have probably preferred 
the British or Canadians. 
</P>
<P>
At Remagen, our menu (and other issue) with slight variations consisted of a 
spoon of milk and eggpowder, toilet paper and some soap at the beginning, no 
latrines available. An extremely wet spring changed the ground into a muddy 
quagmire. No cover, no blankets, only the clothes on our bodies. Amongst the 
masses of POWs one could find amputees, very young boys and old men in their 
60s. 
</P>
<P>
In seconds we swallowed our daily ration, thinking about food the hours to 
come, listening to discussions about the nutritional value of insects, worms 
and grass. I saw some prisoners eating those. 
</P>
<P>
A tiny percentage was able to join work commands in and outside the camp. My 
knowledge of the English language made it possible to act as interpreter, which 
improved my situation somewhat. When transferred to another camp, there were 
fights for the few slices of bread thrown to us from civilians. 
</P>
<P>
In fall we were transported to Luneville, France. There we were fed with a 
watery soup twice a day and a slice of bread. Volunteers who carried the bodies 
out received an extra ration of soup.

<P>
I was taken prisoner in the first days of April 1945 near Hamen in Westphalia 
by the 1st U.S. Army. I was then just out of medical school, not yet an officer 
but an MD. 
</P>
<P>
We German prisoners were transported in open trucks and closed cattle cars on 
trains into France. In the train we did not get water or food for over 48 hours 
and the doors were never unlocked. 
</P>
<P>
I ended up in Camp Attichy near Attiguy in N.E. France where I remained until 
approximately August, 1945. 
</P>
<P>
This camp was a starvation camp. I figured out that we received 350 to 500 
calories per day. We had one slowly running water faucet for approximately 
3,000 men. This was in an open meadow and no facilities. 
</P>
<P>
My weakness soon was such that any slight physical activity caused fainting and 
getting up off the ground took a long time and had to be accomplished in 
stages. 
</P>
<P>
We never saw the Red Cross. The only organization that came to the camp and 
gave us some musical instruments was the YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
I did not get any mail for over one year. My parents did not know whether I was 
dead or alive for almost 15 months, although I had written every occasion we 
were permitted to send "Red Cross post cards" (pre-printed with blanks to be 
filled in). 
</P>
<P>
In August I was transferred to the 1811th labor supervision company where I 
remained until my discharge in August, 1946. There, the prisoners and I (as the 
camp doctor and able to speak German, French and English) were treated very 
well and had more than enough food. 
</P>
<P>
James Baque is absolutely correct in his description of the camps. We had many 
deaths due to causes exacerbated by malnutrition.

ECOLOGICAL GAMES FROM LOCAL SOURCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was surprised that the recent article on ecological games entirely missed a 
local source ("Playing Games With Mother Nature," May 2). Animal Town Game Co. 
in Santa Barbara has been producing and distributing games for more than 10 
years, including wonderful board games that require players to cooperate to 
save the whales or to grow an organic garden. Its catalogue is full of 
ecological and earth-centered activities not available in stores.

YOUTHS FORM NEW 'GANGS' WITH DESIGNS ON CHANGING GRAFFITI TAGGING INTO ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Spank" is one of many young toughs in Hollywood who have grown tired of the 
gang fighting and graffiti tagging of buildings that have for years been the 
pastimes of choice on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
A growing number of youths like Spank are choosing another way to express 
themselves. They are joining "crews," or loose-knit gangs of graffiti artists 
who are painting huge, spectacular -- and legal -- murals in Hollywood and 
elsewhere in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The crew members, many of them former gang members, are highly competitive, but 
in a different way from traditional gang rivalries. 
</P>
<P>
"We do graffiti against each other," said Spank, otherwise known as Julio 
Crespo, 20, "without having to kill each other." 
</P>
<P>
Another youth, "Skate," is so enamored of the burgeoning artistic craft that he 
now leads his own crew of 20 youngsters. He is teaching them, in his spare time 
and for free, to spray paint murals and use airbrush techniques. 
</P>
<P>
"I got into this because it isn't a gang," said Skate, 20, whose given name is 
Aaron Anderson. "It's fun, without the violence and the vandalism." 
</P>
<P>
The crew concept originated in New York in the mid-1970s, and crews with names 
like "Can't Be Stopped" and "Most Wanted Artists" began cropping up in Los 
Angeles about five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, they functioned in an outlaw netherworld, where so-called 
bombers kept one eye on their "piece," or illegal artwork, and the other eye 
peeled for the cops. 
</P>
<P>
While many crew members remain primarily engaged in tagging -- the practice of 
marking territory with cryptic names and gang affiliation all over walls -- 
some, such as Spank and Skate, have become genuine artists. 
</P>
<P>
To underscore this change of emphasis, "Can't Be Stopped," Skate's crew, now 
calls itself "Creating Better Styles." 
</P>
<P>
And with the help of a coalition of neighborhood groups called United Streets 
of Hollywood, the local crews are being coaxed into the open. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for being allowed to paint legally on giant spaces, such as 
building sides and construction sites, the crews have pledged to work to 
eliminate tag-style graffiti and help businesses create the murals, to police 
the art pieces themselves and to encourage other youths to get involved. 
</P>
<P>
Motivated by a desire to create, not vandalize, there are now at least 10 
Hollywood crews, and more than 500 artists ranging in age from 9 to mid-20s. 
</P>
<P>
"This art is coming from the streets," said Laura Dodson, president of the 
neighborhood coalition, who first brought the street artists into contact with 
city officials and area businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of painting it over, we should look at it," Dodson said. "It is 
something people should really experience and feel. . . . This is a movement." 
</P>
<P>
Under Dodson's supervision, as many as 200 of the young artists pitched in 
recently to paint a vast mural, depicting the theme "Hollywood Legends" on a 
plywood wall surrounding the Galaxy construction site at the corner of 
Hollywood Boulevard and Sycamore Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
After being approached by Dodson and city officials, project developer 
Kornwasser &amp; Friedman agreed to allow the mural and put up $1,000 for paint 
and supplies. The mural project, called Boulev Art, began in February and was 
unveiled March 25, more than 600 cans of spray paint later. 
</P>
<P>
At the unveiling, City Councilman Michael Woo presented the artists with 
commendations from the city for helping to beautify Hollywood. Several youths, 
including Spank, ventured to City Hall in late April for more honors. 
</P>
<P>
Before an audience in the ornate City Council chamber, Spank said: "People 
stereotype (graffiti artists), saying all we do is vandalize. But we can also 
do art that can beautify a city." 
</P>
<P>
Woo says he hopes the artistry can continue on blank walls, alleys and 
construction sites throughout Hollywood, as long as the youths receive 
permission from building owners. Otherwise, no matter how beautiful, the murals 
are illegal and punishable by a potential fine and jail term. 
</P>
<P>
Another project under way by the crews, with Dodson's help, is an ambitious 
40-by-1,000-foot mural on the side of a Hollywood disco, done in a colorful 
jungle motif. That mural will be finished by mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
Skate says he takes particular pride in that unfinished mural, and says he 
looks forward to doing others, even if he does it for free (minus expenses). 
</P>
<P>
"As long as I get the wall and a chance to work, I'm fine," he said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
Dodson has continued as a liaison between the street artists, the city and 
local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"People do not realize how many kids are doing this," Dodson said. "The kids 
are always being put down, and all they want is to be up. They have talents and 
they want to be great artists." 
</P>
<P>
The mural artists say they belong to the culture of "hip-hop," which mixes rap 
music, spray paint art, skateboarding and underground dance clubs. Many crews 
are highly organized. Indeed, Dodson says she contacts some of them by beeper. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the changes, Dodson notes that gang attitudes still exist among the 
youths, often very close to the surface. "It was touch and go there for a 
while" when the crews were working together on the BoulevArt project, she said. 
"But we made it through. They realized there was a lot on the line here and 
didn't want to mess up." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the artwork is so impressive, Dodson said, that the creators have been 
approached for commercial ventures. She said the youths are learning to have a 
sense of community spirit and will participate in a June 16 cleanup of 
Hollywood in which they will wash off all the tag-style graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Dubin, Kornwasser &amp; Friedman vice president and a member of the 
Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, said he is trying to encourage other businesses 
to allow the artists to paint on their walls.

PANEL CONSIDERS PLAN FOR MALIBU MAGNET SCHOOL; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: DISTRICT OFFICIALS CITE THE 25-MILE COMMUTE AND TRAFFIC RISKS AS 
REASONS TO OPEN A NEW HIGH SCHOOL. BUT CRITICS FEAR THE LOSS OF SANTA MONICA 
HIGH SCHOOL'S BEST STUDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELDON ITO, COMMUNITY CORRESPONDENT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A committee formed by the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District is 
investigating the possibility of opening a magnet high school in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Students who live in Malibu face a 25-mile, one-hour commute each day to Santa 
Monica High, the district's only high school, and they run the risk of traffic 
accidents, district officials say. 
</P>
<P>
But several Santa Monica parents and teachers said at a hearing last week that 
a public high school in Malibu focusing on college preparation could lower the 
quality of Santa Monica High School by luring away its best and brightest 
students. 
</P>
<P>
"When you (siphon) off students who are better students, it has a negative 
impact on the students who are left behind," Tassie Hadlock-Piltz, a history 
teacher at Santa Monica High School, told the Malibu High School Study 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
To integrate its student body, the Malibu school would recruit minority 
students from Santa Monica. Hadlock-Piltz added that if the best minority 
students transfer, it could leave other minorities without role models. 
</P>
<P>
But committee members said the terms magnet and college prep, which are being 
applied to the proposed school, are misleading. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not looking to start an elitist school," Supt. Eugene Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
"In California, even average students are able to get into college, if they 
work hard enough," he said. The new school, which would be located in existing 
facilities at Malibu Park School, would have no special academic entrance 
requirements, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Because the district wants a racial mix at Santa Monica and Malibu high 
schools, not every Caucasian student who lives in Santa Monica and wants to 
transfer to Malibu would be allowed to, Tucker said. The study committee is 
working on entrance criteria. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed budget for the new school would include funds to hire a recruiter 
of minority students, Tucker said. He said that average minority students may 
want to attend Malibu High School for its smaller size, for a change of 
environment or to get away from gangs. 
</P>
<P>
The 800-student school, if approved, would open in September, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Jeffrey D. Jennings said the school is being planned because 
of increasing traffic congestion on Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
"In a real sense, Santa Monica High School is getting farther and farther 
away," he said. About 350 students travel from Malibu to attend Santa Monica 
High, which has about 2,600 students. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than having their children commute to Santa Monica, Malibu parents are 
sending them to private schools in Agoura and elsewhere, district officials and 
parents said. 
</P>
<P>
Malibu parent David Caplan said an informal survey of his friends found that 
"less than one in three will send their children to Santa Monica High School . 
. . because of the drive, the time, the danger. 
</P>
<P>
"The brain drain does not occur when Santa Monica students attend high school 
in Malibu, it occurs because of Malibu students going to private schools," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The study committee is to submit a final report to the Board of Education on 
June 11.

IT'S NOT JUST A SUMMER JOB, FOR SOME IT'S AN ADVENTURE 
</P>

Some college students spend their summers working in shopping malls or in 
search of the ultimate tan. 
</P>
<P>
Not Charlotte Andersen, who will supervise an archeological dig in Portugal. Or 
Ari Kaplan, who has a job keeping statistics for the Baltimore Orioles. Or 
Gayani DeSilva, who plans to study elephantiasis in Sri Lanka. 
</P>
<P>
All are among an intrepid corps of San Gabriel Valley college students out to 
put their own spin on "How I spent my summer vacation." 
</P>
<P>
"When students take responsibility for their own education, anything is 
possible," said Tom Manley, director of External Studies at Pitzer College in 
Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
Andersen, 23, a graduating senior at Pomona College, will spend 12 weeks living 
in the small farming town of Mertola in southeast Portugal. She will supervise 
excavation of a medieval Islamic site, called Alcaria Longa, believed to have 
been a pottery-making region between 950 and 1200, when Spain and Portugal were 
under Muslim rule. 
</P>
<P>
Andersen, who will receive a $2,000 stipend from the National Science 
Foundation, says the most exciting part of the trip will be "living in and 
learning a primitive culture." 
</P>
<P>
"The classroom instruction can be so dry," she said. "This is the real thing." 
</P>
<P>
While Andersen is studying pottery in a medieval town, Kaplan, of Caltech, will 
spend his summer in the ballpark studying earned-run averages for the Baltimore 
Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan, a sophomore engineering major, will work in the Orioles' statistical 
department. A left fielder for the Caltech varsity team, Kaplan, 20, says he is 
the envy of his friends. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never done anything like this before," he said. "I'll be able to see 
baseball from the inside and hopefully meet all the players." 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan says he wants to work for either the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration or a professional baseball team after graduation. His summer job 
is an outgrowth of a research project -- which explored new methods of 
calculating pitching statistics -- that he completed last year for Caltech's 
Summer Undergraduate Research Scholarship program. 
</P>
<P>
Originally from New Jersey, Kaplan says the New York Mets are still his 
favorite team, but "that might change after the summer." 
</P>
<P>
Combining a family vacation with research, DeSilva will go back to her native 
country, Sri Lanka, to work as a volunteer with the nation's Department of 
Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
She will study the spread of disease through mosquitoes, particularly the 
spread of elephantiasis, a chronic disease common to the area. Elephantiasis is 
characterized by the enlargement of certain parts of the body, especially the 
legs and the genitals. 
</P>
<P>
DeSilva, a junior majoring in biology at Scripps College in Claremont, plans to 
enroll in medical school and says this research will give her an edge on other 
students. She says she has come a long way since she worked at a muffin store 
in an Orange County shopping mall during the summer before college. 
</P>
<P>
"Doing research gives me confidence with my own intellectual capabilities, and 
it helps you integrate what you learn in class with real life," DeSilva said. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie Bailey, 19, of Claremont McKenna College, will work in the library of 
the Arizona State Prison Complex, helping inmates better understand the law and 
the workings of the justice system. The job is not paid, but she will receive a 
$2,500 community service grant from the James Irvine Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's basically going to be me and a lot of law books in a small room inside 
the prison complex," Bailey said. "I am very interested in prison reform and 
finding ways to decrease the rate of violent crimes. And in order to understand 
the whole process better, I need hands-on experience inside a prison." 
</P>
<P>
Bailey also believes out-of-the-ordinary activities help keep her "lively." 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't step out of the bounds once in a while, your paths will become 
too narrow," she said. "I don't want to just graduate, get a job in some 
company and stay there for the rest of my life. . . . I have to feel like I've 
made a difference." 
</P>
<P>
Bailey, a junior philosophy major, says she is too excited to be nervous, even 
though during her visit to the maximum security prison the warden asked her to 
sign an agreement that she would not ask for special treatment in case she was 
taken hostage. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a petite blonde girl who is not used to working in this environment, but I 
have a real good feeling about this," Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
Another Claremont McKenna student, Kurt Freeman, 20, will work as a camp 
counselor in an American military base in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman, a psychology major, said getting the chance to work with children at 
the Negeshi Heights military base, near Tokyo, is the best part of the program; 
getting to go to Japan isn't bad either. 
</P>
<P>
"The only negative thing is that I'm going to miss my brother's wedding, but 
this is too great an opportunity to miss," Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
Rachel Devine of Pitzer College will spend her summer living with a family in 
Iceland while she works on a photo essay and an anthropology research paper. 
</P>
<P>
Devine, an art/anthropology major, said she has always been interested in the 
culture and people of Iceland, but when she went to her school's office of 
external studies, she found there were no study-abroad programs in Iceland. So 
she created her own program through the University of Iceland. 
</P>
<P>
For her anthropology project, she will research state-run day-care centers and 
the plight of single mothers. And for her art project, she will assemble photos 
documenting the lives of Icelandic painters, musicians and poets. 
</P>
<P>
"This, in a way, will be an extension of school, but much more fun," Devine, 
19, said. 
</P>
<P>
Other college students plan to work together this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve Cal Poly Pomona students are preparing to enter a solar car in the 
1,800-mile Sunrayce USA, a 10-day Florida-to-Michigan road race in which 
they'll compete against 31 other colleges. 
</P>
<P>
First- and second-place winners in the July race, sponsored by General Motors, 
will be sent to Australia at GM's expense to compete in the 1990 World Solar 
Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"We're putting the final touches on the car and doing the final testing," said 
Jon Harvey, student director for the project. 
</P>
<P>
Shaped like a teardrop, the "Solar Flair" is 20 feet long and weighs about 500 
pounds, almost 1,500 pounds lighter than a regular car. 
</P>
<P>
"Working on this project has provided unbelievable training," said Harvey, who 
is working on his master's degree in mechanical engineering. 
</P>
<P>
Another group of students, from Pitzer College, plans to travel through 
Laundromats and lesbian bars in the Pomona area, researching AIDS among 
minority women and passing out information about the disease. 
</P>
<P>
They selected Laundromats because they expect to encounter lots of working 
class women there; lesbian bars were chosen because they believe lesbians, many 
of whom are bisexual, are at greater risk for AIDS than is generally 
recognized. 
</P>
<P>
The research project has its roots in college classes on women and AIDS. Six 
students who took the courses have volunteered to continue the research this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
The students will conduct personal interviews with women they encounter, asking 
questions about sexual history and practices and knowledge of AIDS. They also 
will give each of their subjects a safe-sex kit, which includes condoms and 
pamphlets about AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are trying to do is develop an AIDS prevention program that is 
culturally sensitive," said Lourdes Arguelles, professor of women's studies, 
who started the Women and AIDS class in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"And for the students, this opens a whole new world for them. They establish 
relationships they would have never known. . . . They see the complexity of the 
world."

UNION ANGRILY CRITICIZES SCHOOL CUT AND LAYOFF PROPOSALS 
</P>

<P>
A plan to cut $1.3 million from next year's ABC school district budget has 
drawn angry criticism from union leaders because it includes a proposal to lay 
off six classified workers while adding a new administrator for research and 
evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
Union leaders attacked the proposal during a school board study session last 
week that called for eliminating 18 positions. Most of the cuts would be 
handled by not filling vacancies and reassigning employees, but six maintenance 
and clerical workers would lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
ABC Unified School District trustees are scheduled to act on the recommendation 
Tuesday during a regular meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The item that caused the union's anger calls for creation of a director of 
research, assessment and evaluation at a cost of $78,000, including salary and 
benefits. An additional $27,000 is budgeted for the director's secretary. 
</P>
<P>
"We are vigorously opposed to this," said Pete Schnaufer, business agent for 
the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. "The district 
is proposing to lay off classified employees while adding another level of 
bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
The union represents about 270 blue-collar workers in the district. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't blame people for being upset" with the cuts, Supt. Larry Lucas said, 
"but it is a misconception to say we are cutting classified to hire 
administrators. We also cut administrative positions. We added the new director 
because we need to know how our kids are doing." The director will make "an 
overall assessment of student performance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
John Ennes, president of the teachers union, said teachers are also opposed to 
the new position. 
</P>
<P>
"We took a survey, and 99.6% of the teachers were opposed to it. Many districts 
do not have this position," Ennes said. "Teachers are not being hit directly by 
this, but the money (for the new position) could have been used to save jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, a warehouse worker, a glazier, a custodian, a bus mechanic, an 
intermediate account clerk and a switchboard operator would not be rehired. 
</P>
<P>
The district will help them find jobs either with other businesses or within 
the district, Lucas said. 
</P>
<P>
The district is short $1.1 million in its $83-million budget for 1990-91, 
Assistant Supt. Kim Stalling said. The district's $10-million reserve will be 
applied to the deficit, he said.

OPPOSING A CALL FOR HIGHER DENSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re: Your article in the Westside Digest (Times, May 3), Daniel S. Levitan of 
Price Waterhouse Real Estate Consulting Group should be sent to live in New 
York. He states that "a vertical city can be just as livable as one that is 
horizontal." 
</P>
<P>
Bull! Anyone can see the difference between the "Golden Ghetto" that developers 
have inflicted on Wilshire Boulevard versus the beauty of Cheviot Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Levitan's call for citizens to tell their elected officials to allow 
high-density development is a transparent attempt to cater to the profit 
motives of his clients at the expense of livability for everyone else. Hasn't 
he been reading The Times' stories on water shortages? Higher density means 
denser smog, denser traffic, higher water use and a lowering of the quality of 
life for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Of course there are millions of Americans (and non-Americans) who want to own a 
home, but too many of them who want to live in Southern California. 
California's resources are limited. The only fair way to decide who will get 
ownership of a scarce resource is price, Mr. Waterhouse. I'm glad to be one of 
the lucky ones who couldn't possibly afford to buy the house I now own. I call 
it "success."

STUDY SHOWS LATINO INCREASE IN W. HOLLYWOOD; 
</P>
<P>
DEMOGRAPHICS: CITY OFFICIALS HAVE CAST DOUBT ON THE VALIDITY OF THE SURVEY BY 
USC RESEARCHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE ANA BERBEO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two large minority groups have for some time made their voices heard in the 
city of West Hollywood: gays and Russian-Jewish immigrants. Both make up a 
substantial portion of the city's population, and the city has responded to 
their presence, setting up services for their special needs. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to a recent study commissioned by the city, there is another 
group that has not been recognized: a hidden but growing population of 
Spanish-speaking immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
A social service survey done in April indicated that the number of city 
residents whose first language is Spanish has more than doubled in the past 10 
years, from 2,000 to more than 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, Latinos make up 11.8% of West Hollywood's population, 
estimated at 44,390, and they are projected to reach 15.5% by 1994. 
</P>
<P>
If the numbers are correct, the city will have to take another look at planning 
for social services, said Social Services Administrator Jodi Curlee. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials expressed skepticism at the large numbers of Latinos cited 
in the survey, which was done by two researchers from the USC School of Social 
Work. "The city is, frankly, finding it hard to believe," Curlee said. "This 
information is so different from any of the other projections made in the past 
few years." 
</P>
<P>
Curlee said city statistics showed Latinos make up a much smaller percentage of 
the city's population -- about half of the 5,000 estimated in the report. 
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, the majority of Latinos -- including 
Mexican-Americans, Central Americans, and South Americans -- live in the east 
end of West Hollywood, such as the area around Plummer Park. It showed a very 
high number of children under 13 years old living in that area, compared to the 
rest of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that, despite the apparently large number of Latinos who 
live in the city, few use the social services provided by the city -- only 10% 
compared to more than 50% of Russian-speaking immigrants. Some of the services 
include English as a Second Language classes, transportation, and senior 
citizen services. 
</P>
<P>
Every two years, the city's social services are submitted to a competitive 
bidding process. Preliminary proposals will be released to bidders in May, and 
final proposals will be submitted to the City Council for approval at the end 
of July, Curlee said. 
</P>
<P>
She refused to speculate on how the survey's findings may affect planned 
budgets for city services, such as the ESL classes or child care. 
</P>
<P>
"This particular information is a surprise to the city, and we want to do some 
more work on it before we make decisions based on it. We need to verify this 
kind of information before making the final proposals," Curlee said. 
</P>
<P>
However, those statistics are nearly impossible to verify, said Evan Cole, a 
demographic information specialist with Urban Decision Systems, which provided 
the demographic statistics used in the city survey. 
</P>
<P>
Cole said his company used data from the 1980 census, and made population 
growth projections based on the rate of growth a group experienced in the years 
between 1970 and 1980. 
</P>
<P>
More current data on households was obtained from the Postal Service and from 
other mail services, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't any way to verify this, short of going door-to-door," he said.

RENT CONTROL LETTER DRAWS A REBUTTAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mr. Keith Lambert (Letters, April 22) seems to have his concepts of democracy 
and communism a bit askew. 
</P>
<P>
The majority (i.e. tenants) in Santa Monica voted for the rent control law. 
They were free elections, which I consider to be one of the tenets of 
democracy. What Mr. Lambert seems to want is oppression by the minority (i.e. 
landlords) in Santa Monica, similar to what has taken place in the communist 
world. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of the people in Santa Monica voted not only for the Rent Control 
Board but for the City Council that in turn carries out the wishes of the 
people. Where have you been, Comrade Lambert?

MONTEBELLO OKS PUBLIC REVIEW FOR MOST DEVELOPMENT PLANS 
</P>

<P>
The City Council, which is trying to control development, has created another 
hurdle for developers who want to build in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The council last week unanimously passed a zoning amendment requiring that the 
city Planning Commission hold formal hearings on most development proposals to 
allow neighbors to air concerns. 
</P>
<P>
The review process will give the Planning Commission a chance to check the 
compatibility of the project with neighboring areas and require that plans be 
changed if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is getting so crowded," Mayor Ed Pizzorno said. "Just about 
everything built infringes on neighboring property." 
</P>
<P>
Planning Director Paul Deibel said the amendment requires hearings for 
residential projects with three units or more. Also, commercial or industrial 
projects of more than 5,000 square feet are required to undergo a public site 
review. 
</P>
<P>
The projects must also undergo an environmental review that, until now, was 
conducted only for larger projects, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, development plans that met code requirements needed approval only 
by the Planning Commission, and residents were allowed to comment only if the 
developer was asking for a conditional-use permit, Deibel said. That practice 
has angered more than a few residents, who complained that they were surprised 
to find that the empty field or single-family home next door was being replaced 
with an apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's action was one of several steps taken recently by the council to 
control growth, including a yearlong moratorium on duplexes and apartments in 
some residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
During the last two years, developers have flocked to Montebello, which has 
become increasingly attractive, especially to young families from East Los 
Angeles. Montebello has surpassed its 1988 level of building applications and 
has nearly reached 1989 levels. 
</P>
<P>
City leaders have expressed concern that uncontrolled development will overtax 
water and sewer systems, increase traffic, and destroy the character of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Pizzorno said the council has also asked city staff members to set up an 
architectural review board to monitor the quality of developments.

POMONA EYES AZUSA CHIEF AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
City Council members have renewed their interest in hiring Azusa Police Chief 
Lloyd Wood, even though he withdrew from consideration for the chief's job in 
Pomona two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
City Administrator Julio Fuentes said he told Wood last week about the 
council's interest in hiring him, but Wood has not yet agreed to take the job. 
Wood could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Wood withdrew his name from consideration in early March after lengthy 
negotiations over a three-year employment agreement, saying it had become clear 
that he could not get the council's full support. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant said he is still opposed to hiring Wood under a 
long-term agreement. Bryant said the "market is flooded with people" who are 
qualified to be police chief and would take the job without the added security 
of an employment contract. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilwoman Nell Soto said the city should give three-year contracts not 
only to Wood but also to Fire Chief Tom Fee and Fuentes. "I think it would 
bring about stability," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The city has been unable to fill the police chief's position on a permanent 
basis since Chief Richard Tefank was fired last September. 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes, who was hired late last year, has been severely criticized by Bryant. 
Mayor Donna Smith, who supports Fuentes, said the council was on the verge of 
firing Fuentes six weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Soto said rumors have made it difficult for Fuentes to concentrate on his job. 
With a three-year agreement, Soto said, "Julio would have peace of mind." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said Pomona will have to offer a long-term contract to attract a 
qualified police chief because the city has had so much political turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
But Bryant said that if an employee performs well, "nobody is going to threaten 
his job." The notion that an employee needs a three-year commitment, he said, 
"is a bunch of garbage." 
</P>

<P>
There was a small crisis last week at the Compton City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Walter R. Tucker is hospitalized and, because the City Charter does not 
provide for a vice mayor or mayor pro tem, the council had to find a way to 
fill Tucker's chair until he returns. 
</P>
<P>
At their meeting Tuesday, council members hastily selected Councilman Maxcy D. 
Filer to act as mayor pro tem until Tucker returns. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker, who was elected last year to his third council term, had surgery 
Tuesday morning for an undisclosed illness. Gwen Robinson, an administrative 
assistant to the mayor and council, said that Tucker weathered the surgery well 
but that she did not know when he will be able to resume his duties.

JULY CLOSING DATE SET FOR LEGAL AID OFFICE; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: THE OFFICE PROVIDES FREE LEGAL ADVICE TO LOW-INCOME TENANTS. MONEY 
PROBLEMS ARE FORCING THE CLOSING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Low-income tenants in the Westside needing free legal assistance in resolving 
housing matters will have one less place to turn to this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The Legal Aid Foundation announced that it will close its Santa Monica office 
July 1 because of a shortage of funds. 
</P>
<P>
The office on Pico Boulevard nearly closed last year because of money problems, 
and cut back its hours to 18 a week. But even that was not enough. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Jack Schwartz, who managed the office, said he was disappointed by the 
decision, and he forecast a gloomy future for low-income tenants. 
</P>
<P>
"The number of homeless in the Westside will double, and there will be a 
tenfold increase in the number of illegal evictions," Schwartz predicted. "The 
Westside is going to become whiter and wealthier and with fewer children." 
</P>
<P>
The Legal Aid office provides free legal assistance for low-income tenants 
faced with eviction notices, substandard living conditions and other 
landlord-tenant problems. 
</P>
<P>
Although tenants will have access to the downtown Los Angeles Legal Aid office, 
most of the slack is expected to be picked up by Westside Legal Services in 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Westside Legal Services, which was formed nine years ago after Central Legal de 
Santa Monica and Santa Monica Legal Aid Society merged, is also expected to 
receive city funds that had been going to the Legal Aid Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Elena Popp, executive director of Westside Legal Services, said she has asked 
that the $66,542 from the city that would have gone to Legal Aid for 1990-91 be 
given to her group. With that money, Popp said, the group plans to hire an 
additional full-time attorney and a paralegal to take over the clients of Legal 
Aid. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to aid in landlord-tenant disputes, Legal Services, at Colorado 
Boulevard and 6th Street, provides free legal aid in areas including domestic 
violence. The group also receives funding from the city. The group is asking 
for about $123,000 for 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
The funding requests will be considered by the City Council during the annual 
city budget review in June. 
</P>
<P>
But even with the additional money, legal assistance for the Westside's poor is 
still inadequate, Popp said. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be expanding our services, but the legal needs of poor people are still 
severely unmet," she said.

ARMENIAN BECOMES TOP FOREIGN TONGUE IN GLENDALE SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Armenian has replaced Spanish this year as the predominant foreign language in 
Glendale schools, and the percentage of students who speak a primary language 
other than English rose to 63%, school district officials say. 
</P>
<P>
An annual language census presented to Board of Education members last week 
showed that the number of Armenian students, most of whom are recent immigrants 
and speak only limited English, has more than doubled since 1988, from 2,309 to 
4,859. 
</P>
<P>
That has boosted Armenian above Spanish, Korean and Filipino/Tagalog as the 
most common non-English language in the schools, the census indicated. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw it coming," said Sally Buckley, principal of Lincoln Elementary School 
and education specialist for the district who wrote the report. "There's been a 
big jump in the last four years. Although I don't think two years ago we knew 
we were going to see the number of immigrants from Armenia that we're getting." 
</P>
<P>
The yearly census, required by the state Department of Education, records the 
number of students with a primary language other than English who have limited 
English-speaking skills and the number with a primary language other than 
English but who are fluent in English. 
</P>
<P>
The census showed that 58 languages are represented among the district's 24,400 
students. The greatest diversity exists in southern Glendale schools, where 
most immigrant children enroll, according to the survey. 
</P>
<P>
At Mann Elementary on East Acacia Avenue, nearly 91% of the school's 1,250 
students have a primary language other than English, and most of those have 
only limited English skills, the census showed. 
</P>
<P>
Eight other elementary schools top the district's 63% average of students whose 
primary language is not English: 86% at Cerritos and Edison, 85% at Marshall, 
80% at Columbus and Muir, 78% at Jefferson, 73% at Franklin, and 65% at Balboa. 
Five years ago, the district's average was 49%, according to the language 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
"What it represents for us is an ongoing effort to secure excellent teachers 
who can speak other languages, like Armenian and Spanish and Korean," Mann 
Principal Wayne Sparks said. "We English-speakers can stagger on, but it's 
obviously an advantage for a teacher to make something understandable in 
another language." 
</P>
<P>
Northern Glendale schools also have seen a change, Buckley said. For instance, 
in the La Crescenta area, which includes Crescenta Valley High School, the 
number of students whose English-speaking skills are limited climbed from 9% in 
March, 1989, to 19% in October, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"At a school that may have been affected only by Spanish before, they may be 
seeing multi-ethnic students now," she said. "But the strategies are no 
different." 
</P>
<P>
The findings in the census are not surprising, and continue a steady increase 
over the last several years, she said. This year's 63% is a 4% increase from 
last year, which in turn was a 4.5% increase from 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But district officials acknowledged that the census has broad implications. The 
increasing number of students with limited English requires more bilingual 
teachers and aides, who are much in demand throughout the state, district 
spokesman Vic Pallos said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a newly enrolled student with little or no English ability needs 
about three years of special English tutoring and services before he or she can 
be fully integrated into a school's English-speaking environment, Buckley said. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of tutoring is to get students to "speak fluent English and compete 
with students who know only English," she said. "Generally speaking, we don't 
even expect children to be successfully academic for at least three years." 
</P>
<P>
The Welcome Center, operated by the district's intercultural education office, 
has offered special language services since it opened almost two years ago, she 
said. According to the census, it has had some success: 1,014 students were 
reclassified as fluent in English this school year; 650 were reclassified in 
1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
"It's challenging, but I think we're doing pretty well," Buckley said. 
"Glendale's been a conservative community, and I think we just need to keep 
aware of the changes."

STUDENTS PUT STAMP ON POSTAL CELEBRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

A skit about ZIP codes, a song about post offices and a poem about stamps. 
</P>
<P>
Has the Point Vicente Elementary School in Rancho Palos Verdes whipped itself 
into a philatelic frenzy? 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the student presentations recently were part of an effort by the 
school to help launch a series of five stamps marking the U.S. Coast Guard's 
bicentennial. In the process, students learned something about the Coast Guard 
and the Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
The stamps, picturing venerable lighthouses around the country, were formally 
unveiled last month at the National Archives in Washington. But Point Vicente 
students helped stage an event of their own, presenting the ZIP code skit, the 
post office song, the stamp poem and a narrative about the Coast Guard in a 
"second-day" ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
It was one in a handful of such ceremonies held around the country to help 
launch the new stamps, according to Herman Sanchez, an educational events 
organizer with the U.S. Postal Service's Long Beach office. Students said they 
enjoyed taking part. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned that stamp collecting is not just a little thing," said Fola 
Popoola, a fourth-grader who has been collecting stamps for two years. "It's 
big, and you should be proud of it." 
</P>
<P>
Corey Ratner, also a fourth-grader, said the ceremony left her better informed 
about the Coast Guard: "I learned that the Coast Guard takes care of a lot more 
than I expected. I didn't know they took care of lighthouses or helped take 
care of the oil spills in Alaska and Huntington Beach." 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez says the elementary school was picked as the site for a ceremony 
because it is near the Point Vicente Lighthouse, a 67-foot cylindrical tower 
built on the edge of a 130-foot cliff. The lighthouse was not the subject of 
one of the new stamps, however. 
</P>
<P>
The only West Coast lighthouse pictured in the series is the Spanish-motif 
Admiralty Head Lighthouse at the entrance to Puget Sound. The others are the 
lighthouses in West Quoddy Head, Me.; Cape Hatteras, N.C.; American Shoals, 
Fla., and Sandy Hook, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of the school's events was an outdoor assembly featuring the student 
presentations, speeches by visitors and an unveiling of the new stamps. After 
the unveiling, Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Alan Carver announced the six winners of a 
student stamp design contest. 
</P>
<P>
The winning entries, including drawings of a desert landscape, a seal on a rock 
and a lighthouse, will be sent to a Postal Service advisory committee for 
consideration as future stamps. The artists, meanwhile, are scheduled to spend 
a day on a Coast Guard cutter in October. 
</P>
<P>
A makeshift post office was set up on campus, and envelopes carrying the new 
stamps were emblazoned with pictorial cancellations commemorating the event. 
</P>
<P>
Pamela Lopez, principal of the school, said the student artwork and 
presentations developed for the lighthouse stamp ceremony are part of a broader 
teaching strategy at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Students staged a mock convention, for instance, to mark the presidential 
election year and will take field trips and prepare presentations when they 
embark on a study of cities. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel this kind of thing is a real part of life," Lopez said. "Instead of 
learning from a book, they learn from experience."

TAX GUIDELINES ON WHAT QUALIFIES AS 'IMPROVEMENT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENNY L. KASS, Kass is a Washington lawyer and newspaper columnist 
specializing in real estate and tax matters.

<P>
QUESTION: What improvements is a home seller allowed to add to his cost basis? 
I know that general maintenance does not count and that additions, such as 
fences, decks and added rooms, do count. I am uncertain, however, about 
replacements. In our home of 25 years, every major appliance has been replaced 
at least once, including the furnace and water heater. Can we add the cost of 
these replacements to our basis? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: This is a very important subject that is often overlooked by 
homeowners. Over the last quarter-century, real estate values have skyrocketed, 
and when the homeowner sells the property, every dollar that can be added to 
cost basis is a potential 33 cent savings on federal income tax. 
</P>
<P>
The tax court cases that have discussed the issues of capital improvements are 
usually raised in the context of whether the real estate investor can deduct 
certain expenses in the year they are paid, or whether those expenses have to 
be added to the basis. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, from the point of view of the investor, if expenses can be deducted 
legitimately in the year they are paid, this is more desirable than merely 
tacking these expenses to the cost basis for a future savings down the road. 
</P>
<P>
The distinction, while significant today, was more important prior to the 1986 
Tax Reform Act. Investors wanted to take advantage of a tax savings in the year 
the expenses were paid, rather than wait for a future date. 
</P>
<P>
For the homeowner, the situation is the reverse. Ordinary expenses for repairs 
are not deductible under any circumstances when the repairs are made to your 
principal residence. Thus, to the extent possible, the homeowner wants to treat 
these expenses as capital improvements, thereby permitting those expenses to be 
added to the cost basis of the property. 
</P>
<P>
Many fine lines can be drawn. For example, if the toilet is leaking, and you 
merely repair that toilet, I think there is no question but that this is a 
repair -- and not a capital improvement. But if you replace that same toilet 
with a new one, a good argument can be made that this was a capital improvement 
-- and not merely a repair. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most concise definitions is found in an early tax appeal case where 
it was stated: 
</P>
<P>
"To repair is to restore to a sound state or to mend, while a replacement 
connotes a substitution. A repair is an expenditure for the purpose of keeping 
the property in an ordinarily efficient operating condition. It does not add to 
the value of the property, nor does it appreciably prolong its life. It merely 
keeps the property in an operating condition over its probable useful life for 
the uses for which it was acquired. 
</P>
<P>
"Expenditures for that purpose are distinguishable from those for replacements, 
alterations, improvements or additions that prolong the life of the property, 
increase its value, or make it adaptable to a different use." 
</P>
<P>
Oversimplified, the distinction between a repair and a capital expenditure 
rests on whether the work or construction prolongs the life of -- or adds value 
to -- the property. 
</P>
<P>
As in many tax questions, the matter will be resolved not by a legal 
interpretation, but on the facts of each case. 
</P>
<P>
Some tax court cases have applied the "one-year" rule of thumb. Under this 
theory, an expenditure would be capitalized "if it brings about the acquisition 
of an asset having a period of useful life in excess of one year or if it 
secures a like advantage to the taxpayer, which has a life of more than one 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, in your example, since you replaced the furnace and water heater, and 
they clearly prolong the life of your house for more than one year, I certainly 
feel that you are justified in calling these items improvements and adding 
those costs to your basis. 
</P>
<P>
It is interesting to note that the following items have been determined by 
either the IRS or by a court to be a capital expenditure -- rather than a 
repair: cost of replacing, rearranging and new electrical wiring; basement 
repair and waterproofing costs; burglar alarm installation charges; cost of new 
flooring; cost of replacement of drainage pipes; installation of sea walls; 
cost of replacement and renovation of roof, and costs of window plate-glass 
installation and replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, as you can see, the answer depends on the particular facts. My own 
suggestion is that if you are satisfied that the work you have done to your 
property prolongs the life of your property or adds value to the property, I 
would consider those costs to be capital improvements, thereby adding them to 
the cost basis of your property. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that if you are audited, the burden will be on you to demonstrate 
that these are, in fact, improvements and not merely repairs. 
</P>
<P>
You should also keep all records and bills relating to these improvements. Even 
if you can justify that the replacement of your boiler was clearly a capital 
improvement, if you do not have the bill for this new boiler when you are 
audited, you will have great difficulty having this addition approved.

HOT PROPERTY: MERYL'S CHOICE: HOME ON WESTSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actress MERYL STREEP, a native of New Jersey who has been outspoken about 
liking to live on the East Coast, and her husband, sculptor DONALD GUMMER, have 
bought a house in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We bought here because I got a job here. I never made a movie in Hollywood 
before," she said in a telephone interview from the Burbank set of "Defending 
Your Life," a romantic comedy co-starring Albert Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
Streep, who won Academy Awards in 1982 as best actress in "Sophie's Choice" and 
in 1979 as best supporting actress in "Kramer vs. Kramer," most recently 
co-starred with Roseanne Barr in "She-Devil." 
</P>
<P>
"We were renting (in Santa Monica) and found it hard to live among other 
people's things, so we decided to get a place of our own," she explained. The 
couple have three children. 
</P>
<P>
The Gummers bought a two-story, Spanish-style house on the Westside for 
slightly more than $3 million, real estate sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1972, the 6,469-square-foot house has four bedrooms, 5 1/2 baths, a 
dramatic spiral staircase and electric gates leading into a garden and circular 
driveway. The home also has mountain and canyon views. 
</P>
<P>
"We're planning to go home (to Connecticut)," she said, "but we found this 
(house) as a place where we can stay whenever we come out and I work here 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"We really like Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
GRETA GARBO'S "West Coast residence," where the actress, who died April 15, 
spent her winters for 25 years, is on the market at $2.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Garbo owned considerable real estate at one time in the Beverly Hills area but 
sold it all, including four commercial buildings on Rodeo Drive, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The French Regency-style house, on 3 acres in the Beverly Hills Post Office 
Area, is owned by Anthony Palermo, Garbo's business manager and confidant for 
the last 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
"But for all intents and purposes, it was her house," he said. "She gardened 
and had her roses there." 
</P>
<P>
Palermo bought the home for her to use, he said, after nutritionist Gayelord 
Hauser, Garbo's longtime friend, died in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"When he passed away, the property was in the name of the Gayelord Hauser 
trust," Palermo recalled. "Miss Garbo said to me, 'Gosh, what am I going to do? 
I'm too old to own another house, to have it in my name.' And I said, 'Don't 
worry.' I bought it from the trust so she could come there and be undisturbed." 
</P>
<P>
The three-bedroom, 4,000-square-foot home, built in the '30s, has a guest house 
and a swimming pool. It has been rented, for short periods, by actor Dudley 
Moore and film exec David Putnam. 
</P>
<P>
Palermo put the property on the market for a short time last year when Garbo 
was ill. "But now . . . I'm intent on selling it," he said. It's listed with 
Joe Coons at Rodeo/Prudential Realty.

<P>
CURTIS HENDRIX, the New York entrepreneur who last year relocated to Los 
Angeles and bought the former Sanwa Bank Building -- a 13-story office tower on 
South Flower Street in downtown Los Angeles -- for $135 million, just 
purchased, with a partner, 410 acres in Malibu and an 1,849-acre ranch in San 
Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
Hendrix didn't say how much they paid for the properties but indicated that he 
and his partner will develop them each at a cost in the $50-million range. 
Hendrix's partner is John Paul Jones Dejoria, founder and owner of Paul 
Mitchell Hair Products. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working on something for Malibu that will be helpful in solving some of 
the environmental problems and not create traffic," Hendrix said, adding that 
he should have more details in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 feet of the Malibu property fronts on Pacific Coast Highway, and 
the rest is in Tuna Canyon, less than 2 miles north of Sunset Boulevard. It had 
been owned for 20 years by a doctor and other investors and is divided into 14 
estate sites. 
</P>
<P>
The San Luis Obispo property, known as the Eagle's Nest Ranch, came with zoning 
approvals for an 18-hole golf course and 225-room lodge. 
</P>
<P>
"We're also going to create 16 50- to 100-acre ranchettes with rights to use 
the hotel and golf course," Hendrix said. "We're in the process of submitting 
drawings (to the city)." 
</P>
<P>
While also forming development options for their Malibu property, Dejoria has 
begun construction in Malibu on a 15,000-square-foot, Mediterranean-style 
mansion for himself and his family. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's fast-food founder RAY KROC'S former 204-acre Santa Ynez Valley ranch 
will be open to the public and prospective buyers for the first time Saturday 
and next Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Now owned by the Ronald McDonald Children's Charities, the ranch was developed 
and used by Kroc, who died in 1984, as a country retreat for his family and 
business associates. 
</P>
<P>
It's on the market through Coldwell Banker's Montecito and Santa Barbara 
offices at $11.5 million, reduced from its $14-million asking price when first 
listed last August. 
</P>
<P>
The property includes a 4,700-square-foot owner's residence on a 20-acre 
hilltop; a 15-bedroom guest house; theater, conference/library building, two 
helicopter pads, twin tennis courts, a volleyball court, stables and two 
swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
The ranch can be reached from the Armour Ranch Road exit of Highway 154 in the 
Santa Ynez Valley, after a 22-mile drive over the San Marcos Pass from Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger first baseman EDDIE MURRAY has purchased a new Normandy-style, 
10,000-square-foot house with a private lake and free-standing, 
4,000-square-foot chauffeur's quarters in Sand Canyon at $3.4 million, sources 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Sand Canyon is the wealthy residential area of Canyon Country, southwest of the 
Antelope Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Murray's purchase is believed to be one of the highest sales in the area.

MORTGAGES HELP SLASH UTILITY BILL; 
</P>
<P>
CONSERVATION: LITTLE-KNOWN ENERGY EFFICIENT MORTGAGE PROGRAM IS AVAILABLE TO 
BUYERS WHO WANT TO 'SUPER-WEATHERIZE' THEIR HOMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When Sue Johnson finally found an affordable home in Ontario in 1987, she was 
surprised to learn from the fine print on her appraisal that she could turn the 
drafty house into an energy-efficient one by simply tacking the cost of 
insulation work onto her mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
But when she asked her real estate agent and lender to sign her up for the 
government-backed Energy Efficient Mortgage (EEM) program, she recalled 
recently, "They thought I was nuts. They had never heard of such a thing." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's agent reluctantly agreed to look into the little-known program, and 
the persistent Johnson "spent hours" persuading a wary lender to listen. 
Several days later a VA-backed $2,500 energy loan was added to her $89,950 
mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
The loan allowed Johnson to "super-weatherize" her 1960s-era home using 
state-of-the-art techniques to seal invisible drafts, install top-quality wall 
and ceiling insulation and replace her costly air-conditioner with a 
whole-house fan. 
</P>
<P>
The project added $20 to her monthly mortgage payments, but she came out a 
clear winner, slashing her summer and winter energy bills by more than $40 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
One utility company was so suspicious about the rapid drop in energy use being 
registered at her home "that they replaced my meter to make it tamper-proof," 
Johnson said, with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by the VA, FHA, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Energy Efficient 
Mortgage has been available since 1980 to home buyers and to owners refinancing 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
But because it is virtually unknown to real estate agents, lenders or buyers, 
fewer than 6,000 homeowners in California have signed up, according to experts. 
</P>
<P>
Now a longtime effort to get out the word in California, spearheaded by two 
pioneers in the field of insulating and weatherizing, may finally bear fruit. 
</P>
<P>
The two men, Ray Hall of Upland and Jim Curtis of San Jose, contend that 
California homeowners could save billions of dollars a year if they insulated 
the millions of homes built before 1985, when tough standards for 
energy-efficient construction were adopted in California. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people have attic insulation or some weatherstripping and think 
they're in great shape, but those houses are really incredible energy sieves," 
Hall said. "It's like having four flat tires and changing only one." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the huge energy savings to be had through EEMs -- often 50% reductions 
in energy bills for a household -- Curtis said the biggest obstacle "is in 
training home buyers and real estate agents that these programs even exist." 
</P>
<P>
Curtis, whose Bay Area Energy Consultants firm has retrofitted about 40% of the 
6,000 California homes renovated with EEMs, said, "our basic business is just 
to educate realtors and lenders." 
</P>
<P>
Hall, whose H&amp;L Energy Savers has "super-weatherized" more than 300 homes 
in Southern California, is working with Century 21 and Sears to educate buyers 
about EEMs. 
</P>
<P>
He places much of the blame for the failed program on real estate agents, who, 
he said, "don't want to talk about flaws in a home, like drafts and thin walls, 
so they just ignore the program." 
</P>
<P>
Real estate industry spokesmen see things differently. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Mills, manager of research and policy analysis for the California Assn. of 
Realtors, said EEMs, which vary from agency to agency and whose rules are 
sometimes changed, "are yet another layer of guidelines that make it very 
difficult for realtors to market. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really want to put it all on the realtor, and nobody is really to 
blame. This is a tough thing for the loan officer as well." 
</P>
<P>
To energize the sagging EEM program, Hall and Curtis want the California Energy 
Commission to create a home certification system, loosely akin to the 
certificate now glued to refrigerators, that would test each home and assign a 
grade based on energy efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Curtis, who recently met with Bush Administration officials in 
Washington, wants the various loans made uniform so that agents and lenders 
will stop complaining that the loans are too complex to understand or promote. 
</P>
<P>
Many believe that these two changes, if adopted, could spawn a popular movement 
toward EEMs. In such a scenario, hundreds of thousands of homeowners could reap 
permanent savings of 30% to 50% on their heating and cooling bills while 
helping California cut energy waste and power plant emissions -- a massive 
source of air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Their arguments are not lost on California Energy Commission Chairman Charles 
Embrecht. 
</P>
<P>
Twice in the 1980s, Embrecht purchased a family home. But in neither case was 
he told by his real estate agent or lender about the special loans, he recalled 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
"The federal agencies simply have made no effort to aggressively market these 
loans, nor has the lender or real estate industry," he said. Embrecht believes 
that heavy marketing, combined with a workable home-rating system, could result 
in widespread retrofitting of older homes and dramatic reductions in fossil 
fuel demands from California residences. 
</P>
<P>
Embrecht said the South Coast Air Quality Management District "wants a 30% 
increase in energy efficiency by early in the century, over and above 
everything that's now in place," in state plans. 
</P>
<P>
"We have taken a hard look at that, and the only way that can be accomplished 
is to go after the retrofit market -- the older home." 
</P>
<P>
But what does all this mean to the California homeowner? Plenty, according to 
Embrecht. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question we are talking about everyday people saving billions of 
dollars," he said. "We have already saved $11 billion in lower energy bills 
over the last 15 years because of new building standards, and the potential 
here is just as great." 
</P>
<P>
To prove its potential effects, the commission, the federal Department of 
Energy, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. and the Western Area Power Assn. are 
launching a pilot program this year in which 500 government-repossessed homes 
in the Fresno and San Francisco areas will be tested and rated for energy 
efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
Potential buyers will be informed of the home's "energy grade" and the savings 
possible from retrofitting, and will be shown how to apply for an EEM. 
</P>
<P>
The agencies want to know two things: 
</P>
<P>
Will buyers, once shown the potential savings, ask for an Energy Efficient 
Mortgage? 
</P>
<P>
And will lenders, given proof of lower utility bills, offer that buyer more 
favorable underwriting in California's steep housing market? 
</P>
<P>
"The energy cost is the second-largest cost, on a monthly basis, in home 
ownership," Embrecht said. "For it not to be counted in determining a loan 
makes no sense." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington state, he said, studies showed that the pool of households who 
would qualify for a home loan "grew by 7% to 10% if their reduced utility bills 
were considered as part of their debt ratio." 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the energy commission is seeking proposals for ways to set up a 
statewide home-rating system. Hall and others, who are critical of the 
commission's failure to approve such a plan in the past, point out that many 
states have home-rating systems, and that California is lagging. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Palmer, an industry member of the commission's advisory group on 
residential construction and a technical adviser to the California Building 
Industry Assn., said that while he is encouraged by Embrecht's support, "We 
have seen the commission staff sidetrack this issue in the past, and they could 
do it again." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer criticized the commission's push throughout the 1980s to "dump all the 
rules on new housing, when the really big waste of energy is in the existing 
housing." 
</P>
<P>
According to Curtis and Hall, the roughly 8 million homes built in California 
before 1977 generally have no wall insulation, are riddled with drafts and are 
often less than 50% energy-efficient -- in other words, they use more than 
twice as much energy as is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Homes built from 1977 to 1985, under minimal energy standards, have minor 
insulation but are still energy guzzlers, most experts agree. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, although homes built in California since 1985 are supposed to be 80% 
to 85% energy-efficient, many do not come close. According to state officials, 
a recent study revealed that many builders in California are ignoring the 
tougher 1985 construction standards. 
</P>
<P>
But Mills, of the California Assn. of Realtors, cautioned that even if owners 
of such energy-guzzling homes are "given every chance" to upgrade their houses, 
many will refuse to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if (the program) is streamlined, some will and some won't because they'll 
figure it saves them $20 or $30 a month, and that's not that much if you are 
staying in a home only three years," Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
But Embrecht said that if home buyers cannot be persuaded to embrace EEMs 
voluntarily, the state one day may consider requirements that force them toward 
energy-efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the ideas we are looking at is that a home's energy rating must be 
disclosed as part of resale, which would put a seller of an energy-wasting home 
at a disadvantage in the marketplace," Embrecht said. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously this whole effort is predicated on using market forces and voluntary 
action by the general public, but . . . the global and regional situation may 
ultimately require mandatory rules. "Someday, like emission controls for 
motorists, retrofitting may be something a homeowner will simply be forced to 
accept." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW TO CREATE AN ENERGY-EFFICIENCY HOME 
</P>
<P>
* Stop air infiltration. Cold air in winter and hot air in summer seep into 
homes and account for 40% to 50% of energy waste as homeowners attempt to 
maintain comfortable temperatures. Leaks are detected with a "blower door" 
device that sucks air through homes and identifies all invisible drafts. Worst 
air leakage occurs from ducts, electrical outlet holes, attic hatches, doors 
and windows, fireplaces and leaking cold air returns. 
</P>
<P>
* Insulate walls. Loss of heated and cooled air through walls accounts for 20% 
of energy waste. State code is R-11, but blown-in cellulose will achieve a 
higher R-13 rating. Also helps soundproof home. 
</P>
<P>
* Insulate attic. Loss of heated and cooled air accounts for 20% of energy 
waste. Insulation in Southern California should meet state standard of R-30. In 
colder climates, for instance high mountains, homeowners could benefit from 
R-38. 
</P>
<P>
* Replace air conditioner with whole-house fan. Installed in a ceiling, these 
powerful fans re used at night to suck cool air through open windows and expel 
warmer air through attic. Works best when night temperatures stay below about 
80 degrees. Air cooled at night will keep most well-insulated homes comfortable 
throughout a hot day if windows are kept closed. Whole-house fans cost 3 1/2 
cents an hour to operate. Air conditioners cost 60 to 80 cents an hour. 
</P>
<P>
* Tune-up and clean heater and air conditioner. Do this annually. Savings vary. 
</P>
<P>
Replace any water heater older than 10 years, and wrap with insulating blanket. 
Accounts for about 2% to 3% of energy waste. 
</P>
<P>
* Floor insulation is probably not needed in Southern California, representing 
about 5% of energy waste but costing a good deal to install. 
</P>
<P>
* The goal in insulating a house is to reduce the speed with which the air 
inside is exchanged with the hot summer air or cold winter air outside. Typical 
older California homes lose an entire houseful of air every single hour, 
forcing homeowners to continually reheat or recool the new air. In 
"super-weatherizing," the goal is to lose only one-half houseful of air per 
hour.

Several years ago we gave the Pelican Inn four hearts for romance. When the fog 
rolls in, the proprietor stokes the fire and guests slip off to rooms with 
half-tester beds. It's like waking up at a pleasant inn on the coast of 
Britain. Because of its popularity, early reservations are necessary. 
Especially on weekends. Worth the stop, though, even if you can't get a room. 
The Pelican's restaurant serves breakfast, lunch, dinner.

SYMBOL OF DENMARK AGAIN IS VANDALIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the world's most popular statues, the bronze figure of the Little 
Mermaid that looks out over Copenhagen harbor, has been vandalized again. 
</P>
<P>
The 76-year-old statue, created by Erik Eriksen in tribute to Danish 
storyteller Hans Christian Andersen, depicts a winsome mermaid gazing pensively 
over the water from her perch atop a rock. 
</P>
<P>
Last week a seven-inch cut, apparently made with a hacksaw, was discovered in 
the back of the statue's neck. No motive for the vandalism was known and no 
suspects were in custody. 
</P>
<P>
The statue, which is easily accessible on Langelinie Quay, is visited by about 
500,000 tourists a year and has become a Danish national symbol. 
</P>
<P>
The Little Mermaid has been the target of vandals before. The original head was 
stolen in 1964 and was replaced by a new one cast from the original mold. In 
1984 an arm was taken, but it was found and reattached. The mermaid has also 
been marred by graffiti and paint, and one prankster painted a pink brassiere 
on her. 
</P>
<P>
The damage will not be permanent. Repair work, which could involve temporary 
removal of the statue and its rock base or building scaffolding around the 
statue, is being planned. 
</P>
<P>
Although Copenhagen is in charge of its maintenance, commercial rights to the 
Little Mermaid statue are owned by Eriksen's descendants, who earn royalties of 
about $750,000 a year from the work. 
</P>
<P>
The Litter of the Law: If you plan on visiting Spain this summer and find 
yourself on the Costa Brava, don't even think of tossing aside those empty soft 
drink cans or simply dropping that ice cream wrapper on the street or sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to reduce the litter problem caused largely by tourists, Spanish 
police have been given authority to fine violators $75, payable right on the 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
Rials and Dinars: Those are the monetary units in Iran, and if you didn't know 
that, you probably aren't concerned that Tehran has been judged to be the most 
expensive city in the world. 
</P>
<P>
According to the latest of those international surveys that compare cities by 
the cost of goods and services, the Iranian capital came in first for the 
second year in a row, largely because of an overvalued currency. 
</P>
<P>
Tehran is followed by Tokyo and Libreville, the capital of Gabon in West 
Africa, according to a survey by Corporate Resources Group, a private 
consulting firm. Oslo remained Europe's most expensive city for the third 
straight year, followed closely by Helsinki, Zurich, Geneva and Copenhagen. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a continuous decline in currencies that tended to neutralize soaring 
inflation, Latin American cities rank among the least expensive. 
</P>
<P>
About a decade ago Buenos Aires was the world's most expensive city. Today it 
ranks among the cheapest, only slightly above Quito, Ecuador, which the survey 
said is the world's least expensive city. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese Jungle: Tired of the big-city hustle and bustle when visiting Tokyo? 
Escape is easy. Just half an hour's drive from the city center is an oasis 
where visitors can lose themselves amid 4,280 tropical and subtropical plants. 
</P>
<P>
The Yumenoshima Tropical Plant Dome is built on 5,400 square feet of reclaimed 
land built on waste in Tokyo. High tropical temperatures are maintained by heat 
piped in from a nearby trash processing plant. 
</P>
<P>
The attraction, which opened last year, was built over a two-year period and 
cost $18 million. 
</P>
<P>
Airport Security: Two thermal neutron analysis bomb detectors are expected to 
be fully operational in time for the peak tourist season, according to the 
Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Before the end of June one is to be installed at the concourse at London's 
Gatwick Airport (a security area serving several U.S. carriers), and the other 
at the United Airlines area at Washington's Dulles Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The detectors are the third and fourth devices in a series of six. The first 
two were installed at the TWA terminal at New York's Kennedy International 
Airport and Pan Am's terminal in Miami. The devices are said to detect all 
non-commercial explosives, including plastic explosives.

PONDERING THE POLITICS OF REVOLUTION IN PRAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My daughter, Kathy, and I frequently travel together to places that are 
politically interesting. So this year, on her spring break from college, we 
decided it was time to head for the site of one of the most fascinating 
political stories of our time -- Eastern Europe -- freed just months before 
from 45 years of Communist rule. There would be no better place to witness this 
change, we agreed, than Prague. 
</P>
<P>
The capital of Czechoslovakia is in a festive mood these days. Pictures of 
Tomas Masaryk, who founded the Czech Republic in 1918, and of Vaclav Havel, the 
country's new playwright president, decorate countless store windows. The good 
cheer and friendliness of the citizens make this glorious old city, with its 
medieval monuments and narrow, twisting streets, more attractive to tourists 
than it has been since before World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The best place to catch the spirit of the revolution is in the center of the 
city in Wenceslas Square, where last November's demonstrations prompted the 
fall of the hard-line regime. There, crowds of students and political activists 
still like to debate the country's future with visitors who are inclined to 
join in. 
</P>
<P>
At one end of the square, the base of the statue of St. Wenceslas, the 
country's patron saint, is covered with all kinds of signs, ranging from 
congratulations from students abroad to exhortations by new political parties. 
Candles burn at an impromptu people's memorial a few feet away, where the 
student Jan Palach immolated himself in protest against the 1968 crushing of 
the "Prague Spring" by Soviet troops. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Wenceslas Square, which also happens to be the most fashionable 
shopping area, Prague's finest sightseeing place is exotic Hradcany Castle, 
sometimes called Prague Castle, where the kings of Bohemia once lived and Havel 
has his offices today. Unlike other Czech presidents, Havel doesn't live at the 
castle but instead retains his modest apartment in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Also fascinating are the Old Town Square, the 14th-Century Charles Bridge with 
its esoteric collection of 30 statues and the old Jewish ghetto with its 
remarkable cemetery. All are just across the Vltava River in the Stare Mesto or 
Old Town section and within walking distance of each other. 
</P>
<P>
Central Prague is well served by the subway, with trains every two minutes, and 
an extensive network of streetcar lines making the city particularly accessible 
to walking and public transportation exploration. 
</P>
<P>
Most of central Prague is off limits to ordinary passenger cars, so we parked 
our car at our hotel and relied on public transportation or walking. 
</P>
<P>
We were not disappointed by our walks, even when they were uphill, as was the 
trek to Hradcany Castle. 
</P>
<P>
On a hilltop high above the Vltava River, the 1,100-year-old castle is home to 
government offices, museums, palaces and the famous spires of St. Vitus 
Cathedral, where Czech kings were crowned and where a ceremony was held 
honoring Havel on his inauguration day, marking the end of Communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
On Golden Lane, just inside the castle walls, a collection of 17th Century 
tradesmen's cottages are notable for their architecture if not for their 
souvenir contents. Famed author Franz Kafka, who knew something about 
bureaucratic tyranny, once wrote in one of the cottages. 
</P>
<P>
It is about a mile from the castle to the historic wonders of Old Town. But 
before you descend, gaze down for a wonderful view of the narrow streets and 
broad squares of both the Male Strana section below the castle and Old Town 
across the river. Beer halls, wine bars, coffee houses and, during the summer, 
sidewalk cafes offer pleasant places to take a break. 
</P>
<P>
Separating the castle and Old Town is the Charles Bridge. Built by Charles IV, 
a Holy Roman Emperor who governed from Prague, the pedestrian walkway is lined 
with an odd assortment of statues of saints and national heroes. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone will have his favorite sites in what is truly a beautiful city and one 
spared serious damage during World War II. Ours were the tiny house where Kafka 
wrote, and the Jewish cemetery a block from the Inter-Continental Hotel. Its 
gravestones, hundreds tumbling over one another, have been described as one of 
the 10 great historic sights of the world, a description that is not much of an 
exaggeration. 
</P>
<P>
Next to the cemetery is a small museum and art gallery featuring paintings of 
doomed Jewish children imprisoned at Terezinstadt, a Nazi concentration camp on 
the highway from Prague to the German border. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy and I visited Prague at the end of March and stayed in the warm and 
comfortable Esplanade Hotel just a block from Wenceslas Square. 
</P>
<P>
Cedok, the Czech national tourist agency with offices in New York, sold us a 
room at the Esplanade Hotel for $172 a night that was payable, as are all 
hotels, in hard Western currency. This hard-currency rule is strictly enforced, 
and the system for retaining rooms causes lodging to be the only expensive part 
of a Prague stay. 
</P>
<P>
Cedok wanted as much as $300 a night for the fancier Palace Hotel, more than 
$200 for the Inter-Continental and similar prices for other top hotels. But 
when we arrived at the Esplanade we were told that if we had walked in off the 
street its rooms would have been less than $25 a night. 
</P>
<P>
One of Kathy's classmates was in Prague at the same time, and his family 
managed to get such a low rate by paying the higher reserved rate for the first 
few nights and then looking around. 
</P>
<P>
But this summer, with most hotels fully booked by Cedok or tourist agencies 
doing business with Cedok, such a tactic could be foolish. (Prague has only 
6,000 hotel rooms, with 1,500 more under construction. With airlines flying 
into the city reportedly nearly filled to capacity, next fall is probably a 
better time for a visit.) 
</P>
<P>
The Esplanade has a reasonably good restaurant, just as Prague has many such 
restaurants, usually easy to reserve for dinner and open at lunch. We found 
that once we went through the top three or four dishes offered, we had pretty 
much exhausted the country's culinary repertoire, which is heavy on pork, beef 
and duck dishes, all with dumplings. 
</P>
<P>
The prices are right, however. No dinner was more than $10, and excellent 
Pilsen and other Czechoslovak beer is 20 cents or less. 
</P>
<P>
We had two meals at the Three Ostriches restaurant at the western end of the 
Charles Bridge. Regarded as the city's best, it wasn't all that elaborate but 
the food was good, the service very good and the prices stuck to the $10 per 
person standard. The luncheon menu is the same as dinner. The Three Ostriches 
also has a few hotel rooms and would be an excellent place to stay if space 
were available. It certainly is worth asking Cedok about. 
</P>
<P>
Also a good buy is excellent Russian caviar, which can be bought on the street 
here for ridiculously low prices -- $10 or $15 for two ounces -- if the buyer 
is willing to pay in U.S. dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Despite advance reports, we found few people in Prague who spoke English. 
German is more common. 
</P>
<P>
Visas are necessary and were obtainable through the embassy in Washington, 
D.C., for $35 when we went. But as we were concerned about convenience and the 
safety of our passports in the mail, we chose to use a service that got us our 
visas within a few days. The service -- Visas International, 3169 Barbara 
Court, Los Angeles 90069 -- uses Federal Express to speed passports to and from 
the Czechoslovak Embassy in Washington, D.C., and charged $95 for two. Visas 
were also available at the Czech border when we went through, and all tourist 
visas may soon be issued that way. 
</P>
<P>
Western newspapers were available on a same-day basis in Prague, but apparently 
at only one central store on Jungmannova Street two blocks from Wenceslas 
Square. Expect long lines and about a 20-minute wait to get a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
But there is little time for reading on a visit to Prague. The walks are 
wonderful; the atmosphere, crossing the Charles Bridge, making our way up the 
steep streets a short distance to Hradcany Castle, as well as in many other 
places, was superb. Prague in its own way offers vistas nearly as impressive as 
those of Paris or Florence. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the city there are many excursions of a day or half a day. Some of 
them, such as to Lidice, the village whose inhabitants were massacred by the 
Nazis as a reprisal for the assassination of a Gestapo chief, or Terezinstadt, 
are reminiscent of Czechoslovakia's tragic history of the past half century. 
</P>
<P>
Sadness lingers for the past, but in Prague today's mood is upbeat, hopes are 
high, and we felt lucky to have been here at such a historically important 
time.

<P>
DESPITE BERLIN REPUTATION, IT IS POSSIBLE TO FEAST IN THE EAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS, Andrews writes The Times' Restaurant Notebook column and is 
author of Catalan Cuisine (Atheneum, $24.95). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everybody talks about East Berlin these days, but nobody has dinner there -- 
not if they can help it, at least. 
</P>
<P>
Gastronomy is not an art which, in general, has flourished under communism. A 
visitor to West Berlin might very well pass through what's left of the Wall to 
visit the east's extraordinary museums, to stroll through the historic quarter 
of the old city, even to buy bargain-priced German-language books or Dresden 
china. But pop through Checkpoint Charlie for a nosh? Not bloody likely. 
</P>
<P>
Be that as it may, it is quite possible to eat decently in East Berlin, 
especially in the sector's several recently opened luxury hotels. By far the 
most spectacular of these is the 350-room Grand Hotel, built by a Japanese 
consortium in 1987 at a reported cost of $130 million. 
</P>
<P>
When it was launched, the director of West Berlin's Hotel and Restaurant Guild 
was quoted as saying, "We have no establishment that matches it in West Berlin, 
and you will be hard put to find one on a similar level anywhere in West 
Germany." Indeed, prices at the Grand are as high as those in any West Berlin 
hotel, and only West German marks and other hard currencies are accepted. 
</P>
<P>
The Grand was, for its first few years of life, a favorite gathering place and 
listening post for the Stasi, the East German secret police. A West 
Berlin-based travel agent I met recently in the city told me that one day in 
January he had been walking by the hotel and was surprised to find it 
temporarily closed. Seeing a workman near an open window, he asked what was 
going on. "We're getting rid of the bugs," replied the workman, meaning the 
kind of bugs that give ears to walls. 
</P>
<P>
Today, it's hard to imagine anything so sinister as electronic eavesdropping at 
the Grand. Built around an understated but elegant six-story atrium that 
recalls (of all things) Denver's venerable Brown Palace Hotel, the Grand offers 
guests such amenities as a beauty parlor, an array of chic shops (one with a 
display of Vanderbilt perfume in the window), special accommodations for 
nonsmokers and for the disabled, mini-bars, color TVs (with MTV available), 
limousine service, a complete health center (including pool, saunas, massage 
parlor and squash courts) and, not counting several breakfast rooms and bars, 
six restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Among the restaurants are Forellen Quintett ("Trout Quintet"), which serves 
trout and other specialties of the Spree River basin; Zur Goldenen Gans ("The 
Golden Goose"), which features dishes of the Thuringian Forest region, and 
Stammhaus Kindl, a casual tavern with a good choice of both East and West 
Berlin-area beers. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel's top-floor, top-of-the-line restaurant, Le Grand Restaurant 
Silhouette, was closed for a private party the evening I was there, but I did 
sneak a look at the dining room (heavy-handed mock-art nouveau, with impressive 
views of both East and West Berlin) and at the menu. 
</P>
<P>
The last was a surprise, offering such contemporary-sounding delicacies as 
terrine of pike perch, trout and smoked eel with chive mousse; cream of beet 
root soup with shredded duck breast; snail ravioli with tarragon sauce; stewed 
venison with juniper cream, baby chanterelles and green noodles and cinnamon 
ice cream with praline sauce. 
</P>
<P>
I ended up dining in yet another of the Grand's restaurants: the Restaurant 
Coelln. Named for an ancient village at the heart of Old Berlin, the Coelln is 
a long, warmly-lit second-story dining room with an ornate white ceiling, 
beautifully set tables and expensive-looking if ultimately rather ugly chairs 
with gray false-bamboo frames and pink-and-gray seashell-pattern upholstery. 
</P>
<P>
From the extensive menu there's even a section of international specialties, 
including oxtail soup (representing England), trout sashimi with wasabi (Japan) 
and lobster Newburg (North America, with the dish itself rather dauntingly 
described on the English-language menu as "lobster simmered in Tabasco sauce"). 
</P>
<P>
I selected excellent house-smoked salmon to begin, simply served with wheat 
toast and butter. Then I had a Berliner specialty called Gelbe Loffelerbsen: a 
large cup of absolutely delicious yellow split pea soup flavored with onion and 
caraway seed and served with a freshly baked cracked wheat roll spread with 
sweet pork fat full of little shreds of pork as a perfect accompaniment to the 
soup. 
</P>
<P>
My main course, identified on the menu as a "Grand Hotel Spezialitat," was 
medallions of venison marinated in cognac and cooked rare, but which 
unfortunately remained extremely tough and dry. 
</P>
<P>
I liked the accompaniments, though: caramelized grapefruit segments and a crisp 
potato cake faintly perfumed with ginger. The dessert selection was 
disappointing (commercial made ice cream and a few sad-looking fruit tarts and 
pastries), so I abstained. 
</P>
<P>
But the wine list was astonishing. There was a large selection of good German 
wines, from the West, of course. Although there is a limited amount of wine 
made from state-owned vineyards in East Germany, they are reportedly never very 
good, and 1989 was such a bad year that even the best producers made no wine. 
</P>
<P>
But there were also numerous good bottles from Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, 
Switzerland, Spain, Italy and France, the last including multiple vintages of 
Chateau Lafite, Chateau Petrus and Burgundies from both the Hospices de Beaune 
and the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, all at prices competitive with those in 
West Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
If the Coelln and Le Grand Restaurant Silhouette represent contemporary upscale 
dining in East Berlin, I wondered, what were the more old-fashioned "fancy" 
places like? On the recommendation of both the West German food and wine 
magazine Feinschmecker ("Epicure") and the concierge at the Grand, I had lunch 
at Ermeler Haus to find out. 
</P>
<P>
In the early years of this century, what is now Ermeler Haus was the private 
residence of Berlin's most famous tobacconist, Ferdinand Wilhelm Ermeler. (A 
popular song of the period went, "Wo kommt der best tabak her?/Merk auf, mein 
freund, von Ermeler!": "Whence comes the best tobacco here?/Take note, my 
friend, from Ermeler!"). 
</P>
<P>
A solid sort of high-bourgeois mansion with lovely rococo-style interior 
molding and painted ceilings, it was moved a few hundred yards from its 
original site after World War II and turned into an upscale eating place. 
</P>
<P>
Long patronized mostly by East German government and Communist Party officials, 
visiting dignitaries and hard-currency businessmen, Ermeler Haus retains at 
least some of the trappings of old-school, non-socialist formality. The 
tableware is admittedly cheap stainless steel and the glasses are merely 
utilitarian, but the waiters wear black tie and tails, and there are fresh 
flowers and rich white linen napery on the undersize tables. 
</P>
<P>
The dining rooms are ornamented with sparkly crystal chandeliers and with 
Oriental rugs on the creaky but well-polished hardwood floors. And one small 
salon, with both walls and ceiling painted in a superbly-rendered trompe-l'oeil 
rose-arbor motif, is as beautiful as any room in any old-style luxury 
restaurant in France. 
</P>
<P>
The food is hardly up to French standards, though. I started with a milky, oily 
onion soup with one small, cheese-covered crouton floating in it. (And that was 
the only bread I saw throughout the meal.) Next, at my waiter's recommendation, 
I chose pork loin with sauce bearnaise. 
</P>
<P>
A kitchen poor in resources tends to overuse what it does have. Thus, what 
turned out to be a pretty good piece of pork was topped not just with a 
credible bearnaise but with a spoonful of salmon caviar (!) and was accompanied 
by potato croquettes in an almond crust, a heap of sauteed mushrooms, half a 
poached pear with red currant sauce and a scattering of pickled vegetables, a 
case of what I'm tempted to call the too-much-of-nothing school of garnish. 
</P>
<P>
Dessert was similarly overloaded. Icy homemade vanilla ice cream studded with 
almond slivers and served with canned, flambe bitter cherries, a dose of cherry 
liqueur, a heap of whipped cream and a scattering of chocolate sprinkles. 
</P>
<P>
Uninspiring though it might have been, I must admit that the cooking at Ermeler 
Haus, in terms of pure technical correctness if not of imagination, was just 
fine. I've had worse meals in "continental" restaurants in the United States, 
and with the East German mark then at roughly 5 to the dollar (even from the 
cashier at the Grand), my meal, with mineral water, coffee and a bottle of 
passable German wine, cost only about $16. 
</P>
<P>
But why eat in an East Berlin restaurant when the infinitely more practiced and 
opulently provendered eating places of the West are now just a 10- or 15-minute 
taxi ride and a no-hassle border crossing away? 
</P>
<P>
Good question. Maybe because you're spending the day in East Berlin and don't 
feel like hopscotching all over the large, two-part municipality just to have a 
bite of lunch. Or maybe just for the delicious irony of eating an elaborate 
meal with Western European wines and friendly service in the capital of what 
has until recently been one of the most notorious satrapies of the "Evil 
Empire."

FOOTLOOSE: VERMONT HAS MUCH MORE TO OFFER THAN JUST WINTER SKIING ACTIVITIES 
</P>

WAITSFIELD, Vt. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this day of resorts that try to blend into the scenery but all too often 
fail, it's comforting to find one that's known worldwide yet doesn't have so 
much as a post office. 
</P>
<P>
Sugarbush is near Waitsfield. It's also near Warren, Mad Valley Glen, Irasville 
and other places you probably never heard of unless you're a dedicated skier. 
</P>
<P>
Vermont's Green Mountains hide many resorts in their great stands of beech, 
birch, elm, maple and poplar. Sugarbush once had the reputation of being the 
most chic for crowds bent on showing off the very latest in glitzy ski wear. So 
much so that its most popular skiing area earned the nickname "Mascara 
Mountain." 
</P>
<P>
Although the ski-to-be-seen set is still around, Sugarbush has become a 
year-round family resort where horseback riding, hiking, tennis, golf, 
sailplane soaring and the fall influx of foliage seekers account for most of 
its visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Getting here: Fly USAir, United or Continental to Burlington, Vt., for about 
$405-$468 round trip, depending upon advance-purchase and day of week flown. 
The bus service isn't the greatest, so plan on driving to Sugarbush in about an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? Most visitors stay at least a week, winter or summer. Make 
reservations early for foliage season. Many inns here quote prices based on 
half-pension, but they're still moderate. Ski-season costs usually climb from 
those mentioned below. The end of March through April are considered the "mud 
months" in New England and should be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled in: The Inn at Round Barn Farm (Box 247, Waitsfield 05673; 
$85-$125 B&amp;B double) sits beside a round barn built in 1910 and is one of 
Vermont's few remaining examples of this Shaker structure. Recently opened as 
an inn, the main house and grounds are a symphony of flowers. Of the six rooms, 
all with bath, two have Jacuzzis, two have canopied beds and each has handmade 
quilts and wall stenciling. 
</P>
<P>
The Waitsfield Inn (Box 969, Waitsfield 05673; $100-$130 double, half-pension) 
has stood since 1825, with the common room an old barn added a decade later. 
It's a spread out and informal place, with the former barn now warmed by a 
fireplace, original planked flooring, bookcases and comfortable couches. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the bedrooms have lofts, handcarved wooden beds and beamed ceilings. 
Dining is a combination of continental and traditional Vermont, with a choice 
of main courses at dinner. A simple wine list also is available. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker Hill Lodge (Box 147, Waitsfield 05673; $130-$178 double, half-pension) 
has gained national acclaim for its cozy atmosphere and magnificent food. It's 
set on a wooded hillside surrounded by stone walls and English gardens, and has 
a pool and tennis courts. 
</P>
<P>
The simple and rustic bedrooms have rag rugs in bright colors, oak furniture 
and old-fashioned coverlets on the beds. And there's a separate 1805 farmhouse 
with handhewn beams and fireplace that's suitable for a family or two or three 
couples who want privacy, with their own garden and mountain stream. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: One of the things that jumps out at you about Vermont 
dining is the superior quality of the veal and turkey. Look for both on menus. 
</P>
<P>
Many inns and restaurants make good use of the fiddlehead ferns, wild leeks and 
the blueberries, raspberries and strawberries that seem to blanket the state. 
You'll find the berries and their jams and jellies sold at roadside stands 
throughout the season. 
</P>
<P>
Maple syrup and wonderful Cheddar cheeses are Vermont staples, with apple cider 
the only indigenous drink. 
</P>
<P>
Good dining: Millbrook Lodge (Vermont 17, Waitsfield) has an atmospheric dining 
room in an 1850 building crammed with antiques and original art. Just about 
everything is homemade here, including the breads and pastas. Many vegetables 
come from the inn's garden. Millbrook does all sorts of veal dishes in 
marvelous ways, plus chicken, seafood and pastas. Meal prices $11 to about $17. 
</P>
<P>
Beggars Banquet (Vermont 100, Waitsfield 05673) is an unpretentious place, yet 
has an open terrace surrounded by flower beds for summer dining. Expect good 
homemade soups, generous salads and hearty sandwiches. There's a full dinner 
menu, and Sunday night's specialty is Mexican food. 
</P>
<P>
The dining room at Tucker Hill Lodge is small and romantic. Try the ravioli of 
house-made pasta filled with rabbit flavored with Pommery mustard, shallots, 
honey and thyme, or perhaps the Maine Spinney Creek oysters. Then select from a 
menu that includes fresh New England bluefish grilled and served with a saute 
of tomato fillets, red onion and garlic, finished with fresh-basil butter and 
steamed lobster claws. Or choose the farm-raised partridge grilled and served 
on a bed of fresh fava beans, summer cabbage and julienne of ham. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: Summer activities in the Waitsfield-Sugarbush area include trout 
fishing, canoeing, bicycling, outdoor concerts, antique and covered-bridge 
stalking, folk-music festivals, horse shows and gymkhanas. 
</P>
<P>
Sugarbush Village also has a sports center featuring indoor-outdoor pools, 
squash courts, whirlpools, indoor tennis courts, saunas, massage rooms and 20 
Universal and Nautilus rigs for the really dedicated. 
</P>
<P>
Or you may just sit on a mountainside, do a little bird watching and rest up 
for ski season. 
</P>
<P>
For more information, call the Sugarbush Chamber of Commerce toll-free at (800) 
828-4748, or write to Box 173, Waitsfield 05673, for a brochure on Sugarbush, 
another on coming events, plus other information you might need.

PUERTO RICO IS BEGINNING TO LIVE UP TO ITS NAME

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Debarking from the cruise ship that had brought me to this Caribbean island, I 
found myself on a large wharf surrounded by people catering to the needs of 
arriving cruise passengers. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you need a taxi?" a cabbie asked. "No," I said. "I'm just going to La 
Princesa." 
</P>
<P>
"Ah," he said with a smile, "you're on your way to jail." 
</P>
<P>
I must admit I didn't get the joke until I walked the few blocks to the 
restored building that is now the headquarters of all Puerto Rican tourism. 
</P>
<P>
La Princesa, polished and painted and restored, was built in 1837. However, 
Miguel Domenich, executive director of Puerto Rican Tourist Co., proves it was 
once a jail by escorting visitors to the small, rusted old cells that once were 
the quarters of prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Although it still is reputed to be the local jail, La Princesa expects this 
Spanish colonial building to set the style for historic old San Juan. Skylights 
let sunlight through to its polished floors and tropical plantings add color to 
its painted walls and to the stone cliffs that back against its spacious 
courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
La Princesa, however, is just the beginning. On the drawing boards is a 
tree-lined promenade, the paseo, that in other days stretched the short blocks 
to the port. Public areas for dances, concerts and festivals also are part of 
the master plan. So is a fisherman's pier and fish market. The famed rums of 
Puerto Rico will have their own shop. 
</P>
<P>
More than 800,000 passengers arrived in San Juan last year, and future 
estimates indicate the trend is up. 
</P>
<P>
The waterfront master plan, with its $7.6-million initial offering, is full of 
major projects that in 1992 will celebrate the 500th anniversary of Columbus' 
arrival in the New World. 
</P>
<P>
La Princesa, originally inaugurated on the birth date of Princess Asturias of 
Spain in 1837, had been closed for 13 years. However, with its huge mahogany 
doors and gleaming brass, it hardly looks like a former prison. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 3 million visitors last year saw El Morro, the fortress built in 1540, 
La Fortaleza, the oldest executive mansion in continuous use in the New World, 
and the Casa Blanca, built for Ponce de Leon, the island's first governor. 
</P>
<P>
In the last five years more than $500 million has been invested by hotel 
companies. There is the giant one-mile swim-way that went into Hyatt's Cerromar 
and the total remake of the Normandie by the Radisson chain. Handy to the 
Caribe Hilton, the Normandie was built in the shape of the ill-fated but 
celebrated ship of the French Line. 
</P>
<P>
It remained unused for years but has been turned into a gem that would please 
the French wife of Feliz Rexach Benitez, who built this Art Deco masterpiece 
for her. 
</P>
<P>
The Normandie reopened last year with 180 rooms, 115 of them Art Deco suites. 
The $17-million restoration includes the Normandie restaurant that serves 
everything from sliced baby squid over linguine to stuffed pig's foot in 
Madeira sauce with steamed cabbage. A profiterolle mousse in papaya sauce gives 
it a French and a Puerto Rican flavor. 
</P>
<P>
A Day's Inn has opened 120 rooms in Ponce, and Puerto Rico will get its own 
Ritz Carlton in Palmas del Mar. Also, El Conquistador, long asleep, will awaken 
with 900 rooms, a golf course, a marina, a convention center and a spa. 
</P>
<P>
Near the Conquistador in Fajardo, which is an hour's drive from the airport, 
will be the $350-million Puerto de Rey Marina and Beach Resort. The first 
phase, with a marina larger than any on the U.S. Eastern seaboard, is open. A 
harborside inn is due next year. It will be followed by a 325-room hotel, 1,000 
condominiums, a golf course and tennis and beach clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Here architects returned to the original idea of King Carlos of Spain who sent 
explorers, engineers and architects to the island in the 16th Century. 
</P>
<P>
They envisioned a Mediterranean adapted to the West Indies with waterfront 
towns huddling around plazas. If your yacht is no larger than 200 feet, there 
will be room to accommodate it and 700 others. 
</P>
<P>
On the northwest coast near the town of Isabella, Costa Isabella, the largest 
recreational project ever conceived in these parts, is under way, headed by 
Charlie Passarell Jr., the former Puerto Rican tennis star. 
</P>
<P>
A $1-billion, 2,500-acre vacation and residential complex, Costa Isabella has 
already involved Four Seasons Hotels, Conrad International and the Marbella 
Club of Spain, all to be built around a 19th-Century-style Spanish village. 
Ultimately, Costa Isabella could have up to 2,000 hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Puerto Rico is becoming rich. Just how rich, however, its 
discoverers never imagined.

TOURS: SOME COMPANIES MAY MAKE INDIVIDUAL REFUNDS FOR UNUSED PORTIONS OF A

A woman on a motor-coach tour in Europe left the tour to mail some post cards 
in Florence, but afterward couldn't find her way back. After waiting for nearly 
two hours and notifying the police of her absence, the tour escort finally 
decided to continue to Rome without her. 
</P>
<P>
Left without a tour, the woman took a train on her own to Rome, and then a taxi 
to the hotel her group was staying in. Upon return to the United States she 
asked the tour operator for a reimbursement on her train and taxi expenses. 
</P>
<P>
In another case a man didn't see the tour operator's representative at the 
airport in Paris and missed the transfer bus to his tour group's hotel. He took 
a taxi to the hotel and afterward asked for a refund of his expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Due to a delay in departure of a flight from the United States, a tour group 
missed its first night in London, in still another case. Several in the group 
sought a refund on the cost of their unused hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
These three refund requests received by Los Angeles-based Brendan Tours are 
representative of the kind of complaints that all tour operators get at one 
time or another. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how they were resolved: 
</P>
<P>
"While the woman who missed her motor coach in Florence tried to hold us 
responsible, it was really her fault and so her extra costs weren't 
recoverable," Chuck Winn, manager-special services of Brendan Tours, said. 
</P>
<P>
"But let's say this same traveler had to suddenly go to the hospital or a 
doctor and missed her departure from Florence to Rome, and then got to Rome and 
the hotel on her own," Winn said. "As a good will gesture, we would probably 
pay part of her costs. Each case turns on the individual circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
The traveler who missed his airport-hotel transfer bus received a refund, Winn 
said. "It's likely it was the traveler's fault. He may have been tired after 
the flight, but we usually give our clients the benefit of the doubt. 
</P>
<P>
"The amount of money involved is usually small. But if the traveler had to get 
to his hotel from an especially distant airport, say Gatwick to London, it 
might be a different story." 
</P>
<P>
Tour operators commit themselves to a certain number of hotel rooms. By buying 
in volume they can get lower prices than the individual traveler can. But if 
people on a tour don't turn up, the hotel still may impose a no-show fee. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people don't understand this," Winn said. "Since the reason for the 
flight delay was beyond our control, we didn't make any refunds on the unused 
hotel rooms in London." 
</P>
<P>
Another common situation is when a member of a tour decides not to attend a 
scheduled event, such as a dinner or theater show. 
</P>
<P>
The tour operator, which may deal with as many as 25 companies, including 
airlines, hotels, motor coach operators and restaurants during a two- or 
three-week tour, is generally not obligated to refund unusued portions of 
tours. However, some do refund unusued portions of tours. Some operators may 
even refund an unused land arrangement if they can recover their costs from the 
businesses they deal with abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The tour operator agrees only to provide the basic tour elements such as 
transportation, hotels and sightseeing. Brochures generally will list in their 
last few pages what the tour operator is offering and what its responsibilities 
are. 
</P>
<P>
"We generally don't offer refunds of services that are regular features of a 
tour that people don't avail themselves of," Winn said. "These are prepaid by 
us and we usually don't get a refund for no-shows from the local organizations 
we work with. But again, it depends on the circumstances. Some costs of unusued 
services may be recoverable." 
</P>
<P>
Cruise lines also evaluate complaints from passengers on an individual basis. 
Some common complaints revolve around seating requests in the dining rooms, 
what cabins do and don't include and location of the staterooms. 
</P>
<P>
For example, some passengers fail to find their cabins on the deck plans in 
brochures and afterward complain about how close they are to dining areas, 
discos and other public areas. 
</P>
<P>
"Some problems come from Love Boat expectations," said Pat Biederman, manager 
of passenger services for Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines. "They see a suite 
in the rooms shown on the TV show and don't expect the size of the cabins the 
get. They also don't expect to get a nautical-size bed in their cabins." 
</P>
<P>
Air-sea cruises are another problem area. Sometimes passengers don't check 
their air tickets to see what time their plane arrives at the port of 
embarkation and what time they can board their ship. These interim periods are 
sometimes a source of confusion and frustration that can be avoided by 
carefully reading the information provided in advance of departure. 
</P>
<P>
"At least half of the complaints come from not reading the brochures and other 
cruise material," said Bruce Setloff, director of passenger service for San 
Francisco-based Royal Cruise Line. "Some passengers don't turn in a first- or 
second-sitting dining request in advance of sailing and wait until they board 
the ship. Then they don't like the sitting or seat they're assigned." 
</P>
<P>
Shore excursions can be another troublesome area. "One of our ships was in 
Belem, Brazil, and the shore excursion was named Jungle Cruise. Its description 
indicated there was a lot of walking involved. 
</P>
<P>
"Some passengers thought it would be more of a Disneyland experience. There was 
real mud as it rained, and one passenger asked for her money back. As a good 
will gesture she received a $100 credit to be applied to a future cruise with 
us." 
</P>
<P>
As with tours, the best policy is to let shipboard personnel know about 
problems when they crop up, not at the end of the cruise or after you get home. 
</P>
<P>
"One passenger wanted a refund for the difference between a cabin with a bath 
and one that only offered a shower, as the stopper was missing from her tub," 
Setloff said. "But she waited until turning in her comment card at the end of 
the cruise to tell us. She also received a credit toward her next cruise. 
Basically, we feel keeping the client happy is the most important value." 
</P>
<P>
While travel outfits may make good will gestures to placate repeat customers 
and those likely to be repeat clients, you obviously can't depend on this 
treatment. Your best bet is to register your complaint when the situation 
arises. There may be an immediate solution. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid ever having recourse to a customer/passenger relations manager, start 
with reading brochures and other documents carefully so that you know precisely 
what comes with your specific travel arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Brochures are primarily sales tools and don't cover every conceivable aspect 
even in the fine print. Travelers have to ask questions. 
</P>
<P>
Determine what extra costs may be involved. Tips to the tour manager and 
vehicle drivers, as well as shipboard cabin stewards and dining room staff are 
extras. Also, make sure that special requests are received early enough. If 
they're not honored, find out ahead and spare yourself the disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
One way to cover yourself for some key contingencies is to buy travel insurance 
for such things as luggage, trip cancellation, trip interruption and even 
hospital expenses. 
</P>
<P>
If your complaint can't be resolved during your travels, write to the tour 
operator or cruise line upon return. Directing these missives to the president 
of the company is worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
Keep letters brief and to the point. Include all the details of what did or 
didn't take place, the names of the people involved and their positions, and 
send copies of any pertinent documents or receipts. If you know the cost of a 
particular service, you can ask for a specific amount of money. However, it 
doesn't mean that you'll get it. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people don't document their case properly," Winn said. 
</P>
<P>
Remember that tour operators and cruise lines frequently have to investigate to 
give you an answer. 
</P>
<P>
"You should, as a rule, get a response from us in about three weeks," Winn 
said. "More involved situations might take a little longer." 
</P>
<P>
Use the same general guidelines when contacting airlines about complaints. If 
it doesn't work out with the carrier, contact the U.S. Department of 
Transportation (government pages in front of a phone book). 
</P>
<P>
And if the resolution of your complaint isn't satisfying, you can always go to 
court.

AN ISLAND LOST IN TIME ON THE CHESAPEAKE BAY

TANGIER ISLAND, Va. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "Miss Tangier" crew loaded the deck of the small supply ferry with large 
boxes of flour, frozen hamburger patties, cartons of milk, diapers and other 
miscellaneous goods. A few tourists and locals piled into the passenger cabin 
below as the boat churned across Chesapeake Bay for a 45-minute trip to Tangier 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone's attention focused on a tiny infant whose mother said he was four 
days old. She had come to the mainland to give birth, and was returning home. 
"We have no doctors on Tangier, only a registered nurse. When I went into labor 
I was afraid the ferry wouldn't get me to the hospital in time, but we made 
it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
When we reached the island a small group of family and friends were waiting to 
greet the newest island resident and his mother, who soon were whisked away in 
a motorized go-cart. The tourists broke into groups, and those of us who 
planned to spend the night walked the short distance to Chesapeake House, the 
only inn on the island. 
</P>
<P>
Tangier is a flat, marshy enclave midway between Virginia and Maryland -- 2 1/2 
miles long and one mile wide. From many points you can see from one end to the 
other. Virtually no trees offer refuge from the sun on steamy Chesapeake summer 
days, and the island has no bars where you can pop in for a tall, cool one 
(Tangier is a dry island). It is a place stripped to the essentials; pure, 
simple living. 
</P>
<P>
As our small group entered the front gate at Chesapeake house, cats scattered 
in all directions. A plethora of well-fed felines roam Tangier Island. Many 
probably descended from ancestors brought on early ships to control the mice 
population. 
</P>
<P>
Inside Chesapeake House a middle-aged woman shuffled into the lobby and 
assessed our small group. We mumbled the usual rhetoric about having 
reservations, but she paid no attention and continued shuffling toward another 
door. 
</P>
<P>
"Who's with who," she asked brusquely. After we partnered ourselves, she said, 
"Follow me." Like school children on a class trip, we traipsed behind her in 
pairs; out the front door, across the road and into another house. The stairs 
squeaked and the handrail wobbled as we made our way up the narrow staircase. 
</P>
<P>
At the top we packed together like sheep and awaited further instruction. "This 
is your room, this is your room and this is your room," she said to no one in 
particular. "Dinner's at 5. If you need anything, just holler." We giggled 
nervously and slid into our small, basic rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Back outside, I soon discovered that on Tangier there are few applications for 
the overused adjectives "cozy" and "charming." Fancy homes with beautiful 
flower gardens do not exist, and many of the aging frame bungalows have been 
replaced by newer prefab structures. 
</P>
<P>
All are unpretentious, a reflection of the people who have inhabited the island 
since Capt. John Smith discovered it in 1608. The first permanent settlers, 
John Crockett and his large family, arrived in 1686, and were soon followed by 
the Pruitts, the Dinses and the Parks. Today the island has fewer than 900 
residents, most descendants of those original settlers. 
</P>
<P>
When John Smith arrived the island extended about three-quarters of a mile 
farther west. Until the 20th Century wooded fields provided ideal conditions 
for agriculture, but erosion has turned the fields into marshland. A severe 
storm can wash away six feet of land in a day. The government, finally showing 
concern, plans to construct a bulkhead in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
With little available land, a major problem is what to do with four centuries 
of departed loved ones. Because there is no room left in the island cemeteries, 
front yard family plots proliferate. Glancing at tombstones, I was impressed by 
the islanders' longevity. An 80-year life span was not unusual a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Folks here certainly live long lives," I said to a woman pulling weeds from 
one of the plots. "That's because we're happy and relaxed," she said 
matter-of-factly. 
</P>
<P>
As I walked up and down the narrow roads I soon realized that there isn't much 
canned entertainment here, no movie theaters, cars (the only motorized vehicles 
are three-wheeled carts and motorcycles) or clothing stores. Shopping is 
limited to a few tiny gift stores and a small general store, dining to 
Chesapeake House, a small restaurant and two sandwich shops. Walking, looking 
and chatting are the favorite pastimes. Thus, a whole lot of chatting goes on. 
</P>
<P>
During the days, with the men out fishing, the island becomes a population of 
women and children. After the housework is finished, the women gather in small 
groups at yard's edge for small talk. 
</P>
<P>
News travels fast on Tangier. My friend and I were exploring the island 
separately. At one point I was photographing bicyclists on the small road when 
a woman, erroneously believing I was photographing her run-down home, 
reprimanded me. 
</P>
<P>
I explained that I wasn't, apologized for the confusion and moved away. Later I 
ran into my friend who said: "I hear your camera got you into trouble." 
</P>
<P>
The verbal wire service had passed along the juicy story, which quickly made 
its way to my friend, who was on the other side of the island. 
</P>
<P>
Tangier Island has not changed much over the years. Islanders still speak with 
an Elizabethan accent that today is mixed with a slow, Southern inflection. 
They do not waste words, and the brevity of their sentences can be misconstrued 
as unfriendliness. 
</P>
<P>
As in the past, the islanders' livelihood comes from Chesapeake Bay, and their 
life style is steeped in tradition. The men rise at 3 a.m. to fish for blue 
crab, oysters and finfish, and the women work at home. 
</P>
<P>
They are deeply religious, and church (there are two, Methodist and 
Independent) is the core of their spiritual and social lives. Morals are strict 
and values strong. 
</P>
<P>
Their wealth comes from bonds they share with family and friends, not from 
material possessions. Freed of the need to compete, they are not impressed by 
outside enticements. Many visitors consider the Tangier way of life 
old-fashioned, but who can argue with an environment free of crime and drug 
abuse? 
</P>
<P>
They are proud people, and do not take well to people who make fun of their 
simple life style. They offer no special treatment to visitors, and if you 
don't like their ways, you can leave. 
</P>
<P>
But most people do like their ways. During the summer, small ferries are filled 
with tourists willing to brave the infestation of mosquitoes and humidity for a 
glimpse of this simplicity. Because there is little to do and few 
accommodations, many visitors arrive on the morning ferry and leave on the 
afternoon ferry. 
</P>
<P>
In the late afternoon I headed for the pier near the boatyard to watch the 
watermen (wudemen as they pronounce it) unload their catch. On the way there, 
Navy jets flew over and appeared to be firing at ships way out in the bay. I 
found out later that the Navy had hauled the wrecks there for target practice. 
</P>
<P>
On the pier, crabs of all sizes squirmed menacingly in chicken wire crab pots. 
"Looks like a good haul," I said to a waterman. "Yep. There's lots of 'em out 
there this time of year. Why don't you try it, Sis?" "You mean go out in one of 
the fishing boats?" I asked. "Nah. You can do it right offshore. Get yourself 
one of those long-handled fishing nets and wade out a bit. You'll catch 
plenty." 
</P>
<P>
"What do you use for bait?" I asked. "Chicken necks and fish heads," he 
answered. I quickly lost interest, but not my appetite. It was close to 5 p.m. 
and I rushed back to Chesapeake House, not wanting to miss dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Even visitors who don't spend the night usually end up at Chesapeake House for 
a meal. Renowned for its fine home cooking, the inn employs island women to 
cook. On a summer weekend they may prepare as many as 2,000 crab cakes, 200 
pounds of potato salad, 150 pans of biscuits and 500 clam fritters. 
</P>
<P>
Other side dishes include a divine corn pudding made from the sweet corn grown 
on Maryland's Eastern Shore, country ham, fresh greens, cole slaw and homemade 
applesauce. Dessert is usually a delicious pound cake. 
</P>
<P>
If you are looking for elegance, this is not the place for you. Meals are 
served family style on long vinyl-covered tables with mismatched dinnerware, 
but no one cares. It is the excellent fare that holds everyone's attention. The 
table atmosphere is companionable and fun, a place where tourists and locals 
break bread together. 
</P>
<P>
"What's for breakfast?" asked Bob, a portly, good-natured Texan whose humor, 
Texas drawl and sweet perky wife, Joan, had quickly endeared him to everyone. 
"Eggs, bacon, sausage, juice, coffee and frud bread," the waitress replied. 
"Frog bread! What's frog bread?" drawled Bob. 
</P>
<P>
"Frud bread, not frog bread," giggled the waitress. "You know, you put the 
bread in a pan and you fruy it." "Fried bread," Bob. "She's saying fried 
bread," laughed Joan. Whenever we ran into Bob after that we couldn't resist 
asking him if he'd had any of that frog bread yet. 
</P>
<P>
The after-dinner hours are often spent socializing. Some of the men head for 
the general store where they sip coffee and sodas and pass the time talking 
about the day's catch, and discuss the plight of the Eastern Shore oyster 
population, which is being destroyed by pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Teens race up and down the tiny roads on bicycles and small motorcycles, or 
take in a game of pool at a relic of a house that was converted to a recreation 
hall. 
</P>
<P>
If there is no church activity, many of the islanders gather at one of the 
sandwich shops or at Crockett's Double Six for dominoes. 
</P>
<P>
About 8 p.m. everyone heads home; 3 a.m. arrives very soon. Before retiring, 
families relax a while on the front porch glider, fanning themselves and 
listening to the music of the night insects. 
</P>
<P>
The sun disappeared below the horizon as I strolled along the narrow street. 
People waved and smiled from their porches, and I reflected on the words of 
Virginia poet Sonny Forbes: 
</P>
<P>
 " ... Upon these shores have walked men of God, made of fiber woven close for 
age ... and inside these dwellings laughter and love have flowed to make 
mansions of our homes ... time is abundant here and we wish it not away." 
</P>

WHERE TO STAY AND PLAY OR WINE AND DINE IN EAST BERLIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By From Barry D. Wood and the Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Getting there: There are still only two ways for an American to enter East 
Berlin: Either by walking or driving through Allied Checkpoint Charlie or by 
taking the S-Bahn streetcar and passing through the border at the 
Friedrichstrasse station. 
</P>
<P>
By car, crossing the border is a bit anticlimactic. Border officials are as 
likely to smile as they are to reinforce the rigid stereotype. Walking across 
is more of an adventure. You'll likely wait in line (usually for 5 to 20 
minutes) with Italians, French and Turks. East Germans shuffle through separate 
lines, laden with the proceeds of shopping expeditions to West Berlin bargain 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
Regulations have eased dramatically in recent weeks. You no longer need to 
change money at the border. You buy a one-day visa for about $3 and you're in 
till midnight. If you want to stay overnight or travel elsewhere in East 
Germany, you must have a prepaid hotel room booked by an East German-approved 
U.S. travel agency before a single-entry tourist visa (about $8) is issued. 
</P>
<P>
Money: The requirement that Westerners daily convert a specified amount of hard 
money into East German currency has been dropped. Until currency union July 2, 
visitors receive two East marks for one West mark ($1 is worth DM 1.68). 
</P>
<P>
Where to stay: Hotels throughout West Berlin are heavily booked from now 
through early July, and hotel space is "very difficult, if not impossible, to 
obtain," according to the U.S. Government Mission in West Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is just as bad in East Berlin, which has three Western-quality 
hotels: the Grand, Metropol and Palast. All are still run by Interhotel, the 
state hotel agency. All are ridiculously expensive, and only the Grand is 
really worth it. Cheaper rooms are available but can be Spartan. All 
accommodations are available at the central Reiseburo or travel office on 
Alexanderplatz. For Westerners, the best values remain in West Berlin, and 
travel between the two halves of the city is now so easy that the West is a 
viable option. A complete West Berlin hotel and pension guidebook is available 
at Tegel Airport and at the Zoo train station. Expect to pay at least $50 for a 
modest (bath down the hall) room in a pension. 
</P>
<P>
Where to dine: The Wolga restaurant on Friedrichstrasse is one of the few 
places you can sometimes get into without a reservation. Generally you should 
be prepared to wait for a table, then again for a menu and then quite some time 
for your food. The restaurants at the Grand Hotel are good (see accompanying 
story, L6), but Peking, the Chinese restaurant opened by Grand management a 
block away from Checkpoint Charlie (Friedrichstrasse 58) is unspeakably awful. 
Don't even think about it. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller restaurants away from the main tourist area downtown can be far more 
pleasant and even occasionally relatively friendly to the taste buds. Try 
neighborhood spots in Prenzlauerberg, Pankow or along Karl Marx Allee. The 
Hoehers Gaststube on Rhinower Strasse serves pork chops and has a back room 
with a comfortable, down-home feel. 
</P>
<P>
What to drink: East German beers, which retain some of the fine names of German 
brews, have been watered down through years of Communist production, so East 
Germans often stick to Czech beers, especially Pilsner Urquell. One good East 
German beer is Radeberger. Order it soon because the West German brands are 
already attempting to take over by offering barkeepers and hoteliers free 
glassware and coasters, if they serve the Western brands exclusively. 
</P>
<P>
Nightlife: In Prenzlauerberg, check out the Franz Youth Club (Schoenhauser 
Allee 36), a converted brewery notable for its fascinating crowd and not for 
the German pop music, one of the most inexplicably foul forms of art on the 
planet. 
</P>
<P>
East Berlin's best dance club is Yucca on Wisbyer Strasse, but a European disco 
is a European disco. 
</P>
<P>
One problem with all such places in East Berlin these days is that it has 
become chic for West Berliners to go out to the East in the evening, leaving 
East Berliners in a tiny minority in their own hangouts. 
</P>
<P>
The Staatsoper, Comic Opera and Schauspielhaus, where the Berlin Symphony 
plays, have schedules packed with many of the finest orchestras and opera 
companies of the East Bloc. East Berlin concert guidebooks are available at 
most West Berlin hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Hotels and tour operators can book tickets, but they are far more expensive 
than they should be. If you're staying several days, go to the box office and 
buy your seat in advance. 
</P>
<P>
Music lovers should know that a limited number of tickets always go on sale one 
hour before concert time. Standing room tickets are also often available. 
</P>
<P>
Other walks: 
</P>
<P>
 -- From Checkpoint Charlie along Leipziger Strasse, past the handful of show 
shops that were supposed to convince Westerners that communists could make 
consumer goods, to the River Spree and the Nikolai Quarter, a renovated section 
of neat shops and cafes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- From the Gethsemane Church, a cradle of last fall's people's revolution, 
past the old Jewish cemetery, a sobering glimpse into the history that East 
Germany did its best to ignore, and on to Husemannstrasse, Honecker's showplace 
for foreign visitors.

YOUTH BEAT: FILLING THAT BACKPACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Have you packed a notebook? If so, it can be worth its weight in gold. 
</P>
<P>
It can come in handy while riding a ferry in Greece, a train in Amsterdam or a 
bus in Australia or anywhere else in the world, particularly as you meet other 
travelers. 
</P>
<P>
Information about hotels and restaurants can come from other travelers you'll 
meet during your trip. That's why it's wise to carry a notebook, to share 
information and record recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some other suggestions to consider when packing for an adventure 
abroad: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Make sure that you have a guidebook that fits your style of travel. 
Different guides are aimed at different types of traveler. Ask the managers of 
travel bookstores for advice. Check your telephone directory for their 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Consider buying the style of backpack that allows the shoulder straps and 
hip belt to be hidden under a flap so that it can also look like a soft 
suitcase. You may not always want to appear to be a budget traveler, and you'll 
likely get more use from it after your trip. Be sure the backpack has a hip 
belt to help reduce the strain on your shoulders and back. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Choose clothes with patterns; they won't show wear as quickly. Plan to 
dress in layers rather than trying to carrying bulky coats. Pack comfortable, 
flat, worn-in walking shoes. Remember that many streets in Europe are 
cobblestoned and heels can catch. Sandals are handy for pebbled beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Consider tossing in: large sealable plastic bags (for food, or packing damp 
clothing); a universal sink plug (it seems that half the sinks in budget hotels 
and campgrounds are missing them when you want to rinse clothes); a poncho (it 
will cover you and your day-pack in the rain, even when cycling, and can be 
used as a groundsheet for picnics or camping); a small water container (the tap 
water on many trains is undrinkable, so you might want to carry your own for 
brushing your teeth); a Swiss army knife (if it's not on the knife, add eating 
utensils, plus a bottle and can opener and corkscrew). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Take along a popular paperback book or two for long train and bus rides. 
One is often enough, even if you are going to a foreign-language country, 
because English-speaking travelers trade with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Unless you intend to camp, it may not be necessary to carry a sleeping bag. 
The traditional version is not welcome in many youth hostels today. Instead, 
travelers are required to have, or rent, a sleeping sack made out of white 
sheets. The youth hostels provide blankets. Hostel operators feel that this is 
more sanitary than allowing people to use sleeping bags that may have also been 
used outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Add a day pack for daily sightseeing items. You can store your big pack 
where you're staying, or in lockers at most train and bus stations. Day packs 
leave your hands free to hold a map or guidebook, and they are not as easy for 
thieves to grab as shoulder bags. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don't carry your money, tickets or passport in any type of pack. When the 
backpack is being worn, it's not in your sight and can be easily razored open 
by a thief. Buy a money belt or pouch to carry your valuables under your 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Your money should be converted into traveler's checks and you should carry 
a separate copy of these numbers and the numbers on all other important 
documents. Leave another copy of these numbers with family or friends at home.

BEHIND THE WHEEL BEHIND THE WALL -- A FEW DRIVING TIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By James T. Yenckel 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Renting a car to tour in Eastern Europe is almost as easy as renting one in the 
United States. The procedures are reasonably uncomplicated, but travelers may 
have to do a bit of homework to get the best deal. 
</P>
<P>
Avis, Hertz and National (with Europcar) are among the international rental 
firms with offices in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland 
and Romania. 
</P>
<P>
Reservations can be made via the firms' toll-free numbers to pick up cars in 
major cities for either short- or long-term rentals. Some airlines -- including 
Lot, the Polish airline -- offer fly-drive packages at reduced rental rates. 
</P>
<P>
Tour companies specializing in Eastern Europe also offer such packages. A 
travel agent can provide more information. 
</P>
<P>
In the Soviet Union, auto travel by foreigners is restricted to specified 
corridors, but this is not the case in the six former Soviet satellites. 
Motorists are free to plan itineraries within countries or to cross borders by 
car, going from one to another. However, if your plans take you from one 
country into another and then back again, make sure you have obtained a visa 
that permits multiple entries. 
</P>
<P>
Before you leave the United States, consider obtaining an international 
driver's permit, issued at offices of the American Automobile Assn. 
</P>
<P>
They are not absolutely required in most East European nations, but they are 
useful to have. The permit reproduces the information on your U.S. driver's 
license in several European languages. This helps smooth language problems if 
you are stopped. Motorists should be aware that speed traps are prevalent, and 
that driving while intoxicated is a major violation. 
</P>
<P>
Most travel agents recommend making car-rental reservations in advance, 
especially during the busy summer months. East Europeans are orderly and 
bureaucratic, say the agents, and don't like to be surprised by unexpected 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
Among the considerations when renting: 
</P>
<P>
 -- East or West? One of the first decisions to be made is whether to rent in 
Eastern Europe or Western Europe. Jonathan Chase of Travel Advisors of America 
(202) 371-1440, a Washington, D.C., travel agency specializing in Eastern 
Europe, recommends picking up a car in the West -- in West Berlin or Vienna, 
for example. 
</P>
<P>
Rates tend to be lower, he said, and you can expect better availability of cars 
-- an important consideration during peak summer weeks. Also, the car almost 
certainly will be a West European model. 
</P>
<P>
If you rent in an East European city, you may get an unfamiliar model built in 
the East. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The cost: Wherever you rent, be as specific in your questions about what's 
included in the rental rate as you would be at home. Additional charges may be 
added to the basic rental fee. These extra charges vary by country and rental 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
What insurance is included in the price? In most West European countries the 
Collision Damage Waiver is, or will be soon, included as a part of the rental 
fee. 
</P>
<P>
Do you get unlimited mileage? Cars rented in Western Europe generally come with 
no mileage restrictions. Extra mileage charges can be high at some East 
European rental firms. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a drop-off fee when you return a rental car to a different city? 
Drop-offs generally are permitted anywhere in Europe, but fees can be high if 
you plan to leave the car across a border. So far Romania prohibits drop-offs 
outside its borders. 
</P>
<P>
How much are the taxes? The tax on rentals varies widely. A tax of 14% is added 
in West Germany. In Austria it is 21%, a difference to keep in mind when 
matching rates in these gateway countries to those in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
For a comparison, Hertz is offering these summer rates for a one-week rental of 
the smallest available car (taxes not included): Austria, $262; Bulgaria, $294; 
Czechoslovakia, $290; Hungary, $168, and West Germany, $199. In Hungary there 
is a rental tax of 25%. Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia have no tax on rentals. If 
you rented a Hertz car in West Berlin, drove it to Prague and then to Vienna, 
the drop-off fee would be $70. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. International Travel &amp; Tours, an Indiana company specializing in tours 
of Romania, offers seven-day car-rental and lodging packages. During the summer 
high season the rate is $369 per person (double) for a car, seven nights' 
lodging in first-class hotels, two meals daily, unlimited mileage and 
insurance. For details: U.S. International Travel &amp; Tours, 117 S. Main St., 
Mishawaka, Ind. 46544, (219) 255-7272. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Buying gas: Many American motorists are surprised to discover the limited 
availability of unleaded fuel in Eastern Europe. Most West European rental cars 
use unleaded fuel. Unfortunately, stations selling unleaded fuel in Eastern 
Europe are sometimes few and far between, particularly in the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
It is wise to fill up any time your gas gauge indicates the tank is half empty. 
The rental office where you pick up your car should be able to tell you where 
unleaded gas is available in the country you are visiting. 
</P>
<P>
Some border posts also provide that information. You may be asked to buy gas 
coupons when you pick up a car in Eastern Europe or when you cross a national 
border. Coupons can be handy on extended driving tours, saving you from 
currency hassles in countryside service stations. On the other hand, don't buy 
too many because they are not refundable. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Repairs: When reserving, determine what breakdown services the rental firm 
provides. Avis and Hertz maintain 24-hour hot lines in Eastern Europe for 
on-the-road repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Other international firms, such as Kemwell, do not, and you may have to pay for 
a long tow to a repair shop. 
</P>
<P>
However, one frequent traveler to Eastern Europe notes that local mechanics are 
excellent. Over the years they have learned out of necessity to repair most 
auto parts rather than replace them. James T. Yenckel

TRAVEL QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS: IF A CRUISE FIRM OVERBOOKS, LIFE CAN GET 
ATTRACTIVE ON THE NEXT SAILING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC FRIEDHEIM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I've heard that cruise lines overbook. Can a passenger with a 
confirmed reservation be left behind, as is the case with airlines? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Cruise overbooking is rare because the lines usually know well in 
advance if there's no cabin available. They will contact you, offering an 
attractive upgrade on another sailing. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Does it really cost as much as $10 for a cup of coffee at a Japanese 
airport? 
</P>
<P>
A. While Japanese food and drink isn't cheap, latest check at Tokyo 
International Airport showed coffee costs $1.58; beer, $2.88; hamburger, $3.48; 
ice cream, $1.09; spaghetti, $3.66; apple pie, $1.79; whiskey, $3.73; chewing 
gum, 42 cents, and a pack of cigarettes $1.69. These prices are competitive 
with most airports around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What happened to the Cook's Tours that were famous years ago? My agent says 
they're not operated any more. 
</P>
<P>
 A. Thomas Cook still operates tours out of London to all parts of the world 
but hasn't offered them in this country for some time. However, its newly 
reorganized Thos. Cook American affiliate will make such tours available again 
through its own and other travel agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Which company operates the world's only luxury freighter and where does it 
sail? 
</P>
<P>
A. The 19,500 ton, 88-passenger Americana makes 48-day round trips between New 
York City and South America. It has 52 cabins and various public rooms. Fares 
start at $6,480 round trip, per person. Contact Ivaran Lines toll-free at (800) 
451-1639 or your agent. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I'd like to take an adventure trip. Because they may be in wilderness or 
other remote regions, what emergency medical facilities do they offer? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Major African safari operators are served by the Kenya-based Flying Doctors 
Assn., which provides immediate emergency treatment, including air evacuation

PRESERVING BIODIVERSITY IS PROTECTING LIFE ON EARTH; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: WHY CARE ABOUT RED SQUIRRELS, TUNDRA, BLUE BEETLES OR LITTLE 
BLUESTEM GRASSES? THREE REASONS, WHICH BOIL DOWN TO SELF-INTEREST.

The ozone hole and the greenhouse effect have entered our public vocabulary, 
but we have no catchy label for the third great environmental problem of the 
late-20th Century. It's even more diffuse than depletion of the ozone layer or 
global warming, harder to grasp and summarize. The experts call it "the loss of 
biodiversity." 
</P>
<P>
Biodiversity obviously has something to do with pandas, tigers and tropical 
forests. But preserving biodiversity is a much bigger job than protecting 
rainforests or charismatic megafauna. It's the job of protecting all life -- 
microscopic creepy-crawlies as well as elephants and condors -- and all life's 
habitats -- tundra, prairie and swamp as well as forests. 
</P>
<P>
Why care about red squirrels, for instance? 
</P>
<P>
"Do we have to save every subspecies?" asked the U.S. Interior secretary, 
Manuel Lujan Jr., on Thursday. He called for changes in the Endangered Species 
Act, because it is blocking construction of a $200-million telescope on Mt. 
Graham in Arizona, the habitat for about 180 endangered red squirrels. 
</P>
<P>
Why care about tundra, swamp, blue beetles or little bluestem grasses? 
Ecologists give three reasons, which boil down to simple self-interest on three 
levels of escalating importance. 
</P>
<P>
Biodiversity has both immediate and potential economic value. This is the 
argument most commonly put forward to defend biodiversity, because it's the one 
our culture is most ready to hear. It cites the importance of the industries 
most directly dependent upon nature -- fisheries, forestry, tourism, recreation 
and the harvesting of wild foods, medicines, dyes, rubber and chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Some ecologists are so tired of this line of reasoning that they refer wearily 
to the "Madagascar periwinkle argument." That obscure plant yields the drugs 
vincristine and vinblastine, which have revolutionized the treatment of 
leukemia. About a third of all modern medicines have been derived from molds 
and plants. The potential for future discoveries is astounding. The total 
number of species of life is somewhere between 10 million and 30 million, only 
1.7 million of which we have named, only a fraction of which we have tested for 
usefulness. 
</P>
<P>
The economic value of biodiversity is very real, but ecologists hate the 
argument because it is both arrogant and trivial. It assumes that the Earth's 
millions of species are here to serve the economic purposes of just one 
species. And even if you buy that idea, it misses the larger and more valuable 
ways that nature serves us, even if we never name or harvest its millions of 
species. 
</P>
<P>
Biodiversity performs environmental services beyond price. How would you like 
the job of pollinating all trillion or so apple blossoms in New York state some 
sunny afternoon in late May? It's conceivable, maybe, that you could invent a 
machine to do it, but inconceivable that the machine could work as elegantly 
and cheaply as the honeybee, much less make honey on the side. 
</P>
<P>
Suppose you were assigned to turn every bit of dead organic matter, from fallen 
leaves to urban garbage to road kills, into nutrients that feed new life. Even 
if you knew how, what would it cost? A host of bacteria, molds, mites and worms 
do it for free. If they ever stopped, all life would stop. We would not last 
long if green plants stopped turning our exhaled carbon dioxide back into 
oxygen. Plants would not last long if a few genera of soil bacteria stopped 
turning nitrogen from the air into nitrate fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
Human reckoning cannot put a value on the services performed by the ecosystems 
of earth. In addition to pollination and nutrient recycling, these services 
include the cleansing of air and water, flood control, drought prevention, pest 
control, temperature regulation and maintenance of the world's most valuable 
library -- the genes of all living organisms. 
</P>
<P>
Biodiversity contains the accumulated wisdom of nature and the key to its 
future. If you ever wanted to destroy a society so thoroughly that there would 
be no hope of its resuscitation, you would burn its libraries and kill its 
intellectuals. You would destroy its knowledge. Nature's knowledge is contained 
in the DNA within living cells. The variety of that genetic information is the 
driving engine of evolution, the immune system for life, the source of 
adaptability -- not just the variety of species but also the variety of 
individuals within each species. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals are never quite alike. Each is genetically unique mostly in 
subterranean ways that will only appear in future generations. We recognize 
that is true of human beings. Plant and animal breeders recognize it in dogs, 
cattle, wheat, roses, apples. The only reason they can bring forth bigger 
fruits or sweeter smells or disease resistance is that those traits are already 
present in the genes carried by some individuals. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of information in a single cell is hard to comprehend. A simple 
one-celled bacterium can carry genes for 1,000 traits, a flowering plant for 
400,000. Biologist E. O. Wilson says the information in the genes of an 
ordinary house mouse, if translated into printed letters, would fill all the 15 
editions of the Encyclopedia Britannica that have been published since 1768. 
And each house mouse is slightly different from all the others. 
</P>
<P>
The wealth of genetic information has been selected over billions of years to 
fit the ever-changing necessities of the planet. As Earth's atmosphere filled 
with oxygen, as land masses drifted apart, as humans invented agriculture and 
altered the land, there were lurking within individuals pieces of genetic code 
that allowed them to defend against or take advantage of the changes. These 
individuals were more fit for the new environment. They bred more successfully. 
The population began to take on their characteristics. New species came into 
being. 
</P>
<P>
Biodiversity is the accumulation of all life's past adaptations, and it is the 
basis for all future adaptations (even those mediated by human gene-splicers). 
That's why ecologists value biodiversity as one of the Earth's great resources, 
as great as oil deposits or topsoils or fresh water. It's why they take 
seriously the loss of even the most insignificant of species; why they defend 
not only the preservation of species but the preservation of populations within 
species, and why they regard the current rate of human-induced extinctions as 
an unparalleled catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
We don't know how many species we are eliminating, because we don't know how 
many species there are. It's a fair guess that at the rate we're destroying 
habitat, especially but not exclusively in the tropics, we're pushing to 
extinction about one species every hour. That doesn't count the species whose 
populations are being reduced so greatly that diversity within the population 
is essentially gone. Earth has not seen a spasm of extinctions like this for 65 
million years. 
</P>
<P>
Biologists estimate that human beings usurp, directly or indirectly, about 40% 
of each year's total biological production (and our population is on its way to 
another doubling in 40 years). There is hardly a place on Earth where people do 
not log, pave, spray, drain, flood, graze, fish, plow, burn, drill, spill or 
dump. There is no life zone, with the possible exception of the deep ocean, 
that we are not degrading. In poor countries biodiversity is being 
nickel-and-dimed to death; in rich countries it is being billion-dollared to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
Besides "loss of diversity," biologists have another name for this problem -- 
"biotic impoverishment." What is impoverished is not just biodiversity, it is 
also the human economy and human spirit. Ecologist Paul Ehrlich describes 
biotic impoverishment this way: "Unless current trends are reversed, Americans 
will gradually be living in a nation that has fewer warblers and ducks and more 
starlings and herring gulls, fewer native wildflowers and more noxious weeds, 
fewer swallowtail butterflies and more cockroaches, smaller herds of elk and 
bigger herds of rats, less edible seafood, less productive croplands, less 
dependable supplies of pure freshwater, more desert wastes and dust storms, 
more frequent floods and more uncomfortable weather." 
</P>
<P>
Biodiversity can't be maintained by protecting a few species in a zoo, or by 
preserving greenbelts or national parks. To function properly nature needs more 
room than that. It can maintain itself, however, without human expense, without 
zookeepers, park rangers, foresters or gene banks. All it needs is to be left 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
To provide their priceless pollination service, the honeybees ask only that we 
stop saturating the landscape with poisons, stop paving the meadows where 
bee-food grows and leave them enough honey to get through the winter. 
</P>
<P>
To maintain our planet, our lives and our future potential, the other species 
have similar requests, all of which add up to: Control yourselves. Control your 
numbers. Control your greed. See yourselves as what you are, part of an 
interdependent biological community -- the most intelligent part, though you 
don't often act that way. 
</P>
<P>
So act that way, either out of a moral respect for something magnificent that 
you did not create and do not understand, or out of a practical interest in 
your own survival.

WE'RE NOT DROWNING IN LOUSY JOBS, BUT AWASH IN UNTRAINED WORKERS; 
</P>

ECONOMY: CURRENT WAGE AND JOBLESS TRENDS SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE: SKILLED WORKERS 
ARE WELCOME; UNSKILLED WORKERS NEED NOT APPLY.

Commentators increasingly worry about the decline in middle-class jobs. The 
U.S. economy has produced 35 million new jobs since 1972, a record that is the 
envy of other industrialized nations. But many of these jobs pay too little to 
buy a middle-class lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
After decades of erratic but robust increase, earnings growth has virtually 
ceased in recent years. In the first 25 years after World War II, the 
inflation-adjusted hourly wages of production workers rose more than 70%, a 
little more than 2% a year. During the 16 years ending last year, hourly 
earnings fell 6%, or about 0.4% each year. Even during the economic expansion 
that began in 1983, average wages have continued to fall. If job quality is 
measured by hourly wages paid, there is little doubt that the average quality 
of production jobs has tumbled. 
</P>
<P>
Equally disturbing, the disparity in wages has risen as the average wage has 
shrunk. Workers who initially earned high wages have continued to enjoy healthy 
gains. Workers stuck near the bottom of the job market have slipped farther 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
This trend is especially pronounced among men. (Wage disparities began to rise 
among women only recently.) Between 1967 and 1977, earnings for all jobs rose, 
although gains were faster at the higher-paying end. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1977, however, wages in the bottom half of the job scale have fallen 
sharply, while those at the very top have continued to climb. Earnings of the 
bottom fifth fell 13%; those at the top shot up 11%. The middle has shrunk. 
</P>
<P>
The sudden rise in wage inequality is associated with a leap in the earnings 
premium men can expect from completing college. In the late 1960s and early 
'70s, economists detected a gradual erosion in the earnings gap between college 
graduates and workers who never went beyond high school. By 1979, the median 
earnings of male college graduates aged 25-34 was only 31% higher than the 
median earnings of those with no more than a high-school degree. But during the 
1980s, the earnings premium of college graduates soared, reaching an all-time 
high of 64% by 1987. 
</P>
<P>
One explanation for these wage trends hinges on shifts in the composition of 
the work force. The entry of women and the baby-boom generation into the job 
market certainly made a splash. The rise in the number of less-skilled workers, 
particularly new entrants and women with little work experience, raised the 
percentage of all workers receiving low wages. It also heightened competition 
for less-skilled jobs and drove down wages on these jobs relative to earnings 
in more skilled occupations. 
</P>
<P>
This explanation made sense in the late 1960s and the 1970s, when the baby-boom 
generation entered the work force. It makes less sense in the 1980s and 1990s, 
with baby-boomers nearing middle age. The large group born between 1946-64 are 
skilled and experienced; they have reached or are nearing their peak earnings 
years. Indeed, the age and experience profile of the '80s work force changed in 
a way that should have accelerated the pace of wage growth and reduced the 
share of workers who should receive low wages. Rising wage inequality has 
occurred despite broad demographic trends that should have reduced it. 
</P>
<P>
Another explanation focuses on the country's changing industrial mix. 
Well-paying industries -- manufacturing and construction -- employ a shrinking 
share of workers. Growing industries -- mainly in the service sector -- pay 
lousy wages. A growing percentage of American workers toil in fast-food 
restaurants, theme parks and other low-paying service industries unable to earn 
enough to achieve a middle-class lifestyle, according to this theory. Put 
another way, this explanation holds that we're becoming a nation of 
hamburger-flippers and floor-sweepers. 
</P>
<P>
Although partly accurate, this theory explains only a little of what is going 
on.The decline of manufacturing and other highly paid industries actually 
accounts for a small part of the growth in low-wage employment. More important 
has been the growth of low-wage jobs across a wide variety of industries, 
including those that once paid high average wages. The loss of manufacturing 
jobs has hurt workers at the bottom of the job scale. But they have been hurt 
more because their wages fell across a spectrum of industries, including 
manufacturing. Meanwhile, the earnings of highly compensated and highly 
educated workers have soared across a wide variety of industries and 
occupations. 
</P>
<P>
It is widely assumed that employers are creating an excessive number of jobs 
that require little skill or intelligence and thus pay low wages. If employers 
were truly doing this, today's labor market would look very different. 
Businesses would go begging for less skilled labor. Unskilled workers would see 
their unemployment rate fall in comparison with that of skilled workers. 
Unskilled wage rates would be bid up as firms found it harder to fill 
vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
The current job market looks very different. Unemployment rates of unskilled 
workers have risen relative to those of skilled workers. Unskilled wage rates 
have fallen. The help-wanted sign in the window of your local fast-food 
restaurant might imply a different story. But the wage posted on the sign is 
usually less than that offered 10 or 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
We are not drowning in a sea of lousy jobs. Rather, the labor market is awash 
with a surplus of unskilled workers. Current wage and unemployment trends send 
a clear signal: Skilled workers are welcome; unskilled workers need not apply. 
For a variety of reasons, employers now require an increasing level of general 
education and skill. By the wages they offer, employers show their willingness 
to reward skill in a tangible way. 
</P>
<P>
This probably sounds like the warning of your high-school guidance counselor. 
Twenty years ago, however, the unskilled worker could anticipate that his 
wages, though low, would rise in lock step with wages in general. The current 
job market holds no such promise. Wages for those with average skills are 
stagnant; wages for the unskilled are falling. Only workers with demonstrable 
skills appear to be gaining ground.

REDEFINING AUTHORITY: THE NEED FOR DIVERSITY; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: SEEKING TENURE FOR A BLACK WOMAN, HARVARD LAW STUDENTS DEMAND 
CHANGE: THEY ASSERT THAT AUTHORITY DOESN'T MEAN WHITE AND MALE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Dante Troutt, David Dante Troutt, a writer who grew up in Harlem, is a 
student at Harvard Law School.

<P>
Inside the gray corridors of Harvard Law School, where 18th-Century oil 
paintings of robed barristers cast cold stares from beneath big wigs, there is 
divergence on the issue of diversity. Outside the classrooms, hundreds of 
students have marched and rallied in recent weeks to demand the tenure 
appointment of a woman of color to the faculty. It is a struggle waiting to 
happen on many campuses -- a struggle to change the face of legal authority. 
</P>
<P>
The singular demand for "diversity" hardly reflects the numbers behind it: 173 
years without a Latino, woman of color, American Indian, Asian, disabled or 
openly homosexual tenured professor. Of the 60 current tenured faculty, 53 are 
white men, three are African-American men and five are white women. 
</P>
<P>
For Dean Robert C. Clark, untold faculty and many conservative students, it is 
a struggle to preserve the power of the Harvard name, as though it were the 
H-bomb of elitism to be dropped upon frightened listeners in professional 
conversation. The idea of, say, a black woman in charge of a class full of the 
"best and brightest" is anathema to people, mainly men, more accustomed to 
watching them cook and clean than assign and grade. Discrete and insular 
minorities were less threatening when they were quiet and unknown. 
</P>
<P>
An outsider might wonder why so much is made of a single appointment in such a 
large institution. Is the fear that an inch may become a mile so realistic? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it is. After all, diversity would call into question many of the 
assumptions about interpretation of the law. It might challenge professors not 
fond of confrontation to defend their expertise in classrooms, law reviews and 
faculty meetings. It might challenge the dishonesty of "it is" -- for which law 
faculty are known -- with the "I think" -- by which many minority and feminist 
scholars assert their views. Perhaps "Truth" itself would disappear. As more 
integrated approaches rivaled tradition for intellectual primacy and discourse, 
the old school might lose hegemony. The H-bomb might explode, leaving equality 
to reign amid the ruins. 
</P>
<P>
Yet for minorities and others outside the norm whose presence and competence 
was only recently recognized here, diversity might defuse the H-bomb that burns 
within us. 
</P>
<P>
Any student can tackle questions or deliver doctrine on demand. But law is 
ultimately about living people, and to sit inside a law-school class and hear 
the stories of our parents reduced to irreducible principles of abstraction, 
the facts removed from the flesh in our casebooks, the race and class edited 
out of opinions is to taunt implosion. As mild-mannered missionaries of 
difference, we await "race week" in contracts, "women's day" in constitutional 
law and "Indian moment" in property to offer the victim's expertise. We are 
good, but we are tired of being visiting lecturers for the education of white 
students. Like all students, we come for the rigorous study of ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the promise of true diversity is that groups who don't know each other will 
come to terms through exposure and debate. This is rare in the bastion of 
privilege and rarer still among U.S. suburbs and boardrooms. But it is critical 
to an education for leadership. You cannot exalt diversity only in exotic 
vacations, the globalization of markets, new opportunities in Eastern Europe 
and popular intolerance of apartheid. You must live it at home. 
</P>
<P>
The law is but one element in life -- though it tries to be its regulator -- 
and life is becoming more diverse all the time. The major cities for legal 
practice -- New York, Chicago and Los Angeles -- are home to more Latino school 
districts, lesbian-owned businesses, Asian service workers, homeless families 
and black developers than ever before. That presence parallels the numerical 
inclusion of minorities in training grounds such as Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, this struggle for diversity involves the demand for substantial 
inclusion and a radical restructuring of legal perception, argument and 
analysis. It is a struggle for the power to legitimate. That perhaps is why 
conservative faculty here, as everywhere, raise questions about the competence 
of African-Americans to teach or, for that matter, to own businesses and lead 
school districts. It is not enough that the black female professor under 
scrutiny in the current debate is a well-published authority on insurance law, 
tenured at Penn Law School and sought by Michigan Law School. At Harvard, 
because she is also an unapologetic role model, she is the first step on a 
"slippery slope." 
</P>
<P>
A majority of students here at Harvard do not care to drop themselves upon the 
world like bomb threats. While black women have been most vocal, the 700 
students who have consistently attended rallies and sit-ins this spring 
constitute a multiracial group of men and women intent on adequate preparation. 
The passage of a student referendum supporting a pro-bono requirement and the 
frequent winter protests over cutbacks in public-service programs signal a 
curiosity and a desire to expand the range of legal advocacy. The recent 
announcement by a beloved black professor, Derrick Bell, that he will not 
return until demands are met, threatens the existence of a role model for 
students hungry for open doors, feedback and human insight. Despite its 
acrimony, the diversity struggle has produced a rare experience at Harvard Law 
School: community.

GREENLINING: AN EQUAL-OPPORTUNITY, GRASS-ROOTS ANTIDOTE TO REDLINING; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMICS: WITH A LITTLE PRODDING, CORPORATE AMERICA IS FINALLY REALIZING THAT 
IGNORING INNER-CITY COMMUNITIES IS COSTLY TO THE BOTTOM LINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By George Dean and Robert Gnaizda, George Dean is president of the California 
Council of Urban Leagues; Robert Gnaizda is chief counsel for the Greenlining 
Coalition and a partner at Public Advocates Inc. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Redlining is no stranger to minority communities. It's the equivalent of 
whites-only baseball played by America's corporations and businesses. 
"Greenlining" aims to do to these communities what Jackie Robinson did to 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Like the "Green Power" movement, which appeals to corporate self-interest to 
protect the environment, the Greenlining Coalition aims to promote the economic 
well-being of minorities and the poor by encouraging corporate America to 
abandon redlining and form partnerships with them. Why should corporations, 
after years of cold-shoulder treatment, embrace inner-city and low-income 
communities? Profits and market share. 
</P>
<P>
Started in 1979, the Greenlining Coalition comprises 16 multiethnic 
organizations, among them the California Council of Urban Leagues, the League 
of United Latin American Citizens, the Filipino-American Political Assn. and 
Consumer Action. Its first partnership, also in 1979, was with Glendale Federal 
Savings and Loan. The coalition agreed not to file an action with the Federal 
Home Loan Bank Board to block Glendale's merger with another S&amp;L. In 
return, Glendale pledged to develop inner-city lending programs, name minority 
and female representatives to its board of directors and revise its 
philanthropic policies. 
</P>
<P>
Its most recent partnership was announced last month when Security Pacific Bank 
said it was committing $2.4 billion in the 1990s to economic development in 
inner-city and low-income neighborhoods. The bank also plans to retarget its 
philanthropic contributions to reflect the needs of its customer base, almost 
half minority. The program is the result of numerous meetings of the coalition 
and its counsel, Public Advocates, with Security Pacific's chief executive 
officer, Robert Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Other banks also recognize the immense profits to be made by lending in the 
inner cities. The Bank of Tokyo, which owns 77% of Union Bank, reached a 
comprehensive equal-opportunity agreement with the coalition in 1988 to head 
off a potential legal challenge to its plan to merge with a California bank. 
The pact calls for the bank to invest at least $42 million a year in the inner 
city, to name a total of five minority and female representatives to its board 
of directors, to set up a comprehensive multilingual outreach program and to 
offer free checking accounts to the poor. As part of the bank's lending 
program, the Baltic Inn in San Diego was restored and the Mercy Family Plaza in 
San Francisco built to create housing for low-income and senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Commendable as Bank of Toyko's action is, Southern California Edison recently 
went further. Last September, after a series of Supreme Court decisions that 
made it more difficult for plaintiffs to prove discrimination and weaken the 
quota system, Howard Allen, Edison chairman, asked the coalition to join him in 
announcing corporate changes that would strive to end economic exclusion. 
</P>
<P>
The power company promised to add two female and minority representatives to 
its board of directors, ensure that 30% of its top management be minority and 
female, award roughly 30% of its $1 billion year in contracts to minorities and 
women and increase by tenfold its direct philanthropic contributions to the 
poor and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Allen has been outspoken on the matter of equal opportunity, asserting that it 
is not only morally right, but makes good business sense and can be achieved on 
merit alone. 
</P>
<P>
Other major corporations have also pursued the profit potential of serving all 
segments of California's diverse population. In 1986 and 1987, AT&amp;T, GTE 
and Pacific Bell entered into agreements with members of the coalition to 
provide multilingual telephone services. One expert estimated that the 
introduction of full Spanish-language telephone services could increase Pacific 
Bell's revenue by at least $5 billion this decade. AT&amp;T, impressed by the 
profitability of Spanish-language telephone services, has announced that it 
will voluntarily launch a 140-language phone service throughout the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
The Greenlining Coalition has been less successful in dealing with 
foreign-owned banks and the insurance industry in California. Unwillingness to 
lend to minorities in California has prompted legal protests by the coalition, 
Consumers Union and Communities for Accountable Reinvestment. As a result, the 
Federal Reserve Bank is scrutinizing the lending practices of Mitsui Bank Ltd. 
of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Far more notorious are the exclusionary business practices of the insurance 
industry. Two of the state's largest insurance companies virtually refuse to 
sell auto insurance in minority areas of Los Angeles. This has spawned 
administrative legal suits by Consumers Union, Voter Revolt and the Greenlining 
Coalition. Partly as a result, Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie will 
hold hearings next month on redlining. 
</P>
<P>
But the practices of the insurance industry are increasingly out of step with 
more and more economists, educators and CEOs who believe that California's 
long-term economic viability depends on its business community developing 
partnership with its minorities -- which will collectively be the majority by 
the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
These minority-corporate ties are best developed voluntarily. But as the 
civil-rights struggle has demonstrated, government incentives -- and penalties 
-- are sometimes a helpful prod. Two of California's five largest banks -- 
Wells Fargo and Security Pacific -- currently have no minority representatives 
on their boards of directors. The chairman of Security Pacific, however, has 
pledged to have two minority board members by the end of the year. A typical 
major bank or savings-and-loan has less than 1% of its loans in the 
African-American community, less than 2% in the Latino. 
</P>
<P>
That is why the coalition is asking Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) and 
Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles) to sponsor legislation that would block any 
takeover or merger unless the acquiring corporation can demonstrate its 
commitment to equal opportunity. If passed, the legislation could break 
corporate resistance to multicultural opportunity. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 
dream of economic parity for minorities and corporate America's dream of 
increasing market share and profitability could both come true.

SAVING OTHER SPECIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many articles, of which "In Search of Genetic Diversity" (front page, April 26) 
is one, describe the value to us of preserving the globe's flora and fauna 
because of the potential of advancing medicine and agriculture from this gene 
pool. There is also the matter that destroying the forests may increase the 
greenhouse effect and inconvenience mankind. 
</P>
<P>
Rarely is it mentioned that species might also deserve saving for a nobler 
reason than how they directly benefit humans. I put some priority on the fact 
that we, a single, relatively recently arrived species and the other millions 
of species are sharing a cosmic journey that deserves continuing. 
</P>
<P>
Our brains have let us create civilization, the industrial and technological 
revolutions, and the associated human population increases -- to where now, 
while scarcely realizing it, we have assumed responsibility for the fate of the 
other species on this non-expanding Earth. 
</P>
<P>
I am heartened by how many people are willing to exert themselves to save 
species that do not help with medicine, agriculture, or the greenhouse effect. 
For example, Monarca is an organization that works at saving the Monarch 
butterfly through preserving its wintering habitats. I suspect that in the long 
run we will find that saving "unnecessary" species is more important than we 
now realize. It is not just being noble.

SELECTING JUDGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the article "Judge Says More Jews Belong on High Court" (Part B, May 5), 
Judge Stephen Reinhardt of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals asks "why aren't 
there two, three or more Jews on the (U.S. Supreme) court today?" 
</P>
<P>
The direction that the judge's argument takes appears to be divisive, even 
dangerous to national unity. 
</P>
<P>
If there is to be a Jewish seat on the Supreme Court as the judge proposes, 
then it would follow that there should be an Armenian seat, a Mormon seat, a 
Muslim seat, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
The point is that to apply a racial and/or religious test for membership on the 
United States Supreme Court is unconstitutional on its face, even if argued by 
a sitting judge. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, to propose that a number of seats be allocated to one particular 
group is blatant special pleading and affronts America's sense of fairness.

<P>
With the S&amp;L scandal growing daily, the Bush Administration now wants to 
get rid of the messenger, bailout chief Seidman (Part A, May 2). 
</P>
<P>
They are apparently angry with Seidman who has shown great independence in 
giving the public a true picture of this mess. Seidman says that the bailout, 
first estimated to have a price tag to the taxpayers of $100 billion, now looks 
like $500 billion or more. The public has a right to know that the politicians 
in both parties let this thing happen to us.

CATCHING ON TO THE HAZARDS OF FISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is a genuine nutritional irony: Americans intent on eating a healthier, 
low-fat diet are consuming ever-increasing amounts of seafood. In the process, 
they are exposing themselves to greater risk of illness, or even death, from 
food-borne contamination. That is an unacceptable contradiction, and it will 
not be resolved until the current chaos in the sea-food industry is replaced 
with clear, well-enforced federal regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) estimates that 64,230 Americans became 
ill from eating tainted seafood last year, while 22 died. During its most 
recent reporting period, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) found that the 
number of food-induced illnesses attributable to bad fish or shellfish exceeded 
the total number traced to beef and poultry. 
</P>
<P>
That is striking because Americans consume more than four times as much beef 
and three times as much poultry as they do seafood. 
</P>
<P>
To some degree, this high level of risk results from the fact that most seafood 
is harvested in the wild, where bacterial and chemical contamination cannot 
easily be controlled. More important, seafood remains the only important food 
source sold to consumer without rigorous, mandatory government standards or 
inspections. 
</P>
<P>
Such standards currently are enforced in the meat and poultry industries by the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture. To ensure compliance with its regulations, the 
department deploys a force of 10,000 inspectors to make daily visits to meat 
and poultry processing plants. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the FDA, which currently has responsibility for enforcing the 
minimal safety, cleanliness and labeling regulations that do exist for seafood, 
has 510 inspectors to oversee an estimated 60,000 firms. As a result, 
facilities processing fish and shellfish are inspected about once every four 
years. Of the 4 billion pounds of seafood consumed in this country every year, 
the FDA tests only about 2,000 samples for contamination. The situation is 
further complicated by the fact that 60% of America's seafood is imported from 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Congress is considering nine different measures that would 
strengthen regulation of the seafood industry, tighten inspections and decide 
which federal agency should oversee the program. 
</P>
<P>
It is essential that the law that finally emerges rely on mandatory rather than 
voluntary standards. It also should include federal certification of fishing 
boats, processing plants and distributors, as well as clear standards on 
chemical and microbiological toxin levels and adequate inspections to enforce 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Canada, Japan and the Netherlands have such laws; Americans deserve no less.

ALTERNATIVES TO PRISON SUIT CONSERVATIVE AIMS

Michigan Gov. James Blanchard says that his state will not build any more 
prisons after 1992, when the current $900-million, 27-prison construction 
project is scheduled to be completed. 
</P>
<P>
It is not that Blanchard is growing "soft on crime." The state simply can no 
longer afford the cost. Instead, Blanchard told a conference of the newly 
created Office of Community Corrections, he will be counting on local 
communities to place nonviolent, non-dangerous petty criminals in alternative 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't afford to send a five-time shoplifter to Jackson Prison," said 
Blanchard, who said he believes that keeping nonviolent criminals in local 
punishment programs will be the trend for the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
According to growth projections by the Michigan Department of Corrections, the 
already overcrowded state prison system (more than 22,000 are now locked up) is 
expected to top 50,000 by Jan. 1, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 53% of Michigan inmates are in prison for non-assaultive offenses. 
Nationally, 34% of all state prison inmates have never been convicted of 
violent crimes, according to Justice Department statistics. It costs $20,000 a 
year to keep someone in prison and, like everything else, the costs continue to 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
The national recidivism rate remains above 80%. The prison system does little 
but train and harden criminals to commit more crimes. But alternative sentences 
for those who are not violent have proved remarkably successful where they have 
been tried. 
</P>
<P>
In Georgia, only 16% of all participants in the state's intensive supervision 
probation (ISP) program are rearrested within 18 months of completing the 
program. In New Jersey, only 8%. In Illinois, it's 5%. 
</P>
<P>
The ISP program saves Georgia $10,000 per offender per year compared to 
imprisonment. In New Jersey, the annual savings per offender is $11,000 and in 
Illinois, $13,000. 
</P>
<P>
When restitution is included as part of the punishment, the results are even 
more startling, and rightly so. 
</P>
<P>
If I steal your car and wreck, it might make you feel good to know that I am 
sitting in jail, but your insurance rates will go up and your taxes, too, to 
pay for my time in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Wouldn't it make more sense if I was forced to work to pay you back, thus 
keeping insurance rates stable and not further burdening the taxpayers? 
Restitution also provides an important link between the criminal and the victim 
which is itself rehabilitative. 
</P>
<P>
The way to place alternative sentencing proposals on the fast track is for some 
conservative politicians to get behind them. Alternative sentences for 
nonviolent offenders is a way of getting tough on crime by reducing crime. It 
is also a way of holding the line on taxes, another conservative goal. With 
alternative sentencing, everybody wins. It's the ideal issue.

LAPD PROVES THAT MUSCLE WORKS; 
</P>
<P>
CONTRARY TO POPULAR WISDOM, A SHOW OF POLICE FORCE CAN HELP REDUCE CRIME 
COMMITTED BY STREET GANGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES LASLEY, James Lasley is assistant professor of criminal justice at Cal 
State Fullerton. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ask any criminologist about how the police fit into today's street-gang problem 
and the likely answer will be that strong-arm police tactics, at best, won't 
accomplish anything. Recent data shows, however, that street-gang violence is, 
in fact, declining in targeted areas -- in some cases dramatically -- and that 
police "crackdowns" have played a significant role in bringing this about. 
</P>
<P>
Experts long believed that only certain types of crimes -- robbery, burglary, 
auto theft, for example -- can be deterred by increasing the police presence. 
All the police officers in the world, it was also assumed, would not 
appreciably lessen the incidence of drug trafficking, assault, rape or 
homicide. Thus, it was but a short step to the general conclusion that filling 
a gang-ridden area with police officers would do nothing to curb crime. 
</P>
<P>
If the police were incapable of defusing the gang problem, maybe businessmen, 
ministers and counselors could. Yet during the time "social scientific" 
approaches were favored, mostly in the early '80s, gang membership in the city 
grew from about 15,000 in 1980 to an estimated 27,000 by 1988, according to the 
Los Angeles Police Department. Worse, gang involvement in such crimes as 
homicide, robbery and rape rose nearly 36%. Incredibly, roughly one of every 
four murders in the 1980s in Los Angeles was tied to gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
By 1988, Los Angeles residents were ready to turn to the police for protection. 
In response, the police instituted a variety of unprecedented gang-suppression 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
The first, "Operation Hammer," flooded gang neighborhoods in the South Bureau 
(mostly South Central Los Angeles) with officers responsible for detecting, 
identifying and arresting suspected gang felons. Most criminologists would 
advise that it is precisely such aggressive tactics that can aggravate an 
already volatile social situation without any payoff in crime reduction. But 
gang-related crimes in the police-saturated neighborhoods dropped an 
unprecedented 36% from 1989 to 1990, according to LAPD statistics. Gang 
homicides fell 45%. In the two other bureaus monitored for gang activity -- 
Central and West -- gang-related crime, on average, rose 26%. 
</P>
<P>
A second program, "SAFE" (Secured Area Footbeat Enforcement), deployed 60 
foot-patrol officers in gang neighborhoods in the Rampart District. Before SAFE 
was implemented in September, 1989, one long-time LAPD veteran described the 
drug-trafficking problem in Rampart as so bad that "first-time visitors to the 
U.S. would leave their plane at LAX, and immediately get a taxi to Rampart to 
buy narcotics from street dealers." 
</P>
<P>
When the program ended three months later, the incidence of burglary, robbery, 
grand-theft auto and theft from auto was down 5%; that of homicide, rape, 
aggravated assault 11%. Police also learned that the likelihood of a person 
being murdered in the Rampart District while SAFE was in effect was reduced 
five-fold. These positive effects, however, lasted only a month after SAFE was 
ended because of budget restraints. 
</P>
<P>
The third, and most innovative, LAPD anti-gang program is Operation Cul-de-Sac. 
It targeted the Newton Street area, where 37 drive-by shootings and more than 
112 assaults with a deadly weapon had occurred in just a year's time. Operation 
Cul-de-Sac called for a police presence on the ground, in the air and on 
horseback. In addition, warning signs that read "Narcotics Enforcement Area" 
were posted. Roads that could serve as easy escape routes were barricaded. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is too early to determine the effect of Operation Cul-de-Sac, 
preliminary reports are extremely encouraging. Only one homicide has occurred 
in the Newton area since the program began Feb. 1. Student attendence at 
Jefferson High School is up 30%. And residents are forming citizen patrol 
groups to regain control of their neighborhoods from gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Still, are these seemingly small rewards worth the investment in money and 
manpower? Actually, the anti-gang programs may be a bargain. The programs' 
average cost per month runs at about $83,000. The average reduction in gang 
crime is roughly 9%. Considering that gang members collectively commit about 
5,500 serious crimes a year, the cost of preventing a drive-by shooting, rape, 
robbery and so on is thus about $2,000. By contrast, the California Youth 
Authority spends nearly $30,000 annually reforming a gang member. The chances 
of success is one in four. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the effects of aggressive policing have not been systematically 
studied. But the data coming out of the South Bureau suggests that strong-arm 
police tactics may be the first, indispenable step toward cleansing a community 
of gang activity. By cutting into gang-related crime, Operation Hammer opened 
the door for community-based groups to move in and offer alternatives to gang 
life. Working together, the two approaches made a dent in gang crime.

GOP REDISTRICT PLAN GETS A REAGAN BOOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Joe Scott, Joe Scott is a Los Angeles political columnist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ronnie-Come-Lately: The failure of then-President Ronald Reagan to campaign 
hard for Proposition 39, a Republican-backed reapportionment initiative, was 
blamed in part for the measure's crushing defeat in November, 1984, when he won 
reelection by a landslide over Democrat Walter F. Mondale. 
</P>
<P>
The "fairness-not-politics" redistricting plan, which would have allowed 
retired judges to draw political lines -- and to which Gov. George Deukmejian 
contributed $800,000 from his war chest -- lost badly in heavily conservative 
counties like Orange and San Diego, an indication that GOP voters never got the 
message. 
</P>
<P>
Now, six years later, a suddenly energized Reagan, railing about the inequities 
of legislative redistricting in recent speeches, has jumped into the fray. He 
recently taped 30-second television and radio ads in support of Proposition 
119, the reapportionment-by-commission proposal on the June 5 primary ballot. 
</P>
<P>
GOP consultant Stuart K. Spencer, Reagan's longtime political mentor, said 
Proposition 119 is "much closer" to the former President's personal philosophy. 
Another GOP-backed redistricting measure, Proposition 118, which has an ethics 
provision, is also on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
In a "Dear Friend" note accompanying invitations to a $5-grand-per-napkin 
fund-raising luncheon on Friday in Beverly Hills, where he promoted Proposition 
119, Reagan wrote that no issue is of greater importance to California voters 
than "fair redistricting." 
</P>
<P>
His entire political career, Reagan emphasized, has been based on a sacred 
belief that "ours is a nation 'of the people, by the people, and for the 
people.' " 
</P>
<P>
Despite heavy GOP financial backing for Proposition 119, Reagan said it enjoys 
"widespread support across the political spectrum," citing such diverse 
organizations as the League of Women Voters and the Paul Gann Citizens 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The problem facing proponents of reapportionment reform, bracing for an 
expensive Democratic counterattack, is that a hotly contested gubernatorial 
primary is likely to lure more Democrats than Republicans to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
But the GOP, stung badly by the Proposition 39 debacle, is betting that 
Reagan's decision to put his political clout on the line will serve as a 
wake-up call to the party faithful -- and wow "Reagan Democrats" one more time. 
</P>
<P>
All in the family: Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dianne Feinstein has come 
up with a fresh gimmick in her campaign, a spinoff of the famed "kitchen 
cabinet" that surrounded former Gov. Reagan from 1967 to 1975. 
</P>
<P>
While the Reagan inner circle consisted in its heyday of fewer than a dozen 
wealthy male confidantes, Feinstein has put together a two-gender, 
auditorium-size group of more than 1,200 members to provide the financial and 
organizational underpinning of her candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
Members of "Dianne's California Cabinet" must give $1,000 to her campaign. In 
exchange, they get a small gold rectangle pin with a diamond. Raising $10,000, 
$25,000 or $50,000 more means a pin with two, three or four extra diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, DiFi cabineteers get to meet with the candidate and her advisers, 
discuss issues and campaign tactics and have access to position papers. 
</P>
<P>
Oh yes -- Dianne's cabinet offers the ultimate bonus to members: preferred 
seating at the inaugural. Assuming, of course, she beats both primary foe Atty. 
Gen. John K. Van de Kamp and Sen. Pete Wilson, the GOP-nominee-in-waiting. 
</P>
<P>
There's a bit of self-serving hypocrisy in a recent, widely syndicated Op-Ed 
article by state Sen. John Garamendi. The Walnut Grove Democrat suggested that 
the initiative process doesn't work, has become too expensive and is poor 
public policy. What Garamendi neglected to say was that the initiative process 
has triggered his candidacy for statewide office. He's a leading candidate for 
insurance commissioner, a new post created by the passage of Proposition 103, 
the insurance-reform initiative approved by voters in 1988. . . . The Westside 
fund-raiser that influential liberal Los Angeles publisher and economist 
Stanley Sheinbaum is hosting for Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae) on June 7 is 
the clearest signal yet that 1992 auditioning for the seat of Democratic Sen. 
Alan Cranston is under way. Boxer, a cinch to be reelected this year, is the 
most aggressive of several House members quietly beginning to mount unofficial 
challenges to Cranston, badly hurt by the Lincoln Savings scandal. Sheinbaum, 
known to believe that fellow liberal Cranston is politically terminal, likes 
the feisty Boxer, but remains uncommitted.

DEADBEAT PATROL ARRESTS 9 FATHERS; 
</P>
<P>
CHILD SUPPORT: INVESTIGATORS ARMED WITH 156 WARRANTS STAGE THE COUNTY'S ANNUAL 
ROUNDUP OF PARENTS WHO OWE PAYMENTS. 
</P>

<P>
In an unusual twist on a Mother's Day tribute, Ventura County Dist. Atty. 
Michael D. Bradbury held his annual roundup of deadbeat dads on Saturday, 
arresting nine of 148 fathers wanted for back child support payments. 
</P>
<P>
While he was at it, Bradbury set his sights on eight deadbeat moms. But 
investigators were unable to track down any of the mothers. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with their share of 156 arrest warrants, 15 teams of two investigators 
set out around the county shortly after 6 a.m. Most teams found bad addresses, 
nobody home or a brother, mother or friend claiming that they no longer knew 
the whereabouts of the wanted person. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, however, the investigators got lucky. 
</P>
<P>
"They never would have got me if I hadn't had that cup of Mom's coffee," said 
Keith Edward Baldwin, 32, of Oxnard. Baldwin, who owes $21,814 to the state to 
help support his 3-year-old son, had stopped by his parents' house on his way 
to a cement pumping job shortly after 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Clad in faded blue jeans and a red sleeveless jersey with the number 32 on the 
front, Baldwin was handcuffed and brought to Oxnard City Hall. There, a 
sheriff's van waited to take him and other arrestees to the county jail in 
Ventura for booking. 
</P>
<P>
The media, called in by Bradbury to help publicize his determination to collect 
back child support, also greeted Baldwin at his unceremonious arrival. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't exactly the way I want to make the news," said Baldwin as 
photographers recorded him bending his tall frame to climb into the back of the 
van. "It would have been better, maybe, if I was saving somebody's life." 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin cheered quickly, however, when he recognized the next prisoner who was 
ushered into the back of the van. The two men laughed and greeted each other. 
How are they acquainted? "Deadbeats," Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's blitz marked the eighth of Bradbury's annual roundups, which are 
usually held closer to Father's Day than Mother's Day. At a news conference 
Friday, Bradbury said the roundups are valuable in part for the arrests made 
both during and after the sweep but primarily for the publicity they generate. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to re-emphasize the need to support children. And if you don't, you're 
going to go to jail," Bradbury told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County ranks top in the state for collections of back child support 
payments compared to the money spent on welfare, Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
The nine arrested Saturday had a collective debt of $121,744, said C. Stanley 
Trom, who heads the Child Support Division of Bradbury's office. 
</P>
<P>
Trom said nine arrests out of 156 warrants ranks among the worst capture rates 
in the history of the roundups. Nine more people, including one woman, called 
investigators Saturday afternoon when they learned of the warrants for their 
arrests, and their voluntary surrender will bring the success rate up, Trom 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He expects 20 to 30 additional calls from the outstanding warrants during the 
coming week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Bradbury and Trom stressed that Saturday's roundup is part of an effort 
that continues throughout the year. On a daily basis, three investigators 
instead of 30 are out arresting people on warrants. 
</P>
<P>
The other investigators are looking for clues to people's whereabouts, 
preparing cases for trial, working on liens against homes or attachments to 
wages, Trom said. 
</P>
<P>
Countywide, about 4,000 delinquent parents owe $71 million in back payments. 
About half of that money is owed to the state, which has provided welfare for 
the support of children, Trom said. The other half is owed directly to spouses 
or caretakers. 
</P>
<P>
The 156 people for whom investigators searched on Saturday accounted for more 
than $2 million of the overdue child support debt in the county, Trom said. 
</P>
<P>
Typically the mothers who owe support were young and unwed when they had their 
babies, Trom said. In many cases, they left their children with relatives or 
neighbors and did not return at the promised hour or day. When the new 
caretakers apply for state assistance to pay for the child's upbringing, the 
state seeks to recover the money from the mother. 
</P>
<P>
For fathers, however, there is no typical case, Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
"They defy profiling," Bradbury said. "People come from all walks of life. 
There is an attorney in San Francisco whom we have an enforcement action 
against." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Colleen White noted one general exception to Bradbury's 
no-profile statement. 
</P>
<P>
"Most absent fathers spend more for their car payments than they do for child 
support," she said.

AIRCRAFT BUFFS IN 7TH HEAVEN OVER FLY-IN MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Airplanes were everywhere. Big planes and small planes. Old planes and new. 
Metal planes and wood planes. Some off the assembly line and some made at home. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 people and 300 planes descended on the small Camarillo Airport 
Saturday to attend the annual Camarillo Fly-in, Swap Meet and Aircraft Display 
of the Experimental Aircraft Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so pilots can get together and talk and show off their planes," said 
Larry Hayes, president of the association's Camarillo chapter. 
</P>
<P>
What began 10 years ago as a small get-together of about 20 pilots and their 
planes has grown to a group of about 300 aircraft owners, said Ken Clunis, vice 
president of the chapter. 
</P>
<P>
The two-day event, which continues today, is primarily for people who build or 
restore planes, Clunis said. Hobbyists can attend seminars about flying and 
building aircraft, see home-built aircraft projects under construction and 
attend a swap meet to buy parts for their planes. 
</P>
<P>
Compared with many hobbies, aircraft building is extremely time-consuming and 
expensive, Clunis said. A do-it-yourself kit can cost anywhere from $8,000 to 
$60,000 and require 1,000 to 3,000 hours to construct, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If my husband spent half as much time and money on me as he does this plane, 
I'd look this good too," said Pat Clearman, 52, of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Clearman and her husband spent about $40,000 to repaint, reupholster and 
upgrade their 1953 Cessna 195, which they often use for short trips. "We spend 
every weekend at the airport, flying it or polishing it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Building his wooden plane from scratch took three years and $7,000, said Fred 
Machado, 66, of Culver City. His "Boredom Fighter" is not a replica of any 
particular model, but it does closely resemble the type of plane flown by Capt. 
Edward Vernon Rickenbacker in World War I, Machado said. 
</P>
<P>
His plane is painted in camouflage with a fierce-looking American Indian logo 
on the side and has a machine gun on the top wing, complete with gun sight. 
Machado said he built his plane from wood because it was modeled after the 
World War I fighter planes. 
</P>
<P>
"They used metal for fittings but the basic aircraft was built from wood, 
covered with fabric," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Machado, who has logged about 260 hours in his plane, stores it in a hangar at 
Camarillo Airport. He used to fly from Santa Monica Airport but switched to 
Camarillo 10 years ago because the traffic is not as heavy and the scenery is 
more pleasing. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you imagine taking off from Santa Monica Airport and seeing all those 
houses below you?" he asked. "When you come to Camarillo, you see nothing but 
big, beautiful, green fields." 
</P>
<P>
Although many of the aircraft on display are handmade like Machado's and 
experimental in nature, accidents rarely happen because of mechanical failure, 
said Vance Jaqua, a 62-year-old aerospace engineer from Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
"The safety record of experimental aircraft is about the same as general 
aviation. The experimental part of the plane is not the high risk," he said. 
"Most accidents that happen are the same kind of accidents that happen in 
store-bought planes."

SIERRA CLUB PANEL OKS PROPOSED LAND SWAP; 
</P>
<P>
PARKLAND: THE COMMITTEE AGREES TO THE EXCHANGE INVOLVING BOB HOPE AND A STATE 
ACQUISITION AGENCY IF 16 CONDITIONS ARE MET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
After a lengthy and heated debate Saturday, a Sierra Club committee voted to 
conditionally endorse a land exchange proposed by comedian Bob Hope that would 
allow a developer to build a road through a 59-acre strip of federal parkland 
in Cheeseboro Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
If the proposal is approved by the National Park Service, Hope has agreed to 
sell 5,700 acres he owns in the Santa Susana and Santa Monica mountains to the 
Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy for a below-market $20 million. The 
conservancy was established by the state to acquire parks and trails in the 
Santa Monica Mountains and neighboring hills and mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Potomac Investment Associates, which has optioned the land from Hope, wants to 
build a golf course and 750 luxury residential units on 1,100 acres of the 
Jordan Ranch property owned by Hope in eastern Ventura County. But the firm 
needs 59 acres owned by the National Park Service for an access road to the 
landlocked tract, which is next to Cheeseboro Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it bothers some of you and your conscience, but saving land is our 
business, and look at the amount of land we'd be saving," Dave Brown, a 
committee member and a major proponent of the swap, said. 
</P>
<P>
But others bitterly complained that the swap would set a dangerous precedent by 
endorsing the handing over of open space to developers. They urged the 
committee not to endorse the land deal until an environmental impact statement 
is completed. 
</P>
<P>
"I am absolutely astounded at what's going on here today," Jill Swift, a 
longtime Sierra Club leader, said. "I'm shocked and disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
Conservancy Executive Director Joseph T. Edmiston, who urged the committee to 
endorse the land swap, said the club's support would be important in 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilderness Society, another major environmental group, is lobbying against 
the swap on Capitol Hill. A top Wilderness Society official has called it 
"absolutely outrageous" that the land exchange is contingent upon relinquishing 
federal public land. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, in an 18-4 vote, agreed Saturday to approve the swap if 16 
conditions are met. Among the requirements are that any road built through the 
oak-dotted Cheeseboro Canyon area not exceed two lanes and a stipulation that 
roads be tunneled through all ridges more than 1,200 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
The club also wants Potomac Investment Associates to donate more property to 
the National Park Service. The developer had initially offered to give the Park 
Service 864 acres in exchange for the 59-acre access road site. The club also 
wants the developer to agree to build no residential units on major ridgelines 
or in oak woodlands. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's endorsement was made by the club's Southern California Regional 
Conservation Committee. The recommendation will be sent to the Sierra Club's 
state Board of Directors. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, other members of the club and representatives of other 
environmental groups debated the issue for more than two hours. Many had 
patiently waited five hours for the agenda item to be heard. Fifty people 
crowded into the meeting room at the Towsley Canyon Park in the Santa Clarita 
Valley. The committee's chairman urged audience members to calm down when 
tempers flared. 
</P>
<P>
Sigfried Othmar, an opponent of the endorsement, lamented that the issue had 
divided the group. 
</P>
<P>
"The proposed land swap has the effect, if not the intent, of fragmenting the 
environmental community into opposing camps, making objectivity the first 
victim," Othmar said. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the chairman of a key House subcommittee agreed to postpone a 
decision on whether to block the land swap at the request of Rep. Anthony 
Beilenson (D-Los Angeles). Beilenson, the leading congressional advocate of 
preserving significant portions of the Santa Monica Mountains as parkland, said 
he wants to see environmental impact statements being prepared by the Park 
Service and Ventura County before taking a stand on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) last month became the first elected official to 
oppose the land swap. Rep. Elton Gallegy (R-Simi Valley), who represents the 
Cheeseboro Canyon and Jordan Ranch areas, has not taken a stand on the 
proposal.

REDONDO DEVELOPER ACCUSED OF DUPLICITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD FARIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The way Redondo Beach developer Mark Kavanaugh sees it, his apartment project 
in Manhattan Beach is perfectly legal. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Kavanaugh obtained approval from the City Council for a small 
shopping center in a Commercial Planned Development Zone near Polliwog Park. 
But instead of filing plans for stores with the city, the developer filed plans 
for a 13-unit apartment house -- something permitted in the zone without 
council approval. 
</P>
<P>
When he cleared the lot earlier this month, neighbors who expected stores 
learned instead that they would be living next to apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Critics accused him of a bait-and-switch operation, and in an unusual Saturday 
session a week ago, the council unanimously enacted an immediate 45-day 
moratorium on residential construction in the Commercial Planned Development 
Zone. The council also faulted the city's staff for not informing it that 
Kavanaugh had changed his plans for the lot a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute comes at a time when the council is discussing whether to continue 
residential uses in this zone, which includes the downtown business district 
and portions of Manhattan Beach Boulevard and Highland and Rosecrans avenues. 
The moratorium, which can be extended if necessary, would give the council time 
to decide that issue. 
</P>
<P>
Under current zoning, a commercial and residential mix is allowed, though 
council action is needed to approve plans for condominiums and shopping 
centers. Apartments and single-family homes may be built without council 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
Kavanaugh, who said he paid $700,000 for the property and has spent $61,000 
more on building plans and demolition of a gas station on the land, claims he 
is a victim of "after-the-fact zoning changes." He said the council should have 
removed residences from the zone earlier if it did not want them there. 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Connie Sieber, who said that numerous calls from residents opposed to 
the project prompted the emergency council session, said Kavanaugh "knew he was 
taking a big chance" by proceeding with apartments when the council had 
approved stores. Before approving the commercial development in 1989, the 
council had turned down a Kavanaugh proposal for condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
Although conceding that Kavanaugh acted legally under current regulations, 
Sieber said he should have been aware that permitting residences in that zone 
is under scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
A moratorium already was in effect on some home construction on Highland Avenue 
because of concern that it might harm service businesses in the area. The 
council also is discussing a comprehensive Zoning Code revision, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Denying that he was trying to be deceptive, Kavanaugh said that between the 
time the Planning Commission approved the shopping center last year and the 
date it went to the council a month later, he learned that he could build 
apartments and worked on that plan as an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"I had both balls in the air (and was) not trying to smoke anybody," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Byron Woosley, community development director, said the staff processed the 
apartment plans, and a building permit eventually was issued. In retrospect, he 
said, the council should have been notified of the change. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate broker Kenneth Giss, a spokesman for neighborhood critics of the 
apartments, said they interpreted Kavanaugh's shopping center plans "as some 
sort of agreement" about what would be built there. 
</P>
<P>
He said residents next to the property are concerned about traffic and a loss 
of privacy because of overhanging apartment balconies. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Kavanaugh accused Giss -- whose realty office is next to his 
property -- of "dictating how I will use the property." 
</P>
<P>
Kavanaugh said he will apply for a waiver of the moratorium so he can continue 
his project, but he doubts he will get it. He said he is discussing possible 
legal action with his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm out a lot of money and I feel this is unfair," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although some in City Hall have sympathy for Kavanaugh, no one says they're 
fully on his side. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bob Holmes agreed that the council, if it opposes residential 
development in the zone, should have moved earlier to ban it. 
</P>
<P>
But he called the Kavanaugh apartment building a poor one by density and design 
standards, and he said Kavanaugh "found a legal way in the system to apply for 
a building permit for this project, so the council . . . found a legal and 
moral way to stop the project -- a moratorium."

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS; 
</P>
<P>
MAN, 29, CHARGED IN ROBBERY, ASSAULT

<P>
A 29-year-old Thousand Oaks man who allegedly robbed a pedestrian and then 
tried to rob a motorist was arrested Saturday morning, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Ali Razavi, 31, of Thousand Oaks was walking in the 600 block of Westlake 
Boulevard at 7:12 a.m. when he was pushed from behind by the suspect, Arthur 
Kirk Stearns, said Ventura County Sheriff's Lt. Richard Diaz. 
</P>
<P>
Razavi turned around and Stearns demanded money, threatening the victim with a 
chunk of asphalt in one hand, Diaz said. 
</P>
<P>
After Razavi refused, he was punched in the face by the suspect, Diaz said. 
Razavi then gave Stearns the contents of the wallet, about $400, Diaz said. 
</P>
<P>
Stearns ran across Westlake Boulevard and flagged down a motorist, Diaz said. 
After getting into the car, Stearns allegedly tried to rob the driver, who did 
not have any money, Diaz said. 
</P>
<P>
Stearns then got out of the car at Triunfo Canyon Road and Westlake Boulevard 
and was seen by a passing deputy, Diaz said. 
</P>
<P>
The deputy, who recognized Stearns from a description given by Razavi when he 
reported the robbery, chased Stearns on foot, Diaz said. After a short chase 
through several back yards, Stearns was arrested. He is being held at County 
Jail, Diaz said. Bail is set at $30,500. PEGGY Y. LEE

CARSON CONSIDERS SEVERAL PROPOSALS TO CUT PROJECTED DEFICIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the face of a projected deficit of $3.7 million in next year's proposed 
budget, Carson officials are suggesting layoffs, a hiring freeze, higher fees 
for city services and cuts in city programs. 
</P>
<P>
Among the proposals are reductions in park hours, swimming pool programs and 
festivals in parks. Building Code enforcement would be reduced, the Community 
Center would be closed Sundays and the city Boxing Center would be shut. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the cuts, the city would still have to dip into its reserve funds for 
almost $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very serious matter," Mayor Vera Robles DeWitt said. 
</P>
<P>
None of the proposed cuts have been approved by the City Council, and Finance 
Director Lorraine A. Oten declined to say how many employees might be affected. 
</P>
<P>
The current budget woes follow protracted problems with last year's budget, 
which was approved in January, more than halfway into the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, city officials said they would run a deficit of $5.5 million, 
which would be covered by reserves. However, because of better-than-expected 
sales tax revenues and a freeze on capital outlays, that bleak projection has 
been revised. The deficit is expected to be about $1 million when the fiscal 
year ends June 30, Oten said; reserves are projected to be about $8.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
After DeWitt was elected mayor by the City Council last month, she and newly 
elected Councilwoman Juanita McDonald vowed in inaugural speeches to set the 
city's financial house in order. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew then that the financial condition of the city was getting critical. We 
have to get a handle on spending," DeWitt, who has been chairing workshop 
sessions on the budget, said last week. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald said the council is "working every week to see how we can trim the 
fat. My main campaign plank was to balance the budget on time and in the black. 
I suggest that we put a moratorium on (new) spending until we get this budget 
in hand." 
</P>
<P>
If the City Council approves the proposed reductions and fee hikes submitted by 
department heads last week, the initial $34.5-million budget proposal would be 
reduced to $31.7 million, and the deficit of $3.7 million would shrink to 
$889,000. 
</P>
<P>
Oten said a downturn in the sales of American automobiles during the last 
quarter of 1989 at large dealerships in Carson was a major factor in reducing 
projected sales tax revenues, on which the city depends for about half of its 
revenues. 
</P>

"The city of Carson has a great number of programs," she added. "We have to go 
and look at each department line item by line item and see what can be reduced 
to have a balanced budget. It is not an easy process, for the department heads, 
for the council, for anyone." 
</P>
<P>
The largest proposed cuts would fall on the Parks and Recreation Department, 
whose budget proposal of $9.1 million would be reduced to $8.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
One proposal would cut the number of city-sponsored festivals from 12 to six, 
for a savings of $32,000. The popular festivals include Samoan Flag Day, Cinco 
de Mayo, Tribute to Martin Luther King Jr. and a country-Western fair. 
</P>
<P>
To save $75,000, the year-round aquatic program at Scott Park Pool would be 
scrapped, affecting Carson High School, the city's Aquatics swim team, swimming 
classes and other programs that use the pool during winter months. To save 
$20,000, wading pool hours would be cut at city parks and restricted to five 
days a week during the summer, instead of the current seven-day-a-week program. 
Shutting down the Boxing Center would save $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Other savings in parks and recreation would be a $175,500 cut to eliminate a 
newly created five-person maintenance crew for baseball diamonds, a $122,400 
cut eliminating a five-member tree-trimming crew, and a $72,800 cut dropping 14 
maintenance aides for city parks. 
</P>
<P>
Closing the Community Center on Sundays, not hiring an assistant manager for 
the facility and cutting back on promotion would save $136,000. Eliminating a 
bus driver, and recreation, administrative and clerical staff would save 
$196,000. The city would also save $65,000 on its electric bill by turning off 
some lights on median islands. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to cuts, Oten said the city is likely to increase charges for 
recreation "not to make it prohibitive but to make it subsidized less by the 
city." Also targeted for increases are business licenses, building and safety 
permits, and community redevelopment approvals. Oten said figures for proposed 
fee increases have not been set.

TEACHING STUDENTS HOW TO SURVIVE IN THE WORKING WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Art San Juan sprawled back in his chair and sighed as Tracy Schmanski 
delicately tied a bandage around his splinted right arm. White bandages 
obscured his forehead. His left arm rested against his chest, caught up in an 
elaborate sling. 
</P>
<P>
Schmanski offered him little sympathy. She knew that San Juan would soon 
swaddle her in the same bandages and splints. 
</P>
<P>
Behind them, several people trying to lift a patient into the back of an 
ambulance stumbled and nearly dropped the gurney. 
</P>
<P>
There is always a certain element of disaster in the emergency medical 
technician classroom at the Southern California Regional Occupational Center in 
Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
After all, SCROC teachers are told to try to make their classrooms as much as 
possible like the working world their students will face. 
</P>
<P>
Down the hall, the pungent medicinal smells of a dentist's office are 
unmistakable. Disembodied jaws rest on work stands, permanently gaping open as 
aspiring dental assistants build molds and practice other treatments on the 
jaws' teeth. 
</P>
<P>
A few doors over, banking services students dish out play cash at tellers' 
booths that look as if they were transplanted from the lobby of a neighborhood 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
"Something special is going on here," said Anne Just, a researcher with the 
National Center for Research in Vocational Education. The center awarded SCROC 
an "exemplary" designation early this year, the highest recognition it gives. 
Just appeared at a recognition luncheon held recently at the Torrance school. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a place filled with a sense of professionalism, dedication and concern 
. . . (that is) helping students develop into mature, self-confident employees 
ready for a modern work environment," Just said. 
</P>
<P>
It is high praise for a school that started as an experiment 22 years ago with 
only six classes. The center has since expanded to more than 50 programs and 
has been emulated by schools across the country, including 69 in California. 
</P>
<P>
Created as a joint enterprise of six South Bay school districts -- Inglewood, 
Centinela Valley, El Segundo, South Bay Union, Torrance and Palos Verdes -- 
SCROC was the result of a growing sense among school administrators that 
individual districts could not afford the equipment and expertise needed to 
train students in modern job skills. 
</P>
<P>
As new technology required the use of more sophisticated -- and more expensive 
-- equipment in many types of jobs, administrators realized that many students 
were leaving high school without marketable skills. 
</P>
<P>
Using a patch of land on Crenshaw Boulevard next to Wilson Park that once was 
used as a Navy munitions dump, the districts created the vocational center to 
pool their resources and provide a higher level of training, SCROC Supt. 
Elizabeth Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
Their foresight paid off. 
</P>
<P>
Once the territory of high school students bused in from the 39 public and 
private campuses in the South Bay, the center now attracts more than 1,800 
adults each year, making up nearly 45% of its student population. 
</P>
<P>
The center's $6.5-million budget comes mainly from state vocational education 
money. High school students pay nothing for their training. Adults pay fees 
ranging from $50 to $90 per class. 
</P>
<P>
Each class at SCROC is grouped into one of 11 divisions: Agricultural Services, 
Business, Construction, Electronics/Electrical, Graphics, Health Services, 
Information Processing, Marketing, Personal Services, Metal/Machine and 
Transportation Mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the standard vocational fare of auto mechanics, machine shop and 
plumbing, students can learn a variety of fields, including aircraft repair, 
interior design and television repair, or train to be travel agents, security 
guards, gardeners, cosmetologists, hotel workers, computer operators or graphic 
designers. 
</P>
<P>
To stay up to date, administrators have five or six new classes in the planning 
stages at any given time. 
</P>
<P>
There are no class bells at SCROC, which operates from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., six 
days a week. The same performance standards are expected of high school 
students and adult students, who share classes. 
</P>
<P>
Except for a handful of special-education programs for disabled students, 
classes are not grouped by achievement levels. SCROC teachers, who are not 
required to have college degrees but who must have worked in their field for 
several years before coming to the center, are not told anything about their 
students' academic backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
The emphasis is on making students understand what the working world is like 
and teaching them how best to survive in it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a chance for young people to be exposed to an industry before they're 
pushed out there," said Beatrice Stepter, the center's banking instructor. "If 
they have problems adjusting, I have enough patience to stop and help them 
achieve their goals. That may not happen in the working world." 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, students who have failed in their academic classes are so 
intrigued by their SCROC studies that they get As for the first time in their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
"The students are very motivated," Nash said. "We don't have much trouble 
getting them to come to school because they enjoy it so much. . . . We imbue in 
our students that anyone who is willing to try can be successful." 
</P>
<P>
Edward Waffen, an administrator at the center, tells the story of one young man 
who enrolled in the automobile upholstery class and ended up mastering some 
basic math. 
</P>
<P>
"He was so excited to get in there and just wanted to do everything," Waffen 
said. "Then the instructor told him to measure something with a ruler. He 
didn't know how to use a ruler." 
</P>
<P>
Patiently, the teacher explained, and soon the student was adding and 
subtracting fractions -- and making some quality car interiors. 
</P>
<P>
The occasional lack of basic skills, combined with the growing complexity of 
many fields, have complicated the center's vocational education mission, Nash 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"In electronics, a teacher may spend hours on math and algebra. Machine tooling 
has the same problem," Nash said. "In our office classes, the teachers have 
revised their curriculum to include basic skills like punctuation, spelling, 
grammar." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, she noted, the workplace is becoming more sophisticated. 
"Where things are becoming computerized, we try to make sure we have that 
computer equipment in their working classroom so they know what is expected of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
At times, SCROC teachers refer students to an academic class or adult school to 
prepare them for the job-training class. 
</P>
<P>
The center also works with English as a Second Language programs throughout the 
South Bay. As the students become fluent in English, they are referred to SCROC 
training programs to find work. 
</P>
<P>
For some of its students, SCROC becomes the first step in their college 
education. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance High School senior Denise Robinson, 17, said she enrolled in the 
dental assisting class to see whether she was truly suited to be an 
orthodontist, as she plans. 
</P>
<P>
Now she plans to put herself through college by working as a dental assistant. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been really professional and interesting," she said, removing the 
mask and gloves she had donned to look in a classmate's mouth. "I always loved 
going to the dentist, and now I know that I'll love being a dentist." 
</P>
<P>
Adult students often enroll at the center to get started on a new path in life. 
</P>
<P>
Schmanski, the woman enrolled in the center's emergency medical technician 
class, said she had been a secretary for a couple of years after graduating 
from SCROC's office skills class, but never liked it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard to sit at a desk and look at a computer screen all day," she said. 
"It wasn't right for me." 
</P>
<P>
So, after spending the last eight years raising her two young sons, Schmanski, 
28, decided to go back to SCROC. 
</P>
<P>
"A friend told me that they have free child care, and I've always been 
interested in the medical field, so I thought I would try this out," she said. 
"Now I'm thinking of going to work for an ambulance company and maybe being an 
X-ray technician someday." 
</P>
<P>
Each class has an advisory committee of industry representatives which oversees 
the curriculum, telling instructors what skills they need their workers to have 
and helping find inexpensive or donated equipment as industry standards change. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, classes are constantly being modified to assure that graduating 
students will be able to find work. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, a company sends its employees to SCROC to learn new skills. 
</P>
<P>
When Garrett Automotive in Inglewood decided to move one of its manufacturing 
plants to Mexico, company personnel administrators realized that many of their 
200 workers here did not have the skills to move on to other positions. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to hire a lot of people right out of SCROC at one point," said Lenny 
Smith, who coordinates special projects for Garrett's human resources 
department. 
</P>
<P>
"So we thought: 'Let's try to turn it around. Let's send our people to SCROC, 
retrain them in something else, and see what happens,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen workers signed up for the evening electronic assembly class subsidized 
by Garrett. This month, 18 graduated, qualified to move elsewhere within 
Garrett or to another firm. 
</P>
<P>
"I always liked electronics, but I never had a chance to get very involved in 
it," said Juan Bent, 42, who has been working as a parts cleaner for Garrett. 
</P>
<P>
What he is doing now "is not the best of jobs," Bent said, but it supported his 
wife and three children. Now, faced with being laid off at the end of this 
month, Bent has a line on two other jobs within Garrett, both of which pay more 
than he currently earns. 
</P>
<P>
"I was depressed" about the layoff, he said, "but now I'm going to end up doing 
something I like."

HUD TO REVIEW DRAW FOR SENIOR APARTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM KOWSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has ordered the developer 
of a senior housing project in Lawndale to temporarily suspend the results of 
the lottery it used to select tenants while the agency reviews the way the 
lottery was conducted. 
</P>
<P>
Cooperative Services Inc., the Detroit-based developer that is building 
Lawndale's only apartment complex for low-income seniors, violated HUD's 
policies by failing to seek the agency's approval before holding the lottery, 
HUD officials said in a letter sent Wednesday to the developer. 
</P>
<P>
The developer also may have violated federal guidelines in not holding a 
separate drawing for handicapped tenants, the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
But because Cooperative Services did follow federal guidelines to advertise 
vacancies and seek applications, HUD officials said in the letter that they are 
likely to allow the March 13 lottery results to stand, as long as they 
determine that the drawing was carried out in accordance with their 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
HUD's position is disappointing to Lawndale city officials who say the lottery 
was unfair to Lawndale residents and elderly Latinos in particular. They asked 
the agency, which provided grant money to build the project, to order a new 
drawing. 
</P>
<P>
"What we wanted them to say is, 'You will redo the lottery,' " Lawndale City 
Atty. David Aleshire said. "What they're saying is that even though they find 
problems with the way the lottery was conducted, they're not necessarily going 
to make them do it over again." 
</P>
<P>
Mel Atkinson, Cooperative Services' operations manager, did not dispute HUD's 
contention that the company failed to seek the agency's approval for the 
lottery procedures but said HUD has approved Cooperative's lottery procedures 
in the past. He said that a copy of the procedures has been sent to HUD and 
that he expects the agency to approve them. 
</P>
<P>
Cooperative Services contracted with the city to build the 56-unit project in 
1989. The three-story building on 153rd Place is expected to be finished in 
mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
City officials brought their complaints to HUD in mid-April after the lottery 
results showed that most of the apartment's tenants will probably come from 
outside the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We spent over five years trying to get this development under way," Aleshire 
said Thursday. "Yet the end result is that only a small number of Lawndale 
residents end up getting a benefit. . . . There's a real error in the HUD 
program that there isn't something in this for local communities. It's no 
wonder that people end up fighting HUD and that the national housing policy and 
office is in such a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
In ordering Cooperative Services to temporarily suspend the results of the 
lottery, HUD required only that final tenancy selections be put off until the 
review is completed. HUD did not order the developer to cease processing 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, Cooperative Services accused city officials of wrongly 
advising elderly applicants that the lottery will be rescheduled and that they 
need not comply with requests for information to qualify them for an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Although city officials adamantly denied the allegations, Joyce Ellenbecker of 
Cooperative Services said she heard about them "from several prospective 
residents." The city is "doing a disservice to their own residents," she said, 
because applicants who fail to provide financial information jeopardize their 
chances of getting a subsidized apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Because housing built with HUD grants may not give preference to local 
residents, Lawndale officials originally wanted to sell the site to a private 
developer to ensure that the city's senior population would get first crack at 
the subsidized apartments. 
</P>
<P>
But after negotiations with two private developers fell through, the city 
reluctantly sold the site for $436,000 in 1989 to Cooperative Services, a 
nonprofit corporation that has built subsidized housing projects nationwide 
since 1945. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials assured the city at the time that local advertising about the 
lottery usually guarantees that more than half the tenants would be from the 
city sponsoring the development, Aleshire said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, city officials planned to send flyers to Lawndale seniors 
notifying them about the lottery. However, one week before the lottery was to 
take place, officials realized that they needed more time to get the flyers 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Carol Norman asked Cooperative Services to postpone the drawing 
one week, but the developer refused, saying it was against company policy and 
would be too difficult. 
</P>
<P>
When the lottery results came in, 52 of the 306 people who applied were 
Lawndale residents; of the first 100 names chosen, 17 were from the city. In 
addition, a disproportionate number of applicants who received priority are 
Asian, rather than Latino, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
After the drawing, city officials renewed their request that Cooperative 
Services reschedule the lottery. But the developer refused, saying it would be 
unfair to those who were selected. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter dated April 16 to the developer, city officials alleged that the 
lottery was not fairly conducted and that the "priority tenant list does not 
reflect the ethnic composition of the city and the region." 
</P>
<P>
Although Latinos are 28.4% of the area's population, they make up only 15% of 
the tenant applications, the letter stated. Asians make up only 6.7% of the 
population, but 36% of the applicants are Asian. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Latino) community, which by far constitutes the largest ethnic minority 
population in the city and the region, seems particularly under-represented," 
it said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials also objected to the formation of a three-member committee that 
interviews prospective tenants. The committee members were chosen from among 
the housing applicants, a system which "presents the opportunity for 
discrimination," Aleshire said. 
</P>
<P>
But Cooperative Services General Manager Fred Wood said volunteer selection 
committees have been successful in other developments and that committee 
members are instructed about the "nondiscriminating nature of the interview." 
The committee gathers non-financial information on applicants. 
</P>
<P>
To ensure that a wide range of ethnic groups would be aware of the drawing, he 
said, Cooperative Services ran advertisements about the lottery in five 
different newspapers and sent letters to 10 organizations, including the 
National Assn. for Hispanic Elderly and the Plaza de la Raza. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we have reached all ethnic groups that wanted to apply," Ellenbecker 
said. "We tried to reach all the communities. I don't have any idea" why some 
ethnic groups chose to apply more than others.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ROBBERY SUSPECT FLEES DURING POWER OUTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man wanted in an armed robbery slipped out of a hospital where he was being 
treated Saturday for injuries he suffered when his car struck a utility pole in 
Palmdale, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reported. The crash 
knocked out power in the area for about three hours. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Caufield, 27, walked out of Palmdale Hospital Medical Center shortly 
after the 7:50 a.m. accident on Sierra Highway, south of Palmdale Boulevard, 
Sheriff's Deputy Dennis Diederich said. Deputies using a search dog scoured the 
area around the hospital but failed to find Caufield, Diederich said. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the robbery were not available. 
</P>
<P>
The crash knocked out power from Sierra Highway to 30th Street East and from 
Palmdale Boulevard to Avenue R, Diederich said.

DESERT TO GET MORE AIDS SERVICES; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: AN ANTELOPE VALLEY COALITION IS TAKING MEASURES, INCLUDING CONFIDENTIAL 
TESTING, TO BENEFIT PEOPLE IN AN AREA WOEFULLY SHORT OF HELP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The Antelope Valley lacks sufficient support services for people afflicted with 
AIDS, according to a coalition of gay advocates and health care providers, who 
announced several new measures intended to help Antelope Valley AIDS patients 
and their friends and families. 
</P>
<P>
The most important service being introduced is the area's only free and 
confidential testing for the AIDS virus, said Alan L. Robertson of the Sunrise 
Metropolitan Community Church. Robertson's church is part of a gay- and 
lesbian-oriented church active in AIDS-related issues nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a breakthrough," Robertson said. "There is a whole broad range of 
needs that we are trying to meet. We have brought together a coalition of 
groups and pooled our resources." 
</P>
<P>
Although the AIDS testing and counseling announced Wednesday has been available 
for several months through the Western Pacific Medical Corp., a Lancaster drug 
abuse clinic, few have been aware of it. Even the Los Angeles County Health 
Department AIDS office was unaware of the program that is administered by the 
county and funded by a federal drug abuse grant. 
</P>
<P>
That lack of information dramatizes the special hardships and isolation faced 
by Antelope Valley residents with AIDS, who have to travel as far as West 
Hollywood for medical and social services scarce in the high desert, health 
care workers said. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition, which also includes organizers of a gay hot line known as the 
G&amp;L Connection, plans to offer counseling, create support groups for 
victims and their loved ones, and train volunteers to be caretakers for people 
with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
The need for services becomes more acute as the disease exhausts physical and 
financial resources, they said. For example, one Antelope Valley specialist on 
infectious diseases described the case of a terminally ill man who was in pain 
because he needed dental care, but was too sick to drive to the San Fernando 
Valley, where an AIDS program that offers free dental care is located. 
</P>
<P>
"The services that are there are limited, particularly in relation to other 
parts of the county," said John Schunhoff, assistant director of the county 
AIDS program. 
</P>
<P>
County health officials said that of the county's 9,069 reported cases of AIDS, 
26 were reported in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But coalition members said they suspect there have been considerably more than 
that number in the valley and that their testing programs and other services 
will give them a more accurate count. They said about one-third of those cases 
involve people who inject drugs such as heroin and methamphetamine, with most 
others involving sexual transmission. 
</P>
<P>
Although some people familiar with the issue said there is resentment of 
AIDS-related efforts and of homosexuals in the traditionally conservative 
Antelope Valley, Robertson said he rejects the label of a "redneck" community. 
</P>
<P>
"Stereotypes work as destructively against good, solid middle-American people 
as they do against gay people," he said. "We would not be doing this if we did 
not know that there is a network of caring people out there."

PHYSICIAN PLEADS GUILTY TO COCAINE POSSESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Torrance doctor already forced to give up his practice for a year for 
illegally dispensing diet pills has been ordered to check into a drug 
rehabilitation center and serve three years' probation after pleading guilty to 
cocaine possession. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Fred Bain, 62, will enroll at the Betty Ford Clinic in Rancho Mirage for 
at least four weeks of rehabilitation as part of a plea agreement reached 
Thursday in South Bay Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the agreement, a charge of driving under the influence of the drug 
will be dropped at Bain's sentencing June 19, Deputy Dist. Atty. Diana Teran 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Had Bain been convicted after a trial, he would have faced a mandatory 90-day 
jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
The charges grew out of a traffic arrest in November, 1988. Sheriff's deputies 
reported that they found a vial of liquid cocaine, 40 tranquilizers, 11 
hypodermic needles and $12,000 in cash in Bain's car. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Bain agreed to close his practice for a year after pleading no 
contest to illegally dispensing diet pills and to charges that he allowed an 
unqualified office assistant to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
He was also fined $5,640 and placed on three years' probation.

LONG POINT DEVELOPMENT AT ODDS WITH R.P.V. GENERAL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
O what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to develop the coastline! 
As the Rancho Palos Verdes City Council deliberates on how much leeway to give 
the Monaghan Co. in developing Long Point, many odd and strange happenings are 
coming to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
We learned, for example, (at a council meeting on April 17) that the entire 
concept of bringing a large conference hotel to the peninsula was dreamed up 
not by developers but by the R.P.V. City Council. After the rape of Marineland 
by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, the council worked out specific guidelines as to 
how big the conference hotel at Long Point should be and what kind of amenities 
and accessories the hotel should have. By their own admission, the council 
members said this was long before Monaghan ever came on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
What's wrong with this picture, you may ask? Well, the Rancho Palos Verdes 
General Plan is quite specific about the kinds of commercial activity that will 
be permitted anywhere in Rancho Palos Verdes. On Page 56a of the plan you will 
find the words "The City shall discourage industrial and major commercial 
activities due to the terrain and environmental characteristics of the city. 
Commercial development shall be carefully and strictly controlled, and limited 
to consideration of convenience or neighborhood service facilities." Both the 
General Plan and Coastal Specific Plan rigidly restrict commercial activities 
to very small, very locally oriented service facilities, such as mini-malls. 
</P>
<P>
If the general planners were that hesitant about permitting major commercial 
activities in R.P.V., you can imagine how horrified they would have been at the 
specter of giant Ritz-Carlton hotels, 500-room conference centers and attendant 
shopping malls, wedding chapels and sport complexes on the coastline, with 
inevitable traffic gridlock problems. The proposed Monaghan and Hon coastal 
hotels are completely out of scope with the General Plan and never should have 
been contemplated by council members. 
</P>
<P>
Further, we discover (per Councilman Hinchliffe on April 17) that when Monaghan 
said that he needed an 18-hole golf course for his hotel, the City Council 
magnanimously offered Rancho Palos Verdes parklands, bluff tops and federally 
donated parkland to build a golf course (public) to serve the Monaghan hotel. 
</P>
<P>
These abrupt departures by the City Council from critical policies and 
principles and restrictions of the R.P.V. General Plan and Coastal Specific 
Plan will have grave consequences for the coastline, for the city of Rancho 
Palos Verdes and for the entire peninsula. It will bring crime, traffic 
gridlock, added pollution and gross overload of all coastal facilities. 
</P>
<P>
It is time for the R.P.V. City Council to allow the citizens of R.P.V. the 
chance to vote as to whether they want hotels and a giant service community on 
the coastline. Finally, let the people speak.

FLOODING COULD AGAIN BE A PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The story on Sepulveda Dam and Basin (April 30) only mentioned at the very end 
that its major purpose is flood control. We may have forgotten during these dry 
years, but during one 11-year period, the basin filled up three times. 
</P>
<P>
Twice there were between 30-and 40-year floods and once there was an 85-year 
flood. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing some years ago, I asked the colonel in charge of the basin whether 
there was settling area to spare for the 100-year flood. He replied that there 
was not because so much land had been paved over and built up and the expansion 
of the Porter Ranch was contemplated. 
</P>
<P>
Have any readers seen Burbank Boulevard under 12 feet of water? Has the 
development lobbyists stood just north of Ventura and Colfax and watched the 
Los Angeles River meet up with the Tujunga Wash with a crash during a 
rainstorm? I have seen the water level just a few feet from the top of the 
wash. 
</P>
<P>
No structures that cannot be subjected to floods should go into Sepulveda 
Basin. Ball fields, golf courses and jogging/bicycle paths are compatible. Arts 
Park is not! Building up berms around them reduces the settling area and 
holding volume, increasing the threat to the areas downstream.

In reference to the proposed land exchange between the National Park Service

the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and Bob Hope that the "missing 59 acres" 
are now probably the most valuable land in the national recreation area:

POLICE ARREST 25 MEN IN PROSTITUTION STING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gardena vice officers arrested 25 men Friday on the 14800 block of south 
Western Avenue during a prostitution sting. 
</P>
<P>
The men were arrested at a local motel after they approached female undercover 
officers to solicit sex, Officer Dave Burch said. 
</P>
<P>
All but two of the men were booked on a single charge of soliciting 
prostitution and were released at the motel, he said. Two men were taken to the 
station and booked on an additional charge of being drunk in public. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies assisted in the sting by conducting a 
sweep of Rosecrans Avenue nearby, where they arrested six women on prostitution 
charges, Burch said.

AGOURA'S STELLE AGAIN SETS MARK IN 2-A 100 BACKSTROKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once, apparently, was not enough for Agoura High's Jason Stelle. 
</P>
<P>
Not content with breaking his own Southern Section 2-A Division record in the 
100-yard backstroke in Friday's qualifying heats, the junior shattered the mark 
again in Saturday's 2-A finals held at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Stelle swam a blistering 50.87 to break his day-old record of 51.26. In the 
process, he turned in the second-fastest time recorded in a Southern Section 
championship meet. Only Steve Barnicoat with a time of 50.68 for Mission Viejo 
in the 1984 4-A meet has swum faster. 
</P>
<P>
Stelle had said Friday that he hoped to break the 51-second mark for the first 
time. Agoura Coach Mike Mulligan was not a doubter. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just awesome," Mulligan said. "He always shoots for the moon and gets 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Stelle nearly doubled as a Southern Section champion, taking second in a highly 
competitive 200 individual medley. His time of 1:53.26 earned him All-American 
status but was a shade behind Shuichi Matsumoto of Laguna Hills, who turned in 
a 1:53.15. 
</P>
<P>
Stelle's near double-win was duplicated by another area swimmer during the 3-A 
finals. Sprinter Evy Wild of Hart took won the 50 free, swimming a personal 
best 24.38 (bettering her previous best of 24.39), then just missed in the 100 
free as Meredith Booker (52.25) of Beverly Hills squeaked past Wild (52.81). 
</P>
<P>
But one title is still cause for a Wild celebration. Like Stelle, she is a 
junior. "There's no strategy in the 50," Wild said after the race. "You just go 
all out." 
</P>
<P>
Wild's swimming was, for all practical purposes, the bright spot on an 
otherwise blank canvas for Valley 3-A schools. Crespi's Rusty King and 
Burbank's Casey Grigg placed third in the 100 butterfly (51.35) and 200 
individual medley (1:57.27), respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-A story was somewhat better, with Stelle's heroics leading the Agoura 
boys to a fifth-place finish (69 points). 
</P>
<P>
Harvard finished sixth and won a Southern Section championship in the 200 
medley relay. The team of Ryan Crosbie, Jon Paul, Mike Chang and Robin Lee swam 
a 1:41.57 to score 32 of the team's 64 points. Defending 100 butterfly champion 
Chang later took third in that event (51.22). 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' meet, Jenny Bissel of Agoura turned in third-place finishes in 
the 200 individual medley (2:12.64) and the 100 butterfly (59.96) to pace 
Agoura to a ninth-place team finish (45 points).

NORTHRIDGE WOMEN TAKE SECOND PLACE

<P>
The Cal State Northridge women had to settle for second at the California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. track and field championships Saturday night at UC 
Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Defeating CSUN in both the men's and women's meets was Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo, whose women won their ninth consecutive title. The San Luis Obispo men 
dethroned four-time defending champion Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The San Luis Obispo women racked up 236 points to outdistance Northridge, which 
had 150 points. It was the sixth year in a row that CSUN had placed second in 
the conference. Cal State L.A. (44), Cal State Bakersfield (41), Cal Poly 
Pomona (34) and UC Riverside rounded out the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's competition, the Mustangs won with 186 points, followed by Los 
Angeles (150), Northridge (141), Bakersfield (92), Pomona (17) and UC Riverside 
(12). 
</P>
<P>
Northridge's Kevin Hendrix was named the male athlete of the meet after winning 
the 100 and the 200 meters in 10.53 seconds and 21.17, respectively. Hendrix 
also anchored the 400-meter relay team that also included Chris Pippins, Melvin 
Jones and Wade Smart to a second-place finish in 40.79. 
</P>
<P>
"There's was no way we could win this meet," said CSUN Coach Don Strametz, who 
was named the women's CCAA Coach of the Year. "The SLO women were untouchable 
and our men had only an outside shot. We weren't going to quadruple people in 
order to score points." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, several Northridge athletes came up with some fine multi-event 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Gill and Tonya Conner became the seventh and eighth automatic qualifiers 
for the Lady Matadors at the NCAA Division II championships, May 24-26 in 
Hampton, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Gill won the heptathlon with 4,939 points and Conner placed second in the 
triple jump at 40 feet 3 1/2 inches. CSUN's Lolita Pile, who won the long jump 
Friday, won the triple jump at 40-4 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
Gill also placed third in the javelin with a toss of 123-11. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte Vines won the 100 in 12.17 -- 0.01 ahead of teammate Laural Isles -- 
and combined with Isles, Pile, and Kim Young to win the 400-meter relay in 
46.53. 
</P>
<P>
Isles came back to win the 200 in 24.72 and Vines was third (24.83). 
</P>
<P>
Other Northridge winners included Chris Perry in the long jump (25-3 1/4) and 
Cela Taylor in the 400 (56.16).

JONES DASHES 11.66 TO SET 3-A RECORD IN 100 METERS 
</P>

<P>
Marion Jones added the Southern Section 3-A Division 100-meter record to her 
growing list of credentials Saturday in the 3-A preliminaries at Camarillo 
High. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, a Rio Mesa High freshman, clocked 11.66 seconds to shatter the previous 
record of 11.96, set by Kim Grant of Hawthorne in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Jones already has established ninth-grade marks at Rio Mesa in the 100 and 200 
meters as well as the age-14 standard in the 200, records that once belonged to 
Angela Burnham, who won five state sprint titles while at Rio Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just going out there to win my race," Jones said. "I would have been 
happy if I just won my race and got the record in the final. But it happened." 
</P>
<P>
It happened with legal wind, too. Jones' 100 heat was run with a 
1.73-meters-per-second tail wind. The maximum allowable is 2.0. 
</P>
<P>
"Luckily the wind was going our way for a change," Rio Mesa Coach Brian 
FitzGerald said. "It always seems that the wind is 2.1 when Rio Mesa kids break 
records." 
</P>
<P>
The wind was blowing at 3.05 m.p.s. during the 200 heats when Jones dashed to a 
23.86 clocking, but Jones has a legal best of 23.80 this season. 
</P>
<P>
Jones also anchored the Spartans' 400 and 1,600 relay teams to a pair of heat 
wins. In the sprint relay, Rio Mesa timed 48.21, the fastest time of the day, 
to handily defeat runner-up Esperanza (49.40). 
</P>
<P>
Rio Mesa won its heat in the longer relay and recorded the No. 2 time at 
4:02.70 despite Stacy Rosemeyer running with a strained quadriceps muscle. Only 
Esperanza (4:02.11) ran faster. 
</P>
<P>
Alycia Burnham, another Rio Mesa standout, won her heats in the 100 and 300 low 
hurdles and qualified third in the long jump for the 3-A finals, to be held 
Friday at Cerritos College in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham ran a wind-aided 14.41 in the 100 hurdles and timed 47.56 in the 300 
hurdles. She also long jumped 17 feet 0 1/4 inches and ran second on Rio Mesa's 
qualifying 400 relay team. 
</P>
<P>
Hart's Steve Lepken came from five meters back to win his heat in the 1,600. 
Entering the final stretch Lepken sprinted past Jeff Matsumotoi of Mater Dei 
and Santa Fe's Jeff Fleming to win in 4:23.41. 
</P>
<P>
Matsumotoi and Fleming qualified for the final in 4:24.38 and 4:23.41, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Sprinter J. J. Alvarez anchored Oxnard's 400 relay team to a 43.53 heat win and 
No. 2 time overall. Alvarez also advanced to the finals in the 100 (11.11) and 
200 (22.71). 
</P>
<P>
4-A Preliminaries: Camarillo's Abe Valdez (9:16.24), Derek Kite (9:33.09) and 
Josh Gerry (9:36.25) all qualified for the 3,200 final. 
</P>
<P>
Eliazar Herrera (9:18.03) of Hoover and Canyon teammates Dan Berkeland 
(9:24.10) and Dave Hartman (9:28.09) advanced to the final. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Krill of Thousand Oaks recorded the No. 3 time in qualifying for the 400, 
a 49.71 clocking.

</P>
<P>
San Bernardino (31-13), which defeated Mission, 5-2, Friday, won the 
best-of-three series, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
Mission led, 3-0, and retired the first two batters in the fifth. But San 
Bernardino sent 12 consecutive hitters to the plate, nine of whom got hits.

scored Mike St. John and gave La Salle the San Fernando Valley League's third 
and final Southern Section 4-A Division playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
La Salle (15-9, 6-5) loaded the bases on St. John's single and two intentional 
walks. Esquival followed with his third hit. 
</P>
<P>
Bell-Jeff trailed, 5-2, entering the seventh but used Nester Villanea's two-run 
triple, his second, and Tony Cesta's run-scoring single to tie the score, 5-5.

ONLY SIX OF THE 24 remaining P-38 Lightning pursuit planes -- 10,000 were built 
for World War II -- are still flying. One of these P-38s can be viewed, as can 
60 other vintage aircraft and historic aeronautical items, at the Museum of 
Flying, adjacent to the Santa Monica Airport, through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
There's a Supermarine Spitfire Mark IX and a North American P-51 Mustang, as 
well as scale models of missiles, a mock-up of the Mercury space capsule and 
antique air-show posters. This superb warbird and vintage-aircraft collection 
has been put on display because next Saturday and Sunday the entire lot will be 
auctioned off in the largest such sale of pre-1948 aircraft ever held. Entry to 
this world-class event is $250; if that sounds steep, you may not want to pay 
the expected $1.5 million for the P-38.

WHAT? YOUR CAT doesn't know how to sit and stay or give you five? Then your 
feline is no graduate of The Cat Connection, the unique training class taught 
by veteran animal behaviortrainer Sandi Wirth, who discovered cats could "do 
more than anyone ever knew" while working with them on TV ads. And her own cats 
are living proof; among the four, they've mastered 67 behaviors, including 
hissing, crying and removing Wirth's glasses, all on command. 
</P>
<P>
Seven brainy cats recently graduated from Wirth's 10-week course -- her first 
ever for felines -- and there is a waiting list for her future classes. Using 
food and a comforting scratch at the base of the tail as positive-reinforcement 
tools, Wirth can teach her students a variety of behaviors, from walking on a 
leash to playing Frisbee. Classes are attended by cats (no dogs allowed, but 
bunnies and a star-student Siamese rat are) and their owners, some of whom want 
to make their kitties stars, others who hope to create a second bonding by 
working together. Why settle for a cat that just purrs?

A nine-week strike involving 900 Lockheed machinists who service Air Force and 
Navy aircraft in Ontario, Chino and Upland came to an end as workers accepted a 
new three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, approved by 88% of voters, provides a 5% pay increase and $2,000 
bonus in the first year of the contract. Smaller pay raises are included for 
subsequent years. Under the last contract, the machinists had averaged from $14 
to $15 per hour, said John Dailey, a spokesman for Lockheed Aircraft Service 
Co., a division of Lockheed Corp. The machinists, members of Local 821 of the 
International Assn. of Machinists, went on strike March 12.

SEARCH FOR THE NEW WORLD LAUNCHES MODERN TURF WAR;

<P>
PROTOCOL: THE CITY AND COUNTY ARE FIGHTING OVER WHO GETS THE SPOILS FROM 
CELEBRATION OF 500TH ANNIVERSARY OF COLUMBUS' VOYAGE. 
</P>

<P>
Although the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' discovery of the New 
World is still two years away, the city and county are engaged in what one 
official calls a "protocol war" over control of Los Angeles' celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley said it was insulting that a federal commission selected the 
County Board of Supervisors as the local coordinator for the 1992 celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the commission reconsiders, the mayor's office said, the city will drop 
out of the celebration, whose main event will be a parade of tall ships, led by 
replicas of the Nina, Pinta and Santa Maria, which will sail into Long Beach 
Harbor and other ports around the country, but not Los Angeles Harbor, 
according to the mayor's office. 
</P>
<P>
City pride and tourist dollars are at stake, according to Bradley's chief of 
protocol, Beatrice Canterbury Lavery. "This is not a silly fight between the 
offices of protocol," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Supervisor Ed Edelman said, "Egos are involved." 
</P>
<P>
"These protocol wars should cease," Edelman added. "Every time I talk to 
diplomats here, they tell me they're always in the middle between the city and 
county." 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors established their own office of protocol in 1983 after 
receiving what they considered casual treatment during a visit to Los Angeles 
by Britain's Queen Elizabeth. 
</P>
<P>
While Bradley played host to the queen and repeatedly was photographed at her 
side, the supervisors had to remind city officials to include them on the 
invitation list for a small luncheon planned for her at the Music Center, a 
county-run facility. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the city and county offices of protocol have clashed over such 
things as who should be first to greet visiting dignitaries and seating 
arrangements at dinners, according to officials who were present. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest dispute, Bradley said he was shocked by the selection of the 
county to coordinate Los Angeles' celebration -- especially after he traveled 
to Spain last year to discuss the city's plans for the event with King Juan 
Carlos I. 
</P>
<P>
The designation was awarded in April by the federal Christopher Columbus 
Quincentenary Jubilee Commission, based in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The county's volunteer chief of protocol, Sandra J. Ausman, said: "The 
commission wanted a governmental body that had the ability to bring together 
all the cities of the county. 
</P>
<P>
"This (celebration) belongs to everyone," she said. "It doesn't belong to one 
city." 
</P>
<P>
But Bradley, in a strongly worded letter to the commission, pointed out that 
the city spent three years planning for the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
"It was even more insulting that this decision was made without our knowledge 
or consultation," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The city should run the celebration because it was founded by the King of 
Spain, said Lavery, who is paid $56,104 a year. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the Spanish city," she said. "The county is not a Spanish county." 
</P>
<P>
Lavery complained that the county "never informed us they were going to compete 
with us. . . . The county keeps trying to come into our territory. I don't 
interfere in their territory." 
</P>
<P>
County protocol chief Ausman said the county offered to coordinate the event 
after being approached by a commission official and a Spanish diplomat who 
complained that the city was not making enough progress. Supervisor Mike 
Antonovich added that members of Los Angeles' Italian community also complained 
to him about the city's efforts to honor the Genovese sailor Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
Jana Joustra, the commission's public relations director, said: "We felt the 
ball had been dropped by the city. I don't know what they have been doing for 
three years, but they haven't been doing it with us." 
</P>
<P>
Last month's choice of the Republican-dominated Board of Supervisors over the 
Democrat Bradley had nothing to do with politics, Joustra said. The commission, 
although appointed by Republican President Bush, is bipartisan, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The county has established a local committee to plan events and raise private 
funds for the celebration. At least $2 million is needed to pay for the ships' 
visit, Ausman said. 
</P>
<P>
The replicas will duplicate Columbus' voyage across the Atlantic from Spain. 
They will sail into New York Harbor on July 4, 1992, then travel through the 
Panama Canal to arrive in San Francisco on Columbus Day, Oct. 12. On Sept. 27, 
1992, they will berth at Long Beach, where visitors will be allowed to board. 
</P>
<P>
Ausman said she is working on a way to include Los Angeles Harbor in the 
celebration and plans to invite city officials to serve on the organizing 
committee for the celebration. "I am hoping that all of this will be put behind 
us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lavery said the chairman of the federal commission recently suggested that "we 
might peel off one of the caravels" and let the ship visit Los Angeles Harbor. 
However, she said, city officials responded: "No way."

TOXIC SPILLS DISCOVERED IN LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several hundred people were evacuated from two neighborhoods in Long Beach 
Saturday after four illegally dumped 55-gallon drums were discovered leaking a 
highly toxic and combustible chemical known as dimethyl phenol, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of about 30 homes were evacuated in each neighborhood -- located 
about four miles apart -- while hazardous material teams cleaned up the spills, 
which occurred in alleys near the 100 block of Eldridge Street and the 200 
block of Eleanor Lane, said Sgt. Dennis Webster. 
</P>
<P>
Two drums of the substance were found in each neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported, he said. Residents were allowed to return to their 
homes late Saturday after the clean up was completed. 
</P>
<P>
Webster said police suspect the illegally dumped drums contained industrial 
waste, but investigators had not determined the source. The chemical, also 
known as xylenol, is used as a disinfectant, solvent and fungicide for 
pharmaceuticals and dyestuffs. 
</P>
<P>
In a possibly related incident, three drums of hazardous material, believed to 
be methylene chloride, were found in an alley in nearby Signal Hill on Friday. 
Four police officers exposed to fumes from those drums were treated at Long 
Beach Memorial Hospital for headaches and nausea, Signal Hill police said. On 
May 5, barrels of similar chemicals were found at 343 E. Esther St. in Long 
Beach.

JIM MURRAY: A TALENT WORTHY OF NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The thing about James Worthy is, you don't know whether that's a name or a 
description. 
</P>
<P>
You don't know whether he's James the Worthy -- like one of those old-time 
kings who were Charles the Great, or John the Good, or Richard the 
Lion-Hearted. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever he is, he's basketball royalty. He didn't exactly come into the league 
with banners waving and trumpets blaring. He wasn't "Magic" or "Air Jordan" or 
"the Mailman." He was just James. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, hardly anybody was throwing his hat in the air around the Lakers when 
they drafted him No. 1. A lot of people thought the new general manager, Jerry 
West, blew it. He should have picked the flashier Dominique Wilkins or the 
long-shooting Terry Cummings or even the speedy Sleepy Floyd. They thought 
James was Unworthy. 
</P>
<P>
When you're on a team with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, Byron Scott and 
Jamaal Wilkes, it's hard to get noticed. It's not that easy to get the 
basketball. After those guys, everybody else is Kurt Rambis. 
</P>
<P>
James Worthy didn't explode into a whole bunch of 50- or 60-point nights. He 
didn't spend half his game flying through the air like a Wallenda. He didn't 
win any slam-dunk contests. He was just, well, Worthy. 
</P>
<P>
He never showed elation when he won. He never showed frustration when he 
didn't. James never let anyone know what cards he was holding. He missed a shot 
with the same poker-faced resignation as he hit one. He almost never fouled 
out. He was disqualified only once in the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
He was as dependable as sunrise, as unflappable as a cigar store Indian. "James 
always showed this great dignity and poise," his coach, Pat Riley, recalls. "I 
remember when he first came up and we shook hands, I noticed his palms were 
sweating, but he had this calm, quiet look on his face. All he said was, 'Just 
don't call me Jim.' Somehow, a proper name fit. You don't need a nickname for a 
Worthy." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers got 40 minutes of impeccable basketball a night out of this Worthy. 
Somehow, it wasn't enough. The league knew about Worthy. The Boston Celtics' 
coach, K.C. Jones, was once heard to observe: "We knew what we had to do about 
Magic and Jabbar and Jamaal Wilkes. We had no clue about James Worthy." 
</P>
<P>
But the general public overlooked him. Magic was adored. Kareem was held in 
some awe. Michael Cooper was "C-o-o-o-p!" Worthy was just the subject of rumor 
mills: James Worthy was going to Dallas for Mark Aguirre. Then it was for Roy 
Tarpley. The story around the league was, West announced flatly he would resign 
if James Worthy went for anybody. They were not getting worth for Worthy, he 
told them. 
</P>
<P>
The moment of truth arrived when Kareem retired. Now, the smart money said, the 
Laker franchise would turn back into a pumpkin. Its lineup would just be an 
orphan asylum. 
</P>
<P>
The "orphans" only posted the league's best won-lost record, 63-19. As the 
season wore on, Magic Johnson-James Worthy became as effective a combination as 
a ballroom dance team -- or the Lone Ranger and Tonto. They moved in tandem. 
Whenever Johnson was double-teamed, which was most of the time, Worthy was like 
a man who had just been let out of a cage. "W-o-o-r-t-h-y!" rang through the 
Forum night after night as he flipped, shoveled, arc-ed or tapped in 1,685 
points, including 711 field goals, and took down 478 rebounds, praise-Worthy 
statistics. But Worthy does not make the top 10, just the playoffs. "James is 
the best post-up player in the league," Riley explains. "Our offense moves 
through James. Magic is the artillery, James is the shell. James cannot be 
handled one-on-one. He is the best in the league with his back to the basket. 
He's our first option going to the basket, and when Magic is double-teamed, he 
spots it instantly and goes right for the glass. He has the quickest feet of 
any post player I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
He's like a guy stealing a pie when he gets the ball. Of course, he got a late 
start in the game. He was clear up to 4 years old before his brothers could get 
a basketball in his hands at Gastonia, N.C. By the time he was 6, he had every 
move Elgin Baylor ever had. 
</P>
<P>
He plays the game in a pair of space-cadet goggles that make him look as if he 
came to weld the backboard. There's nothing wrong with his eyes -- he just 
wants to keep it that way. Earlier in his career, he got a fingernail in his 
cornea and doesn't like the notion of a repeat. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers seemed to have their boots off and their guns out of reach when the 
Phoenix Suns surrounded them in the opening game at the Forum Tuesday night. 
They scored a limping 18 points in the final 12 minutes to lose by two. One 
more loss and they might as well go to Phoenix in a blindfold with a chaplain 
and a Bible and make ready to go to lie down in green pastures. 
</P>
<P>
But Thursday night, James was Worthy again, and Magic was, so to say, up to his 
old tricks -- making the basketball disappear, sawing Phoenix in half. 
</P>
<P>
They only evened the series. When Phoenix won Game 3 Saturday, it was right 
back to the wall for L.A. The Suns seemed to be looking down the barrel at them 
and squinting for the kill. But, they still have to win four. And they still 
have to overcome a most Worthy opponent.

<P>
Well, I don't think there's any way Phoenix can blow this series now, is there? 
</P>
<P>
Who in his right mind wouldn't side with the Suns after what they did to the 
Lakers here Saturday? 
</P>
<P>
I think these guys are a lock to win the NBA championship, and probably many 
more to come. 
</P>
<P>
Having heard an earful from aggravated Arizonans -- before, during and after 
the 117-103 Laker loss -- I would have to agree with them that the 1989-90 
Phoenix Suns are the most magnificent basketball team ever assembled, not only 
in the history of the NBA, but since the dawn of mankind. 
</P>
<P>
They couldn't possibly choke now. 
</P>
<P>
Wow, what a ball team this is! I could hardly believe how good Phoenix looked, 
although my seat in Veterans Memorial Coliseum was up pretty high, and I had 
trouble seeing the game through all those championship banners hanging from the 
ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
What I did see was impressive. These Suns can play, and I will take issue with 
any California airhead who says they cannot. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, there is Tom Chambers, who lit up the Lakers for 34 points. Or 
"T.C.," as the Suns' radio guy calls him. 
</P>
<P>
(He also calls Kevin Johnson "K.J." and Eddie Johnson "E.J.," which makes me 
wonder if he also calls the President of the United States "G.B." and makes me 
happy that he doesn't regularly broadcast the games of Vlade Divac or Byron 
Scott.) 
</P>
<P>
Chambers turned the Lakers every which way but loose. He made left-handed 
lay-ups and running left hooks. He swished right-handed three-pointers and 
rattled home twisting back-door dunks. He faked out J.W. and M.T. and E. (M.) 
J. and A.C.G. and every other Laker he encountered. 
</P>
<P>
"I was stronger inside today than I had been in a long time," Chambers said. 
</P>
<P>
Sure was. In Game 2, the Suns used underarm deodorants that were stronger and 
more effective than T.C. He got four baskets all night, and pulled down one 
more rebound than a dead man. 
</P>
<P>
In Game 3, however, Chambers was one gun of a Sun who started out hot and got 
hotter. He also played the whole game with a smile on his face, even on the 
free-throw line. I guess if Michael Jordan can stick his tongue out, Tom 
Chambers can bare his teeth. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed a win and I hadn't been playing well," Chambers said. "Kevin 
(Johnson) and I are All-Stars, and the last two games you couldn't have picked 
us out of a crowd in a million years." 
</P>
<P>
Now, now, T.C. Don't be too tough on yourself. People here don't like it when 
anyone is critical of the Phoenix Suns, even a Phoenix Sun. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom's a great player," Laker Coach Pat Riley said. "He was hitting his jumpers 
and he was making his drives." 
</P>
<P>
As opposed to Jeff Hornacek, who was making his jumpers and hitting his drives. 
</P>
<P>
Hornacek scored 29 points. In Games 1 and 2, he scored a total of 30. He was so 
ordinary in those two contests, that the announcer wouldn't even use his 
initials. I think the Lakers should try returning to a dependable old tactic 
against Hornacek in Game 4 -- like guarding him. 
</P>
<P>
For a half, the Lakers were OK. "Very efficient," to use Riley's description. 
</P>
<P>
They even pulled out the old Michael Cooper Catches Rebound, Falls Down and 
Shoots Horizontal trick, which never fails when you're trying to snap out of a 
one-for-19 shooting slump. 
</P>
<P>
By the end, however, it was Phoenix that was pulling tricks out of its bag. 
Kevin Johnson even did the old Harlem Globetrotter free-throw bit, pretending 
to shoot the ball, then hanging onto it while those gullible Lakers lunged into 
the lane. 
</P>
<P>
Did it seem to everybody back in California watching television that the Suns 
scored every trip down the floor? Seemed that way here, too. If I had known 
that the Suns never missed their shots when they played at home, I'd have 
picked them to win the NBA even sooner. 
</P>
<P>
Between them, Mark West, Kurt Rambis, Dan Majerle, Eddie Johnson and Kenny 
Battle missed a total of four shots. Three of those guys don't even start. 
That's how great this unbelievably fabulous, undeniably wonderful, probably 
unbeatable Phoenix Sun team is. 
</P>
<P>
Know how many points Phoenix's starters scored Saturday? 101. 
</P>
<P>
The entire Laker squad scored 103. And that counted Cooper's goofy hoop. 
</P>
<P>
"We epitomized what team basketball is all about," Kevin Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
That's Phoenix for you. It epitomizes team basketball. When Americans think of 
team basketball, then by God, they think of the Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
Aw, shucks, Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons said. "We haven't accomplished anything 
yet. You have to brace for the Lakers every day, every hour and every minute. 
We haven't done anything yet." 
</P>
<P>
No. Really? Go on. Be serious.

<P>
Power comes in degrees. There is power that overwhelms and subdues. There is 
power that nudges ever so gently. Power can be inherited, earned, bought, 
taken, saved. It can be a most volatile possession. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, of course, has its own hierarchy of sports movers and shakers, a 
given considering the area's strong tradition of amateur athletics, pro 
franchises and college programs. Some of the members wield their clout more 
often than others, but few wield it more effectively than the 75 power brokers 
listed below. 
</P>
<P>
Inclusion on this highly subjective list isn't based strictly on money. You 
don't need to own a major league team or oversee a financial sports empire to 
earn a place among the Select 75, but it helps. High television ratings don't 
necessarily guarantee an appearance on the list -- sorry, Fred Roggin -- nor do 
NBA records -- our apologies, Kareem. Power isn't always measured by numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is it determined by streaks or titles. Track star Edwin Moses is a no-show. 
So is Clipper General Manager Elgin Baylor. The 
what-have-you-done-for-me-lately rule comes into effect here. 
</P>
<P>
About the criteria for selection: There were none, at least none that were 
written in stone. But as a basic rule of thumb, the nominee somehow had to 
affect change, to make a difference, however infrequent. Good intentions didn't 
count; results did. 
</P>
<P>
And now, a tour of the stars, beginning with . . . 
</P>
<P>
1. Peter O'Malley, president of the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
O'Malley is patriarch of one of the most valuable sports franchises in America 
and one of the most recognized worldwide. His Dodger organization is worth an 
estimated $120 million, to say nothing of pristine Dodger Stadium and the 
adjoining land, together worth another $100 million or so. And did we mention 
the vast Florida acreage owned by the Dodgers at their spring training facility 
in Vero Beach? 
</P>
<P>
O'Malley's influence within the power structure of major league baseball is 
considerable, if not understated. Appointed president of the franchise in 1970, 
he is one of only a few owners whose baseball team is a sole vocation and 
source of income. 
</P>
<P>
"We care a lot and it is a full-time responsibility," said O'Malley, whose 
Dodger Stadium office overlooks the playing field. "It's not a hobby. It's not 
a part-time responsibility. It is truly full time, every day of the week, every 
day of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Added O'Malley: "Unfortunately, a lot of people who own sports franchises have 
other interests that occupy a large part of their time. That's not the case 
with my dad (the late Walter O'Malley) or with myself. I think that's the only 
way to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mean to be critical of others, but if you look at the success of the 
teams, generally speaking, the owners or CEOs who put in the most time . . . 
will get the best results, rather than if they look at it as a second or third 
activity on their plate, or a hobby or a part-time responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
It isn't uncommon for O'Malley to be among the first Dodger employees to arrive 
for work at the stadium and among the last to leave. Asked when he last worked 
a 40-hour week, O'Malley looked amused. 
</P>
<P>
"Thirty years ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Considered a shrewd and selective businessman, O'Malley runs the Dodgers not so 
much as a family, but as an extremely well-tended garden. Harvest aplenty, too. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Dodger Stadium turnstiles turn often -- 2,944,653 times in 1989 
-- because of the O'Malley philosophy of providing family entertainment at 
prices a family can afford. His father began that practice. 
</P>
<P>
No other Los Angeles sports figure has better political connections than 
O'Malley, who learned the ways of local power from the grand master himself. 
Walter O'Malley introduced him to the city's inner circle and tutored him on 
the rules of coexistence. 
</P>
<P>
"More by example than by saying this or that," Peter O'Malley said. "He really 
didn't give much advice, specifically. It was definitely more by example." 
</P>
<P>
O'Malley observed well. He is on the board of directors of the Los Angeles 
Chamber of Commerce, and one of his most ardent allies is none other than Mayor 
Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
And talk about acquaintances in high places! When the Pope visited Los Angeles 
in 1987, it was no coincidence that the public Mass was said in Dodger Stadium, 
made available, of course, by O'Malley, who persuaded the National League to 
revise the Dodgers' schedule -- a game against the Cincinnati Reds was 
originally planned -- for that day. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike his more flamboyant father, O'Malley prefers to remain in the 
background. The day O'Malley unleashes a Steinbrenner-type series of public 
comments is the day the Dodgers move back to Brooklyn. O'Malley's use of power 
is much more discreet, more efficient, but no less impressive. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a power broker doesn't appeal to me," he said. "I'm active on various 
boards, Chamber of Commerce, others, but to be a power broker has never 
appealed to me. The only subject that matters to me is this franchise, running 
this franchise the best possible way. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not trying to run politics or City Hall or the county government or 
anything else -- Chamber of Commerce, or any other organization. My plate is 
full right here." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe so, but when it comes to movers and shakers, O'Malley is doing the 
Watusi, and everyone else is slow-dancing. 
</P>
<P>
2. Jerry Buss, owner of California Sports, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, Buss paid $67.5 million for the Lakers, Kings, Forum and a 13,000-acre 
ranch. Accountants swooned. Buss celebrated. He had pulled off a purchase for 
the ages. 
</P>
<P>
Even after selling the Kings in 1988, Buss remains a major player in the 
business of Los Angeles sports. His Lakers have enjoyed unparalleled success -- 
five NBA championships in 10 years -- and with it a wealth of local popularity, 
surpassing that of the traditional favorite, the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
He helped bankroll the Prime Ticket Network, which often features his team or 
Forum tenants. He also has given his blessing to an ambitious strategy that 
calls for a title fight each month at the Inglewood facility. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Fab Forum, it now answers to another name because of a marketing 
agreement with an area bank. The name change didn't come cheap, either. And 
just think if he owned O'Malley's team. Buss: "Tradition be damned, from now 
on, it's Farmer John Stadium." 
</P>
<P>
3. Bruce McNall, president of the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
In two years, McNall has managed to do the improbable -- revitalize hockey in a 
town that previously thought icing was something you put on a birthday cake. He 
brought Wayne Gretzky to L.A., a deal that surely ranks among the most stunning 
in sports history. 
</P>
<P>
The move gave the franchise instant credibility and confirmed McNall's 
reputation as an owner who backs his dreams from the depths of his wallet. 
</P>
<P>
Already, McNall has become a formidable force in the NHL hierarchy and makes 
little secret of his desire to own another professional franchise. His 
integration into the politics of L.A. sports is well under way. A man to watch 
in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
4. Anita DeFrantz, president of the Amateur Athletic Foundation and member of 
the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Who, you say? 
</P>
<P>
DeFrantz, a former Olympian, is this close to becoming the most influential 
woman in amateur sports. She is the first black woman to serve on the 
all-powerful IOC and already commands respect among her peers. Even given how 
slowly the IOC bureaucracy changes, it isn't inconceivable that DeFrantz could 
become the first woman president of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
Besides attending to her IOC duties, DeFrantz stays busy running the Amateur 
Athletic Foundation. Remember all that surplus money made available to Los 
Angeles from the 1984 Games profits? Yes, well, DeFrantz's Los Angeles-based 
AAF decides where it is spent. 
</P>
<P>
5. Gene Autry, president of Golden West Baseball Co. 
</P>
<P>
At 82, Autry still isn't afraid to pull the financial trigger when it comes to 
the free-agent market. The Cowboy spent $16 million to acquire pitcher Mark 
Langston, but then, Autry pioneered the practice of emptying his saddlebags for 
expensive little baseball dogies. 
</P>
<P>
Autry wields his influence quietly, sparingly. He brought baseball to Orange 
County in 1966 and his is a stable, if not underachieving, franchise that 
always finds heartbreaking ways to fall short of a World Series appearance. 
Still, there is something to be said for Autry's persistence. 
</P>
<P>
His ownership of KMPC Radio is noteworthy, as is his $54-million Western 
Heritage Museum. As for his standing in Los Angeles, recall that Frank Sinatra, 
Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. were the entertainment at a $1,000-a-plate 
fund-raiser for Autry's museum several years ago. And when the museum opened in 
1988, Mayor Bradley helped cut the ceremonial lariat. 
</P>
<P>
One other note: Autry's wife, Jackie, is no longer an owner-in-training. She 
helps oversee much of the Angel business operation. She is fast becoming a 
force in her own right. 
</P>
<P>
6. Peter Ueberroth, business executive. 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth's legacy is secure, primarily because of his management of the 1984 
Olympic Games in Los Angeles, a memorable event punctuated by grand athletic 
performances and the ability of the L.A. Olympic Organizing Committee to use 
gallons of black ink in its ledger. He helped create a blueprint for Olympic 
financial success, a formula so popular that the city of Atlanta is now using 
parts of it in its quest to secure the next available Olympic opening. 
</P>
<P>
The ambitious Ueberroth was still running the Olympic show when he was 
appointed baseball commissioner, a position he held until April 1989, when he 
returned to the private sector as co-chairman of HAL, parent company of 
Hawaiian Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth, an Angel season-ticket owner, moves easily within the confines of 
L.A. sports royalty. His resume assures him almost instant access to decision 
makers, a handy option should he choose to venture back into the public 
spotlight. Rumors of a run at governor, senator or mayor are rife. 
</P>
<P>
7. Tom Bradley, mayor of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
A sports solicitor extraordinaire. Bradley played a pivotal role, from start to 
finish, in bringing the 1984 Olympics to L.A. He most recently traveled to 
Orlando, Fla., in hopes of persuading NFL owners to award Los Angeles the 1993 
Super Bowl. That attempt failed, but it's the thought that counts. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley also is active in the continuing effort to keep the Raiders within the 
city limits and serves on the board of directors of the Amateur Athletic 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
8. Earvin Johnson, Laker guard. 
</P>
<P>
Powerful enough to get a coach fired, talented enough to win a handful of MVP 
awards and league championships, and rich enough to talk openly of one day 
buying an NBA franchise, Johnson is a city treasure. No other local athlete 
rivals his popularity or charisma -- not Bo, not Wayne, not Orel. He helped 
create a basketball dynasty of sorts and spawned a decade's worth of "Beat 
L.A." cries by opposing fans. The day he retires, Laker followers will go into 
immediate mourning. 
</P>
<P>
9. John Argue, attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Consultant to city fathers and resident voice of reason. Argue's father was 
instrumental in getting the 1932 Olympics for L.A. John Argue did likewise with 
the 1984 Games. His opinion is sometimes sought by Coliseum Commission members, 
as well as by Mayor Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
It was Argue who helped form the Los Angeles Sports Council, the private 
organization that now tries to persuade various leagues and international 
sporting bodies to bring their major events to the city's facilities. A most 
influential man. 
</P>
<P>
10. Charles Young, chancellor of UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the powerful NCAA Presidents Commission, Young has helped spearhead 
a variety of reforms that require the student-athlete to be more student and 
less athlete. Included among the recent changes made by the commission are a 
reduction in spring football practice days, a reduction in the number of 
basketball games and the release of student-athlete graduation rates by member 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Young, who oversees a $1.5-billion university budget, also has given his 
blessing to a comprehensive and controversial UCLA drug-testing program that 
calls for the school's athletes to submit to annual and random examinations. 
</P>
<P>
You will also find Young's name on the executive board of the L.A. 2000 
Committee, a blue-ribbon panel formed by Bradley to ease the city into the 21st 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
11. David Simon, president of the Los Angeles Sports Council. 
</P>
<P>
It was Simon who turned a heretofore volunteer organization into an actual 
budgeted, incorporated council with growing clout. The 39-year-old Simon is 
constantly courting the various professional and amateur organizations. 
</P>
<P>
12. Stan Thomas, Southern Section commissioner of the California 
Interscholastic Federation. 
</P>
<P>
To the 62 high school leagues that make up the CIF Southern Section, Thomas is 
all-powerful. Only the sixth commissioner in the 77-year history of the 
section, Thomas has been praised for his thoroughness, fairness and 
disciplinary nature. In 1989, the Southern Section was faced with three court 
cases in a 10-day span. The issue was player eligibility, and the section and 
Thomas won all three. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas also recognized the benefits of making corporate sponsorship of high 
school athletic events a priority, thus easing financial burdens. It was a 
controversial but innovative move. 
</P>
<P>
13. John Shaw, executive vice president of the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Frontiere may own the team, but Shaw runs it. He represents Frontiere 
at almost all league meetings and functions and is fast becoming one of the 
most powerful people in the league. Shaw is on the NFL's prestigious Management 
Council and is also part of a committee formed to resolve the many labor 
disputes between the league and its players. A slick negotiator, Shaw now 
handles only the most important Ram contracts. 
</P>
<P>
14. Wayne Gretzky, King center. 
</P>
<P>
The Great One transformed the franchise from an NHL wanna-be to a can-be with 
the stroke of a pen. Along the way, Gretzky has become the de facto general 
manager of the Kings, providing owner Bruce McNall with all sorts of hockey 
insight, including recommendations on trades. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky's influence isn't confined to the city limits, either. When Gretzky 
talks, the NHL listens, and now he has become a goodwill ambassador for the 
West Coast, supporting league expansion. 
</P>
<P>
15. Al Davis, managing general partner of the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly a mover these days rather than a shaker. Davis cuts a wide swath within 
the NFL because of his personality, time of service and, of course, some 
landmark court victories. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, Davis' acceptance of an invitation from Oakland to move his 
team has caused a much needed and overdue reassessment of the Coliseum as an 
athletic facility. Anyone who causes the bureaucracy to lurch into action can't 
be all bad. In the process, Davis has exposed himself as a master manipulator 
and a lover of high drama. 
</P>
<P>
And who knows, maybe Davis will stay put. Whoopee. 
</P>
<P>
16. John Wooden, former UCLA basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
A calm, soothing and constructive voice for college athletics. If the NCAA were 
smart, it would enlist Wooden's considerable experience as a consultant. His 
John Wooden Award, which is given annually to the college player who best 
combines superior athletic skills with an appropriate mixture of academic 
responsibility, is one to be treasured. 
</P>
<P>
17. Richard Riordan, Coliseum commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Riordan, a member of the city's negotiating committee, is the commissioner most 
active in the effort to keep the Raiders in Los Angeles -- a thankless job if 
there has ever been one. 
</P>
<P>
18. Georgia Frontiere, owner of the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Frontiere, the only woman who owns an NFL franchise, is a strong advocate of 
international play and helped start this annual rush overseas by NFL teams in 
search of exhibition games and exposure. 
</P>
<P>
You'll find Frontiere -- she will be starting her 12th season -- on the 
sideline during most Ram games, hugging and smooching a player or two. In the 
negotiating room, her management style is altogether different. Frontiere's 
front office has developed a reputation as a hard, sometimes ruthless 
bargainer. Put it this way: The team doesn't part with its money easily. 
</P>
<P>
Shielded from the media by protective staff members, interview requests are 
dismissed outright or simply ignored. Still, Frontiere remains active in 
community charities and causes, including a wellpublicized anti-drug campaign. 
</P>
<P>
19. Bill Daniels, owner of Daniels &amp; Associates. 
</P>
<P>
Generally regarded as the father of the cable television industry, Daniels owns 
the Prime Ticket network, among others. He has single-handedly help shape the 
way viewers receive their sports programming. Among his predictions: All major 
sporting events -- Super Bowl, World Series, etc. -- eventually will be shown 
exclusively on a pay-per-view basis. Trust him. 
</P>
<P>
20. Jim Murray, sports columnist. 
</P>
<P>
Only four sportswriters have won the coveted Pulitzer Prize in the commentary 
category. Murray, a 29-year veteran of The Times, is one of them. 
</P>
<P>
21. Ed Snider, an owner of the Spectacor Management Group. 
</P>
<P>
Snider is in charge of restoring the Coliseum to past glory. Also oversees the 
operation of the Sports Arena. He has plenty of practice in such duties. His 
Spectacor Group, based in Philadelphia, is the world's largest private 
management firm for arenas and stadiums. Snider also is involved in the 
proposal for a Santa Ana arena. 
</P>
<P>
22. Vin Scully, television and radio broadcaster. 
</P>
<P>
He isn't listed on the organizational masthead, but Scully, the voice of the 
Dodgers, is as much a part of the franchise's storied history as Sandy Koufax 
or the late Walter Alston. Not surprisingly, Dodger management types 
occasionally consult Scully about the team. Listeners consult him daily. 
</P>
<P>
23. Marvin Demoff and Leigh Steinberg, agents. 
</P>
<P>
Rivals in the same city, Demoff and Steinberg are two of the best sports agents 
in the business. Demoff's client list includes, among others, John Elway and 
Jim Everett. Steinberg can claim Troy Aikman and Warren Moon and, now, Jeff 
George. In many ways, Demoff and Steinberg have helped determine the market 
value of NFL players, present and future. 
</P>
<P>
24. Noboru Watanabe, senior managing director of the Marukin Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The man behind the acquisition of historic Riviera Country Club. Immediately 
closed memberships, improved the condition of the course and recently signed a 
five-year deal that ensures the Los Angeles Open will remain at Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
25. Jim Healy, radio sports commentator. 
</P>
<P>
Brash, noisy, irreverent and always topical, Healy is reason enough to click 
your radio on at 5:30 each afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
26. Harry Usher, chairman of the 1991 Olympic Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Usher, who rode shotgun for Ueberroth at the 1984 Games, is the man in charge 
of Los Angeles' Olympic Festival. The event is in good hands. 
</P>
<P>
27. Mike McGee, USC athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
Decisive, successful and an excellent fund-raiser, a must at USC. Can pick up a 
phone and get things done. Restructured and revitalized the USC athletic 
department, steering it carefully into the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
28. Bill Robertson, Los Angeles County AFL-CIO director. 
</P>
<P>
Former chairman of the Coliseum Commission is still a power broker. 
</P>
<P>
29. Don Andersen, executive director of Orange County Sports Assn. 
</P>
<P>
In charge of not one, but two bowl games -- the Disneyland Pigskin Classic and 
the Freedom Bowl. Depending on the availability of an Orange County sports 
arena, Andersen wants to bid on Davis Cup events, national high school all-star 
games and collegiate tournaments. First needs to find a corporate sponsor for 
the Freedom Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
30. Tom Lasorda, Dodger manager. 
</P>
<P>
Thin or fat, Lasorda is an L.A. institution. 
</P>
<P>
31. Peter Dalis, UCLA athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
Member of the Pacific 10 television committee and an accomplished 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
32. Barbara Hedges, USC senior associate athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
Hers is a career to watch. Hedges not only oversees all women's athletics at 
USC, but also directs all men's sports except football, basketball and 
baseball. Past president of the Council of Collegiate Women Athletic 
Administrators. Also served on the NCAA Television Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Built USC women's program from a nonentity to a powerhouse, collecting 13 
national championships since arriving on campus in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
33. Bill Russell, Dodger assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
The next Tommy Lasorda . . . without the diet. 
</P>
<P>
34. Wayne Lukas, thoroughbred trainer. 
</P>
<P>
Horseman extraordinaire. 
</P>
<P>
35. Jerry West, general manger of the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
As good a general manager as he was a player? Some say so. 
</P>
<P>
36. Fred Claire, Dodger executive vice president, player personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The man who decides who wears Dodger blue. He answers only to O'Malley. 
</P>
<P>
37. Pat Riley, Laker coach. 
</P>
<P>
Snappy dresser, elegant coach. 
</P>
<P>
38. John Robinson, Ram coach. 
</P>
<P>
His players like his style, his owner likes his record. Now if he can just 
figure out a way to dispose of the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
39. Lou Cvijanovich, Oxnard Santa Clara High School basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara should retire his whistle. A coaching legend. Won more Southern 
Section championships than any other coach and has more victories than any 
active coach. 
</P>
<P>
40. Marje Everett, race track owner. 
</P>
<P>
The power at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
41. Robert Kerlan and Frank Jobe, physicians. 
</P>
<P>
Surgeons to the sports stars, especially Jobe, whose client list includes the 
top names in the business. His most recent patient: Orel Hershiser and his 
injured right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
42. Donald Sterling, owner of the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
A real estate magnate, an NBA sideshow. His is the only franchise with reserved 
seats at the league's annual draft lottery. 
</P>
<P>
43. Robert Strub, president of the Los Angeles Turf Club. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1960, the man in charge of Santa Anita Park. 
</P>
<P>
44. Orel Hershiser, Dodger pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
The smartest pitcher in the game today. Thoughtful, decent and actually cares 
about the fans. If he wanted to, Hershiser could run a team one day. But right 
now, his first priority is to get his shoulder back in shape. 
</P>
<P>
45. Ken Solky, general manager of Murray's Tickets 
</P>
<P>
Who knows how Murray's gets the sweetest seats in the house, but it does. 
Murray's did about $20 million worth of business in 1989 and remains the place 
to go for tickets, from World Cup soccer to Laker playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
46. Chick Hearn, radio and television announcer for the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
Knows the game, perhaps better than any other broadcaster. And he even lets Stu 
Lantz talk once in a while. 
</P>
<P>
47. Dr. Donald Catlin, UCLA School of Pharmacology. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the IOC's medical commission, Catlin is the director of the UCLA 
laboratory. One of the top half-dozen drug-testing specialists in the world. 
</P>
<P>
48. Larry Smith, USC football coach. 
</P>
<P>
Three consecutive Rose Bowl appearances and a 27-8-1 record have everyone 
convinced: The man knows how to coach. He is, however, 0-1 in pregame warm-ups 
at Notre Dame. Restored discipline and fundamentals to a program sorely in need 
of some. 
</P>
<P>
49. Terry Donahue, UCLA football coach. 
</P>
<P>
A 3-7-1 record in 1989 doesn't disminish Donahue's sparkling resume. 
</P>
<P>
50. John French, executive director of the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Overseer of the grandaddy of them all. 
</P>
<P>
51. George Raveling, USC basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
Hasn't quite turned the Trojan program around but is well respected within the 
coaching profession. Opinionated and diverse. 
</P>
<P>
52. Lloyd Arnold, owner of Los Alamitos Racing Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance is up 28.5%, and overall handle is up 24% since Arnold, a nationally 
recognized harness racing executive, took over last fall. 
</P>
<P>
53. Charlie Pasarell, entrepreneur. 
</P>
<P>
Still a force in the tennis world. The former player plans to build a 
20,000-seat tennis stadium at La Quinta. 
</P>
<P>
54. Mike Port, executive vice president, general manager and chief operating 
officer of the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Leads the league in front-office titles but trails in pennants. Studious, 
efficient and desperate to give the Autrys a World Series appearance. 
</P>
<P>
55. Alan Rothenberg, general counsel of the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
Memo to Donald Sterling: Switch places with Rothenberg. Trust us. 
</P>
<P>
56. Christopher Pook, president of Grand Prix Assn. of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The brains behind the Long Beach Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>

FOUR CHAMPIONSHIPS IS QUEST OF WHELCHEL AT OFF-ROAD EVENT

When it comes to racing in the desert, off-road driver Jerry Whelchel of 
Mission Viejo has a simple slogan: "I'll race whenever, wherever or whatever it 
takes to win. This is how I make my living and I want to win them all." 
</P>
<P>
Whelchel, 29, can win more titles than any driver in the 17-year history of the 
SCORE Off-Road World Championships today when he competes on a man-made, 
1.1-mile course at the Phoenix International Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
Whelchel qualified in unlimited single-seat dune buggies, limited 1650cc 
single-seat dune buggies, 1600cc Baja Bug and stock four-wheel drive trucks 
Saturday before 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Mears of Bakersfield and Frank Arciero of Laguna Niguel each have won 
three events in a day. Mears accomplished the feat twice, in 1978 and 1982. 
Arciero won three events in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Whelchel's top competition figures to be Robby Gordon, 21, of Orange, who 
became the top qualifier in the two-wheel drive truck and 1650cc single-seat 
dune buggy classes with his first-place finishes Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon later announced that he would enter his 1650cc buggy in the unlimited 
class, setting up a showdown with Whelchel for honors as the fastest driver on 
the course, which is half pavement and half dirt. 
</P>
<P>
Whelchel seemingly never left the track Saturday, jumping out of one vehicle 
for Lloyd Sukut's Sage Council Racing team and into another for an eight-lap 
race. The only events he failed to enter were the motorcycle and All-Terrain 
Vehicle (ATV) classes. TOM HAMILTON

IT RAINS ON A PARADE OF ANDRETTIS AT INDY; 
</P>

MOTOR RACING: MARIO, SONS MICHAEL AND JEFF AND NEPHEW JOHN COULD BE THE RACE'S 
FIRST FOUR-CAR FAMILY. QUALIFYING IS POSTPONED TO TODAY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Mario Andretti is celebrating his Silver Anniversary as an Indianapolis 500 
driver, and he would like nothing better than to have his family become the 
first to have four drivers in the race. 
</P>
<P>
Mario, son Michael and nephew John have been in the past two 500s, equaling a 
family record set by the Whittington brothers, Don, Bill and Dale, in 1982. 
This year, Mario's second son, Jeff, is making his first attempt to join the 
family in the race. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy rain Saturday wiped out what was to have been the first day of qualifying 
for the 74th Indianapolis 500, but it was a welcome sight to the Andretti clan. 
Prospects are for more rain today, and if that occurs and the four-lap time 
trials are delayed until next weekend, it would be even better for them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a tough week, trying to get our cars sorted out, so a delay would 
help us," said Mario Andretti, who won the 500 in 1969 and has been frustrated 
since in trying to get No. 2. "Little Al (Unser) and the Penskes showed us what 
can be done Friday, but we do need more time to figure out how they're going so 
fast and we're not." 
</P>
<P>
Unser ran 228.502 m.p.h. in a Lola-Chevy in the late afternoon Friday, the 
fastest lap ever at Indy. It was well ahead of Rick Mears' official record of 
224.254 and his unofficial 226.231, both run last year. 
</P>
<P>
Two Penske-Chevrolets, driven by defending 500 champion Emerson Fittipaldi and 
Mears, also were faster than 226 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The fastest Andretti speeds, both in Haas-Newman Lola-Chevys, are 225.655 
m.p.h. by Mario and 223.453 by Michael. John, in a March Porsche, did 220.913. 
</P>
<P>
"Seeing Little Al's 228 shows me that it can be done, but he got a perfect tow 
from Emmo (Fittipaldi) and caught a good one," Mario said. "It was a (public 
relations) lap, not a true indication of what to expect when qualifying starts. 
When you're out there all alone, the speeds tend to slow down, maybe two or 
three miles an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"When a car's ahead of you, as long as you can see it, you get a tow, just like 
the draft in NASCAR. Even if it's a long ways down the track, it punches a hole 
in the air that has to help. When you're running alone, you can feel the 
difference, and it shows on the clock, too." 
</P>
<P>
Hopes of having four Andrettis in the 500 took a setback Friday when Jeff hit 
oil dropped by Tero Palmroth's Lola Cosworth and slammed into the wall in the 
middle of the fourth turn. 
</P>
<P>
"I was following Tero and he was black flagged for leaking oil, so I backed off 
just to be safe," Jeff said. "Then the back of the car came around with no 
warning." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff, 26, was hospitalized briefly at Hanna Medical Center for a bruised left 
knee, but was released to drive. 
</P>
<P>
"Jeff's OK, but it looks like we'll have to get him another car so he can be 
ready next week," Mario said. "We're trying to get one from Carl Haas that 
Michael and I drove last year." 
</P>
<P>
It won't be quite the same. Instead of a Chevy engine, which Mario and Michael 
have, the new car will have a slower Cosworth. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Leighton, co-owner of the Jeff's car, said he thought the crew could get 
the original car repaired by the middle of the week. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we can pick up right where we left off," Jeff said. "We won't lose any 
momentum. Hopefully, Mother Nature will rule in our favor and rain out this 
first weekend of qualifying." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Andretti is unique in one respect -- he had never sat in an Indy car 
before driving in rookie orientation last month. 
</P>
<P>
"Jeff's the truest rookie out here," his brother Michael said. "All of the 
other guys have at least driven in a race or two, but Jeff came here last month 
and took to the place. 
</P>
<P>
"He has always been strongest on the ovals, especially the fast ovals, so 
Indianapolis was a natural for him. He is one of the smoothest drivers I have 
ever seen, and that's what it takes here. I think we're going to see a strong 
rookie run from him." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Andretti has a powerful legacy to follow. His father was rookie of the 
year in 1965 and his brother co-rookie of the year (with Roberto Guerrero) in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
The youngest Andretti's racing background has been in karts, in which he won 21 
of 43 events in 1981-82; in Formula Fords, as Sports Car Club of America rookie 
of the year in 1984 when he won six of 13 races; in Super Vees, in which he was 
co-rookie of the year in 1985; and in the American Racing Series in 1986-87-88. 
</P>
<P>
His biggest moment in racing to date came in 1986 when he won his first ARS 
race at Pocono, the same weekend that Mario won an Indy car race in which 
Michael had started on the pole. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the biggest thrill I ever had in racing," Mario Andretti said of the 
weekend. "It was something you could never program, having all of us on the 
podium at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Michael, 27, sees distinctive differences in the beginnings of his career, now 
in its eighth Indy car season, and Jeff's. 
</P>
<P>
"Jeff has had a tough road because he found it hard to get sponsorships, and 
you can't run good equipment without sponsorship," he said. "That's the 
toughest part of this business, lining up sponsors. When I started out, I was 
fortunate to have good equipment and caught the attention of the right people. 
</P>
<P>
"It all comes down to having a good race car under you. When I came here for my 
rookie year, I felt I had a legitimate contender to win the race, and that 
feeling did a lot toward pushing me along. 
</P>
<P>
"I had already driven some fast laps at Indy before I ever took rookie 
orientation, so it wasn't new to me the way it was to Jeff." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his obvious disappointment at not being able to match the Unser and 
Penske team speeds, Mario Andretti says that the inclination to coach Jeff has 
not been a distraction to his own effort. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certain things I can tell him or Michael can tell him," Mario said, 
"but ultimately he has to do it on his own. We talked to him about his line 
(around Indianapolis Motor Speedway's 2.5-mile rectangular oval), and he 
listened and he picked up five miles an hour in a short time." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Andretti's fastest lap has been 209.001 m.p.h., run Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"What I like about him is that he is well aware of what he's doing, and he's 
not in over his head," Mario Andretti said. "He went through rookie orientation 
very impressively. Basically, he's on his own. When we have a break in 
practice, we go over and see what's going on with his car, but that's about 
all." 
</P>
<P>
Nor does Mario see much significance in the fact that this is his Silver 
Anniversary race. 
</P>
<P>
"No way, in my wildest dreams, could I have imagined that I'd be coming here 
with my two sons 25 years after my rookie year," he said, "but as far as 
celebrating is concerned, we'll celebrate if we win. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't, we'll wait for 26."

<P>
When Esa Tikkanen scored a short-handed goal early in the first period, it 
seemed as though it was going to be the Edmonton Oilers' night. 
</P>
<P>
Tikkanen's goal at 2:01 of the first period, and a four-goal burst in the 
second, led the Oilers to an 8-4 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks Saturday 
night and into the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a feeling we needed a great start or we might be in trouble," Tikkanen 
said. "A 1-0 lead is important in this building." 
</P>
<P>
The best-of-seven championship round will start Tuesday night in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal from the start has been to win the Stanley Cup," said captain Mark 
Messier, one of eight Oilers to score. "We had to get here to get to the 
Stanley Cup. We're going to relax for a day and then worry about Boston." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the score and the fact the Oilers won the series in six games, Coach 
John Muckler said: "It wasn't easy. The short-handed goal certainly helped us. 
Naturally, the second period decided the game. We started playing too easy in 
the third period." 
</P>
<P>
When the Blackhawks pulled to 8-4 midway in the final period, Muckler called a 
20-second timeout. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them to keep their composure and that we were playing too easy," 
Muckler said. "We couldn't sit back and let Chicago come to us. In the end, 
speed and physical play took over." 
</P>
<P>
Muckler and Messier both said the pivotal game in the series was when the 
Oilers won Game 4, 4-2, last Tuesday to even the series. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the series turned around when we won at Chicago and then won back at 
Edmonton," Muckler said. 
</P>
<P>
Blackhawk Coach Mike Keenan said fatigue was a factor for his team. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew that at the beginning," said Keenan, whose team played seven-game 
series against both Minnesota and St. Louis while Edmonton had an eight-day 
rest after sweeping Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers will be seeking a fifth Stanley Cup. They won it in 1984, 1985, 1987 
and 1988. Against Boston this year, the Oilers were 0-2-1. They had a 3-3 tie 
at Edmonton but lost 3-0 and 6-2 at Boston.

ARBITRATOR LIKELY TO DECIDE WINFIELD'S STATUS; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: PORT HINTS OF RESTRUCTURING DEAL FOR YANKEE OUTFIELDER, WHO GOES BACK TO 
NEW YORK TO PONDER HIS FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Instead of the "cab to limbo" he had jokingly requested, Dave Winfield took a 
plane to New York Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
There he will wait, as indications grow stronger that an arbitrator will decide 
whether Winfield's status as a "10-and-five" player -- 10 years of major league 
service, five of them with the same team -- empowers him to veto the New York 
Yankees' attempt to trade him to the Angels Friday for pitcher Mike Witt. 
</P>
<P>
It remains unclear whether the Angels would be entitled to other compensation 
from the Yankees should the arbitrator rule that Winfield can reject the trade. 
Angel General Manager Mike Port said Saturday that Witt is gone, but a decision 
upholding Winfield's position could result in restructuring of the deal. "That 
may be, although it's not required," Port said. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield's agent, Jeff Klein, said Saturday that the issue "in my mind . . . is 
headed to an arbitrator's decision on the '10-and-five' right," adding that he 
expected to discuss the issues at length today with Winfield. 
</P>
<P>
Klein also said that had the Yankees given advance notice to Winfield, whom 
they claim they were able to trade because the Angels were among the seven 
teams he had listed as acceptable trade destinations, the 38-year-old 
outfielder might have acquiesced without a fuss. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly would have been a more constructive environment," Klein said. "As 
I suggested to a couple of the Yankee lawyers who called me just before it was 
announced, it would have made more sense for me to talk to Dave first, or for 
Dave to talk to Mike Port first. That's not the way they chose to handle it." 
</P>
<P>
Don Fehr, executive director of the Major League Baseball Players' Assn., said 
Saturday that "preliminary discussions" have been held with the Player 
Relations Committee to schedule a hearing next week. Fehr said Friday that 
Winfield's "10-and-five" right would supersede contractual clauses approving a 
trade, but Chuck O'Connell, chief negotiator for the PRC, said Winfield's 
trade-acceptance clause is binding. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd expect him to say that," Klein said from his home in the suburban 
Westchester, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Klein denied that money was Winfield's motive for not reporting. Winfield's 
10-year, $20-million contract expires after this season, and he can become a 
free agent. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not something that's been discussed with the Angels," Klein said of a 
contract extension. "I called Mike Port (Friday) night as a courtesy to explain 
Dave's feelings about the Angels. It would be incorrect to say that Dave is 
driven by a desire for contract readjustment. It's certainly something that 
Dave and I will talk about, but Dave wants to do what's best for himself, and 
that rests on a number of factors." 
</P>
<P>
Port said that he would be willing to consider a new contract for Winfield "as 
a polite and courteous thing" should the matter arise. He would not estimate 
how long a deal Winfield might want, but said it would probably be for more 
than one year. 
</P>
<P>
"David feels he has something to prove," Port said, referring to Winfield's 
return from back surgery that sidelined him last season. "I've seen him say he 
is of the opinion he can play four or five more years. I've seen him and I know 
his capabilities." 
</P>
<P>
Winfield's failure to report did not take Port completely by surprise. However, 
Port is optimistic that Winfield will soon be wearing an Angel uniform. 
</P>
<P>
"We would not have proceeded if we didn't think we were on the '60' side of a 
60-40 proposition," Port said. "If this is decided (by an arbitrator), in a 
sense, it's decided between the Yankees and David. He says he's in limbo, but 
he's ours. He's on the 40-man roster, (although) he doesn't count against the 
active roster until he actually reports. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We're not confrontational with David in any sense. This is where he's wanted 
and appreciated, but I do not disrespect David for wanting to clear things up 
to his satisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
Port also said he doesn't regret making the trade because "you've got to take 
some risks." He appears sure to take another trade risk soon, given that 
Winfield's arrival would give the Angels six outfielders. That could change his 
reputation as a reluctant trader. "I don't know if that would enhance it or 
ruin it," he said.

PIRATES' HEATON IMPROVES RECORD TO 6-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The saga of Neal Heaton continues. 
</P>
<P>
The left-hander nobody wanted a year ago pitched seven strong innings Saturday 
night at Pittsburgh and, with a 3-1 victory over the Houston Astros, became the 
first Pirate pitcher in 61 years to win his first six starts in a season. 
</P>
<P>
Heaton, 30, has not lost a game since July 28. He's won his last 11 decisions 
after being on the verge of going to the minor leagues. Heaton gave up an 
unearned runs and four hits. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates have won seven of their last eight games. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Bonds doubled home a run in the two-run fourth inning. He has 20 runs 
batted in and is batting .500 with runners in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
The turnaround by Heaton is hard to believe. When he started last season by 
losing seven of his first eight decisions, the Pirates stuck him in the 
bullpen. He was 3-10 at Montreal in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Jim Leyland, his staff depleted by injury, used him in relief. He won 
twice and moved into the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
Even Heaton can't explain why he has become unbeatable. "It's amazing," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The only change is a pitch he developed this spring called a screw-knuckle 
change by catcher Mike LaValliere. It breaks like a screwball, but Heaton 
actually grips it with one knuckle. Pitching coach Ray Miller told him he had 
to come up with another pitch because the hitters would jump on a one-pitch 
pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time he threw his new pitch," Miller said, "the hitter almost fell 
on his face. That's when Neal said, 'I can have some fun with this.' He's also 
had success." 
</P>
<P>
Heaton readily admits the new pitch has made him a confident pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw a quote from Frank Viola the other day that every time he goes out on 
the mound, he thinks he's going to win. That's 75% of the game right there," 
Heaton said. "If you go out on the mound not sure, or wondering what's going to 
happen, you're going to get beat." 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates have won 13 of their last 16 games and lead the East by 4 1/2 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 4, Cincinnati 2 -- Tom Browning went into the seventh inning with a 
no-hitter. But he didn't even win the game. 
</P>
<P>
Shawon Dunston did more than spoil the no-hitter. His single to right ignited a 
four-run outburst that carried the Cubs to a victory. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Bielecki (2-3) had a three-hit shutout until he gave up singles to Mariano 
Duncan and Barry Larkin to open the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Mitch Williams, who gave up two hits and two runs in relief Friday night, 
replaced Bielecki. He got Todd Benzinger to hit into a double play, but Paul 
O'Neill spoiled the shutout with a two-out home run. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 6, Philadelphia 2 -- Matt Williams and Will Clark hit three-run 
home runs at Philadelphia and Scott Garrelts won his first game. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Giants have been in a slump, Williams has been a hot hitter. His 
three runs batted in gave him 18 in 14 games. Clark hit his fourth home run in 
the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 4, Atlanta 3 -- For the second game in a row, Lee Smith came through 
at St. Louis. He saved Friday's game, then came back to pitch two perfect 
innings for the victory in this one. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals won in the 10th. Vince Coleman bunted and pitcher Joe Boever 
bobbled it. Coleman stole second, his 16th steal, and went to third on an 
infield out. Boever walked Terry Pendleton and Dave Collins intentionally. 
</P>
<P>
But rookie Todd Zeile was walked unintentionally on a 3-and-2 pitch to end the 
game. Willie McGee and Pendleton both hit their first home runs of the season 
for the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
McGee hit his in the first inning over the 414-foot sign in center. It was the 
50th of his career. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 5, Montreal 2 -- Bruce Hurst (2-4) had his string of scoreless 
innings stopped at 12 at San Diego, but he pitched a six-hitter for his second 
complete game. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst gave up home runs to Andres Galarraga in the seventh and Delino DeShields 
in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Alomar had a run-scoring single in the first inning and doubled to 
ignite a three-run outburst in the sixth. Alomar was two for four and is 
batting .571 since being moved into the third spot in the batting order last 
Sunday. DAN HAFNER

LAKER OWNER, RILEY WILL DISCUSS CONTRACT EXTENSION AFTER SEASON

Perhaps responding to rumors that Pat Riley will leave coaching to become a 
broadcaster after this season, Laker owner Jerry Buss has begun negotiations on 
a contract extension for the Laker coach. 
</P>
<P>
Riley, who has two seasons remaining on the contract he signed midway through 
last season, confirmed that an extension was first discussed two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been discussed, but basically it's an agreement to meet and that's all," 
Riley said Saturday. "It came from Dr. Buss. He wanted to do it. I didn't 
initiate it." 
</P>
<P>
Riley said he will not meet with Buss again until after the playoffs, so as not 
to distract from the Lakers' play. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll wait to talk," Riley said, laughing. "I trust Dr. Buss' word on it. It's 
no big deal." 
</P>
<P>
Riley, along with Chuck Daly, coach of the Detroit Pistons, has been mentioned 
as a possible commentator for NBC's coverage of the NBA next season. But Riley 
has said that he will stay with the Lakers. SAM McMANIS

SPURS CATCH TRAIL BLAZERS SHORT, 115-105; 
</P>
<P>
WESTERN CONFERENCE: WITHOUT CENTERS, PORTLAND IS POUNDED INSIDE BY CUMMINGS AND 
ROBINSON AS SAN ANTONIO TIES THE SERIES, 2-2.

SAN ANTONIO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What happens to a team that loses its top two centers? 
</P>
<P>
We give you the Portland Trail Blazers, a doughnut of a team with a hole in the 
middle, who were served up to the San Antonio Spurs and quickly devoured, 
115-105. 
</P>
<P>
With starting center Kevin Duckworth out with a broken hand and backup Wayne 
Cooper out with back spasms, the Spurs tied the Western Conference semifinal 
playoff series at 2-2 with another victory Saturday at HemisFair Arena. 
</P>
<P>
As might be expected, there has been some emotional fallout. The Spurs, who 
dropped the first two games in Portland, are suddenly feeling frisky. They hit 
the Trail Blazers like a fast-moving train in a 37-18 second-quarter blitz and 
never looked back. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel great," Spur center David Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
And why not? Terry Cummings had 35 points and 11 rebounds, and Robinson had 21 
points, 10 rebounds and four blocked shots as the two Spurs' big men took 
advantage of Portland's shortcomings inside. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper might be ready for Game 5 Tuesday night in Portland, but he thought he 
might be OK for Game 4 and spent the morning in traction instead. 
</P>
<P>
Portland Coach Rick Adelman was asked if there was anything he could do about 
having his two centers hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to call Akeem (Olajuwon) today, but the line was busy," Adelman said. 
</P>
<P>
The imbalance in the middle was directly responsible for the Spurs' outburst in 
the second quarter. Trailing by eight points at the end of one quarter in which 
Clyde Drexler scored 16 points, San Antonio went on a 16-4 run in a four-minute 
stretch to turn a 38-33 deficit into a 49-42 lead. 
</P>
<P>
That was all the Spurs needed. By halftime, San Antonio led by 11 points and 
increased the lead to 21 in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Adelman was forced to play forwards Cliff Robinson and Mark Bryant in the 
pivot, but they were overmatched. Afterward, they were frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
Said Bryant: "It's hard to play defense against them." 
</P>
<P>
Said Cliff Robinson: "I'm doing the best I can." 
</P>
<P>
David Robinson and Cummings outrebounded Cliff Robinson and Bryant, 21-10. And 
with Portland caught short on the backboards, the Spurs were off and running. 
</P>
<P>
Three consecutive fast-break layups by Rod Strickland in 59 seconds made it 
49-42, and the Trail Blazers were never closer. 
</P>
<P>
The Spurs made 15 of 24 shots in the quarter, held Portland to its lowest 
quarter of the playoffs and even drew praise from Coach Larry Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, occasionally caustic in his assessment of his team's performance, was 
impressed by what he had seen in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"It was as good as we've ever played," Brown said. "At times, we were 
phenomenal." 
</P>
<P>
But . . . ? 
</P>
<P>
"An experienced, solid team may have beaten them by 30," Brown added after a 
short pause. 
</P>
<P>
Drexler finished with 27 points. Jerome Kersey had 23, but only four came in 
the first half and 11 were free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Adelman's substitution pattern has been thrown totally out of kilter. Drexler 
assessed the damage. 
</P>
<P>
"We're so limited," he said. "The bottom line is we've got two guys who don't 
play center playing center." 
</P>
<P>
It may not get any better for the Trail Blazers, who lost by 23 points in Game 
3 when Cooper played. Spur backup center Frank Brickowski said he thinks the 
Trail Blazers are in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure they're trying to ignore it, but they're struggling out there," 
Brickowski said. "They're going to have to get it back to be effective again." 
</P>
<P>
Drexler showed his own frustration. When Cummings gave him a shoulder in the 
lane and knocked him to the floor, Drexler lay there until Cummings came 
running past and then tried to trip him. 
</P>
<P>
Cummings and Drexler received double technical fouls after a short argument at 
midcourt. 
</P>
<P>
Drexler said he was merely trying to find a way for the Trail Blazers to come 
back. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes we come back, sometimes we don't," he said. "This time, we didn't. 
Now, it makes for an interesting series." 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Has an owner ever provided bulletin board material in a playoff series? Spur 
owner Red McCombs, who missed his annual cattle sale at his Johnson City ranch 
so he could watch his team play instead, seemed to get caught up in the spirit 
of things. "I don't think Portland is that tough, really," he told the San 
Antonio Light. "I don't think they have that good a club. If we've got more 
than two guys playing at the same time, we should be able to waltz by them."

Mexico's Raul Alcala displaced weeklong leader Vladislav Bobrik of the Soviet 
Union Saturday, taking a 43-second lead heading into the final stage of the 
Tour de Trump bicycle race. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what to do now," Alcala said. 
</P>
<P>
"I will see what happens tomorrow, but I don't believe there will be danger." 
</P>
<P>
The 13-stage, 1,107-mile race ends today with the flat 108.5-mile 
Northampton-to-Boston Road Race. 
</P>
<P>
Alcala took the lead over the toughest stretch of the race, a 123.7-mile climb 
from Catskill to Albany. James Urbanos of Boulder, Colo., used a finishing 
seven-mile solo ride to win the stage by 30 seconds over Steve Speaks of 
Longmont, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Urbanos broke away as a pack of about 20 riders crested the first of three 
grueling hills. Urbanos' time was 4 hours 55 minutes 45 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest stage win I've ever had," Urbanos said. "It hasn't really 
sunk in yet, but in a few hours I'm sure I'll freak out." 
</P>
<P>
Alcala was among several riders credited with the same time as Speaks. 
</P>
<P>
Alcala, 24, overtook Bobrik shortly after a lead pack of 19 cyclists completed 
a 1,500-foot, three-mile climb to Devil's Kitchen, about 23 miles into the 
stage. Several thousand spectators, the largest turnout of the race, lined the 
sides of the narrow road up the climb. 
</P>
<P>
Alcala, eighth last year in the Tour de France, remained with the lead group 
while the main trailing group, including Bobrik, fell as many as seven miles 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
Alcala, who won the prologue when the race began May 3 in Wilmington, Del., and 
also won the eighth stage, leads Norway's Atle Kvalsvoll by 43 seconds. Erik 
Breukink of the Netherlands is third, 1:44 behind.

NEWSWIRE: WOODY STEPHENS STILL ON THE CRITICAL LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hall of Fame trainer Woody Stephens remained in critical but stable condition 
Saturday at a Louisville, Ky., hospital, one day after undergoing open-heart 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Stephens, 76, who was connected to a respirator, was alert and resting 
comfortably, said Pam Greer-Ullrich, a spokeswoman for Norton Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctor thinks he's doing as well as can be expected for someone who has 
undergone a quadruple bypass," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Stephens underwent the surgery for complications that arose while he was 
hospitalized for emphysema, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Stephens is the only trainer to win five consecutive Belmont Stakes. He won the 
Kentucky Derby twice -- in 1974 with Cannonade and in 1984 with Swale.

John Harkes scored on a pass from teammate Bruce Murray in the 84th minute 
Saturday night to give the United States a 1-1 tie with Ajax of Amsterdam in an 
exhibition soccer game. 
</P>
<P>
Harkes' shot from 12 yards out eluded the reach of Ajax goalkeeper Sjaak Storm. 
</P>
<P>
Ajax, the 1990 Dutch Division One champion, took a 1-0 lead 15 minutes into the 
match when Ronald de Boer picked up a loose ball in the U.S. penalty area and 
rifled a shot past American goalkeeper Kasey Keller. 
</P>
<P>
The play was set up when Keller mishandled a playback pass by teammate Paul 
Caligiuri, and the ball came loose to de Boer. 
</P>
<P>
Despite trailing much of the way, the United States (6-6-1 in exhibitions) 
dominated the first five minutes of the match, as well as the final 20 minutes 
of the contest. 
</P>
<P>
With 13 minutes to play, Chris Sullivan just missed wide, and Steve Trittschuh 
just missed on a tip seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
In the 80th minute, the United States had another opportunity when Peter Vermes 
was pushed down 15 yards from the net by Mark Verkuijl of Ajax. But Tab Ramos' 
shot on the restart was knocked down by the Ajax wall. 
</P>
<P>
The United States got the tying goal four minutes later when Bruce Murray 
headed a pass to Harkes 25 yards from the Ajax goal. 
</P>
<P>
Harkes dribbled to the left of the penalty area and chipped a shot past Storm 
for his third goal of the exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
The United States closes its exhibition season May 20 at New Haven, Conn., 
against Partisan Belgrade, a Yugoslav club team. The Americans begin 
first-round play in the World Cup tournament on June 10 at Florence, Italy, 
against Czechoslovakia.

COUPLES' 75 LETS NORMAN AND STEWART THROUGH 
</P>

From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Greg Norman came back from a long rain delay to finish a three-under-par 69 and 
took a one-stroke lead when Fred Couples botched the final hole in Saturday's 
third round of the Memorial tournament at Dublin, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Couples, who led through the first two rounds of this weather-troubled 
tournament, held a share of the top spot when he went to the 18th tee in the 
gathering twilight. 
</P>
<P>
As the last player on the course, Couples hooked his drive into a little creek, 
had to take a drop and went on to a double-bogey six. 
</P>
<P>
It finished a three-over-par 75 that dropped him two strokes off the pace with 
one round to go. 
</P>
<P>
Norman completed three rounds at even-par 216 and was long gone from Jack 
Nicklaus' Muirfield Village Golf Club course when Couples finished in a cold 
rain. 
</P>
<P>
Norman didn't know he would end up as the 54-hole leader when he said he 
"wasn't real happy with the way I played. I didn't really play that well on the 
back," although that's where he made up eight shots on Couples. 
</P>
<P>
With Couples' last-hole collapse, Payne Stewart took over second place at 217 
after shooting a 69 in a tournament that was raked by gale-force winds 
Thursday, then subjected to cold, steady rain that caused a 2-hour, 10-minute 
delay Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, who has won two of his last three starts, hopes he will have another 
chance to make up some ground. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to get up there around the lead, get the lead, because there's a 
definite possibility the golf tournament can be rained out, canceled tomorrow," 
he said. "All I can do is hope we can play tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
The forecast was for continued rain through this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Couples, who lost four shots to par over the last five holes and played the 
back nine in 41, dropped into a tie for third at 218 with Don Pooley, Brad 
Faxon and Mark Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
Pooley, the 1987 winner of this event, had a 74. Brooks and Faxon each matched 
par 72. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Jacobsen (71) and Bill Sander (72) were at 219. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Dill sank a 40-foot eagle putt on the 18th hole to take a two-stroke lead 
over Mike Hill after the second round of the Southwestern Bell tournament at 
Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
Dill's three-under 69 left him at 139 and put him in position to win his first 
PGA Senior Tour championship today -- his 51st birthday. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't hit the ball nearly as well today as I did yesterday, but I hit a lot 
of good shots," said Dill, a former law professor who has won $122,000 since 
joining the Senior Tour last year. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, the second-leading money winner this year, had six birdies and three 
bogeys in a round of 69. He is virtually assured of finishing in the top 10 for 
the eighth time in 10 starts this year. 
</P>
<P>
Dottie Mochrie shot a career-low 65 to take a seven-shot lead after the second 
round of the LPGA Crestar tournament at Chesapeake, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Her seven-under-par round gave her a total of 132 and the largest second-round 
lead of the year on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
Rosie Jones was second at 139 after shooting a 70, with Chris Johnson (67) 
another stroke back. 
</P>
<P>
Patty Sheehan shot a 71 and was tied with Deb Richard and Vicki Fergon at 141. 
Richard shot 69 Saturday. Fergon had a 71.

<P>
OWNERSHIP: WHAT WILL BE DONE WITH YOUR HOME AFTER YOU DIE AND WHAT TAXES YOUR

<P>
One of the most important issues that you must address, whether you're a 
longtime homeowner or are planning to buy a house soon, is how you hold title 
to your property. 
</P>
<P>
It's an issue that most people barely even think about. But how you hold title 
to your home has far-reaching income-tax and legal ramifications that you can't 
afford to overlook. 
</P>
<P>
"How you hold title can affect what will be done with the property after you 
die, how much taxes will be owed when your survivor eventually sells and a 
bunch of other issues," said Steven A. Sokol, one of the California Assn. of 
Realtors' lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
"Yet, people don't really consider how they hold title. It's really an 
important estate-planning issue, but most people don't give it much thought." 
</P>
<P>
Most property owners hold title in one of three ways: sole ownership, 
tenants-in-common or joint tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Sole ownership is the easiest to understand: It's the most common way for 
people to hold title when no other owner is involved. When the sole owner dies, 
his interest in the property will be passed on to whomever he names in his 
will. 
</P>
<P>
Two or more single people who team up to buy a house usually take title as 
tenants-in-common. 
</P>
<P>
Each tenant-in-common has what lawyers call an "undivided interest" in the home 
-- meaning that they each own part of the property, but that their interest 
can't be broken down into a "you-own-this-bedroom-and-I-own-that-one" situation 
without a separate written agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Tenants-in-common don't have to own equal interests in the home. One could own, 
say, three-quarters of the property and the other could own the rest. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most important things about a tenancy-in-common is that any of the 
co-owners can sell their interest in the property to somebody else without the 
consent of the other owners," said Patricia Phillips, a partner in the Los 
Angeles-based law firm of Hufstedler, Miller, Kaus &amp; Beardsley. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, when one of the tenants-in-common dies, his interest in the property is 
passed on according to his will -- it doesn't automatically pass to all the 
other co-owners." 
</P>
<P>
That's not the case when people take title as joint tenants -- the most common 
form of ownership among married people. 
</P>
<P>
Under a joint tenancy arrangement, each party must have an equal interest in 
the property. A husband and wife who take title to their home as joint tenants 
each owns 50% of the house. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important aspect of a joint tenancy is that there's an automatic 
right of survivorship," said CAR attorney Sokol. 
</P>
<P>
"If the husband dies and he and his wife held title as joint tenants, his 
interest in the home automatically passes to his wife." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, if you and your partner take title to a home as joint tenants, 
you won't be able to will your interest to anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
Even if your will states that you want your half of the home to go to a 
long-lost nephew, the right of survivorship will usually supersede your bequest 
and automatically award your interest in the property to your surviving joint 
tenant. 
</P>
<P>
You don't have to be married to hold property through joint tenancy, and more 
than two people could be on the title. 
</P>
<P>
For example, you could set up a joint-tenancy arrangement if you're investing 
with your two closest friends and would like to have your interest in the 
property automatically passed to them when you die. 
</P>
<P>
However, each of you would have to own an equal interest in the property. Since 
there are three people involved, each would have an undivided one-third 
interest in the home. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't know how you hold title to your home, or if your marital situation 
has changed since you bought the property, fish out a copy of the grant deed or 
title insurance policy you received when you bought your house. 
</P>
<P>
If you can't find these documents, the company that provided your 
title-insurance policy or escrow services can give you duplicates. 
</P>
<P>
After looking at how you hold title, you might decide that some changes are in 
order. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if you bought a home with someone else while you were single, you 
probably hold title as tenants-in-common. But if you've since married that 
person, you might want to change it so you'll hold it as joint tenants. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if you plan to get married soon but would like to see 
someone other than your spouse inherit your interest in the property after you 
die, you might reject joint tenancy in favor of a tenants-in-common 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
For example, say you're engaged and that both you and your fiancee have 
children from a previous marriage. Since both of you are financially secure, 
you would like to leave your interest in the home to your children instead of 
your spouse. 
</P>
<P>
If you took title as joint tenants and then died, your interest in the property 
would automatically pass to your spouse even if your will stated that you 
wanted your offspring to have it. But if you took title as tenants-in-common, 
you could freely will your interest to your kids. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, if you're married or plan to wed soon, it might even be better to hold 
title as community property instead of joint tenancy. 
</P>
<P>
This type of arrangement is only allowed in California and the six other 
community-property states -- Texas, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Idaho and 
Washington. It's also permitted in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
Only married people can hold title as community property. It's much like a 
joint-tenancy arrangement, with an important exception: If you die and your 
spouse later sells the home, the fact that the house is community property will 
provide your survivor with important tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
There's no automatic right of survivorship in a community property arrangement: 
Both the husband and wife can will their interest in the home to someone else. 
</P>
<P>
"Each owner usually wills their interest in the home to each other or their 
kids. If they die without a will, the survivor normally receives the deceased's 
interest in the home," Sokol said. 
</P>
<P>
Like a joint-tenancy set-up, Sokol said, a community-property arrangement also 
avoids costly and time-consuming probate proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
"However, you run the risk that your spouse might have made out another will 
that gives the property to somebody else upon your spouse's death. That means 
you wouldn't inherit your late spouse's interest in the home, even though you 
thought you would." 
</P>
<P>
It's usually easy to change the way you hold title to your home or other real 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
For example, say you and your partner hold title as tenants-in-common, but you 
want to become joint tenants. This can be accomplished with the help of a 
quitclaim deed, which you can purchase at most business supplies or stationery 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
You would fill out the quitclaim to show that you and your partner, as 
tenants-in-common, are quitclaiming the property to yourselves, as joint 
tenants. Have it notarized, record it at the county recorder's office, and 
you're all set. 
</P>
<P>
Since the way you hold title to property involves such important legal and tax 
issues, it's a good idea to talk to a real estate attorney or estate planner to 
find out which method will best serve the long-term interests of both yourself 
and your family. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, there's a good chance that the expert you consult won't suggest taking 
title as joint tenants or tenants-in-common at all: They might suggest that you 
hold title to the home as a "living trust." 
</P>
<P>
We'll talk about these trusts -- which attorney Sokol says "is the best way for 
just about anybody to hold title to real estate" -- next week.

APARTMENT LIFE: LANDLORDS MULL EFFECT OF PROPOSED WATER CURBS; 
</P>
<P>
RATIONING: APARTMENT OWNERS WONDER HOW THEY CAN GET TENANTS' COOPERATION IF 
BRADLEY'S 10% CUTS ARE ENACTED, SINCE MOST BUILDINGS ARE MASTER-METERED. 
</P>

magazine, a publication of the AAGLA, an apartment owners' service group.

<TEXT>
<P>
Since Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley announced his mandatory water rationing 
proposal for the city, questions have come pouring in to the Apartment Assn. of 
Greater Los Angeles on what it would mean, if enacted, to both tenants and 
landlords. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, this week's Apartment Life column is devoted to a review of where we have 
been and where we may be going in terms of saving water in apartments. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of apartment buildings in Los Angeles are master-metered, 
meaning that the landlords pay their tenants' water bills, according to 
Department of Water and Power spokeswoman Stacy Unger. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of master-metered buildings have asked how they can get their tenants to 
cut back on water use when they will not be monitored or penalized for using 
too much. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Sheets, a Redondo Beach landlord who is considering implementing some of 
the mayor's proposals even though she would not be required to do so, said: 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor's proposal is a good idea. But for me, it won't be so easy to comply 
with. I am already very water-conscious and economical with my usage. Cutting 
back more would be tricky. 
</P>
<P>
"Tenants, on the other hand, don't pay the bill. So unless they are naturally 
conservationists, they have no incentive to cut back." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's mandatory water rationing plan underscores what most of us already 
know. We live in a desert and, from time to time, must take measures, sometimes 
drastic measures, to conserve our water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the time for such measures is now remains the subject of debate. 
</P>
<P>
"This (the mandatory rationing measure) is a judgment call on the mayor's 
part," said Richard Harasick, director of water conservation at the Department 
of Water and Power. 
</P>
<P>
"DWP doesn't feel that the numbers support the need for mandatory conservation. 
We have enough water for this year. When future supplies don't meet current 
demands, then a plan such as the mayor's become necessary." 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier interview with The Times, City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, 
chairwoman of the council's Commerce, Energy and Natural Resources Committee, 
which oversees water issues and will review the mayor's proposal, said, "I need 
to find out what information the mayor has that led to this decision." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John Ferraro's press deputy, Bill Gilson, said, "While Councilman 
Ferraro agrees that conservation is necessary, he's not sure that rationing and 
penalties are appropriate right now." 
</P>
<P>
The city's 1988 water conservation law already requires several measures from 
apartment owners and tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Landlords were required to have installed low-flow shower heads in their 
rentals as of Oct. 13, 1988, that limit water flow to 3 gallons per minute, and 
toilet water displacement devices, that displace at least one-half gallon of 
water. 
</P>
<P>
The law also prohibited hosing down patios and driveways to clean them, which 
had been the standard method by which apartment owners kept their properties 
clean. 
</P>
<P>
The law further required residents to fix leaking faucets and toilets, and 
asked them to voluntarily reduce their water consumption by 10%. 
</P>
<P>
While the law provides for penalties and fines for landlords who do not install 
the shower and toilet devices, it does not address the problem of tenants 
removing them, an issue that concerns landlords. 
</P>
<P>
Also, apartment owners are concerned because Bradley's proposal would penalize 
landlords whose buildings do not save the mandatory 10% but does not hold 
tenants accountable for their water use. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP does not keep statistics on water usage in apartments. But use in 
single-family homes was 169,016 gallons per household per year in 1986, the 
base year in Bradley's proposal, or almost 463 gallons a day. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, after the 1988 voluntary water conservation efforts, annual usage was 
down by only 408 gallons, a little over 1 gallon a day per household, to 
168,608 gallons, or about 462 gallons per day. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's proposal would reduce water consumption by 10% of the 1986 level, 
from the 461 gallons per household used each day last year down to 417 gallons 
a day, a savings of 44 gallons a day. 
</P>
<P>
How much water is 44 gallons? 
</P>
<P>
According to the Metropolitan Water District (MWD), the average 10-minute 
shower uses up 40 gallons of water. Most of us use 3 gallons each day we brush 
our teeth. Those who bathe save 20 gallons of water over their counterparts who 
shower. 
</P>
<P>
And while we are saving 150 gallons of water by not hosing down our patios, we 
are still using that much water every time we wash our cars. 
</P>
<P>
And while MWD officials say that the average household uses 300 to 500 gallons 
of water a day, most consumers are unaware that they use even a fraction of 
that amount. According to MWD, few believe that they use more than 50 to 75 
gallons a day. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great idea to save water, especially from the landlord's point of view, 
because we foot the bill," said Los Angeles landlord Ray Abadi. "But tenants 
may not feel this way. They are paying the rent, and many feel they should be 
able to use all the water they want." 
</P>
<P>
Palms tenant Dan Kendall doesn't see it that way, however. "Water is a limited 
resource in our region. And, while it is true I don't, as a tenant, pay for its 
usage, I recognize how important it is to conserve it." 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood apartment manager Brandon Keene: 
</P>
<P>
"As (a manager), I can see both sides. This past year we tried to tighten up as 
best we could through maintenance. Any further cuts would be a burden on most 
people. You can't tell a tenant that he can't take a shower. What can we do? We 
would be interested to hear from the city how we could accomplish any such 
mandatory cutback."

SPEAKING OUT: SPECIAL AGENCIES SERVE A PURPOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG A. EWING, Ewing is director of community development for the city of 
La Canada Flintridge. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rise of special purpose agencies such as the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District is often cited by those who believe that Southern 
California has failed to comprehensively plan for its future. 
</P>
<P>
As expressed in a recent "Speaking Out" column, ("Sound Growth Policies 
Casualty of Special Interests" by attorney Phillip R. Nicholson, March 11), 
such agencies fail to adequately balance the conflicting interests and needs of 
the greater community and result in waste and delay for property owners. 
</P>
<P>
I believe this view fails to acknowledge the fundamental importance of special 
purpose agencies in our government, and ignores the difficulty of solving 
complex urban problems with a single decision. 
</P>
<P>
A case from the planning files of my city, La Canada Flintridge, will serve as 
a useful example, offering important lessons for addressing the larger planning 
problems facing Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
An oil company approached the city about installing cleanup equipment on a site 
formerly used as a gas station. The equipment would extract gasoline from the 
ground after 40 years of leakage from underground storage tanks. 
</P>
<P>
A conditional-use permit was determined to be necessary, including a public 
hearing, in which the city informed the neighboring homeowners about the 
project and provided them the opportunity to question and comment on the 
installation. 
</P>
<P>
The project was ultimately approved by the Planning Commission with conditions 
for noise abatement and visual screening of the machinery. However, these 
conditions were supplemented by several others: 
</P>
<P>
The applicant was required to receive permits from the county Department of 
Public Works, county Fire Department, South Coast Air Quality Management 
District and, if necessary, the Regional Water Quality Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
Each agency would be waiting with its own tangle of approvals and procedures, 
and the oil company would deal with forms, clerks and inspectors from three or 
four separate entities. The company acknowledged the use-permit conditions and 
ventured forth. 
</P>
<P>
This summary can only suggest how complex, and occasionally nightmarish, the 
experience must be for the applicant. Given the choice, however, I expect that 
the oil company and the public would have it no other way. 
</P>
<P>
Let us assume that we could consolidate the process, making the city the sole 
agency reviewing the cleanup. The oil company would need only one decision and 
receive only one permit. 
</P>
<P>
But before any approval could be given, the city would have to know a few 
things about the project: 
</P>
<P>
Staff would have to learn about soil contamination, including soil analysis and 
the properties of gasoline, benzene, toluene and other toxic chemicals. They 
would also need the ability to analyze local ground water and the potential for 
water pollution. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed extraction technology would require a knowledge of vacuum pumps, 
the rate of air flow and the effectiveness of absorbing toxic substance. The 
extracted vapors will be burned, rather than released in the air, requiring an 
understanding of gas burners. 
</P>
<P>
With a staff of three planners and a secretary, the city would be hard-pressed 
to review much else for four or five years while it became expert on this 
project. 
</P>
<P>
The city might try to use consultants. Unfortunately, it could not identify 
reliable geologists or engineers, because it could not accept their state 
licenses (remember only the city is responsible). Staff would still need to 
develop in-house expertise to evaluate the consultants. 
</P>
<P>
From the perspective of the oil company, the picture goes from bad to worse. 
Each city and county would be solely responsible for evaluating, inspecting and 
permitting the entire clean-up operation for its own contaminated sites. 
</P>
<P>
Each jurisdiction would have to develop its own review capacity. Each city and 
county could adopt unique standards for soil "cleanliness" and set its own 
terms for required technology and operation. 
</P>
<P>
While the jurisdictions are getting their acts together, the oil company is on 
the hook for the cost of its sites lying idle. And, of course, each government 
will want to recover the cost of setting up its processes, so the oil company 
will be paying for a complete inspection program -- from physics classes to 
forms -- in each of up to 458 California cities and 58 counties. 
</P>
<P>
Now, generalize the problem to the public at large. If all single purpose 
agencies are placed within the control of general government, we could achieve 
a consolidated and comprehensive approach to public policy. Sounds good? 
</P>
<P>
First, we eliminate school, library and cemetery districts; they are among the 
oldest forms of special purpose districts in the state. Our city councils will 
set the priorities for educating our children, as they attempt to provide 
police, fire, and street maintenance services. 
</P>
<P>
Next, we take in special agencies operating beyond the local level. For 
example, the Uniform Building Code is prepared by the International Conference 
of Building Officials -- a private multistate agency that prepares model codes 
used throughout California. By eliminating them, each city could adopt its own 
building code. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, we can eliminate the semi-autonomous California Highway Commission, 
allowing each city to decide the location of its own freeways. Freeway plans 
would probably be more sensitive to local neighborhoods than has always been 
the case, but we might find that there is more than one South Pasadena that 
doesn't want to play "regional transportation." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, one agency attempting to manage all public issues comprehensively 
would lead to gross inefficiencies, and to the failure to effectively address 
many of them. It should not surprise us that such consolidation is also 
contrary to our political heritage and our Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Political scientists agree that America's greatest contribution to government 
is the federal system. The Founding Fathers gave us the power to create new 
governments at different levels, and in various forms, so that public issues 
could be dealt with effectively. 
</P>
<P>
A rereading of "The Federalist" papers provides a glimpse of the genius of the 
framers of the Constitution. Their wisdom came from admitting that, in forming 
a government, one could not anticipate all the public issues that might arise. 
They also recognized that different issues required different economies of 
scale for devising a solution. 
</P>
<P>
The advice has not been lost on us. In 1980, there were over 60,000 
governmental agencies in the United States -- one national government, 50 
states, 3,139 counties, 19,097 cities and more than 37,000 special purpose 
agencies. The numbers have increased since then. 
</P>
<P>
It appears special purpose agencies are part of our system -- in many ways, 
they are our system. We made these agencies for ourselves, and we will want to 
create others if those we have aren't satisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, problems abound. Some agencies have served their usefulness, while 
others are created without a clear purpose. Both are unneeded drains on the 
public purse. We must be willing to review, update and purge. 
</P>
<P>
Also, some agencies exist without our consent. Should the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District Board be directly elected? Their new-found power to 
alter our lifestyles makes this question worth debating. 
</P>
<P>
In sum, single-purpose agencies are not a barrier to solving our growth 
problems. In fact, we will expect them to be a large part of the solution. Our 
search for answers to the planning issues crowding around us requires that we 
look in new directions. 
</P>
<P>
We need to evaluate our expectations about local comprehensive planning. We 
need to recognize that new problems may not be adequately addressed by existing 
levels of government. We may also need to accept that the state of California 
must take a direct hand in land-use matters. And we must remember to review 
every agency's performance. 
</P>
<P>
Before we take aim at special purpose agencies, we should remember how we 
expect our government to work. Until then, we might contemplate the 
alternative: Is anyone willing to wait while a planner learns physics?

<P>
Our Crib 'n Bed is the practical idea for any family who doesn't want to 
purchase more furniture when it's time to move from the crib to a bed. 
</P>
<P>
Build the crib for use while the child is an infant. When the child is ready 
for a bed, remove the railings on both sides, unbolt the small block of drawers 
from the end of the crib -- which become a nightstand -- and you will have a 
youth bed with two drawers for storage. 
</P>
<P>
Since a youth bed is smaller than a twin-size mattress, it is recommended you 
use a thick piece of durable foam cut to the proper dimensions as a mattress. 
</P>
<P>
Our companion piece is a dresser/changing table measuring about 41 inches tall 
and 31 inches wide. The shelf on top folds down for use as a changing table and 
will hold a cradle or a basinet-size pad. 
</P>
<P>
When it's no longer useful as a changing table, the shelf will fold up to 
display knickknacks. 
</P>
<P>
Both plans include step-by-step instructions, photos, diagrams and materials 
lists, and they conform to safety suggestions in consumer reports. To obtain 
Crib 'n Bed, Plan No. 775, send $4.95. Changing Table Dresser, Plan No. 776, is 
$4.50.

TOO MUCH AIR PUMPED WHEN OPERATING WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Popular Mechanics 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I use a shallow-well jet pump for watering my garden. The problem is 
that it pumps too much air. The point is located 20 feet below the surface and 
there's always about 8 feet of water standing in the pipe. 
</P>
<P>
I attached a 30-gallon tank to the pump to hold reserve water for priming the 
pump. Every week I must release 10 pounds of air from the tank. Why am I 
getting all the air? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Since you mention that there's a point at the end of the well piping, I 
assume you have a driven well and not a drilled or dug well. The pipe that's 
driven is the pipe through which the water flows. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with removing the pump and measuring the water level is that it's 
being measured under static conditions. When the water is being drawn up the 
pipe, the level will drop. 
</P>
<P>
You can check the level of water in the pipe when it's being pumped by 
connecting a vacuum gauge to the suction line after the check valve. The gauge 
is calibrated in inches of mercury. One inch of vacuum will pull up water 1.13 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
If the gauge reads 20 inches, the pump is lifting water 22.6 feet. This 
includes the effort needed to overcome the friction of the water against the 
inside wall of the pipe. 
</P>
<P>
If all the joints are tight, then your problem appears to be caused by a low 
level of water when the pump is running. As the water is pumped, the level 
descends to the strainer at the end of the point and sucks air from around the 
pipe. Although there's no guarantee that it will work, you might try driving 
the point down another 5 to 10 feet. 
</P>
<P>
You should not have to prime the sump each time it's used. If priming is 
necessary, then there's either a leak in the suction line, a faulty check 
valve, or possibly both. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Removing Linoleum to Uncover Floor 
</P>
<P>
Q: We would like to refinish the hardwood floor that's under the linoleum in 
our kitchen. Is there an easy way to remove the linoleum? 
</P>
<P>
A: Unfortunately, there is no easy way. If the hardwood floor consists of oak 
strips and was originally smooth, then the linoleum was probably glued directly 
to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Begin by cutting the linoleum into 12-inch strips with a utility knife. Be 
careful to set the blade depth so you don't cut into the wood. Use a long-edged 
trowel to pry up the linoleum strips. A heat gun will help soften the adhesive 
as you go. Eventually, you'll remove all the linoleum and some of the adhesive. 
Portions of the linoleum's felt backing, however, will stick to the adhesive 
that remains. 
</P>
<P>
If your hardwood floor had open joints or crevices, it was probably leveled 
with a quick-setting, plaster-like compound before the linoleum was applied. In 
this case, prior to lifting the strips, pound on the linoleum with a flat 
object to crumble the leveling compound and facilitate lifting. 
</P>
<P>
After removing the linoleum, you'll have to sand the floor. Be aware that up 
until about five years ago, the felt backing of linoleum contained asbestos. 
Have a sample analyzed.

ASK THE INSPECTOR: PROPER LINKS NEEDED FOR COPPER, STEEL PIPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL ROSS, Ross is the public relations chairman for the California Real 
Estate Inspection Assn. (CREIA), a statewide trade association of home 
inspectors. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Three years ago, I had our house repiped in copper. The house was 
recently inspected as part of the sale, and the home inspector said the new 
copper was not properly separated from the original galvanized. Why do I still 
have any galvanized piping, and why does a connection between the copper and 
galvanized matter? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: You have two questions here. First, what is professionally known as a 
repipe can vary, but would typically involve replacement of the supply line 
from the meter to the home and the replacement thereafter of the horizontal 
lines beneath the homes or within the home. 
</P>
<P>
b Galvanized pipes occlude or become clogged with bits of corroded matter and 
suspended solids in the water. The vertical, or riser, pipes occlude at a 
dramatically slower rate and are left to lessen the cost of cosmetic repairs. 
The need for separation arises from the fact that copper and galvanized steel 
are dissimilar metals and should not be directly connected. 
</P>
<P>
If a direct connection is made, electrolysis will occur. This is an immense 
failure of the joint. You will note I wrote will, not may because it is 
inevitable and will occur at every cross connection (the hot-water lines will 
degrade much faster than the cold lines). 
</P>
<P>
A leak of this type is a "whole system" problem and will require shutting off 
the system until repairs can be made. Proper separation is simple and 
inexpensive: dielectric fittings or a nipple or brass pipe are placed between 
the two materials and the problem is avoided. About 45% to 60% of the repiped 
seams we see have direct connections, a depressing number indeed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aluminum Rewiring Requires a Professional 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have been told that I have aluminum branch wiring in my home. Should my 
entire house be rewired? 
</P>
<P>
A: Typically, no. An electrician qualified in the repair of aluminum wiring 
should be contacted to evaluate your electrical system. These repairs should be 
performed only by a qualified, licensed electrician who is familiar with 
aluminum wiring and the safety requirements for upgrading the system, as the 
connections between aluminum and copper are made with special connectors, not 
the typical "wire nut." 
</P>
<P>
There are special procedures to follow when upgrading aluminum wiring systems 
and only a licensed qualified electrician should be contacted to do such work. 
You can send for the booklet repairing aluminum wiring, CPCS No. 516, to U.S. 
Consumer Product, Safety Commission, Washington, D.C. 20207. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Owner Is Responsible for Defect Disclosures 
</P>
<P>
Q: My realtor listed my home and did a walk-through with me for any visible 
defect we could find so we could disclose them on the state's required 
disclosure form that all sellers must fill out and sign. He mentioned several 
items in our garage that he requested we disclose on the form and or have 
repairs made. 
</P>
<P>
My question is: We bought the home two years ago and did not have a home 
inspection, and these items were there as they are today. So why should I 
disclose them as defects or repair them? The items he mentioned were holes in 
our garage fire-wall and that the doggie door cut into the fire door going into 
the garage was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
A: Your realtor is correct. Once you bought the home, you became responsible 
for any conditions whether they were there before or after you purchased the 
home. You must disclose all "known defects," and you could, in some cases, be 
required to repair them before the close of escrow. 
</P>
<P>
Building codes require that any walls in a garage that you live behind or above 
be built with a minimum of 5/8-inch fire-resistant dry wall and be completely 
sealed. Doors going into the home must be solid-core fire-rated door with an 
automatic closing device so they will automatically close and latch. No holes 
can be cut in the wall or door. This is to delay fire and smoke from entering 
the home as long as possible, giving you the fire safety that these doors and 
walls were designed for. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Check Qualifications When Hiring Inspector 
</P>
<P>
Q: What do we look for when hiring an inspector? 
</P>
<P>
A: Be sure he or she is a member of California Real Estate Inspection Assn. 
(CREIA), a region of the American Society of Home Inspectors, a trade 
organization, which is the only statewide organization to offer continuous 
training, education and support services to the inspection industry. 
</P>
<P>
Then ask for his or her experience and qualifications. How many years has he or 
she been a home inspector? Is he or she a licensed contractor? (This is not 
required for home inspections. It is a credential only.) Be sure to qualify the 
inspector who will be doing the inspection, not the company or owner.

JAMES FLANIGAN: THE POWER OF THE CHANGING WORK FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By James Flanigan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just in time for Mother's Day the House of Representatives last week passed a 
Family and Medical Leave bill that would allow employees to take 12 weeks 
unpaid time off to care for a newborn or adopted child, or a parent or spouse, 
without endangering their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
But the White House said President Bush would veto the bill if it gets through 
the Senate and comes before him. 
</P>
<P>
What's going on? A big trend for the '90s -- the importance of work and family 
issues -- that is being obscured by politics. 
</P>
<P>
The House bill is opposed by small-business groups, which don't like Congress 
mandating benefits that big companies can afford more easily than small firms. 
But the bill is supported by big firms -- the so-called Fortune 1,000 -- 
because they would rather cope with a uniform federal law that would apply to 
all competitors equally in every state. 
</P>
<P>
So the House bill would exempt 95% of the nation's 8 million businesses, but 
still would apply to more than half the work force by covering companies with 
50 or more employees and all federal, state and local governments. 
</P>
<P>
But even if Bush vetoes the bill, companies large and small are going to have 
to offer family leave and other new and varied benefits if they want to keep 
employees in the '90s. Because the forces driving the legislation are those 
that will preoccupy business throughout the decade: change, diversity and 
looming labor shortages in the U.S. work force. 
</P>
<P>
Women will comprise 12 million of the 19 million new entrants to the U.S. labor 
force in this decade, rising from 45% of the total at present to 47%. 
</P>
<P>
And the proportion of black, Hispanic and Asian workers will rise to 26% of the 
work force, from 21%. 
</P>
<P>
But the most important change will be scarcity of new workers as the labor 
force grows much more slowly in the '90s than in the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with change and shortages, many companies are already offering help with 
family issues. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph allows up to six months 
unpaid leave. IBM offers a personal leave of up to three years, during which 
health benefits remain in force, employees can work part time and are 
guaranteed a full-time job upon return. 
</P>
<P>
Marriott, the chain that employs 230,000 people in hotels and food service 
outlets, asked employees two years ago what they wanted. In response, it now 
offers a pretax savings plan to finance parental leave -- unpaid leave being no 
luxury to many people -- as well as discounts on child care and seminars on 
parenting. Like most large companies, Marriott offers extended unpaid time off 
-- with continued health benefits -- beyond the required maternity leave. 
</P>
<P>
US Sprint, the telephone network with 16,000 staffers, allows employees to 
share jobs -- splitting duties and days at work -- or to work flexible hours 
for many reasons, not necessarily child rearing. 
</P>
<P>
Such benefits are called women's issues, but "family" is a more accurate term 
because the common concern is modern family life -- two-earner couples or 
single parents raising children and caring for aging relatives. Recognition of 
such needs is new, even if the problems aren't. And work and family issues are 
often subject to rhetoric and misunderstanding. There's a fond belief, repeated 
even by experts, that in past centuries women stayed home and men worked. 
</P>
<P>
But that's not true. In past centuries, both men and women worked on farms -- 
and worked until they dropped. It is only for a historically brief period in 
this century that the idea of keeping women in the home took hold -- and it's 
doubtful that anybody asked the woman for her opinion. Women at the higher end 
of the social scale worked: Frances Perkins in 1933 was the first Secretary of 
Labor. And at the lower end, domestic servants were a constant 5% to 6% of the 
U.S. work force until World War II. (Domestics are 1% of today's work force.) 
</P>
<P>
In any event, that war brought women back into the general work force and they 
never really left, even though television in the 1950s portrayed the American 
woman as a homebound spouse -- June Cleaver of "Leave It to Beaver," Alice 
Kramden of "The Honeymooners" and Lucy Ricardo of "I Love Lucy." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, today's TV mothers go out to work -- Claire Huxtable on "The Cosby 
Show" and Roseanne Conner on "Roseanne." 
</P>
<P>
Yet despite their years in the work force, women still get short pay. Median 
weekly earnings for retail sales workers, for example, are $304 for men, $208 
for women. Among editors and reporters, men make $589 a week and women $442. 
Women do better in light manufacturing -- earning $254 a week to $287 for men. 
And among lawyers and MBAs, women earn 82 cents for every $1 of male wages -- 
the differences in part reflecting seniority in the profession but also the big 
money that men haul down from top partnerships and executive positions. 
</P>
<P>
Trends for the '90s? A sure bet is that those wage gaps will close -- and those 
executive positions will open up. Or else talented employees will go elsewhere. 
Recent surveys by Opinion Research and Wick &amp; Co., a management 
consultancy, show women leaving corporations faster than men -- not for family 
reasons but to seek opportunity -- or out of frustration with the lack of it. 
</P>
<P>
In the new decade, companies that let talented people get away will decline, 
and those that motivate and keep employees will prosper. The equation is that 
simple, which is not to say that solving it will be easy. 
</P>
<P>
Catering to a diverse work force takes time and money -- there is no one 
program to suit all of today's workers. Hiring temporary replacements for 
workers on leave will be a boon to firms such as Manpower Inc., but an added 
cost for companies pressed to economize. And family issues promise new demands 
for medical benefits, just when all of business is determined to cut medical 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
So there will be tension -- which is not to say it might not be creative. 
Thanks to labor shortages, employees may finally be judged on competence and 
not gender or race. It can happen. 
</P>
<P>
Recall that when the Hubble Telescope was in trouble, two skilled mission 
specialists were alerted to go out in a spacewalk and fix it: Kathryn D. 
Sullivan and Bruce McCandless. 
</P>
<P>
No big deal: When jobs need doing, you get people who can do them.

AEROSPACE: THE FUTURE OF THE U.S. COMMERCIAL ROCKET LAUNCH INDUSTRY IS SO 
UNCERTAIN THAT SOME BELIEVE WE MAY LOSE YET ANOTHER HIGH-TECH INDUSTRY TO 
FOREIGN COMPETITORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One day last summer, in a government office in Brazil's capital city, European 
business people taught McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co. a painful lesson in 
the competitive realities of the new commercial rocket industry. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach aerospace giant, which builds the Delta II rocket, was in 
a tough fight with Arianespace Inc. of France for a $100-million-plus contract 
to launch two Brazilian telecommunications satellites. Owned in part by the 
French government, Arianespace already launches about half of the world's 
commercial satellites. 
</P>
<P>
The Brazilians wanted more than just a good price; they also wanted help in 
developing their own rocket industry. Reckoning that the competing bids would 
be close, McDonnell Douglas offered what it considered a rock-bottom price, 
with a kicker: It would finance the graduate education of two Brazilian rocket 
engineers and share some of its work on the planned U.S. space station. 
</P>
<P>
But when Arianespace unveiled its offer, McDonnell Douglas was stunned. With 
the apparent assent of the French government, the European company offered to 
give away its Viking rocket engine technology to Brazil, something the 
Americans viewed as a possible violation of international agreements on arms 
trafficking and the spread of missile technology. In addition, the French 
shaved the American bid by about $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Brazil selected Arianespace for final negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent loss of the Brazilian launch contract underscores a growing 
concern within government and industry circles. Nearly a decade after the 
Ronald Reagan Administration took the first steps to spur development of 
commercial launch businesses, the nascent industry is struggling to survive. In 
the view of many experts, decisive government action is needed to keep it from 
crashing. 
</P>
<P>
The problems that threaten commercial rocket builders are so many and the 
outlook so uncertain that some government officials talk openly of losing yet 
another high-tech industry to foreign competitors. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be taken out of the market if we don't do something about it," 
said Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner, whose department is 
responsible for the licensing and promotion of the U.S. commercial launch 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
C. J. Waylan, whose Virginia-based GTE Spacenet Corp. owns and operates six 
telecommunications satellites launched into orbit by Arianespace, was even more 
blunt: 
</P>
<P>
"We have lost our way in space," Waylan said. 
</P>
<P>
To ensure its position in the world launch market, experts suggest that the 
United States consider major policy changes, including improved government 
procurement practices, significantly increased public financing of rocket 
research and the possible creation of a multicompany consortium to promote and 
direct American commercial launches. 
</P>
<P>
While America's national space policy bars direct federal subsidies of U.S. 
rocket makers, foreign competitors often benefit from direct government 
assistance. Industry watchers say the most serious threat comes from the Soviet 
Union and China, which are signing up commercial customers for launches at 
cut-rate prices. 
</P>
<P>
In the long run, experts contend, the most promising way to improve U.S. 
competitiveness in the field will be to develop new, more efficient rockets. 
But research costs are staggering -- apparently too staggering for any one 
company to bear. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, long-term market prospects are far from assured. The backlog of 
worldwide satellite launches created by the 1986 explosion of the U.S. space 
shuttle Challenger will abate by 1992. After that, "the market we see is 15 to 
20 (satellite launches) a year, worldwide," said Alan M. Lovelace, who heads 
General Dynamics Space Systems Division. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so thin you can see through it." 
</P>
<P>
The stakes in the fight for dominance in the commercial space market are high, 
both for the nation and Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the three major U.S. rocket builders are headquartered in Southern 
California -- McDonnell Douglas Space Systems, which employs 8,200 people in 
its Orange County plant, and General Dynamics Space Systems Division, which 
builds Atlas rockets in San Diego. Martin Marietta Corp. builds the Titan 
family of rockets outside Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, McDonnell Douglas launched the first U.S. commercial rocket to 
carry a private payload into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Los Angeles County is home to Hughes Aircraft Co., a subsidiary of 
General Motors that builds about half of the world's non-military satellites. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Policy Issues 
</P>
<P>
Many experts believe that the federal government is largely to blame for 
problems facing the industry in its commercial ventures. 
</P>
<P>
The most commonly cited sins are red tape in government procurement and 
uncertain, conflicting policies toward commercial space at the Department of 
Transportation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the 
Department of Defense, particularly within the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
But the overriding issue the federal government must face, many experts say, is 
that the Reagan-era policy of barring federal subsidies to the industry has 
left it unable to compete with foreign launch concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea, which I think was flawed, was that you could turn this over to the 
private sector and they could survive without any further support," said Steven 
D. Dorfman, vice president of Hughes Aircraft. "That's true if the other 
nations are playing on the same type of field. But they aren't." 
</P>
<P>
Already, industry watchers say, some of the major rocket builders appear to be 
losing their enthusiasm for the commercial market. 
</P>
<P>
A Washington lobbyist for one of the Big Three companies told a congressional 
staff member recently that the company was concentrating on capturing a larger 
share of U.S. government contracts because of the difficulties of competing 
against foreign commercial launchers. 
</P>
<P>
Another company, Martin Marietta, has become so disillusioned that it virtually 
has abandoned commercial customers, one consultant recently charged. While a 
company spokeswoman disputed that view, she acknowledged that Martin Marietta 
from now on will focus its attention on launching non-military government 
payloads for clients such as NASA. 
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas, meanwhile, insist that they are in the 
commercial launch business to stay, although they concede that they will remain 
largely dependent on government launch contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"Could the Delta line be kept open solely on commercial launches?" asked Thomas 
E. Williams, McDonnell Douglas Space Systems' senior manager for 
communications. "Realistically, at this time, no it couldn't." 
</P>
<P>
If the Big Three rocket makers are struggling, a host of small, new 
rocket-launching concerns literally are fighting for their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Space Sciences Inc. of Houston, American Rocket Co. of Camarillo, and Orbital 
Sciences Inc. of Fairfax, Va., are three of the new companies seeking a share 
of the market for suborbital and light-payload launches, usually for scientific 
experiments. Space Sciences is headed by former astronaut Deke Slayton. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Space Shuttle Legacy 
</P>
<P>
The newcomers are among the most vocal critics of the conflicts that sometimes 
arise within the government, particularly between the Air Force, which operates 
the major government launch facilities at Cape Canaveral in Florida and 
Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, and the Department of Transportation, 
which licenses their use by commercial launchers.

<P>
Most industry watchers say the crisis facing the commercial space launch 
industry can be traced to decisions the federal government made more than a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
When NASA began developing plans for the space shuttle in the early 1970s, the 
agency believed that its new, reusable "space truck" would render rockets -- 
expendable launch vehicles, in NASA jargon -- obsolete. The shuttle was to 
become the United States' only means of launching large government and 
commercial satellites into space. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, there was no commercial rocket industry. The U.S. government, 
usually NASA or the Department of Defense, bought rockets from McDonnell 
Douglas, Martin Marietta or General Dynamics, either for weapons systems or 
satellites. The contractor delivered the rocket, and the government took charge 
of the launch. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, the Reagan Administration began to envision a role for 
privately launched rockets in the commercial development of space. In 1984, 
Congress passed the Commercial Space Launch Act, which set up a licensing 
system for commercial launches under the auspices of the Department of 
Transportation and outlined procedures for the use of government launch pads by 
private entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
But business lagged, largely because NASA offered cut-rate prices on the space 
shuttle to commercial customers who wanted to put satellites into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
The business climate changed dramatically after January, 1986, when the Space 
Shuttle Challenger blew up. The accident halted shuttle operations for more 
than two years and created a tremendous backlog of unlaunched satellites, both 
government and commercial. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1986, Reagan made a sharp turnabout and banned all but a few 
commercial satellites from the shuttle, citing the risk of shuttle operations 
and the backlog of military payloads. Two years later, he unveiled a national 
space policy that put a heavy emphasis on the commercial development of space, 
and Congress put more muscle in the space launch act. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Foreign Competition 
</P>
<P>
But the moves may have come too late. While the United States was slowly moving 
to create a domestic commercial launch industry, the Europeans were blasting 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Arianespace, which bills itself as the "world's first commercial space 
transportation company," came into being in 1980, as the United States was 
making plans to phase out its fleet of Delta, Atlas and Titan rockets in favor 
of the space shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
A third of Arianespace is owned by the French space agency. Arianespace 
launches its rockets from a facility in French Guiana built by the French 
government in the 1960s, and later expanded by the European Space Agency. 
</P>
<P>
ESA, which is supported by 14 member governments, began developing the Ariane 
family of rockets as an alternative to the shuttle. It has turned over to 
Arianespace the plans, equipment and tooling needed to manufacture the 
launchers. ESA now is working on the Ariane 5, at a cost of about $5 billion, 
with the specific goal of creating a more efficient rocket that will reduce 
launch costs. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Soviet Union, long America's arch rival in military space 
ventures, has been aggressively marketing satellite launches on its Proton 
rocket at cut-rate prices. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Congressional Research Service, the Soviets are pricing a 
Proton launch for a medium-sized satellite at about $30 million. That is 
substantially less than the cost of a U.S. commercial launch, which is 
generally estimated at from $50 million to $70 million for a medium-sized 
payload, such as a communications satellite, excluding insurance. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the Soviets have launched only one commercial satellite, for India, 
because the U.S. State Department in 1987 ruled that satellites containing 
high-tech components made in the United States cannot be launched on Soviet 
rockets. 
</P>
<P>
But last November, Energetics Inc. of Englewood, Colo., signed a contract with 
the Soviets for up to eight launches of very small, inexpensive satellites that 
will track trucks or buses as they travel across the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
On April 7, China inaugurated its commercial space program by launching into 
orbit on a Long March III rocket a telecommunications satellite manufactured in 
the United States by Hughes Aircraft. The launch price has been estimated at 
from $30 million to $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
The launch provoked a storm of protest by U.S. launch concerns, who argued that 
the subsidized price offered by the Chinese unfairly undercut the competition. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese are developing their own commercial rocket, the H-2, and the 
Australians are considering an entry into the commercial launch business by 
building their own spaceport at Cape York with the help of several American 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Corrective Efforts 
</P>
<P>
Faced with the mounting competition, Congress and the Administration are 
struggling to forge new commercial space initiatives to keep U.S. rocket 
companies in the running for international contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Closely watched is work under way at the National Space Council, the agency 
that President Bush resurrected last year to sort out the nation's goals in 
space. The council is chaired by the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
In January, the Space Council began a review of the nation's policy toward the 
commercial exploitation of space. Among the issues the council is expected to 
examine are the extent to which foreign governments subsidize foreign launch 
concerns, U.S. government procurement practices and the role of private firms 
in future U.S. space exploration, including the planned mission to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
An attempt to reduce launch costs is at the heart of legislation introduced 
last year by Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad). Packard believes that NASA and the 
Department of Defense could help American rocket makers reduce the cost of 
their commercial launches if the government agencies would more closely tailor 
their procurement policies to the commercial model. 
</P>
<P>
Another step the government could take to lower short-term launch costs is 
buying rockets in bulk, experts suggested. Bulk buying is a favorite idea of 
James Rose, the NASA official responsible for a wide-ranging program to develop 
the space industries that one day will expand the market for commercial launch 
services. 
</P>
<P>
In the long run, however, many in the industry believe that the government 
needs to fundamentally revise its relationship with the commercial launch 
industry and rethink its prohibitions against federal subsidies and cooperative 
action among domestic rocket makers. 
</P>
<P>
At the Department of Transportation, Skinner has formed a task force to study 
what role, if any, the federal government should take in the development of new 
launch complexes to exclusively serve commercial rockets. 
</P>
<P>
Because there are no private U.S. launch facilities, commercial rocket builders 
must lease time on crowded government launch pads. Delays in government 
launches have a domino effect and can wreak havoc with commercial launch 
schedules. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more radical proposals comes from Waylan, the president of GTE 
Spacenet, who suggests that the government allow domestic rocket builders to 
create a new company that would buy rockets from the manufacturers and then 
sell launch services to commercial customers throughout the world. The new 
company would be owned largely by the Big Three, but also by other investors. 
</P>
<P>
Others have suggested a more traditional model analogous to the old National 
Advisory Committee on Aeronautics, the forerunner to NASA. Such an organization 
would sponsor basic research and development that ultimately could be used by 
the commercial industry, just as NACA did for the commercial aviation business. 
</P>
<P>
NASA and the Air Force are spending some funds on development of a new, large 
rocket called the ALS, or Advanced Launch System. But critics say the level of 
commitment is low. For the 1991 fiscal year, the Bush Administration is asking 
only $114 million for work on ALS. 
</P>
<P>
If the government does not do more to promote development of new, less 
expensive rockets and launch facilities, industry experts fear, the United 
States will be left in the dust in the race for commercial space. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, development of a new relationship between government and the 
rocket industry seems inevitable, said Dorfman, the Hughes Aircraft vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a big supporter of government handouts," Dorfman said, but "I think 
that when people become aware of the reality, as opposed to the ideology, 
they're going to see that it is important to the nation."

IT'S HARD TO TELL WHERE SOME FIRMS STAND ON ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRADLEY INMAN, BRADLEY INMAN is an Oakland writer specializing in California 
business issues. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several leading industry groups have lined up to condemn the far-reaching "Big 
Green" environmental initiative on the November ballot. The California Chamber 
of Commerce, for one, says the initiative spells economic disaster. 
</P>
<P>
But it's getting hard to tell which California companies are squarely opposed 
to the measure and which are on the sidelines. Some are reluctant to admit any 
active association with the campaign against Big Green. In some cases, 
companies say they have no official position, even though public records show 
that they contributed to a committee formed last year to defeat the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Officially dubbed the environmental protection act of 1990, the initiative 
calls for phasing out pesticides found to cause cancer or birth defects, 
strengthening food safety laws, reducing air pollutants, restricting new 
offshore oil production and curtailing timber cutting. A slew of environmental 
regulations will follow if it passes. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, the public has only headlines and labels to respond to, which explains 
why there aren't many companies that want to come out against clean air, clean 
water and safe food," said Pat Mason, president of the California Foundation on 
the Environment and the Economy, an organization supported by industry. 
</P>
<P>
"They're caught between a rock and a hard spot because they have concerns about 
what's in the ballot language." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents say the measure would raise gasoline prices 25 to 50 cents per 
gallon, raise electricity costs more than 20% and reduce statewide employment 
by 1 million workers by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron U.S.A. is among those that have been cautious in reacting to Big Green. 
"We have taken no position on it," said George Marich, a Chevron spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
According to campaign disclosure statements filed with the Secretary of State, 
however, the San Francisco-based oil company gave $5,000 to the California 
Coordinating Council, the political group formed to oppose the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Marich insisted that the contribution was only to pay for "a preliminary look 
at the initiative and does not mean Chevron is committed to opposing it." 
</P>
<P>
Dow Chemical also has no official position on Big Green, but it put $15,000 
into the California Coordinating Council. According to John Ulrich, Dow's 
manager of public affairs, the CCC is considered by Dow to be a "study group" 
and not a campaign committee to oppose Big Green. "We are looking at its 
economic impact," Ulrich said. The CCC has conducted polls to gauge voter 
reaction to the measure and has hired a consulting firm to estimate the 
economic fallout from the initiative, should it pass. 
</P>
<P>
The report filed with the Secretary of State said the council was set up to 
"support or oppose state initiatives relating to California business issues." 
Council spokesman Jack McDowall said it was established specifically to oppose 
Big Green. He works for the Burlingame consulting firm of Woodward &amp; 
McDowell, which has been hired to run the campaign against the measure. 
</P>
<P>
The company contributions are nominal compared to the hundreds of thousands of 
dollars that Dow and Chevron pumped into the campaign to fight Proposition 65 
in 1986 -- the last major environmental measure on the California ballot. 
Proposition 65 required companies to disclose the presence of toxics in their 
products and reduce ground-water contamination. California voters approved the 
measure by a 2-to-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron was an outspoken critic of Proposition 65, and company representatives 
admit that the company is still reeling from its role in that campaign. Few of 
the dire predictions made by opponents of the measure came true. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we were as sophisticated about these measures in the past," 
Marich said. "It explains why we are trying to think through our position more 
carefully this time." 
</P>
<P>
The company is well aware of the need to protect its image. At the company's 
annual meeting two weeks ago, Chevron Vice Chairman James Sullivan told 
shareholders that Chevron is rated in public opinion polls as one of the most 
environmentally sensitive petroleum companies, and he described its efforts to 
cut hazardous waste disposal by 60%. 
</P>
<P>
More squarely on the sidelines is Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, which put off 
requests to contribute to the campaign against Big Green and has taken no stand 
on the measure. 
</P>
<P>
"We really don't want to oppose an environmental initiative, despite our 
concern about the requirement to reduce carbon dioxide by 20% by the year 
2000," said Victor Furtado, manager of Environmental Services for PG&amp;E. The 
San Francisco-based utility burns natural gas in its electric power plants, 
generating carbon dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
PG&amp;E is also haunted by the lessons of Proposition 65, which the company 
actively opposed. 
</P>
<P>
"My gut feeling is that (Big Green), like Prop. 65, will pass, and that plays 
into our decision," Furtado said. "Why should we risk bad publicity and spend a 
lot of money when you know it might go down?" 
</P>
<P>
Despite hesitation by some large California companies, Big Green opponents 
insist that there is no shortage of business animosity toward the measure. The 
timber industry, pesticide companies and agricultural interests are expected to 
form the financial backbone of the "No" campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"No one wants to be labeled anti-environment, but for many of our members this 
goes much too far," said Kirk West, president of the California Chamber of 
Commerce and chairman of the campaign against Big Green. 
</P>
<P>
Leave it to former Los Angeles television personality and political candidate 
Bill Press to figure out a way to drag the environmental issue into the 
campaign for state insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Considered the leading contender for the new insurance post, Press says, "these 
days everything is an environmental issue -- including insurance." An 
unsuccessful candidate for the U.S. Senate in 1988, the 50-year-old Democrat 
promises to investigate whether oil tankers and offshore oil rigs are 
adequately insured to cover the costs of an oil spill cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
Press, who was an environmental adviser to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., 
says if elected he also plans to issue guidelines for insurer's investments in 
large real estate developments, such as one planned by Prudential Insurance Co. 
in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, "clean water and clean air means a healthier planet, healthier people 
and lower insurance policies," Press says. 
</P>
<P>
Other leading candidates for the insurance post include State Sen. John 
Garamendi (D-Stockton), Bay Area attorney Ray Bourhis, Board of Equalization 
member Conway Collis and Walter Zelman, former president of Common Cause. None 
has come forward with an environmental platform.

PERSONAL FINANCE: S&amp;L WOES NEED NOT WORRY MOST DEPOSITORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Could you lose your money in a troubled bank or savings and loan? Might you be 
forced to wait for weeks or months to get it out if that institution is closed? 
</P>
<P>
Such questions are increasingly being asked by worried savers amid the almost 
daily barrage of headlines about the mounting costs of the thrift bailout and 
the woes of such prominent S&amp;Ls as Columbia Savings and Great American 
Bank. These questions are likely to persist as federal regulators -- under 
pressure to accelerate the $200-billion-plus bailout -- step up efforts to 
seize ailing thrifts and dispose of their assets. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some answers to frequently asked questions about troubled banks and 
thrifts: 
</P>
<P>
* How solid is federal deposit insurance? 
</P>
<P>
As solid as the full faith and credit of Uncle Sam. The Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp., which insures deposits in banks and thrifts, can borrow from 
the U.S. Treasury if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
If the FDIC is ever unable to pay a penny of insured deposits -- an event that 
has never happened -- the entire nation will be in a deep financial crisis. Not 
even Treasury bills will be safe. 
</P>
<P>
But while deposit insurance is solid, its terms may change. There is talk in 
Washington about such reforms as lowering the $100,000 limit or restricting 
savers to only $100,000 in total insurance, even if they spread their money to 
several institutions. 
</P>
<P>
* How do I know if my bank or thrift is troubled? 
</P>
<P>
You can get a list of the more than 300 thrifts placed in conservatorship (the 
initial step in a government takeover) from the Resolution Trust Corp., the 
federal agency managing the thrift bailout. Write: RTC Reading Room, 550 17th 
St. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20429. They may bill you for a copying charge. 
</P>
<P>
Concerning other institutions that are insolvent or weak but have yet to be 
seized, you can request financial information from them directly. But most 
folks can't make heads or tails of the complex data. 
</P>
<P>
Read the business pages for such warning signs as mounting quarterly losses or 
increases in reserves for loan losses, says Robert K. Heady, publisher of Bank 
Rate Monitor, a North Palm Beach, Fla., newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
Bank Rate Monitor's sister publication, 100 Highest Yields (P.O. Box 088888, 
North Palm Beach, Fla. 33408-8888), tracks institutions offering high-yielding 
certificates of deposit and provides rankings of those firms' financial 
strength. Those rankings are provided by Veribanc, one of several independent 
services that rate financial conditions of banks and thrifts. For information 
about Veribanc's services, write Box 461, Wakefield, Mass. 01880, or call (800) 
44-BANKS. 
</P>
<P>
Bauer Financial Reports, another such service, sells lists of troubled and safe 
institutions. For more information, write P.O. Drawer 145510, Coral Gables, 
Fla. 33114-5510 or call (800) 447-0011. 
</P>
<P>
But be wary. These and other services are not foolproof, and they are using 
data that could be made obsolete by fast-moving events. 
</P>
<P>
* What happens when regulators seize my institution? 
</P>
<P>
Nothing initially. You continue to receive the same rate of interest on your 
CD, and your accounts are fully insured up to the $100,000 limit, Heady says. 
"You can still write checks on your accounts and make cash withdrawals," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the scenes, regulators replace the old management team and send in 
auditors to review the books to decide which of three options to pursue: sell 
the institution, transfer just its deposits to another institution or close it 
outright. This process can take months, Heady says. 
</P>
<P>
* What are the risks of keeping my money at a thrift in conservatorship? 
</P>
<P>
As long as your money is fully insured within the $100,000 limit, you won't 
lose your principal. However, if the thrift is closed or sold, you could lose 
your CD rate. That's because institutions assuming the deposits of failed 
thrifts have been allowed to repudiate the CD rates of the failed institutions 
within 14 days. You won't be charged an early withdrawal penalty if you 
withdraw your money at that point, but you might have to accept a lower rate 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"If rates have gone down, that's a big risk," says Paul A. Bauer, president of 
Bauer Financial Reports. 
</P>
<P>
The RTC is expected to approve a proposal later this month to require 
institutions taking over failed thrifts to honor the old CD rates for at least 
three months. That would be good news for savers, but you'd still face an early 
termination. 
</P>
<P>
Another risk: If a thrift or bank is eventually closed and there is a deposit 
payout, you will lose interest earnings for the few days your money sits idle. 
</P>
<P>
With these risks, keeping money in a troubled institution may not be worth it, 
Bauer says. If you already have money in a CD -- and it's fully insured -- it's 
not worth taking the early withdrawal penalty to get it out of a troubled 
institution. But once the CD matures, move it to a healthy institution, he 
urges. 
</P>
<P>
* What does it mean if my thrift is switched from conservatorship to 
receivership? 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing, really," Heady says. "The switch is done to close the old thrift and 
open a new institution in its place, a step that may make selling the 
institution easier. There's no change in your CD rate, and your checks are 
still good." 
</P>
<P>
* What are the chances that a thrift in conservatorship will be closed? 
</P>
<P>
Not high. Closing thrifts -- and thus paying off all insured depositors -- 
costs the feds big bucks. Therefore, it's more likely that your insured 
deposits will be transferred to another institution. But the chances of a 
closure are greater at smaller institutions, because closing them is not as 
expensive, Bauer says. 
</P>
<P>
* What happens when my deposits are transferred? 
</P>
<P>
You'll receive a notice by mail that you're now a customer of another 
institution, most likely a bank. The notice may also describe what will happen 
to your account. 
</P>
<P>
* What happens if my thrift is closed? How long will I have to wait for my 
money? 
</P>
<P>
If you can visit the institution in person, you probably can get your money out 
within one or two days. Otherwise, it could be as long as one to three weeks -- 
the time it takes for you to receive and send back a form verifying your 
deposit and taking care of other administrative details. 
</P>
<P>
You may run into problems -- and wait much longer -- if you have more than 
$100,000 in your name at the institution or if you participate in multiple 
accounts that total more than $100,000, Heady says. "Then, regulators may 
require additional proof of ownership," he says. This could take weeks or even 
months.

WHEN LESS IS MORE (PROFIT); 
</P>
<P>
PRODUCTIVITY: CUTTING ENERGY USE WOULD TRIM COSTS, MAKING U.S. FIRMS MORE 
COMPETITIVE. IT WOULD ALSO CREATE JOBS AND CLEAN UP THE AIR. 
</P>

By PETER ASMUS and BRUCE PIASECKI, PETER ASMUS is assistant editor of 
California Policy Choices, published by USC's Sacramento Center. BRUCE PIASECKI 
is founder of the American Hazard Control Group. This article is an adaptation

If there were one investment that would make American products more competitive 
internationally, help clean up Los Angeles' renowned smog and reduce the cost 
of complying with environmental laws, wouldn't you think that the nation and 
business would plop down the currency? 
</P>
<P>
The investment we're talking about is energy efficiency, known as conservation 
in the days of Jimmy Carter. Hardly the sexiest topic in the world -- unless 
you like warm sweaters -- yet such investments seem to be a tonic for just 
about all of U.S. industry's woes. 
</P>
<P>
For manufacturers, the advantage of greater energy efficiency is quite clear: 
Production costs would drop. But despite this logical method of gaining ground 
on international competitors, the U.S. government and much of industry are 
looking the other way. 
</P>
<P>
Consider this: The United States consumes 75% more energy per dollar of gross 
national product than France and Japan do. But U.S. research and development 
support for energy efficiency is less than these two countries' and less than 
in the United Kingdom and West Germany as well. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest sin associated with our past preoccupation with fossil fuels is 
that we are losing 70% to 80% of their potential energy production because of 
inefficient combustion processes that create pollution. Cogeneration -- a term 
coined in the 1880s that refers to the generation of two types of energy from 
one fuel source -- was once the norm in this country. 
</P>
<P>
However, with the discovery of abundant oil, industry began to pay less 
attention to efficiency. Of the 16 million barrels of oil this thirsty nation 
consumes every day, more than 85% is used in monogeneration systems functioning 
at 20% to 40% efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
According to Robert Healy, author of "America's Industrial Future: An 
Environmental Perspective," American industries are falling behind because they 
won't acknowledge the correlation between low profitability and failure to 
invest in environmental upgrades such as greater efficiency. Firms doing poorly 
are typically those that disdain regulation, lobby for a relaxing of standards 
and are reluctant to invest in new energy conservation equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The steel industry, which had an average rate of profit of 7.05% throughout the 
1970s, exemplifies this shortsightedness. On the other hand, the domestic paper 
industry, whose profitability ratio stands at 12.3%, has by and large upgraded 
its processes to modern environmental standards. These investments are paying 
off. The paper industry uses 15% less energy than it did in 1972, while it has 
increased production by more than 17%. 
</P>
<P>
Too much of American industry, nevertheless, is characterized by old, 
inefficient processes. The electrolytic process by which we make aluminum has 
changed little since it was introduced in 1886. Even when industrial 
innovations occur, it takes too long for them to be widely adopted. A 
researcher who analyzed nine different petroleum refining processes discovered 
that it took an average of 13 years for a new method to become standard 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory says the benefits of improved industrial and 
residential energy use would include $100 million freed up annually for capital 
investments in U.S. industry. The poor would have more jobs and lower energy 
bills, and carbon dioxide and other air pollutants would be greatly reduced. A 
focus on energy efficiency and market incentives would also be a much cheaper 
way to clean up Los Angeles' smog than the old-fashioned command-and-control 
dictums imposed by the South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
Roughly 80% of the air pollutants that combine to produce smog are the result 
of making or consuming energy. The California Energy Commission estimates that 
California manufacturers' energy costs are 45% higher than the national 
average. 
</P>
<P>
These two statistics should make the wise business executive with both a social 
conscience and a sharp eye on the books sit up and realize that investing in 
energy efficiency is the only logical thing to do. Along with helping the 
bottom line, such investments are the cheapest way to earn both economic and 
environmental returns.

It seems to me that it would be more pertinent for General Motors to spend $500 
million on improving the quality of GM products than on advertising with NBC 
("GM, NBC Sign Big, Long-Term Advertising Pact," May 1). Doing so could 
increase employment in the industry and increase their sales automatically. 
</P>
<P>
We really don't need more advertising gimmicks but rather better U.S.-made

It is refreshing to read a discussion of technology versus ecological 
consciousness/correctness that acknowledges the give-and-take nature of 
humanity's relationship with the Earth ("Cyberpunk and the Future of 
Technology," April 19). 
</P>
<P>
I'm tired of the knee-jerk extremists in both technology and ecology who refuse 
to find a level on which to relate and successfully carry out their plans. 
</P>
<P>
I hope indeed that all of the hype surrounding Earth Day does not simply 
vaporize. It would be symptomatic of what Michael Schrage calls the "disgusting 
attitude" so prevalent in the United States regarding environmental issues.

Michael Schrage's use of "cyberpunks" to beat environmentalists over the head 
strikes me as a bit nutty. Amusing yes, but nutty. 
</P>
<P>
It's true that environmentalists range all the way from New Age Greens and 
Earth Firsters to Sierra Club Orange County Singles and Wilderness Society 
white water kayakers. 
</P>
<P>
Most of us have high-tech cars, fax machines, Gore-Tex and modems that talk to 
each other. But it is true we are suspicious of nuclear energy, malathion 
spraying (which doesn't appear to work) and high-tech fixes such as messing 
around with genes. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, as Schrage sort of admits, technology got us into these messes (and 
most of us environmentalists pump as much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as 
the next guy). We can't turn the clock back. But we can't stop it from ticking 
either. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, Mr. Schrage, what are we going to do?

BUSH CREATES VOLUNTEER CORPS FOR EAST EUROPE

<P>
Declaring that the United States "must export our experience," President Bush 
announced a series of low-cost measures Saturday intended to coordinate 
voluntary support for the democratic movements in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
He also announced a modest expansion of loans to Poland by the U.S. 
Export-Import Bank. 
</P>
<P>
And in an effort to promote "free and fair elections" in Eastern Europe, Bush 
said that he would send presidential delegations to observe elections in 
Romania and Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
But while he saluted the budding democracies that have replaced Communist 
regimes in Central and Eastern Europe, Bush declared that "there is still work 
to be done." 
</P>
<P>
"In the Baltic states, where people struggle for the right to determine their 
own future, we Americans, so free to chart our own course, identify with their 
hopes and aspirations," he said. "We're committed to self-determination for 
Lithuania and Latvia and Estonia." 
</P>
<P>
That was his only reference to the independence movements there. 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, the Soviet Union will benefit from a Europe that's whole and 
free," said Bush, who has offered verbal support for the Baltic states' efforts 
to break away from the Soviet Union but has urged them to use caution and to 
negotiate with the Kremlin leaders opposing the secessionists. 
</P>
<P>
Equating the positions of Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary with that of the 
United States in 1787 when the Constitution was being drafted, the President 
said, "For Eastern Europe's constitution-builders, the work has only now 
begun." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the spring commencement of the University of South Carolina, Bush 
announced the creation of a "Citizens Democracy Corps" that would serve as a 
clearinghouse for private voluntary aid. 
</P>
<P>
It would field requests from Central and Eastern Europe in a variety of fields, 
among them constitutional law and parliamentary reform, journalism, publishing, 
public health, economic and financial services, business practices, 
environmental protection and English-language training. 
</P>
<P>
"The real strength of our democracy is its citizens -- the collective strength 
of individual Americans," Bush said. "We're going to focus that energy where it 
can do the most good. America has much to contribute -- much it can do to help 
these nations move forward on the path to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"We must export our experience -- our two centuries of accumulated wisdom on 
the workings of free government," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
By one estimate, the government would shift $300,000 in fiscal 1991, which 
begins Oct. 1, from the budget of the Agency for International Development to 
begin the work of the Citizens Democracy Corps. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that the program run by the Export-Import Bank "will provide Poland a 
new line of medium-term export credits and loan guarantees for purchasing 
machinery, technology and services from American suppliers." 
</P>
<P>
The bank is an independent U.S. government agency that makes loans to American 
companies to help finance their overseas operations. It now holds loans worth 
about $52 million -- a relatively small sum -- for businesses in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Davidson, a White House spokesman, said that the significance of Bush's 
Export-Import Bank proposal is not in the amount of money it would make 
available but in the decision to offer medium-range loans for up to five years, 
with an added two-year grace period. Until now, only short-term loans, 
generally of one year's duration, have been granted. 
</P>
<P>
The longer payback period, he said, is "a reflection of our confidence in 
Poland." 
</P>
<P>
The White House said that the new loan policy will help support private 
enterprise in formerly Communist Poland and state-run enterprises about to 
become private operations. 
</P>
<P>
The programs unveiled by Bush in the Carolina Coliseum before the 1,661 
graduates, their guests and robed faculty members reflect the approach his 
Administration has taken in recent months as democratic movements have replaced 
Moscow-supported governments. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the programs, Bush drew on a speech by Secretary of State James 
A. Baker III, who said in Prague last February that "the spirit of revolution 
needs to move from the streets into the government." In that vein, Bush has 
frequently endorsed efforts to integrate Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary 
into a Western European order built around free elections and market economies. 
But he has offered only limited financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
Last July, during visits to Warsaw and Budapest, he proposed a $100-million 
fund to capitalize Poland's private sector and a lesser amount for Hungary, and 
he called for similar aid from other Western nations. He also has supported the 
rescheduling of Poland's staggering foreign debt and favored duty-free 
treatment of its exports to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The South Carolina speech was one in a series of commencement addresses that 
Bush is delivering this month, each linked at least loosely to the theme of 
democratic change, as he prepares for his summit meeting beginning May 30 with 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and a followup meeting of North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization chiefs of state to review policy toward Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Later, speaking at the graduation exercises at Liberty University, founded in 
1971 by the Rev. Jerry Falwell, a leader in the fundamentalist religious 
movement, Bush observed that the students who led the pro-democracy 
demonstrations in Beijing last year drew their inspiration from Thomas 
Jefferson. 
</P>
<P>
"Their image of America is not dollars but democratic ideals," the President 
said at the Lynchburg, Va., institution as he urged the graduates to "reject 
membership in a 'me' generation, proving that yours is the 'we' generation."

3 BALTIC REPUBLICS ALLY FOR SECESSION; 
</P>
<P>
INDEPENDENCE: PRESIDENTS AGREE TO COORDINATE THEIR POLITICAL EFFORTS IN DEALING 
WITH THE SOVIET UNION. A REGIONAL COUNCIL FORMED IN 1934 IS RE-ESTABLISHED.

<P>
The three Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania joined forces 
Saturday in their struggle to secede from the Soviet Union, pledging to 
coordinate their political efforts to achieve independence and to cooperate in 
economic development. 
</P>
<P>
In a declaration signed by their presidents, the three republics affirmed their 
determination to stand together in a united front to force Moscow to recognize 
their independence and resist its mounting pressure to back down. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to stick together always," Estonian President Arnold Ruutel, who 
hosted the conference, said in Tallinn, the Estonian capital. "We must give a 
hand to one another, these three small nations of Estonia, Lithuania and 
Latvia, because in the past we have always worked together in difficult times." 
</P>
<P>
The declaration, though broadly worded, lays the foundation for a joint 
strategy in the three republics' now separate campaigns for independence and to 
make their cause an international issue of much greater magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
"The Baltic governments intend to conduct negotiations with the Soviet Union, 
having agreed among themselves on a position of not deviating from the 
principle of independence," the leaders said in a joint communique, which was 
published at the end of their meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The three republics would like to meet jointly with Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev, Ruutel said following the four-hour conference at Tallinn's 
18th-Century Toompea Castle. But they remain willing to negotiate individually 
as well, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Such an approach could break the deadlock on the Baltic issue," Ruutel said of 
the proposed joint negotiations. "This is a unique historical event. We must 
join our hands together in a declaration of unity." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Gorbachev has refused to negotiate except on the basis of the Soviet 
constitution and present laws -- terms that the Baltic republics reject as 
requiring repeal of their recent declarations of independence and recognition 
of Soviet sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
The three Baltic presidents also agreed to re-establish the Council of Baltic 
States, which brought their republics into a loose union in 1934, and they said 
they would ask for their inclusion in the 35-nation Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe and then the United Nations and other international 
bodies on the basis of their membership in the old League of Nations. 
</P>
<P>
The Council of Baltic States will meet regularly at various levels to make 
non-binding recommendations on coordinated policies to the three governments on 
a range of political and economic issues, officials said. Together, the three 
republics have a population of about 8 million. 
</P>
<P>
The three republics last week put into effect new economic policies intended to 
create an integrated market in agricultural produce and farming equipment and 
supplies -- a move that draws them out of the centrally managed, state-owned 
Soviet economy and brings them closer to the market economy with its 
entrepreneurial energy that they want for the future. 
</P>
<P>
Although political leaders in all three republics have spoken before of the 
need for cooperation in their struggle for independence, the intense 
nationalism of each has made such coordination difficult. Estonia and Latvian 
leaders, moreover, have been openly critical of their Lithuanian counterparts 
for what they see as hasty action, virtually precipitating the present crisis, 
in rushing their declaration of independence. 
</P>
<P>
But after the Saturday discussions, which officials said were conducted largely 
in Russian, a firm agreement appeared to have emerged on extensive cooperation, 
starting with political coordination. 
</P>
<P>
"Our trilateral meeting presents a real possibility for solving the Baltic 
issue," Ruutel told reporters, saying that with a coordinated strategy the 
three republics would be able to press Moscow for negotiations and dramatize 
the independence issue more effectively abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The documents were also signed by President Vytautas Landsbergis of Lithuania 
and President Anatolijs Gorbunovs of Latvia. 
</P>
<P>
While all three Baltic republics declared their independence from the Soviet 
Union in the past two months, each has done so in a different way, pursuing 
different strategies and using different tactics. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow has opposed all three secession moves, insisting that each republic must 
resolve the issue through negotiations based on the Soviet constitution and new 
legislation that requires a five-year wait. Estonia and Latvia have large 
Russian minorities, many of whose members want to stay in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, moreover, is concerned that the secession of one, two or even all 
three Baltic republics, which together constitute less than 3% of the Soviet 
population, could lead to greater separatism and the eventual breakup of the 
country as a federal union. 
</P>
<P>
In its wrath, the central government has hit Lithuania, the first and boldest 
in its secessionist move, with severe economic sanctions, attempting to prevent 
it from breaking away and to discourage others from following the same course. 
</P>
<P>
"The circumstances are now more acute for Lithuania than for Latvia or 
Estonia," Lithuania's Landsbergis said. "Thus the solidarity that we feel from 
Latvia and Estonia is becoming more important. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Now we are creating a united front against the Kremlin's economic and military 
pressure, which threatens not only Lithuania but all three Baltic countries." 
</P>
<P>
Landsbergis said that, with perhaps enough fuel for only 10 days, as many as 
300,000 people could be out of work soon in Lithuania as factories close for 
lack of electrical power and raw materials. 
</P>
<P>
In separate letters to Gorbachev and President Bush, the three Baltic leaders 
appealed for international recognition of their nations' independence as a way 
to promote world peace and European stability as the two leaders prepare for 
their summit meeting in Washington at the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
The Baltic republics should be treated like the countries of Eastern Europe 
that "also lost their independence in World War II," they wrote to Gorbachev. 
"The only countries whose governmental independence has not been restored up to 
now are the Estonian Republic, the Latvian Republic and the Lithuanian 
Republic." 
</P>
<P>
Their forced incorporation into the Soviet Union under a pact with Nazi Germany 
was "an act of occupation," the three leaders declared, and must be reversed. 
</P>
<P>
"The realization of generally recognized norms of international rights in 
relation to the Baltic republics -- former full members of the League of 
Nations -- will strengthen peace, disarmament and cooperation in all of 
Europe." 
</P>
<P>
In a similar letter to Bush, the Baltic leaders made clear their hope that he 
would use the forthcoming Soviet-American summit to press Gorbachev to 
recognize their republics' independence. Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
is expected to raise the issue this week when he meets in Moscow with Gorbachev 
and Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister, to prepare the agenda 
for the summit, which begins May 30. 
</P>
<P>
"We must now do all we can to achieve our goal -- the sovereignty of our three 
nations," Gorbunovs said, reflecting the Baltic leaders' renewed determination 
to pursue their countries' independence. 
</P>
<P>
In Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, government officials reported that a column 
of more than 100 Soviet military vehicles drove through the streets about 1 
a.m. Saturday in what many residents took to be further pressure to get them to 
renounce their independence declaration. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer John-Thor Dahlburg, in Vilnius, contributed to this story.

TEEN-AGER'S DEATH ON HIKE INVESTIGATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arizona authorities are investigating the circumstances surrounding the death 
last week of a 15-year-old Northern California girl who collapsed during a 
desert hike overseen by a youth motivation group. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Sutton of Pleasanton had gone on the hike as a way to distance herself 
from alcohol and drug use, friends said. She died Wednesday after she grew 
dizzy and collapsed in a remote area north of the Grand Canyon while hiking 
with four other youths and two adult counselors. 
</P>
<P>
A close friend of the Sutton family said Saturday he hoped that police would 
learn how the teen-ager died during an activity that was supposed to be 
well-monitored. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that the thought is, 'Why did this happen and was there a 
mistake made?' " said Merrill Fisher, a bishop with the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints in Pleasanton, who notified the Sutton family of their 
daughter's death. "I'm sure the details will be sought after and found." 
</P>
<P>
According to an unconfirmed report, an autopsy by the Mohave County medical 
examiner indicated that the girl's heart stopped as a result of dehydration and 
heat exposure. But a spokesman for Summit Quest, a youth motivation group based 
in St. George, Utah, that sponsored the wilderness trek, said she had been fed 
food and water regularly since she joined the group two days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Mohave County Sheriff's Sgt. Dale Lent said counselors told investigators that 
they became lost while camping near Mount Dellenbaugh, about 100 miles 
northeast of Kingman, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
The survivors said they were almost out of water while on a long hike and that 
the girl told them she did not feel well, Lent said. Two group members went 
ahead to the next campsite to get water. However, before they returned, the 
girl collapsed and her heart stopped, Lent said. 
</P>
<P>
The counselors told authorities they tried to revive her. Summit Quest 
spokesman Bob Morey said both counselors were trained emergency medical 
technicians. 
</P>
<P>
Because they had not brought communications equipment along, the hikers were 
forced to light distress fires to attract an aircraft flying overhead. By the 
time National Park Service rangers reached the group, they were almost out of 
water, Lent said. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Fisher said he had been told by the Sutton family that under Summit 
Quest's arrangements, Michelle had traveled by plane to Arizona, where she 
linked up with the other hikers -- also troubled youths who had flown in from 
other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
"My understanding is that the hike is part of a commercial venture designed to 
help youngsters who have had troubles in one area or another to gain 
self-esteem and self-control," Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher said that Michelle had hoped to use the wilderness hike as a way to "get 
a new start" away from a circle of friends with whom she joined in alcohol and 
drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a way of getting away from peer pressure," Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher described the girl, a sophomore at Amador High School, as a "quiet but 
delightful young lady" who had been active in church affairs until her problems 
began. Fisher said that she had come to him shortly before leaving on the hike 
and told him that "she made some decisions and was feeling a lot better about 
her life."

I have this recurring daydream about an L.A. Armageddon. Usually it starts as I 
sit gridlocked on the Hollywood Freeway, watching diesel fumes drift sleepily 
over car tops. Everything goes very still on the freeway, and I get this 
picture of a holy fire descending to bring some final revenge on L.A. and 
gridlock and the whole shebang. Most of us get taken to Beach Hell for our 
sins. 
</P>
<P>
And then I start to wonder which artifacts would survive the L.A. holocaust. A 
Mike Glickman real estate sign maybe? Or a license plate that reads, "AZ4 
SUZE"? Or a bag of oranges at the end of a freeway exit? 
</P>
<P>
Actually I have my own favorite, and that's what this column is all about. My 
nominee for Last Object is Washingtonia Robusta, otherwise known as the Mexican 
fan palm. If God ever designed one creature to outlast the rest of us in Los 
Angeles, surely this is that creature. I have come to feel the warmest sense of 
kinship with the Mexican fan palm and some day you may too. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe you are thinking you haven't noticed the Mexican fan palm. That's OK. You 
must look closely, but once you've noticed it and stared in wonder at the 
incredible places where it thrives, fan palm watching can become a sort of 
obsession. 
</P>
<P>
For years, I also was unaware. Then one day, as usual, the traffic was stopped 
dead on the Hollywood and I was left to daydreaming about God's revenge. My 
gaze wandered around the collection of heavy iron puffing away and then fixed 
on the median strip. I was startled. 
</P>
<P>
Right there, shoving its tiny crown through four inches of industrial asphalt, 
was a palm tree. A seedling palm tree, its fronds already covered in grimy 
dust, its trunk entwined with audio recording tape. Somehow it had managed to 
take root in that no-man's land, underneath the asphalt, and then push its way 
upward, toward the light. 
</P>
<P>
I thought about all the petunias that had croaked in my back yard after months 
of pampering and the best nutrition Armstrong's could provide. I found myself 
hating the petunias and loving the palm tree. Where was this orphan palm 
getting its water? How could it live in the constant, carbon-monoxide winds of 
the Hollywood Freeway? 
</P>
<P>
Then I glanced down the median strip and saw another. And then another. There 
were dozens of little fan palms muscling their way through the asphalt. Some of 
them had lifted whole chunks of pavement and left cracks two inches wide. They 
were everywhere along the median strip, decorated by clumps of fiberglass 
insulation, old tire treads, used syringes. 
</P>
<P>
Since that day, I have watched for them in unlikely spots. I found one fan palm 
growing underneath an RV that must have been parked for years on a street in 
Sun Valley. The palm crown was pushing against the differential. 
</P>
<P>
There was another growing out of the corner of a building at Ventura Boulevard 
and Laurel Canyon. The owners cut it down, but you can still see the leftover 
trunk lodged underneath the outside wall, where it is partially bearing the 
weight of the building. Any day now, I expect a small green shoot to emerge 
from the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
No other palm tree behaves this way. Date palms, canary palms, queen palms are 
all more civilized, more beautiful, and you will not find them growing where 
they are not invited. Only the Mexican fan palm has this junkyard-dog quality. 
</P>
<P>
It is also homely, with a tall trunk and small crown that make it the least 
desirable of all the palms for landscaping. In Florida, where it also thrives, 
a University of Miami botanist recently called for an extermination campaign 
against the Mexican fan palm. She called it "a weed." 
</P>
<P>
Little did she know. Here in L.A., Caltrans constantly tries to exterminate the 
fan palm from the freeway median strips. The maintenance men cut them down, 
jerk them out with chains, stomp them with their boots. It doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
I called the Caltrans supervisor in charge of the Hollywood. How many fan palms 
you got out there right now, I asked. Hundreds? 
</P>
<P>
He paused. More like thousands, he said. 
</P>
<P>
They had tried everything. Even chemicals. They finally stopped because the 
chemicals had no effect whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
That palm tree, the supervisor said, is the meanest thing Caltrans deals with 
out there. 
</P>
<P>
I hung up, feeling all warm inside. Caltrans was whipped. Here was a palm that 
seemed made for L.A. It was too mean to die, too tough even for Armageddon. And 
if I had to choose, I would take it over a Mike Glickman sign, any day.

BLACKS STAGE MARCH AS 2 JURIES DELIBERATE IN RACIAL SLAYING CASE

Supporters and the family of a black teen-ager slain in a racial attack last 
summer marched Saturday through the Brooklyn neighborhood where he died, while 
two juries deliberated the fate of two white men accused in the killing. 
</P>
<P>
About 350 blacks marched for a mile through predominantly white Bensonhurst and 
were met by an equal number of whites, who lined the streets behind police 
barricades chanting "Not Guilty," and holding signs, including one that read 
"Free the boys of Bensonhurst." 
</P>
<P>
Leading the march were Moses Stewart and Diane Hawkins, the parents of Yusuf 
Hawkins, who was shot and killed Aug. 23 in a confrontation with a white mob 
carrying baseball bats. Also at the head of the procession were the Rev. Al 
Sharpton and lawyer Alton H. Maddox Jr., both civil rights activists. 
</P>
<P>
The marchers chanted "Yusuf, Yusuf" and walked past the spot where the 
16-year-old was gunned down last summer. 
</P>
<P>
There were a number of scuffles, mostly between whites and the police, but no 
serious injuries. One person was issued a summons for disorderly conduct, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Also Saturday afternoon, about 300 protesters carrying the "Black Liberation 
Flag" rallied in front of a Brooklyn courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the courthouse, jurors in the trial of Keith Mondello, the accused 
ringleader of the attack, told the judge Saturday they had reached verdicts on 
some charges, but could not agree on others. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Thadeus Owens instructed the jurors to retire for the evening, telling 
them to get a good night's sleep and "give it your best shot tomorrow." The 
jury earlier had asked for the definition of manslaughter in the second degree. 
</P>
<P>
A separate jury in the case against accused triggerman Joseph Fama ended 
another day of deliberations Saturday in state Supreme Court in Brooklyn 
without reaching a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
The jury on Friday had asked for a definition of first-degree manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Fama and Mondello both have been charged with second-degree murder, and the 
requests for definitions of the manslaughter charges seemed to indicate that 
the juries were considering lesser charges. 
</P>
<P>
The two men, both 19, are accused in the shooting death of Hawkins as a gang of 
baseball bat-wielding whites surrounded him and three black friends in 
Bensonhurst.

BUSH HONORING CHINA'S MARTYRS FOR DEMOCRACY

President Bush signed a proclamation declaring today National Day in Support of 
Freedom and Human Rights in memory of those killed in Communist China last year 
while demonstrating in support of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate, which harshly criticized Bush for refusing to impose stiff economic 
and diplomatic measures against China in response to the bloody crackdown, 
passed a resolution Friday urging the President to sign the proclamation. 
</P>
<P>
In the proclamation signed Saturday, Bush noted that last spring millions of 
people in China marched peacefully for democracy, and "tragically . . . lethal 
force was used to crush the demonstrations." 
</P>
<P>
"Steps have been taken in recent months that have resulted in some 
improvements," including the release of prisoners and the lifting of martial 
law, he said. "The United States hopes that these steps will be followed by 
others that will demonstrate China's return to the path of reform." 
</P>
<P>
Bush must decide by June 3 whether to renew China's "most favored nation" trade 
status. There is a push in Congress to revoke that status. 
</P>
<P>
China is eager to mend fences with the United States as such action could cost 
billions of dollars in exports. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Yang Shangkun leaves today on a five-nation Latin America 
trip that some diplomats say is designed to polish his image and smooth U.S. 
ties. 
</P>
<P>
One Western diplomat said Mexico might be the most important stop for Yang. "I 
think maybe the Chinese hope Mexico will act as a bridge to the United States," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yang will also visit Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina and Chile.

<P>
Two car bombs exploded Saturday in the Colombian capital, killing at least 19 
people and injuring 143, while six people were killed and 25 hurt when another 
bomb exploded in the southern city of Cali. 
</P>
<P>
No one immediately claimed responsibility for the blasts, but the nation's 
powerful drug barons are suspected. 
</P>
<P>
It was the most deadly day of bombing in Bogota since a huge blast demolished 
security police headquarters last December, killing 67 people and injuring 
hundreds. It came on a day when the city was crowded with shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb in Cali, 190 miles southwest of Bogota, exploded in a nightclub area 
of the city, headquarters of one of Colombia's most powerful cocaine cartels. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third car bomb to explode in Cali in the past two weeks in what 
authorities believe is a resurgence of a war between Colombia's two main 
cocaine cartels based in Medellin and Cali. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 143 injured in the Bogota blasts, 19 were in critical condition in local 
hospitals, a Health Ministry statement said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the Bogota car bombs exploded in the main shopping street of Quirigua, a 
heavily populated working-class suburb in the northwest of Bogota. Many of the 
casualties appeared to be aboard a crowded bus that was passing by, local radio 
station RCN reported. 
</P>
<P>
The other bomb exploded almost simultaneously a few miles away at the Niza 
shopping center in a wealthy northern suburb. Besides inflicting casualties, it 
wrecked 32 cars, Bogota Mayor Andres Pastrana said. 
</P>
<P>
The Niza bomb exploded in a parking lot across from the new, three-level mall. 
Glass from 20-foot-high plate-glass windows turned to shrapnel, according to 
RCN. It said about 200 houses and apartments and 16 stores were damaged by the 
bomb, which left a 3-foot-deep crater. 
</P>
<P>
Asked who was to blame, police Col. Jose Camero told RCN: "There's no doubt it 
was the drug mafia." 
</P>
<P>
"The Extraditables," top Colombian drug barons wanted for trial in the United 
States, pledged last month to explode huge bombs in Bogota as part of their war 
on the state. 
</P>
<P>
The authorities blame drug traffickers for scores of bombings and 
assassinations that have killed more than 200 people since the government 
cracked down on the illegal drug trade last August. 
</P>
<P>
President Virgilio Barco Vargas had launched the crackdown hours after the 
killing of presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan, which was blamed on drug 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, his administration has extradited 14 drug suspects.

U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, in a historic visit to Albania, 
welcomed the Balkan country's emergence from decades of isolation and urged its 
leaders to pay more attention to human rights, the official ATA news agency 
said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In his second day in Tirana, the U.N. chief placed a wreath at a monument 
honoring Albania's dead from World War II. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, at ceremonies welcoming Perez de Cuellar, Albania's leaders hinted 
they are willing to open wider the door that has been closed since the war, 
when it retreated into isolationism and ultra-orthodox Marxism. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Reis Malile was quoted by ATA as saying that Albania "will 
develop further relations with the European Community. Albania is for 
international cooperation, for friendship with all the countries that are for 
this cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
ATA, in its Saturday dispatch, quoted Perez de Cuellar as praising Albania's 
leaders for recent gains in human rights. 
</P>
<P>
Perez de Cuellar's visit is the first by a U.N. secretary general.

VIRGINIA AGENCIES TOLD TO SEVER LINKS TO S. AFRICA

Gov. L. Douglas Wilder on Saturday urged all state agencies and institutions to 
divest themselves of companies with interests in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Wilder, speaking at commencement ceremonies at Norfolk State University, said 
the freedom sought by blacks in South Africa "is no different from the freedom 
sought in East Germany, Poland and Lithuania. Our support can be no less." 
</P>
<P>
Wilder, the nation's first elected black governor, chose predominantly black 
Norfolk State to make the divestiture announcement. It followed reports earlier 
in the week that his Administration was quietly urging University of Virginia 
officials to sell the school's holdings in companies with South African 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
"I am directing all state agencies and institutions to implement a policy of 
divestment in South Africa, to implement a policy that will allow no further 
investments in companies that are not substantially free of interests in South 
Africa," the governor said. 
</P>
<P>
"In addition, I am directing those state agencies and institutions with present 
interests in such companies to immediately take steps to begin the divestment 
of those interests," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the university, the Virginia Supplemental Retirement System has 
between $400 million and $700 million in investments in companies operating in 
South Africa, according to system officials. Overall, the retirement system has 
almost $9 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
Wilder does not have the power to order the university or the retirement system 
to divest, but the governor makes appointments to the trustee boards of both. 
</P>
<P>
Recent progress in South Africa against apartheid, the policy of keeping whites 
and blacks separated, is a result of international indignation and sanctions, 
the governor said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are to participate in the extension to all people freedoms and liberties 
which we hold dear, we must take concrete actions which reflect our support," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The University of Virginia, where students have staged protests in recent weeks 
to push for divestiture, has reduced the South African holdings of its 
endowment from $37 million to $15.5 million. The university's total endowment 
is $460 million. 
</P>
<P>
The finance committee of the school's board of visitors plans to meet this week 
to decide whether to recommend elimination of the remaining holdings.

CHILE TO PAY COMPENSATION FOR 1976 SLAYINGS IN U.S.

<P>
A Chilean official said Saturday that his government has reached agreement with 
the United States to pay compensation for the 1976 killing of a Chilean 
opposition figure and a U.S. associate in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The "agreement in principle" came Friday in a meeting between Chilean and U.S. 
officials in Washington, acting Interior Minister Belisario Velasco said. He 
gave few details on the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Velasco said the payments would go to the families of Orlando Letelier, a 
former Chilean foreign minister who fled to the United States following a 1973 
right-wing military coup, and Ronni Moffitt, an aide to Letelier who also was 
killed when their car was bombed in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"In the next few days, a complete announcement with details will be made," 
Velasco said in an interview. He said the matter must now be taken to President 
Patricio Aylwin, a civilian who replaced Gen. Augusto Pinochet in March. 
</P>
<P>
Pinochet led the 1973 overthrow of elected civilian President Salvador Allende, 
and his military government had blocked efforts by U.S. courts and the 
government to seek compensation in the killings. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokesman Mark Dillen said: "I can't confirm 
the agreement by the Chileans, but their deputy foreign minister has been in 
town discussing bilateral issues with us and also meeting with the Organization 
of American States. 
</P>
<P>
"As of yesterday, what we were saying was that we're optimistic our discussions 
would result in a satisfactory resolution to the case." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was not expected to affect criminal cases in the United States 
against former officials of Pinochet's secret police who were indicted in the 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
Letelier served as Chile's ambassador to Washington and was foreign minister 
during the Allende government. In exile following the 1973 coup, he became a 
severe critic of Pinochet's rule. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the Sept. 21, 1976, bombing, Letelier and Moffitt were working 
for the Institute for Policy Studies.

SENAIDA SULLIVAN, 92; PRESERVATIONIST, DESCENDANT OF PIONEER L.A. FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Senaida Sullivan, active preservationist and descendant of a Los Angeles 
pioneer family, has died in the historic adobe house where she spent her life. 
She was 92. 
</P>
<P>
Her son, Gerald Sullivan, said Mrs. Sullivan died Thursday in the house in the 
Pico Robertson area. 
</P>
<P>
The adobe house, one of a handful still standing from Southern California's 
rancho era, was built in 1865 by Mrs. Sullivan's father, Antonio Rocha Jr. 
</P>

FAMILY, FRIENDS KEEP VIGIL FOR SAMMY DAVIS JR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Entertainer Sammy Davis Jr. was described by his doctor as both "resting 
comfortably" and as "dying" Saturday as family and close friends gathered at 
Davis' Beverly Hills home while fans and the media lingered outside. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not seeing any visitors except family members and close friends," Dr. 
Irving Posalski said of Davis, who was found to have throat cancer last 
September. 
</P>
<P>
Posalski, who spoke to the press outside Davis' home Saturday and in a brief 
telephone interview with The Times, said he was upset by reports that Davis' 
weight had dropped to 60 pounds and that he was lying in a fetal position. Both 
descriptions are grossly inaccurate, the physician said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not 60 pounds, and he's comfortable with his family at home," Posalski 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The health of the 64-year-old song-and-dance man has declined since he was 
released from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on March 13 to recuperate at home. He 
was admitted mid-January for treatment of a gum infection and doctors later 
found that he had a recurrence of throat cancer. No further chemotherapy was 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
Since his illness was diagnosed, "Sammy's been been getting telegrams, flowers, 
cards and letters from people throughout the world wishing him well," publicist 
Susan Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's a private family matter. . . . We're trying to give the Davis family 
as much privacy as possible," Reynolds said, "and we're hoping the media will 
understand that." 
</P>
<P>
Davis has received several visitors in recent days, including longtime friends 
Frank and Barbara Sinatra, and actor Roger Moore. Sinatra's daughter Nancy was 
among the visitors Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Another dimension of Hollywood was evident on the outside. Tour buses that 
promise glimpses of stars' homes took an extra long pause. Among the fans 
waiting outside Davis' gate, one inspired double takes -- a Sammy Davis Jr. 
look-alike who does a Sammy Davis Jr. show at a West Hollywood nightclub.

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS: IS INFLATION DATA A QUIRK? EVEN EXPERTS CAN'T AGREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Institution research organization in Washington.

<TEXT>
<P>
Inflation fears picked up this winter, and it is worth examining whether those 
fears are justified. As it happens, I have examined the outlook for inflation 
in this column at about this time in each of the past two years. Conclusions 
from those earlier columns provide some perspective on how things look today. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1988: "We are still in the middle ground where inflationary pressures 
exist but are not alarming. Objective analysis indicates that the economy 
should be allowed to continue expanding at a rate that will gradually reduce 
unemployment further." 
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate then was 5.7%. Today, it is 5.4%, having gotten to 5.2% 
in the interim. Consistent with the analysis of 1988, markets are not overly 
tight today. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1989: "The genuine dilemma for the Federal Reserve will come if 
inflation does not come down even after the economic expansion has slowed and 
an actual economic recession becomes a clear risk. That may be the situation 
before the year is over." 
</P>
<P>
The economy did slow by last year's fourth quarter, and inflation did not come 
down. Then, in this year's first quarter, most price indexes rose much faster. 
</P>
<P>
Should the spurt in prices since the first of the year change our view of 
ongoing inflation prospects? Is it scary enough to cause the Fed to tighten? 
</P>
<P>
First some facts. The Actual Inflation Rate table shows this winter's price 
spurt using three widely followed measures of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the three indicators -- theconsumer price index, the personal 
consumption deflator and the producer price index -- rose much faster during 
the first quarter of the year than in the preceding four quarters or in the 
year before that. If these rates continue, we would be looking at a major 
ratcheting up of the ongoing inflation rate. 
</P>
<P>
But part of the step up in first-quarter price increases can be accounted for 
by transient developments that do not portend a speed up in inflation. Food 
prices jumped sharply because the severely cold December weather killed fruit 
and vegetable crops in the East. And fuel prices rose but have already started 
back down. 
</P>
<P>
The Underlying Inflation Rate table shows three measures of underlying 
inflation rates, which remove potentially transient price changes and are thus 
better indicators of where inflation is heading. 
</P>
<P>
In each case, the actual price indexes are adjusted by removing the prices of 
food and energy. The underlying CPI removes prices for shelter and used cars as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
The striking thing about these measures of underlying inflation is not that the 
adjustments reduce the first-quarter inflation rate, but that the consumer 
price measures remain high even after the adjustments. The 6.9% annual rate of 
increase in the underlying CPI is the fastest quarterly increase since the 
early 1980s. The 5.6% inflation rate in the consumption deflator is less 
unusual though still high. 
</P>
<P>
The good news in the second table is in the producer price index, where 
removing food and energy prices cuts the first-quarter rate of inflation from 
the 9.1% annual rate in the overall PPI to only 3.3% in the underlying PPI. 
</P>
<P>
The discrepancy between increases in underlying producer and consumer prices 
comes in part from the different coverage of the two series. The PPI omits 
services, including fast-rising medical care and distribution markups implicit 
in the retail prices sampled for the CPI. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such differences, any sustained speedup of inflation would show up in 
both measures. So the good news about the first quarter is that the underlying 
PPI does not yet confirm the CPI speedup. 
</P>
<P>
Hourly labor costs are another indicator of the underlying inflation rate in 
the economy. The best available measure of hourly wages and salaries for the 
private sector rose 4.2% in the 12 months ended in March, which is about the 
same increase experienced in the previous five or six quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Hourly compensation, which includes the cost of benefits, rose by 5.2% in the 
year ended in March, which is about one-half point faster than compensation 
increases during the several previous quarters. Fast-rising costs of medical 
care benefits account for most of the difference between the increase in 
compensation and in wages and salaries. 
</P>
<P>
Because compensation costs enter pricing decisions, the rise in compensation 
growth helps account for some of the first quarter's increase in price 
inflation. But the fact that wage and salary increases continue to be so 
moderate suggests that no wage-price spiral has started. 
</P>
<P>
With the evidence so mixed, it is still unclear whether this winter's 
developments signal a faster pace of ongoing inflation or whether they are a 
temporary blip on the inflation horizon that will be gone by next quarter. 
</P>
<P>
That the Fed has not tightened monetary policy suggests either that the board 
is confident that they are a temporary blip or that its members have other 
worries. 
</P>
<P>
The fragile balance sheets of many financial institutions and the uncertain 
strength of the economic expansion are two reasons board members might not want 
to raise short-term interest rates at this time.

ONCE FEARFUL, U.S. RETAILERS HEAD OVERSEAS IN SEARCH OF GROWTH; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: DOMESTIC COMPETITION IS DRIVING THE NEW GLOBAL STRATEGY, BUT 
LANGUAGE AND CUSTOMS CAN BE HURDLES.

<TEXT>
<P>
Starved for a burger in Malaysia? Try the local McDonald's. Want a carton of 
milk or a rice ball in Japan? Stop by 7-Eleven. Looking for a Barbie doll in 
West Germany? Head for Toys R Us. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of big-name American retailers have, for years, pushed their 
well-known trademarks into promising overseas markets. For just as long, 
though, most U.S. merchants were cool to the idea, partly because there was so 
much business on American soil. 
</P>
<P>
Now the migration abroad is gaining momentum. More American retailers, less 
fearful of the daunting hazards of international business, are expanding, 
launching or at least considering outlets abroad, particularly in 
English-speaking countries and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Two key reasons, experts say, are stiff competition and the dwindling number of 
good locations for new stores in this country. Slow population growth in parts 
of the United States also plays a role. 
</P>
<P>
"For many retailers to grow, they're going to have to go off-shore," said Clark 
A. Johnson, chairman of the Pier 1 Imports chain. 
</P>
<P>
Added McDonald's spokesman Chuck Ebeling: "The growth potential outside the 
U.S. is almost infinite." 
</P>
<P>
American firms with international cachet are also being drawn abroad by foreign 
investors. Among them are such upscale clothiers as New York's Barneys and 
Charivari, which have teamed with Japanese partners. And Saks Fifth Avenue was 
auctioned last month to a Mideast investment group that said it wants to expand 
the chain internationally. 
</P>
<P>
Much more of the increased foreign activity involves U.S. franchising 
companies. While giants such as McDonald's continue to expand aggressively, 
their ranks overseas are being joined by smaller franchisers including Woodland 
Hills-based California Closet Co. and Irvine-based Mr. Miniblind. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the flow of U.S. stores into foreign markets is more of a trickle than a 
flood. For instance, according to the most recent statistics compiled by the 
International Franchise Assn., only 374 of the estimated 2,500 to 3,000 U.S. 
franchising companies have ventured outside this country. Many merchants are 
wary of the considerable risks and mindful of how Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. and 
J.C. Penney encountered problems and sold off some European and Latin American 
stores in the 1970s and 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer products companies such as Coca-Cola have been way ahead of U.S. 
retailers in going overseas, mainly because they deal with the public through 
distributors and other intermediaries who are familiar with local customs and 
tastes. Retailers face the trickier task of dealing directly with fickle 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easier to export an individual product than a whole ball game," said 
Michael Gould, president of the fragrance maker and retailer Giorgio Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently for similar reasons, not many foreign retailers have come to these 
shores, aside from such notable exceptions as Benetton, which sells apparel, 
and Gucci, the luxury goods firm. 
</P>
<P>
"The Europeans haven't made major inroads. It's just little boutiques," said 
Neil Thall, an executive with the consultants Kurt Salmon Associates. 
</P>
<P>
Like many other U.S. retailers, Johnson, who directed the Wickes home 
improvement stores in Western Europe in the early 1970s, said he isn't 
interested in taking Pier 1 overseas until the home furnishings company 
exhausts its opportunities domestically. 
</P>
<P>
There are good reasons for that posture: U.S. merchants face formidable 
obstacles overseas. Many worry about restrictions on exchanging currency and 
pulling out profits, along with foreign taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Clothing retailers must adjust to foreign sizes, styles and quality 
preferences. In Western Europe, for example, dry cleaning is very expensive, so 
shoppers tend to buy goods that require less care. J.C. Penney bombed in 
Belgium because it relied on American merchandise, said Walter Loeb, a New York 
retailing consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Store owners sometimes are hard-pressed to acquire good locations because of 
high real estate costs. In addition, companies accustomed to big U.S. stores 
that attract customers who drive from miles away can be stymied overseas by bad 
roads and the lack of freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Retailers who need to buy supplies in their new overseas markets often must 
deal with multi-tiered, old-boy distribution networks. "It's the biggest shock 
that American retailers have when they go overseas," said Pier 1's Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
These distribution networks are a particularly stiff barrier for supermarket 
operators and discounters, which operate on low profit margins and need to buy 
supplies as cheaply as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Retailers are hampered by other restrictions that generally don't exist here. 
In West Germany, shops generally close for the weekend on Saturday afternoon. 
Japan has locked out Toys R Us, one of the most successful international 
retailers, with a law giving local retail councils veto power over big new 
stores. Partly as a result of last month's U.S.-Japan trade accord, the 
Paramus, N.J.,-based company hopes it can enter the Japanese market next year. 
</P>
<P>
"In every country we've entered, we have had some degree of resistance," said 
Robert C. Nakasone, a Toys R Us vice chairman. 
</P>
<P>
By far the biggest barrier, however, is language. During negotiations with 
foreign partners, misunderstandings often arise, even in places where English 
is widely spoken. 
</P>
<P>
An executive with Southland Corp., parent of the 7-Eleven chain, said he was 
surprised by the puzzled looks he drew from a group of English-speaking 
investors in Hong Kong when he touted the importance of providing convenience 
for customers. 
</P>
<P>
Only later did he learn that, to his hosts, a "convenience" meant a restroom. 
(Ironically, Southland's Japanese partner has made an offer to buy the slumping 
Dallas company.) 
</P>
<P>
Some experts worry that too many U.S. firms, particularly budding franchise 
companies, are getting into the international arena without enough research. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a matter of what works in the United States works everywhere else," 
said Edward Kushell, a Los Angeles consultant and past president of the 
International Franchise Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Even big, successful franchisers have failed in foreign ventures. The 
expansion-minded Long John Silver's Seafood Shoppes chain saw its batter-fried 
codfish flop with the fish-loving Japanese. ("Too much of a greasy taste," 
explained a company spokesman.) 
</P>
<P>
Kushell said that all too often, franchise companies are prematurely drawn into 
overseas deals by foreign investors who offer up-front cash. The problems, he 
said, crop up later when the foreigners discover that the U.S. franchisers lack 
the training and operating know-how to support a big expansion in an unfamiliar 
market, raising the prospect of costly lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
In one respect, however, franchise companies are well-suited for international 
business. Accustomed to working with franchisees with ties to their individual 
markets, these companies are sometimes more flexible marketers. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's, which has built its international reputation by serving Big Macs 
and french fries worldwide, also offers pasta salads in Italy, wine in France 
and McSpaghetti noodles in the Philippines, which resembles a popular local 
dish. 
</P>
<P>
Non-franchise retailers usually team with local partners or with licensees that 
run the operations but make royalty payments to U.S. firms. Almost universally, 
native managers are hired to run the stores, although American advisers may be 
used in the early stages. 
</P>
<P>
Loeb, the retailing consultant, predicts that improved computer systems that 
enable retailers to track sales closely at far-flung stores will encourage more 
companies to test overseas markets. 
</P>
<P>
Still, even the U.S. retailers that are among the most experienced in foreign 
markets find it difficult to get started in a new country, largely because of 
language barriers and regulatory demands. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take you three or four times longer than you thought it would. . 
. . It takes a lot more patience than many U.S. businesses have," said Lewis P. 
Maddox, a new area development manager for Southland. 
</P>
<P>
Retailing experts say the companies that fare best abroad tend to have a 
special approach, product line or international cachet. A case in point is the 
jeweler Tiffany &amp; Co., which has stores in London, Zurich, Munich and Hong 
Kong, along with 10 domestic outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Another widely cited example is Toys R Us, which has thrived overseas largely 
because of its vast selection of playthings, competitive prices and its focus 
on one line of business, Nakasone said. 
</P>
<P>
Units, an innovative women's- and children's-apparel chain, recently cut a 
partnership deal to enter Japan. Said company President Milt Schulle: "You have 
to have something special to sell."

CARTOONISTS: IT'S A MUTUAL ADMIRATION SOCIETY AS ARTISTS GET TOGETHER FOR A 
WEEKEND CRUISE. AND THE NATIONAL CARTOONISTS SOCIETY PRESENTS ITS REUBEN AWARD.

ABOARD THE M.S. SUNWARD II 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was no ship of fools but there was enough foolishness aboard to sink a ship. 
</P>
<P>
Sailing on the Norwegian Cruise Line's luxury liner from Miami to the Bahamas 
and back were 125 of the world's funniest people -- the creators of a cast of 
cartoon characters that make millions laugh each day. 
</P>
<P>
The characters are some of our closest friends -- Cathy, Crock, that crank bus 
driver Ed Crankshaft, Momma, Beetle Bailey, the Wizard of Id, Wiley, Thor and 
the Clumsy Carp from B.C., Baby Zoe of Baby Blues, Miss Peach. 
</P>
<P>
And there were Jump Start's Joe Cobb and Marcy, Marmaduke, Nancy, Snuffy Smith 
and Barney Google, Tank McNamara, Mother Goose and Grimm, Luann, the Family 
Circus, Hi and Lois and many more familiar faces from the funny pages. 
</P>
<P>
What brought this many of the world's most popular comic strip cartoonists 
together for a weekend cruise was the National Cartoonists Society 44th-annual 
Reuben Award celebration, the group's once-a-year get-together. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past we have always met for about six hours in a hotel at a black-tie 
banquet and then gone home," said Mell Lazarus, Society president. "This time 
we're cooped up together for three days on a ship (and) we're really getting to 
know one another." 
</P>
<P>
It's like a floating fan club, said Mike Peters, a Pulitzer Prize-winning 
editorial cartoonist and creator of "Mother Goose and Grimm." "Being here," he 
said, "is like dying and going to heaven." 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Guisewite, whose strip "Cathy" is in its 14th year, claims she was 
speechless the first time she was in the company of such great wits. "Seeing 
all the great comic strip cartoonists whose work I had been admiring for years, 
I had to pinch myself!" she said. 
</P>
<P>
The cartoonists found pens and thick pads of paper in their staterooms when 
they boarded. And when they weren't raving about one another's work, they were 
drawing cartoons for each another. 
</P>
<P>
Picture a shipboard romance between Miss Peach and Beetle Bailey, Marmaduke and 
Garfield, Momma and the Wizard of Id. 
</P>
<P>
"All the walls in my studio are covered with drawings from other cartoonists," 
said Mort Walker, whose cartoon "Beetle Bailey" is 40 this year. Along with "Hi 
and Lois," which Walker creates with Dik Browne, his work appears in 3,000 
newspapers in 52 countries. 
</P>
<P>
At a talent show by cartoonists for cartoonists in the ship's Crow's Nest 
Lounge, the funniest passengers aboard sang, played musical instruments, 
performed magic acts, recited original poetry and put on skits -- funny skits, 
of course. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Hinds, who with Houston Chronicle film critic Jeff Millar creates the Tank 
McNamara sports comic strip, brought down the house with a self-deprecating 
look at his own on-board behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Since the cartoonists came aboard, Hinds had shown every every passing 
passenger his oversized photographs of new daughter Hannah. (The on-deck 
trading of children's and grandchildren's pictures among all the cartoonists 
was as brisk as the cartoon trading.) 
</P>
<P>
During the talent show, Hinds, who is as brawny as his comic strip hero Tank 
McNamara, balanced his beefy frame horizontally between two chairs. Cathy 
Guisewite, who unlike her strip's star, appears to weigh less than 100 pounds, 
stood on Hinds, holding photographs of his new daughter high above her head. 
</P>
<P>
Their audience of humorists hooted and howled as Bill described each picture 
Cathy waved above her head. They had all seen the same pictures a dozen times 
or more from the proud father. But it was the hit of the talent show -- even 
before the chairs collapsed and Cathy and Bill tumbled to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
While cartoonists are an amiable lot, they spend most of their waking hours in 
the near-seclusion of their studios. "We're all alone in our studios," said 
Lazarus, the Los Angeles creator of Miss Peach and Momma. His strips are read 
by 75 to 100 million people 365 days a year. "Getting an idea is easy. Making 
it work is hard. It's a lonely business." 
</P>
<P>
"Do you dream about your characters?" Brad Anderson, 65, was overheard asking 
other cartoonists. Anderson has spent 35 years doing a single panel cartoon 
about a dog named Marmaduke. Anderson, who lives in Escondido, says he borrowed 
the dignified name of a British lord "for the big clumsy ox of a dog I draw." 
</P>
<P>
"I never see Marmaduke in my dreams," Anderson said. But for Lazarus, his 
cartoon creatures are as much as part of his sleeping as his waking hours. "I 
dream all the time about Momma, Francis, Thomas and Mary Lou," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the cartoonists said they spend more time with their cartoon characters 
than with anyone else in their lives. Many of their spouses agreed. 
</P>
<P>
For Bil Keane of "Family Circus," his characters truly are members of the 
family. His strip is inspired by his five children as they were growing up and 
now, by his four grandchildren. His 47 books have sold 14 million copies of 
"Family Circus" drawings. 
</P>
<P>
"I have drawn nearly 11,000 different 'Family Circus' cartoons in the last 30 
years but no two are alike," said Keane. "I don't dare repeat. People would 
know. They tell me they stick 'Family Circus' to refrigerators and to walls at 
work and often keep them there for years." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Lou Parker, wife of Brant Parker, who draws "Wizard of Id" (Johnny Hart 
writes it) said her husband would be at the drawing board 24 hours a day if he 
had his way. "He lives and breathes that cartoon strip. I can never pull him 
away. We seldom go anywhere. I'm surprised he agreed to go on the cruise." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the often outrageous behavior of their cartoon characters, the 
cartoonists themselves acted about as conservatively as they dress -- which on 
deck was in knee-length shorts and coordinating sports shirts. 
</P>
<P>
And when their ship sailed through the Bermuda Triangle, none of the 
cartoonists appeared to notice. (Although, after the fact, Johnny Hart said he 
might do a series of comic strips about a cruise ship in a moat.) 
</P>
<P>
It was the idea of National Cartoonists Society president Mell Lazarus of Los 
Angeles to bring members together on a ship for the first time this year to 
celebrate the award of the group's highest accolade -- the Reuben Award. 
</P>
<P>
This Reuben isn't corned beef, sauerkraut and Swiss on rye. 
</P>
<P>
"It's (our) highest honor," said Family Circus' Bil Keane. "and it's a zany 
statue named after its zany designer, the late Rube Goldberg." 
</P>
<P>
The 18-inch bronze Reuben statue is typical Rube Goldberg, said Keane, who won 
it in 1982. "It is an elaborate pedestal for an ink bottle depicting a column 
of little nude acrobats playfully balancing on one another providing a derriere 
at the top on which is perched the ink bottle." 
</P>
<P>
Previous winners have included such well-known cartoonists as Milton Caniff 
("Steve Canyon"), Al Capp ("L'il Abner"), Chick Young ("Blondie"), Hank Ketcham 
("Dennis the Menace"), Mort Walker ("Beetle Bailey" and "Hi and Lois"), Charles 
Schulz ("Peanuts"), and Mell Lazarus. 
</P>
<P>
This year's winner was Jim Davis, creator of "Garfield." Other finalist were 
Cathy Guisewite ("Cathy") and Bill Watterson ("Calvin and Hobbes"). 
</P>
<P>
Davis did not join the cruise, but sent his regrets, his thanks, and the 
promise to "see you in the funny papers." 
</P>
<P>
'These guys have to get together to appreciate each other and themselves once a 
year," said Elizabeth Falk, whose husband Lee, has been doing "Mandrake the 
Magician" strip for 57 years and the "Phantom" nearly as long. 
</P>
<P>
Another old-timer on the cruise was Fred Lasswell, who draws "Barney Google and 
Snuffy Smith," a comic strip originated in 1919 by Billy DeBeck. Lasswell 
became DeBeck's assistant on the strip in 1933 and has been doing it himself 
since DeBeck died in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
Newest nationally syndicated cartoonist on the cruise was Robb Armstrong, 28, 
of Maple Shade, N.J., who creates "Jump Start," a comic strip with black 
characters launched last October and now in 75 papers. He is one of five black 
syndicated comic strip cartoonists. 
</P>
<P>
Many members of the cartoonists society weren't aboard the cruise because, they 
said, they were just too busy. 
</P>
<P>
And it isn't just creating the comic strips that keep the most successful 
cartoonists occupied. 
</P>
<P>
Many have product lines built around their characters. Forbes magazine in its 
"top entertainment earners," for example, lists Charles Schulz fourth with an 
annual income of $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
The National Cartoonists Society has 450 members, including comic strip 
cartoonists, comic book, magazine, advertising and political cartoonists, 
animators, illustrators and gag writers for cartoons. It was founded in 1946 by 
Rube Goldberg and several comic strip cartoonists. Later, other cartoonists 
from other fields were welcomed into the group. But the majority are still 
those who write and draw comic strips and comic panels. 
</P>
<P>
Cartooning is a highly competitive business. The odds of becoming one of the 
250 nationally syndicated cartoonists are very slim. Of the more than 5,000 
artists who submit comic strips each year to syndicates, only about half a 
dozen are accepted and most of those do not last more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
Next to headlines, it is said, the comic strips are the best read part of the 
newspaper. Yet, their authors are rarely well-known. 
</P>
<P>
"It's strange, but here we are each one of us with larger audiences every day 
of the year than Johnny Carson, yet we walk down the street and nobody knows us 
until we take out a pad and do a quick drawing of the comic strip character we 
do. Then there is instant recognition," said Tom Batiuk, whose comic strip 
"Crankshaft" appears in 400 newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
At the NCS annual meeting at sea, Mell Lazarus had trouble with the microphone. 
"Can't hear you. Draw it, Mell," one of the cartoonists shouts to President 
Lazarus. 
</P>
<P>
While cruising between Nassau and Great Stirrup Cay, where the cartoonists 
spent most of a day on a sparkling tropical beach, Lazarus and two other 
cartoonists sneak up to the ship's bridge where Mell "takes control" of the 
ship's wheel. 
</P>
<P>
"If we hit an iceberg, it will wipe out funny pages all over the world," sighed 
an onlooker.

Slaying of woman -- In Thursday's Westside edition, a word was inadvertently 
dropped from a story about the death of an elderly woman. The sentence should 
have read: Geon, 23, allegedly told police the slaying was provoked when his 
grandmother, 73-year-old Angelica Emma Oser, attacked him and made racial and 
other remarks about his girlfriend, who is black.

RERUNS TO RE-WATCH: WHEN LUCY GOT TOP MARX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JOAN FANTAZIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Star-struck Lucy meets Rock Hudson, Cornel Wilde and Bob Hope this week, but 
it's her encounter with Harpo Marx that leaves her speechless, in a classic 
scene on "I Love Lucy" (Friday at 9:30 a.m. on KTTV). 
</P>
<P>
Lucy gets herself into a jam-but then when doesn't she?-by bragging to her 
friends that while the Ricardos and Mertzes are in Hollywood, they've been 
palling around with the stars. 
</P>
<P>
When one of those friends comes to town, forcing her to put up or shut up, Lucy 
comes up with one of her craziest ideas ever-impersonating such actors as Gary 
Cooper, Jimmy Durante and Clark Gable. And for once, her stunt works. But just 
as she's ready to go on as Harpo Marx, the real Harpo shows up. After he plays 
"Take Me Out to the Ballgame" on his signature instrument, he and Lucy team up 
to do the now-famous mirror routine. 
</P>
<P>
Also during the Ricardo's Hollywood visit, Lucy also gets mixed up with Cornel 
Wilde (Wednesday at 9:30 a.m.), and Rock Hudson shows up on a Palm Springs 
getaway (Thursday at 9:30 a.m. on KTTV). 
</P>
<P>
On a much later episode, when the Ricardos and Mertzes are back home in New 
York, Lucy meets up with Bob Hope (Tuesday at 11 p.m. on KTTV).

THE AUTUMN OF A DICTATOR; 
</P>
<P>
A CHILEAN DIARY BY ARIEL DORFMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ariel Dorfman, Ariel Dorfman teaches literature at Duke University each 
spring. His latest book is My House is on Fire (Viking). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ARIEL DORFMAN, ONE OF Latin America's best-known writers, was exiled from his 
native Chile in December of 1973, a few months after a military coup ended 
democracy there. After he had wandered with his family from Paris to Amsterdam 
and then to Washington, D.C., the dictatorship allowed him to return in 1983. 
During the ensuing years, whenever he visited his country, he invariably 
approached the airport with a dread that turned out to be prophetic. Arriving 
one day in 1987, he was arrested and deported with his young son, a punishment 
for his human-rights campaign against the government. Although the deportation 
order was rescinded some weeks later, Dorfman could never be sure thereafter 
what fate might await him each time he went back. On March 10 of this year, he 
again returned to the airport from which he had been exiled. But this time, he 
was offered champagne, and his customs and immigration procedures were waived: 
He was coming home as a guest of Chile's democratic president-elect, Patricio 
Aylwin. This is the story of the days that followed, the story of a country 
that, after years of repression, surprisingly returned to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, March 11, 1990 
</P>
<P>
GEN. AUGUSTO PINOCHET has just made the last mistake of his long dictatorship. 
On his way to hand the presidency of Chile over to opposition leader Patricio 
Aylwin, the general has, incredibly, decided to ride in an open car, in full 
uniform, for everyone to see, through the streets of his native Valparaiso. 
Perhaps he thought that the people of his country would cheer him for this 
peaceful transfer of power -- not a habitual gesture, after all, in tyrants. 
But the thousands of Chileans who have filled the streets to celebrate the 
return to democracy are not in a magnanimous mood. "Asesino! Asesino!" they 
chant, "Murderer! Murderer!" -- a thunderous shout that the TV technicians 
transmitting the ceremonies cannot filter out, which not even the military band 
that begins to play the national anthem ahead of schedule manages to stifle. 
Nor would the censoring of sound do any good. Because now Pinochet's bodyguards 
are forced to hurriedly raise black umbrellas to stave off a downpour of 
tomatoes, eggs and sticks thrown by the irate crowd. 
</P>
<P>
It is not only this trip, the general's last ride as dictator of the country he 
has ruled with an iron hand for 16 1/2 years, that is turning out differently 
from the way he had expected. In his worst nightmares, he could never have 
imagined that he would take this ride at all, that he would someday be forced 
to give up power. 
</P>
<P>
When, exactly 10 years ago, on March 11, 1980, he rammed his constitution down 
the throats of a terrorized populace in a referendum that international 
organizations and the Roman Catholic Church called clearly fraudulent, he 
believed that he had created the mechanisms that would allow him to govern the 
nation for the rest of his life. A plebiscite, scheduled for faraway 1988, in 
which the people of Chile would be asked to say yes or no to his perpetuation 
as president, seemed a mere formality. He was sure that the citizens were too 
scared, the opposition parties too dispersed and fractious, his support in the 
armed forces and middle class too massive for a victory to be seriously denied 
to him. He was wrong. The people found courage, and in the intervening eight 
years, an economic crisis shattered his middle-class support, the opposition 
hammered out a difficult unity and important sectors of his own military told 
him that they intended to respect the outcome of the popular vote. On Oct. 5, 
1988, almost 55% of the voters rejected his claim to remain as president, and 
on Dec. 14 of 1989, a larger majority elected Aylwin, a Christian Democrat, to 
be Chile's first constitutional president since Socialist Salvador Allende died 
in the bloody 1973 military coup. 
</P>
<P>
So sure had the general been of his power that he had ordered an enormous hall 
built for his inauguration, the new Congress of the Republic whose steps he is 
now mounting in defeat. That building, which combines the pomp and grandiosity 
of a Cecil B. De Mille Roman set with the bad taste of a Mussolini 
architectural extravaganza, perversely expresses both the general's dreams of 
eternal power and, now that those dreams have proven false, his capacity to 
leave permanent scars on the face of this country. Worse than this monstrous 
edifice is the deeper damage to the people of our land: the millions ravaged by 
persecution, unemployment, detention, incessant fear; the thousands killed, 
tortured, exiled. All too many of us bear the psychological wounds that terror 
inflicts on both victim and abuser, the implacable consequences of years of 
authoritarianism and humiliations to the moral fiber of a nation. 
</P>
<P>
Aylwin inherits from Pinochet a deeply fractured country, split between the 
very rich and the extremely poor, between the privileged military and the 
outcast civilians, between those who want to forget the "unpleasantness and 
excesses" (as they call them) of this period and those who feel that all the 
atrocities must be remembered so they will never again be repeated. 
</P>
<P>
But the very violence of the confrontation of the past 16 1/2 years has, 
paradoxically, created in the whole of Chile, among haves and have-nots alike, 
a nearly unanimous desire for unity and fraternization. "National 
reconciliation" is the phrase on everybody's lips. I had only been in the 
country since yesterday, but I could already sense that this is no passing 
rhetorical fad. 
</P>
<P>
THE NEW NATIONAL obsession of Chile is the abrazo. 
</P>
<P>
Chileans have always loved to greet each other with a warm bear hug, but I have 
never before known such a mania for hugging and being hugged as that which 
welcomed me in the past 24 hours. It is not merely that everybody you encounter 
-- whatever the class, whatever the political persuasion -- squeezes you 
tightly and pummels your back with an unfamiliar intensity, but that the 
language itself overflows with proclamations of the need for Chileans to reach 
across barriers that separate them. Such a widespread and exaggerated panegyric 
and practice of the embrace reveals, I believe, just how weary of war my 
compatriots are and to what lengths they will go, after so many years of 
confrontation, to heal the wounds of the past. 
</P>
<P>
There are limits, however, to this conviviality. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Pinochet will get no abrazo today -- or ever, I suspect -- from his 
adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
From a colossal screening room in Santiago, I watch, along with many other 
guests and a number of Chilean artists, as the general enters Parliament and is 
greeted by dozens of new congressmen who show him photos of the "disappeared." 
A friend of mine tells me later that the photographers themselves muttered 
insults in his face as they snapped his picture. 
</P>
<P>
At the podium, Pinochet is confronted by the irrefutable evidence of his 
failure to modify forever, as was his intention, the soul of Chile. During 150 
years of a history that had its share of massacres and disparities of wealth 
and power, my country managed nevertheless to construct a strong and stable 
democratic tradition in which differences were settled through negotiations and 
by consensus. So much so that, with Allende in 1970, we became the first 
country in the world to attempt the experiment known as the peaceful road to 
socialism, trying to radically alter the country's chronically unfair social 
and economic structure through democratic, electoral means. 
</P>
<P>
This adherence to pluralism was so ingrained that when the military, backed by 
the United States, rose against Allende, accusing him of putting the fatherland 
in danger by fomenting confrontation instead of harmony, it did so precisely in 
the name of democracy, even though Pinochet soon decided that it was the chaos 
and disorder of democracy itself that was to blame for Allende's revolution 
and, therefore, in dire need of total restructuring. Pinochet swore, shortly 
after the coup, to "extirpate (politicians) like weeds," calling them rats, 
traitors, thieves -- vowing that they would never return. But there on the 
podium in front of him are Gabriel Valdes, a man he jailed, now president of 
the Senate, and Jose Antonio Viera Gallo, a man he exiled for 10 years, head of 
the House of Representatives. Worse still, they represent the two major 
political parties, the Christian Democrats (Valdes was the foreign affairs 
minister of the late Eduardo Frei, who governed from 1964 to 1970) and the 
Socialists (Viera Gallo was Allende's undersecretary for justice), whose 
feuding and bitter antagonism during the past 30 years opened the way, 
according to many analysts, to a military intervention. The general had gambled 
that they would never be able to overcome the antagonisms of the past. After 
all, many Christian Democrats, including Aylwin himself, welcomed the coup 
against Allende, and many of Aylwin's current left-wing ministers detested 
Eduardo Frei's policies, proclaiming that they would deny him even salt and 
water. That these rival parties, along with several smaller ones on the left 
and the right, are now allies in a governing coalition is a stunning historical 
achievement and may be proof that the Chilean elite has learned, in the hard 
struggle to regain its freedom, something that everyday people always knew: 
that what separates us is not as important as what joins us. They have 
embraced, in fact -- but for Pinochet, now there is only a cold, distant 
handshake. 
</P>
<P>
Though it remains to be seen how this new experiment will turn out -- if 
yesterday's enemies can be tomorrow's friends -- so far it has been successful: 
If there had been no unity, there would be no President-elect Aylwin advancing 
toward the podium. 
</P>
<P>
The general must now take off his presidential sash, the symbol of his 
authority. But it has become entangled and refuses to unbuckle. For three 
eternal seconds, all Chile holds its breath. It is as if power were clinging to 
Pinochet like a magnet. But now it's done, it's over, the sash is off and 
pandemonium breaks loose. Pinochet watches morosely as Valdes solemnly swears 
in Aylwin, and now, yes, it is true, the moment we have been awaiting for 6,026 
days has finally arrived. Our country has returned to democratic rule. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, Pinochet still hovers around. Then he turns stiffly and leaves -- 
still with no abrazo. The only presence that remains, like a curse, is the 
heavy empty armchair that he occupied a few minutes earlier. As nobody comes to 
cart it away, Viera Gallo boldly stands up and, amid widespread laughter, sits 
down in the place of the man who banished him, supposedly forever. 
</P>
<P>
It is as if a ghost had been chased away. 
</P>
<P>
AND YET, OUR relief may be premature. 
</P>
<P>
Pinochet has stepped out of the presidency and automatically into the post of 
commander in chief of the army for another eight years. He will have at his 
disposal an enormous contingent of troops paid for by a bloated, unmovable 
budget and dozens of houses and mansions hastily transferred to the army during 
the past few months, along with hundreds of cars and tons of furniture, tens of 
thousands of security agents and their weapons, documents and property -- and 
even his wife's multiple charity organizations, fully financed. 
</P>
<P>
The road the Chilean people have taken from dictatorship to democracy has had 
the advantage of being basically nonviolent; but it also has given the general 
time to prepare, particularly in the year and a half since his loss in the 
plebiscite, a parallel base of power, inside and outside the state, from which 
to threaten our renascent, fragile democracy. 
</P>
<P>
He has carefully infiltrated each institution with his cronies, who cannot by 
law be dismissed: Not only are the army and the National Security Council at 
his command but also the Supreme Court, part of the Senate (enough to stop 
major constitutional revisions), most of the townships, as well as universities 
and thousands of administrative posts -- even the chauffeurs of the new 
ministers are rumored to be Pinochet agents. 
</P>
<P>
During the years of Pinochet's rule, the opposition created islands of 
resistance. It took over the surface of the country space by space; it defied 
him and paid the terrible cost for that defiance, but it was that collective, 
never-ending struggle of a whole community that finally weakened and cornered 
the military regime. Now Pinochet intends to reverse the situation with his own 
islands of obstructive power, tying Aylwin's hands so that he cannot solve the 
country's problems, many of them exacerbated by Pinochet himself. And if this 
leads to disorders, Pinochet has promised that he is ready, like the Roman 
general Cincinnatus, to come out of retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Just yesterday, when actress Maria Elena Duvauchelle had driven me from the 
airport to the center of Santiago, we felt suddenly liberated by the 
realization that this was real, that soon we would cease to be strangers in our 
own land, that we would begin to have rights, that we were -- amazing that one 
should even have to write the word -- persons. For Maria Elena, specifically, 
it meant that she would never again receive death threats, as she had several 
times since 1987, and that she would not be "protected" by a police major who 
turned out to be a member of a death squad. For me, it meant that my exile was 
really over. For every Chilean, democracy was not something abstract but the 
opportunity to be treated with dignity, to be given back some control over our 
bodies and our future. 
</P>
<P>
Then three camouflaged army trucks spilling over with mattresses, furniture, 
and lamps crossed our paths and shocked us back into reality. Here in front of 
our eyes, Pinochet was stealing part of the country that our taxes had paid 
for. Pinochet's booty, taken from government houses that tomorrow he would no 
longer command, mocked us with the idea that the general may, after all, be no 
more than loaning us a constrained country, already mounting in his imagination 
those steps he built for himself when he thought he would reign among us 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
NOT EVERYBODY IN Chile, I find out, wants an abrazo. 
</P>
<P>
With my eldest son, Rodrigo, a 23-year-old actor who returned to Chile just a 
few months ago to spend some time here, I mingle with the enormous crowd that 
awaits Aylwin's arrival from Valparaiso. The problem is that when the new 
president finally appears, he passes in such a rush and with such a heavily 
armed escort that it is as if we had not seen him at all. The crowd is in a 
good mood, but I can sense its frustration: It is sad to wait this long, in 
this 92-degree heat, and capture no more than the blur of an image shielded by 
the same guards who only a few hours ago were defending the tyrant. 
</P>
<P>
Half an hour later, incidents flare up. An enormous multitude has filled the 
Alameda, and not far from where Rodrigo and I wait, fighting breaks out between 
bands of adolescents and carabineros, the militarized national police. We can 
see stones and sticks flying through the air, over the heads of the spectators, 
and as we try to press away, an armored vehicle charges into the crowd, spewing 
tear gas indiscriminately. Gagging, crying, our eyes and throats and skin 
burning, we escape -- and end up several blocks away from where the incidents 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the disorders were provoked by extreme-left guerrilla activists, as the 
police suggest, or right-wing provocateurs linked to Pinochet's secret police, 
as other sources indicate, is for the moment irrelevant. What does matter is 
that roving bands of adolescents, drunk or drugged, their faces covered with 
bandannas, have joined in with gusto. To dismiss these actions as the work of 
marginals is to forget that more than half of Chile's youth feel absolutely 
left out, unemployed and disaffected. We sit and talk to some of them and find 
them dazed, isolated, rebellious. Their hatred of the police is unlimited; they 
had all -- every one of them -- been beaten and been in jail, and not one had a 
job. These are the children of the dictatorship, its continuing legacy. Yes, 
Aylwin is their president, but they are not so sure that democracy will mean a 
difference, suspecting that they will be as excluded tomorrow as they have been 
yesterday. That night, I mention these youths to a friend who is working with 
the new minister of education and wonder whether cultural programs can be 
developed in the shantytowns where they live. 
</P>
<P>
My friend smiles. "We'll try," he says. "Except for one problem." He pauses. 
"Pinochet left us 10,000 pesos ($35) in the budget item to spend on those 
projects for the rest of 1990." 
</P>
<P>
Monday, March 12 
</P>
<P>
DURING THE 1973 COUP, Chile's new military leaders, finding themselves with an 
excess of political prisoners on their hands, hit upon what they must have 
considered an ingenious idea: Turn the National Stadium, our largest sports 
arena, into a gigantic concentration camp. Then, a few months later, after 
thousands of dissidents had been arrested and tortured, after hundreds had been 
interrogated and executed, the authorities scrubbed the floors and painted the 
benches, and reopened the coliseum to the public. The referees again blew their 
whistles, the ball once again thudded across the field . . . and gradually 
soccer fans began coming back. 
</P>
<P>
I have always refused to do so. Before I could go back to the place where I had 
watched so many sports events in democratic times, I desperately needed to 
witness some sort of act that would transform it, that would reject its 
purported normality as obscene and confront the terrible pain still echoing 
there. 
</P>
<P>
What I was waiting for, I now realize, was an act of exorcism. Because today, 
under the majestic Andes mountains, the people of Chile performed that act. 
Aylwin, by accepting this place as the site of his first official encounter 
with Chile, by referring in his speech to the horrors that had happened here 
and pledging that "nunca mas," never again, would they occur, helped us rid the 
stadium of its demons. Far more significant than his words, however, was the 
communal act of mourning that preceded them. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy thousand people suddenly hushed as they heard a solitary pianist 
playing, down on the green field, variations on a song by Victor Jara, the 
celebrated protest singer murdered by the military a few days after the coup. 
As the melody died, a group of women in black skirts and white blouses emerged, 
carrying placards with photos of men whose kidnapings by the secret police have 
never been acknowledged by Pinochet's government. These are the relatives of 
the "desaparecidos," left in a particular form of hell, not knowing if their 
loved ones are alive and being tortured, or dead and namelessly buried 
somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
That very morning, I had been to see these women, to find out their plans now 
that there is a democratic government. After all, many people -- even among 
Aylwin's allies -- feel that to normalize the country, it might be necessary to 
start forgiving the crimes of the past and start living for the future. The 
answer was calm and stubborn: Before the relatives forgive anybody, they first 
have to know the truth about what happened to their men, and once that is 
established, the criminals must be put on trial. When I press them, they admit 
that this might be difficult to attain, given that the Aylwin coalition does 
not have the votes in parliament to modify the amnesty that Pinochet offered to 
his own agents. But as we talked, I sensed the deepest of their desires: that 
the pain that the military regime had mocked should be publicly assumed and 
acknowledged by the community. 
</P>
<P>
Now on the field, one of the women -- a wife, a daughter, a mother -- begins to 
dance a cueca, expressing all her immense solitude because she is dancing, 
alone, a dance meant for a couple. There is a moment of shocked silence -- then 
people start, slowly, clapping along with the music, a savage, tender beating 
of palms that indicates that we are sharing this sorrow, that we are also 
dancing with all our missing loves of history, all our dead, and that we have 
brought them back somehow from the invisibility to which Pinochet has banished 
them. And as if answering us from beyond time, the Symphonic Orchestra of Chile 
bursts out with the chorale from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and the song of the 
Chilean resistance, Schiller's ode to joy, his prophecy of a day "when all men 
will once again be brothers." 
</P>
<P>
I have never seen -- and never want to see again -- 70,000 people crying 
together as they lay their dead to rest. 
</P>
<P>
In the years to come, we will have to repeatedly liberate all the zones, one 
after the other, that Pinochet invaded. That very night I visit La Moneda, the 
presidential palace bombed by Pinochet, where Allende died -- a place I had not 
visited since the day before the coup. And later I put on the television, where 
I have not seen a friendly face for ages, and all of a sudden there appears a 
journalist, banned for all these years, who can now gain entry to every home in 
Chile. And the feeling of victory grows giddy: If we can reconquer so much of 
the forbidden country, it is because we have resisted. The dictatorship tried 
to isolate people from one another, to isolate the present from the past and 
the future. It only wanted people to produce and consume and dream of nothing 
else. Somehow we managed to reconnect Chile. That is why we won. Because we 
kept the future alive, anticipating these moments when we would be able to 
really cleanse Pinochet's shadow from the land that he never managed to totally 
contaminate. We won because our love was fiercer than his hatred. 
</P>
<P>
But if we never want to lose our country again, then celebratory acts of magic 
are not enough. The poorest 20% of the population has decreased from consuming 
7.6% of the national total in 1969 to 4.4% in 1989, whereas the consumption of 
the richest 20% has increased from 44.5% to 54.6% in the same years. Pinochet 
has increased a disparity that he did not, however, invent. How will the new 
government deal with Chile's persistent poverty? 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, March 13 
</P>
<P>
ALTHOUGH PINOCHET supporters feel uncomfortable when asked to address 
human-rights issues, they tend to grow extremely vocal on the subject of 
Chile's economic indicators. "The rest of Latin America is a disaster," a high 
school chum who is now an impresario tells me. "Look at us: 10% growth last 
year, a modernized export sector, gradual payment of the external debt, a 
streamlined state, telephone and fax machines, a moderate inflation rate. As 
long as the new government doesn't come along and screw it up . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Aylwin's ministers have no intention of screwing it up, I discover as I hop 
around Santiago today gathering opinions. Even the Socialists -- not a 
surprise, given the worldwide trend -- do not feel they should tamper with a 
market economy that is making Chile the envy of its chaotic neighbors. But they 
dispute that it is anywhere near the "miracle" that the former government's 
experts claim: Statistics show that Chile grew less (2.6%) between 1974 and 
1989 than the rest of Latin America (2.8%). 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Ominami is an old buddy from the days of my Parisian exile. He also 
happens to be the new economy minister. "All commentators," he tells me, "focus 
on the macroeconomic factors, but there's a second story: the devastating 
social debt that has been incurred." He ticks off a series of anecdotes: Women 
giving birth on the dirty floors of hospitals because all the beds are taken. 
Slum dwellers waiting four or five hours in line for an aspirin. Dilapidated 
schools. Overexploited workers with no social benefits or health coverage. 
Rising suicide rates because of unemployment. "Aylwin's government is assigning 
priority to the 48.6% of Chileans living below the poverty level, those who go 
hungry every day. And we have to do so precisely when the economy is 
dangerously overheated; when inflation has started to rise alarmingly. And we 
have to do it with a budget that postpones social issues, with a state 
apparatus that has been mutilated by Pinochet, and without the personnel 
because the former government left thousands of its own technicians in key 
posts. And we can't upset the entrepreneurs." 
</P>
<P>
It sounds like a task that, if not impossible, is fraught with conflicts: to 
satisfy the all-powerful social class that was the main beneficiary of 
Pinochet's economic model, and at the same time attend to those who were its 
victims and who are the primary source of the government's electoral support. 
</P>
<P>
How is it to be done? Where is the money to come from? 
</P>
<P>
Ominami's budget officer insists that the new government will not pay for the 
social programs by printing money and with deficit spending. A law is being 
prepared that would raise the taxes of wealthier Chileans -- presently at a low 
15% to 20%rate. It is a solution the entrepreneurs will resist, according to 
Roberto Fantuzzi, a major industrialist. A maverick himself, Fantuzzi believes 
that it is time that some of the pain of the country should be felt by his 
colleagues, but he doubts that they, "holding all the winning cards," will 
cheerfully accept a lowering of profits. 
</P>
<P>
So what happens if the entrepreneurs don't want to cooperate, if they are not 
ready to reduce their consumption levels? What if there is no abrazo between 
workers and owners? 
</P>
<P>
I speak to several ministers in the next few hours and they all agree that 
Aylwin's style is not confrontational. "Things could get rough," Alejandro 
Foxley, minister of finance, admits, "but for now we've got them sitting down 
at the same table -- and that hadn't happened in all these years." And if the 
talks fail? Can the government simply impose the new legislation, including a 
law that makes it easier for workers to organize and strike? 
</P>
<P>
"Not really," says Rene Cortazar, the labor minister. The government may have a 
large popular majority in the House, but in the Senate the balance of power is 
held by nine senators designated by Pinochet. Each piece of legislation will 
have to be negotiated, and although there are positive signs that right-wing 
parties are willing to collaborate with Aylwin's administration -- Valdes, 
after all, was elected president of the Senate with votes from several Pinochet 
followers -- it means that some changes will simply have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
The one change that cannot wait, everybody agrees, is the democratization of 
the townships. Pinochet, in a much-needed reform, has decentralized power, 
giving local communities responsibility for education, health and housing 
projects -- but he has designated 310 of the 325 mayors for the next four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few mayors that Aylwin could name is Antonieta Saa in Conchali, a 
sprawling impoverished suburb of half a million people on the northern 
outskirts of Santiago. I am glad to see Antonieta, who happens to be my wife's 
cousin, in such an important post. A feminist, she was one of the few women 
given a job by Aylwin -- a situation that irks the many female activists who 
were protagonists of the resistance against the dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
"They've unloaded all the problems at the local level, but not any money or 
participatory channels to deal with the solutions," she says with a grin. 
"Decentralization doesn't work," she adds, "if it is authoritarian. The former 
mayor never once, in 10 years, met with the teachers or the hospital workers." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Antonieta is not waiting for the new legislation that will allow 
the citizens of Conchali to elect their own authorities. She is bubbling with 
projects. "We're going to use all the alternative non-governmental 
organizations that dissidents created all these years in order to survive, that 
made us self-reliant and independent from the state. If families discovered how 
to cook together in soup kitchens, why can't they build together, organize ways 
of buying materials, help each other now?" 
</P>
<P>
And if the 20,000 families of Conchali sharing the crowded, squalid rooms of 
their relatives cannot wait and begin to take over municipal lands and pressure 
her to act, what will she do? "People have to understand that we can't solve in 
one day the legacy of 16 1/2 years. One million new houses are needed, and we 
can only build 40,000 in the whole country in 1990. I think people will be 
patient if they themselves set the priorities, if they understand." 
</P>
<P>
And what about education? 
</P>
<P>
She is glad I asked. Off we rush to School No. 134 of Conchali, three large 
wooden shacks nicely spruced up. The director tells me that last Friday, when 
the former authorities heard that this locale had been selected for the signing 
of the new government's first international agreement for foreign assistance, 
they sent painters, carpenters and plumbers to clean it up -- the first such 
visit since the school had been inaugurated many years ago. There is now a 
flurry of activity. While a group of children who do not quite understand what 
is going on watch and cheer and make jokes, Ricardo Lagos, minister of 
education, signs with Sweden's vice-chancellor, Pierre Schorri, a protocol 
establishing that $5 million will be donated to Chile's 900 poorest elementary 
schools. The money will be channeled through the Fund for Solidarity that 
Aylwin's administration has set up -- a direct-aid-to-the-poor sort of program 
that is supposed to attract dozens of friendly foreign gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Late that afternoon, I find myself holding a long and serious conversation in 
Santiago's central plaza with a diminutive 10-year-old beggar girl, Jocelyn, 
who happens, by an extraordinary coincidence, to be a resident of Conchali. 
When I ask her how long she's been begging, she answers, "Since I was born. My 
mama begged with me in her arms right away." 
</P>
<P>
I ask her if she knows she has a new president, a new minister of education, a 
new mayor? 
</P>
<P>
She shakes her head quite emphatically, no, and happily licks away at the ice 
cream I've bought her. 
</P>
<P>
The distance between us could not be greater. The transition I have been 
immersed in these days, that I have been working for during one-third of my 
life, has totally passed her by. And yet, after all, this is more her 
transition than mine. It will have been real, it will become something more 
than an illusion, only if, six, or if she's lucky, 10 years from now, her own 
baby does not start begging as soon as it comes out into the world. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, March 14. 
</P>
<P>
I AM TO leave in a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
With Rodrigo, I go to the Vicaria de la Solidaridad, the Catholic Church's 
human rights office, to buy some gifts for friends back home. I love the 
arpilleras -- tapestries woven by women in the slums out of colorful bits and 
pieces of material and through which, during the years, they have been telling 
the stories of their everyday lives. The one thing that was rarely missing from 
those arpilleras all this time was the military. No matter what the woven 
characters were doing -- cooking, gathering wood, picking up pieces of 
cardboard to be sold to factories, hooking up illegal wires to power lines to 
heat their stoves in the winter -- the brooding presence of darkness, of 
soldiers, of ghosts, inevitably erupted into the picture. 
</P>
<P>
In the newest arpilleras, just finished, woven only yesterday, there is not one 
military figure, not one army truck, not one stretch of barbed wire. Just 
people working and people dancing. 
</P>
<P>
The women have not depicted reality as it is but reality as they want it to be. 
</P>
<P>
Will their dreams come true? Will Chile now be able to solve the problems that 
has mired it and the rest of Latin America in poverty for all our history? Or 
will the pressures from below, the accumulation of pain from the past, be so 
vast that the military will come back once again like a nightmare to repress 
the explosion of needs and desires that the present social system cannot 
satisfy? 
</P>
<P>
The answer may depend on the people of Chile, their patience, their passion, 
their maturity. 
</P>
<P>
On the Sunday of Aylwin's inauguration, I accepted an invitation to an early 
morning Mass at a small church near one of Santiago's poorest shantytowns, La 
Victoria. When the priest asked the congregation to tell their stories and 
their hopes, many stood up. I remember two women above all. One addressed God 
as if speaking to Aylwin. Or was it the other way around? "I don't want a raise 
for myself," she prayed. "All I want, Lord, is bandages at the hospital where I 
work, so I don't have to turn my patients away. Just give me enough so I can 
take care of those who are in need." 
</P>
<P>
Then another woman spoke of the Chile we were leaving. "It was a badly woven 
cloth," she said, using imagery from her everyday life. "We got the stitches 
wrong. But this time" -- and she paused and took a deep breath, "this time we 
can't fail," she said fervently. "We have to sew this one right."

"These swimsuits are for women who usually say, 'Oh, no -- not swimwear again,' 
" says Esther Williams, the amphibious movie star from the '40s and '50s who 
learned so much about what to wear in the water that she launched her own 
swimwear collection last year. 
</P>
<P>
As one might suspect, much of her inspiration has come from poring through 
scrapbooks of vintage photographs and closely examining videos of her movies 
with co-designer Mattie Hillel. 
</P>
<P>
Beading, shimmering fabrics, wrapping and tying, and generally more-covered-up 
suits are Williams' signature. A gold metallic "Neptune's Daughter" suit has a 
sheath silhouette with artful seaming and soft boning for shape. Still others 
have halter tops and shirred bodices lifted from evening wear. 
</P>
<P>
"Younger girls are discovering that this old-style glamour is fun and more 
attractive than brazen swimwear that shows all," says Williams.

RANDY LEWIS: LET'S GIVE THE KIDS A BREAK ON THE BART SIMPSON T-SHIRTS, OK? 
</P>

"Hey -- chill out, man!" 
</P>
<P>
That's what I had hoped Bart Simpson would say to all this flap in the 
schoolyards over Bart T-shirts, on which he boasts that he's an "Underachiever 
-- And Proud of It, Man." 
</P>
<P>
Some school officials, including one right here in Orange County, are actually 
banning the shirts. Carumba, dude! 
</P>
<P>
Actually, according to Fox Television, which airs "The Simpsons" every Sunday 
night at 8:30, Bart said, "I have no comment. My folks taught me to respect 
elementary school principals, even the ones who have nothing better to do than 
tell kids what to wear." 
</P>
<P>
Braying fearfully that kids are going to model themselves after a nerd like 
Bart, local school officials are proving themselves to be the biggest nerds of 
all. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, what we're saying is that we want to spend some time reinforcing 
good behavior and self-esteem rather than looking at an anti-hero." 
</P>
<P>
Zzzzzzzzzz. . . . Oops, sorry. That was La Habra City School District Supt. 
Richard Hermann talking, stopping just short of an outright ban on the Bart 
shirt, like those being enforced at Cambridge Elementary School in Orange and 
another school in Ohio. Hermann simply has asked parents not to let their 
children wear the shirts to school. Unless, that is, the Simpsons people market 
one with a more socially redeeming message. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe Bart could actually start talking about achievement rather than 
underachievement, just as cartoons have been used to send out an anti-drug 
message," Hermann suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Terrific. Let's turn Bart into one of those smarmy do-gooders that populate the 
"Smurfs." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Berry, a professor of counseling and educational psychology at UCLA -- 
who you'd think would know better -- actually said: "If I had my option, the 
T-shirt would say: 'I'm Bart Simpson. I'm an underachiever and I'm trying to do 
better.' But that's not much fun, is it?" Darn straight, Sigmund. 
</P>
<P>
The slightly skewed perspective of "The Simpsons" makes them a far more human 
and believable family than such carefully conceived, endlessly responsible TV 
facsimiles as the Huxtables, the Keatons, et al. 
</P>
<P>
Give the kids a break, OK? 
</P>
<P>
It's eminently possible that "The Simpsons" has become such a grass-roots hit 
precisely because it allows the better part of America to breathe a sigh of 
relief and say "Whew -- it's not just my family." 
</P>
<P>
That's not to shortchange the stingingly funny writing and quasi-mutant 
drawings created by cartoonist Matt Groening. But it's Groening's amazing 
memory for the details of life as a 10-year-old that seem to strike the chord 
of response, both in today's 10-year-olds and in those who have been forced to 
grow older and encouraged to forget. 
</P>
<P>
Even some of the relatively good guys in this fracas are missing the point. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Goldberg, president of the Los Angeles Unified School District Board of 
Education, is against banning the T-shirt. "I think that for most of our kids, 
wearing a T-shirt has nothing to do with achievement in school. They see it as 
totally separate," she says, and she's right. Yes, Bart flushed a cherry bomb 
down the toilet at school one day. Did the millions of kids who saw that 
episode try the same thing the next day? Nope. 
</P>
<P>
But Goldberg goes on to say that the "Underachiever" T-shirt "represents an 
anti-intellectualism that is not healthy and is within our culture." 
</P>
<P>
Anti-intellectualism? Oh, please. 
</P>
<P>
The message I get from that shirt is not that mediocrity should be a life goal, 
but that it's OK to be less than perfect. 
</P>
<P>
Through the '70s and '80s we were conditioned to try to "have it all" because 
we "only go around once." Be a Superachiever. 
</P>
<P>
But by the '90s, most of us have discovered that "having it all" is a Madison 
Avenue pipe dream. And "The Simpsons" reflects the notion that it's no sin to 
be one of the confused, groping beings that all us humans are from time to 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Let's pray that the creators of "The Simpsons" don't succumb to idiotic adults 
who want every TV show to hit viewers over the head with the bland, socially 
uplifting "always do the best you can" message. 
</P>
<P>
In one episode, Bart's sister Lisa was depressed about injustices she could see 
throughout the world, and nothing anyone said made her feel better. 
</P>
<P>
First, Lisa's mother Marge tried to pass on a lesson taught by her own mother, 
which was to put on a smile no matter how you feel. But good old Marge quickly 
recanted and let Lisa know it's not a crime to feel sad occasionally, and to 
show it. 
</P>
<P>
If these "educators" paid closer attention, they might learn that the real 
message of that episode was extremely healthy: that we should teach our kids 
what's right and what's wrong, trust them to know the difference and, above 
all, not to be afraid to be true to themselves. That way, they won't be swayed 
to the dark side by pinheaded schoolyard bullies. Or those knuckleheads in the 
principal's office.

CORONA TO PAY PRICE FOR O.C. FLOOD CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

CORONA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reginald and Lana Anderson pulled up stakes in Oregon seven years ago, 
searching for a place where they could retire and raise some livestock. They 
settled outside of Corona, on a dusty patch of land wedged between the dairy 
farms along the Riverside Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"We made plans for this place," Lana Anderson said in a recent interview. "This 
was where we were going to settle for the rest of our lives." 
</P>
<P>
But now those plans are on hold, and all because the Andersons' property 
straddles the so-called 566-foot elevation line. That invisible stripe marks 
the projected high-water line for Prado Dam, which is being raised as part of a 
massive flood-control project intended to protect Orange County from what has 
been called the worst flood threat in the West. 
</P>
<P>
After decades of debate, that project will break ground this summer, and though 
it will be months before surveys of the Prado Dam area are complete -- and 
years before land acquisition is wrapped up -- the Andersons fear they may soon 
be looking for another home. 
</P>
<P>
Their concerns are commonly echoed in the valley behind Prado Dam, where more 
than 300 property owners in Riverside and San Bernardino counties may lose all 
or part of their land to pave the way of progress. Many of them express 
frustration, complaining that they are being kept in the dark about a project 
that will safeguard Orange County's future but rob them of theirs. 
</P>
<P>
"When we bought this house, there were weeds growing up as high as the roof," 
said Myrna Guest, who lives on dusty Hellman Avenue, across the street from 
rows of dairy farms and herds of cattle. "We got out there and pulled them up 
by hand. It seems ridiculous that now we're going to have to give up our 
property for someone in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Although it's hard to picture during these times of dire drought and strict 
water conservation, experts agree that without the $1.4-billion Santa Ana River 
flood-control project, it's only a matter of time before Orange County is awash 
in water. 
</P>
<P>
Worse-case predictions suggest that a flood such as the one that inundated the 
county in January of 1862 -- when a 20-mile sheet of water stretched from the 
Fullerton hills to the ocean -- could cost 3,000 lives and cause $18 billion in 
property damage. 
</P>
<P>
In those days, there wasn't much but farmland in Orange County; today, 110,000 
acres of the nation's most productive urban and suburban land would lie three 
feet under water. 
</P>
<P>
"A recurrence of this magnitude of flood prior to the completion of the Santa 
Ana River Mainstem Project would rank as one of America's largest natural 
catastrophes, commanding countrywide headlines," George Osborne, executive 
director of the Santa Ana River Flood Protection Agency, told members of 
Congress during testimony earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Even the residents who expect to be ousted by the project don't dispute its 
importance. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, they need to do something if the flood risk is that bad," Myrna Guest 
said. "No one wants to see Orange County flooded." 
</P>
<P>
What irritates the Andersons, the Guests and many of their neighbors is the 
feeling that their concerns are being ignored and their lives uprooted by 
officials who have never bothered to so much as call despite more than a decade 
of planning the project. 
</P>
<P>
Corona's dairy land represents a rare sliver of agricultural life perched on 
the edge of urban sprawl, and it's a combination that many of the residents 
painstakingly sought out. Pigs and horses are penned up in many of the back 
yards along Hellman Avenue, and the housing developments a few miles down the 
road don't have the room -- much less, the zoning -- for livestock. 
</P>
<P>
Tired of the uncertainty, some of the residents say they'd willingly give up 
their animals and leave. But even they feel victimized by the project, saying 
that its glacial progress during the past several years has prevented them from 
getting out and on with their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a cloud that hangs over this land," said Frank Costa, who lives in a 
well-kept ranch house sitting comfortably above the high-water mark. Costa's 
house is presumably safe, but the back half of his property, where about 200 
head of dairy cattle graze, dips below the fateful 566-foot line. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not going to take the house, but I had a deal to sell this place, two 
deals actually, and they fell through as soon as they realized that this was 
the flood-control area," Costa said. "Now what am I supposed to do? I just sit 
here and wait while they take their time." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County officials are sympathetic, and say they hope to ease the 
uneasiness surrounding the project with a series of public meetings later this 
year. Letters are going out this month notifying residents whose properties may 
be affected, and ground surveys to determine the exact contours of the land 
will begin in June. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had some concern that we not alarm people out there unnecessarily," said 
Elayne Rail, project manager for the Prado Dam portion of the flood-control 
project. "We want to let them know what's going on, but we want to do it in 
such a way that it doesn't just create more concern." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, however, residents have had to glean what information they have 
from newspaper accounts and rumors. 
</P>
<P>
"No one's told us anything. There hasn't been any communication whatsoever," 
said an official with the Guadalupe Home for Boys, a center that houses 66 
children in Colton. "We may be affected because our property lies pretty low 
out here, but we just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
For workers in the area, news has been even sketchier. Of a dozen or so 
laborers who gathered for an early lunch at Chandler Street taco stand last 
week, only three had heard of the project. "So they buy the farms and move 
them," one said angrily. "We're the ones who will lose our jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Determining exactly which properties will be affected is the chief task of the 
project coordinators in the coming few months. In as many places as possible, 
officials say, they will try to protect homes and other facilities by building 
huge dikes. 
</P>
<P>
That lessens the social impact of moving families involuntarily, and it also 
holds down land-acquisition costs. 
</P>
<P>
Dikes, some of them thousands of feet long and more than 50 feet tall, will 
ring an aluminum plant, a women's prison, a sewage treatment plant and a 
portion of California 71. Some homes, depending on the topography of the land 
around them, may be buffered by dikes as well. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of others are likely to end up unprotected. Their owners will receive 
compensation for their land as well as money to help them with the process of 
relocating. But it still means giving up a way of life that some families have 
known for years, even generations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to leave a place when you've been there all your life," said Frank 
Teunissen, 27, who has helped his father run the family dairy business since he 
was old enough to work. "Some of the older boys in this area want to stay put, 
and they don't want anything to do with the dam." 
</P>
<P>
And yet, Teunissen adds, moving may not be so bad. The dairy business has grown 
crowded near Corona. Feed has to be shipped in, making it expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Dairy land in Northern California looks better all the time, and if the 
government's willing to move his cattle and set his family up somewhere else, 
Teunissen says he's willing to do his part for flood control. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got 30 years of breeding here," he said, squinting across a field of 800 
braying and shuffling cows. "But we wouldn't mind getting out. I just wish 
they'd tell us what they're doing and then hurry up and do it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana River Flood Control Project 
</P>
<P>
Many will benefit, but a few will suffer 
</P>
<P>
After years of debate, the $1.4-billion public works project begins this 
summer. Without it, more than 3 million people are at risk from a devastating 
flood. But to complete it, several hundred residents of Riverside and San 
Bernardino counties will have to be relocated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prado Dam 
</P>
<P>
Completed in 1941, revised estimates of the dam's capacity now indicate that it 
could not contain a major flood. The dam will be raised 28.4 feet, and about 
2,000 acres will be added to accommodate the reservoir behind it. That will 
probably mean displacing several hundred property owners. Riverside and San 
Bernardino counties are above the dam, while below it lie some of the most 
densely populated urban and suburban real estate in the country.

LATEST GANG KILLING BRINGS TOLL TO RECORD 17 THIS YEAR

<P>
A 21-year-old part-time construction worker from Garden Grove was killed by 
gunfire from a passing car early Saturday morning in what police believe was a 
gang shooting, bringing to at least 17 the number of gang-related murders in 
Orange County so far this year -- more than during all of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The dead man, identified by police as Jesus Gutierrez, was gunned down when he 
and about nine others were standing in the 4700 block of West Henderson Place, 
outside the home of Juan Manuel Alcantar, 24, who was shot once in the leg 
during the same incident. 
</P>
<P>
Alcantar said a car careened by the house in the cul de sac, and someone on the 
passenger side -- he did not see them clearly, he said -- pumped three or four 
bullets at their small crowd without saying anything. 
</P>
<P>
Alcantar called himself a veterano -- an ex gang member -- and said some of 
those gathered in front of his house Saturday morning were gang members. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just out there drinking, and a car pulled up and just started 
shooting, just like a regular drive-by," said Alcantar, who was recuperating at 
home. "I know it's not going to stop here. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really sad because he (Jesus) was looking forward to getting himself a 
job," Alcantar said. "He was cool people. I guess everybody who's a gang member 
has their time. Either they get out of it now, or they die later." 
</P>
<P>
He said Gutierrez was known as a tough street boxer who preferred his fists to 
handguns. 
</P>
<P>
The early Saturday morning shooting is the latest in a rash of deaths that 
erupted early on the weekend of April 21 when two teen-agers were killed by 
gang gunfire in separate incidents and another was seriously wounded. In a 
third incident that same weekend, an 8-year-old boy was shot in his home. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of those shootings, Santa Ana police decided to double the size of 
its gang detail unit and began a series of weekend gang sweeps. The police 
chief also announced he intends to hold parents responsible if their children 
violate a previously unenforced 10 p.m. curfew. 
</P>
<P>
However, the homicides have not subsided. A week after the pronouncements, 
another youth was gunned down in Garden Grove as he was talking with his 
girlfriend on the telephone. And now, there is this incident. 
</P>
<P>
Community leaders and others who work with youths reacted Saturday with dismay 
at the record number of gang shootings. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't stopped, even with the police presence," said Michael Salgado, a 
Santa Ana resident who founded Parents Against a Gang Environment shortly after 
some of last month's shootings. "It's unbelievable. . . . These are not what 
you'd consider barrios -- long-standing Hispanic communities. These are just 
complete gang wars." 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Borbon, gang prevention program director for Turning Point Family 
Services of Garden Grove, said it is easy for those who work with young people 
to feel discouraged by the mounting statistics. But he said they should find 
hope in increasing community awareness of the problem and the growing number of 
community-based groups working to bring parents, police and the schools 
together to try to keep kids from getting involved with gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could give waves of optimism, but I'm not real sure where we're going 
with this," he said. "No one knows what's around the corner. I have to try to 
stay as optimistic as possible. I don't want to say we've lost it. We haven't 
lost it. 
</P>
<P>
"We have more kids doing good things than kids doing bad things. We've got a 
lot of fine young kids out there working and getting ready for college," he 
said. "We don't hear about them." 
</P>
<P>
And while some in the community may be alarmed at the increasing gang problem 
in Orange County, where there were 16 shootings last year, others point out 
that the situation here pales compared to Los Angeles County, where there were 
570 gang-related homicides in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
About Saturday morning's incident, Santa Ana police said the two men who were 
hit were standing near Alcantar's home when a vehicle with two occupants drove 
up to them and stopped. The passenger "made contact" with Gutierrez, then "shot 
twice without any provocation," police said. 
</P>
<P>
As the vehicle drove away, several more shots were fired, one of them striking 
Alcantar in the left leg. Gutierrez died at AMI Medical Center of Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears to be gang-related," Santa Ana Police Sgt. Jack Rife said. 
</P>
<P>
A cousin of Gutierrez, who did not want his name used, said the slain man "hung 
around" with gang members. He would provide little other information about his 
cousin, whom everyone called Jessie, or "J." 
</P>
<P>
Alcantar's mother, Mariana Gutierrez, said she recalls being awakened by 
gunfire and when she looked out the front window, she saw three cars, with at 
least one of them driving away quickly down the street. It was not until the 
next morning that she learned her son had been one of those injured. 
</P>
<P>
Mariana Alcantar appeared shocked when a reporter told her her son said he was 
a veteran gang member. 
</P>
<P>
"My sons do not dress like gang members," she said. "They are not in gangs." 
</P>
<P>
Juan Manuel, whom family and friends call Manuel, is the oldest of Alcantar's 
five sons, his mother said. Another son, Abel, 18, is in the Army and has 
dreamed of becoming a police officer since he was a boy. 
</P>
<P>
A large picture of Abel in a suit dominates one wall of the living room. She 
recounted the story of how Abel was the victim of gang gunfire when he was 9, 
one day shortly after the family had moved into the neighborhood, and he was 
riding his tricycle. 
</P>
<P>
"They got him in the leg and the bullet grazed his hand, and from that day on 
he has always had bad feelings towards those who gather in the streets like 
that," she said. "And he grew up saying he wanted to a be a policeman." 
</P>
<P>
Abel has been an Explorer Scout and a junior police officer with Santa Ana 
police for several years before joining the Army last year when he turned 18. 
But at the same time, she said, her other sons have been the target of police 
investigations that she believes are unjust. 
</P>
<P>
In the neat bedroom decorated in blue and white, with a crib and other baby 
things around him, Alcantar, who works at a muffler and brake shop, said that 
his two children, 5-year-old Monica and 3-month-old Joey, are the reasons he is 
no longer in a gang. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that this happened, they're probably going to go back and shoot and just 
keep it going," he said. "As for myself, I've got a family. It's just bad luck. 
Wrong place at the wrong time. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm what you call a veterano," he said. "I hanged around (with the gang) back 
then, but it's time to move on. Mostly (in a gang), you have all the 
youngsters, the 15- to 20-year-olds, and I guess when you're older and you have 
a family, you want to get away from it and take care of your family." 
</P>
<P>
About the possibility of retaliation, he said: "I don't know if these guys are 
going to do a pay-back for this. . . . I know it's not normal. That's just the 
way it is. It's just the way of the world. Somebody gets killed and you mourn 
for that person, and then you go out and retaliate. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the homeboys have pride in their barrios. A lot of pride," he said. 
"They get so close to it, they don't want to say, 'I quit.' Homeboys become 
brothers and it's like their own brother got killed. It's been going on for 
years like this here. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish it never happened. But that's what it is," he said. "It's like a war 
going on here. . . . Pretty soon you're gonna have gang members wearing 
bulletproof vests. Pretty soon you're going to have gang members throwing hand 
grenades and bombs."

A ROLL-CALL OF GANG VICTIMS: 1990'S DEADLY NIGHTS OF WARFARE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
At least seventeen young men have died at the hands of Orange County gang 
members this year. The oldest was 31, the youngest 15. 
</P>
<P>
Some were gang members slain by rivals. Others were bystanders when gangs ran 
amok. Police say gang members tend to travel armed, don't always aim well and 
are profligate with their bullets. 
</P>
<P>
Among the innocent slain this spring was a convenience store customer who 
accused two gang members of shoplifting. They shot him point blank in the face. 
A dishwasher was slain when the restaurant where he worked was held up by 
suspected gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the homicides sparked community outrage and Page 1 stories; these 
tended to be about young victims who had family and friends to mourn and bury 
them. But it took only three paragraphs to note the passing of Jesus Perez, a 
21-year-old illegal immigrant gunned down in Santa Ana on a Friday night in 
what has by now become just an ordinary drive-by shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the murders point to a rising level of gang violence in Orange 
County. Though no exact statistics exist, the district attorney's office 
believes there were roughly 16 gang-related homicides during all of 1989, and 
an average of roughly a dozen each year for the preceding three years. 
</P>
<P>
"More and more, you say, 'Who are you with?' and they identify themselves as 
gang members," said Anaheim Police Sgt. Chet Barry. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide statistics are an imperfect measure of gang activity. Dozens of people 
have also been shot or stabbed by suspected gang members this year. One of them 
was 8-year-old Carlos Alvarez, pierced by a stray bullet while watching 
television in his own living room. The bullet went through Carlos and the wall 
and injured an aunt who was sleeping in the next room. But because both victims 
survived, that case will never be classified as a gang-related crime. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, gang members crashed a party in Anaheim last month and three people 
were severly stabbed in the resulting melee. One is still in critical 
condition, Barry said. But those three people, whose names have not been 
released by police, will be classified simply as assault victims. 
</P>
<P>
As the violence mounts, police and the public quickly lose sight of the 
humanity of the 17 young men slain in gang-related conflicts this year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really easy to get hardened and say these (victims) are just gang members 
. . . or criminals," Garden Grove Police Capt. David Abrecht said. "We lose 
sight of the fact that this is a bigger problem for our society than we'd like 
to admit." 
</P>
<P>
These are the deaths so far in 1990, according to police, prosecutors, public 
records and witnesses: 
</P>
<P>
JAN. 2 10:29 P.M.: A Witness Is Shot 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Perez, 30, is shot in the head by an unknown assailant on Myrtle Street 
in Santa Ana. Information about the case is sketchy, to say the least. Police 
say a suspect, dressed like a gang member, tried to rob a man. The man ran, and 
the suspect fired three shots after him but missed. Then, for reasons 
unexplained, the suspect turned and fired two shots at a group of people 
standing nearby. One of the bullets hit Perez in the head. He died the next 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities know almost nothing about Perez, except that his fingerprints were 
on file, and he was possibly an illegal immigrant. He was not carrying a 
wallet. No one seems to know where he came from, where he lived or worked, who 
killed him or why. The coroner has not be able to find any relatives. Perez's 
body lies unclaimed in the morgue. 
</P>
<P>
JAN. 5 11:59 P.M.: 2 Stabbed in a Fight 
</P>
<P>
Hector De La Torre, 24, of Santa Ana, said to be a member of the F-Troop gang, 
and Oscar "Tiny" Jiminez, 18, of Garden Grove, allegedly part of the Anaheim 
Westside gang, are stabbed to death outside a home on 8th Street in Garden 
Grove. Friends said their attackers were members of a third gang, the Hoodlum 
Crips of Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
De La Torre died an hour later in an emergency room of chest and groin wounds. 
He lived with his mother, hadn't finished high school and listed his occupation 
as a shipping clerk at Western Digital. 
</P>
<P>
Jiminez, who was stabbed in the neck, bled to death at 2:45 a.m. Like De La 
Torre, he was born in Mexico, and come to Orange County at age 6. He had six 
years of education. His body was turned over to his mother. 
</P>
<P>
Taula Poe, 20, of Westminster, and Arnold Mendoza, 19, of Garden Grove, will be 
tried on murder charges fon June 21. 
</P>
<P>
JAN. 20 9:56 P.M.: 'It's Such a Waste' 
</P>
<P>
Javier P. Avila, 22, of Santa Ana, is shot in the head during a melee involving 
at least 15 gang members armed with belts, bottles and knives. He dies in the 
emergency room at 4:28 the next morning. Police say Avila and three friends got 
into a fight with 10 members of the Middleside gang. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Mexico, Avila came to the U.S. at age 12. For the last six months of 
his life he had been working in the warehouse and driving a delivery truck for 
Leah's Fabric in Anaheim. A co-worker said she does not believe he was a gang 
member. She learned of his death when relatives came in to ask about insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"He was always happy, real pleasant, real nice," she said. "We're stunned. We 
just think it's such a waste, because he was nice, and he was so young." 
</P>
<P>
A teen-aged boy was arrested and charged with the murder. The case is still 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
FEB. 5 12:08 A.M.: Shot in the Back 
</P>
<P>
Aurelio Navarette, 20, is shot in the back in a drive-by attack on Artesia 
Boulevard in Buena Park. He was pronounced dead on arrival at La Palma 
Intercommunity Hospital 40 minutes later. His brother, Otoniel, is wounded in 
the arm. 
</P>
<P>
Navarette's death certificate lists him as a Buena Park High School student, 
but school officials say he had left several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Police say the brothers belonged to the Buena Park "Eastsiders." Two alleged 
members of the rival "One Way" gang in Norwalk, aged 15 and 17, have been 
charged. That homicide case, too, is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
FEB. 23 10:33 P.M.: 5 Shots From a Pickup 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Perez, a 21-year-old janitor, is a passenger in a car driving south on 
Rene Drive in Santa Ana when a pickup truck carrying several people passes them 
going in the other direction and fires at least five shots. Perez is struck in 
the head. Brain surgery fails to save him and he dies four hours later. 
</P>
<P>
Perez had come to the United States four years ago from Mexico, and his body 
was sent back to Zacatepec for burial. Police do not have a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
FEB. 24 7:51 P.M.: Bullets Spray a Family 
</P>
<P>
Salvador Villa Arias, 18, is standing with several family members outside his 
home on West 5th Street in Santa Ana when a red pickup truck drives by. A 
gunman in the back sprays the group with at least six bullets, and one hits 
Arias in the back of the head. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe Arias was a gang member, but his mother, Teresa Villa, said her 
son didn't smoke, didn't drink, didn't wear gang colors and did not have 
friends in a gang. But family members noted that the notorious 5th Street gang 
controls an area on the other side of Euclid Street, away from their 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Arias had recently left Los Amigos High School to work as a gardener. His body 
was returned to Michoacan, Mexico, for burial. 
</P>
<P>
The day after the shooting, police arrested Steven Joseph Salazar, 23, of Santa 
Ana. Though investigators identified him as a gang member, they declined to 
specify which gang. One investigator said he has found gang members who save 
their press clippings in photo albums and view them as a status symbol. 
</P>
<P>
MARCH 4 8:10 P.M.: Argument at a Dance Studio 
</P>
<P>
Ha Huu Dang, 21, is shot in the head in the restroom of Jimmy's Ballroom Dance 
Studio in Garden Grove. Police said Dang was not a gang member but had argued 
with three young men who were. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Vietnam, Dang had graduated from high school and moved to Orange County 
two years ago. For the past six months, he had been working on an assembly line 
at Starkey California in Anaheim, making hearing aids. His former boss, Keith 
Stifter, described Dang as "easy-going, willing to help, kind of a 
happy-go-lucky guy. Never really seemed like anything bothered him." 
</P>
<P>
A woman who worked at the dance studio said Dang had come there every week or 
two with a group of friends. "After the shooting, his friends never came back," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Police say they have a suspect but have not made an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
MARCH 15 11:21 P.M.: A Bystander Panics 
</P>
<P>
Margarito Alvarado-Robledo, 25, a dishwasher in the Mi Ho Restaurant in Garden 
Grove, is in the kitchen putting away leftovers when a gunman demands money. 
According to the owner, Alvarado-Robledo panics and tries to run, and the 
robber shoots him in the neck. Police believe the robber is a gang member, but 
have not made an arrest. Details are sketchy, and Garden Grove Police Capt. 
David Abrecht said the case may not ultimately be classified as a "gang-related 
homicide." 
</P>
<P>
Alvarado-Robledo fought for life for seven days before he died. According to 
his death certificate, he had completed elementary school, had been in Orange 
County for two years, was married and lived in Stanton. His body was sent to La 
Esperanza, Mexico for burial. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking through a Korean interpreter, the owner, Chung W. Choi described 
Alvarado-Robledo as a "very good employee, very honest and hard-working." Choi 
said he had immigrated four years ago from Seoul, and the killing so frightened 
him that for a time he contemplated returning to South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
MARCH 19 12:11 A.M.: Confrontation in a Store 
</P>
<P>
David Eugene Davenport, 31, walks into a Circle K convenience store in Garden 
Grove to buy cigarettes. Davenport, who had lost his job and apartment and was 
trying to find work, befriended the night clerk. He accuses two young men of 
shoplifting. According to Garden Grove Police Det. Mike Handfield, the three 
men argued briefly and stepped out of the store together. Then the younger of 
the two shot Davenport in the face. He died instantly. 
</P>
<P>
The two men and a juvenile girl in their car were later arrested. The 
17-year-old's name has not been released, but prosecutors have asked for a 
hearing May 25 in a bid to prosecute him as an adult. His companion, Cesar Nava 
Sustaita, 19, has been charged with being an accessory to murder. Handfield 
said both men belonged to the "Hard Times" gang based in the Buena Clinton 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Davenport grew up in Garden Grove, attended Rancho Alamitos High School and had 
been working as a landscaper, said his mother, Ann Gehrig, who now lives in 
Coulterville, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time," Gehrig said. 
</P>
<P>
There are no gangs in Coulterville, she said. "That's one of the reasons we're 
here." 
</P>
<P>
MARCH 24 1:42 A.M.: 'Rolling Gun Battle' 
</P>
<P>
Nabor Eustolio Roman, 16, died after being shot several times in the back 
during what authorities called "a rolling gun battle." Santa Ana police 
described Roman as a well-known member of the Highland Street gang who 
allegedly had shot and wounded a pedestrian earlier that night after an 
argument over drugs. 
</P>
<P>
An hour later, police said, members of a rival gang found Roman on Townsend 
Street and shot him dead. Police said two separate guns were used in the 
slaying. No one has been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
APRIL 3 6:40 P.M.: 6 Shots From a Passing Car 
</P>
<P>
Martin Lopez Rosiles Jr., 19, of Santa Ana, who had been working as a film 
developer, is shot in the back in a drive-by attack in El Modena, an 
unincorporated area near Orange. Another 17-year-old is wounded. Rosiles dies 
45 minutes later in Chapman General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting is a typical gang attack. Vine Street residents said five or six 
shots were fired from a gray Honda at random into a group of people standing in 
front of a home. Police say gang members sometimes fire at people or a house 
without even knowing their intended victim. The Rosiles case has not been 
solved. 
</P>
<P>
APRIL 10 6:20 P.M.: Holding a Child's Hand 
</P>
<P>
Martin Julian Gonzalez, 21, is walking along Myrtle Street in Santa Ana headed 
to the store, holding the hand of his girlfriend's 4-year-old daughter, when a 
man jumps out of a passing car at shoots him in the neck and chest. The girl is 
unharmed. Gonzalez dies less than an hour later, despite emergency surgery at 
UCI Medical Center in Orange. Friends said Gonzalez had been trying to 
extricate himself from street life. Police believe the shooting is gang-related 
but have made no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
APRIL 20 10:30 P.M.: 'Puro Southside!' 'Highland!' 
</P>
<P>
Rojelio M. (Roger) Ochoa, 17, is shot four times in the back after an argument 
with suspected gang members at a birthday party for a friend on East 3rd Street 
in Santa Ana. According to Santa Ana Police Lt. David Salazar, witnesses heard 
Ochoa yell, "Puro (Pure) Southside," then saw his attacker fire four shots and 
shout, "Highland!" Ochoa was described as a gentle boy from a tough 
neighborhood who had left school for a job learning to repair personal 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
Eight days later, Eleazar Gonzales, 20, was arrested on suspicion of the 
murder. Two months earlier, Gonzales, identified as a longtime Highland gang 
member, had been acquitted of the 1988 murder of a fellow gang member. Gonzales 
has said he is innocent of both killings. 
</P>
<P>
APRIL 22 12:52 A.M.: 'He Wasn't a Criminal' 
</P>
<P>
 Cesar Torres Salgado, 15, is shot three times in the side from a passing van 
as he is leaving a Santa Ana party at a South Hickory Street home. By 3 a.m. he 
is dead. Salgado's friend, Javier Torres, 18, is shot in the back but survives. 
</P>
<P>
Police and neighbors say the house is a longtime "Lopers" hang-out and is 
pockmarked with bullets. Neighbors say the Lopers have been feuding for some 
time with the nearby "Eastsiders." But friends said Salgado, a Horizon High 
School student, belonged to a third gang named "Middleside." His street name 
was "Night Owl" because he liked to stay up late. But they said he was just a 
guest at the party, an innocent teen-ager who did not deserve to die. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a home boy, but he wasn't a criminal," one said. 
</P>
<P>
APRIL 30 11:15 P.M.: He Dies in a Cousin's Arms 
</P>
<P>
Rosendo Ibarra, 17, of Anaheim, is gunned down while talking to his girlfriend 
at a pay telephone in a Garden Grove shopping center parking lot. He is shot 
twice, once in the head, and dies in the arms of his cousin, Mona Marquez, 
before help arrives. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove police say Ibarra, a construction worker who had been out of work 
since breaking his leg in February, was a member of the Colonia gang in 
Stanton. Relatives reported seeing a dark Cadillac circling their neighborhood 
the night before, and believe the shooting was planned. 
</P>
<P>
David Alan Davis, 22, and Joe David Kehler, 23, both of Anaheim, have been 
arrested on suspicion of the murder. Both men have been separately charged in 
drug cases but it is not known whether Ibarra's killing was drug-related. 
Police are still seeking several other suspects in the murder. 
</P>
<P>
Ibarra was the father of a year-old daughter named Casandra. 
</P>
<P>
Mona Marquez cried last week as she tried to explain how it felt to hold her 
cousin as he died. "I don't know who to hate, but I want something done," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
MAY 11 1:30 A.M.: An 'Ordinary' Drive-By 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Gutierrez, 21, of Garden Grove, is killed by gunfire from a passing car 
as he and a friend stand in front of a house on West Henderson Place in Santa 
Ana. Witnesses said Gutierrez, who died at the scene, hung around with gang 
members. Also wounded was Juan Manuel Alcantar, a 25-year-old Santa Ana man who 
described himself as a former member of the Middleside gang. 
</P>
<P>
A RECORD GANG DEATH TOLL 
</P>
<P>
With at least 17 deaths in the first five months of this year, law enforcement 
authorities say gang violence is surpassing 1989, when roughly 16 gang-related 
murders were committed.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: MEDIA OFTEN AT MERCY OF WITNESSES' VERACITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From outward appearances, this was the classic story of a grass-roots hero 
struck down by criminals while trying to defend his neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
But the story turned out to be a lot more complicated. 
</P>
<P>
On May 5, a resident of the 1400 block of West Walnut Street in Santa Ana was 
shot and fatally wounded after a confrontation between residents and a group of 
suspected drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors told Santa Ana police and reporters that heavily armed dealers 
returned to the street and shot Celestino Morales Davila, 22, as other 
residents huddled in fear behind locked doors. The story was so compelling that 
it made Page 1. 
</P>
<P>
But on further investigation, Santa Ana police discovered that the neighbors 
were the only ones doing any shooting. 
</P>
<P>
In a tragic twist, police said, a bullet fired from the gun of a resident 
struck Morales, leaving him mortally wounded. Pellets from a shotgun blast 
fired into the air from a neighbor wounded 19-year-old Sabino Mena Moreno. The 
neighbors were firing warning shots as the dealers returned to the street to 
continue a battle, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The story demonstrated the vulnerability of the news media, especially in 
police stories when there is often no way to immediately verify the accuracy of 
information. 
</P>
<P>
Having reported the story, I felt a twinge of embarrassment, as did other 
reporters. Police officials were also taken aback because of the earlier 
statements from witnesses who claimed the dealers were firing the shots. 
</P>
<P>
Police and residents agree on this much: Beginning at about noon every day, 
bicycle-pedaling drug dealers, ranging in age from about 20 to as young as 13, 
cruise up and down the tree-lined street, eventually stopping to peddle their 
illicit wares. By nightfall, as many as 50 are working the same block, offering 
marijuana, cocaine and heroin to passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
Police also believe that the dealers had the street under their control; 
sitting on residents' cars and trucks, openly smoking marijuana and drinking 
beer, and taunting and threatening anyone who objected. 
</P>
<P>
That West Walnut Street was a haven for drug sales was clearly evident to me 
when I arrived in the neighborhood the day after the shooting to interview 
residents. As I spoke with them, young men identified by residents as drug 
dealers sauntered past on foot and on bicycle, staring at us defiantly and 
occasionally asking a sarcastic question. 
</P>
<P>
Salvador Villegas, a 45-year-old man who was involved in the fracas that led to 
the fatal shooting incident, said, as did several other neighbors, that he and 
a young dealer had gotten into an angry exchange of words and that a fistfight 
soon ensued involving a number of people on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
According to Villegas and the others, they chased the dealers out of the 
neighborhood, but the dealers promised to return. Within minutes, they did; 
armed with baseball bats, a pistol, rifle and shotguns, Villegas said. 
</P>
<P>
The early account was that Villegas and his neighbors then all ran inside their 
homes, locked the doors and called police. Only Morales was left outside, 
Villegas said, and was shot in the head by the dealers as he attempted to hurry 
to safety. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police later found, however, that two of Morales' neighbors fired the 
shots into the air to frighten off the dealers as they surrounded Morales, who 
was armed with a machete. 
</P>
<P>
A police officer explained that this sort of misinformation happens all the 
time in police investigations. 
</P>
<P>
"We can interview 10 different witnesses and get 10 different stories," Santa 
Ana Police Sgt. Dick Faust said. "You just have to keep digging and talking to 
people until finally you get the whole story." 
</P>
<P>
But a newspaper's daily deadline sometimes puts it in the position of having to 
accept the story of the moment. All we can do when we are steered wrong is to 
publish the truth when we get it.

FORMER SDSU PRESIDENT LOVE, 86, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Malcolm A. Love, who helped San Diego State College become a university and 
served as its president for 19 years, died Saturday afternoon in San Diego 
following a long illness. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
Love, a native of Iowa whose career in college administration took him to Ohio, 
Illinois, Colorado and Nevada, came to San Diego in 1952 to become the 
college's fourth president. When he retired in 1971, SDSU's enrollment and 
faculty had quintupled, its campus had gained several new buildings and its 
research funding, previously nonexistent, exceeded $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
"He guided the campus through some of its most difficult and important times," 
said SDSU president Thomas B. Day. "His actions created the personality of the 
campus as we know it today. He fostered good relations with the community. He 
nurtured the faculty. He respected and was respected by the students. He was a 
giant. We hang our head in prayer and sorrow at his loss." 
</P>
<P>
During Love's presidency, he reorganized the institution into colleges, 
creating colleges of engineering and of arts and sciences. He opened an 
Imperial Valley campus and ushered in the first joint doctoral degree program 
with the University of California. The first program, in chemistry, began in 
1965 with UC San Diego. A genetics program with UC Berkeley followed in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, a new five-story library opened on campus, bearing Love's name. 
Designed to hold one million volumes, the building contained more space than 
all the buildings of the original campus combined. 
</P>
<P>
Love is survived by his wife of nearly 63 years, the former Maude Hale, their 
daughter Joan Maher of San Diego, two grandchildren and two 
great-grandchildren. The family has asked that no services be held. They asked 
that expressions of sympathy take the form of contributions to the Malcolm A. 
Love Memorial Scholarship Fund, which is being established by the SDSU 
Scholarship Office.

WAY STATION FOR TRASH: IT'S AS GOOD AS CURBSIDE RECYCLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The scene resembles an outdoor factory. 
</P>
<P>
Big machines whir. Workers, in assembly-line formation, busily sort through 
mounds of trash, putting items on conveyor belts or into separate piles. 
</P>
<P>
And mechanized compactors neatly bind items into bundles for recycling. 
</P>
<P>
According to city officials, the scene shows how trash is being recycled in 
this city of 180,000 people, where residents are not asked to sort refuse 
before placing it on the curb. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're able to do here results in about the same percentage of recycling 
that results from curbside programs," said Stanley Tkaczyk, vice president of 
Rainbow Disposal Co. "We're taking about 5% of the total waste stream and 
recycling it, and a residential, curbside program of collecting recyclables 
also averages about 5% of the (total) waste." 
</P>
<P>
Rainbow Disposal handles all the city's collection. Because the company 
maintains a transfer station in the city -- something that most other county 
cities do not have -- all refuse gets picked over for recyclables before the 
mass is hauled off to a landfill. 
</P>
<P>
A transfer station is an interim stop between curbside and landfill. Smaller 
trucks bring in trash and dump it at the station. Machines and crews then comb 
through that waste, searching for aluminum, other metals and corrugated 
cardboard. The remaining debris is loaded aboard larger trucks and sent to a 
landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The recycling at Rainbow does not include glass and plastic. Company officials 
said the market for those items is too weak. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials said Rainbow's overall recycling program will be more than 
enough to meet a new state law that requires cities to cut back 25% on the 
waste now sent to landfills. That law goes into effect in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had this transfer station since 1983, and so for all those years we've 
been cutting back on what is sent to the landfill," said Tkaczyk, who added 
that the company will increase the amount of recyclable material in the next 2 
1/2 years, when expanded conveyors and trash sorters are installed. 
</P>
<P>
Trash collection in most other county cities does not involve an interim stop 
for recycling, mainly because the cities lack transfer stations. But six county 
cities recycle at curbside, requiring residents to sort their trash so glass 
bottles and jars, aluminum and tin cans, plastic containers, newspapers and 
cardboard are kept separate. 
</P>
<P>
Some environmentalists -- including Debbie Cook, spokeswoman for Save Our Parks 
-- have questioned why Huntington Beach does not do more to encourage curbside 
recycling. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because we have the present system doesn't mean we shouldn't experiment 
with other ways to recycle," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the city should try an experimental program at picking up old 
newspapers (at curbside) and recycling them." 
</P>
<P>
Cook noted that Rainbow has no program for newspaper recycling. 
</P>
<P>
Tkaczyk said newspaper and other increased recycling could be added by Rainbow, 
"but it would add to the cost." 
</P>
<P>
Recycling usually costs more in labor and other expenses than the amount 
realized from salvaged material, according to state and county solid-waste 
experts. Cities that have switched to curbside recycling have generally 
increased monthly trash fees to cover expenses. In Placentia, for instance, the 
City Council voted in February to start curbside recycling this summer -- and 
to increase the monthly trash rate from $7.53 to $9.99. 
</P>
<P>
"People think there's a lot of money to be made by recycling, but that's not 
the situation," Tkaczyk said. "The market is very low for most items. It's 
still cheaper for companies to make things from virgin products than it is to 
use recycled materials. The way to get better prices for recycled material is 
to create a bigger demand. If more people asked for products made of recycled 
goods, there would be a better market." 
</P>
<P>
Many Huntington Beach residents have expressed interest in recycling, in all 
its aspects. For instance, at last week's City Council meeting, a resident 
asked why the city has not begun curbside recycling. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Thomas J. Mays responded: "Our new contract with Rainbow Disposal calls 
for new equipment to be built at their on-site center. It's very costly to do 
(recycling) by the curbside method, compared to what we can do with modern 
equipment" at the Rainbow Disposal transfer site. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Wes Bannister later said the city will run into much higher costs if 
it tries curbside recycling. "We'd have to have more trucks," he said, noting 
that recyclables are kept separate from other trash. 
</P>
<P>
"This gets down to a monetary problem," he said. "Unfortunately, there's no 
market for collection of glass or paper, and I guess there's very little market 
for plastic." 
</P>
<P>
The cost of trash disposal nonetheless will probably be raised later this year, 
reflecting a significant rise in landfill costs, city officials said at a 
recent study session. 
</P>
<P>
But council members said an increase in trash fees would be even higher if the 
city started curbside recycling. 
</P>
<P>
"The nice thing is we don't need to go to curbside recycling, because we're 
getting such good recycling with the system we have," Mays said.

taking the remainder to a landfill. Company officials say the system is as 
effective as curbside programs, but some critics say Rainbow's system, which 
does not include glass or plastic, is limited. ROBERT LACHMAN / Los Angeles

MOTHER'S DAY: NO BUNDLE OF JOY FOR STEPMOTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When her stepson Christopher handed her the purple construction paper Mother's 
Day card he'd made in kindergarten Friday, Kathleen Matheson had to brace 
herself. "He said, 'I did it for Vickie. But you can read it.' 
</P>
<P>
"I had to get a hold of myself and be an adult and think, 'It's really true, 
he's really right. She is his mom,' " said Matheson of Irvine, who for two 
years has helped raise Christopher. Her husband, Mark, has custody; the boy's 
birth mother, Vickie, lives in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Mothers like Matheson deal with runny noses, PTAs, discipline and bedtime 
stories. But on Mother's Day, hardly anyone knows how or whether to recognize 
an increasingly common member of the family -- the stepmother. 
</P>
<P>
For the nation's estimated 4.3 million step-families -- in particular, those in 
which fathers have joint or sole custody -- Mother's Day serves only to 
highlight the strains, resentments and already divided loyalties between the 
"real" mother and the acting mother who isn't related. Many of them in fact 
wish Mother's Day would go away. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't want to have to deal with it," said David Juroe, a family 
counselor and former president of the Orange County Chapter of the Stepfamily 
Assn. of America, the only national support organization for step-families. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids just don't want to talk about it. It's too painful. They don't want to 
reveal what their true feelings are." 
</P>
<P>
Ignored stepmothers are hurt to the point of tears, or worse. Last year, one 
Orange County woman didn't speak to her stepson for a week after he spent 
Mother's Day with his biological mother and didn't even remember her with a 
card, Juroe said. This year, she decided to leave town. 
</P>
<P>
At one point in custody negotiations with his ex-wife, Heidi, Jonathan Kramer 
of Lake Forest proposed that their daughter spend alternate Mother's Days with 
her father and mother. He has since married a woman with a child and they have 
a child of their own. 
</P>
<P>
But Heidi Kramer of Oceanside said, "I would have a problem sharing our 
daughter on Mother's Day." Besides, Jonathan Kramer's attorney told them his 
legal chances of getting the girl on Mother's Day resembled those of a 
"snowball in hell," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas the fabled, evil stepmothers of fairy tales always stepped into a 
family after the good husband's wife had died, modern stepmothers are almost 
always the result of divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Rampant divorce and a 75% remarriage rate have created a step-family boom since 
the 1960s. Stepmothers have played an increasingly significant role in families 
in California, which pioneered the concept of joint custody after divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Using 1987 data, sociology researcher Paul C. Glick of Arizona State University 
at Tempe estimates that slightly more than 19% of all children under age 18 
live in step-families. But others believe the statistics are higher because the 
census counts children only once, and while they may be living with a single 
parent, they may also be included in the other parent's remarriage. In 
addition, the children may belong to two or more step-families as a result of 
repeated divorce and remarriage. 
</P>
<P>
Demographers expect the trend to continue and predict as many as 45% of all 
children born in the 1980s will experience divorce or separation before they 
reach 18. 
</P>
<P>
The Stepfamily Assn., headquartered in Lincoln, Neb., claims there will be more 
step-families than any other type of family -- such as first-married or 
single-parent -- in the United States by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't take a whole lot of market research to see the population was 
shifting," said Barbara Miller, product spokesperson for the Kansas City-based 
Hallmark Cards. Since the early 1980s, the company has been producing Mother's 
Day cards appropriate for stepmothers. "People look for them. They're now aware 
we make them specifically," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people don't like the term stepmother, so we do some that say: 'to 
someone who's been like a mother to me,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
One for younger children asks, "How did a kid like me wind up with a step mom 
like you?" and answers inside: "Just lucky, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Father's Day card buyers, Mother's Day card customers don't like even 
mild joking, she said. A typical stepmother message is serious: "Thank you for 
being there and for giving me so many reasons to care about you too." 
</P>
<P>
The difficulty with most step-families stems from unrealistic images of fantasy 
"Brady Bunch" families, happily walking on beaches all holding hands, according 
to family therapists. 
</P>
<P>
Parents and step-parents have completely different feelings about a child whom 
one has known from birth and the other has just met, said Emily Visher, a 
Lafayette-based therapist and author who co-founded the Stepfamily Assn. with 
her husband John, a psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
In general, step-families have more problems when the children are over 9 or 
10, when the stepmother hasn't had children before, if she is substantially 
younger than the children's birth parents, if the ex-spouses are still fighting 
or if the ex-wife hasn't remarried. 
</P>
<P>
Stepmothers have particular difficulties with stepdaughters, Visher said, 
possibly because of competition for their father's attention or loyalty 
conflicts with their own mothers. 
</P>
<P>
"The difficulty in our society comes because, for so long, we've had this ideal 
in our head of first-marriage families," Visher said. "We think of just two 
parents. We think there's not enough love to go around for more than two." 
</P>
<P>
Mother's Days, and other days, will go more smoothly if parents recognize and 
teach their children that "love is not a finite amount," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Many older stepchildren, looking back on their childhood, say: " 'I was really 
lucky. I had four adults to love me,' " said Visher. 
</P>
<P>
Lacking that, the next best thing, most agree, is a special day set aside for 
stepmothers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
That's why Juroe proposed Stepparents Day, which Gov. George Deukmejian signed 
into law in 1984. Held on the first Sunday of October, it has been slow to 
catch on, even for children of the experts. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of my children are beginning to get the word about Stepparents Day," said 
Visher, who raised eight children, four of them from her husband's previous 
marriage. "It took a number of years, but eventually I got acknowledged by my 
stepchildren as well as my biological children."

JUST IN TIME FOR ORANGEWOOD'S CHILDREN; 
</P>
<P>
HOME'S DIRECTORS CHANGE SOME PROCEDURES FOR CONTROLLING THE TROUBLED YOUNGSTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The decision by directors of the Orangewood Children's Home in Orange to change 
some procedures used by counselors to control the shelter's children was as 
timely as could be. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Juvenile Justice Commission has been investigating reports 
that youngsters at the facility for abused, neglected and abandoned children 
have been mistreated. Those are serious accusations, but Orangewood -- a 
5-year-old shelter opened to ease overcrowding at the previous county home for 
dependent children -- has had a good reputation despite its own well-publicized 
problems with overcrowding, which have plagued the facility almost from the 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
But one inevitable problem for such a place dealing with troubled youngsters is 
that there is inevitably going to be a fine line between the need for special 
rules and regulations and disciplinary action that goes too far. 
</P>
<P>
Orangewood director Robert Theemling says the changes are intended to make the 
shelter's rules understandable and are not intended as reactions to criticism 
that the system is too strict. However, there can be little doubt that the 
attention focused on the disciplinary situation at the facility offers a strong 
incentive to clarify the ground rules, for the benefit of everyone associated 
with Orangewood. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the commission's findings are scheduled to be submitted soon to 
Presiding Juvenile Court Judge C. Robert Jameson. Orangewood officials have 
denied the allegations, which are being reviewed by the Orange County Grand 
Jury. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the commission report concludes about allegations of verbal, physical 
and mental abuse, and whatever the timing of the effort to improve procedures, 
the commitment of the facility to ensure that its procedures makes sense -- and 
are perceived by staff members and children as fair -- has to be viewed as a 
positive step. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, there have been complaints asserting that a rule book for 
adolescent girls is harsh, even cruel. 
</P>
<P>
The facility's rules have some prestigious defenders, but it will not hurt to 
review existing procedures to make them clearer and unquestionably fair. 
</P>
<P>
Experts are quick to point out that children in a facility such as Orangewood 
need a highly structured environment. What the institution's experience points 
up is how fine is the tightrope that staff members must walk between providing 
predictable boundaries, which might be good, and overly rigid rules. 
</P>
<P>
Orangewood has taken a step to strike a fair balance.

JUST TAKE HIM OUT TO THE BALLGAME; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: TOM WERNER IS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL MEN IN THE TV INDUSTRY, AND 
SOON HE WILL BECOME CHAIRMAN AND MANAGING PARTNER OF THE PADRES. BUT HE'S JUST 
A KID AT HEART.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They wanted to do something special for him. It was his 40th birthday, a time 
in life when a man's supposed to let go of youth and saunter into middle-age. 
They decided to have a night that would kick off the rest of his life in style. 
</P>
<P>
So his wife and friends racked their brains, trying to come up with the perfect 
party. He's worth millions, so money was going to be no problem. They could 
have as elegant a party as they desired, or have the most raucous party 
Hollywood has seen in a while. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, the size, should it be a huge party with invitations to all of 
Tom's friends and acquaintances, maybe a bash for 500? No, his wife, Jill, 
said, Tom doesn't like big parties. 
</P>
<P>
OK, how about a small ritzy party in a ballroom at some Beverly Hills hotel? 
No, sorry, Jill said, Tom doesn't like to get dressed up. 
</P>
<P>
All right, how about renting a few limousines, and just bopping around town to 
a restaurant, followed by a nightclub or two? No, Jill said, you know how Tom 
doesn't like to make a scene in public. 
</P>
<P>
Charter a plane and head for Las Vegas? Nope. 
</P>
<P>
So just what kind of party did they end up throwing for this guy? 
</P>
<P>
"Can you believe it," said Paul Schulman, one of his best friends, "we ended up 
going to the UCLA bowling alley. We rented it out for the night, and had about 
30, 35 people. We sang 'Happy Birthday' and 'Take me out to the ballgame.' He 
had the time of his life." 
</P>
<P>
Are you insinuating that Tom Werner, the man who soon officially will become 
the chairman and managing partner of the Padres, the man who has made millions 
by being one of the most successful producers in the TV industry and helped 
create the Cliff Huxtable family, would actually enjoy something so hokey? 
</P>
<P>
"Hey," Schulman said, "this guy would prefer spending his Thursday nights 
watching a ballgame on TV than going to the Emmy Awards. You don't see him 
shopping at Gucci or wearing Giorgio (Armani), hanging around with the stars, 
or any of that kind of stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd never know from talking to him about the type of wealth he has, the type 
of talent he has, or anything like that. He's one of the most unpretentious men 
you'll ever meet. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why you hardly ever see him attend Hollywood-type functions, because he 
hates them." 
</P>
<P>
So when Werner and his nine partners are approved by Major League Baseball -- 
which according to sources on the ownership screening committee could be within 
two weeks -- don't bother looking for a guy dressed in a pinstripe suit coming 
out of a stretch limousine. 
</P>
<P>
He'll be the guy wearing the sweatshirt, coming out of a two-year-old Ford 
Mustang convertible, holding a pennant in his hand. 
</P>
<P>
Yes sir, if you want a baseball fan running your club, you've got one. 
</P>
<P>
OK, so he has been a Dodger fan for the past 20 years, and was a Yankee fan 
growing up. Don't hold it against him. Just wait, pretty soon he'll be getting 
into that Padre spirit and hating Dodger blue. 
</P>
<P>
Just talk to the folks at Carsey-Werner Co., the top independent television 
production company in the industry, and they'll tell you just how much Werner 
cares about the Padres. Sure, he's still busily producing "The Cosby Show," 
"Roseanne," "A Different World" and "Grand." And everyone will tell you how 
this is the busiest time of year in the business, a time in which senior 
executives frantically are screening pilots, with the networks just a week away 
from announcing their fall lineups. 
</P>
<P>
So what's Werner doing? 
</P>
<P>
Sneaking away and tuning in Padre games on his short-wave radio, and acting 
like a school kid all over again every time the Padres win or lose. 
</P>
<P>
"You should see us, we're wearing our San Diego Padre caps in the office now," 
said Marcy Carsey, 44, Werner's partner in the company. "I never even cared 
about sports before. I couldn't even tell you the names of any baseball 
players. But now, for the first time in my life, I'm reading the sports pages, 
listening to sports reports, and everything." 
</P>
<P>
Is the Padre schedule hanging on the office wall, too? 
</P>
<P>
"No, there's no need for that," Carsey said, "we've all got it memorized by 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, all of Werner's friends knew just how much he adored the game of 
baseball. After all, the man doesn't have a bat and glove in his closet, play 
on a softball team while mixing in an occasional hardball game, help coach his 
14-year-old son's Little League team, regularly attend his 11-year-old 
daughter's softball games, participate in rotisserie leagues, and own Dodger 
season tickets for the past 10 years, without being fanatical about the game. 
</P>
<P>
But it caught all of them by surprise when they found out he was planning to 
lead a group of 10 men willing to spend $75 million to buy the Padres from Joan 
Kroc. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was the kinkiest thing I'd heard in months," Carsey said. "There 
were a lot of people trying to talk him out of it, but then again, a lot of 
people tried to talk us out of going off to start our own production company, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom gave me all of the reasons on the negative side, and then he gave me all 
of the reasons on the positive side. My advice to him was, 'Chance-taking is 
the stuff of life, and you're rooting for the positive side, so go and do it.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Now, six months after Werner began seriously inquiring about purchasing the 
Padres, and six weeks after learning that Kroc had accepted his group's offer, 
his lifelong dream is about to become reality. 
</P>
<P>
Werner and nine partners met with Kroc and attorney Beth Benes again last 
Monday, and now are just waiting for the completion of financial reports to 
finalize the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"What I understand, everything is just fine," said Milwaukee Brewer owner Bud 
Selig, who's on the ownership screening committee. "I'd be stunned if this 
wasn't approved. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody's really looking forward to his involvement. I haven't met 
the gentleman yet, but all I keep hearing is what a wonderful guy he is." 
</P>
<P>
Werner already has begun delegating authority to members of his group, and 
several planning meetings have taken place, with the latest this past 
Wednesday, but he continues to seek input from his partners. 
</P>
<P>
Werner couldn't care less that he has invested the most money in the group -- 
about $25 million of his net worth of an estimated $150 million -- and that 
several of the partners have limited shares. Everyone's an equal partner, he 
tells them, the only difference being that he has the final say. 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing in his background that reveals any baseball expertise -- unless 
you count his intramural playing days at Harvard -- but those who know him say 
he's quite confident in his abilities to run a major league franchise. And he 
doesn't need any of Kroc's former son-in-laws to help him. 
</P>
<P>
Werner, in fact, already has decided, according to four members of the 
ownership group, that he will not retain Jerry Kapstein. Kapstein was in charge 
of the club's operations for several months while it was being sold, but left 
the position three weeks ago when Kroc's daughter, Linda Smith, filed for 
divorce from him. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Werner has told friends that he will retain President Dick Freeman, 
and does not plan to make any front-office changes for at least the remainder 
of this season. 
</P>
<P>
Werner knows that several decisions will soon have to be made: Will Manager 
Jack McKeon, who assumed the role of vice president/baseball operations at 
Kroc's request in December, be provided a dual contract, leave the field and 
become the club's top front-office executive, or remain simply as manager? Will 
he attempt to sign first baseman Jack Clark, catcher Benito Santiago and second 
baseman Roberto Alomar to multi-year contracts, avoiding arbitration? Will he 
rip up outfielder Tony Gwynn's contract, and pay him the going-market rate? 
Will he put beer back in the clubhouse? 
</P>
<P>
Those decisions simply will have to wait, and likely will not be made until the 
end of the season. In the meantime, his wife already has been to San Diego 
several times on several house-hunting excursions, an office is being prepared 
for the ownership group at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, and operating plans 
quietly are being made. 
</P>
<P>
The hardest part now is just the wait. Werner knows he's about to become 
chairman of the Padres, and he has been told to expect ratification by the 
major league owners at the end of the month in a conference call. But yet, he's 
still not owner, and until he is, he won't allow himself to be interviewed by 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
After all, it was just three years ago when it was announced the Padres were to 
be sold to George Argyros, and five months ago when Sid and Jenny Craig told 
friends that they would be the new owners. 
</P>
<P>
"He just wants to be very careful right now," said a family friend, who spoke 
only on the condition of anonymity. "He doesn't want to say anything that could 
be misconstrued. But I can't tell you how excited he is." 
</P>
<P>
Well, the boys in the ownership group already are getting the picture. 
</P>
<P>
"It was during the last home stand when I got a call at about 9:30 one night," 
said attorney Scott Wolfe, one of the partners who lives in San Diego. "It was 
Tom. It was 12:30 New York time, but he wanted to know what was going on in the 
game. I told him the score, and that we were losing. You know what? He stayed 
on the phone the rest of the game, and I was giving him play-by-play. 
</P>
<P>
"He's taking these games pretty hard, I know. Jill, his wife, keeps telling 
him, 'Tom, there's 162 games, you can't win all of them.' But I think we're all 
going through the same stage right now. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom's a very intense man, very intense. We don't want him to get a heart 
attack over these games." 
</P>
<P>
It's this same intensity, and desire to excel, however, that has helped Werner 
become one of the most successful businessmen in the TV industry. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't enough, his friends say, that he graduated cum laude in 1971 from 
Harvard. It wasn't enough that he began producing award-winning documentaries 
early in his career such as "Shirley Chisholm: Pursuing the Dream." It wasn't 
enough that he had a meteoric rise through ABC, ultimately becoming senior vice 
president at the network. And now, as we're finding out, it's not enough to be 
the hottest TV producer in television, who with partner Carsey, just sold 
syndicated Cosby reruns for a reported record price of $515 million. 
</P>
<P>
No sir, Werner wants to be one of the best baseball owners in the business, 
too, providing the community of San Diego the National League's version of the 
Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
"He definitely wants that franchise to be of championship caliber," Schulman 
said. "It's definitely going to benefit with his involvement. He's going to run 
it like a business, and you can see how his own business has done. 
</P>
<P>
"I know he's a little worried with the way salaries are going up. He can live 
with the Jack Clarks and Joe Carters making $2 and $3 million, but what bothers 
him is that the average ball player is making so much money." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, Werner's friends say, if he just was interested in making money, he 
sure wouldn't be investing in a baseball team. The Padres, according to 
sources, made $4.2 million last year, but because of rising salaries and 
escalating expenses, the Padres have estimated that a 2.5 million attendance 
base is needed to break even in 1990. The Padres will receive about $15.2 
million in national and local broadcasting revenues, but their player payroll, 
according to sources, is about $17.5 million, with an overall operating budget 
of about $34 million. 
</P>
<P>
It's unknown just how much the new ownership group will have to pay in 
collusion damages, or if the purchase price requires Kroc to pay the fines. But 
they should receive about $12.5 million within the next two years when the 
National League expands by two teams. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing to Tom, and to all of us," said Art Rivkin, who'll be one of 
three vice-chairmans, "is to run a first-class operation and to continue to 
improve it. There's a lot of civic participation involved, and we want to make 
it a team that this community will be proud of. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we'll do that, and pick up where Mrs. Kroc left off." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, if not for Werner's involvement, members of the ownership group say, they 
likely never would have purchased the team. The eight-member San Diego group 
had qualified under Kroc's guidelines for purchasing the team, just as Werner 
and partner Russell Goldsmith of Los Angeles had. But if not for the link 
between the two groups, the club likely would be sold to Los Angeles King owner 
Bruce McNall, who turned down an invitation by Werner to join his group, or 
some other entity. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a perfect match," Wolfe said. "He was looking for a very strong local 
group, and a group willing to invest and share in the ownership. We were 
looking for a managing partner. It wasn't necessarily the money, but nobody 
wanted to do this alone, without having someone designated to run it." 
</P>
<P>
Still, there was skepticism. Lots of it. It was bad enough that this guy was 
from Los Angeles, but being in the Hollywood business, Werner represented 
everything they disdain about the city. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, there was initial concern," said Art Engel, vice-chairman, who was the 
first of the San Diego group to meet Werner. "What we didn't want to happen was 
absentee ownership. And we didn't want any Hollywood flair using this as a 
springboard for something else." 
</P>
<P>
Said Wolfe: "Right away, we could tell he was different from the typical 
Hollywood type. He wasn't showy. He wasn't some big self-promoter. He just 
wasn't what we thought he'd be. He was very down-to-earth, very honest, and 
very concerned about our community. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to be said that we sold out to L.A., and we sure didn't want 
this to be another Al Davis situation. 
</P>
<P>
"By the end of our first meeting, we were in love with the guy. We couldn't 
have picked anyone better." 
</P>
<P>
In February, Wolfe approached Kapstein and Kroc, telling them that the two 
groups were merging. Within six weeks, they had a deal. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole transaction kept Tommy pretty busy," one friend said, "but he really 
wasn't that nervous about it. If someone came in with a bid a lot larger than 
his, he thought, so be it, that was the way it was meant to be. He just didn't 
want to lose out to someone whose offer was relatively close to his." 
</P>
<P>
The original offer, according to one of the prospective owners, was less than 
$60 million. Yet, although sources say Kroc and Benes were willing to accept 
the offer, Kapstein kept holding out for more, until they reached the $75 
million purchase price -- $25 million less than Kapstein originally sought. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny, we've known each other about 22 years," said Goldsmith, who's 
chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Republic Pictures Corp,. 
and director of City National Bank, "but we never even thought something like 
this was possible until a couple of years ago. The more we talked about it, the 
more we thought it was a good idea. And when we found out that the Padres were 
up for sale, we thought it was perfect; a great city, a great franchise, and a 
National League team. It was everything we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Werner discussed the idea with his wife and friends for weeks, soliciting their 
opinions. Most of them told Werner he was crazy. Think of the headaches, they 
said. Think of the time. Think of the risk. 
</P>
<P>
Funny, that's exactly what his friends told him nine years ago when he left a 
lucrative job with ABC to join Carsey. They took second mortgages on their 
homes. Their office consisted of a room atop a 7-Eleven store in Westwood. 
Phone bills often were paid late. 
</P>
<P>
They struggled at the outset, producing a series called, "Oh, Madeline,!" which 
soon was cancelled by ABC, and a TV movie called "Single Bars, Single Women," 
which also flopped. 
</P>
<P>
Then, they were introduced to Bill Cosby. He told them how he wanted to create 
a half-hour comedy casting himself as a janitor and his TV wife as a 
construction worker. Carsey and Werner said no, and proposed that Cosby be the 
head of an upper middle-class family, and do away with the stereotypical black 
family. 
</P>
<P>
They offered the show to ABC, and were turned down. "They told us comedy was 
dead," Carsey said. They offered it to NBC. They took it, and in large part 
because of "The Cosby Show," have become the top-rated network in the land. 
</P>
<P>
Werner and Carsey since have produced "Roseanne," "A Different World" and 
"Grand." They're all top 20 shows, with Cosby, Roseanne and Different World 
finishing 1-2-3 last season. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why Tom's very confident he can make this work," said an employee of 
Carsey-Werner. "He knows what kind of quality people want, and he definitely 
knows audiences. He knows he has a tremendous challenge, but like he always 
says, 'No guts, no glory.' 
</P>
<P>
"He's already told us, he plans to make the Padres the best organization in 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Hmm, so Werner should be one proud man standing in the owners' box night after 
night? 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth," Schulman said, "I can't see him sitting up there. 
He'll be down in the stands with his popcorn and coke, yelling like everyone 
else." 
</P>

BLYLEVEN RIPS ANGEL HITTERS AFTER LOSING;

RED SOX.

Bert Blyleven didn't care about losing friends Saturday when he lashed out at 
the Angels' offensive failings. What he cares about is winning games, and 
neither the 39-year-old right-hander nor the Angels have won many this season. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven's condemnation of his team after the Angels' 7-1 loss to the Red Sox 
was born of frustration and a month of pitching with no margin for error. 
Although he gave up only three runs, Blyleven (1-3) he said he felt defeated as 
soon as he yielded one run because of the Angels' continued inability to 
produce. 
</P>
<P>
"You go out there and it's 0-0 after five (innings), and they score two runs 
and you feel like you've already lost," he said. "You're going through the 
motions after that. 
</P>
<P>
"Our offense is just not playing aggressive. We . . . We stink. As a pitcher 
you just go out and try to keep your team in the game, but you expect your 
teammates to help. I'm speaking for the whole pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care what the offense thinks. Our offense stinks. And until that 
changes, we're just going to continue our downhill slide." 
</P>
<P>
That slide that has dropped them into a virtual tie for last in the AL West 
Division reached four consecutive games Saturday before a season-high crowd of 
50,755. Boston starter Greg Harris (4-1) gave up four hits over seven innings. 
The Angels' run resulted from Chili Davis' fly ball that a diving Tom Brunansky 
missed for a triple and a sacrifice fly by Dante Bichette in the seventh inning 
to make it 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven didn't absolve himself of blame. He has given up 51 hits in 38 innings 
and has a 5.21 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my fault, too," he said. "I should have gone out and pitched a shutout 
and hoped for a tie. . . . I've pitched 60 career shutouts. I've never felt 
before that I had to pitch a shutout until now. Until that changes, it puts too 
much pressure on the pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
"You just try to do the best you can. You just expect help, that's all. 'Til 
things change, we're going to get four or five hits a game and that stinks. I 
spent five years in Cleveland, and we finished last every year but we had fun. 
I'm not having fun. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have to do, I don't know. I'm one out of 25 (players). I'm tired of 
losing, and until everybody gets tired of losing we're going to keep losing. 
We've got a good pitching staff, and when you make a mistake, you can't feel 
you're out of the game." 
</P>
<P>
The only way to win, he said, is to make no mistakes at all. "When was the last 
game we won? The shutout (Chuck) Finley pitched?" Blyleven said, referring to 
Finley's 6-0 victory over Baltimore last Tuesday. "That proves my point right 
there." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' loss Saturday -- their 18th in their past 24 games, eighth in their 
past nine at Anaheim Stadium and ninth in their past 10 overall -- was far from 
error-free. Luis Polonia misplayed an apparently harmless single to left field 
in the eighth inning by Brunansky, which scored Boston's fourth run and 
effectively put the game away. Johnny Ray wasn't in position to play three 
fifth-inning grounders that contributed to Boston's two-run inning. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Manager Doug Rader faulted Blyleven for his pitch location, saying he was 
getting the ball up, but Blyleven believes the problem is located in the Angel 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
The sixth through ninth hitters in Boston's batting order were a combined nine 
for 15 with four RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels have five runs in their last three games. They are next to last in 
the American League in scoring and team batting average. 
</P>
<P>
"The offense is going through the motions," Blyleven said. "You make one 
mistake as a pitcher and you've lost the game. We won on pitching and defense 
last year and also on timely hitting. We're not getting any hitting. When was 
the last time we scored seven, eight, nine runs like everybody else? 
</P>
<P>
"I've got too much pride to be on a (terrible) ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
Bichette, the only Angel producing consistently, also acknowledged that the 
burden of losing was weighing heavily on him. 
</P>
<P>
"You can almost feel the pressure building," he said. "You've got to go out and 
practice so much that it's almost instinct." 
</P>
<P>
The trick is to avoid letting losing become instinctive. "You can almost get 
into a groove like that where you don't have confidence," Bichette said. 
"You've got to keep your confidence, tough as it is. Confidence is 90% of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"It just bothers me to go out and look so bad. Getting beat's one thing, but 
going out there and beating yourself, that's not professional baseball. You do 
your job and get beat, that's professional baseball. Not this." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
To fill the roster spot left open by Mike Witt's departure, the Angels recalled 
left-handed reliever Cliff Young from triple-A Edmonton. Young was 2-1 with a 
2.45 earned-run average in nine appearances, all in relief. "He's throwing the 
ball over the plate the best, so we felt he was the right guy (to promote)," 
Manager Doug Rader said of Young, who relies on his sinker and changeup. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Fraser, sent to Edmonton April 30 when rosters went from 27 to 25, will 
make his third start for the Trappers today. Rader said Fraser has pitched 
well. . . . Reliever Greg Minton's recovery from elbow surgery last month is 
being delayed by problems relating to the bone spur that was removed. "(Dr. 
Lewis Yocum) had to split the muscle to chip off the spur, and that's the only 
thing that's left before I can throw again," Minton said. "The pain has gone 
away everywhere else." The repair was the third for Minton, who joked that it 
was the "50,000-pitch tuneup" he would need every three years if he continues 
pitching. But he's willing to keep going. "As long as they supply me with 
Vaseline, I'll go out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Red Sox starter Greg Harris is a right-hander, but he has experimented with 
throwing left-handed and wears a glove that's adaptable to throwing with either 
hand. Harris supposedly can throw 82 m.p.h. left-handed. . . . The 11-19 record 
the Angels took into Saturday's game equaled their slowest start in club 
history. They had identical records in 1961, '69, '72, '76 and '88. The 12-game 
deficit they had before Oakland lost to Baltimore was their largest after 30 
games in franchise history.

ARE FORFEITS THE ANSWER?;

<P>
PREP SPORTS: THE PUNISHMENT FOR USING AN INELIGIBLE ATHLETE CAN VARY FROM STATE 
TO STATE.

News item: 
</P>
<P>
 ANAHEIM -- Savanna High School's baseball team forfeited four victories for 
using an ineligible player who did not live within the school's attendance 
boundaries. Savanna Principal William Wong said the student, a relief pitcher, 
had used a false address since elementary school in order to attend school with 
his friends. "It's very cut and dried," Wong said. "When you use an ineligible 
player, you forfeit the games." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone agrees. There must be rules to prevent ineligible students from 
playing high school sports. 
</P>
<P>
But when an ineligible student plays, what should be done? Should the student 
be punished? Should the team? In every case? 
</P>
<P>
In most of California and in 39 other states and the District of Columbia, 
punishment is virtually automatic: Games are forfeited. 
</P>
<P>
The repercussions can be devastating. Championships can be voided and playoff 
berths lost. 
</P>
<P>
In these cases, it does not matter whether the ineligible player participated 
as a result of a clerical error, an administrative oversight or outright 
deception. If the student played, the team forfeits. Period. 
</P>
<P>
But a Times survey shows that in 11 other states and even in parts of 
California, forfeits are not necessarily automatic. 
</P>
<P>
In these places, some officials reason that innocent teammates should not 
suffer for the transgressions of a few and that there should be a more 
equitable solution. 
</P>
<P>
"If you forfeit their contest, you are in essence punishing the rest of the 
kids," said Ed Nash, executive secretary of the Alaska School Activities Assn., 
where forfeiture is an option, but not automatic. 
</P>
<P>
"If there are circumstances beyond the control of the school, such as (being) 
provided inaccurate information from another school where (the student) 
transferred from . . . then it's usually just a punishment on the student who 
was ineligible," Nash said of the Alaskan policy. "We don't feel the school can 
be held responsible if (school officials) have diligently tried to obtain the 
information." 
</P>
<P>
But innocent teammates are not the only victims of circumstance when an 
ineligible student plays. 
</P>
<P>
"The innocent kids on the other team are affected, too," said Thomas Byrnes, 
commissioner of the California Interscholastic Federation, which governs high 
school sports in the state. "The team you are playing against gets hurt 
(because it is placed at an unfair disadvantage) when you play an ineligible 
athlete." There was no shortage of innocent victims in the case of David Roman. 
</P>
<P>
No one suggested that the 17-year-old Huntington Beach football player did 
anything wrong on purpose. Nevertheless, when the regular season ended in 
November, a routine check found that Roman had been ineligible all year. 
</P>
<P>
Although he had transferred from Maryland and resided within the school's 
boundaries, Roman was living with his older brother and not his legal guardian, 
as the rules require. His mother was still in Maryland, trying to sell their 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Roman said he thought that his brother satisfied the role of guardian. 
Moreover, it was entirely accidental -- a clerical oversight -- that Roman's 
ineligibility wasn't discovered before the season, which would have prevented 
the problem, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the rule is clear. Accident or not, Huntington Beach had to 
forfeit every game in which Roman played. 
</P>
<P>
Overnight, the Oilers, who had an 8-2 record, went from Sunset League champs, 
qualifying for the Southern Section Division I playoffs, to an 0-10 team that 
finished in last place and was disqualified from postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
Even a flurry of court actions by angry boosters was not enough to overturn the 
ineligibility ruling. 
</P>
<P>
To many in Huntington Beach, it seemed as if everyone had lost -- the eligible 
and deserving athletes, their parents and fellow students, along with the 
unintentional rule-breaker. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly six months later, at least one Huntington Beach football player still 
wears a T-shirt proclaiming his school, "The Real Sunset League Champs." 
</P>
<P>
"The members of this football team are being asked to pay a terrible penalty 
for a minor clerical error on the part of an administrator," said Huntington 
Beach parent, Carolyn Jenkin, who complained after it was disclosed that school 
personnel were responsible for erroneously listing Roman as eligible. "After 
all is said and done, what we seem to be left with is a triumph of rules over 
justice." 
</P>
<P>
But in the view of CIF Commissioner Byrnes: "We don't do anything that isn't 
just in the CIF." 
</P>
<P>
Whether it's justice or injustice, most schools take the same approach in 
penalizing teams that break the rules, even inadvertently. 
</P>
<P>
In eight of the state's 10 sections, forfeits are the standard penalty when 
ineligible athletes play. 
</P>
<P>
There are 11 state associations that operate differently, reserving the right 
to impose a forfeit, although it is not necessarily the first option. These 
associations, which govern high school athletics in such states as Washington, 
Illinois and Alaska, permit officials' discretion on a case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the Illinois High School Assn. may issue a warning, followed by 
censure, reprimand or probation. And the Kentucky High School Athletic Assn.'s 
rules require the game to be forfeited, unless it is a playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you get into tournament play you can't replay or move a team up so . . . 
we do not require forfeitures . . . because you can't unscramble an egg," 
Kentucky Commissioner Tom Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
In other states where forfeits are not necessarily automatic, associations 
impose measures such as fines, probation or simply discipline the student 
rather than his team. 
</P>
<P>
"The feeling is that the punishment should fit the crime," said Idaho High 
School Activities Assn. Executive Director Bill Young. "Sometimes it is really 
no one's fault. It might have been a computer error." 
</P>
<P>
If there is no intention to circumvent the rules, no one should suffer, Young 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Byrnes disagreed. He says forfeits are appropriate penalties, regardless of 
whether playing the ineligible student was intentional, because the athlete may 
have made a difference in the outcome of a game. 
</P>
<P>
But how about cases in which the player clearly made no difference? 
</P>
<P>
"Subjectivity . . . is the difficult part," said Tom Triggs, principal of La 
Habra High School and a member of the Southern Section executive committee. 
"When do you say 'Yes', and when do you say 'No'?" 
</P>
<P>
Two state sections have tried to address those questions. 
</P>
<P>
In the North Coast Section, which includes 144 schools in the Diablo area, a 
forfeit may be set aside when the player's contribution was negligible, said 
Commissioner Paul Gaddini. 
</P>
<P>
If, for example, an ineligible player entered a game in the last 12 seconds 
with his team ahead by 40 points, it is clear he had no effect on the outcome, 
Gaddini said. 
</P>
<P>
"It can be argued reasonably well that the team that lost did not lose because 
of the substitute," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not trying to mollify feelings with this rule. It is not an attempt to 
have a compromise or to mediate. 
</P>
<P>
"All we are trying to do is get to the highest level of justice." 
</P>
<P>
However, Gaddini said, if the ineligible athlete played eight minutes in a game 
with a closer score, it would be difficult to prove that he had no effect on 
the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
North Coast Section rules allow a forfeit to be set aside when it is "beyond 
reasonable doubt that the team using the ineligible player would have won the 
contest regardless of the participation of the ineligible player." 
</P>
<P>
The burden of proof is on the team requesting the waiver. The opinions of the 
other school's coach and administrators also are sought. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the North Coast Section took a more liberal approach. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to have a broader (rule) and were a little unhappy with some of the 
results," Gaddini said. "In previous years under our old rule, we had games in 
which ineligible players participated that the forfeiture was waived" based on 
mitigating circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"In a couple cases the general feeling was (the forfeit) was incorrectly 
waived." 
</P>
<P>
Officials decided to tighten the procedure, but maintain discretion by using 
the "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard, Gaddini said. 
</P>
<P>
This year in the Northern Section, which includes 67 schools in the Chico area, 
officials also opted for an alternative to automatic forfeiture "to make the 
penalty fit the crime," said Commissioner Darold Adamson. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives the league principals some discretion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A student at Oroville High School played on the football team, but because of 
an oversight, he did not meet residency requirements. The violation was 
unintentional, Adamson said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of forcing Oroville to forfeit, the school was required "to develop a 
plan for monitoring students and present it to the league for the winter season 
(and be) placed on probation for two years," Adamson said. 
</P>
<P>
The residency problem arose after the student's parents divorced. He moved in 
with his grandmother in January, but did not participate in athletics that 
school year, Adamson said. The student's and grandparents' last names were the 
same, so the following fall when he went out for football no one realized he 
was not living with his parents. 
</P>
<P>
As is the case with most students discovered to be ineligible because of 
residency, it was school officials who found the problem and brought it to the 
league's attention. Moreover, the student's grandparents had brought the issue 
to the attention of the school -- an indication no one had attempted anything 
deceptive, Adamson said. 
</P>
<P>
Had the ineligibility been noticed before the season, a hardship waiver might 
have been granted to allow the student to play, Adamson said. As it turned out, 
the student was granted a retroactive hardship waiver and permitted to play the 
team's remaining two games. 
</P>
<P>
The rule that permitted this discretion is a league rule, not a rule of the 
Northern Section or the CIF. In fact, the Northern Section has no provisions 
for forfeits in its constitution, leaving those decisions to its individual 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"That league had implemented a series of penalties and put them in their 
constitution the preceding year," Adamson said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, forfeits are the preferred penalty in most sections, including the 
Southern Section, which encompasses Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Byrnes conceded that if the ineligible player played the last eight seconds of 
a 53-0 football game he would not affect the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Byrnes maintains that forfeits are necessary because it is 
impossible to determine how such an occurence would affect the course of a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"But if he played in the first eight seconds even though it ended 53-0, who is 
to say what effect he may have had?" Byrnes said. "He may have made a tackle 
and accidentally given another kid a charley horse. 
</P>
<P>
"Once he's played, he's had an effect on that game. It set into momentum 
certain forces. That game will never be the same because he played." 
</P>
<P>
In the San Diego Section, Commissioner Kendall Webb said officials don't split 
hairs. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't say whether it's appropriate or not," Webb said. "We just say if you 
use (an ineligible player) you forfeit the contest." 
</P>
<P>
"A kid who is a fourth-stringer and his team is leading 49-0 . . . and he goes 
in, his coach has to forfeit the game (and) every contest that athlete has 
participated in while ineligible." 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Webb said, "at what point do you say he didn't contribute that much? 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe on defense he wouldn't have blocked two conversions. There's no way to 
accurately say at what point this person's contribution was such that we would 
have to give victory to the other team. The only way to do it is to say . . . 
all or nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Those can be painful words. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, Bakersfield High won the Valley League football championship in 
the Central Section. One student, later determined to have been ineligible 
because of poor grades, played a cumulative five minutes in eight games. As a 
result, the team forfeited eight victories and had its league championship 
taken away. 
</P>
<P>
"We discussed a lot of things," recalled Central Section Commissioner Merritt 
Gilbert. "But where do you draw the line? This kid probably had no bearing (on 
the games' outcome), but I don't know how to draw it." 
</P>
<P>
In the 476-school Southern Section, Huntington Beach was not the only team to 
lose a playoff berth this school year because of an ineligible athlete. Savanna 
also was booted out of the football playoffs and forfeited six victories for a 
similar offense. 
</P>
<P>
And in the Sac-Joaquin Section, McClatchy also had to forfeit games because of 
an ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
But that case was overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody was more surprised than I," said Sac-Joaquin Section Commissioner 
Clarke Coover. 
</P>
<P>
Coover initially ruled a player ineligible because both of his parents had not 
moved with the student within the school's boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Residency is required of both parents because "it would be very easy for Papa 
to go over to get an apartment in another school district (to establish 
residency) for football season and after football season to move back," Coover 
said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Sac-Joaquin Section's appeals committee, consisting of three 
principals, reinstated the student and all the forfeited games. 
</P>
<P>
Although only the student and his father had moved within the school's 
attendance area, the committee, after investigation, felt that school officials 
had no way of knowing that the parents were having marital difficulties and 
that the mother remained at her home outside the boundaries, Coover said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee reasoned that if school officials had been aware of the situation 
they could have urged the student to apply for a hardship exception to the 
residency rule. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's decision also reinstated McClatchy in a postseason tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"Most violations are inadvertent mistakes of innocence," said Central Coast 
Section Commissioner Nancy Lazenby. "Somebody didn't ask the right question of 
the kid or the kid didn't understand, or wasn't double-checked and got by 
somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Lazenby said, "In our section we really don't talk about 
ignorance of the rule as an excuse . . . to make an exception or to waive 
penalties." 
</P>
<P>
Nevada Interscholastic Activities Executive Director Jerry Hughes agreed that 
forfeiture is the only equitable means for dealing with ineligible athletes -- 
even if the player's performance was incidental to winning. 
</P>
<P>
One reason, Hughes said, is that the ineligible player takes away playing time 
from an eligible student. 
</P>
<P>
"What's fair for one kid might not be very fair for another kid," Hughes said. 
"If you have someone playing who is ineligible, there's a kid on the bench who 
is not being treated very fairly. You have to look at the total situation."

LINE VIOLATION RUINS DAY FOR ESPERANZA RELAY TEAM 
</P>

Jerry Kamecki, Damon Richardson, Garrick Emery and Roshawn Sims had just 
combined for what appeared to be the fastest 1,600-meter relay performance of 
the day during the Southern Section 3-A preliminaries Saturday at Camarillo 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
But the elation of the Esperanza High School sprinters soon turned to despair 
when they were told they had been disqualified because of a line violation. 
</P>
<P>
The judges ruled that Richardson, the relay team's No. 2 runner, cut in too 
soon before the appropriate stagger line, negating their time of 3 minutes 19.9 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
The time would have bettered the foursome's previous best by more than four 
seconds, and would have ranked first in the county this year. In addition, the 
team that was awarded first place in Esperanza's heat, Ontario, will be the 
top-seeded team, instead of defending 3-A champion Esperanza, in Friday's 
sectional championships at Cerritos College. Ontario finished nearly 25 yards 
behind the Aztecs Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Although Esperanza Coach Al Britt protested the decision, arguing that 
Richardson was misled by a white stagger line that came 10 yards before the 
official green line, meet officials upheld the disqualification. 
</P>
<P>
"He cut in at the white line, not at the green line," said meet referee Blair 
Fictum. "It's unfortunate, but the kid cut in too soon." 
</P>
<P>
The same thing happened to Newport Harbor in the following heat. The 
1,600-meter relay team was disqualified when the second runner was judged to 
have cut in too soon, but no protest was made. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the Aztecs, who qualified seven individuals as well as its 400 
relay team, did not fare well in the relay, they did have several good 
performances, most notably in the shot put in which Mark Parlin (60 feet 2 
3/4), Mark Kinney (58-3 1/4) and Mike Burns (52-11 1/2) finished first, second 
and fifth, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Double qualifiers included Los Alamitos' Erik Mitchell, who ran the fastest 
time of the day in the 200 meters (a wind-aided 21.53) and in the 100 (10.70w); 
Newport Harbor's Brent Busch (110 hurdles, 300 hurdles); Esperanza' Sims (200, 
400) and Parlin (shot put, discus); Los Alamitos' Steve Sargeant (high jump, 
long jump); Santa Ana's Frank Quinonez (1,600, 3,200), and Foothill's Roman 
Slobodynski and University's Af Haghhighi (shot put and discus). 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' competition, Melissa McDonald of Mater Dei proved the most 
versatile as she qualified for the finals in the 400, long jump, high jump and 
1,600 relay. McDonald, a junior, had been unable to compete for most of the 
season because of a quadriceps injury. 
</P>
<P>
Double qualifiers included Loara's Jackie Rosas and Newport Harbor freshman 
Kala Ross (high jump, long jump); University's Tanja Brix and Katella's Martha 
Pinto (1,600, 3,200); Los Alamitos' Tracy Fatone and Mater Dei's Kelly Flathers 
(800, 1,600); Esperanza's Nikki Jackson and Newport Harbor's Susie Jacobson 
(100 hurdles, 300 hurdles); Santa Ana Valley's Joanna Alo (shot put, discus) 
and Brenda Robinson (100 hurdles, long jump), and Canyon's Sheila Green and 
Mater Dei's Catherine Soto (long jump, triple jump).

VICTORIA A YEAR LATER; 
</P>
<P>
FIRST GIRL TO START IN LITTLE LEAGUE SERIES INTENDS TO KEEP ON PLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Victoria Brucker, the girl who captivated the 50th Little League World Series 
last summer, stepped to the plate in her first at-bat of a baseball game at San 
Pedro recently and drove a single into short right field. 
</P>
<P>
Almost a year after the perky 12-year-old became the first girl to start, pitch 
and get a hit in a game at the most famous of all youth baseball championships, 
she is back to basics in the Major Division of the Eastview Little League 
Senior League. 
</P>
<P>
In August, Brucker was seen on the front page of newspapers and on television 
programs across the nation. A teammate referred to her as "just one of the 
boys" during the series, and the media wouldn't let Brucker forget it. She 
spent a month after the series as the darling of television talk shows, despite 
the fact Eastview lost two of three games in Williamsport, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
In the fall, Brucker traveled the banquet circuit, receiving more interview 
requests than all of the members of the championship team from Trumbull, Conn., 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
Her story since Williamsport is not without anecdotes. She enjoyed meeting Pat 
McCormick, who won four gold medals in platform and springboard diving at the 
1952 and '56 Olympics, but was angered by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar when he refused 
to give her a second autograph for her brother. 
</P>
<P>
But it is also a story of a young girl pushed into a woman's world perhaps 
before it was her time. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, I think it would have been nice to have just been normal," Brucker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
No cameras were present at San Pedro's Fromhold Field as she scooted down the 
first-base line, her trademark black hair flowing from under a batting helmet. 
There were no autograph seekers, although a crowd of about 30 die-hards sat 
through the chilly afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Brucker, wearing a black baseball cap bearing the words "Wonder Woman," has 
grown up a lot in eight months. 
</P>
<P>
"At 13 years old, now I can see the girl side in her coming out," said her 
mother, Elizabeth Roderick. "She wants to wear skirts and sweaters to school." 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth said she was more at ease talking while watching her daughter play at 
Fromhold than she was at Williamsport, where she "couldn't move" without a 
microphone or autograph book being shoved in her face. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I had been prepared for it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria wasn't ready to handle all of the attention, either. 
</P>
<P>
"Did the attention bother me? Yes, sometimes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
At least once during the series she cried behind the locked gates of the 
players' complex. On closing day, in front of an estimated 30,000, she was 
pulled from a crowd of autograph seekers by her stepfather, Rick Roderick. And 
the morning before she was to make history as the first female to pitch in a 
series game, hundreds of local teen-agers crowded into the hotel where she was 
staying and demanded to meet her. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard to get her all wound down after that," said Elizabeth, who watched 
Victoria allow five runs and seven hits in a 10-1 loss to Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria's return to baseball was moderately successful, at best. But that was 
expected, since she and her all-star teammates are playing in the Major 
Division for boys 13-15. In June, they are expected to reunite on a tournament 
team for 13-year-olds that will play in the Little League's Minor Division, one 
of nine holding national championships. 
</P>
<P>
"This competition, against older kids, should help them at tournament time," 
said Eastview President Gary Miley. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it is a difficult adjustment for Victoria. Last season she tied for the 
all-star lead in home runs with nine, but she hit them on fields with 200-foot 
fences. This season, she plays on fields with fences more than 300 feet away. 
The bases are the regulation 90 feet apart, not 60, which makes her throw from 
first base sink as it crosses the diamond. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes about half a season for these younger players (to adjust)," Roderick 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria's male counterparts from the all-star team, many of whom are still 
protective of her, have grown as much as a foot in the off-season. "Vicky," as 
they call her, looks about the same height. 
</P>
<P>
Personal problems have also plagued the family since Williamsport. Victoria 
pressured her parents to get a transfer from Dodson Junior High School to Dana 
Junior High. At first her mother was at a loss to explain the request: "I just 
sensed it was time for her to be with her girlfriends," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In the four weeks Victoria was separated from her family last summer (she 
competed in the Western Regional in San Bernardino, at Williamsport, then 
missed a family outing to Massachusetts after the World Series), a sibling 
rivalry developed between Victoria and her two sisters and a brother. 
</P>
<P>
"At Williamsport, the kids were making jokes about her to get through all the 
attention she got," Elizabeth said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after a house fire April 18 destroyed some World Series items and left 
the family homeless, the feud came to a head. Reporters seemed more interested 
in the fact that Victoria had lost things from the World Series than in the 
plight of the family. 
</P>
<P>
"The other kids are really feeling it now," Elizabeth said. "They say to me, 
'Mom, we lost our things, too, but all anyone cares about is Vicky.' " 
</P>
<P>
Rick said most of the reports about the scope of the fire and the loss of 
memorabilia were inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of Vicky's room was saved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rodericks made it clear they do not fault the people of Williamsport or 
Little League officials for what they refer to as "the blitz" of fans and media 
in August. But Elizabeth blamed it for much of Eastview's poor showing -- a 
sentiment echoed by the team's coaches at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"Do I scold you guys now?" she asked a reporter who was also part of the 
intrusion at Williamsport. "The kids didn't get to play like they should have 
because of all the pressure (because of Victoria being there). I just wish they 
could play that tournament again without the pressure. We'd see how they would 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Victoria, her mother said, will come through the melodrama just fine. 
</P>
<P>
"She is a level-headed kid," Elizabeth said. "She's a young lady now. Because 
she loves baseball more than ever, she knows what she has to do to keep playing 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Reports surfaced at Williamsport that Victoria had been asked to attend Bishop 
Montgomery High in Torrance next year so she could play on the school's junior 
varsity baseball team. The Rodericks said that was not the case. 
</P>
<P>
"She'll attend San Pedro High School next year . . . and she'll play baseball 
there," Elizabeth said. 
</P>
<P>
Would the Rodericks, who have hired a lawyer to represent them in further 
bookings, want Victoria to do it all over again? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, they said. America loves heroes, though it also forgets them very quickly.

HARBOR POWERS WAY PAST MIRACOSTA, 9-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART MATTHEWS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They're only a bunch of little guys, but Harbor College's baseball team is 
still putting up big numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Harbor defeated visiting MiraCosta College of Oceanside, 9-4, in the 
second game of the first round of the Southern California community college 
baseball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Only three players in Harbor's starting lineup Saturday were taller than 6 
feet, but that didn't stop the Seahawks from improving to 45-5. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor, the top-seeded team in the region, advances to next weekend's regional 
finals at Riverside City College or Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
"You look out there on the field and you can see we don't have a lot of big 
guys," Harbor Coach Jim O'Brien said. "What we have is a bunch of tough kids 
with a lot of heart. These guys have got their minds made up on going all the 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Harbor will be one of eight teams in the two four-team Southern California 
regional finals tournaments. The two winners of the Southern regionals will 
play the two Northern regional champions in the state tournament May 25-27 at 
UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor's victory ousted MiraCosta (18-20) from the best two-of-three series. 
Harbor won the first game of the series, 11-5, Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Leading Harbor's 11-hit attack in Saturday's game was 5-foot-10 left fielder 
Matt Nuez, who hit a pair of doubles and a home run. The two-run homer, a 
team-leading eighth, came in the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Nuez raised his average to .333 and tied the school record for doubles with 16. 
He also leads the team in runs (52) hits (58) and runs batted in (52). 
</P>
<P>
Center fielder Ryan Karp added a solo homer to center -- his sixth. Harbor 
shortstop Tony Liebsack made nice plays on five tough ground balls behind 
starting pitcher Jeff Hunter (10-0) and reliever John Ingram. Liebsack made 
only four errors in Harbor's conference games. 
</P>
<P>
"Liebsack is as tough as they come," O'Brien said. "If you hit it to shortstop, 
you're going to be out." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter struggled early, giving up a homer to MiraCosta's John Wagner on his 
first pitch. But he settled down to strike out seven in 6 2/3 innings. Ingram, 
a hard-throwing left-hander who will attend Cal State Fullerton, struck out 
five. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor never trailed, but its early leads were only 2-1, 3-2, and 6-4. 
MiraCosta left-hander Paul Jeffers (2-2) kept the score close, but the Seahawks 
erupted in the eighth and ninth against relievers Brent Hansen and Dan Sudd. 
</P>
<P>
Right-hander Pat Ahearne (11-1) picked up the victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks, who swept their 20-game Southern California Athletic Conference 
schedule without a loss, have not lost a game since an April 11 defeat to 
Diablo Valley in the College of the Sequoias tournament in Visalia. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Murphy went 3 for 4 and catcher Robert Lewis hit a two-run homer to lead 
Harbor in Friday's game. Right-hander Pat Ahearne (11-1), who will attend 
Pepperdine next season, picked up the victory.

San Clemente High School's Tim Martin was the top Orange County boys' performer 
and Edison's Shelly Taylor and Mission Viejo's Lisa Fager led the girls in the 
Southern Section 4-A track and field preliminaries Saturday at Gahr High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
Martin qualified for next Saturday's finals at Cerritos College by winning his 
heats in the 100-meter race (11.04 seconds) and the 200 (22.12); neither time 
was the day's best. Long Beach Poly's Andre Green ran an 11.01 in the 100 and a 
21.59 (as did San Bernardino's John Thomas) in the 200 for the top times. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor finished first in the girls' 1,600-meter run with a time of 5 minutes 
4.91 seconds. She came back to win her 800-meter heat in 2:18.20 -- the 
second-best qualifying time to Muir's Rhonda Robinson (2:17.04). El Toro's 
Julie Focht and San Clemente's Tabi Bahu also qualified in the 800. The top 
nine finishers in each event advance to the finals. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View's Christie Engesser came into Saturday's prelims with the best time 
(2:14.83) in the 800, but finished a disappointing fourth at 2:21.28 and failed 
to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills' Dan Niednagel had the second-best qualifying time of 1:55.64 in the 
boys' 800, and Marina's Alan Grant qualified at 1:56.31. Marina's Brian 
McCaffery won his 1,600-meter heat in 4:19.24, after Newberry Park's Jeff 
Wilson was disqualified for stepping into another lane. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo's Fager was among the six girls who qualified in the high jump at 
the day's top mark of 5 feet 2 inches and had the best triple jump at 37-9 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley long jumper Sarah Toomey, who came into the meet with a 
second-best mark of 17-11, did not compete after a medical exam Thursday 
revealed a stress fracture in her right leg. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County performers fared best in the field events. Top qualifying marks 
were turned in by Dana Hills' Andy Marrone in the discus (173-10 1/2), Mission 
Viejo's Mark Slymen in the shot put (52-9), Capistrano Valley's Tyson Jacobsen 
in the pole vault (13-6), and Marina's Fridoon Abawi in the long jump (22-9).

<P>
Youth batted .500 in the semifinals of the Children's Hospital of Orange County 
tennis tournament at the John Wayne Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
In the first match, Trevor Kronemann and Richard Lubner, the Young Turks, beat 
Dick Miller and Eliot Teltscher, representing the old guard, 7-6, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
In the second match, Jon Leach, a junior at Laguna Beach High School, and Chris 
Dunk, 32, lost to veterans Tim Pawsat and Robert Van't Hof, 6-7, 7-5, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Kronemann and Lubner, seeded second, play Pawsat and Van't Hof, the top seeds, 
in the final at 1 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament is a tuneup for the NCAA tournament for Kronemann and Lubner, 
seniors at UC Irvine. The Anteaters face West Virginia in the opening round of 
the team tournament on Friday at Indian Wells. 
</P>
<P>
The Leach-Dunk pairing was the most intriguing of all the doubles partners in 
the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Dunk is a friend of the Leach family -- Dick, the father, is the USC men's 
coach and Rick, Jon's older brother, is one of the top doubles players in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been playing and practicing about four or five years now," Dunk said. 
"It gives Jon a chance to learn a little from me." 
</P>
<P>
Leach, who won the 16-and-under national championship last year, appears to 
have picked up more than a few pointers from Dunk. 
</P>
<P>
Playing against older men, however, Leach's inexperience showed at times 
Saturday, though he and Dunk played Pawsat and Van't Hof tough. Only a couple 
of service breaks kept them from advancing. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the pressure was on us," Pawsat said. "We were the stronger team, but 
that's not to say they aren't capable of beating us." 
</P>
<P>
Leach was serving for the match in the second set, but lost his serve. Van't 
Hof held and Dunk lost his serve and the match slipped away. Pawsat and Van't 
Hof then dominated the third set. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy May Paben and Stephanie Rehe meet Barbara Lemberg and Sandy Collins in 
the women's final at 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Paben and Rehe defeated Linda Howell and Cynthia MacGregor, 6-3, 6-7, 6-3, in 
one semifinal Saturday. Lemberg and Collins beat Beth Herr and Cammy MacGregor, 
6-3, 3-6, 7-6, in the other semifinal.

OCC EDGES GOLDEN WEST IN SOFTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange Coast College, aided by two errors and a walk, scored in the first 
inning for a 1-0 victory over Golden West in a Southern California Regional 
softball playoff game Saturday at OCC. 
</P>
<P>
Kristin Heizer pitched a one-hitter to get the victory for OCC (33-11). 
</P>
<P>
Golden West's only hit was a single in the fourth by Sheri Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Pam Fogg pitched a three-hitter for Golden West. The teams play today at noon 
in the second of their best-of-three series at OCC. Should Golden West win, 
another game will follow. 
</P>
<P>
In another regional: 
</P>
<P>
Cypress 8, Grossmont 2 -- Shortstop Tricia Barr had three hits and three runs 
batted in to pace host Cypress. Laura Corson (20-2) pitched a two-hitter for 
the Chargers (39-6). The teams play again at noon today at Cypress, and 
Grossmont (21-15) needs to win to extend the best-of-three series to a third 
game. 
</P>
<P>
In the Southern California men's tennis championships at College of the Desert: 
</P>
<P>
Scott Hansen, an unseeded singles player from Saddleback, pulled off two upsets 
to advance to the semifinals. Hansen defeated No. 3 Tim Clark of Bakersfield, 
6-1, 6-4, and No. 8 Nick Zinzmeister of Desert, 6-2, 4-6, 2-2 retired. 
</P>
<P>
In the semifinals, Hansen will play top-seeded John Swaino of Cypress and Carl 
Hinds of Saddleback, who defeated Derek Hall of Moorpark, 6-0, 6-0, and Jon 
Imel of Long Beach, 6-3, 6-2, will play No. 2 Jon Fox of Santa Barbara.

<P>
The ease with which Rancho Santiago College dispatched Mt. San Jacinto from the 
Southern California Regional playoffs Saturday was impressive. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Nay pitched a five-hitter and the Dons won, 12-0, in the second game to win 
the series two games to one. Rancho Santiago had won, 6-4, Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Dons were overpowering in the second game Saturday after struggling in the 
first game, an 8-7 loss. 
</P>
<P>
In the loss, Rancho Santiago had only seven hits and left eight runners on base 
in the final four innings. 
</P>
<P>
But Mt. San Jacinto, the 15th-seeded team, was out of pitching in the second 
game and Rancho Santiago, the No. 2 seed, still had Nay, a sophomore 
left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
Nay (6-1) allowed hits to the first two batters he faced, but got a double play 
to help escape the jam. The Rancho Santiago infield turned double plays in the 
second and fourth innings as well. 
</P>
<P>
Nay had two walks and five strikeouts and Mt. San Jacinto (21-23) advanced a 
runner to third base only twice. 
</P>
<P>
"Nay did another (good) job for us," Rancho Santiago Coach Don Sneddon said. 
"He's done it when we needed him most. He had a good fastball and he kept them 
off balance with his curve." 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago (34-10) scored three runs in the third and four in the fourth. 
Conrad Colby had a sacrifice fly and Jeff White added a two-run single in the 
third. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Criss had an RBI double, Shaun Sterling had an RBI groundout and the 
final two runs were scored on an error and a wild pitch in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Colby had RBI singles in the sixth and the eighth and Greg Martineau hit a 
three-run home run in the eighth for Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
Martineau, who hit a three-run home run in the first game as well, has seven 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Martineau hit fourth in the second game as Sneddon continued to shuffle his 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Marty Neff, who had been hitting fourth most of the season, was moved to the 
sixth spot because of a slump. He was one for 12 with two RBIs in the three 
playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Floth hit fourth and Martineau fifth in the first game, but it was 
Floth's failed bunt that hurt Rancho Santiago in the first game. Rancho 
Santiago trailed, 8-7, in the ninth, but Steve Grack singled and Colby walked. 
Floth took two strikes before flying out. 
</P>
<P>
Martineau hit into a force play and Neff grounded out to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Hassel (6-2), pitching in relief of starter Matt Lackie, took the loss. 
Lackie, who had pitched once in the last three weeks before Saturday because of 
a viral infection, allowed eight hits and five runs, four earned, in three-plus 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
The second round, which starts Friday, is double elimination and will be played 
at two sites. The pairings will be announced today. The tentative schedule is 
Rancho Santiago playing Riverside and Moorpark against Fullerton at Riverside; 
at Cerritos, L.A. Harbor will play Rio Hondo and Golden West will take on San 
Bernardino Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In other playoff games: 
</P>
<P>
Golden West 8, Cuesta 2 -- James Hutchins (6-2) pitched a four-hitter to lead 
host Golden West (27-12-1). Mark Magrann had four hits and Steve McKowen, Gary 
Christopherson, Gerad Cawhorn and Mike Willey had two hits for Golden West. 
Shelby Hart also had two sacrifice flies. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton 3-9, Canyons 7-5 -- Fullerton rallied in the second game to advance. 
Canyons led, 5-1, after three innings in the second game, but Fullerton's Jim 
Short had a sacrifice fly to give Fullerton a 6-5 lead. Tom Wilson added an RBI 
single. 
</P>
<P>
Crosby Spencer and Jeff Manship hit home runs in the eight for Fullerton 
(26-14). 
</P>
<P>
Matt Lipscomb (3-3) pitched a six-hitter, allowing only one hit after the 
third. It was his first complete game this season.

THE HEART AND HUMOR OF FRESNO STATE SOFTBALL; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE SPORTS: HUNTINGTON BEACH NATIVE MARTHA NOFFSINGER IS IN THE NCAA RECORD 
BOOKS. NOW, SHE WANTS TO BE ON A NATIONAL CHAMPION. 
</P>

FRESNO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A screeching howl echoes across the Fresno State softball field, surely the 
plaintive wail of a soul in mourning. As it turns out, however, it's just 
Martha Noffsinger "singing" Happy Birthday to a teammate. 
</P>
<P>
If you live in Fresno, further explanation is probably not necessary. Those 
unfamiliar with the team, however, will need to understand that Noffsinger, a 
senior shortstop from Huntington Beach, is much more than just an offensive 
catalyst and a defensive key. She's the heart and humor of the Fresno program. 
She's entertaining, to be sure, but it's her abounding love for the game that's 
so clearly contagious. Nobody should have this much fun doing anything. 
</P>
<P>
It's great to watch her play during a game, but it's even more fun to watch her 
play during a rain delay. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess my favorite was the time she and (catcher) Shelly Stokes and (former 
player) Kathy Mayer put towels on like big diapers and then went out and sang 
and danced in front of the fans," said teammate Gina LoPiccolo, a junior third 
baseman from Sunny Hills High School. 
</P>
<P>
Noffsinger also started a between-innings ritual at Fresno, a variation on the 
high-five theme. Each infielder has her own personally choreographed, elaborate 
handshake that includes all sorts of gyrations, patty-cake moves and even 
elbows and noses. 
</P>
<P>
This Bulldog hand-jive has been featured often on local television and is 
sweeping the softball society. 
</P>
<P>
"(Pitcher) Carie Dever and I started it as freshmen, just fooling around in 
practice," Noffsinger said. "It was good for us. We were starting and we felt 
good. Then, pretty soon everyone on the team wanted to get in on it and it just 
sort of evolved. We do it on the bench now, too. 
</P>
<P>
"It keeps us relaxed. Even in the most tense, pressure situations we do it and 
it keeps us loose. It's like, 'Hey, we can do this.' 
</P>
<P>
"Now, every team we play is doing it." 
</P>
<P>
At first, Fresno State Coach Margie Wright wasn't sure she liked all this 
celebrating. "I like to let my players be themselves as long as it doesn't come 
out in a negative way," she said. "When this started her freshman year, a lot 
of the older players didn't know how to handle it and I wasn't too happy to see 
them make a mistake and then do the handshake. 
</P>
<P>
"But no one is more competitive than Martha and she showed me that it wasn't a 
way to laugh off a mistake, it was a way to release the feelings players 
usually repress. And that's a very positive action." 
</P>
<P>
It certainly seems to be working for the Bulldogs. They are 56-13 this season 
and the No. 2-ranked team in the nation going into the West Regionals scheduled 
Friday and Saturday at a site to be determined Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Don't be surprised if the Bulldogs -- whose 1,017 average attendance leads the 
country for the second year in a row -- end up with some more home games this 
season. And they will gladly thank crowd-pleaser Noffsinger for yet another 
contribution. Talk about home-field advantages. There's nothing else in 
softball to compare to a 3,000-strong gathering of devoted, vocal Red Wave 
boosters. 
</P>
<P>
"All the stuff Martha does works for the crowd and it works for us because she 
knows just how to ease the tension," said Stokes, who has roomed with 
Noffsinger for four years. "I'm really kind of intense and I'll come out to the 
mound in the late innings of a big game and I'll be saying things like, 'OK, 
let's be tough. Let's bear down,' and Martha will say, 'Oh, shut up.' 
</P>
<P>
"Then everyone will laugh and we'll be relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
And then they usually win. 
</P>
<P>
Opposing pitchers tend to find Noffsinger less humorous, however. She recently 
established the NCAA career hits record (320) and has a .387 batting average. 
</P>
<P>
There wasn't much pressure involved as she "chased" the record, considering she 
had eclipsed the mark by more than a dozen hits before the NCAA statistics 
department, after some extensive research, officially recognized her as the 
all-time hits leader. Brenda Woodward had 288 career hits at Texas-Arlington in 
1983-86. 
</P>
<P>
Noffsinger has Fresno career records in batting average (.337), hits, runs 
(151), sacrifices (88) and at-bats (949). She was co-Big West player of the 
year and an all-College World Series selection last season as the Bulldogs lost 
to UCLA in the championship game for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
Noffsinger was not on either the first or second All-America teams, however, an 
omission that infuriates Wright. 
</P>
<P>
"Martha took the snub much better than I did," Wright said. "I try to be very 
objective about these things and if better players are picked over mine, I 
never say a word. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's just say Martha's statistics speak for themselves and knowing the impact 
she's had on this team's success, that made it doubly frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
Noffsinger just smiles and shrugs. She says team honors far outweigh personal 
glory. You've heard it before, but when she says it, you believe it. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, it was a little disappointing," she said, "but I don't know of any 
individual awards that I wouldn't trade for a national championship. You can 
take an All-American plaque home and show it to your kids some day, but a 
national championship you can share and that's so much more fun." 
</P>
<P>
Noffsinger's team-oriented attitude has helped her gain great individual 
success. Her unselfish approach to batting, for instance, has made her into a 
downright nuisance at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
She controls the bat with the same poise she handles a crowd during a rain 
delay. Once a switch-hitter, she now bats exclusively from the left side. With 
her speed and that extra step toward first, every ground ball is a potential 
infield single. 
</P>
<P>
She has become the master of the run-and -- slap technique, a sort of swinging 
drag bunt. The batter actually steps toward first before making contact with 
the ball. She's also an expert bunter. Barry Smith, Fresno's assistant sports 
information director, estimates that more than 200 of Noffsinger's 320 career 
hits never left the infield. 
</P>
<P>
"Martha's the hardest kind of hitter to pitch to," said sophomore Terry 
Carpenter, an All-American pitcher for the Bulldogs who was also Noffsinger's 
teammate at Edison High. "She has so many options. She can bunt or run-and-slap 
or hit for power." 
</P>
<P>
Well, maybe not a lot of power. She has hit just one ball over the fence in her 
career at Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a freshman and I was sprinting into second when the shortstop told me it 
was over the fence," Noffsinger said. "I said, 'No way!' But then I saw 
everyone cheering and laughing at me, so I knew it was really gone. Nice 
home-run trot on my only homer, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
One day soon, Martha Noffsinger, the softball player, the embodiment of Bulldog 
softball, will be gone, too. Who said the fun never stops? 
</P>
<P>
No more dancing in the rain. No more wails echoing across the field. 
</P>
<P>
For Bulldog fans -- and especially Wright -- the silence will be sickening. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd seen her play a lot during the summer when she was in high school and I 
really wasn't surprised to see her come in here as a freshman and be an 
immediate leader," Wright said. "Martha's one in a million. I don't see any 
young players out there that have the same kind of whole package, the talent 
and the personality. 
</P>
<P>
"We've talked about life after softball and making sure that you don't start 
feeling sad until it's over. You want to go out in style. But Martha's got so 
much going for her, she'll be just as successful in whatever she does as she is 
out here." 
</P>
<P>
They held Senior Day last Sunday and Noffsinger was duly honored by fans and 
teammates alike. She ran through rows of saluting teammates with a yellow rose 
in her teeth and playfully turned away when Dever tried to give her a kiss. She 
never let down the happy clown facade, but she said there were some tears 
underneath the makeup. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard because I got so many cards and gifts that all said, 'Thank you,' 
and I wanted to be able to say, 'No, thank you.' 
</P>
<P>
"I've been working hard at keeping it all in perspective. We won the Big West, 
but we still have a regional and the World Series to go to reach all three of 
our goals. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be fine until the team banquet on June 3, then I'll probably lose it 
there. It's sad to think it's ending, but my life is really just beginning." 
</P>
<P>
Noffsinger will still be on campus for at least another year while she gets her 
teaching credential. She wants to teach elementary school -- "second to fourth 
grade," she says -- and, considering the depth of her dedication and that 
reserve of verve, there's little doubt she will be an inspiration for a 
generation of future students. 
</P>
<P>
Let's just hope she decides against serenading them on their birthdays.

The nun in the blue and white cotton sari, her gingham apron soaked from a 
morning of scrubbing floors, was showing her visitors to the door of the 
Missionaries of Charity convent in Lynwood. They lingered a moment in the 
doorway for one last question. 
</P>
<P>
"How is Mother?" a sister from another order asked about Mother Teresa of 
Calcutta. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, we hear she looks so old and frail," the nun said. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems as if the only reason she's staying alive is to bring Jesus to 
Albania. . . . That is where she's from. She has brought Jesus to Russia, to so 
many other places. It's as if she won't die until she's able to bring him to 
her own country." 
</P>
<P>
Mother Teresa, 79, continues to push on with her work -- she was recently in 
Romania to open a convent -- despite a heart attack last fall and subsequent 
surgery to install a pacemaker. But last month, the world-famous founder of the 
Missionaries of Charity announced her resignation as superior general. And her 
successor, who will be elected at a meeting of the order in Calcutta on Sept. 
8, is now a subject of concern and speculation within the Roman Catholic 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Whoever succeeds her, probably one of six senior advisers in her council, will 
have an almost impossible job in following such a charismatic founder. Mother 
Teresa, the recipient of the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize, is often called a "living 
saint." She is arguably the most famous Catholic in the world, next to the 
Pope. What's more, her successor will face a formidable challenge in the United 
States, where critics of Mother Teresa's organization -- Catholics, social 
workers and activists -- question her approach to aiding the poor. 
</P>
<P>
These critics -- most of whom refused to allow their names to be used in this 
article -- ask how an order that has come to be so closely identified with its 
founder can carry on without her. They question the tight control she exerts 
over her followers -- about 3,000 nuns, 500 brothers, more than 100,000 
co-workers and a handful of priests in some 90 countries. They suggest that her 
complete devotion to conservative hierarchical Catholicism and silence on 
issues of social justice have limited her effectiveness in serving the poor. 
They also question whether the austere lifestyle and service she established in 
Calcutta are appropriate for the West. 
</P>
<P>
In the words of one conservative Catholic layman in Los Angeles, "Either they 
will have to evolve into something else now that she's going, or they won't 
last." 
</P>
<P>
Some say that personal identification with Mother Teresa, rather than the work 
itself, is what has drawn many nuns and others to work with her. After she's 
gone, they ask, will the order continue to attract members, and will her 
followers remain? 
</P>
<P>
To some of her detractors, that identification and veneration is excessive, and 
they liken it to the atmosphere that might surround a cult figure. 
</P>
<P>
At times, the veneration can be jarring, although it often comes from lay 
people, rather than members of her order. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, Mother Teresa was in San Francisco, regional headquarters of the 
order, when a small group of novice nuns took their vows. A small private 
reception for their families followed the church ceremony and ended with 
prayers in the bare little convent chapel, where Mother Teresa huddled barefoot 
on the floor. The place was packed; people had waited for hours outside, then 
jostled their way in. 
</P>
<P>
After prayers, the patient public was rewarded. Mother Teresa entered the 
vestibule, smiling, warmly greeting people, placing her hands on their heads or 
taking their hands one by one, and blessing each with a small Miraculous Medal. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, she disappeared into a small reception room. The door closed and 
people lingered until Jeanette Petrie, a friend and supporter of Mother Teresa 
who has co-produced a documentary about her and often acts on her behalf, 
started ushering people out, firmly but gently reminding them the day was for 
the families. 
</P>
<P>
One crestfallen woman protested. She had come so far, waited so long, and 
gotten nothing. Petrie reached into her pocket and pulled out a fistful of 
medals. As the stunned and seemingly overjoyed woman's hands closed over them, 
Petrie assured her, "These have all been blessed by Mother Teresa." 
</P>
<P>
A tough act to follow. 
</P>
<P>
Mother Teresa has gone about her mission with purpose, seeming to have a clear 
idea of herself and an unapologetic explanation of how she operates. But the 
sisters in her order seem to live in her shadow, preferring anonymity, often 
seeming uneasy and reluctant to make decisions or express opinions, seeming to 
approach every situation with one inner question: "What would Mother do?" Such 
behavior reflects an earlier era, before Vatican II, when convent life was more 
regimented and authoritarian. Since then, in the United States especially, most 
orders have developed more independent and democratic structures. 
</P>
<P>
Mother Teresa seems to have delegated little, and, for example, has insisted on 
personally approving and opening each of the 400 homes or sites where her 
sisters work around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"The sisters do not seem to have the freedom to be themselves," said one 
Catholic who has worked closely with Mother Teresa and both admires and 
questions aspects of her work. "They're expected to conform to one ideology: 
kneel like this, say the rosary like this. There are those who would say it 
borders on a cult." 
</P>
<P>
Requests for interviews with the Missionaries of Charity sisters were denied by 
Sister Sylvia (sisters in this order do not use last names), the regional 
superior in San Francisco. Speaking through a third party, Cathy Olson, who 
heads the lay support group, Co-Workers of Mother Teresa in Los Angeles, Sister 
Sylvia said the order preferred to see nothing written on Mother Teresa's 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
At times, some of the sisters seem uneasy in unstructured situations. One 
evening last year, at the order's San Francisco soup kitchen, a dishwasher in 
his 30s who said he had destroyed years of his life with drugs and drifting, 
was describing his happiness in having made his way back and finding faith. Now 
a regular volunteer, he said that day had been the most important day of his 
life. He had been invited to a private reception with Mother Teresa. 
</P>
<P>
He started to ramble about Mother Teresa to the other volunteers. The sister 
who was supervising the cleanup listened uneasily, and then, looking inspired, 
spun toward him and, smiling widely, said, "Say the 'Our Father,' please." 
</P>
<P>
Startled, the dishwasher began to intone the Lord's Prayer, and the others 
joined in. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to questioning the internal workings of the order, some of her 
detractors fault Mother Teresa for her blind obedience to a traditional, 
patriarchal and authoritative church. Some find her subservience to the Vatican 
galling, and are angered or saddened by her remarks, such as those on the 
question of women's ordination to the priesthood: "A woman would be a misfit as 
a priest . . . better to be 'handmaids of the Lord.' " 
</P>
<P>
Nuns often resent the fact she is held up to them as a model. One woman, Sister 
Bernadette Hillson, a nurse and Sister of Social Service in Los Angeles, said 
she considers Mother Teresa a saint in her "single-minded love of God," but is 
disturbed by the traditional image of a nun she presents. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what's happened," Hillson said, "is that the Church and the Right have 
(in effect) canonized Mother Teresa and refused to recognize the contribution 
of other women in the church. . . . She's the perfect woman, the perfect 
daughter all of us were groomed to be." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Unsworth, a Catholic layman who has satirized Mother Teresa in the National 
Catholic Reporter, an independent weekly, said he is known as a "pro-nun" 
writer. His sister is a nun, he said, and he admires the unsung work she and 
others like her do daily, such as quietly and effectively running soup 
kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
"Yet if Mother Teresa comes in and opens a soup kitchen, the press drowns her 
in ink." 
</P>
<P>
His comment echoed that of a Los Angeles monsignor, who sees a problem in the 
way "the media hypes her, while all the while sisters like the Daughters of 
Charity, who were founded . . . to care for the poor have been doing the same 
thing. It's as if her work dismisses them. It's painful." 
</P>
<P>
Mother Teresa is a staunch and unyielding foe of artificial birth control: 
"Self-control is the natural way. It is God's way." And she attributes India's 
problems not to poverty but to ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
Although she describes herself as apolitical, her campaign against abortion has 
become increasingly vocal and political since her acceptance speech at the 1979 
Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
There she called abortion a threat to peace, "the greatest destroyer of man in 
the world." Since receiving the prize, she has seldom been out of the public 
eye, traveling an average of 10 months a year, always making references to 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
At best, progressive, or liberal, Catholics, whose faith is rooted in a 
commitment to social justice, face a conflict when trying to answer how a woman 
who so identifies with the poor refuses to criticize or question institutions 
or people who cause or perpetuate poverty. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, for example, in Bhopal, India, when the Union Carbide accident killed 
and injured thousands, Mother Teresa rushed to the scene, arriving at the 
airport with bananas and apples to distribute to those who had been 
hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
To questions about wrongdoing, negligence, lawsuits and compensation, she 
responded, "Forgive, forgive. I just ask people to forgive. I am here to give 
love and care to those who most need it in this terrible tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
She has said flatly, "I am not trying to change anything. I am only trying to 
live my love, to (meet) the need that the person has at that moment." In all 
her endeavors, she enjoins: "Let us do something beautiful for God." 
</P>
<P>
Sister Patricia Krommer, a Sister of St. Joseph of Carondelet who directs the 
Humanitarian Law Project in Los Angeles, finds such an attitude hard to fathom. 
</P>
<P>
"I really do appreciate the work that she does, and the comfort she gives the 
poor." But, Krommer added, accepting money from institutions and people who 
help perpetuate poverty -- without challenging them -- "doesn't change 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Father Don Kribs, a Los Angeles priest, was closely allied with Mother Teresa 
in the 1970s, heading the Co-Workers of Mother Teresa in the Western United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"Her direct service to the poor was what attracted me," he said, adding that he 
still admires and loves her greatly for it. But, he said, "Her silence about 
social justice is devastating. She's got a blind spot, for whatever reason, but 
it's OK. She's not perfect, and it's time it be said she's not perfect." 
</P>
<P>
It has been 42 years since Mother Teresa, then a member of the Missionary 
Sister of Loreto order, walked out of the cloistered life she knew at St. 
Mary's, a high school for girls in Calcutta, and headed for the slums. The 
former principal and geography teacher was answering what she took to be a 
direct call from God to serve "the poorest of the poor." 
</P>
<P>
By 1950, she had a band of 12 followers and founded a new order, the Missionary 
Sisters of Charity. They had already become known in Calcutta for finding the 
dying poor on the streets and carrying them to Nirmal Hriday, a home for the 
dying and destitute. To this day, she is most closely identified with this 
work. By 1960, she was already described as "the saint of Calcutta," and "a 
living saint." 
</P>
<P>
In 1963, she co-founded, with Brother Andrew Travers-Ball, a former Jesuit, the 
Brothers of Charity; in 1969, she founded the Co-Workers, a lay group devoted 
to prayer and good works and helping Mother Teresa. In the 1970s, she formed 
contemplative branches of her orders, for those who would remove themselves 
from the public for a life of perpetual prayer and meditation. In 1984, she 
formed an order of priests, most of whom are now working in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Wherever her followers work, what has come to be known as "the Calcutta model" 
prevails. But it is a model many say does not translate to American reality. 
</P>
<P>
It is what prompted Unsworth to call Mother Teresa "a great woman, of terrific 
faith," but add that he considers her model, "for another country, another 
century." 
</P>
<P>
All members of Catholic religious orders take vows of chastity, obedience and 
poverty. There is a general avoidance of lavish living, and the poverty vow has 
meant the individual owns no personal property and turns any income over to the 
order. 
</P>
<P>
The Missionaries of Charity take a fourth vow, "whole-hearted free service to 
the poorest of the poor -- to Christ in his distressing disguise." 
</P>
<P>
As she has branched out from Calcutta to the rest of the world, Mother Teresa 
has incorporated spiritual and emotional poverty into her definition of the 
"poorest of the poor," observing that in many industrialized societies, 
including the United States, those are the greatest and worst forms of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
Her followers, the sisters especially, have adopted an austere lifestyle, one 
that has its roots in Calcutta. Their belongings are limited to two saris. They 
sleep on mats, wash clothes and bedding by hand, eschew hot water, kneel and 
sit on the chapel floor. In their commitment to this simplicity, they have 
dismayed and, at times, offended some Americans, including parishioners who 
have lovingly readied a convent for them to occupy, only to have the sisters 
arrive and remove pews, rip up carpeting, even remove hot-water heaters and 
some plumbing. They forgo labor-saving devices such as vacuum cleaners, washing 
machines and dryers, and engage in much mopping and scrubbing. 
</P>
<P>
The convent in Lynwood, part of St. Emydius parish, serves as home to four 
sisters and functions as a maternity home. Single pregnant women and mothers 
who have recently delivered, plus their other children, are in residence, 
staying for several months, until they can make more permanent arrangements. In 
the kitchen there is a gaping hole where the washing machine used to be. The 
garden and picnic area is used to dry the huge amounts of laundry. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, four nuns from another order sat over dinner at a private home in Los 
Angeles, listening to the fate of the washing machine in Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
"That is a very easy way to be holy," said one of them, a European-born woman 
in her 60s. Shaking her head gently, she asked, "What is your greatest treasure 
in the United States? Your time. It is your time you need to give people, and 
if you're busying yourselves with tasks like that, you will have little time to 
truly deal with people who need you." 
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning, however, Mother Teresa has been adamant about the 
importance of austerity and manual labor. "If luxury creeps in," she has said, 
"we lose the spirit of the order." 
</P>
<P>
The brothers have been in Los Angeles since 1975. Their services to the poor 
seem more relaxed and less dominated by rules than those the sisters offer. 
They now are working with homeless Latino youths, reaching out to them in areas 
such as MacArthur Park, and providing a day center in the Pico Union area, 
where Brother Joseph McLagham and volunteers offer meals to about 75 young 
people a day, showers, and a place to watch television and relax. The brothers 
also provide limited housing for mentally and physically disabled people, and 
Brother Luke Packel provides a home for a handful of youngsters who have no 
families but are in school. 
</P>
<P>
More than lifestyle, however, the Calcutta model also refers to a way of 
relating to the poor. In San Francisco, the sisters operate a soup kitchen, a 
home for unwed mothers and a residence for people with AIDS; in Lynwood, they 
run the maternity home. 
</P>
<P>
The rules are strict, made to accommodate the lifestyle of the sisters, not the 
guests. In Lynwood, the residents may have visitors once a week, for one hour 
on Sunday afternoons. They may come and go during the day from 9 to 11:30 a.m. 
and from 3 to 4:30 p.m. Children are in bed by 8:30 p.m.; lights are out in the 
common room by 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Because the sisters live without radios, televisions and record players, there 
are none for those they help, although in the AIDS residences in San Francisco 
and New York patients are now permitted to have radios with earphones. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Sister Sylvia, who is from India, commented briefly on their 
lifestyle, saying "We try more or less to have the same kind of life as in 
India," but added that they were sensitive to cultural differences. 
</P>
<P>
"People with whom we work may be of different experience. So here, instead of 
rice, we may have soup. There, they eat with their hand, here we give a spoon." 
</P>
<P>
Despite such adjustments, many of their measures sound harsh, but the sisters 
find a spiritual value in accepting poverty, sacrifice and suffering. They see 
them as a way to atone for sin, not necessarily one's own, and please God. 
Mother Teresa herself, for example, was hospitalized for heart trouble in the 
early 1980s. She refused all pain medication, saying she preferred to offer up 
her suffering to Christ. 
</P>
<P>
It is that philosophy, perhaps, that has caused concern among health-care 
providers and social workers in the Bay Area. Although Sister Sylvia said all 
residents are given all medications prescribed by their doctors, several nurses 
and social workers who work with AIDS patients say they often hear complaints 
that residents of Gift of Love, a private facility, are discouraged from taking 
pain medication. 
</P>
<P>
That, the refusal to allow television, the unbending rules and the schedule, 
seem harsh to the professionals. Moreover, they say, there is an attitude of 
discomfort or disapproval that the sisters convey, stemming from the Church's 
condemnation of homosexual activity. 
</P>
<P>
Familiar with the widespread concern and complaints, Dr. Sandra Hernandez, who 
directs the AIDS office at the Public Health Department in San Francisco, said, 
"In the type of facility this is, a typical hospice or residence, pain control 
is a value. Typically (care providers) want to make sure people are not in 
pain." 
</P>
<P>
In general, Hernandez said of the hospice, "I have two sentiments. There is a 
tremendous need for hospice and terminal care and the fact they are doing this, 
I commend. . . . My biggest concern is for a person in a program in the 
terminal phase of life. To have someone attempt to teach repentance, to be told 
to evaluate one's life from the point of view of Catholic morality is 
disconcerting. . . . For some people it may be perfectly appropriate. I would 
hope our city could provide appropriate care for all." 
</P>
<P>
The brothers run a day center in Oakland for people with AIDS. Brother Jeremy 
Hollinger, regional servant (superior) and founder of the center, said Mother 
Teresa has visited the center. 
</P>
<P>
"We had only a positive experience with her. She has a healing presence, a sign 
of hope and love and people pick that up. I don't know how to put it, an aura, 
energy, sanctity? . . . Where you run into a problem is not with Mother Teresa 
herself, but in how you translate who she is and what she does into an 
institution and working under her name. Sometimes others do not have her depth 
of vision, so you get a rigidity," he said. "I hope, we've taken what she is 
and brought it into an institutional setting." 
</P>
<P>
Without commenting on the criticisms about Gift of Love, he said it was 
important to remember what Mother Teresa had brought about within the Catholic 
Church concerning AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"(She) made AIDS acceptable to Catholics. She's said, 'When you're busy judging 
people you have no time to love them.' Every person with AIDS is Jesus, so you 
can say, Jesus has AIDS. If Jesus in his most distressing disguise, as she 
says, is on Skid Row, then AIDS is his most clever disguise." 
</P>
<P>
Neither retirement nor death can banish Mother Teresa from worldwide 
consciousness. If the world has already unofficially canonized her, there are 
those who think the Church will cut corners in the long formal process and 
proclaim her a saint "by acclamation" as soon as she dies. 
</P>
<P>
Mother Teresa herself, who is not without a sense of humor, has frequently cut 
short the talk of her canonization with dry advice: "Let me die first." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, she lives, inspiring and disturbing many, containing in her 
something of a paradox, perhaps because people want her to be all things. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's fair to Mother Teresa to have canonized her," said Sister 
Jacinta Fiebig, a Holy Family sister who works at the Oakland AIDS center. 
"We're all broken, and we have to look at our own brokenness and accept it. But 
we don't allow Mother Teresa to be broken. By canonizing her as perfect, we see 
what she does as the perfect model. It's not the only way. You want to call her 
a saint? Fine. There are a lot of other saints out there, too."

A MAJOR DEAL MAKER OF THE '80S IS DROWNING IN DEBT IN THE '90S; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCE: WILLIAM F. FARLEY'S HOT STREAK HAS COOLED ALONG WITH JUNK BONDS. AND 
HIS PLANS FOR WEST POINT-PEPPERELL HAVE STALLED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CINDY SKRZYCKI, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Down in West Point, Ga., the townsfolk are wondering what ever happened to the 
Bill Farley who strutted up and down their streets, pumped their hands and 
convinced them that he would watch over West Point-Pepperell Inc., the 
community's pride and joy. 
</P>
<P>
"When he comes to town, the women swoon over him," said Terrell Whaley, manager 
of WCJM radio in West Point, where he has been putting town news out on the 
airways and over the grapevine for 30 years. "They say he looks like a movie 
star." 
</P>
<P>
But now, a year after Chicago industrialist William F. Farley took control of 
the local textile manufacturer, his complex corporate network is drowning in 
debt. Farley has still not been able to complete his takeover of Pepperell, and 
his star is fading in the Georgia and Alabama towns that grew up around a 
cluster of Pepperell mills. 
</P>
<P>
People in West Point don't see much of Farley these days, and when he does drop 
by Pepperell, the rumor mill races. Whaley said Farley was sighted in the local 
Wal-Mart last week. A shopper rushed up to him, shook his hand and asked him 
for a job. As the story goes around town, Farley said with a laugh, "I may need 
one before too long." 
</P>
<P>
Whaley calls Farley's plight "being up to your behind in alligators." Others 
view Farley's predicament as a symbol of the financial excesses of the 1980s 
that came to a quick end this year with the collapse of junk bond marketer 
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the architect of several of Farley's major deals. 
</P>
<P>
Starting with a $25,000 down payment in 1976, Farley became one of the bright 
stars of the past decade's takeover wave, building a smorgasbord of companies 
that has included underwear maker Fruit of the Loom Inc., and manufacturers of 
car batteries and fasteners and automotive die castings. 
</P>
<P>
"Farley is a creature of the times," said James Grant, editor of Grant's 
Interest Rate Observer, a financial publication that was skeptical of the 
Pepperell deal early on. "As a champion debtor, he was an exemplar of the boom, 
and he is a specimen of the decline." 
</P>
<P>
Now, at 47, Farley has most everything that matters to him at risk: his 
controlling stake in Fruit of the Loom, his relationship with lenders and 
investors, and his public reputation, which he once hoped would carry him into 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
"Down here in the South, we have never understood highly leveraged situations," 
said Scott Huguley, president of First National Bank in downtown West Point. 
"It's not in our general course of business." 
</P>
<P>
Not so for Farley. Debt was a way of life for him long before leveraged buyouts 
and assets sales became the way to do big deals. 
</P>
<P>
His first acquisition 14 years ago was done mostly with borrowed money, but his 
biggest plunge came with his $2.5-billion hostile takeover of Pepperell, the 
nation's largest publicly held textile company. He jolted he locals last year 
when he ousted Pepperell Chairman Joseph Lanier Jr., whose paternalistic family 
had run the company for generations. 
</P>
<P>
Farley was disdainful at the time of doubters and told a home furnishings 
publication: "I think one of the things that puzzles them is how I am going to 
modernize and expand with all that debt. I think that puzzles people beyond 
their comfort zones. But just take a look at Fruit." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Farley is in the thick of negotiations with banks and bondholders that are 
owed $1.5 billion by a Farley subsidiary set up to acquire the textile company. 
Pepperell itself carries a substantial debt load from its takeover of J. P. 
Stevens &amp; Co., though it is not impaired by Farley's other troubles, 
according to financial analysts. 
</P>
<P>
Farley also needs to complete the buyout of Pepperell to tap the company's cash 
to meet loan and interest payments. The cost of buying the remaining 5% of the 
company at $58 a share -- the price Farley paid for the rest of the company -- 
is $83 million. 
</P>
<P>
Farley was depending on Drexel to raise enough money to complete the 
acquisition, but the collapse of Drexel and the junk bond market overtook that 
plan. Selling off parts of Pepperell also has not proceeded as planned. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, banks and bondholders will decide Farley's fate. Among the 
possibilities are bankruptcy, or a restructuring that could include a severely 
diminished role for him at Pepperell. Another is that he would have to sell 
some of his stake in Fruit of the Loom. 
</P>
<P>
One plan that Farley reportedly has floated is for holders of certain bonds and 
preferred stock to take a 65% equity interest in a new company called West 
Point Holdings in exchange for deferred and lowered interest rate payments. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Kidder Peabody &amp; Co., the firm that bondholders have 
hired to represent them, had no comment on the negotiations. George Fasel, a 
spokesman for Bankers Trust Co., one of the banks involved in the loan end of 
the transaction, said: "The banks, bondholders and Farley people are chewing it 
over." 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believe that Farley's optimistic nature and appetite for risk may 
have led him down this road. Others assume his ego got the best of him and his 
better business judgment, leading him to overestimate the market for selling 
off pieces of Pepperell, to fail to foresee the collapse of the junk bond 
market and to overpay for the company. 
</P>
<P>
"Farley is different from you and me," Grant said. "He is a man who was not 
content with a fair number of millions of dollars. It makes him different and 
somewhat appealing. He was trying to build something." 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe believing he could do too much is his tragic flaw," said Angela Uttaro, 
an analyst with Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., which lowered the ratings last 
February on $1.14 billion worth of a mixture of Farley debt issues. 
</P>
<P>
But close friends and associates of Farley don't underestimate his ability to 
pull a rabbit out of the hat. Because of his considerable charm, he always has 
had a large cheering section. Those who have watched him in action most often 
characterize him as smart, aggressive, charismatic and persuasive when it comes 
to getting his way. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy runs at 100 miles per hour," said one former business acquaintance. 
"I wouldn't count him out. And if he is knocked out on this one, he'll be back 
in the ring in a month." 
</P>
<P>
Those who knew him when he was a scholarship student and athlete at Bowdoin 
College in Maine studying government also have faith in him. 
</P>
<P>
"Knowing Billy, it's something he will come out of," said his football coach at 
Bowdoin, Sid Watson. "It doesn't seem to affect him. He can borrow $600 million 
and still sleep at night." 
</P>
<P>
Borrowing heavily but blithely is a skill Farley acquired early on. The son of 
a Pawtucket, R.I., mail carrier, Farley dreamed about being rich as a young man 
and set tough goals for himself. 
</P>
<P>
"It was clear from the first that Bill had a vision of where he wanted to be a 
ways down the road -- far more than other people," said Ilan Kaufthal, who 
worked with Farley early in his career and now is managing director of mergers 
and acquisitions at Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co., an investment banking firm. 
"He had a longer view of what he wanted to be." 
</P>
<P>
Once Farley finished Boston College Law School and hit the road to sell 
encyclopedias door-to-door, his appetite for deals was whetted when he went to 
work for the mergers and acquisitions department of NL Industries in New York. 
Soon after, he went to Lehman Bros. in Chicago where he bought his first 
company, Anaheim Citrus, from his old employer for $1.7 million. He put in 
$25,000 and borrowed the rest, the first indication that he could live with 
extremely high debt-to-equity ratios. 
</P>
<P>
After a near bankruptcy with Baumfolder Inc. and failed purchase of Condec, a 
small defense contractor, Farley finally became a player with the buyout of 
Northwest Industries, a Chicago-based conglomerate that owned Fruit of the 
Loom. 
</P>
<P>
Farley concentrated on skivvies, turning Fruit of the Loom into a leading 
producer of underwear and sports clothing. He invested heavily in the company's 
plants and marketing. He boosted sales, employment and profits and held the 
success story up as proof that the same could be done for Pepperell, a company 
that already was prospering. 
</P>
<P>
He came to love the spotlight. He appeared in Fruit of the Loom commercials, 
showing off his well-toned body. He invested millions of dollars in ads that 
emphasized quality and American competitiveness. He spoke to the Georgia 
Legislature after he bagged the Pepperell deal and was squired around town by 
West Point's mayor. 
</P>
<P>
He talked to anyone who would listen, developed a taste for the finer things in 
life such as vacation homes and corporate jets, and preached wellness to his 
employees, who could pump iron or run a few laps at lunch in athletic 
facilities that Farley put in his plants. 
</P>
<P>
West Point residents learned quickly that Farley is picky about his diet and 
careful about his waistline. During a stop to the local frozen yogurt shop, he 
refused to have a milkshake made with whole milk. He sent his chauffeur to the 
Win-Dixie supermarket nearby to buy some skim milk for the shake. 
</P>
<P>
Now a deathly silence has fallen over Farley. 
</P>
<P>
Interviews have been cut off, the company switchboard operator screens calls 
for him, and the public relations department does not return phone calls. 
Neither company officials nor Farley would comment for this article. 
</P>
<P>
Always known as a man with political aspirations, Farley closed his Washington 
office last week. His longtime loyalist and right-hand man, Jack Albertine, 
resigned from the company to start a consulting firm of his own with his 
brother, James, and another former business associate. 
</P>
<P>
Financial analysts who have been scrutinizing Farley's balance sheets think 
bankruptcy can be avoided and that he may even hold the keys to the store, as 
one source in the Chicago financial community observed. Bankruptcy would be 
expensive for everyone and make a big loser of the banks and bondholders 
involved in the Pepperell deal. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever shape the restructuring takes, almost everyone agrees Farley will have 
to be ready for big givebacks and concessions. Said Standard &amp; Poor's 
Uttaro, "He needs to buy a few miracles."

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They wanted to do something special for him. It was his 40th birthday, a time 
in life when a man's supposed to let go of youth and saunter into middle-age. 
They decided to have a night that would kick off the rest of his life in style. 
</P>
<P>
So his wife and friends racked their brains, trying to come up with the perfect 
party. He's worth millions, so money was going to be no problem. They could 
have as elegant a party as they desired, or have the most raucous party 
Hollywood has seen in a while. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, the size, should it be a huge party with invitations to all of 
Tom's friends and acquaintances, maybe a bash for 500? No, his wife, Jill, 
said, Tom doesn't like big parties. 
</P>
<P>
OK, how about a small ritzy party in a ballroom at some Beverly Hills hotel? 
No, sorry, Jill said, Tom doesn't like to get dressed up. 
</P>
<P>
All right, how about renting a few limousines, and just bopping around town to 
a restaurant, followed by a nightclub or two? No, Jill said, you know how Tom 
doesn't like to make a scene in public. 
</P>
<P>
Charter a plane and head for Las Vegas? Nope. 
</P>
<P>
So just what kind of party did they end up throwing for this guy? 
</P>
<P>
"Can you believe it," said Paul Schulman, one of his best friends, "we ended up 
going to the UCLA bowling alley. We rented it out for the night, and had about 
30, 35 people. We sang 'Happy Birthday' and 'Take me out to the ballgame.' He 
had the time of his life." 
</P>
<P>
Are you insinuating that Tom Werner, the man who soon officially will become 
the chairman and managing partner of the Padres, the man who has made millions 
by being one of the most successful producers in the TV industry and helped 
create the Cliff Huxtable family, would actually enjoy something so hokey? 
</P>
<P>
"Hey," Schulman said, "this guy would prefer spending his Thursday nights 
watching a ballgame on TV than going to the Emmy Awards. You don't see him 
shopping at Gucci or wearing Giorgio (Armani), hanging around with the stars, 
or any of that kind of stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd never know from talking to him about the type of wealth he has, the type 
of talent he has, or anything like that. He's one of the most unpretentious men 
you'll ever meet. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why you hardly ever see him attend Hollywood-type functions, because he 
hates them." 
</P>
<P>
So when Werner and his nine partners are approved by Major League Baseball -- 
which according to sources on the ownership screening committee could be within 
two weeks -- don't bother looking for a guy dressed in a pinstripe suit coming 
out of a stretch limousine. 
</P>
<P>
He'll be the guy wearing the sweatshirt, coming out of a two-year-old Ford 
Mustang convertible, holding a pennant in his hand. 
</P>
<P>
Yes sir, if you want a baseball fan running your club, you've got one. 
</P>
<P>
OK, so he has been a Dodger fan for the past 20 years, and was a Yankee fan 
growing up. Don't hold it against him. Just wait, pretty soon he'll be getting 
into that Padre spirit and hating Dodger blue. 
</P>
<P>
Just talk to the folks at Carsey-Werner Co., the top independent television 
production company in the industry, and they'll tell you just how much Werner 
cares about the Padres. Sure, he's still busily producing "The Cosby Show," 
"Roseanne," "A Different World" and "Grand." And everyone will tell you how 
this is the busiest time of year in the business, a time in which senior 
executives frantically are screening pilots, with the networks just a week away 
from announcing their fall lineups. 
</P>
<P>
So what's Werner doing? 
</P>
<P>
Sneaking away and tuning in Padre games on his short-wave radio, and acting 
like a school kid all over again every time the Padres win or lose. 
</P>
<P>
"You should see us, we're wearing our San Diego Padre caps in the office now," 
said Marcy Carsey, 44, Werner's partner in the company. "I never even cared 
about sports before. I couldn't even tell you the names of any baseball 
players. But now, for the first time in my life, I'm reading the sports pages, 
listening to sports reports, and everything." 
</P>
<P>
Is the Padre schedule hanging on the office wall, too? 
</P>
<P>
"No, there's no need for that," Carsey said, "we've all got it memorized by 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, all of Werner's friends knew just how much he adored the game of 
baseball. After all, the man doesn't have a bat and glove in his closet, play 
on a softball team while mixing in an occasional hardball game, help coach his 
14-year-old son's Little League team, regularly attend his 11-year-old 
daughter's softball games, participate in rotisserie leagues, and own Dodger 
season tickets for the past 10 years, without being fanatical about the game. 
</P>
<P>
But it caught all of them by surprise when they found out he was planning to 
lead a group of 10 men willing to spend $75 million to buy the Padres from Joan 
Kroc. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was the kinkiest thing I'd heard in months," Carsey said. "There 
were a lot of people trying to talk him out of it, but then again, a lot of 
people tried to talk us out of going off to start our own production company, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom gave me all of the reasons on the negative side, and then he gave me all 
of the reasons on the positive side. My advice to him was, 'Chance-taking is 
the stuff of life, and you're rooting for the positive side, so go and do it.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Now, six months after Werner began seriously inquiring about purchasing the 
Padres, and six weeks after learning that Kroc had accepted his group's offer, 
his lifelong dream is about to become reality. 
</P>
<P>
Werner and nine partners met with Kroc and attorney Beth Benes again last 
Monday, and now are just waiting for the completion of financial reports to 
finalize the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"What I understand, everything is just fine," said Milwaukee Brewer owner Bud 
Selig, who's on the ownership screening committee. "I'd be stunned if this 
wasn't approved. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody's really looking forward to his involvement. I haven't met 
the gentleman yet, but all I keep hearing is what a wonderful guy he is." 
</P>
<P>
Werner already has begun delegating authority to members of his group, and 
several planning meetings have taken place, with the latest this past 
Wednesday, but he continues to seek input from his partners. 
</P>
<P>
Werner couldn't care less that he has invested the most money in the group -- 
about $25 million of his net worth of an estimated $150 million -- and that 
several of the partners have limited shares. Everyone's an equal partner, he 
tells them, the only difference being that he has the final say. 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing in his background that reveals any baseball expertise -- unless 
you count his intramural playing days at Harvard -- but those who know him say 
he's quite confident in his abilities to run a major league franchise. And he 
doesn't need any of Kroc's former son-in-laws to help him. 
</P>
<P>
Werner, in fact, already has decided, according to four members of the 
ownership group, that he will not retain Jerry Kapstein. Kapstein was in charge 
of the club's operations for several months while it was being sold, but left 
the position three weeks ago when Kroc's daughter, Linda Smith, filed for 
divorce from him. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Werner has told friends that he will retain President Dick Freeman, 
and does not plan to make any front-office changes for at least the remainder 
of this season. 
</P>
<P>
Werner knows that several decisions will soon have to be made: Will Manager 
Jack McKeon, who assumed the role of vice president/baseball operations at 
Kroc's request in December, be provided a dual contract, leave the field and 
become the club's top front-office executive, or remain simply as manager? Will 
he attempt to sign first baseman Jack Clark, catcher Benito Santiago and second 
baseman Roberto Alomar to multi-year contracts, avoiding arbitration? Will he 
rip up outfielder Tony Gwynn's contract, and pay him the going-market rate? 
Will he put beer back in the clubhouse? 
</P>
<P>
Those decisions simply will have to wait, and likely will not be made until the 
end of the season. In the meantime, his wife already has been to San Diego 
several times on several house-hunting excursions, an office is being prepared 
for the ownership group at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, and operating plans 
quietly are being made. 
</P>
<P>
The hardest part now is just the wait. Werner knows he's about to become 
chairman of the Padres, and he has been told to expect ratification by the 
major league owners at the end of the month in a conference call. But yet, he's 
still not owner, and until he is, he won't allow himself to be interviewed by 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
After all, it was just three years ago when it was announced the Padres were to 
be sold to George Argyros, and five months ago when Sid and Jenny Craig told 
friends that they would be the new owners. 
</P>
<P>
"He just wants to be very careful right now," said a family friend, who spoke 
only on the condition of anonymity. "He doesn't want to say anything that could 
be misconstrued. But I can't tell you how excited he is." 
</P>
<P>
Well, the boys in the ownership group already are getting the picture. 
</P>
<P>
"It was during the last home stand when I got a call at about 9:30 one night," 
said attorney Scott Wolfe, one of the partners who lives in San Diego. "It was 
Tom. It was 12:30 New York time, but he wanted to know what was going on in the 
game. I told him the score, and that we were losing. You know what? He stayed 
on the phone the rest of the game, and I was giving him play-by-play. 
</P>
<P>
"He's taking these games pretty hard, I know. Jill, his wife, keeps telling 
him, 'Tom, there's 162 games, you can't win all of them.' But I think we're all 
going through the same stage right now. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom's a very intense man, very intense. We don't want him to get a heart 
attack over these games." 
</P>
<P>
It's this same intensity, and desire to excel, however, that has helped Werner 
become one of the most successful businessmen in the TV industry. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't enough, his friends say, that he graduated cum laude in 1971 from 
Harvard. It wasn't enough that he began producing award-winning documentaries 
early in his career such as "Shirley Chisholm: Pursuing the Dream." It wasn't 
enough that he had a meteoric rise through ABC, ultimately becoming senior vice 
president at the network. And now, as we're finding out, it's not enough to be 
the hottest TV producer in television, who with partner Carsey, just sold 
syndicated Cosby reruns for a reported record price of $515 million. 
</P>
<P>
No sir, Werner wants to be one of the best baseball owners in the business, 
too, providing the community of San Diego the National League's version of the 
Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
"He definitely wants that franchise to be of championship caliber," Schulman 
said. "It's definitely going to benefit with his involvement. He's going to run 
it like a business, and you can see how his own business has done. 
</P>
<P>
"I know he's a little worried with the way salaries are going up. He can live 
with the Jack Clarks and Joe Carters making $2 and $3 million, but what bothers 
him is that the average ball player is making so much money." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, Werner's friends say, if he just was interested in making money, he 
sure wouldn't be investing in a baseball team. The Padres, according to 
sources, made $4.2 million last year, but because of rising salaries and 
escalating expenses, the Padres have estimated that a 2.5 million attendance 
base is needed to break even in 1990. The Padres will receive about $15.2 
million in national and local broadcasting revenues, but their player payroll, 
according to sources, is about $17.5 million, with an overall operating budget 
of about $34 million. 
</P>
<P>
It's unknown just how much the new ownership group will have to pay in 
collusion damages, or if the purchase price requires Kroc to pay the fines. But 
they should receive about $12.5 million within the next two years when the 
National League expands by two teams. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing to Tom, and to all of us," said Art Rivkin, who'll be one of 
three vice-chairmans, "is to run a first-class operation and to continue to 
improve it. There's a lot of civic participation involved, and we want to make 
it a team that this community will be proud of. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we'll do that, and pick up where Mrs. Kroc left off." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, if not for Werner's involvement, members of the ownership group say, they 
likely never would have purchased the team. The eight-member San Diego group 
had qualified under Kroc's guidelines for purchasing the team, just as Werner 
and partner Russell Goldsmith of Los Angeles had. But if not for the link 
between the two groups, the club likely would be sold to Los Angeles King owner 
Bruce McNall, who turned down an invitation by Werner to join his group, or 
some other entity. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a perfect match," Wolfe said. "He was looking for a very strong local 
group, and a group willing to invest and share in the ownership. We were 
looking for a managing partner. It wasn't necessarily the money, but nobody 
wanted to do this alone, without having someone designated to run it." 
</P>
<P>
Still, there was skepticism. Lots of it. It was bad enough that this guy was 
from Los Angeles, but being in the Hollywood business, Werner represented 
everything they disdain about the city. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, there was initial concern," said Art Engel, vice-chairman, who was the 
first of the San Diego group to meet Werner. "What we didn't want to happen was 
absentee ownership. And we didn't want any Hollywood flair using this as a 
springboard for something else." 
</P>
<P>
Said Wolfe: "Right away, we could tell he was different from the typical 
Hollywood type. He wasn't showy. He wasn't some big self-promoter. He just 
wasn't what we thought he'd be. He was very down-to-earth, very honest, and 
very concerned about our community. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to be said that we sold out to L.A., and we sure didn't want 
this to be another Al Davis situation. 
</P>
<P>
"By the end of our first meeting, we were in love with the guy. We couldn't 
have picked anyone better." 
</P>
<P>
In February, Wolfe approached Kapstein and Kroc, telling them that the two 
groups were merging. Within six weeks, they had a deal. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole transaction kept Tommy pretty busy," one friend said, "but he really 
wasn't that nervous about it. If someone came in with a bid a lot larger than 
his, he thought, so be it, that was the way it was meant to be. He just didn't 
want to lose out to someone whose offer was relatively close to his." 
</P>
<P>
The original offer, according to one of the prospective owners, was less than 
$60 million. Yet, although sources say Kroc and Benes were willing to accept 
the offer, Kapstein kept holding out for more, until they reached the $75 
million purchase price -- $25 million less than Kapstein originally sought. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny, we've known each other about 22 years," said Goldsmith, who's 
chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Republic Pictures Corp,. 
and director of City National Bank, "but we never even thought something like 
this was possible until a couple of years ago. The more we talked about it, the 
more we thought it was a good idea. And when we found out that the Padres were 
up for sale, we thought it was perfect; a great city, a great franchise, and a 
National League team. It was everything we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Werner discussed the idea with his wife and friends for weeks, soliciting their 
opinions. Most of them told Werner he was crazy. Think of the headaches, they 
said. Think of the time. Think of the risk. 
</P>
<P>
Funny, that's exactly what his friends told him nine years ago when he left a 
lucrative job with ABC to join Carsey. They took second mortgages on their 
homes. Their office consisted of a room atop a 7-Eleven store in Westwood. 
Phone bills often were paid late. 
</P>
<P>
They struggled at the outset, producing a series called, "Oh, Madeline,!" which 
soon was cancelled by ABC, and a TV movie called "Single Bars, Single Women," 
which also flopped. 
</P>
<P>
Then, they were introduced to Bill Cosby. He told them how he wanted to create 
a half-hour comedy casting himself as a janitor and his TV wife as a 
construction worker. Carsey and Werner said no, and proposed that Cosby be the 
head of an upper middle-class family, and do away with the stereotypical black 
family. 
</P>
<P>
They offered the show to ABC, and were turned down. "They told us comedy was 
dead," Carsey said. They offered it to NBC. They took it, and in large part 
because of "The Cosby Show," have become the top-rated network in the land. 
</P>
<P>
Werner and Carsey since have produced "Roseanne," "A Different World" and 
"Grand." They're all top 20 shows, with Cosby, Roseanne and Different World 
finishing 1-2-3 last season. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why Tom's very confident he can make this work," said an employee of 
Carsey-Werner. "He knows what kind of quality people want, and he definitely 
knows audiences. He knows he has a tremendous challenge, but like he always 
says, 'No guts, no glory.' 
</P>
<P>
"He's already told us, he plans to make the Padres the best organization in 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Hmm, so Werner should be one proud man standing in the owners' box night after 
night? 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth," Schulman said, "I can't see him sitting up there. 
He'll be down in the stands with his popcorn and coke, yelling like everyone 
else."

Now he's back as "The Westwood Strangler." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Perlman, who portrayed Vincent in CBS-TV's "Beauty and the Beast," until 
its cancellation last year, has resurfaced on stage in the new dark comedy 
"Self Storage" at the Odyssey Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
He wanted to play the slimy Hollywood agent or the upstart producer in this 
spoof of the film industry. Instead, director Dan Lauria (the father on "Wonder 
Years") gave him the part of Cliff, an unsuccessful actor masquerading as a 
serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I would have done the play without Ron," Lauria said. "I can't 
imagine anyone else doing that role. You needed someone who could make a joke 
out of the role. Otherwise, the audience doesn't get it." 
</P>
<P>
Cliff is a scary sight, with his scruffy beard and staggering gait -- a far cry 
from elegant Vincent. Perlman adores him anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"I find I'm really starting to dig him," Perlman said. "I didn't dig him at 
first, but . . . I understand him now. I'm going to wind up loving him by the 
time it's over." 
</P>
<P>
In Cliff, Perlman sees a part of himself -- the struggling, victimized actor. 
That seems like a strange comment from a man who has attained more fame and 
earned more money than he ever imagined. He has worked three years on a 
television series, acted in several feature films ("Quest for Fire," "The Name 
of the Rose"), received two Emmy nominations and won the 1988 Golden Globe 
Award for best actor in a dramatic series. 
</P>
<P>
At 40, Perlman retains the actor's insecurities. "This part scared me. I really 
didn't think I'd be able to come up with what it took to play the role," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He recalled thinking, "They're going to find me out; I'm going to stink out the 
joint." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he doesn't worry as much anymore about audience reaction, he 
said. Before, when he didn't give his best performance, Perlman used to eat -- 
a lot. 
</P>
<P>
"I've spent 22 years acting for other people," he said. "Now, I'm getting so 
old that I don't care. It doesn't destroy me if people don't like it. I work 
for my friends, and I figure if me and my friends like it, then maybe other 
people will, too. It's a tremendously liberating period for an artist." 
</P>
<P>
Time also has liberated Perlman. Free from the rigorous schedule of a weekly 
television series, he is able to pursue other acting possibilities. "It's nice 
to move on, nice to know I can flex other muscles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He blames no one for the beast's demise. He thinks someday there might be a 
feature film based on the show's characters. 
</P>
<P>
"We were always teetering on the edge of acceptability," Perlman said, "and 
then we teetered the wrong direction. I'm surprised at the tremendous success 
that the show had. I liked it. I liked all the things I was involved in, but 
none of them made money." 
</P>
<P>
In "Self Storage," Perlman is working for almost no pay. The production is the 
second installment of a four-play series sponsored by Patchett-Kaufman 
Entertainment to develop projects that might be turned into sitcoms or movies. 
</P>
<P>
Perlman said that although he applauds PKE's efforts to produce high-quality 
theater -- Lauria essentially runs the project -- he has a little trouble with 
the concept: "The purpose of it is crossover, the fact we're doing theater that 
might have an afterlife. . . . I'm doing this because I think it's a funny 
play." 
</P>
<P>
Perlman complains that pure theater is dying out. "People are doing sitcoms on 
stage rather than theater. You go to a theater, and it's as if you were 
watching a sitcom at 8:30 on Channel 4." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether "Self Storage" might contain some of the same sitcom material he 
loathes, Perlman said: "There's satire in it, which is a much more 
sophisticated form than pure sitcom." 
</P>
<P>
Perlman said he thought moving from television to theater would be more 
difficult but that he has relied on his stage experience to ease the 
transition. He has performed on and off Broadway, playing the lead in the New 
York premieres of "The Architect" and "The Emperor of Assyria." He has also 
performed the works of Shakespeare, Ibsen, Chekhov, Pinter and Beckett. 
</P>
<P>
Finding Cliff, he said, has been tougher than playing most characters. Usually, 
when assuming a role, Perlman tries to find an actual person to model himself 
after or part of the fictional character within himself. For "Self Storage," he 
went for the theatrics first and adapted Cliff to that. Much of his role is 
physical -- stumbling across stage, speaking occasionally in grunts, staring 
like a ferocious beast. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to find what it is in that person that you love in order to play 
him," Perlman said, "no matter how psychotic he is." 
</P>
<P>
 "Self Storage" plays at 8 p.m. Thursday through Sunday through May 27 at the 
Odyssey Theatre, 2055 S. Sepulveda Blvd. Ticket prices are $15 Thursdays and 
Sundays; $17.50 Fridays and Saturdays. A special discount ticket of $10 is 
available to senior citizens and students. For information, call (213) 
477-2055.

"Ah, that's our mockingbird," Helen Hayes says. She is sitting on the porch of 
the white Victorian house she and Charles MacArthur bought nearly 60 years ago. 
There is indeed a lovely liquid trilling to be heard in the trees. "He likes to 
join the conversation," she says. 
</P>
<P>
It is a warm spring morning but the sun has not yet burned the haze off the 
Hudson below, giving the river a soft and timeless look that you can imagine 
Ichabod Crane and boatloads of patroons gazed upon in their time. 
</P>
<P>
In the '60s, having lost both her husband and her daughter Mary and with her 
actor son James MacArthur newly married and living elsewhere, Hayes put the 
house, with its 18 rooms and its tall and spacious windows providing stunning 
views of the river, up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Local rowdies were sneaking into the swimming pool on the slope below the house 
at midnight and having raucous beer and sex parties. But her neighbors were so 
appalled at the idea of her leaving that they picketed the house. The 
developers who had planned to buy and convert it were scared off; the town got 
its rowdies under control and Helen Hayes continues to have the joy of her 
memento-filled home. 
</P>
<P>
"My paintings are the Hudson River School," she says. "I sold all my snob 
paintings years ago -- long before their prices went crazy, as is my wont." 
</P>
<P>
Helen Hayes is one of the glories of American acting, a link in her lifetime 
and theirs between the theater of Lew Fields and Victor Herbert and of Eugene 
O'Neill and Tennessee Williams (the two greatest, she believes). In a country 
and a profession that loves superlatives, she was being called "the first lady 
of the American theater" in the mid-'30s, after her triumph as Queen Victoria 
in "Victoria Regina." It made her uncomfortable, she says, because there were a 
few other first ladies around, among them Laurette Taylor, Katherine Cornell 
and Ina Claire. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes will be 90 in October and she says with considerable firmness that she is 
retired. Late-blooming asthma cut short her stage career. "I've been deprived 
of that," she says sadly. And while there are still polite inquiries from films 
and television, she says, "I wouldn't take a part. I've never been happy with 
anything I've ever done that I could see later. Acting for that little red 
light -- oooooh! I watch things on the little screen and I say, 'Oh, why didn't 
they let me do that again?' " 
</P>
<P>
Early in her career she was under contract to MGM but she never really felt at 
home in Hollywood. When the contract was up, she left with relief. "I don't 
think I'm much good in pictures," she said at the time, "and I have this 
beautiful dream that I'm elegant on stage." Yet she won an Academy Award as 
best actress for her first screen role in "The Sin of Madelon Claudet" in 1931 
and another as best supporting actress for her role as the stowaway in 
"Airport" in 1970 -- a span which is at least one measure of one of the longest 
and most honored careers in American acting. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes has just now published an autobiography -- "Helen Hayes: My Life in Three 
Acts" (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich: $19.95) -- written in collaboration with 
Katherine Hatch, a friend who lives in Cuernavaca, where Hayes also has a house 
and spends part of the year. 
</P>
<P>
She had written earlier memoirs, including "A Gift of Joy" and "On Reflection" 
in the '60s, and the new one was intended to be "Helen Hayes' Mexico," or some 
such, stories and impressions of a country she loves. She didn't think it came 
off but sent it to Anita Loos' agent, a mutual friend, as a courtesy to her 
co-author. The agent found the publisher, but the changes that were requested 
amounted to a new book. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked it," she says, and sent the tapes to Hatch, who polished the words 
into shape, carefully preserving Hayes' own tone, which is energetic and 
cheerful but remarkably candid about herself and her associates. 
</P>
<P>
The blessings of seniority are not without number, but one of them is a 
refreshing freedom to let candor reign. She speaks of Lee Strasberg and the 
Actors Studio, "which I blame for many of the things wrong with the American 
theater then and now." There is a devastating portrait of Joan Crawford, 
reaffirming many of the things Christina wrote in "Mommy Dearest." (Hayes tried 
to send a gift to Christina, who had been forced to spend the summer at her 
boarding school, the only child in residence. Crawford's secretary said the 
mother did not want her daughter to have any gifts. Hayes sent one anyway, but 
doesn't know if Christina ever got it.) 
</P>
<P>
There is an acid-etched portrait of Richard Burton, with whom she worked on 
Broadway in "Time Remembered." Hayes became what she calls an "unwilling 
auditeur" to Burton's noisy lovemaking with Susan Strasberg in the next 
dressing room. (Strasberg has written about the destructive relationship in her 
own memoir, "Bittersweet.") 
</P>
<P>
"How would you feel if you had a pockmarked face like mine?" Hayes says Burton 
asked her as they walked around Boston during the pre-Broadway run. "Conquering 
every woman who came within reach seemed to be his way of compensating for that 
liability," she writes in the book. "But all those conquests cost him what had 
been easily within his grasp -- unstinting recognition as a great actor." 
</P>
<P>
Hayes had entertained Burton and his wife, Sybil, for a weekend in Nyack years 
earlier, when Burton was on Broadway with John Gielgud, playing in "The Lady's 
Not for Burning." MacArthur was already deep in the depression that darkened 
his last years and Hayes thought that Burton, his fame as a raconteur already 
established, would be bright company. "And he was," she says, "with his stories 
of his mining village and that hard-drinking family of his." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast to the portrait of the later Burton, there is a favoring glimpse of 
John Barrymore, with whom Hayes played in a 1933 film called "Night Flight" by 
the French author-pilot Antoine de St. Exupery. Barrymore was already known for 
undermining his own talent and having to read his lines from cue cards. But he 
was letter-perfect and totally professional. Hayes says that Barrymore told the 
director, Clarence Brown, "I was working with a real actress; I didn't want to 
make a goddamn fool of myself." 
</P>
<P>
Marian Davies was one of Hayes' close friends and at one point the subject of 
</P>
<P>
gossip as having had a child by the love of her life, William Randolph Hearst. 
Once she was escorted to a party by Truman Capote. As they swept in, she said 
in her characteristic stammer, "I want you to m-m-meet my illegitimate son by 
C-C-Calvin C-C-Coolidge." 
</P>
<P>
On the recent spring morning in Nyack, the news was of the Hubble space 
telescope being unlimbered in deep space. It reminded Helen Hayes of an 
expedition she and husband Charles MacArthur, Aldous Huxley and Anita Loos made 
to spend a day with Prof. Edwin Hubble, for whom the space telescope is named. 
Hubble was at Mt. Wilson, where he was awaiting delivery of that observatory's 
vast lens, then being ground in Upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
"When it was done, he'd be able to reach through the Milky Way and pick out an 
individual star. And Aldous said, 'Yes, and when it's all done and you've 
adjusted it perfectly, what you'll see is your own backside.' And Charlie, my 
Charlie, who was always supposed to be the flippant one, said, 'No, he won't. 
What he'll see when it's all adjusted is God . . . waggling his finger and 
saying, "Not a step further." ' " 
</P>
<P>
The most affecting portraits in the book are of Hayes' actress daughter, Mary 
MacArthur, who died of polio in the epidemic of 1949, and of her husband, 
Charlie. Theirs had been one of the great romances, and although his last years 
were marked by illness and heavy drinking, the memories of the good times 
prevail. 
</P>
<P>
They had met at a party at the artist Neysa McMein's studio, when he famously 
poured some peanuts into her hand and said, "I wish they were diamonds." His 
charm was understandably irresistible, and there was an endearing prankiness to 
match. 
</P>
<P>
She recalls an early escapade, when MacArthur arranged a telephone conversation 
between a Metropolitan Opera star, Lucrezia Bori, and Al Capone. Bori was crazy 
to meet Capone and while MacArthur couldn't manage that, he got a dubious 
Capone to take a phone call. Capone was an opera lover. "Have her sing 'Sempre 
libera' from 'La Traviata,' " Capone said. "If I'm convinced it's her, I'll 
talk to her." She did and he was and they talked. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes quotes his partner Ben Hecht's line about MacArthur: "He walked backward 
through life looking at the day he was 21." Together he and Hecht had written 
"The Front Page," "Twentieth Century" and many another play and film together. 
"Ben was right," Hayes says. "It was part of Charlie's charm. But after Mary's 
death, the youthfulness faded." He died in 1956 at 61. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many actors, who confess that the urge to impersonate caught them at a 
very early age -- the first time they toddled on stage as kindergartners, say, 
or the moment they put on angel wings in the Christmas pageant -- Helen Hayes, 
characteristically candid, says, "I never chose to be an actress." In the new 
book, she explains that the choice was made for her by her actress mother, 
Catherine Hayes Brown, whom everyone called Brownie. (Helen dropped the Brown 
for marquee purposes.) At her mother's prompting, she appeared in an amateur 
production at age 5. She worked alongside her mother in a Washington repertory 
company at 8 and made her Broadway debut in "Old Dutch " a Victor Herbert 
operetta, in 1909, when she was 9. 
</P>
<P>
Brownie, steering Helen through the career she had sought for herself but been 
unable to achieve, was a chaperon who became increasingly dependent on both her 
daughter and alcohol. Hayes, who is as candid about herself as about anyone in 
the book, quotes a doctor-cousin who said that the children of alcoholics carry 
feelings of inferiority with them into adulthood. "Not that they're ashamed," 
she says, "but they feel they are put on this Earth to serve, not to take. 
Maybe that explains my attitude." 
</P>
<P>
She felt very keenly the tug of war between career and parenthood. "Sometimes," 
she writes, "I became so melancholic that I felt all actresses should be spayed 
so they couldn't have children. . . . At times I thought of giving up work to 
concentrate on raising my children, but I couldn't bring myself to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Son James MacArthur, now 51 and still hailed as the longtime co-star of "Hawaii 
Five-0," has remarried and divides his time between Hawaii and a lodge in 
Colorado. Like many a series star, he finds the strong identification a mixed 
blessing, making it hard to be considered for other roles. His mother, who 
admires his talent, finds it unfair and distressing. Neither she nor MacArthur 
urged acting careers on the children but were supportive when they made their 
own choices. 
</P>
<P>
These days Hayes, who makes a number of public appearances, likes to quote her 
favorite dictum, which is, "If you rest, you rust." She rests very little. She 
presently is doing signings of her book -- 300 copies on a recent afternoon at 
the Doubleday shop in Manhattan. "The good news of this morning," she says, "is 
that they're printing another 5,000 copies. That'll be 35,000." 
</P>
<P>
She is involved in charitable work, appearing at the "Night of 100 Stars," 
which benefits the Actors Fund, of which she is an officer. She is also a 
principal supporter of an orphanage in Mexico and of Mother Teresa. 
</P>
<P>
She lives in a house full of memories, and leads her morning's guests down a 
circular stone staircase to a ground-level playroom and office crammed with the 
mementos of her life with Charlie -- posters, paintings, signed photographs of 
dozens of the famous, like the young Maurice Evans, desperately handsome, and a 
warmly inscribed portrait of her friend and idol, Laurette Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
But the mementos, it seemed clear, are not much visited. She elects to live in 
the present. With all else, she travels a good deal: to Ireland not long ago. 
She entertains old friends from the theater. Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy were 
up for a visit a few days after Tandy's triumph in the Academy Awards. The 
couple strolled down to the village, blissful at going unrecognized by 
passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
Not least and not surprisingly, Helen Hayes is a constant theatergoer. She and 
her old pal Mildred Natwick were off to see Maggie Smith and Margaret Tyzack in 
"Lettice and Lovage" the following week. And not long before, she had been to 
see Glynis Johns, Rex Harrison and Stewart Granger in Somerset Maugham's "The 
Circle." 
</P>
<P>
"I toured in that years ago," Hayes said, "doing the part that Glynis Johns 
does. And I saw her and I said, ''Oh, of course; THAT's the way it should be 
played."

SINEAD O'CONNOR BURST ONTO THE SCENE IN 1987 AS AN ODD-LOOKING PROVOCATEUR. BUT 
NOW, AT 23, THE IRISH SINGER-SONGWRITER HAS MATURED INTO A MAJOR ROCK FORCE

<P>
Sinead O'Connor, whose "I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got" is the hottest and 
most acclaimed album so far this year, does want one thing that she hasn't got 
-- a more accurate public image. 
</P>
<P>
Possibly the most valuable young pop property at the start of the '90s, the 
Irish singer-songwriter scorched the rock consciousness when she arrived on the 
scene three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
With a maverick, shaved-head look that was hard for photographers to resist and 
for pop fans to forget, O'Connor exhibited signs of being the most provocative 
pop strategist since Prince. 
</P>
<P>
She backed that bold appearance with outspoken interviews, viciously attacking 
rock's reigning heroes -- her fellow countrymen, U2 -- and expressing sympathy 
for the Irish Republican Army. The tough, high-profile stance helped build 
enough interest for her 1987 debut album to sell 1 million copies worldwide and 
for her to win a Grammy nomination for best female rock vocal performance. (She 
lost to Tina Turner.) 
</P>
<P>
The link with pop's provocateur tradition seemed complete late last year when 
Steve Fargnoli started managing her. His former client: Prince. 
</P>
<P>
But there were evidences of a more sensitive and straightforward artist at work 
in O'Connor's new "I Do Not Want . . ." album. Reflecting an intimacy and 
intensity that recalls John Lennon's landmark first solo album, the new 
collection is an eloquent statement about personal exorcisms and spiritual 
transformation. The album's thematic thrust is summarized by its opening track, 
"Feel So Different." 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in a hotel room here during a brief British tour, O'Connor shrugged at 
the mention of her old "angry young woman" image. Though still just 23, she 
dismissed the early stance to insecurity and youth. 
</P>
<P>
"People shouldn't take into account anything I said or did before the last year 
because I was not being honest with myself," the thin woman with doleful eyes 
said in a voice so soft that a tape recorder had to be placed on the arm of her 
chair to register the remarks -- a softness that was surprising in light of her 
vocal authority on record and her spunky image. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't saying the truth. Without realizing it, I was saying what I thought 
everyone wanted to hear, especially some of the people around me. Everything 
happened so fast. I disliked what I saw when I looked back on it." 
</P>
<P>
After the initial storm, O'Connor went through intense soul-searching. The new 
album documents some of that examination -- songs such as "You Cause As Much 
Sorrow" and "The Last Day of Our Acquaintance" that talk about personal trials 
as well as songs, including "Three Babies" and the album's title tune, which 
deal with spiritual awakening. 
</P>
<P>
Sample lines from "Feel So Different": 
</P>
<P>
 The whole time I'd never seen 
</P>
<P>
 All you had spread before me 
</P>
<P>
 The whole time I'd never seen 
</P>
<P>
 That all I needed was inside me 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the album's huge success, during an interview, O'Connor appeared 
worried that she is still seen as sort of a manipulative pop opportunist. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not obsessed with fame and pop stardom," she said. "I'm glad there are 
fans out there and I'm pleased if they like the record, but I am very removed 
from the whole adulation thing. I didn't make these records for other people. I 
made them to learn things about myself. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not even sure interviews are a good idea. I don't think I'll be doing many 
more. It's probably best to just let the music speak for itself. But I made 
some mistakes (in what I said after the first album) and I want to try to 
correct that. The one thing I'd hate someone to think is that everything I do 
is just some sort of gimmick." 
</P>
<P>
Confessional is too strong a term for O'Connor's mood in an interview, even for 
a woman who was raised Catholic in Dublin. But she did seem unusually open as 
she talked about the sometimes turbulent events of her childhood and her brief 
tenure in pop. 
</P>
<P>
Not one for pretense, O'Connor didn't think of calling room service when she 
decided she wanted some coffee during the interview. She walked over to the 
room's courtesy coffee maker and began fixing her own. 
</P>
<P>
Obligation was a better word to convey her manner. She seemed to feel it her 
responsibility to clarify all the confusion stirred up in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
The shaved head seemed to be a good place to start. 
</P>
<P>
The widespread assumption: The move was a blatant attempt to forge a rebellious 
pop identity. 
</P>
<P>
"No," she said, firmly. "It wasn't for those reasons. We are all so accustomed 
to having everyone do something to attract attention or build an image that it 
doesn't occur to people that it's possible to do something just because you 
feel like it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just a girl. I forget that I'm a singer or that I'm in the music business. 
I have always been doing things with my hair, shaving it, bleaching it. I'm 
sure that practically every girl who has ever been born messed with her hair. 
So I just decided to cut it one day -- and I liked the way it looked. It's 
nothing more important than that." 
</P>
<P>
Nigel Grainge, the head of Ensign Records and the man who discovered O'Connor, 
confirms her story. 
</P>
<P>
Grainge has enjoyed so much success over the years with Irish bands, including 
Thin Lizzy and Bob Geldof's Boomtown Rats, that he makes periodic trips to 
Dublin in search of new groups. It was on one such expedition in 1985 that he 
heard O'Connor. She was the lead singer for a group called Ton Ton Macoute. 
</P>
<P>
"They were horrible," Grainge said in a separate interview. "Awful songs, awful 
playing, but she was interesting . . . this little student-type with baggy 
jersey and torn jeans, just singing to her feet for three quarters of an hour 
with this amazing voice." 
</P>
<P>
Grainge gave O'Connor a bit of encouragement when she phoned him in London a 
few weeks later to say she had left the band. Still he recalls his subsequent 
surprise when the phone rang again and the voice said to him, "Hi, it's Sinead, 
I'm at the airport." Caught up in other business, Grainge asked himself, 
"Sinead? Sinead? Do I know a Sinead?" 
</P>
<P>
As much out of embarrassment as anything, Grainge arranged for Karl Wallinger, 
of the band World Party, to go into the studio with O'Connor and help her 
record four of her songs. Grainge loved them and signed her to a contract. 
</P>
<P>
While working on the debut album, O'Connor spent a lot of time around the 
Ensign office. That's where Grainge first saw the shaved head. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember the day she came in with a Mohawk, the sides shaved off," he said. 
"Then, about two days later she came in completely shorn. It wasn't that she 
was manufacturing a look. She didn't make a big deal of it. I think she was 
just experimenting, trying to express herself. 
</P>
<P>
"She had quite a turbulent childhood -- a lot of trouble in school and so forth 
-- and people often react to that in different ways. Some people walk out in 
the street and scream. Others turn to crime. She turned to (music)." 
</P>
<P>
Troubled childhood. That's another aspect of O'Connor's life that she thinks is 
a bit overplayed. 
</P>
<P>
The Dublin native doesn't deny there were traumatic moments, including the 
break-up of her parents' marriage and enough teen-age rebellion -- including 
shoplifting -- to land her in a "corrective center." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor didn't seem to enjoy going through these old times, but she again 
pressed on -- as if in penance for her earlier loose talk. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a hard time, but I don't want to appear as if I am going, 'Oh, I had 
such a terrible childhood.' I can talk about it, but you should realize I am a 
very philosophical person. I believe people chose their lives before they are 
born . . . choose their parents and everything else so I believe this is a life 
I chose." 
</P>
<P>
The most troubling moment was when O'Connor's mother died. Sinead was 17 -- and 
she was shaken by the suddenness of death and upset by the unhappiness she saw 
in her mother's life in a country where people are prohibited from remarrying 
because divorce isn't allowed. 
</P>
<P>
"Luckily, the record contract gave me an excuse to leave Dublin because 
everywhere I went, I could see things that reminded me of my mother and it was 
devastating," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The first album took nearly two years and a then-pregnant O'Connor was pretty 
weary of the material by the time the collection was finally released and she 
went on tour. 
</P>
<P>
"I was more interested in my pregnancy, to tell you the truth," she said. "I 
was waiting for Jake (now 2 1/2) to be born. By the time the album was 
finished, he's really all I cared about. I had lived with the songs for so 
long. It wasn't that I didn't like the album, but it wasn't really that big a 
deal to me. I never thought anything would happen anyway. I thought it would 
sell about 10 copies and that would be that." 
</P>
<P>
But the album, "The Lion and the Cobra," was a critical and commercial success, 
passing the 1 million mark world-wide. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the following months, including a U.S. and British tour, wasn't a 
particularly comfortable time. 
</P>
<P>
"I was having a very, very hard time personally. . . . In my private life and 
the tour seemed to be very secondary to that. I wasn't really into it because I 
didn't understand what was going on in my life." 
</P>
<P>
It was during the period that she gave some of the interviews she now regrets. 
In a recent interview in Q magazine, she reflected on those earlier remarks. "I 
was 20 or 21 when I said those things and I didn't have the slightest idea of 
what I was talking about," she said, referring to the IRA comments. "Now when I 
see pictures of a bombing on television it horrifies me that I said such 
things." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until after the tour that O'Connor began to sort out her life. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got married (to her son's father, drummer John Reynolds), that helped," 
she said. "I settled down and stopped thinking about other things. I found some 
new friends and I had to sever ties with people who had been close to me, but 
who had not been encouraging me to be myself. It was very painful, but I have 
never been happier." 
</P>
<P>
The severing of ties included her relationship with her first manager, Fatchna 
O'Ceallaigh, who she credited in the liner notes of her first album with being 
"my biggest influence and my best friend." 
</P>
<P>
There have been hints in the British pop press that much of the anger and 
frustration expressed in "I Do Not Want I Haven't Got" is a reflection of their 
relationship, but O'Connor refused to discuss the matter in the interview. 
O'Ceallaigh too declined to discuss their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Ensign Records' Nigel Grainge was also guarded when asked about his perspective 
on the artist and her former manager. "That's a very sore point," he said. 
"There was a very strong relationship between them that was very much over and 
above the normal artist-manager relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to delve into it too deeply, but he was very much part of her 
life . . . and I think the new album reflects the experience they had." 
</P>
<P>
Given similar past pronouncements by David Bowie and Prince, it certainly 
sounds like pop strategy when O'Connor says things like she may never make 
another album. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to work with Prince's former manager adds to the suspicion that 
there is still a bit of pop manipulation in O'Connor when she says her interest 
is in self-expression, not in stardom, and that she may eventually concentrate 
on acting. (She has already played a supporting role in a film, "Hush a Bye 
Baby," made for British television.) 
</P>
<P>
But O'Connor insists she only hired Fargnoli because she had met him a few 
times socially through friend Karl Wallinger, whom he also manages. The goal, 
she said, with a smile, was not for him to build her into pop's new Princess. 
She said she simply trusted Fargnoli. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it wasn't Fargnoli who introduced the singer to "Nothing Compares 2 
U," the old Prince song that has become a smash hit single for her. She learned 
the song, which first appeared on a 1985 album by the Prince-aligned group the 
Family, from former manager, O'Ceallaigh. 
</P>
<P>
About the statement she may not make another album for "five years or ever," 
Ensign's Grainge said, "I'd like to think she will make more albums, but I 
don't see her writing another one album until she feels she has had enough 
experiences for the songs to be meaningful." 
</P>
<P>
In a separate interview, Fargnoli too smiled at the idea of O'Connor wanting to 
be a pop Princess. 
</P>
<P>
"She is not someone who is driven by pop career or pop sales," he said 
backstage at the Apollo Theater in Manchester. "That's what I find exciting 
about her. She's willing to take risks because she's not trying to protect 
anything . . . such as a record career. She'll do what interests her. 
</P>
<P>
"If I ever met anyone who would be able to handle stardom, I think it's her. 
She's conscious of the dangers and of getting lost in it." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor wore a hooded white robe on stage for the first of her two shows at 
the Apollo, an old movie theater that is now used for concerts in Manchester, 
the second largest city in England. The image was of a nun or possibly a 
Franciscan. The religious symbolism was underscored by the hymn-like nature of 
the opening song, "Feel So Different.' 
</P>
<P>
It was a powerful image in a deeply moving, introspective concert that was 
among the most compelling performances in recent years. O'Connor, who is now on 
a brief U.S. tour that will include stops May 29 at San Diego State 
University's Open Air Theatre and May 31 and June 1 at the Wiltern Theatre in 
Los Angeles, is aware of the seductiveness of her own struggle and salvation 
commentaries. She has seen the handful of girls who invariably show up at her 
concerts now with shaved heads of their own and an intense, almost obsessive 
attachment to her music. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the clear spiritual undercurrents in her songs, she doesn't want the 
role of pop missionary. 
</P>
<P>
"Religion isn't a very good word to use because it conjures up Catholicism or 
Judaism or Protestantism," she said during the hotel interview. "I am talking 
about universal spirituality . . . the feeling that someone like Van Morrison 
leaves you with after seeing his concerts or listening to his records." 
</P>
<P>
For one of the few times in the interview, O'Connor's voice moved beyond a 
whisper, suggesting the importance she attached to the comments. 
</P>
<P>
"This album is about finding yourself and finding a certain fulfillment, but I 
want to make it clear that I do not feel I am someone with all the answers, 
someone who is trying to convert others. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not the case at all. I have beliefs and opinions, but they are based on 
my own personal experience and I could change them tomorrow. It's up to 
everyone to find their own answers." 
</P>
<P>
Pausing, she added, "Maybe the one lesson of the album is that you can find the 
answers if you look hard enough. Everything in the new album happened to me -- 
and I learned from it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Postscript: 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor was scheduled to sing two numbers on "Saturday Night Live" last night, 
but announced last Wednesday that she was cancelling the appearance because she 
did not want to appear on the same program with guest host Andrew Dice Clay, 
whose comedy routines are laced with expletives and feature jokes about sexual 
violence that have been criticized as anti-women. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be nonsensical of 'Saturday Night Live' to expect a woman to perform 
songs about a woman's experience after a monologue by Andrew Dice Clay," she 
said in a prepared statement. "I feel it shows disrespect to women that 
'Saturday Night Live' expected me to perform on the same show as Andrew Dice 
Clay."
