COURT-MARTIAL FOR KINKAID'S SKIPPER BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The commanding officer of a Navy destroyer involved in a collision at the 
Strait of Malacca did not know the true location of his vessel and had 
inadequately trained his watch crew, a Navy prosecutor charged Sunday during 
the opening day of the first such court-martial in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Cmdr. John M. Cochrane, the 44-year-old captain of the Kinkaid, which collided 
with a merchant ship in November -- killing the Kinkaid's navigator and 
injuring five sailors -- stands accused of endangering the ship and its crew by 
failing to carry out a safe plan for crossing one of the world's most heavily 
traveled channels. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Cochrane -- who enlisted almost 21 years ago -- faces a maximum 
penalty of two years in the brig, forfeiture of all future pay including his 
pension, and dismissal from the Navy. The case will explore the extent of a 
captain's responsibilities for his crew and ship. The captain has traditionally 
been viewed as accountable for his vessel -- a longtime cornerstone of Navy 
philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
Navy prosecutor Lt. Cmdr. Leroy Dickens charged that Cochrane not only failed 
to pick up a navigational error and was misinformed about the ship's location, 
but that he also understaffed the ship's bridge and watches. Some crew members 
performing watch duties during the night of the collision were doing those 
tasks either for the first or second time -- and a total of eight sailors had 
not qualified by Navy regulations for the tasks to which they were assigned, 
Dickens said. 
</P>
<P>
"This collision should never have happened. . . . The commanding officer set 
the stage for a disaster," Dickens said during proceedings at the 32nd Street 
Naval Station. "The commanding officer of a ship should always know where his 
ship is. When he goes to bed, he should know where his ship is. He must always 
know." 
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the collision, Cochrane requested a wake-up call of 6 a.m., and 
the ship arrived at the strait, between the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, almost 
an hour earlier. When the collision occurred about 5 a.m., the captain, 
navigator and assistant navigator were not on the bridge, witnesses testified. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Sean McPhee, the 24-year-old navigator who had held his position for about 
four months, was killed as he slept in his bunk. McPhee, of Santa Rosa, Calif., 
had told the captain and the executive officer that the Kinkaid would not reach 
the strait until later in the morning. McPhee had asked to hold a navigational 
briefing the following morning, said Lt. Cmdr. David T. Cunningham, the ship's 
executive officer, who has been in the Navy 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
But the Kinkaid was apparently ahead of its schedule and arrived at the busy 
crossing with a smaller number of men in the Combat Information Center than was 
required by Navy regulations, testified Lt. (j.g.) Douglas Walter McCurdy, the 
CIC watch officer. McCurdy assumed the CIC watch at 4:25 a.m. -- a duty he had 
performed for the first time the day before. Realizing the Kinkaid's location 
and believing the ship was undermanned, he twice requested that the vessel's 
contingency plan be started and more men summoned. 
</P>
<P>
"I was told people were standing by if I ordered it. I was told there was a 
plan," McCurdy testified, looking at Cochrane several times. "I discovered 
that, whatever plan there was, it was not effective, because no one came." 
</P>
<P>
The 563-foot Kinkaid, en route to Hong Kong on Nov. 11 for a routine port call, 
collided with the Kota Petanie, a 493-foot Panamanian freighter. Fires broke 
out aboard the Kinkaid and the collision ripped a 15-by-56-foot hole in its 
starboard side. Injuries aboard the Kota Petanie were minor. 
</P>
<P>
Two sailors and two officers -- including McCurdy -- received letters of 
reprimand in connection with the collision. The duty officer, Lt. (j.g.) Steven 
M. Williams, 25, was dismissed from the Navy in a court-martial after receiving 
a letter of reprimand in February. Williams, the officer of the deck, was found 
guilty of dereliction of duty and negligently hazarding a vessel. 
</P>
<P>
Cochrane, who declined to discuss his case during Sunday's proceedings, was 
relieved of duty in November. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a terrible thing to happen after such a wonderful career," said his wife, 
Suzanne, of San Diego. The accident "was just a moment in time where everything 
went wrong. My husband isn't bitter, but I stand nothing to lose by saying that 
I am extremely bitter and I don't love the Navy." 
</P>
<P>
Cochrane's case will explore the extent to which a captain is responsible for 
his ship. The last time a similar case occurred was in 1975, when the guided 
missile cruiser Belknap collided with the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy 
during operations in the Mediterranean. Eight sailors were killed and 48 were 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
In a controversial decision, the Belknap's captain, Walter R. Shafer, was 
acquitted of negligence charges by a military judge in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was so controversial that Adm. James Holloway, then chief of naval 
operations, released a statement saying it did not undercut the long-held Navy 
policy that has always declared a commanding officer responsible for his vessel 
and crew. 
</P>
<P>
"There are obviously deviations, and the Belknap was one. A number of us 
weren't too damn pleased about it," retired Vice Adm. Joseph Metcalf III, a 
former deputy chief of naval operations, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, a captain is in charge and he is held responsible for what happens. 
Ships can't be run by committee," Metcalf said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Dickens painted a picture of a crew strained by its own inexperience 
and further hampered by understaffing at a critical moment. Dickens alleges 
that Cochrane did not: 
</P>
<P>
* Supply functioning binoculars or a stopwatch, used as a measurement tool. 
</P>
<P>
* Review directions or brief the crew about sailing the Strait of Malacca. 
</P>
<P>
* Ensure that qualified personnel were assigned to stand watch.

2 CLASSROOMS DESTROYED IN $500,000 FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
SIMI VALLEY: A FAULTY CLOCK AT PARK VIEW ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SPARKS THE BLAZE. 
ABOUT 130 FIRST- AND SECOND-GRADERS WILL BE DISPLACED.

Fire destroyed two classrooms and heavily damaged two others at a Simi Valley 
elementary school early Sunday, causing a loss estimated at $500,000, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators determined that a malfunctioning clock caused the blaze at Park 
View Elementary School, 1500 Alexander St., said Jackie Noel, a dispatcher for 
the Ventura County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
Noel said two firefighters suffered minor injuries fighting the fire. 
</P>
<P>
About 130 first- and second-grade pupils -- more than a fifth of the school's 
approximately 620 students -- will be displaced because of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
The students will be taught in the school's library, computer lab or in two 
special-education classrooms during the five weeks remaining in the school 
year, Principal Rob Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
"Services to the kids won't be interrupted in any way," Hunter said. "We'll 
just change the way we deliver the services." 
</P>
<P>
Park View was not scheduled to be used for summer classes. 
</P>
<P>
The fire swept through one of five four-classroom wings at the school, one of 
the largest of the Simi Valley Unified School District's 19 elementary schools, 
Supt. John Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
"The fire was so hot, it even buckled the outside walls . . . we may have to do 
a total demolition and build a new wing." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter said the fire in the clock was a "freak thing" but that similar clocks 
will be inspected. 
</P>
<P>
"Evidently the clock had been smoldering for quite a while," Hunter said. "If 
we had been in session we probably wouldn't have had . . . near the damage we 
had." 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said seven engines, two trucks and 35 firefighters were needed 
to put out the fire, which was reported by a neighbor at 2:15 a.m. and was 
extinguished by 6:37 a.m.

POLICE OFFICER SHOT IN NECK AFTER CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A police officer was shot through the neck Sunday after a robbery and a chase 
led to an armed confrontation in an East San Diego back yard, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Officer John McGill was shot twice, one bullet grazing his shoulder and the 
other -- described as causing a "through and through" wound -- passing through 
the left side of his neck, a spokesman for the San Diego Police Department 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The robbery suspect, Steven Lon Nead, 36, suffered a superficial gunshot wound 
and other injuries, and was to be booked on suspicion of attempted murder, 
armed robbery and auto theft, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
McGill was in good condition Sunday night at Mercy Hospital after exploratory 
surgery, hospital spokeswoman Laura Avallone said. 
</P>
<P>
A five-year veteran of the police force, McGill answered a call at 4:47 p.m. at 
the Mobil station on Mission Center Road in Mission Valley, where an armed 
robbery had just been reported. 
</P>
<P>
Soon afterward, McGill spotted the suspect's car heading south on Mission 
Center Road and gave chase, police spokesman Dave Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
The car entered southbound Interstate 805 and continued at high speed, exiting 
the freeway and eventually crashing into a row of parked cars in the 3300 block 
of Lincoln Avenue, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the suspect ran down an alley and ended up in a back yard in the 
4000 block of Wabash Avenue in East San Diego. The officer ordered him to drop 
his weapon, a .25-caliber automatic handgun, but the suspect fired two rounds, 
both of which hit the officer, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
The officer returned fire with a 9-millimeter handgun, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Nead suffered a superficial gunshot wound to his right forearm, a spokesman for 
UC San Diego Medical Center said. He also suffered a gash in his right forearm 
and may have dislocated his shoulder, Cohen said. He was reported in good 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Nead, who was arrested at the scene when backup officers arrived, 
was to be booked on suspicion of attempted murder, armed robbery and auto 
theft.

FIREFIGHTERS ENDORSE UTILITY TAX INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Oxnard Firefighters Assn. has endorsed a ballot measure that would increase 
utility taxes by 5% in an effort to prevent personnel cuts in the Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
The endorsement for Measure C, which will appear on the June 5 ballot, follows 
a similar endorsement by the Oxnard Peace Officers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Unless voters approve the measure, which would add about $5 million annually to 
Oxnard's coffers, the Oxnard City Council will consider cutting eight 
firefighting jobs and 27 positions in the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Other departments face similar budget reductions as Oxnard tries to offset a 
$2.7-million deficit brought on primarily by several unexpected expenditures, 
including a $690,000 increase in the cost of the city's workers' compensation 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The tax would cost the average household about $4 per month. HUGO MARTIN

SUSPECT IN SLAYING ARRESTED AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Sun Valley man was arrested early Sunday after police investigating a Los 
Angeles killing traced him to a home on the east side of Moorpark, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Herb Roper said Steven Batres, 19, of North 
Hollywood was being held on suspicion of murder. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles investigators said Batres is suspected of being one of as many as 
10 people who chased and attacked Ricardo Camacho, 18, as Camacho walked in 
North Hollywood about 11:45 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Detective Mike Coffey said the attackers punched and kicked 
Camacho before one of them shot him several times with a handgun. He died 
instantly, Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
Roper said Ventura deputies were called after Los Angeles police got a tip that 
Batres was in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
He said Batres surrendered peacefully after deputies evacuated nearby homes.

TWO HOSTAGES OUT, AND HUNDREDS TO GO; 
</P>
<P>
THE UPFRONT ISSUE NOW IS GETTING EVERYONE'S PRISONERS EXCHANGED. THE HEAT IS ON 
TO PLAY THE ISRAEL CONNECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY LEVIN, Jerry Levin, a journalist specializing in the Middle East, was 
CNN's Beirut bureau chief in 1984 where he was kidnaped by Hezbollah. He 
escaped on Feb. 14, 1985. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The best that can be said about the release of American hostages Robert Polhill 
and Frank Reed is that their return marked only the beginning of the beginning 
for the others still in captivity, not the beginning of the end. 
</P>
<P>
What appears to be happening is a kind of cautious groping for a process of 
politically "safe" accommodation, a kind of face-saving "uncompromising" 
compromise that all parties will be able to claim never happened. 
</P>
<P>
The result of the Polhill/Reed stage-one release process was a significant 
tactical draw. Although it was no-win for everyone (except the Polhill and Reed 
families), it nevertheless was no-loss too. When lives are in peril, this can 
be considered -- if not progress -- at least a gain. 
</P>
<P>
The beginning of the next stage in the release process appears to be a further 
testing of each party's current intentions and attitudes in relation to one of 
the core issues of the long hostage ordeal -- exchanging prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani's complaint that Washington's lukewarm 
thanks for Tehran's role in the release of Polhill and Reed was "inadequate and 
unwise" drew a tactful response from President Bush. He implied a parallel 
between our national pain and Iran's by expressing some empathy for Iran's 
periodic expressions of concern about the fate of three Iranian diplomats and 
their driver who disappeared in Christian East Beirut on July 4, 1982, and its 
additional oft-expressed concern for the fate of 400 to 500 Lebanese and 
Palestinians being held hostage by Israel. 
</P>
<P>
By continuing to dwell on their own missing officials and Israel's hostages, 
Iran has been sending a message for quite some time that Westerners are not the 
only kidnap victims in Lebanon, and that justice requires that Muslim 
sensibilities in this respect need also to be taken into account. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush pledged that the United States would try to be of assistance to 
Iran, so long as this was not "perceived as negotiating for the release of 
hostages." His comment was similar to those he voiced nearly a year ago in 
response to Israel's kidnaping of Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, the south Lebanese 
Shiite leader linked to Hezbollah. At that time, the President appealed to "all 
who hold hostages in the Middle East to release them forthwith." And after 
Reed's release, the White House -- its no-deal policy for American hostages 
notwithstanding -- said that it would not object to Israel trading its Lebanese 
and Palestinian hostages for three Israeli servicemen captured in Lebanon in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
Other rewards for "helping out" -- speeding up the return of Iranian frozen 
assets, compensating Iran for undelivered military equipment and normalizing 
diplomatic and trade relations with both Iran and Syria -- will undoubtedly 
take place in time, but not until all our hostages have come home and probably 
not until both Iran and Syria get themselves off the State Department's list of 
nations involved with terrorism. The nation's bitter Iran-Contra experience 
with foolhardy upfront rewards without ironclad guarantees that the hostages 
would be freed will prevent that from happening again. 
</P>
<P>
Iran's upbeat announcement Wednesday that progress had been made at the 
Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal in The Hague is an indication that upfront material 
compensation and rewards are no longer the major issues they once seemed to be. 
Iran seems to be satisfied that both can be expected in an appropriate period 
of time after all the hostages come home. So now, the upfront issue is getting 
everyone's hostages and prisoners exchanged. 
</P>
<P>
The most consistent demand of the Lebanese captors has been for the return of 
Arab prisoners and hostages. If no more American hostages are taken to replace 
Polhill and Reed, we can take this as a signal that the captors are watching to 
see if Washington will pressure Israel to free the hostages it seized in 
Lebanon, and if Kuwait will find a way to release 15 Shiite Muslims convicted 
of terrorism in December, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
It should not really be surprising that the fate of the American and perhaps 
other Western hostages now seems to be depending on what Israel and its 
Lebanese adversaries are ready and willing to do about their hostage situation. 
There always has been a direct Israeli connection to the plight of the American 
hostages. 
</P>
<P>
It was Washington's essentially uncritical support of Israel's invasion of 
Lebanon (and then our eventual violent intrusion into Lebanon's civil war, 
mostly on Israel's behalf) that turned a fairly high Lebanese regard for 
Americans into deadly hatred. Now there is a growing insistence in the United 
States that because the Israelis played a major role in getting us into this 
mess, they'd better help get us out -- with the lives of our six remaining 
hostage citizens intact.

IN ACADEME, MISOGYNY MEETS ITS MATCH: MISANDROSY;

<P>
BEHAVIOR: THE UPROAR AT MILLS COLLEGE ILLUSTRATES A NASTY NEW TREND: 
MAN-HATING. WHAT PARENT WOULD SEND A SON INTO SUCH AN ENVIRONMENT?

<P>
The images in the news were startling: distraught women students sobbing 
uncontrollably, their faces contorted in pain and anger. The ensuing interviews 
bespoke rage and revenge: student strikes called, resignations demanded, 
marches organized, donations cut off. What atrocity had merited such an 
outbreak? What injustice had the students suffered? 
</P>
<P>
The trustees of all-women Mills College in Oakland had just decided to permit 
young males to begin their college education at this school. Next year, unless 
the protests succeed, a few teen-age boys will arrive at Mills and, amid 772 
women, start using the library, taking notes, reading and -- worst of all -- 
asking questions in class. Which is exactly what the hysterical students and 
some of their ultra-feminist professors are afraid of. Why? Because, a Mills 
teacher tells us, research "proves" that the presence of men victimizes women 
students: that male students talk too much, ask too many questions and 
interrupt too often, thereby intimidating women and preventing their education. 
(This, by the way, was news to my students at co-ed University of San Diego.) 
</P>
<P>
All of this uproar and rhetoric, and the pseudo-research behind it, exemplifies 
an emerging social force that is increasingly making itself felt on modern men, 
especially the young. It is the shadow side of the extreme feminist movement, 
an ideology of hate whose name is not yet found in the dictionary. I term it 
misandrosy (Greek: "hatred of men"), the mirror opposite of misogyny. 
Misandrosy, not yet as widespread or harmful as misogyny but not yet as well 
recognized, either, is beginning to show itself mainly in liberal circles in 
the arts, literature, religion, media and academia. 
</P>
<P>
In general, this man-hating ideology holds that most males are naturally 
violent, dominating and patriarchal, and therefore forever on the verge of 
rape, child abuse and wife-battering. Talk-show hosts like Oprah Winfrey 
traffic in this male-bashing prejudice with lurid programs during the afternoon 
television hate-hour ("Male Child-Molesters and the Women Who Love Them"). 
Popular novels and movies portray males, especially African-Americans, as 
inevitably cruel and nearly worthless ("The Color Purple," "The Women of 
Brewster Place"). Shelves of sexist books (Riane Eisler's "The Chalice and the 
Blade") claim that men (and their male gods) have ruined all history since the 
idyllic days of the Neolithic Age when women (and their goddesses) held 
beneficent sway. Carl Sagan even pompously informs us that the whole planet is 
imminently endangered by "testosterone poisoning." 
</P>
<P>
In this climate, any pride in being male is quickly squelched ("male 
chauvinism"). Men are supposed to submit to continual brow-beating about their 
"problem" of masculinity in order to expiate for their past sins and, possibly, 
get the cure. 
</P>
<P>
Like all hate ideologies (racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia), misandrosy 
portrays itself as righteous and its purveyors as victims, put-upon, endangered 
and beleaguered. Special steps are therefore demanded to prevent the dangerous 
"them" from living in "our" neighborhood, taking "our" jobs, or, in the case of 
Mills, going to "our" schools. The rest of "us," in turn, are supposed to feel 
sympathetic to such victimization and therefore supportive of the protests, 
demonstrations and strikes. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Mills, the rhetoric seems to have worked. None of the many media 
stories that I saw contained the slightest criticism or questioning of the 
professors' "research" or the students' demands. Yet these attitudes are no 
less hateful than white students screaming at James Meredith in Mississippi or 
ignorant teachers trying to prevent Ryan White from studying in Indiana. In 
those two cases, public opinion rightly rejected the notion that a young black 
man or an AIDS sufferer pursuing his education endangered or victimized anyone. 
Not so at Mills. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that is because misandrosy is more widespread and subtle than we 
thought. Remember: The Mills trustees voted to allow males at their school, not 
because young men in Oakland might desperately need more opportunities for 
obtaining a solid education, or even to expose female students to different 
companions and viewpoints. Men will come to Mills, we are told, solely to bring 
in more revenue. Because that is the one thing people think men are good for -- 
making money. 
</P>
<P>
That is why I would discourage parents from sending their teen-age boys into 
the toxic sexist environment at Mills. Send them to a mature co-ed college 
instead, a school where they can study, read, think and ask all the questions 
they want -- and not feel hated for it.

GOLDEN BOYS, PRINCES OF DARKNESS

<TEXT>
<P>
It is a perfect afternoon on Salt Creek Beach in Dana Point. All over the 
world, people dream of such an afternoon as this. The strand nestles into a 
cliff covered in flowers, the triumph of an army of gardeners. There is a deep 
and velvety turf newly laid in the public park. On the sand, milky-white 
children run into the waves on well-fed legs, squealing with fun. 
</P>
<P>
In the distance, brown-bodied, golden-haired youths ride the surf, their 
courage and limbs full of blessed grace. The boys and the waves are one; Greek 
gods were once seen thus. 
</P>
<P>
In the shimmering afternoon, it is as if this picture of careless happiness, 
full of light and gulls' cries, will go on forever. Not here, not yet, the 
shuffling homeless, the angry have-nots. On the cliff-top above, the 
Ritz-Carlton looms, the image of spoiled luxury. Is there a house for less than 
$400,000 on this Mediterranean skyline? In this gated time warp, let us make 
believe innocence and plenty. O golden America. 
</P>
<P>
At some time, when the surf gentles or the long day palls, the boys climb from 
the ocean, peel back the Body Gloves and toss surfboards on the bushes. And in 
this one gesture they tell all: of easy money, of confident days. From the 
water's edge, they can be seen winding toward the small cafe that ministers to 
this beach. 
</P>
<P>
This cafe opens early when the surfers come down before school -- for egg 
burritos and the camaraderie of ocean sport. Jiannis Efstathiou leased the cafe 
from the county three years ago. He remodeled it with his savings, bought deck 
chairs, umbrellas, surfboards to rent. He bought freezers, cookers; hamburgers 
are $2, hot dogs $1.35. The cafe is his pride. He is American now but he was 
Greek once: He grew up watching the sea, the boats, the danger and hardship of 
wrenching a living from a cruel taskmaster. To him, these beautiful boys 
playing like dolphins with the waves must have seemed a miracle. At first, that 
is. 
</P>
<P>
So on this afternoon, trouble, when it comes, is an ugly shock to all but him. 
The youths jump up onto the roof of the cafe, run across and down onto the 
tables, kicking aside children's drinks, visitors' picnics. They bang on the 
cafe counter: "Gimme a f------ straw." The straws, as Efstathiou knows well, 
are for filling water balloons. Soon, young surfers are running to and fro on 
the promenade, hurling their balloons, racial filth and sexual slurs at all 
they consider outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
When a male couple, jolted with sudden horror, leave the beach, the boys turn 
on a Japanese family picnicking nearby. But the father is not one to run away. 
He walks slowly forward and seizes a boy by the hair. "Let me go, I'm a minor. 
My father will sue you. . . . " comes the shriek, of fear, of privilege, of 
gilded youth. The Japanese are visitors. Lips curling with distaste, faces 
implacably hard, gathering their frightened children, they depart. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff's department has been called. A young officer, Deputy Patrick Duff, 
drives down alone in his car, circling slowly, uncomfortable at being pushed to 
do something. "What can I do?" he asks. "They're kids." 
</P>
<P>
The kids have taken to scrawling on the cafe walls. Their cruelties referred 
first to Efstathiou as an Italian, then as a Jew. Dark-haired, black-eyed, a 
thing of darkness to the beach blonds. Boys, 13 and 14 years old, playthings of 
hatred -- not one of them would survive, surely, in places where such hatred 
kills. 
</P>
<P>
An older surfer knows the boys, says that they are all locals. So why would the 
sheriff's man not take them home to their parents? He shrugs. 
</P>
<P>
Do their parents know? Is this what the three-car garages, the cars at Sweet 
Sixteen, the $50-beach shirts are for? Where did they learn to hurl such 
bigotry into the air, to think that none of it matters? What horror crawls from 
under the landscaped rocks? 
</P>
<P>
And which is worse: the absence of any parents to recoil in shame? the fear of 
Efstathiou alone on this deserted beach? 
</P>
<P>
No, worst of all is the deathly silence of those who stand around the cafe on 
this perfect, shimmering afternoon and pretend that this is not happening. 
Fathers wipe chocolate ice cream from small, wide-eyed faces. Cyclists fiddle 
suddenly with their change purses. The languid melt away up to the 
Ritz-Carlton. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of polite, well-behaved adults stand by and let victory go to the 
brutish, to the true things of darkness in this golden land. Salt in the wound 
at Salt Creek, a cracked note in the idyll.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIRE DESTROYS 2 ROOMS AT SIMI VALLEY SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fire destroyed two classrooms and heavily damaged two others at a Simi Valley 
elementary school early Sunday, causing a loss estimated at $500,000, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators determined that a malfunctioning clock caused the blaze at Park 
View Elementary School, 1500 Alexander St., said Jackie Noel, a dispatcher for 
the Ventura County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
Noel said two firefighters suffered minor injuries fighting the fire. 
</P>
<P>
About 130 first- and second-grade pupils -- more than a fifth of the school's 
approximately 620 students -- will be displaced because of the fire. The 
students will be taught in the school's library, computer lab, or in two 
special-education classrooms during the five weeks remaining in the school 
year, Principal Rob Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
"Services to the kids won't be interrupted in any way," Hunter said. "We'll 
just change the way we deliver the services." Park View was not scheduled to be 
used for summer classes. 
</P>
<P>
The 2:15 a.m. fire swept through one of five four-classroom wings at the 
school, one of the largest of the Simi Valley Unified School District's 19 
elementary schools, Supt. John Duncan said.

MAKING A CASE FOR CAR-POOL LANES; 
</P>
<P>
PROP. 111 WOULD AID RIVERSIDE AND ORANGE COUNTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Picture families living at opposite ends of a gravel road. One owns a 
prosperous farm. The grown sons from the other family earn income by planting 
and harvesting the farm's crops. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping the road open is important to both, but it is hard work and the farmer 
never seems to be able to lay hands on money to pay for it. So the sons keep 
the road open. But they also keep a meticulous ledger because they hope that 
the farmer will get his financial act together some day and pay them for it. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a fable but the true story of Riverside and Orange counties and 
about a road, state Highway 91, that carries 200,000 cars between the counties 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
There are plans to increase the commuter capacity of the Riverside Freeway by 
creating two car-pool lanes in each direction along a 12-mile stretch where the 
county lines meet. The $90-million project would also provide single car-pool 
lanes on other sections of the freeway. In a well-ordered society, the costs of 
the car-pool lanes -- crucial to both counties -- would be shared and the 
project carefully coordinated. That has not happened. Thus, this is also a tale 
about one more example of the many possibilities for cutting rush-hour 
congestion that would result from voter approval of Proposition 111 on the June 
5 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County is the recalcitrant neighbor in the story, having twice turned 
down measures that would finance transportation improvements with a modest 
half-cent sales-tax increase. Riverside County voters looked farther up the 
road last year, so to speak, and passed just such a measured sales-tax 
increase, so their transportation commission is ready to begin work on the 
freeway. The problem is that without corresponding improvements in Orange 
County, traffic could simply pile up when the car-pool lanes disappeared at the 
Orange County boundary. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County officials are hoping Proposition 111 passes not because they 
would get funds for car-pool lanes on their side of the freeway but because it 
could make possible a bit of creative financing under which they could get 
their part of the freeway widened. 
</P>
<P>
Approval of Proposition 111 could provide a kind of loan guarantee that would 
make it more palatable for Riverside County to advance funds to Orange County 
for its car-pool lanes. Riverside has suggested it might be willing to do that 
if Proposition 111 passes, and if the voters who approved their sales-tax 
increase agreed it was all right. 
</P>
<P>
The state would have to be the financier in the end, because it would reimburse 
Riverside County after it had designated the project for funds. If that 
happened, it would take time for the project to move up on the priority list. 
But passage of Proposition 111 would give state officials some latitude to make 
a regional car-pool project work. 
</P>
<P>
There are lots of "if's" here. Projects from all over California would be 
competing for funds that would be available from its passage . Ideally, the 
installation of car-pool lanes along the Riverside Freeway should have been 
possible long before this. But versatile Proposition 111 has the potential to 
correct past oversights, and along the way make for good neighbors along a 
well-traveled commuter path.

REQUIEM FOR RAPED AND WEEPING EARTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scant months ago, one would have thought mankind knew all there was to know of 
tyrants with their deceits and infamies, great and petty. 
</P>
<P>
But the disintegration of communism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and 
the beginning of the dissolution of South African apartheid have revealed 
something unexpected: Along with their crimes against humanity, the tyrants of 
our own time have committed terrible wrongs against the Earth itself. Their 
illusory utopias were, as we now see, sustained through the callous plunder of 
their unborn children's environmental patrimony. 
</P>
<P>
The stories and photographs coming out of the ruins of the Eastern Bloc are 
horrifying. Many of its rivers are open sewers; its air is foul with fumes from 
outdated industrial and energy facilities fueled by dirty coal; forests are 
dying; ground water and soil have been poisoned by heedless discharge of 
chemical wastes. The conditions in sections of the Soviet Union appear even 
worse. Two recent disasters there -- the contamination from Chernobyl and the 
draining of the Aral Sea -- are among history's worst environmental 
catastrophes. 
</P>
<P>
As a report issued by the Worldwatch Institute documents, the situation in 
South Africa differs only in scope. To maintain its irrational system, Pretoria 
has herded half of all black South Africans onto 13% of the country's land. The 
consequence has been the transformation of these so-called "homelands" into 
deserts. 
</P>
<P>
To finance such injustice, South Africa relies on a mining industry whose 
safety and pollution record is the worst in the Western world. Unable to obtain 
other fuels because of its international isolation, Pretoria gets more of its 
energy from coal than any other country but North Korea. As a result, sulfur 
dioxide emissions are higher than those in East Germany and -- as the 
accompanying chart shows -- white South Africans are the world's highest 
emitters of carbon, a major contributor to the greenhouse effect. 
</P>
<P>
This is powerful testimony to the lunacy of injustice -- and a chilling 
reminder of the damage it ultimately does us all.

FLAG DEFACEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article on the May Day parade in Red Square ("Thousands Jeer Moscow 
Leaders," front page, May 2) provided renewed hope that the Russian people will 
be able to win meaningful freedom of speech. One part of the report, however, 
was astounding. 
</P>
<P>
Your reporter wrote: "One Soviet marcher also carried a Soviet flag with the 
hammer and sickle cut out as a symbol of his repudiation of Soviet rule." 
Apparently this marcher was not arrested. Yet, if he came to this country and 
wanted to protest, and he burned an American flag as his symbolic expression of 
something, our Congress and President would like to see to it that he is 
punished. 
</P>
<P>
Doesn't this article rather dramatically show that defacement of national flags 
is symbolic expression? We applaud the Soviet marcher because he is saying 
something, symbolically, of which we approve. However, we seem to dislike 
burning of the American flag because we don't like what the protester is 
saying, symbolically. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, it is clear that our new anti-flag burning law is attempting to control 
the content of symbolic expression. If Congress passes and the states ratify a 
constitutional amendment allowing the state and federal governments to outlaw 
defacement of our flag, then in at least one area of symbolic speech the 
Russian people will have greater rights than we. Is this what we want?

STAY THE BENIGN, UNRUFFLED COURSE; 
</P>
<P>
RHETORIC AND GRAND POSTURING HAVE THEIR MOMENTS. BUT DEMOCRACY'S FINEST HOUR IS 
NOT ONE OF THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MUELLER, John Mueller is a professor of political science at the 
University of Rochester and the author of Retreat from Doomsday: The 
Obsolescence of Major War (Basic Books, 1989). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are times in the course of international affairs when resounding rhetoric 
and grand ideas are called for. This isn't one of them. 
</P>
<P>
George Bush is constantly being criticized because he has greeted recent 
momentous changes in Europe and elsewhere with bland rhetoric, and because he 
projects no exalted sense of "vision" in international policy. Indeed, if 
Winston Churchill had met the German challenge during the Battle of Britain 
with Bush's oratorical flair, England might well have toppled gratefully into 
ignominious surrender. But rhetoric and grand posturing could make a difference 
in that case. Today, during democratic capitalism's finest hour, the best 
policy is one of benign, unruffled watchfulness. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the trends in foreign affairs are highly favorable: The enemy is 
evaporating; the Cold War is becoming history; war is declining in likelihood; 
democracy and capitalism are all the rage, and the American portion of the 
international economy moves along, on the whole, in quite tolerable shape. It 
may make sense to cheer these congenial trends on, and it might be useful to 
give some thought about what one might do if any of them began to show serious 
signs of reversing. But when history is so clearly on one's side, substantial 
efforts to influence or direct might only prove mischievous and 
counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
This would not be true if we really knew what caused these trends or if we had 
a good idea about how they could be shaped. But for the most part, we don't. 
</P>
<P>
Despite some occasional setbacks, democracy has been on the upswing for 200 
years now. The United States has been able to accelerate this trend in a few 
peculiar cases -- as when it forcefully demanded that the defeated states of 
World War II adopt democratic procedures. But America has mainly encouraged the 
trend by example, not by artificial manipulation. It once spent decades on end 
running around Latin America preaching the democratic gospel, only to see 
country after country revert to dictatorship. Democracy seems now to have 
become an idea whose time has come in Latin America. But manipulation by 
Washington deserves little credit for the fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Something similar could be said for the increasing attractiveness of capitalism 
around the world -- the North American, Japanese and West European example has 
been much more impres sive than tangible efforts to make the idea catch on. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is most often urged to come up with a new, dynamic vision to replace the 
policy of containment that is now becoming obviated by success. But there never 
was anything terribly dynamic about containment. Mostly, it involved patiently 
holding the line until communism reached a state of self-destruction. This has 
now come about -- not because we have been particularly good at holding the 
line but because the containment theorists were essentially correct in their 
conclusion that communism was inherently unstable and irrational. 
</P>
<P>
That is, communism is collapsing not so much because of anything we did but 
because the theologians in Moscow were building on fundamentally unsound ideas 
when they decided to adopt a vicious and unproductive economic and social 
system, to vastly over-build on defense and to grasp to their bosom a set of 
colonies that became draining economic and political liabilities. Western 
policy was not designed to force them to make those profound errors -- indeed, 
if the Communists had taken our advice, they never would have done such stupid 
things. When containing did become dynamic and manipulative, it led us into the 
Korean and Vietnam wars. It does not seem that either venture speeded 
communism's inevitable collapse very much (though the earlier war did save 
South Korea from communism). Thus, it makes more sense to argue that the Cold 
War was lost by the misguided policies of the East, not that it was won by the 
ingenious policies of the West. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s the United States tried to come up with dramatic and dynamic 
strategies to deal with terrorism. Presidential candidates vied about who could 
best "put an end" to the problem. The importance of the terrorist threat may 
well have been exaggerated (in the last decade more Americans have been killed 
by lightning than by terrorism) but the most effective policies have been ones 
that relied on quiet, routine police work, rather than on grand schemes or 
dramatic gestures. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, the hostage-taking fad seems now to be winding down. In large 
measure this is happening because, after years of hysteria that fed the egos of 
the kidnapers (while ruining the presidency of Jimmy Carter and almost ruining 
that of Ronald Reagan), we have finally decided that the best approach is to 
wait patiently for the petty international criminals holding the hostages to 
grow tired of their childish games. 
</P>
<P>
And, as many people have pointed out, the drug problem is more likely to be 
eased (it will never be reduced to "zero" as Bush pointlessly implied in one of 
his rare lapses into rhetoric) by mundane policies of education and treatment 
than by mobilizing aircraft carriers or interdicting commerce in South American 
jungles. 
</P>
<P>
In general, grand schemes and cosmic tinkering can be harmful because they tend 
to distract attention from the dull, mundane policies that are most likely to 
help -- and which can easily be reversed if they are found not to work. 
</P>
<P>
If a boulder is cascading down a hill, little needs to be done to enhance its 
progress. It is a sensible policy, if a rather unexciting one, to stand back 
and let gravity take its course. Similarly, American foreign policy should be 
principally devoted to avoiding zealous devices that merely complicate, and 
could potentially divert, history's remarkably congenial progress.

INVESTMENTS IN MAKING PEACE WORK; 
</P>
<P>
THE LION'S SHARE OF THE DIVIDEND SHOULD GO TO SIX MAJOR AREAS OF NATIONAL NEED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CRANSTON, Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) is a U.S. senator. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The inevitability of defense cuts makes it especially imperative that we 
Californians, with an economy so heavily dependent on defense industries, think 
seriously about how we can make peace work for us. 
</P>
<P>
How big a peace dividend will there be? After carefully studying the analyses 
of a number of respected experts -- including the Congressional Budget Office 
and the Brookings Institution -- I have concluded that we can safely cut 
military spending 33% below its present level by 1997, and accumulate a peace 
dividend of $375 billion in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Properly invested, this peace dividend could open up lucrative markets for new 
and existing commercial products, create thousands of new jobs and businesses 
and boost the productivity of the American worker. The resultant expansion in 
the nation's economy would help cut the federal deficit through increased 
federal revenues and reduced outlays for such things as welfare and 
unemployment compensation. 
</P>
<P>
But I propose that no more than 5% to 10% of the peace dividend go directly 
into deficit reduction, and that none of it be used as an excuse to cut taxes. 
We have too much work to do. Instead, the lion's share should be invested in 
six major areas of national need: 
</P>
<P>
* $60 billion to help upgrade education and overcome illiteracy. 
</P>
<P>
Productivity is directly related to education. America cannot compete in the 
world economy with a work force that can't read or write or is unschooled in 
math and science. 
</P>
<P>
Investing in teachers and in model math and science instruction will expand the 
need for learning-technology products. 
</P>
<P>
* $123 billion to modernize the nation's infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
Repair rutted highways and collapsing bridges, build ports and airports, and 
develop the rapid transit systems we need if our people and our products are 
not to strangle in gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
Investing in transportation would generate new demand and new markets for 
computerized traffic-monitoring systems, new materials for lighter-weight 
bridges, magnetically levitated trains, quieter aircraft and smarter cars. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation costs are a sizable component of the price of goods and services 
for domestic consumption and for export. The reliability and efficiency of our 
transportation facilities are keys to increased economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
* $62 billion more to clean up toxic waste, accelerate pollution control and 
enforce pollution prevention. 
</P>
<P>
The longer we delay cleaning up our land, air and water -- and developing 
non-toxic ways of doing business -- the greater will be the ultimate cost in 
health and in dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Investing in environmental cleanup could lead to developing crops that are more 
resistant to pests and to microorganisms that eat pollutants. It would spur new 
technologies to neutralize the toxics we've already spewed out and avoid future 
crises. 
</P>
<P>
* $61 billion to alleviate the lack of affordable housing that afflicts the 
poor and the middle class alike, and renew our nation's historic commitment to 
good housing. 
</P>
<P>
Investing in housing would be a boon to business in a number of ways: It would 
stimulate advances in new materials, such as composites, and encourage 
innovations for better living -- new heat exchange and air-circulation 
equipment, simplified wiring, more automation. 
</P>
<P>
Affordable housing closer to where people work would make for a more productive 
work force by reduce absenteeism and "commuter fatigue." 
</P>
<P>
* $53 billion to improve the nation's health care. 
</P>
<P>
Investing in health can lead to a new generation of biotechnology-based 
therapeutics to stimulate the body's own repair and immune mechanisms; new 
diagnostics to detect diseases earlier; new therapies to treat mental illness, 
cancer, anemia, Alzheimer's disease, AIDS and other ailments, and new 
technologies for elderly people and the disabled, such as voice-operated 
computers that read, write and talk. 
</P>
<P>
* $15 billion more for treatment, prevention and law enforcement in the 
underfunded fight against crime and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Investing in the fight against drugs and crime will add to the demand for new 
computer and laser technologies, many of which also have consumer uses. A 
victory in the war against drugs will give us two indispensable assets for a 
productive economy -- safe communities and a drug-free work force.

TREATED LIKE PEONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN BONZO, president of the Olvera Street Merchants Assn., says the city 
of Los Angeles has not treated her organization with respect. She told The 
Times: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We have been treated like peons now since 1953, since the government took 
control of (Olvera Street). Our voice has been excluded from management 
decisions, from cultural decisions, and our community seems to have now been 
excluded in the writing of the (plan). 
</P>
<P>
When they wrote the bidding documents (for the restoration project), they 
didn't consult with anybody in terms of historians, and our professionals that 
have significant insight into how those documents could have been drafted. 
</P>
<P>
I think it's just typical of the Department of Recreation and Parks to let that 
voice go unheard. I have tried very hard to establish credibility for the 
merchants, to be able to give them a voice, a real voice in the future of 
Olvera Street, because that's been absent. 
</P>
<P>
I question the city's position that they are not intending to spend a red 
nickel on their birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
I think that the city has a responsibility as this is their only historical, I 
should say their primary historical landmark, and the only cultural landmark 
dedicated to the Latino heritage.

PERSPECTIVE ON 'THE VISION THING';

George Bush knows that the United States' 45-year occupation rule of Europe is 
now over and that Americans are being pushed toward the periphery of European 
affairs by forces we can no longer control and sometimes can hardly influence. 
We can only understand them, and the President has given no proof that he does. 
</P>
<P>
Bush does have a strategy, I think. He believes a U.S. military role in Europe 
is essential to keeping the peace and a U.S. economic role is essential to 
American prosperity. So he is trying to retreat as slowly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
But we are being outflanked by events every day. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III seem to think this is a 
long-distance race, and they keep looking back to see where the other runners 
were and are, not realizing that they have been lapped already. Europe is on 
the Concorde.

CS NORTHRIDGE REACHES DIVISION II SOFTBALL FINAL FOUR FOR THE FINAL TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

SIOUX FALLS, S.D. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the ninth -- and final -- time in the last 10 years, Cal State Northridge 
will play for the NCAA Division II softball title when the national 
championships start Friday at Currie Stadium in Midland, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Matadors saw to that by defeating host Augustana College, 2-0, Sunday 
for the Midwest Regional title. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (49-19), which is headed for the Division I ranks next season, 
rolled through the regional with victories over Southern Illinois-Edwardsville 
(1-0) and Nebraska Omaha (3-0) on Saturday, before shutting out Augustana on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Debbie Dickmann, coming off two-hit and no-hit efforts Saturday, allowed 
only two singles against the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
Though she was not as overpowering against Augustana (two strikeouts) as she 
was against Southern Illinois-Edwardsville (10 strikeouts) or Nebraska-Omaha 
(nine), Dickmann (26-7, 20 shutouts) was every bit as effective. 
</P>
<P>
Only one Augustana (47-8) runner reached second -- in the fourth inning, Kathy 
Orstad hit a ground ball that took a wicked hop over shortstop Anna Getherall's 
left shoulder for a hit before advancing on Kim Sudbeck's sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
But Orstad advanced no further as Ferris Grund and Chris Ross grounded out to 
Getherall. 
</P>
<P>
"My body felt good, but my arm felt tired today, which is to be expected," 
Dickmann said. 
</P>
<P>
The win was the seventh in a row for Northridge and the 19th in CSUN's last 21 
games. But more important is the fact that it propels the Lady Matadors into 
the Final Four, which they missed last season after losing to Cal State 
Bakersfield in the West Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
"That makes it a lot more sweeter," Dickmann said. "Any time you get to the 
Final Four, it's special. But after losing last year, we really wanted to go 
back." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge scored the only run Dickmann would need in the top of the first. 
Lisa Erickson, who was 4 for 8 and scored three times in the tournament, 
singled, went to second on Getherall's sacrifice, took third on a passed ball, 
and scored on Erin McGuire's single. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Matadors added an insurance run off Teresa Hartman (44-8) in the 
fifth. Lesley Plank led off with a single and was replaced by pinch-runner Lisa 
Ferracone, who took second on Krista Miller's sacrifice, went to third on an 
infield single by Leilani Artis and scored on a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"You never know what's going to happen, but I felt like we only needed to get 
one run to win today," Northridge Coach Gary Torgeson said. "Last year, Debbie 
came into the playoffs hurt and tired, but this year, she's peaking. She hasn't 
thrown as many innings and it shows." 
</P>
<P>
Dickmann was one of six CSUN players named to the All-Region team. The others 
were outfielders Erickson, McGuire and Artis, second baseman Plank and 
Getherall. 
</P>
<P>
"We seem to be on a roll, but I still feel like we're capable of playing better 
that we did here," Torgeson said. "Our pitching was there and our defense was 
there, but we're still not hitting the ball like we're capable of. "Hopefully, 
that will change this week."

"complete sculpturing" which included cheekbone augmentation, eye restoration, 
removal of silicone from previous cosmetic surgery and regluing of his nose, 
said Blackwell's spokesman Michael Sands. Regluing of his nose? Blackwell, 
whose real name is Richard Sylvan Seltzer, had a nose job previously and it got

Drat Cat: Tony La Russa, manager of the Oakland Athletics, has gone to bat for 
a cat that disrupted a baseball game last week by running across the field. La 
Russa took the cat to a clinic to have her spayed and arranged to find her a 
home. Several feral cats live at the Oakland Coliseum, but they usually stay 
out of the way during ballgames. But when the A's played the New York Yankees 
last week, the cat darted out. Players stood by and some 30,000 fans roared as 
the cat tried unsuccessfully to hop the backstop behind home plate, then dashed 
into the A's dugout.

King Flap: Martin Luther King III, a county commissioner in Fulton, Ga., is 
under scrutiny for giving his cousin a county job. Isaac N. Farris Jr., 28, 
makes only a $1 a year, but he has access to a county car, office, travel 
budget and other perks under a contract that says he is to perform 
administrative services at King's discretion. "Such a contract inevitably will 
appear to be a sweetheart deal to the public," said another commissioner, 
Gordon Joyner. King defended his cousin by saying, "What the county is getting 
is a man who is worth $40,000 or $50,000 a year for only a dollar. I don't 
believe that I've done anything wrong."

TRIBUTE TO TRUMPETER-COMPOSER ROGERS A NOSTALGIC TRIUMPH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nostalgia is what it used to be. Friday's tribute to Shorty Rogers, produced 
and emceed by Ken Poston for KLON-FM and presented at the Hermosa Civic 
Theater, was sold out weeks in advance and drew a crowd liberally sprinkled 
with fans for whom the trumpeter-composer symbolizes an era in West Coast jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers himself did not take part, except to join briefly with Terry Gibbs and 
Chubby Jackson in the scat vocal on "Lemon Drop" and to receive a salutation 
from Councilman Michael Woo. For the most part he sat in the audience beaming 
while Poston took the honoree smoothly through a "This Is Your Life." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the evening's top honors went to the only artist who didn't play 
any Rogers tunes. Stan Getz, paying eloquent verbal tribute to Rogers, conjured 
sheer beauty out of "Suddenly It's Spring," "A Handful of Stars" and a bossa 
nova, "The Dolphin." Nobody could top those blissful minutes, but some came 
close. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Masters led a 15-piece group that served as a house band, simulating the 
sounds of the groups in which Rogers had played: Woody Herman, the Lighthouse 
All Stars, the Shorty Rogers Giants and, of course, Stan Canton (for this 
segment Masters added 14 young string players recruited from Long Beach State). 
</P>
<P>
Rogers' versatility as a composer was represented by everything from a witty 
blues riff piece ("Martians Come Home"), played by the Lighthouse group, to an 
alto sax concerto originally written for and entitled "Art Pepper," brought 
vividly to new life by Gabe Baltazar. The strings were used here, and again in 
"Coop's Solo," composed for Bob Cooper, who later shared space with fellow 
saxophonist Bud Shank and Bill Perkins in the Lighthouse set, along with 
trumpeter Conte Candoli. 
</P>
<P>
Several film clips were shown, supplied by archivist Mark Cantor, but the first 
one was mangled through misthreading and the others were seldom in focus (a 
D-minus for the projectionist). Still, it was intriguing to see these glimpses 
of the young black-haired jazzman who later appeared on stage, white-haired but 
musically stronger than ever. 
</P>
<P>
With Lou Levy or Pete Jolly on piano, Monty Budwig on bass and Paul Humphrey on 
drums, the music swung buoyantly. Spelling the musicians were producers who 
played a role in Rogers' evolution: Gene Norman, Jack Lewis, Howard Rumsey and 
Bobby Troup (who introduced a rare clip from his 1958 "Stars of Jazz" TV 
series). Their recollections were affectionate rather than affected, often 
diverting and never dreary. 
</P>
<P>
If it proved nothing else, this well-organized evening left no doubt that the 
California jazz sounds of the 1950s, so often maligned as too cool or as 
vanilla music, had a validity that has survived unscarred by the inroads of 
time.

Matisse Thief Fined: A burglar who broke into the former apartment of artist 
Henri Matisse in Nice, France, and stole a cache of paintings last December has 
been fined $1.6 million for damaging the works. 
</P>
<P>
The Correctional Tribunal of Nice also handed down a three-year suspended 
sentence to Frank Cochet, who stole $12.9 million in paintings. Police said 
Cochet damaged several works as he ripped them out of their frames. Art 
restorers said the damage done to the works would require the amount of the 
fine to repair. The damage to "Pink Nude" alone depreciated its value from $4.3 
million to $1.2 million. GREG BRAXTON

It's a Fake!: Some art connoisseurs in Canada's New Brunswick province are 
red-faced after finding out that their prized pieces are fakes. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg Robert Galbraith pleaded guilty to peddling as many as 200 forgeries to 
unsuspecting buyers, including the New Brunswick Museum, over a three-year 
period. Police said Galbraith bought paintings by unknown artists at sales in 
Montreal and Toronto for about $85, then forged the signatures or initials of 
celebrated maritime artists such as A. Y. Jackson, Jack Humphrey and Violet 
Gillett. He then sold the paintings through two reputable auctioneers for as 
much $3,420 each, netting $88,035 on the scam.GREG BRAXTON

Stormy Cellist: Cellist Mstislav Rostropovich stormed out of a performance at a 
Rome concert hall because he was being televised without advance warning. In a 
letter published in Rome's Il Tempo newspaper, Rostropovich said he left during 
the intermission of a concert at the Santa Cecilia Academy on Friday "because I 
did not feel I could give the public my best and because the first half was 
already ruined." 
</P>
<P>
Friends said Rostropovich was so furious that he left his priceless 
Stradivarius cello behind in the concert hall and walked back to his hotel in 
the pouring rain. Rostropovich, who is the music director of the National 
Symphony, wrote that he dislikes being filmed: "It is probably an artistic 
defect but I cannot concentrate in such circumstances because when I play for 
the camera, I lose all intimacy with the public." GREG BRAXTON

REALITY GETS MOLESTED BY ROMANCE IN 'SHOW OF FORCE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"A Show of Force" (citywide) is a political thriller that spins giddily between 
fact and fancy, shocks and romance, politics and sex -- and sometimes it's 
difficult to guess whether the sex is there to sell the politics or vice versa. 
Either way, they don't jell. The politics get glossed up and trivialized by the 
sex. The sex has too frantic and nervous an edge. 
</P>
<P>
The movie, adapted from "Murder Under Two Flags" by occasional Times 
contributor Anne Nelson, is based on the Cerro Maravilla incident, a Puerto 
Rican political scandal stemming from the police slaying of two young 
dissidents during a bungled communications station takeover. At the time, in 
1978, the Puerto Rican government made capital out of the alleged sabotage. 
Later, it was discovered that the victims -- independistas who believed in 
secession from the United States -- had been lured to the shoot-out by a police 
informant and executed after they'd already surrendered. The resulting cover-up 
and scandal brought down the commonwealth's administration. 
</P>
<P>
This is potent stuff. But, in the movie, reality is molested by romance. I 
haven't read Nelson's book, but I have my doubts that -- as we're shown here -- 
the main reporter covering the scandal (Amy Irving) was engaged in a long 
menacing flirtation with the informant (Lou Diamond Phillips) or that he later 
kidnaped her, ripped her clothes and fondled her in a cockfight ring, before 
dumping her off the next day. Or that she never mentioned this episode to 
anybody. 
</P>
<P>
Other implausibilities follow: live candid camera exposes, Judas goat 
shoot-outs in crowded restaurants and the presence of Irving's character at 
almost every significant event over the six-year span of the story, except the 
actual shoot-out. Even if it all is true, as shown here, it doesn't ring true. 
And the absurdity of the possible inventions almost taints the portrayal of the 
real-life murders and cover-up, which seem all too believable. 
</P>
<P>
The director, Bruno Barreto, has a creamy romantic style. But his flair for 
evocative, sunny backgrounds and eroticism may be part of the trouble. He's so 
good at whipping up a sensual atmosphere that he may be impatient with the 
cool, clear, scary narrative line the movie needs. Perhaps he's torn between 
pleasuring us and showing us the face of oppression. 
</P>
<P>
Barreto seems to hook into the film better visually than verbally. He and Amy 
Irving became a couple during filming, but he often seems uncomfortable with 
the English language dialogue, even though his actors include Irving, Phillips, 
Andy Garcia as a relentless prosecutor, Robert Duvall as a sort of turncoat Lou 
Grant and Kevin Spacey as a sinister, apocryphal FBI agent, who announces, 
improbably, "I'm one of the good guys!" 
</P>
<P>
With dialogue like this, perhaps Barreto should be uncomfortable. Co-written by 
producer John Strong and that usually fine scenarist Evan Jones, some of it is 
punchy and vivid; most of it preaches woodenly to the converted. "A Show of 
Force" (MPAA rated R for sex, language and violence) might actually play better 
subtitled, in a foreign language. In many ways, it's a brave film, but it tries 
too hard to cover itself. Like the Puerto Rican government that fell because of 
Cerro Maravilla, it stumbles on surfaces, gets too fixated on public image.

POP CAPSULES : WHITESNAKE ENSHROUDED IN CLICHES AT IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the record industry really wants to protect America's impressionable youth, 
it should adopt a new cautionary sticker that goes something like this: 
"Warning -- cliched lyrics. Contents devoid of original thought or vivid 
expression. 
</P>
<P>
This music may induce mental torpor." 
</P>
<P>
They could launch the campaign by slapping a big sticker on Whitesnake. It's 
too late, though, for the thousands who were subjected to nearly two hours of 
the heavy-metal band's numbing rock-by-rote on Friday at Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
Whitesnake's utter lack of imagination was encoded in songs based on such 
worn-out pop notions as "crying in the rain" and "the still of the night." 
Sometimes an ignited performance can compensate for hackneyed material. But 
Whitesnake, though passably energetic, evoked almost nothing. Guitarist Steve 
Vai gets some credit for putting across his standard metal swoops and whinnies 
with lively showmanship.MIKE BOEHM

POP CAPSULES : SOME ICY CHILLS FROM NEW ZEALAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aptly named, the Chills play music about the big chill -- slipping mortal 
coils, that is -- and a lot of little chills as well, yet they do it with 
enough underlying warmth and resolve that it somehow never seems remotely 
morbid. Never entirely shedding the icy reserve their moniker would indicate, 
yet never aloof or depressive, the Chills -- who headlined two Roxy shows 
Friday -- are like the shivers you suddenly get in the midst of a fever, 
simultaneously discomforting and oddly pleasurable. 
</P>
<P>
We should all get so sick. 
</P>
<P>
Like his hero Brian Wilson, who "just wasn't made for this world," lead Chill 
Martin Phillipps seeks relief from it -- through childhood fantasies, saving 
relationships or, yes, death (the dreamy "Heavenly Pop Hit," in which he finds 
it's a wonderful afterlife). Among the acclaimed New Zealand quintet's first 
set Friday, only "Heavenly" proved especially hooky. Better yet, though, were 
the uncommonly lovely 6/4 harmonics of "Effloresce and Deliquesce." If the 
Chills seem to run both hot and cold, lukewarm never sounded so good.CHRIS 
WILLMAN

POP CAPSULES : MISSION ACCOMPLISHED, BUT 'STUFF'S A WONDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Compare these two overheard observations about the Mission U.K. and the Wonder 
Stuff when the English bands shared a bill at the Hollywood Palladium on 
Friday. On the Mission: "They sound like everybody, and they sound like 
nobody." 
</P>
<P>
And the Wonder Stuff: "They sound like nobody else." 
</P>
<P>
The headlining Mission piled up many influences and styles -- from Sgt. Pepper 
psychedelia to Led Zep weightiness -- yet operated in an artistic void. On the 
other hand, the Stuff, with perhaps even more identifiable influences, made its 
folk-rock/grunge-rock brew seem effortlessly original. 
</P>
<P>
Encores of Patti Smith's "Dancing Barefoot" (a solo acoustic spot for head 
Missionary Wayne Hussey) and the Cure's "In Between Days" provided the only 
real context for the Mission's music. But the Wonder Stuff's surprising melding 
of John Lennon's tortured "Gimme Me Some Truth" and Jane's Addiction's equally 
tormented "Jane Says" served to sharpen and expand already winning impressions. 
And where Hussey performed as if he has some heavy message to impart, the 
Wonder Stuff's Miles Hunt looked as if he was doing this just because he felt 
like it. STEVE HOCHMAN

DURANG'S 'LAUGHING WILD' EXPLAINS IT ALL FOR YOU AT TIFFANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Somehow you knew, in the self-satisfied leer she offered at the end of 
Christopher Durang's "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You," that we 
hadn't heard the last of Sister Mary. 
</P>
<P>
She herself is not back, but her spirit is, in Durang's "Laughing Wild," which 
opened Saturday at the Tiffany Theatre. This series of monologues, sparked by 
an incident in the canned tuna fish aisle of the supermarket, explains it all 
for us. Here we discover what happened to Sister Mary's little boys and girls 
when they grew up and entered the real world. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing good. 
</P>
<P>
"Laughing Wild," a phrase taken from Samuel Beckett's "Happy Days" (who took it 
from Thomas Gray's "Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College,") is the sound 
of one mind slipping. The phrase and the laughter are used over and over by 
this angry and nameless young woman in Durang's play, in her effort to cope. 
</P>
<P>
That she lives in New York may not be her fault, but you can see how it 
compounds the problem. So does the fact that the author neglected to name her. 
That must make her feel like a real nobody. As she never tires of telling us, 
she hates everybody: Mother Theresa, Sally Jessy Raphael ("Who is Sally Jesse 
Raphael? does anybody know? . . ."), A. A., Dr. Ruth Westheimer and, in due 
course, the Infant of Prague. One can say this for her: She's an 
equal-opportunity hater. 
</P>
<P>
She has the misfortune (or perhaps he has the misfortune) of meeting an equally 
nameless young man in the market's tuna fish section. Because he's in her way 
and taking too long about it, she knocks him down with a tuna fish can. That's 
not giving away important plot points, because it's the first thing this woman 
tells us, repeating it several times thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
The incident merely unleashes the play: a garrulous recounting of events 
peppered with free associations that stream from her consciousness and may send 
her right back to Creedmoor. No, that's not the school where Sister Mary 
teaches, but close. It's the mental institution where this non-coper has 
already completed three involuntary semesters. 
</P>
<P>
Through his own set of free associations, we eventually get to know the young 
man that this woman attacked almost as well as we know her. He's at least as 
peculiar. But instead of laughing wild as she does, he smiles a lot. He's the 
type who goes in for affirmations of life, such as the Harmonic Convergence and 
other feel-good therapies. Up to a point. He too loves to tell all about his 
insecurities, his sexual ambivalence, his fear for the ozone layer and that 
terrifying woman he met at the store. 
</P>
<P>
As with "Sister Ignatius," Durang gives minimal structure to "Laughing Wild," 
which consists of his-and-her monologues in Act I and crossover nightmares in 
Act II, and which is not immune to repetitiveness. Essentially, it's a great 
excuse for him to hilariously air his personal beefs and skewer his personal 
demons through this hapless pair of blundering alter egos. You can all but 
taste the glee with which they tear down all known inconsistencies of the 
modern world -- from its broader existential senselessness to its more diurnal 
absurdities. 
</P>
<P>
"Wild's" barbs are savagely, consistently on target, though at some serious 
risk of self-defeat. The play's references to figures of such fleeting 
celebrity as Westheimer, Phil Donahue or Tony Orlando and Dawn, and even to 
such events as the Harmonic Convergence, may not mean much some 20 or more 
years from now. Or less. 
</P>
<P>
On the bigger issues, there is no such concern. Even more than in "Sister 
Mary," formalized religion is in for it. It takes a good Catholic boy like 
Durang to feel as rabidly anti-Christian as he does. When his target isn't God 
himself, it is everything God has wrought or neglected to prevent, such as the 
Holocaust, the freedom of sexual choice, famine and AIDS. Clearly, if you are a 
true believer, this play is not for you. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Erdman directed "Wild," without entirely solving its major flaw: a 
tendency to overdo. Funny is always funnier in short, sharp stings. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Smart and playwright Durang himself, in his first Los Angeles stage 
appearance, play the woman and man -- and astutely, though, even disheveled, 
Smart seems a little too gorgeously together for someone who is laughing wild 
on the brink. But her laugh -- a raucous, back-of-the-throat wild howl, like a 
saxophone gone awry -- is not easy to forget. 
</P>
<P>
As for Durang, who stepped in as the young man when Harry Groener bowed out 
over "artistic differences," he has the wry, cherubic demeanor of an aging 
choir-boy. It's perfect casting. He and Smart make mincemeat of false piety and 
modern existence by standing as physical opposites to the thoughts they 
deliver. "Laughing Wild," structurally flawed as it is (and no more so than 
"Sister Mary"), is forgiven almost all its transgressions for providing grand 
satire -- a rara avis in a post-Reagan world that is licking its wounds.

HEAVY-HANDED NARRATION UNDERMINES 'LOCAL HEROES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Local Heroes, Global Change" (airing at 10 tonight on KCET Channel 28) is a 
four-part series that claims to examine fresh solutions to the Third World's 
poverty and hunger. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's segment, "With Our Own Eyes," offers a look at two programs that are 
successful -- according to the show's philosophical underpinning -- primarily 
because they are not large international aid programs. 
</P>
<P>
That philosophical bias is a major problem of "With Our Own Eyes" -- 
significant enough to undermine much of the good intentions of the producers. 
The program sets up straw dogs like "Bad Big Government" with unsupported 
statements such as "famines have all been political," then knocks them down 
without demonstrating any basis for those allegations. 
</P>
<P>
The segment on Indonesian rice growing is a perfect example. Instead of simply 
saying that the original "Green Revolution" wasn't a complete success, "Eyes" 
makes it look almost sinister. In reality, the program made some mistakes 
through the years -- over-reliance on pesticides, for example -- and new 
methods have been found that are better. The same could be said for nearly any 
human enterprise. Would the producers have preferred that no foreign aid was 
given? 
</P>
<P>
Few would argue with the idea that development programs work best when they are 
tailored for the local culture. But "With Our Own Eyes" argues that there are 
hidden political forces -- the big "isms" of course: racism, sexism and so on 
-- hindering such efforts. Again, little proof is offered, and the show's 
heavy-handed narration almost defeats an otherwise engrossing segment on 
Bangladesh's Grameen Bank, a loan program targeted to the landless and women.

THE DESPAIR OF THE RICH AND FAMOUS IS 'OVEREXPOSED' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "Overexposed," (selected theaters), a super-derivative, very minor slasher 
thriller from the Roger Corman Concorde factory, we meet comely soap opera star 
Kristen (Catherine Oxenberg), bedeviled by weirdo fans who stalk her and, 
apparently, an anonymous maniac somehow connected with the dim traumas of her 
Port Arthur childhood. Her co-stars die or disappear mysteriously, their faces 
melted into bloody latex globs. Her live-in boyfriend (David Naughton) is 
something of a shmo. Crazed couch potatoes (Karen Black, no less) harass her at 
the studio gate. 
</P>
<P>
What a life! "Overexposed" is one more movie thriller that invites us to 
commiserate with the despair of the rich or glamorous, walled up in their 
beachside bungalows, unable to live normally, weighed down by all that money, 
fame and sex, terrorized by crazed "others" trying to get at them. 
</P>
<P>
As a thriller, "Overexposed" is underdone. There are slow-mo shocker flashbacks 
that don't shock, a mystery that doesn't really mystify, the usual wisecracking 
cops and creepy music oozing up whenever night falls. There's also a "surprise" 
climax that breaks down due to makeup problems. 
</P>
<P>
But, as a sexy drama-comedy, the movie has some potential -- mostly dribbled 
away, but enough to give the makers some encouragement. Director co-writer 
Larry Brand, who has an active camera, also occasionally shows a brisk, 
irreverent take on TV production and a good sense of how to fill out a scene 
with offbeat character touches. The actors are pretty relaxed -- so much so 
that Naughton's stiffness comes across as a personality bit. 
</P>
<P>
It's all to little purpose. Brand and co-writer Rebecca Reynolds get trapped 
and chewed up in the generic slasher conventions just as their heroine is 
chopped up in the daytime TV mill. The problem with being a "B" movie like 
"Overexposed" (MPAA rated: R, for sex, violence, language and nudity) in an age 
when many of the "A" movies are trying ineptly to sound like the old "B's," is 
that, sooner or later, quality completely bottoms out. Corman should know this 
better than anyone. It's probably impossible to make a good movie about a soap 
opera star terrorized by a maniac who leaves nasty notes and melts off people's 
faces. And, even if it were possible, why try?MICHAEL WILMINGTON

KNBC OFFERS TEMPERATE 'ROCK THE HOUSE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yo! NBC raps. 
</P>
<P>
The network makes a hyperactive prime-time move into pop music's hottest corner 
with a half-hour pilot airing tonight at 8 on KNBC Channel 4. 
</P>
<P>
"Rock the House" is thin on actual live rap performances, but it has a winning 
personality -- high-energy without seeming high-pressure. A segment of homemade 
videos from high schools (and one preschool) around the country generates a 
nice sense of community. 
</P>
<P>
You get one song each from two legitimately happening rap acts, Kid N' Play and 
Young M.C., and lots of routines by a pelvicentric troupe called the Dance 
Possey, all of it jazzed up by some slow-motion and black-and-white effects. An 
audience mills around and pumps its fists in a funky, warehouse-like set, and 
D. J. Romeo presides over this hip-hop "Hullabaloo" with a proper enthusiasm.

The pilot gives no indication that "Rock the House" is ready to tackle the 
touchier aspects of the dynamic and often controversial world of rap. Welcome 
to the temperate zone. RICHARD CROMELIN

DODGERS GET NEW OUTFIELDER; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: THEY TRADE SECOND BASEMAN WILLIE RANDOLPH TO THE OAKLAND A'S FOR STAN 
JAVIER, WHO WILL PLAY CENTER FIELD.

<P>
When the Dodgers acquired Stan Javier from the Oakland Athletics for second 
basemen Willie Randolph, it meant more than adding a new outfielder to the L.A. 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
The move allowed Juan Samuel to shift to second base, where he would prefer to 
play, and set up some question marks for the Dodger outfield, which Kirk Gibson 
may or may not eventually answer. 
</P>
<P>
The deal was put together Saturday night, but not officially announced until 
1:25 a.m. EDT on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a number of factors that went into this trade," Dodger General 
Manager Fred Claire said. "First of all, we feel we're getting a fine young 
player in Stan Javier. We also have to look ahead to the return of Kirk Gibson. 
Kirk has been making good progress and we feel he'll be ready soon." 
</P>
<P>
Claire also said he looks for center fielder Samuel to move to second base, 
where he played five seasons for Philadelphia, at "the appropriate time." 
</P>
<P>
"We will miss Willie, but I realize they had a need," Samuel said. "He 
protected me a lot when I was on base." 
</P>
<P>
The A's, the defending World Series champions, lead the American League West 
with a 22-8 record. Now, they appear even stronger. 
</P>
<P>
Randolph, former captain for the New York Yankees, was signed as a free agent 
by the Dodgers before the 1989 season. He hit .282 and was a member of the 
National League All-Star team. 
</P>
<P>
In 26 games this season, he was batting .271 with one home run and nine RBIs. 
Javier was hitting .242 with three RBIs in 19 games for the A's. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Gallego took over as the A's second baseman after Tony Phillips signed as 
a free agent with Detroit following last season. 
</P>
<P>
Gallego, however, was hitting .178 with one homer and eight RBIs. The A's have 
also used Lance Blankenship at second. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to look at the middle infield situation as a whole," A's General 
Manager Sandy Alderson said. "We didn't have adequate backup to Walt Weiss at 
shortstop or adequate backup to Carney Lansford at third base. We do have 
Blankenship, who can play second base and outfield." 
</P>
<P>
The players are expected to join their teams today. The Dodgers play the 
Montreal Expos tonight at Dodgers Stadium. The A's play at Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old Randolph was traded to New York by Pittsburgh prior to the 1976 
season and became one of the greatest second basemen in Yankees' history. 
</P>
<P>
He helped New York win four pennants and two World Series between 1976-81. He 
was also named to the All-Star team six times, including last season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to have the opportunity to go to a team like Oakland," Randolph 
said. "I really enjoyed my time in Los Angeles. I was treated very well. But 
I'm very happy to have this opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Randolph will be reunited with former Yankee outfielder Rickey Henderson, 
batting second behind the left fielder. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I fit in well with their team," Randolph said. "This is the first time 
I've ever been traded. I was caught off guard. I knew that the Dodgers were 
thinking of making changes, but I never thought I fit into that." 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees decided not to keep Randolph after signing free agent second 
baseman Steve Sax. There was speculation Randolph might sign with Oakland after 
the 1988 season. 
</P>
<P>
"We've wanted Randolph for a long time," A's Manager Tony La Russa said. "We 
personally made a trip to his home on the way to the winter meetings. But the 
Dodgers offered him a better deal, so he went with them. We never felt we were 
desperate to make a deal. We wanted to wait for a quality player." 
</P>
<P>
"This winter, there were rumors about me going to various clubs like Oakland 
and Milwaukee," Randolph said. "I knew Oakland wanted me. It's kind of funny 
that I end up there." 
</P>
<P>
Alderson said he's not worried about Randolph's age. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not 29, he's 36," Alderson said. "Probably he's not what he was at the 
age of 29, but based on what we understand, he's still an outstanding defensive 
second baseman." 
</P>
<P>
Randolph was hitless in four at-bats in his final game as a Dodger, Saturday's 
7-0 loss to Frank Viola and the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
It also proved to be the final game of the road trip for the Dodgers, because 
Sunday's scheduled series finale with the Mets at Shea Stadium was postponed 
due to rain. 
</P>
<P>
The teams played two innings with the Mets leading, 1-0, on a bases-loaded walk 
to Mike Marshall by Tim Belcher in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
After a long delay, the grounds crew started to remove the tarp but the rain 
resumed a few minutes later. The umpires waited two hours and 52 minutes before 
postponing the game. 
</P>
<P>
No makeup date was announced. The Dodgers are next at Shea Stadium Aug. 14-16. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers concluded their road trip 1-7, losing the last six games.

BULLS WIN; 76ERS RUN ON EMPTY AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
EASTERN CONFERENCE: PHILADELPHIA WASTES NINE-POINT LEAD IN FOURTH QUARTER AT 
HOME AND NOW TRAILS, THREE GAMES TO ONE. JORDAN SCORES 45 IN CHICAGO'S 111-101 
VICTORY.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The champions went a round too long again, only this time there was no being 
saved by the bell. They collapsed with enough force to drive a year's worth of 
work six feet under. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlantic Division champion Philadelphia 76ers were rocked by a 19-3 run to 
start the fourth quarter Sunday, and the Chicago Bulls pulled away to a 111-101 
victory that gave them a three-games-to-one lead in their Eastern Conference 
semifinal playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls, without starting forward Scottie Pippen because of the death of his 
father in Arkansas, can advance to play either Detroit or New York by winning 
at home Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In Game 1, the 76ers missed several opportunities to take control down the 
stretch. In Game 2, they blew a 16-point second-quarter lead. In Game 3, a 
27-point lead disintegrated to three late in the game, but they held on to win. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time a 27-point lead is cut down to three, it's got to be in the back of 
your mind," said Chicago's Ed Nealy, who keyed the Bulls' surge from a 
nine-point deficit and finished with nine points and nine rebounds in 22 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"That was probably the best thing that happened to us. . . . When we made 
another run today, it definitely had to be creeping into their minds." 
</P>
<P>
The 76ers have been outscored by 33 points in the fourth quarter in the last 
two games at the Spectrum -- 19 and 14, respectively. Sunday, they made 22% of 
their shots in the last 12 minutes (four of 18). They made only six of 14 
fourth-period free throws and sank only 22 of 34 for the game. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Charles Barkley of the 76ers made two of eight free throws, missing 
five in a row during the Bulls' 19-3 burst. He finished with 22 points and 13 
rebounds, but more accurately assessed his performance after the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to say this and not take any questions," Barkley said. "Obviously, 
my free-throw shooting cost us the game. I missed the free throws. That blew 
the game. That's it." 
</P>
<P>
Could this taciturn player really be Charles Barkley? 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't talk as much," said the Bulls' Michael Jordan, who had 45 points, 11 
assists and six rebounds. "When he's talking, he's motivated. . . . But you 
could see his batteries were running down." 
</P>
<P>
The 76ers did not trail until the fourth quarter, having shot 57%, 64% and 52% 
in the first three periods. The lead was 86-77 with 12 minutes to play, and 
Scott Brooks' three-point jumper with 10:57 left made the score 89-80. 
</P>
<P>
But a rebound lay-in by Nealy, Jordan's three-pointer from the right side and 
another rebound put back in by Nealy brought the Bulls within 90-87. Jordan 
then made a jumper from the left side, and the score was 90-89. Barkley had 
already missed three of four free throws in that stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, with 8:13 to play, Bill Cartwright's baseline jumper over Mike Gminski 
put Chicago ahead, 91-90. The Bulls, who ended a five-game losing streak at the 
Spectrum, did not let up until they had a 99-92 lead with 4:29 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan scored nine points during the run, during which the Bulls looked like 
sprinters and the 76ers resembled marathoners who had hit the wall. Seven of 
Jordan's points during the run came from close range. 
</P>
<P>
"I know they might foul me, but I can't worry about that," Jordan said. "I 
can't be afraid of that. I've got to go in where I live." 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia still had a chance as late as 1:14, when Johnny Dawkins made two 
free throws to pull the 76ers within 106-101. But those were the 76ers' last 
points. 
</P>
<P>
"We said we were going to win this one for our mothers and Scottie Pippen," 
said Chicago's Stacey King, who moved into the starting lineup in place of 
Pippen and scored 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
"Philadelphia is known to get tired in the fourth quarter. Their bench is not 
really deep. We knew if we kept putting pressure on them, their legs would go 
out." 
</P>
<P>
All of which puts Philadelphia a game away of going out for good. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to regroup and stay confident," Dawkins said. "Things like this 
happen."

MORNING BRIEFING: TIME IS NO EQUALIZER FOR MIKE TYSON'S NEXT OPPONENT

Olympic gold medalist Henry Tillman will be a heavy underdog when he fights 
former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson June 16 at Las Vegas, but Tillman 
remembers when things were different. 
</P>
<P>
Tillman beat Tyson twice when they were amateurs to make the 1984 U.S. Olympic 
team, but what he remembers most about those days was that they were in the 
same financial situation -- both were broke. 
</P>
<P>
"What I remember is back then we were receiving per diem as amateurs," said 
Tillman, who will make $250,000 for the Tyson fight, by far his biggest purse. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, he's a millionaire." 
</P>

Trivia Time: When was the last time in the major leagues that different players 
from one team led their league in home runs three consecutive seasons? 
</P>
<P>
Relieved of command: Winning 52 games this season, finishing only one game 
behind Philadelphia in the Atlantic Division and returning the Boston Celtics 
to respectability wasn't enough for Coach Jimmy Rodgers, who was fired after 
the Celtics were knocked out of the NBA playoffs by the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
When reporters asked for an explanation, General Manager Jan Volk said: "In 
situations like this, you replace the generals. You can't replace the soldiers. 
You can't replace the soldiers as easily as you replace the generals. The 
generals are on the firing line as far as that is concerned." 
</P>
<P>
Guess that means the Celtics won some battles, but lost the war. 
</P>
<P>
Add coaches: Doug Collins, fired by the Chicago Bulls last year, is considered 
to be one of the best unemployed coaches around, but when teams call him he 
tells them there's no chance he will be back on the bench in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
Collins says he enjoys his job as a TV analyst much more than coaching. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not interested in coaching right now," Collins said. "The players are 
making a ton of money. The players have a tremendous amount of control. You 
have management and you have players. And there's the coach, he doesn't have a 
shot." 
</P>
<P>
Smoking lamp is out: You have to hand it to the Minnesota Timberwolves for 
making the welfare of their fans the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
When the NBA expansion team was presented with a petition from anti-smoking 
activists, the club decided to prohibit smoking in its new arena. 
</P>
<P>
"In the long run, this is the best thing for the organization, and the (team's) 
contributions to the community will be enhanced by this," said Bill Robertson, 
the Timberwolves' director of media services. 
</P>
<P>
Not only that, the Timberwolves won't sell advertising space to tobacco 
companies, which could cost the team $500,000 a year.

Trivia answer: Orlando Cepeda (46), Willie Mays (49) and Willie McCovey (44) of

HALF OF EWING NOT ENOUGH FOR THE KNICKS; 
</P>
<P>
EASTERN CONFERENCE: PISTONS TAKE 3-1 EDGE WITH 102-90 VICTORY. NEW YORK'S 
FOUL-PLAGUED CENTER HAS 30 POINTS AFTER PLAYING SIX MINUTES IN FIRST HALF.

<TEXT>
<P>
The New York Knicks didn't get a point from Patrick Ewing in the first half 
Sunday, and he scored 30 in the second. 
</P>
<P>
Both ways, the Detroit Pistons came out a winner, outscoring the Knicks in 
every quarter for a 102-90 victory and a three-games-to-one lead in their NBA 
playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons took the lead for good in the first half when Ewing played six 
minutes and took only one shot because of foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing played the entire second half, scoring 12 points in the third quarter and 
18 in the fourth. Despite a Knick rally that cut a 15-point deficit to five in 
the final minutes, Detroit still outscored New York in the final period. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no use crying over spilled milk, but it might have been a different 
game if I had played the first half," said Ewing, who scored 45 points in 
Saturday's victory over the Pistons. "They were double-teaming me, which they 
haven't done all season. I guess they didn't want me to get 45 points." 
</P>
<P>
Said Piston forward Dennis Rodman, who had 14 points and 14 rebounds: "We 
couldn't take anything for granted when Ewing went out of the game because the 
Knicks had proved they are a scrappy team without him. 
</P>
<P>
"In the second half, we played Pistons basketball, trying not to give them 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Piston Coach Chuck Daly said, "Our job isn't done yet. You've got to get four, 
and it's going to be a hard thing to get. The Knicks are going to come at us 
again so they can bring it back home." 
</P>
<P>
Detroit can wrap up the series in Game 5 at the Palace at Auburn Hills, Mich., 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing and Knick Coach Stu Jackson were upset by the officiating. "All we want, 
all we ask for, is consistency," Jackson said. "We get one offensive foul on 
screens in the first three games, then three offensive fouls on screens in the 
first half today. And we didn't get any the other way. 
</P>
<P>
"It's impossible for me to coach with Patrick playing only six minutes in the 
first half." 
</P>
<P>
Added Ewing: "Every time I came down they would hold me, then I'd fall back and 
they'd call a personal foul. It's got to be called the same on both ends of the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't do anything to warrant that third foul." 
</P>
<P>
Detroitforced the Knicks into missing 16 of their first 21 shots in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons, who were led by James Edwards with 19 points, took the lead for 
good in the second quarter, led by nine at halftime and opened a 59-45 
advantage in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing and Charles Oakley, who finished with 18 points and 14 rebounds, helped 
the Knicks cut the deficit to 65-58 before the Pistons opened their largest 
lead, 78-63, with 9:25 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing then scored 12 points in less than five minutes, helping New York close 
to 87-82 with 3:39 left. But a jumper by Edwards and two free throws by Joe 
Dumars ended the threat.

THIS TIME, THE HEAVENS DO NORMAN A FAVOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
Greg Norman finally found an ally in pursuit of a victory -- the rain. 
</P>
<P>
Norman, who lost two titles this year when opponents made dramatic shots on the 
final hole, was declared the winner of the $1-million Memorial tournament 
Sunday when heavy rains at Dublin, Ohio, washed away the final round. 
</P>
<P>
Norman, stunned by his good fortune, had inherited the third-round lead after 
Fred Couples double-bogeyed No. 18 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had this happen to me before," said Norman, who finished with a 
three-round total of even-par 216. "I really don't know what to say or what to 
feel. Nobody likes to win like this." 
</P>
<P>
But Norman will take it. On March 25, Robert Gamez holed a 176-yard shot for 
eagle-two on No. 18 to beat Norman at Orlando, Fla. On April 29, David Frost 
sank a 50-foot bunker shot for birdie on the final hole to beat Norman by a 
shot at New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Norman, who won $180,000, called the victory "a good break," but added it did 
nothing to ease the sting of those losses. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think about that," Norman said. "There's nothing you can do about 
that. It's passed. It's history. If I thought about it, I'd probably be in a 
funny farm by now." 
</P>
<P>
Payne Stewart finished second at 217 a week after winning the Byron Nelson 
Classic the same way Norman won Sunday -- by rainout. Mark Brooks, Brad Faxon, 
Don Pooley and Couples tied for third at 218. 
</P>
<P>
Norman's victory at Jack Nicklaus' Muirfield Village Golf Club course enabled 
him to join Stewart and Gamez as the only two-time winners on the tour this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Norman didn't know he had won until Stewart offered congratulations. "Give me 
some skin," Stewart said to Norman on the practice range just after the final 
round was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
If it was up to Nicklaus, however, the final round would be played today. But 
because of various considerations, it was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the Tour's policy not to go beyond Monday," said Nicklaus, the 
tournament's founder, host and the course designer. "I think that was their 
decision; it was not our decision." 
</P>
<P>
Dottie Mochrie shot a four-under-par 68 to win a $350,000 women's tournament at 
Chesapeake, Va., by nine shots, the second most-lopsided margin of victory in a 
54-hole LPGA event. 
</P>
<P>
Mochrie, who won $52,000, completed three rounds in 200, 16 under par. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Johnson wound up at 209 after a closing-round 69 and Meg Mallon's 68 left 
her at 210. 
</P>
<P>
Mochrie played the front nine in three-under 33, moving her to 15 under and 
giving her a nine-shot lead over Johnson. No one else was within 10 shots of 
the leader. 
</P>
<P>
The only questions left for Mochrie after she made the turn were whether she 
could match the tour's scoring and margin-of-victory records for 54 holes. 
</P>
<P>
Mochrie needed another three-under 33 on the back nine to equal the scoring 
mark of 198 set by Jan Stephenson in a 1981 tournament. Stephenson set the 
winning-margin record of 11 shots in the same event.

Jimmy Powell, who has struggled most of the year, shot a seven-under-par 65 to 
move past several players and win a $350,000 Senior PGA tournament at Oklahoma 
City by three strokes. 
</P>
<P>
Powell's bogey-free round gave him his first PGA Senior Tour victory in six 
years on the tour -- he also was a non-winner on the regular PGA tour. 
</P>
<P>
The 65 tied the tournament record set by Chi Chi Rodriguez when he won the 1987 
title. 
</P>
<P>
Powell's eight-under 208 total for 54 holes was three better than Mike Hill, 
second-round leader Terry Dill, Jim Dent and Rives McBee. 
</P>
<P>
Powell's best previous finish this year was a ninth-place tie, last week at Las 
Vegas. That also was the first time in nine starts he had even shot a sub-par 
round.

STATUS REMAINS QUO ON WINFIELD; WITT JOINS YANKEES

Dave Winfield's veto of the New York Yankees' attempt to trade him to the 
Angels is "still headed toward arbitration," his agent said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Klein, who represents Winfield, said "not a thing" had occurred in talks 
with Winfield or Angel General Manager Mike Port that would avert having an 
arbitrator rule on whether Winfield's refusal right as a 10-and-five player -- 
a player with 10 years of major league service, five with the same club -- 
supersedes his inclusion of the Angels among the teams to whom he would accept 
a trade. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield refused to report to the Angels after they acquired him on Friday in 
exchange for pitcher Mike Witt. Winfield, a 12-time All-Star, is contending, 
with the backing of the Major League Players Assn., that his rights take 
precedence over the trade-agreement clause. The Player Relations Committee, 
which represents baseball owners, is contending that by continuing to provide a 
list each year, Winfield's 10-and-five rights were overridden. 
</P>
<P>
Don Fehr, executive director of the Players' Assn., said Saturday that 
discussions had begun on scheduling an arbitration hearing, which could be held 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
Klein and Port chatted briefly Sunday. "It was a courtesy kind of 
conversation," Klein said from his home in Westchester, N.Y. "We exchanged 
pleasantries. Everything's the same." 
</P>
<P>
Players may take 72 hours to report to their new clubs after a trade. 
Winfield's grace period expires this evening, as the Angels travel to Milwaukee 
to begin an eight-game, three-city road trip. 
</P>
<P>
Witt reported to the Yankees Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Port is not worried that he has not yet directly spoken to Winfield, who is at 
his New Jersey home. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand where things are with Dave right now, and, given the 
circumstances, I wouldn't do anything different if I were the player involved," 
Port said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't begrudge David his position. That's why we have a court system and 
why baseball has a grievance procedure."

WITT NEVER WELCOMED A HERO'S WELCOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What once was Wally's world and Jim Abbott's stage and Bert Blyleven's 
playhouse could have belonged, so easily, to the man just leaving town. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Witt was more than just another local boy who made good. He was the local 
boy who made perfect. Born in Fullerton and raised in Buena Park, Witt attended 
Servite High in Anaheim, where he went 14-0 his senior season and pitched the 
Friars to the 1978 CIF 4-A championship at Anaheim Stadium, on the same mound 
where he would make his major league debut three years later. 
</P>
<P>
Three years after that, Witt debuted in the record book. He pitched to 27 Texas 
Rangers on the afternoon of Sept. 30, 1984. None reached base. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first perfect game in Angel history and only the 13th perfect game 
in big-league history. Witt was 24 and a 15-game winner for the first time. His 
arrival as a pitcher had been announced. 
</P>
<P>
Old-timers compared him to Don Drysdale. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Autry compared him to Nolan Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Jackson took a look at his curveball, a pitch that was more 
champagne-and-caviar than bread-and-butter, and christened it The Mercedes 
Bends. 
</P>
<P>
Witt could have had it all. Or at least in Anaheim. The keys to the city? Witt 
was the key to the city. He could have been the Angels' Fernando Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
But when Witt looked at Fernando, all he saw was the mania. He saw the media 
throngs, the crush of the fans, the daily hassle, the extra public-relations 
effort that was required. 
</P>
<P>
He wanted none of it. 
</P>
<P>
In May of 1985, Buena Park attempted to honor Witt for his perfect game. The 
mayor and several councilmen arrived at Anaheim Stadium to present Witt with 
two plaques, a scrapbook and various congratulatory letters before an Angel 
home game. 
</P>
<P>
Witt gritted his teeth through the ceremony. "I'm not much for this kind of 
this thing," Witt told reporters that day. "If I had my druthers, we wouldn't 
be doing it at all. . . . This has everything to do with the city of Buena 
Park. I don't think I should be treated differently just because I happen to be 
from around here. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, this will be the last time this happens, so I won't have to go 
around saying stuff like this." 
</P>
<P>
Witt pitched on a small slope of dirt, which always seemed to disappoint him. 
His preference was a vacuum. As a team, the Angels never have been 
writer-friendly, but Witt was contemptuous of the media at an early age. He 
resented the intrusion and the questions he deemed idiotic. Although Witt 
loosened up in later years, his locker was usually the coldest corner in the 
Angel clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
The last home game of the 1986 season, Witt received the Owner's Trophy, given 
annually to the Angels' most valuable player. Witt used the occasion to thumb 
his nose at the media. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I've been waiting five years for this," Witt said. "So you guys can come 
to me and get nothing. . . . I hope you're frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
Witt was shaped and hardened by his first few seasons with the Angels. Touted 
as a can't-miss prospect, he misfired often early on in his career, going 8-9 
in 1981, 8-6 in 1982 and 7-14 in 1983. He drained the patience of his first 
Angel pitching coach, Tom Morgan, whose criticisms were recorded in the daily 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Witt grew to hate newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
He also grew up as a major leaguer in a hostile environment. Breaking in during 
the 1981 season, Witt beat the Angel youth movement by a good three years, 
leaving him isolated on a club dominated by veterans more than 10 years his 
senior. He had no immediate peer group. Out of necessity, he became a loner, 
sealing himself behind a protective wall. 
</P>
<P>
Once, in a reflective mood, Witt told of how he had sat in the clubhouse 
between Bruce Kison and Rod Carew, two of the surliest Angels, and how they'd 
tell the kid to steer clear of this writer and to ignore that one. Witt was 
impressionable then -- and this was his first impression of big-league life. 
</P>
<P>
As the Angel pitching staff began to turn over, with Kirk McCaskill, Chuck 
Finley and Willie Fraser becoming colleagues and contemporaries, Witt finally 
began to enjoy the life. McCaskill, in particular, became a close friend, and 
his gregariousness helped bring out a different side in Witt, one that included 
a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Witt seldom reveals his honest emotions to anyone holding a notepad, so 
we never may know how he truly felt about the most infamous pitching change in 
Angel history -- Gene Mauch's removal of him in Game 5 of the 1986 playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
We suspect Witt feels the same way as the streams of jilted fans who filed out 
of Anaheim Stadium that dreary day: That Witt, buoyed by the adrenaline of the 
moment, would have reared back and struck out Rich Gedman and put the Angels in 
the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
No Gary Lucas, no Donnie Moore, no Dave Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
Witt was never really the same after that game. From 1986 to 1987, he went from 
18-10 and 2.84 to 16-14 and 4.01 -- never to finish another Angel season with 
an earned-run average under four. The demands of that summer -- 269 innings, 14 
complete games -- also took their toll, as evidenced by Witt's dwindling 
victory totals and speed-gun scores ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Witt's last shining moment as an Angel came on April 11, 1990, when he ran 
anchor leg on the Angels' no-hit relay team. A starter no more, Witt finished 
what Mark Langston had begun and once he did, he had to wade through the irony 
to get to his locker stall. 
</P>
<P>
Langston had replaced Witt in the Angels' rotation, and the no-hitter Witt 
saved was the Angels' first since that perfect afternoon in Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I'm a hero for a night," Witt said with typical sarcasm. 
</P>
<P>
He could have held the title so much longer. But a hero's welcome requires a 
hero who welcomes the effort, the reaching out and opening up that 
traditionally comes with the territory. With the Angels, Mike Witt never did.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
GRIFFEY TAKES CHARGE AND LEADS THE MARINERS OVER YANKEES, 10-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Seattle Mariners made Ken Griffey Jr. the No. 1 draft pick as a 
17-year-old schoolboy in 1987, they were certain that someday he would be the 
player to build the franchise around. 
</P>
<P>
Still, hardly anyone was prepared for Griffey to become a franchise player at 
20. 
</P>
<P>
But that's just what the Mariner center fielder is becoming. Griffey had three 
hits, including his seventh home run, Sunday at Seattle to lead the Mariners 
past the New York Yankees, 10-5. 
</P>
<P>
Griffey, in only his second major league season, is hitting .370 to lead the 
league. He has also scored 23 runs and driven in 22. Due in part to his 
contributions, the Mariners no longer are the worst team in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe he's not quite in the company of superstars such as Willie Mays or Henry 
Aaron, yet," Seattle General Manager Woody Woodward said. "But he has the 
potential to be that kind of player. 
</P>
<P>
"As young as he is, I think you can put him in the category with Jose Canseco, 
Will Clark and Kevin Mitchell right now. Yes, you could definitely say that." 
</P>
<P>
Griffey, who was born in Donora, Pa., the birthplace of Stan Musial, still has 
things to learn. For instance, while he makes some great catches in center, he 
also makes mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"But, he's such a bright kid," Manager Jim Lefebvre said, "that he learns from 
his mistakes. Making the adjustments takes more than raw talent alone. He's 
aware of what's going on all the time." 
</P>
<P>
After two seasons in the minors, Griffey, joined the Mariners last season. 
Obviously, he was ready. He played 127 games, batted .264, hit 16 home runs and 
drove in 61 runs. 
</P>
<P>
Alvin Davis and Brian Giles also hit home runs for the Mariners (15-18), 
enabling Matt Young to win as a starter for the first time in more than four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Although he gave up four runs and eight hits in five innings, Young, who has 
been a reliever the last three seasons, improved to 1-3. Young, traded to the 
Dodgers in 1987, couldn't even win at Oakland last season. The Mariners signed 
him as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
Giles was zero for 17 and had not batted since April 17. He hit his first home 
run since June 9, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 4, Kansas City 3 -- Beleaguered Royals' Manager John Wathan decided to 
take the pressure off his high-priced bullpen stopper, Mark Davis, by making 
Jeff Montgomery the closer. Davis has failed to hold leads four times. 
</P>
<P>
With the Royals leading, 3-2, going in the eighth at Chicago, Wathan brought in 
Montgomery. He wasn't the answer. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth, Lance Johnson singled, stole second and scored Dan Pasqua's 
single to tie it. 
</P>
<P>
An error by center fielder Bo Jackson on Scott Fletcher's double with one out 
in the ninth set the stage for Johnson. With Fletcher on third, two intentional 
walks loaded the bases. Johnson scored Fletcher with a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
"One of these days," Wathan said after his Royals fell to 10-20, "I hope to 
wake up and find this was all a bad dream." 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 4, Oakland 1 -- Catcher Mickey Tettleton broke a zero-for-21 slump 
with a run-scoring double at Oakland, but his defensive play in the eighth 
inning was even bigger. 
</P>
<P>
With the Orioles leading, 3-1, there were two on, nobody out and Jose Canseco 
at bat. The Athletics put on the double steal and Tettleton threw out Carney 
Lansford at second. On the replays, Lansford appeared to slide in ahead of 
second baseman Billy Ripken's tag. 
</P>
<P>
Tettleton ignored the front man, Rickey Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't surprised," Tettleton said. "That's Tony's (Oakland Manager Tony La 
Russa) style. They're both proven base stealers. Our bench made the call to go 
for Lansford." 
</P>
<P>
The Athletics failed to score and Jay Tibbs and four relievers combined on a 
five-hitter to give the Orioles two in a row on the road for the first time 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Athletics' lead in the West is just 3 1/2 over surging Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 8, Milwaukee 6 -- Former UCLA star Shane Mack, a member of the 1984 
U.S. Olympic team, has been trying to make it in the majors for five years. 
</P>
<P>
The Twins drafted Mack in December from San Diego, where he did not play last 
season after June 16 because of elbow surgery. 
</P>
<P>
He may finally have made it with the Twins. Mack, batting .382, singled in two 
runs and scored another at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never worried about (making the club)," Mack said. "I was concerned about 
missing almost an entire year and coming back to do well. I'm just 
concentrating on my job -- see the ball, hit it hard and play good defense." 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 6, Detroit 3 -- George Bell homered, doubled and scored the 
tie-breaking run in the eighth inning at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
The 12th error of the season by third baseman Tony Phillips set up two unearned 
runs in the eighth that put the Blue Jays ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Former Blue Jay Lloyd Moseby hit his fourth homer for the Tigers, but Detroit's 
Cecil Fielder, the major leagues' top home run hitter with 13, was zero for 
three. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 4, Texas 1 -- John Farrell held the Rangers to five hits in eight 
innings at Arlington, Tex., improving to 4-0 against Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Browne opened the game for the Indians with his first home run of the 
season and also drove in the final run with a sacrifice fly. 
</P>

At least 65 people, including 24 police officers, were injured when police used 
batons and tear gas to break up violent clashes inspired by national hatred 
between Serb and Croat fans in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, before a major soccer league 
match. 
</P>
<P>
The fighting, described as the worst rioting in the history of Yugoslav sports, 
started at the Maksimir stadium before the match between the local Dinamo club 
and Belgrade's Red Star. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses and the state Tanjug news agency said the riots later spilled outside 
the stadium. Thousands of fans attacked and smashed police cars and erected 
barricades, blocking traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The official delegate at the match, Ljubomir Bracanovic, said in a television 
interview the disturbances started when Red Star fans from the Yugoslav 
republic of Serbia started wrecking plastic seats on the stands. 
</P>
<P>
The rival Croat Dinamo supporters, known as "The Bad Blue Boys," reacted by 
crashing through metal fences separating them from the pitch and charging in 
the direction of Belgrade fans on the opposite side of the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The match was called off following the unrest that erupted about 10 minutes 
before the game was scheduled to start.

<P>
Hall of Fame trainer Woody Stephens was taken off a respirator Sunday, and his 
condition was upgraded from critical to serious just two days after he 
underwent quadruple heart-bypass surgery, officials in Louisville, Ky., said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's still in the intensive care unit, but the doctor did say he was 
improving," said Pam Greer-Ullrich, a spokeswoman at Norton Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Stephens, 76, has been hospitalized for more than two weeks because of a 
recurrence of chronic breathing problems. He underwent the heart-bypass surgery

SAN MARINO EVENT GOES TO PATRESE

IMOLA, Italy

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was a little more emotion than usual in the voice of Italy's Riccardo 
Patrese. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great day, one of the happiest in my life," Patrese said after winning 
the San Marino Grand Prix on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I won on the right track. I'm overjoyed and I can hardly express what I feel 
inside me." 
</P>
<P>
It was the third Grand Prix victory in Patrese's 14-year Formula One career and 
his most gratifying. It came eight years after his last victory, in South 
Africa, and rewarded him for several disappointing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Patrese, 36, who drove a Williams-Renault, broke into tears as he walked to the 
awards ceremony to the cheers of the crowd of about 150,000. 
</P>
<P>
He completed the 191.03-mile race in 1 hour 30 minutes 55.478 seconds at an 
average speed of 125.783 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Patrese, one of the oldest Formula One active drivers along with Brazilian 
Nelson Piquet and Japanese Satoru Nakajima, beat Austria's Gerhard Berger and 
Italy's Alessandro Nannini at the finish, with four drivers alternating in the 
lead during the 61 laps. 
</P>
<P>
Patrese began in fourth place, fought back to second by the 39th lap and 
overtook Berger for the lead in the 51st lap. 
</P>
<P>
"It happened before the Mineral Waters bend, where I spun off in 1983, missing 
a sure victory," Patrese recalled. "I was afraid that history would repeat 
itself. I was afraid through the very last bend." 
</P>
<P>
Reigning world champion Alain Prost of France was fourth in a Ferrari. The 
other Ferrari driver, Britain's Nigel Mansell, was stopped by car problems 
shortly after an aborted challenge to Berger. 
</P>
<P>
Berger, who trailed Patrese by 5.11 seconds at the finish line in a 
McLaren-Honda, said: "He was quicker in the final laps. I did not make any 
mistake."

PREJUDICE AND HARDSHIP BURIED THE WORKS OF EARLY BLACK AUTHORS FOR YEARS. BUT 
NOW, RESEARCHERS ARE REDISCOVERING THE BOOKS AND THE TRUTHS THEY TOLD.

<P>
Like marathoners forced to wear weighted shoes, black American novelists during 
slavery and for decades after faced seemingly impossible odds on the road to 
publication. 
</P>
<P>
As slaves, black people were forbidden by law to read and write. Some slave 
writers not only had to escape their masters but flee the country as well. Even 
those who were befriended by sympathetic white Americans often had to tone down 
their views of racism in order to get published. And long after slavery ended, 
many black novelists could find no publishers other than themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Still, they wrote. The early novels by blacks were steeped in realism born out 
of their enslavement, and, later, by the tyranny of low-level jobs, lynchings, 
segregation and discrimination. But through the years, these windows into the 
soul of black America remained largely closed, relegated to literary 
backwaters. 
</P>
<P>
Now, university researchers increasingly are sifting through these novels and 
in the process have uncovered a trove of revelations about black life in 
America and race relations over the years. The search also makes an important 
link between the early black writers and those who came later. 
</P>
<P>
Here on the elegant, tree-shaded campus of the University of Mississippi, where 
much of the racial history is steeped in anger and hate, a project is unfolding 
with the goal of cataloguing and collecting a copy of every novel published by 
a black American author since the first one in 1853, William Wells Brown's 
"Clotel." In all, some 2,000 titles will form the collection. 
</P>
<P>
The effort, a daunting one, is similar to those at other universities, where 
collections are under way for periodical literature and for fiction covering 
shorter periods of time. In addition, collectors at private organizations 
increasingly are seeking out books written by blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say the collections parallel a growing dissatisfaction with educators' 
lists of "great literature," which often exclude books written by blacks and 
other minorities and those by women. 
</P>
<P>
For black people the efforts bear particular significance. They carry the hopes 
of building black pride in literature, combatting white prejudice in publishing 
and chipping away at the huge rock of illiteracy -- a problem exacerbated by 
dropout rates that hover around 50% in some predominantly black schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe they (black students) didn't want to read 'Silas Marner,' but they would 
want to read 'Clotel,' said Casper Jordan, an adjunct professor at Clark 
Atlanta University's school of library and information studies. 
</P>
<P>
The collectors say their discoveries of early black novels will help tear down 
the stereotype that black people historically have had only an "oral tradition" 
of story-telling, not a written one. And the stories, they say, often provide 
insightful looks into ordinary black life, broadening everyone's understanding 
of the black experience in America and inspiring black people as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Black people have a history in this discipline, and we want to know what it 
is," said Maryemma Graham, the director of the Ole Miss project who currently 
teaches English and African-American literature at Northeastern University in 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
So far, said Graham, her project has collected 1,500 of the known 2,000 novels 
by blacks, including 60 written before 1940. Graham, likening the search to 
following "a detective's trail" through attics, basements, churches, libraries 
and minds, said the novels are collected and catalogued here in many forms, 
including photocopies, hard copies and microfilm. 
</P>
<P>
There are always new trails for book detectives to explore. As an example, the 
first novel by a black American woman (and the first by a black published in 
this country) was published in 1859 but was lost for years until researchers 
from Yale University drew attention to it in 1982 -- "Our Nig or, Sketches from 
the Life of a Free Black" by Harriet E. Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Parts of her life paralleled the travails of the book's heroine, Frado, an 
indentured servant to a brutal white family in 19th-Century Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
Why did this work remain obscure for so long? 
</P>
<P>
Henry Louis Gates Jr., now a Duke University professor who, while at Yale, led 
the rediscovery team, speculated that one possibility was that Wilson 
confronted Northern racism, thus alienating Northerners. 
</P>
<P>
Gates, in his introduction to a Random House reprinting of the book, also cited 
as a possibility the book's "unabashed representation of an interracial 
marriage, a liaison from which the novel's protagonist was an offspring." He 
went on to say that interracial marriage "was not a popular subject for 
representation in either anti-slavery or pro-slavery novels." Through the 
years, many novels by blacks were published in limited quantities, often by 
"vanity presses," sometimes circulated only among friends and church members. 
And say scholars, many black writers were exploited, much in the same way as 
black musicians who were cheated out of profits by record companies. 
</P>
<P>
Here, at the project's command center, Barbara Hunt, project co-director, 
leaned over an open file drawer, thumbing through book copies, noting that many 
of the early books centered on the devastating conditions during slavery. Such 
literature, she said, "doesn't show too much in the way of optimism," 
dispelling the notion of benign slavery. 
</P>
<P>
First among these is "Clotel," subtitled "The President's Daughter" because it 
represents the persistent assertion that Thomas Jefferson fathered children by 
a black woman. Brown, an escaped slave who made his way from Kentucky to 
Cleveland, then Buffalo, N.Y., where his house was an Underground Railroad 
station, wrote the book in the British Isles, and it was published in London. 
At the time he could not return to America, lest he risk re-enslavement. 
</P>
<P>
In the genre of the "tragic mulatto," as is "Our Nig," the novel details the 
sad, hard life of Clotel, born of a slave master and a slave, and in the 
process, provides graphic details of slave life. 
</P>
<P>
At an auction where Clotel's mother is sold, Brown notes that among the 
bidders, the "laughing, joking, swearing, smoking, spitting and talking kept up 
a continual hum," while a "slave girl stood with tearful eyes, looking 
alternately at her mother and sister and toward the young man whom she hoped 
would become her purchaser." 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who himself was as fair-skinned as a white man, portrayed the conflicts 
between light-skinned blacks and darker ones, having one slave character say of 
another: "She tink she white when she cum here, wid dat long har ob hers." 
</P>
<P>
Connecting the evils of slavery and the sexual fears of white women, Brown 
wrote: "What social virtues are possible in a society of which injustice is a 
primary characteristic -- in a society which is divided into two classes, 
masters and slaves? Every married woman at the South looks upon her husband as 
unfaithful, and regards every Negro woman as a rival." 
</P>
<P>
Researchers note that many students are familiar with the works of later black 
authors like Toni Morrison, Richard Wright, Alice Walker and James Baldwin. But 
they are almost certain to know very little about Brown and other earlier 
authors, or about the depth of black talent, and despair, represented in their 
works. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Mayme Clayton, executive director of the Western States Black 
Research Center, recalled that years ago many blacks did not have access to 
black books, even in school, because many schools refused to buy them. Clayton 
said she began collecting books by blacks at age 13 and loves the old ones 
because "you will not know where you're going unless you know where you've 
been." 
</P>
<P>
The books, she said, prove that "black people were not as ignorant as white 
people made people believe." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, even as a child, Frances E.W. Harper was acclaimed for her literary 
skills and developed an international reputation as a poet, lecturer and 
abolitionist. Her novel, "Iola Leroy," published in 1892, was one of the early 
post-Reconstruction literary efforts to combat contemporary white fiction 
depicting a romantic South where all slaves were happy and the slaveholders 
kind. 
</P>
<P>
In "Iola Leroy," Robert Johnson, a former slave who, during the Civil War, 
rises to the rank of lieutenant in a black regiment, responds to a white 
captain's statement about "ungrateful" blacks. Writes Harper: ' "Captain,' said 
Robert, with a tone of bitterness in his voice, 'what had we to be grateful 
for? For ages of poverty, ignorance, and slavery? I think if anybody should be 
grateful, it is the people who have enslaved us and lived off our labor for 
generations. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
In addition, several scholars noted that the collection of little known black 
authors will show the range of writing styles and subject matter that always 
have existed among black novelists. 
</P>
<P>
Many white people "don't believe black writers can write about universal themes 
-- like beauty and truth," said Jordan, the Clark Atlanta University professor. 
But many of the neglected novels undermine that prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Zora Neal Hurston's "Their Eyes Were Watching God," published in 
1937, explores the rich fabric of everyday life among rural black people and 
uses equally rich language to do it. Of sundown she writes: "The sun was gone, 
but he had left his footprints in the sky." A well-proportioned woman looks 
"like she had grapefruits in her hip pockets," and a good cook "switches a mean 
fanny round in a kitchen" and during a riveting moment, "nobody moved, nobody 
spoke, nobody even thought to swallow spit. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Walters, a professor of political science at Howard University who is 
active in efforts to break down barriers to publication of black writers, said: 
"Black people have always had a world view that was expressed in their 
writings," but whites "accepted the things they thought were flattering and 
rejected those things they thought were threatening." Thus, he said, they were 
"able to maintain stereotypes" of blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Laurence Dunbar, a turn-of-the-century black poet and author, complained 
bitterly of being forced to write in black dialect because publishers demanded 
it. After writing three novels with white characters in white settings in an 
attempt to become a mainstream writer, Dunbar's final novel -- "The Sport of 
the Gods," published in 1902 -- portrayed a black family that moves north, only 
to find it unbearable. Despair and disillusion pervade the book. A short 
exchange in it between a black man called Sadness and a white reporter named 
Skaggsy demonstrates Dunbar's feeling about having to write dialect. 
</P>
<P>
Skaggsy: "I tell you, Sadness . . . dancing is the poetry of motion." 
</P>
<P>
Sadness: "Yes . . . and dancing in rag-time is the dialect poetry." 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Bogardus, professor of American studies at the University of Alabama, is 
organizing a summer institute to teach Alabama teachers more about black 
literature. When whites read black books, he said, they "share feelings and 
thoughts with" black people, thus "broadening their experience." 
</P>
<P>
Researchers who uncover little known black books envision using them in classes 
not only to educate white people about the achievements and experiences of 
black writers but also to instill pride and interest among black people. 
</P>
<P>
At Santa Monica College, Gail Davis Culp, who teaches African-American 
literature, said that she has seen a dramatic surge in interest in black 
heritage among black students who have read "Clotel." 
</P>
<P>
She said the book has inspired discussions of "the psychological implications 
of being a mulatto," and that students have taken on roles of the book's 
characters and made videotapes of scenes. "For the first time they're 
recognizing that they do have a (literary) history and that that history 
started long before Richard Wright." 
</P>
<P>
Wright's first book, "Uncle Tom's Children: Four Novellas," was published in 
1938. "Native Son," Wright's best known work -- in which Bigger Thomas 
personifies black rage, declaring: "I killed for what I am" -- was published 
two years later. 
</P>
<P>
While many of the novels freeze history in place, others surprise with their 
timelessness. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in "The Marrow of Tradition," published in 1901, Charles W. 
Chesnutt, could have been voicing the frustration of black people today when he 
wrote a passage in which one black man was arrested on suspicion of murder and 
another, who felt the accusing stares of white people, complained that "the 
entire race is condemned on general principles." And Dunbar's "Sport of the 
Gods" shows that current-day black people are not the first to find 
disillusionment in the North. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the increasing effort to collect and publicize black novels, there is 
likely to be an increased debate over whether they are "good literature." 
</P>
<P>
Ernst Benjamin, general secretary of the American Assn. of University 
Professors, said that in the nation's 3,500 colleges and universities "some 
would say there is a list of the great books, (but) others say there are 
reasons to teach different books." 
</P>
<P>
Different, great, historical, Graham wants them all if they are black. The time 
is right, she said, likening her desire to spread black literature to the 
freedom movement in Eastern Europe. "People are crying for more democracy, more 
representation," she said. "There is a role in our society for these texts." 
</P>

EXCERPTS FROM BOOKS BY BLACK AUTHORS 
</P>
<P>
"CLOTEL," by William Wells Brown, published 1853: 
</P>
<P>
This was a Virginia slave-auction, at which the bones, sinews, blood, and 
nerves of a young girl of eighteen were sold for $500; her moral character for 
$200; her superior intellect for $100; the benefits supposed to accrue from her 
having been sprinkled and immersed, together with a warranty of her devoted 
Christianity, for $300; her ability to make a good prayer for $200; and her 
chastity for $700 more. This, too, in a city thronged with churches, whose tall 
spires look like so many signals pointing to heaven, but whose ministers preach 
that slavery is a God-ordained institution! 
</P>
<P>
"OUR NIG or, SKETCHES FROM THE LIFE OF A FREE BLACK," by Harriet E. Wilson, 
published 1859: 
</P>
<P>
"If I do, I get whipped;" sobbed the child. "They won't believe what I say. Oh, 
I wish I had my mother back; then I should not be kicked and whipped so. Who 
made me so?" 
</P>
<P>
"God;" answered James. 
</P>
<P>
"Did God make you?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes." 
</P>
<P>
"Who made Aunt Abby?" 
</P>
<P>
"God." 
</P>
<P>
"Did the same God that made her make me?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, then I don't like him." 
</P>
<P>
"Why not?" 
</P>
<P>
"Because he made her white, and me black. Why didn't he make us both white?" 
</P>
<P>
"IOLA LEROY," by Frances E. W. Harper, published 1892: 
</P>
<P>
Miss Leroy, out of the race must come its own thinkers and writers. Authors 
belonging to the white race have written good racial books, for which I am 
deeply grateful, but it seems to be almost impossible for a white man to put 
himself completely in our place. No man can feel the iron which enters another 
man's soul. 
</P>
<P>
"THE SPORT OF THE GODS," By Paul Laurence Dunbar, published 1902: 
</P>
<P>
The subtle, insidious wine of New York will begin to intoxicate him. Then, if 
he be wise, he will go away, any place -- yes, he will even go over to Jersey. 
But if he be a fool, he will stay and stay on until the town becomes all in all 
to him; until the very streets are his chums and certain buildings and corners 
his best friends. Then he is hopeless, and to live elsewhere would be death. 
The Bowery will be his romance, Broadway his lyric, and the Park his pastoral, 
the river and the glory of it all his epic, and he will look down pityingly on 
all the rest of humanity. 
</P>
<P>
"THEIR EYES WERE WATCHING GOD," by Zora Neale Hurston, published 1937: 
</P>
<P>
The spirit of the marriage left the bedroom and took to living in the parlor. 
It was there to shake hands whenever company came to visit, but it never went 
back inside the bedroom again. So she put something in there to represent the 
spirit like a Virgin Mary image in a church. The bed was no longer a 
daisy-field for her and Joe to play in. It was a place where she went and laid 
down when she was sleepy and tired.

10 YEARS LATER, MT. ST. HELENS' MARK INDELIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MT. ST. HELENS, Wash. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People remember exactly what they were doing 10 years ago this May 18: getting 
ready for church, taking care of chores, sipping cups of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the bright morning sky, what looked like a huge thunder cloud 
appeared. A volcanic eruption had lowered the summit of Mt. St. Helens by 1,312 
feet. Within 10 minutes, an avalanche of volcanic debris plummeted 14 miles 
down a river valley. Eerily, people in nearby towns heard nothing, while the 
sound bounced off the atmosphere and was heard hundreds of miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Generations of campers had used Spirit Lake, a cold, clear body of water 
surrounded by a majestic forest. The blast emptied the lake and threw it 
against nearby ridges, while a 1,100-degree pumice poured from the Mt. St. 
Helens shattered north flank into the basin. The lake was sterilized. 
</P>
<P>
The heat and force traveled at speeds of up to 670 miles an hour, killing 57 
people, and untold numbers of deer, elk, bear and fish and birds. Trees were 
knocked down or burned to death in a 200-square-mile area. 
</P>
<P>
For several winters after, fears lingered that debris-clogged rivers would 
flood cities downstream. Given the awesome forces at work, geologists wondered 
whether the towns of Longview, Kelso and Castle Rock, home to more than 50,000 
people, were worth saving. At the same time, the worst recession in 50 years 
hit the region. 
</P>
<P>
"One test of character is how you react to pressure, and, boy, did we have 
pressure," said Ted Natt, editor and publisher of the Longview Daily News. In 
the end, he said, all the adversity "proved to this community that it had the 
toughness, the character to come through a major natural disaster and survive." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the economy is recovering, the volcano has been quiet since October, 
1986, forests are regenerating at a rate that has surprised scientists and a 
large herd of elk has migrated into the blast area. 
</P>
<P>
"You actually forget that it's there, that it's an active volcano," said Karen 
Kruse, among the Toutle River Valley residents who were evacuated 10 years ago. 
Last fall, for the first time since the eruption, Kruse went to an area that 
had been devastated and picked blackberries for her family's annual supply of 
pie. 
</P>
<P>
But even as land and lives mend, the volcano has changed this corner of 
Southwestern Washington forever. 
</P>
<P>
Like a meticulous back yard gardener, Charlie Crisafulli steadied the stakes 
that protect hisplot. The plants are scruffy and the patch small, 11-by-13 
yards. But to the 32-year-old U.S. Forest Service ecologist, the garden of 
lupine, fireweed and dandelion is "the foundation of a forest." 
</P>
<P>
He calls it East Lupine Plot in honor of the first plant, a prairie lupine, 
seen growing at the foot of Mt. St. Helens. While young forests cover much of 
the outlying land scorched 10 years ago, East Lupine Plot is one of the few 
signs of life in a place known as the Pumice Plain. 
</P>
<P>
A brown-gray expanse, the Pumice Plain was so devastated by the volcano's fury 
that nothing survived. Wind whips down it without obstacle, swirling ash and 
dust. Creeks appear suddenly, carve deep gullies, then shift channels. Cooked 
boulders tossed out by Mt. St. Helens weather into hues of orange and purple. 
</P>
<P>
In this harsh environment, Crisafulli's garden grows, slowly, ever so 
precariously. Growing flush to the ground, the lupine, spotted in June, 1982, 
trapped other seeds, enriched the soil, and was food to insects. 
</P>
<P>
Crisafulli has catalogued each minute change for eight seasons. Now, he counts 
27 species of plants, 160,000 plants in all, plus aphids, beetles and spiders. 
</P>
<P>
"I have so much of my life tied up in it," Crisafulli said. "But it goes beyond 
that. It is science. The information generated from these sites is priceless." 
</P>
<P>
Crisafulli believes that each time a Cascade Range volcano has erupted, islands 
of life like East Lupine Plot have taken hold and, over decades, evolved into 
forests. 
</P>
<P>
Not far away, Mt. St. Helens' crater steams, as springs bubble forth at near 
boiling temperatures. The springs feed a creek that flows into Spirit Lake. 
Along the creek, shrub-like willows grow. In time, the willows may colonize 
East Lupine Plot. Alder and fir trees will follow. In 50 years, perhaps, Pumice 
Plain will support a young forest. 
</P>
<P>
These days, gawkers rarely come to see the destruction in the Toutle River 
Valley. There's not much to see anyway. Alder and willow obscure the remnants 
of riverfront houses and washed out bridges. 
</P>
<P>
"A stranger looks and has no idea what was there," said George Basie, a 
longshoreman who lives above the Toutle River. Before the mountain blew, he 
could look across a pasture to acres of fir trees. The flood destroyed the 
forest and washed the homes of nine neighbors into the river. 
</P>
<P>
One neighbor was Ted Conradi. For 40 years, Conradi and his wife, Anabel, lived 
on 170 acres of tall fir trees and planned to will it to the state for a park. 
</P>
<P>
The Conradis left on the day the mountain blew. They returned a few days later 
to a moonscape. The next day Anabel had a stroke and never recovered. They 
moved, never to return. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, Conradi goes back to his abandoned home. Holly trees in the front 
yard grow wild. The porch steps are rotted. Derelict cars and trucks rust in 
the yard. 
</P>
<P>
"I have halfway made my peace with the mountain," said Conradi, 79. But he 
prefers to stay in Kelso. "I've accepted something that happened, the loss of 
something that can't be replaced." 
</P>
<P>
Ann and Sam Hornstra still find their loss hard to take. "We don't need a 
reminder," Ann Hornstra said, not at all nostalgic about the 10-year 
anniversary. "We work in it every day." 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, the Hornstras sold a dairy in Orange County and moved to 110 acres on 
the Cowlitz River. It was a perfect place to retire. They ran a few head of 
cattle and tended a grove of filbert and walnut trees. 
</P>
<P>
Then, 30 miles away, Mt. St. Helens blew. Slurry-like floodwaters dumped part 
of a mobile home on their pasture, along with logs, animals and enough 
appliances to furnish two homes. The couple is still clearing the debris. 
</P>
<P>
"Our orchard used to be right there," Sam Hornstra said, pointing to a spot 
covered with grass. "It used to be good soil, beautiful soil." 
</P>
<P>
The mud dried like cement, 35 feet deep in places. Cottonwood trees washed in 
by the flood sprout haphazardly. Ann Hornstra raked much of the pasture by 
hand. But some soil is beyond help. 
</P>
<P>
The farm retains beauty. A lush apple tree blooms outside their kitchen window. 
Cattle graze in the pasture. But the Hornstras remember the place as it was, 
and recently put it up for sale. "If we knew then what we know now," Ann 
Hornstra said, "we would have walked away." 
</P>
<P>
Van Youngquist entered politics intent on spending only one four-year term as a 
Cowlitz County commissioner, then returning to his dairy on the Columbia River. 
Halfway through his term, the mountain erupted. He has been working on 
volcano-related problems ever since and gave up the dairy. 
</P>
<P>
His biggest worry had been that a natural dam holding back Spirit Lake would 
break, flooding the Toutle and Cowlitz rivers and towns below. But the Corps of 
Engineers dredged river channels, built a spillway to lower the lake, and last 
year completed a dam on the Toutle to hold back sediment. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Youngquist fears that another natural dam holding back Castle Lake could 
fail, flooding parts of the towns of Castle Rock and Kelso. Although the lake 
is much smaller than Spirit Lake, Youngquist said: "I don't trust it one bit." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a Federal Emergency Management Agency consultant reported seeing 
considerable erosion on the Castle Lake dam, and warned that "the system itself 
is so fraught with potential for danger as to render it unsafe in the general 
sense." Another study is under way. 
</P>
<P>
Youngquist knows that volcano-related problems persist a decade later. But "the 
average Joe Blow doesn't know or care about Castle Lake. He has been here for 
10 years and has never gotten his feet wet." 
</P>
<P>
Blair Barner was three days away from finishing his new home, an A-frame, a 
short stroll fromthe North Fork of the Toutle River. After a lifetime of 
fishing on the river, he could catch his limit of steelhead on any day. Then 
the eruption spawned the flood on the Toutle, leaving his home waist deep in 
mud. 
</P>
<P>
Fishermen used to pull 3,000 steelhead from Barner's river each winter. 
Although runs on some rivers in the area are better than before the eruption, a 
paltry 30 steelhead appeared at a dam upstream from Barner's A-frame this 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
Barner and a partner try to make something good from the misfortune. They put a 
hulking statue of Big Foot next to the A-frame and opened a gift shop. But 
Barner never could bring himself to charge admission to his dream house.

"People think its a real good business," Barner said. "But in the wintertime, 
you might see five cars in a day." 
</P>
<P>
Officials believe tourism will take off. Youngquist points to estimates that 2 
million visitors will come by 1993 after a road is finished that will take 
people from Interstate 5 to within 4 miles from the crater. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Forest Service manages a 110,000-acre national volcanic monument 
established by Congress like a national park. The Forest Service already has 
put in an extensive system of trails that soon will lead to the Pumice Plain. 
</P>
<P>
A series of events, including a symposium, festivals and a memorial, will mark 
the 10th anniversary weekend. To commemorate the dead, the Forest Service will 
put up a plaque at its visitors' center this summer. A spokesman said there 
will be no elaborate ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurt us. It took 10 years of logging away from us," said Bill Welch, 49, 
who drives a log truck for Weyerhaeuser Co., the area's largest employer. 
</P>
<P>
While Weyerhaeuser had 4,800 workers in the area in 1980, the company has about 
2,800 employees now. Much of the job loss was due to automation and a bad 
economy. But the volcano scorched 68,000 acres of Weyerhaeuser land, and 
"hastened" the closure of mills that cut old-growth trees, said John E. 
Keatley, Weyerhaeuser's land and timber manager in the affected area. 
</P>
<P>
Weyerhaeuser planted 18 million trees on 45,000 acres in the largest 
reforestation effort ever in this country and found that the trees are growing 
exceptionally fast. 
</P>
<P>
"We were surprised by the resiliency of these plants and animals," Keatley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the regeneration, Keatley said, Weyerhaeuser finds support for its 
contention that clear-cutting does no lasting damage to the forests. Like other 
timber companies, Weyerhaeuser continues to clear-cut, then burn what remains 
before growing new "crops" of trees. 
</P>
<P>
But Peter Frenzen, U.S. Forest Service's chief scientist at the monument, 
observed regeneration on Forest Service land and became an adherent of a new 
theory on logging. To revive coniferous forests, it is important to leave some 
dead logs and not disturb the general "disorder in nature." 
</P>
<P>
Frenzen stood amid dead fir trees in a stand left to regenerate on its own. He 
explained how rodents called voles use downed logs for protection and tunnels. 
Voles gather and spread spores from mushrooms that, in turn, help fir trees 
grow. The animals also are a main source of food for spotted owls. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to regenerate more than just trees," Frenzen said, proud of his 
own crop of fast-growing plants and animals on the south side of Mt. St. 
Helens. "We are trying to regenerate entire ecosystems." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Wolfe, the U.S. Geological Survey scientist in charge of the Cascades 
Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Wash., takes a long view about Mt. St. 
Helens. Over the last 12,000 years, Cascade volcanoes from Washington to 
California have erupted at a rate of two per century. 
</P>
<P>
"That will very likely continue," Wolfe said. 
</P>
<P>
Geologists believe Mt. St. Helens is returning to dormancy. But it still could 
erupt, ending the recovery of the last 10 years. "We can't become complacent," 
Wolfe said. 
</P>
<P>
In geological terms, Mt. St. Helens' eruption was "modest." Because of their 
size, eruptions on Mt. Hood, outside Portland, Ore., or Mt. Ranier, outside the 
Seattle area, would pose far greater problems. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, someone reported a new source of steam on Mt. Hood. It was, in all 
likelihood, nothing. "Before, no one would have paid any attention to it," U.S. 
Geological Survey scientist Don Swanson said. "Now, someone will go out and 
look."

John K. Van de Kamp dished it out and Dianne Feinstein hurled it back Sunday 
night as the two Democratic candidates for governor faced each other in a 
rambunctious, high-stakes debate about their differences and the destiny of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Never before have two candidates for governor of the same party debated on 
statewide television just before a primary election -- and they went all out 
for the trust of voters in a political party that is steadily losing ground. 
</P>
<P>
In a word -- their word -- the Democratic primary now 23 days away is a contest 
of change, and which candidate can bring it about. The encounter also brought 
some sharp charges over taxes, ethics -- and a cheerful "Happy Mother's Day" 
from both. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp hit hardest when he said that Feinstein's reluctance to address 
taxes directly and her willingness to cut social spending for the needy made 
her sound more like a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
"She's sounding like Gov. Deukmejian; this is a Democratic primary," Atty. Gen. 
Van de Kamp said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't change California, Dianne, by going along with the status quo, 
getting along with the status quo, getting endorsed by the status quo. . . . 
Take a stand," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For Feinstein, just being a woman -- the first ever to seriously vie for her 
party's nomination -- was visible evidence of change. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this state needs some caring. I think it's not hurt by a little bit of 
mothering," the former San Francisco mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to do things just as they've always been done, take the insider 
candidate," shesaid, gesturing to Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein, who is by reputation more telegenic, did not appear to run away with 
the debate as some of her supporters wanted, although she certainly held her 
own. Van de Kamp, a practiced lawyer, appeared well coached and repeatedly 
found a way to end his statements with a barbed question about Feinstein -- a 
question she could not answer right away because it was not her turn. 
</P>
<P>
Ethics in government and ethics in politics were points of sharp disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein said it would be a "breach of privacy" for her to reveal the private 
clients of her multimillionaire investment banker husband, Richard C. Blum. She 
noted, however, that Blum already has disclosed 76% of his business interests. 
She said that if elected she would subject herself to stringent 
conflict-of-interest standards. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband's income has loomed as an issue because Blum has loaned the 
Feinstein campaign half of its total budget so far. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're entitled to know who's behind Mayor Feinstein," Van de Kamp 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"And by the way, why no taxes in 1985?" he said tauntingly. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein waited her turn to answer and then said the lack of federal income 
taxes that year could be explained because she and her husband took a tax loss 
on an investment in ice cream parlors. 
</P>
<P>
"You've been very sanctimonious, John," said Feinstein, an edge to her voice. 
She accused Van de Kamp of trying to prevent revealing his family trust, 
charging that when it was revealed, there were 14 companies listed that did 
business with South Africa. "So if I were you, I wouldn't be quite so 
sanctimonious," she said. 
</P>
<P>
California's multibillion-dollar budget shortfall and taxes loomed early and 
important in the debate. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp was specific in suggesting higher taxes on people earning $100,000 
or more. "We have to be willing to look at revenues," he said. Van de Kamp said 
the tax cuts of the 1980s have to be revaluated for these high-income earners 
"and put them at the rate they had before." 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general said it was "wrong" to consider cutbacks for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein seemed to disagree. Asked specifically about cutting programs for the 
aged, blind and disabled, she said whe would call legislative leaders together 
"and put everything on the table . . . and try to negotiate a package." 
</P>
<P>
About taxes, Feinstein was asked about Gov. George Deukmejian's pledge to 
resist new taxes. "I don't think that's necessarily right," she said. But she 
did not get more specific. In fact, she said that if current budget estimates 
are accurate, she would be faced with having to cut $1.3 billion next year. 
</P>
<P>
Several early questions were devoted to the touchy subject of race relations, a 
subject more often in the background of the day-to-day campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein reacted strongly, saying that whites cannot expect to rule a state 
that is increasingly diverse and increasingly minority: "One thing we cannot 
become in California is an apartheid society." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp was faced with the inevitable questions about his support for 
abortion in spite of his Catholic religion. He delivered a strong defense of 
his ability to separate his personal religious views from his political 
philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"I frankly am very concerned when people start using my religion against me," 
he said. ". . . She is implying that because I'm a Catholic I cannot truly be 
pro-choice." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstien responded, "I have no problem with your being a Catholic. I have the 
greatest respect for that." But she criticized the attorney general for 
representing the Legislature and governor in court battles when they sought to 
impose abortion restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Later, they returned to abortion again, in particular the question of abortions 
for purpose of sex selection. 
</P>
<P>
At the risk of angering purists among abortion rights activists, Feinstein 
repeated a statement published in The Times on Sunday that such abortions would 
be a "misuse of the right to choose." 
</P>
<P>
"When you lead, you also set some values," Feinstein added. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp said he found the statement shocking. He wondered if California 
would have "state inquisitors for checking with women" about their reasons for 
seeking an abortion. "Think about that." 
</P>
<P>
The candidates stood in front of gray podiums about 10 feet apart. Van de Kamp 
wore a plain blue suit, Feinstein chose a jacket in red, which is becoming her 
signature color. By their choice, there was no audience of supporters in the 
studio. The candidates requested that their answers be limited to a minute 
apiece with 30-second rebuttals. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the debate was the most dramatic single hour of a long and sometimes 
lackluster campaign. 
</P>
<P>
It came as polls continued to show Feinstein the leader, although by erratic 
margins. The Los Angeles Times Poll earlier in the month found her up by 13 
points, but the California Poll by Mervin Field saw her ahead by a 
statistically insignificant 3 points. 
</P>
<P>
By any measure, however, a decisive bloc of Democrats remained undecided going 
into these final days. 
</P>
<P>
Both candidates are running about even with the man the winner will face in 
November -- Republican Pete Wilson -- who has no serious challenge for his 
party's nomination. That is the good news. The bad news is that Democratic 
party registration is at a 56-year-low, although still ahead of the 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
The format of the debate was designed to be more like that of a joint news 
conference than a wide-open exchange of views. There were no opening statements 
and questions came from a panel of Northern California journalists. 
</P>
<P>
A second and concluding one-hour televised debate with a similar format is 
scheduled for next Sunday in Los Angeles at the unusual hour of 4:30 p.m. to 
5:30 p.m. on KCBS Channel 2. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the never-before-seen nature of these pre-primary debates, the 
viewership was expected to be fairly small. 
</P>
<P>
However, the impact of the debates will undoubtly grow as a result of extensive 
news coverage, and through re-hashing by the candidates themselves on the 
campaign trail. After all, these are among the few events of the campaign with 
the potential for something unexpected to occur. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, both candidates prepared exhaustively, with mock debates and 
hours of briefings, as if the June's outcome rode on the results. 
</P>

2 U.S. SERVICEMEN SLAIN NEAR PHILIPPINES BASE;

MILITARY: COMMUNIST REBELS ARE SUSPECTED. MEANWHILE, TALKS ON THE FUTURE OF 
AMERICAN INSTALLATIONS BEGIN.

Suspected Communist guerillas shot and killed two U.S. Air Force enlisted men 
outside the American-run Clark Air Base late Sunday, hours before crucial talks 
on the future of six U.S. military facilities in the Philippines opened today 
to violent street demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the killings in Angeles City would not affect the 
high-level talks. Clark and the nearby Subic Bay naval station are the 
Pentagon's largest overseas bases. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of heavily armed riot police surrounded the Central Bank complex, 
where the talks were held, and fired tear gas shortly after noon today to block 
an estimated 200 chanting demonstrators who attempted to march on the site. At 
least two police officers were reported injured by small homemade bombs. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. special negotiator Richard L. Armitage denounced the "lawlessness and 
banditry" of the killers of the two Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"This brutal and clumsy attempt to drive a wedge between the United States and 
the Philippines will fail," he told reporters before the opening ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt also condemned the shooting. "We will not be 
intimidated by terrorism," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The assailants escaped, and there was no immediate claim of responsibility. But 
U.S. officials and Philippine police immediately said they suspect that 
Communist guerrillas were responsible. A U.S. Marine was killed execution-style 
May 4 outside Subic Bay Naval Base. 
</P>
<P>
Police identified the victims Sunday as Airman John H. Raven, 21, and Airman 
James C. Green, 22. No hometowns were immediately available. A third American, 
Airman 1st Class Ronald Moore, 23, escaped unhurt. The men were from the 8th 
Tactical Fighter Wing stationed at Kunsan Air Base in South Korea. They had 
arrived earlier this month for an annual combat training exercise. 
</P>
<P>
The group's sergeant, who declined to give his name, said the men had walked 
out of the Holiday Lodge and Drive Inn about 8:30 p.m. in civilian clothes 
after a pool-side barbecue for the unit's 39 members. He said they were 
negotiating on the dimly lit street with a motorized tricycle driver for a ride 
downtown when they were shot. 
</P>
<P>
"They were just two young kids," the sergeant said angrily. "Good, clean-cut 
kids. They don't smoke, don't drink." 
</P>
<P>
Local police Capt. Gener Mangune quoted the tricycle driver as saying the 
gunmen had appeared suddenly from a nearby field of weeds. He said the killers 
said nothing, walked casually up to the men and fired point-blank with 
.45-caliber pistols. Five slugs were found at the scene, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They just walked up from behind and shot them in the head," Mangune said. 
"Then they fled on foot." 
</P>
<P>
Moore told local reporters that he was talking to a second tricycle driver when 
he heard the shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so scared," Moore said. "I instinctively ducked and ran back to the 
hotel." 
</P>
<P>
The Communist New People's Army has repeatedly warned that it would strike at 
American personnel and installations before the bases talks. There are about 
40,000 U.S. men and women, defense contractors and their dependents at the six 
facilities in the Philippines, but nearly half live in private homes and 
apartments outside the bases. 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect this will not be the end of it," an American official said. "There 
will be other killings. . . . The reality is we do not have the capacity to 
protect our assets." 
</P>
<P>
Partially because of the increased threat, Ambassador Platt said last week that 
he is considering plans to sharply cut the size of the embassy operation, which 
is one of the largest in the world. Up to one-third of the more than 400 
American diplomats and officials ultimately may be moved. 
</P>
<P>
The embassy also plans to move its military advisory group's headquarters, now 
isolated in Manila's suburban Quezon City, to a site beside the embassy's 
residential and recreational compound facing Manila Bay. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, a White House spokesman said, "We are appalled at what happened, 
and we will cooperate with the Philippine government and local authorities to 
fully investigate this matter." 
</P>
<P>
Hours after the shootings, a pool of blood still darkened the muddy street 
outside the two-story stucco hotel, which is about a mile from Clark's main 
gate. The town's bars and nightclubs were eerily deserted after U.S. military 
police ordered all personnel to return to the base or to their quarters in 
town. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure this will affect the economy of the town," Marino Morales, the hotel 
owner and vice mayor, said. "This town is base dependent." 
</P>
<P>
Clark has long been considered one of the safest overseas military postings. 
About 60% of the 20,000 American soldiers and family members assigned to Clark 
live in Angeles City and nearby residential areas, the largest percentage of 
off-base residence for any U.S. facility in the Pacific. About 40% of the 
15,000 Americans at Subic Bay live off-base. 
</P>
<P>
All leave and liberty for U.S. military personnel, defense contractors and 
their dependents was canceled throughout the Philippines after the shootings, 
and "non-essential off-base travel" was restricted, military spokesman Lt. 
Cmdr. Kevin Mukri said. 
</P>
<P>
Eight Americans have been killed in the last 13 months in attacks blamed on 
Communist assassins. Although weakened by internal divisions and Philippine 
military operations, the rebels still control vast portions of the country, 
with about 19,000 guerrillas in the field, according to military analysts. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's shootings were the first attack on Americans at Clark since October, 
1987, when Communist assassins killed three U.S. servicemen just outside the 
base and wounded an officer. The killers were arrested and jailed but later 
escaped. The surrounding province of Pampanga has long been a center of 
Communist activity. 
</P>
<P>
The murder of the two airmen occurred hours after Armitage, the U.S. special 
negotiator, arrived with a team of six Pentagon and State Department officials 
for today's talks on the bases. Foreign Minister Raul Manglapus led the 
Philippine delegation. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials hope the so-called exploratory talks will lead to full 
negotiations later this year. Leases originally set in 1947 on the six 
facilities expire in September, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the reduction in East-West tensions, and anticipated deep cuts in 
Pentagon spending and troop strength, the United States considers the bases 
crucial for guarding Asian sea lanes and projecting power in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
But they are a highly emotional issue for many Filipinos. The bases are widely 
seen as a vestige of the U.S. colonial period, and recent opinion polls show 
growing anti-U.S. sentiment among politicians, clergy and voters. Daily 
headlines trumpet base-related problems, from AIDS to errant servicemen who 
escape Philippine prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a normal government-to-government negotiation," cautioned one Asian 
diplomat. "The whole Philippine people will get involved. The talks are a 
national catharsis." 
</P>
<P>
Verbal sparring began even before the talks. President Corazon Aquino, 
appearing Sunday on nationwide TV, ruled out a quick deal and vowed to respect 
constitutional requirements for a formal treaty, rather than an executive 
agreement, if the leases are extended. 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of the outcome, our government has already begun to look beyond the 
bases," Aquino said. 
</P>
<P>
Armitage, a former assistant secretary of defense, was similarly testy in his 
opening statement, according to a copy of his prepared remarks. 
</P>
<P>
Saying he was not sent to "roll back the clock," Armitage acknowledged that the 
resumption of Philippine democracy in 1986 "makes interactions between our 
governments more lively, complicated and, at times, more contentious. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"If you ask us to leave, leave we shall, as expeditiously as possible and with 
our pride fully intact," he said. " . . . These negotiations could degenerate 
into acrimony unless both sides see and feel a mutuality of understanding, 
confidence and, above all, interests." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. negotiators are prepared to share the bases more with the Philippine 
military, leading to a less visible role for the Americans. The Pentagon 
particularly hopes to maintain the use of key ship-repair and bunkering 
facilities at Subic Bay. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Troubled Bases 
</P>
<P>
Clark Air Base: Headquarters for the 13th U.S. Air Force, tactical arm of the 
Air Force in the western Pacific and Indian Ocean. It is 50 miles north of 
Manila. It has been used by American forces since 1901, originally as a cavalry 
post. Pilots from the United States and allied nations train there, and it is a 
major transit point for the U.S. military's transport command. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Subic Bay Naval Base: The Navy's main supply and repair center in the western 
Pacific. It is 50 miles west of Manila. Marines train there in jungle tactics, 
and surveilance planes from Cubi Point naval air base monitor sea lanes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wallace Air Base: It provides air defense and radar monitoring for the 
Philippines. It is on the western coast of Luzon, about 150 miles north of 
Manila. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
San Miguel Communication Base: A major relay station for the U.S. Navy's 
Pacific communications system. It is about 60 miles north-west if Manila. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Camp O'Donnell: An Air Force communications and electronic warfare station. It 
is about 10 miles north of Clark. In 1942, the Japanese used it to hold 
survivors of the Bataan Death March. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Camp John Hay: A rest and recreation center for U.S. forces in the Philippines. 
It is in Baguio, a mountain resort 130 miles north of Manila. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
There are about 17,300 U.S. military personnel in the Philippines. Breakdown of 
military forces: 
</P>
<P>
Army: 600 
</P>
<P>
Air Force: 9,200 
</P>

The news crackled over a sheriff's radio. A body had surfaced on Shasta Lake. 
Local and federal investigators in six states waited for more news. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators were hoping the body was that of Gordon T. Johnson, a retired 
Glendale accountant who had been on the road in a motor home, but disappeared 
Oct. 15 after departing from Bend, Ore. But the man found in the lake two weeks 
ago was a drowned fisherman, one of 24 corpses known to rest on the bottom of 
the state's largest man-made reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Larry Jarrett of the Shasta County Sheriff's Department related the find 
with a grim quip. "The bad news is that it wasn't Gordy," he told a Federal 
Bureau of Investigation agent in Las Vegas. "The good news is that bodies are 
starting to float." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities who have detained two suspects in the illegal use of the vanished 
man's property believe that Johnson, 62, was murdered, and that his killers 
were compelled by inner spiritual voices into committing highway robbery and 
murder. Investigators say that all they need is a body to prove that Johnson 
was killed on Oct. 15 or 16, then dumped somewhere along the rugged and 
isolated 300-mile route of U.S. Highway 97 between Bend and Redding, Calif. -- 
most likely in Shasta Lake. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects in his disappearance are two California schoolteachers with 
master's degrees -- Stanley Alan Hershey, 46, and his wife, Jan Vicki Fine, 37. 
Both, say investigators and acquaintances, apparently are disciples of the New 
Age practice of "automatic writing," in which spirits are said to guide 
peoples' hands in spelling out their destiny. 
</P>
<P>
Friends and co-workers who knew Hershey and Fine as compassionate counselors 
are mystified by police allegations that the couple entwined themselves with 
Johnson, who -- accompanied only by a dog -- had taken to a lonely life on the 
road in a motor home last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Hershey and Fine are being held without bail in a Las Vegas jail on federal 
charges of conspiracy, transportation of Johnson's stolen car across state 
lines, and illegal use of his automatic banking card. In addition, the couple 
are suspected in the theft of Johnson's motor home and car and misappropriation 
of most of his $160,000 in life savings for trips to Tahiti and Las Vegas and 
shopping sprees. 
</P>
<P>
Hershey and Fine were arrested in Las Vegas, where the FBI found them with 
Johnson's Suzuki four-wheel-drive vehicle. They had made numerous cash 
withdrawals from Johnson's Glendale bank account, using an automated teller 
card, the complaint charged. They are also accused of transferring $100,000 
from Johnson's account to their own money market account. 
</P>
<P>
A federal grand jury indicted the couple on March 15 and a trial, scheduled for 
April 30, has been postponed until Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted of the lesser charges, Hershey and Fine face a maximum sentence of 
10 years in federal prison, said J. Gregory Damm, a U.S. assistant attorney in 
Las Vegas. A federal magistrate ordered that the couple be held without bail 
because "a strong finger of suspicion" points to them in the possible murder of 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
But without Johnson's body, officials said they do not know where the murder 
might have occurred or in which county to file charges. 
</P>
<P>
According to interviews with investigators, friends, business associates and 
relatives, Hershey and Fine were well-educated, respected specialists who 
tutored severely emotionally disturbed and educationally handicapped 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
In March, Fine agreed to be interviewed by The Times, but her federal public 
defender objected. Defense attorneys for Hershey and Fine have since failed to 
return calls from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Hershey's former wife, who declined to be identified, described him as a family 
man, a devoted husband with a daughter and two stepsons who was involved in 
community affairs in a small Northern California town that the woman asked not 
to be named. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we had a very good marriage," she said. 
</P>
<P>
He taught for eight years at San Quentin prison, then sold Encyclopaedia 
Britannica and spent four years as an investment counselor for two brokerage 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly a pre-ministerial student in his youth, Hershey spent much of his spare 
time reading books about New Age religion and spiritual channeling -- a 
religious social movement based on the belief that spirits can help determine 
peoples' fates, his former wife said. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, during a two-week period in April, 1986, Hershey's personality 
changed drastically, she said. He announced that spirits had informed him that 
he should get a divorce, change jobs and change his life. 
</P>
<P>
"He does automatic writing through spirits," she said. "He would write down 
instructions, then read them to me. He left me about 50 pages of automatic 
writings." 
</P>
<P>
Hershey's former wife said she never took her husband's transformation 
seriously. "I thought he was just going through the mid-life crisis," she said. 
"I was his closest friend. I kept thinking he would come back. Even after I 
filed for the divorce, I thought he would come back." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Hershey moved late in 1986 with three friends to an apartment in West 
Los Angeles. The four "frequently channeled together," recalled apartment 
manager Melissa Ward. "They said they were sent on earthly missions by 
interplanetary spirits." 
</P>
<P>
Hershey worked briefly in early 1987 as a teacher at Wilshire West in Santa 
Monica, a school for troubled and learning disabled teen-agers. There he met 
Fine, a teacher and counselor with master's degrees in special education and 
educational psychology. 
</P>
<P>
"She was the consummate pro," said Mark Mitock, owner-director at Wilshire 
West. "She had the interest of the kids at heart. She worked hard, was very 
caring and worked well with both parents and people in the community." 
</P>
<P>
Hershey stayed two months at Wilshire West, saying that he had a heart 
condition and that the work was too stressful, Mitock said. While Fine stayed 
on until June, 1988, Hershey left in March, 1987, to spend a year with the Los 
Angeles Unified School District as a teacher of emotionally disturbed students. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1988, the couple moved to New Orleans, where Hershey went into 
business as a personal counselor and gave motivational talks on television, 
associates said. Hershey and Fine were married on Nov. 25, 1988, by a New 
Orleans parish judge. 
</P>
<P>
But Hershey was not happy with his work and planned to get a teaching job with 
a correctional institution in Minnesota, associates said. The U.S. prosecutor 
said in a court hearing in March that Hershey and Fine, driving a camper, 
checked into the Lebanon Hills Park Campground in Apple Valley, Minn., on Aug. 
20, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Apple Valley also was on Johnson's itinerary. 
</P>
<P>
The longtime bachelor had worked diligently at his accounting career. Johnson 
had paid off the mortgage on his Glendale home and planned for a retirement of 
leisurely travel. He sold the house for $385,000, replaced his old Volkswagen 
with the new Suzuki and set off in August for Bend, to buy a motor home. 
</P>
<P>
In Bend, Johnson paid $219,000 for a diesel-powered 1989 Beaver Coach Marquis 
equipped with solid oak cabinetry, two televisions, a VCR and lead crystal in 
the bar. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson wanted to be "just like a turtle, with his home on his back," said his 
brother, Del Johnson, 51. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by a retirement gift, a dog named Rocky, Johnson left in late 
August on his maiden cruise to visit relatives in Minneapolis, where he planned 
to stay about a month at the Lebanon Hills campground. 
</P>
<P>
According to an account given by the U.S. prosecutor in court, Johnson, Hershey 
and Fine left the campground in early October for Bend. Authorities said they 
all checked into the Crown Villa Recreational Vehicle Park at about the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 15, according to Damm, Johnson, Hershey and Fine left the Crown Villa 
park. Johnson has not been seen since. 
</P>
<P>
But on Oct. 16, Hershey rented a boat at Shasta Lake, staying out most of the 
day, according to authorities and rental operators. Jarrett, the Shasta County 
sheriff, said that Hershey knew the lake well because his father has lived 
there more than 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
With a 370-mile perimeter, the lake has the longest shoreline of any in 
California. It has also been a repository for the bodies of swimmers, boaters 
and fishermen who have accidentally drowned. Some have remained at the bottom 
for years, even decades. "Not counting Gordy, there are 24 known bodies in the 
lake," Jarrett said. 
</P>
<P>
Then remembering the recent discovery of the fisherman, he corrected himself: 
"Make it 23." 
</P>
<P>
Jarrett said investigators theorize that Johnson's motor home was parked at a 
recreational vehicle campground in Redding, just south of Shasta Lake, on Oct. 
17. But he believes that it was Hershey, and not Johnson, who checked in there. 
</P>
<P>
According to the complaint filed in Las Vegas, Hershey rented a post office box 
in Barstow shortly after Johnson's disappearance. Retirement checks were sent 
to Johnson there, then deposited to his account but not signed by him, 
investigators said. Checks also were written on the missing man's account to 
pay for Hershey's bills, said Sgt. Robert Cosner of the Deschutes County 
Sheriff's Department in Bend. 
</P>
<P>
The court complaint also lists numerous cash withdrawals made on Johnson's 
account from automatic teller machines in Santa Monica, Barstow, Las Vegas and 
Boulder City, Nev. And in January, $100,000 was transferred from Johnson's 
account to an account in Sherman Oaks in the name of Hershey and Fine, 
according to the court complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it took three months after Johnson's disappearance for relatives to file a 
missing person report with the Deschutes County Sheriff's Department in Oregon. 
Relatives said they were not alarmed until they found a canceled check in some 
of Johnson's mail forwarded to them by his Glendale bank. The check, dated Oct. 
15, was used to pay for a trip to Tahiti for Hershey and Fine, Cosner said. 
</P>
<P>
When Oregon authorities learned that the tickets were sent to a recreational 
vehicle resort in Surprise, Ariz., near Phoenix, Cosner asked police there to 
investigate. On Jan. 29, at the vehicle resort, a deputy marshal found 
Johnson's motor home and Suzuki parked in a space rented by Hershey. But when 
the marshal confronted Hershey, he denied knowing Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Police returned after learning that the motor home and car were registered in 
Johnson's name, but by then, Hershey and Fine were gone. A note was left on the 
door of the motor home, indicating Johnson was being treated for AIDS at a Las 
Vegas hospital. "Gordy has taken a rapid turn for the worse" and was too 
"humiliated and embarrassed" to contact relatives, the note said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until March 1, after FBI agents learned about an $8,000 purchase of 
expensive Italian suits in Las Vegas, that authorities finally caught up with 
Hershey and Fine. The couple were tracked to Bally's Grand Hotel, where they 
had parked Johnson's Suzuki. 
</P>
<P>
Since their arrest, Hershey and Fine, now two months pregnant, have been living 
in separate cells at the Clark County Detention Center in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Shasta County sheriff's deputies have spent weeks combing the shores of Shasta 
Lake in search of witnesses who might have seen the suspects or Johnson. And 
federal and local investigators said they plan to conduct a massive sweep along 
the highway route soon, in an attempt to pinpoint Johnson's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
"We have leads, but nothing for sure," said Sgt. Jarrett.

POLICE SEEK 2 IN SHOOTING ON FREEWAY IN ANAHEIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Police on Sunday were searching for two young men and a red Toyota pickup truck 
in connection with a freeway shooting Saturday that left a Los Angeles man 
clinging to life. 
</P>
<P>
Gilberto Valenzuela, 27, was listed in critical condition at UCI Medical Center 
in Orange, after the 6 p.m. attack on the eastbound Riverside Freeway at the 
transition to the southbound Santa Ana Freeway in Anaheim. Valenzuela was shot 
once in the head. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim police Sunday searched for two white male suspects last seen in the 
1981 or 1982 pickup truck. Police had no further description. Although Lt. John 
Cross said investigators had not determined a motive, Valenzuela's family 
blamed the shooting on a verbal altercation between Valenzuela and occupants of 
the truck. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela and a friend were driving to Anaheim to visit another friend when 
Valenzuela, who was a passenger, leaned out his window and began yelling at two 
men in a truck, according to Valenzuela's sister, Marya Valenzuela, 22. She 
said he began yelling for no apparent reason. 
</P>
<P>
"He was yelling, 'Viva Mexico!' and things like that to two white boys in the 
truck," said the sister, who was told that version of events by Valenzuela's 
friend, a man she knew only as Abel. "Abel told him not to scream, to calm 
down," she said. "But he kept it up." 
</P>
<P>
Lt. John Haradon said Valenzuela's friend, whom he declined to name, initially 
told investigators he did not know what prompted the attack. 
</P>
<P>
"The case is far from being closed at this point," Haradon said. "Much of his 
story needs to be substantiated." 
</P>
<P>
After the yelling, the men in the pickup truck disappeared from view 
momentarily but reappeared on the left side of the red Z-28 Camaro in which 
Valenzuela was riding, his sister said she was told. 
</P>
<P>
The passenger in the truck then opened fire on the Camaro, police said. Haradon 
said between five and 10 shots were fired from a large-caliber gun, with five 
of the bullets striking the side of the car. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't even hear the shooting at first," Marya Valenzuela said. "Then the 
window on the driver's side got broken out, and Abel told my brother to get 
down. When Abel came up (from ducking), he saw Gilberto lying on the car seat, 
with all kinds of blood everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela, a warehouse worker, was born in the Mexican state of Sonora and 
moved with his family to the Long Beach area at an early age, his sister said. 
One of eight brothers and sisters, he most recently had been living with family 
members in Watts. A former street gang member, relatives described him as 
friendly but quick-tempered. 
</P>
<P>
"When somebody is playing with him, yeah, he's got a bad temper," said a 
brother-in-law, Luis Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, a restaurateur was fatally shot on the Harbor Freeway in Los 
Angeles. In April, a 16-year-old Bell Gardens youth was fatally shot while 
riding with friends on the Long Beach Freeway. And in January, one man was shot 
to death and another critically wounded when gunmen in two vehicles pulled to 
the shoulder of the Santa Ana Freeway in Anaheim, jumped out and exchanged 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1987, a series of freeway shootings resulted in criminal 
charges against 16 people.

<P>
Another Sunday, in the Caribbean this time, a breeze-tossed sea replacing baked 
Mexican hills. But the same slender and earnest figure preaching to another 
reverent crowd, the living symbol, he believes, of a special nine-year-old gift 
from providence. 
</P>
<P>
Pope John Paul II, nearing 70, does not rest on the seventh day. 
</P>
<P>
Not even on a Sunday so fraught with painful memory. 
</P>
<P>
The pontiff ended his triumphant visit to Mexico on Sunday on the ninth 
anniversary of the assassination attempt that nearly killed him. 
</P>
<P>
Turkish assailant Mehmet Ali Agca, who shot John Paul, is still in jail in 
Italy. The Pope, who lay near death for agonizing hours after emergency 
surgery, is still traveling. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, he seemed improbably full of energy at the conclusion of another of 
the foreign pilgrimages that have become the arduous trademark of a papal 
travel yen: Before the shooting, John Paul had made nine trips. He's made 37 
since. 
</P>
<P>
Homeward bound, the Pope's jet took off from Mexico City nine years to the 
minute of the attack in St. Peter's Square on Wednesday, May 13, 1981, at 5:17 
p.m. Rome time. 
</P>
<P>
No coincidence, for Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Agostino Casaroli was 
on the intercom before the wheels were up. 
</P>
<P>
"Nine years ago at this precise moment there occurred an incredible 
manifestation of hate against he who only preached love. But at the same time 
there occurred a manifestation of divine intervention . . . the intercession of 
Our Lady of Fatima, toward whom the victim of the attack nurtures so much 
devotion," Casaroli said. 
</P>
<P>
John Paul has special devotion for the virgin whom Catholics believe appeared 
to three shepherd children near Fatima, Portugal, on May 13, 1917. 
</P>
<P>
"There still remains the echo of the incredible horror of that moment," 
Casaroli said, expressing joy at John Paul's survival and his recovery. 
"Providence not only saved the life of the Pope but in a certain sense 
reinvigorated his strengths." 
</P>
<P>
The Pope himself made passing reference to the anniversary in a departure 
statement in Mexico City before a five-hour stop here in the Netherlands 
Antilles en route to Rome. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very significant date for me because, on a day like today nine years 
ago, I felt in a particular way the maternal protection of Mary," John Paul 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope's terrestrial protection has improved dramatically since that day in 
1981 when he was shot as he rode among pilgrims in the back of an open jeep. 
</P>
<P>
Here on an island of 147,000, the Pope waved to crowds from the sunroof of a 
white station wagon, but in Mexico his parade vans were shielded by bulletproof 
glass. There was a price: They sometimes had a fan but never air conditioning. 
On hot afternoons, the so-called Popemobiles became mobile one-man saunas. 
</P>
<P>
Still, by the standards of a modern presidency, the Pope's security is 
rudimentary, particularly for a man who goes out of his way to physically reach 
as many people as he can. 
</P>
<P>
One heavy afternoon in Durango last week, John Paul ordained 100 priests -- and 
embraced them all, one by one. On any given day on the road, literally hundreds 
of faithful touched the Pope's hands and kissed his ring. 
</P>
<P>
As the security system has developed since his chaotic first visit to Mexico in 
1979, an ad hoc security screen made up of Vatican personnel and local agents 
now hovers around the Pope as he travels. It is sometimes breached. 
</P>
<P>
At Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's Los Pinos residence last 
Monday, a zealous woman ran unmolested for more than 20 yards to kneel before 
the Pope. Agents were quicker to tackle a young man who tried to reach John 
Paul in Monterrey on Thursday. He turned out to be a seminarian who wanted to 
give a letter to his Pope. 
</P>
<P>
John Paul's Mexican odyssey once again offered sweaty testimony of papal 
stamina and intellect that delight, amaze and exhaust his aides. 
</P>
<P>
The pontiff visited 10 Mexican cities on 12-hour workdays, marked by great heat 
and popular passion, that brought literally millions of Mexicans into streets, 
stadiums and, once, a dry river bed, to applaud him. In all, he logged 15 
flights by plane and eight by helicopter. He rode uncounted miles in regional 
incarnations of Popemobiles to ceremonies where he delivered 26 addresses. 
</P>
<P>
On most days, the schedule slackened only for a light lunch-and-siesta break of 
about two hours. 
</P>
<P>
Except for greetings here in English, John Paul spoke Spanish in Mexico. 
Talking with reporters on the flight from Rome, the Pope assayed some Spanish, 
but it came out mostly Italian. 
</P>
<P>
John Paul writes most easily in his native Polish, but he can also converse in 
Italian, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Dutch, Slovak and Czech. 
In Mexico, with the catchy strains of "Cielito Lindo" greeting him at every 
turn, it didn't take the Pope long to catch the Spanish rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
"Mexico knows how to dance. Mexico knows how to pray. Mexico knows how to sing. 
But above all, Mexico knows how to shout," John Paul bantered in Spanish with a 
Mexico City crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it's the Pope's turn to talk," he teased an interrupting crowd in 
Monterrey. 
</P>
<P>
When John Paul talked, it was to deliver a familiar message of faith, 
brotherhood, morality and obedience to church teachings, however testing or 
controversial. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, a reporter asked what substantial changes there had been since 
the first trip in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"The essential change is that the Pope is 11 years older," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
John Paul turns 70 next Friday. A week later, he begins a three-day visit to 
the Mediterranean island of Malta.

AMERICAN ALBUM: 'DRUNK CITY' FACES UP TO ITS SOBERING PROBLEMS; 
</P>
<P>
IN GALLUP, N.M., PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO REFORM THEIR LIQUOR LAWS AND THEIR 
COMMUNITY'S IMAGE.

GALLUP, N.M. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Truckers rolling through on Interstate 40 refer to this city of 20,000 on their 
CBs as "Drunk City, U.S.A." 
</P>
<P>
The label reflects Gallup's long-established reputation as a place where people 
-- most of them from the nearby Navajo reservation -- come to get drunk. 
</P>
<P>
Along Route 66 and its assortment of bars and package outlets, drunks slump 
against buildings a block from the Santa Fe train yard, where passenger trains 
bound for Los Angeles and Chicago stop each day. 
</P>
<P>
The National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism estimates that 
surrounding McKinley County has the worst alcoholism problem in the nation. On 
average, 26,000 drunks are taken into protective custody each year in Gallup, 
and the area's rate of alcohol-related traffic accidents is twice the state 
average. 
</P>
<P>
"When you go places, you have become the butt of a joke," businesswoman Barbara 
Stanley complained. "People ask where to get 'Drunk City' T-shirts." 
</P>
<P>
Like many Gallup residents, Stanley, the executive vice president of the local 
Chamber of Commerce, is fed up with the drunkenness, and with the damage to the 
city's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
She and other residents say the real story is that Gallup finally has 
acknowledged its problem and is determined to clean it up. 
</P>
<P>
A 70-member association of local businesses known as the Gallup Downtown 
Development Group recently lobbied hard for passage of a first-of-its-kind 
zoning ordinance that will ban package liquor sales in the downtown area within 
five years. It passed despite initial opposition by the city's powerful liquor 
retailers, who eventually "came in and saw the writing on the wall and withdrew 
their protest," said Robert Rosebrough, a lawyer who heads the development 
group. 
</P>
<P>
Gallup's feisty mayor, Eddie Munoz, was elected on an anti-alcohol reform 
platform three years ago. He has since helped pass state legislation that 
enabled Gallup and McKinley County to ban drive-up windows at liquor stores, a 
matter now tied up in litigation. He also supported a bill to let local 
residents vote on a 5% alcohol excise tax, with the money earmarked for alcohol 
treatment programs. Residents voted 3 to 1 for the tax, which is now being 
collected. 
</P>
<P>
Munoz almost overdid it. Last winter he suggested erecting billboards 
proclaiming Gallup the "drunken driving capital of the world." That led to a 
recall election in which Munoz narrowly retained office. Although the mayor 
claimed the liquor industry was behind the recall, some opponents were 
residents who thought Munoz was damaging the town's fledgling reputation for 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
Still, alcohol remains a major headache for Gallup. Most of the prosecutions 
here are alcohol-related, says Dist. Atty. Forrest Buffington. On a city map 
Buffington has tacked to his wall, clusters of blue and brown stickpins mark 
the places where police have made protective custody pickups. 
</P>
<P>
"You definitely can see we've got a real maggot problem here," the blunt-spoken 
Buffington said, indicating the bars with the greatest number of pickups. 
"There's no reason this should be allowed to persist." 
</P>
<P>
Under the protective custody program, begun in 1973 after public drunkenness 
was decriminalized, police hold people in the city drunk tank for 12 hours 
before releasing them. No attempt is made to put them through alcohol 
detoxification. 
</P>
<P>
The city recently asked the federal government for $2 million to replace the 
drunk tank, which Munoz contends is "inhumane," with a 150-bed detox facility 
and four after-care centers on the Navajo reservation. 
</P>
<P>
More attention must be paid to conditions on the reservation, Munoz and others 
argue, since Gallup's importance as a retail center for the 165,000 Navajos 
partly explains the alcohol problem. Alcohol sales or possession have long been 
prohibited on the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
The "brightest hope" for the future is a recent $200,000 planning award from 
the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a major health-care philanthropy, to 
prepare a proposal for a long-range regional alcohol abuse program, Rosebrough 
says. 
</P>
<P>
If the proposal is approved, the foundation will commit $3 million over five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
But from her vantage point at the Chamber of Commerce, Barbara Stanley is wary 
of easy-sounding solutions. A lifelong Gallup resident, she has seen reform 
movements come and go. 
</P>
<P>
"We have sort of a multiheaded problem here that's going to take a whole lot of 
work," she said.

has had a reputation for one of the worst alcoholism problems in the nation -- 
is fighting back, as American Album explains. A local business association 
recently lobbied for passage of a first-of-its-kind zoning ordinance that will 
ban package liquor sales downtown. Even the mayor, Eddie Munoz, above, was

Three people were killed and 20 injured in the upheaval, hospital sources said. 
The rebels seized Radio Madagascar, saying they wanted to end 15 years of 
dictatorship by President Didier Ratsiraka and his family, who they said had

arrested the 13 dissidents, who had taken hostages, diplomatic sources said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Conservative Yemen and Marxist South Yemen have united their armed forces and 
agreed to withdraw them from their capitals in the latest swift move towards a 
historic merger scheduled for this month. 
</P>
<P>
Officials and diplomats have widely predicted that a united Yemen will be 
declared before the end of May. 
</P>
<P>
The Sana-based weekly publication 26 September quoted "reliable sources" Sunday 
as saying the declaration will come during the last week of May, six months 
ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"All arrangements for this historic event in the life of Yemen and the Arab 
nation have been completed, and there remain only minor executive measures," 
the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh said Saturday that the security forces of 
both countries have been dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
"From now on, there is no reason for the existence of the state security organ 
in Aden and the national security organ in Sana -- both have been dissolved 
within the framework of the united state," Sana radio quoted him as saying. 
</P>
<P>
"It is our view that the capitals should be cleared of armed forces, which 
should be withdrawn to defined military zones . . . rather than piling up 
weapons in the capitals," Saleh said. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in Sana said the move clears one of the main stumbling blocks to the 
merger. Saleh's government has strong military backing, while South Yemen wants 
a clear separation between the state and military. 
</P>
<P>
"Armies will be moved to border areas of the new state, and there will be a 
larger role in the cities for a unified police force," one diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
The weekly 26 September said Saleh and the head of the ruling South Yemeni 
Socialist Party, Ali Salim Bidh, will decide the date for a final meeting 
between both parliaments at a summit in Aden. It gave no date. 
</P>
<P>
In the last major step before the unity declaration, both legislative bodies 
are due to ratify a draft constitution approved in November. A joint 
ministerial meeting will take place May 20 to approve the rules of the merger 
process, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats and officials in Yemen say the merger has been speeded up to 
forestall any attempts to undermine the creation of the new state of 12 million 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia expressed renewed support Sunday for the union and denied a press 
report that it was trying to sabotage the move by funding fractious Yemeni 
tribesmen near its borders. 
</P>
<P>
Initial plans called for the state to be announced by Nov. 30 after a popular 
vote on the unity constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats say the referendum has apparently been scrapped, and the six-month 
transition period initially envisioned extended to 2 1/2 years from the 
declaration date to allow ample time for ministries to merge and political 
parties to form. 
</P>
<P>
Elections will be held at the end of that period. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say Saleh will be named president of the united Yemen and Bidh vice 
president. It was not known what would happen to the current South Yemeni 
president, Haider abu Bakr Attas. 
</P>
<P>
A transitional parliament will be formed with 31 representatives from newly 
formed political parties, 159 Yemeni deputies and 111 from South Yemen, 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The new legislative body must ratify 53 draft unity laws. 
</P>
<P>
South Yemen has been liberalizing its economic institutions in anticipation of 
the merger. Last Thursday, it devalued its dinar by 24% in a move which bankers 
said effectively merged it with Yemen's riyal, bringing the two closer to a 
common currency.

Senior leader Deng Xiaoping met Sunday with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. 
</P>
<P>
It was Deng's first public appearance in three months, dispelling the latest 
rumors of his death. 
</P>
<P>
A Chinese reporter said on condition of anonymity that Deng commented on last 
week's rumor on Asian financial markets that he was dead. "But here I am 
today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Chinese journalists were told not to report on the meeting. The 
national television news failed to mention it, the first time it has ever been 
known to keep silent on a meeting between Deng and a visiting head of state. 
</P>
<P>
However, the official New China News Agency issued a brief report, saying Deng 
met Mubarak "as his old friend."

A commercial fishing boat captain was arrested after a woman crew member jumped 
into the sea, swam to a passing boat and reported that he had beaten, shot at 
and sexually abused her. The Coast Guard intercepted the 40-foot Dorothy L. and 
ordered it into Santa Cruz Harbor, where, authorities said, a search turned up 
a cache of emeralds, possibly smuggled from South America. Paul Batsford, 49, 
skipper of the vessel, was jailed on suspicion of sexual assault and weapons 
violations after another crew member "generally confirmed all of the victim's 
statements," Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Lt. Bruce Simpson said.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has approved permits for two waste 
incinerators in the East Bay, despite objections from nearby residents who want 
the 1960s-era facilities closed. The permits, which go into effect June 30, 
were granted to Chevron Chemical Co., which operates a chemical plant in 
Richmond, and Shell Oil Co., which has an oil refinery in Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
Under the permits, tighter controls were imposed that limit burning to wastes 
generated on site, according to EPA spokesman Al Zemsky. "We can't say there is 
no risk" to nearby residents, Zemsky said. "But the risk involved is minimal." 
Henry Clark, spokesman for the West County Toxics Coalition, which wanted the 
burning to stop, said residents do not believe incinerators can be safe and 
fear their health problems have been caused by the burning operation.

CONTENDERS AND ISSUES: HIGHLIGHTS OF THE DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Following are excerpts on key topics covered in Sunday night's Democratic 
gubernatorial debate in San Francisco between former San Francisco Mayor Dianne 
Feinstein and Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp: 
</P>
<P>
ABORTION 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp: "When it gets to (a woman's right to a) choice, I will not impose 
my religious values (as a Catholic) because I don't want them to impose it on 
me. And I just have to ask Mrs. Feinstein because this has come up a number of 
times in this race, she's implying that because I'm a Catholic I cannot truly 
be pro-choice." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein: "John, I have no problem with your being a Catholic, I have the 
greatest respect for that. What I have a problem with is your record, your 
defense of the governor's cut of Medi-Cal for abortions for poor women five 
years in a row, your defense of the governor's cut for family planning clinics 
two years in a row. I just simply am saying that I believe that a woman's right 
to choose is best protected by a woman who believes, personally, who will veto 
any legislation that infringes on that right." 
</P>
<P>
PERSONAL FINANCES 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp: "I think we're entitled to know who is behind Mayor Feinstein, who 
the investors are behind her husband (investment banker Richard C. Blum), what 
the influences are and by the way, why no (personal federal income) taxes in 
1985?" 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein: "I do want to answer your question on why no taxes. . . . Why no 
taxes? Because we signed a joint return. My husband took a major loss with a 
series of ice cream parlors and that was the reason (no federal income taxes 
were paid). You know, you've been very sanctimonious, John. You tried not to 
reveal your own family trust and when it was revealed there were 14 companies 
doing business with South Africa as part of that trust. So if I were you, I 
wouldn't be quite so sanctimonious." 
</P>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO'S FINANCES 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein: "There was a $77-million shortfall (in city revenues). . . . 
Shortfalls are nothing new. They are not going to be anything new to San 
Francisco. They are not going to be anything new to the state. . . . I have 
certain ways I would have handled it, yes, and certain priorities. The city 
census hired 1,200 new workers. I probably would not have done some of that, 
hiring. . . . One of the things I've learned is key and critical is a reserve 
(fund). And that is one of the reasons I would insist on having a state 
reserve. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp: "There is a word that Mrs. Feinstein just can't use. Apparently 
it's not within her. Say the word 'deficit,' the 'D' word. It's easy, and I 
think you'll feel a lot better. All of us make mistakes. Mrs. Feinstein 
inherited a surplus, she spent it down, she raised the number of employees in 
San Francisco by 3,000 and she left Mayor (Art) Agnos in a deep, deep hole." 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT ETHICS 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp: "All the while, as I've been attorney general, we've taken a great 
number of enforcement investigations, a great number of enforcement actions, 
against those in public life at the state, judicial and local levels. We've 
taken about 25 enforcement actions out of 100 cases where the evidence 
justified it. . . . By and large, it's been a good record, hampered in large 
part by the failure of state laws. And that's why I have an ethics initiative 
on the ballot in November." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein: "My records indicate that in 1987 there were 25 bills, either on 
ethics or campaign reform, that were deemed significant and the attorney 
general took no position on those bills. I'm not familiar with any vigorous 
prosecutions, certainly of members of the Legislature. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
LEADERSHIP 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein: " . . . What's most important, I think, is someone who can lead and 
change. If you want to do things just as they've always been done, take the 
insider candidate, I think that's clearly the choice that exists in this 
election. I'm going to shake things up if I get there and I'm going to have the 
freedom to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp: " . . . I believe in basic Democratic principles which represent 
the majority of the people of this state, and that is for equity, it's for good 
government that delivers the goods. It's for leading this state with real 
change. . . . We're going to change California for the better." 
</P>
<P>
CLOSING REMARKS 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp: "Thank you for staying with us and not switching to 'The Simpsons' 
tonight. . . . Now, I'm not the favorite candidate of the status quo or the oil 
companies or the chemical companies or the gun lobby, because you can't keep 
the California dream alive doing business as usual." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein: " . . . I never thought I'd be here on a Mother's Day but here I am. 
. . . This election I think is really a choice between two Californias, it's a 
choice between the California of diminishing dreams, the California of high 
school dropouts, of unsafe streets, of unmanaged growth, of increasing 
pollution, or it's a California that is boldly going to take a step in to the 
future, and take its place as leader in the Pacific Rim and assert some new 
values."

VANDALS BLAMED FOR GASOLINE SPILL INTO L.A. RIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARISSE JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An apparent act of vandalism caused hundreds of gallons of diesel gasoline to 
be washed down a storm drain and into the Los Angeles River on Sunday, sending 
local and state officials scurrying to prevent the spill from flowing into the 
ocean. 
</P>
<P>
As much as 1,100 gallons of gasoline may have poured into the river after a 
fuel pump in a downtown city sanitation yard leaked for an unknown amount of 
time, said county flood control maintenance worker Bobby Arnwine. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that up to 1,100 gallons got away from us," he said. Arnwine added 
that about 1,600 gallons of the pump's gasoline apparently had leaked out, but 
500 gallons were contained in the yard with sand. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to trap the rest of the gasoline before it reached the ocean, 
officials set up floating booms in the river at three locations in the Long 
Beach area. As the gasoline was being trapped, workmen in rowboats were laying 
out cotton pads on the water's surface to absorb it. 
</P>
<P>
After letting the pads soak in the river, Gabriel Martinez and Alfonso Serrano 
guided their tiny boat through about two feet of algae-covered water and 
deposited the industrial sponges in large plastic bags on the shore. 
</P>
<P>
"We're mostly just picking up green slime," said Martinez, one of eight workers 
dispatched by Crosby and Overton Inc., a Long Beach-based firm that specializes 
in such cleanups. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the county's hazardous materials team said that a small quantity of 
fuel appeared to have formed a light sheen around some of the booms. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't say exactly how much, but it wasn't any great quantity," said Irwin 
Biederman, a hazardous materials specialist for the Department of Health 
Services. "This is a pretty minor event." 
</P>
<P>
As of Sunday evening, none of the fuel had entered the sewer system, officials 
said. Storm drains had been flushed out, and county health officials said a 
contractor had been called to finish cleaning up the spill at its source. 
</P>
<P>
The gasoline leak apparently began Saturday night or early Sunday morning in a 
city sanitation yard on Mission Road, just east of the river. Officials 
speculated that vandals may have sneaked into the yard and broken the nozzle on 
a gasoline pump, leaving it leaking. 
</P>
<P>
A city sanitation worker discovered the leak shortly before 8 a.m. and called 
the Fire Department, Staheli said. 
</P>
<P>
The spill's discovery came only a day after two neighborhoods in Long Beach had 
to be evacuated after four illegally dumped 55-gallon drums were discovered to 
be leaking a highly toxic and combustible chemical. Residents were allowed to 
return home after the cleanup was completed.

</P>
<P>
Sitting in the pulpit of Holman United Methodist Church on West Adams Boulevard 
on Sunday, Tutu closed his eyes meditatively, and joined the choir in singing 
"Oh Freedom," an African-American spiritual heard often during the civil rights 
movement of the 1960s: 
</P>
<P>
 "And before I'd be a slave 
</P>
<P>
 I'd be buried in my grave 
</P>
<P>
 And go home to my Lord and be free." 
</P>
<P>
 Tutu noted the links between the civil rights movement and the liberation 
struggle in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"We thank you for the inspiration that we have received from your own civil 
rights movement," he told the overflow crowd of more than 900 at the 11 a.m. 
services. "Thank you for Martin Luther King Jr. Thank you for those who were 
his mentors such as James Lawson." 
</P>
<P>
Once an aide to King, Lawson, the church's pastor, was a key figure in the 
civil rights movement. He is also Tutu's friend. 
</P>
<P>
The 58-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate had come to the church as part of a 
10-day speaking and fund-raising tour in Southern California. While Tutu spoke 
of the need to end apartheid, his message was also punctuated with his 
characteristic humor. 
</P>
<P>
"When the missionaries came to our neck of the woods, we had the land and they 
had the Bible," he said, describing the arrival of colonialism to the African 
continent. "They said, 'Let us pray,' and we foolishly closed our eyes. And 
when we opened our eyes, we had the Bible and they had the land." 
</P>
<P>
The ebullient Tutu couldn't help laughing along with the congregation. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his anecdote on colonialism, Tutu paid tribute to those who came to 
Africa to build clinics and hospitals and to minister. The Bible, he said, 
turned out to be an important tool for the oppressed people of South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"If you wanted to oppress people, the last thing you should have made available 
is the Bible because it is the most subversive -- the most revolutionary -- for 
those who you would wish to be docile," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't need a Marxist communist manifesto," he said. "Nothing is more 
radical (than the Bible). So we say thank you for bringing the Bible. We are 
taking it seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Tutu likened black South Africans to people set free from bondage by God. 
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing our promised land in sight now," he said. "We are seeing the 
possibility of a new South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
He stretched out his arms, asking: "When God is for us . . . " -- here the 
congregation joined in, reciting the Scripture with him -- "who can be against 
us?" 
</P>
<P>
In a Mother's Day tribute, Tutu came down from the pulpit after his sermon and 
hugged the congregation's oldest mother -- a 97-year-old church member -- and 
the newest mother, who held a 9-day-old child in her arms. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, church members sold taped recordings of the archbishop's speech and 
books on Southern Africa. Many at Sunday's services found a special message in 
the sermon for African-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"It strengthened my faith in God and the righteousness and victory of our 
struggle," said Karen Williams, who visited Holman to hear Tutu. "It's 
important that we connect our struggle here with (that of) our brothers and 
sisters in South Africa." Seventeen-year-old Daniel McClellan viewed the speech 
as a "wake-up call." 
</P>
<P>
"His message was that we need to shape up our attitude and get more involved in 
foreign policy," McClellan said. "I think that one day South Africa will be 
free and run by a black majority." 
</P>
<P>
Lawson said he hoped Tutu's visit would inspire the African-American community 
to contribute to the development of South Africa and the continent as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the African-American community must become the instrument for 
pouring into Africa human resources, talent," the minister said. "They need 
doctors, lawyers, engineers, pilots. These are all things in which we can 
help."

SHOOTING MAY BE FIRST BY ASIAN GANGS IN POMONA; 
</P>
<P>
VIOLENCE: A 16-YEAR-OLD IS KILLED IN A DRIVE-BY ATTACK. THE CITY HAS LONG BEEN 
PLAGUED BY BLACK AND LATINO GANGS.

<P>
A 16-year-old Vietnamese youth was shot to death in Pomona on Sunday, the 
victim of what police believe was the first gang violence initiated by Asians 
in a city that has long suffered from battles waged by black and Latino gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Luc Huynh was standing outside a party shortly after midnight when unknown 
assailants in three vehicles sped past him, firing a spray of bullets, said 
Pomona Police Lt. Larry Todd. Friends rushed the wounded teen-ager to Pomona 
Valley Community Hospital, where he died of a gunshot wound to the upper chest, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The drive-by shooting apparently was initiated by Asian gang members, "and to 
the best of my knowledge that's the first incident of this type that we've 
had," said Todd. He added that investigators had not determined whether Huynh 
was a gang member. 
</P>
<P>
The murder may have been an isolated incident, Todd said. But in a city where 
territorial wars between Latino gangs have raged for years -- a 7-month-old 
baby wounded while nestled in its father's arms was among the most recent 
victims -- no incidents of gang violence are being taken lightly, the 
lieutenant said. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, most of our gang people are assigned to the black and Hispanic 
gangs which are predominant here," said Todd. He added, however, that 
investigators from Pomona "will be contacting Orange County and other places 
where there are large Asian populations and finding out if what we have here 
may be the start of something new." 
</P>
<P>
One city official lamented the gang violence that has shaken many Pomona 
residents. Councilwoman Nell Soto said that police are still uncertain whether 
Huynh's shooting was gang-related, but she said it really doesn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a problem with our youth, whatever the ethnicity," said Soto, whose 
family has lived in Pomona for eight generations. "It isn't just Pomona. It's 
all over. And we have to come up with programs to abate this problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what Pomona can be," she added. "If we lose our children, society is 
lost." 
</P>
<P>
Pomona, a city of 121,000 35 miles east of Los Angeles, is only one of many 
areas reflecting the growing tide of gang violence throughout Los Angeles 
County, officials said. This year, 1,302 felonies were attributed to gangs 
through March. And Huynh was only one of several to fall victim to possibly 
gang-related violence over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Less than three hours after Huynh was shot down, five men in Lynwood were 
wounded in a shooting that may have been gang-related, said Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department Sgt. Jack Ewell. 
</P>
<P>
The men were sitting in a vehicle on California Street near Imperial Highway 
about 2:30 a.m. Sunday when shots rang out, wounding two in the chest, two in 
the leg and one in the head, said Ewell. They were taken to St. Francis Medical 
Center, where two were in critical condition and three were listed in stable 
condition with less serious wounds. None of the victims were identified.

KAISER NURSES WALK OUT; 2 FACILITIES ARE AFFECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 900 registered nurses walked off the job Sunday at two Kaiser 
Permanente facilities, including the company's flagship hospital on Sunset 
Boulevard in Hollywood, where officials said they were forced to slash their 
patient load by two-thirds. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the strike, officials at the Kaiser Foundation Hospital -- the 
major referral hospital for serious illness and injury in Kaiser's Southern 
California network -- postponed all elective surgeries. They also shut down 
their cardiac surgery and neonatal intensive care units, making arrangements 
for patients requiring such specialized services to be treated at medical 
centers outside the Kaiser network. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's walkout, which began just after midnight, marked the second time in 
six weeks that Kaiser employees in Southern California have struck the nation's 
largest health maintenance organization. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike last month's sweeping strike by 11,200 technicians, maintenance 
workers and licensed vocational nurses in Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura 
counties, Sunday's walkout affects only the 632-bed Kaiser Foundation Hospital 
and the 40-bed Skilled Nursing Care Facility in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
Neither side expects a quick resolution to the strike. Kaiser officials Sunday 
predicted that the walkout could last a month. 
</P>
<P>
David Bullock, southern regional director of Local 535 of the American 
Federation of Nurses, which represents the 925 striking employees, said, "We 
will be out here for as long as it takes to get them to change their offer." 
</P>
<P>
Union officials added that a severe nursing shortage should make it easier for 
Kaiser nurses to stay off the job. During the strike, the union is permitting 
its members to work at other area hospitals on a fill-in basis. 
</P>
<P>
Both monetary and professional issues are at stake in the labor dispute. The 
nurses say the wage hikes Kaiser has offered would be severely offset by 
overtime cutbacks. They also complain that the company is trying to create a 
two-tiered system in which nurses with less experience receive lower wage hikes 
than more experienced employees. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the nurses contend that Kaiser has refused to seriously address 
the problem of nurses handling non-nursing duties, such as housekeeping, 
clerical work and serving meals to patients. 
</P>
<P>
Union members voted overwhelmingly last week to reject Kaiser's final offer -- 
a three-year contract that called for salary increases of between 7% and 12.5% 
during the first year and hikes in each of the next two years of either 4% or 
4% above the average wages at area hospitals, whichever is greater. The package 
also called for a joint union-management committee to study the issue of 
non-nursing duties. 
</P>
<P>
Al Bolden, Kaiser's vice president of human resources, said the package is 
"designed to keep us in the forefront of the industry and to allow us to 
attract qualified health care professionals." 
</P>
<P>
But union officials branded the committee plan a stalling tactic. Bullock said 
the proposed overtime cutbacks would be so severe that, by union calculations, 
some nurses would suffer a 1% reduction in salary, even with the raises. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to look at the bottom line -- how much money our members take home," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
While striking nurses were picketing both the hospital and the Inglewood 
clinic, Kaiser officials were relying on management nurses -- including some 
from facilities in Northern California and Oregon -- to care for those patients 
who had not been sent elsewhere in anticipation of the strike. 
</P>
<P>
"It's disruptive to our patients, who need to be diverted," said Joseph Hummel, 
administrator of the Sunset Boulevard hospital, where the normal patient load 
of 425 had been reduced to 120 by Sunday. But, he said, "we have not 
compromised the quality of care at all."

Cockroaches, beetles, dogs and humans all employ the same gait when running, 
researchers at UC Berkeley revealed last week. Insects employ a running gait 
and not a walking gait, they have found, while crabs actually gallop. 
</P>
<P>
Biologist Robert Full discovered these facts while testing the various species 
on treadmills enclosed in airtight plastic boxes that allow measurement of even 
the minuscule amount of oxygen consumed by the smaller species. The results may 
have application in robotic design. 
</P>
<P>
The main thing Fuller has found, he said, is that the energy required in 
getting from one place to another is not greatly affected by how many legs an 
animal has or even by the way it moves. The energy required to walk or run 
depends much more heavily on the amount of force needed simply to hold the body 
up against gravity than on the mechanical power needed to swing the legs and 
propel the body forward. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than smoothness of gait or even the number of legs an animal has, the 
key to economy of movement, Fuller has found, lies in the time it takes each 
leg to go through its whole cycle of movement and the force produced by the leg 
muscles.

PARAPHILIA SPANS EXTREMES OF SEXUAL DISORDERS; 
</P>
<P>
MENTAL ILLNESS: UNUSUAL BEHAVIORS RANGE FROM OBSCENE PHONE CALLS TO RAPE AND 
CHILD ABUSE. THEIR CAUSE MAY LIE IN THE BRAIN, NOT IMMORALITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By LARRY THOMPSON, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It takes a tragedy like the abrupt end of a successful, decade-long presidency 
at a major university to focus public attention on the problems of unusual 
sexual behaviors that, in the extreme, are considered to be a form of mental 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, it was disclosed that Richard E. Berendzen, 51, resigned as president 
of American University because of accusations that he made obscene phone calls 
to women running day-care centers in Northern Virginia. No formal charges have 
been filed against him. 
</P>
<P>
Berendzen is now undergoing treatment at the sexual disorders clinic at Johns 
Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore. At his request, the 
hospital has declined to release any information about his treatment or 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
Society once viewed behavior such as making obscene phone calls in moral terms, 
calling it a sexual deviation or perversion. Mental health experts who study 
sexual disorders now refer to a range of problems from voyeurism to sexual 
violence by the scientific term, paraphilia. 
</P>
<P>
Broadly defined, paraphilias are sexually arousing behaviors that for most 
people are repulsive and not sexually gratifying. In extreme forms, they 
include having sex with animals, sexual abuse of children and rape. 
</P>
<P>
Some paraphilias, however, are considered harmless. They may involve wearing a 
certain piece of clothing or a special smell. Although there are no reliable 
statistics about how many people suffer paraphilia, John Money, a clinical 
psychologist who has pioneered the treatment of sexual disorders, said that 
although he believes that serious paraphilias are rare, "the minor ones that 
don't hurt anybody probably are intensely common." 
</P>
<P>
Obscene phone calls are not uncommon. C&amp;P Telephone Co. reports that 22,000 
complaints about such calls were filed last year in the Washington area; many 
more are never reported to authorities. Most callers, experts say, never take 
any action beyond just making a phone call. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of paraphilics are men, and much of what is known about 
paraphilias comes from studies of sex offenders identified by the criminal 
justice system. Experts agree that there are female paraphilics as well, but 
little is known about them. 
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, scientists who study sexual behavior have begun to trace 
the origins of paraphilias to suspected physical changes in the brain and to 
sexual or emotional trauma usually experienced during childhood. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that we are just learning that people who commit these crimes are not 
necessarily just sex perverts or oversexed or morally degenerate, but they have 
neuropsychiatric problems," said Eli Coleman, a psychologist in the human 
sexuality program at the University of Minnesota School of Medicine in 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence for a brain abnormality is preliminary. Some paraphilias may be 
related to hormone systems within the brain, Money said. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent study of only one patient, Ronald Langevin at the Clark Institute 
in Toronto used radioactive tracers to show a difference in brain activity 
between a man diagnosed as being a sadist and two normal volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
Some researchers see a parallel between certain paraphilias and 
obsessive-compulsive disorders. In studies of obsessive-compulsive patients, 
Judith L. Rapoport, a psychiatrist at the National Institute of Mental Health, 
has shown that there are neurological alterations in parts of the brain. Some 
patients respond to drug treatments that alter the biochemistry of the brain 
and relieve the need to repeat obsessive-compulsive behaviors, such as frequent 
hand-washing. 
</P>
<P>
Paraphilias may be related to obsessive-compulsive disorders in which "reason 
and rationality are lost," said Coleman. "When the behavior is compulsive, it 
is driven by an attempt to reduce stress." 
</P>
<P>
For some paraphilics, the behavior "may initially be driven by the sexual 
excitement and may still have some of that element. But the primary motivation 
is the reduction of stress and anxiety," he said. "There is usually a 
short-lived feeling of relief, followed by the recurrence of the anxiety. So 
the person is compelled to seek the behavior again and again. It is 
overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, scientists have believed that compulsive sexual behavior has 
psychosocial roots that reflect a major problem within the person's emotional 
makeup. 
</P>
<P>
Studies of people with sexual disorders suggest that problems may arise not 
only from childhood sexual abuse or trauma but in families where sex was either 
never discussed or regarded as evil. In these cases, normal erotic development 
was blocked. 
</P>
<P>
Paraphilics commonly share certain characteristics. They tend to have low 
self-esteem. Many are extremely angry at women and have great difficulty with 
intimacy, especially when it becomes erotic. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals with serious sexual disorders may exhibit more than one type of 
paraphilic behavior, according to Judith V. Becker, director of the sexual 
behavior clinic at the New York State Psychiatric Institute in New York City. 
She studied 500 male sex offenders who had been arrested and were at the clinic 
for treatment. The men volunteered to be part of the study that examined all 
aspects of their sexual behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"When a person engages in one type of paraphilic behavior, there might be some 
other sexual disorders also," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Becker's research focuses only on the most serious sexual disorders, so it 
cannot be generalized to all paraphilics. Most researchers in this field see 
paraphilias as a continuum of behavior much like addiction to alcohol or drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Treatments for paraphilics range widely, from traditional psychotherapy and 
group therapy to highly aggressive, confrontational approaches that force the 
paraphilic to face the impact of his activity on others. 
</P>
<P>
Therapy is also aimed at making sex offenders aware of feelings of their own 
that may be hidden, said William Samek, a sex therapist in private practice in 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"They are trying to escape their anger, their hostility, their insecurity, 
their fear of rejection, their dislike of themselves," Samek said. 
</P>
<P>
Mental health experts have begun using different kinds of drugs, in addition to 
psychotherapy, to help change paraphilic behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"We have some promising evidence to indicate that drugs for 
obsessive-compulsive disorders are effective," Coleman said. These include 
fluoxetine (Prozac), a new antidepressant drug that helps reduce obsessive 
behavior.

AUSTRALIAN TOOLS MAY DATE TO 50,000 YEARS

Stone artifacts found in northern Australia indicate that people roamed the 
island continent at least 50,000 years ago -- about 10,000 years earlier than 
previously thought, scientists reported last week in the journal Nature. A team 
of Australian archeologists found more than 1,500 man-made artifacts, including 
a grindstone, primitive tools and strangely shaped pieces of quartz, about 
eight feet below the ground at the base of the Arnhem Land plateau in the 
Northern Territory. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Roberts of Wollongong University and his colleagues then examined some 
of the artifacts using thermoluminescence dating -- a method that determines 
the age of artifacts containing crystal structures, such as sand grains, by 
looking at how long ago they were last exposed to heat energy, in this case, 
radiation from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
Results of the dating "suggest the arrival of people between 50,000 and 60,000 
years ago in northern Australia," the researchers said. The new dates "are not 
only the oldest yet proposed for aboriginal occupation, but also may mark the 
time of initial human arrival on the Australian continent," the researchers 
said, noting that no man-made tools or artifacts were found in sediments dating 
back farther than 60,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts and his colleagues speculated that early humans arrived in Australia by 
sea from the Malaysian region.

1 ARRESTED IN PROTEST AT L.A. COUNTRY CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly a month to the day when police in riot gear arrested 11 people 
protesting alleged racism at the exclusive Los Angeles Country Club, about 75 
demonstrators staged a return march to the club Sunday, led by black community 
activist Don Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was the only demonstrator arrested. 
</P>
<P>
He was booked at West Los Angeles Jail on suspicion of trespassing, a 
misdemeanor, and released on bail later in the day, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a bright green golf cap and white golf shoes, shirt and sweater, 
Jackson entered the club's main driveway entrance at 10101 Wilshire Blvd. and 
demanded that security guards let him in. They denied him entry because he was 
not a club member. Jackson refused to leave the property until someone 
explained how he could join. Instead, he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Jackson was a white man who carried his golf clubs. "I brought him 
to prove the point that if a white man could carry a black man's golf clubs, 
then a black man should be allowed to join a white man's club," Jackson said. 
"And if (country club managers) want to stand as barriers of racism and 
American apartheid, I want to be here to confront it." 
</P>
<P>
Student organizers of the protest said the country club has not had a black 
member in 22 years. They also allege that recently, a black friend of a club 
member was denied entry to the club. 
</P>
<P>
Managers of the club could not be reached for comment.

LAND DEVELOPERS LEERY OF WETLAND PROTECTION PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A new federal agreement on wetlands protection is vexing the nation's largest 
land developers, including the Irvine and Arvida companies, which fear that it 
may disrupt some of their most ambitious projects and hamper related wetlands 
restoration work. 
</P>
<P>
The "memorandum of agreement" between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the 
Environmental Protection Agency, signed in February, seeks to clarify the rules 
under which the corps grants permits to builders to fill wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
Some developers argue that the new agreement has changed the rules by making it 
more difficult to compensate for wetlands destruction by restoring or creating 
other wetland areas -- an assertion that the corps and the EPA deny. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists, on the other hand, assert that the agreement does not go far 
enough and leaves broad loopholes that could lead to further destruction of 
fast-disappearing marshes, estuaries and stream beds. 
</P>
<P>
While the effects of the new agreement will not be known for months, there are 
some indications that change may be in the offing. In an informal, in-house 
survey taken before the agreement went into effect, officials at 75% of the 
corps' district offices that were polled said they expected that the document 
would moderately or significantly change their permit-granting process. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement will have "a major impact on development," said Washington 
lobbyist Thane A. Young, a wetlands expert who represents the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very concerned about it," said Ted Brown, vice president and general 
counsel of the Florida-based Arvida Co., which is developing the gated Coto de 
Caza community in South Orange County, at the edge of the Cleveland National 
Forest. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think of any (Irvine Co.) project where there are no wetlands," said 
Sat Tamaribuchi, the company's senior director for environmental planning. 
</P>
<P>
However, Sierra Club spokeswoman Paula Carrell said environmentalists are 
equally worried because the agreement leaves open to development certain types 
of wetlands, including mud flats and seasonal ground-water pools, that they 
believe ought to be protected. 
</P>
<P>
Some Irvine Co. officials are concerned that the agreement, in addition to 
affecting development, may scuttle at least part of their $2.5-million plan to 
restore 285 acres of wetlands in the San Joaquin Marsh, next to Upper Newport 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co. wants to use the restored marshland as a "mitigation bank" that 
would allow the company to fill wetlands on other property slated for 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Carrell, the Sierra Club's Sacramento lobbyist, challenged the effectiveness of 
creating new, "off-site" wetlands to compensate for those destroyed by 
development. 
</P>
<P>
"To simply wipe out a wetland that has been created through a long, 
evolutionary period and create another one over here is not as simple as it 
sounds," Carrell said. "It's hard to duplicate evolution, and so it fails at 
least 50% of the time." 
</P>
<P>
The debate over the February agreement comes as a federal task force is 
examining ways to implement President Bush's policy objective of preventing a 
net loss of national wetlands. The task force is expected to release its report 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
In Congress, meanwhile, the House Committee on Public Works and Transportation 
has been conducting hearings on the wetlands-protection provisions of the Clean 
Water Act, which is up for renewal in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Clean Water Act, first passed in 1972, the corps has the 
responsibility for granting permits to fill wetlands for non-agricultural 
projects. The corps considers about 7,000 applications for such permits each 
year. Under the law, both the EPA and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have a 
role in reviewing and commenting on the applications, with veto power vested in 
the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
Federal law and accompanying regulations generally define a wetland according 
to its soil content, vegetation and water content. For permit purposes, a 
wetland can be as large and pristine as the salt marsh at Bolsa Chica or as 
small and degraded as a drainage ditch that has sprouted reeds. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, the corps has relied on guidelines developed by the EPA to direct 
its permit-granting process. The new agreement, according to the corps and EPA 
officials, is intended to codify and clarify those guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
The most controversial aspect of the agreement is its outline of a strict 
"sequencing" policy that some developers believe will severely restrict the 
practice of "mitigation banking." 
</P>
<P>
Under the sequencing policy, the corps must first determine whether a developer 
has any practical alternative to the destruction of wetlands. Only after 
deciding that there is no alternative can the corps move on to consider action 
that would minimize the impact of development or compensate elsewhere for its 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, many of the corps' 37 district offices have granted permits to 
fill wetlands on construction sites after developers agreed to create or 
restore wetlands at other locations, away from the proposed development. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co. is seeking to take advantage of mitigation banking through its 
reconstruction work at the San Joaquin Marsh. 
</P>
<P>
Developers, who say they endorse the Administration's goal of no net loss of 
wetlands, nevertheless argue that the new agreement puts too much emphasis on 
avoiding any negative impact on wetlands, rather than allowing developers to 
make up for the effects by creating new wetlands elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"The main concern as we see it is not debating the issue of no net loss as an 
overall goal," said Pike Oliver, of Irvine-based Southwest Diversified Inc. The 
company, which is developing residential properties in environmentally 
sensitive areas of California and Arizona, supports the no-net-loss concept, 
Oliver said. 
</P>
<P>
The real concern, he said, is that "there are provisions in that agreement, if 
they were interpreted in the extreme -- particularly the provision that 
avoidance is the primary and overriding goal -- that would really preclude the 
opportunity to create some great habitats." 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co.'s Tamaribuchi said, "Their standards for avoidance may be so 
great that we'd never be able to demonstrate that it's impractical to avoid 
(filling) a wetland anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Arvida's Brown said: "We have applications pending, for example, where the EPA 
has acknowledged that the . . . result (of the development) would create an 
enhanced ecological system. 
</P>
<P>
"But given what they see as the mandate of the (memorandum of agreement), which 
is to focus on avoidance, they are unable to look at the entire plan." 
</P>
<P>
Although Brown did not specifically cite the Coto de Caza project, others noted 
that Arvida has wetland-filling applications pending in connection with the 
project's second phase. The community is located at the end of Trabuco Canyon 
Road near Rancho Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the corps and the EPA say that the new agreement only clarifies 
the 1980 guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think this is a change in the regulations," said Cliff Rader, of the 
EPA's office of wetlands protection. "We think, in fact, it's going to help 
developers because it's going to provide some consistency and predictability." 
</P>
<P>
Rader said the agreement specifically permits the corps to consider mitigation 
banking as a means of compensating for damage to wetlands, once the avoidance 
issue has been decided. 
</P>
<P>
"The emphasis on avoidance has always been there," said David B. Barrows, 
assistant for regulatory affairs in the Army's office of civil works. The new 
agreement, he said, "certainly doesn't change the requirements or the 
regulations." 
</P>
<P>
It may, however, change the corps officials' interpretation of the regulations. 
In an informal telephone survey, officials in 50% of the corps' responding 
district offices said the agreement will cause a moderate change in the way 
they do business. About 25% said it would cause no change, while another 25% 
predicted a major change. 
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by Michael L. Davis, a biologist in the regulatory 
branch at corps headquarters. Davis cautioned, however, that the survey was 
taken before the agreement went into effect. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of (the corps officials) maybe had some concerns that it will have a 
bigger impact than it really will," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
While much uncertainty remains, one thing is clear, Tamaribuchi said: If the 
EPA does not sign off on Irvine Co. plans to use the San Joaquin Marsh project 
as a mitigation bank for other development, the company is not likely to go 
through with the work. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing is, we won't do that project unless we're allowed to mitigate 
there," he said.

200-MILE RIDE ENDS IN DEATH FOR BICYCLIST;

<P>
FATALITY: THE 66-YEAR-OLD NEWPORT BEACH MAN IS STRUCK ON SANTA ANA CANYON ROAD. 
POLICE ASK FOR HELP IN FINDING THE DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE.

A 66-year-old bicyclist was killed by a hit-and-run driver along Santa Ana 
Canyon Road, just a few miles from where he was to have completed a 200-mile 
endurance ride, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Kenneth F. Lundie of Newport Beach was found Sunday morning about 
three-quarters of a mile east of Weir Canyon Road on the side of Santa Ana 
Canyon Road, which runs parallel to the Riverside Freeway, Anaheim Police Lt. 
John Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
Lundie had been riding west on a bike lane on Santa Ana Canyon Road between 10 
p.m. and midnight when a vehicle struck him from behind, Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
The canyon road is heavily traveled but is also popular among bicyclists. 
</P>
<P>
The ride -- sponsored by the Orange County Wheelmen -- a local cyclists group, 
started at Yorba Regional Park in Anaheim and went south to Escondido, where 
bikers turned around and headed back, said Lundie's wife, Ingrid Lundie. She 
said her husband had worn a helmet for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
Lundie was to have completed the ride about 10 p.m. Cross said, but was last 
heard from when he stopped at a checkpoint in Lake Elsinore about 7:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Police Lt. John Haradon said Lundie's bike was equipped with a 
headlight, but he did not know if it had reflectors or if Lundie was wearing 
reflective clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Before the ride, Lundie told family members that he might return to his home in 
Newport Beach late. 
</P>
<P>
"I woke up at 1 a.m. and thought maybe he was too tired and decided to just 
sleep in the car," Ingrid Lundie said. 
</P>
<P>
But when he had not returned by morning, she alerted authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Nelson, president of Orange County Wheelmen, said he could not comment on 
the ride on the advice of attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Lundie retired almost two years ago as pump salesman for McCalla Brothers Pump 
&amp; Drilling Co. in Santa Ana. Since then, he had spent time baby-sitting his 
grandchildren and becoming more active in Orange County Wheelmen, his wife 
said. He had participated in several long-distance rides in Southern California 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
She said her husband kept fit and had spent a lot of time preparing for the 
most recent ride. 
</P>
<P>
"He loved it," she said. "He'd been doing this for quite a while. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes he took on a little more than he could handle, but he was loving 
what he was doing." 
</P>
<P>
Lundie had lived in Southern California all of his life. He and his wife lived 
in Newport Beach for 31 years, she said. Before that, he had lived for many 
years in Pomona, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lundie is survived by three daughters, a stepson and five grandchildren. 
Funeral services are pending. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim police ask that anyone with information on the hit-and-run call the 
traffic bureau weekdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at (714) 999-1835 or (714) 
999-1861. After hours, call the main number at (714) 999-1900.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / 70TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT; 
</P>
<P>
WHERE BADHAM, FERGUSON PART COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At first glance, the race between Assemblyman Gil Ferguson and Phyllis Badham 
doesn't look like much of a race at all. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson, after all, has held the 70th Assembly District seat since 1984 and 
won his last reelection races handily. Badham, a 30-year-old public relations 
manager, has never run for office before, much less won an election. 
</P>
<P>
What she does have, though, are positions markedly different from Ferguson's on 
a number of key issues and name recognition among longtime residents inherited 
from her father, former Rep. Robert Badham, who served as an assemblyman and 
congressman in the area for 26 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not ignoring her," Ferguson said. "Anyone who runs against an incumbent 
can get 30% of the vote. . . . A relative of someone who is known in the 
community is bound to get a more significant vote." 
</P>
<P>
While Badham is using the name as a springboard -- her campaign literature 
announces "a second generation of commitment to the public trust" -- she wastes 
little time in drawing a sharp distinction between herself and her more 
conservative father. 
</P>
<P>
"I am his daughter, not his protege," Badham said. Her father fully endorses 
her candidacy, she said, even though she supports a woman's right to an 
abortion, which her father once said he "abhorred." 
</P>
<P>
"He respects me for who I am," Phyllis Badham said. 
</P>
<P>
He might also have feelings of deja vu watching his daughter challenge the 
67-year-old Ferguson. Her campaign theme of a moderate, young challenger taking 
on an older, conservative politician out of step with his constituents is 
reminiscent of the battles Badham faced before retiring in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe an assemblyman who cares so much about (Assemblyman) Tom Hayden 
isn't concerned about the environment, traffic and all the other issues so 
important in our district," Phyllis Badham said, referring to Ferguson's 
attempts in past years to have Hayden declared a traitor and thrown out of the 
Legislature. "Mr. Ferguson is militantly anti-choice, and he's endorsed by 
Operation Rescue. . . . The 70th is strongly pro-choice." 
</P>
<P>
Badham said she will be much more environmentally minded than Ferguson, who was 
one of the lowest-rated state legislators by environmental groups. But, she 
said, she supports only parts of Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp's multifaceted 
environmental measure, known as "Big Green," on the November ballot. And her 
proposals for environmental protection, such as fostering a statewide recycling 
program, probably wouldn't do much for a devoted Sierra Clubber. 
</P>
<P>
"When I pick up my clothes from the dry cleaners, I recycle my wire hangers," 
she told a group of Saddleback Valley teachers during a campaign speech. 
</P>
<P>
When asked by a teacher if she would support some kind of tax increase to put 
more money into education, Badham was noncommittal. "When we're spending 
$36,000 a year on a prisoner, but only $3,000 on a student, I think you have to 
take a hard look at your priorities," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson may be more conservative than the average voter in his district, which 
stretches from Newport Beach south to San Juan Capistrano and into the eastern 
foothills. But if he is, that fact has not hurt him terribly at the polls. In 
1986, he ran unopposed in the primary and beat his Democratic challenger by 44 
percentage points. In 1988, he defeated Newport Beach City Councilwoman Evelyn 
R. Hart by 27 percentage points in the primary, then was reelected by a 
41-point margin in the heavily Republican district. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm elected with the largest or second-largest number of votes of anyone in 
the state of California," Ferguson said. "If I'm out of step with the 
electorate, I don't know why I get those kinds of results. I'm outspoken, and 
people know who I am. . . . If they don't like me and vote against me, I can 
accept that." 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson said Badham, like Hart, comes from "a corner of the opposition we have 
in Newport Beach" that wants to see a woman hold the 70th District seat. "They 
don't like me, and one of the reasons is that I am a man," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Badham said it is Ferguson's outspokenness and unwillingness to compromise that 
make him an ineffective legislator and keep the district from getting any real 
representation. 
</P>
<P>
"You must work with the majority party," Badham said before a group of 
Republican women at the Balboa Bay Club recently. "Unfortunately, that's the 
Democrats at the moment." 
</P>
<P>
Eileen Padberg, a Republican political consultant in Orange County who supports 
Badham, said that Ferguson has not faced a well-funded Republican challenger 
and that if Badham can raise enough money, she will have a chance to defeat 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if the people of the district hear her message, she'll win," Padberg 
said. "The whole thing hinges on how much money she can raise." 
</P>
<P>
Padberg said it will take between $200,000 and $250,000 to unseat Ferguson, but 
persuading political contributors to go against an incumbent is extremely 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has the guts to write her a check and help her," Padberg said. "If you 
go up against an incumbent, you lose the ability to have him help you ever 
again." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Badham has not proved that she can raise that kind of money. Her 
campaign was about $8,000 in debt at the close of the last reporting period in 
March, although she said that now she is receiving "a ton" of money. The next 
reporting period is at the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
Her campaign has also been slowed by internal squabbles. Political consultant 
Robert Kiley, whom Badham hired to develop an overall strategy, left the 
campaign in April and filed suit last week for breach of contract and 
nonpayment of fees. Badham said Kiley was simply not performing up to par. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney who filed the suit for Kiley, Brea City Councilman Ron Isles, is 
near the top of Badham's own endorsement list. 
</P>
<P>
Left in charge of the Badham campaign is Michael Fiorina, a Beverly Hills 
attorney and lobbyist with no previous campaign management experience and no 
political experience in Orange County. Badham said she and Fiorina met through 
the Presbyterian Church. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody chooses their campaign staff for many reasons: trust, 
ability to put together a winning team," Badham said. "Michael has the energy 
and the experience to win an Assembly campaign against an incumbent." 
</P>
<P>
Badham has the endorsement and financial support of the California and Orange 
County medical associations, as well as the California Abortion Rights Action 
League. 
</P>
<P>
"She is one of our top two priorities in the state," said Peter Scranton, 
spokesman for the Santa Monica-based abortion rights-PAC. "We gave her $2,500 
and will be committing volunteers to her campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson is running his own campaign with the help of his wife, Anita, and son, 
Mark. "I don't like taking advice from strangers at this point in my life," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Badham has challenged Ferguson to debate her; Ferguson said he will if Badham 
signs the county Republican Party's code of ethics promising to wage a clean 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Badham scoffed at her opponent's reasoning. "You mean the 11th commandment, 
which is undemocratic? I am running an ethical, honest campaign. . . . If that 
is his only reason (for not debating), then I am convinced he is intimidated by 
me and on the defensive."

STREET SMART: TIMING ISN'T RIGHT FOR NEW TRAFFIC SIGNAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
During my commute to work, I head south on Euclid Street and turn left onto 
Talbert Avenue in Fountain Valley. But since the installation of a new signal 
just down Talbert at Newhope Street, my commute time has doubled. 
</P>
<P>
My concern is the timing of the two signals. While making a left onto Talbert 
from Euclid, traffic is continuously stopped in the middle of the intersection 
because of a red light at Newhope, creating a hazard. 
</P>
<P>
It appears that the timing of the Euclid and Newhope lights are not in sync. 
Why is this? It seems that in order to keep traffic flowing safely, the timing 
of the signals needs to be changed. 
</P>
<P>
David M. Faris 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley 
</P>
<P>
There has indeed been some trouble with those signals. Jeff Sinn, Fountain 
Valley city engineer, said the pedestrian button at the Newhope signal has been 
malfunctioning, triggering the light to respond as if someone were trying to 
cross the street. The result is a longer red for folks headed eastbound on 
Talbert Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Sinn said that problem is being rectified. The city is also installing a master 
computer to control signal lights throughout the city, which will allow traffic 
engineers at City Hall to fine-tune the signal timing as the day progresses, 
better customizing it to the vagaries of traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Even then, he cautioned, life will be far from peachy for people turning left 
from Euclid onto Talbert. The priority on Talbert is to keep the signals 
synchronized for traffic headed eastbound. Unless they time it just right, left 
turners may end up hitting an occasional red light at Newhope, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to get a compromise as best you can," Sinn noted, adding that the 
city will try to give additional weight in the mornings to left turners so they 
have a better chance of getting a green light through Newhope. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
I'm really disappointed in your piece about window tinting (April 30). You're 
so busy trying to look into other cars it's lucky you're alive. Keep your eyes 
on the road, buddy! 
</P>
<P>
I agree that dark window tint should be prohibited on driver's and passenger's 
windows. But there is nothing wrong with having a light to medium tint. From 
personal experience, I think it's safe and fantastic. 
</P>
<P>
I was in a car accident. My head hit the side window, which was tinted. I think 
the tinting helped keep the glass from flying and cutting my face and my child. 
The glass shattered, but stayed intact. Also, if someone tries to break into 
your car, there is no way they can get through the tinting film to get 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
I think your article was ridiculous and a waste of time. I love window tint in 
my home and car. It preserves, protects and it's safe. 
</P>
<P>
Brenda Smyth 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
Preserves, protects and is safe, eh? Sounds like a nice commercial endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
Yours was one of several letters and phone calls spawned by the April 30 column 
that dealt with window tinting. Seems there are lots of folks out there who 
love the stuff. That's fine, gang. I was just trying to quote the law as 
recited by the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Several people said the Highway Patrol has something of a vendetta against 
tinted windows simply because of a fear that the blackened sheets of glass can 
hide an occupant with a gun, putting an approaching officer in danger. 
</P>
<P>
Others felt I should have more forcefully stated that windows can legally be 
tinted after a car has left the showroom floor as long as the windshield and 
front side windows are left untouched and mirrors are installed on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
One man called to note that the law allows people with medical conditions such 
as skin cancer to tint all their windows. Makes sense to me. 
</P>
<P>
Another caller disputed a Highway Patrol spokeswoman's claim that the darkened 
windows are more dangerous at night because they create visibility problems. He 
said there was no scientific proof. I won't hold my breath for that. 
</P>
<P>
But let me make one thing perfectly clear: I do not spend all my time looking 
into other people's cars. I have enough trouble keeping my own jalopy pointed 
in a straight line. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the new diamond lane on the San Diego Freeway: On the freeways in 
Hawaii they have signs posted that tell what the fine is for violating the 
car-pool lane. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe if Caltrans would post some signs along there, some of these turkeys 
would give a second thought about getting into there. 
</P>
<P>
Les Beauchamp 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente 
</P>
<P>
Funny you should mention this. Signs reading, "Carpool Violation $246 Minimum 
Fine," recently went up at several spots along the Costa Mesa Freeway. If the 
signs, which were paid for by the Orange County Transportation Commission, 
prove to be an effective deterrent, we may soon see similar placards sprout 
along the San Diego Freeway car-pool lanes.

MAN SET AFIRE WHEN GAS CAN EXPLODES

<P>
A Santa Ana man suffered severe burns over most of his body early Sunday 
morning when fumes from an open can of gasoline he was transporting in the back 
seat of his car exploded while he was lighting a cigarette, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Castaneda, 33, was in critical condition at UCI Medical Center's burn 
center in Orange with second- and third-degree burns over 90% of his body, said 
Santa Ana Police Sgt. James Seleno. 
</P>
<P>
Seleno said Castaneda was driving his car in the 2200 block of South Broadway 
at 5:55 a.m. with an open five-gallon container of gasoline in the back seat. 
The windows of the car were rolled up, causing the interior of the car to fill 
up with volatile gasoline fumes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As Castaneda struck a match to light a cigarette, the fumes ignited, destroying 
the car's interior and setting Castaneda on fire. 
</P>
<P>
Castaneda then lost control of the car, which rammed into a brick wall, Seleno 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After the car came to a stop, Castaneda jumped out and ran down the street 
engulfed in flames. 
</P>
<P>
Local residents, hearing the screams, found Castaneda on the street and were 
able to douse the flames, Seleno said. 
</P>
<P>
Seleno said he did not know why Castaneda was carrying the open can of gasoline 
in the car. JAMES M. GOMEZ

INITIATIVE PUSHED TO BAN OIL DRILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES TORTOLANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A petition drive has been launched in an effort to place an initiative on the 
November ballot that would ban drilling for oil and gas in the central part of 
Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Representing the Garden Grove GOO (Get Oil Out) Committee, City Councilmen J. 
Tilman Williams and Robert F. Dinsen, along with businessman Bruce Broadwater, 
have submitted the proposed initiative to the city clerk's office. The measure 
would "prohibit the drilling of oil and gas wells within 800 feet of any 
church, school or residential property." 
</P>
<P>
In May through June, 1989, Chevron USA Inc. sought city permits to drill 
exploratory wells on land it owns in the central part of the city, but after 
lengthy and sometimes acrimonious hearings before the City Council, the permits 
were denied on a 3-2 vote. 
</P>
<P>
City Clerk Carolyn Morris said petitions with at least 5,700 valid signatures 
must be submitted by May 31 for the initiative to qualify for the November 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Woodrow Butterfield, a local businessman who is running the initiative 
campaign, said the group believes that Chevron hasn't abandoned its plans to 
drill at Nelson and Pearl streets in central Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"Chevron is still sitting on that property. I think that if certain people are 
elected (to the council) they'll be right back," Butterfield said. "We did some 
informal polling by telephone recently and called 100 people and asked them if 
they approved of oil wells near schools, churches and homes, and 92% were 
opposed. I don't think we need money (from oil lease fees and taxes) so badly 
that we need to drop 56 oil wells on downtown Garden Grove." 
</P>
<P>
Margo Bart, a district land supervisor for Chevron USA Inc., said her firm has 
no plans to reapply for a drilling permit. 
</P>
<P>
"We still have in effect subsurface oil and gas leases, and we still have the 
option to utilize them. But we have a 3-2 decision against us." 
</P>
<P>
Butterfield said his group chose to pursue a ballot initiative rather than a 
city ordinance since an initiative could only be overturned by another vote of 
the residents. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Francis L. Kessler, who voted for the drilling permits, expressed 
some concern about liability. 
</P>
<P>
"If we pass a law after Chevron gets its oil leases that says they can't use 
them, do we then have to buy out their leases?" JAMES TORTOLANO

2 SUSPECTS SOUGHT IN PIZZA HUT SHOOTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police on Sunday were looking for two men who entered a Pizza Hut armed with a 
gun and rifle and shot two workers with pellets before stealing $450. 
</P>
<P>
The gunmen entered the restaurant at 1300 S. Harbor Blvd. at 11:25 p.m. 
Saturday, Police Sgt. Kevin Raisch said. 
</P>
<P>
Three employees were inside the building, but there were no customers at the 
time, Raisch said. 
</P>
<P>
"The gunmen, who were wearing bandannas, forced all three employees to lay down 
on the floor," Raisch said, "and then one of the suspects shot two of the 
employees with pellets from the automatic gun." 
</P>
<P>
One employee was shot in the neck and another in the arm, causing "large red 
welts," Raisch said. Neither employee was hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
The gunmen then stole $150 from the cash register and $300 from an unlocked 
safe before fleeing. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects were described as black and were wearing ski sweaters. One was 
about 6 feet, 1 inch, 180 pounds, with a stocky build and the other was 5 feet, 
11 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the robbery was unusual for the area, which has many apartment 
complexes and small businesses and is not known as a high crime section of the 
city.

MOPPETS SEE THE WONDERS OF A GARDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Decked out in a Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles birthday hat and sweat pants, 
5-year-old Carlos Castellanos swiped at a patch of weeds with his new green 
hoe. Then, bending over a foot tall squash plant, the swiping halted, and 
Carlos screamed for the others. 
</P>
<P>
"Ladybug," the cry went out, and four other preschoolers came running to 
examine the small, red specimen. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos was one of 11 children working on the new children's garden at Orange 
Coast College Friday morning. Started by a professor at the school about a 
month ago, the garden is now overseen by employees at the campus day-care 
center. And it is weeded, watered and harvested by the 120 children who spend 
their days at the children's center. 
</P>
<P>
Once it would have been a common sight in Orange County to see children playing 
around scarecrows, digging with small trowels and mashing pumpkin seeds into 
the ground. But with the age of housing developments and mini-malls, children 
don't often get to play in gardens, said Lucy Groetsch, the assistant director 
for the Children's Center at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
"I think most of our population of children here live in apartments and 
condominiums and don't have a chance to get out in the yard," Groetsch said. 
"It's always fascinating for children to discover that their food actually 
comes from the earth, not the supermarket. I think this kind of activity helps 
them assume some responsibility for the earth." 
</P>
<P>
The garden, about a quarter of a mile from the children's center, is a 
half-acre patch now rich with squash, tomato, bean and corn plants. Until last 
summer the land was used by the college agriculture department to raise farm 
animals. When that program was abandoned, Prof. Jay Yett of the geology 
department began working on the idea of a children's garden. 
</P>
<P>
"They used to keep a lot of animals here, cattle and sheep, and the kids would 
come over a couple times a week to see them," Yett said. "All we wanted was to 
make a garden that was large enough that they could see the plants and watch 
them grow." 
</P>
<P>
"If nothing else, they just get to walk and get away from all the hustle and 
bustle," he said, nodding at the relative quiet of the garden in the middle of 
the Costa Mesa campus. "There's really no other place nearby where the kids can 
get away. There's not much land available anymore for all this." LAURA

MINISTRY PROPERTY REQUEST TO BE STUDIED

<TEXT>
<P>
A youth ministry group's request to operate out of a building in an industrial 
zone will be the subject of a public hearing tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Lorani Ministry, a religious youth group affiliated with Grace Korean Church of 
Norwalk, wants to use property on Portal Drive to hold Bible study classes and 
other activities. 
</P>
<P>
The group has about 120 high school-aged members and several counselors. 
</P>
<P>
Group officials said they plan to use the property only as a gathering place 
and do not plan to sponsor any public events there. 
</P>
<P>
But neighbors, including a plastic molder and a sash and door manufacturer, say 
they fear that the emissions, truck traffic and noise from the area's industry 
would be unsafe for the group. 
</P>
<P>
"An industrial warehouse (with) forklifts and plastic fabrication do give off 
certain emissions," said Ray Steele, owner of S.C. Services, an industrial film 
distribution business that would be next door to the youth ministry group. It 
would be "dangerous moving in and out of their facility while trucks are 
operating." 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission had approved the group's request last month, but 
Councilman Anthony R. Selvaggi appealed its decision to the council. The 
council meets at 7 p.m. in the Council Chambers, 3191 Katella Ave. KATHIE

<TEXT>
<P>
Since moving from Costa Mesa last year, attorney Paul Konapelsky has enjoyed a 
bird's-eye view of Monarch Bay from his hilltop home in the exclusive Bear 
Brand neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
But to Konapelsky's chagrin, his panoramic vista may soon be obscured by a maze 
of commercial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
If a developer has his way, Konapelsky could be staring out his window at the 
tarred rooftop of a strip mall and a multiscreen theater, a two-level parking 
lot, a gas station and a 60-foot tower. 
</P>
<P>
"I moved here to get away from all that," Konapelsky said. 
</P>
<P>
So in a scene that has become increasingly common in fast-growing South County, 
Konapelsky sat down with neighbor Nancy James to plot a way to keep Shea 
Business Properties from putting in the 17-acre shopping center at the 
intersection of Street of the Golden Lantern and Camino del Avion, directly 
across the street from their half-million-dollar homes. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, developers in South County are finding themselves at odds with 
the newly settled residents they wooed to the area with a promise of escaping 
the congestion, crime and pollution of North Orange County and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
And as many areas in South County approach build-out, local residents are 
seeing their quiet lifestyles in these upscale communities threatened by the 
same development they had sought to flee. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going on all over," said Dana Point attorney Darrell Paul, who 
specializes in cases where development plans have threatened to obstruct the 
views of residents. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean views, for instance, can add $50,000 or more to the price of a home, Paul 
said, and homeowners increasingly are willing to put up a fight to protect 
their investment. 
</P>
<P>
"These people need to get downright nasty," Paul said, warning that if rampant 
development is not controlled, the Street of the Golden Lantern may become the 
next "Beach Boulevard South." 
</P>
<P>
"They are spending a lot of money (for homes)," he said. "What they need to do 
is get together and get extremely diligent and aggressive. That's the only way 
they will be able to protect themselves." 
</P>
<P>
One example of aggressive homeowner opposition ended two weeks ago when Los 
Angeles developer Clifford Ratkovich pulled out of a controversial bid to build 
a $55-million resort hotel complex overlooking the San Clemente pier. 
</P>
<P>
Ratkovich met several times with residents, many of whom lived in new 
condominiums and would have lost their ocean view, but he backed out because he 
seemed to face insurmountable odds. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not anti-development," said Evelyn Winkel, a real estate investor and 
head of the group that successfully blocked the project. "(But) we were 
concerned that the project was too large and the Pier Bowl area was going to 
lose its window to the sea." 
</P>
<P>
The argument is similar in Bear Brand, where an additional 600 homes have yet 
to be built. Those homes would also overlook the shopping center, which is 
planned to include a medical building, two restaurants and an office complex in 
addition to the other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Once the shopping center is built, the proposed 50-foot-high theater and 
medical building will block the southern ocean view of many of Bear Brand's 
newer luxury custom homes, some of which cost in the $800,000 range. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Godard, project manager for Shea Business Properties, conceded that the 
shopping center would cause some people to lose the ocean views for which they 
paid dearly. But he argued that the project would benefit, not detract from, 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pretty classy shopping center," Godard said. "It's the kind of thing 
you won't typically find in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Like Ratkovich, Godard said he and other company representatives have already 
attempted to mollify irate residents by meeting with them and discussing their 
objections. 
</P>
<P>
Another meeting with Konapelsky and James is scheduled for Thursday, he said. 
And architects are willing to use some of the residents' suggestions to seek a 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
Godard said developers are becoming more sensitive to residents' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"You will find that you (developers) will no longer be able to walk in (to city 
hall) with your first set of plans and say, 'Let's do it,' " Godard said. "It 
is foolish to work that way." 
</P>
<P>
But Godard's opponents remain wary, despite his promise to listen to their 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
During one meeting, developers literally "wined and dined us and made it all 
nice," said James, a chiropractor who is head of the organization to fight the 
Shea plan. "They thought they could sweet-talk us, but it didn't work. We're 
smarter than that." 
</P>
<P>
Since their first meeting with Shea in December, local residents circulated 
petitions and organized 70 people to attend a Laguna Niguel Planning Commission 
meeting last week. Another public hearing is scheduled by the Planning 
Commission on June 26. 
</P>
<P>
Residents also complained that Shea is seeking a large number of "alternative 
design standards," meaning that the company is seeking permission to forgo 
dozens of height, density and parking restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Rubin, Community Development director, said the project includes so many 
deviations from local building standards that it could be denied, although he 
noted the Planning Commission has not heard all arguments. 
</P>
<P>
"The traffic numbers are going to be absolutely horrendous," Rubin said. "Way 
beyond anything anyone ever imagined." 
</P>
<P>
In a Feb. 22 letter to Godard, Rubin called the project "too much project on 
too little space." 
</P>
<P>
Although Godard said the shopping center would benefit the public by making 
entertainment and services more convenient, residents said they prefer to live 
without it. 
</P>
<P>
"No one moved here to be convenienced," James said. "We moved out here to get 
out of town. We didn't want to live in the hubbub of life." 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in South County, similar conflicts are arising as homeowners take on 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
In Dana Point, a City Council race is taking shape with development as the 
major issue. Several challengers are complaining that the incumbent council has 
allowed county building approvals to go unchallenged and that the city's 
village-like flavor is being threatened by overdevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
In a precedent-setting case, a group of Dana Point residents whose views were 
blocked by a residential project along Del Obispo Street have sued the 
developer, asking for millions of dollars, said attorney Paul.

<P>
Tim Pawsat flew to Rome immediately after the Children's Hospital of Orange 
County tennis tournament final Sunday to play in the Italian Open. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Van't Hof has an exhibition match at La Costa this weekend, a TeamTennis 
promotion in Sacramento the following week, then he's off to England for a 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Someday soon it will be that way for UC Irvine seniors Trevor Kronemann and 
Richard Lubner. Both will turn pro after playing in the NCAA tournament, which 
begins Friday in Indian Wells. 
</P>
<P>
There was no mistaking the pros for the pros-in-waiting Sunday at the John 
Wayne Tennis Club. Pawsat and Van't Hof defeated Kronemann and Lubner, 6-4, 
6-4, winning $1,100 each. 
</P>
<P>
Kronemann wasn't sure what he would have done with the prize money if he and 
Lubner had won. Accepting it would have made them ineligible for the NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"We probably would have left it and had them (tournament officials) give it to 
charity," Kronemann said. "I'm really ready to get out on the pro tour. There 
will be plenty of paydays like that someday." 
</P>
<P>
Until then, Kronemann and Lubner will concentrate on preparing for West 
Virginia, Irvine's first-round opponent Friday. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, Kronemann called Sunday's loss a learning experience. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great to come out and play these guys," he said. "It's a great warm-up 
for the NCAAs." 
</P>
<P>
It was a loss, nevertheless. 
</P>
<P>
Pawsat and Van't Hof served a little better and even managed to slow Kronemann, 
known as much for his girth (6 feet 3, 228 pounds) as for his hard-hit volleys. 
</P>
<P>
Lubner hit his share of blistering shots at Pawsat and Van't Hof, but never 
seemed to get the same crowd reaction that Kronemann received on his powerful 
winners.

<P>
Perhaps it is his size, but Kronemann always seems to capture the fans' fancy 
wherever he plays. 
</P>
<P>
Two key service breaks helped Pawsat and Van't Hof overcome Kronemann and 
Lubner. 
</P>
<P>
The first break gave them a 5-4 lead in the first set. Van't Hof then held 
serve to win the set. The second gave them a 4-3 lead in the second set. 
</P>
<P>
Van't Hof then held serve again, but it wasn't easy. The game went to deuce six 
times before Pawsat and Van't Hof won. 
</P>
<P>
"If we lose that game we might lose the match," Van't Hof said. "We really had 
to dig down." 
</P>
<P>
Pawsat held serve and the old guard held on for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy May Paben and Stephanie Rehe won the women's final, 6-1, 6-4, over 
Barbara Lemberg and Sandy Collins. 
</P>
<P>
For Paben and Rehe, the final was a breeze compared to their hard-fought 6-3, 
6-7, 6-3 victory over Linda Howell and Cynthia MacGregor in the semifinals 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Dunk and Sandy Collins won the mixed doubles title, 7-5, 6-7, 6-1, over 
Phil and Betty Ann Dent.

ANGELS: CATCHER RESPONDS TO BLYLEVEN'S CRITICISM WITH THREE HITS, INCLUDING A 
HOME RUN AND THREE RUNS BATTED IN.

<P>
Although no one admitted it, Bert Blyleven's motivational tactics apparently 
hit home with Angel catcher Lance Parrish. 
</P>
<P>
Parrish broke out of a three-for-23 slump Sunday, going three for four with a 
home run in the Angels' 8-4 victory over the Boston Red Sox at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Parrish's outburst -- which included a solo homer in the eighth inning, three 
runs batted in and two runs scored -- followed some curt comments by Blyleven 
after Saturday night's 7-1 loss to the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
To put it bluntly, the Angel pitcher said the team's offense "stinks." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't the most constructive criticism Parrish has heard, but it appeared to 
be effective. He and his teammates tagged four Boston pitchers for 12 hits, 
tying a season high. 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of what's been said, I think our offense is coming around and being 
aggressive," Parrish said. "I don't care to comment on Bert's comments. It has 
been said. It's over and done with. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been frustrating for everyone. But we sat down as a family, and as a 
team, and aired it out." 
</P>
<P>
The Angel players and coaches met for 40 minutes before Sunday's game to 
discuss Blyleven's comments -- and the offense. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the meeting had a lot to do with it," said right fielder Dante 
Bichette, who was one for four Sunday. "I didn't read Bert's comments but I 
heard about them at the meeting. It wasn't a big deal to me. I understand that 
sometimes people get frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
"Bert knows how to win and I think he saw some things that winning teams don't 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven watched Sunday as the Angel hitters made a winner of starter Chuck 
Finley (5-2). Finley gave up eight hits and four runs before being relieved by 
Bryan Harvey with one out in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
"Chuck has more or less been our stopper this year," Parrish said. "I have a 
lot of confidence in him. If anyone is capable of turning this around, he is. 
</P>
<P>
"We (the hitters) had to give him some support, though, and it's nice to be 
able to do that." 
</P>
<P>
That hasn't always been the case. While the bottom of the batting order has 
failed to hit, the Angels have flirted with last place in the American League 
West. 
</P>
<P>
Just look at the averages entering Sunday's game: 
</P>
<P>
Parrish, who bats eighth, was hitting .228 with four homers and nine RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Howell, the No. 9 hitter, was in a one-for-26 slump. 
</P>
<P>
Devon White, who moved from the leadoff position to the lower third of the 
order, was batting .189 and had stolen only one base since April 14. 
</P>
<P>
But Sunday, Howell was two for four, including a single that scored Wally 
Joyner and Johnny Ray in the sixth and gave the Angels a 5-3 lead. White walked 
twice and scored a run. 
</P>
<P>
Besides his homer, Parrish doubled off the center-field wall in the second to 
score Joyner and White. Parrish also singled and scored on a base hit by Donnie 
Hill in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
The offensive outburst was timely, Parrish said. They begin an eight-game road 
trip Tuesday night at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
"My experience in the past is that one game like this can make a big difference 
in the emotional outlook for a club," Parrish said. "We have been on a serious 
low, and this might fire us up a little bit. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at today and see that we're capable of swinging the bat aggressively 
and getting the clutch hits. And that's an important thing for a team to take 
with it on the road." 
</P>
<P>
Parrish's homer was his first at Anaheim Stadium since April 14. Opposing 
outfielders have robbed him of four homers in the last two weeks with catches 
at the wall. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Parrish was hesitant to start his home-run trot Sunday when he 
knocked Wes Gardner's pitch deep into right field. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking to see where the outfielders were when I hit it," Parrish said. 
"All I could do was make solid contact. I can't do anything about it, whether 
it goes over the fence or they catch it. I have to take the same frame of mind 
up there each time. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt unfortunate about the way things turned out in the last week, but I 
know they (the outfielders) can't catch them all."

<P>
The Cal State Fullerton softball team received an at-large bid to the NCAA 
tournament and will play host to Cal State Long Beach in a best-of-three series 
this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans (44-21) and 49ers (45-16) will play on Friday at 7:30 p.m. and on 
Saturday at 1 p.m. If necessary, the third game will follow the second on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The series winner advances to the College World Series, May 23-27 at Oklahoma 
City. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, ranked fifth in the nation, and fourth-ranked Long Beach have met 
five times this season, with the 49ers winning four. But all five games were 
decided by one run, and two went into extra innings. Long Beach finished second 
to Fresno State in the Big West Conference, and Fullerton finished third. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans, who lost to Cal Poly Pomona in a 1989 regional, are led by 
sophomore pitcher Ann Van Dortrecht, who is 28-10 with a conference-leading 
0.44 earned-run average and 211 strikeouts. The 49ers will counter with 
freshman pitcher Mary Letourneau. 
</P>
<P>
Offensively, Fullerton is led by third baseman Joy Tiner (.313, 10 doubles, 15 
RBIs), center fielder Mich DeBree (.291) and shortstop Charlotte Wiley (.290). 
</P>
<P>
The Titans and 49ers are two of 20 teams selected to play in eight regionals 
across the country. Four are two-team regionals, and four are three-team 
regionals, and the winner of each will advance to the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining NCAA pairings: Northern Iowa at UCLA; Oregon, Kent State at Ohio 
State; Nevada Las Vegas, San Jose State at California; Arizona State at 
Arizona; Oklahoma State, Adelphi at Connecticut; Texas A&amp;M, Florida State 
at Southwest Louisiana; Creighton at Fresno State. MIKE DiGIOVANNA

FIRST PERSON: HE'S PERFECTLY AT HOME WITH FAMILY ROLE-REVERSALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY GAROFALO, Garofalo is an Emmy-winning writer and producer of the 
People's Court television program. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a recent visit to New York and my Italian family, an aunt read us a 
newspaper item about a man in a small Sicilian village whose wife was not ready 
with supper when he arrived from work. 
</P>
<P>
A bit of a hothead, the man took out a pistol and shot her. "What kind of a 
person would do that?" my aunt wondered aloud, looking incredulous. "Supper 
time and no food on the table!" 
</P>
<P>
Growing up as a first-generation Italian-American, I knew the mealtime ritual. 
At the sound of my father's truck rolling down the driveway, my mother and 
sisters promptly spooned the food onto plates and, moments later, supper was in 
place. Tardiness, fortunately, was not my mother's fatal flaw. 
</P>
<P>
If a person's view of the opposite sex is based on role models from childhood, 
what I saw was what I definitely didn't get when I married. My coming home from 
work to the homey clatter of spoons and plates can only mean one thing: I'm in 
the wrong house. The majority of our meals are eaten out. On that rare occasion 
when Ellyn feels particularly domestic, we take food home. 
</P>
<P>
My mother was one of the first women in our ethnic community to drive an 
automobile. But I never knew my father to let her take the wheel while he was 
in the car -- no matter how long the trip or how fatigued he was. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, when we're out together, Ellyn always drives. And it's fine 
with me. At first I thought my attitude was appropriately New Age. But when we 
pull out of our driveway, the other husbands on the block look up from their 
power tools with suspicion at this role rearrangement. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Ellyn and I, and Kirk Douglas and his wife Ann, were out shopping -- 
separately -- at the trendy Hollywood clothes emporium, Fred Segal. As the 
rugged screen star and his wife drove off to wherever it is movie stars go, I 
noticed Ann Douglas was behind the wheel and Kirk was in the passenger seat. 
(So why couldn't he be one of my neighbors?) 
</P>
<P>
While role-reversing seems to be coming into vogue, it's always been alive and 
well at our place. I pitched in when our sons Alex and Andrew were born, long 
before the "thirtysomething" set invented parenting and long before it became 
OK for fathers to do more than bring home baseball gloves and football helmets. 
</P>
<P>
When Ellyn and her friends had babies, some of the husbands would dress but not 
bathe them. Some would bathe them but wouldn't change diapers. Others would 
bathe and change, but "number one" only. I believe I did everything but 
breast-feed. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers assure us that women are superior in English, while we hunks excel 
in math and things mechanical. I shudder at the mere mention of those "m" 
words. I've yet to hit on that easy-to-assemble item that has been easy enough 
for me to assemble. 
</P>
<P>
Ellyn loves telling people how once, when we needed a hammer, I looked for one 
under "H" in the Yellow Pages. (Personally, I think some things should stay 
within the family.) From our earliest Christmases, my wife has been the one 
connecting screw "A" to bolt "B" as she assembled Santa's toys, while I 
Windexed and Pledged my heart out. Ellyn has always known how things worked. 
She'd rather curl up with an instruction manual than a Jackie Collins novel. 
(I'm entering year nine of attempting to master the art of setting the VCR's 
programmable timer.) 
</P>
<P>
Dad as the mechanical blockhead is painfully evident when it comes to our car 
and anything that doesn't have to do with the steering of it. Enter Ellyn. 
Loudly. "They still didn't fix that car. You get on the phone and yell at them! 
They won't listen to a woman!" She's right. Car mechanics appear to be among 
the last males to recognize role crossover. 
</P>
<P>
Ellyn usually gets nowhere with them, even though she knows more than I do, and 
sometimes more than they do, about rings, valves and gaskets. So I get on the 
phone. And I yell at them. And they listen. 
</P>
<P>
While Ellyn has helped put our boys through private schools with her 
interior-design work, I have been the primary wage earner. But all that could 
change. She has just completed her first year of law school. 
</P>
<P>
Although I was warned a major lifestyle adjustment was coming, things changed 
abruptly around our house. I am in the throes of two more years of getting no 
supper, no housework and no sex. Though, if the truth be known, only the first 
two denials are a shock to my system. 
</P>
<P>
I focus on the carrot at the end of the stick. In a few short years, Ellyn will 
not only be pulling her share of the load, she may very well be earning more 
than I do. That works for me. I don't expect this will spell my emasculation. 
</P>
<P>
This past weekend, we decided to take a ride out to Pepperdine University Law 
School in Malibu. As Ellyn chauffeured us out of our driveway, I felt several 
sets of eyes looking on disdainfully. I remembered the Douglases. Was there 
ever a more macho movie persona than Kirk? Would Spartacus have let Mrs. 
Spartacus take the reins of the chariot while he sat passively, seat-belted in 
the passenger seat? Ten drachmas says no. 
</P>
<P>
It must be that Kirk Douglas and I are secure enough to just sit back and let 
it happen.

DAILY SERVICE UPDATES BATTLE ON ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SHAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doug Bailey has two masters degrees, a Ph.D. in international relations and 22 
years' experience as a high-powered political consultant, so no one had to hit 
him over the head with a ballot box when the U.S. Supreme Court issued its 
controversial Webster ruling last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey knew right away that the court's decision giving states greater latitude 
in regulating abortion would generate enormous political controversy -- and, 
not incidentally, provide him with a unique opportunity to expand his newest 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Less than two years earlier, Bailey had created the "Presidential Campaign 
Hotline," a daily, 20-page compendium of excerpts from campaign stories and 
polls published and broadcast that day in major media throughout the country. 
Reporters whose news organizations subscribed to the hot line could gain 
instant access to it with computers or fax machines, and soon after its 
September 1987 debut, Hotline became a uniquely influential echo chamber during 
the 1988 presidential primaries. 
</P>
<P>
Hotline is still published as a daily political briefing for journalists and 
politicians, and with the heat turned up on abortion, Bailey figured he had a 
similarly apt -- and rapt -- "need-to-know" audience for news on that front. 
</P>
<P>
He could package stories on state legislative battles over abortion, political 
campaigns in which abortion was a major issue, polls on abortion and news of 
various other abortion-related developments and use the same distribution 
network to send a daily "Abortion Report" to journalists, politicians, 
activists on both sides of the abortion battle and other interested parties. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey pitched his idea to several organizations active in the campaign for 
abortion rights, among them the American Civil Liberties Union, Planned 
Parenthood, the National Abortion Rights Action League and the National 
Organization for Women. These groups had formed a loose coalition of sorts -- 
the Pro-Choice Media Strategies Group -- and Bailey asked if they would provide 
the seed money to help finance start-up of the Abortion Report. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the organizations agreed to provide, collectively, about $4,000 a 
month for six months, and on July 19, the first issue of the Abortion Report 
was published. It's been published Monday through Friday morning since then. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey was a longtime political consultant for national Republican candidates, 
including former President Gerald Ford. Since 1980, the Republican Party 
platform has called for a constitutional amendment prohibiting abortion, but 
Bailey, the 56-year-old father of two, describes himself as "absolutely 
pro-choice" on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
He says that is not, however, why he sought his seed money from abortion rights 
advocates. 
</P>
<P>
"There aren't many large organizations with substantial dollars on the other 
(anti-abortion) side, and they're not as organized in a coalition sense as the 
pro-choice side," he says. 
</P>
<P>
But Bailey says he told his original backers that the Abortion Report would 
only have the credibility necessary to its success if it were "steered 
absolutely down the middle," with no favoritism shown to either side in the 
volatile debate. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, neither Nancy Myers, communications directors for the National 
Right to Life Committee, nor Loretta Ucelli, communications director for the 
National Abortion Rights Action League, both based in Washington, knew that 
abortion rights activists had been the source of the original money for the 
Abortion Report until told this week by a Times reporter. But both Myers and 
Ucelli agree that the Report has largely achieved the evenhandedness Bailey 
said was essential. 
</P>
<P>
They note that the Abortion Report is one of the few publications that 
describes each side by its chosen designation -- pro-choice and pro-life. In 
fact, some of Bailey's original backers in the abortion rights movement have 
criticized him for using that language; they think it gives their opponents a 
rhetorical edge. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey was also criticized -- by both sides -- when early issues of the 
Abortion Report included what he calls "analysis on what was important and why" 
in the ongoing political scrimmaging over abortion. Bailey uses analysis and 
commentary to good effect in the Hotline, but the abortion issue is so 
emotional, he says, that "whatever we said seemed to irk people on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
"We concluded that they didn't need our analysis." 
</P>
<P>
Subscribers say they use the Abortion Report to monitor both political activity 
on abortion and media coverage of that activity, especially in newspapers they 
don't regularly see. 
</P>
<P>
"It helps our political people gauge how elections are going in a certain state 
and how the abortion issue is playing in elections," Myers says. "We clip the 
New York Times and the Washington Post, but we don't see a lot of the other 
major regional papers. The Abortion Report helps us keep up with what they're 
saying." 
</P>
<P>
Ucelli calls Bailey's electronic clipping service "a daily status report on the 
issue," and she said NARAL eagerly participates in the Report by regularly 
faxing its statements and press releases to the Report staff. 
</P>
<P>
The staff of 12 that produces both Hotline and the Abortion Report operates out 
of Bailey's American Political Network office in Falls Church, Va., just 
outside Washington. They begin work at 5 o'clock every morning, Sunday through 
Friday, on Hotline. Two hours later, several turn their attention to the 
Abortion Report. The work consists of a fast-paced, often frenzied reading, 
watching and clipping of material from the staff's daily monitoring of 
newspaper and network television coverage and from information that 
subscribers, activists and political and media junkies submit by computer, fax 
and overnight mail. 
</P>
<P>
At 11 a.m., the final writing process begins on that day's Abortion Report. At 
1 p.m., the Report is ready for its subscribers. Then work begins anew for the 
next day's Report. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a constant process, six days a week," says Valerie Syme, 25, editor of 
the Report. 
</P>
<P>
Syme and one other staff member work full-time on the Abortion Report, and on 
any given day, five or six Hotline staffers work with them. There is an 
inevitable overlap in material, as well as in staff, between Hotline and the 
Abortion Report, but the overlap in material is generally limited to 25% as a 
matter of policy. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent, typical day, the Abortion Report's 10 single-spaced pages 
included, among other items, excerpts from: 
</P>
<P>
* A Baltimore Sun story about abortion rights advocates campaigning against 
three state senators in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
* A Denver Post story on a county Republican group passing a "protection of 
human life resolution." 
</P>
<P>
* An Illinois poll on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
* A syndicated column on the Catholic bishops' decision to hire a public 
relations firm to help in their anti-abortion campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The Abortion Report has "in the neighborhood of 30 subscribers," about half of 
whom are in the media, Bailey says. (Hotline has about 300 subscribers, about 
40 or 50 of them in the media, he says.) Subscribers pay $200 to $600 a month 
for the Report, depending on the size of the organization and the use it makes 
of the material. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey says -- not altogether convincingly -- that the sharing of costs and 
overhead with Hotline enables him to consider the Abortion Report a financial 
success, but he doesn't necessarily regard it as a long-term business venture 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"Abortion is a specific subject that is very highly relevant in a political 
context for a very short period of time," he says. "It's entirely possible that 
the 1990 elections will be so decisive on the subject that at least for the 
time being, interest and need for such a publication will greatly diminish." 
</P>
<P>
If the elections are decisive, in what direction does Bailey think those 
decisions will be made? 
</P>
<P>
"If it is decisive," he says with the certitude so characteristic of 
experienced political consultants, "it will be decisive on the pro-choice side 
of the issue. If there are going to be campaigns waged on this issue alone, my 
instinct is that in most, if not all election districts and states, the 
pro-choice side of the moral issue has the edge in the polls." 
</P>
<P>
But for all his certainty, Bailey has been in politics long enough to know that 
the first rule of political prognostication is what might be called the Rudyard 
Kipling rule -- the biggest word in the political vocabulary is if. 
</P>
<P>
"There are all kinds of 'ifs,' " Bailey says, ticking off a few of them: "If 
the issue is a pro-choice candidate vs. a pro-life candidate, and if the 
pro-choice people are able to define the language of the debate . . . and if 
the pro-choice side . . . which has a demonstrable majority in most 
constituencies in the country . . . is capable of summoning that majority, and 
if . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Abortion opponents vigorously reject any suggestion that supporters of abortion 
rights are a majority -- politically, morally or in any other way -- but 
abortion could decline as a major political issue whichever side comes out 
ahead at the polls or even, ultimately, if there is no clear winner. What would 
that mean to the Abortion Report? 
</P>
<P>
"When it is not as hot a subject, obviously we will have to look at the 
economic viability of the project," Bailey says, sounding like the bottom-line 
businessman he also is. 
</P>
<P>
But if events do abort the Abortion Report, Bailey has another idea or two up 
his political/journalistic sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
"There are other areas where it seems to us there might be a need-to-know 
audience for a 24-hour news service that can report on news around the country 
and put it through some sort of expert filter," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Such as? 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the environment." 
</P>
<P>
What else? 
</P>
<P>
He smiles. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing I'm willing to talk about right now."

CONSERVATION: GERARD MCKAY WILL HELP DECIDE WHO GETS MORE OR LESS IF L.A. 
RATIONS WATER.

Gerard B. McKay planned to spend part of the weekend moving out of his Van Nuys 
office. That's because over the next few months he will probably be moving into 
the lives of untold numbers of Los Angeles residents. 
</P>
<P>
In McKay's case, weather and ambition have combined to raise the quiet-spoken, 
low-key, optimistic 43-year-old from safe obscurity to what could be an 
incandescent spot on the parched Southern California landscape. 
</P>
<P>
As the city girds for the drought war of 1990, McKay has been chosen by the 
Department of Water and Power to head a sort of court of appeals on water use. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely more high-profile than any job I've had in the past," McKay 
said, noting he was warned in job interviews that the position could make him a 
public target. "But it comes with the territory. My concern is not going to be 
the profile but implementing and doing the job and if that comes with it, so be 
it . . . I'm going into this job with my eyes wide open." 
</P>
<P>
McKay, a career civil servant, formally holds the new title of water 
conservation control group coordinator. For the average Los Angeles resident, 
that means McKay could become an abominable "no" man if the City Council 
approves Mayor Bradley's proposal for water conservation. The mayor wants the 
city to reduce by 10% the amount of water consumed from predrought 1986 levels. 
</P>
<P>
Approval of Bradley's plan seems all but certain. At least 13 of 15 city 
council members have said they support the proposal. Last week, a key city 
council committee endorsed the proposal, made as the region faces a possible 
fifth straight year of drought in 1991. In fact, city officials and mayoral 
aides have said worry over next year's water supply prompted the rationing 
plan, more than fears of shortages this summer. 
</P>
<P>
In his new position, McKay will head a group that decides if water customers 
will be granted an "adjustment" from these water-use restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
McKay, previously manager of DWP's 15 branch offices, doesn't see himself as a 
Draconian bureaucrat. In an interview, he repeatedly stressed that DWP will 
work with customers on determining their water allotments. He also shied away 
from the word rationing, prefering the term reduction. 
</P>
<P>
"No. 1, I don't expect to be unpopular (in my new job). I feel I'm doing a 
service," McKay said at the end of a day spent scouting office locations for 
his new command. "Our goal and our purpose is not to punish the customer. Our 
goal is to work with them." 
</P>
<P>
A native of St. Louis, McKay's family moved here when he was 11. He began work 
at DWP 19 years ago as a temporary employee and moved into management ranks 
four years ago. Perhaps tellingly, he has a degree in political science from 
Cal State L.A. 
</P>
<P>
"We are there to hear the appeals on the unique situations from customers who 
for whatever reason have some type of situation they feel should give them an 
adjustment," he explained. "The bottom line is we're looking to see what your 
unique situation is. Probably the most common (reason for an appeal) will be 
that you don't live where you did in 1986 . . .Are there more children, more 
members of the household? Has there been a swimming pool added? Has there been 
additional landscaping? . . . Once we've got that (information) we can make the 
appropriate adjustment." 
</P>
<P>
As envisioned by McKay, customers seeking an exemption will receive a form to 
state the reasons for their appeal; that form will be processed by his staff. 
</P>
<P>
Exemptions will also be granted to employers if cuts would result in 
unemployment or if employment or output has gone up at a business facility. 
</P>
<P>
And McKay emphasized that he's in the same boat as everybody else. " . . . I'm 
a citizen rate-payer of Los Angeles and I'm subject to this as well." He noted 
that he, his wife and two children have begun taking steps to conserve water in 
their own home. 
</P>
<P>
Mixing authority with diplomacy, McKay added, "I don't want to say, every one 
come line up and get your adjustment. But if you have reasonable requests that 
can be verified by us without any major problem, we're there to do that. We're 
not there to make it harsh on any individual, organization or area." 
</P>
<P>
McKay's group is part of a two-pronged strategy by the department to combat the 
drought. A so-called "drought buster" program, headed by another DWP manager, 
will have department employees scouring the city for violations such as hosing 
off sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
But McKay stressed that most violators will have little to fear from the city's 
water police: "If (customers are) hosing off the sidewalk, they'll inform them 
that it is a violation. They'll work with them, give them conservation tips, 
and hopefully that will resolve the situation." 
</P>
<P>
McKay's apparently ingrained optimism makes him see proposed cutbacks as an 
opportunity rather than a dreaded modification of the Southern California 
lifestyle. "We don't know what will happen in the following year or years, so 
isn't it better now to take steps to conserve our water supplies so that we 
don't have to go into more severe remedies?" 
</P>
<P>
When the rationing proposal was announced earlier this month, officials said 
customers should seek an exemption only after they exceed their allotments. 
</P>
<P>
But McKay senses that adoption of the rationing ordinance will leave some 
people as itchy as a week without a shower: "We'll probably be getting appeals 
from customers before they even have received their first bill." 
</P>
<P>
McKay found another bright side in the city's last confrontation with a water 
shortage in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Then, he said, 88% of the department's customers reduced their water use 
without resorting to an appeal. In 1977-78, McKay said some 73,000 residential 
customers appealed for exemptions. This time around, city water officials 
predict that about 100,000 of 650,000 customers will seek exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
Under Bradley's proposed plan, customers who do not reduce water use by 10% or 
do not receive an exemption will get stiff fines in the form of surcharges to 
their water bills. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps predictably, McKay thinks most customers will have a relatively easy 
time cutting water use -- and that most will be cooperate with DWP. "My view 
and past experience is that most customers understand that we have a drought," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Water customers who have installed low-flow shower heads and adopted other 
measures advocated by the department over the last couple of years may already 
have achieved substantial reductions, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people have probably gotten a big head start and don't even know it 
because if they've employed those measures, they're already well on their way 
to reduction," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to McKay, the average Los Angeles residential water customer uses 18 
"billing units" -- each equaling about 748 gallons -- of water per month. When 
the water ordinance is enacted, customers' bills will tell them the amount of 
water they're allowed to use. 
</P>
<P>
Some customers, McKay conceded, will be shocked by the information. 
</P>
<P>
"Many customers when they look at (it) will say 'Can I do that? What we 
encourage is that they start attempting right there to conserve and see how 
they do," he said. "Now, when the next bill comes along, compare that and see 
what you actually used and if there's a problem or it looks like a need for an 
appeal, then contact us." 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, however, all of this is ahead of the game. 
</P>
<P>
McKay has not decided where to locate his group and has not hired or drafted a 
single staff member, although the plans call for him to employ 25 people. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he learned that he had gotten the job, which he described as "a major 
promotion," only last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, McKay said he had been wracked by self-doubt over his performance 
in interviews for the slot. On the other hand, his family was a faithful 
cheering section. 
</P>
<P>
"You have your doubts, reliving that interview process over and over and over 
and wondering if you handled it right," he recalled. His family, was "more 
confident than I was. They were pleased. They don't look forward to the long 
hours but they understand."

ART MUSEUMS GROWING LEERY OF LOANS; 
</P>
<P>
AUCTIONS: COLLECTORS ARE PUTTING ON THE BLOCK PRICEY WORKS THAT WERE INTENDED 
TO BE GIFTS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Artworks from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 
the Art Institute of Chicago and the Southwest Museum in Los Angeles are up for 
grabs in May auctions. In most cases, the works belong to financially strapped 
museums that are selling assets to raise funds for other acquisitions, but two 
paintings from the Met are different. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent van Gogh's "Portrait of Dr. Gachet" and Rembrandt van Rijn's "St. Peter 
in Prison" are long-term loans that the museum hoped would be donated by 
private collectors. 
</P>
<P>
The Van Gogh portrait, valued at $40 million to $50 million, is the star 
attraction of a sale of Impressionist and modern art on Tuesday at Christie's 
New York. The Rembrandt, expected to bring between $10 million and $15 million, 
is the top lot in Christie's May 31 auction of Old Master paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Another Van Gogh, "The Bridge at Trinquetaille," was loaned to the Met for 
three years before its 1987 sale for $20.3 million at Christie's London. Both 
Van Goghs were the property of the late Siegfried Kramarsky, a New York banker 
and philanthropist whose daughter, Sonja Kramarsky, consigned the paintings to 
auction. The Rembrandt is being sold by Joel Friedland, a Miami real estate 
developer. 
</P>
<P>
Many intended gifts to museums have turned up at auction over the years, but 
such sales are causing increasing concern as escalating prices entice borrowed 
crown jewels onto the auction block. The most highly publicized case was the 
Frick Museum's loss of "Portrait of Cosimo I de' Medici" by Jacobo Pontormo, a 
16th-Century masterpiece that had been on view there for nearly 20 years. The 
Pontormo might have disappeared into a private collection if the J. Paul Getty 
Museum hadn't bought it last June for $35.2 million at Christie's New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Getty also rescued Van Gogh's "Irises," which had been on long-term loan to 
Westbrook College in Portland, Me. before Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond 
bought it in 1987 for a record $53.9 million in a controversial sale, highly 
leveraged by Sotheby's auction house. When Bond's financial empire tumbled and 
he was unable to pay off a $27-million loan from Sotheby's, he put the painting 
back on the market. 
</P>
<P>
Shock waves from such multimillion-dollar sales now ripple around the Met, as 
two more loans to that institution go on the block this month. But John Ross, 
the museum's press officer, insisted that there is no cause for alarm. The Met 
only accepts loans from people with whom it has long-standing relationships, 
generally those who have been generous donors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Loans make up "a tiny proportion" of artworks in the museum's galleries that 
are devoted to its permanent collection -- "scores among hundreds of thousands, 
though they include some very fine things," Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Met's galleries of paintings include at least one loan, however. 
Works by such important figures as Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Sir Joshua 
Reynolds, George Romney and Hendrick Goltzius bear labels saying they were 
"lent anonymously." So does Rembrandt's "Rape of Europa," a small 1632 painting 
identified by the museum as one of the artist's first mythological pictures and 
one of his most important landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
In the heavily trafficked great hall of 19th-Century paintings, featuring the 
Met's Impressionist treasures, anonymous loans include one of seven Van Goghs 
on view in a central display. The painting of a well-worn pair of men's shoes 
may not have the popular appeal of "Irises" or "Portrait of Dr. Gachet," but it 
was executed in 1888, in Van Gogh's mature style and most highly prized period. 
Also on anonymous loan is "Scene of Fantasy or the Fisherman," an 1873 painting 
by Paul Cezanne that the museum has labeled "one of the most important genre 
paintings of Cezanne's early maturity." 
</P>
<P>
Will these paintings leave the Met and turn up in future auction catalogues? 
Only time will tell, but the economic climate is not favorable for museums. At 
the same time as art prices shot up into the millions, the 1986 income tax law 
made it more difficult for collectors in the top tax bracket to deduct the 
appreciated value of donated artworks. As a result, donations have plummeted. 
</P>
<P>
Loans from private collectors are only one small part of an equation that 
continues to diminish museums' power to collect art, but the termination of 
long-term loans can be devastating. Does this mean that museums are rethinking 
their loan policies? 
</P>
<P>
"We have always been conservative, but we are more leery of loans now because 
of the tax laws and the market. We do not want to enhance a work of art to the 
benefit of a collector," said Ruth Kaplan, press officer at the National 
Gallery in Washington. The gallery has about two dozen loaned works on display 
among its 5,000-piece collection, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Museum of Modern Art has an even tighter policy. "We don't accept loans," 
said Kirk Varnedoe, director of the department of painting and sculpture at the 
Museum of Modern Art. "The works in our permanent collections galleries that 
came from private collections are outright gifts or, on occasion, promised 
gifts" -- that is, artworks that have been irrevocably promised to the museum. 
</P>
<P>
MOMA's no-loan policy has been in place since the '60s, but Varnedoe doesn't 
see other museums moving closer to that approach. "In a complex way, I think 
movement may be in the opposite direction. . . . As prices go higher and 
collectors have less incentive to give, museums may be pressured to flesh out 
their collections with loans in hope that they will become gifts. There's a 
saying that if you put enough pictures on the wall, some of them will stick," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
But spokesmen from some other museums indicated that if policy changes are in 
the wind, they are blowing toward caution. 
</P>
<P>
The days are long gone when private collections were farmed out to the nation's 
top museums for the summer and picked up in the fall, according to Earl A. 
Powell, director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. While small, 
impoverished institutions may welcome loans under any conditions and most 
museums borrow works for temporary exhibitions, major museums generally 
restrict their permanent collection galleries to works they own or expect to 
receive as gifts. 
</P>
<P>
"If you rely on a work by painter X and you do not pursue other examples by 
painter X, you may not be able to replace that painting if it is removed," 
Varnedoe said. That situation can arise even with a no-loan policy, as MOMA 
recently discovered when heirs of photographer Edward Steichen sued the museum 
for the return of a Matisse painting that Steichen's daughter, Charlotte Kate 
Rodina Steichen, willed to the museum in 1973 but later bequeathed to her 
grandniece, Ariana Rodina Calderone Stahmer. When expected gifts are retracted, 
museums not only lose the art and the opportunity to buy a replacement, they 
forfeit any money they have spent on insurance, conservation and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
The most serious case at the County Museum of Art was Armand Hammer's decision 
to withdraw his collections and build his own museum -- a project that is 
currently threatened by lawsuits by shareholders of Occidental Petroleum, which 
has borne much of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
A 1989 auction of the Hal B. Wallis collection deprived LACMA of another 
collection it had hoped to own. The collection of Impressionist paintings was 
on "permanent loan," but the museum thought it had no legal grounds to object 
when the late producer's son, Brent Wallis, decided to sell the works to 
benefit a charitable foundation. Later discovering a letter of instructions 
from Hal B. Wallis ordering that the paintings be kept permanently at the 
museum or at some other publicly owned facility, the museum sued the 
foundation. The case has not been settled. 
</P>
<P>
Powell said that the County Museum of Art has no plans to change its policy, 
but it has become more conservative over time. "We have sent back most of the 
loans that we were just paying insurance on. We do accept loans now, but we 
generally ask for some sort of commitment and we try to make them promised 
gifts," he said.

R&amp;B SINGERS DRAW ON GOSPEL ROOTS FOR EMOTIONAL INTENSITY 
</P>

<P>
What the playground is to a pro basketball player, the church is to top-flight 
R&amp;B singers. It's where you begin if you want to play in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Miki Howard and David Peaston are among the finest pop-R&amp;B singers of 
recent vintage, and it's no accident that they both began by singing in gospel 
choirs. The whole purpose of religious music is to convey an inner experience 
of ardor and passion. On stage at the Celebrity Theatre Saturday night, Howard 
and Peaston both showed that they learned their early lessons well enough to 
carry that fervor over to songs of romantic love. 
</P>
<P>
Howard, originally from Chicago, was a convincing romantic tragedian. After a 
slow beginning, her hourlong headlining set began to smolder with a streak of 
songs in which Howard cast herself as the lover spurned or ignored. 
</P>
<P>
On "Baby, Be Mine," Howard, elegant in a white suit, reached back to the church 
and turned the song into a keening prayer for romantic salvation. The dramatic 
set-piece ended with steamy uplift when one of Howard's backing musicians 
joined her for a duet that answered her rising pleas with promises of physical 
consolation. 
</P>
<P>
Howard kept the mood torchy and blue through a medley of blues and soul songs 
drawn from a series of precursors -- Billie Holiday, Dinah Washington, Lena 
Horne and Aretha Franklin. The segment took on a bit of an archival cast, 
however, instead of emphasizing the timelessness of songs like "Stormy 
Weather." The segment ended with Howard's three backing singers crooning "Let's 
go back to the blues," lending it a false Vegas touch. 
</P>
<P>
Howard quickly made up for that lapse with the deep-blue, late-night saloon 
singing of "You've Changed," which came across with an immediacy that belied 
any notion that older material belongs on a museum shelf. After that long 
stretch of romantic woe, Howard tried to finish on an uplift. She undercut 
herself by summoning dozens of fans to the stage during "Until You Come Back to 
Me (That's What I'm Gonna Do)," a Stevie Wonder song previously done by Aretha 
Franklin. The crowd surrounding Howard made for a festive mood on stage but 
left everyone else in the house feeling like an uninvited onlooker at a wedding 
party. Howard got the energy level back for her finale, "Love Under New 
Management." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the show, Howard displayed her gospel-influenced ability to build 
passion by repeating phrases and stretching syllables over a multitude of 
notes. These fiery displays didn't stray from the point of the songs and, 
therefore, never came off as mere show. 
</P>
<P>
Peaston was far more inclined to grandstand than Howard. But even if he 
repeated his showiest vocal maneuvers too often, listening to this large, round 
mound of soul sound was still a treat (even amid some terrible sound 
distortion). 
</P>
<P>
From Eddie Kendricks to Philip Bailey, most top R&amp;B tenors have sung with a 
smooth, creamy tone. What makes Peaston distinctive is the bite in his 
falsetto. He was able to sound thick and raspy even in his upper register -- a 
knack that gave his singing exceptional body and vibrancy. 
</P>
<P>
Peaston performed with a palpable warmth and sense of delight, arms waving and 
eyes popping. He used his bulk to his advantage. Occasionally, he would make a 
quip about it. More often he would just shake it. When a big man mambos -- as 
the large Orange County blues singer Robert Lucas puts it in one of his songs 
-- people pay attention. Peaston showed he could mambo with the best of them. 
</P>
<P>
Peaston's 65-minute show began with a false step into Vegas slickness, as his 
trio of backup singers crooned snippets of his songs as reverentially as if 
they were holy writ. But things soon were on track as Peaston moved from 
effective funk to a swinging, R&amp;B version of "God Bless the Child" to some 
well-executed straight blues. 
</P>
<P>
It was encouraging to hear Howard and Peaston both drawing upon Billie 
Holiday's legacy and doubly encouraging to hear both of them dip into the 
straight, traditional blues. R&amp;B has largely discarded the "B" since disco 
and techno-funk arrived about 15 years ago, and that neglect has cost it an 
inexhaustible wellspring for passion and character. It was nice to hear 
successful, contemporary pop-soul practitioners putting it back in the mix. 
</P>
<P>
Troop, a singing and dancing ensemble of five youngsters from Pasadena, opened 
with a lightweight but energetic set of techno-funk. They combined hip-hop 
dance athletics with good vocal craftsmanship. But the backing vocals sounded 
suspiciously robust during some of the more heated dance maneuvers, when mere 
mortals would more likely be panting for breath than singing in perfect, 
swelling harmony. The guys in Troop may be cardiovascular wonders -- or they 
may have been cheating by lip-syncing some of their parts to a tape. Only their 
sound engineer knows for sure. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that in the MTV age, not only is it hard to tell whether a 
performance is real or Memorex, but slipping ethics among video wonders like 
Janet Jackson and Milli Vanilli have made it common for so-called "live" acts 
to slide by on a prerecorded crutch. If Troop stands unjustly accused here, 
it's because the shoddy standards of others render today's dance-popsters as 
ethically suspect as politicians. 
</P>
<P>
Singers like Howard and Peaston, who developed their crutch-free vocal chops in 
church, know what a lip-synced "live" performance is: It's a sin.

Inspiration can strike at the most inconvenient times. A case in point would be 
a Toots and the Maytals' show at the Coach House early last year. Singer Toots 
Hibbert came on stage 40 minutes late, having waited for a less turbulent 
moment in the flu that was gripping him. After another 40 minutes of dutiful 
performance and obvious suffering, Hibbert could have retreated from the stage 
honorably, and began making motions to do so. 
</P>
<P>
But then something took hold of him: His husky shouts overpowered the rasp in 
his sore throat; his body became his band's rhythms; and it seemed as if the 
soul of Otis Redding had descended on him like a hammer. This continued and 
built for another 70 minutes or so, with Hibbert only snapping out of it for 
brief instants -- usually only long enough to pitifully cry "This flu (is) 
killing me!" -- before being swept back up in something so beyond his control 
that his illness would just have to wait until later to exact its toll. 
</P>
<P>
The other residual effect of such fits of glory is that they can make a 
performer's average shows seem that much dimmer. Such was the case Friday night 
at the Coach House, where it was pretty much business as usual for Hibbert and 
his Maytals. Fortunately, everyday Toots can also be pretty remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
He arguably has the finest voice in reggae, possessing much of the grit and 
passion of the departed Mr. Redding. His material has always taken a more 
soulful bent than most of his dreadlocked contemporaries, and his recent "Toots 
in Memphis" album was a bold and thoroughly successful hybrid of island rhythms 
and Memphis fatback soul. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, he drew chiefly from that album and from his successes of the early 
'70s. In the former category were Ann Peebles' "I Can't Stand the Rain," 
Redding's "Hard to Handle," and a rendition of "Knock on Wood" that went 
through some devious rhythmic permutations. Even the frat-band fave "Louie 
Louie" was bestowed a Memphis majesty by Hibbert's emotive throat and his 
heated band. 
</P>
<P>
Led by his son Hopeton on bass, the band was remarkably responsive to Hibbert's 
moods and moves, as well as bursting with individual fire. A smaller outfit 
than he's fielded in the past -- minus the sax player and Hibbert's singing 
daughters of last year's shows, and with some different members -- they still 
kicked some vicious pulses and musical surprises into each song. 
</P>
<P>
They laid a killer James-Brown-on-jet-skis riff on "Roots Rock Reggae," while 
the venerable "Funky Kingston" was a lesson in the subtle and infinite variety 
of ways to express a groove. Hibbert's two-decade old "Time Tough," "Pressure 
Drop," "Monkey Man" and "54-46, That's My Number" also seemed thoroughly 
fresh-brewed. 
</P>
<P>
But one couldn't help wishing just a touch of flu on Hibbert, if that's what it 
takes to get lightning to strike him. He is a finer and livelier performer than 
there is right to expect after a career as long and as hard as his (he began 
recording nearly 30 years ago and, incidentally, was the first to coin the term 
reggae on record). Whether that inspiration strikes may be beyond one's 
control. But the Redding-like emotion and magic Hibbert sometimes achieves is 
such a very rare thing that it is a shame he doesn't push himself to the utmost 
to achieve it. 
</P>
<P>
There were moments Friday when he seemed to catch it -- on his extremely funky 
version of John Denver's "Take Me Home, Country Roads" and shouting and 
frugging through a slashing take of "Monkey Man" -- but as often as not he went 
through the affectations of soul -- the "Good god! y'all!" shouts and such -- 
without the engagement necessary to make them glow. 
</P>
<P>
The show was opened by the local Common Sense band, which made about as much 
sense as any other bunch of Californians slinging rasta lingo. Somehow, condo 
kids singing in a Trenchtown ghetto patois just doesn't ring true. The group 
did offer a well-propelled, if wholly derivative, set of Wailer-type reggae, 
one that boasted this sprout-head couplet: "If the girl is vegetarian / You 
know the girl's worth marryin'."

Inroads for Blacks in Show Biz 
</P>
<P>
The appointment calendars of blacks in Hollywood are suddenly getting very full 
these days with the recent formation of two groups geared toward helping them 
increase their clout within the entertainment community. 
</P>
<P>
On May 2, about 100 lawyers, actresses, producers and film and record 
executives attended the second meeting of the Black Entertainment Alliance, 
whose goal is to "maximize (blacks') impact and potential for empowerment 
within the music, film, television radio and video industry," said organizer 
Anthony J. Tolbert, business affairs manager at MCA Records. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 100 people attended the first meeting of the African-American Film 
&amp; Television Assn. Saturday at the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Dockery Jr., co-founder of the latter group and president of his own 
production company, said there are enough problems facing blacks in the 
entertainment industry for both organizations to work on. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the success of actor Eddie Murphy, filmmaker Spike Lee and TV talk show 
hosts Oprah Winfrey and Arsenio Hall, Dockery said: "I think blacks are feeling 
for the first time in many years a sense of hope that they can be a productive 
part of the industry."

Register With Tech Ring 
</P>
<P>
Can a fellow who once wandered around barefoot and was reputed to bathe 
irregularly make it into the social register? Absolutely, if his name is Steven 
P. Jobs and it's Stewart Alsop's "Social Register of the Personal Computer 
Industry" that we're talking about. 
</P>
<P>
Jobs, co-founder of the personal computer pioneer Apple, is just one of 650 
corporate and industry leaders whom Alsop handpicked to be in the premier copy 
of the $295 book that debuted May 1. The book is an adjunct to Alsop's regular 
P.C. Newsletter that is published in Redwood City, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other registers that list the pedigree of its entrants, Alsop's offers 
the kind of information that is the currency of the Information Age: 
direct-line telephone numbers, facsimile numbers, the names and phone numbers 
of assistants and, if you need to bypass all assistants entirely, their 
electronic mail box listings. 
</P>

No Fakes for Mom, Please 
</P>
<P>
Giorgio Beverly Hills certainly took Mother's Day very seriously this year. 
</P>
<P>
So seriously, in fact, that it ran special newspaper ads last week in 24 cities 
to warn about fake fragrances -- under the Giorgio label -- made by 
counterfeiters. 
</P>
<P>
"Due to our increased awareness of counterfeit products being sold under our 
name," the ad said, "we can only guarantee the authenticity of Giorgio Beverly 
Hills products bought in authorized department and specialty stores." 
</P>
<P>
Why all the hubbub? More fragrances are sold around Mother's Day than any other 
time, except Christmas. "We want to educate the consumer about the seriousness 
of the problem," said Michael Gould, Giorgio's chief executive.

COLUMBIA PICTURES LURES TOP PRODUCER AWAY FROM FOX; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: JAMES BROOKS SIGNED A SEVEN-YEAR DEAL. HE WILL BE DEVELOPING TV 
AND FILM PROJECTS FOR HIS NEW PARTNER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Columbia Pictures Entertainment announced Sunday that it has signed highly 
regarded Hollywood writer-producer-director James L. Brooks to a long-term film 
and television deal, luring him away from Fox Inc. 
</P>
<P>
In the seven-year joint venture agreement, Columbia will finance and distribute 
films and TV shows created by Brooks' Gracie Films. Brooks, whose film credits 
include "Terms of Endearment" and "Broadcast News" and who now produces "The 
Tracey Ullman Show" and "The Simpsons" for Fox Television, will be provided 
with offices and administrative support by Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really looking to him for his creative expertise and leadership in 
writing and producing and directing motion pictures and creating and directing 
television series," said Alan Levine, president of the Columbia Pictures film 
group. "We are going to provide all of our resources to Jim as he needs them. 
What's ours is his." Levine declined to discuss the financial terms of the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
Levine said the agreement does not specify how many films or TV shows the 
Brooks-Columbia partnership must produce. Gracie Films has a commitment to 
create three television series for ABC. Those will be carried out through the 
joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
"It's understood that we will do a movie when there is an imperative," said 
Brooks, whose career took off as a writer on "The Mary Tyler Moore Show." 
"Basically, they want us to be self-starters, and I hope we can be." 
</P>
<P>
Columbia's co-chairmen, Peter Guber and Jon Peters, who were brought in last 
year after the studio's takeover by Sony Corp., had supported efforts to lure 
Brooks to Columbia, Levine said. The studio had begun preliminary negotiations 
with Brooks before Guber and Peters joined the company in December. 
</P>
<P>
"This culminates months of pursuit and discussion by our full management 
group," Guber said in a statement. "Jim has assembled an excellent creative 
team, and we felt that CPE should be its logical home." 
</P>
<P>
The partnership, which will begin June 1, is clearly a blow to Fox and its 
chairman, Barry Diller, who is a longtime friend of Brooks. While at Fox, 
Brooks produced the films "Big," "Say Anything" and "The War of the Roses." His 
television shows for Fox have been highly successful for the fledgling network. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks says Fox still has an option to produce a movie he is currently writing 
and he will continue to work on "The Simpsons." 
</P>
<P>
Brooks, who has been working with Fox for two years without a contract, said 
talks with the studio failed over what he described as "arcane" details over 
future television programs. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to stay there," said Brooks, "and it's strange because we and Fox 
each wanted to continue but could not find a way to continue." 
</P>
<P>
Before joining Fox in 1984, Brooks worked with Diller at Paramount, where 
Brooks developed the Oscar-winning "Terms of Endearment" and the TV show 
"Taxi." 
</P>
<P>
"We are friends," Brooks said of Diller. "It colors the day a little bit. But 
it just seemed time to move on."

Stroh Interested in Heileman Brewing: Stroh Brewery Co. said it is interested 
in acquiring G. Heileman Brewing Co., a unit of besieged Australian 
entrepreneur Alan Bond's Bond Corp. A combination of Stroh and Heileman, which 
makes Colt 45 Malt Liquor, would create the nation's third-largest brewing 
company. An article in the Detroit News quoted Stroh President Roger Fridholm 
as saying that Stroh might try to acquire Heileman by bypassing company 
management and negotiating directly with the brewer's bankers. Heileman scoffed 
at the report.

Mexico Takes Step to Privatize Banks: Eight years after banks were 
nationalized, the lower house of Mexico's congress -- the Chamber of Deputies 
-- approved a constitutional amendment to return them to private ownership. The 
measure, proposed on May 2 by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, now goes to 
the Senate, where its passage is virtually assured. A total of 31 state 
legislatures also must approve it.

Rap Singer to Stop Using Skyywalker Name: The lead singer of 2 Live Crew, a rap 
group notorious for sexually explicit lyrics, was ordered by U.S. District 
Judge James Ideman Wednesday to stop using the name Luke Skyywalker on grounds 
that it could damage the image of its "Star Wars" namesake. Ideman issued a 
temporary restraining order banning the use of the name pending the outcome of 
a $200-million trademark infringement suit brought by director George Lucas, 
who owns the trademark "Luke Skywalker," the clean-cut hero in the film series.

Insurance Firm Sued Over Shooting: State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. was sued 
in Los Angeles Superior Court Wednesday for breach of contract by the wife and 
sister of a man who went on a shooting spree in September, 1988, allegedly 
firing more than 100 rounds. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, brought by Rosemary Gendreau-Wise, wife of the late John Southey Wise 
Jr., and her sister, Michele Gendreau, says they had homeowners insurance with 
State Farm. The suit asks the insurer to pay for settling lawsuits brought 
against the family by people injured in the attack. It also seeks payments to 
repair the residence and damages because benefits allegedly were withheld 
unreasonably. (Filed May 9, 1990. Case No. BC000762)

The Securities and Exchange Commission's civil suit is against William Jackson,

WITH TRUMP, KEEP AN EYE ON THE MAN BEHIND THE CURTAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN SLOAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
That baying sound you hear is the sound of the wolf pack in full cry after 
Donald J. Trump. And those little red dots are Trump bleeding into the snow. 
</P>
<P>
How can Trump be wounded, when only yesterday the question was how many 
billions Trump was worth and how much of that fortune would go to his wife, 
Ivana, in the event of a divorce? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Because, thanks to some of Trump's own financial statements that have 
now surfaced, it's become clear that Trump's assets would be worth little more 
than his debts if he were forced to sell. They might even be worth less than 
his debts, given problems in the Northeastern real estate markets, the Atlantic 
City, N.J., casino business and the airline business, in which Trump's major 
assets lie. 
</P>
<P>
The real question about Trump now isn't what he's worth but whether his empire 
can survive in anything like its current form. 
</P>
<P>
The more Trump postures and screeches about raising $2 billion in cash, about 
selling his Trump Shuttle airline for a preposterous $550 million, about 
selling the Plaza Hotel in New York to the Sultan of Brunei, the more obvious 
it becomes that the man is trying to jawbone his way out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
But wasn't Trump worth $1.7 billion a year ago, according to Forbes magazine? 
Haven't Fortune and Business Week magazines at one point said he's a 
multibillionaire? Has The Donald somehow dropped billions of dollars in the 
past few months? 
</P>
<P>
Nope. Trump was never worth as much as he claimed to be -- which, depending on 
his mood and the gullibility of his audience, might be $3 billion or $4 billion 
or $5 billion. Declines in the value of Trump's assets have hurt him, but the 
major loss is having the aura of billionairehood stripped away. 
</P>
<P>
Trump, who despite his bombastic public performances is really a very shrewd 
man, realized that there is no law against giving print and television 
journalists completely nonsensical financial statements, and he did that every 
chance he got. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Because Trump's game involves constantly borrowing money. He needs the 
loans to expand, to cover the cash losses on his existing properties and to pay 
for the expensive life he leads. To be able to borrow that way, you have to 
look like you're already rolling in dough. 
</P>
<P>
While misleading the news media is legal, it is against the law to file false 
financial statements with the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, which 
regulates Trump's Castle, Plaza and Taj Mahal casino-hotels. Trump's financial 
statements, while overly optimistic about the value of Trump's assets, provide 
a good starting point from which to figure out his finances. 
</P>
<P>
A colleague of mine at Newsday has gotten hold of Trump's net worth statement 
dated May 31, 1989. The document was obviously drawn up to be submitted to the 
casino commission and is obviously the same document as the "financial 
statement filed with a government agency" that Forbes cites in its recent 
article about Trump. The Forbes version has greater detail than ours. Combine 
that document with cash flow numbers that Business Week got from Trump, and you 
see that he's bleeding badly. 
</P>
<P>
Trump's statement claims that he has a net worth of $1.5 billion. That doesn't 
sound as if he's in trouble until you analyze where the supposed net worth 
actually lies. 
</P>
<P>
Some $1.1 billion of supposed net worth consists of the Plaza and Castle 
casinos and the West Side Yards, a vacant, 76-acre tract on Manhattan's West 
Side. By Trump's valuation, these properties are worth $1.9 billion and carry a 
mere $800 million of debt. 
</P>
<P>
But these supposedly oh-so-valuable properties are cash drains. It's hard to 
see how in today's marketplace (or maybe in any marketplace) they can be worth 
anything like what Trump says they are. 
</P>
<P>
The West Side Yards have to be costing Trump at least $25 million a year in 
interest, real estate taxes and legal fees. And even though the casinos are 
perceived to be very profitable, clauses in the junk bonds Trump used to buy 
the casinos limit his cash take. Sometimes he even has to return money he has 
taken previously. Last year, depending on how you do the math, he either took a 
total of $3 million out of the casinos or put $6 million in. Either way, the 
casinos give Trump a cash trickle, not a cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, Trump owns a lot of stuff; his assets are probably worth at least $3 
billion. The problem, as my father used to say, is that all his assets are tied 
up in debts. 
</P>
<P>
Start with the May 31, 1989, net worth statement, adjust it for later 
transactions, and Trump seems to owe the world about $3.2 billion. How much are 
his assets worth? It depends on whom you ask. If you take the lower of the 
Business Week or Forbes valuations on any given Trump property, you end up with 
a net worth of little or nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Trump's people, of course, say these valuations are way low. In a recent 
interview, Joseph Silver, Trump's general counsel, brandished appraisals of 
various Trump properties. If you took those appraised values as real values, 
Trump is worth substantially north of $2 billion. Make it close to $3 billion 
if you want to include the new appraisals of the Plaza and the Castle, which 
have miraculously risen about 25% in value since last year despite the casino 
industry's problems in Atlantic City.

It's hard to take appraisals too seriously. Anybody who has ever sold his home 
to his employer as part of a corporate transfer knows that you always get three 
appraisers to value the house: your high-ball appraiser, the company's low-ball 
appraiser and a third appraiser who is actually trying to be fair. Trump, of 
course, is using only his appraiser. 
</P>
<P>
It's too early to wave goodby to The Donald. He may yet find a sucker to pay an 
outrageous price for the Plaza Hotel, or sell his Trump Princess yacht for $115 
million, or get the zoning for the West Side Yards or get New Jersey to adopt 
round-the-clock gambling. But the wolf howls are getting louder. And there's 
more and more of Donald's blood in the snow.

<P>
When Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. went down the drain three months ago in the 
biggest bankruptcy in Wall Street's history, it was Jeffrey Bowman who pulled 
the plug. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman toils here as an unsung numbers cruncher at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. 
Bowman's task is telling investors whether Drexel or other brokerage, his 
specialty, are likely to make their payments on bonds and other borrowings on 
time. 
</P>
<P>
In November, after poring over balance sheets and making a host of obscure 
financial calculations, Bowman concluded that Drexel's financial condition was 
deteriorating. In particular, it was suffering from a plunge in the value of 
its junk bond portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
After several meetings with Drexel management, Bowman acted. He lowered his 
rating on Drexel's commercial paper, or short-term corporate IOUs, to A-3 from 
A-2. That meant Standard &amp; Poor's thought that Drexel had slipped a notch 
closer to default on those debts. 
</P>
<P>
The result was quick and dramatic. Within weeks, Drexel faced a severe cash 
squeeze as banks and other investors responded to the downgrading by refusing 
to renew about $400 million in loans to the firm. In February, after 
unsuccessfully seeking a new source of financing, Drexel defaulted on $100 
million of commercial paper and filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman was a prophet who told the world of Drexel's impending downfall. He 
wasn't the direct cause of it. But his action marked a critical turning point 
for the firm, and its impact illustrates the growing influence that the ratings 
agencies wield at a time of widespread jitters among investors about rising 
numbers of defaults and bankruptcies. 
</P>
<P>
While the financial markets have always paid attention to debt ratings, the 
focus intensifies at times, such as now, when credit is scarce and financial 
resources are stretched. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the limelight right now. Wall Street operates between the boundaries 
of greed and fear, and today it's closer to the fear side of the equation," 
said Leo C. O'Neill, president of Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Group. (Another 
branch of Standard &amp; Poor's created the well-known S&amp;P 500 stock 
index.) 
</P>
<P>
Ratings firms are the judges responsible for telling the public whether a bond 
is safe or speculative, "investment grade" or "junk." They also decide whether 
a bond is extremely safe, rated AAA, or merely a pretty good investment -- say, 
A or BBB. 
</P>
<P>
These fine distinctions can mean a difference of millions of dollars in 
borrowing costs for companies, as well as for city, state and national 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
A downgrade of New York state's debt last month is expected to cost the state 
at least $40 million in extra interest the next time it taps the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
Even a small change in the debt rating by Standard &amp; Poor's or Moody's 
Investors Service, the two biggest and best-known firms, can cause havoc for a 
bank or other financial company that relies on borrowing to stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
Late last month, a downgrade of Citicorp, the nation's largest bank holding 
company, triggered a slump in stock prices for the entire banking industry. 
Financial services giant American Express Co. has pumped more than $1 billion 
since December into its troubled brokerage subsidiary, Shearson Lehman Hutton 
Inc., largely to prop up its credit rating. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, as with Drexel, a downgrade has contributed to a company's 
collapse. Mortgage &amp; Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust, found 
itself cut off from bank credit in March within 24 hours of a lowering of its 
debt rating. It filed for bankruptcy protection on April 12. 
</P>
<P>
The ratings firms' new-found power marks a turnaround that might be termed the 
"revenge of the nerds." In the heady 1980s, Drexel and other advocates of junk 
bonds disdained what they viewed as the raters' excessive caution over the 
high-yield but risky securities. 
</P>
<P>
In those days, the high fliers would sniff that ratings analysts were "badly 
dressed and poorly paid and could not be counted on to do what markets do, 
which is look ahead," a Wall Street bond specialist said. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, with the junk bond market is in a severe slump and Drexel in 
bankruptcy court, the raters are basking in the glow of regained respect. 
</P>
<P>
"The (ratings) agencies were right after all. . . . They recognized junk for 
what it was," said Richard Lehmann, president of the Bond Investors Assn. and a 
frequent critic of the ratings agencies. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill of Standard &amp; Poor's said: "I feel that in some respects we were 
vindicated, because the true risk of junk bonds certainly has become apparent." 
</P>
<P>
But the glare of public interest has drawn renewed attention to longstanding 
complaints that the ratings agencies are too slow in adjusting their ratings to 
reflect changing market conditions, or are not sufficiently precise in judging 
the quality of some securities, especially junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
"Many times you'll find that a company's bond rating is changed two or three 
times in the six months before it goes bankrupt. Obviously, that's not very 
much time for the market to react," said Edward I. Altman, a finance professor 
at New York University. 
</P>
<P>
But Altman said the agencies do a good job overall. 
</P>
<P>
"The rating agencies have really been under pressure to be on top of the 
markets. When they miss one out of 500, they draw criticism," said Paul H. 
Ross, a managing director and veteran bond researcher at Salomon Bros. 
</P>
<P>
Fueling the controversy is a major push by one of the smaller ratings firms, 
Fitch Investors Service Inc., to capture business by seeking to move more 
quickly to adjust ratings for changing conditions and to explain its rationale 
more fully than its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Fitch, which has lured away a considerable amount of talent from Standard &amp; 
Poor's, has more than tripled in size to 143 employees since a new, more 
aggressive management acquired it 13 months ago. That still leaves it much 
smaller than Standard &amp; Poor's, which has about 600 employees in its 
ratings service worldwide, and Moody's, which has 1,100, including those in its 
printing facility. 
</P>
<P>
In deciding how safe a bond or other borrowing is, the ratings agencies judge 
the size of the margin of safety that the debtor enjoys in case the economic 
environment turns sour and it becomes difficult to make payments. 
</P>
<P>
The agencies normally are paid for their work by the corporation or other 
entity that issues the bonds. The issuer is willing to pay because it knows 
that many potential investors will buy only rated securities. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers believe that the combination of intense concern over credit 
safety and extra competition in the ratings business itself has led the 
agencies to be more rigorous than ever in evaluating securities. 
</P>
<P>
"There seems to be a contest now to see who can be more aggressive in 
downgrading people," said Lehmann, who edits the Defaulted Bonds Newsletter in 
addition to heading the Bond Investors Assn. The association is a nonprofit 
information organization based in Miami Lakes, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Figures from the ratings agencies show that there has been a sharp increase in 
downgrades. In the first three months of this year, Moody's downgraded ratings 
of 95 corporations affecting about $75 billion of long-term debt. It raised the 
ratings of only 23 issuers, affecting $26 billion of debt. 
</P>
<P>
In a sign that the situation was worsening, Moody's noted that the ratio of 
downgrades to upgrades for that period was steeper than the average of 2 1/2 
downgrades per upgrade for all of 1989, when the number of actual defaults 
reached a 20-year high. 
</P>
<P>
Lehmann said the agencies had turned more cautious in part because of several 
"very spectacular bond collapses" in recent months. These included the bonds of 
heavily indebted retailing giant Campeau Corp., owner of Bloomingdale's, and 
the Drexel-financed firm Integrated Resources Inc. 
</P>
<P>
But the ratings agencies insist that they are careful to apply consistent 
standards in good times and bad. They say the increased number of downgrades 
merely reflects the worsened financial situation of many companies that took on 
too much debt in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
"You had a great degree of leveraging of the corporate sector in the late 
1980s, and that process to some degree is reversing itself. People focus in on 
the ratings because they're highlighting some of the strains that have come out 
of that period," said Tom McGuire, executive vice president and director of 
corporate ratings for Moody's. 
</P>
<P>
The agencies are proud of the fact that only one company, Manville Corp., has 
defaulted on bonds that were rated investment-grade at the time. In that case, 
in 1982, the building materials company was hit suddenly by massive legal 
liabilities related to cancer-causing asbestos products. 
</P>
<P>
They also point to studies that show a clear relationship over time between 
bonds' ratings and the frequency of default. Between 1970 and 1989, for 
example, Moody's calculates that the average default rate in the first 10 years 
of life of bonds initially rated as investment grade was 2.2%, compared to 
18.1% for those initially rated as speculative or "junk."

<P>
Tens of thousands of people, including President Francois Mitterrand and 
survivors of the Holocaust, marched silently through Paris today, protesting 
the recent desecrations of Jewish cemeteries. 
</P>
<P>
Many wore yellow Stars of David. 
</P>
<P>
The march initially was organized in response to vandalism last week at a 
cemetery in the southern town of Carpentras, where tombs were smashed and a 
recently buried body was dug up and mutilated. Another desecration was 
discovered early today at a cemetery near Paris, where obscenities and 
swastikas were painted in red on more than 30 tombs. 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand's presence -- not announced in advance -- was believed to mark the 
first time since World War II that a French president had joined a public 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
Premier Michel Rocard, Chief Rabbi Joseph Sitruk and Roman Catholic Cardinal 
Albery Decourtray were among the throng of marchers who left from the Place de 
la Republique. Rocard said he wanted to help show the world that France's "true 
image" was one of tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of Jewish leaders, the country's six largest TV networks agreed 
to broadcast "Night and Fog," a documentary about Nazi death camps, tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition of Jewish groups organizing the procession asked that marchers 
display only authorized banners and posters with the slogan: "No to racism. No 
to anti-Semitism." 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of every major political party except the extreme-right National Front 
urged supporters to participate, as did human rights groups and many major 
labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
Police meanwhile appealed for witnesses to assist in their investigation of the 
desecration in Carpentras. Five skinheads were released after being questioned 
about the crime. 
</P>
<P>
The desecration there provoked outrage across France. 
</P>
<P>
In Haifa, Israel, over the weekend, about 300 graves were spray-painted with 
anti-Jewish slogans, and police said a Jew from a nearby town had been arrested 
as a suspect. Thousands of people went to the cemetery Sunday and relatives 
wept at the graves of their dead. 
</P>
<P>
Police sealed off the Carpentras cemetery today without explanation, and the 
widow of the man whose body was dug up reportedly left Carpentras after having 
received telephoned death threats. 
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Pierre Joxe, along with other political and human rights 
leaders, has accused far-right politician Jean-Marie Le Pen of implicit 
responsibility in the desecration by creating an atmosphere of racial hatred. 
</P>
<P>
Le Pen, who said in an interview today the government was providing him with 
bodyguards, once termed the Nazi gas chambers "a detail" of history. His 
National Front favors the expulsion of Muslim immigrants from North Africa.

Stocks closed at an all-time high today on buying carried over from last week's 
rally, although profit-taking late in the day pared the overall gain. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average, which soared 63.07 on Friday, closed up 19.95 
points at 2,821.53 -- well above its previous high closing, 2,810.15 recorded 
on Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow, which was up as much as 52 points in earlier trading, also shattered 
its intraday high of 2,822.95, set the morning of Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Volume was a strong 225.41 million shares, compared with 234.04 million shares 
traded Friday, the year's heaviest trading day. Gains outpaced losses by 2 to 1 
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said investor enthusiasm carried over from Friday's big rally. But a 
bout of selling late in the day held down the gain in the Dow index. 
</P>
<P>
Prices were higher in active trading of American Stock Exchange issues. 
</P>
<P>
Despite an afternoon pullback that analysts attributed to profit taking after 
Friday's surge, the market staged a broad-based rally for the second straight 
session, thanks to a huge amount of carryover institutional buying from Friday 
and a lot of computerized program buying. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a little slowdown. We're absorbing some of the runup," said James 
Andrews, first vice president of institutional trading at Janney, Montgomery 
Scott Inc. in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews said the rally has been driven by institutions, which have held large 
cash positions, putting their money to work again. "And if we get an indication 
that rates are coming down, we could see real big swings on the upside," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The rally has been attributed to a sudden favorable swing in economic 
statistics of late, which has reduced worries over inflation and the 
interest-rate outlook. 
</P>
<P>
In afternoon trading, Treasury notes and bonds were as much as 3/8 point higher 
after bonds surged more than 2 points Friday after the government report of a 
decline in April producer prices, which made investors feel more confident that 
interest rates have peaked and that inflation is under control. 
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't have put together a better combination of news for the market," 
said Hugh Johnson, chief economist at First Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Treasury bond market gained a bit more ground today following Friday's 
big rally, with prices of government issues unchanged to slightly higher in 
quiet early trading. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year issue was up nearly 1/8 point, or $1.25 
per $1,000 face amount, by midday. As a result, its yield, which moves 
inversely to the price, inched lower to 8.65% from 8.66% Friday. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the 30-year bond soared about $17.50, while shorter-term issues also 
posted heathy price gains, reflecting a change in market psychology. 
</P>
<P>
Market watchers say recent government reports have convinced many traders the 
economy is growing only moderately and inflationary pressures are subsiding. 
For instance, the government reported Friday that retail sales declined steeply 
in April and inflation on the wholesale level had eased that month. 
</P>
<P>
Also boosting to the market was the success of the government's three-day 
quarterly refunding last week.

POLICE SEEK MOTIVE IN KILLING OF AILING MAN IN WOODLAND HILLS

Los Angeles police this morning were trying to determine the motive for the 
slaying of a man who was found shot to death in a house he was watching for his 
sister and her husband in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Arthur Lee Ekrem, 59, of Palmdale was found in the house in the 
22300 block of Quinta Road about 7:30 p.m. Sunday when his sister and 
brother-in-law, Phyllis and Robert Matthews, returned home after a weekend out 
of town. 
</P>
<P>
Ekrem, who was retired and in poor health, had been shot numerous times in the 
upper body, Detective Rick Swanston said. He had been staying at the Woodland 
Hills house about a week while sick and agreed to house-sit while the 
Matthewses went away for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Swanston said there was no sign of forced entry or a struggle at the house and 
robbery was apparently not a motive. Ekrem's car was not taken. 
</P>
<P>
The Matthewses left the house in a quiet hillside neighborhood near Mulholland 
Drive and Topanga Canyon Boulevard on Saturday morning, Swanston said. It 
appears from evidence at the crime scene that Ekrem was probably killed 
Saturday afternoon, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Swanston said there was nothing to indicate that the victim's brother-in-law, 
the owner of a chain of car lubrication shops, was the intended target.

A group of masked men opened fire in a cafe today, killing four people and 
wounding three while customers gambled in a game "possibly involving tens of 
thousands of dollars," police said. 
</P>
<P>
The intruders reportedly burst into the Glass Key Cafe and yelled "task force" 
before they began firing automatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Doug Clarke said there were conflicting reports from witnesses 
but there apparently were four to six gunmen, some wearing masks and some in 
camouflage gear. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the Glass Key is a suspected center for illegal gambling. About 15 
people were inside at the time of the 7 a.m. shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been known to have gambling and dice games there," Clarke said. 
"There's also dope dealing in and around the area." 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Thomas Wyndom said authorities "believe there was a game going on 
possibly involving tens of thousands of dollars."

'IVAN TERRIBLE' APPEALS CONVICTION; 
</P>
<P>
DEMJANJUK'S WAR CRIMES TRIAL JUDGES DESCRIBED AS BIASED

<P>
The trial judges who convicted retired Ohio auto worker John Demjanjuk of 
killing Jews at a World War II death camp were biased, his attorney said today 
in court arguments appealing the war crimes conviction. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1988, a three-judge panel found that Demjanjuk was a brutal guard 
known as "Ivan the terrible," who operated gas chambers at the Treblinka death 
camp in Poland from 1942 to 1943. More than 850,000 Jews died there. 
</P>
<P>
Demjanjuk, 70, of Cleveland, was sentenced to death under a 1950 Israeli law 
allowing prosecution of Nazis and their collaborators. 
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk has maintained he is a victim of mistaken identity 
and that he was incarcerated in German POW camps during the period in question. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking before a five-justice Supreme Court panel, Demjanjuk's Israeli 
attorney, Yoram Sheftel, said he disputed the conviction on 10 points. The most 
significant, Sheftel said, was "the bias of the court." 
</P>
<P>
"It should lead to the clear conclusion that the conviction should be canceled 
and especially in a case where the sentence is capital punishment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheftel argued at length about what he said was a hostile atmosphere created by 
news reports and the judges' treatment of the defense during the 17-month 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
He claimed the trial judges -- Dov Levine, Dalia Dorner and Shmuel Tal -- 
subscribed to a clipping service that twice daily delivered reports from 
newspapers. He also asserted the judges briefed reporters on occasion. 
</P>
<P>
He said biased reporting "clearly had a great deal of influence on the court. 
Sometimes I thought I wasn't sitting in a court but at Bloomfield," a football 
stadium near Tel Aviv, Sheftel said. 
</P>
<P>
He said there were frequent shouts and interruptions from the audience at the 
trial, which was held in a converted movie theater. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only was an appearance of justice lacking but justice in fact was not 
done," said Sheftel. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout today's proceedings, Demjanjuk, wearing a dark brown prison uniform, 
listened impassively from a witness stand, guarded by two policemen. He 
muttered "good morning" in Hebrew as he entered the courtroom wearing handcuffs 
and then embraced his son, John Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Demjanjuk's wife, Vera, also was present and refused to speak to reporters.

The Hubble Space Telescope failed to lock onto any stars during an initial 
attempt to focus its mirrors, possibly delaying the observatory's first picture 
until the end of the week, an official said today. 
</P>
<P>
NASA engineers were unable to locate and lock onto stars in five attempts with 
the 12-ton telescope during a 38-hour focusing process that began Saturday, 
said spokesman John Dumoulin of the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, 
Ala. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't get a lock in any of the attempts," said Dumoulin. "There are a 
lot of theories why." 
</P>
<P>
The failure means ground controllers will probably repeat the process, he said. 
Last week officials said they hoped to take the telescope's first picture 
between Wednesday and Friday, depending on whether the process needed 
repeating.

Varian Associates Inc., which manufactures electron devices and analytical 
instruments, said today it will sell some non-core operations and product lines 
to improve its long-term performance. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the restructuring, it will take a pretax charge of $74 million 
against third-quarter earnings and report a loss for the period. 
</P>
<P>
In last year's third quarter, Varian earned $9.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it will scale down its worldwide work force. 
</P>
<P>
The combined effect of the asset sales and job eliminations will reduce the 
work force to under 10,000 from 12,000, Varian said, including a 20% cut in 
corporate staff, eliminating 600 jobs by the Sept. 29 fiscal year end. 
</P>
<P>
It said activities to be sold include Continental Electronics in Dallas and TVT 
Ltd. in Cambridge, England, makers of high-power transmitters for broadcasting. 
It will also sell units in Palo Alto and Santa Clara that make night vision 
goggles and solid-state circuits.

Burger King, Wal-Mart, Kinney Shoes, Dunkin' Donuts are hardly names that stir 
feelings of fear and loathing in the masses. 
</P>
<P>
But for Joseph and Lorrie Liani, the owners of a quaint doughnut shop down the 
road from Salem State College, the names are like a punch in the stomach. 
</P>
<P>
It's the feeling that strikes any mom-and-pop business when a national 
franchise -- Liani calls them the "big boys" -- rides into town. 
</P>
<P>
Dunkin' Donuts is the newcomer in their case, and it has hitched itself up 
right across the street from the Lianis' little shop. 
</P>
<P>
"What you've really got here is two countries fighting a war, and one's 
fighting with sticks and the other country has guns," Joseph Liani, 31, said. 
</P>
<P>
The Lianis have poured their adult lives into the Donut Ring, a shoe-box-size 
diner with 10 swivel stools, a Formica counter and freshly brewed coffee. 
</P>
<P>
"There was always security knowing that we had our own business," said Lorrie 
Liani, 30. "There wasn't a threat -- until now. Somebody's next door, taking 
our customers away and taking money out of our pockets and taking food out of 
our mouths." 
</P>
<P>
The Lianis said their business dropped 10% to 15% over the first month. "So 
it's not as bad as I thought it might be," Joseph Liani said. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the Donut Ring's business comes from the morning traffic of professors 
and students to Salem State and from commuters on their way to Boston, about 20 
miles to the south. 
</P>
<P>
The Lianis aren't giving up. So far they haven't had to worry about a price war 
-- both doughnut shops charge about the same prices. The Donut Ring, for 
example, has cheaper coffee but more expensive filled doughnuts.

Stock prices, boosted by the Japanese yen's strength against the U.S. dollar, 
surged in active trading today with the key Nikkei average inching past the 
32,000-point level for the first time since mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
The blue-chip Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained 531.88 
points Friday, added another 530.51 points to close at 32,042.65. 
</P>
<P>
It was the average's first close above the 32,000 level since March 16, when 
the average finished at 32,616.44. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 800 million shares changed hands, compared with 626 million shares 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Advances outpaced declines 761 to 225, while 137 issues remained unchanged. 
</P>

Dealers said foreign investors were buying heavily because of the increasing 
value of the Japanese yen. "As the yen gains on the dollar, they don't have to 
worry about losing money on the exchange rate," said Kazuhiro Maekawa of

Bell Helicopter Textron Inc., whose V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft military project 
faces an uncertain future because of defense cuts, said today it will lay off 
115 employees to "help improve cost efficiencies." 
</P>
<P>
The work reduction action will affect both hourly and salaried workers and 
won't be concentrated in a particular program or production, a company 
spokesman said. The military and commercial helicopter maker employs about 
7,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has proposed to eliminate the V-22 project, one 
of the largest defense projects for Bell Helicopter. It is being jointly 
developed by Bell Helicopter Textron and Boeing Helicopters of Ridley Township, 
Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Proposed cuts in the defense budget have affected other area companies that 
rely heavily on such contracts.

Raunchy comedian Andrew Dice Clay's controversial appearance on "Saturday Night 
Live" drew substantially higher ratings to go with the hecklers and protests it 
generated, NBC said. 
</P>
<P>
Dice's presence on Saturday's late-night broadcast had sparked protests from 
homosexual and women's groups and led cast member Nora Dunn and singer Sinead 
O'Connor to refuse to appear. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary ratings figures gave the show a market share of 31%, 6 percentage 
points higher than SNL's usual 25 share, said Rosemary Keenan, an NBC 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
NBC logged 234 negative phone calls during the broadcast, with only 13 calls 
supporting the appearance by the acid-tongued comic, known for his derogatory 
and graphic put-downs of women and minorities and explicit descriptions of 
violent sexual encounters.

SHERWOOD ON 'MURPHY BROWN' IS NOT A 'DITZ,' FAITH FORD DECLARES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faith Ford says that lovable yet annoying Corky Sherwood on CBS' "Murphy Brown" 
is a lot of things, but dumb isn't one of them. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people have described her as a ditz, but I don't think she's that," said 
Ford, who plays the blonde beauty queen turned television newsmagazine 
reporter. 
</P>
<P>
"She's an unedited person," Ford said. "She says what comes to her mind. She's 
bossy. She loves to throw her opinions at people. She offers advice that no one 
wants. But she's not dumb. One thing is she has no sense of humor about 
herself. She takes everything so seriously." 
</P>
<P>
"Murphy Brown" centers on a television newsmagazine called "F.Y.I.," where 
perky Corky Sherwood is tossed in, over her head. The network selected her for 
glamour, and there she is swimming among the sharks. 
</P>
<P>
Candice Bergen is Murphy Brown, the wise, cynical, efficient reporter, whose 
personal life usually is a shambles. 
</P>
<P>
In a two-part episode that begins tonight, Corky marries a former schoolmate, 
with Murphy serving as the maid of honor. Her new husband, called "Wide Load 
Willie" in school, is now a slimmed-down and handsome attorney named Will 
Forrest, played by Scott Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
"We found out Corky's still a virgin," Ford said. "She had a tender scene with 
Murphy. She confides in Murphy, and Murphy lets her know how fond she is of 
Corky. It adds some depth to Corky. I've been praying for her. She's very 
funny, but you have to see that she's a real person. You see that, and you get 
closer to her." 
</P>
<P>
Ford, unlike Corky, is not a former Miss America. She was, however, a finalist 
in a model search by Teen magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"I graduated from high school in 1982, and two weeks later left for New York," 
Ford said. "My parents helped me get set up in New York. I had mixed emotions. 
I wanted to leave for the big city, but I was still nervous. I'd won a modeling 
contest, and I wondered if that meant they were going to find jobs for me. It 
didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"But I did some modeling and I hated it. It was a meat market. Acting is what I 
loved, but I needed to pay my bills. I was just a girl from Pineville." 
</P>
<P>
Ford played Muffy Critchlowe on the soap opera "One Life To Live" and later was 
on "Another World." 
</P>
<P>
She moved to Los Angeles to find more opportunities in television. She was Lynn 
Holly Brickhouse, the blonde beauty, on "The Popcorn Kid" in the spring of 
1987. Later, she had a role as a secretary on ABC's "thirtysomething." She left 
that show for "Murphy Brown."

The debate over whether the lyrics of a recording by the million-selling rap 
group 2 Live Crew are obscene moved to a higher level today with the issue's 
first airing in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez was asked to determine if "As Nasty as They 
Wanna Be," which has been removed from store shelves in several Florida 
counties, should also be banned in Broward County. 
</P>
<P>
The county ordered the ban. Lawyers for the Miami-based group then asked 
Gonzalez to lift the ban. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the group's four members -- David Hobbs, whose stage name is Mr. Mixx; 
Chris Wongwon, known as Fresh Kid Ice, and Mark Ross, who performs as Brother 
Marquis -- were present for the trial's start. 
</P>
<P>
Leader Luther Campbell was expected later, said Debbie Bennett, a spokeswoman 
for the group's record company. 
</P>
<P>
The album "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" has sold nearly 2 million copies, while a 
toned-down version of the album has sold about 300,000 copies.

For 43 high school students, Brenda Lee didn't make much of an impression -- 
until they learned that Madonna is one of her fans. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran singer told students Friday that she recorded two songs for the 
soundtrack of the upcoming "Dick Tracy" movie. 
</P>
<P>
"Madonna asked specifically that I sing the songs -- which are brand-new 
numbers," Lee told the students. "I had no idea she was a fan of my singing, 
but I'm delighted she is." 
</P>
<P>
Lee is appearing at the Opryland USA theme park for her third straight year. A 
hit country and pop singer since she was in her teens, she is known for such 
songs as "I'm Sorry," "Fool No. 1" and "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree."

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: FLUORIDE HELD UNLIKELY TO INCREASE BREAST CANCER RISK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JOE GRAEDON and TERESA GRAEDON

Question: Seven years ago at menopause, I was told by my doctor to start taking 
Florical (calcium carbonate and sodium fluoride). It is supposed to keep my 
bones from getting brittle and to keep me from getting stooped over. 
</P>
<P>
Now I have read that fluoride might cause cancer. Two of my sisters have had 
breast cancer -- my twin died at 35, and my younger sister had her breast 
removed 11 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
I am worried about doing anything that would increase my risk of cancer. Is the 
Florical a problem? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Fluoride has been in the news recently because a study for the National 
Toxicology Program turned up a rare form of bone cancer in some of the rats 
getting high doses of fluoride in their water. Scientists are uncertain how 
this may apply to humans, so further studies are in order. 
</P>
<P>
It is extremely unlikely that the fluoride you are taking would increase your 
risk of breast cancer, but there is little likelihood it is protecting your 
bones from osteoporosis. New research indicates that fluoride treatments do not 
prevent fractures in post menopausal women. 
</P>
<P>
There is, however, an experimental treatment for osteoporosis that looks very 
promising. A Danish study recently found that women taking Didronel 
(etidronate) had stronger bones and fewer fractures than those on a placebo. 
Perhaps it is time to discuss your osteoporosis prevention program with your 
physician. 
</P>
<P>
Q. My grandson, age 10, has frequent urinary infections. My daughter would like 
to able to check his urine when she suspects there is a problem. 
</P>
<P>
I remember reading in your column about a test that can be done at home. My 
pharmacist didn't know anything about it. What is the name of the product, and 
will she need a prescription? 
</P>
<P>
A. Microstix-Nitrite Reagent Strips or Biotel u.t.i. home screening tests for 
urinary tract infections are available without prescription. These little 
strips change color when dipped in a urine sample. Such home tests can be 
helpful in alerting a parent to the need for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I've been taking Mevacor to lower cholesterol for two years. Not long ago I 
read that after 15 months on Mevacor, a person should have a liver biopsy. When 
I asked my doctor about this, he said there was no need for it. He does a blood 
test on me twice a year. 
</P>
<P>
Now I am afraid of this drug. Do I need to have my liver tested or is my doctor 
right? 
</P>
<P>
A. The risk of liver damage from Mevacor (lovastatin) is low. Nevertheless, 
blood tests (not a biopsy) should be performed every four to six weeks during 
the first year and a half of treatment.

LIZ SMITH: THAT'S SOME WINDOW IVANA DRESSED UP FOR $1

REMEMBER THE saga of Donald and Ivana Trump and the Plaza? This is a story 
wherein he pays her a dollar a year to rehabilitate, renovate and oversee the 
hotel and then claims that she is just window dressing in his life and doesn't 
really do any work. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, please! Ivana took over the Plaza 18 months ago -- Aug. 21, 1988, to be 
exact -- and now Traveler magazine for June has named it "One of the Best 
Hotels in the World." (They only give this acknowledgment to three hotels in 
all of the U.S. -- the Plaza, the Mansion at Turtle Creek in Dallas and the 
Bel-Air in L.A.) 
</P>
<P>
Ivana's Plaza has also been named by Pinnacle magazine as "the best hotel in 
the U.S. for corporate meetings and conventions." Last year, Prestige mag named 
the Plaza "the most improved hotel" in the country. 
</P>
<P>
For only a dollar a year and a lot of tourists, I'd say that Donald is a hard 
man to please. 
</P>

REX SMITH is filling in for ailing David Carroll of Broadway's hit "Grand 
Hotel." Carroll, nominated for a Tony, hopes to be up and about in time for the 
award ceremonies on June 3. Rex Smith, once a teen heartthrob, is fast becoming 
a stage veteran, with "The Pirates of Penzance," "The Human Comedy" and a 
national tour of "Anything Goes" under his belt. 
</P>
<P>
NORA DUNN and Sinead O'Connor are indeed women of principle. However, by 
standing up for their convictions (that they did not want to appear on 
"Saturday Night Live" with the sewer-mouthed Andrew Dice Clay) they gave the 
object of their objections millions of dollars worth of free publicity. 
</P>
<P>
People who had never heard, or were only vaguely aware of ADC, tuned in by the 
thousands to find out what the fuss was all about.

Already missing the world's top four players, the Italian Open men's tennis 
championships almost lost its top seed in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
American Brad Gilbert survived a disastrous first set and an eye problem, then 
benefited from a rain delay to defeat Jim Pugh, 1-6, 6-4, 6-4, at the Foro 
Italico today. 
</P>
<P>
In other matches involving seeded players, No. 4 Emilio Sanchez of Spain beat 
Andrew Sznajder of Canada, 6-2, 6-1; No. 5 Jay Berger defeated Amos Mansdorf of 
Israel, 3-6, 6-1, 6-0, and No. 12 Guillermo Perez-Roldan of Argentina edged 
Ronald Agenor of Haiti, 6-7, 6-2, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
No. 3 Andres Gomez of Ecuador faced Yannick Noah of France in a night match. 
</P>
<P>
French Open champion Michael Chang, the No. 7 seed, had been scheduled to play 
Jan Gunnarsson of Sweden, but the match was pushed back to Tuesday because of 
the rain delay. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert, ranked No. 5 in the world, became the top seed after organizers failed 
to attract Boris Becker, Stefan Edberg and Andre Agassi. Top-ranked Ivan Lendl, 
who won the title here two years ago, has vowed not to return because of the 
boisterous crowds. 
</P>
<P>
In the first set, many may have wondered why Gilbert had been seeded at all. 
Looking lost on the slow red clay, he fell behind, 5-0, prompting whistles of 
disgust from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pugh, who played at UCLA, hit his two-handed forehand and backhand 
with confidence and volleyed with the finesse that has made him one of the top 
doubles players in the world. 
</P>
<P>
When Gilbert broke for 5-1, he threw up his arms in mock triumph. The match was 
interrupted at that point because of rain. 
</P>
<P>
During the 90-minute delay, Gilbert received treatment on his right eye from 
ATP trainer Bill Norris. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a bite or an infection," Gilbert said. "I woke up this morning and it 
was all swollen. Bill did some really good work on it during the delay and my 
vision was better when I came back." 
</P>
<P>
When the match resumed, Pugh broke serve at love to win the first set. But 
Gilbert broke back to open the second set and fought his way back into the 
match. 
</P>
<P>
"The rain definitely helped me," he said. "When I came back I played more 
patiently. Maybe if we hadn't stopped for the rain I would have lost in 
straight sets. This way with the delay I had time to think and regroup a 
little." 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert cut down his errors, scored a decisive break to go up 5-4, and served 
out the second set. 
</P>
<P>
The pattern was repeated in the third set as Gilbert broke for a 5-4 lead, 
hitting back-to-back passing shots. He served out the match at 15. 
</P>
<P>
"Three years ago I probably would have lost this match," said Gilbert, playing 
his first European clay tournament since 1987. "When I had to play on clay I 
would talk myself into losing. Now I play more relaxed."

Maryland basketball Coach Gary Williams was arrested and charged with drunk 
driving, further adding to the problems of a basketball program that is still 
reeling from harsh NCAA sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland State Police spokesman Edwin Lashley said Williams was stopped on the 
Capital Beltway about 1:50 a.m. Saturday after a trooper noticed his car 
weaving among traffic lanes. 
</P>
<P>
Trooper Christopher Sasse followed Williams for about a mile before stopping 
him, Lashley said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, 45, failed a roadside sobriety test and another test given at the 
Rockville barracks, Washington television station WUSA-TV reported Sunday. In 
Maryland, the standard for driving while intoxicated is a blood-alcohol level 
of at least .10. 
</P>
<P>
Williams guided Maryland to a 19-14 record in his first season. The school is 
appealing a three-year probation by the NCAA for recruiting violations under 
former Coach Bob Wade. The sanctions include a ban on postseason play for the 
next two years, causing several players to announce their intention to 
transfer.

Nicholson, 63, spent 26 years as Central Washington's head coach, and is 17th 
on the all-time college coaching victory list with a record of 609-219. But it 
took the player-payment scandal to push him into the professional coaching 
ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson resigned April 2, the same day a university auditor revealed that he 
distributed more than $65,000 earned by his basketball camps to 49 players over 
the last three years. A report by a state auditor covering Central's athletic 
program is expected to be released this week.
