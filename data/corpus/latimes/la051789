NEWSMAKERS: FOR STUDENTS, A GROUP EFFORT BECOMES AN ENDEAVOUR

President Bush had lots of company as he saluted the nation's space effort. "We 
are gathered here today to celebrate the continuity of our space program and 
really of our country itself, of America herself," Bush said as he shared a 
White House stage with five shuttle astronauts, nine fifth-graders and nine 
junior and senior high school students. The astronauts were David M. Walker, 
Ronald J. Grabe, Norman E. Thagard, Mark C. Lee and Mary L. Cleave, who 
returned May 8 from a four-day mission aboard the shuttle Atlantis. The 18 
students, nine each from Senatobia Middle School in Senatobia, Miss., and 
Tallulah Falls School in Tallulah Falls, Ga., had submitted the winning name, 
Endeavour, for the shuttle being built to replace Challenger, which exploded in 
1986. Endeavour, which will have the British spelling, was the name of the 
flagship used by 18th-Century English explorer James Cook. Bush said that more 
than 6,100 teams formed by 71,650 students submitted research projects 
supporting proposed names for the shuttle. Education agency panels picked state 
winners and Bush made the final selection. 
</P>
<P>
 -- President Bush's eldest son, George W. Bush, is trying to decide whether to 
mind his mother. The younger Bush, speaking to the Austin Young Republicans, 
said he is still mulling over a run for Texas governor, even though his mother, 
Barbara, has advised him to stick to running the Texas Rangers baseball team 
that he bought into recently. "For 42 years my mother has been giving me 
advice," he said. "I've listened to her about 10% of the time." 
</P>
<P>
 -- TV viewers in Tennessee are laying odds that their governor, Ned McWherter, 
won't be looking for a sure bet any time soon. McWherter has taken a public 
stand against legalized gambling in his state but WTVF, a Nashville television 
station, showed film of him making wagers with friends at a steeplechase race. 
"I guess the governor ought not to be out here," he told the station after 
tucking his money into a shirt pocket. "I just try to be like the average 
citizen." McWherter likened his betting at the race to office pools on the 
World Series or the Kentucky Derby. SHIRLEY MARLOW

SCHOOL BOARD TAKES STEP TOWARD A HEALTH CLINIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A school-based health and social service clinic was approved in concept late 
Tuesday night to serve public schools in the East San Diego neighborhoods 
around Hoover High. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-2 favorable vote by the San Diego Unified School District board of 
trustees followed almost five hours of debate, at times highly emotional and 
centering on pregnancy counseling and contraception. 
</P>
<P>
The decision directs Hoover administrators to set up a broadly representative 
committee of parents and community leaders in the Mid-City area to design a 
detailed plan with a menu of specific medical services, draw up a contract for 
a clinic operator and obtain money from private national foundations that 
support such clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Those specifics, which could require as much as a year to fully develop, would 
then come back to the school board for final approval before a clinic could 
open. The clinic would be at Hoover but would serve all kindergarten through 
12th-grade students in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Board members Susan Davis, Ann Armstrong and Shirley Weber supported the 
proposal, which was brought to the board Tuesday by a smaller committee of 
Hoover teachers and parents seeking to improve student health and counseling at 
Hoover, its feeder junior high, and seven elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees Jim Roache and Kay Davis voted no. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alternative Proposal Fails 
</P>
<P>
Roache and Davis also failed to win support for an alternative proposal that 
would have prevented the committee from considering family-planning or 
reproductive services, including prescriptions for birth-control medications 
and other devices -- with or without parental permission. The potential for 
such services at a clinic, no matter how small a proportion of total services, 
was the focus of almost all opponents of the concept. 
</P>
<P>
The board majority said they did not want to rule out those services in advance 
of detailed discussions within the Hoover community, where preliminary surveys 
have shown support for some form of counseling for family problems and 
referrals on pregnancy and sexual issues. 
</P>
<P>
But the approval Tuesday night included language added by Weber that mandates 
parent involvement in the planning and administration of a clinic as well as 
parent approval for any type of medical or counseling service before a student 
would be eligible. 
</P>
<P>
After the vote, Weber said she wants the Hoover community to come up with new 
ideas for counseling, especially in the area of sexual education and pregnancy 
matters, that differ from those now followed in most community- and 
school-based health centers around the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I want them to do something different, that just doesn't duplicate what is 
done on the outside now, such as by Planned Parenthood," Weber said. "I don't 
know what that might be, but I want them to try." 
</P>
<P>
Weber suggested that the clinic tailor counseling and mental-health services 
along the lines of those put into effect by Yale psychiatrist James Comer in 
schools in New Haven, Conn. The so-called Comer model uses social workers and a 
psychologist to bring parents and students together, assuming that improved 
academic performance follows active parent or family participation in the 
workings of a school. 
</P>
<P>
Weber left open the question of whether she and the board would limit 
reproductive services if a final proposal were to include them. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the vote left opponents crestfallen after hours of vitriolic 
testimony, although many had feared an unfavorable outcome. Joan Patton, a 
prominent spokeswoman for anti-abortion groups in San Diego, said the board 
showed its preference for birth control by rejecting the Roache alternative. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal followed half a year of preparation by the Hoover committee. In a 
student survey last October, more than half said they have no regular health 
care. The Hoover nurse sees an average of 1,000 students a month, but can only 
diagnose and refer for most medical problems. Of students in the area, 54% of 
their families receive welfare and many are unable to afford private doctors or 
even public clinic care. 
</P>
<P>
The Hoover committee also conducted a one-page mail survey of 8,000 parents 
with children at Hoover, at Wilson Middle School and at the seven elementary 
schools in the neighborhood. Of the 17% of parents who returned surveys, 93% 
supported the concept for a health and social service center for kindergarten 
through 12th-grade students as long as the school requires parental consent for 
general use. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Support of Parents 
</P>
<P>
Parental majorities in the 90% range at both the elementary and secondary 
levels approved proposed services for counseling on job opportunities; 
police-related problems and drug and alcohol concerns; medical care for 
illnesses and injuries; physical exams, immunizations and medications, and 
referrals for specialized medical and dental care. 
</P>
<P>
In the two most controversial areas of services, more than 80% of parents at 
the secondary level approved the idea of counseling for family problems and 
providing information about pregnancy and sexual problems, and necessary 
referrals. Two-thirds of the parents at both Hoover and Wilson approved the 
idea of providing contraceptives to their children. 
</P>
<P>
A proposal initiated three years ago by schools Supt. Tom Payzant for 
school-based clinics as a districtwide policy was turned down, 3 to 2, by a 
previous board of trustees after a bitter battle that abortion opponents turned 
into a debate over the morality of providing family-planning counseling to 
teen-agers.

FPPC PROBING DUFFY'S REPORT OF LAWSUIT LOAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Fair Political Practices Commission has opened a formal inquiry into 
whether San Diego County Sheriff John Duffy properly reported a $36,000 loan 
from three close supporters to cover his costs in a lawsuit over the ouster of 
Rose Elizabeth Bird as chief justice of California. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got an open file," Sandra Michioku, spokeswoman for the FPPC in 
Sacramento, said Tuesday. "We're going to review it. But there's no 
determination yet whether there's been a violation of law." 
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether Duffy attempted to circumvent state law by omitting the 
loan from his 1988 Statement of Economic Interests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Report Quickly Amended After Inquiries 
</P>
<P>
He filed that report March 24, then quickly amended it to reflect the loan once 
a newspaper reporter began interviewing the three lenders. 
</P>
<P>
While the FPPC is reviewing whether any civil violations were committed by 
Duffy, the county district attorney's office announced Tuesday that it has 
decided not to pursue a criminal investigation into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"We have looked at the statement," said Steve Casey, a spokesman for the 
district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"We have looked at the document and the amendment. And we're sending a letter 
to the FPPC stating that at this time we see no basis for us to conduct a 
criminal investigation and that we don't propose to do so." 
</P>
<P>
Casey added that his office would rethink a criminal investigation only if the 
FPPC turned up information suggesting criminal wrongdoing. "We then obviously 
would reconsider," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Maximum Penalty of $2,000 per Infraction 
</P>
<P>
Michioku refused to discuss specifics about the FPPC investigation, except to 
say it could be one to two months before it is completed. Should Duffy be found 
guilty of violating state reporting laws, he would face a maximum penalty of a 
$2,000 fine for each infraction. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy could not be reached for comment Tuesday. A sheriff's secretary said he 
was in Sacramento attending a law enforcement ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff and one of his lieutenants, John Tenwolde, were ordered to pay the 
$36,000 in legal fees after losing a lawsuit filed by the American Civil 
Liberties Union that accused them of improperly using deputy sheriffs to pass 
out cards urging the removal of Bird. 
</P>
<P>
To pay those fees, they obtained the $36,000 loan from three members of the San 
Diego County Honorary Deputy Sheriff's Assn. -- William Cowling II, Charles 
Cono and the late Arthur Bloom. 
</P>
<P>
Cowling and Cono, in interviews last month, insisted that the loan must be 
repaid in one lump sum in July.

SUPERVISORS ACT ON PANEL TO REVIEW JAIL DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reacting to complaints about procedures for reviewing jail deaths, the San 
Diego County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday took the first step toward 
establishing an independent panel of medical specialists to investigate inmate 
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
By a unanimous vote, the supervisors moved tentatively toward the creation of 
an eight-member Jail Medical Audit Committee to investigate the circumstances 
surrounding jail deaths, as well as to review medical treatment in the jails. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Administrative Officer Norman Hickey estimates that the medical panel 
will cost $100,000 annually, and the supervisors decided to defer consideration 
of the proposal until they begin deliberations on the county's fiscal 1990 
budget later this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Even that relatively modest amount -- seemingly insignificant in contrast to 
the county's overall $1.3-billion budget -- could pose difficulties because of 
severe economic constraints, county administrators emphasize. 
</P>
<P>
From 1983 to 1988, there were 28 deaths in local jails, according to a report 
prepared by Hickey's office. Of those, the county coroner's office attributed 
11 deaths to natural causes, 10 to suicide, 6 to accidents and 1 to homicide. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department now has the primary responsibility for investigating 
jail deaths, with the coroner's office, district attorney, county grand Jury, 
state attorney general and state corrections board also playing roles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increasingly Questioned 
</P>
<P>
However, the objectivity of those investigations has increasingly been 
questioned in recent years, in large measure because of allegations by inmates' 
relatives and others that sheriff's deputies' abuse of prisoners or jail 
officials' negligence contributed to some of the deaths. Critics of the 
existing system argue that it is inherently flawed through a conflict of 
interest stemming from the Sheriff's Department's dual role as operator of the 
jails and investigator of jail deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Those complaints notwithstanding, the county's existing policies "provide a 
sound basis for an independent review" of jail deaths, Assistant Chief 
Administrative Officer David Janssen told the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Under Hickey's proposal, that independent review would be conducted by a board 
consisting of a surgeon, internist, emergency physician, a nurse, the county 
pathologist and coroner and the jails' medical director and nurse coordinator. 
In addition to enhancing the credibility of jail-death investigations, the 
panel's studies could be used to recommend corrective action or policy changes, 
Hickey said. 
</P>
<P>
To further improve the process, Hickey has recommended that the supervisors 
adopt procedures, recently proposed by the Grand Jury, to expand the district 
attorney's role in the investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Susan Golding, who requested the study reviewed Tuesday, praised 
Hickey's proposal for the independent medical board, even while agreeing that, 
because of the county's tight finances, it should not be reviewed in isolation 
from the rest of the budget. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm more convinced than ever that an independent investigation is needed," 
Golding said.

Three protesters tried to chain themselves to a bridge Tuesday to delay 
departure of the guided missile cruiser Vincennes. 
</P>
<P>
Police stopped them, and the drawbridge was raised, allowing the ship to leave 
for San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer the Vincennes mistakenly shot down an Iranian airliner over the 
Persian Gulf, killing 290 people. 
</P>
<P>
The ship was in Portland as part of an anti-drug program involving 
schoolchildren. Paul Kerchum said he and other protesters objected to the 
message that "it's OK to murder hundreds of people, as long as you are not on 
drugs."

Five reputed gang members are in custody in connection with the shooting last 
week of Paul Holmes, a Southeast San Diego resident who was listed in good 
condition Tuesday at Mercy Hospital, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Police on Monday arrested a 17-year-old boy and 19-year-old Jovee Smallwood. 
Three other suspects, 18-year-old Andy Villareal, a 17-year-old juvenile and a 
15-year-old juvenile, were arrested last week, but Smallwood is believed to be 
the triggerman, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The youths had gone to the Holmes residence in the 300 block of Northgate 
Street on May 8 to visit Holmes' son. Police said Holmes' son went outside but, 
when an argument ensued, Paul Holmes called his son back inside. As the door 
closed, four shots were fired, all of them hitting Paul Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Dave Cohen said investigators believe all five suspects are 
gang members. A search of Smallwood's residence in the 3900 block of Birch 
Street and another residence in the 200 block of 19th Street turned up several 
guns, including a .22-caliber pistol believed to have been used in the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
The five are expected to be charged with attempted murder, assault with a 
deadly weapon and conspiracy to commit assault, Cohen said. Smallwood also was 
being held on suspicion of possessing a stolen gun.

A discussion about global security among researchers from China, the Soviet

$235,803 grant from the Ford Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The University of California Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation,

specialists from each country in a series of three annual meetings. The first 
conference will be held in Beijing in October, followed by successive meetings 
in Moscow and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The goal is to come up with a framework for the three governments to consider

A former resident of a downtown hotel who allegedly set the place on fire two 
years ago, causing one death and $1 million in damage, has been sentenced to 
six years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
William Forrest Hughes, 35, received credit for the two years and two months he 
has spent in jail and in a mental hospital since his arrest in the March 21, 
1987, fire at the Las Flores Hotel on 4th Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Major Garrett, 54, who was asleep at the time of fire, died of smoke 
inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes was found mentally incompetent to stand trial in 1987 and was remanded 
to Patton State Hospital until earlier this year, when psychiatrists determined 
that he had regained his mental competence. 
</P>
<P>
He pleaded innocent by reason of insanity and went on trial for murder and 
arson in February. However, a jury deadlocked, 11-1, for acquittal and a 
mistrial was declared. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than face a retrial, Hughes pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter, 
and the other charges were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Superior Court Judge Jesus Rodriguez also fined Hughes $500.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CHULA VISTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charges against a woman who allegedly helped her boyfriend, who had been 
wounded by police, escape from a Chula Vista hospital were dismissed Monday by 
a judge. 
</P>
<P>
The charges of kidnaping against Teresa Reyes, 24, of San Ysidro, were dropped 
after Jon Lowry, a former security guard at the hospital, refused to testify, 
citing his 5th Amendment right not to incriminate himself. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the Jan. 29 incident, Lowry told police that Reyes was visiting 
her boyfriend, Michael Valadez, 27, of Spring Valley, in the hospital where he 
was recuperating from a gunshot wound suffered during a drug raid. 
</P>
<P>
Lowry told authorities at the time that Reyes said she had a bomb in a sack and 
forced him to drive Valadez and her to Tijuana. He said he saw exposed wires in 
the sack and did not look further. 
</P>
<P>
At Reyes' preliminary hearing Monday, Deputy Dist. Atty. George Bennett moved 
to dismiss the case, saying that Lowry was the only witness to the kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Municipal Judge Richard Hanscom granted the request. 
</P>
<P>
Lowry said he wanted immunity before testifying, but Bennett would not offer 
it. Lowry had worked as a security guard for Wackenhut Corp., but quit several 
days after the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Valadez was sentenced May 8 to six years in prison on the escape charge and two 
drug charges.

Thomas' column points to a disturbing trend in our culture, that of 
substituting a more palatable reality for the truth. Children don't do this,

truth and not shy away from it. Thanks for running this column. Thomas

CAL THOMAS ON ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I want to express how pleased I was by the Cal Thomas column regarding Carrie 
Walker's science project on abortion ("Youngsters Get Uncomfortably Close to 
the Truth of Why the Baby Is in the Bottle," Op-Ed Page, May 1). 
</P>
<P>
At the age of 19, I got involved in some irresponsible sex and became pregnant. 
I was but a freshman in college with plans of studying abroad and other goals 
typical of bright girls who go looking for love and acceptance in this supposed 
sexual revolution -- but, wind up finding out it was mostly lust. My parents 
offered the best support they could. My dad even offered to fly me to Colorado 
for an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
My son is now 20. Recently he shared with me that there had been a debate on 
his college campus on the pros and cons of abortion. I shared with him that 
California had not always had abortion clinics. He asked me what I thought 
about abortion. Because he is aware that he doesn't live with his biological 
father, I, for the first time, asked him if he was glad to be alive. To which, 
he smiled broadly and replied, "Yes, of course." 
</P>
<P>
Then I had to admit to him that I had considered, only briefly, the possibility 
of aborting him. 
</P>
<P>
I thank God I chose to respect the right of his life to have its expression. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone should keep their babies. There are 1 million infertile couples 
who suffer in painful loneliness longing to fill their arms with a baby. I'm 
concerned about teens keeping their babies -- in many instances, a carefully 
planned adoption would be preferable. 
</P>
<P>
But babies are a sign of life and hope, they are the future. I hope America 
stops this blood bath in the name of liberating women. Maybe we need to start 
talking about responsible sex, what's best for unplanned babies and 
out-of-wedlock moms with a commitment to our future instead of abortion on 
demand today. 
</P>
<P>
To have known my son, is to have an experience in wonder. Yes, my dear child, 
they kill the baby to put it in a jar.

DELAY TACTICS BY ATTORNEYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Ingenious Tactics by Attorneys May Offset Long Odds," by Edwin 
Chen, Part I, April 30: 
</P>
<P>
A potentially informative and interesting article with regard to the 
difficulties faced by defense attorneys in criminal cases was tainted by Chen's 
selection of cynical comments from some "experts" and reliance on undocumented 
slanders. In particular, I refer to his statement, "Another pervasive defense 
tactic is to delay a case endlessly." He does not explore the legitimate need 
of defense lawyers to seek sufficient time to investigate their cases and 
prepare appropriate legal motions; he implies that their purpose is to allow 
witnesses to die, memories to fade and evidence to be lost. 
</P>
<P>
I have practiced criminal defense for over 20 years. In that time I have 
lectured others on criminal law, listened to experts on criminal law, taught 
criminal law, headed a public defender law office, served as president of the 
California Public Defenders Assn., and in general been constantly immersed in 
the practice and theory of criminal defense in California. I have never taught 
nor have I been taught that a continuance for the purposes he notes is proper 
or to be sought. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the next time you decide to deal with this subject your reporters will 
talk to the ordinary, overburdened trial lawyers, especially those in the 
public defender practice. What you will find is that they have more cases than 
can be reasonably handled at any one time; that there are not enough courtrooms 
to begin to try every case that the prosecution files; that some prosecutors 
overfile cases with the sole purpose of forcing pleas; that some of their 
defendants are not guilty and that many are not guilty of the crime charged; 
that cases move very fast and that there is already precious little time and 
resources to prepare the defense to a case which may have been put together 
over weeks or months by police, prosecution and other personnel. 
</P>
<P>
It might also be worth your examining the motives of the attorneys who 
represent the indigent defendant. We get no more money for acquittals, we get 
no less business if we are in trial a lot. While we may be less quotable than 
the media stars you cite, we are a lot closer to the truth of the system, and 
we know that if it were not for the efforts of a few dedicated defenders of the 
criminally accused all citizens would have less freedom than they now enjoy.

DRUNK DRIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has been just over three weeks since my younger brother, Alan, was killed in 
a head-on car collision with a drunk driver. Three college students died and 
two were hospitalized in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The first newspaper that I picked up upon resuming normal activities had 
headlines of a legally-drunk woman running down several teen-agers and killing 
three of them. This springtime has also had a rash of deaths involving young 
people who are drinking and driving. 
</P>
<P>
Our family suffered great personal loss and society suffers staggering 
financial costs due to drinking and driving. We, as a society, bear part of the 
responsibility for these deaths. We allow alcoholics to drive on our roads and 
kill our families. 
</P>
<P>
I have read that in Sweden a first offense for driving after drinking requires 
a mandatory 6-month jail sentence. This has not solved their alcohol problems, 
however, I understand that they have greatly reduced their drunk-driving 
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most vocal group for tougher laws against drunk driving is MADD 
(Mothers Against Drunk Driving). 
</P>
<P>
Prior to my brother's death, I was too busy to be involved with MADD. Must we 
all lose a loved one before we get involved? 
</P>
<P>
I urge your support of MADD, as well as any local, state or federal legislation 
to strengthen drunk-driving laws. Finally, start with yourself: Don't drink and 
drive; don't let your friends drive after drinking.

I cannot believe what I have just read. The article by Thomas was very 
upsetting.

Is there no law requiring proper disposal of all tissue removed from humans? I 
had miscarriages followed by D&amp;Cs, and I was assured all material was 
disposed of properly and respectfully. The material was supplied to the young 
girl by her uncle who was a pathologist. Is that proper and respectful 
disposal?

NATIONS OF THE HEMISPHERE FIND COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY TESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By L. RONALD SCHEMAN, L. Ronald Scheman, former assistant secretary of the 
Organization of American States, practices law in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the tragic events in Panama move the United States toward a historic 
confrontation, the moment has arrived for the nations of the Americas to act 
through the Organization of American States. 
</P>
<P>
There is no ambiguity about the current issues. Gen. Manuel A. Noriega tried to 
use the instruments of democracy to mock democracy. He failed. His failure has 
been witnessed by the entire world. Exit polls conducted under the auspices of 
the Roman Catholic church have affirmed the will of the Panamanian people in 
favor of the opposition candidate, Guillermo Endara. Two former U.S. 
Presidents, Republican Gerald R. Ford and Democrat Jimmy Carter, have confirmed 
the observations of all election observers that a clumsy election fraud was 
perpetrated. The outrageous brutality of last week, attacking the opposition 
leaders and other people with steel rods and iron pipes, demonstrates that the 
Panamanian military, led by Gen. Noriega, is at war with its own people. The 
aggression is as real as the more traditional aggressions by other states, only 
in this case it is by another, more insidious foe, an international drug Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
The nations of the Americas know that the United States has vital national 
interests in Panama. They are real and deeply felt. But it is no longer only 
the Panama Canal. Two other issues give the tragedy its full meaning: drugs and 
democracy. Given the circumstances, President Bush has done well with his 
measured response in order to give the nations of the hemisphere time to accept 
regional responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Democracies in Latin America are especially vulnerable to armies with guns. 
Unless they show resolve, no democracy is safe. In this case, we are in direct 
confrontation with one of the major drug criminals in the world who holds an 
entire nation hostage. Past Latin American hesitancy to countenance 
intervention in internal matters meets a severe test in the unique 
circumstances in Panama. A coherent hemispheric policy in favor of democracy in 
which all of the nations participate is the best protection that Latin America 
could have against unilateral action. 
</P>
<P>
This is the role for the Organization of American States. Unless it stands for 
hemispheric cooperation in defense of freedom and democracy, it stands for 
nothing. The words of its charter couldn't be clearer. "The true significance 
of American solidarity . . . can only mean the consolidation on this continent 
. . . of democratic institutions, of a system of individual liberty and social 
justice based on respect for the essential rights of man . . . The solidarity 
of the American States and the high aims which are sought through it require 
the political organization of those States on the basis of representative 
democracy." 
</P>
<P>
The Rio Treaty is equally unequivocal. It states that "the American regional 
community affirms . . . that peace is founded on . . . the international 
recognition and protection of human rights and freedoms . . . and on the 
effectiveness of democracy for the international realization of justice and 
security." It adds that "the obligation of mutual assistance . . . is 
essentially related to their democratic ideals." 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to popular mythology, the nations of the hemisphere have repeatedly 
taken firm action for democracy when faced with blatant abuse of power. Ten 
years ago, through the OAS, they took the courageous step to condemn the 
dictatorship of Nicaragua's Anastasio Somoza by clearly asking him to step 
down. They did the same in the case of the military coup in Bolivia a year 
later. Throughout the 1970s, the OAS was the major force to focus attention on 
human rights abuses in the hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
Today, as President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela has recognized in his call 
for hemispheric action, the OAS has been given another chance. All the rules 
and the precedents are in place. It is the nations of the hemisphere that bear 
a heavy responsibility. The OAS is but an euphemism. It is the American 
governments themselves, nothing more, nothing less. The challenge is whether 
they are prepared to deal with serious issues on a multilateral basis. Will 
they move to affirm their commitment to democracy in substance as well as in 
rhetoric? From the Latin American point of view, the United States could not 
have adopted a better stance to give them time to do what they have always 
claimed they were ready to do. 
</P>
<P>
A wide range of measures -- diplomatic, economic and political -- are available 
to help force Noriega from power. It would be difficult for anyone to criticize 
action to fulfill the will of the Panamanian people and place in power the 
president they have honestly elected. In recent years, the people of all the 
nations of the Americas have repeatedly staked their lives to affirm their 
commitment to democracy. The OAS will not get a better second chance.

GRAPPLING WITH A SPORT THAT THRIVES ON FAKERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD CAPLAN, Gerald Caplan is a professor of law at George Washington 
University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I recently escorted four boys to watch an evening of professional wrestling. 
Although we had purchased our tickets well in advance, we nonetheless waited in 
line for 45 minutes. The body frisks and metal detectors at the entrances, more 
than the boisterous sellout crowd, caused the delay. 
</P>
<P>
There is much that is unappealing about wrestling in its current resurgence -- 
enough to induce nostalgia for Gorgeous George and his perfumed coiffure and 
the more-innocent fakery of the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
First, there is the racial and ethnic stereotyping. It would be unacceptable in 
any other public forum. One female wrestler is the Syrian Terrorist, another, 
in battle fatigues, is Palestina. Mr. Fuji, in black suit and bow tie, is a 
"sinister Oriental" manager who teaches his proteges dirty tricks. Slick is a 
frenetic, jive-talking black manager who jitterbugs about the ring inciting the 
audience to jeering. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the fans. Many are well-mannered and some are as orderly as if 
at the opera. But for others, unruly is a generous characterization. On their 
feet, yelling obscenities, enthralled by the ring violence (though not quite 
drooling), they are reminiscent of the scary crowds that gathered about our 
embassies a few years back. Incredibly, many seem to believe that the 
well-rehearsed, carefully staged ring acrobatics are for real. 
</P>
<P>
Part of wrestling's appeal, it is said, lies in the continuous reenactment of 
good triumphing over evil. In that the fans have their favorites, and the 
favorites typically prevail, this is true. But it is not easy to tell the good 
guys from the bad guys by their behavior. The wrestling hero is a braggart who, 
strutting and preening, shows no inclination to follow the rules or obey the 
referee. As readily as the villain, he will bite, pull hair or deck the 
official. Such behavior may hold special delight for boys, a delicious antidote 
to rules of decorum taught at home and school, but it has nothing to do with 
fair play or sportsmanship. In wrestling, rules really are made to be broken. 
</P>
<P>
The boys I transport know that the combat in the ring is fake. Orchestration is 
a given. But, regretfully, they do not disdain a thunderous-looking fall simply 
because it is the product of collaboration, or because fear, pain or rage are 
simulated. They are attracted to wrestling precisely because they can 
anticipate the structure of the fight. That the same wrestlers can be depended 
upon to execute the same duet, follow the same script, and suffer the same 
"disabling" injuries is part of the appeal. Reality must be suspended, but the 
boys can do it. Theatrics are scorned only when it is clear that the blow was 
not struck, an eye not gouged, a leg not mangled -- that is, when the acting is 
not up to par. Then the fantasy is exposed. 
</P>
<P>
For young children, the experience may be different. They may need assurance 
that the ring violence only looks real, that serious injury is neither sought 
nor characteristic, that once the matches are over, the wrestlers, fit as ever, 
will drive off together in their Mercedeses to their next rendezvous. 
</P>
<P>
But the older ones are there for the blood. Linked to the 1980s by its peculiar 
mixture of violence, vulgarity and fakery, wrestling is no transient novelty or 
accidental offspring of our culture. We can expect another generation of 
wrestlers to emerge from the shadows of such performers as Abdullah the 
Butcher, the Mongolian Stomper, Kamala, the Uganda Headhunter or Dr. Death and 
take their turn in the ring. And our children will bring their children to 
watch them perform, reliving their boyhood days in all their lack of innocence.

THERE'S SOLID PRECEDENT IN SEEKING OAS CONSENSUS ON ISOLATING NORIEGA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANTINE C. MENGES, Constantine C. Menges, resident scholar at the 
American Enterprise Institute, was responsible for Latin America as a former 
special assistant to President Ronald Reagan. His latest book is Inside the 
National Security Council (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1988). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1984, Panama joined the many other Latin American countries that made the 
transition from military rule to constitutional democracy during the Ronald 
Reagan years. 
</P>
<P>
But in September, 1985, Gen. Manuel A. Noriega forced his country's elected 
president to resign -- the first step back from the movement toward democracy 
in Latin America. As a member of the national security staff in the Reagan 
White House, I was unsuccessful in efforts to bring this issue before the 
President. Yet I believed then, as I do today, that the failure to help the 
people of Panama restore democracy would cause ever graver crises involving 
larger human and strategic costs in the future. 
</P>
<P>
After this month's fraudulent elections and the accompanying violence against 
opposition leaders, President Bush should use the full resources of the United 
States to help the people of Panama restore democracy. He has a bipartisan 
consensus about the facts in Panama in support of his initial diplomatic and 
military steps. 
</P>
<P>
The objective now should be the removal of Noriega and his clique of 
collaborators with the installation of the newly elected government of the 
Panamanian democratic opposition. The United States should take the lead to 
accomplish this through the collective security instruments of the Organization 
of American States. 
</P>
<P>
The first step would be a quiet process of briefing and persuasion in order to 
build a consensus among a two-thirds majority of the 32 OAS members. After that 
consensus has been obtained informally -- and with competent diplomacy this can 
be done quickly -- the issues should be presented for formal action by the OAS. 
</P>
<P>
There is an important precedent, which was undertaken by the Jimmy Carter 
Administration in 1979. At that time, the OAS decided that due to the "conduct 
of the dictatorial regime governing the country . . . the spirit of hemispheric 
solidarity . . . places an unavoidable obligation on the American countries to 
. . . bring about the immediate and definitive replacement of the . . . regime 
(with the) installation . . . of a democratic government . . ." Those words 
resulted in the total isolation of the Anastasio Somoza regime in Nicaragua. 
They should be applied to the Noriega dictatorship today. And, also following 
the 1979 precedent, OAS diplomatic recognition should be conferred on a 
Panamanian government that represents the democratic aspirations of the people. 
</P>
<P>
With those steps having been taken and virtually all OAS member states having 
isolated Noriega diplomatically and economically, efforts should then be made 
to persuade our allies in the Atlantic Alliance and other key Free World 
countries to do the same. With some creativity, it is possible to find ways of 
channeling economic help through the Panamanian liberation government to the 
people of Panama -- especially the poorest -- so that it is the Noriega regime 
that bears the principal weight of this political and economic isolation. 
</P>
<P>
With these first collective security measures in place, there should be a final 
offer to Noriega and his clique. In the interest of avoiding further disruption 
and possible violence, Noriega and his faction could resign with the promise 
that there would be no retribution, prosecution or confiscation of their 
current property holdings now or at any time in the future. 
</P>
<P>
If that last offer is rejected, then the Bush Administration must be prepared 
to take all necessary means to help the people of Panama -- including the 
sensible majority of the Panamanian military -- accomplish the objectives of 
the OAS resolution and restore democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to act until democracy is restored will consign the courageous people 
of Panama to servitude under a Noriega regime that month by month has been 
moving closer into the Cuban orbit. Already Cuba provides bodyguards, secret 
police and military personnel who have been training a new, more politically 
reliable (though still small) military force and have been helping Noriega in 
his campaign of repression, harassment of U.S. military personnel and with drug 
smuggling. Unless Bush acts effectively, he risks the chance of Noriega 
becoming the Moammar Kadafi of the Caribbean -- a setback for the cause of 
democracy in this hemisphere and a growing risk to the Panama Canal.

SEARCH OF HOMES YIELDS NO DRUGS IN SCHOOL STEROID CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY BEAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carlsbad police Tuesday searched a house owned by the father of the suspect in 
an alleged high school steroid-peddling operation, but apparently found no 
evidence of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
Four narcotics detectives kicked down the doors of the main house and of two 
cottages behind the house, said the father of Gregory Thomas Tirona, who asked 
that his first name not be used. No one was home at the time, but the father, 
visibly outraged, said police didn't have to kick down doors. 
</P>
<P>
Tirona, a teacher's aide and volunteer basketball coach at Carlsbad High 
School, has been the subject of an investigation by the school district and 
police since May 3, Lt. Don Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Students Came Forward 
</P>
<P>
Police are investigating allegations that Tirona, 31, sold anabolic steroids to 
four athletes at the high school, Lewis said. The students came forward about 
two weeks ago and claimed they had purchased the illegal substance from Tirona. 
</P>
<P>
No charges have been filed against Tirona, who remains on paid administrative 
leave from his position as a teacher's aide, a job he has held since 1985. He 
also was a volunteer girls' basketball coach this year. 
</P>
<P>
Tirona's father said his son did not live at the house, in the 3400 block of 
Valley Street, but used it as a place to have his mail delivered. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives at the house during the search said Tirona's whereabouts were 
unknown Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The father said he came home from work at 4:30 p.m. and was shocked to find 
four plainclothes detectives scouring the main house and dwellings in the back 
after kicking down the front door, which was secured by a dead-bolt lock. 
Detectives also searched the car of the father's younger son, who lives in one 
of the cottages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lamest Excuse I've Heard' 
</P>
<P>
"They said they didn't know if they would encounter a gang or someone else," 
the father said. "That excuse that they didn't know what they were going to 
face is the lamest excuse I've ever heard." 
</P>
<P>
According to the search warrant, detectives seized five items: a tape from the 
father's telephone answering machine, a bottle of codeine, a marijuana 
cigarette from the car of Tirona's younger brother and two bottles of unknown 
medication prescribed to Gregory Tirona. 
</P>
<P>
The father said the medication may have been antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
"Why would a doctor prescribe steroids for him?" he said, adding that he had 
spoken with his son Tuesday morning and was convinced of his innocence after 
discussing the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a talk, and he said that he didn't do it, whatever they suspected him 
of doing." 
</P>
<P>
Police, meanwhile, are releasing little information on the investigation, 
except to say that they have interviewed people involved. Detectives also 
seized documents Tuesday, apparently related to Tirona, from the offices of the 
Carlsbad Unified School District, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
As many as four athletes had bought anabolic steroids off campus grounds, said 
Wayne Rice, Carlsbad High's athletic director. Rice said only one of the 
athletes was a starter in one of the 20 sports at the school.

PORT DISTRICT PUTS LAST HARBOR ISLAND HOTEL SITE UP FOR BIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The last remaining hotel site on Harbor Island was put out to bid Tuesday by 
the Board of Port Commissioners, who hope to have a 400- to 500-room hotel 
built in the tourist-oriented area by October, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The board unanimously agreed to authorize a "request for proposals" from 
developers interested in the last 7.56 acres of available land on one of the 
most alluring San Diego tourist spots. Several hotels, restaurants and marinas 
already occupy the 1 1/2-mile expanse of man-made land. 
</P>
<P>
According to the San Diego Unified Port District's proposed lease, the new 
hotel will have 400-500 rooms, restaurants, cocktail lounges, meeting and 
conference rooms, a swimming pool and tennis courts, and be built on Harbor 
Island East, near a long-term parking lot for the airport. 
</P>
<P>
An adjacent finger of water to the north will be used as a dock for water 
taxis, shuttle boats, boat charters and rentals, and temporary docking for 
hotel and restaurant guests. According to Port District specifications, the 
entire site must be designed to give a park-like appearance. 
</P>
<P>
The Port District also voted unanimously to allow the owners of the adjacent 
Sunroad Resort Marina to bid on the project. Although Sunroad twice expressed 
an interest in submitting a proposal, some commissioners were at first hesitant 
to include Sunroad in the process, fearing that its stronghold in the area 
might scare away bidders. 
</P>
<P>
Allowing Sunroad to bid "might frighten someone away because they might think 
they (Sunroad) have a better chance with a double site," Port Director Don Nay 
said. He later added, jokingly, "I don't think developers are particularly 
timid people," 
</P>
<P>
But Commissioner Louis Wolfsheimer said, "If the language were drafted cleverly 
enough" no one would feel that Sunroad has an unfair advantage. "I think we owe 
Sunroad the option to submit alone or jointly" with other companies, 
Wolfsheimer said, while making sure that Sunroad has "no unfair advantage." 
</P>
<P>
The chosen developer will pay $400,000 for a 15-month option and, after meeting 
all of the Port District's requirements, be granted a 50-year lease. 
</P>
<P>
The development of the tract includes reconstruction of the Harbor Island Drive 
traffic circle, which will be changed into a "T" intersection. Although there 
have been no fatal traffic accidents there, Nay called the circle dangerous.

DEFENSE PUZZLES PROSECUTION; 
</P>
<P>
ACTRESS' SON ADMITTED KILLING HER, ATTORNEY REVEALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Puzzling the prosecution, a defense attorney revealed during a murder trial 
Tuesday that a 25-year-old Encino man had confessed to slaying his mother, 
actress Susan Cabot -- a confession the prosecution was unable to use. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Scott Roman told police he and his mother had been arguing on the night 
of Dec. 10, 1986, when she came at him with a scalpel, Detective Philip 
Quartararo testified in Van Nuys Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Roman told police he took the scalpel from his mother and hit her on the head 
with a dumbbell in self-defense, Quartararo said. "He said he didn't remember 
how many times he hit her," he testified. 
</P>
<P>
Quartararo's testimony came during cross-examination by Roman's attorney, 
Chester Leo Smith. It was the first time in the week-long trial that a witness 
testified that Roman had admitted the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Bradford E. Stone said outside the courtroom that Roman's 
confession was not used by the prosecution because it was offered after the 
defendant had asked to speak to an attorney, which under court rulings made it 
inadmissible. 
</P>
<P>
Stone said he could not explain why Roman's own attorney would want to put the 
confession on the record, unless it was for some unknown tactical reason. 
</P>
<P>
Smith could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Last week jurors heard a tape recording of detectives interviewing Roman about 
the slaying of his 59-year-old mother, a leading actress in 1950s action 
movies. During the 90-minute interview, Roman denied killing his mother. "I had 
nothing to do with it. I swear to God!" he shouted to his interrogators. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Treated at Hospital 
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of the interview, Roman asked to speak with an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Under Smith's questioning, Quartararo testified Tuesday that after Roman was 
interviewed by police he was taken to Humana Hospital-West Hills, where he was 
treated for minor injuries he said were sustained during a fight with a 
burglar. 
</P>
<P>
Police testified earlier that officers found no evidence that anyone had broken 
into the house. 
</P>
<P>
Quartararo said Roman admitted killing his mother after they left the hospital 
and were returning to the Encino home the defendant shared with his mother. At 
the house, Roman showed police where he hid the weapons used during the fight, 
Quartararo testified. The scalpel, a knife and a dumbbell were found inside a 
detergent box in the laundry room, Quartararo said. 
</P>
<P>
Charged with first-degree murder, but without the special conditions that could 
bring the death penalty, Roman faces a possible life term in prison. 
</P>
<P>
He has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. If he is convicted, his 
insanity claim will be heard by the same jury.

LANCASTER VOTES 3-1 TO KEEP ARBITRATION; 
</P>
<P>
MOBILE-HOME RENT ORDINANCE UPHELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Voters in Lancaster's special election Tuesday upheld the city's controls on 
increases in mobile-home rents and rejected a heavily funded campaign by 
mobile-home park owners to abolish all controls on property sales or rents. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition B, backed by the City Council and tenants, which keeps the current 
ordinance providing for arbitration of mobile-home rent disputes, had a clear 
winning margin of 3,472, or 75.3% of the vote, to 1,135, or 24.7%, with all 
votes counted. 
</P>
<P>
A rival measure sponsored by mobile-home park owners, Proposition A, would have 
prohibited city restrictions on sale or rental of property unless the 
restrictions were approved by a vote of the citizens. That proposition went 
down to defeat by a vote of 3,551, or 78.4% of the vote, to 974, or 21.6%. 
</P>
<P>
The two propositions were the only items on the ballot for the special 
election, which drew a turnout of about 4,698, only 12.3% of the city's 38,349 
registered voters, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
George Root, president of the Lancaster Alliance of Mobile Home Park Residents, 
said: "I am extremely pleased. The folks in Lancaster didn't buy all the park 
owners' bull. Their biggest problem was they tried to fool the voters." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lopsided Results 
</P>
<P>
Peter Wanserske, president of the Friends of Lancaster owners group, blamed the 
low voter turnout for the lopsided results. "If there was misinformation, it 
was on both sides," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The election culminated a yearlong battle pitting mobile-home owners against 
mobile-home tenants and the City Council in Lancaster, which has about 4,500 
mobile-home residents in 28 parks and a total population of 82,000. 
</P>
<P>
The present city ordinance permits tenants to challenge proposed rent increases 
and seek the services of an arbitrator through the city if negotiations fail. 
The arbitrator's decisions are binding. 
</P>
<P>
If both ballot initiatives had failed, that ordinance would have stood. If both 
had won, Proposition A would have banned all future caps on rent while 
Proposition B would have permitted continuing arbitration of mobile-home rent 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
Mobile-home park owners spent more than $86,000, a city record, on campaigns 
attacking Proposition B and promoting Proposition A. They said the arbitration 
ordinance could be expanded to other types of property and serve as the first 
step toward citywide rent control, which they said would drain the municipal 
treasury and cause deterioration of neighborhoods and public services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tenants Spent $800 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, tenants spent only $800 on their campaign. They argued that the 
present ordinance provided a fair method of mediating rent disputes and was not 
the beginning of generalized rent control. They had the support of city 
officials, who accused the mobile-home park owners of deceitful campaigning and 
scare tactics. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, City Atty. David McEwen filed a complaint with the Los Angeles 
County district attorney's office that accused the two owner groups -- Friends 
of Lancaster/Yes on A and Lancaster Citizens Committee/No on Proposition B -- 
of violating city law by failing to submit copies of their mass-mailing 
campaign literature to the city.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA CLARITA BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION BACKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Clarita transportation planners will recommend next week that the City 
Council approve building a bridge that has pitted two neighborhoods against 
each other, the city's public works director said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
City planners are still preparing recommendations on when and how the bridge 
would be built, Public Works Director John Medina said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed bridge would cross railroad tracks, San Fernando Road and the 
Santa Clara River to connect Wiley Canyon Road and Via Princessa. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the Circle J housing development say the bridge will provide a 
badly needed second access for their secluded neighborhood. But residents west 
of San Fernando Road say it will bring unwanted traffic into their area. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives from both neighborhoods met with city officials Monday night in 
hopes of negotiating a compromise. But in the end, Medina said, Circle J 
residents still demanded the bridge. The other group still opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Councilman Carl Boyer III has endorsed the bridge, 
calling it a necessary link in the city's overall road system. But the city 
should first spend highway funds on building Rio Vista Road, a proposed 
north-south artery, before constructing the bridge, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The council will consider the issue Tuesday.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL OKS LIMITS ON VAN NUYS APARTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday approved a temporary ordinance 
restricting apartment construction in Van Nuys and northern Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which was unanimously approved, puts tight controls on apartment 
construction while city planners revise the area's community plan this year. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ordinance, which was sent to Mayor Tom Bradley for approval, no 
building permits will be issued for multifamily complexes that are not in 
keeping with the existing community plan. In addition, apartments and 
condominiums cannot be more than 30 feet in height. 
</P>
<P>
The Van Nuys Homeowners Assn. supported the measure, which was introduced by 
Councilman Joel Wachs.

SIDEKICKS RISE UP AND DOWN THE SOCKERS; 
</P>
<P>
DALLAS BREAKS 1-1 TIE WITH THREE CONSECUTIVE GOALS TO TAKE 3-2 SERIES LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
DALLAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There wasn't much left to say. The Sockers have run out of words. 
</P>
<P>
All that's left is a trip home to San Diego. And if the Sockers can't manage to 
beat the Dallas Sidekicks both Thursday and Saturday night, they'll be home to 
stay. No Baltimore, no Wichita, no championship ring. 
</P>
<P>
The Sidekicks pushed the Sockers into a hole Tuesday night at Reunion Arena, 
winning, 4-1, to take a 3-2 advantage in the best-of-seven Major Indoor Soccer 
League semifinal series. It was just a typical Sidekick victory, satisfactory 
but not pretty. 
</P>
<P>
Even less pretty was the scene in the Sockers' locker room minutes after the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Branko Segota was sitting and, most likely, wondering what injury would come up 
next. Earlier this season, it was a hamstring pull. Then he pulled it again. 
And again. 
</P>
<P>
It's still not fully healed. Now, as if that isn't enough, he's running the 
carpet with a bad toe, injured in Saturday's 7-3 loss. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrating? 
</P>
<P>
"It's just irritating," Segota said. Putting a hand on his hamstring he added: 
"There's still a big knot in there." 
</P>
<P>
Looking over a nearly deserted locker room, Socker defender George Fernandez 
was answering a question asked to many of the players: "Is this team capable of 
coming back?" 
</P>
<P>
As a point of reference, it happened last year. The Sockers toppled Kansas City 
in three consecutive games after stumbling to a 3-1 deficit. Also, no MISL team 
with a 3-2 lead has ever won the series. 
</P>
<P>
Nice, but that's in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"Our players just have to wake up and smell the coffee," Fernandez said. "I 
think there are some guys on vacation in the Bahamas already. We've got to get 
our act together. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now I'm pessimistic about this team. It's never happy where you're 
forced into a situation where you have to win." 
</P>
<P>
It's never happy when a guy who finished 45 regular-season games with just 
three goals is your lone scorer, either. That's Gus Mokalis, a defender. He 
tied Tuesday's game at 1-1 taking a pass from Paul Dougherty off the right wall 
and crossing it by Sidekick goalie Joe Papaleo with 5:40 remaining in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
That was it. After that, the Sockers' offense turned in its room keys, paid its 
room service tab and checked out. 
</P>
<P>
Segota was noticeably hobbled, unable to make his usual quick move around the 
defense. Midfielder Brian Quinn isn't near his early-season form, before his 
strained arch injury. And this time, veteran Steve Zungul, the Sockers' biggest 
offensive threat in the playoffs so far, was shut down without a point. 
</P>
<P>
So all that was left after Mokalis' goal was three more opportunities for the 
minuscule crowd of 5,407 to cheer a Sidekicks' goal. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the third quarter, Sidekick midfielder Michael King drilled a shot that 
Socker goalie Victor Nogueira knocked away with a dive to his left. Mark 
Karpun, another Sidekick midfielder, was ready and waiting, driving the ball 
into the net. 
</P>
<P>
Next, in the fourth quarter, after Mokalis turned the ball over, Marcio Leite 
slipped by Waad Hirmez down the middle of the carpet, took a crossing pass from 
Smith and scored, giving Dallas a 3-1 edge. 
</P>
<P>
The final score was an empty-net goal with two seconds remaining by Mark King, 
after the Sockers put in a sixth attacker (Kevin Crow) in favor of Nogueira. 
</P>
<P>
The game went about as planned for Sidekick Coach Billy Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
"We expected a defensive game and that's what we got," he said. "We were 
counting on Joe (Papaleo) to keep them below three goals and for us to score 
our usual four. When those two things happen we usually win. 
</P>
<P>
It could be the Sidekicks have been underestimated all season long. This was 
just a .500 team in the regular season and, save Tatu, who is referred to by 
the Sidekicks' announcer as 'The Fantastic One,' there are no real stars on 
this team. But they keep winning. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to give them credit because they didn't really make an error," Socker 
Coach Ron Newman said. "I think they're playing better than us at the moment. 
We're not showing our true face in this series yet. We don't seem to have 
anything going for us now." 
</P>
<P>
And Dallas, it seems, has everything going for them. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, they're playing good soccer," Crow said. "My hat is off to them."

ANGELS WIN TO GAIN TIE ATOP WEST; 
</P>
<P>
MCCASKILL DEFEATS RED SOX AS BOTH HE, CLUB CONTINUE SURGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
And on May 17, where did you expect the Angels to be? 
</P>
<P>
Face down, maybe? On the outside looking in? At wit's end . . . or at the 
bottom of the American League West standings? 
</P>
<P>
Well, this morning, 38 games into the 1989 baseball season, you can now refer 
to them as the first-place California Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, they share the distinction with the Oakland Athletics and the Kansas 
City Royals, who also own records of 25-13. But considering where the Angels 
have been recently -- last place in '87, 29 games out in '88 -- this is not the 
time to quibble. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night's 7-2 victory over the Boston Red Sox before 26,043 at Anaheim 
Stadium was the Angels' fourth in a row and their 15th in their last 18 games, 
equaling the best start in the club's history. 
</P>
<P>
And, fittingly, Kirk McCaskill, the surprise of all Angel surprises, was the 
winning pitcher. McCaskill, coming off two injury-ravaged seasons, won for the 
fifth time in six decisions, limiting Boston to two runs in eight-plus innings 
before turning matters over to reliever Greg Minton. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, McCaskill stopped the heavy-hitting Red Sox on a night when a bed 
might have suited him better than the pitching mound. McCaskill turned in his 
eight-plus innings while working with a churning stomach, caused by a touch of 
flu. 
</P>
<P>
"The first three innings, I was in a daze," said McCaskill, whose 1.06 
earned-run average remains the best in the American League. "After every 
inning, (Manager Doug Rader) would ask me, 'How do you feel?' and I said I felt 
I could go out there. 
</P>
<P>
"So, he kept putting me out there." 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill hardly dazzled -- he gave up 10 hits and two walks, retiring the side 
in order only once -- but he endured. Were it not for a defensive gaffe by 
Angel left fielder Chili Davis, McCaskill probably would have limited Boston to 
a single run. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox scored their first run in the third inning when Davis misjudged a 
fly ball by Wade Boggs, letting the ball sail over his head for a triple. Boggs 
then scored on a single by Marty Barrett. 
</P>
<P>
Other than that, the only run Boston could manage against McCaskill came in the 
fourth, when Dwight Evans beat out an infield single to deep shortstop and 
scored on a double by Jody Reed. 
</P>
<P>
"Considering he had a stomach virus, I thought he did a remarkable job," Rader 
said. "I wanted him to get through five innings -- and he almost finished the 
game. That's very much to his credit." 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill's surprising stamina also impressed Red Sox Manager Joe Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think he'd last as long as he did," Morgan said. "He looked sneaky as 
hell in the beginning, not as good later, but he hung in there." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, seven runs and 12 hits can make hanging in there an easier 
proposition. The Angels scored on their first at-bat of the game, received four 
RBIs from Johnny Ray and knocked starter Mike Smithson (1-3) out of the game 
before the fourth inning was complete. 
</P>
<P>
Claudell Washington led off the bottom of the first inning with a home run off 
Smithson, his third of the season, giving McCaskill an instant 1-0 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
After Boston forged a momentary 1-1 tie in the top of the third, the Angels 
reclaimed the lead in the bottom of the inning when Washington doubled and 
scored in front of Ray's first home run of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Ray, who also singled in the first inning, added a run-scoring double in the 
fourth inning and drove in a fourth run with a sixth-inning sacrifice fly. 
Despite missing three weeks because of a wrist injury, Ray is tied with Davis 
on the club with 17 RBIs, trailing only Devon White with 22. 
</P>
<P>
Washington added two RBIs and matched Ray's hit output with a home run, a 
double and a single. Wally Joyner contributed a double and a single, Lance 
Parrish had an RBI double and Jack Howell, beginning to show signs of life with 
the bat, added three singles to raise his batting average from .170 to .192. 
</P>
<P>
"Every night, somebody picks up somebody else," Ray said. "Last night, it was 
Devo. It's not one player doing it all -- it's a mix." 
</P>
<P>
And that mix, Ray suggested, is all the more potent, now that the Angels have 
mixed in a few veteran players who have experienced the sensation of winning. 
</P>
<P>
"Claudell, Bert Blyleven, Parrish -- we've got guys who are competitive and 
think they can win," Ray said. "That has an effect on the other players." 
</P>
<P>
It is still early, very early, but so far, that effect has been enough to stir 
a team that sleepwalked through a season-ending 12 consecutive defeats in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"All this means is that we're all playing pretty good," Rader said, trying to 
downplay the three-way tie for first place. "It's too early to get excited 
about that. But we're happy to be in the position we're in." 
</P>
<P>
As they say, it sure beats the alternative, which had been the Angel way ever 
since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tony Armas' comeback lasted all of one day. After spending 35 days on the 
disabled list because of a strained left hamstring, Armas was re-activated for 
Monday's game. He played five innings at first base, long enough to 
re-aggravate the injury. Tuesday, after having the hamstring examined by team 
physician Lewis Yocum, Armas was returned to the 15-day disabled list. The 
Angels recalled first baseman-outfielder Jim Eppard from Edmonton to fill the 
roster vacancy. Angel Manager Doug Rader called Armas' injury "a shame. He 
worked so hard to come back and we tried to put him at a position that would be 
less stressful on his legs. But it was going to happen some time, if that's all 
it took to re-injure it. Evidently, he's had an awful lot of damage in there 
over the years. The degree of scar tissue must be tremendous." Eppard, who 
batted .283 in 56 games with the Angels last year, was hitting .243 with one 
home run and 13 runs batted in this year with Edmonton. He is expected to join 
the club tonight.

Not wanting to risk having another player return to the disabled list, Rader 
kept shortstop Dick Schofield (groin injury) out of the starting lineup. 
Monday, Schofield played four innings in relief of Kent Anderson, but 
complained of more discomfort afterward. "The groin is bothering him again," 
Rader said. "He's probably going to need a couple of days to get over it, once 
and for all. It's nothing serious, but it's enough to be aggravating.". . . 
After undergoing a successful cornea transplant in his right eye, Angel owner 
Gene Autry was released from a hospital Tuesday and is expected to be present 
for tonight's induction of Jim Fregosi in the Angel hall of fame. Fregosi, a 
six-time All-Star shortstop and the first Angel manager to win a division 
championship, becomes the second member of the hall of fame, joining 1988 
inductee Bobby Grich. Angel first base coach Bobby Knoop, Fregosi's double-play 
partner during the 1960s, and KTLA broadcaster Bob Starr will also participate 
in the pregame ceremony.

The first day of the Boston Red Sox's first visit to Anaheim this season wasn't 
entirely a day at the park. Third baseman Wade Boggs spent 3 1/2 hours in 
Irvine with Margo Adams and lawyers, giving depositions in preparation for 
their scheduled trial, while Red Sox teammates spent the day trying to avoid 
getting subpoenaed. Among those targeted by Adams' attorney, James McGee, are 
Jim Rice, Dwight Evans, Rich Gedman, Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd and Marty Barrett. 
McGee claimed Rice and Evans had been successfully served, but both players 
denied receiving subpoenas. And how did the deposition hearing go? "It wasn't 
something you'd take your family to," Boggs said.

FISH REPORT: YELLOWTAIL ARE HITTING SOUTH OF SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yellowtail have made a strong showing at the Coronado Islands south of San 
Diego and, according to Carol Stock, a reservations clerk at Fisherman's 
Landing, they're right on schedule.

On Monday, anglers aboard nine boats brought in 375 yellowtail, all in the 12- 
to 15-pound class.

On Tuesday the bite showed no signs of slowing. The Conquest, with 18 anglers 
aboard, reported that 82 of the popular jacks had already been landed, and the 
Prowler, with 45 fishermen aboard, reported catching 85 yellowtail.

LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION EXAMINES DFG'S EFFECTIVENESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Pete Thomas 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California's Little Hoover Commission, which monitors the efficiency of the 
state's governmental agencies, is examining the performance of the Department 
of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation, which was requested by a Northern California Assemblyman 
Stan Statham (R-Oak Run), started Monday at a hearing in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
DFG Director Pete Bontadelli, recovering from a back injury, was unable to 
attend, and his assistant, Paul Jensen, represented the department. Harold 
Cribbs, executive secretary of the DFG Commission, represented his group, which 
is appointed by the governor to set DFG policy. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover Commission Chairman Nathan Shapell said he wants DFG Commission 
President Bob Bryant of Yuba City to testify at the next hearing June 27 in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"We will send him a very nice letter," Shapell said. "We do not like to issue 
subpoenas." 
</P>
<P>
During Monday's session, the Hoover panel was primarily interested in how the 
DFG deals with commercial developments that it perceives to affect fish and 
wildlife. The first witness was housing developer Devere Anderson, who 
complained that "in recent years . . . there's been a dramatic change in 
policies and procedures of Fish and Game, and it seems as though there's been a 
new-found power that they're exerting to accomplish their goals and objectives. 
And I think that's what is causing some problems." 
</P>
<P>
But the probing quickly turned to how the Fish and Game Commission, which sets 
DFG policy, correlates with the department, which implements policy. 
</P>
<P>
Vice Chairman Haig Mardikian said he found it strange that Bontadelli's job is 
to follow the lead of a commission that has no power to fire him. The DFG 
director is appointed by the governor, as are the commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
The Hoover members were suspicious that the commission, rather than determining 
policy, merely reacted to department recommendations. Mary Ann Chalker 
challenged Cribbs' testimony that the commission, with seven full-time 
employees, is able to monitor the 1,568 DFG employees around the state. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the commission's budget, Cribbs speculated that it was about 
$200,000 a year. Jeannine English, executive director of the Hoover panel, told 
Cribbs that it was $429,000, according to her information. Cribbs didn't 
dispute the figure. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Gersten told Cribbs: "You say that on a day-to-day basis you keep track 
of all correspondence and what's going on in the state, yet you don't know your 
own budget." 
</P>
<P>
The June 27 hearing will primarily focus on sportsmen's issues. The Hoover 
panel will then issue its report and recommendations to Gov. George Deukmejian 
and the state legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Frank LoPreste couldn't find any yellowfin tuna to speak of at Clipperton 
Island off Costa Rica, and he met with only marginal success at the 
Revillagigedo Islands off mainland Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
But two Orange County couples, fishing just off the coast of Mexico's 
Zihuatanejo, had little trouble locating the big yellowfins so popular among 
long-range fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
"We caught six over a hundred pounds," said Linda Knowles of Costa Mesa, adding 
that 26 fish were caught throughout last week. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest was a 187-pound yellowfin taken last Saturday after just an hour's 
boat ride. The smallest fish were in the 40-pound class. 
</P>
<P>
LoPreste, meanwhile, on a 23-day trip aboard his Royal Polaris, found 
conditions at Clipperton to be "tough, tough, tough, with few fish and several 
sharks," according to a report he made to a fishing information telephone line. 
</P>
<P>
Conditions weren't much better at the Revillagigedos, where his passengers will 
wind up what so far has been a less-than-memorable trip. 
</P>
<P>
The State Fish and Game Commission recently adopted the 1989 hunting 
regulations and license forms should be available by June 1. 
</P>
<P>
New hunts include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Camp Roberts antlerless deer hunt in Monterey County (Zone S-5, Aug. 
28-Sept. 4). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Camp Pendleton either-sex deer hunt in San Diego County (S-10, Aug. 5-Sept. 
24). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Santa Catalina Island either-sex deer hunt (S-29, Oct. 14-Jan. 31). 
</P>
<P>
Changes in deer hunting regulations are few and indicated in the 1989 
California Hunting Regulations, also due by June. 
</P>
<P>
Citing concerns about the condition of pronghorn antelope herds, the number of 
tags has been cut from 645 to 355 and doe permits from 100 to 50. 
</P>
<P>
Tule elk hunts, canceled by court order last year, will offer 40 permits for 
Bishop, 40 for Lone Pine and 15 for Cache Creek. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly 
</P>
<P>

of California (SAC) and former DFG deputy director, has been elected to the San 
Diego Oceans Foundation's board of directors.

TENNIS ROUNDUP;

<P>
UNSEEDED ITALIAN STUNS MECIR; WILANDER STRUGGLES BUT WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Italy's Omar Camporese, a wild-card entry ranked 120th in the world, eliminated 
fourth-seeded Miloslav Mecir, 6-2, 7-5, Tuesday night in the first round of the 
Italian Open at Rome. 
</P>
<P>
But another major upset was averted earlier in the day when top-seeded Mats 
Wilander came to life after a listless first set and outlasted Javier Frana of 
Argentina, 6-7 (8-6), 6-3, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Mecir, who returned to action two weeks ago after injuring his back in March, 
had three set points at 5-4 in the second set before Camporese fired three 
serves that the Czech couldn't handle. 
</P>
<P>
Camporese then got a service break to go ahead, 6-5, when Mecir double-faulted 
once and committed three unforced backhand errors. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Italian, a doubles specialist who had beaten Mecir once before 
in Milan, served out the match in the next game. On the second match point, 
Mecir slapped a backhand into the net after an rally of more than 30 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, second-seeded Andre Agassi survived a brief second-set lapse to beat 
fellow American Todd Witsken, 6-1, 6-4; and fourth-seeded Jimmy Connors, 
playing in Rome for the first time in 14 years, defeated French qualifier 
Cedric Pioline, 6-4, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Other seeds advancing were No. 6 Emilio Sanchez of Spain, a 6-1, 6-2 winner 
over Eduardo Bengoechea of Argentina; No. 11 Alberto Mancini of Argentina, who 
defeated Francisco Clavet of Spain 6-3, 6-2, and No. 13 Jaime Yzaga of Peru, 
who beat Marian Vajda of Czechoslovakia, 7-5, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Two other seeded players were eliminated. No. 9 Ronald Agenor of Haiti, who 
reached the semifinals here last year, was upset by Bruno Oresar of Yugoslavia, 
7-6 (7-3), 3-6, 6-2. No. 12 Andres Gomez of Ecuador, winner of the Italian Open 
in 1982 and 1984, was ousted by Spain's Sergio Bruguera, 2-6, 6-2, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Steffi Graf, ranked No. 1 in the world, overcame early deficits in 
both sets and went on to defeat Tine Scheuer-Larsen of Denmark, 7-5, 6-4, in 
the first round of a $300,000 women's tournament at Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
The West German took 2 hours 8 minutes to dispose of her opponent, ranked 94th 
internationally, after falling behind 1-2 at the start of both sets. 
</P>
<P>
Nathalie Tauziat of France, ranked 12th, also won but with difficulty, 4-6, 
7-5, 7-6 (7-3), against Sabrina Goles of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
Noelle Porter of Pepperdine, an unseeded freshman, and Stanford's Lisa Green 
advanced to the semifinals of the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. women's 
individual tournament at Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Porter held off Danielle Jones of Oklahoma State, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, and then 
defeated Shannan McCarthy of Georgia, 7-6 (7-4), 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Green pulled off two upsets, defeating No. 5 Stacey Martin of Tennessee, 6-4, 
6-0, and then No. 2 Jessica Emmons of UCLA, 7-6 (8-6), 3-6, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was down 5-1 (in the first set against Emmons), I was just trying to 
win one game to maybe make her think about it some more," Green said. "After 
that, I just started playing better. I stoped rushing so much. It was a good 
match to win." 
</P>
<P>
Green will next play her Stanford teammate, Sandra Birch, who is seeded third. 
Porter will meet No. 4 Jennifer Santrock of Southern Methodist. 
</P>
<P>
Birch advanced by defeating Nicole Arendt of Florida 6-2, 7-6 (9-7), and then 
Ginger Helgeson of Pepperdine, 3-6, 6-2, 7-6 (7-4). Birch later teamed with 
Debbie Graham to upset the top-seeded doubles team, Mamie Ceniza and Stella 
Sampras of UCLA, 6-4, 6-1, in a second-round match.

EAGLE ROCK KEEPING TAFT COMPANY; 
</P>
<P>
BEHIND WONG'S 70, EAGLES TIE TOREADORS AFTER 1ST ROUND OF CITY GOLF FINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Jason Gordon of El Camino Real High stood behind the 10th tee at Harding Golf 
Course at Griffith Park on Tuesday and looked at the cast on his fractured 
right hand. Then he looked at the cast on the golf course. 
</P>
<P>
Neither one exactly thrilled Gordon, the defending City Section individual golf 
champion who was forced into a spectator's role this year after breaking his 
hand in a freak accident 10 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a down year," said Gordon, who won last year's title as a junior 
with a total of 72-73 -- 145. "Some of these numbers are real high." 
</P>
<P>
Those weren't just sour grapes. Despite perfect weather, only six players broke 
80 in the first round, and, with 18 holes to play, upstart Eagle Rock moved 
into a tie for first with perennial contender Taft in the team competition at 
408. 
</P>
<P>
Eagle Rock senior Gerald Wong was the only player to break par, finishing at 
one-under 70. Wong had three birdies on the back nine and finished with a 
three-under 31. Cameron Broumand of Palisades is second at 73. 
</P>
<P>
Taft was led by Ryan White, who shares third place at 77 with Josh Oring of 
Granada Hills and Tony Bordwell of El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
White, a bespectacled freshman, says he has grown eight inches since enrolling 
at Taft in September. 
</P>
<P>
"It's messed me up some," said White, who now stands 5-foot-9. "But there are 
touring pros who are 5-3 who hit it 300 yards. The secret is to hit it straight 
and make putts." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his inexperience, White managed to finish the round with no sixes on 
his score card. Bordwell, a junior, stayed in the hunt despite a balky putter. 
Bordwell missed birdie putts of eight feet or less on each of the last two 
holes and did not have a birdie. 
</P>
<P>
"Twelve pars, six bogeys," he grumbled. "And three of the bogeys were on missed 
two-footers." 
</P>
<P>
Taft, the 5-A League champion that last season was upset in the team final by 
El Camino Real of the 4-A League, now faces a stiff test from Eagle Rock, the 
3-A League champion. 
</P>
<P>
It took an 82 from Taft's No. 6 man, freshman Sheldon Mink, to move the 
Toreadors into a tie for first heading into today's final round at the more 
difficult Wilson Course. 
</P>
<P>
All four girls in the field qualified individually, led by Eagle Rock's Leann 
Wong, Gerald's freshman sister. Wong shot 83, three shots better than Carol 
Jensen of North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Louise Leftinger of Van Nuys, a foreign-exchange student from Sweden, shot 88 
and Monica Chant of Birmingham had 99. All individuals under 100 qualified for 
the second round. 
</P>
<P>
The top six teams advanced to the final 18 holes. Trailing Eagle Rock and Taft 
are Granada Hills (427), University (438) and defending champion El Camino Real 
(442).

FERGUSON STILL HOPEFUL OF QUALIFYING AT INDY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dick Ferguson of Glendale is still confident of making the field for the 
Indianapolis 500 despite engine problems that prevented him from qualifying 
last weekend at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
When Ferguson arrived in Indianapolis earlier this month, he accepted an offer 
from a local racing car firm to use a March 87C car for qualifying and save his 
own March 86C for the race. He installed one of his Cosworth Ford engines in 
the March 87C and took it on the track for two days of testing, but 
fuel-related problems damaged the engine and forced him to the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"We're up against the clock now, but we should be OK," Ferguson said by phone 
from Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
There are seven positions open for the Memorial Day race -- 26 cars have 
qualified -- and Ferguson feels that he can get the March 86C "up to speed" in 
this weekend's final qualifying sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"The qualifying speeds are low," he said. "Everybody feels that 212 should be 
enough" to qualify. JEFF MEYERS

<P>
STANLEY STEAMER DERAILS CATCHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this corner, Jason Stanley. In that corner, a catcher. 
</P>
<P>
Rounds one and two took place this season. And both times, Stanley, a senior 
outfielder at Canyon, was the one left standing. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon enters the Southern Section 3-A Division playoffs Friday at El Monte. 
And Stanley, who is completing his third season after three years on the 
school's football team, quite likely will be carrying a few bruises into 
postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
On April 25, Stanley collided with Saugus catcher J. B. Johnson, who was 
ejected after countering with a burst of profanity. 
</P>
<P>
"The ump said it wasn't my fault," explained Stanley, who was not ejected. 
Stanley claimed that the collision was unavoidable because Johnson stepped into 
his path at the final second. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going in standing up," Stanley said. "He didn't even have the ball. But 
the (Saugus) coaches were saying how I was using football tactics on the 
baseball field. It's happened before." 
</P>
<P>
Stanley's steamroller reputation was born his sophomore season when he collided 
with a Saugus third baseman. Earlier this season, Stanley flattened a Quartz 
Hill catcher. 
</P>
<P>
Said Stanley, who stands 6 feet and weighs 185 pounds: "He was gonna run me 
over if I didn't run him over." 
</P>
<P>
Stanley said he had been unaware that high school rules prohibit a baserunner 
from deliberately colliding with the catcher. Stanley, a defensive back, 
insists that the collisions were unintentional. But he concedes that he has 
developed a reputation for running the bases like a fullback. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had people say that about me for as long as I've played baseball," 
Stanley said. "For as long as I've been at Canyon, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Does a football background aid in the art of baserunning? 
</P>
<P>
Said Stanley: "It doesn't hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Wasted opportunity: Notre Dame figured to have an outside shot at the Southern 
Section 1-A Division boys' track title heading into last week's prelims at 
Arcadia High. 
</P>
<P>
But any chance of winning the title evaporated when the Knights dropped the 
baton in the 400-meter relay and failed to qualify for this week's finals. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame, which has the fastest time (42.32 seconds) in the 1-A this season, 
held a big lead after the first leg, but Scott Chiu and Angelo Palazzo failed 
to connect on the second exchange. 
</P>
<P>
To top things off, Garrett Miller -- second in the 400 in the San Fernando 
Valley League finals -- was disqualified after a false start in his heat. 
</P>
<P>
Add prelims: Rio Mesa lost two potential scorers in the Southern Section 3-A 
track prelims at Gahr High on Saturday, but co-Coach Brian FitzGerald still 
expects the Spartans to contend for boys' title. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Patrick Van Scoy, the Ventura County champion in the discus, failed 
to qualify in that event, and senior high jumper Jeff Garner did not compete 
because he was on a basketball recruiting trip to Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
"Losing Patrick in the discus hurts," FitzGerald said. "But we still have a 
good chance at winning the 3-A title. He qualified in the shotput and I expect 
him to throw very well in the finals Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
Resurrection: It was late February and Jim Ozella had all the verve of a guy 
waiting for the switch to be pulled. 
</P>
<P>
"Be nice writing my obituary," the Alemany baseball coach said one night. 
</P>
<P>
What Ozella had not figured on was the revival of his batting order. Every 
starter hit better than .300. 
</P>
<P>
Alemany, left for dead, won nine of 12 league games to win the title. "With all 
the problems this year we've had with injuries, these kids have hung tough," 
Ozella said. "It's a testament to them."

SECTION GOLF CHAMPIONSHIPS;

It figured that this year's San Diego Section high school golf tournament would 
be wide open after the graduation of the two golfers who dominated the 
tournament for three years. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Phil Mickelson of USDHS is now playing at Arizona State and 
La Jolla's Harry Rudolph, who won in 1986 and '87, is now at Oklahoma State. 
</P>
<P>
That left this year's tournament up for grabs. And 29 golfers are within six 
strokes of the lead after the first round of the 36-hole tournament Tuesday at 
Singing Hills Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
David Thornton of Bonita Vista shot a two-under 69 to take the first-round 
lead. Brian Cates of Madison and Rob Dennison of Poway are at one-under 70. 
</P>
<P>
The 104-golfer field was cut to the top 28 and ties after the first round. This 
year's cut was at 75, providing the deepest field in tournament history. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the lowest (cut) I can remember," said Gene Edwards, who has coached 
golf off and on at La Jolla for the past 32 years. "The 77s couldn't believe it 
when they were out and now the 76s are saying 'I don't believe this.' " 
</P>
<P>
The second round begins at 7:30 a.m. at Singing Hills. The top 10 finishers 
that are not members of the Madison and Poway teams will qualify for the 
Southern California Golf Championships in Bakersfield beginning June 11. 
Golfers from Madison, the section team champion, and second-place Poway who 
finish in the top 10 will not be counted toward the 10 berths the section is 
awarded. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton was even after the first nine, but went two-under on the back nine for 
a 34, tying for the day's low score on the back nine. 
</P>
<P>
"I was putting bad all day," Thornton said. "I didn't have a birdie on the 
front but I eagled No. 7 (488-yard par five)." 
</P>
<P>
Thornton, who said he will play at Southern Methodist next year, then birdied 
13 and the par-five, 531-yard 18th for the day's low round. 
</P>
<P>
Dennison, who shot a 70, was the first alternate and played only because 
somebody didn't show up for the tee time. 
</P>
<P>
"I was expecting to wait all day," Dennison said. "I'm glad I got to play." 
</P>
<P>
Dennison didn't have to wait that long as a golfer in the day's second foursome 
withdrew. 
</P>
<P>
"I really wanted to play well today," Dennison said. "I haven't really played 
that well this season." 
</P>
<P>
Dennison didn't get a berth in the section individual tournament when he missed 
the 170 cutoff at the Palomar League tournament by a stroke. He was then 
selected by the section seeding committee as the No. 1 alternate. 
</P>
<P>
The attention the past three years had been on Mickelson and Rudolph, two of 
the top junior golfers in the nation. Mickelson won last year's tournament by 
four strokes over Rudolph with a section record 135. 
</P>
<P>
"When Mickelson and Rudolph would come in with the sort of rounds like they did 
the focus was on them," Edwards said. "They were kind of the apex and now you 
can see all the other potentials."

Stock prices pulled back Tuesday amid selling to collect profits amassed during 
the previous two strong sessions. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, which ran up a gain of nearly 82 points 
on Friday and Monday, finished with a loss of 10.44 points at 2,453.45. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 7 to 6 in nationwide 
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 791 down, 677 up and 500 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 173.1 million shares, down from 
179.35 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in 
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 
211.64 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, what we're seeing is a bit of a pullback after two very strong 
days," said Gordon L. Smith, a managing director at the investment firm Alex. 
Brown &amp; Sons Inc. in Baltimore. "This is quite normal. The market took 
quite a run and needs to pause." 
</P>
<P>
The selling, which wasn't confined to any particular type of stock, appeared to 
be motivated mainly by the desire to collect profits, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Market operators decided the time was right to sell because the government is 
due to release some potentially market-moving economic figures today and 
Thursday, said Peter VandenBerg, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman 
Hutton Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Commerce Department is scheduled to report on the country's 
merchandise trade performance in March, and the following day the Labor

International Business Machines skidded 1 3/8 to 111 3/8. The computer giant 
unveiled a new OfficeVision family of software designed to be compatible with 
IBM machines of all sizes. 
</P>
<P>
Among companies involved in mergers or attempted takeovers, Ogilvy Group eased 
1/8 to 53 1/8 in heavy over-the-counter trading as more than 1.7 million shares 
changed hands. The advertising and marketing concern has agreed to be acquired 
by Britain's WPP Group for $54 a share, or about $864 million. 
</P>
<P>
Avon Products, which has received a $39-a-share offer from privately held Amway 
Corp., was up 5/8 at 40 1/4, a new 52-week high. Amway has indicated that it 
would consider paying more if Avon would agree to a negotiated deal. 
</P>
<P>
On the Tokyo stock market, share prices rose, boosted by purchases by 
investment trusts and some financial institutions. But the dollar's strength 
against the yen kept many sidelined, brokers said. 
</P>
<P>
The 225-share Nikkei index surged 210.16 points to 33,926.45. The index fell 
150.04 points Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, share prices closed lower in light trading as the market 
consolidated its strong gains of the past two trading sessions. 
</P>
<P>
At the close, the Financial Times 100-share index was down 13.2 points at 
2,136.7, just 0.7 point above its lowest level. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
The bond market closed mostly higher as a late rally boosted the price of 
long-term government securities. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was up 9/32 point, or about $2.82 per 
$1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from 
price, fell to 8.81% from 8.84% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Trading was light most of the day, with prices stable or slightly down until a 
late flurry of buying. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the market's behavior, which followed a decline in bond 
prices Monday, to internal influences following a strong run-up last week on 
signs of modest inflation. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
were down 1/32 point to up 1/32 point, intermediate maturities were unchanged 
to up 3/16 point and long-term issues were up as much as 3/16 point, according 
to Telerate Inc., a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal 
bonds was unchanged at 92 7/8. The average yield to maturity held steady at 
7.52%. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills issued Monday rose to 8.50% as the 
discount rose 3 basis points to 8.22%. Yields on new six-month bills fell to 
8.72% as the discount fell 4 basis points to 8.25%. Yields on one-year bills 
were unchanged 8.84% as the discount held at 8.19%. 
</P>
<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at 
maturity. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded 
at 9.1875%, down from 9.8125% late Monday.

Kaiser Steel Resources: The reorganized successor to Kaiser Steel Corp. said it 
earned $951,423 on revenue of $1.3 million in its first quarter. The Rancho 
Cucamonga company said that because it was in bankruptcy proceedings during the 
first quarter of 1988, year-earlier results have no relevance and were not 
provided. The company noted that revenue from a long-term water rights 
transaction with the Southern California Water District and lease payments from 
Mine Reclamation Corp. helped the results.

Mercury Savings &amp; Loan: The Huntington Beach-based institution, restating 
its 1988 financial results for a second time, said it lost $13.8 million last 
year. That was nearly double the 1988 loss that it reported two months ago, and 
a nearly $20-million reversal from the profit it originally announced. 
Regulators earlier this year forced Mercury to reduce the stated value of some 
of its assets. Mercury Chairman Leonard Shane said the latest revision was made 
because of incorrect accounting assumptions about the reporting of profits on 
the sale of loans. In addition, assumptions used to figure Mercury's tax 
liability were incorrect, Shane said. For 1987, Mercury posted earnings of $5.1 
million. The company also reported a loss for the first quarter of 1989 of 
$700,000, contrasted with profit of $1.1 million for the year-earlier period. 
Revenue for the quarter increased 8% to $61.6 million.

A Your Wheels column on May 4 recommended a method for combating mold in 
automobile air conditioners. The process, suggested by an allergist who had 
safely used it in the past, involved mixing vinegar and household bleach and 
placing the solution in a pan in a car. 
</P>
<P>
Several academic and industry experts have since raised objections to the 
procedure, saying it could cause irritation in some individuals. In the worst 
case, the experts said, the vinegar-bleach mixture could produce harmful or 
irritating fumes. 
</P>
<P>
Alternatives to the procedure will be discussed in a future Your Wheels column.

Spence is the celebrated and intentionally colorful trial lawyer from Wyoming 
who is best known for his work on the Karen Silkwood case and the lawsuit 
brought by a former Miss Wyoming against Penthouse magazine. "With Justice for 
None" is Spence's red-hot jeremiad on what's wrong with the American judicial 
system and the American way of life. According to Spence, just about everything 
has gone wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"I have spent most of my life representing ordinary people against the 
corporate giants. Sometimes I feel like the farmer on his 40 acres who has to 
take on God and all of the elements," Spence proclaims. "Yet in this tangled, 
frantic, commercial society, can we expect justice except by the immutable 
rules of Darwin? In our system, money is power." And Spence concludes: "The 
truth is there is no justice in America for the people." 
</P>
<P>
Spence styles himself as a latter-day prophet, full of hellfire and brimstone, 
and his firecracker prose is so much like the sputtering (and faintly 
demogogic) rhetoric of 19th-Century populism that his book often seems almost 
antique: "A new king dominates in America, a sovereign whose soul is pledged to 
business and whose heart is geared to profit. The new king, an amorphous 
agglomeration of corporations, of banks and insurance companies and mammoth 
multinational financial institutions, maintains a prurient passion for money 
and demands a justice of its own." 
</P>
<P>
Spence has nothing good to say about any aspect of the system in which he makes 
a living: 
</P>
<P>
On lawyers, law students and law schools: "Today there are not too many 
lawyers, but too few -- too few of the right kind; too few who are trained as 
fighters; too few who will represent the people. . . . Skillfully, designedly, 
our young have made themselves salable to corporate America as replacement 
parts for the legal machine that grinds away in corporate law firms at lush 
hourly rates." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cases on Appeal 
</P>
<P>
On judges and juries: "Judges, not juries, decide our cases in America. . . . 
More often than not, our cases on appeal are decided by a jury of judges 
composed of persons most lawyers would have challenged summarily from any jury 
panel. . . . The misery of the people seeking justice is no more vivid to the 
judges than reading about any other tragedy in the morning news. Judges see 
paper, not people. They see the lifeless briefs heaped upon their benches like 
great mountains in stark black and white." 
</P>
<P>
On insurance companies: "The insurance company is the God of Money. But the God 
of Money is not a benevolent god. It does not love us. It loves only its 
dollars, and it will hire the best lawyers in the land to keep them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Corporations Clobbered 
</P>
<P>
On corporations: "That corporate America . . . cheerfully barters the lung 
tumors of its asbestos workers for profit, exchanges the brain damage of 
thousands of children from lead poisoning for earnings . . . and, without 
adequate testing, feeds carcinogens to an entire nation to secure a possible 
early market advantage, diminishes the likes of Charles Manson to a prankster 
at a Sunday school picnic." 
</P>
<P>
Spence devotes the second half of the book to his own plan for the reform of 
the legal system, which also seems to contemplate the remaking of the American 
way of life. He calls for "people's" lawyers and "people's" judges, whatever 
that means, who will bring a messianic future of perfect justice: "For them, 
the love of justice will become as real as the love of art, as the love of 
discovery, as the love of truth." And Spence concedes that he is calling for 
nothing less than a revolution: "We must smash the trick mirrors," he writes. 
"Change will come only when we have slammed the system up against them all and 
stared it down. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Happily enough for the reader, "With Justice for None" is not always or even 
mostly a catalogue of Spence's complaints about the judicial system. Spence, 
like most seasoned trial lawyers, simply cannot resist the temptation to tell 
war stories, to relive an artful cross-examination or a triumphant closing 
argument, and to generally portray himself as the damned fine lawyer that he 
surely believes himself to be and probably is. (At one point, when Spence is 
contemplating why lawyers are regarded with such contempt, he confesses: "I 
hated being hated.") And so the best moments in Spence's book are introduced 
with the irresistible phrase: "Let me tell you a story." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gold-Plated Cogs 
</P>
<P>
Still, Spence's book is a war cry and not a collection of war stories. As a 
former "big-firm" attorney who now practices in a small law office, I 
appreciate how a lawyer like Spence feels when he comes up against the armies 
of high-priced lawyers who serve as gold-plated cogs in the legal machine. But 
I also know -- and I'm quite sure that Gerry Spence knows -- that the sole 
practitioner or the small firm can prevail over a wealthy and powerful 
adversary, and justice, however crude and incomplete, can be done. The fact is 
that Spence, as a true believer in perfect justice, does not yearn for the mere 
reform of the legal system -- rather, he is a visionary for whom the imperfect 
justice of this world will never be enough.

Actor Timothy Bottoms, arrested last week on suspicion of threatening a 
motorist with a gun while driving in Ventura, says he did not wave the gun as 
accused, but merely had it on the passenger seat. The gun's shaft was unloaded, 
but bullets were in a console nearby, which according to a new law is 
tantamount to the gun being loaded. "I am guilty of definitely having the 
bullets within reach of the weapon," he said in a telephone interview. "And 
there was a weapon in my car. Those are the facts . . . but . . . I did not 
touch the pistol. I didn't do anything wrong except not be aware of the new 
law." Bottoms, 37, allegedly brandished a .22-caliber pistol after he and the 
driver of a pickup became involved in an altercation due to "discourteous or 
possibly unsafe driving," a California Highway Patrol spokesman said. The actor 
was arrested about 15 minutes later heading north on the freeway toward Santa 
Barbara after the other driver, Frank Harwood, 38, called police from his car 
phone. Bottoms, released on $5,000 bail, is being investigated for brandishing 
a firearm on a roadway, a felony, and carrying a loaded weapon, a misdemeanor.

Tenor Luciano Pavarotti walked off stage during the third act of Puccini's 
"Tosca" Monday night in Pittsburgh after throat problems made his voice crack. 
The production began 45 minutes late as doctors attended to Pavarotti 
backstage. He decided to go on, but was forced to end the opera early when his 
voice cracked on a high note. Pavarotti mumbled "Sorry" and signaled the 
conductor to start again, but he approached the same note with the same 
results. "I cannot do it. I am sorry," he told the audience. He then put his 
head down and walked off the stage. After a few moments, the curtain fell and 
the houselights came on. The audience applauded. ALEENE MacMINN and CLAUDIA

MULLINS MASTERFUL AT BON APPETIT

<TEXT>
<P>
Rob Mullins is not yet a household name, but the evidence provided during his 
weekly session at the Bon Appetit left no doubt that the 31-year-old keyboard 
artist is headed for status as an international celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
Well versed though he is in synthesizer technology (he often plays electric 
keyboards at this Westwood club), Mullins on Sunday confined himself to 
acoustic piano. The confinement, far from pinning him down, offered a chance to 
display his mastery of the jazz tradition in a setting that gave him unlimited 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
With Brian Bromberg, a phenomenally fleet young bassist, and Joel Taylor on 
drums, Mullins paid his blues dues with a so-soaked treatment of "Georgia on My 
Mind," complete with funky chording and an occasional foray inside the piano 
for some evocative string-plucking. 
</P>
<P>
Two tunes from his forthcoming album, "Breakthrough" and the title number "Jazz 
Jazz," attested to Mullins' successful experimentation as a composer. A blues, 
"Five-Four-Three-Two-One," found all three men digging deep into the heart of 
the matter, with Bromberg at his damn-the-torpedoes best. 
</P>
<P>
Usually heard here every Sunday, Mullins will leave soon for an encore tour of 
Japan, returning to the weekly Bon Appetit gig June 25. LEONARD FEATHER

JAZZ NOTES : SALSA CONCERT AT FORD THEATRE IS CALLED OFF; JAZZ SCORE TO BACK 
'FELIX THE GREAT' RADIO STORY 
</P>

The third annual L.A. Salsa Fest, scheduled for Saturday and Sunday at the John 
Anson Ford Theatre, has been canceled. According to Linda Mandel, one of the 
event's promoters, poor advance ticket sales prompted the Ford managers -- the 
Hasset family -- to withdraw the show. 
</P>
<P>
Mandel thought the amount of salsa featured at several Cinco de Mayo events 
over the May 5-7 weekend may have slowed ticket sales. "A lot of our audience 
went to these events," Mandel said, "and hadn't gotten around to thinking about 
ours. I was looking for a lot of last-week purchases and walk-ups, but I guess 
the Ford Theatre (management) didn't want to take that chance." 
</P>
<P>
Mandel discounted the outbreaks of violence at two recent events that 
spotlighted salsa -- the appearance of El Gran Combo from Puerto Rico at the 
Hollywood Palladium in mid-April and a Cinco de Mayo celebration at Lincoln 
Park in East Los Angeles on May 7 -- as a reason the Salsa Fest had only modest 
ticket sales. "I think most people are still going to come in droves (for salsa 
shows)," she said, "even though I myself might stay away. I see these 
(outbreaks of violence) not as a trend -- at least I hope they're not -- but 
rather (spontaneous occurrences) that just happened in close proximity to each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to reach Ford management officials were not successful. Ticket holders 
can obtain refunds at point of purchase. 
</P>
<P>
FINALISTS ANNOUNCED: The five finalists in the fifth annual Hennessy Cognac 
Jazz Search, who will engage in a playoff tonight at the Palace nightclub in 
Hollywood, have been announced. 
</P>
<P>
The groups -- who were selected in competitions held in Detroit, New Orleans, 
New York and Los Angeles earlier this year -- include Quintessence (West 
Columbia, S.C.), the Steve Wood Quintet (Detroit), Synthetic Earth (Toronto), 
the Mel Brown Sextet (Portland) and the John Basile/Brad Terry Duo (New York). 
More than 600 groups from the United States, Canada, Japan and Brazil entered 
the competition by sending in audio tapes of their work. Semifinalists for the 
live performances were then selected by panels of professional musicians. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of tonight's battle of the bands -- which is open to the public on a 
limited-seating, first-come, first-served basis -- receives a cash award and a 
spot on the line-up of the Playboy Jazz Festival's June 18 show at the 
Hollywood Bowl. Past winners include the Timothy Horner group, the a cappella 
vocal ensemble Terra Nova and saxophonist Scott Kreitzer. Following his win 
last year, Kreitzer, an impressive tenor saxophonist, made his recording debut 
with "Kick n' Off" for locally based Cexton Records. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight Show" bandleader Doc Severinsen, keyboardist George Duke, record exec 
Harold Childs and composer Allyn Ferguson will judge this evening's 
contestants. KKGO's Chuck Niles will be the emcee. 
</P>
<P>
Information: (213) 201-8888. 
</P>
<P>
YOUTHFUL HONOREES: Two musicians and an instrumental group from Hamilton High 
School in Los Angeles have received awards in the 12th annual down beat 
magazine Student Music Awards. Pianist Vernal Brown, Jr. was chosen as best 
Blues/Pop/Rock instrumentalist in the high school division, and the school's 
combo was selected as the best Blues/Pop/Rock instrumental group. In addition 
to a plaque, Brown earned a partial scholarship to Berklee School of Music in 
Boston for his taped performance, which was judged on such qualities as overall 
sound, presence or authority, technique, improvisation and phrasing by a panel 
that included local composer/bandleader Les Hooper, producer/composer Teo 
Macero and singer/musician Don Shelton (of the Hi-Lo's), among others. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Hamilton's Julian Coryell, a guitarist, received an outstanding 
performance citation in the Jazz Instrumental Soloist division. 
</P>
<P>
JAZZ SOUND TRACK: Vermont-based writer-journalist Robert Shure has come up with 
an interesting twist for his 26-part radio story, "Felix the Great," heard 
locally on KLON-FM (88.1 FM), Monday-Friday, 11:45 p.m., through June 5. He's 
backed his story, about "a guy who wants to be a great illusionist," with a 
jazz score by Finnish composer-keyboardist Heikki Sarmanto's quintet. "The 
story fits the various moods of jazz," said Shure, "so the music is not really 
background music. The idea is that the story is to be told by both the music 
and the words, so the music's a major part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Shure met Sarmanto while doing some free-lance journalism in Finland a few 
years ago, and collaborated with him on "Man With a Sax," a Shure story backed 
by Sarmanto's music that was released on Cadence records in 1986. "So that 
prompted us to do something like this, a story I wanted heard rather than read, 
but much longer than 'Man with a Sax.' " Ultimately, six hours of music were 
recorded for "Felix." 
</P>
<P>
Each episode of the drama, which is heard nationally on such NPR stations as 
WBUR-FM in Boston and WYET-FM in Pittsburgh, begins with an introduction that 
brings the listener up to date, said Shure. But, he noted, KLON is the only 
station airing the program nightly; other stations schedule it weekly. 
</P>
<P>
**** 1/2 McCoy Tyner's "Revelations" (Blue Note), the pianist's first solo 
album in a decade, documents his compelling orchestral approach in all its 
splendor. Included are winsome versions of Coltrane's "Lazybird," the standard 
"Don't Blame Me" and Tyner's "You Taught My Heart to Sing." 
</P>
<P>
Recordings are graded on a five-star system. Five stars (*****) means all but 
indispensable for your jazz library; one star (*) means forget it.

SLICK LOOK COVERS ROUGH SCRIPT IN PBS' 'BIG TIME' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Public television viewers who occasionally indulge in the guilty pleasures of 
MTV can howl tonight. Keith Reddin's "Big Time," on "American Playhouse" 
(Channels 28 and 15 at 9 p.m.), looks as if it belongs on MTV. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Paul (Adrian Pasdar) has just shot a music video starring Fran (Mia 
Sara) -- and we see it, and excerpts from it, throughout the show. We also see 
samples of Paul's commercials and his ludicrously artsy public-service ad on 
behalf (?) of the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the movie, too, was shot in a high-gloss, ultra-chic style. 
Throughout, visual accent marks appear in the very grainy, black and white 
Polavision, zooming in on tight close-ups of details that might otherwise be 
lost in the color footage. The color, too, is used cleverly -- for example, a 
scene titled "Boys' Night Out" (placards announce chapter titles here) is shot 
in pink, while the corresponding "Girls' Night Out" is in blue. 
</P>
<P>
No one is credited with direction; instead, the film was "created by" Jan 
Egleson, Howard Cummings, Bill Anderson, Paul Goldsmith and Marcus Viscidi. 
Some of this team, as well as composer Pat Metheny, also worked on "Lemon Sky" 
for "American Playhouse" last year. 
</P>
<P>
All the glitz doesn't disguise the fact that Reddin's script (also staged in 
Beverly Hills earlier this year) isn't much. In fact, the cool look of the show 
may actually take some of the heat out of Reddin's shallow jeremiad against 
yuppies. 
</P>
<P>
The model really wants to be a serious actress. Her lovers are selfish louts, 
especially the greedy Michael (Dennis Boutsikaris), who is not only mean to his 
mistress but also to the Third World, in his job as an investment banker. So 
what else is new? 
</P>
<P>
It's difficult to take any of these people seriously, but they do pose well, 
and Metheny's score adds a brooding sense of melancholy. DON SHIRLEY

SERIES OF ERRORS ON TANKER LED TO SPILL, PANEL IS TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the Exxon Valdez approached a hazardous midnight passage between rock reefs 
and floating icebergs in Prince William Sound, a series of errors aboard the 
supertanker began compounding, leading to the worst oil spill in U.S. history, 
a federal board of inquiry was told Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was the captain away from the bridge, there was no lookout stationed 
on the bow, the depth alarm was not working and the ship was increasing -- 
rather than reducing -- speed. At times the ship was on automatic pilot, a 
condition normally reserved for operations in the open sea. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosures came on the opening day of a five-day hearing by the National 
Transportation Safety Board on the causes and immediate aftermath of the March 
24 tanker grounding, which spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil into the 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing also focused on a mystery: Did the ship's crew fail to realize 
trouble lay ahead, or did the ship somehow not respond to its frantic efforts 
to avoid Bligh Reef? 
</P>
<P>
The ship's third mate, Gregory T. Cousins, told the panel that Capt. Joseph 
Hazelwood left the bridge to do some paper work in his cabin after first 
ordering the tanker outside normal traffic lanes to avoid floating ice. 
According to Cousins' testimony, Hazelwood asked if the third mate was 
comfortable handling the responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Cousins, unlicensed to operate the vessel in the sound, said "yes, I was." 
</P>
<P>
According to reports filed by NTSB investigators Tuesday, Hazelwood made a 
series of decisions before leaving the bridge, however. He ordered the lookout 
stationed on the bow to take a position on the bridge wing, 800 feet from the 
bow. And he told Cousins to steer back into the traffic lanes just beyond Busby 
Island, where a buoy light warns of dangerous shoals. 
</P>
<P>
Seven minutes before the accident, just after passing Busby Island, Cousins 
said he ordered a right rudder correction of 10 degrees. Two minutes later, 
detecting no response, he said he made a more insistent 20-degree right rudder 
correction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Five-Minute Delay 
</P>
<P>
But the ship's mechanical course recorder said no course change began until 
five minutes after Cousins said he issued his first order. 
</P>
<P>
"I honestly cannot pinpoint the reason" for the discrepancy, Cousins said. 
</P>
<P>
As the ship steamed at 11 knots toward the reef, Cousins said he called 
Hazelwood in his cabin. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to him, 'I think we're in serious trouble,' " Cousins said. Then the 
987-foot tanker hit the reef. 
</P>
<P>
Cousins said in a panic that he grabbed the wheel and spun it left but by that 
time, "I believe we were hard aground." 
</P>
<P>
Cousins said he shined a light on the water but could not see oil because it 
was too dark. But he said he could smell oil. 
</P>
<P>
Telling his story for the first time to an intent crowd in a downtown hotel 
ballroom, the Tampa, Fla., seaman said that after the first hit there was 
another jolt every 10 seconds for a minute, six jolts in all. 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood returned to the bridge and spent about 20 minutes trying to rock the 
ship free. He called the Coast Guard at 12:26. At 12:35, he made another futile 
12-minute attempt to free the tanker -- actions that authorities believe might 
have further jeopardized the ship's already precarious position. 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood, fired from Exxon and facing state criminal charges of drunk driving, 
reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil, refused to testify at the 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood, who is free on $50,000 bail, goes on trial June 20. He has pleaded 
innocent to the charges. He faces two years, three months in jail and $11,000 
in fines if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Cousins said he smelled no alcohol on Hazelwood's breath. The captain failed a 
blood alcohol test 10 hours later and investigators said Hazelwood was drinking 
before sailing his tanker out of Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
However, Exxon Chairman Lawrence Rawl told United Press International on 
Tuesday that company interviews indicate Hazelwood was not drunk prior to the 
spill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attorney's View 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood's attorney, Michael Chalos, said Tuesday that the testimony showed 
"an accident happened and it was the fault of the third mate and the helmsman. 
You can talk about the captain's judgment, but it doesn't rise to a crime." 
</P>
<P>
In a dozen trips on Exxon vessels out of Valdez, Cousins said, he had not seen 
"growlers," small icebergs, worse than on the night the ship left port, but he 
said he saw them only on radar. 
</P>
<P>
Cousins said he was surprised to find the tanker on automatic pilot when he 
took over because autopilot was used in open water and not during maneuvers, 
such as the detour away from ice. He said he did not know who put the ship on 
autopilot but that he took it off before trying to make critical turns prior to 
running aground. 
</P>
<P>
Cousins also testified that at no time while the ship was lunging into shallow 
water did the alarm on the ship's fathometer sound. 
</P>
<P>
Cousins said the distance between the ice and Bligh Reef was nine-tenths of a 
mile. The Exxon Valdez was heading east, toward lighted and charted reefs and 
islands, when he ordered the series of right turns. 
</P>
<P>
NTSB questioning focused on ice conditions, tanker-turning capabilities and 
crew decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
The panel is trying to determine why the tanker strayed far from the shipping 
lane on a clear night, whether Hazelwood was drunk and why Cousins was in 
command. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
28 Witnesses Scheduled 
</P>
<P>
The panel will question more than two dozen witnesses, including Coast Guard 
personnel and Exxon executives, and try to determine whether the Coast Guard, 
the oil industry and the state reacted as promptly as possible to the spill. 
</P>
<P>
The inquiry is scheduled to hear 28 witnesses, including eight Exxon crewmen, 
representatives from the state, Exxon, the Coast Guard and Alyeska Pipeline 
Service Co., a consortium of oil companies that runs the 800-mile Alaskan 
pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
The board's report on the cause of the accident will take up to a year to 
complete, NTSB spokeswoman Drucella Andersen said. 
</P>
<P>
Cousins' testimony, delivered in a monotone, seemed to take on an air of 
despair when he revealed that he was not supposed to be on duty when the ship 
ran into trouble. Cousins reported telling his replacement, the second mate, to 
take his time coming up to bridge to start his shift because he, Cousins, was 
feeling fine.

EDUCATION AT STANDSTILL ON STRIKE'S SECOND DAY; 
</P>
<P>
REPORT OF NEW CONTRACT PROPOSAL IS DISPUTED; MORE UPPER-GRADE STUDENTS DESERT 
CAMPUSES 
</P>

<P>
With education grinding to a standstill, the Los Angeles Unified School 
District weathered its second day of a teachers' strike Tuesday amid rumblings 
of possible new contract offers but no signs that a settlement was near. 
</P>
<P>
Larger numbers of students, particularly in the upper grades, stayed away from 
classes Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
At Franklin High School in Highland Park, about 500 students stormed school 
gates just before 10 a.m., after administrators attempted to lock them inside 
the campus. Students had planned a walkout to show their support for striking 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"It was crazy," said 11th-grader Jeri Naylor. "Everybody was going nuts." 
</P>
<P>
District officials said that, based on morning attendance reports, about 
325,000 students were in school Tuesday, down from the 430,000 recorded Monday. 
But many school administrators conceded that the number of students who 
actually stayed in school all day was far lower. The district has 594,000 
students. 
</P>
<P>
District sources said the Board of Education was considering a package of 
proposals from the union, including a new salary proposal. Board member Warren 
Furutani said that among the "range of discussions" taking place is a contract 
provision requiring non-union members to pay union dues, or an "agency fee." 
The proposals also include a 22.5% pay increase -- compared to the earlier 
district offer of 21.5% -- over three years and a contract extending to five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
A source close to the negotiations said that the agency fee has joined the 
salary increase as a major stumbling block to settlement of the strike. 
</P>
<P>
But United Teachers-Los Angeles President Wayne Johnson denied that the union 
had proposed a counter-offer on pay and added that the dues issue is not new. 
Union spokeswoman Catherine Carey said the agency fee "won't be an obstacle" to 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
After a four-hour closed meeting downtown late Tuesday, school board President 
Roberta Weintraub said that, short of concessions on the union's part, the 
strike was not likely to end before Friday, when the district expects to 
receive answers on the amount of new state money for next year. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he fears that the chances for a quick settlement are fading. "I am 
much less hopeful today than yesterday," he said in an interview at union 
eadquarters near downtown. He said he had not had contact with any school board 
member since a telephone conversation with board member Jackie Goldberg on 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to give specifics of his talks with Goldberg, but said the union 
continues to be interested in a contract that would offer teachers a 10% 
retroactive pay raise this year, between 5.5% and 9% in 1990 and 8% in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian is expected to release the revised state budget as early 
as Thursday, which officials on both sides hope will provide some answers to 
questions about the amount of extra money the district can expect this year. 
The district's latest offer provides that teachers would receive a maximum of 
an 8% raise in 1990 if new state money becomes available. The district's 
three-year offer currently proposes 8% retroactive to last July, 5.5% in 1990 
and 8% in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Expected today is a report from a state fact-finder who has been reviewing 
district finances and weighing them against union demands. But neither side in 
the labor dispute is required to abide by the fact-finder's report. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the state Court of Appeal has not made a decision on the union's 
request Monday for an emergency injunction to stop Supt. Leonard Britton's 
order that teachers hand in grade books or face withholding of pay. 
</P>
<P>
At the schools Tuesday, the scene was much the same as Monday, with classes 
doubled and tripled-up to make the best use of limited staffing. On most 
campuses, skeleton staffs relied on television, movies and games to help pass 
the time. The operative word -- at least among students -- was "boring." 
</P>
<P>
"We just sat around," Wilson Chu, 12, a student at Castelar Street Elementary 
School in Chinatown, said just before sitting down to a screening of an 
educational film titled "Boy With Glasses." "We didn't have a teacher. The 
teacher was next door." 
</P>
<P>
Before classes began, teachers stopped by the school office to pick up 
materials, which included handouts with activities such as "Name as many kinds 
of windstorms as you can," "Make up three names for rock groups" and "Name as 
many breeds of dogs as you can." 
</P>
<P>
"This is not productive," said Principal William Chun Hoon. "Everyone knows 
that. This is not education. We say we are doing what we should be doing, but 
it's not the same." 
</P>
<P>
At Walter Reed Junior High School in North Hollywood, ninth-grader Allan Reiss 
said Tuesday morning: "I came back to see if there were any parties. . . . 
There's nothing to do here but watch TV." 
</P>
<P>
At Carpenter Avenue School in Studio City, second-grader Ronnie Williams, said, 
"We played kick ball. Then we got to do some work. Then we got lunch. Then we 
got to see half of 'ET.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calm at Eagle Rock 
</P>
<P>
At Eagle Rock Junior-Senior High School, where only about 700 of the 2,100 
students were present Tuesday, the mood was eerily calm. 
</P>
<P>
Groups of boys were seen leaping over high fences onto Yosemite Drive while 
others simply strolled out the front gate on La Roda Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"We were here yesterday and we wanted to see if it was any different," said 
Joey Hamori, a senior, who was leaving the school with three friends after the 
first period. "It's not really worth it." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest disturbance was at Franklin High. Angelina Barriga, an 11th-grader, 
said students got out by jumping fences, breaking through gates and rushing 
past school police officers. Some left through unlocked rear exits. 
</P>
<P>
Principal Ed Rosas said the doors were locked to protect the students. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to make sure students didn't get hurt," he said. "We wanted nothing 
to get out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
Only 100 of Franklin's 2,400 students remained on campus after Tuesday's 
walkout, Rosas said. 
</P>
<P>
Police were called to the scene after reports that the students were blocking 
traffic, but a spokesman for the LAPD's Northeast Division said there were no 
injuries or arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Merchants and security directors at shopping malls reported seeing more 
students than usual during school hours. 
</P>
<P>
"We're definitely seeing an influx of juveniles," said Terry DeNiro, assistant 
security director at the Beverly Center in West Los Angeles. Normally the 
shopping center tries to enforce a policy of keeping school-age youths out of 
the mall during school hours, "but with the strike going on," he said, "that's 
something we decided we're not going to bother with." 
</P>
<P>
At the Eagle Rock Plaza, however, some merchants said they were on the alert 
for shoplifting, because of the increase in young visitors from nearby schools. 
</P>
<P>
"It does create a security problem," said Jerry Motzel, manager of Karls Toys. 
"Instead of the schools being the baby-sitter, the malls and other 
entertainments are the baby-sitters today." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, district and union officials issued conflicting reports on how many 
teachers remained on strike Tuesday. Johnson said 23,000 of the district's 
32,000 teachers, counselors, nurses and librarians were honoring the picket 
lines, although he predicted that there would be some attrition by the end of 
the week. 
</P>
<P>
The district said about 11,250 regular teachers came to work, 1,000 more than 
on Monday. Those figures do not include the 2,400 administrators and 
substitutes who were in the classrooms both days. 
</P>
<P>
The district said teachers were "trickling back" into schools in three regions 
-- the south San Fernando Valley, the Eastside and Central Los Angeles. 
District spokeswoman Diana Munatones said between one and seven teachers per 
school, who had not been in class Monday, reported to work Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees It From Two Sides 
</P>
<P>
But that did not include economics teacher Chuck Payne, who was on the picket 
line Tuesday at North Hollywood High School. Payne said he views the contract 
dispute from a unique vantage point: He also serves as president of the Newhall 
Elementary School District Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really undecided for a while, because I was on the other side, as a 
board member," Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
But he said he changed his mind after Britton ordered teachers to submit final 
grade records early to circumvent the union's original plan to begin a strike 
May 30. 
</P>
<P>
About 400 substitutes recruited last weekend were staffing classrooms, 
Munatones said. Another 400 have been hired but will not be assigned to schools 
until the district receives confirmation that they have passed health tests. 
</P>
<P>
The district also reported that fewer than one-third of high school teachers 
and less than half of elementary and junior high instructors turned in grade 
roll books, which were due Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Associate Supt. Gabriel Cortina acknowledged Tuesday that it will be "very, 
very difficult" to provide final grades for the district's students by June 23, 
when the school year is set to end. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely going to cause problems for this district and the students if 
the substitutes have to diagnose where the students are without the roll 
books," he said. "It means that we will have to make every effort to piece 
together the work students have done already." 
</P>
<P>
The seven-member school board remains divided over contract issues, chiefly 
over money. Only three members -- Goldberg, Furutani and Julie Korenstein -- 
are willing to raise the district's last salary offer of a 21.5% raise over 
three years. District officials say $120 million in cuts over two years would 
be needed to finance the 21.5% offer, and Weintraub, Rita Walters and Alan 
Gershman are unwilling to make deeper spending cuts to pay for a higher salary 
raise. 
</P>
<P>
"I will confirm that one of the major items remains the money and with the 
focus being on UTLA's attempt to convince the district that it should risk 
further cuts by promising money before it's here," said district negotiator 
Dick Fisher. "At the same time, UTLA is unwilling to take a chance itself . . . 
They don't lose anything if (the extra money) doesn't come in. We've really 
been hoping they would think that through."

CHINA VOWS MORE DEMOCRACY IN BID TO QUELL PROTESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, appealing for a halt in student 
protests, pledged early today that China will implement democratic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"We will . . . work out concrete measures to enhance democracy and law, oppose 
corruption, build an honest and clean government and expand openness," Zhao 
said in a message to student hunger strikers quoted by the official New China 
News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The message was delivered shortly after midnight to students gathered in 
central Beijing's Tian An Men Square, the agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Students Reject Appeal 
</P>
<P>
Student leaders announced shortly after dawn that they are rejecting Zhao's 
request for a halt in the demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the students in the square said they are planning to set off on a march 
through Beijing around 2 p.m. today, on a route that would take them past the 
Diaoyutai state guest house, where visiting Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev is staying, and then back to Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 students who have been on a hunger strike in the square -- many 
of them since Saturday -- have become the core of massive daily demonstrations. 
Tuesday evening, hours before Zhao's message was announced, a huge 
pro-democracy rally centered on the fasting students had drawn about 150,000 
demonstrators, supporters and onlookers to the square. 
</P>
<P>
Zhao's statement was issued "on behalf of all the members of the Standing 
Committee" of the Communist Party Politburo, according to the official news 
agency report. 
</P>
<P>
The Politburo Standing Committee, which is the top organ of political power in 
China, has four other members: Premier Li Peng, Vice Premier Yao Yilin, Qiao 
Shi and Hu Qili. Deng Xiaoping, 84, China's senior leader, is not a member. 
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that the party and government leadership "affirmed the students' 
patriotic spirit in calling for democracy and law, opposing corruption and 
striving to further the reform," the news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
"We also hope that all students will exercise calm, reason, restraint and 
order, take the interests of the whole country into account and safeguard 
stability and unity," Zhao said. 
</P>
<P>
A woman student leader said that Zhao's statement was "meaningless." 
</P>
<P>
Another hunger striker, interviewed later in the morning, said that Zhao's 
promises "are about the same as he has been saying the last few days." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Specific Demands' 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't satisfied our specific demands," this man said. 
</P>
<P>
The hunger strikers are demanding that the government hold a formal televised 
dialogue with protest representatives to discuss the promotion of democratic 
reforms. Student demands also include retraction of a hard-line editorial 
published last month in the official party newspaper People's Daily, which 
accused demonstrators of plotting to overthrow the Communist Party. The 
editorial is widely believed to have reflected Deng's personal instructions. 
</P>
<P>
Other key goals expressed by the students are more press freedom, improved 
treatment of intellectuals and an attack on corruption. 
</P>
<P>
Zhao's statement to the students came only hours after he publicly revealed to 
the nation that when Deng, China's top leader since 1978, stepped down from the 
Communist Party Politburo two years ago, a formal decision was made that "on 
the most important issues, we still need him at the helm." 
</P>
<P>
This was "an extremely important decision" that had never been announced 
before, Zhao said in comments during a late-afternoon meeting with Gorbachev, 
which were later televised on the nationwide evening news. 
</P>
<P>
"The entire party knows that we cannot do without him -- we cannot do without 
his wisdom and experience," Zhao said. 
</P>
<P>
The full implications of Zhao's remarks about Deng, and why he chose to make 
them, are not clear. But one effect of his statement would be to remind 
everyone that Deng has been the ultimate authority responsible both for China's 
generally successful economic reforms of the past decade and for the various 
shortcomings that so many protesters are now angry about. 
</P>
<P>
An underlying theme of the student-led protests that have engulfed Beijing 
since mid-April is that too much power is concentrated in Deng, and that it is 
time for him to make way for younger leaders more in tune with demands for 
political reform. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bold Attacks on Deng 
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, protesters have become increasingly bold in attacking 
Deng by name. 
</P>
<P>
"We Don't Want a Helmsman," declared one banner at the square Tuesday evening, 
in apparent response to Zhao's statement about needing Deng at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
"Deng Xiaoping -- When People Get Past 80, They Get Muddled," proclaimed 
another. 
</P>
<P>
A third banner attacked the corruption often associated with reform in China, 
and called for ideological hard-liners to resign. "The reformist faction should 
be honest and the conservative faction should quickly step down," it said. 
</P>
<P>
Display of such frank sentiments in public would have been extremely dangerous 
only a little more than a month ago, possibly leading to arrest or other forms 
of punishment such as criticism at one's school or workplace. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators Fan Out 
</P>
<P>
But Tuesday, growing numbers of demonstrators fanned out in the downtown area 
and other scattered parts of the city, making sidewalk speeches to all who 
cared to listen, soliciting contributions to support the protests, and marching 
in banner-waving groups to the square. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past few days, growing numbers of non-students have been joining in 
the protests, adding a new element of unpredictability to developments. 
</P>
<P>
Contingents of workers from factories around Beijing joined the flow toward 
Tian An Men Square on Tuesday, many carrying banners identifying their 
workplaces and supporting students' demands. 
</P>
<P>
The hunger strike added a strong note of tension to an otherwise generally 
festive scene. By Tuesday evening, ambulances were constantly moving to and 
from the square to remove students who had fainted, most of them apparently 
from a combination of hunger, exhaustion and dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
In his message to the students, Zhao also sought to allay student fears that 
once the protests end, leaders will be punished. 
</P>
<P>
"He promised that the party and government will never 'wait until after the 
situation cools down to settle accounts,' " the official news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
"He said the party Central Committee hoped the students would take care of 
themselves and end the strike, and he wished they would recover as soon as 
possible," it added. 
</P>
<P>
Both Zhao and Premier Li Peng stressed in their talks with Gorbachev that China 
intends to push forward with political reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think that freedom, democracy and human rights are a monopoly of the 
capitalist countries," Li said during his meeting with the Soviet leader. 
"People in socialist countries should also enjoy freedom, democracy and 
sufficient human rights. China is prepared to improve these aspects in its 
political reform." 
</P>
<P>
By the time Zhao's message to the students was delivered, more than 350 hunger 
strikers had been taken away for medical treatment, according to medical 
workers from Beijing hospitals who were at the square. 
</P>
<P>
Several thousand students in Shanghai staged a march and sit-down protest 
Tuesday in support of the Beijing students, according to reports from that 
city. The sit-down demonstration, in front of the municipal government 
building, was still continuing late Tuesday evening, according to the New China 
News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Educators Issue Plea 
</P>
<P>
The presidents of 10 major universities in Beijing issued a plea Tuesday for 
students and the government to quickly find a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply concerned with the future of the country as well as the health 
and life of the students," the statement said, according to the news agency. 
</P>
<P>
"The presidents said that the only correct solution to the hunger strike now is 
to conduct a dialogue," it said. "They called for an immediate end to the 
confrontation between students and the government." 
</P>
<P>
Chinese journalists also appeared at the square to demonstrate Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yong, an anchorman on the state-run national television network's nightly 
English newscast, was among a group of television station employees who joined 
in a protest march Tuesday. He said his colleagues were "very, very 
embarrassed" by the limitations placed on their coverage of the past few weeks 
of protests. 
</P>
<P>
Another group of journalists, from the official Guangming Daily, hoisted a 
banner that declared: "Government -- How Long Will You Allow the Students to 
Starve?"

DEMILITARIZED BORDER URGED BY GORBACHEV 
</P>

<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev proposed here Tuesday that China and the 
Soviet Union mark their new rapprochement through the step-by-step 
demilitarization of their 4,500-mile border, now one of the world's most 
heavily defended frontiers. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the Sino-Soviet border to be protected only by friendship," Gorbachev 
told Chinese Premier Li Peng in a day of extensive discussions on international 
issues and bilateral relations during the first Sino-Soviet summit meeting in 
30 years. "We stand for a radical detente between us." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev and Chinese leaders also discussed a program of extensive economic 
cooperation and a broad series of scientific, technical and cultural exchanges 
to rebuild their once-friendly relations, all but destroyed by three decades of 
bitter rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
"End the past and open up the future," Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, 
said as he met Gorbachev at the Great Hall of the People and announced the 
normalization of Sino-Soviet relations. "This is something that not only our 
peoples, but the whole world, has been waiting for. . . . It will have a major 
impact on the world." 
</P>
<P>
But serious differences continued Tuesday between China and the Soviet Union 
over Cambodia: the terms for Vietnam's withdrawal, promised for Sept. 30; the 
government that will be formed afterward, and the future roles of the People's 
Revolutionary Party of Kampuchea, which now holds power and has Vietnamese and 
Soviet backing, and the Khmer Rouge, which was ousted by Vietnam in 1979 but 
still has strong Chinese support. 
</P>

After an "in-depth" discussion between Deng and Gorbachev on Indochina during 
their 2 1/2-hour meeting, "both shared some convergent views, but nothing 
concrete was reached," Li Zhaoxing, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, 
told reporters. The two countries' foreign ministers will meet today to 
continue the discussion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disagreement on Cambodia 
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian issue was the last serious point of contention in drafting a 
joint communique proclaiming the normalization of Sino-Soviet ties and laying 
the principles for future relations, Soviet officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cambodian settlement is gradually taking on a realistic shape," Gorbachev 
said in a speech this morning, stressing the Soviet desire for an early 
compromise. "The main principle on which it can and must be based is the 
principle of national self-determination, which is the only correct one. Only 
the Cambodians -- and no one else -- can find the formula of agreement and of 
the future political structure of their country. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet Union is ready to take part in the appropriate international 
guarantees and to respect any choice of the people of Cambodia and their 
country's course of independence, neutrality and nonalignment." 
</P>
<P>
Meeting with Deng and other Chinese leaders in a day of intensive discussions 
on Tuesday, Gorbachev had stressed the need for the two countries to broaden 
and deepen their ties to overcome the long hostility between them and to 
fashion a new cooperative relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that Sino-Soviet relations can be proclaimed as normal," Gorbachev was 
quoted by Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Soviet spokesman, as telling Deng, "we must 
think about how to develop them in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, who arrived Monday for the first visit by his country's top leader 
since 1959, addressed a meeting of Chinese intellectuals this morning in the 
Great Hall of the People. He is scheduled to give an interview on Chinese 
television and hold a press conference later today in addition to seeing the 
Great Wall outside Beijing and touring the capital's Palace Museum. On 
Thursday, he visits Shanghai, China's largest city, before flying home to 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Setting out Soviet hopes for its new relationship with China, Gorbachev told 
the writers, artists, scientists, engineers and other members of the Chinese 
intelligentsia that even with the hostility of the past 30 years, he believes 
that "the positive trend in our relations far outweighs the legacy of mistrust 
and conflicts." 
</P>
<P>
But the past decades have shown, he continued, that it is "far easier to sour 
or destroy relations between countries than to build and consolidate them and 
make them fruitful. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Erroneous Decisions' 
</P>
<P>
"A few erroneous decisions taken in disregard of a partner's interests, 
attempts to impose on him one's own views and an escalation of mutual 
grievances to the political level as well as elevating ideological disputes and 
disagreements to the point of confrontation between states may result in 
dividing one-time friends by a wall of suspicion and animosity. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Let me express confidence that the leaders and peoples of our two countries 
will make sure that such errors, so difficult to correct, are not repeated." 
</P>
<P>
His speech was extensively rewritten Tuesday evening, according to Soviet 
sources, to reflect the discussions with Chinese leaders and to take account of 
the continuing mass protests in Tian An Men Square demanding greater democracy. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, stopped their car briefly in 
southwest Beijing to greet residents while on the way from the Great Hall to 
the state guest house where they are staying. The couple was quickly mobbed by 
well-wishers. 
</P>
<P>
While trying to avoid involvement in China's complex political scene, Gorbachev 
expressed his sympathy with the Chinese leaders Tuesday as they reviewed 
political and economic reforms in the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
"Both societies have hotheads who want to renovate socialism," he told Zhao 
Ziyang, general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, "but they want to do 
it overnight. Things like this, however, cannot be done so quickly. It is just 
impossible. But such hotheads exist in both societies." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Talks Called Historic 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's talks Tuesday with Deng, Zhao and Li were described as historic by 
Gerasimov, the Soviet spokesman, because, he said, they not only ended the 
lengthy hostility between the two countries but also laid the basis for a new 
relationship intended to reduce international tensions. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet president discussed the international scene extensively with both 
Deng and Li, according to Chinese and Soviet spokesmen, who said there was 
broad agreement on many issues. 
</P>
<P>
Praising the improvement of Soviet-American relations, the Chinese leaders 
called for further progress on reducing the superpowers' nuclear arsenals. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, in his speech today, reiterated Moscow's view that reducing 
international tensions and resolving world problems do not depend on just the 
most powerful nations. 
</P>
<P>
"The world is becoming integrated and, figuratively speaking, 'more tightly 
knit,' but at the same time it is also becoming more diverse and even 
'expanding,' " he said, noting that many major problems required international 
action but that more and more countries asserted their "unconditional right to 
choose freely their own road." 
</P>
<P>
"Here lies one of the real contradictions of our time, one that cannot be 
ignored. We would run a grave risk if we tried to remove that contradiction 
through the use of force, by imposing on people some social system or by 
forcing on them the rules of conduct devised by some high council of great 
powers. Our Gordian knots cannot be cut. They ought to be prudently untied." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's proposal for a sharp reduction in the large forces on the 
Sino-Soviet frontier -- one of the bold initiatives that have become his 
trademark in international diplomacy -- will test Beijing's declared commitment 
to lowering tensions between the two countries and in Asia generally. 
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to work for the withdrawal, on terms to be agreed with China, 
of military units and armaments from the border areas, leaving only the 
personnel required for performing routine border guard duties," he said in his 
address today. "Demilitarizing the Sino-Soviet border and turning it into a 
border of peace and good-neighborliness is a noble goal that we could attain 
through joint efforts." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demilitarization Talks 
</P>
<P>
Although Moscow has already begun reducing its forces along the Sino-Soviet 
border through Central Asia and the Far East and had earlier pledged to cut 
them by a further 200,000 in the next two years, Gorbachev suggested 
negotiations on the progressive demilitarization of the frontier. It was the 
scene of major border clashes in 1969 and continuing incidents through the 
1970s and early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
He proposed negotiations aimed first at withdrawing a large number of troops 
from the immediate border area, gradually reducing their number and deploying 
those that remained in clearly defensive postures. 
</P>
<P>
China, as part of the overall reduction of its armed forces several years ago, 
reportedly thinned out its border garrisons. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union has an estimated 500,000 troops in the border region, and 
China is believed to have more. Western authorities believe that Soviet 
weaponry is greatly superior to that of the Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Speed Border Work 
</P>
<P>
Although significant differences remain between the two countries over their 
border -- where it lies and whether much of the present-day Soviet Union was 
originally Chinese territory as Beijing contends -- a bilateral commission is 
resolving the problems, according to Chinese and Soviet officials. It is to be 
upgraded shortly to give greater impetus to the work. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the border question to be settled quickly so that it does not remain a 
problem in our new relationship," Gerasimov said. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Moscow began the pullout of three-fourths of its troops in Mongolia, 
a close Kremlin ally wedged between the Soviet Union and China, and Gorbachev 
said the rest could be withdrawn if Mongolia agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev also suggested resumption of military exchanges between the two 
countries, similar to those the Soviet Union now has with the United States and 
other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reassure Other Nations 
</P>
<P>
But Gorbachev and Chinese leaders again stressed that the improvement of 
Sino-Soviet relations is not intended to bring the re-establishment of the 
alliance the two Communist powers had in the 1950s, nor is it directed, they 
said, against any other countries. 
</P>
<P>
"From the very outset, one thought invariably present in our talks with the 
Chinese leaders," Gorbachev said today, "was that the improvement of 
Sino-Soviet relations is not directed against anyone and does not require from 
China or from the Soviet Union that they relinquish their existing ties with 
other countries -- whether socialist or capitalist, developing or developed, 
Western or Eastern. Normal Sino-Soviet relations serve the interests of the 
entire world community and are consistent with the prevailing international 
trends." 
</P>
<P>
A program for economic cooperation and increased trade is now under discussion, 
according to Soviet officials, although Premier Li, who is himself a 
Soviet-trained electrical engineer, complained that Soviet bureaucracy is 
seriously hampering rapid expansion of economic ties. 
</P>
<P>
Recalling how he had forced a resolution of domestic economic differences, 
Gorbachev jokingly suggested locking the officials responsible for the problems 
in a country house until they had agreed on a solution to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"The potential for economic cooperation is perhaps of several orders of 
magnitude greater than what we have now," Gorbachev told his audience, urging 
them to work for its development. "This cannot be realized at one go. What 
needs to be done is to identify promising areas, settle complex problems of 
pricing and help enterprises find suitable partners. It will also take time to 
train personnel and regain expertise that was lost to a large extent over the 
years when our economic relations were virtually suspended." 
</P>
<P>
He proposed the increase of traditional Sino-Soviet trade, an exchange of raw 
materials and heavy machinery from the Soviet Union for consumer goods and food 
from China, and a series of joint ventures undertaken by Chinese and Soviet 
enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
He also suggested two major projects -- construction of a pipeline to carry 
coal slurry from Chinese mines and completion of a new railway from China's 
Xianjiang province through Soviet Central Asia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Marxism Updating Needed 
</P>
<P>
Discussing the future of socialism with Deng, who has become the great reformer 
of Chinese communism, Gorbachev said that Marxism needs a substantial updating 
to cope with present-day problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Karl Marx lived in the last century," Gorbachev said, "and he cannot provide 
the answers for all the problems of today. Marx, in fact, did not foresee the 
Bolshevik Revolution, and Lenin (founder of the Soviet state) did not foresee 
the Chinese revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"The way we adapt to those new conditions and demonstrate the potential of 
socialism will determine the influence of socialism on the world." 
</P>
<P>
But Moscow no longer believes that there can be "one model or scheme" of 
socialism for all, Gorbachev continued. "Each country has to deal with its 
problems in its own way and considering its overall development."

LOBBYISTS ASKED TO AID WRIGHT DEFENSE; 
</P>
<P>
HELP PAY LAWYERS' FEES, 100 TEXANS ARE URGED BY SPEAKER'S ALLIES

<P>
Acting with Speaker Jim Wright's approval, four of his allies in the House have 
appealed to leading Texas corporate and labor union lobbyists to help pay the 
cost of defending him against House Ethics Committee charges, Rep. Charles 
Wilson (D-Tex.) said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign to defray the fast-rising bills from the Speaker's eight-lawyer 
team was started Monday at an Austin, Tex., meeting of more than 100 lobbyists 
coordinated by Wright's chief of staff, Marshall Lynam. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said that the fund-raising was "distasteful" to Wright but was essential 
because the Speaker would have to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to 
prepare his legal defense. Mark Johnson, a spokesman for the Speaker, said that 
legal defense funds are permitted under House rules. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defense Foundation Started 
</P>
<P>
The Texans attending the Austin meeting, Wilson said, were told that they could 
donate to Wright's campaign fund or to a newly organized Wright legal defense 
foundation to be based in Ft. Worth. The defense foundation can accept 
unlimited amounts from individuals, corporations or labor unions that do not 
have a direct interest in legislation. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Wilson said, the contributions to the foundation would be made in 
such a way that Wright would not know who gave money. 
</P>
<P>
"They were all pretty enthusiastic because they know how much (Wright) means to 
the state," Wilson told reporters. "We can raise whatever it takes -- we're not 
going to lose this because we can't afford the lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Wilson, appeals for funds were made by three other Texas allies 
of Wright in the House -- Jack Brooks, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, J. 
J. Pickle and Martin Frost. 
</P>
<P>
When asked for comment on the fund-raising drive, House Minority Whip Newt 
Gingrich (R-Ga.) said that Wright should "step aside" as Speaker until the 
charges against him have been resolved by the House ethics panel or the House 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
"The notion that we have a man sitting in the chair raising defense funds is a 
problem," Gingrich said. "If we were behaving reasonably, he would step aside 
and let somebody like (Rep. William H.) Natcher (D-Ky.) serve as an interim 
Speaker." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gingrich Also Accused 
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman for Wright brushed aside the suggestion by Gingrich, who 
brought the original charges against the Speaker a year ago and has himself 
been accused by a Democratic congressman of violating House rules with an 
unusual $105,000 book promotion fund. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson also rejected the idea, saying that Wright has a strong case in his 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Politically, we're weak because of the daily pounding (in the press) that 
we're taking," Wilson said. "My advice to the Speaker is to act like a Texas 
jack rabbit in a hailstorm -- hunker down and take it." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Speaker maintained that he was not being distracted by the 
year-old investigation into his financial affairs. 
</P>
<P>
When told that some members of the House are speculating that the investigation 
eventually might cost him his leadership post, Wright replied he has read that 
in the newspapers but that "my colleagues have not said that to me. I don't 
think it's a prevailing sentiment. The important thing is that Congress perform 
its work and not be distracted." 
</P>
<P>
In another development, the House ethics panel questioned Henry Simon, an 
attorney for George A. Mallick Jr., a Ft. Worth developer who is a key figure 
in the investigation of the Speaker. Other witnesses, including Mallick's son, 
Michael, who played a role in an oil and gas investment that led to a quick 
profit for Wright, are to be questioned later this week. 
</P>
<P>
One of Wright's new attorneys, Stephen D. Susman of Houston, said that the 
expanded inquiry into this transaction is frivolous because Wright's holdings 
were in a blind trust at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Although Susman once said he would need 30 days to be briefed on the case, he 
said Tuesday that he would be ready to begin an ethics panel hearing quickly if 
the committee rules against the Speaker's motion to dismiss the basic charges 
on grounds that they have no basis under the panel's operating rules. 
</P>
<P>
"It's in the best interests of my client to get this thing done quickly," 
Susman said. 
</P>
<P>
Wright is accused of violating House rules on 69 occasions by scheming to evade 
a House limit on speaking fees and by accepting $145,000 in gifts from Mallick 
over a 10-year period. The Speaker has denied any wrongdoing but has said that 
he may have made "technical" mistakes in filing his financial disclosure 
reports.

WITNESS DENIES WRIGHT PROMISED FAVOR TO S&amp;LS

A former savings association officer on trial for conspiracy on Tuesday 
contradicted the earlier testimony of a colleague who had said that House 
Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) once promised to block a key piece of legislation 
in return for political contributions from Texas savings and loan executives. 
</P>
<P>
"I never heard that. Jim Wright never told me that," John W. Harrell, former 
chief executive officer of Commodore Savings Assn., told a federal court jury. 
</P>
<P>
Harrell and two others are being tried on charges that they conspired to 
violate campaign finance laws by funneling illegal corporate contributions to 
the East Texas First Political Action Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony of Harrell and other witnesses at the two-week-old trial is of 
interest to the House Ethics Committee, which has requested a transcript as 
part of its investigation into Wright's conduct and his personal finances. 
</P>
<P>
Harrell contradicted May 5 testimony by Donald R. Farmer, one-time chief 
financial officer of Commodore, who had said that Wright pledged to block 
legislation unfavorable to the Texas savings and loan industry in 1985 if 
executives of 10 thrift associations would contribute a total of $250,000 to 
help another Texas Democrat who was running in a special congressional 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Harrell's testimony, which supported statements by Wright himself, was 
significant because Farmer had claimed that Harrell told him of Wright's 
promise. 
</P>
<P>
But Harrell said that Wright, at two meetings with thrift officials, merely had 
expressed support for the beleaguered industry and had told executives that "he 
was much aware of our problems." 
</P>
<P>
"Did he ever guarantee that a piece of legislation would be tabled?" asked 
Harrell's defense lawyer, William Hill, referring to a bill that died in 
Congress that would have greatly restricted the investment powers of 
state-chartered thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
"I never heard that," Harrell replied. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional ethics experts have said that such a promise by Wright would 
clearly have violated congressional standards of conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Harrell's account substantially agreed with testimony given Monday by Robert 
Hopkins, a co-defendant who was Commodore's board chairman. The trial is 
expected to conclude this week.

JUSTICE KENNEDY BLOCKS AN ABORTION FOR FLORIDA GIRL, 15 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a highly unusual move, Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy granted an 
emergency request by a legal guardian for an "unborn child" Tuesday and blocked 
a 15-year-old Florida girl from having an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's order was issued about three hours after the Florida Supreme Court 
said that the girl could go ahead with her abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The full U.S. Supreme Court will consider the issue Thursday and may lift or 
continue Kennedy's order then. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possibly Decisive Votes 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, former President Ronald Reagan's third nominee to the high court, and 
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor hold the two unknown and probably decisive votes in 
a major abortion case now pending before the court. 
</P>
<P>
His surprise order Tuesday was unusual because the U.S. Supreme Court 
traditionally does not act on cases pending in state courts. Rather, it has 
been the court's practice to review only the final orders of a state's highest 
court. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, the Florida Supreme Court has not issued a final order but 
instead announced Friday that it will consider in September the 
constitutionality of a law regulating abortions for minors. In the interim, the 
state court said, minor girls may go ahead with abortions. 
</P>
<P>
But, acting on a request Tuesday morning by a lawyer representing the "unborn 
child" of a minor, Kennedy issued an order to block any further action by the 
girl in this case. 
</P>
<P>
The girl, now 12 weeks pregnant and identified only as "T. W.," is caught in an 
intense legal struggle over Florida's new law regulating abortions for minors. 
Until Kennedy's order is lifted, she is forbidden to get an abortion in that 
state. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 Florida statute says that a minor girl may not get an abortion without 
the consent of her parents or the permission of a judge. Fearing "abuse" from 
her parents, T. W. on May 2 asked a judge in Lake County, Fla., for permission 
to have an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than simply grant her request, the judge struck down the entire law as 
"unconstitutionally vague" and "arbitrary." However, the same judge appointed a 
lawyer, Richard Boylston, to represent T. W.'s unborn child in an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Boylston did, but lost. On Friday, a state appellate court agreed that the law 
was unconstitutional. On the same day, however, the Florida Supreme Court 
announced that it would hear a further appeal in the fall. But, so that the 
girl would not be penalized by the legal dispute, the state judges lifted any 
court orders applying to her as of Tuesday at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy has the duty to consider emergency appeals from the Southeast region, 
and Boylston urged him Tuesday morning to intervene in the Florida case. "In 
the absence of a stay, the unborn child of T. W., a minor, and hundreds of 
other unborn children will be aborted pending a decision by the Florida Supreme 
Court," the attorney said in his petition. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy responded a few hours later by granting the requested stay, presumably 
to take the matter before the full court. His action, in effect, reinstates the 
1988 law for all other pregnant minors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fetus' Rights Curbed 
</P>
<P>
In the Roe vs. Wade ruling of 1973, the Supreme Court said that a woman has a 
constitutional right to end her pregnancy in the first trimester. In addition, 
the justices refused to recognize a legal right for a fetus in the early months 
of a pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
But Kennedy's appointment last year created a five-member conservative majority 
on the court, and the justices are now considering a Missouri case that they 
could use to revise or even overrule the Roe decision.

The woman jogger who was raped and beaten by a gang of youths in Central Park 
last month has taken her first, shaky steps since the attack and is able to 
write her name again, her doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert S. Kurtz said, however, that it remains unknown how fully she will 
recover. 
</P>
<P>
"The more small neurologic improvements are registered, the more clearly 
apparent it becomes how great a distance she has yet to travel," said Kurtz, 
director of surgical intensive care at Metropolitan Hospital. "She is now able 
to take a few walking steps, although her gait is still broad-based and 
unsteady." 
</P>
<P>
She also can now write her name in a shaky hand, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old investment banker was assaulted April 19 as she took her 
nightly exercise in the park. Six teen-agers have been indicted in the crime.

ISRAEL ENFORCES OUSTER OF ARAB WORKERS

Israel on Tuesday implemented its order sending Palestinian workers from the 
Gaza Strip back home as Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin took a hard-line in 
explaining the action. An indefinite curfew in the strip, confining its 600,000 
residents to their homes, continued. 
</P>
<P>
The moves came as Israeli officials were warning that matters could get worse 
for the Arabs if they do not accept the government's peace proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Rabin said the restrictions on the thousands of Gaza Strip workers employed in 
Israel -- the first such action since the intifada began -- are meant to show 
"that the privilege of free travel and work in Israel cannot be taken for 
granted." 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that hundreds of Arabs were detained by soldiers on the main 
roads leading into the Gaza Strip. Police officers were checking identification 
cards of Palestinians in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank work at 
mostly menial jobs in Israel. Workers from the West Bank were still being 
allowed to report to their employers, although similar action was being 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
Rabin, in remarks made to Israeli army radio, said the Palestinians "will 
understand that they have only one alternative to proceed to peace, and that is 
on the basis of the government initiative." 
</P>
<P>
"There is not and there will not be," Rabin said, "another alternative for 
diplomatic procedures related to the Palestinians which is not based on the 
government initiative." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister Binyamin Netanyahu warned that "if Israel wants to put 
the screws to the Palestinians, the situation . . . could be quite different." 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli peace plan proposes elections to select a Palestinian delegation 
that would work out details of a five-year period of autonomy, under Israeli 
rule, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Within three years, 
talks would open on the permanent status of the territories. 
</P>
<P>
Leading Palestinian activists view the measure as a devious means of bringing 
an end to the uprising and prolonging Israeli rule in the occupied territories. 
The Palestinians are demanding that Israel concede to independence for the West 
Bank and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
There have been calls to bar the Gaza Strip workers from crossing into Israel 
since the recent discovery of the body of a soldier who had been picked up as a 
hitchhiker, presumably by Arabs. The Israeli government had resisted such 
calls, expressing a desire to restore normal life in the occupied territories, 
including the continuation of the flow of labor into Israel. 
</P>
<P>
In another development Tuesday, the Israeli police arrested a Palestinian 
activist who was scheduled to attend a meeting with a high-level delegation 
from the U.S. State Department. The delegation is headed by Dennis Ross, the 
director of policy planning, who is considered a key adviser on Middle East 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The activist, Hassan Khatib, a member of the Palestinian Communist Party, was 
picked up at his home in the West Bank town of Ramallah at 2 a.m. The Communist 
Party is one of four factions of the Palestine Liberation Organization active 
in the territories. 
</P>
<P>
Khatib had recently signed a letter addressed to the U.S. Consulate rejecting 
the Israeli election plan. Israeli officials would not give a reason for his 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Mahdi Abdul-Hadi, the head of a Palestinian research institute in Jerusalem, 
said: "The Israelis are clearly sending us a message. They want to force us to 
accept the plan." 
</P>
<P>
Ross met with five other Palestinians known to favor the PLO. The Palestinians 
gave Ross a statement repeating their rejection of the Israeli election plan as 
a public relations ploy. Later in the day, the U.S. representative met with 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. After the meeting, Ross was positive in tone. 
"We find the discussions encouraging. They give us reason to believe there is a 
potential opportunity to build on. . . ."

CAR BOMB IN BEIRUT KILLS MUSLIM LEADER, 21 OTHERS

<P>
A car bomb was exploded by remote control as the spiritual leader of Lebanon's 
Sunni Muslims drove by Tuesday, killing him and 21 other people, police said. 
Seventy-five others were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion in Muslim West Beirut occurred as Arab League mediators were 
trying to consolidate a cease-fire in the latest round of fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Sheik Hassan Khaled was a leading voice for moderation in a country devastated 
by 14 years of sectarian civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Both Christians and Muslims denounced the assassination. There was no claim of 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Khaled was being driven home from his office for lunch when the 
bomb went off in a crowded residential district. Reporters at the scene said 
the explosion destroyed the fronts of buildings at a major road intersection, 
setting nearby cars on fire. 
</P>
<P>
The blast also shattered windows in the residence of Premier Salim Hoss, the 
head of one of Lebanon's rival Cabinets, 100 yards from the scene. It was not 
clear who or what was the target of the blast. 
</P>
<P>
Rescuers had to break the doors of Khaled's smashed black limousine to remove 
his body and those of his driver, his brother-in-law and an unidentified 
companion. 
</P>
<P>
"Our beloved Mufti is murdered!" a police officer screamed through tears as he 
took the blood-stained white turban of the Grand Mufti from the crumpled car. 
Among others killed nearby were four bodyguards. 
</P>
<P>
"The assassin, or assassins, used a remote control device to detonate the car 
bomb, which was rigged with more than 150 kilograms (330 pounds) of TNT," a 
police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the United 
States was "revolted by the cold-blooded killing" and described Khaled as "a 
selfless leader." 
</P>
<P>
Khaled, 68, was spiritual leader of Lebanon's 900,000 Sunni Muslims and was the 
nation's highest-ranking Muslim cleric. 
</P>
<P>
He guided the economically powerful, minority Sunni sect into advocating 
coexistence with Christians and shunning a fighting role in the sectarian war. 
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's majority Shiite Muslims are believed to hold most of the foreigners 
missing in Lebanon. Sunnis are not believed to be involved in hostage-taking. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police in the southern port of Sidon said two West German relief 
workers were apparently kidnaped for the third time. They last disappeared for 
several hours 12 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
Gunmen stopped Heinrich Struebig, 48, and Petra Schnitzler, 26, and a third 
West German, who was not identified, between their office and the Miye ou Miye 
refugee camp, police said. Schnitzler was later released, but she declined to 
give details about the abduction. 
</P>
<P>
No one claimed responsibility for the latest seizure, but it came as a West 
German court prepared to pass judgment on Mohammed Ali Hamadi, a Lebanese 
Shiite Muslim accused of murdering an American passenger during the hijacking 
of a TWA airliner in 1985.

THEIR SCHOOLS CLOSED BY ISRAEL, WEST BANK YOUTHS ATTEND SECRET CLASSES

BEIT SAHUR, Israeli-Occupied West Bank 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The young Palestinians and their aging mentor exchanged illegal information 
behind the drawn curtains of a private living room. 
</P>
<P>
"The white dog is nice," a teen-ager named Tamer said. 
</P>
<P>
"The black dog is nicer than the white dog," a colleague named Rima said 
hesitantly. 
</P>
<P>
"The red dog is the nicest!" Hamed concluded, with an eager wave of the hand. 
</P>
<P>
The three are high school students trying to keep up their English lessons in a 
clandestine school run by Palestinians in this hilltop town near Bethlehem. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the past 17 months, Israel has kept all schools in the West Bank, 
public and private, closed on grounds that they would otherwise breed unrest 
associated with the Arab uprising. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hidden Classes 
</P>
<P>
In order to keep the 320,000 students from falling hopelessly behind in their 
studies, Palestinians are organizing hidden classes. 
</P>
<P>
These have also been declared illegal, even though teachers and parents 
generally keep the students quiet so as not to attract army patrols on the 
lookout for such activity. Such is the concern for secrecy that a reporter 
spent months asking before being admitted to one of the classes. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops recently raided college science classes in Ramallah that were 
being taught by professors from Birzeit University, which has been closed for 
more than a year. There was no indication from the government announcement of 
the raid that the students had done anything but carry on a normal course of 
study. 
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, which operates 98 schools in Palestinian refugee camps in 
the West Bank, complained recently that the Israeli government had prohibited 
its teachers from holding first- through third-grade classes in the homes of 
children as a temporary measure to keep them learning. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Issue of Security 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials do not base the banning of secret schools on the issue of 
security. Rather, they express concern that a separate system will arise 
outside their control, one in which Palestinian nationalism would be assumed if 
not taught outright. 
</P>
<P>
Reading, writing and revolution are not in the authorized curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not oppose a few parents teaching their children some lessons at home," 
Shmuel Morad, the military governor of Nablus, said. "There has to be 
supervision by the proper authorities. It cannot be directed by politically 
oriented people of the uprising." 
</P>
<P>
As to the possibility of reopening the schools, Morad said, "There is no way to 
open schools." 
</P>
<P>
Israel's insistence on keeping the Arab schools closed has drawn fire from 
international human rights groups and recently from a group of Israeli 
professors who see it as ironic that Jews, a people taught to venerate 
education, should deny education to others, even in the midst of a violent 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
"We are of the opinion that a step that may have been justified as a short-term 
emergency measure at the beginning of the uprising has become intolerable as a 
long-term measure," the professors wrote. "It is crucial that acts done in our 
name should be consistent with our declared values." 
</P>
<P>
Palestinian educators are planning to circulate a petition among foreign 
diplomats in Jerusalem requesting that their countries halt educational 
exchanges with Israelis so long as Israel keeps Arab schools closed. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has asked Israel privately to take "confidence-building 
measures" to try to ease tension in the West Bank and Gaza Strip but has 
stopped short of pressing for a reopening of the schools. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, some Palestinian parents take pains to get their children to 
"popular schools," with classes dispersed in homes, offices, mosques and 
churches. 
</P>
<P>
For fear of being found out, children carry their books not in the customary 
knapsack but in plastic grocery bags topped with bunches of mint or grape 
leaves for camouflage. Tamara, an 11th-grader in Beit Sahur, recalled the day 
soldiers forced her to return home when they found English books in her bag. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'These are not rocks,' " she related. "They said, 'It doesn't matter, 
they are illegal.' " 
</P>
<P>
Beit Sahur is a middle-class town with numerous teachers, and many of its 
residents are parents who want to see their children educated. 
</P>
<P>
In other, more remote places, where learning would be a struggle in the best of 
times, education has come to a virtual standstill. For example, in Kfar Malek, 
near Ramallah, 8- and 9-year-olds spend their days not trying to fathom 
arithmetic but standing guard on hilltops to watch for roving Israeli army 
patrols. 
</P>
<P>
With some embarrassment, street organizers in Kfar Malek admitted that little 
is being done there to further the children's education. They pointed out that 
teachers would have to come from Ramallah, and are reluctant to do so for fear 
of being found out. Teachers are in the pay of the Israeli government while the 
schools are closed. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't get anyone to come teach, and we ourselves are not really very well 
educated," said Mustafa, a village youth who has been in prison on four 
occasions for throwing stones. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Read Graffiti 
</P>
<P>
Idle children in the main plaza demonstrated a peculiar result of the lack of 
education: They could read the nationalist graffiti scrawled on the walls of 
houses and stores but were hard-pressed to recite from an elementary science 
book produced by a local storekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinian educators view such an imbalance in the learning of youngsters as 
one of many disasters visited upon the children. 
</P>
<P>
"A whole generation could come out illiterate," school counselor Rana 
Nashashibi warned. "We are witnessing an enormous drop in IQ scores. 
Nine-year-olds are really at 7-year-old levels." 
</P>
<P>
Nashashibi deals with children in the 7- to 11-year age group, a period 
regarded as important in terms of grasping concrete ideas and quantities and in 
the absorption of social norms. 
</P>
<P>
"It's possible that the children are learning a certain amount of independence 
and assertiveness that can prove valuable," she said, "but they are not 
learning limits, moral norms and values. There's a lot of aggressiveness. Who 
will teach that freedom stops when it annoys others? How will the children 
learn limits? Their behavior is becoming unpredictable." 
</P>
<P>
A mother in Beit Sahur described how her son, who is 10, was refusing to go to 
school until the Palestinians achieve their independence. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell him," she said, "that he'll be of no use to our country if he does not 
study. He answers that the work in the streets is more important. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine! He uses words like 'polarization' and 'collaborators.' What about 
beauty and nature? What kind of childhood is this?" 
</P>
<P>
Just then the son entered and listened to his mother's complaint. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother gets mad sometimes," he said. "When we have a state, we will make 
her defense minister. No one would dare attack us."

HARD-DRIVING TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY; 
</P>
<P>
SKINNER AIMS HIGH, KEEPS A LOW PROFILE

<TEXT>
<P>
Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner, one of the Bush Administration's 
most visible Cabinet members, knows what he wants: worldwide airport security, 
additional air traffic controllers and a national transportation policy. 
</P>
<P>
And he knows what he does not want: a reputation for overshadowing President 
Bush -- a reputation he knows could result from his role as Administration 
point man on a range of high-profile issues, including the Eastern Airlines 
strike, the oil spill in Alaska and international efforts to combat terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview, Skinner said he gets his "marching orders" from Bush and 
from White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu. He added: "When I need them to 
get involved, they get involved." 
</P>
<P>
He said that Bush is more of a "knowledge-on" President than a "hands-on" one. 
"(Bush) says what he wants to say. There's a time when the President should 
articulate a position and there's a time when the secretary should. I think 
he's drawn the proper balance." 
</P>
<P>
Skinner himself does a lot of articulating. One day on his schedule last week 
showed a 7:45 a.m. breakfast with a House subcommittee, congressional testimony 
on an Administration proposal to create a $500-million oil spill cleanup fund, 
three media interviews, a White House meeting, a speech, another meeting and a 
reception downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, he consistently hammers on the idea of a transportation policy 
that he calls a "strategic plan for transportation in this country in the 21st 
Century." Skinner has commissioned a task force that, by the end of the year, 
will answer questions such as where will airports be built, how will rail 
transportation fit in with air travel and how can highways and bridges be 
repaired. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to find more money to build America's infrastructure," he 
said during the interview. "I think the federal government is going to have to 
face it. And it's my job to make sure that I identify the problem, give the 
options and then let the Administration and Congress decide." 
</P>
<P>
Coming from a free-enterprise, private-sector Republican Administration, such 
words surprise some transportation experts. "That smacks of more government 
involvement," said Clifford Winston, senior fellow at the Brookings 
Institution. "It sounds quite contradictory (to Republican philosophy) to me." 
</P>
<P>
Skinner, former chairman of the board of the Regional Transportation Authority 
of Northeastern Illinois and Bush's campaign director for that state in the 
1988 presidential contest, said that he has "no political agenda. When (Bush) 
wants me to leave or I think it's time to leave, I'll go." 
</P>
<P>
His aides say that Skinner, who has crisscrossed the country since his Senate 
confirmation on Jan. 31, simply has seen the glaring transportation problems 
firsthand and has set out to determine how the 102,000 employees of his 
$26-billion-a-year agency can solve them. "He's a cut-to-the-chase kind of 
guy," said Al Maruggi, a department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary conceded there will be "tough budget wars," but declared: "We're 
going to make our case, and we're going to get the priorities established." 
</P>
<P>
Skinner, who recently returned from meetings on terrorism with his counterparts 
in five European countries, said he expects a complete program of 
anti-terrorism measures -- including bomb detectors and sharing of intelligence 
-- to be operating fully "in a couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
At one point in the interview, to demonstrate that more air traffic controllers 
are needed, he bounded from behind the desk in his spacious 10th-floor office 
at the Transportation Department and dashed over to a computer. On the screen, 
in any U.S. air space he displayed, were myriad little plane symbols. 
</P>
<P>
Indicating the crowded sky on the computer screen, Skinner said he wants to 
expand the current contingent of 16,500 controllers to 22,500 in the next 
several years, but he ruled out hiring back any of the 11,400 controllers 
President Ronald Reagan fired for striking in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
As did his Republican predecessors, Skinner favors eliminating the federal 
subsidy to Amtrak -- almost $600 million this fiscal year -- an idea the 
Democratic-controlled Congress has repeatedly rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Skinner said it is unlikely that portable radios or computers will be barred 
from airplanes, as was considered after the explosion of Pan Am Flight 103 over 
Scotland last December was traced to a bomb disguised as a radio-cassette 
player. He said that, since his consultations with the Europeans, "It looks 
like the consensus is developing in all the countries not to ban them, but to 
isolate them and inspect them."

SHUTTLE SKIPPER HAS CLOSE CALL WHILE FLYING JET

A NASA jet piloted by the commander of the space shuttle Atlantis reportedly 
came within 500 feet of a Pan Am wide-bodied jetliner about 30 miles west of 
Washington, officials said Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The NASA T-38 training jet piloted by David W. Walker came close to the Pan Am 
jet at about 6:35 p.m. Monday about five miles west of Washington Dulles 
International Airport in the northern Virginia suburbs, said John Leyden, a 
spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Navy Capt. Walker, who was commander of the shuttle that returned May 8 from a 
four-day mission, flew to Washington on Monday night in a T-38 to attend a 
White House ceremony honoring the shuttle astronauts, NASA spokesman David 
Garrett said. 
</P>
<P>
Leyden said the pilot of the T-38 was listed as "David Walker," but he did not 
know if it was the same David Walker. However, Garrett said there is no other 
NASA pilot by that name. 
</P>
<P>
The shuttle captain, reached at a Washington hotel, declined to confirm if the 
incident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"That's something that I need to probably talk with the FAA about, not with the 
news organizations," Walker said. "I'm going to have to get my information from 
them before I start talking to you all." 
</P>
<P>
NASA's Garrett said he had heard reports of a possible close call involving 
Walker but had been unable to reach the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the incident, Leyden of the FAA said: "The pilot (of the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration craft) was given an 8,000-foot assigned 
altitude. He was descending below his assigned altitude of 8,000 feet to 7,000 
feet, and that caused him to come close to a Pan American Airbus 310." 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon confirmed that the small plane crossed the 
path of Flight 140, which was en route to Paris from Dulles. 
</P>
<P>
"It had taken off from Dulles and was at 7,000 feet when it reported a T-38 
aircraft came within what the captain believed to be approximately 500 feet of 
the Airbus aircraft," Hanlon said. The Pan Am jet was carrying 166 passengers 
and a crew of 10, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The pilot did not take any evasive action," but immediately reported the 
incident to the Dulles Airport tower, Hanlon said.

Voters in the mile-high city decided in a referendum Tuesday whether to build 
the city's proposed new airport, a $2.3-billion project supporters claim will 
give Colorado an economic boost and opponents contend is not needed. 
</P>
<P>
The $1-million, months-long public relations campaign leading up to the 
referendum was the most expensive on an issue in the city's history. 
</P>
<P>
The airport, to be built 28 miles northeast of downtown Denver on 53 square 
miles of land annexed from Adams County, would be called Denver International. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters, who include all members of the state's congressional delegation, 
Gov. Roy Romer and Mayor Federico Pena, contend the airport will make Denver a 
major transportation hub and guarantee the state's economic viability for years 
to come. 
</P>
<P>
J. D. MacFarlane, a former Colorado attorney general and a leading opponent of 
the new airport, contends it is not needed and claims the city will recover 
from its slump without the project. 
</P>
<P>
In Seattle, meanwhile, voters were deciding whether to preserve their mountain 
view and put a height limit on one of the tallest downtown skylines in the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
About 25% of Seattle's 291,903 voters were expected to vote on their 
referendum, prompted by complaints about the "Manhattanization" of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called CAP referendum, for Citizens Alternative Plan, would limit new 
buildings to 450 feet, about 38 stories, and restrict density downtown for 10 
years while a long-range plan for urban Seattle is put in place. 
</P>
<P>
The city of 500,000, situated across Puget Sound from the Olympic Mountains, 
already has more than 10 buildings higher than 450 feet. 
</P>
<P>
In other voting Tuesday, Pittsburgh residents were to decide whether to 
nominate a 71-year-old "Jewish grandmother" for a full term as mayor in a 
five-way Democratic primary that will give the winner almost certain victory in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Sophie Masloff, 71, was City Council president last year when she was 
appointed to fill the vacancy left by the death of Mayor Richard S. Caliguiri.

A high-tech lobbying campaign backfired Tuesday as Gov. William A. O'Neill 
signed legislation to restrict the use of fax machines to send unsolicited 
messages. 
</P>
<P>
Fax owners used their machines last week to flood the governor's office with 
letters urging him to veto the bill, but O'Neill said the protest instead 
convinced him to sign the measure. 
</P>
<P>
The protest left O'Neill's office unable to use its machine to get information 
from the state Office of Emergency Management about rising river levels and 
possible flooding around the state. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been following discussion about the legislation but frankly last week 
was the first time the need for this kind of legislation was brought home to 
me," O'Neill said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The new law, which takes effect on Oct. 1, will allow anyone who receives an 
unsolicited advertisement on a fax machine to sue for up to $200 or actual 
damages, whichever is greater. It also allows a person who receives the 
unsolicited material to seek a court order banning future transmissions.

U.S. DELAYS VAST OIL LEASES OFF ALASKA IN WAKE OF SPILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
In a notable retreat from plans for oil exploration in Alaska, the Department 
of the Interior has decided to defer a proposed offshore lease sale there until 
scientists can assess the long-term damage caused by this spring's oil spill in 
Prince William Sound, Administration officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The postponement of drilling in the Gulf of Alaska and Cook Inlet, which were 
tainted by oil from the catastrophic spill, marks the Bush Administration's 
first significant decision on offshore drilling since the Exxon Valdez hit a 
reef nearly two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, approved late Tuesday by Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan Jr., 
imposes a one-year delay on the scheduled lease of a vast 138-million-acre 
package, postponing final action until August, 1991, to provide time for 
scientists to gather more information about the effects of the oil spill on the 
pristine marine environment. 
</P>
<P>
A senior aide to Lujan emphasized that the decision on the Cook Inlet site "in 
no way diminishes" the Administration's commitment to a separate plan for oil 
exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. That proposal has been the 
target of criticism from environmentalists since the Alaska spill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Much to Learn' 
</P>
<P>
But the aide, Steve Goldstein, said Lujan had decided that it "would not be 
prudent to go forward with the new lease sale immediately after a major 
accident. It is quite clear that we have much to learn from what happened. 
</P>
<P>
"This should not be read as a cancellation," Goldstein said. "This is a 
postponement to gather information while new facts are coming to light." 
</P>
<P>
The surprise deferral of the Cook Inlet sale, from which the government had 
expected to earn $10 million next year, sends a further signal of the 
Administration's willingness to reconsider some long-term drilling plans 
established by the Interior Department under former President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Among the proposed sales now being re-evaluated are vast areas off the coast of 
Southern California and Northern California, which are being reviewed by a 
presidential task force headed by Lujan. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very cautious Administration when it comes to offshore drilling," 
one Republican official said, "and this is just a further indication of that." 
</P>
<P>
However, Administration officials have given no indication that drilling in 
those regions would be canceled altogether. And they have expressed a 
determination to proceed with other oil exploration in the Alaskan wildlife 
refuge and in offshore tracts where drilling rights already have been leased to 
oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for oil exploration in one such already-leased area, Alaska's Bristol 
Bay, have been the principal target of drilling opponents since the Valdez 
spill. Administration officials said Tuesday that those plans would not be 
affected by the decision on Cook Inlet, because Bristol Bay was not affected by 
the spill. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of offshore drilling praised the Administration action as a welcome 
step. But many argued that the disastrous consequences of the spill already 
have made cancellation of the new drilling plans imperative. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the least they can do," said Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), warning 
that the Administration and the oil industry might seek to resume "business as 
usual once the political heat dies down." 
</P>
<P>
Another drilling critic, Natural Resources Defense Council attorney Lisa Speer, 
said that she could not understand why the Interior Department did not act to 
postpone other Alaska leases as well until the environmental damage of the 
spill can be determined. 
</P>
<P>
"We've already seen the terrible damage that can be wrought by oil in Alaskan 
environments," Speer said. 
</P>
<P>
While the Cook Inlet lease sale now has been postponed until at least a year 
from its scheduled date of August, 1990, the current Interior Department 
schedule calls for at least five other new lease sales to take place next year. 
</P>
<P>
They include two sales off Alaska, two in the Gulf of Mexico and one off North 
Carolina and other Mid-Atlantic states. In addition, the lease sales off 
Northern and Southern California could proceed if authorized by the 
presidential task force. 
</P>
<P>
The postponement of drilling in Alaska, scheduled to be announced by Lujan 
today in San Francisco, covers an area known as Lease Sale 114. The majority of 
the tract is in the Gulf of Alaska, where it ranges from three to 400 miles 
from shore. A smaller portion is in the Cook Inlet, three to 38 miles from 
shore.

HOWARD JACOBSON; NOTED HORSE TRAINER IMPRISONED FOR MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Howard (Buddy) Jacobson, once the most successful horse trainer in the United 
States but whose attraction for beautiful young women led to his being 
convicted of murder in a lurid New York City trial, died Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A state prison official said Jacobson was 58 and died at the Erie County (N.Y.) 
Medical Center where he had been under treatment for cancer since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
State Department of Correctional Services spokesman James Flateau said Jacobson 
had been serving a 25-year-to-life sentence at a maximum security state prison 
at Attica, 25 miles east of Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
He died still protesting his innocence in the killing of John Tupper, who was 
involved with Jacobson's former lover, model Melanie Cain. 
</P>
<P>
Tupper, 33, was shot six times, stabbed and beaten. His body was found in a 
dump in the Bronx. A witness placed Jacobson at the dump. 
</P>
<P>
Cain, who appeared on the covers of several national magazines including 
Cosmopolitan and Redbook, had lived with Jacobson for four years but the 
relationship ended 22 days before Tupper's death in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"Buddy doesn't care about the (bone) cancer," his sister Rita Costello said in 
connection with a lengthy prison interview with Jacobson published in The Times 
last year. "All he cares about is clearing himself." 
</P>
<P>
Jacobson repeatedly maintained that he did not kill Tupper. He claimed that 
Tupper was murdered not because of any jealousy factor but because he was a 
drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
He was convicted after a lengthy trial that featured nine straight days of 
Cain's testimony for the prosecution. The jury that convicted him had reported 
itself "hopelessly deadlocked" only three days before it reached a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1980, before he could be sentenced, he escaped from a Brooklyn jail by 
changing clothes with a friend and posing as a lawyer. Waiting for him was 
Audrey Barrett, a 22-year-old model. 
</P>
<P>
He was not free long. With the involvement of his then-estranged son, he was 
captured 40 days later in Manhattan Beach, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobson was born into a family of horse trainers and when he was only 11 began 
working for his uncle, Eugene Jacobs, at Jacobs' barn. He took out his first 
trainer's license at the age of 21 and became an overnight sensation both for 
his wins and his attitude. 
</P>
<P>
He decried the importance of jockeys in winning races and dealt with so many 
claiming-race horses that even their owners could not keep up with him. 
</P>
<P>
He became the top horse trainer in the United States in 1963 and was the 
leading trainer at New York state tracks five times. But in 1969 he led a 
strike for better working conditions and pension benefits that closed racing at 
Aqueduct race track for nine days. Later that year, Jacobson, charged with 
fraud by an owner, was suspended for 45 days, and for nearly five years after 
that could not get a stall for his horses at any New York track. 
</P>
<P>
By the time he was again admitted to the tracks he had found renewed interests, 
accumulating a fortune in a modeling agency and real estate ventures.

CONTEST PUTS FRIENDLY FOES ON THEIR GUARD

It was the municipal equivalent of a no-hitter in the bottom of the ninth, with 
Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young's team coming to the plate. On the field, a 
potential shutout within its grasp, was Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter's team. 
</P>
<P>
But Young's team connected for the long ball Tuesday, and suddenly the Anaheim 
club's victory was no longer assured. 
</P>
<P>
The analogy may be off base, because they won't be playing baseball in a new 
indoor arena proposed for Orange County. But the competition to build the 
county's first big-league sports dome intensified this week with news that a 
proposal from Santa Ana emerged to counter the carefully crafted package put 
together by Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's two biggest and oldest cities are longtime rivals. Now, the 
competition is for the status that goes with being hometown to a major indoor 
arena, which could host a professional basketball or hockey team -- if the pros 
can be lured to Orange County -- as well as dozens of other indoor sporting and 
entertainment events. 
</P>
<P>
It's a rivalry that's not always relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shove-It-to-Them Attitude 
</P>
<P>
"We see each other at functions and acknowledge each other as a political 
courtesy, but we have a shove-it-to-them attitude," Santa Ana Councilman John 
Acosta said of his city cousins to the north. 
</P>
<P>
The politicians aren't yet wearing numbers on their pinstripes, but a score 
card might help to follow the action. 
</P>
<P>
At mayor for Anaheim is Republican Fred Hunter, 5-10, 170 pounds. Hunter is a 
former policeman and preacher. He said that he is friendly with Santa Ana but 
that Anaheim is just bigger and better. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's kind of like we're the big gorilla on the block, and they're 
not," Hunter said. "I don't think there's even going to be a race (for a sports 
arena) because we're already 2 years ahead of them. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to brag a little bit," he added. "We are a dynamic city." 
</P>
<P>
Ha! Acosta says. "I think their dog-and-pony show is just about over. They 
better look out, because we're nipping at their heels right now." 
</P>
<P>
At mayor for Santa Ana is Republican Daniel H. Young, also 5-10, 170 pounds. 
Young, a former congressional aide and now a developer, says he just wants to 
see another pro sports team come to Orange County, and he would prefer that it 
would be to Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County deserves to have a sports arena and a pro (sports) team," Young 
said. "Sure, I think it would be a great boost for Santa Ana. . . . But if it 
comes to Anaheim, great, I'll still attend. . . . We're not going to get into a 
bidding war." 
</P>
<P>
Monday night, the Santa Ana City Council was briefed on a developer's plans to 
build a sports arena in a business park at Edinger Avenue and Lyon Street. 
Young, for one, said he just learned early Monday that the proposal was ready 
to be made made public, although it had been talked about generally for years. 
</P>
<P>
But it came as a complete surprise to most officials in the county and in 
Anaheim, where officials have been negotiating for such a complex for more than 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Anaheim offered the county $8 million to buy a site near Anaheim 
Stadium for the proposed arena. Supervisors are expected to vote on the offer, 
possibly as early as Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
They were still complaining Tuesday in Anaheim about the late hit. 
</P>
<P>
"Just when we were about to wrap everything up, they blind-sided us," Hunter 
complained. "They could have at least had the common courtesy to approach us." 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim City Councilman Thomas Daly said he wasn't upset by the surprise, but 
he acknowledged that a "friendly rivalry" exists between the two cities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's competition for our arena project, and it tells me that we have to work 
harder and smarter to make sure that our arena is built first. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the two biggest cities in the county," Daly said. "One is the sports and 
tourism center, the other is the county seat. There's a natural, healthy 
rivalry for the leadership role in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Former Huntington Beach Mayor Jack Kelly said the competition between the two 
cities is fun to watch. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of enjoy what appears to be a sibling rivalry," Kelly said. And 
although he isn't saying which city he'd rather see win, he said he hopes one 
succeeds in getting an arena. After all, Huntington Beach is in the midst of 
redeveloping its old downtown, and that could include construction of "a 
gorgeous hotel on the beach," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of visitors will be staying here to go to a ballgame there." 
</P>
<P>
Before the sports arena, the battle between the two cities was over jails. 
</P>
<P>
When county supervisors voted nearly 2 years ago to build a massive jail on 
Anaheim's doorstep in Gypsum Canyon, Anaheim officials supported an initiative 
that would, instead, require that all future jails be built in Santa Ana. That 
initiative is scheduled for the ballot in June, 1990.

BOGGS ALL TALKED OUT AFTER IRVINE SESSION WITH LAWYERS, ADAMS 
</P>

<P>
It had been a brutally long morning of talking -- about soured affairs, about 
jilted lovers, about disputed promises -- and Wade Boggs did not feel like 
taking his cuts at any more questions. 
</P>
<P>
While cameras flashed, the Boston Red Sox baseball star dashed toward an 
elevator in silence, leaving behind a pack of media people, a plush office 
suite filled with lawyers and a woman who says Boggs deceived her. 
</P>
<P>
"Go Red Sox," Boggs muttered flatly as he left the Irvine office building where 
he had answered questions at a deposition for 3 1/2 hours about his 
extramarital relationship with Margo Adams of Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
But talk of baseball seemed out of place on this day as Boggs and Adams began 
the local stretch of their extra-inning contest over a splintered affair, an 
affair that has splashed their names in headlines nationwide and has landed 
Boggs in court. 
</P>
<P>
In town for the first time this year to begin a series against the California 
Angels, Boggs, together with his lawyer, met with Adams and her lawyer behind 
closed doors to give a sworn statement in advance of a civil trial of Adams' 
claim, which is still many months away. 
</P>
<P>
Adams, a mortgage broker and former Miss Stanton who more recently has graced 
the pages of Penthouse, is charging that Boggs reneged on promises to 
compensate her financially for lost income and expenses she incurred while she 
traveled with him constantly on Red Sox road trips between 1984 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Emerging Tuesday from her first meeting with Boggs since he gave a deposition 
during spring training in Florida 3 months ago, Adams said: "It wasn't the same 
as seeing him in Tampa. The feeling just wasn't the same. . . . He never even 
looked at me." 
</P>
<P>
Adams, hinting at what her lawyer called a teamwide "permissiveness" toward 
personal relationships, added, "He got more into the personal lives of the 
other players . . . such as paternity lawsuits of other players that were kept 
quiet." She declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Case Continues to Improve' 
</P>
<P>
Her attorney, James McGee of Irvine, said the deposition revealed a pattern of 
inconsistent statements by Boggs that he said showed "a propensity . . . to 
protect his public image." 
</P>
<P>
Pointing, for example, to Boggs' assertion Tuesday that he never denied having 
an affair with Adams, the attorney said: "I think that every time I get Wade 
Boggs into a deposition, our case continues to improve." 
</P>
<P>
While Boggs refused to discuss the meeting, his attorney blasted the proceeding 
as "a waste of time." 
</P>
<P>
"It was just another boring day of depositions," said attorney Jennifer King of 
Tustin. With questioning of Boggs left unfinished Tuesday, a fourth meeting is 
scheduled for next month to continue the deposition. 
</P>
<P>
McGee said the extensive questioning is needed to flesh out the details of the 
4-year relationship between Boggs and Adams, but attorney King said the legal 
tactics are tantamount to harassment. 
</P>
<P>
She said she plans to seek a court order that would prevent McGee from 
requiring Boggs to appear at any future deposition sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"He's tired of the intrusion and he's tired of the harassment," King said. 
"They're trying to make this as expensive and distasteful as they can to Wade 
to pressure him into giving in to their demands." 
</P>
<P>
Adams indicated recently that she would drop the case for $125,000, but Boggs 
countered with a $20,000 offer that she termed unacceptable, and a settlement 
now seems out of the question, attorneys say. A trial in Superior Court in 
Santa Ana may still be 8 months to a year away, King said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rice, Evans Subpoenaed 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Red Sox stars Jim Rice and Dwight Evans were served with subpoenas 
in Anaheim Tuesday, McGee said, compelling them to give statements in Boston in 
June about their knowledge of the Boggs-Adams affair. 
</P>
<P>
McGee is still seeking to have subpoenas served on several other players who 
are familiar with the "wifelike duties" that Adams allegedly performed for 
Boggs during their relationship, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Also at Tuesday's deposition, McGee said he was surprised to hear Boggs 
acknowledge for the first time that he -- not his agent or team officials -- 
had initially contacted the FBI last year to charge that Adams was 
"blackmailing" him over their broken affair. 
</P>
<P>
That complaint led federal agents to question Adams about the alleged extortion 
attempt, an interrogation that Adams says humiliated and shocked her. 
</P>
<P>
McGee maintained that the acknowledgement may allow him to seek to broaden 
Adams' lawsuit to include slander and emotional distress charges against Boggs, 
even after the 4th District Court of Appeal in February threw out what amounted 
to the financial bulk of Adams' $12-million lawsuit.

PLANS FOR RIVAL ARENA IN SANTA ANA DISCLOSED; 
</P>
<P>
CITY ANNOUNCES PRIVATE VENTURE FOR PRO SPORTS SITE AS COUNTY NEARS VOTE ON 
ANAHEIM PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
With the Board of Supervisors poised to vote on a proposal that could clear the 
way for a sports arena in neighboring Anaheim, Santa Ana officials Tuesday 
announced the revival of plans to build a similar facility for their own city. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana's 20,000-seat arena would be built on 17 acres at Edinger Avenue and 
Lyon Street, near Century High School in an industrial and business park owned 
by the Santa Fe Pacific Realty Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana officials said they hope that the private effort to build such an 
arena would lure new or existing professional sports franchises to the city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'In Agreement' 
</P>
<P>
"We have discussed the project for some time, and we're in agreement on the 
concept," Santa Ana City Manager David N. Ream said Tuesday. "We think it would 
be of financial benefit. . . . But more importantly, we think it's a wonderful 
amenity for the residents of this community and the county at large." 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim city officials scoffed at the prospect of a sports arena in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"At this late juncture, I don't know what Santa Ana is up to," Anaheim Mayor 
Fred Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a couple of years into this and about ready to wrap things up," he said 
of his city's proposed arena deal. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana, Hunter said, missed its opportunity in 1985, when plans to build the 
Westdome sports arena were defeated by neighborhood foes. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't do anything," Hunter said about Santa Ana officials. "Now, they're 
talking about having this agreement to agree. They have a long process to go." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the plans to build an arena in Santa Ana are still conceptual, with no 
financing or ownership group yet lined up. Anaheim, by contrast, has all the 
elements in place to build the arena -- except for an arena site, property 
along the Santa Ana River that is owned by the county and has been identified 
as a potential jail site. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe Pacific project manager Bruce Ibbetson said his company wants either 
to lease or sell the Santa Ana parcel to a group that would build and manage a 
sports arena. 
</P>
<P>
"Neither the city of Santa Ana nor Santa Fe . . . want an equity role in the 
project," Ibbetson said. 
</P>
<P>
But exactly who would build and own such an arena is unclear. Spectacor 
Management Group, a Philadelphia-based company that manages stadiums and arenas 
throughout the country -- including the Sports Arena and Memorial Coliseum in 
Los Angeles -- has been contracted by Santa Fe Pacific to put together a 
management group, Ibbetson said. 
</P>
<P>
But Spectacor Vice President Don Webb gave no clues Tuesday about such a group: 
"We have a whole range of options. It could be a private partnership. It could 
be done a number of ways . . . (including) involving the city." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana City Manager Ream said his city has not been asked to participate by 
Spectacor or Santa Fe Pacific, either as a partner or by subsidizing road and 
other improvements that may be needed. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a private venture," Ream said of the arena plan. "They (Santa Fe 
Pacific) already own the property. They don't need to buy a jail site or any 
other site with a public subsidy to be able to move forward." 
</P>
<P>
That comment was an apparent swipe at Anaheim, which has offered the county $8 
million for the potential jail site at Katella Avenue and Douglass Road, where 
city officials want to build a 21,000-seat sports arena. 
</P>
<P>
The county is scheduled to vote on that offer possibly as early as Tuesday. Two 
of five county supervisors -- Don R. Roth and Thomas F. Riley -- have said they 
would support the Anaheim plan if the County Administrative Office recommends 
the purchase. The other three supervisors have been noncommittal. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe Pacific's and Santa Ana's timing offers supervisors a way to vote 
against the proposed land sale without killing the idea of a sports arena in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
But Ibbetson denied that the announcement was timed to derail Anaheim's 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a statement that a very viable alternative exists to the one site," 
Ibbetson said. "They've been public every step of the way. We've been quietly 
pursuing this, longer than Anaheim. We felt that if there was a chance, it 
would have to be known publicly that there is an alternative." 
</P>
<P>
Ibbetson said he has been talking quietly with Sanat Ana about the project for 
about 2 years, during which time his company has done an about-face. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, we didn't want it for the obvious negative reasons," said Ibbetson, 
citing traffic and increased security needs. "But our analysis over the last 
couple of years has led us to a decision that it's a very viable project." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Santa Fe Pacific site was the second choice on a list of 20 
possible arena sites created by a Santa Ana residents committee in 1985, when 
the city was embroiled in a battle over where to build Westdome. Proposals to 
build the arena downtown and at MacArthur Boulevard and Main Street failed 
because of stiff opposition from residents. 
</P>
<P>
Westdome partners talked with Santa Fe Pacific about building the arena in the 
industrial park but were unable to strike a deal, so arena proponents 
eventually turned their attention to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Mayor Hunter said that is where the attention should stay. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if a prospective NBA (National Basketball Assn.) team comes to this 
area, it doesn't take a Solomon to figure it out," he said. "They'd rather come 
to Anaheim, not Santa Ana. We're centrally located, the sports capital of 
Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Councilman John Acosta conceded that the California Angels, the Los 
Angeles Rams and Disneyland all give Anaheim a more identifiable profile than 
Santa Ana's. 
</P>
<P>
But it's time for that to change for Santa Ana, he said. "We are the county 
seat, and we need something that will make that statement." 
</P>
<P>
Neil Papiano, a Los Angeles lawyer who heads the partnership that would build 
the Anaheim arena, has said his group has had serious discussions with 
professional basketball and ice hockey franchises. 
</P>
<P>
Spectacor's Webb refused to comment when asked whether his company had talked 
with any sports franchises about coming to Santa Ana. One of the company's 
clients is the Los Angeles Clippers NBA team, which plays in the 
Spectacor-managed Sports Arena in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But Clippers president Donald K. Sterling, who said earlier this year that he 
had been offered $30 million to move his team to Anaheim, said emphatically 
Tuesday that the Clippers would not play in Orange County anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
"The Los Angeles Clippers are going to play in Los Angeles," Sterling said. 
"I've had no discussions with them (Sports Arena managers Spectacor) on coming 
down there." 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim officials said their arena could survive without a pro sports franchise 
as an anchor tenant, but it would probably not make money. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe Pacific spokesman Ibbetson said his company considers a sports 
franchise a necessity. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that this center needs to have an anchor tenant, and NBA 
team, or hockey or whatever," Ibbetson said, adding that Spectacor is "dealing 
with those issues." 
</P>
<P>
And while some sources involved with plans for one arena or the other 
speculated that there might be room for two such arenas in the county, Ibbetson 
left little doubt that he believes that is probably not the case. 
</P>
<P>
"Any logical person knows that there will only be one dome in the county," 
Ibbetson said. "No one wants to play second fiddle. . . . If (Anaheim backers) 
can do it better and quicker, then we'll back off. . . . But there's an awful 
long road ahead of them, as well."

SUPERVISORS OPPOSE HEALTH SERVICES CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In adopting a series of resolutions Tuesday, the Board of Supervisors formally 
opposed Gov. George Deukmejian's proposal to cut more than $485 million from 
health and welfare services in the state's 1989-90 budget. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors unanimously approved the resolutions calling for the restoration of 
funding that affects health-care programs for thousands of poor, disabled and 
elderly Orange County residents. 
</P>
<P>
Hardest hit by the governor's blueprint are county programs serving low-income 
families and the medically indigent. 
</P>
<P>
In recommending passage of the resolutions, Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder said 
the county must "stand firm and fight for these programs or many county 
residents will suffer."

POLICE IDENTIFY CLERK SLAIN IN MARKET HOLDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police identified a young store clerk who was killed in a convenience market 
robbery Monday as Jose Luis Banda of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said investigators were uncertain if Banda lived 
with anyone in Santa Ana. Most of Banda's relatives resided in Mexico, Thomas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old was killed Monday afternoon when he peeked out of a stockroom 
during a robbery and was shot in the head at the Lucky Center Market. A gunman 
had entered the grocery store at 3502 W. 5th St. and demanded money from the 
store owner, police said. 
</P>
<P>
As the owner complied, Banda stuck his head out of the stockroom, about 30 to 
40 feet away. The gunman fired one shot, hitting Banda in the head and killing 
him instantly, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Yong Kim, another employee at the store, said Banda had been working the 
evening shift there for 3 months. "I didn't know him well, but he seemed like a 
happy person," Kim said.

KRAFT TRIAL PENALTY PHASE TO BEGIN JUNE 5, WILL COVER 8 MORE KILLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The jurors who found Randy Steven Kraft guilty of murdering 16 young men in 
Orange County were ordered Tuesday to return June 5 for a death penalty 
hearing, where the prosecution will present evidence of eight more murders. 
</P>
<P>
However, on May 24 Kraft's lawyers will raise a series of issues with Superior 
Court Judge Donald A. McCartin out of the jury's presence. Chief among them 
will be a renewed attempt to prevent the prosecution from showing jurors any 
more entries from a list found in Kraft's car. Prosecutors claim it is a "death 
list" that Kraft wrote to keep track of how many people he had killed. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, 44, of Long Beach, was convicted Friday of the 16 murders. Most of the 
victims, between the ages of 18 and 25, were mutilated or sexually abused, and 
dumped along or near freeways. Prosecutors claim they have linked Kraft to 45 
murders altogether in what could be the worst serial murder case in the 
nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
After Kraft's conviction for all 16 murders, Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan Brown 
decided to narrow the number he would introduce at the penalty phase of the 
trial to eight. Six of those occurred in Oregon and two in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
The defense lawyers complained in the Santa Ana courtroom Tuesday that Brown 
owes them a better explanation of what evidence he will present next month. 
Brown responded that his case should be obvious to them, and that the list 
would be the primary evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Oregon entries on the Kraft list are all written in a row: "Portland ECK," 
"Portland Denver," "Portland Blood," "Portland Hawaii," "Portland Reserve" and 
"Portland Head." The entry that Brown claims represents two Michigan victims is 
"GR 2," written immediately below the Oregon entries. The two young men were 
last seen alive attending a horticulture convention at the same hotel where 
Kraft was staying in Grand Rapids, Mich., in December, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
One of the young men found dead in Oregon was from the Denver, Colo., area, and 
another was from Hawaii. A third was in the National Guard reserves. Brown 
claims that a fourth victim had lost an enormous amount of blood, to explain 
the "Portland Blood" entry. While the other two entries have not been 
explained, Brown claims that they must represent the other two victims because 
the six entries match the number of unsolved murders in that state attributed 
to the same serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
Another issue the defense intends to bring up is the media attention given the 
trial after last Friday's guilty verdicts. Kraft lawyer William J. Kopeny said 
he was "shocked" at all the publicity, and added: "There is a grave danger that 
this jury has been prejudiced by the publicity." 
</P>
<P>
The judge did note that one juror sent a message to the court stating she had 
inadvertently seen a headline on the Kraft case in a newspaper Tuesday morning, 
but did not read the article. The judge admonished the jurors again not to read 
or listen to anything about the case until after the trial is over. 
</P>
<P>
The judge asked the defense lawyers for an estimate of how much time they 
expect to take putting on their case in the penalty phase. But they told him it 
would be next week before they could say with any certainty. Prosecutor Brown 
told the court he expects to take about 2 weeks to put on the evidence of the 
Oregon and Michigan murders. 
</P>
<P>
The judge met with the defense lawyers in chambers -- much to Brown's surprise 
-- to discuss any scheduling problems they might have during the trial. When 
they came out, the judge said he might permit a 2-week interruption during the 
penalty phase to accommodate the Kraft lawyers in scheduling witnesses.

SUSPECT IN SLAYING OF WIFE RETURNED TO COUNTY

On a daylong airplane flight from the Montana wilderness where he was captured, 
David Lee Schoenecker returned to Orange County late Tuesday to answer charges 
that he fatally shot his wife and plotted against more than 50 other people. 
</P>
<P>
The 48-year-old Anaheim Hills chemical engineer, who waived extradition Tuesday 
morning before a judge in Missoula, Mont., was booked in Orange County Jail 
under $500,000 bail on charges that he murdered his wife, Gail Schoenecker, 40, 
at the couple's home on May 5. 
</P>
<P>
Schoenecker, who also threatened in a letter to "punish" 54 acquaintances and 
relatives, authorities say, was captured last week by an Old West-style posse 
while trekking through deep snow in mountains along the Montana-Idaho border. 
Schoenecker initially refused to waive extradition but after consulting with an 
attorney Monday agreed to return to California voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
Schoenecker, wearing an orange jumpsuit, signed extradition papers Tuesday 
morning during a brief appearance before Montana State District Judge John 
Henson. He was subsequently placed in the custody of two Anaheim police 
detectives, who took him aboard an early afternoon flight from Missoula -- 
where Schoenecker had been detained since the weekend -- to Orange County's 
John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
For the flight, Anaheim detectives Dave Tuttle and Joe Reiss allowed the 
fugitive to wear civilian clothes, although they kept his hands cuffed in front 
of him as they led him through passenger terminals in airports in Missoula and 
Salt Lake City, where they had to change planes. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, Schoenecker -- wearing a blue-plaid shirt, gray dress slacks 
and loafers -- appeared calm and unemotional. 
</P>
<P>
On the flight between Salt Lake City and Orange County, the suspect immersed 
himself in a newspaper, leafing through page after page. Detective Reiss, who 
sat next to Schoenecker on the last leg of the flight, uncuffed the suspect's 
hands so he could eat a snack. Schoenecker said little during the flight, 
exchanging some small talk with the detectives. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow passengers were apparently unaware that a fugitive was in their midst, 
as the detectives arranged to take Schoenecker aboard before others took their 
seats. And the detectives took great care to seat him away from other people 
while awaiting flight departures in the airports. Reiss and Tuttle had asked a 
Times' reporter and photographer aboard the flight not to approach them on the 
jet. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an extradition, and we don't want to upset the other passengers," 
Tuttle had said in Missoula. 
</P>
<P>
The anonymity faded, however, as soon as the Skywest jet touched down at John 
Wayne Airport about 7:15 p.m. Awaiting Schoenecker's arrival were a throng of 
news reporters and photographers. He repeatedly ducked and turned his head to 
avoid having his picture taken. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives Reiss and Tuttle, joined by a third Anaheim police officer waiting 
at the airport, hustled Schoenecker off to a waiting car and drove him to 
Orange County Jail, where he now awaits an as-yet unscheduled arraignment.

DESPERATE FLIGHT FAILS, 2 CAUGHT IN UTAH;

<P>
SUSPECTS BELIEVED TO HAVE STOLEN TRUCK, 2 CYCLES IN ORANGE COUNTY

Two teen-agers suspected of stealing a pickup truck and a couple of motorcycles 
in Orange County led police on a wild chase in Utah early Tuesday, repeatedly 
driving the wrong way on an interstate highway, hurtling medians and crashing 
through fences before they were captured. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, the two motorcycles bounced out of the rear of the truck. The 
truck was abandoned as police closed in, but the two suspects were discovered, 
with the help of a police dog, hiding among houses in a tiny subdivision south 
of Cedar City. 
</P>
<P>
The chase began about 3:35 a.m. when Sgt. Kurt Wright saw the pickup truck 
speeding on State Street in the middle of Hurricane, a small southwestern Utah 
city near Zion National Park. 
</P>
<P>
Wright gave this rendition of the chase and capture: 
</P>
<P>
Wright attempted to stop the 1986 Nissan 4x4 pickup, unaware that it was 
stolen, but the vehicle speeded up and headed north out of town, onto 
Interstate 15, about 10 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
As he chased the truck, northbound on the freeway, Wright notified the Utah 
highway patrol in Cedar City, about 40 miles north, and authorities there began 
setting up roadblocks including spikes. He also learned, as he entered the 
interstate, that the truck was stolen. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, one of Hurricane's four-man Police Department and the only officer on 
duty at the time, was the sole lawman in pursuit until the suspects reached the 
exit for Hamilton Fort, a tiny town about 5 miles south of Cedar City. There, 
the suspects saw another officer waiting to join the pursuit, but in an effort 
to dodge the officer, they crossed over the highway median and continued 
speeding north in the freeway's southbound lanes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Through Another Fence 
</P>
<P>
They soon left the highway, crashing through a fence parallel to the 
interstate, and doubled back, speeding south on a frontage road in an attempt 
to elude authorities. The truck again burst through the fence, sped across the 
southbound lanes, over the median and into the northbound lanes, still 
proceeding south. 
</P>
<P>
The driver tried to exit at Hamilton Fort, but when the truck "hit a bump or 
something," the two motorcycles flew out and onto the highway. The truck then 
turned around and headed north once again on the highway. Again it went over 
the median, veered across the southbound lanes and crashed through the fence, 
into the Hamilton Fort subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, the two suspects abandoned the truck and fled into the 
subdivision, made up of about 20 houses, Wright said. Cedar City police were 
called in with their canine unit and spotlights, and they surrounded the 
subdivision. The police dog sniffed out the first suspect, a 17-year-old 
juvenile from Los Angeles, about 2 hours after the chase began, Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
The second suspect, 18-year-old George William Carter II of Laguna Hills, 
surrendered immediately afterward, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Carter was arraigned Tuesday in 5th Circuit Court in St. George on three counts 
each of of second-degree vehicle theft and possession of stolen property, and 
one count each of felony failure to stop at the command of a police officer, 
reckless driving and destruction of public property, valued at $1,200. Carter 
was held in lieu of $20,000 bail and his preliminary hearing was set for May 
24. 
</P>
<P>
The juvenile, who was not identified, was arraigned on three counts each of 
vehicle theft and possession of stolen property. He was transported to the 
Cedar City detention center when authorities were unable to find relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Wright said the pickup was reported stolen from El Toro on Sunday. The 
motorcycles were a 1987 Yamaha reported stolen Monday in Laguna Hills and a 
1989 Kawasaki, taken Saturday from the same area, he said.

How does one accurately select a 20-year anniversary high school all-star 
baseball team in an area that annually produces talent worthy of stocking 
professional and college teams? 
</P>
<P>
Selecting an all-Orange County baseball team in one year is difficult; naming 
the best players over the past 20 years is nearly impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Coaches get mad, parents are upset, angry readers write and some players' egos 
are bruised whenever such teams are published. Now, imagine the talk in a major 
league clubhouse when word reaches that Padre shortstop Garry Templeton, New 
York Met catcher Gary Carter, Angel designated hitter Brian Downing and Angel 
pitcher Dan Petry were left off the team. 
</P>
<P>
Here's the major ground rule: The players were chosen based upon their 
accomplishments only while attending high school. No points for major league 
success. 
</P>
<P>
Pitchers? Easily the most competitive position on the team. A team can ride the 
arm of a quality pitcher to a Southern Section championship . 
</P>
<P>
The best player? It's difficult to imagine an infielder better than Glenn 
Hoffman of Savanna. Len Dykstra of Garden Grove ranks as the county's best 
outfielder. Mike Witt of Servite was overpowering on the mound, and few have 
thrown a better curveball than Santiago's Bert Blyleven. 
</P>
<P>
So, for argument's sake, here's The Times' 20th anniversary all-county baseball 
team. Please, keep the letters as brief as possible. 
</P>
<P>
PITCHERS 
</P>
<P>
Imagine a rotation that includes two members of the Angels' pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
Witt didn't lose a game from 1977-78 at Servite, compiling a 21-0 record. At 
6-foot-8, he was a towering figure on the mound who overpowered hitters. As a 
senior at Servite, Witt allowed only three hits in the 4-A division final, 
ending Arcadia's 15-game winning streak with a 6-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven was 17-6 from 1968-69 at Santiago, where he mastered a curveball that 
became his ticket to the major leagues. Only a year out of high school at 19, 
Blyleven won 10 games with the Minnesota Twins, who won the American League 
West championship. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Dodd of Capistrano Valley was the county's player of the year in 1983 and 
1984. He struck out 238 and compiled a 22-1 record in two seasons. Dodd also 
was a good hitter and led the county with nine home runs as a senior. Since 
then, he has hit several detours on the road to success. He dropped out after 
his freshman year at Arizona State and is currently with double-A Chattanooga 
in the Cincinnati Reds organization. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Peterson won 30 games to lead Sonora to the 2-A division title games in 
1972 and 1973 and finished high school with 40 victories. Sonora won the title 
in 1972 with Peterson compiling a 15-1 record with 189 strikeouts. He pitched 
five shutouts and a no-hitter as a junior. Peterson was 15-4 with 174 
strikeouts as a senior, winning 30 of Sonora's 37 games in two years. 
</P>
<P>
CATCHER 
</P>
<P>
Few high school players have received more attention than Andy Bielanski did in 
1968 and 1969 at Savanna. As a junior, Bielanski was a master on the mound, 
where he had a 13-1 record and was named the Southern Section's 3-A co-player 
of the year with Tim Foli. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior, he moved to his natural position, catcher, and batted .356 despite 
missing the opening of the season with a broken wrist suffered during the 
football season. Bielanski was drafted by the New York Mets, but rejected a 
bonus offer and attended UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
INFIELDERS 
</P>
<P>
Even after 20 years, Alan Bannister still holds nearly every offensive record 
at Kennedy, where he was named the county's player of the year in 1969. 
Bannister batted .523 in his senior season and was the fifth selection in the 
major league draft. He played 12 years in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman was a three-year starter for Savanna who hit .437 as a senior in 1976 
and committed only two errors at shortstop. A slick fielder, Hoffman was 
drafted by the Boston Red Sox and headed for Elmira, N.Y., two days after 
graduation to play rookie ball. He reached the major leagues in 1981 and 
fulfilled a childhood dream of playing in Anaheim Stadium, where his father 
worked as an usher. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Redington hit 21 home runs in three seasons at Esperanza but his homer into 
the left-field bleachers at Dodger Stadium as a junior in 1986 in the 4-A 
division title game against Fontana was the highlight of his career. Redington 
is playing for the Atlanta Braves' Class-A minor league team in Burlington, 
Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
FIRST BASEMAN 
</P>
<P>
Mike Carpenter was a left-hander who excelled at Los Alamitos in 1974 and '75. 
He hit .408 as a junior and .463 his senior season. Carpenter played at 
Cerritos College, UCLA and then signed with the St. Louis Cardinals, but he 
tore cartilage in his knee in the minor leagues that ended his career. 
</P>
<P>
OUTFIELDERS 
</P>
<P>
Billy Bean led Santa Ana to its only Southern Section championship in Coach 
Bill Ross' 31-year career by batting .438 and winning six games as a pitcher. 
Santa Ana finished third in the Century League but defeated top-seeded 
Cerritos, 6-5, in the semifinals and then edged Fullerton, 3-2, in the title 
game. Bean is playing for the Tigers' triple-A team in Toledo, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
John Christensen of Troy was a two-time All-Southern Section selection who 
batted .395 as a junior and .453 as a senior in 1978. He earned a scholarship 
to Cal State Fullerton, where he helped lead the Titans to the NCAA College 
World Series title in 1979. He currently plays for the Twins' triple-A team in 
Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
Dykstra was probably the best competitor to play in the county. Among his 
county marks are 50 hits in his senior season in 1981 and 89 career stolen 
bases. He was caught stealing only once in four years. He signed to play with 
Arizona State, but decided to sign with the Mets, for whom he starts in center 
field. 
</P>
<P>
UTILITY 
</P>
<P>
Steve Buechele once turned down a $100,000 offer to sign with the Chicago White 
Sox. Instead, he chose to play at Stanford after an impressive career at 
Servite. Buechele batted .324 and won five games as a junior on Servite's 4-A 
championship team. 
</P>
<P>
He batted .410 as a senior in 1979. Buechele's towering homer as a junior in 
the playoffs at Glover Stadium is one of the longest hit in the facility by a 
high school player. He is the starting third baseman for the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
DESIGNATED HITTER 
</P>
<P>
Brian Greer holds Southern Section career records for triples (27) and doubles 
(30) set as a four-year starting first baseman at Sonora. At 6-feet-3 and 220 
pounds, Greer combined speed with power to hit .461 in his senior season in 
1977. He was drafted and signed with the San Diego Padres, where an 
unsuccessful career ended in 1979 without a hit in four major league at-bats.

LA HABRA DEFEATS IRVINE IN 4-A WILD-CARD GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL PRESTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robbie Szente and Tim Moore each had two hits and two runs batted in as La 
Habra High School scored a 9-6 victory over Irvine in a Southern Section 4-A 
wild-card game Tuesday at Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra (14-8) led, 8-3, after four innings, but Irvine (13-13) took advantage 
of two walks and a hit batter in the fifth to score its first two runs of the 
inning on Scott Brandino's sacrifice fly and Steve Nessl's run-scoring 
grounder. 
</P>
<P>
After La Habra starter Tom Juarez (4-3) walked Mike Booker and Bowen Ota to 
load the bases, Moore, who began the game at shortstop, came in to pitch and 
walked Randy Martin to cut the lead to 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, however, got Jeff Pincus to hit into a force play for the third out. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra got an insurance run in the seventh on Dave Karaba's RBI double. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Morris, who started the game at second base, shut out Irvine the last two 
innings despite yielding three seventh-inning walks. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what happens in a typical CIF elimination game," said La Habra Coach 
Paul Thomas, whose team will travel to San Gabriel for a first-round game 
Friday. "They have a lot of heart. We thought we had them down when we got the 
big lead, but they never gave up." 
</P>
<P>
Terry Rahmatulla, who doubled to lead off the Irvine first, scored the game's 
first run two outs later on Brandino's ground-ball single. Brandino, who went 
to second when Nessl legged out a deep grounder to Moore, then scored the 
Vaqueros' second run on Booker's single. 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders, who were the recipients of five walks and a hit batsman by 
Vaquero starter Dave Goldstein (6-5), took advantage of three of the walks in 
the second to take a 3-2 lead on Goldstein's bases-loaded balk and Szente's 
two-run triple. 
</P>
<P>
John Bretza, who replaced Goldstein after Szente's triple, could fare no 
better. With one out in the third, Moore doubled to center. After Bretza struck 
out Jamie Hutcherson for the second out, Moore scored on Nick Sciacca's single. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra scored four more runs in the fourth on Moore's two-run pop-fly double 
that fell between three fielders and RBI singles by Hutcherson and Morris. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros cut La Habra's lead to 8-3 in the fourth when Booker, who singled 
and advanced to second on Juarez's balk, scored when Bowen Ota's grounder went 
through Morris' legs for an error. 
</P>
<P>
In a 5-A wild-card game: 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos 16, Bishop Montgomery 0 -- Three Los Alamitos pitchers scattered 
three hits in a lopsided victory at Torrance Park. Starter Todd Gragnano gave 
up two hits in four-plus innings and got the victory. Sal Mancuso knocked in 
four runs with a single and a double and he scored twice. Anthony Napolitano 
had two RBIs on three hits and scored four runs. Los Alamitos (14-13) will play 
Friday at Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
In the small schools wild-card game: 
</P>
<P>
Claremont 8, St. Margaret's 5 -- Bob Tipton had two doubles and five RBIs to 
lead visiting Claremont (9-8). Tipton broke a 3-3 tie with a three-run double 
in the sixth. Rich Barona (2-7) pitched the first five innings for the victory. 
Jeff Hilgers had three hits, including two doubles and three RBIs for St. 
Margaret's (7-12).

Five games and 2 1/2 hours of schizophrenic volleyball ended, fittingly enough, 
with a spike hit out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
The boys' volleyball teams of Newport Harbor and Woodbridge high schools played 
a streaky, sometimes-sloppy Southern Section 4-A quarterfinal playoff match 
that Newport Harbor eventually won, 15-13, 12-15, 9-15, 15-8, 15-12, Tuesday 
night at Woodbridge. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor (12-5), which entered the playoffs as the No. 3 team out of the 
Sea View League, plays No. 1 seeded Mira Costa Thursday in one of the 4-A 
semifinal games. 
</P>
<P>
The fifth and decisive game was a microcosm of the match. Woodbridge broke out 
to an early 2-0 lead and Newport Harbor tied the score at 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge, with a kill, then a block by Mike Manthei, went up, 4-2. Newport 
Harbor rallied for four consecutive points, two coming on Woodbridge errors. 
</P>
<P>
With Newport Harbor leading, 8-5, Woodbridge rallied for three points, two 
coming on Tom Shankin kills, to tie the score at 8-8. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor was off again, this time on a 6-2 run, sparked by Chris Lee's 
two kills and one block. Newport Harbor was at game- and match-point, 14-10, 
when Woodbridge started yet another rally. Kills by Shankin -- he had 17 -- 
then Manthei -- he had 19 -- made the score, 14-12. But Newport Harbor setter 
Alex Opoulos got his team a crucial sideout when he dumped a ball over for a 
kill. 
</P>
<P>
With Billy Nguyen (15 kills) serving, Woodbridge's set went to Scott Seymour, 
who had been one of its best hitters on the night with 17 kills. Seymour swung, 
but the ball sailed just long and Newport Harbor had the match. 
</P>
<P>
"We've played like this all year long," said Dan Glenn, Newport Harbor coach. 
"We give up points in streaks, and then we get some points in streaks." 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge had a 12-6 lead in the first game, only to watch Newport Harbor cut 
the lead to 12-11. A Manthei block -- he had four -- gave Woodbridge a 13-11 
lead. But two Woodbridge errors and a Will Allison block put Newport Harbor 
ahead, 14-13. Newport Harbor won the game on a Nguyen kill. 
</P>
<P>
From that, Woodbridge managed to come back and win the next two games. In the 
second, Woodbridge trailed, 4-0, but ran off 10 consecutive points. Newport 
Harbor actually tied the game at 12-12, but Woodbridge scored three more 
points, the final point on a Seymour service ace, to win. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor, which had led 7-3, only to be tied, scored the last six points 
in game four to force the decisive game. 
</P>
<P>
The streaky nature of the match had a lot to do with each team's style and 
makeup, both practically the same. Woodbridge has eight underclassmen on its 
team, Newport Harbor seven. Each team makes up for the lack of one great hitter 
by distributing the ball around. Newport Harbor had six players with six or 
more kills, Woodbridge had five. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, Woodbridge Coach Steve Stratos described playing Newport Harbor as "a 
mirror." 
</P>
<P>
Glenn couldn't agree more. 
</P>
<P>
"They play just like we do," he said. "They were making some unbelievable digs, 
the kinds of digs we usually make for points." 
</P>
<P>
In another 4-A quarterfinal match: 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach 3, Santa Monica 2 -- Second-seeded Laguna Beach hung on to win, 
15-5, 16-14, 15-17, 14-16, 15-12, at home. Laguna Beach (19-1) plays 
third-seeded Corona del Mar in a semifinal match Thursday at a site to be 
determined today. Corona del Mar swept Edison, 15-8, 15-9, 15-7, also Tuesday.

FOGG WINS PERFECTLY FOR HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Senior right-hander Pam Fogg pitched a perfect game and also had the 
game-winning hit as Huntington Beach High School defeated Cypress, 1-0, in a 
Southern Section 5-A wild-card softball game Tuesday at Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first perfect game of Fogg's high school career and her first 
no-hitter this season. Fogg (11-7) struck out six. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach scored in the fifth inning. Dana Ferdinand singled and April 
Crosby reached on a fielder's choice, with Ferdinand beating the throw to 
second. Gina Corbin sacrificed both runners, and Fogg singled to right-center 
for the winning hit. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach (14-12) advances to play second-seeded Gahr on Friday in the 
first round. Cypress ends the season 10-16.

TRANSCON FOCUSES ON SILVER LINING IN REPORT ON ITS LARGEST LOSS EVER

Transcon Inc., a large Orange-based trucking firm, lost $23.7 million last 
year. But you have to turn to Page 17 of the company's annual report to find 
that figure. 
</P>
<P>
In an upbeat message to shareholders and employees, Chairman Orin S. Neiman 
starts by stating that Transcon closed the year with "a small, but meaningful 
profit" of $142,000 for the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
He goes on to mention that $23.9 million was lost in the previous three 
quarters, but the net loss for the full 12 months is not reported for another 
15 pages. In between are six, full-page color photographs of Transcon customers 
giving testimonials and details of operating improvements made by the company 
over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
The tone of the 1988 report is much different from a year earlier. When the 
company lost $19.9 million in 1987, the loss was listed on Page 1 of that 
year's report, and Neiman's message was blunt. It started: "Transcon suffered 
badly in 1987 . . . our biggest loss ever."

SAWYER BROWN GIVES IN TO WORST IMPULSES AT CRAZY HORSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY GLEASON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are a lot of words you could associate with Sawyer Brown, but subtlety is 
not one of them. And it's the "Star Search"-winning band's tendency towards 
excess that ultimately did the group in at the Crazy Horse in Santa Ana on 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
From the moment the six-man aggregation hit the stage, its members served up 
heavy-handed arrangements that pummeled many of their hits into shapelessness. 
Certainly "Everybody Loves to Hear A Country Boy Sing," their set opener, 
suffered from the heavy back-beat and accelerated tempo. 
</P>
<P>
Other hits, like the rollicking "Leona," the power-shuffle "My Baby's Gone" as 
well as a lifeless reworking of the Eagles' hit "Take It Easy," ended up 
sounding very similar because there's so little to differentiate the approach. 
Sawyer Brown wants to rock -- and that's where the trouble starts. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the problem wasn't limited to the upbeat material. "Used to 
Blue," one of the Orlando-based band's early hits, was transformed from an 
achingly pretty ballad to a maudlin production number, complete with a brassy 
synthesizer part. If this is how they approach sensitive material, it's no 
wonder their focus comes across as blurred. 
</P>
<P>
Lead singer Mark Miller has always been one to pump a lot of energy into his 
stage moves. But there's something to be said for reaching beyond the standard 
Rock 101 moves that he used to tantalize the crowd. Mick Jagger he's not -- and 
at most moments, Miller's rocking posture had all the charm of a Raggedy Andy 
doll fresh from electroshock therapy. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, most of Miller's shtick was grossly self-serving. After stopping 
"Missing You Heart of Mine" after a few bars, Miller addressed the audience 
with a barely cloaked admonishment of "I don't know if you know this, but this 
was one of the biggest country songs last year . . . " and was rewarded by a 
larger round of applause during the song's second start. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Miller may well be one of country music's cutest faces. But a little of 
that goes a long way. And it's particularly frustrating to see a band that 
knows how to work a crowd, that has a lead singer who has a legitimately 
emotive baritone and that has a substantial following consistently be satisfied 
with your basic high-tech Holiday Inn performance. 
</P>
<P>
"Leave Me My Guitar (I'll Have an Axe to Grind)" was one of the evening's more 
satisfying numbers because Sawyer Brown stripped things down and let the song 
do the work. The same could be said for a spare rendition of "Heart Don't Fall 
Now," which centered around Greg (Hobie) Hubbard's shimmering piano work and 
Miller's voice. 
</P>
<P>
On that promising note, the band once again gave in to its worst inclinations. 
A 1-2-3 punch of "Step That Step," "Betty's Bein' Bad" and "Shakin' " went for 
crowd appeal and found Miller trotting out all his low-rent Chippendale's 
moves. The band got loud, though it never played anything worthy of the volume. 
</P>
<P>
The witty "Superman's Daughter" was a tongue-in-cheek take on the man of steel, 
which showed a sense of fun and humor that compliments the light-handed image 
Sawyer Brown works so hard to project. But again, band members managed to stem 
their momentum with a leaden cover of Z.Z. Top's "Sharp Dressed Man" that 
proved that soul is something you just can't fake.

Thunderstorms slapped North Texas with tornadoes, drenching rain and hail, 
causing floods. The storms swept through Oklahoma and Louisiana as well, but 
with lesser effect. In the East, heavy rains dropped up to three-fourths of an 
inch of rain per hour on northern New Jersey, triggering flash flood watches 
for New York City and Philadelphia. The Southwest storms spun off tornadoes 
that touched down near Abilene, Menard and Longview, all in Texas, and 
McAlister, N.M. No major injuries or damage were reported. More than 11 inches 
of rain fell in Antelope, Tex., northwest of Ft. Worth, and more than five 
inches fell along the Red River dividing the Lone Star State from Oklahoma, 
flooding roads and homes. National Guardsmen with trucks helped evacuate 150 
people from low-lying areas in Gainesville, Tex., state officials said.

The destroyer John Young rescued 46 Vietnamese refugees found adrift in a small 
boat in the South China Sea about 200 miles west of the Philippine island of 
Luzon, the Navy announced. The John Young and the cruiser Gridley "spotted the 
craft about 1 a.m. (Philippine time) while en route from Singapore to Subic Bay 
in the Philippines," said Lt. Cmdr. Bob Anderson of the Pacific Fleet. "Upon 
investigation, the refugee craft was determined to be unseaworthy -- without 
propulsion and navigation equipment," Anderson said. The 28 men and 18 women 
were taken aboard the John Young and transported to Subic Bay Naval Base.

Less than a year out of Stanford, the 22-year-old daughter of new Dallas 
Cowboys owner Jerry Jones is making $60,000 a year as an aide to a congressman 
who reports owing at least $100,000 to Jones. Charlotte Jones, who holds three 
titles on the staff of Rep. Tommy F. Robinson (D-Ark.), said "there is 
absolutely no connection" between her meteoric rise in position and pay on 
Robinson's staff and the debt.

Three Americans in four now think of themselves as environmentalists, according 
to a new Gallup Poll. Public concern about the environment tends to center on 
ecological problems that are tangible and may be directly observed in people's 
daily lives. Large majorities say they worry a great deal about pollution of 
rivers, lakes and reservoirs (72%), contamination of soil and water by toxic 
waste (69%) and air pollution (63%). After the wreck of an Exxon tanker that 
spilled more than 11 million gallons of oil off Alaska, 41% of Americans say 
they would seriously consider joining a boycott of Exxon's products; 7% claim 
they already have done so. Almost as many (46%) are opposed to a boycott. Asked 
to name the most important problems facing the nation, 4% now cite 
environmental issues; 34%, various economic problems, and 27%, the drug crisis.

U.S. District Judge John G. Penn in Washington signed an agreement that clears 
the way for the first authorized human gene transfer and requires the National 
Institutes of Health to open future decision-making on such experiments to the 
public. The settlement came in a lawsuit filed Jan. 30 by the Foundation on 
Economic Trends and its president, Jeremy Rifkin, that had challenged the first 
planned introduction of a foreign gene into human beings, an experiment to be 
conducted on 10 patients terminally ill with melanoma, a skin cancer. The suit 
had said the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee approved the experiment 
without conducting proper public hearings.

Accused mass-murderer David (Moochie) Welch was ejected from the courtroom as 
his trial opened in Oakland on charges of shooting six sleeping people to 
death. After warning Welch repeatedly to stop interrupting the proceedings with 
objections, Superior Court Judge Stanley Golde ordered bailiffs to remove the 
31-year-old defendant to a holding cell where he could watch the trial on 
closed-circuit television. Welch is charged with the Dec. 8, 1986, slayings of 
his former girlfriend, Dellane Mabrey, 17, who was the mother of his son, and 
five others, including two men, a woman and two children, ages 2 and 3.

Twenty alleged French urban guerrillas refused to recognize the court's 
authority as their mass trial on charges of murder, armed robbery and bombing 
opened in the southeastern city of Lyon. Police allege that the defendants are 
members of the Lyon cell of the ultra-leftist guerrilla group Direct Action. 
Andre Olivier, a high-school teacher alleged to be the group's ideologist, and 
Max Frerot, said to be its explosives expert, refused to answer when the judge 
asked their names. The case against the 20 includes charges arising from 30 
armed robberies, three bombings and three murders.

the charge, the official Novosti press agency said. Ligachev, a conservative

denied" the allegations made by a prosecutor, Nikolai Ivanov, who at the time 
was campaigning for a seat in the new Congress of People's Deputies, the news

Afghanistan's Marxist government said that Muslim rebels have abandoned their 
quest to capture the eastern city of Jalalabad and have opened a major 
offensive against the southern border town of Khost. A Foreign Ministry 
spokesman said at least 1,193 guerrillas have been killed since the Khost 
attack began over the weekend. Afghan armed forces responded with heavy 
artillery and air strikes to a frontal assault by 9,000 guerrillas and fired 
dozens of Scud-B missiles from bases in Kabul, the capital, about 250 miles 
north of Khost, he said.

Greek Justice Minister Yannis Skoularikis said he is leaving a decision on 
extraditing a Palestinian guerrilla to the United States to the new government 
to be formed after June elections. The Supreme Court said Friday that Mohammed 
Rashid, 34, should be extradited. The final decision rests with the justice 
minister. "The Rashid case is a major one, and the decision on whether he 
should or should not be extradited to the United States will be made by the 
government that will emerge from the June elections," he told reporters in 
Athens. The United States wants Rashid to stand trial over a midair explosion 
aboard a Pan Am airliner in 1982 that killed a Japanese teen-ager.

The hottest jockey in Maryland -- and the country -- won't have a mount 
Saturday when the Preakness Stakes is run for the 114th time here at Pimlico. 
</P>
<P>
But Kent Desormeaux, who has won more than 255 races this year, would be in no 
quandary if he were allowed the pick of the eight-horse field. If the crowd of 
about 80,000 is hard-pressed to separate Sunday Silence and Easy Goer, the 1-2 
finishers on a muddy track in the Kentucky Derby, Desormeaux can help them out, 
free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
"The horse to ride Saturday is Easy Goer," the 19-year-old Desormeaux said the 
other day. "I think he'll win the Preakness, regardless of whether the track is 
muddy or not." 
</P>
<P>
If Desormeaux handicaps races as well as he rides them, his opinion on the 
Preakness can't be dismissed. On a mission to break the record that another 
19-year-old, Chris McCarron, set when he rode 546 winners as an apprentice in 
1974, Desormeaux is riding at Pimlico by day and at Garden State by night -- 
and knocking them dead in both places. 
</P>
<P>
At Pimlico, the competition isn't even close. For the meeting that began on 
March 2, Desormeaux has won 111 races with 25% of his mounts and has 48 more 
wins than Joe Rocco, second in the jockey standings. 
</P>
<P>
Three or four days a week, Desormeaux rides the next-to-last race at Pimlico, 
which is usually off at 4:45, then takes a seven-minute drive to the Baltimore 
train station. He catches the 5:31 train to Philadelphia, which is about 100 
miles away. There's one stop, in Wilmington, Del., and after arriving in 
Philadelphia, it's a 15-minute ride to suburban Garden State Park. Desormeaux 
usually arrives there in time to ride the third race. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Desormeaux already has ridden in close to 850 races this year. His 
overall winning rate has been almost 29%, an extraordinary mark for a jockey. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, McCarron's winning percentage was .248. He rode in 2,199 races, mostly 
at Maryland and Delaware tracks. In the fall, when Sandy Hawley's 1973 record 
of 515 wins became reachable, McCarron rode six days a week at Laurel, Md. He 
also competed at Penn National, near Harrisburg, Pa., on Saturday nights and 
Sunday afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
McCarron broke Hawley's record on Dec. 16, then rode 30 more winners before the 
year ended. 
</P>
<P>
"We're halfway there (toward breaking the record)," Desormeaux said. "Our 
chances look good. If I can't break McCarron's record, maybe at least I'll go 
past Hawley's. And If I break the record, I hope they'll give me the Eclipse 
Award (as the year's outstanding jockey)." 
</P>
<P>
No matter what happens, this will probably be the last year in Maryland for 
Desormeaux. What's left to win? He's considering a move to either California or 
New York, depending on the connections he can make in either racing center. 
</P>
<P>
A handsome, dark-visaged teen-ager who handles himself with a maturity beyond 
his years, Desormeaux knows that he's got to be lucky as well as good to break 
McCarron's record. Last year, he was also determined to break the record, and 
he started quickly, winning 89 races in the first 55 days. But on Feb. 25 a 
horse he was riding went down at Laurel, and Desormeaux suffered a broken 
collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
He was out for a month, and after coming back he rode for only two weeks before 
aggravating the injury in another spill. He spent another two weeks on the 
shelf. 
</P>
<P>
"I figure that counting suspensions and injuries, I missed about 3 1/2 months," 
Desormeaux said. "And I still won 474 races. So my agent (Gene Short) figured 
that if we could avoid time on the ground this year, we'd have a good chance at 
the record." 
</P>
<P>
Suspensions may be more of a roadblock for Desormeaux than injuries. He has 
already sat out seven days this year, courtesy of the stewards, and has 
appealed another seven-day suspension, although he doesn't really expect to 
have it overturned. 
</P>
<P>
When Desormeaux started riding, back home in Louisiana, the racing wasn't even 
supervised by stewards. These were the bush tracks, not licensed by the state, 
and the betting was largely my-horse-against-your-horse. 
</P>
<P>
"It could get real nasty riding back there," Desormeaux said. "There were no 
rules and you'd do anything to win. You rode as though you were in an 
automobile race. There wouldn't be big fields, maybe only five horses in most 
races, but the only time there might be an inquiry or a disqualification was 
when the owner of the track said something." 
</P>
<P>
The operator of one of those tracks was Harris Desormeaux, Kent's father, who 
ran a place called Acadiana Downs. There are six children in the family -- 
Keith, Kent, Kristie, Kelly, Kaelin and Kip -- but only Kent has become a 
jockey. His parents tried to discourage him because of the injury factor, but 
race riding was the only thing he ever wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
At 16, Desormeaux officially began his riding career at Evangeline Downs, a 
small but recognized Louisiana track. Short had been working as an agent at 
Oaklawn Park in Arkansas, and hearing about an upstart they called Pee Wee, the 
agent went to Louisiana to see him ride. 
</P>
<P>
"He had just started his bug (apprenticeship)," Short said. "After I got a look 
at him, there were dollar signs in my eyes." 
</P>
<P>
The two arrived in Maryland in November of 1986. Maryland has long been a Mecca 
for young riders -- McCarron, Ron Franklin, Alberto Delgado and Allen Stacy won 
Eclipse Awards as top apprentices and Donnie Miller was a standout bug boy here 
even though he didn't win the award. 
</P>
<P>
But Desormeaux's first race in Maryland was no harbinger of things to come. The 
horse was disqualified and the jockey was suspended for seven days. 
</P>
<P>
By 1987, however, he had adjusted and winners came in bundles. He once won six 
races on a 10-race program. The totals at the end were 450 wins, $5.1 million 
in purses and the Eclipse for top apprentice. 
</P>
<P>
Now Pee Wee is called Superman in these parts. He looks a lot younger than 
Clark Kent, and in fact was going to the movies for half price until a couple 
of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"When he was 16, he looked like he was 10," Short said. "Here he was, making 
about a thousand dollars a week, and he was saving three dollars by passing for 
under age at the movies. I finally told him that he ought to start paying full 
price." 
</P>
<P>
For all his winning, though, Desormeaux has yet to land a major horse. He rode 
Thirty Eight Go Go, a good filly, to victory in a $100,000 stake at Pimlico 
last Saturday, but in the $700,000 Pimlico Special, his mount was Granacus, a 
79-1 shot who finished third. He rode his only two Triple Crown mounts last 
year -- Purdue King, who finished ahead of one horse as a longshot in the 
Kentucky Derby, and Finder's Choice, who ran last in the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Desormeaux's chances of breaking McCarron's record will be better 
without major stakes horses, because those are the kind of mounts that take 
jockeys out of town. Such jockeys usually don't ride as many races while 
visiting, and they are also likely to lose mounts that have run at their home 
track while they're away. 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux knows McCarron and the California-based record-holder has given him 
this advice: "Ride every day, and just do the things you usually do, and don't 
think about the record. Don't rush yourself. The wins will come if you just 
keep being yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux -- it's pronounced dez-R-mo -- may be able to celebrate the record 
as well as his wedding, which is scheduled for next Jan. 6 in Maurice, La. His 
fiancee is Sonia Romero, a high school sweetheart. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he came from a small school, Desormeaux said: "Let's put it this way 
-- it was small enough that everybody knew everybody else's first and last 
name." 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux is getting to know the names of some of the commuters on the 5:31, 
from Baltimore to Philadelphia with the stop in Wilmington. After the last race 
at Garden State, he catches about two hours' sleep in his van while a driver 
gets him to his home in the Maryland suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the train is $17, one way. And Desormeaux has been paying full 
fare. His agent wouldn't let him go for anything less.

Larry Pleau, who has been with the Hartford Whalers since the team was formed, 
was fired as coach, less than a week after the National Hockey League club 
named a new general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Pleau's firing, announced in a written statement by General Manager Ed 
Johnston, ends 18 years of work for the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Pleau, 41, was the first player signed by the franchise in 1972, when the team 
was the New England Whalers of the World Hockey Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Since retiring in 1979, he has served as an assistant coach, coach, general 
manager, announcer and general manager, and coach of the Whalers' American 
Hockey League farm team in Binghamton, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Pleau coached the Whalers three times, first in 1981 and 1982, again briefly in 
1983, and most recently since Feb. 7, 1988.

His record was 81-117-26, including 50-51-5 since taking over last year when 
the team replaced Jack Evans. This past season, Hartford went 37-38-5 and 
finished fourth in the Adams Division before being swept by division champion 
Montreal in the playoffs.

NEWSWIRE: BRADLEY BASEBALL PLAYER IS KILLED IN ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Bradley University baseball player was killed and two others were critically 
injured when a van carrying players to a tournament collided with a flatbed 
truck carrying a wide load, the Missouri Highway Patrol said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Trunk 19, a pitcher from Oak Forest, Ill., was killed when the van -- one 
of three carrying Bradley players to the Missouri Valley Conference tournament 
in Wichita, Kan. -- collided with a truck on U.S. 54 about 12 miles east of 
Mexico, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Becker, 21, of Belleville, Ill., remained in critical condition at the 
University of Missouri hospital in Columbia. The condition of David Carr, 21, 
of Crown Point, Ind., was upgraded from critical to serious. 
</P>
<P>
Bo Ryan, assistant sports information director at Bradley, said that Becker 
suffered a severely injured left shoulder and arm and serious damage to his 
left eye. Ryan said Carr suffered a damaged left shoulder, broken vertebrae and 
a severely bruised chest. 
</P>
<P>
The van driver, Michael Bell, 20, of Rock Island, Ill., a junior college 
transfer sitting out this season for medical reasons, was released after 
treatment. Four other players in the van escaped injury. 
</P>
<P>
The Highway Patrol said the van had passed another vehicle when it struck the 
large tractor frame on the bed of the truck. Part of the frame went through the 
driver-side windows of the van. Both vehicles were on the center line of the 
two-lane highway. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley withdrew from the tournament and the team returned to Peoria, Ill., by 
bus.

ABC has agreed to buy rights for the 1991 Pan American Games in Havana for $9 
million, but the deal needs U.S. government approval because of a trade 
embargo. 
</P>
<P>
ABC, which in the last year failed to gain rights to the 1992 Winter and Summer 
Olympics and lost its share of the rights to major league baseball, bid about 
three times as much as CBS paid for rights to the 1987 Pan Am Games in 
Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Frank, a senior group vice president with Trans World International, 
confirmed that ABC had reached the agreement with his company, which represents 
the Cuban organizing committee. 
</P>
<P>
Frank said that TWI had discussions with all three networks during March and 
reached the agreement with ABC about six weeks ago. He said the application for 
U.S. government approval was made about three weeks ago and that TWI's lawyers 
told him they expected a decision would be made shortly.

COACHES' BOYCOTT SPURS CANCELLATION OF ALL 12 CITY 4-A BASEBALL GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All 12 City Section baseball games involving 4-A Division teams were canceled 
Tuesday because of a coaches' boycott being conducted as part of the teachers' 
strike against the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Each cancellation was decided independently, according to Commissioner Hal 
Harkness of the City Section. He said that his office had issued no directive 
about the games. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's cancellations marked the end of the regular season. The 18 4-A 
Division coaches whose teams have qualified for the playoffs have pledged to 
boycott postseason play as well. The playoffs are scheduled to run May 24 to 
June 1. 
</P>
<P>
If the strike continues and no teams participate when the playoff dates arrive, 
the season will be canceled, Harkness said. 
</P>
<P>
The 4-A coaches have boycotted despite a recommendation last week by the Los 
Angeles City Coaches Assn. that would allow coaches who honor picket lines to 
continue to direct their teams after school. Postseason contests involving golf 
and volleyball teams were played as scheduled Tuesday, and no interruption of 
this week's postseason softball, track and swimming is planned. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Lofrano, Chatsworth High baseball coach, said he was gratified that his 
colleagues had honored their pledge to boycott and said that he had resigned as 
vice president of the coaches' association and given up his position on the 
City's Interscholastic Athletics Committee. JOHN LYNCH

WON 5 ACADEMY AWARDS, WROTE 'BODY AND SOUL'; 
</P>
<P>
COMPOSER-CONDUCTOR JOHN GREEN DIES AT AGE 80 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Composer-conductor-pianist-music executive John Green, whose film work won him 
five Academy Awards and whose songs include "Body and Soul," "Out of Nowhere" 
and "I Cover the Waterfront," died at his Beverly Hills home Monday night, it 
was announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Liberman, a family friend and publicist, said the diminutive, personable 
musician was 80 and had suffered a stroke two years ago. The official cause of 
death was listed as pulmonary edema, Liberman added. 
</P>
<P>
Green, who wrote his first hit, "Coquette," while he was still a senior at 
Harvard, was a dapper, confident and uncommonly articulate man whose trademark 
was the fresh carnation he wore in his lapel every day. He said the flower was 
to remind him of the beauty in the world and of his obligation to protect and 
extend it if he could. 
</P>
<P>
Long a fixture at Hollywood Bowl summer concerts, he was born to a wealthy and 
cultured New York family. His father was a banker and builder after whom the 
community of Greenhaven, Long Island, is named. 
</P>
<P>
Green began piano lessons at age 3 and loved them. When he was 12 he was taken 
to a party honoring George Gershwin, a friend of the family. The boy was asked 
to perform for the composer and, marching to the piano, played his own 
arrangement of one of Gershwin's songs. 
</P>
<P>
Gershwin was evidently impressed and Green became a Gershwin protege and 
lifelong friend. Green remembered, at 16, attending the premiere of "Rhapsody 
in Blue" in New York. "The bloody place blew up," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
In later years Green arranged much of Gershwin's music for movies and records, 
including a delightful album of vocals by Fred Astaire. One of Green's Oscars 
was for the scoring of "An American in Paris," based on Gershwin's music. Green 
also frequently performed Gershwin in concert. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Green wanted his son to go into Wall Street. Reluctantly but 
dutifully, Green rushed through the rigorous, progressive Horace Mann School 
and entered Harvard at 15, majoring in economics. 
</P>
<P>
But he was already deeply involved in music and spent the summer between his 
junior and senior years living in Cleveland and writing arrangements for the 
new Guy Lombardo orchestra. (One of his pals that summer was the young 
publicist for a Cleveland movie house named Lew R. Wasserman, who in subsequent 
years was Green's agent at MCA and eventually head of that giant entertainment 
company.) 
</P>
<P>
But Green's father remained unimpressed. "Son," his father told him, "you can 
be a good banker, a good lawyer or doctor and you'll be a proud, respected 
citizen in the community. But there is no bum in the world like an artist who 
is merely good, and I'm afraid as a musician you are merely good." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Took Wall Street Job 
</P>
<P>
Green graduated from Harvard in 1928 at only 19. Despite the fact that his 
early song "Coquette" was the biggest sheet-music seller in the country, he 
bowed to his father's will and took a job on Wall Street. "I was a sissy to do 
it," he confessed years afterward. 
</P>
<P>
He used his music royalties to pay for visits to a psychiatrist. Then, after 
six months, he defied his father, quit his job and became a rehearsal pianist 
at the Paramount studio in Astoria, Long Island, for $50 a week. 
</P>
<P>
He was also writing songs, often partnered with lyricist Edward Heyman, a 
friend of friends, a wealthy young Midwesterner whose family had prospered in 
sausage casings. In 1931, they wrote a package of four songs for Gertrude 
Lawrence for $250. 
</P>
<P>
"One of them had to be a comedy number, one an up-tempo item, one a ballad, one 
a torch song. The torch song was 'Body and Soul,' " Green said not long ago. 
Did he know he was writing a classic? a reporter asked him. "I only knew I was 
writing for Gertie for Wednesday," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Copyright Sold 
</P>
<P>
Green and Heyman had actually sold the copyrights to the singer. But when 
another singer, Libby Holman, asked permission to use the song in her own act, 
Lawrence generously gave the song back to Green and Heyman. As it turned out, 
the royalties from "Body and Soul" would have assured their lifetime solvency 
if nothing else had. A favorite with both singers and jazz instrumentalists, it 
is one of the most-recorded songs in the repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
During his Astoria stay with Paramount, Green did his first bit of 
movie-scoring, an arrangement of "You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me" for 
Maurice Chevalier. Green is also credited with the music for a forgotten 1930 
film called "The Sap from Syracuse." 
</P>
<P>
In 1932, Green conducted the house orchestra for the Richard Rodgers and Lorenz 
Hart musical "By Jupiter," and at the time his principal ambition was to write 
for the musical theater. He wrote show tunes for Jack Buchanan and other 
performers, but the one musical he wrote a few years later closed out of town, 
in Boston, and he did not try another. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Formed Dance Orchestra 
</P>
<P>
At the suggestion of William Paley of CBS, Green (who then was still Johnny 
rather than John) formed a dance orchestra. It opened the St. Regis roof, a 
posh new night club that opened after the repeal of Prohibition. 
</P>
<P>
Green was also the orchestra leader on several coast-to-coast radio programs, 
including the Philip Morris Hour, the Packard Hour with Fred Astaire and the 
Jell-O Show. His sidemen on the early radio shows included Artie Shaw and Benny 
Goodman (in the same reed section), Tommy Dorsey and Bunny Berigan. 
</P>
<P>
Green and the orchestra starred in a memorable short, "Music Magic," in which 
trick photography reduced Green to a Tom Thumb miniature amid the full-sized 
band. The film is still occasionally shown on television. He remained an 
orchestra leader until 1939, when he gave it up to try his hand at the 
unsuccessful musical. 
</P>
<P>
In 1942, Green left New York for Los Angeles. He did a season as musical 
director of the Jack Benny radio show, doubling as a comic foil specializing in 
dialects. He also began his major work as a film composer, initially at Metro 
Goldwyn Mayer, where he scored, among others, "Bathing Beauty," "Easter Parade" 
(for which he won an Oscar), "The Great Caruso," "Brigadoon" and "Raintree 
County." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MGM Musical Director 
</P>
<P>
For a decade, 1949-58, Green was musical director at MGM, an executive position 
in which he earned a reputation as a hard but fair taskmaster. He could imagine 
his father, Green said, whirling in his grave at the thought of his son being 
more than a musician at last. 
</P>
<P>
But Green chafed at overseeing the work of others. "I'm glad I had the guts to 
assign myself the music for 'Raintree County,' " he said in a Times interview 
in 1973. It was the film music of which he was proudest and was nominated for 
an Academy Award (one of 14 nominations in his career), but lost to Malcolm 
Arnold's score for "Bridge on the River Kwai." 
</P>
<P>
He left MGM for a similar role as musical director at Desilu and, after a brief 
stint, became a free lancer, winning two more Oscars for the musical direction 
of "West Side Story" in 1961 and "Oliver!" in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
His fifth Academy Award was as producer of an MGM musical short based on "The 
Merry Wives of Windsor Overture." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Guest Conductor 
</P>
<P>
Green recalled seeing his first performance at the Hollywood Bowl in 1921, a 
concert version of "Carmen." He returned to the Bowl as a guest artist in 1945. 
Then in 1949, he began a series of appearances as a guest conductor of pops 
concerts that lasted without interruption until 1966, when he was away in 
London for two years working on "Oliver!" 
</P>
<P>
During this period Green also conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic's 
Promenade concerts of light classics (1959-63). He continued to conduct at the 
Bowl for several years after his return from London, making his 32nd appearance 
in the summer of 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In later years, he appeared as conductor and pianist with several symphony 
orchestras across the country. His one-movement symphony, "Mine Eyes Have 
Seen," was commissioned by the Denver Symphony and performed at the dedication 
of its Boettcher Concert Hall in 1978. In June, 1988, in conjunction with the 
60th reunion of his Harvard class, Green conducted the Boston Pops Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changed Name 
</P>
<P>
As he moved out of song-writing into more serious conducting, he was persuaded 
that "Johnny" was insufficiently dignified and he became John Green, although 
he remained Johnny to old acquaintances. 
</P>
<P>
He was a four-term director of the American Society of Composers, Authors and 
Publishers and had been active as a fund-raiser and mentor for the Young 
Musicians Foundation, among several other organizations. He was a longtime vice 
president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and chairman of 
its music branch. He conducted the Academy Award presentations 10 times. 
Pepperdine University gave him an honorary degree in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Green was married three times. His first was to debutante Carol Koshland when 
he was 20. By his second wife, television consumerist Betty Furness, he had a 
daughter, Barbara, an actress in Los Angeles. In 1943, he married Bonnie 
Waters, a statuesque actress who was under contract at MGM. She survives him 
along with their two daughters, Kathy, a composer-performer who lives in New 
York, and Christopher Allyson (Kim) Green-Meglio of Los Angeles. Four 
grandchildren also survive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attended Luncheon 
</P>
<P>
Although he had suffered a stroke in October, 1987, and had been in failing 
health since then, he attended a luncheon in his honor given by the Pacific 
Pioneer Broadcasters last September when he was saluted by fellow film 
composers Henry Mancini, John Williams and Arthur Hamilton, among others. 
</P>
<P>
In what turned out to be his last public tribute, the Beverly Hills Pops 
Orchestra gave a concert in Green's honor on his 80th birthday, last Oct. 10 
with Bill Conti conducting and songs performed by Dinah Shore, Tony Martin, 
Rosemary Clooney and Carol Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
He had remained active until a few days before his death, producing as recently 
as last Sunday the annual gala for the John Douglas French Foundation for 
Alzheimer's Disease, of which he was a founder. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the foundation said that although confined to a wheelchair, he 
had lined up the talent for the fund-raiser and "did everything but conduct the 
orchestra," as he usually did. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Green said there will be a private celebration of her husband's life on 
Monday. In lieu of flowers, donations are asked to the French Foundation, 11620 
Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles 90025 or to the Bel-Air Presbyterian Church, where 
a new organ will bear his name.

JURY URGES DEATH FOR CONVICTED SERIAL KILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jurors on Tuesday recommended the death penalty for convicted serial killer 
Louis Craine. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the murders for which Craine was convicted on April 26 had been linked 
to the so-called Southside Slayer killings of prostitutes in South-Central Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Craine, 31, also had been found guilty on several counts of sexual assault in 
connection with the strangulation murders. He was acquitted on a fifth count of 
first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called Relatives 'Liars' 
</P>
<P>
An unemployed construction worker from Watts, Craine had confessed to police 
shortly after his 1988 arrest. But he recanted those statements, which were 
taped by police and later played for the jury during the trial. Other evidence 
against Craine included the testimony of several of Craine's relatives, 
including his mother, who linked him to a shirt that was stained with blood of 
the same type as one of the murder victims. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying on his own behalf, Craine earnestly proclaimed his innocence, 
calling his relatives "liars" and saying that he had never seen the shirt 
before. He said he thought his relatives, especially his mother, were mad at 
him for having left home at an early age. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys Morris B. Jones and Ronald V. Skyers did not dispute Craine's 
confession. Rather, they contended that their client made his statements only 
after sustained police interrogation. 
</P>
<P>
"He was unable to understand what he was saying," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
The defense lawyers portrayed Craine as an illiterate man with a fourth-grade 
education and an IQ of 69, who is prone to exaggerations and has a tendency to 
"parrot" the statements of others. 
</P>
<P>
They said Craine made his incriminating statements only after investigators had 
given him certain information about the murders. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. John Watson contended that Craine's 
statements contained information only the killer could have known. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strangulation Confirmed 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the cause of death of one of the victims, Loretta Perry, had 
initially been listed as cocaine overdose. She was found on Jan. 25, 1987, in 
the 9500 block of South Defiance Avenue. But after Craine spoke of having 
strangled Perry, the woman's body was exhumed and a second autopsy confirmed 
that she had been strangled. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Perry, Craine was convicted of having murdered Gail M. Ficklin, found 
dead on Aug. 15, 1985; Vivian Louise Collins, found strangled in the 1600 block 
of East Century Boulevard on March 18, 1987, and Carolyn Barney, found in a 
vacant lot near Craine's parents' home in the 9700 block of South Grandee 
Avenue in May, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Craine was acquitted in the murder of Sheila Rae Burris, who was found stabbed 
and strangled on Nov. 18, 1984. She, along with Ficklin and Barney, had been 
linked by police to the Southside Slayer killings. 
</P>
<P>
After deliberating 1 1/2 days, the jury settled on death in the gas chamber at 
San Quentin State Prison rather than life in prison without possibility of 
parole. Compton Superior Court Judge Janice Claire Croft set June 6 for formal 
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Charges against another suspect in three of the Southside slayings, former Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Rickey Ross, were dismissed Monday after 
ballistics tests linking Ross to the murders were proven wrong.

'TARNISHED' LAPD SEEKS OUTSIDE CHECK OF CRIME LABORATORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE and WILLIAM OVEREND, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saying the Los Angeles Police Department's reputation "has to be tarnished," a 
highly placed department source said Tuesday that police officials have decided 
to seek an outside review of its crime laboratory to determine how it 
apparently bungled the ballistics tests that led to the arrest of a Los Angeles 
County sheriff's deputy. 
</P>
<P>
The review will be proposed today to Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, who was out 
of town Tuesday, the source said. Gates' top lieutenants are prepared to ask 
him to approve bringing in outside experts, possibly from the FBI and Caltech's 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory, "to see if the lab is functioning 100%," the source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the review will be the expertise of the personnel who conduct 
ballistics tests, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
"The reputation (of the LAPD) has to be tarnished" after the stunning dismissal 
Monday of murder charges against Rickey Ross, said the source, who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Above Reproach' 
</P>
<P>
"I am willing to do anything to re-establish its reputation," the source said. 
"If (the LAPD) is going to be a professional police department, it has to be 
above reproach." 
</P>
<P>
Ross, 40, an 18-year Sheriff's Department veteran investigator, was accused 
earlier this year of slaying three South-Central prostitutes with his service 
handgun. Based on findings by LAPD crime lab forensic experts, Chief Gates and 
Sheriff Sherman Block told a press conference last February that Ross had been 
arrested for the murders. 
</P>
<P>
But two subsequent tests on Ross' 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol by 
independent ballistics experts from Northern California concluded that it did 
not fire the fatal bullets. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Gates nor Block commented publicly on the Ross case Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
After his arrest, Ross was dismissed and sheriff's officials have not commented 
when asked if he is to be reinstated. Prosecutors continue to describe him as a 
"suspect." 
</P>
<P>
Ranking Los Angeles County sheriff's officials said Tuesday that, as upset as 
they and many of their colleagues are over the LAPD's handling of the Ross 
case, they do not believe that it will lead to any enduring animosity between 
the region's two biggest law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect open hostility between officers," said one sheriff's official, 
who spoke on condition of anonymity. "But caution will be exhibited in our 
dealings with them, at least for a while." 
</P>
<P>
But it was obvious that some sheriff's officials were attempting to restrain 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Tough to Believe' 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough to believe that this happened," said a sheriff's source, who asked 
that he not be named. "It may have been a good-faith, honest error. Any rush to 
judgment is wrong. We're brothers in uniform." 
</P>
<P>
Another sheriff's official raised questions about the ballistics testing 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
"There are major questions about their handling of the ballistics test," said 
the official in reference to the examination of the alleged murder weapon by 
LAPD Officer James M. Fountain and Detective Jimmy L. Trahin. 
</P>
<P>
"Can we see the photos of the testing when the gun was originally tested?" the 
official asked. "Did they have somebody incompetent doing the test or was there 
tampering? Do the recent (ballistics) photos look the same as the originals? If 
they do, why would they say now that it doesn't match?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Case 'Still Unfolding' 
</P>
<P>
An LAPD spokesman, Lt. Fred Nixon, said he could not answer these questions 
because the Ross case is "still unfolding." 
</P>
<P>
But Nixon said he had "no concerns" about the future relationship between the 
Sheriff's Department and the LAPD. "We're talking about a couple of great 
organizations and the relationship is in no jeopardy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although not as sensational as the Ross case, tempers did flare between the two 
law enforcement agencies less than two years ago over the mistaken arrest of 
two sheriff's deputies by two LAPD patrolmen. 
</P>
<P>
The two sheriff's deputies, in full uniform in an unmarked car, were hunting a 
cat burglar in Carson in September, 1987 -- inside the sheriff's jurisdiction 
-- when they were ordered out of their car at gunpoint at 1 a.m. by the two 
LAPD officers. The deputies were then forced to lie face-down in the street 
until backup help arrived. 
</P>
<P>
The two LAPD officers said their actions were triggered by reports of police 
impersonators robbing illegal aliens in the area. Both officers were suspended 
without pay by Gates, one for 10 days, the other for five days, after a Board 
of Rights hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies expressed outrage at the embarrassment of two of their own 
-- and retaliation was immediate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Women Prisoners 
</P>
<P>
For about a week after the incident, the Carson sheriff's station would not 
accept women prisoners brought in by Los Angeles police officers -- forcing 
LAPD personnel to drive 15 miles away, to the Sybil Brand Institute, to drop 
off prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
And a cartoon lampooning the LAPD appeared in the sheriff's monthly in-house 
newsletter, the Star News, depicting a sheriff's sergeant speaking at roll 
call. "One last briefing item," the sergeant says. "Some LAPD units have been 
seen in our area, so let's all be careful out there."

COUNCIL CUTS BRADLEY'S TRANSIT PROGRAM OUT OF BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a setback for Mayor Tom Bradley, the City Council on Tuesday eliminated from 
the 1989-1990 budget a $7-million transit program the mayor had proposed in the 
waning days of his recent election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
On a recommendation by Finance and Revenue Committee Chairman Zev Yaroslavsky, 
who called the proposal an "outrageous" use of scarce transit funds, the 
council voted 8 to 7 to eliminate the "L.A. Pride Lines" program. 
</P>
<P>
The program would have used half of its budgeted $7 million to put 25 aging 
Rapid Transit District buses back into commission on eight of the more heavily 
traveled lines. The program would have used the remaining $3.5 million to hire 
250 area high school students to clean these and other buses. All of the funds 
would have been supplied under Proposition A -- the voter-approved half-cent 
sales tax that is earmarked for public transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One of Final Items 
</P>
<P>
The issue arose late in the council's second day of deliberations on the 
$3.25-billion budget. It was one of the final items up for consideration before 
the council completed adoption of the Finance and Revenue Committee's report on 
the budget, a key step in the complicated and lengthy budget process. 
</P>
<P>
After setting priorities among the hundreds of programs up for budget 
increases, the council ended up cutting about $25 million of Bradley's 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
The transit proposal had been supported by several council members from 
inner-city districts, such as Gloria Molina, who urged fellow members to 
finance the program. She said it is important for the working poor, who make 
the greatest use of bus service. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said that transit funds should not be wasted on what he said was 
essentially a youth jobs program. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Marvin Braude said, "What's wrong with using Prop. A funds to 
clean up buses? . . . What's wrong with hiring young people? . . . What's wrong 
with experimenting a little? This is innovative and it is imaginative." 
</P>
<P>
In defeating the program, council members agreed to use the funds at a later 
date for other transportation programs. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in an unexpected victory for the mayor, the council voted 
overwhelmingly to restore the full $2.2 million in funding for the Clean and 
Green program, which employs inner-city youths in environmental summer jobs. 
The council's Finance and Revenue Committee had recommended holding the program 
to its current year funding level of $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
In another budget action, the council agreed to appropriate $500,000 to install 
four-way stop signs at all intersections around elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Owe It to the Youngsters' 
</P>
<P>
"Judging from the response I have personally got from the PTAs and the parents 
and the principals . . . I think all of us owe it to the youngsters," said 
Yaroslavsky, who proposed the project. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Rowe, general manager of the city's Department of Transportation, said the 
agency gets calls and letters from about 17,000 people a year asking for new 
stop signs. Most of them, he said, are petitioning for signs near schools. 
</P>
<P>
The council mandate applies to all 413 elementary schools in the Los Angeles 
Unified School District. It also includes an additional 216 schools -- private 
elementary schools and a few junior high and high schools. 
</P>
<P>
The council also approved $1 million for new library books and longer hours for 
city swimming pools and also formally voted to drop funding for the 
controversial Task Force for Africa/Los Angeles Relations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recent Disclosures 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the group received about $400,000 in grants from the city, 
largely at the urging of Bradley. The mayor dropped the funding request 
following disclosures that he maintained real estate investments with Juanita 
St. John, task force director, and that the group was behind in its financial 
reporting to the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we need to say much more about that subject," said Yaroslavsky, 
a frequent Bradley foe, in recommending that the council eliminate funding for 
the group. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Robert Farrell, one of the mayor's staunchest supporters, cast the 
only dissenting vote.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PSYCHIATRIC EXAM ORDERED FOR NURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A registered nurse charged with hastening the deaths of two dying patients in 
her care at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills was ordered Tuesday by a 
San Fernando Superior Court judge to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
The evaluation's conclusions will be used to help guide the court's sentencing 
if Linda Sue Rangel, 35, of Canyon Country, pleads guilty to two counts of 
attempted murder, said Judge John H. Major. 
</P>
<P>
Rangel was arrested Nov. 21 in connection with the deaths of Lorraine Sammons, 
50, of Lake View Terrace, and Pedro Contreras, 40, of Sun Valley. Both had shot 
themselves in unrelated suicide attempts, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Rangel allegedly speeded their deaths by lowering the oxygen level on the two 
patients' mechanical ventilators without consulting either the patients' 
families or their physicians. 
</P>
<P>
Rangel's attorney, Larry Baker, refused to comment. She faces life imprisonment 
if convicted of both charges.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PORT CHIEF LEAVES FOR CONVENTION CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The executive director of the Port of Long Beach has announced that he is 
resigning to supervise the $80-million expansion of the Long Beach Convention 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph F. Prevratil, who earned his reputation early in the decade by revamping 
the money-losing Queen Mary and Spruce Goose attractions before taking the port 
job a year ago, said Monday that the new position will take best advantage of 
his management skills. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a problem solver. I came to the Queen Mary and solved a big problem. I 
came to the port and solved some key issues here," he said, citing 
reorganization of the port's management. 
</P>
<P>
Prevratil also served two years as president of the Long Beach Area Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The salary for Prevratil's new job has not been finalized.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 'COTTON CLUB' FIGURE CHARGED IN 2ND KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of four "Cotton Club" defendants named in the 1983 execution of Broadway 
promoter Roy Radin was charged Tuesday with a second and apparently unrelated 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
Former security guard Alex Marti, who is already fighting the Radin murder 
charge in a preliminary hearing under way in Los Angeles Municipal Court, was 
charged in the unrelated robbery and killing of Rene Vega on Aug. 4, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
He and two co-defendants, Scott Hadley Ashley and Rod Brennan Columbo, are 
scheduled to be arraigned Thursday on murder charges in the Vega case. 
</P>
<P>
Marti, ex-security guards William Mentzer and Robert Lowe and reputed cocaine 
dealer Karen DeLayne "Lanie" Greenberger allegedly shot Radin to death in 
connection with a drug deal. Investigators believe that the drug deal and 
execution may have been part of a plan to raise money for production of the 
movie "Cotton Club." 
</P>
<P>
Another former security guard, Carl Plzak, testified during the preliminary 
hearing Monday and Tuesday and linked all four defendants to the murder in a 
desolate canyon 65 miles northeast of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy District Atty. David Conn's first witness, "Cotton Club" producer Robert 
Evans, was excused Monday after he invoked his 5th Amendment right against 
self-incrimination.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CAL STATE CAMPUS NAMES PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert C. Detweiler, a 21-year veteran of the state's university system, was 
chosen Tuesday as the new president of Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Detweiler, now vice president for academic affairs at Cal State San Bernardino, 
was selected over four other finalists to oversee the Carson campus. He will 
assume his new post within two months. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a close call," said William D. Campbell, vice chairman of the 
California State University Board of Trustees. "He had a lot of competition. 
But it was unanimous." 
</P>
<P>
Detweiler said his immediate goals at Dominguez Hills will be to build the 
school's enrollment and strengthen its ties to the 30 or so communities that it 
serves. Dominguez Hills currently has about 8,200 students. 
</P>
<P>
Detweiler succeeds Richard Butwell, who died after a heart attack in 1987. John 
Brownell, who has served as the school's interim president, is retiring. The 
current salary is about $95,000, though Detweiler's salary has yet to be set. 
</P>
<P>
Detweiler, 50, began his career with the state in 1968 as a history professor 
at San Diego State University. He subsequently held a variety of posts at that 
school before moving to his present job at San Bernardino in 1985.

AIR FORCE FREEZES PAYMENTS TO LORAL; INSIDE BID ALLEGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Air Force on Tuesday froze payments to Loral Corp. on an electronics 
contract that federal investigators say was based on improperly obtained inside 
information. 
</P>
<P>
A day earlier, the head of the General Accounting Office recommended that the 
Air Force cancel the Loral contract, potentially worth $2 billion over the next 
10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO was acting on a complaint from Litton Industries Inc., Loral's chief 
competitor for the work, which charged that New York-based Loral had obtained 
sensitive information about Litton's bid from an Air Force official involved in 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
Federal law enforcement officials allege -- based on wiretap evidence -- that 
the official, former Deputy Assistant Air Force Secretary Victor D. Cohen, was 
paid for the information by William M. Galvin, a high-powered defense industry 
consultant employed by Loral. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Case Fits Pattern 
</P>
<P>
The case came to light in January as part of the sweeping "Ill Wind" 
investigation into corruption in the Pentagon procurement system. The case fits 
the pattern established in previous successful prosecutions, in which defense 
consultants were found to have bribed Pentagon officials for sensitive bidding 
information, which was then sold to companies seeking military business. 
</P>
<P>
Loral won the lucrative contract for F-16 cockpit electronics gear in December, 
1988, after underbidding Litton by $100 million, a Loral spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Loral strongly believes that the Air Force's selection process for its 
Advanced Radar Warning Receiver was proper," the company said in a statement. 
"The findings assumed by the GAO remain unproven allegations which Loral 
believes are untrue. 
</P>
<P>
"A delay in the program would be costly to the Air Force and damaging to a 
critical defense requirement. Loral supports the Air Force in its efforts and 
hopes that the Air Force . . . will continue the program with Loral." 
</P>
<P>
Loral is the nation's 32nd-largest Pentagon contractor, with sales to the 
military last year of $670 million. 
</P>
<P>
Litton, the nation's 13th-largest defense contractor, said it is "pleased" by 
the GAO recommendation and volunteered to work with the Air Force to "fulfill 
the requirement for production of these systems." Litton is based in Beverly 
Hills.

Reviewing Recommendation 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force said Tuesday that it is reviewing the GAO recommendation to 
determine whether it should reopen the contract to bids and punish Loral if it 
in fact won the original competition improperly. In the interim, an Air Force 
spokesman said, new funds for the program have been frozen and Loral will 
receive no additional payments. 
</P>
<P>
William D. Nussbaum, the attorney for consultant Galvin, said his client 
"denies any wrongdoing. Mr. Galvin had no inappropriate contacts with anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen's lawyer, Julian Greenspun, said there is "no proof that Victor Cohen 
gave Galvin any sensitive information. That is merely an accusation or an 
assumption by an FBI agent who wants big headlines." 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force moved to fire Cohen after the case was made public, but Cohen 
challenged the dismissal. He has been reassigned away from contracting duties 
and is conducting an economic study for the Air Force, Greenspun said. 
</P>
<P>
A federal law enforcement official said Loral, Galvin and Cohen remain under 
investigation in connection with this contract and other Pentagon business.

ADMINISTRATION SEES NO NEED TO CUT TAX BREAK ON 'JUNK BONDS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A ranking Treasury official told Congress on Tuesday that the Administration 
sees no need to change the tax laws to discourage "junk bond" financed 
takeovers, in an apparent flip-flop that provoked an angry reaction from House 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the Ways and Means Committee, acting Assistant Treasury 
Secretary John G. Wilkins said the Administration sees nothing wrong with the 
wave of takeovers and leveraged buyouts. "Conditions do not warrant us to do 
anything at this time," Wilkins said. Only if the leveraged buyouts "get out of 
hand," will the Administration offer a proposal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkins' testimony marked an apparent shift from the position the 
Administration espoused last February, when Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. 
Brady told Ways and Means members that the Administration could accept a 
trade-off on the issue. Brady said the tax deduction for the borrowings that 
fuel takeovers could be tightened, provided that Congress also eased taxes on 
corporate dividends. 
</P>
<P>
Brady's words seemed to suggest that Washington might finally act to 
substantially limit takeover activity, a step Congress has often discussed but 
never taken during the decade-long takeover boom. The Ways and Means Committee, 
which handles tax matters, expected Brady to prepare a legislative package. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fears Harm to Economy 
</P>
<P>
But Wilkins, while denying that there had been a change in Administration 
policy, dismissed criticisms that mergers wipe out jobs and brushed aside 
warnings of an economic downturn that would leave corporations struggling under 
heavy debt loads. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Administration fears that any effort to write laws aimed at curbing 
a certain kind of takeovers -- such as leveraged buyouts, or takeovers financed 
by high-yield junk bonds -- could have wide effects that would harm the 
economy. "We're very concerned about overreaching proposals," Wilkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) angrily accused Wilkins of 
backing away from the Administration's apparent promise to work for a 
trade-off. "I believe you're back to square one. I think you're retreating." 
</P>
<P>
Many members of Congress have been considering possible techniques to 
discourage the borrowing of huge sums of money to carry out hostile takeovers 
and leveraged buyouts. In leveraged buyouts, the acquirer typically borrows 
huge sums for the purchase of a corporation, repaying them later through sales 
of assets or the company's earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Congress have focused on changing the way the tax system encourages 
borrowing, helping to promote takeovers and buyouts, and has a bias against 
corporate growth that is funded through sale of stock. 
</P>
<P>
All interest payments are now deductible on money borrowed to finance 
takeovers. By contrast, dividends paid by corporations on their shares are not 
a deductible business expense. And the shareholders who receive dividends must 
pay taxes on them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lectures Official 
</P>
<P>
But congressional advocates of limiting takeovers have been fearful of taking 
any steps that might hurt economic growth or frighten investors and have been 
waiting for the Administration's recommendation on legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been waiting for months for the Administration to take a position," 
Rostenkowski said. "Your role is to provide tax advice to the committee," he 
lectured Wilkins, who is the Treasury official responsible for tax policy. 
</P>
<P>
An angry Rep. J. J. Pickle (D-Tex.) told Wilkins: "We're waiting for a 
recommendation. If we can't get one (from you), Congress will try to put a cap 
on these things. . . . We ought not to try to hurt business, but it is obvious 
something ought to be done," he added. 
</P>
<P>
While Republican members of the committee did not criticize the Administration 
position at Tuesday's hearing, other members on the majority Democratic side 
were also clearly angry and impatient. 
</P>
<P>
The volume of mergers and acquisitions has "virtually exploded" from $13 
billion a year in the 1970s to more than $200 billion currently, said Rep. 
Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.) "At what level do you get concerned?" 
</P>
<P>
Wilkins said there is "some evidence of leveling off" in the wave of takeovers. 
The total value of mergers and acquisitions was $227 billion last year. 
Preliminary figures for the first quarter suggest a total of $195 billion for 
this year, Wilkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkins insisted that "it is both difficult and dangerous to try to distinguish 
good debt from bad debt, good LBOs from bad LBOs, and good mergers from bad 
mergers using a tax policy standard." 
</P>
<P>
The "adverse effects described by many critics -- particularly economic 
dislocations -- are common to merger and acquisitions transactions generally, 
not just LBOs," he said.

Wang Zhaozhong sees a second golden age dawning for the Moscow Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is in town, and promotion of Sino-Soviet 
trade and economic ties is on his agenda. Trade between the two neighbors is 
increasing rapidly -- up 11-fold over the past decade -- and growing numbers of 
Soviets are in the Chinese capital. 
</P>
<P>
It seems like a good time for a Chinese to be in the business of serving 
Russian food. 
</P>
<P>
Improved Sino-Soviet relations open prospects for cooperation that could put 
large numbers of Chinese laborers to work in Siberia, bring Soviet nuclear 
energy technology to China -- and bring Russian cooks and a refurbished decor 
to the Moscow Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Three decades after Russians last coached Chinese chefs at the Moscow 
Restaurant, several culinary experts from the Soviet capital arrived earlier 
this month to renew what Wang, the deputy manager, calls "a kind of friendly 
technical exchange." 
</P>
<P>
Plans are under way for long-term cooperation that is expected to turn the 
restaurant -- the frequent scene of Soviet Embassy parties in the 1950s -- into 
a Sino-Soviet joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
In the glow of renewed friendship, prospects for Sino-Soviet endeavors go far 
beyond borsch and blinis. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a new model for economic cooperation between our two countries," Prof. 
Vladimir S. Myasnikov, deputy director of the Soviet Institute of Far Eastern 
Studies, said in an interview in Moscow. "This has to be worked out at the 
highest level. The economic potential is enormous, and the political 
implications are great too. . . . We think we have a lot to offer China's 
modernization program, and we are certainly interested in their products." 
</P>
<P>
Trade under government-to-government agreements totaled $2.9 billion last year, 
with locally organized regional border trade and various types of direct 
economic links accounting for an additional value of about $385 million. 
</P>
<P>
The trade under the annual government agreement is due to grow by nearly 20% 
this year, according to Eugene T. Bavrin, head of the Soviet trade office in 
Beijing, but the cross-border deals are likely to grow much faster and could 
even double. 
</P>
<P>
China's main exports to the Soviet Union include textiles, sports shoes, 
thermos flasks, soybeans, corn, meat, meat byproducts, fruit, handicrafts, 
machinery and tungsten ore. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet shipments to China include steel products, nonferrous metals, timber, 
fertilizer, generators, mining equipment, cars, airplanes, locomotives and 
railway freight cars. 
</P>
<P>
There is considerable room for this trade to expand. With central planning 
still playing a significant role in both economies -- even as they also make 
room for market forces -- annual trade plans offer some advantages to both 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Openings for Trade 
</P>
<P>
Also, the economies of the two countries are largely complementary. The Soviet 
Union is interested in buying more Chinese consumer products -- which may face 
growing protectionist barriers in Western markets -- and it would like to boost 
exports of Siberian timber, fish, coal and ores. The logic of geography and the 
low population of Siberia dictates that these products can be highly 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
"China is just a river away from huge forests," noted a Soviet economist in 
Moscow, who asked that his name not be used. "They don't need to bring this 
from across the ocean, nor do they need to pay for it in dollars, because we 
will take their textiles, their electronic products, even their surplus rice." 
</P>
<P>
Most trade between China and the Soviet Union now goes through Manzhouli, a 
Chinese border town just east of Mongolia. 
</P>
<P>
This situation may change in early 1991, however, when a railway now under 
construction in western Xinjiang province is due to link the two nations in a 
more direct east-west route already being called "the New Railway Silk Road." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union is providing rails, ties, diesel fuel, excavators, trucks and 
machinery, some of it on credit, to assist in construction of the rail line. It 
is receiving Chinese foodstuffs, consumer goods and cotton in exchange. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still a Small Fraction 
</P>
<P>
Despite the rapid trade growth over the past decade in percentage terms, this 
still constitutes only a small fraction of each country's total trade. For 
China, with 1988 trade of $69.2 billion, trade with the Soviet Union was less 
than 5% of the total. Sino-Soviet trade was an even smaller proportion of total 
Soviet trade -- about 1.5% of the country's $211-billion turnover last year. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet leaders also have dramatic ideas for integrating eastern Siberia into 
the Pacific Rim economy, with Chinese labor playing a key role. If these 
visions prove feasible, an area that has long been among the most inaccessible 
in the world could take on a cosmopolitan air and become a major supplier of 
resources for East Asian economies. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Moscow envision trilateral projects combining Soviet raw 
materials, Chinese labor and Japanese, South Korean, Hong Kong or Singaporean 
capital and marketing skills. 
</P>
<P>
Some Soviets describe the importance of this in dramatic terms. 
</P>
<P>
"Our maritime region and the whole (Siberian) Far East are in really 
catastrophic shape economically, and our possibilities of developing them from 
the center are minimal," Alexander Guber, an editor at the Soviet magazine New 
Times, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Chinese are ready, we hope to develop economic relations, especially in 
the Far East, as a top priority," Guber said. "We already have thousands of 
North Korean, Vietnamese and Chinese workers in the area, but we need 10, 20, 
even 30 times more. The Chinese are working especially well." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Other Projects 
</P>
<P>
Among the projects is a brickyard that Chinese workers from Suifenhe in 
Heilongjiang province are building across the Soviet border in the town of 
Pogranichni. Construction began in mid-1988, and production is to start in 
July, with an eventual output of 20 million bricks a year. 
</P>
<P>
Other efforts involving Chinese labor in the Pogranichni region alone include a 
meat packing house, a sawmill, production of soft drinks, manufacture of 
consumer items ranging from thermoses to handkerchiefs and the cultivation of 
vegetables and melons. 
</P>
<P>
The official New China News Agency has reported that about 10,000 Chinese 
laborers are expected to be working in Siberia by the end of this year. Smaller 
numbers of Chinese peasants are heading to work on farms in Soviet Central 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
The vision of such cooperation is not entirely new. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Mao Tse-tung proposed to Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev in the 
mid-1950s that the two countries cooperate in joint projects, with Chinese 
peasants developing the "virgin lands" of Kazakhstan in Soviet Central Asia and 
Chinese workers building industries in Siberia. 
</P>
<P>
But Khrushchev -- envisioning millions of land-hungry Chinese who might never 
leave the Soviet Union once they came to work -- rejected the proposal, Roy A. 
Medvedev, a Soviet historian, said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
Medvedev called it an "historical irony" that the two countries now "might look 
again at those projects, or ideas similar to them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nuclear Industry 
</P>
<P>
China now looks primarily to the West and Japan for technology transfer and 
investment. This orientation is unlikely to change, because Beijing has stable 
political and economic ties with these areas, which lead the world in 
industrial technology and the availability of investment capital. 
</P>
<P>
But better Sino-Soviet ties will bring a greater Soviet role in China's 
industrialization. Among the most dramatic possibilities is Soviet involvement 
in the development of China's emerging nuclear energy industry. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of Soviet reactors for a planned nuclear power plant in Liaoning 
province was a likely subject of discussion by Gorbachev in Beijing, according 
to a recent report in the Hong Kong Standard. 
</P>
<P>
Anatoly Litiagin, Moscow's deputy trade representative in Beijing, said in 
remarks reported by the Standard that the Liaoning deal is still in the primary 
stage of discussion. 
</P>
<P>
"But I must say that the Soviet Union is very interested in helping China to 
develop its nuclear power industry," Litiagin added. 
</P>
<P>
While Soviet equipment often does not match the technological levels of the 
West, it can have its own competitive advantages of price and suitability. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Factories of 1950s 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets are interested in re-equipping factories built with Soviet 
assistance in the 1950s. Soviet specialists say the Chinese have discovered 
that putting Japanese, West German or American machinery into Soviet-designed 
plants often does not work well. 
</P>
<P>
The first Soviet loan to China in three decades is the equivalent of $125 
million in credits for the purchase of Soviet equipment to renovate China's 
Baotou Iron &amp; Steel Works in Inner Mongolia. 
</P>
<P>
China is also looking for Soviet help in agriculture and food processing. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet funds and technology may be put to work in joint projects including 
chicken breeding, fish processing, soybean and coffee production and the repair 
in China of Soviet fishing ships, the official China Daily recently reported. 
</P>
<P>
At the Moscow Restaurant, remodeling is due to impart a stronger Russian 
atmosphere to the main dining hall, while some side banquet halls will have the 
decor -- and serve the specialties -- of several Soviet minorities. Improved 
Sino-Soviet ties may also improve the food itself. 
</P>
<P>
"Moscow's mayor ate here with the mayor of Beijing, and he said most of the 
dishes were not bad, but that some didn't have a real Russian flavor," Wang 
said. A few cooks from Moscow -- and a cooperative agreement ensuring better 
supplies of ingredients -- are expected to solve the problem.

Continental Retreats on Fare Hikes: Continental Airlines withdrew an increase 
in summer discount fares after its competitors refused to follow with hikes of 
their own. The Houston-based airline owned by Texas Air Corp. announced last 
month that its popular Max Saver tickets purchased after May 26 would increase 
by as much as $80. "We withdrew that (plan) today," said John Nelson, 
Continental's executive vice president for marketing. "We can't afford to be 
noncompetitive in our prices."

Boeing Ban Threatened: Four European nations will ban commercial flights by 
Boeing Co.'s new 747-400 series unless the U.S. company makes design changes 
for greater safety, a Dutch spokesman said. Transport ministry spokesman Harald 
Hameleers said the Dutch demanded modifications "months ago" in concert with 
civil aviation agencies in Britain, West Germany and France, who together form 
the Joint Airworthiness Requirements committee. Boeing Co. was not available 
for comment. At issue are changes in the design of floor beams supporting the 
400 series' upper deck, and better separation of certain electrical circuits, 
Hameleers said.

HOUSING PRICES SOAR IN STATE, COOL IN NORTHEAST IN QUARTER

Housing prices skyrocketed in California in the first three months of 1989 
despite rising mortgage interest rates, but markets cooled in the Northeast, a 
real estate trade group said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, home prices in many Midwestern industrial cities posted healthy 
appreciation rates and real estate in oil-producing states showed a spotty 
recovery, the National Assn. of Realtors said. 
</P>
<P>
The median price of an existing home in the San Francisco area soared to 
$243,900 in the first quarter, meaning half sold for more and half sold for 
less. That represented a 31.8% increase from a year ago and was the steepest 
appreciation rate among 83 metropolitan areas surveyed by the trade group. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Japanese Fuel Boom 
</P>
<P>
In fact, California accounted for the top five appreciation rates in the 
nation. Home prices in Orange County shot up 30.2% to a median of $237,900. In 
Los Angeles, prices rose 26.3% to $201,000; in San Diego, 21.9% to $163,900; 
and in Riverside-San Bernardino, 21.6% to $116,000. 
</P>
<P>
That compares to the 3.4% increase to $91,600 for the median-priced existing 
home for the entire United States. 
</P>
<P>
A healthy diversified economy, population growth and foreign investment, 
particularly from the Japanese, are fueling the boom in California, according 
to economist Mark Zandi of the WEFA Group, a Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
He and other analysts said, however, that the West Coast market may be in 
danger of overheating. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be concerned . . . that at this point it's speculatively driven and 
that the bubble may be about to burst," Zandi said. "Californians seem to have 
no concern for the amount of debt they're taking on. They seem to think home 
prices can continue escalating forever." 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is you're getting close to the end of this very rapid price 
appreciation in California," said economist Mark Obrinsky of the Federal 
National Mortgage Assn. "I think in this case the reason is going to be 
mortgage rates as much as anything else." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Areas Decline 
</P>
<P>
Fixed-rate mortgages started out the quarter averaging 10.77% and jumped nearly 
half a percentage point to 11.19% by the end of the period. One-year, 
adjustable-rate mortgages went from 8.49% to 9.31%. In the first quarter a year 
ago, mortgage rates were falling. 
</P>
<P>
Northeastern cities continued to be some of the most expensive places to live, 
but home prices in New York City and its suburbs; Boston and Worcester, Mass.; 
and Hartford and New Haven, Conn., either fell or rose only modestly. 
</P>
<P>
New York area prices -- the fifth highest in the nation, after San Francisco, 
Orange County, Honolulu and Los Angeles -- fell 2.8% to $181,700. 
</P>
<P>
The five least expensive areas in the country were: Peoria, Ill., $42,000; 
Spokane, Wash., $50,200; Mobile, Ala., $50,900; Oklahoma City, $52,300, and 
Akron, Ohio, $56,000. 
</P>
<P>
In Texas, the median price of houses and condominiums in Houston recovered 4.5% 
to $62,900, while the median rose 2.7% to $88,400 in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
A number of Midwestern cities, bolstered by a resurgence in manufacturing 
caused by last year's boom in export sales, posted strong appreciation rates, 
including Chicago, up 7%, Columbus, Ohio, up 11.6%, Indianapolis, up 10%, and 
St. Louis, up 9.9%. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, sales dropped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.82 million 
units, down 6.6% from the last quarter of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia posted declines, while 22 
states recorded increases.

SKILLS MAY FALL SHORT OF STATE'S LABOR NEEDS, STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
California faces a potential mismatch between the skills of its growing 
immigrant and minority labor force and the state's changing job needs, which 
could lead to higher unemployment and slower economic growth, a demographic 
report released Tuesday suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, immigrants and minorities -- who will comprise about half of the 
state's workers and more than 80% of its work force growth by the year 2000 -- 
must acquire increased training and education, contended the report by the 
Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless the occupational profile of California's minority groups begins to 
change dramatically, the state's future labor force may not possess the needed 
skills and training to staff the jobs produced by an increasingly technological 
economy," said the report, titled "California Population Characteristics." 
</P>
<P>
California's Latino, Asian and black populations have "below average" 
representation in many higher-skilled occupations required for the state's 
technology- and information-based economy, the report said. It cautioned, 
however, that it is not predicting that a mismatch will come about but merely 
stating that it is a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
This potential problem of job mismatches affecting minorities and the 250,000 
new immigrants coming to California each year is being recognized by a growing 
number of state and local government policy-makers, business leaders and 
planning groups. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More White-Collar Jobs 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Assn. of Governments, for example, is working with 
various groups on a plan to improve education and training and attract jobs to 
the heavily Latino areas of eastern Los Angeles and western San Bernardino 
counties, said Stephen Weiner, senior economist for the agency. The group is 
also studying programs for retraining people displaced from other jobs. 
</P>
<P>
These and other programs should be geared toward training workers for 
medium-skilled, white-collar jobs, said Stephen Levy, director and senior 
economist at the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy. 
That is because those jobs are growing while medium-skilled, blue-collar 
factory jobs -- the traditional route for many minorities to reach middle-class 
status -- are declining, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Such "middle-level" occupations expected to grow the most in total jobs between 
now and the year 2000 include salespeople, waiters, cashiers, truck drivers, 
nursing aides, secretaries, information clerks, practical nurses and repair 
personnel, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"The growth in middle-level occupations is no longer in the factory, it is in 
the office," the report said. To move up into jobs with higher status and 
income, workers must first get into these middle-level jobs -- which generally 
are people-related, involving work in offices, stores, and health and 
educational facilities, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The newest immigrants are not necessarily expected to fill these middle-level 
jobs, economist Levy said. Instead, older immigrants who came here in the 
1970s, early 1980s or before are more likely to move into those jobs, he said. 
That will make room in lower-level jobs for new immigrants, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Less Skilled Group 
</P>
<P>
Levy said the state's economy so far has adjusted well to accommodating 
immigrants. "We've been absorbing very large numbers of immigrants, and our 
unemployment is below the national level," Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
"But doing it once is not the same as doing it twice," he added, noting that 
the newest immigrants tend to be less skilled and educated than their 
predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the business community has already stepped in to provide some 
job training and retraining, said Jane Pisano, president of the 2000 
Partnership, a citizens organization formed to implement recommendations of a 
comprehensive report called "LA 2000." That report outlined challenges and 
problems facing the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE MISMATCH OF WORKERS AND JOBS 
</P>
<P>
Figures reflect what percentage of an ethnic group falls in each occupational 
category. For instance, 9.3% of all Latinos are in managerial and professional 
jobs.

SALES OF STEALTH FOR QUARTER: $657 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Northrop disclosed its quarterly revenue on the B-2 stealth bomber program for 
the first time Tuesday, reporting in a letter to shareholders that the bomber 
had sales of $657 million for the three months ending March 31. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, the company failed to disclose sales figures for the comparative period 
last year, saying they remain classified by the Air Force. The letter to 
shareholders is a more detailed account of the firm's quarterly earnings report 
made public earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The B-2 sales are almost exactly what securities analysts and procurement 
experts have been estimating for years when they said that the bomber accounts 
for about half of Northrop's sales. In the first quarter, the B-2 sales figure 
amounted to 51% of Northrop's $1.28 billion sales. Quarterly sales the year 
before were $1.37 billion. Its first-quarter profit was $9.7 million, down 
sharply from $139.6 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since Northrop began the B-2 program in 1981, the company has been 
prevented from disclosing sales and earnings on the program, though it was the 
most important source of growth for the firm. An abundance of financial detail 
on other programs, however, made the cloak over the B-2 somewhat transparent. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Demisch, an analyst at UBS Securities, said B-2 sales appear to be 
declining, based on the $657-million figure. "It was generally believed that 
the B-2 had maxed out at $3 billion per year and that would give you $750 
million a quarter," Demisch said. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate disclosure, the company said it has increased its line of 
short-term credit, which may indicate that the company is preparing to take on 
additional debt. Northrop Senior Vice President Les Daly said, "We don't know 
if we will exercise it." 
</P>
<P>
The aerospace firm experienced a negative cash flow and took on $132 million of 
additional short-term debt in the quarter, the letter indicates. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it is increasing its credit line to "150% of shareholders' 
equity," which gives the company short-term borrowing capacity of roughly $1.5 
billion, up from about $1.25 billion.

International Business Machines Corp., in a major move to make it easier for 
office workers to use its entire lineup of computers, on Tuesday introduced a 
new series of software that will provide a single set of operating instructions 
for its most popular models. 
</P>
<P>
Although the announcement had been expected for months, several analysts called 
it an important development because it represents IBM's strongest-ever 
acknowledgement of the broad role it expects personal computers to play in the 
office of the future. 
</P>
<P>
The new software programs, called OfficeVision and developed in concert with 14 
software publishing houses, will link four types of IBM computers -- a personal 
computer, a minicomputer and two mainframes -- through a single set of 
operating instructions. Currently, each of the models has its own set of 
instructions, and communications between the models has been slow and awkward. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Marketing Breakthrough 
</P>
<P>
"It will make using corporate systems as easy as video games," said Doug Kahn, 
president of Interactive Images, one of the firms that helped design the 
software. 
</P>
<P>
While analysts generally praised the software technology, they said it 
represented more of a marketing breakthrough for IBM because it underscores and 
supports the company's intention to sell its entire lineup of computers as 
components of a single package. 
</P>
<P>
"The individual products are not leap-frogging what's out there already from 
other companies. Some of the same capabilities are already available from other 
computer makers," said Stephen Cohen, an analyst with SoundView, a Stamford, 
Conn., technology investment and research firm. "But this is IBM's longterm, 
strategic vision for its office automation equipment." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Status 
</P>
<P>
Other analysts noted that by providing software that ties its personal 
computers to its larger, more powerful machines, IBM has given the PC an 
official place in its vision of the office of the 1990s -- a status that 
Stewart Alsop, publisher of a personal computing newsletter, claims that the 
company had never quite done before. According to Alsop, IBM previously 
considered the PC an anomaly, a popular machine but not one that performed 
critical computer work for big businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"Just look, IBM has started calling them workstations, not PCs," observed Jay 
Stevens, a technology analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds. "Little words mean a 
lot. Workstations mean they're considered part of a network, part of the whole 
business enterprise. Personal computers mean they're considered single-user 
machines disconnected from the overall business systems." 
</P>
<P>
The new software, explained George Conrades, IBM senior vice president, a 
personal computer user could pull away information stored on a corporate 
mainframe or mid-sized computer the same way he would gather material stored in 
his own machine. 
</P>
<P>
"The applications will work in a similar manner and present information to 
users with a common look," Conrades said. 
</P>
<P>
Rival computer makers such as Digital Equipment Corp. already offer similar 
systems, and SoundView's Cohen called the IBM effort an attempt to fight back 
and "play catch-up." According to Dataquest Inc., a San Jose market research 
firm, DEC has more than 50% of the office computer integration market. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Updating Two Systems 
</P>
<P>
IBM officials said the initial installments of the new software would be 
available next month, with eight to 10 products released within the next 12 
months. But analysts said they did not expect all the new IBM software to be 
ready until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
IBM also said it is updating two of its personal computer operating systems: 
its OS/2 Standard Edition, scheduled to be available in December for $340, and 
its OS/2 Extended Edition Version 1.2, to be available in November for $830. 
Kahn, the software publisher, said the new versions should boost sales of IBM's 
newest PCs by making it easier for software writers to develop new programs for 
the systems. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, he said, "It's been like driving a Porsche in second gear."

A 24-year-old former paralegal from a prestigious law firm, a deputy U.S. 
marshal and four others were charged Tuesday in a $3.29-million insider trading 
lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC said the ex-paralegal, Kerry A. Hurton, gave friends confidential 
information from the Boston law office of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; 
Flom about plans for a debt-financed takeover of a department store chain. 
</P>
<P>
With that information, the SEC said, at least five people bought 65,020 shares 
of stock in the chain, Parisian Inc. of Birmingham, Ala., at an average price 
of $18 a share in June and July, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
When the takeover by Hooker Corp. Ltd. was announced to the public later that 
summer, Parisian's stock quickly rose to more than $30 a share, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Return of Profits Sought 
</P>
<P>
The civil complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Boston, seeks to force the 
defendants to return alleged profits of $823,825 and pay up to three times that 
amount in penalties for a total of $3.29 million.

SUDDENLY THE SIZZLE IS WITH CAR INTERIORS; WATCH FOR TVS, FAXES AND SCULPTURED 
SEATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Like many freeway travelers today, David Rees is noticing more and more drivers 
who are doing business on the move, cellular phones cradled under their chins, 
one hand on the steering wheel, while awkwardly trying to scribble notes with 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
This sight not only makes Rees uncomfortable, he takes it as a mandate. "I see 
two messages there," says Rees, who is director of interior design for the Ford 
Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
"The first is that (automobile) customers want and need a phone in these days 
of business. And second is that we as designers have to provide that phone for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
For an industry that has seemed vaguely surprised by the car phone's hit 
performance since it was introduced five years ago, Rees' preoccupation with 
cellular technology -- in fact with car interiors in general -- may come as 
something of a shock. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Communications Accesories 
</P>
<P>
But it is grounded in the purest of motives. Not only have car phone sales 
zoomed past all projections (the Los Angeles area is the nation's largest 
market with 200,000 cellular car phone users at last count and climbing), but 
portable fax machines, laptop computers, and printers also are climbing into 
the front seat, courtesy of the innovative auto accessory market. 
</P>
<P>
How many of the nation's 110 million commuters might want to outfit their 
automobile as an office? How are they going to do all this work while driving? 
</P>
<P>
And, advancing the scenario to Year 2000 projections of time that will be spent 
on traffic-clogged freeways, what is the potential for 
the-automobile-as-comfortable-retreat? Specifically, will sculptured seats, TV 
screens, multimedia 10-speaker sound systems, remote-mounted compact disc 
changers, storage center armrests, power-adjustable lumbar supports, coffee-cup 
holders, swivel seats, flip-up tables, refrigerators and microwave ovens make 
gridlock more bearable? 
</P>
<P>
In fact, those are only some of the creature comforts either already available 
somewhere in the marketplace or on the drawing boards in Southern California's 
influential auto design studios. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the mobile telephone is just the tip of the iceberg in what is 
happening to commuters," says Ron Hill. He is chairman of the industrial design 
department at Pasadena's Art Center College of Design where auto 
industry-sponsored projects regularly preview the shape and styling of cars to 
come. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the entire auto interior that is being scrutinized," continued Hill, 
whose students recently designed car interiors for a Nissan project based on 
the premise that future drivers will be spending increasing amounts of time in 
their cars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Improve Driving 
</P>
<P>
"Most interiors are relatively poorly done; the seating is not ergonomically 
correct and . . . the actual driving of the vehicle in terms of control can be 
improved. 
</P>
<P>
"And now," Hill added, "the first challenge is to dial the cellular telephone 
without taking your eyes off the task at hand -- which is to avoid hitting 
people and things." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles design consultant Charles Pelly, whose international 
Designworks/USA turns out leading edge work for automotive clients from General 
Motors, Volvo and BMW to companies in developing countries, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
In Pelly's opinion, "We've about reached the limits for what we can do with the 
exteriors (of cars) and now the manufacturers are really turning their 
attention to the insides. . . . There's a lot of attention being paid to 
comfort, and words like visual openness are coming into play." 
</P>
<P>
This year, Pelly's Designworks staff completed its own vision of the 
car-as-environment future: a show car project called the Torrero, which Pelly 
took this March to the International Automobile Exposition in Geneva, the 
"forum of futuristic cars." The car was such a hit, he said, that at one point 
the fire department threatened to close the overcrowded exhibit booth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Command Position' 
</P>
<P>
The attraction? In part, a state-of-the-future interior with its "command 
position" for the driver, from which he or she can view a center-console CRT 
(cathode ray tube) -- a small TV screen that can display the output of a 
satellite navigation system showing the vehicle's location on an electronic map 
and providing trip guidance. Other features are controls for an on-board 
computer, advanced audio system and remote-mounted compact disc changer 
controls, as well as a fax machine and communications console armrest with 
telephone and note pad. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a $225,000 version and you might say it's overdone," Pelly allowed, 
"but these are details the ordinary car owner might expect to see down the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
"There are good designers and bad designers," he added, "and the new freedom of 
the interiors will be abused, with people selling everything from window shades 
to compasses, but I have faith in the consumer to sort it out." 
</P>
<P>
Pelly's immediate concern is the impending "electronic collision" -- as 
telephones are added to cars already loaded with switches and buttons. "There 
are safety implications to all this that have to be solved," he said. "It will 
take cooperation between multiple manufacturers, such as the telephone and auto 
designers. 
</P>
<P>
"When you consider what the phone can do when integrated with the fax machine, 
with communication of road conditions and mapping and other functions, it is 
revolutionary. My premise is that the telephone will become the communication 
with the entire vehicle and between the vehicle and the outside world. I think 
by '92 you will see a lot of integration." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Car or Office? 
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen whether the average commuter wants a car that doubles as 
an office. Or whether Americans are willing to give up on the more romantic 
idea of the auto as last refuge from the telephone. But as the car -- sprouting 
cellular phones, computers and command-post-type furniture -- rolls into the 
Age of Communication, its role and what it's going to look like have become a 
major focus for trend-watchers. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Johnson, a consumer market analyst with Pacific Bell, pondering the 
implications of a computerized car, sees two emerging schools of thought: high 
tech and high touch. 
</P>
<P>
"Some drivers are going to want a lot of sizzle," he said. "There's a whole 
group of TAFfies (Technologically Advanced Families) who are an important 
market segment. These are the first to embrace and adopt new technology: They 
were the first to buy the VCR 10 years ago, and the compact disc five years 
ago. They are the leading-edge consumers, and they sort of pull the rest of the 
market along." 
</P>
<P>
A second market segment, according to Johnson, are the drivers who, faced with 
longer and longer commutes, seek a home environment in their car, a 
"high-touch" car, filled with creature comforts. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson calls it "car-cooning." He sees "the explosion of expensive 
high-fidelity equipment which converts the auto to a miniature concert hall" as 
one indication of that impulse. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Emphasis on Comfort 
</P>
<P>
Like cocooning at home, it's "building a protective wall to lock out the 
stresses of everyday life, equipping it with large-scale entertainment devices 
and comfortable furniture," Johnson said. "People are saying, 'If I'm going to 
be stuck on the freeway, I want to be comfortable.' " 
</P>
<P>
Conversations with Detroit industry shapers confirm Southern California 
predictions that the car interior is indeed considered the "next frontier" -- 
although the major manufacturers have set somewhat different road maps to reach 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"By the year 2000, we really will have a whole new era of car," predicted Mark 
Cocroft, technical spokesman for General Motors Technical Center. "It will 
still have four wheels and an internal combustion engine, but that's about the 
only similarity it will share with a Model T." 
</P>
<P>
General Motors traditionally has leaned toward electronic sizzle, said Cocroft, 
designing cars to reflect the "urbane and sophisticated world in which we 
live." 
</P>
<P>
In cutting-edge tradition, GM already has integrated cellular telephone 
functions into the CRT controls of its 1989 Buick Riviera. (The pioneering 
Riviera introduced the CRT in 1986.) The touch-sensitive screen, located on the 
dashboard and replacing rows of control buttons, calls up a menu of functions 
including radio controls, heating and air conditioning. The system also 
monitors such under-the-hood functions as temperature, oil and fuel levels, and 
has the potential to diagnose engine problems. 
</P>
<P>
For 1990, GM's computer technology will put a computerized Visual Information 
Center -- a color screen with command-touch areas for its 51 functions -- in 
the Oldsmobile Trofeo. 
</P>
<P>
Said Cocroft: "The little screens in the Buick and in the Oldsmobile are the 
real signs of the future." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he continued, GM has a whole team of specialists looking at ways 
the car, when parked, may function as an office. "Say you are in real estate, 
and calling on clients all the time. We are looking at designs where you flip 
down the back of the passenger seat. It becomes like the top of the desk for 
writing; you can put a fax machine there. The possibilities are almost endless 
in that regard." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focus on Driving 
</P>
<P>
These functions are not to interfere with the driving, he emphasized. "We 
figure as you drive, the most you should be doing is talking on the phone. So 
that's why we now have a hands-off phone, a remote microphone. You can just 
talk as you drive." 
</P>
<P>
And he reeled off a few more futuristic bells and whistles being previewed in 
GM concept cars, the company's laboratory models for new ideas: 
</P>
<P>
* "In a continued march toward that cockpit feel," he said, "you'll see 
individual controls for each passenger for heating, air conditioning and sound 
systems." 
</P>
<P>
* "We will be using solar cells to keep the temperature constant while the car 
is parked, so that it will stay cool in the summer, and warm in the winter. 
</P>
<P>
* "You'll be able to tint your windows with electronically activated crystals, 
making it all dark but still allowing complete visibility from inside out. 
</P>
<P>
* "Also coming are active suspension systems: You'll be able to punch up what 
kind of a ride you want -- a smooth, boulevard ride, like sitting on the living 
room sofa, or a more firm (stiffer suspension) European ride." 
</P>
<P>
"These will be big changes," he concluded, "but electronics make it possible." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Phone 
</P>
<P>
At Chrysler Corp., the sizzle is softer, with less emphasis on high-tech 
details, but a phone is in the future, says Trevor Creed, Chrysler's director 
of design for all interiors. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be integrated into the back of the sun visor. You flip the visor down 
and forward, without obscuring your view; the phone pad is right in front of 
you. It looks like a calculator with finger-sized buttons and a built-in 
speaker." 
</P>
<P>
The Chrysler system, which Creed said is being readied for 1990 models, "has a 
very, very slim phone with speaker built in and a very large memory bank. 
</P>
<P>
"You program in all the numbers you are likely to use," he explained. "You 
don't have to hold anything; it comes through the radio speakers." 
</P>
<P>
Customer acceptance of the car telephone has been "absolutely amazing," he 
said. "Our merchandising people thought people would be reluctant to buy a car 
with a built-in phone, that they would prefer to buy a phone that they could 
move from car to car. But there was great reception to the factory-installed 
phone." 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler researchers also have found, he said, that after the priorities of 
reliability and safety, little things mean a lot. Drivers want details such as 
more storage capability. "Women want somewhere to put their purse, people ask 
for tissue bins and trash bins, and parents want pockets in the back seat for 
kids' stuff," said Creed, who added that Chrysler first introduced a coffee cup 
holder in the 1984 Le Baron "and it's amazing how popular it is. It has become 
a staple for our cars. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the high-tech stuff is interesting, but I think the telephone is the 
nearest we would get. I don't see us adding a PC and a fax right away." 
</P>
<P>
Ford, too, is taking a hard look at the cellular phenomenon, interior designer 
Rees said. "As a company we have never offered a telephone that you can order 
with the vehicle, but now there is so much interest that we are examining the 
possibility. But we're not ready to commit on anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looking Inside 
</P>
<P>
What his designers are ready to commit on, he continued, is the interior of the 
car. "The focus has been traditionally on the exterior designs, and in the '70s 
and '80s we got into a bland, boring life style with ho-hum interiors," said 
Rees, who's coined a phrase for interiors of the '90s: "I call it the 'Wow!' 
factor." 
</P>
<P>
It's not just the look of the interior, he said, it's also the function. "The 
comfort level is important, the location and shape of switches, the shape of 
the seats, but on top of that, we want what we call surprise and delight 
features: Little things that please you." 
</P>
<P>
Like the rest of the industry, Ford is looking at domestic cars in Japan (where 
new technology is traditionally tested at home before being exported) with 
extras such as on-board TV, satellite navigation systems, and a head-up display 
system. In the latter, an image of dashboard information, such as speed, is 
projected on the windshield in the driver's sightline, so he or she doesn't 
have to look down. 
</P>
<P>
The global advent of highly computerized cars with luxurious interiors is not 
welcomed universally. (Grumbled one engineer: "Science and technology have 
advanced to the point where you can turn the car into the bridge of the 
Starship Enterprise, but what's the point?") 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Human Factors 
</P>
<P>
And even as industry spokesmen wax enthusiastic, emphasizing the safety and 
utility of the new technology, some human factors specialists share designer 
Pelly's concerns about technological "collision." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Rockwell, a consulting engineer in Columbus, Ohio, works with auto 
companies to determine how test drivers handle new technology such as cellular 
phones and navigational systems. 
</P>
<P>
"My concern is how much time a driver has available for all this electronic 
stuff," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
His feelings are mixed: "There are some wonderful things coming out on 
dashboards, and commuters who spend a lot of time parked on freeways would have 
time for a lot of this equipment. But if you're driving, you only have 1 1/4 
seconds to attend to a display before looking back at the road. 
</P>
<P>
"I see an increased visual workload. You have to be sure when you introduce 
something like this." 
</P>
<P>
In other quarters, environmentalists and mass transit advocates are dismayed by 
the emphasis on the personal car at a time when air pollution is becoming an 
international problem. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the marketplace beckons. "As much as people have talked about other 
means of transportation," Rees noted, "American people want cars. We love 
cars."

WHY GIVE UP OUR CARS? WE'VE GOT CAR PHONES AND PLACES TO GO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A tug of war seems to be shaping up over the Southern California commuter: As 
the '90s loom, massive clean-air plans call for more ride-sharing and use of 
public transportation, even as the personal (read individual) automobile is 
becoming increasingly functional and seductive. 
</P>
<P>
According to one transportation planner nationally known for her expertise on 
travel patterns and their public policy implications, it appears the automobile 
may have the stronger pull. 
</P>
<P>
Genevieve Giuliano of USC's School of Urban and Regional Planning has been 
immersed in transportation studies for eight years, and fears that "our ideas 
of people switching to mass transit and car pools to avoid congestion may be 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Giuliano, who has written widely for academic, government and popular 
publications, has analyzed transportation patterns in cities throughout the 
country, concentrating on Southern California, "because we consider it to be 
the wave of the future, a contemporary city that has grown up totally around 
the automobile." 
</P>
<P>
She sees several social forces at work to keep the driver soloing. 
</P>
<P>
The new in-car communications technology, along with work-force changes from a 
manufacturing to a service economy, are already transforming the old notion of 
commuting as being just an exercise in frustration, she said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, she said, "if you are any sort of salesperson or consultant or 
independent operator, you can do business or schedule your meetings in the car. 
If you are a lawyer and talking to a client on the phone, you are charging $150 
an hour, or whatever you charge. In any case, it is no longer wasted time." 
</P>
<P>
And eventually the driver will be able to plug into centralized traffic reports 
and guidance systems that will facilitate traffic flow, she said. "You'll be 
able to check a computer before you leave work and get an update on the 
Pasadena Freeway, or whatever your route is. Eventually, we are looking to cars 
that will almost drive themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting away from the technology," she continued, "what I'm beginning to see 
is the tremendous impact that changing one's work schedule has on the 
household. The trend toward two-career households means responsibility for 
transporting kids and, sometimes, older parents, too. Using your car is the 
only way you can fulfill all these requirements." 
</P>
<P>
For all these reasons, Giuliano said, people will still want to drive their 
cars despite proposed incentives for ride sharing and public transit. (The 
South Coast Air Quality Management District's sweeping plan to clean up 
regional air quality by 2007 includes the requirement that large-scale 
employers offer commuter incentives such as preferential parking places and 
reduced or free parking rates for van riders, and subsidized or free bus passes 
for RTD riders.) 
</P>
<P>
Said Giuliano: "Yes, we will get some people to change modes. The HOV (high 
occupancy vehicle) lanes already help. And based on the research I've done, 
there will always be some market for car-pooling and van use." But she doesn't 
foresee massive changes in driving habits, even as congestion thickens. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more likely that we will be more selective about discretionary travel -- 
running all the errands at once, putting off recreational travel. 
</P>
<P>
"This is purely from my perspective, from watching the market working," she 
added. "The bottom line is that people want to drive cars."

SP OFFERS TO BUY DAMAGED HOMES, CREATE A GREENBELT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Southern Pacific Railroad has offered to buy 11 homes damaged by a runaway 
freight train and will convert the trackside crash site into a permanent 
greenbelt, San Bernardino Mayor Evlyn Wilcox announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement between the city and railroad officials, Southern Pacific 
will also provide 90 days of free lodging to displaced residents and pay moving 
costs within a 50-mile radius of Duffy Street, where two children and two 
trainmen died when the 69-car freight jumped the tracks Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Southern Pacific will cover the total cost of rescue efforts and 
cleanup of the wreckage and will defend the city from any lawsuits spawned by 
the derailment or any future accidents at the site, the eight-page agreement 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"We sympathize with those who have suffered and lost so dearly in this tragedy 
and we know monetary compensation cannot repair the damage," Mayor Wilcox said 
at a press conference. "But we've tried to start the healing with this 
agreement." 
</P>
<P>
Although the City Council had authorized its lawyers to seek a court injunction 
blocking the reopening of the rail line, City Atty. James F. Penman said 
concessions won through the agreement were far better than any remedy available 
through the courts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's extremely difficult to get an injunction against a nationwide 
transportation entity, and even if we had obtained one, another judge might 
have set it aside," said Penman, who noted that there were "a lot of fights" 
between the city and the railroad during two days of negotiations over the 
accord. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they believe preserving the crash site as landscaped open 
space and prohibiting future development there offers the best protection 
possible from train accidents. 
</P>
<P>
"The experts told us that if there is another derailment, it will happen at 
that curve," Penman said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the last of the mangled steel locomotives strewn about the site was 
removed Tuesday, easing concerns that a buried gas line might be punctured by 
the heavy machinery. Residents evacuated from about 40 houses on Duffy and 
Donald streets were allowed to return home Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
A Southern Pacific spokesman said trains will resume traveling the busy stretch 
of elevated railroad tracks today. Traffic had been rerouted through the San 
Fernando Valley after Friday's crash. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach-bound train was traveling an estimated 90 m.p.h. -- more than 
three times normal speed -- when it plunged off a 30-foot flood levee and 
struck a row of homes in the mostly minority neighborhood. Seven of the houses 
already have been demolished. 
</P>
<P>
Under Tuesday's agreement, the railroad will offer to pay each owner of the 11 
damaged homes the fair market value of the property before the derailment. In 
addition, Southern Pacific has agreed to enter binding arbitration to settle 
claims residents are expected to file for loss of furniture, automobiles and 
other belongings. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement does not preclude residents from filing lawsuits against the 
railroad, and several homeowners already have hired attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board's investigation of the crash continued 
Tuesday, and officials said their on-site work is expected to wrap up by the 
weekend. Board members will then determine whether to conduct a public hearing 
on the derailment. 
</P>
<P>
Although questions about what caused the train to race out of control remain 
unanswered, early evidence suggests that confusion about the weight of the 
train's cargo of sal soda and braking problems likely played a role. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Pacific spokesman Robert Taggart declined to comment on the NTSB's 
initial findings but said, "We operate a safe railroad. Obviously, the NTSB 
will make recommendations during the course of and at the conclusion of its 
investigation, and we will follow them." 
</P>
<P>
Taggart said no "specific" reforms had yet been made in response to Friday's 
disaster.

LONDON'S WAR OF THE ROSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To Mr. Anthony Beaumont-Dark, Conservative M.P. from Birmingham, it was no 
great tragedy if the pilings of an obscure 400-year-old theater had to be 
re-buried in mud and roofed over with concrete. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Mr. Beaumont-Dark told the House of Commons on Monday, if the great 
builders of the past had been forced to preserve the footings of "every ancient 
brothel or theater," London would still be a pile of Roman rubble. 
</P>
<P>
Progress in today's London means new office buildings, such as the 13-story 
affair that was supposed to start this week in Rose Lane, just west of the 
Southwark Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
But when the previous building on the site was demolished, evidence appeared 
that, as scholars had long suspected, this was the site of the theater for 
which Rose Lane had been named centuries ago -- the Rose Theatre, built in 
1587, where Shakespeare learned his craft, both as an actor and a playwright. 
</P>
<P>
The developer (Imry Merchant Developers) did the responsible thing: They turned 
the site into a temporary archeological dig. On Monday, though, construction 
was to resume. A protective layer of sand would be deposited over the remains 
of the theater, and it would be reburied. Perhaps it could be re-exhumed later, 
now that its location had been established. 
</P>
<P>
Protectionists and actors howled. Prominent actors, too -- performers such as 
Ian McKellen, Judi Dench and Peggy Ashcroft. They called the newspapers and 
formed a human chain when the sand trucks chugged up the narrow lane on Sunday 
evening. Monday, the builder agreed to put off construction for a month and the 
government agreed to pay them for the delay -- adding that this was the only 
amount of money the government planned to put into the site. 
</P>
<P>
A slightly ambiguous victory for the Save the Rose Committee. And it wasn't 
relaxing its vigil at the site on Tuesday morning. "They have acted impeccably 
-- so far!" said actor Robert Holden into his bullhorn, referring to the 
builders. "Write to your M.P.! Keep them on the right track!" 
</P>
<P>
Up on the Southwark Bridge, a crowd looked down at the remains of the theater, 
scattered like dinosaur bones at the bottom of a grave. There wasn't much to 
see: The vestiges of some pilings, an edging of bricks, a section of mortar 
floor. It wasn't much to get excited about, unless you could read its signals. 
</P>
<P>
Actor Patrick Stewart knew exactly what they meant. Stewart plays Capt. 
Jean-Luc Picard on TV's "Star Trek: The Next Generation." He and his wife had 
just flown home from Los Angeles on holiday, and suddenly he found himself "up 
to my eyebrows" in the Save the Rose campaign. As a veteran Royal Shakespeare 
Company actor, he knew that the discovery of the Rose settled questions that 
actors had been debating for years. 
</P>
<P>
For example, there is a theory that Shakespeare's plays must have been ranted, 
so as to hush a large crowd of noisy groundlings standing around the stage. The 
Rose rebukes this hypothesis. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at how small it was!" Stewart says to the crowd on the bridge. "We're 
told that the Globe, Shakespeare's second theater, was a big house. But the 
Rose certainly wasn't -- and Shakespeare's first plays were done for this 
stage. Those pilings mark the outside walls. The auditorium can't have been 
more than 60 feet deep. It's something that we actors have always felt -- that 
Shakespeare needs intimacy. 
</P>
<P>
"The bricks mark the edge of the stage. Up to now we have thought that 
Shakespeare's actors worked on a platform projecting deep into the house. This 
shows that it curved gently into the house. An actor wouldn't be working with 
spectators standing behind him. He could command the house with a look." 
</P>
<P>
The mortar floor also gives a signal, Stewart said. This was where the 
groundlings had stood. Scholars have assumed that it was a flat floor with 
spectators in the back craning their necks to see. The Rose's "pit" is more 
like a bowl, a gently-raked space, putting those in the rear on an equal 
footing with those in the front. A common-sense idea. What is strange is that 
the scholars assumed that the Elizabethans wouldn't have thought of it. 
</P>
<P>
Down at the site, actress Carrie Segrave was peering through the chain-link 
fence decorated with paper roses. She pointed to the wavering line that could 
be seen towards the edge of the stone floor, a spillway worn by rain dripping 
from the thatched roof in the protected part of the open-air theater. 
</P>
<P>
"Somehow, that makes it real to me," she said. "This really was a theater. 
Shakespeare really acted here." 
</P>
<P>
What next? Activists are cautiously hopeful either that the builders will put 
the Rose under glass and incorporate it into a redesigned office block or that 
-- better -- the office building will be canceled, and the Rose will inspire a 
new structure. 
</P>
<P>
"I love Stratford-on-Avon," said actor Michael Pennington. "But this is worth 
all of Stratford's relics put together. This is where you really feel 
Shakespeare's presence."

'VOICE' OF THE PHILHARMONIC TO BECOME CBS RADIO FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gail Eichenthal, the "voice" of the Los Angeles Philharmonic broadcasts for 
more than 11 years and the first woman to announce the national radio 
broadcasts of a major symphony orchestra, will leave her post at KUSC-FM (91.5) 
to become a film critic for CBS Radio. 
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old Eichenthal has hosted the KUSC concert series -- distributed by 
American Public Radio and heard on 95 stations -- since 1978 and in 1983 began 
producing the show. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been involved in concert music as a broadcaster and producer virtually 
all my adult life and I love it passionately, but I've felt the need to stretch 
myself in new directions for some time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Eichenthal's last live Philharmonic broadcast will be in June, but her 
authoritative and informative broadcasts will be heard for several months 
thereafter as the season's shows are repeated through December. 
</P>
<P>
Though she is excited about her new endeavor (her reviews will be heard 
nationwide), she is not without "a tremendous amount of sadness" in leaving 
KUSC. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like leaving home," she said. "In a lot of ways I grew up here." 
</P>
<P>
Wally Smith, KUSC's general manager, said: "Gail (and her production team) have 
set a new standard in the sound, production and quality of writing in live 
concert music radio programming," Smith said. "Gail has been the linchpin in 
that effort." 
</P>
<P>
Her decision to leave KUSC was propelled, she said, by "a hankering for the 
real world." 
</P>
<P>
A self-described lifelong "news junkie," Eichenthal will also take on 
newswriting and reporting assignments for KNX Radio, the local CBS affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to move into other journalistic arenas has been several years in 
the making, Eichenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
KNX's news director Robert Sims has long been a fan of Eichenthal's. "She's a 
particularly gifted writer with a wonderful sense of radio," Sims said. "That 
kind of talent is quite a find regardless of whether the person is involved in 
music or news." 
</P>
<P>
Sims said Eichenthal's film reviews, which premiered April 17 and air Mondays 
through Wednesdays, have been "very intelligent, thoughtful and insightful." 
</P>
<P>
 Sims first called Eichenthal in 1985 and persuaded her to produce a series of 
entertainment reports for his station. 
</P>
<P>
When the film critic's job became available, he urged her to try out. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I had a chance," she said. "I was up against some real film 
critics." 
</P>
<P>
But, Sims said, Gail had that special spark, a rare ability to communicate 
warmth and insight. "Gail's efforts had the sound of someone with something 
special to say, despite her rather thin film background," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Though a music major at UCLA, Eichenthal says she has been a film buff for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"Films have been a great release for me," she said. "I go to movies 
incessantly." 
</P>
<P>
In a recent movie review, Eichenthal praised a small, low-budget film: "Right 
under our noses the most marvelous mysteries are going on every moment if only 
we realized it. That's the refreshing premise of 'Some Girls,' a terrific 
romantic comedy with a French-Canadian flavor." She describes a house in the 
film as "a Gothic masterpiece filled with ancient tapestries and spooky Art 
Deco antiques," and a pack of relatives living in it as "so bizarre they make 
the Addams family look like they fell out of a Norman Rockwell poster." 
</P>
<P>
She would like to "keep a hand in classical music" and hopes to work on special 
projects with KUSC and the Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so in love with the Philharmonic that if there's any way to continue that 
association I will do whatever it takes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the highlights of her dozen years with KUSC and the Philharmonic was her 
first national broadcast on Oct. 26, 1978 -- a date indelibly etched in 
Eichenthal's memory -- the four foreign tours she has taken with the orchestra 
and the opportunity to work with former Philharmonic music director Andre 
Previn, who resigned April 25 because of dissatisfaction with the 
organization's management. 
</P>
<P>
Touring with the orchestra enabled her to learn more about the day-to-day life 
of the musicians. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of my job has been to impart a sense of what it is like for the 
musicians," she said. She said she has endeavored to persuade listeners that 
classical music is "not for an elitist audience," and has tried to humanize the 
orchestra by giving listeners an idea of what is involved in being a concert 
performer. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a tremendous amount of pride in being associated with an orchestra of 
that caliber," she said.

"Family Ties" went out on top, and NBC stayed on top for a record-setting 47th 
week in a row, ratings from the A.C. Nielsen Co. showed Tuesday. The final 
episode of "Family Ties" on Sunday night was the most-watched program of the 
week, attracting viewers in about 18.8 million homes. NBC, meanwhile, extended 
its string of first-place finishes in the weekly ratings competition to 47, 
passing the previous mark set by CBS in 1962-63. The full list of ratings is on 
Page 10. 
</P>
<P>
* When the fictitious producer on Sunday night's "Moonlighting" talked about 
the romance being over, he wasn't kidding. The once beloved series bowed out on 
an ignominious note, attracting an audience of only about 5.1 million homes -- 
1 in 10 of those watching TV at the time.

HOUSE OKS $1.165-TRILLION BUDGET

<TEXT>
<P>
The House gave final approval today to a $1.165-trillion fiscal 1990 spending 
plan that cuts Pentagon spending, increases many domestic programs and 
implements a budget agreement with President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers approved the final version of the budget, crafted last week by House 
and Senate negotiators who resolved most differences between similar budget 
plans passed by each chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Today's vote was 241 to 185. 
</P>
<P>
The package goes to the Senate, which is expected to pass it quickly. The plan 
does not require Bush's signature because it is a resolution setting 
non-binding spending and revenue outlines for congressional appropriators and 
tax writers. 
</P>
<P>
The plan cuts the deficit by $28 billion to $99.7 billion for fiscal 1990, just 
below the $100-billion deficit limit required by the Gramm-Rudman 
balanced-budget law. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say the blueprint uses too many accounting gimmicks and artificial 
savings to achieve the cut in the deficit, making the challenge of meeting 
fiscal 1991 deficit reduction goals more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers who drafted the pact with the White House said, however, that it is 
the best deal they could get, given Bush's "no new taxes" stand and the 
reluctance of congressional Democrats to slash domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
Bush announced the bipartisan budget agreement with Congress on April 14. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the narrow constraints under which the budget was developed, I believe 
it represents without question the best possible budget for fiscal year 1990," 
said Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey), chairman of the House Budget Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Panetta said that he will push for a bolder deficit-reduction package in fiscal 
1991 and that taxes must be on the table. He said the cooperative spirit that 
produced the 1990 plan "sets the framework" for future talks.

A New York diamond dealer, found semiconscious in a restroom at Los Angeles 
International Airport, said today that his briefcase containing unmounted 
diamonds worth $1.2 million was missing, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Phillip Pilikyan, 38, was found about 8 p.m. Tuesday in a men's room in 
Terminal One, where he was having difficulty breathing and was barely 
conscious, said Lt. Ruben Martinez of the Department of Airports police bureau. 
Pilikyan was treated by paramedics and taken to Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital, 
Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
Pilikyan phoned police shortly after midnight to report that his briefcase, 
filled with 2,500 carats of loose diamonds was missing. There was no immediate 
evidence that Pilikyan had been the victim of a robbery, Martinez added, but 
detectives were investigating the incident.

A judge today ordered David Schoenecker held without bail on charges that he 
killed his wife. Schoenecker, 48, wrote a newspaper columnist about the crime, 
then fled California. It was Schoenecker's first court appearance in Orange 
County after his capture by a posse in rugged mountains near Superior, Mont., 
last week. The defendant did not object to his extradition to face charges in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Schoenecker, an engineer, allegedly prepared a list of 54 relatives and 
acquaintances he planned to "punish," and many of those named were under police 
protection until his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Court Judge Kazuharu Makino in Fullerton canceled the $500,000 bond 
that had been set by a Montana judge and ordered Schoenecker held until a May 
31 arraignment.

More than a million demonstrators in Beijing and legions more in almost every 
provincial capital of China took to the streets today in the biggest 
anti-government protests since the 1949 Communist revolution. 
</P>
<P>
The center of Beijing was paralyzed almost all day, forcing visiting Soviet 
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to change his schedule completely in what diplomats 
said was a humiliating experience for China's leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet leader had to cancel a visit to the Forbidden City in central 
Beijing and to move the news conference from the Great Hall to the guest house 
where he was staying. 
</P>
<P>
"All these rallies made us nervous," Gorbachev said in an interview broadcast 
by Chinese television. But he said his visit, which has produced a 
normalization of Sino-Soviet relations after a 30-year chill, was going well. 
</P>
<P>
With no formal meetings scheduled today, Gorbachev delivered a keynote address 
to Chinese intellectuals, tramped around the Great Wall with his wife Raisa and 
held the news conference at the Diaoyutai State Guest House in western Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
The protest was dominated today for the first time by workers rather than 
students. The march began in central Tian An Men Square, the site of a hunger 
strike, to the sound of firecrackers set off under the huge poster of Mao 
Tse-tung at the entrance to the former Imperial Palace. 
</P>
<P>
Many demonstrators carried banners and shouted slogans demanding the 
resignation of 85-year-old senior leader Deng Xiaoping for not resolving the 
plight of students who called the hunger strike for democratic freedoms. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not take on myself the role of a judge or deliver assessments of what 
is going on," Gorbachev said after arriving two hours late for a news 
conference, the site of which had been hastily changed to the official guest 
house. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a difficult but genuine dialogue under way between the Chinese 
leaders and the students and other groups in Chinese society. . . . We should 
welcome the fact that there is a political dialogue and we must hope that 
solutions will be found," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Pressed to comment on the protests, Gorbachev told reporters the process of 
reform in communist countries is sometimes painful. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to answer directly when asked what lessons he might take back to 
the Soviet Union, itself in the throes of a radical political shake-up that has 
brought demonstrators into the streets of Moscow and other cities. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that in the Soviet Union, as well, if such a situation arose -- and 
problems of a similar order could arise -- we would look at them in a concrete 
fashion and find political methods to solve them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, where Gorbachev is due to meet the local Communist Party chief 
Thursday on the last day of his four-day visit to China, about 20,000 students 
and some workers were demonstrating outside government headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The peaceful protests were the climax of mounting anti-government sentiment 
which engulfed Beijing in wave after wave of marching students, factory 
workers, shopkeepers, civil servants, teachers, journalists, peasants and even 
uniformed recruits from Beijing's police academy.

The charges against William Moran, 64, and Suzanne Moran, 61, were dropped at

the couple pleaded innocent to charges, brought by their daughter, that they

WHITE HOUSE OPPOSES NEW FSX LIMITS; 
</P>
<P>
BUSH HAS 'GRAVE CONCERNS' ABOUT SENATE AMENDMENT

<P>
The White House today voiced "grave concerns" over a Senate amendment placing 
new restrictions on the U.S.-Japanese FSX jet fighter project, claiming that it 
could erode presidential authority. 
</P>
<P>
Press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush told House Republicans 
that his Administration will work against the amendment, sponsored by Sen. 
Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), when the measure gets to a House-Senate conference. 
</P>
<P>
Bush met with GOP members in the Capitol at mid-morning. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the State Department said new restrictions imposed by the Senate on 
the plan to co-produce the sophisticated new jet with Japan may force the 
renegotiation of parts of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Japan said today that it will proceed with plans to develop its next jet 
fighter with the United States but that it remains capable of producing the 
plane alone. Defense Agency chief Kichiro Tazawa expressed Tokyo's irritation 
over the Senate vote during a televised session of a parliamentary budget 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called Unnecessary 
</P>
<P>
The Senate approved the project on a 52-47 vote Tuesday. But then it adopted, 
72 to 27, Byrd's amendment to tighten the conditions under which co-development 
and co-production would take place. 
</P>
<P>
Bush "was very pleased by the overall vote. But we do have very grave concerns 
about the Byrd amendment," Fitzwater said today. "Generally, it creates a 
system of congressional approval over these kinds of projects that we consider 
to be erosive of presidential power." 
</P>
<P>
The amendment prohibits the transfer of advanced jet engine technology to the 
Japanese, in Byrd's words, "under any circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Even before Tuesday's vote, Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger 
made it known that the Administration regarded the new directives as 
unnecessary and likely to trigger new and long negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The votes came after two days of debate in which senators emotionally and 
angrily denounced Japan for what they called unfair trade competition and 
sounded warnings that the deal could threaten U.S. dominance of the aerospace 
industry by transferring vital technology to Japanese industry. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be foolhardy not to be vigilant in protecting our aircraft industry 
and the vital technologies associated with it," Byrd said. "This nation needs 
to get our economic relationship with Japan on a saner and sounder track." 
</P>
<P>
The amendment was opposed by the Administration, and Senate Republican leader 
Bob Dole of Kansas dubbed it a "killer amendment" that would require the 
reopening of negotiations with the Japanese government.

A court today convicted Mohammed Ali Hamadi of air piracy and murder and 
sentenced him to life imprisonment in the 1985 TWA hijacking that left a U.S. 
Navy diver dead. 
</P>
<P>
He received the maximum penalty under West German law. 
</P>
<P>
The three-judge District Court convicted the Lebanese Shiite Muslim for his 
role in the 17-day hijacking of 39 Americans and the brutal beating and 
shooting of Robert Dean Stethem of Waldorf, Md. Stethem's body was tossed from 
the plane onto the Tarmac at Beirut Airport. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement after the sentencing, Stethem's parents said Hamadi should have 
received the death penalty, which is not allowed under West German law. They 
also warned against any political deals that might free him early. 
</P>
<P>
Hamadi, 24, admitted taking part in the hijacking of Flight 847 from Athens to 
Rome but denied killing Stethem. 
</P>
<P>
He looked straight ahead impassively as Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger read 
the verdict to a packed courtroom inside Frankfurt's fortress-like Preungesheim 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
Mueckenberger said the court found Hamadi guilty of "joint participation in 
murder." By law, a defendant taking part in a serious crime may be convicted of 
murder even if he did not actually kill the victim. 
</P>
<P>
"He was an active member of Hezbollah," the judge said, referring to the 
pro-Iranian Shiite Muslims believed holding foreign hostages in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
The court also found Hamadi guilty on three counts of hostage-taking and 
inflicting grievous bodily harm, and two counts of smuggling explosives into 
West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Hamadi testified that the hijacking was intended to force the release of 
Lebanese Muslims imprisoned in Israel. Shortly after the ordeal, Israel 
released about 700 such prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of former passengers said Hamadi was one of two hijackers who brutally 
beat Stethem. He claimed that his accomplice, who remains at large, pulled the 
trigger. Court records identified the accomplice as Hassan Ezzeddine. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Stethem's father, Richard Stethem, his wife Patricia at his side, read a 
statement to reporters, breaking the silence they maintained throughout the 
trial. They attended all 65 sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"Our family maintains Mohammed Ali Hamadi deserves punishment more severe than 
life imprisonment," Richard Stethem said. He also warned against a "possible 
political commutation of his sentence in the future." 
</P>
<P>
"Any commutation of Hamadi's sentence would be a pure mockery of justice," 
Stethem said. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Korneck, a trial prosecutor, said Hamadi could first apply for parole in 
15 years but that he would have to meet numerous conditions to be granted 
freedom.

POLAND RESTORES LEGAL STATUS TO CATHOLIC CHURCH

Parliament today overwhelmingly passed a law giving the Roman Catholic Church 
legal status in Poland for the first time since the communist takeover in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
The law made Poland the first East Bloc country to reach a formal 
reconciliation with the Catholic Church and closed an era of confrontation in 
which the church became a powerful center of resistance to communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
Church officials said they expect an agreement by early fall making Poland the 
first country in the bloc to establish full diplomatic relations with the 
Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Legal Recognition' 
</P>
<P>
"The church has waited years for legal recognition of its rights and it has 
finally been passed in a shape which makes both the church and believers 
happy," said Jacek Ambroziak, legal adviser to Poland's bishops. 
</P>
<P>
"The new law has removed room for possible conflicts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Communist leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski was one of 306 deputies of the Sejm, 
or Parliament, who voted for the law. Two voted against and 12 abstained. Not 
all 460 members of the Sejm were present. 
</P>
<P>
The Sejm also passed two other laws, establishing freedom of worship for all 
creeds and bringing the country's estimated 62,000 clergy into the state social 
security service. 
</P>
<P>
The law establishes the church's right to build churches, teach religion and 
establish and run Catholic schools. 
</P>
<P>
It also restores church property -- including buildings, hospitals and land -- 
confiscated in the 1950s after Soviet dictator Josef Stalin installed communist 
rule in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
And it grants the church the right to broadcast Sunday Mass and religious 
programs, set up radio and television stations and publish newspapers and 
books. 
</P>
<P>
"The bill cancels the 'non-personality' of the church in the legal sense," 
Ambroziak said. 
</P>
<P>
Church-state relations have been marked by bitter conflicts since World War II. 
Hundreds of priests were arrested at the height of Stalinism in 1950 and 
religious education for children was stopped.

<P>
Playwright Vaclav Havel, Czechoslovakia's best-known opposition activist, was 
freed on probation today after serving half of an eight-month jail sentence on 
protest-related charges. 
</P>
<P>
Havel was arrested in January during a week of anti-government protests. 
</P>
<P>
His imprisonment, widely condemned in the West as well as by intellectuals in 
Poland, Hungary and the Soviet Union, marked the start of a new crackdown on 
dissent by Czechoslovak authorities. Czechoslovakia's Communist leaders have 
resisted the political reforms that are sweeping through much of the rest of 
the Soviet Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Havel, a co-founder of the Charter 77 human rights movement, may have been 
released early to head off criticism at an international human rights 
conference opening in Paris on May 30, opposition activists said.

Talks to expand air links between the United States and Japan halted after 
Tokyo cut in half a proposal Washington had found inadequate five months ago, a 
U.S. negotiator said today. 
</P>
<P>
"We were taken by surprise," said the negotiator, who requested anonymity. 
Talks are scheduled to resume in July, he said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Japanese airlines want to expand service on the lucrative and busy 
passenger and cargo air routes. Seven million passengers traveled between the 
two countries in 1988 -- a 25% increase over the previous year -- and about a 
quarter of all U.S.-Japan trade in goods moves by air, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Washington proposed 16 new services for Japanese carriers and 13 
new services for U.S. carriers, while Japan countered with 10 new lines for 
Japanese carriers and six for U.S. carriers.

LUJAN DELAYS SALE OF ALASKAN OIL-GAS LEASE

<P>
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. today ordered the postponement of an oil 
and gas lease sale in the Gulf of Alaska and the Cook Inlet, pending further 
study of the damage caused by the spill of the tanker Exxon Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan, scheduled to make the announcement in San Francisco, said in a prepared 
text that because the proposed sale "is near an area directly affected by the 
spill in Prince William Sound, I have asked the Minerals Management Service to 
delay preparation of an environmental impact statement until more is known 
about the impact of the spill." 
</P>
<P>
The environmental study was originally scheduled for completion in September of 
this year, with the leasing sale scheduled for August, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed drilling area, known as Lease Sale 114, encompasses about 16.7 
million acres located between 3 and 400 miles offshore in the Gulf of Alaska 
and between 3 and 38 miles offshore in Cook Inlet. 
</P>
<P>
Minerals Management Service spokesman Thomas C. DeRocco said that if Lujan 
decides next year to proceed with issuance of the environmental impact 
statement, the issue will first be reopened for public comment. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan's statement said, "In particular, we will be working closely with the 
governor and local communities to ensure that new issues arising from changed 
circumstances in the region are identified before we proceed."

A federal jury today rejected a woman's claims that she was injured by an 
intrauterine copper contraceptive made by G. D. Searle &amp; Co. -- the 15th 
such victory for the Chicago pharmaceuticals maker in 19 prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
The jury in U.S. District Judge Rya Zobel's court concluded that the Cu-7 
device was not responsible for any alleged injury of the plaintiff, Cindy 
Nickerson. The jury also found in favor of the other defendant, Ortho 
Pharmaceuticals, manufacturer of the Lippes Loop intrauterine contraceptive. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Searle discontinued its IUD business in the United States, 
citing what it called difficulty in getting product liability insurance and the 
cost of defending against suits.

Maxwell Communications Corp. has agreed not to try to acquire McGraw-Hill Inc. 
for 15 years, while its affiliate, Macmillan Inc., has entered an educational 
publishing venture with McGraw-Hill, the companies announced today.

<P>
The joint venture in elementary, secondary and vocational education publishing 
combines units of Macmillan and McGraw-Hill that had $440 million in total 
sales last year. 
</P>
<P>
Industry watchers have considered McGraw-Hill, the New York-based publishing

</P>
<P>
McGraw-Hill said it had accepted Maxwell's 15-year standstill agreement offer 
as part of the publishing venture deal.

Unbeaten middleweight Danny Morgan of Minneapolis gained his 30th victory with 
a seventh-round knockout of Mike Pollitt in the main event of a pro boxing show 
in Tyndall Armory.

Referee George DeFabis, worried about a badly swollen right eye Pollitt 
suffered in the third round Tuesday night, halted the bout after Morgan decked 
his foe with a solid left to the head at 1:25. Thirty seconds before the 
knockout, Pollitt had knocked Morgan down for an 8 count, then appeared to 
punch himself out before Morgan ended the match.

Top-ranked Steffi Graf of West Germany overwhelmed Niege Dias of Brazil 6-0, 
6-0 today in the third round of the $300,000 Berlin women's tennis tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Graf needed only 39 minutes to dispatch Dias. 
</P>
<P>
It was a stunning comeback for Graf, who had struggled to defeat Tine 
Scheuer-Larsen of Denmark in the second round on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Today I was back in form," Graf said after the match. 
</P>
<P>
Graf, the 1988 women's Olympic champion, is favored to win the tournament that 
continues through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In other third-round matches today, Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina defeated 
Austria's Petra Ritter 6-4, 6-2; Helena Sukova of Czechoslovakia beat France's 
Marie Damas 6-1, 6-1; and Austria's Barbara Paulus eliminated Silke Meier of 
West Germany 6-3, 6-3.

On Tuesday night, Italy's Omar Camporese, a wild card entry ranked 120th in the 
world, beat fourth-seeded Miloslav Mecir 6-2, 7-5 in the first round of the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Mecir, who returned to action two weeks ago after a back injury suffered in 
march at a tournament in Key Biscayne, Fla., looked confused and disinterested. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Italian, a doubles specialist who had beaten Mecir once before 
in Milan, scored often with big first serves and played patiently from the 
baseline while Mecir made many unforced errors. 
</P>
<P>
"I really had a lot of problems tonight," Mecir said after the match. "I didn't 
know where to go or where to hit. Every ball that came across the net was a new 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
"I was very lucky tonight to have played against a Mecir who was not in top 
condition," Camporese said.

Bill Landrum walked Bo Diaz with the bases loaded and two outs in the bottom of 
the 10th inning this afternoon to hand the Cincinnati Reds a 5-4 victory over 
the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
Landrum, 0-1, allowed a two-out single to Paul O'Neill, then walked Todd 
Benzinger and Rolando Roomes to bring up Diaz, hitting just .150 with one RBI. 
</P>
<P>
Diaz took four straight balls from Landrum to force in O'Neill with the winning 
run and give John Franco, 1-0, his first win since last Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Reds starter Jose Rijo, who had won four straight, allowed just two hits over 
the first six innings and singled home the run that put the Reds up 4-3 in the 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rijo Strikes Out 10 
</P>
<P>
But he walked Sid Bream to lead off the seventh. Pinch-runner Gary Redus stole 
second and scored on Benny Distefano's two-out pinch-hit single to tie it. 
</P>
<P>
Rijo struck out a season-high 10 and allowed just three hits over seven 
innings. The Reds have won all nine of his starts this season. 
</P>
<P>
Roomes put the Reds ahead 2-0 with his first major-league homer in the second 
off John Smiley. Diaz followed with a double and scored on Chris Sabo's single 
to make it 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati reliever Rob Dibble pitched out of a threat in the top of the ninth 
by striking out pinch-hitter Glenn Wilson and getting Jose Lind to hit into a 
force at second with the bases loaded.
