STATE WARNS SANITATION OFFICIALS ON CLEANUP; 
</P>
<P>
POLLUTION: THE OJAI VALLEY DISTRICT MAY HAVE TO INSTALL A FILTER SYSTEM TO 
TREAT WASTE WATER THAT FLOWS INTO THE VENTURA RIVER. 
</P>

<P>
State water authorities have warned the Ojai Valley Sanitation District that 
they intend to require the installation of a $5-million filter system to clean 
up waste water that critics say is polluting the Ventura River. 
</P>
<P>
The Regional Water Quality Control Board in Los Angeles issued a preliminary 
order May 4 indicating that the new system should be in place in the district's 
North Ventura Avenue sewage plant by July, 1993. The board is expected to make 
the order final at a meeting Monday in Ventura City Hall, according to several 
sources, including sanitation district General Manager Eric Oltmann. 
</P>
<P>
To begin paying for the new filters, which are designed to prevent the release 
of harmful viruses and bacteria, the district is expected to raise fees to its 
11,000 customers by 50% next year. Bills will go up from an average of $10.50 
per month to about $16.50 per month. 
</P>
<P>
At the same water board meeting Monday, the board is expected to renew a 
five-year permit to discharge waste water into the river, provided the new 
requirements are met. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to ordering the installation of filters, the new permit would 
require the district to control the temperature of its waste water and to limit 
the amount of ammonia and other substances being discharged. It would require 
the district to determine whether its discharges are responsible for the 
river's low oxygen levels, which starve fish and other aquatic life. 
</P>
<P>
These requirements will help improve the river's deteriorating wildlife 
habitat, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The state's 1990 Water Quality Assessment listed the lower seven miles of the 
Ventura River as an impaired body, meaning that it could no longer support a 
healthy fish population. The river has traditionally been the spawning ground 
for the freshwater rainbow trout and the steelhead trout. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Capelli, a member of Friends of the Ventura River, an environmental group 
that has pushed for the filters and tighter deadlines to install them, said the 
order is many years overdue. 
</P>
<P>
"The district has been pumping private waste into public waters that run 
through two public parks, and the discharge requirements haven't reflected that 
fact," Capelli said. 
</P>
<P>
But James Kerwin of Oak View, an Ojai Valley Sanitation District board member, 
contends that the filters are unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe it's really happening that viruses and bacteria are going into 
the river," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert P. Ghirelli, executive officer of the Los Angeles regional board, said 
the new filters will reduce the threat to public health from exposure to 
viruses and bacteria since the river is more widely used today than it was 10 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The order is being issued "so people swimming in the river are not exposed to 
harmful bacteria that can make them sick," Ghirelli said. 
</P>
<P>
Regional board officials said the Ojai Valley Sanitation District meets the 
current requirements for discharge of waste water into the river. The plant now 
removes solids and treats the residue with chlorine before the waste water 
flows into the river five miles upstream from the Pacific Ocean, said Ronald E. 
Sheets, superintendent of the Ventura Avenue plant. That is known as secondary 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The new filters, which would bring the plant up to more stringent, tertiary 
treatment standards, are designed to remove organisms that secondary treatment 
misses. Those organisms cling to tiny particles of waste discharged into the 
river at the treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
The waste from the plant flows to sea past the Ventura Beach R.V. Resort on 
West Main Street. A popular recreation spot named Surfer's Point is just east 
of the estuary. 
</P>
<P>
State Parks and Recreation Department figures show that more than 1 million 
people a year use the beaches in those areas and at Emma Wood State Beach, 
which provides access to the Ventura River. 
</P>
<P>
No cases of illnesses as a direct result of swimming in the river have been 
reported, said Dr. Lawrence Dodds, director of Ventura County Public Health. 
Dodds, however, added that physicians are not required to report such 
illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
The stricter discharge requirements come as no surprise to sanitation district 
officials, since the Los Angeles regional water board first discussed the need 
for the filters in 1974, Oltmann said. 
</P>
<P>
Had the Oak View Sanitary District, which then operated the Ventura Avenue 
plant, decided to install filters at that time, the federal government would 
have paid 90% of the cost, Oltmann said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the ratepayers will be obliged to foot the entire bill, Oltmann said. 
After the initial 50% hike next year, Oltmann predicted that rates will rise a 
more moderate 10% per year. 
</P>
<P>
Despite an official position opposing the order to install filters -- a 
position Oltmann said the district owes to its ratepayers -- Oltmann 
acknowledges the need for tighter controls on the discharge. 
</P>
<P>
"Filters have been proven effective in removing viruses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Ojai Valley Sanitation District has already asked contractors to 
submit proposals to build the filters, Oltmann said.

<P>
PATAGONIA GIVES $2,000 BOOST TO DARK HORSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The owners of Patagonia Inc., a clothing company that was a major supporter of 
three successful slow-growth candidates for the Ventura City Council last fall, 
have contributed $2,000 to the campaign of a supervisorial candidate who has 
pledged to block two massive housing projects in the hills of southeast Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
The donation from company owners Yvon and Malinda Chouinard to Maria VanderKolk 
nearly doubles the amount the long-shot candidate had previously raised in her 
effort to unseat Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer in the 2nd District. 
</P>
<P>
Patagonia public affairs director Kevin Sweeney, ex-press secretary for former 
U.S. Sen. Gary Hart, also is advising VanderKolk on campaign strategy as a 
personal favor, he confirmed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Patagonia will decide in a couple of days whether to contribute time and more 
money during the three weeks that remain before the June 5 election, Sweeney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm reasonably certain we'll play a role," he said. "The question is what kind 
of role we will take -- whether we will write newspaper ads or do a direct mail 
piece." 
</P>
<P>
Patagonia's interest in VanderKolk's campaign brings new energy to a low-key 
race that incumbent Schaefer repeatedly has said does not even exist. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of campaigning, there really isn't a race," the supervisor said last 
week. She had no comment Wednesday on Ventura-based Patagonia's interest in the 
2nd District, which stretches from Thousand Oaks west to Port Hueneme. Only 
residents of that district can vote in the race. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a response," said Schaefer, 48, a former Thousand Oaks 
councilwoman who was elected supervisor in 1986. "I'm not going to steal her 
thunder." 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer had $39,000 available for her stretch run, according to a March 17 
filing statement. She has spent little of that money so far, she said, and 
plans a $125-a-plate fund-raiser that actors Tom Selleck and Robert Wagner, 
both residents of Hidden Valley, in the 2nd District, have agreed to co-host. 
</P>
<P>
VanderKolk, a 25-year-old political novice who has restricted her campaign to 
door-to-door canvassing on weekends, declared in a press release that she is 
"thrilled by Patagonia's support." 
</P>
<P>
"Whereas my opponent is heavily supported by developers," she said, "I have the 
backing of a company which matches my concern in making land-use decisions that 
put the environment first." 
</P>
<P>
Patagonia, which employs 350 workers at its Ventura headquarters, turns over 
10% of its profits to environmental groups each year, Sweeney said. 
</P>
<P>
VanderKolk, a manager at a Woodland Hills product licensing firm, said she has 
been campaigning in earnest for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been trying to make everybody see that . . . for a long time," she said. 
Perhaps Patagonia's greatest contribution will be to eliminate the impression 
that her campaign has no chance of success, she said. 
</P>
<P>
VanderKolk said she has sent 1,000 invitations to a $25-a-person fund-raiser 
this weekend that will be hosted by actor Dick Van Dyke, an environmentalist 
from Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
"We're concentrating our efforts on repeat voters," she said. "We have about 
100 volunteers, and we plan a big push in the last three weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Sweeney said VanderKolk, despite her political inexperience and lack of name 
recognition, has a chance with such a strategy because so few 2nd District 
residents are likely to vote. 
</P>
<P>
About 24,000 people voted in the 1986 June primary election for 2nd District 
supervisor, compared to 18,700 in last fall's Ventura city election, in which 
three Patagonia-backed candidates drew the most votes. 
</P>
<P>
"Maria has an uphill battle and that is an understatement," Sweeney said. 
"She's got a very difficult campaign in front of her, but she's got a 
compelling issue." 
</P>
<P>
VanderKolk has criticized the supervisor's 1987 support of a 1,900-acre country 
club and housing project at Lake Sherwood and her vote last year to allow 
developers to prepare environmental reports on proposals to subdivide the 
Jordan and Ahmanson ranches near the Los Angeles County line. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer, who describes herself as a moderate on growth, said that the Lake 
Sherwood project is the only major development approved by supervisors since 
she joined the board and that it is helping to solve longtime water quality, 
sewer and lake-maintenance problems. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer has not taken a position on the Jordan and Ahmanson proposals, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But she favors a controversial deal in which entertainer Bob Hope would sell 
and swap 5,700 acres of mountain land to state and federal park agencies in 
exchange for 59 acres of parkland where developers could build an access road 
to the Jordan subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
The land-swap deal does not obligate Ventura County in any way, Schaefer has 
said. She labels VanderKolk a a single-issue candidate who does not "have a 
clue" about what it takes to be a supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Development issues are "probably one-twentieth of what a supervisor does," 
Schaefer said.

FARMERS WORRIED BY EDISON MERGER; 
</P>
<P>
POLLUTION: AN AGRICULTURAL COMMITTEE SAYS A KEY QUESTION IS WHETHER AIR QUALITY 
WILL WORSEN IF MORE POWER IS GENERATED IN THE COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
County farm leaders voiced strong concerns Wednesday about the possible effect 
of a proposed merger of Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; 
Electric on agriculture in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Agricultural Advisory Committee, describing a draft 
environmental impact report on the proposed merger as too vague, voted to ask 
the California Public Utilities Commission for a more thorough study of the 
potential effects on farming. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, which advises the County Board of Supervisors on agriculture 
issues, said one key question to be answered is whether air quality in the 
county will suffer if Edison generates more power in the county as a result of 
the merger. 
</P>
<P>
Other questions of concern to the committee are whether more pollution will 
affect sensitive crops, whether the merger might generate more smog regulations 
on farm equipment and how much more of the county's fresh water will be needed 
to cool the power plants. 
</P>
<P>
The draft environmental impact report is too vague when it comes to the 
merger's potential effects on agriculture, committee members said. They agreed 
to write a letter asking the PUC for more information in the final 
environmental statement. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make sure that agriculture does not have to cut down on its 
emissions to compensate for what Edison puts out," said Charles Schwabauer, 
committee chairman and manager of Leavans Fairview Ranch in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really think we're opposed to the merger, but we don't want to find 
that Ventura County will be adversely impacted for air quality," he said. 
"Agriculture is usually not at odds with the Edison Co., but on the other hand 
we don't want to have to be penalized for something we didn't do further down 
the line." 
</P>
<P>
The advisory committee of 10 ranchers is appointed by the Board of Supervisors 
to review planning issues that affect agriculture. The committee advises the 
board on development projects and planning policies. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of nervous farmers out there now" as a result of the drought and 
the threat to agriculture from the Mediterranean fruit fly, Fillmore citrus 
rancher Mary Ann Berrington said after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Berrington, who is not a committee member, monitored the meeting for an east 
Santa Clara Valley farm group that is seeking representation on the advisory 
body for the Piru area. She had strong words against the merger. 
</P>
<P>
"They are going to pollute the air in this county to give power to San Diego 
County and all we get is dirty air," she said. "We're concerned if they allow 
Edison to pollute, what are they going to require us to do? Put catalytic 
converters on our tractors? Somebody will have to cut down on pollutions 
somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Schwabauer said more smog restrictions could be placed on 
ranchers who operate stationary power plants, water pumps and all types of farm 
engines that are not as closely regulated now in an effort to mitigate 
pollution caused by the possible merger. 
</P>
<P>
Some citrus growers still use diesel-burning smudge pots to keep crops from 
freezing, Schwabauer said, and the devices might be regulated if the county's 
smog level grows worse because of the merger. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Susan K. Lacey demanded at a public hearing on the merger in Ventura 
last week that Edison provide offsetting measures for every additional ton of 
pollution that additional power generation might emit in the county. 
</P>
<P>
By shifting some of its power production from San Diego County to Ventura 
County, up to 200 more tons of pollutants per year could be added to the 
county's air from Edison's two power plants at Ormond Beach and Mandalay Bay in 
Oxnard, county officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Edison officials are negotiating an agreement with the county's Air 
Pollution Control District on how to offset the additional emissions. The 
district is also drafting a regulation on electrical power generators which, if 
approved by county supervisors, would require Edison to reduce the plants' 
combined emissions 90% by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
Public comment on the environmental impact report is being accepted by the PUC 
through May 29 and a decision is expected on the merger by the end of the year.

FATHER SAYS SON ENJOYED TAKING RISKS; 
</P>
<P>
THOUSAND OAKS: THE 14-YEAR-OLD DIED AFTER DRINKING TWO TO THREE INCHES OF 
WHISKEY IN A JUG, ALLEGEDLY ON A DARE. 
</P>

<P>
The father of a Thousand Oaks boy who died of alcohol poisoning last month 
after two older chaperons allegedly dared him to chug whiskey described his 
14-year-old son Wednesday as a boy inclined to take on dangerous challenges. 
</P>
<P>
Leland (Lee) Scovis was a boy who dreamed of adventure stories, his father 
said. And he had hopes of someday becoming a professional writer. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a really good kid. He had a lot of spirit," said Art Scovis, dabbing at 
tears as he spoke of his adopted son. "Yes, he would have taken a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"Lee was right in this case: He could drink the rest of that liquor," Scovis 
added. "He just didn't realize what it would do to him." 
</P>
<P>
On April 14, Leland went on a camping trip at Leo Carrillo State Beach with 
four other teen-age boys. Two of the chaperons -- construction workers David 
Campbell, 29, and his brother Patrick Campbell, 23 -- allegedly bet Leland that 
he could not drink the two to three inches of alcohol left in a gallon jug of 
whiskey without getting sick. 
</P>
<P>
Leland drank the whiskey quickly and collapsed about 15 minutes later, 
according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Two hours later, 
after Leland had developed breathing problems, one of the Campbell brothers 
began attempts at cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 
</P>
<P>
Leland was taken by helicopter to Westlake Medical Center in Westlake Village 
on the morning of April 15. At 3 a.m., Art Scovis got the call that his son was 
in cardiac arrest. For the next two days, before the boy died, the anxious 
family waited and hoped that he would regain consciousness and recover. 
</P>
<P>
Scovis said he brought a tape player into the intensive care unit at the 
hospital, hoping that the heavy metal music his son loved would awake him. 
</P>
<P>
"You have hope, and we talked to him hoping to bring him to," Scovis said. "And 
all that time his brain was dead." 
</P>
<P>
Two of the boys on the camping trip had been Leland's best friends for the past 
five years, Scovis said. A third chaperon, Priscilla Vernon, 21, of Newbury 
Park, had been known to the Scovis family for about seven years. She is the 
sister of one of Leland's friends and is engaged to David Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
"These were old friends," Scovis said. "What sort of crazy adult gets a kick 
out of getting a kid drunk?" 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Campbells were each charged with one count of involuntary 
manslaughter, four counts of furnishing alcohol to a minor and four counts of 
contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Vernon was charged with being an 
accessory to involuntary manslaughter and one count of contributing to the 
delinquency of a minor. 
</P>
<P>
The Campbells surrendered to Los Angeles County deputies on Tuesday and were 
released Wednesday on bail. Vernon, who also turned herself in, was cited and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
The three defendants are scheduled to be arraigned June 13, said Los Angeles 
County Deputy Dist. Atty. Scott Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
Leland was born in Korea and adopted by Scovis and his wife, Jenny, when he was 
2 years old. He has two older sisters. 
</P>
<P>
As he discussed his son on Wednesday, Scovis said he has heard that Leland -- 
who was 5 feet, 8 inches tall and weighed 155 pounds -- was the kind of boy who 
would protect classmates from school bullies. 
</P>
<P>
Leland was a freshman at Thousand Oaks High School. Classmates there described 
him Wednesday as a loner at times. His father said the boy indulged in 
fantasies, enjoyed playing Dungeons and Dragons and sometimes lost himself in 
adventure stories. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's room was testimony to a thirst for swashbuckling adventure. On the 
walls hung his father's old fencing sword, a sword from the Philippines and an 
18th-Century English cutlass -- a gift from his parents. 
</P>
<P>
Just last fall, a fantasy story that Leland had written about a young hero 
rescuing people with the aid of his sword was accepted for publication in Young 
People Today magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Leland, tremendously excited by his first publication, never cashed the $5 
check he was paid for the story. 
</P>
<P>
Scovis said that after Leland's death, he found a notebook of stories Leland 
had started and stopped. 
</P>
<P>
"He showed a lot of talent," Scovis said. "He wasn't a great student. He wasn't 
a great athlete. He was a good person."

SCHOOLS MAKE CUTS TO BALANCE BUDGET

<P>
The Fillmore Unified Board of Education is proposing to eliminate its 
behind-the-wheel driver training program and cut other programs to balance its 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
School district officials trimmed $330,000 from various programs to come up 
with a $12.8-million proposed budget, Assistant Supt. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Weis III said. 
</P>
<P>
By confining its driver education program to classroom instruction, the 
district will save about $4,500, Weis said. One of the primary ways the 
district trimmed the budget was to slow down its asbestos-removal program, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate action, the board changed the attendance boundaries for 
kindergarten pupils attending San Cayetano and Sespe elementary schools to 
balance enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
The switch is expected to affect about 40 students and was not opposed by 
parents attending the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Students who live between Central Avenue and A Street will be moved to San 
Cayetano in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
The district has six schools and about 3,900 students. RUSS CHARVONIA

spokeswoman Denise Alvarado said. The cause is under investigation. Buford said 
she was among several residents of the dilapidated 60-year-old building, though 
fire officials said they were aware of only four who escaped the property. 
Building and fire officials said they would be investigating its use, and that 
the owner, Chase Pulec Joint Venture, could face charges for allowing 
residential occupants in a commercial building. KEN LUBAS / Los Angeles Times

<P>
STUDY CITES DEMAND FOR RV PARK IN CITY 
</P>

<P>
The Port Hueneme City Council was told Wednesday that research shows there is a 
demand for a recreational vehicle park in the city, but about 150 residents 
showed up to oppose the idea. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is considering construction of a 10-acre RV park on the east 
end of Port Hueneme beach on the city's border with Oxnard. The park would 
serve 144 vehicles and offer a pool and shower facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The study showed that "there is a market for the park. It appears building 
something like this would have a very good chance of making a go of it in this 
area," said Jim Hanks, the city's financial director, after reviewing a report 
from a private contractor hired to study the feasibility of the project. 
</P>
<P>
No action was taken by the council. The City Council will await completion of 
the report by Williams-Kuebelbeck and Associates of Irvine, which will analyze 
the financial feasibility of the project, at a cost of $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 residents living near the project showed up to urge the council to 
scrap the idea because of traffic and noise concerns. The council refused to 
open the meeting for public comment and deferred the issue to an undetermined 
later date. One resident had to be removed by police for disturbing the meeting 
despite admonishments from Mayor Dorill Wright. 
</P>
<P>
Also at the meeting, the council took the first step toward approving an 
ordinance requiring that all new development employ water conservation devices, 
such as low-flow shower heads. 
</P>
<P>
All cities will be required to pass such an ordinance by Jan. 1, 1992. "We are 
just getting the jump a little bit on what the state is requiring," said Tom 
Figg, the Port Hueneme community development director. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt it was important, at least for all new construction coming on line, 
that they install ultra-low consumption plumbing fixtures," Figg said. 
</P>
<P>
The council's move comes in response to imminent water cutbacks for the city 
and "a general consciousness of the need to conserve what traditionally has 
been a wasted resource," Figg said. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance will become effective July 1. JOEL BRAND

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS; 
</P>
<P>
OWNER VOWS TO KEEP MINIATURE HORSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The owner of two miniature horses said Wednesday that he has changed his mind 
and will fight to keep the 33-inch-tall geldings in his back yard after all. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Bowlay-Williams of Thousand Oaks had agreed Tuesday to remove the 
miniature horses, Chips and Apache, from his home. Ventura Municipal Judge 
Barry B. Klopfer on Tuesday continued Bowlay-Williams' zoning violation trial 
until June 19 to give him time to move the unusual pets. 
</P>
<P>
However, Bowlay-Williams, a state Corrections Department officer, said he plans 
to hire a new attorney and defend himself. "I'm going to fight this thing to 
the finish," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that he hasn't had the heart to tell his daughter, Rachelle, 6, that 
she may be separated from her pet, Chips. Apache is Bowlay-Williams' pet, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bowlay-Williams said he is especially determined to retain the horses despite a 
city ordinance against keeping livestock on a lot smaller than 20,000 square 
feet. His property totals about 13,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Bowlay-Williams said he agreed Tuesday to remove the horses from his home 
because his attorney, Philip R. Dunn, told him that there was no chance of 
successfully defending himself against the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Bowlay-Williams said Wednesday: "I'll get a new attorney. I may even sue the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
"They're like members of the family," he said, referring to the horses. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Schreiner, a Thousand Oaks deputy city attorney who was to prosecute the 
case, said a number of neighbors have complained about Chips and Apache since 
Bowlay-Williams acquired them last year. "It isn't just the smell," Schreiner 
said. "One woman is allergic to horses." 
</P>
<P>
In a similar Thousand Oaks case that attracted wide attention, charges against 
Patty and Richard Fairchild were dismissed in 1987, allowing the Fairchilds to 
keep their miniature horse, Ragtime, at their home on Shady Brook Drive. In 
that case, the judge found that the zoning code dealing with horses was poorly 
worded. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Schreiner said, the code has been tightened, and even tiny horses 
are classified as livestock. JACK SEARLES

BODY FOUND NEAR INDIO IS MISSING VAN NUYS WOMAN; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE 24-YEAR-OLD VICTIM DIED OF MULTIPLE GUNSHOT WOUNDS. SHE DISAPPEARED 
OVER EASTER WEEKEND WHILE DRIVING HOME FROM PHOENIX.

<P>
A body found in a secluded citrus grove in Riverside County has been identified 
as Jamie Michele Bowie, a Van Nuys woman who was the subject of an intense 
search last month after she disappeared while driving home from Phoenix, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old woman had been shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside County Sheriff's Sgt. Jon Carlson said Bowie's body was found 
Saturday by an irrigation worker in a remote agricultural area about two miles 
north of Indio and Interstate 10, the route the woman was known to be taking 
home after an Easter visit to friends in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
There were no signs of a struggle or an effort to cover or bury the body, 
Carlson said. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear whether Bowie was killed at the scene or killed elsewhere and 
dumped there. "The indications are that she was dumped at that location," 
Carlson said. 
</P>
<P>
The body was badly decomposed, and there was no identification. It was not 
identified as Bowie until Tuesday when dental records were provided to medical 
examiners. Carlson said an autopsy determined that she died of multiple gunshot 
wounds. Though bullet casings were found near the body, it was unknown if they 
were from the weapon used in the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
The body was fully clothed but too badly decomposed for investigators to 
determine if she had been sexually assaulted, Carlson said. Determining time of 
death was also hampered by the condition of the body. 
</P>
<P>
"It is hard to tell. The best estimate is that she was dead longer than 10 
days," Carlson said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police investigators who headed the investigation into Bowie's 
April 16 disappearance were expected to go to Indio today to confer with 
investigators from Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
Carlson said the Los Angeles investigators will be joined in Indio by FBI 
agents and investigators from Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to get together and collate information and try to develop a 
focus to the investigation," Carlson said. 
</P>
<P>
There are no suspects in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Bowie had recently moved to Van Nuys from Oklahoma and was to start a new job 
the week she disappeared. She had gone to Phoenix to visit a friend during 
Easter weekend and was driving back alone in her Volkswagen convertible when 
she apparently had car trouble near Quartzsite, about 15 miles east of the 
California border. 
</P>
<P>
Police said witnesses reported seeing her at a service station where she might 
have accepted help from two sets of motorists, who left the station in two cars 
at the same time she did. 
</P>
<P>
Bowie did not return to her Van Nuys apartment and her car was never found. A 
day later her apartment was burglarized by someone who had a key, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the disappearance and the burglary, investigators immediately 
believed that foul play was involved in the disappearance. Helicopters were 
used to search the I-10 corridor between Los Angeles and Phoenix for three 
days, but there was no sign of the woman or her car. 
</P>
<P>
"This has turned out the way we thought it might be," Los Angeles Police Lt. 
Dennis Dunn said Wednesday. "It's a sad one."

ELDER AIDE A FOCUS IN '88 STATE PROBE OF DAVIS, PAPERS REVEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State prosecutors in 1988 questioned whether Assemblyman Dave Elder had allowed 
an aide to raise campaign contributions for Controller Gray Davis during state 
working hours, according to documents recently made public by the attorney 
general's office. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators focused on the activities of Susan Grivas as part of an 
investigation into allegations that Davis illegally used public employees and 
state facilities in his successful 1986 election campaign. Grivas was an 
assistant to Elder, a San Pedro Democrat, for four months. 
</P>
<P>
The deliberate use of state staff, offices and equipment for campaign purposes 
is illegal. Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp decided in 1988 not to prosecute 
Davis, citing insufficient evidence, and accepted a civil settlement requiring 
the Davis campaign to reimburse the state $28,000. 
</P>
<P>
Elder and Grivas have denied wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors determined that there is insufficient evidence to pursue criminal 
charges against Grivas. 
</P>
<P>
John Gordnier, senior assistant attorney general, said his office did not 
conduct a separate inquiry into Elder's activities because an informant's 
assertions could not be corroborated. 
</P>
<P>
"Assemblyman Elder was questioned twice under oath and denied any wrongdoing," 
Gordnier said in a statement released Tuesday. "The primary informant refused 
to cooperate with us in any way, and as a result we had no evidence to refute 
Elder's testimony, nor did we have investigative leads which might have led to 
other evidence." 
</P>
<P>
Elder said Tuesday that for the last two years he has sought an explanation 
from the attorney general's office so that if necessary he could collect money 
from Davis that the state may be owed for time Grivas spent on campaign 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has also asked the Assembly Rules Committee to make a formal request 
for the information "so the taxpayers get their money's worth." 
</P>
<P>
The Times has previously reported that Grivas confirmed that she performed some 
campaign duties while still on Davis' legislative staff but that she said she 
always made up the time later in the day. She worked for Davis before and after 
she worked for Elder. 
</P>
<P>
First elected in 1978, Elder is seeking his seventh term representing the 57th 
Assembly District, which includes most of San Pedro, Wilmington, Harbor City 
and the western portions of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In the Tuesday interview, Elder pointed out that Davis, not Elder, was the 
investigation target. He also complained that Davis, with whom he served in the 
Assembly, and Grivas had "misrepresented what she was doing." 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Elder cited an Eastern trip Grivas took with Davis in December, 
1986, shortly after she joined Elder's staff. 
</P>
<P>
Elder said he was unaware of the trip to meet with investment bankers and 
maintained that it had not been authorized. Investigators reported that Grivas 
was present when Davis discussed fund-raising with the bankers. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Joseph Remcho, who was an attorney for Grivas and Davis' campaign 
committee, said that there is nothing new in the investigative files and that 
the matter has been resolved to the satisfaction of the attorney general's 
office. "They were clearly not troubled by the New York trip, because it was 
not even included in their settlement calculations," Remcho said. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to reach Grivas were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
A review of dozens of investigative reports and interviews shows that state 
authorities raised questions about whether Elder hired Grivas merely as a favor 
to Davis. 
</P>
<P>
And agents examined how well the lawmaker's staff monitored Grivas' activities, 
especially since her office was in the controller's office, blocks from the 
Capitol, even while she worked for Elder. 
</P>
<P>
Elder said in the interview Tuesday that he did not have room for Grivas in his 
Capitol quarters, so he allowed her to work at the controller's office. 
</P>
<P>
Grivas began working with Elder in December, 1986, for $2,200 a month. Elder 
told investigators that he had known Grivas had worked for Davis in the 
Assembly and that he probably discussed her employment with the controller and 
Noel Gould, who had been Davis' campaign coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Elder said in the interview that Grivas, who left his office in March, 1987, 
was hired temporarily to monitor activities of the state's public employee and 
teacher retirement systems for a committee he headed. Elder said he anticipated 
working closely with Davis to ensure that the pension funds increased the 
amount of money invested in California, especially in real estate. 
</P>
<P>
However, a former Elder secretary, Janice Katz, said in a sworn statement that 
it was her impression that Elder hired Grivas as a favor to Davis and that even 
though Grivas was on the assemblyman's payroll, she worked for the controller. 
</P>
<P>
John Popovich, director of public affairs for First Interstate Bank, told 
investigators that in November, 1986, Grivas attended a Los Angeles meeting at 
which Davis discussed his policies on direct deposits and mentioned that he was 
left with a campaign deficit and was looking for someone to hold a fund-raiser 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The bank agreed to hold the event, and another bank employee told investigators 
that during the first week of December, she was in touch with Grivas about who 
would attend the event. Grivas was hired by Elder on Dec. 5. 
</P>
<P>
In an Aug. 26, 1988, memo, Deputy Atty. Gen. Vincent W. Reagor asserted that 
the state could prove that Grivas "did work for Davis in his Beverly Hills 
office after she was hired by Elder. We can also prove she accompanied Davis to 
New York City and Washington during the workweek while employed by Elder." 
</P>
<P>
Grivas told investigators that she thought she was doing her assigned job. She 
maintained that any campaign work was done on her own time, not at taxpayers' 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
Davis told the attorney general's investigators that he thought Elder had 
loaned Grivas to him to help his transition into office, as other state 
employees had been assigned to do. 
</P>
<P>
One source familiar with the case who asked not to be identified said that 
because of the conflicting versions of events, prosecutors could not prove that 
Grivas had failed to work the required 40 hours a week for the state. 
</P>
<P>
The source also said the probe showed that Elder "may have been a lousy 
manager," but he "can't be prosecuted for that." 
</P>
<P>
One hurdle faced by agents during the investigation was that some key details 
about the lawmaker were provided by a confidential informant, whose comments 
were relayed by a go-between employed by the attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
In one conversation reported in a weekly case summary by Special Agent Phil 
Yee, Elder allegedly acknowledged to the unnamed informant "that Susan was 
supposed to be working for him but in reality was working for Davis." 
</P>
<P>
But investigators were unable to corroborate that allegation.

MAN SOUGHT IN KIDNAP, ASSAULT OF EX-GIRLFRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police are looking for a former USC football player who they say kidnaped and 
beat his ex-girlfriend a day after he was freed on bail on a previous charge of 
assaulting her. 
</P>
<P>
An arrest warrant has been issued for Jeff Maree, 25, who has not been seen 
since he released Laura Zovitch, 20, in front of a Torrance restaurant May 8, 
said Manhattan Beach Police Detective Fred McKewen. 
</P>
<P>
Maree abducted Zovitch at gunpoint May 7 in Manhattan Beach and drove her to 
Tijuana before releasing her the next day, McKewen said. Along the way, police 
said, Maree punched Zovitch so hard that she lost both of her front teeth. 
</P>
<P>
Zovitch ended her relationship of more than two years with Maree several months 
ago because of his alleged abusive behavior, McKewen said. 
</P>
<P>
Zovitch spent the night of May 6 with a friend in Manhattan Beach after 
learning that a South Bay Municipal Court judge had lowered Maree's bail and 
that he had been released from jail. 
</P>
<P>
When Zovitch left the friend's house at 7:30 a.m., she found Maree crouched in 
the back seat of her car with a pistol, McKewen said. 
</P>
<P>
Maree forced Zovitch into her car before switching to his own car a few blocks 
away, McKewen said. 
</P>
<P>
Zovitch later told detectives that she suggested that the two drive to Tijuana 
because she thought that when they crossed into Mexico she would be able to 
alert border guards. 
</P>
<P>
But the guards merely waved Maree and Zovitch across the border. After several 
hours in Tijuana -- during which a dentist pulled Zovitch's dangling front 
teeth -- the Redondo Beach woman was able to convince Maree that he would be in 
less trouble with the police if he let her go, McKewen said. 
</P>
<P>
Zovitch was let free on Hawthorne Boulevard in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Maree was charged with assault and battery for an alleged March 11 
encounter with Zovitch at the apartment the couple once shared on Catalina 
Avenue in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Maree, a reserve defensive back at USC from 1985 to 1987, came to the apartment 
at 8:30 that night and the two argued, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Diana Teran. The 
5-10, 185-pound athlete hit Zovitch several times, badly bruising her face and 
arms, Teran said. 
</P>
<P>
When Maree learned that charges had been filed in that case, he voluntarily 
returned from a vacation at his parents' home in New Jersey and surrendered at 
South Bay Municipal Court, said his attorney, J. Michael Flanagan. 
</P>
<P>
Maree's bail was initially set at $22,000, but on April 23 Flanagan asked South 
Bay Municipal Judge Thomas P. Allen Jr. to release his client on his own 
recognizance. Flanagan said that Maree had shown his good faith by riding a bus 
for five days from New Jersey to turn himself in. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutor Teran asked the judge not to alter the bail until a report was 
prepared by the county Probation Department on Maree's suitability for release. 
</P>
<P>
Allen refused to order the report, instead setting Maree's bail at $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
Allen said Wednesday that he had lowered the bail because Flanagan made a good 
case that Maree would return to court. The judge said he could not comment 
further because the case is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
Maree posted the reduced bail and was released from the men's Central Jail in 
downtown Los Angeles on May 6, the day before the second alleged attack on 
Zovitch. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan said he has no idea where Maree is or whether he will appear for his 
preliminary hearing in the first battery case, which is scheduled for 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, while he was still enrolled at USC, Maree was arrested for allegedly 
kidnaping another girlfriend. The victim in that case was released unharmed 
after Maree drove her from El Monte to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Maree pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of false imprisonment in that case and 
was sentenced to three years probation.

OFFICIAL PROPOSES TREE PROTECTION LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SEARLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Ventura city councilman has proposed an ordinance that would protect trees on 
private property after learning that a developer uprooted 15 eucalyptus trees 
on the east side of the city. 
</P>
<P>
But City Arborist Jerry Revard isn't sure that such a law is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"I can unequivocally say I support our policies in preserving significant trees 
. . ." Revard said Wednesday, "but the laws that are already in place may be 
sufficient if they're properly enforced." 
</P>
<P>
Trees on public property are protected from destruction, since they are the 
property of the city or county in which they are located, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Gary Tuttle, supported by other council members, asked City Atty. 
Pete Bulens to draft the tree-protection ordinance after learning that a 
housing developer, Cherrie Construction Co., had uprooted 15 eucalyptus trees 
near the Harmon Barranca. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Fish and Game, which has jurisdiction over trees and 
foliage in the barranca, is investigating the case. Krishan Lal, a projects 
review coordinator with the department, said criminal charges could be filed 
against the company for destroying the trees without a permit, though 
restitution agreements are often reached. 
</P>
<P>
Executives of the construction firm did not return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle, considered a leading environmentalist on the council, said, "I'm not 
looking to make it impossible to ever remove a tree, but I feel City Hall 
should be alerted when somebody is planning to do so. A tree is a thing of 
beauty; it even helps our health by providing oxygen." 
</P>
<P>
The destroyed trees, Tuttle said, provided shelter to red fox, owls and "even a 
buck deer." He added that monarch butterflies were also known to visit the 
area, west of Kimball Road between Foothill and Telegraph roads. 
</P>
<P>
Bulens said he probably will draft a law similar to one that is in force in 
Mountain View, where he formerly served as city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The council will consider the ordinance sometime this summer, Bulens said. 
</P>
<P>
In Thousand Oaks, which has a tree-preservation law that is often cited as a 
model, the city's forester, Bill Elmendorf, said an ordinance protecting oak 
trees has been in effect since 1972. JACK SEARLES

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NO ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW OF ARTS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Torrance officials decided Wednesday that a complete environmental review of 
the city's Cultural Arts Center is not needed, despite a lawsuit demanding that 
they conduct one. 
</P>
<P>
The five city staff members who make up the Environmental Review Board voted 
unanimously that an agreement to share parking with Epson Inc., which is 
completing its headquarters just north of the future arts center, resolves any 
environmental problems that the arts project might cause. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for developer Jerry Conrow, whose March lawsuit demanded the full 
environmental report, argued that the staff had not properly studied the impact 
of parking, traffic and noise on the $12.2-million arts complex. 
</P>
<P>
Conrow had hoped to stop construction of the project, which broke ground in 
February, because the city late last year created strict new parking 
regulations that prevented him from leasing one of his office buildings for use 
by the Torrance Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
He argued that the city's project should have to meet the same strict standards 
as private buildings do. 
</P>
<P>
The review board's decision can be appealed to the full City Council, Planner 
Jeffery Gibson said.

SUNSET HILLS PROPONENTS UNFAZED BY PREDICTIONS CITY WOULD FACE DEFICIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A state report predicts that the proposed city of Sunset Hills would face 
budget deficits immediately after incorporation, but a key cityhood supporter 
said the study is still encouraging news to residents hoping to create another 
new city in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The report, released Tuesday, said Sunset Hills, located west of the city of 
Santa Clarita, would accrue yearly budget deficits ranging from $275,000 to 
nearly $500,000 during the first four years of cityhood. But those deficits 
would be relatively minor compared to projected deficits for other new cities 
such as Santa Clarita, Ernest Dynda, a cityhood proponent, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The report was prepared by the Local Agency Formation Commission, or LAFCO, 
which oversees annexations and incorporations. 
</P>
<P>
Dynda had not read the complete report but said the small size of projected 
deficits could bode well for Sunset Hills. "It sounds good," he said. But he 
added that the report raises more questions than it answers. 
</P>
<P>
The only certainty Wednesday was that the city of Santa Clarita will oppose 
incorporation because it hopes to annex the area. Mayor Jo Anne Darcy pledged 
to fight the Sunset Hills cityhood effort. 
</P>
<P>
Sunset Hills would cover 27.8 square miles west of the Golden State Freeway and 
south of California 126, including Six Flags Magic Mountain and the Stevenson 
Ranch development under construction by the Dale Poe Development Co. 
</P>
<P>
The area has an estimated 1,701 residents and could have 2,264 by 1993, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Stevenson, a Dale Poe vice president, and Dynda, a former Poe consultant 
and Agoura Hills city councilman, are leading the cityhood drive. Some critics 
have derisively dubbed the area "Poe-dunk." 
</P>
<P>
Darcy said projected deficits for Sunset Hills seemed unusually low. "I thought 
it would be in the millions," Darcy said. 
</P>
<P>
When Santa Clarita incorporated two years ago, for example, LAFCO projected 
that the first-year deficit would be $3.5 million, Darcy said. LAFCO approved 
letting residents vote on Santa Clarita incorporation despite the projected 
deficit. As it turned out, the city had a $2.5-million surplus in its first 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The fiscal report released Tuesday does not endorse or oppose cityhood for 
Sunset Hills. Instead, it outlines the potential revenues and expenses of the 
proposed city. The commission is scheduled to hold a hearing on the cityhood 
proposal June 27. 
</P>
<P>
LAFCO officials were out of town at a conference Wednesday and could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clarita asked LAFCO last year to include the Sunset Hills area in its 
"sphere of influence," thus making the area eligible for annexation to the 
city. LAFCO turned down the request, citing the incorporation effort launched 
by Dynda and Stevenson. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed city would include Six Flags Magic Mountain and property owned by 
Newhall Land and Farming Co. but both companies have said they do not want to 
be included in Sunset Hills.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HEARING SET ON PRIVATE STREET PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rancho Palos Verdes City Council on Tuesday agreed to hold a public hearing 
on a request to convert several public streets to private ways by residents who 
live in a neighborhood at the city's highest point. 
</P>
<P>
The residents, who say the views and vacant lots in their tract of expensive 
luxury homes are an "attractive nuisance," have asked for private streets many 
times in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
There has been a lot of litter and reports of vandalism in the neighborhood on 
San Pedro Hill, city officials said. The council set the hearing for July 17, 
but indicated that while it might limit vehicle traffic through the 
development, it would not cut off other public access to the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The development is off of Crest Road and includes Paseo de Pino and Paseo de 
Castana.

FRIENDS OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD DECRY RECENT DISRUPTIONS OF THEIR MEETINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent efforts to disrupt a peaceful meeting of South Bay Friends of 
Planned Parenthood/Los Angeles (May 8) are a tragic commentary on the 
unwillingness of anti-choice forces to allow rational and calm discussion of 
issues related to choice. These disruptive actions strike at the very heart of 
every American's right of free speech and freedom of assembly. 
</P>
<P>
A small but vocal minority of Catholic activists, led by members of St. 
Lawrence Martyr Church in Redondo Beach, exerted enormous pressure on the owner 
of the facility where our meeting was scheduled. Threats against the owner and 
his employees caused the owner to fear for the economic future of his business. 
Planned Parenthood has no desire to harm any business enterprise and we 
voluntarily agreed to move our meeting site. 
</P>
<P>
Unsatisfied, this radical group attacked HomeFed in Redondo Beach, where we 
rescheduled the meeting in the community room. That organization caved in 
quickly to the pressure of threatening telephone calls. Planned Parenthood 
regrets any inconvenience we may have caused the bank. We believe, however, 
(that) every individual and corporate entity has an obligation to support the 
right of free speech and freedom of assembly in America. 
</P>
<P>
What the protesters fail to understand is that Planned Parenthood is committed 
to low-cost family planning services and reproductive health care for both men 
and women. Ninety-two percent of the organization's budget is devoted to 
education and the prevention of unwanted pregnancies. We are particularly 
concerned about the epidemic of teen-age pregnancies in our community and 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
The South Bay Friends of Planned Parenthood/Los Angeles are outraged by the 
actions of those who would prevent the free exchange of ideas. Fear, 
intimidation and closed minds are dangerous in a democratic society. We are 
committed to continuing our schedule of meetings that provide a valuable source 
of information to the community, presented in a thoughtful and intelligent 
manner.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VICTIM OF ALZHEIMER'S DROWNS IN HOME POOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 81-year-old North Hollywood woman suffering from Alzheimer's disease 
accidentally drowned when she apparently fell into a back-yard swimming pool, 
Los Angeles police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis O'Shea was found at 10 p.m. Tuesday in the pool behind her home in the 
11500 block of Hamlin Street, Lt. Ron LaRue said. It was unknown how long she 
had been in the pool. She lived alone at the home and was found by a caretaker 
who lived in another house on the property. 
</P>
<P>
Because O'Shea suffered from the mentally debilitating disease and there was no 
sign of trauma on her body, police ruled her death an accident, LaRue said.

THANKS IN TIME OF TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We, the parents of David Dufau, whose capsized catamaran was found April 27 off 
the coast of Anacapa Island, have a heartfelt need to say thank you. 
</P>
<P>
We know that the Harbor Patrol and the Coast Guard conducted an enormous search 
with the utmost professional expertise. 
</P>
<P>
We know there were numberless friends, acquaintances and others who had never 
met David, who generously used their boats and their time to join in the 
search. All of you seemed to realize that "the only gift is a portion of 
thyself." 
</P>
<P>
You gave! We thank all of you for that gift. 
</P>
<P>
The members of the press have been particularly thoughtful and considerate of 
our family. 
</P>
<P>
We appreciate sincerely all that has been done.

CONFLICTS SURFACE IN COMPTON AS LATINO POPULATION INCREASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the May 7 edition of The Times, two articles focused on minorities in 
politics. One was general, analyzing barriers to electoral politics, the other 
specific, contrasting black and Latino political strength in Compton. 
</P>
<P>
Yet neither article addressed the complex impact that housing discrimination 
has on political power. Entrenched patterns of segregation have operated to 
limit the political power of minorities. 
</P>
<P>
The term "block-busting" referred to in the article on Compton does not 
describe the ruse minorities have had to resort to in order to purchase 
property. On the contrary, block-busting is an insidious illegal practice real 
estate agents have used to stimulate business by preying on racial prejudices. 
Rumors that minorities are moving into a neighborhood en masse are spread, 
whipping up racial hysteria, and causing a flurry of sales. Federal law has 
outlawed block-busting since 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, blacks may enjoy greater political power than Latinos in Compton and 
statewide. Yet the advantage is relative. Segregation relegates both groups to 
designated pockets of communities, and pits them against one another. Before we 
criticize the state of affirmative action in Compton, perhaps we should 
evaluate the record of affirmative action and representative politics in 
communities where both blacks and Latinos are in the minority -- such as Los 
Angeles. Hopefully, both groups can come together in Compton.

IMPROVING POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Election day is bearing down on us. Is it possible that we voters are really 
such ninnies as the politicians tell us we are? If you contribute to a party or 
candidate, thereafter every mail will bring you one or more requests for 
immediate further contributions if you are to save the candidate or the party. 
</P>
<P>
The reason, they say, is that the candidates that spend the most money are 
always the winners. Not worthiness of election, but dollars, win. 
</P>
<P>
We often express unhappiness about our knee-jerk Congress that foresees nothing 
and second-guesses everything. Yet we are told that 98% of the incumbents win, 
and will again unless we send dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Are we voters really that simple-minded? Why don't we just vote the rascals out 
and get a fresh start? I will if you will.

Overview 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Assemblyman Burt Margolin, a Democrat, is strongly favored in the 
general election. His opponents have targeted his close ties to the 
Berman/Waxman organization, a powerful Westside-area political group headed by 
Reps. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) and Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles). 
The Republican primary has focused on the candidates' opposing views on 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Contenders 
</P>
<P>
Robert K. Davis, 45, a West Hollywood Republican, is a swimming pool contractor 
and former teacher who ran for the West Hollywood City Council in April. He is 
endorsed by the California Republican League and the Republicans' Gay and 
Lesbian Task Force. Davis' campaign has stressed getting out the vote, abortion 
rights and expanding the Republican Party to include more minorities. He holds 
a BA degree in social science from the State College of Iowa, and an MA in 
history from the University of Iowa. He is single. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Michael, 33, a Los Angeles Republican, is an accounting and marketing 
consultant for small businesses. She ran unsuccessfully in the Republican 
primary for Sen. David Roberti's seat in the 23rd District two years ago. She 
is endorsed by the California Republican Assembly, and her campaign has focused 
on her opposition to gun control, abortion and malathion spraying. She received 
a BS degree in economics from the Wharton School of the University of 
Pennsylvania. She is single. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Burt Margolin, a Los Angeles Democrat, and Owen Staley, a Peace and 
Freedom candidate, are unopposed in their primaries. 
</P>
<P>
Questionnaire 
</P>
<P>
Questionnaires were distributed to candidates and were returned this month. 
Answers have been edited to fit the available space. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Under recently introduced legislation, state sales taxes would be raised 
0.25% for 10 years to help finance school construction. Do you favor an 
increase in sales taxes to underwrite new school construction? 
</P>
<P>
Davis: No. 
</P>
<P>
Michael: No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. An initiative measure on the June ballot would raise taxes on gasoline sales 
by 9 cents a gallon to finance highway projects. Do you support the concept of 
higher gas taxes to underwrite road construction? 
</P>
<P>
Davis: No, not supporting Prop. 111. Supports concept of gas tax for road 
repair. 
</P>
<P>
Michael: No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support a woman's unrestricted right to an abortion within the first 
three months of pregnancy? 
</P>
<P>
Davis: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Michael: No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support capital punishment? 
</P>
<P>
Davis: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Michael: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support the idea of breaking up the Los Angeles Unified School 
District into smaller districts? 
</P>
<P>
Davis: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Michael: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Under current law, the state Legislature is responsible for redrawing state 
legislative and congressional district boundaries. Do you believe this system 
should be changed? 
</P>
<P>
Davis: Yes. Present ills are due to a stalemated political system; 
reapportionment is a key to ending this. 
</P>
<P>
Michael: Yes. I support Prop. 119, which puts redistricting in the hands of a 
citizens committee . . . instead of a corrupt legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support the so-called "Big Green" ballot initiative, which would 
eliminate ozone-depleting chemicals by the year 2000, phase out pesticides 
known to cause cancer and require that trees be planted in all new 
developments? 
</P>
<P>
Davis: No. 
</P>
<P>
Michael: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you think the state should require private employers to subsidize 
day-care services for employees who request them? 
</P>
<P>
Davis: No. This is being worked out by employers. Would discourage employment. 
</P>
<P>
Michael: No. Good business, but should not be forced. Supports tax credit 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support the state's efforts to build prisons in Lancaster and East 
Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
Davis: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Michael: No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 112 on the June ballot would ban speaking fees and limit gifts 
to state legislators while creating a commission that could pave the way for 
higher legislative salaries. Do you support this ballot initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Davis: No. Prefers speaker fees to a pay raise. No pay raise for a job poorly 
done. 
</P>
<P>
Michael: Undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support Gov. Deukmejian's proposed constitutional changes that would 
require state prison inmates to work in privately sponsored industries to pay 
for their incarceration? 
</P>
<P>
Davis: Yes, but I'm not sure it will work. 
</P>
<P>
Michael: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you believe our present system of criminal prosecution, interdiction of 
supplies and imprisonment of users and dealers will ever significantly reduce 
the level of drug use in the United States? 
</P>
<P>
If no, what should be done? 
</P>
<P>
Davis: No. Only diminished demand will work. Best action is publicizing results 
of drug use. 
</P>
<P>
Michael: No. Education is key, and without God we will never solve society's 
drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Would you consider the possibility of decriminalizing the use of drugs? 
</P>
<P>
Davis: No answer given. 
</P>
<P>
Michael: No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support raising sales or other taxes to finance anti-drug law 
enforcement efforts and/or anti-drug education programs? 
</P>
<P>
If yes, by how much? 
</P>
<P>
Davis: No. 
</P>
<P>
Michael: No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support full or partial public funding of political campaigns? 
</P>
<P>
Davis: No. Never read a proposal that seems workable. Also, we don't have the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Michael: No. The public should not be forced to finance campaigns they disagree 
with. 
</P>
<P>
Q. A ballot initiative now in circulation would prohibit foreign individuals 
and corporations from owning land in California. Do you support this? 
</P>
<P>
Davis: No. 
</P>
<P>
Michael: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Rising property values in the Santa Monica Mountains have made it more 
difficult for state and federal parks agencies to buy land for public use. Land 
prices have escalated in part because local officials have allowed developers 
to build more houses than provided for under zoning laws. To keep property 
prices more affordable to parks agencies, should governments in Los Angeles and 
Ventura counties refuse such so-called "upzoning?" 
</P>
<P>
Davis: No. An inherent conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Michael: No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are you willing to publicly release your tax returns and those of your 
spouse before the election? 
</P>
<P>
Davis: No. It's an invasion of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Michael: No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. A development project called Porter Ranch would create 3,395 residential 
units and nearly 6 million square feet of commercial office space in the 
Chatsworth hills. Opponents say it is too big. Proponents say it represents 
orderly growth. Do you support the project at this size? 
</P>
<P>
Davis: Undecided. Based on newspaper reports, I would probably support it. 
</P>
<P>
Michael: No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support limits on the number of terms state legislators can serve? 
</P>
<P>
If yes, how long should they be? 
</P>
<P>
Davis: Yes. Assembly, three terms; Senate, two terms. 
</P>
<P>
Michael: Yes. Assembly, four terms; Senate, two terms. 
</P>
<P>
Q. A ballot initiative now in circulation would prohibit the spraying of 
pesticides on private property without the written consent of the owner. Do you 
support this measure? 
</P>
<P>
Davis: Yes, a welcome reassertion of property rights. 
</P>
<P>
Michael: Yes. I oppose malathion spraying.

tax on the trinkets they brought home from foreign trips. The public cry of 
anguish led the board not only to halt the practice, but to order all payments 
refunded. Not good enough for Bennett. He went to court and had the board's 
action stayed. He hopes the courts permanently prevent the refunds. "Ignorance 
of the law is no excuse," he says. I think he tripped himself up.

PROP. 107: THE FEDS WON'T DO IT, SO WE SHOULD -- VOTE YES FOR HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As many as 250,000 Californians are homeless. A growing number -- at least a 
quarter -- are mothers and children in search of affordable housing. They need 
help. Proposition 107 on the June 5 ballot would provide it. 
</P>
<P>
The Housing and Homeless Bond Act would authorize $150 million in general 
obligation bonds to provide 5,560 additional beds in emergency shelters and 
transitional housing. And that is just the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
The bond measure would also finance the renovation of 12,000 apartments and the 
construction of 4,000 units designated for low-income senior citizens, disabled 
adults who have special needs and the working poor. 
</P>
<P>
The state must shoulder these varied housing burdens because the federal 
government no longer does the job. California has the largest shortage of 
affordable rental housing in the nation. Apartments that rent for $400 or less 
are difficult to find in most urban regions. The shortage is especially severe 
in Los Angeles. It forces hard-working families to set up housekeeping in 
unimproved garages or unsafe tenements. The scarcity also forces poor mothers 
and children to double up with relatives or camp out in battered cars. Equally 
hard hit are elderly men and women on fixed incomes who can afford to spend no 
more than $200 on housing. 
</P>
<P>
Homeless men have the toughest time finding shelter. Many simply cannot 
function; they drink, use drugs and are mentally ill. Others, however, are 
capable of living decently if they can find a room in a safe and sanitary 
single-residency hotel. The lack of such rooms forces poor men to curl up in 
squalid doorways, sleep in cardboard boxes under freeways and stretch out on 
sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
Emergency shelters provide a temporary solution, but night after night there's 
no room at the inn. As many as 1,800 homeless men are turned away nightly at 
shelters in Los Angeles County. That unfortunate scenario is repeated in other 
counties. There is an urgent need for more beds in temporary shelters. 
</P>
<P>
But, in the long run, the best remedy for homelessness is a lot more affordable 
rental housing. Proposition 107 would help homeless people, and impoverished 
tenants. It would also help 4,000 first-time home buyers, primarily young 
families and veterans, to purchase a house -- no mean feat in most California 
markets. This needed measure offers other benefits as well that would stimulate 
jobs and new local revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, the bond measure would provide a decent and affordable place to 
live for thousands of Californians. Vote Yes on June 5.

IMPROVING POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If both parties want to reform campaign financing and coverage (front page, May 
7), the solution is simple. Since almost every dollar is spent on advertising, 
prohibit political advertising. 
</P>
<P>
It's not needed and, if the goal is to turn out the voters, it's a miserable 
failure. The higher the spending, the lower the voter turnout. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has never advertised in the U.S. but his name, face and ideas are 
universally known. 
</P>
<P>
That may be the secret -- ideas. If candidates stop selling themselves like 
soap and breakfast cereal, they would have to command attention with substance 
instead of production values. 
</P>
<P>
If their ideas are compelling and plentiful enough, their day-to-day coverage 
would increase in ratio as would their TV guest appearances, debate 
invitations, and commentary page articles. Their personal exposure to the 
voters would come with innovative barnstorming enhanced -- if their ideas are 
newsworthy enough -- by regional exposure on television and newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Campaigns could be run at a fraction of today's costs. All it takes is a ban on 
political advertising and insistence by the media for legitimate news instead 
of "photo ops." Who knows, voters might start voting again. 
</P>
<P>
One problem: How do you get the media to back an advertising ban?

CEMENT PLANT NEIGHBORS ATTACK EMISSIONS STUDY AS BEING PSEUDOSCIENTIFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Environmental activists and neighbors of a cement plant Wednesday blasted a 
report to state health officials, commissioned by the plant's owners, which 
concluded that burning hazardous waste as fuel at the plant near Gorman does 
not endanger people or the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the state Department of Health Services held a hearing Wednesday 
in Lancaster to gather public comment on the study commissioned by the National 
Cement Co. of California. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the department's toxic control program said the report -- 
required under the terms of an agreement with the state -- was received about 
two weeks ago and their review should be complete in about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Residents blame emissions from the plant for health problems experienced by 
people in the northern Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Critics called the report on the National Cement plant by Ebasco and 
Associates, a consulting firm, inadequate and "pseudoscientific." They were 
particularly critical of the report's conclusions that burning hazardous waste 
as fuel is slightly less dangerous than burning other fuels and that the risk 
posed by emissions decreases as the amount of hazardous waste burned increases. 
Long exposure to high temperatures in the cement-making process breaks down the 
toxins, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fallacy," said Helen Thornburgh, a leader of residents opposed to the 
toxic waste incineration. "It's like saying the more you smoke, the less 
harmful it is." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Greenpeace, the international environmental group, issued a 
statement saying, "The assessment considers only a tiny fraction of the 
pollution and health risks caused by burning wastes in the kiln." 
</P>
<P>
National Cement President Don Unmacht defended the report. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that it was a very thorough test of emissions," he said. "We hope that 
the state finds that this is sound technology to be used by our society and 
that we be allowed to continue as before." 
</P>
<P>
Val Siebal, regional administrator for the state toxic control program, said 
the finding that risk decreases as the amount of hazardous waste increases was 
"not something I can support right now." 
</P>
<P>
But he said he could not comment further until the end of the review process. 
</P>
<P>
The plant has been fined a total of $450,000 in the past year by state and Kern 
County air quality officials for burning more hazardous waste as fuel than it 
was licensed to use. As part of the accompanying settlement with state health 
officials, the company agreed to commission the report. 
</P>
<P>
While the report is being analyzed, National Cement officials agreed to reduce 
the level of waste burned from 1,200 gallons per hour -- the amount allowed 
under the firm's state permit -- to 650 gallons per hour, or from about 40% to 
about 25% of the fuel used. 
</P>
<P>
If the company study is approved, state officials will permit the company to 
return to the higher level of toxic waste burning, Siebal said. If not, 
officials may require further study and ultimately may decide that the company 
should hold to the present limits or reduce the amount even more.

DISSECTING THE BUNION STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iread The Times' article in the April 24 Valley section about a podiatrist 
named Dr. Garey Weber with shock and dismay. 
</P>
<P>
Weber removed three bunions from my feet last December in a most professional 
and efficient manner. Within three months I was able to play tennis up to three 
hours a day with no problems. 
</P>
<P>
I believe that the reporting was irresponsible. The article quotes James 
Rathlesberger (executive officer of the state Board of Podiatric Medicine) 
saying that "one of the most significant terms in the settlement was Weber's 
agreement to stop performing the 'Weber bunionectomy.' " Later in the article 
it indicates that Weber has not stopped performing the surgeries but only 
altered the location of his bone cuts less than one inch. How can this 
methodology possibly be "medical mayhem" if it is continuing to be performed? 
By featuring this description of the surgery, the Los Angeles Times makes Weber 
guilty. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Rathlesberger says that people are screaming in agony in Weber's 
office. I have been in the office at least 30 times and always found a calm, 
friendly and professional medical atmosphere. His claim is patently absurd. 
</P>
<P>
Rathlesberger also relates that Weber, in effect, breaks people's toes and then 
asks them to walk on them in great pain. This simply is not true. The article 
states that "patients who have pins inserted normally are bedridden and do not 
walk for days or weeks." Conventional bunion surgery does involve a pin -- but 
not bed. People haven't been put in a bed for bunions for years. People with 
pins walk out of the office in a cast, with the assistance of crutches. Weber's 
patients walk out of the office with a bandaged foot in an orthopedic shoe and 
do not need the assistance of crutches. They are able to drive immediately and 
conduct their lives normally. Recovery is fast, bones heel quickly, and the 
chance for complications is reduced. 
</P>
<P>
I acknowledge that most of my complaints are with Rathlesberger's comments. 
However, Cheevers features these comments and presents them as facts. Although 
the Medical Board of California did not find Weber guilty, anyone reading the 
article would assume that he is. In my opinion, The Los Angeles Times has 
responsibility to print facts. Printing mistruths, lies and damaging 
descriptions simply because someone says them does not absolve The Times.

HIGH-SPEED RAILROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your (May 4) article "High-Speed Rail Access Near Interstates Sought" describes 
an apparently economical method to encourage high-speed railroad construction. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government itself established a precedent for this during the 19th 
Century by providing land grants to private-sector railroads for thousands of 
miles of rights of way in order to encourage railroad construction. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, providing a right of way along a freeway will doom a 300-m.p.h. 
train to operate not much faster than cars on the freeway -- less than 100 
m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The same laws of physics that apply to Southern California automobiles also 
will apply to French, German or Japanese high-speed trains. If the high-speed 
train operates much faster than freeway speed on freeway-style curves and 
hills, the train ticket from Anaheim to Las Vegas will read "E-Ticket."

MORNING BRIEFING: HE COULDN'T EAT WORDS, SO THIS WAS NEXT BEST

Times columnist Mike Downey will be eating tortillas for the rest of his life 
if fans of the Phoenix Suns have their way. Wednesday, after the Suns beat the 
Lakers to win their Western Conference semifinal series, Downey received a box 
of 300 tortillas from Beth McDonald and Perry Damone, morning hosts of Phoenix 
radio station KEZ. 
</P>
<P>
The accompanying letter stated, in part: "Please accept this gift as a token of 
our appreciation. The newspaper article in which you predicted that the Suns 
would 'fold like a tortilla' was just what we needed. . . . We're not sure what 
you'll do with 300 tortillas. . . . Our listeners have suggested that perhaps 
you could put them where 'the SUNS don't shine.' " 
</P>
<P>
A moment of silence: Here's part of what Downey wrote May 9, after Phoenix beat 
the Lakers in Game 1: 
</P>
<P>
"Of the eight clubs remaining in the running for the NBA championship, seven 
can win it. Phoenix can't. Sorry. Never happen. Phoerget it. 
</P>
<P>
"So, don't sweat Tuesday night's 104-102 Laker loss at the Forum: These are the 
playoffs. Phoenix will fold like a tortilla." 
</P>
<P>
Just the fax: Downey said he has received at least 100 derogatory and somewhat 
humorous faxes from Phoenix fans, and they are still coming. "I must have 
refried beans for brains," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Hot item: The St. Petersburg Times reported that while there is talk of housing 
an NHL expansion team at the Florida Suncoast Dome, management at the Bayfront 
Center can't even keep the ice frozen for an old-timers' tournament. 
</P>
<P>
After the completion of four games, the ice had melted down to the cement in 
several spots and was thin in the middle of the rink. One player injured his 
knee when he slipped and fell. Needless to say, 24 scheduled games were 
canceled. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Which was the last Western Conference team, besides the Lakers, to 
win the NBA championship? 
</P>
<P>
The Forbidden City: Beijing will be closed to people from the Chinese provinces 
during the Asian Games in September. Officials say the measures are to avoid 
traffic jams, but observers believe it is to prevent trouble from dissidents 
after last spring's protests in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Beijing vice mayor Zhang Baifa said passes will be issued to selected people 
from the provinces to allow them to watch the games. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The Seattle SuperSonics, in 1978-79.

Sixth-seeded Debbie Graham of Stanford swept past teammate and defending 
champion Sandra Birch, 7-5, 6-4, Wednesday to move into today's final of the 
NCAA women's championships at Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Graham, a sophomore from Fountain Valley, will face seventh-seeded Nicole 
Arendt of Florida, who rallied to defeat unseeded Eveline Hamers of Kansas, 6-7 
(7-1), 6-4, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Graham and Birch played a match comparable to their Pacific 10 championship 
duel won last month by Graham. Graham used her big serve and powerful ground 
strokes in winning her second consecutive straight-set victory over Birch. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I might have wanted it a little bit more," Graham said. "I've been 
working really hard. This has been one of my goals this year, to do really well 
in this tournament. I just went for it." 
</P>
<P>
Graham and Birch later teamed up to advance to the doubles final. Graham and 
Birch moved into the final with victories over teams from Florida (by default) 
and Georgia (6-3, 6-3). 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Brad Gilbert led three Americans into the third round of the Italian 
Open with a 7-6 (7-5), 6-4 victory over Luis Mattar of Brazil on the clay 
courts in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
Also advancing to the round of 16 were second-seeded Aaron Krickstein, who 
defeated Karel Novacek of Czechoslovakia, 6-2, 6-2, and ninth-seeded Jim 
Courier, who beat Jaime Yzaga of Peru, 6-3, 6-4. 
</P>

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
How could a team fall from 63-19 in the regular season to 4-5 in the playoffs? 
. . . That's something the Lakers will be pondering during their longest summer 
vacation since 1981. . . . 
</P>
<P>
But their attention should be focused on the future. The sayers of doom are 
convinced that the dominant NBA franchise of the 1980s is on its way to 
becoming the flop of the '90s. I say wait, not so fast. . . . The Lakers could 
be improved next season if Jerry Buss puts out the cash to land Sam Perkins, 
the talented free-agent forward from Dallas. Vlade Divac will help fill that 
hole in the middle after more experience, work in the weight room and 
instruction. James Worthy can't possibly have another two games as bad as his 
last two in the Phoenix series. And, most important, Magic Johnson shows no 
signs of slowing down. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that most of the rest of the Western Conference is getting 
stronger. Phoenix, San Antonio, Portland and Utah already are formidable. And 
even the Clippers are only an injury-free season away from respectability. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
What the Lakers need is a little optimism like that provided by center Ray 
Felix after Los Angeles was beaten by the Celtics at Boston Garden in overtime 
of the seventh game of the 1962 NBA finals. "Don't worry, baby," Felix said. 
"We'll get 'em tomorrow." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Some of the same people who ripped Pat Riley for resting the varsity against 
Portland the final night of the regular season are saying his practices before 
the Phoenix series were too tough. . . . 
</P>
<P>
And the players who grumbled about Riley this year are the same ones who 
grumbled about him during the championship years. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix -- young, talented and on a roll -- figures to beat either Portland or 
San Antonio in the Western Conference finals. . . . 
</P>
<P>
So emotional during most of the series, the Suns wisely didn't go nuts after 
putting away the Lakers Tuesday at the Forum. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Look-alikes: Tom Chambers and Woody (Cheers) Harrelson. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Whom haven't the Clippers talked with about their coaching vacancy? . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers' won-loss record isn't deceiving. They have .500 written all over 
them. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Cecil Fielder file: He's only 26. He played on the same Nogales High 
football team in La Puente with Mark Salas, a Detroit Tiger teammate. He says 
he weighs 240, but he looks heavier. "He'll hit 30 homers by accident," says 
Sparky Anderson. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Nick Esasky could be the next Bruce Sutter for the Atlanta Braves. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Joe Garagiola is staging the comeback of the year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Third base coaches are like offensive linemen. You only notice them when they 
do something wrong. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Rickey Henderson, who is only 31, is going to break Ty Cobb's American League 
career stolen base record any day now. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Asked about his split with Michael Nunn, manager Danny Goossen said, "Who?" . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy McKinney, the bantamweight gold medalist in the 1988 Olympic Games who 
has been trying to kick a drug habit, will continue his comeback May 29 at the 
Country Club in Reseda against Luis Hernandez in a six-rounder. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Azumah Nelson is too good a fighter to be a 4-1 underdog to Pernell Whitaker 
Saturday night at Caesars Palace. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I didn't think Mike Tyson would beat Buster Douglas back into the ring. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Isn't it about time to tear down Boston Garden? . . . 
</P>
<P>
The only skater who wasn't overworked during the Edmonton-Boston game Tuesday 
night and Wednesday morning was referee Don Koharski, who didn't call a penalty 
from 14:38 of the second period to 2:41 of the third overtime. . . . 
</P>
<P>
With Larry Johnson and Stacey Augmon coming back -- and several prominent high 
school and junior college players on the way in -- only probation could keep 
Nevada Las Vegas from being a prohibitive choice to repeat as NCAA basketball 
champion. . . . 
</P>
<P>
CBS can't be happy about the Lakers and Boston Celtics being eliminated from 
the playoffs so early. The network's rooting interest is now in the Chicago 
Bulls. Michael Jordan against anybody would mean high ratings for the finals. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
When the Minneapolis Lakers won their first NBA title in 1949, the final game 
of the championship series with Washington was played on April 13. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled probably doesn't have the versatility to win the Triple Crown. Look 
for Mister Frisky to come back from his Kentucky Derby disappointment to win 
the Preakness.

PIPPEN RETURNS, HELPS SEND 76ERS HOME; 
</P>
<P>
EASTERN CONFERENCE: AFTER MOURNING HIS FATHER, HE SCORES 29 POINTS AND JORDAN 
HAS 37 AS THE BULLS FINISH OFF PHILADELPHIA, 117-99. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All two days off did was create false hope for the Philadelphia 76ers, not 
rejuvenate them. 
</P>
<P>
All the extra time did for Scottie Pippen was allow him a few more days to 
mourn his father. 
</P>
<P>
But when it came time to play basketball again Wednesday night, nothing had 
changed. The Chicago Bulls, lifted by the return of Pippen and the typical 
above-mere-mortal play of Michael Jordan, finished off the Philadelphia 76ers, 
117-99, at Chicago Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
By winning the series, four games to one, the Bulls earned a trip to the 
Eastern Conference finals, beginning Sunday at Auburn Hills, Mich. For the 
second consecutive year, they will play the Detroit Pistons, defending NBA 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
If Game 5 seemed special to Chicago, Pippen made the circumstances seem 
regular-season by comparison. This was the first time he was with teammates in 
four days, having missed Sunday's game in Philadelphia in order to return to 
Arkansas for the funeral of his father, who died Saturday after a lengthy 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
Pippen, an all-star who was averaging 20.6 points during the playoffs, second 
best on the Bulls behind Jordan's 40.6, went to his old high school a few times 
during the time away to shoot baskets. He said it helped. 
</P>
<P>
But what transpired Wednesday night, before 18,676, went far beyond that: 29 
points on 13-of-17 shooting and six rebounds in 37 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of a great thing," said Pippen, the youngest of 12 children. 
"There were still moments when I thought of my dad, when I tended to focus in 
on what has happened the last week. But I tried to block it out and play 
basketball." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't start, a decision Coach Phil Jackson hinted at Tuesday. But Pippen 
entered less than four minutes into the game, made seven of his first nine 
shots and rolled up 16 points and five rebounds by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan had 21 of his 37 points at intermission, but the Bulls still trailed, 
63-62. Credit an 11-4 start by the 76ers, who made 62.8% of their shots the 
first two quarters. Turned out that merely set up the obligatory second-half 
charge, Part IV, by Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls, looking for their fifth consecutive homecourt win over Philadelphia, 
didn't waste time, either. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago went to a 76-65 lead in the first 4:12 of the third quarter. A 14-2 
surge, and suddenly the other shoe had dropped. The 76ers, an obviously 
exhausted group in Game 4, were looking the part again. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, they didn't have far to go. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Mahorn was hobbling from the minute he stepped onto the court for warmups 
before the game, his left knee heavily wrapped to fight tendinitis. 
</P>
<P>
Key reserve Derek Smith did not suit up because of his own case of tendinitis, 
just as in 12 of the previous 13 games, including all five of the series. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Barkley cleared 13 rebounds, six on the offensive end, to finish with 
an average of 17 per outing against the Bulls, but his energy was waning, too. 
</P>
<P>
As much as nothing could stop Jordan from scoring, nothing, it seemed, could 
stop the 76ers from summer vacation. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is they were just a better team than us," Barkley said, adding 
Philadelphia was, in many ways, lucky to beat Cleveland in the five-game 
first-round series. "We are a good team, but we didn't have enough." 
</P>
<P>
Barkley scored only 17 points; Ron Anderson had 20 points for the 76ers, and 
Mike Gminski and Johnny Dawkins each scored 18. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls finalized that notion with an 11-4 run in the fourth quarter, 
building a 93-85 advantage into 104-89 blowout with 7:11 left. 
</P>
<P>
What Mahorn was doing dribbling the ball behind his back at the top of the key 
during that crucial stretch is anyone's guess, but Chicago didn't miss the 
opportunity to make him regret it, with B.J. Armstrong grabbing the ball in 
mid-wrap-around and lofting a long, lead pass to Pippen for a dunk. 
</P>
<P>
"We set a goal to try and win each quarter," Mahorn said. "However, it seemed 
that it never worked when we got into the third and fourth period. The Bulls 
played great defense, and that was the key throughout this series." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the fourth quarter belonged to Bulls, as it did throughout the series. 
This time, it was a 28-18 advantage. The only hint of a Philadelphia defense 
when it mattered was against Jordan. He was averaging 17 points-per fourth 
quarter but this time was held below double figures in the last 12 minutes for 
the first time in the series. 
</P>
<P>
By that time, it really didn't make much of a difference.

FISHING REPORT: BASS GET A $6,000 BITE OF LAKE CASITAS ANGLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Ventura County Bass Club's night tournament last Saturday raised an 
estimated $6,000 for habitat improvement at Lake Casitas. 
</P>
<P>
Through special permits from the Lake Casitas Municipal Water District and the 
California Department of Fish and Game, the club was able to stage the first 
nighttime tournament on the lake. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-pound 9-ounce winner was caught by Colin Waters of Susana Knoll.

SOUTHERN SECTION SOFTBALL PLAYOFFS; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTY HAS STACKED THE DECK WITH SEEDED TEAMS THIS TIME AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No Orange County softball team won a Southern Section championship last season, 
but the odds are that that will change for this year's tournament, which begins 
at 3 p.m. today in the 2-A, 3-A and 5-A divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the four seeded teams in each of the section's three largest divisions 
-- 5-A, 4-A and 3-A -- are from Orange County, so it appears that at least a 
couple of county teams will reach the championship games June 1-2 at Mayfair 
Park in Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County is perhaps most strongly represented in the 5-A, where Sunset 
League champion Marina (25-5) is the top-seeded team. The Vikings open today 
against Camarillo (16-10), which defeated San Luis Obispo, 5-1, in a wild-card 
game Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Marina is led by pitchers Willa Parchen (8-3) and Janet Miyahara (11-1), each 
of whom has more than 100 strikeouts. At the plate, Marina is led by Christa 
and Robyn Yorke. Christa, a senior catcher who bats lead-off, is batting .346; 
her sister Robyn, a freshman center fielder, is hitting a team-high .363. 
</P>
<P>
Angelus League champion Mater Dei (20-3), which has been top-ranked in the 
Orange County Softball Coaches' Poll all season, is the fourth-seeded team in 
5-A, and Fountain Valley (20-6) is seeded third. 
</P>
<P>
Marina and Mater Dei are in the same bracket and might have to play each other 
in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
But that's nothing new. Last year, Marina eliminated Mater Dei in the first 
round. And this season, Marina upset Mater Dei, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
After the loss to Marina, Mater Dei pitcher Terri Kobata was sidelined because 
of a rotator cuff injury. Mater Dei third baseman Sundy Mosqueda, a senior, is 
sidelined for the season with a dislocated thumb. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei sophomore Jennifer Clark has filled in well for Kobata, with a 13-0 
record, an 0.23 earned-run average and 88 strikeouts. Senior Jennifer 
Grootegoed has taken over at third. At the plate, sophomores Jennifer Cline 
(.314) and Amy Moeller (.327) lead the way. 
</P>
<P>
"In a sense it is devastating because they are two all-league players," Monarch 
Coach Cathy Quesnell said of Kobata and Mosqueda. "The kids who have filled in 
for them have done a great job. We'll see what happens when we get into CIF and 
under a bit more pressure than in our league." 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei will get that chance today at home against Katella (14-7), the 
third-place team from the Empire League. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley (20-6) plays hosts to Los Alamitos, the Empire League's 
second-place team. Fountain Valley has three players hitting more than .280 -- 
catcher Shannon Dolan, third baseman Jennifer Alchin and second baseman Tracy 
Werts. Junior pitcher Rae Rice (15-1) has an 0.12 ERA with 191 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
With a little luck, Cypress (22-6), the Empire League's top team, could be a 
spoiler in 5-A. Senior Beth Howard -- 19-3 with 128 strikeouts and an 0.31 ERA 
will be on the mound for the Centurions when they open at home today against 
Lompoc (18-4). 
</P>
<P>
In the 3-A division, 10 of the 32 teams are from Orange County, led by 
top-seeded El Toro, which has three talented pitchers: Paige Lauby (11-2), with 
178 strikeouts and an 0.07 ERA; Jennifer Jourden (6-2) and Marta Bickert (5-3). 
</P>
<P>
Lauby, a senior, also is El Toro's leading hitter with a .282 average. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro is at home today against University (15-10). If El Toro and 
second-seeded Irvine advance, it could be an all-South Coast League 3-A final. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine (24-3) is led by Jennifer Brundage, last year's Times' Softball Player 
of the Year. Brundage missed a couple of league games late in the season with a 
tired arm, but is healthy again, striking out 12 and giving up two hits in a 
victory over Capistrano Valley. Brundage (21-1) is second in the county with 
206 strikeouts and has an 0.25 ERA. She also leads the Vaqueros at the plate 
with a .424 average, five home runs and 21 RBIs. Irvine opens at home at 
Harvard Park against Tustin (14-9). 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo (17-9), which last season surprised many by advancing to the 
final despite being unranked, will have its hands full from the start. The 
Diablos open on the road at fourth-seeded Saddleback (19-2). 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback is led by sophomore pitcher Desiree Abrego (15-2), who has an 0.17 
ERA with 199 strikeouts. The Roadrunners have three .400 hitters and three 
others batting more than .300. Senior first baseman Priscilla Sarmiento leads 
the way at .429. 
</P>
<P>
Other first-round 3-A games featuring Orange County teams include Trabuco Hills 
(19-8) playing host to Montclair (17-9), Capistrano Valley (15-10) at South 
Torrance (17-3), Laguna Beach (10-6) at West Torrance (17-5) and Woodbridge 
(17-10) home to Mayfair (16-10). 
</P>
<P>
No Orange County teams are entered in the 2-A. 
</P>
<P>
First-round games in the 4-A, 1-A and Small Schools divisions will be Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The three seeded teams from Orange County in 4-A are Kennedy (No. 2), Buena 
Park (No. 3) and Garden Grove (No. 4).

LA HABRA STOPS FOOTHILL IN 12 INNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cathy Turner doubled in a run in the 12th inning to give La Habra High School a 
3-2 victory over Foothill in a Southern Section 4-A Division wild-card softball 
playoff game Wednesday at La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
Turner's double drove in freshman Danielle Ortega, who led off the inning with 
a single. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega also drove in the tying run with a two-out single in the bottom of the 
seventh, and pitched a complete game, striking out six and allowing six hits 
and no walks. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra (15-11) took a 1-0 lead in the sixth before Foothill (17-12) scored 
twice in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1-A wild-card game: 
</P>
<P>
Calvary Chapel 9, Connelly 1 -- Georgie Bogert pitched a six-hitter, struck out 
nine and walked none to lead Calvary Chapel (8-5-1) over Connelly (4-6) at 
Davis Park in Costa Mesa. Venise Garcia had two hits, scored twice and had four 
RBIs.

In another Avocado League game: 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos 10, Carlsbad 5 -- Brian Calloway hit a three-run homer and drove in 
four runs for San Marcos (13-11, 6-5). Carlsbad is 10-18, 1-11. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont 2-A League 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont 10, El Cajon Valley 3 -- Todd Cady, who broke the section record for 
RBIs last week, has 57 after adding five more. Cady had two hits and two 
sacrifice flies. Also for Grossmont (25-2, 8-0), Greg Layson went three for 
three, scored four runs, stole four bases and drove in a run. El Cajon Valley 
is 7-16-1, 2-6. 
</P>
<P>
Santana 5, West Hills 3 -- Mike Romo went three for four and scored twice for 
Santana (20-6, 6-2). West Hills is 3-22 and 0-8. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont 3-A League 
</P>
<P>
Helix 10, Mt. Miguel 3 -- Shawn Ballantyne hit a two-run homer, and Rob 
Ippolito (4-5) pitched a four-hitter and struck out 10 for Helix (17-8-1, 6-2), 
which tied for first with El Capitan. The teams will play Friday for the 
league's No. 1 seeding in the playoffs. Miguel is 4-22, 1-7. 
</P>
<P>
Granite Hills 7, El Capitan 6 -- Granite Hills scored twice in the eighth on 
two walks, a hit batter, a double error and a passed ball. 
</P>
<P>
Palomar League 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Buena Vista 2, Mt. Carmel 1 -- Stan McCarver (4-1) limited Mt. Carmel 
(20-6, 10-3) to four hits, and RBV (15-10-1, 10-3) capitalized on five errors 
despite getting just three hits off Doug Hill (7-2). Steve Valencia's suicide 
squeeze in the seventh inning provided the difference, as RBV created a 
three-way tie for first place. 
</P>
<P>
Poway 9, Fallbrook 2 -- Phil Portiera hit a two-run homer as Poway (18-6-1, 
10-3) scored five in the top of the seventh and moved into a three-way tie for 
first. Fallbrook is 10-13, 5-8. 
</P>
<P>
San Dieguito 5, Torrey Pines 4 -- Tony Sanchez's two-run single in the bottom 
of the sixth rallied San Dieguito (3-22-1, 2-10-1) from a 4-3 deficit. Torrey 
Pines is 11-16, 2-11. 
</P>
<P>

SAN PASQUAL WINS IN 11TH TO NAIL DOWN AVOCADO LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Tim Young was an unlikely hero Wednesday in San Pasqual's 6-5, 11-inning 
victory over visiting Oceanside, which clinched the Avocado League title. 
</P>
<P>
But he was a worthy one. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Young invited his friends to attend but said: "I won't be 
playing today, but it will still be a good game." 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, when San Pasqual starter Bobby Cummings began to struggle in the 
third, Young replaced him. 
</P>
<P>
With San Pasqual trailing, 4-2, Young induced Oceanside's Mel Douglas to ground 
into a double play, though Oceanside scored its fifth run. 
</P>
<P>
Young then proceeded to keep his team in the game by throwing six shutout 
innings with just two walks and three strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Although he entered the season as San Pasqual's No. 2 starter, control problems 
sent Young to the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
"When it comes to Timmy, you sort of take it one inning at a time," San Pasqual 
Coach Bill McCallister said. "He's performing now like I hoped he would all 
season long." 
</P>
<P>
When Young was relieved by Dave Vejtasa to start the ninth, he stayed in the 
game to play first base. Three innings later, he walked and scored the winning 
run from first when first baseman Kenya Hunt threw Eric Marsh's sacrifice bunt 
into center field and through the legs of Oceanside center fielder Terry 
Vaughn. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the ball go through the center fielder's legs, but I didn't think it 
went that far behind him," Young said. "Then all of a sudden I saw coach 
(McCallister) waving his arms like a crazy man." 
</P>
<P>
If Young's story was unlikely, San Pasqual's was even unlikelier. The Eagles 
finished their preleague season 3-8-1 but have won nine of their 11 league 
games to win the Avocado title. 
</P>
<P>
Sixth-ranked Oceanside (20-8-1, 8-3) is just a game back of San Pasqual 
(12-10-1) but are out of contention after being swept by the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
"We fought back today, but that's been our whole season," Young said. "After 
our start, we just wanted to make the playoffs -- just win a league game." 
</P>
<P>
The Avocado League title was the first for McCallister and the first for San 
Pasqual since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about a bunch of kids selling themselves out to do the right 
thing," McCallister said. "It's certainly nothing I've done." 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside starter Andrew Acevedo, who pitched his second 10-inning game of the 
year, gave way in the 11th to Saul Gutierrez, who took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
After trailing 5-2, San Pasqual tied it on Marin Soto's two-run homer in the 
third and Ben Duncan's RBI single in the fifth. Duncan finished four for five 
with two RBIs. Oceanside had a runner on third in the ninth, but shortstop Dave 
Goss' running catch of Hunt's blooper ended the inning. DAVE McKIBBEN

GREAT AMERICAN STOCK SINKS TO RECORD LOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Great American Bank's stock price sank to an all-time low Wednesday, reflecting 
growing pessimism about the savings and loan's chances of survival. 
</P>
<P>
In New York Stock Exchange trading, Great American shares closed at $2, down 
$.375 on the day, on relatively heavy volume of 544,000 shares traded. The 
shares had sold for as little as $1.625 earlier on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The stock was not helped by the S&amp;L's reporting a $1.2-million loss for its 
first-quarter ended March 30, a report released Tuesday after the stock markets 
had closed. But the loss seemed almost palatable in contrast to the massive 
losses that Great American had reported for its 1989 fourth quarter and full 
year. 
</P>
<P>
It was the disclosures farther down in Great American's press release that did 
the most damage and which were most discouraging to those who had hoped that 
the S&amp;L had finally gotten a handle on its problem loans. The news was that 
Great American is involved in yet another tiff with its auditors, one that 
could result in up to $65 million in asset write-downs for the second quarter 
to end June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Great American does not have an enviable record in its past fights with 
auditors. A dispute this year with its outside auditor Deloitte &amp; Touche 
resulted in Great American revising its fourth-quarter and full-year 1989 
losses downward by more than $140 million. The value of Great American's real 
estate loan portfolio in Arizona and elsewhere in the Southwest was at the core 
of the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Great American is in combat with the Office of Thrift Supervision, 
the federal S&amp;L regulatory agency, whose auditors have questioned that 
value of loans in California and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a disaster, having a dispute with federal regulators after their own 
accountants had to come in and had to revise the (1989) numbers," said Irving 
Katz, director of research at Thomas Green/San Diego Securities. 
</P>
<P>
Great American also disclosed that, despite efforts to clean up its troubled 
portfolio, its non-performing loans had continued to mount. Its classified 
assets, those which are currently underperforming or likely to soon become so, 
grew to $1.39 billion as of March 30, up from $1.3 billion on Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
That means a staggering 9% of the S&amp;L's $15.4 billion in assets are likely 
to involve a loss before repayment, contrasted with an average bad asset ratio 
of about 1.2% among thrifts covered by Sutro &amp; Co. investment bankers of 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Because so many of Great American's loans are delinquent, its net interest 
income continues to decline. For the first quarter, its net interest income was 
$57.1 million, or $14.6 million less than the $71.7 million reported for the 
first quarter 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"It just seems to go on and on," said Allan Bortel, vice president in Sutro 
&amp; Co.'s corporate finance department in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"But, when you have real estate problems as bad as Arizona, there are no easy 
answers. One thing I've learned about real estate is that it always takes 
longer to turn it around than anyone ever estimates, meaning the company, the 
regulators, the auditors or the investment bankers," Bortel said.

ATTENDANCE OFF AT TOURIST ATTRACTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego's tourism industry suffered through a poor first quarter as several 
local visitor attractions reported significant declines in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Sea World, for example, reported 30% fewer visitors in March than in March, 
1989, and 17.6% lower for this year's first three months than in the same 
quarter last year. Visitors to the San Diego Zoo were down 20% in March and 
13.1% for the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Officials were at a loss to explain the drop-off, except to note that there 
have been more days of rain this year than in 1989 and that Easter, a key 
holiday for tourism, fell in April this year instead of March as in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's traveling," said Sea World spokesman Dan LeBlanc, adding that several 
other Southern California amusement parks, including Knott's Berry Farm and 
Magic Mountain, are experiencing lackluster years. "Everybody's down to some 
degree," LeBlanc said. 
</P>
<P>
Other local tourist destinations reporting declines in March attendance 
included: Wild Animal Park, down 16.3%; Cabrillo National Monument, down 6.5%; 
Old Town State Park, down 39.1%, and local museums, down 11.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Total visitors to the San Diego area were 2.7 million in March, off 2.9% from 
2.78 million visitors in March, 1989, according to a computer model designed by 
San Diego Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau. Airport passenger arrivals, one of 
the statistics factored in by the computer, declined 1.2% in March from the 
same month in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel occupancy rates in San Diego continued to drop in March, a reflection of 
the bumper crop of new hotels in the county. For March, the average hotel 
occupancy rate was 68.9%, down from 71.4% in March 1989, according to a survey 
by Pannell Kerr Forster, an accounting and consulting firm that tracks the 
hotel industry. 
</P>
<P>
For the year to date, San Diego area hotel occupancies are down even more, to 
65.4% from 66.8% for the same three-month period last year. A healthy hotel 
market typically features occupancy rates of 70% or higher, said William A. 
Seymour, Pannell Kerr Forster's partner-in-charge for San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Hardest hit by the hotel construction boom are hotels in Mission Valley, 
Seymour said, where hotels have lost considerable convention business, 
particularly to new hotels downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Hotels in the Golden Triangle in north San Diego have also seen reduced 
occupancy rates, in part because of the openings over the past six months of 
the Hyatt Regency La Jolla and Sheraton at Torrey Pines, Seymour said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the softening market, average daily room rates at San Diego hotels held 
their own in March. The average rate was $83.28, up 4.9% from the $79.42 
average rate in March, 1989. Seymour credited the 20.5% increase in the average 
rate at local all-suites hotels to $80.25 per night for the overall increase. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for both Sea World and the zoo said construction projects at their 
attractions discouraged visitors to some extent but not enough to account for 
all of the reduction in attendance. Sea World is building its first new 
attraction since 1987, called Forbidden Reef, which will open this summer. The 
zoo is building an $11.4-million gorilla habitat to open in March, 1991.

EMPLOYERS GO BACK TO THE FUTURE TO FILL TEMPORARY SLOTS;

SUMMER JOBS: LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS PROVIDE AN OVERLOOKED POOL OF EMPLOYEES 
AND GAIN MUCH-NEEDED EXPERIENCE WHILE LEARNING WORK ETHIC.

Getting good, temporary help quickly can often be a troublesome task for 
employers, but many San Diego businesses have been filling their employment 
needs by tapping into tomorrow's work force: local youth. 
</P>
<P>
Whether it's a hotelier who needs extra manpower at the front desk, a marketing 
firm that needs help conducting a public opinion poll, or a manufacturer who 
needs a delivery person, the San Diego Consortium &amp; Private Industry 
Council encourages local businesses that need summer help to turn to its 
Hire-A-Youth Program. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, the council -- a coalition of private business leaders, county and 
city officials, and educators -- has been matching employers' needs with 
youthful workers' skills and abilities. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-year-old program, which is jointly sponsored by the state Employment 
Development Department, has provided local businesses with nearly 57,000 young 
workers. And most have made their employers happy: A survey of 50 randomly 
selected employers who participated in Hire-A-Youth last year showed that 95% 
would hire through the program again. 
</P>
<P>
But, these days, Hire-A-Youth officials say, employers have a responsibility to 
use the program. Program advocates say the business community must address 
critics' complaints about ill-prepared, uninspired youth, and help train and 
educate them to ensure a viable future work force. 
</P>
<P>
"We've left educators to worry about and solve the many problems that plague 
our youth, but then we complain about them when they turn 18 and show up on our 
doorsteps," said Reint Reinders, general manager of the La Jolla Marriott and 
chairman of the Hire-A-Youth program. 
</P>
<P>
"Many businesses can always use temporary help, others might be expanding 
certain operations and could take on a few more hires. . . we're asking those 
people to hire a youth," Reinders said. "And, even if they don't have a 
pressing need, we're asking people to see if they can create a slot." 
</P>
<P>
Program officials are asking private employers to provide youngsters, ages 
14-21, jobs that would last a minimum of six weeks, 20 hours each week and pay 
$5.00 an hour. "It would only cost $600," Reinders added." 
</P>
<P>
Hire-A-Youth is counting on the private sector to provide 4,000 jobs this 
summer, said Margie Rosas, the program's coordinator at the Private Industry 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
But Rosas said the Private Industry Council will be able to offer an additional 
2,550 government-subsidized jobs funded by the federal Job Training Partnership 
Act (JTPA), which helps finance job training for low-income, disadvantaged 
youth. This year, the Hire-A-Youth program has been allocated $3.4 million in 
federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program's more structured subsidized component, Rosas said, 
Hire-A-Youth officials are able to raise youngsters' awareness of the link 
between education and a good job. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals who meet JTPA criteria are given a minimum of eight hours of "labor 
market orientation" that teaches job interviewing skills, goal-planning, and 
the importance of proper dress and behavior in the workplace. But, more 
important, Rosas said, applicants are given a standardized test that measures 
competence in English comprehension and mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
Those who lack such basic skills "spend half the day in a summer school 
remedial education program and spend the other half at a job," Rosas said. 
</P>
<P>
"The objective here is to provide more than just a summer job," Rosas said. 
"It's one way to help make sure tomorrow's work force is educated properly. The 
kids find out what they have to know to be able to join the work force." 
</P>
<P>
Under the subsidized component, youngsters typically land clerical, computer, 
maintenance and writing work at local government departments or at private, 
nonprofit organizations. Such jobs provide a minimum of 180 hours of work at 
minimum wage, $4.25 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Burr, president of Southwestern Cable TV, says this summer will be the 
fourth time her company has participated in Hire-A-Youth. Burr has offered 
youngsters a variety of jobs at her company, including positions in cable 
equipment repair, warehouse receiving and distribution, public affairs and 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Burr said she's already witnessed the program's short- and long-term benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"We've placed people in the marketing department, where they've helped us 
conduct telephone surveys, or helped us research and develop a position paper 
which we used to decide whether we should proceed with a particular project," 
Burr said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an opportunity for us to offer a youth their first, positive work 
experience and maybe they'll come back to the industry they worked in." 
</P>
<P>
Through the Hire-A-Youth program, Tony Zych got a job repairing cable 
converters at Southwestern Cable two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It gave me a chance to get my feet in the door and show what I could do," said 
Zych, 21, who received electronics training at Mira Mesa High School. When Zych 
graduated, Southwestern Cable offered him a permanent job. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Jesse Wesley, 17, a junior at Gompers Secondary School Center for 
Mathematics, Science and Computer Technology in Southeast San Diego, won a job. 
</P>
<P>
The Hire-A-Youth program aggressively publicizes to schools and last year 
launched its Win-A-Job campaign last year. The creative recruiting method asks 
students to describe their career ambitions through an essay, poem or artistic 
display. The top three finishers in each category win jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"If a teen-ager goes out and tries to get a job on his own, there's a good 
chance he's going to end up" at a fast food restaurant, Wesley said. "The 
Hire-A-Youth program let's you find out about different careers," said Wesley, 
who said he improved his communication skills by conducting public opinion 
surveys for Pacific Group Telemarketing. 
</P>
<P>
Wesley, who aspires to become an astronaut or work in aerospace engineering, is 
hoping one of the local engineering or defense companies participates in the 
Hire-A-Youth program this summer. "It would give me a glimpse at my career," 
Wesley said. "It would be a wonderful opportunity."

ART BUCHWALD: EXPOSING THE GRADUATION RACKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART BUCHWALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the myths of higher education is that students care who their graduation 
speaker is going to be. We have recently witnessed the Barbara Bush brouhaha at 
Wellesley. Graduates and faculty members have ferociously debated the merits of 
having Mrs. Bush deliver a message of significance that will remain with the 
Class of 1990 for the rest of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
It is a myth because, according to the recent census figures, 99% of all 
students graduating this year will not recall what the speaker said. Twenty 
minutes after the ceremony is over they won't even remember who he or she was. 
</P>
<P>
I speak with some authority on this. Over the years I have addressed many 
graduating classes, and I found the only measure of a successful speech was to 
talk fast and leave out as much substance as I possibly could. 
</P>
<P>
This has been my experience: I have noticed that as soon as I start to speak, 
the students look at their watches. Although this is disconcerting, it is not 
disruptive. The disruption comes from those without watches who keep asking 
others what time it is. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of making some of my most significant points, foaming champagne 
bottles always appear and are passed up and down the rows. Swigging champagne 
from the bottle during a commencement speaker's talk has now become the most 
sacred of all graduation rituals. 
</P>
<P>
The way many students kill time during a speech is to pull the tassel on the 
cap of the person seated in front of them. If the person whose tassel is being 
pulled likes the person who is pulling, there is a great deal of giggling. But 
if he or she doesn't like the tassel-tugger, then loud, harsh words are 
exchanged. 
</P>
<P>
One reason students don't pay too much attention to the speaker is they are 
using the time to locate their parents and relatives sitting in the bleachers. 
If it's a large ceremony, this requires a tremendous amount of scouting. 
Sometimes the relatives are helpful because they start yelling at the graduate. 
This, by the way, doesn't do one's speech any good at all. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor making it difficult to get your message across is that students 
are much more concerned about their appearance as they walk across the stage to 
receive their diplomas than they are with what the speaker is saying. The 
conferring of degrees takes place right after the commencement speech, so 
everyone is adjusting his or her gown. Some students will decide to take their 
bows with their gowns zipped up. Others will leave them open as their first 
post-graduate act of defiance. 
</P>
<P>
There are even students who will sleep during your talk, but I have discovered 
that it's nothing personal. 
</P>
<P>
The reason that they can't stay awake is because they haven't had any sleep the 
night before. The mistake most speakers make is to keep staring at the student 
who is sleeping, and this can throw off a speaker's timing something awful. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, in every graduating class there will be a few who bring their 
morning newspapers with them, and then turn the pages while you're speaking. 
The only way I can deal with this is to say to myself, "Thank God they can 
read." 
</P>
<P>
As a speaker, the most important lesson I have learned is: No matter how 
pertinent my message, it was not appreciated by the Class of 1990, because the 
audience couldn't hear one word of it over the school's 1943 loudspeaker 
system.

MAGAZINES: AUDUBON BRINGS THE DEFORESTATION CRISIS INTO OUR BACK YARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As any good American knows by now, it's imperative to stop those shortsighted 
Brazilians and Indonesians who are intent on destroying rain forests -- an 
international resource if ever there was one. 
</P>
<P>
But the current magazine crop suggests that sometimes we don't see our own 
deforestation for all the endangered foreign trees. 
</P>
<P>
In the May Audubon, journalist Lee Green presents an engaging expose of 
official giant slayers. In this telling, however, the Goliaths (California's 
giant sequoias) and Davids (a handful of obsessed, grass-roots 
conservationists) are on the same side. "They've Been Raping the Giant 
Sequoias" is no more objective than its title, but it is told with eloquent 
passion. 
</P>
<P>
For at least three decades, critics have railed against the U.S. Forest Service 
for alleged fiscal and environmental mismanagement of the 191 million acres it 
oversees. Now, Green reports, a Central California mother and a teacher have 
found evidence that Forest Service managers of the forests north of Bakersfield 
played fast and loose with a national treasure: the few remaining giant sequoia 
groves. 
</P>
<P>
Big "museum trees" -- some more than 300 feet tall and 35 feet wide -- are 
protected by law. But by using loopholes and technicalities, the Forest Service 
has encouraged loggers to clear cut and bulldoze -- "nuke" in 
silviculturist-speak -- the groves where the giants live. To avoid legal log 
jams, the Forest Service simply circumvented public debate of this 
controversial "grove management," the activists assert. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with relentless anger and Freedom of Information Act requests, the women 
and their supporters have become thorns in the side of the Forest Service; they 
are preparing a legal challenge to the clandestine cutting. Meantime, the 
federal agency seems to view the majestic old groves strictly in terms of 
harvestable board-feet. 
</P>
<P>
Across the Pacific in America's 50th state, construction of a 500 megawatt 
geothermal project threatens the last remaining lowland rain forest in the 
United States. The May Sierra looks into the politics of the project. The May 
31 Rolling Stone puts the threat in broader perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Bill McKibben, author of last year's much-discussed New Yorker series "The End 
of Nature," reports in Rolling Stone that Hawaii is a ideal place for use of 
solar and other alternative energy sources. But the new Hyatt Regency Waikoloa 
hotel alone -- with its electric monorail and electric boats -- draws 4% of the 
island's peak-load electricity. "How much forest will be left," McKibben 
wonders, "When we finally come to our senses?" 
</P>
<P>
Hard to say. But in a comprehensive, clear-sighted piece on logging policies in 
the Pacific Northwest in the May 14 New Yorker, Catherine Caufield points out 
that "Ours was once a forested planet." The hills of Greece, Syria and Lebanon 
were forested, as were many other now-barren landscapes. Now, in large part 
because of "bad practice" by the Forest Service, what's left of our ancient 
forests is disappearing fast. Caufield compares the logging industry's dilemma 
to that faced by the whaling industry a while back. 
</P>
<P>
But "unlike the whaling industry, the timber industry is not doomed; change, 
not death, is inevitable. The question for us now is: Shall we destroy our 
ancient forests to postpone this change for a few years?" 
</P>
<P>
Not all the news from the forest front is gloomy, though. According to the 
May-June E Magazine, The Children's Rainforest project has given young 
Americans a stake in forests' future -- mainly forests in Costa Rica, as it 
happens. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
REQUIRED READING 
</P>
<P>
* Just as ecological crises often become clearer the farther away they are, so, 
too, do issues of freedom. We abhor the Ayatollah's Draconian censorship but 
look the other way while gentler, more effective, public relations campaigns 
co-opt our own intellectual freedom. That's the view of Exposure magazine. 
"Censorship in America," writes Alexander Cockburn, "takes the form of a vast 
industry of manipulation, in which the politicians, the military and the 
corporations all partake, through the agency of the press, the advertising 
business and -- not to be forgotten -- the educational system . . . to censor 
out all inconvenient information and disruptive ideas." The April-May issue of 
this excellent press outlet also includes a portfolio of some of the most 
celebrated censored work of the day, including Robert Mapplethorpe's "Helmut." 
</P>
<P>
* In its May 21 cover story, Newsweek estimates the savings and loan fiasco at 
"$250 billion that was stolen or wasted and must be repaid." A cute box shows 
what that money could buy. For instance, 132 B-2 bombers, 40 Aegis cruisers and 
100 Sea Wolf submarines. Or funding for every existing government education 
program, from preschool through college, for four years; or four years of 
universal and long-term care for the elderly; or . . . 
</P>
<P>
* In the Civil War, soldiers who crumpled under fire were said to suffer from 
"nostalgia." In Vietnam, the affliction was labeled Post-Traumatic Stress 
Disability. A comprehensive, compelling article in the May-June American 
Heritage traces the history of "shellshock" and concludes that modern war 
techniques have rendered the Homeric ideals of valor, courage, manliness and 
sacrifice so much romantic bunk. 
</P>
<P>
* Willie Loman wouldn't have been so downbeat if he had had the May Success 
magazine to browse through. Entirely devoted to salesmanship, the issue is as 
relentlessly optimistic as a Norman Vincent Peale seminar. It is packed with 
tips on how to get customers -- a kid buying sneakers or a conglomerate bidding 
on a company -- to cough up cash.

* It would be hard to overstate the stupidity of the premiere issue of 
Nickelodeon magazine. Among many stupid features are a stupid Chevy Chase 
interview and stupid "Flat Cat" and "Elephant Comedy Club" comic strips. "Know 
why they don't allow elephants on the beach?" the elephant comedian asks. 
"Because we can't keep our trunks up!" It's as if the publication were written 
for fourth-graders. Wait. It is written for fourth-graders. Fourth-, fifth-, 
sixth- and seventh-graders. Kids who spend hour after hour watching stupid 
programs on Nickelodeon and learning to lust after the stupid Nickelodeon 
merchandise advertised in the magazine: The Nick Bubble Watch, the Nick "Super 
Sloppy Double Dare" T-shirt. Fortunately, the premiere issue of Nickelodeon is 
available only at Pizza Hut and only on Tuesday nights this month, then by 
subscription.

MYSTERIOUS, MURKY NOVEL ABOUT EVERYWOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER, TIMES BOOK CRITICLITTLE WOMAN by Ellen Akins Harper &amp; Row 
$18.95, 240 pages 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The title of Ellen Akins' new novel refers to its protagonist and narrator. She 
is six-foot-two or -three and weighs 185 pounds. Her name is Beauty, and though 
everyone thought she was pretty when she was a child, nobody thinks so now; 
she, least of all. 
</P>
<P>
Oxymorons are nouns in a rage at not being able to do more. When you speak of 
cold fire, it is because there is no other way to express its searing power. To 
suggest the pain and anger of a woman's sense of misplacement and misuse, Akins 
has come up with an oxymoronic heroine. 
</P>
<P>
Beauty is a giant; it is her nature as well as her physique. But the world 
wants her small. Her father doted on her for a while, she tells us, "until I 
grew progressively bigger, forcing him finally to say 'Whoa' or words to that 
effect, I expect, since that was his philosophy vis-a-vis me from then on." 
</P>
<P>
She tried to comply; as an adolescent, she stooped. "In this contorted posture, 
hunched and still hovering over my supposed peers, I longed so intensely to be 
one of them that my longing alone would have put them at an impossible remove 
if my height hadn't." 
</P>
<P>
She tried for an acceptable line of work: advertising. But her nature -- 
woman's nature, Akins suggests, is giant's nature -- got in the way. She 
proposed a perfume that would only be noticeable to the wearer; authenticity, 
that is, instead of propaganda. In a valiant effort to recoup, she married her 
boss-mentor; but she is utterly unable to describe him. And she tried so hard 
to be a mother that she bore twins. 
</P>
<P>
Mothers are supposed to hug and fondle a lot. So the world -- in this case, her 
mother-in-law -- insisted. But at her size, she knew, this could be fatal. When 
the mother-in-law plops one twin on her lap, she pulls away, dropping and 
nearly killing him. She packs a bag and walks out. 
</P>
<P>
It is at this point, 15 pages along, that "Little Woman" essentially begins. 
And it is at this point that its joyous anger and witty irrepressibility 
flicker and submerge in a cloudiness that hides from sight most of what the 
author is telling us. 
</P>
<P>
Beauty meets Clara, her tiny opposite number. Clara is a five-time widow and 
is, or seems to be, immensely rich. She takes mysteriously to Beauty, and 
offers unstinting support and company in a scheme to create a female Utopia. 
</P>
<P>
Together, they buy up a square mile of wilderness in northernWisconsin, where 
Beauty used to go when she was still small and identified the whole world with 
her mother. They round up a dozen women in various stages of abuse; they will 
set up a self-sufficient community, starting from scratch and making everything 
themselves. Beauty supervises the awkward building of a windmill. Two cows are 
acquired, and some chickens. 
</P>
<P>
From here on, it is an inch-by-inch account of cold, dirt, hunger, misery and 
anger. The women not only are abused, they are -- no doubt this is the point -- 
deformed in various ways. They are lazy, quarrelsome, incompetent, childish, 
deranged and violent. 
</P>
<P>
There is a mysterious and alluring doctor in the vicinity, who lends a hand 
when things get out of hand. He becomes lover to several of the women, 
including Clara and, eventually, Beauty. There is a neighboring houseful of 
apparently orphaned children. There is mud and mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
The dream of self-sufficiency founders among the large checks that Clara and 
Beauty are forced to write, and in the successive desertions of each one of the 
Women Abreast -- the name they have given to the community. Beauty is left 
alone with the doctor and with the baby born to Clara, who has been killed by 
the homemade windmill. 
</P>
<P>
The central theme is compelling. Beauty, the giant in Akins' vision of 
Everywoman, is fighting a brutal and titanic struggle not simply with society 
but also with the primordial nature of things. Whether she wins or loses, and 
what she wins or loses, is not clear; but this is not necessarily important for 
the reader. 
</P>
<P>
What is important are the obscure terms on which it is all told. Who Clara is, 
or the doctor, or the houseful of orphans, quite escapes me. More seriously, 
for all the grim and detailed realism of life and misfortune at Women Abreast, 
it can be hard to be sure just what is happening even on the most concrete and 
minute-by-minute level. 
</P>
<P>
Akins, author of "Home Movies," is a powerful and original writer. In "Little 
Woman," the power goes haywire. Its mystery, so heavily applied, turns to murk. 
Instead of kindling the imagination, it douses it.

Kirk Douglas Collection Sold: "Chasse Croise," a painting of fantastic 
personages by Jean Dubuffet, sold for $2 million and ran away with an auction 
of 17 works from the collection of Kirk and Anne Douglas on Wednesday at 
Christie's New York. The couple put a total of 52 works on the block this month 
to raise funds for a collection of contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
The Dubuffet and Bernard Buffet's "Fleur de Lis," which brought $385,000, were 
the only items that exceeded expectations. Eight pieces failed to sell and four 
fetched less than their low estimates. Among the sales were a painting of a 
white horse and Mexican rider by Marc Chagall ($660,000) and a Georges Braque 
still life ($638,000). GREG BRAXTON

PIANIST DAVID ANDRUSS IN CONSERVATIVE PROGRAM IN ORANGE

<P>
At the St. Joseph Center Auditorium Tuesday night, 20-year-old pianist David 
Andruss took a tentative step toward building a career. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California native, whose USC bachelor of music degree was just 5 
days old, had mounted a grass-roots campaign, rallying friends and family, who 
had arranged for the hall, orchestrated publicity, ordered printed programs and 
sold tickets. Tuesday they were manning the doors, assembling a mailing list 
and accepting orders for tapes of the recital. 
</P>
<P>
Andruss himself presented a conservative program -- perhaps (judging from the 
four historical periods faithfully represented) a replay of his graduation 
recital. Programming familiar works may endear the performer to his audience, 
but it also risks comparison to standards already set by great artists. 
</P>
<P>
Andruss is talented and ambitious, but he is not a great artist. His 
performance of Chopin's F-minor Ballade was clean, well-controlled and 
musically sensitive. But the piece's potential for emotional catharsis remained 
hidden. 
</P>
<P>
Other works also unfolded with refinement but with relatively little excitement 
and few profundities. The Fourth Partita of J.S. Bach opened with stylish 
double-dotting and liberal use of pedal. Andruss sang the Allemande lovingly, 
though without exploiting poignant dissonances. He phrased logically and found 
a bright, appealing sound in the Gigue. Still, he shunned varied ornamentation 
that might have enlivened repeats in slow movements. 
</P>
<P>
Andruss' straightforward attentiveness extended to mastery over dynamic nuance, 
especially softer shades. This served well in four quiet miniatures from 
Federico Mompou's suite of nine "Impresiones Intimas" and afforded some 
atmospheric Impressionism in Ravel's "Le Tombeau de Couperin." 
</P>
<P>
"Le Tombeau," which closed the concert, gave the only hint of a musical 
perception and showmanship that might surpass pleasant competence. Throughout 
the work, Andruss kept his tempos strict, his tone shimmering but unvaried. 
</P>
<P>
However, in the final movement, the Toccata, he built an exciting momentum and 
propelled the music toward an effective climax.

'A Little Glitch': A lawsuit by Johnny Carson's first wife asking for more 
alimony may be foiled because she remarried after divorcing Carson. Joan (Jody) 
Carson, the mother of the talk show host's three sons, wed Donald Buckley, an 
ad executive, soon after she divorced Carson. Describing the remarriage as a 
"little glitch in the case," New York State Supreme Court Justice Phyllis 
Gangel-Jacob questioned if her request for more alimony could be supported. 
Mrs. Carson is seeking $120,000 a year from her ex-husband. GREG BRAXTON

Cannes Controversy: "Hidden Agenda," a film set in strife-torn Northern 
Ireland, sparked a furor at the Cannes Film Festival on Wednesday, as 
journalists from right-wing British newspapers accused director Ken Loach of 
pro-Republican bias. The film centers on a group of civil rights campaigners 
investigating human rights abuses in Northern Ireland. The post-premiere news 
conference turned into a wrangling match as the British reporters stood up to 
denounce the movie and were shouted down by colleagues. GREG BRAXTON

A GRAND GROUP AT GRAND AVENUE BAR

<P>
Organizing a new, big jazz orchestra has to rank right up there with tilting 
with windmills. Yet, for the last five years, two brothers -- bassist John and 
saxophonist Jeff Clayton -- and drummer Jeff Hamilton have been doggedly 
spending most of their free time planning, rehearsing, underwriting and 
recording a no- holds-barred, 18-piece ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night, the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra performed at the Biltmore 
Hotel's Grand Avenue Bar &amp; Grill, clearly demonstrating that all the work 
and effort has not been in vain. The Clayton-Hamilton ensemble provides 
persuasive evidence that big-band jazz is still a powerful vehicle for creative 
expression. 
</P>
<P>
The opening set was a well-programmed collection of works, most of them 
arranged by John Clayton, ranging from Basie-like blues and Ellington pastels 
to a richly harmonized ensemble sound that is the group's identifying 
characteristic. The best example was a sumptuous Clayton chart for Johnny 
Mandel's "Melt Away" that showcased Jeff Clayton's alto leading a gorgeously 
textured sax section. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the reality of current music business economics probably won't 
allow much more than occasional appearances by the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz 
Orchestra. Too bad. It's one of the brightest new jazz sounds of the decade.

NEW PRINCIPALS IN 'GREEN TABLE' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Few ballets incorporate the routine of cast changes into their themes as 
profoundly as does Kurt Jooss' anti-war parable "The Green Table." The faces 
may change; the terrible cycle goes on. 
</P>
<P>
Three new principals joined the Joffrey Ballet line-up of relentless marchers 
to death, Tuesday at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Corry made a joyfully opportunistic, rapacious Profiteer, hurrahing the 
troops, cheering the patriots and, given the chance, stripping a ring off a 
dead soldier's finger with manic glint in his eye. 
</P>
<P>
Corry bounded, glided and hopped through the carnage, and hovered over the 
Young Girl (Kim Sagami) with voracious intent. 
</P>
<P>
But even the Profiteer had no immunity from the overall slaughter, and Corry 
died an astonished, crumpled figure. 
</P>
<P>
Sagami met her fate -- loss of her lover, life in a brothel -- with 
uncomprehending innocence, vestiges of honor and helplessly entreating pleas. 
But she made her final moments frantic and fearful. 
</P>
<P>
Jodie Gates made a fiercely determined, slightly crazed Partisan. Pushed to the 
wall, with nothing to lose, she found dignity and heroism and, finally, comfort 
in being carried off by death. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Lewis again conducted. 
</P>
<P>
The program also included Balanchine's "Cotillon" and Ashton's "Illuminations," 
both previously reviewed. CHRIS PASLES

HUNGARY FOCUSES ON REFORMING THE NUTRITIONAL HABITS OF ITS CITIZENS;

HEALTH: THE EAST BLOC COUNTRY'S PROBLEMS INCLUDE HIGH RATES OF ALCOHOLISM, 
SUICIDE AND MORBIDITY.

Victims of the 1956 Revolution may get more press, but poor nutrition has 
killed more Hungarians than tyrants ever will, say health experts who are 
growing increasingly alarmed about Magyar eating habits. 
</P>
<P>
Dietary reform is difficult in a country that has long prided itself on a 
cuisine rich with cream sauces, refined sugar and pork fat. Add to this the 
fact that lean meats are priced beyond most budgets -- one in five Hungarians 
live below the poverty line -- and you get a deadly recipe for widespread 
cardiovascular disease. 
</P>
<P>
"Hungarian morbidity rates are catastrophic and worsening," says Peter Makara, 
a spokesman for the Hungarian Institute for Health Promotion. "Since 1963, the 
life expectancy of men in Hungary is decreasing, which is absolutely unheard of 
in a peaceful country." 
</P>
<P>
The East Bloc has never been a Pritikin paradise of course. But Hungary's 
health problems are unique, even among its Warsaw Pact allies: Its alcoholism 
and suicide rates rank among the world's highest, and Hungary, along with the 
Soviet Union, shares the lowest life expectancy of any developed country, 
according to an April, 1989, World Health Organization report (69.7 years 
versus 75.5 years in the United States and 79.1 years in Japan.) 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, nutrition wasn't a priority under the old regime; even former 
Communist leader Janos Kadar -- who died earlier this year -- enjoyed his bread 
drenched in bacon drippings. But today, as Hungary opens up to the West, there 
is mounting interest in reforming diet as well as politics. 
</P>
<P>
"I sense a distinct change in attitude," says Dr. Sushma Palmer, who sits on 
the food and nutrition board of the National Academy of Sciences. She just 
spent a year helping the government draw up nutritional guidelines and teaching 
courses for educators and health professionals. 
</P>
<P>
But Palmer, who is also the wife of the former U.S. Ambassador to Hungary, says 
that although the government readily acknowledges the problem, it has been slow 
to act. 
</P>
<P>
Nutrition isn't taught in school, for instance, so students who know Madonna's 
songs by heart can't recite the four basic food groups. Hungarian produce 
overflows from supermarket shelves, but Budapest's salad bars can be counted on 
one hand. Words like fiber and cholesterol haven't entered the vernacular. 
</P>
<P>
Makara admits he is sometimes embarrassed when colleagues from the World Health 
Organization visit him to help plan a European nutrition conference that 
Hungary is expected to host in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
When dinner time rolls around, Makara says he and his guests must comb the 
streets of Budapest for newly opened private eateries where fried food isn't 
the dominant culinary motif. 
</P>
<P>
"Healthful foods are very difficult to find. . . . In a normal Hungarian 
restaurant there are no good choices," says Makara, a portly man of 43 who 
drops four sugar cubes into each demitasse of espresso. 
</P>
<P>
But there are some portents of change, especially among the more well-to-do and 
educated classes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a new trend among the intelligentsia to invite you to their home and 
serve a variety of salads," Makara says. 
</P>
<P>
And of course, restaurants at Western-style hotels offer everything from Cobb 
salads to grilled chicken breasts. This summer Budapest's elegant Forum Hotel 
-- a streamlined Western facility perched on the banks of the Danube -- began 
offering a menu of "Hungarian nouvelle cuisine" featuring traditional Hungarian 
ingredients cooked into upscale offerings. Perch is served in a Champagne sauce 
instead of a cream-based sauce; hearty squab soup becomes a consomme, and veal 
medallions are braised and served with zucchini instead of languishing in sour 
cream. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to make them eat more vegetables and we don't use fats. For the 
Hungarian people, this is a new thing," says Ervin Ungar, manager of the 
Forum's swank Silhouettes restaurant, where dinner runs at least $25 per 
person. 
</P>
<P>
But the average Hungarian factory worker is more likely to visit the moon than 
blow a month's wages on a pricey dinner for his family. Besides, in certain 
circles, such food is considered an insult. 
</P>
<P>
"If you go into a village they don't offer you salad. It's an offense. If they 
want to honor you they bring out some good fatty meat and fatty soup," says Dr. 
Sandor Eckhardt, a director of Hungary's Oncological Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sandor Bardach, who teaches at Pesti Barnabi High School in Budapest, which 
teaches food production, says many of his students remain ignorant of the 
connection between diet and cardiovascular disease. 
</P>
<P>
"I myself know very well the connection. I have to go to the doctor for 
cholesterol," Bardach says. At his school however, "we don't deal with it in 
the proper way. It is a problem of the future." 
</P>
<P>
Hungarian health experts say the recent lifting of travel restrictions to the 
West will expose more of their countrymen to good nutrition. But they want 
dietary classes taught in all schools. They want TV commercials that tout the 
health benefits of boiled lard scrapped. And they want the state to take the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, competing government programs often sabotage efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Makara, of the state Institute for Health Promotion, complains that his plans 
for an anti-cholesterol campaign were nixed because another state agency had 
invested heavily in egg factories and thus wanted Hungarians to eat more, not 
fewer, eggs. 
</P>
<P>
Ditto with refined sugar. "We are constructing two new sugar processing 
factories, which absolutely excludes the possibility of an anti-sugar 
campaign," Makara says. 
</P>
<P>
Those pushing nutritional perestroika say economics also plays a major role. 
Many Hungarian jobs involve heavy physical labor, which requires a consumption 
of many calories. So wives on limited budgets stuff their husbands with bread, 
lard and potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
"The unhealthy food like fat and carbohydrates are very cheap in our country 
but vegetables and lean meat are relatively expensive," Eckhardt says. 
</P>
<P>
And scientists cite a study showing that Hungarian consumption of vegetables 
and fruit actually declined by 5% between 1960 and 1982, an alarming trend that 
nutritionists blame partly on rising prices. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the Hungarian diet was once rich in leaner meat and fish. In the 
last century, Hungary was three times as large as it is now and included the 
forested province of Transylvania, which it was forced to cede to Romania by 
the Trianon Treaty after World War I. In those days, wild game was popular and 
plentiful, as were fish caught fresh from the banks of the Danube, Makara says. 
</P>
<P>
No longer. Today, game dishes such as haunch of deer Eszterhazy and roast 
breast of pheasant prowl mainly on expensive tourist menus. 
</P>
<P>
And the government discourages people from eating fish caught in the Danube, 
which is now brown from the industrial wastes that are discharged into its 
currents. The once pristine river is now so polluted that a man who recently 
drank a glass of Danube water as a publicity stunt was featured for his daring 
stupidity on the evening news. 
</P>
<P>
But there are signs that Hungary is becoming more aware of organic, health and 
specialty foods. An organic grocery store on Kristina Korut in the 
upper-income, residential hills of Buda does a thriving business. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this fall, between legalizing opposition parties and declaring itself a 
republic, the Hungarian Parliament approved a national health awareness and 
disease prevention program. 
</P>
<P>
And the American-Hungarian Friendship Forum, a private, U.S. foundation that 
Palmer helped found, plans an extensive program to train Hungarian 
nutritionists in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the average Andras may look askance at any attempts to exile his 
favorite dishes to gastronomic Siberia. "I tried to serve my husband salad for 
dinner," one Hungarian journalist complained with a sigh. "He got angry with me 
and said, 'What is this, rabbit food? Bring me an old-fashioned Hungarian meal 
like my mother used to make.' "

"Time ticks on since 1931 at the Tick Tock Toluca" said the menu from the North 
Hollywood, Calif., restaurant, circa 1947. Time also ticks on at Chicago's Pump 
Room, which listed shrimp cocktail on its menu in 1938 for 50 cents. (In April 
at the Pump Room it was going for $9.50.) 
</P>
<P>
But time doesn't change some things, like the all-American burger, albeit for 
10 cents at Boxman's restaurant in Bloomington, Ind., 1930: 
</P>
<P>
"Boxman's special hamburger grilled, with a slice of tomato, chopped olive, 
lettuce and mayonnaise . . . a hamburger all dressed up and very popular." 
</P>
<P>
These and other homilies, food trends, inflationary information and historical 
tidbits are part of the National Restaurant Assn.'s menu collection, tucked in 
a back room in the library of the trade group's headquarters in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
While not the oldest or the largest of such anthologies, NRA's collection 
consists of several hundred menus dating from the '30s to the '70s. There are 
also about 3,000 from the last decade, gathered from the association's annual 
menu contest. 
</P>
<P>
The older part of the collection came from a variety of sources, but largely as 
a donation by one woman about whom NRA knows little. Thus, it is not only a 
cache of brittle paper and plastic covers that have lost their gloss, but the 
leisure history of the mystery woman who made the donation. 
</P>
<P>
Menu margins are scribbled with enthusiastic notes: At the Penn-Sheraton Hotel 
in Pittsburgh in 1960, she wrote "delirious" next to the spare ribs Creole. In 
1962, at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco, she ate in the Tonga Room "with 
Dal Brown. Everything was wonderful, had so much fun. A panic. Loved it." (Dal 
ordered the barbecued sparerib plate; she had the mushroom chicken, listed 
under "special Tonga dishes.") 
</P>
<P>
The period these menus represents was short and not so long ago. Nonetheless, a 
lot has changed. Menus have evolved from simple lists of black type on white 
paper to catchy, colorful texts. There was not much detail or description of 
dishes then. Menu items were likely to be listed as "fried rabbit" or 
"smothered chicken, country gravy," as at the Tick Tock Toluca. 
</P>
<P>
The menu "started out as a bill of fare and became more and more a marketing 
tool," said David Romm, assistant professor at the Cornell School of Hotel 
Administration, where he teaches a class called "The Restaurant in Society." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s restaurants didn't mean as much, Romm said. They "moved into 
center stage" during the 1960s, and so the menu became a means of capturing 
customers from the competition, he added. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, many of the items on menus of the '30s and '40s are unseen 
nowadays. Entree choices then were fleshed out by game dishes, frogs' legs and 
organ meats. Society, after all, was far more agrarian, and nothing from the 
farm was wasted. Americans were "eating everything in the pig except the oink," 
said Linda Smith, manager of library and information services at NRA. Head 
cheese was common at nice restaurants, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Sandwiches on the 1940 menu from Chicago's Marshall Field's department-store 
restaurant, the Narcissus Fountain Room, were typical: sweetbread salad roll, 
65 cents; minced tongue and horseradish, 25 cents; hot chicken giblet with 
pickle, 35 cents. 
</P>
<P>
There was also much more attention to sexy, slinky cocktails like pink ladies. 
"All those drinks that Grace Kelly used to order in the movies," said Claire 
Regan, NRA's nutritionist. 
</P>
<P>
Many dishes were offered fried, and whole glasses of fresh cream appeared as a 
beverage choice. At Chicago's Persian Dining Room in 1945, where the only 
Persian items on the menu were "our very special Persian omelette" and "our 
Persian chicken salad," the "health vegetable plate" came with Swedish 
meatballs. 
</P>
<P>
As a war measure to "make the nation strong," Regan said, in 1941 the federal 
government required that all bread and rolls be enriched with B vitamins and 
iron. Thus, Marshall Field's English Room offered "vitamin-B rolls." 
</P>
<P>
Other signs of the war were reflected on menus in the '40s. Many noted that the 
prices were at or below ceiling prices set by the Office of Price 
Administration, and that a record of the ceiling prices was available for 
inspection. OPA was established by the federal government in 1942 to set 
rationing and price and rent controls for the wartime economy. 
</P>
<P>
One restaurant, the New York-based White Turkey, made reference on its menu 
that it had temporarily closed its Danbury, Conn., branch until the ban on 
pleasure travel was lifted. 
</P>
<P>
While the men dined on K rations, the vegetable of choice on mainland menus was 
lima beans, the dessert of the decade was kadota figs and the drink was 
Ovaltine. 
</P>
<P>
In the '50s, game and organ meats were replaced with the ubiquitous half a 
fried chicken. The vegetable of choice became garden peas, the salad was an 
iceberg wedge with thousand island dressing and the misguided high-fat "diet 
plate" of a hamburger patty, scoop of cottage cheese and peach half started 
appearing often. 
</P>
<P>
Figs were replaced by Jell-O with whipped cream, water ice or sherbet, even at 
some of the more elegant restaurants. French dining rooms were likely to be 
named things like "The House of Crepes Suzette," serving cherries jubilee and 
peach flambe. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the 1960s, Jell-O took a side role to cheesecake and "French pastry." 
French restaurant menus were large and cumbersome with fancy scroll, and 
everything was either au gratin, au jus or had an accent aigu. (Le Manoir, 
location unknown to NRA, served what it called a "minute steak grillee.") Les 
escargots were invariably followed by "snails" in parentheses. 
</P>
<P>
Glossy photographs of food started appearing on menus, like the ones at Mack 
Eplen's Restaurant, otherwise known in Abilene, Texas, as the House of 
Hospitality. You didn't have to visualize; you could see exactly what an order 
of sirloin butt steak with a salad, baked potato, hot rolls, iceberg lettuce 
and tomato slice would look like. 
</P>
<P>
There's only one word for what appeared on menus in the next decade. "All you 
need to know about the '70s," said Smith, is "quiche." Everything else was 
turned into teriyaki. Cheeseburgers shed their orange American slabs in favor 
of Monterey Jack or blue cheese. 
</P>
<P>
Menus treated food as fun. The Twin Falls (Idaho) Chew-Chew restaurant menu was 
shaped like a train. The Fogcutter's Restaurant (St. Petersburg, Fla.) menu was 
shaped like a barrel. Menus were fashioned after newspapers with cartoon 
drawings of pies, burgers and quiches. Words were purposely spelled 
incorrectly: kaiser klub. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the homilies that appeared on older menus may never be rivaled. 
</P>
<P>
At Chancellor's Restaurant in Waynesboro, Miss., in 1950, the proprietor 
offered this bit of culinary advice to describe the eatery's reason for serving 
what it called "left hams": 
</P>
<P>
"When a hog scratches his right side, he does a Charleston with his right foot. 
That develops muscles. When he scratches his left side, he does a gentle shimmy 
against a tree or post. Therefore, right hams are far more muscular and less 
tender than those from the left side of the same hog." 
</P>
<P>
Other restaurants sounded genuinely sincere in their efforts to please. The 
fountain dessert was king in Bloomington, Ind., in 1930, so Boxman's made the 
following menu offer: 
</P>
<P>
"We respectfully suggest that you try your skill in making up a Dessert 
Special. Perhaps you have wondered many times just what it would taste like if 
so-and-so and so-and-so were put together in a dish. Our Fountain Dispenser 
will get a great thrill and be delighted to make up this special dish for you. 
Just give your service girl your formula!"

Restaurateurs interested in menu design, chefs wanting to recreate historical 
dinners and food buffs looking for a slice of culinary past are among those who 
use menu collections, according to those who collect them. 
</P>
<P>
It can be tedious research, however. Because of their assorted sizes, varieties 
and topics, menus are hard to classify and catalogue systematically. 
</P>
<P>
A few collections, like the National Restaurant Assn.'s, are documented on 
computer. (If you wanted to know, for example, which restaurants in its 
collection served Welsh rarebit in Chicago in the 1940s, just punch a few 
keywords into the computer and up comes a list.) 
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, there are many private menu collections belonging to enthusiastic 
diners, either stashed in desk drawers or piled in basement boxes. Private 
cooking schools are another source, but are generally not open to the public. 
Here is a handful of public collections. Call in advance if you'd like to take 
a look: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Department of Special Collections, University Research Library, Los 
Angeles. Wonder what the Jonathan club was serving in the 30's? This collection 
of menus, more than half from California, will tell you that. The collection is 
open to everyone with a reference card for the UCLA libraries. Since the menus 
are in remote storage, it's best to call ahead and have the material paged. The 
collection is open Monday-Saturday from 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Call (213) 825-4988. 
</P>
<P>
 -- National Restaurant Assn., 1200 17th St. NW., Washington, D.C. 20036. 
Includes menus described in accompanying story. NRA also welcomes donations of 
old menus. Call 202-331-5960. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Smithsonian National Museum of American History, Archive Center, 
Constitution Ave. NW., Washington D.C. 20560. Menus from the 19th and 20th 
centuries are part of the museum's Warshaw Collection of Business Americana, 
which includes many other food and food-related pieces. The menus are stacked 
in boxes and are not organized by date. Call 202-357-3270. 
</P>
<P>
 -- New York Public Library, 42nd St. and 5th Ave., New York, N.Y. 10018. With 
25,000 menus in boxes and folders, this may be one of the country's larger 
collections. It dates from the 1870s and includes many from hotel restaurants, 
steamships and trains. The collection also includes dinners honoring the 
country's first astronauts. Call 212-930-0575. 
</P>
<P>
 -- New York Historical Society, 170 Central Park West, New York, N.Y. 10024. 
The NYHS collection dates from the mid-1800s to mid-1900s. Aside from 
restaurant menus, many are from private banquets. NYHS has had its menu 
collection on display in the past but not currently. The collection, however, 
is open for research by the public. Call 212-873-3400. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cornell School of Hotel Administration Library, Cornell University, Ithaca, 
N.Y. 14854. This collection of 10,000 menus consists of two main components. 
About half are from the donated collection of Oscar Tschirky, the famous chef 
at New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel around the turn of the century. It consists 
of menus from the 1850s to the 1930s, including one from the dinner honoring 
explorer Frederick Cook upon his return from the North Pole. (It was a catered 
affair for 1,500 at the Staten Island Ferry Terminal). 
</P>
<P>
The other half of Cornell's collection consists of menus from the 1920s to the 
'40s, gathered by the university. Cornell is currently updating its collection 
and is cataloguing information on computer database. Call 607-255-3673. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Margaret Woodbury Strong Museum, 1 Manhattan Square, Rochester, N.Y. 14607. 
This small collection of 100 menus dates back to the 1840s and includes menus 
from resort hotels along the East Coast and anniversary dinners from 
organizations such as the Masons and the Grange. The collection is fully 
catalogued on a computer database. Call 716-263-2700.

MENUS MEET CALORIC NEEDS OF THE AGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONI TIPTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many people assume that dining in old age means lots of applesauce, mashed 
potatoes and pureed meat. 
</P>
<P>
This is simply not the case. 
</P>
<P>
It is true that as we age our bodies becomes less efficent at performing what 
were once considered normal tasks. Still, many elderly people are capable of 
living very much as they did when they were 10 or even 20 years younger. And, 
says Gail Frank, professor of nutrition at Cal State Long Beach, food can 
continue to be a source of comfort. "The good life is possible as we age," she 
says, "but we must be wise about what we eat." 
</P>
<P>
There is a paradox that comes with aging. As we grow older, our metabolism 
slows down tremendously so that the amount of food we require for fuel 
declines. At the same time, nutrient needs increase. 
</P>
<P>
While a daily intake of 1,400 calories might be considered a reducing diet for 
a 25-year-old woman, for her 70-year-old mother it would be nothing more than a 
standard diet. This makes it particularly difficult for seniors to get all the 
nutrients they need. For example, many older people eat diets deficient in 
calcium, and inadequate calcium is a leading cause of deficiency-related deaths 
in elderly women. 
</P>
<P>
To increase the amount of calcium in the diet, Frank recommends using nonfat 
dry milk as an extender in meat patties, turkey burgers, mashed potates, 
casseroles and baked goods. 
</P>
<P>
Stirring milk solids into fluid milk will boost the calcium content of the 
beverage for drinking and for cooking. Use 1/2 cup nonfat dry milk solids for 
every 2 cups milk. 
</P>
<P>
Digestion can be a problem as we grow older: Increasing the frequency of meals 
is one way to relieve this. Frequent meals can also help with constipation, 
another complaint. 
</P>
<P>
"Several small feedings are more appropriate than large meals," said Frank. "It 
may be better to have three small meals and three moderate snacks -- half a 
protien-rich sandwich, cooked fruit, dairy product and starch or low sugar 
dessert. And they should be spaced so that every four hours there is something 
coming into the stomach. This way, intestine and (digestive) juices aren't 
overwhelmed with a large volume of food. Plus, they have a smaller amount (of 
food) to interract with. This aids the absorption." 
</P>
<P>
In general, menus designed to meet the nutrient and physiological needs of the 
older adult can be similar to those selected for growing children, said Dr. 
Loren Lipson, chief of Geriatric Medicine, USC School of Medicine. He and Frank 
both agree that older adults, like growing teens, can benefit from a 
multivitamin supplement. It can make up for nutrient loss due to absorption 
problems, intake decline and drug interractions. 
</P>
<P>
"Consider current physical state," Frank said. "If older people are not able to 
manipulate or chew as well then we must alter the texture but we should still 
maintain the nutrient density (of the foods they eat). The elder person has to 
realize and accept that he may have to go to steamed or chopped foods more 
often . . . but eating is one of the areas in their lives where they can still 
maintain control." 
</P>
<P>
Here are three days of menus adapted from the Phase 1 eating plan outlined in 
the book "The New American Diet" by Sonja L. Connor, a registered dietitian and 
William E. Connor, MD (Simon and Schuster: $12.95). The plan features a 
cholesterol intake of about 300 of 350 milligrams per day. Fat content is 
around 35%. Carbohydrates are increased in the diet to fill in for fat and 
provide extra fiber.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: MINIMALIST MARISCOS: STEP INTO THE COCTEL ROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What do we mean when we talk about restaurant minimalism? Do we mean the carpet 
showroom high-gloss-enameled into a chic cafe, or the artfully arranged snippet 
of chive that speaks volumes about its arranger's taste and refinement? Do we 
mean the small trapezoid of poached cod posed with three daikon sprouts in the 
middle of a vast Swid Powell plate? Or do we mean the secret restaurant above 
Malibu that will serve you anything you want, as long as what you want is steak 
and clams? How about sushi? Does that count? 
</P>
<P>
Just west of downtown, the Mexican fish restaurant Ostioneria Colima is as 
minimal as they come, with a menu nobody's ever consulted, an interior nobody's 
designed and a building that barely exists. Colima's "dining room" consists of 
a sort of lean-to behind the kitchen, made out of a sheet of corrugated 
plastic, bamboo curtains and some poles, like a makeshift palapa you might find 
sheltering a family on some deserted Yucatan beach. A faded lobster is painted 
on one wall, a marlin on another. When it rains, you get wet. 
</P>
<P>
When you slip into Colima from the parking lot, you seat yourself at one of a 
half a dozen picnic tables, positioning yourself closer to either a speaker 
blasting Mexican disco near the front or the thrumming racket of a massive 
condenser motor, depending on your musical preference. It's a perfect spot to 
kill a hot Saturday afternoon, slurping fresh Mexican oysters -- only $8 a 
dozen -- and drinking cold cans of Tecate from the supermarket next door. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody in the place will be eating cocteles, big goblets of shrimp or 
octopus or (canned) abalone marinating in the traditional sauce of catsup, 
water and chopped onion. A waiter will bring crackers and show you how to dose 
your coctel with lime and still more catsup -- he has a special fluttery 
technique for speeding the flow from a Heinz bottle. 
</P>
<P>
The ritual is fun, but his concoction serves mainly to hide the good, fresh 
taste of the seafood. Chase your beer with tostadas de ceviche instead, thick, 
fried corn tortillas spread with a chopped salad of marinated raw fish, onion 
and shredded carrot, sharp with the tang of vinegar, mellow with toasted corn, 
sweetly fishy in an extremely pleasant way, dusted with fresh cilantro -- it 
goes with Tecate the way Roquefort goes with Sauternes. 
</P>
<P>
Order the half-lobster, and the waiter will lean over and whisper 
confidentially, "You know, it will take 20 minutes, this lobster." What he 
doesn't tell you is that it will be frying all that time. 
</P>
<P>
When it finally arrives, it is like lobster jerky, permanently welded to its 
shell. (As one particularly stubborn bit of meat finally yielded, I had been 
using such force that it flew, attached shell fragment and all, clear across 
the dining room, nearly missing the skull of a burly garage mechanic at another 
table.) The flesh is as tough as a rawhide chew toy -- which, if my experiences 
in the lobster houses of Puerto Nuevo can be viewed as typical, is undoubtedly 
authentic. Still, the lobster is really tasty, full of sweet, briny flavor, and 
it comes with a dip that resembles what gets squirted on your popcorn in 
second-run movie houses. You'll probably hate it; I found it something of a 
guilty pleasure. And the curry-yellow rice and soupy stewed beans that come 
along with entrees here are terrific. 
</P>
<P>
Shrimp soup and fish soup are just OK here, heavy with the potatoey taste of 
overcooked vegetables. Order instead camarones rancheros, the best entree, and 
you'll get a dozen meaty shrimp sauteed with crisp green peppers, swimming in a 
light, buttery tomato sauce touched with garlic. The dish is a little rustic, 
folk-arty, a version of the minimalist kind of thing Angeli's Evan Kleiman 
might scour fishing villages for if she specialized in Mexico instead of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
And that's about it for the Ostioneria, whose menu is, after all, extremely 
minimal . . . but so is the tab. The only beverages available are Coke, 7-up 
and a sickly yellow fluid the counterguy called, appropriately, "pineapple 
water." BYOB.

 Ostioneria Colima, 1465 W. Third St., Los Angeles, (213) 482-4152. Open seven 
days, 11:30 a.m.-9 p.m. Cash only. Lot parking. No alcohol. Lunch for two, food

'MOTHER' GIVES MANUFACTURED FOODS A MEMORABLE, HOMEMADE TOUCH; 
</P>
<P>
MARKETING: INDUSTRY EXPERTS SAY IMAGES OF MOTHERHOOD EVOKE WARM FEELINGS THAT 
HELP SELL THEIR PRODUCTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE E. MAYER, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's no place like home and no cooking like Mom's. Whether it was a 
double-rich chocolate cake or a burned batch of canned hash, mother's culinary 
capers usually evoke warm feelings -- or at least amusing memories. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask the makers of mother's macaroons, Mom's Apple Pie and Mama's Goodies 
-- three of literally hundreds of products that are labeled with some form of 
the word mother to convey a special home-quality goodness. 
</P>
<P>
The use of mother in the name conveys a "home-cooked feeling, something 
old-fashioned," says Kay V. Porter, owner of mother's macaroons. 
</P>
<P>
That's one reason Porter -- whose business cards prominently note that her 
cookies are "handmade with love" -- decided to keep the name "mother's 
macaroons" when she expanded her business by opening a small bakery in 
Arlington a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, she planned to call it Harrison Street Bakery to reflect her 
diversification into muffins, cookies, pies and other homey baked goods. But 
after a few months she changed the name back to mother's macaroons, not only to 
feature her star item but also to convey the cozy atmosphere and down-home 
quality that is attracting an increasingly loyal following to her bakery. 
</P>
<P>
"The imagery of mother is as good as it comes," says Clive Chajet, chairman of 
Lippincott &amp; Margulies, a New York identification and image-consultant 
firm. "The word stirs up the image of warm, loving and caring, good quality and 
homemade. It's a symbol in the American culture of everything that's good." 
</P>
<P>
That's not to say that the products with "mom" on their label are necessarily 
better than others. Some are; many are not. It's just like mom's cooking -- 
some mothers do it better than others. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the image of motherhood is so attractive that companies large and 
small find it hard to pass up -- from Mama's Goodies, operating out of a garage 
in Manassas, Va., to Quaker Oats Co., which sells its grain products to natural 
food stores under the "Mother's" label. All these firms are seeking to defy the 
cautionary words of 20th-Century novelist Nelson Algren, who warned, "Never eat 
at a place called Mom's, never play poker with a man named Doc." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone knows that necessity is the mother of invention; in the case of the 
Herndon, Va.-based Mom's Apple Pie, however, it was motherhood that prompted 
the invention of the name. 
</P>
<P>
It all began eight years ago with a flippant remark by the company's founder, 
Avis Renshaw. She and her husband, Steven Cox, had been selling hot fresh apple 
pies to the Reston Farm Market for some time. Every time Renshaw delivered the 
pies, the owner complained that they didn't have a name. " 'You've got to have 
a name for your product,' he kept telling us," Renshaw recalls. "I was very 
pregnant at the time with my second child. Finally, I just looked at my stomach 
and said, 'Fine. Call it Mom's Apple Pie,' The name ended up sticking." 
</P>
<P>
Today the company has grown from a home-kitchen enterprise into a $1 million 
business with a 9,000-square-foot bakery -- complete with a reconditioned pie 
assembly line from a bakery in Iowa and a dough-mixing machine once used in 
Mrs. Smith's pie factory. Between 500 and 2,000 pies (in 26 different flavors) 
are made daily, with the most made in October; the least in the winter. An 
additional 500 to 1,000 loaves of sunflower bread are turned out daily. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, Renshaw believes the company's name was appropriate. "It worked 
out kind of nicely because the business is like a kid; you nurse it along until 
it can take care of itself." Renshaw, 31, should know. She has four children; 
the youngest, 2-year-old Tyson, likes to spend much of his day riding his 
tricycle around the plant and playing hide-and-seek among the 50-pound bags of 
flour. 
</P>
<P>
More often than not, however, there is no real mother standing behind the name. 
Porter, for instance, never met the mother of macaroon fame. She bought the 
business four years ago from a secretary-turned-baker who had used her mother's 
macaroon recipe to start up the company. Porter bought the company -- its name, 
recipe and wholesale accounts -- and started to expand. In addition to its 
bakery and increased line of goods, mother's macaroons now has 60 wholesale 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Amena Rahman is not the mom of Just Like Mom's bakery in Reston. An 
Afghanistan refugee who came to the United States nine years ago, Rahman is the 
third owner of the small old-fashioned bakery that specializes in apple 
fritters and doughnuts. "I liked the name so I kept it," she says. "It makes 
people come in and feel like they are in their own home." 
</P>
<P>
There is a mother, however, behind Mama's Goodies. Brenda and John Bolling had 
wanted to start a business in their Manassas home and baking seemed a natural. 
After all, Brenda Bolling had been baking for a school cafeteria in Manassas, 
Va., for 15 years and, as she puts it, "yeast is in my blood." 
</P>
<P>
When it came to naming the business, it was their daughter, then 19, who came 
up with the title. "It was what I had always done -- baking goodies," Brenda 
Bolling, 47, says. Initially, "I didn't think I would like it. It made me feel 
like I was an older woman" when her customers called her Mama. "Now I don't 
mind it a bit." 
</P>
<P>
Corporate name experts such as Chajet say that Mother may not always be the 
best name. For one thing, given the large number of companies that have mother 
in their names, a business "may end up sharing its identification with any 
number of brands," Chajet says. 
</P>
<P>
The name Mom's Apple Pie for instance, is not as distinct as Mrs. Fields or 
Famous Amos. "So additional money will be needed to promote" a product, Chajet 
adds. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps of even more significance in this day of consumer cynicism, the very 
name "mother" may produce an effect opposite to what was intended. "Consumers 
are a little too sophisticated to believe the suggestion that there is actually 
a mother who stands behind the goodness and purity of a product," comments Ira 
N. Bachrach, president of NameLab, a name-consulting firm in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Renshaw found that out when she was delivering pies to Safeway two years ago. 
As she was unloading the baked goods, she overheard a man say, "it's probably 
just another general ruse by General Foods. There's not really a mom." As 
Renshaw recalls it, she went up to the man and said, "No you're wrong, I'm the 
mom. My husband and I really do this." 
</P>
<P>
Disbelieving,the man went away. Perhaps it was the way Renshaw looks -- tall, 
slender and more often than not clad in blue jeans. "People expect a plump 
50-year-old woman with a smile on her face." But the man returned a few minutes 
later. " 'You're serious, aren't you?' he said. He went back in and bought a 
pie." 
</P>
<P>
If the name "mother" works, how much better could "grandmother" be? That's what 
Rhonda Oh will find out as she steps up her sales of "Nana's Shortbread." 
</P>
<P>
A cardiology nurse, Oh began selling her shortbread -- made according to her 
Scottish grandmother's recipe -- last Christmas after her friends urged her to 
go into business. Initially sales were to corporations and professionals for 
use as gifts to clients and colleagues during the holidays. Now, the New 
Zealand-born Oh is starting to sell the melt-in-your-mouth buttery biscuits in 
local stores, including Sutton Place Gourmet and Bradley Food &amp; Beverage. 
</P>
<P>
The name of the product was a given from the day she went into business, Oh 
says. "It was my grandmother's recipe and all my life I have always called it 
Nana's shortbread. I just didn't feel I could change the name." 
</P>
<P>
Successful or not, the 35-year-old Oh will nonetheless soon find out the true 
meaning of motherhood. She is expecting her first baby.

THE HOMECOOK: FORTUNE SMILES ON LETTUCE, NOODLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARION CUNNINGHAMOne of the most rewarding times in the life of a homecook 
is the moment when you combine ingredients and they suddenly come together with 
spirit and compatibility. Like love, this indefinable marriage of taste and 
texture defies explanati 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This week we introduce a new bimonthly column by Marion Cunningham, America's 
most beloved homecook. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Los Angeles, Cunningham married her childhood sweetheart, raised 
two children and never left the state of California until she was 45. 
</P>
<P>
It was then that she was given her first airplane ticket and the chance to go 
to Portland to cook with James Beard. She ultimately became his assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 When Beard was later asked who could revise the "Fanny Farmer Cookbook," he 
suggested Cunningham. She spent four years writing the 12th revision and then 
wrote the "Fanny Farmer Baking Book." Two years ago she published "The 
Breakfast Book." She has just completed an entirely new revision of Fanny 
Farmer, and has started work on "The Supper Book." 
</P>
<P>
 What makes Cuningham so refreshing is her very American take on cooking. She's 
a great cook who makes simple, tasty food. She's the mother we all wish we had 
-- her cupboard is full of cookies and there's something wonderful on her 
table, every night, for dinner.

YOU ASKED ABOUT: PRETREAMENT FOR FRUIT DEHYDRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Can you tell me what I should dip or soak fruit in before I dry it in 
my dehydrator? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: According to the Master Food Preserver Manual of the University of 
California Cooperative Extension Common Ground Garden Program, "To prevent 
darkening and loss of Vitamin C, most fruits need pretreatment before drying. 
Sulfuring is the preferred pretreatment. Blanching in steam or in boiling water 
is an alternate pretreatment. 
</P>
<P>
"Sulfuring -- exposing fruit to sulfur fumes -- helps preserve color and retain 
Vitamin C and makes a more pliable product due to retention of additional 
moisture. Sulfuring does cause a considerable loss of thiamine. Because fruits 
are a major source of Vitamin C but contain little thiamine, the overall 
nutritional effect of sulfuring is positive. Blanching gives a darker, less 
nutritious product than does sulfuring." 
</P>
<P>
The guide does warn, however: "Never dry sulfured fruits in the oven because of 
the objectionable odor of sulfur fumes." 
</P>
<P>
Complete instructions for sulfuring fruit are given in leaflet 2785, "Drying 
Foods at Home" available for $1.75 from ANR Publications, University of 
California, 6701 San Pablo Ave., Oakland, Calif. 94608-1239. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What is the difference between fresh and dry bread crumbs? And how is each 
type made? 
</P>
<P>
A: According to "How Cooking Works" (Macmillan, 1981) by Sylvia Rosenthal and 
Fran Shinagel, "Both fresh and dry crumbs are made by processing or blending 
bread in a food processor or blender until fine. Fresh bread crumbs are made 
from fresh bread that is slightly dried out. If the bread is too fresh, the 
crumbs may be gummy. Bread that is two to four days old is generally 
satisfactory. Don't use stale bread, for stale bread will give you 
stale-tasting crumbs. For dry bread crumbs, crisp the bread on a baking sheet 
in a 250-degree oven. Some or all of the crusts may be used for either the 
fresh or the dry crumbs. Cut the bread into cubes before processing or 
blending. 
</P>
<P>
"Store the crumbs in a tightly closed plastic bag or covered container in the 
refrigerator. If you must keep them for more than a short period of time, store 
them in the freezer to prevent mold. An average slice of white bread will yield 
about one-half cup of fresh bread crumbs; a slice of dry bread will yield 
one-quarter to one-third cup dry bread crumbs." 
</P>
<P>
Q: I've purchased unrefrigerated jumbo eggs from stores at the same price that 
some supermarkets sell small eggs. A friend says these less expensive eggs are 
as nutritious as the others because eggs may be kept up to six months. Just how 
long do eggs keep and how long is their nutritional value retained? 
</P>
<P>
A: Publications from the American Egg Board state that freshness of eggs is 
determined by how recently an egg was laid, the temperature and humidity at 
which it is stored and how it is handled. "These variables are so important 
that an egg one week old, held under ideal conditions, can be fresher than an 
egg left at room temperature for one day." 
</P>
<P>
According to the board, "The ideal conditions (for egg storage) are 
temperatures that don't go above 40 degrees and a relative humidity of 70% to 
80%. Fresh shell eggs can be stored in their carton in the refrigerator for at 
least four to five weeks. Grade quality losses should be insignificant if the 
eggs are refrigerated as soon as possible after purchase from a refrigerated 
case. 
</P>
<P>
"As an egg ages, the white becomes thinner and the yolk becomes flatter. These 
changes do not have any great effect on the nutritional quality of the egg or 
its functional cooking properties in recipes. Appearance may be affected, 
though. When poached or fried, the fresher the egg, the more it will hold its 
shape rather than spread out in the pan. On the other hand, if you hard cook 
eggs that are at least a week old, you'll find them easier to peel after 
cooking and cooling than fresher eggs."

BACK TO BASICS: EASY-TO-MAKE SESAME DRESSING SPICES UP SALADS WITH FLAVORS OF

Although there are many different types of uncooked salad dressings, all are 
emulsions -- combinations of two liquids that don't blend together naturally. 
Depending on their stability, these oil and aqueous mixtures are classified as 
temporary, semipermanent or permanent. 
</P>
<P>
Vinaigrette dressing is a good example of a temporary emulsion, which separates 
quickly into two layers and must be vigorously shaken before each use to 
uniformly distribute the ingredients. This agitation breaks the oil into 
droplets and suspends them for a short period of time in the acidic vinegar or 
lemon juice. 
</P>
<P>
Semipermanent emulsions are more viscous, with a consistency of heavy cream or 
honey. The oil droplets remain suspended for a few days in these pourable 
dressings. Should separation occur, the emulsion may be reformed by stirring. 
</P>
<P>
Mayonnaise is a classic example of a permanent oil-in-water emulsion. In this 
category of dressings an emulsifying agent, usually egg yolk, coats the oil 
droplets and prevents the mixtures from separating into layers. 
</P>
<P>
Sesame Dressing, a semipermanent emulsion, is easily prepared in an electric 
blender. Place the soy sauce (Step 1), lemon juice, honey, ginger and sesame 
seeds in a blender container and process (Step 2) about 10 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Combine the sesame and vegetable oils and slowly add to the blender container 
with the machine running (Step 3). The mixture will begin to thicken, however, 
if the oil is added too quickly, this emulsion will break down and separate. 
</P>
<P>
The completed dressing should be smooth, pour easily (Step 4) and remain intact 
for a few days. 
</P>
<P>
SESAME DRESSING

PERRIER'S BACK IN PROMOTIONAL BLITZ; 
</P>
<P>
FOOD SAFETY: DESPITE SCREENING, QUESTIONS REMAIN ABOUT THE SAFETY AND PURITY OF 
ALL BOTTLED WATERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Perrier, the sparkling water that was voluntarily recalled in February for 
traces of benzene contamination, is returning to the American market with a 
nine-city promotional blitz. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, Perrier should be available nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"Unequivocally, at this time Perrier is the most stringently tested bottled 
water sold anywhere in the world," says Kim E. Jeffery, senior vice president 
for sales and marketing of the Perrier Group of America, who is touring the 
United States to regain consumer confidence in the product. "We are doing much 
more frequent testing as well as backup quality control." 
</P>
<P>
But despite the everything-is-OK public relations effort, politicians and 
regulators are questioning whether bottled water is as safe and as pure as the 
image the Madison Avenue promoters have created. Even the International Bottled 
Water Assn., a trade association that represents 85% of the industry, including 
Perrier, is asking the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for stricter testing 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and 
Investigations for the Committee on Energy and Commerce, is considering holding 
public hearings on the bottled water industry's marketing and quality control 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
The concerns: 
</P>
<P>
It took six months to discover that Perrier was contaminated with traces of 
benzene, a chemical known to cause cancer in animals. Although bottled water is 
supposed to be inspected by state and federal officials, the contamination was 
discovered by a North Carolina laboratory that was using Perrier as a standard 
of purity in tests for municipal water quality. 
</P>
<P>
The incident also brought into question Perrier's use of "naturally sparkling" 
-- a description the FDA called misleading because the water is not carbonated 
(it comes from the spring). The water and the carbon dioxide from a natural gas 
reservoir beneath the spring are combined in the factory after impurities from 
the gas, including benzene, are filtered out. New labels, required after July 
30, will say "Natural Mineral Water" and explain that the carbonation is taken 
from a naturally occurring source deep within the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Although the company agreed to change its labeling, Jeffery maintains that the 
original labeling was not misleading. FDA never defined "naturally sparkling," 
he says, and Perrier's use of the term complies with European definitions. 
</P>
<P>
But Dingell's letter to the other regulating agency, the Federal Trade 
Commission, says that Perrier's new wording may still be misleading. He has 
asked the FTC to provide information on how the agency has handled the 
company's labeling and advertising practices. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, he has asked the Food and Drug Administration to answer specific 
questions on the Perrier incident and general questions on the regulation and 
inspection of the $2.6 billion-a-year bottled water industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes raising questions and getting people to answer is beneficial even if 
there are no hearings," said a spokesman for the energy and commerce committee. 
"The agencies will go back and ask the same questions." 
</P>
<P>
The FDA already has begun asking questions. 
</P>
<P>
"As a result of the Perrier incident a lot of questions that have been raised, 
we are in the process of issuing a program survey to pick up samples of 
domestic and imported bottled water," says Allen Halper, assistant to the 
director in FDA's Division of Regulatory Guidance. "We will be looking at (the 
samples) biologically and chemically and will be reviewing the labels." 
</P>
<P>
FDA does not routinely screen bottled water for purity and officials said that 
they could not give figures on the percentage of bottled water that is tested 
each year. Typically, samples of bottled water are picked up only if the agency 
has received consumer complaints or if questionable practices are discovered 
during routine plant inspections. 
</P>
<P>
Bottled waters are required to pass the same general purity requirements as tap 
water, including tests for a series of substances from arsenic to zinc. But 
these tests do not screen for other toxic substances, including benzene. 
</P>
<P>
"They are minimum quality standards, not levels of safety," Halper says. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, mineral water products, including Perrier, do not have to comply with 
these standards. Although the agency had intended to issue separate mineral 
water standards in the 1970s, priorities and resources changed, according to 
Halper. 
</P>
<P>
But lack of standards doesn't mean the FDA is helpless if a mineral water is 
contaminated or unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
"The law says the agency can take action if we find a poisonous or deleterious 
substance in any food and that includes mineral water," Halper says. 
</P>
<P>
How well the bottled water standards are enforced is often left up to the 
states. 
</P>
<P>
But critics are concerned. As consumption of bottled water grows, more and more 
states are considering the federal standards inadequate and are adopting 
regulations based on the model code of the International Bottled Water Assn. 
This model code includes standards for mineral water as well as maximum levels 
for benzene, vinyl chloride and carbon tetrachloride, contaminants not included 
in the FDA regulations. 
</P>
<P>
California, New York and Florida are among the 13 states that have adopted the 
International Bottled Water Assn. model code, with Arizona and New Jersey in 
the rule-making process. Another 13 states are considering the stricter 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
The trade association petitioned the FDA in 1979, 1983 and 1988 to set 
standards for mineral water and to expand current regulations with more 
stringent requirements for labels, contaminant testing and good manufacturing 
practices. William Deal, vice president of the trade association, says that he 
hopes the Perrier incident will provide impetus so that the FDA adopts stricter 
standards. Perrier also supports the more stringent standards. 
</P>
<P>
"Bottled water is a growing industry and we feel that the consumer must have 
protection," Deal says. "We feel that bottled water should exceed the standards 
for the public water supply. The problem is the federal government has not seen 
it to be an important issue."

FOOD BRIEFS: B.Y.O.B. . . . BAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Several U.S. firms are hoping that increased environmental awareness will 
prompt American shoppers to take a hint from their European counterparts and 
switch to cloth or vinyl reusable grocery bags. 
</P>
<P>
The sacks are being marketed by as many as 10 different firms in a rainbow of 
colors, fabrics, and can be emblazoned with any corporate logo. 
</P>
<P>
The average consumer uses and disposes of about 500 paper or plastic grocery 
bags annually, according to industry estimates. And as many as 34 billion such 
bags are distributed by supermarkets each year. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers of the cloth bags hope to persuade the public that, although the 
totes are costly, the money spent on them can be considered an investment in 
the environment. Proponents claim that the cloth sacks hold two to three times 
as much as paper or plastic grocery bags. 
</P>
<P>
Several such products were on display at a recent food industry gathering. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, the most interesting product name comes from Low Technologies Inc., 
which markets the Neither Bag, which is made from 100% cotton and has two cloth 
handles. The St. Petersburg, Fla.-based firm's slogan: "Paper of plastic? Just 
say . . . Neither!" 
</P>
<P>
Priority Earth Co., of Studio City, also offers a reuseable canvas bag under 
the name of "Groce Tote." Two Southern California supermarket chains, Gelson's 
and Mrs. Gooch's, now have displays asking shoppers, "Paper, plastic or Groce 
Tote?" 
</P>
<P>
One of the more ambitious sales efforts is being launched by Create-A-Bag of 
Chicago. The company is marketing its duck canvas bags under the trademark 
"Re-Use. Part of the Solution" logo. The sacks are offered in seven colors and 
can carry a logo. 
</P>
<P>
Coverall of Worcester, Mass., takes a different tack in bag texture. The firm 
claims its Eco-Bag, made from vinyl, is the "bag of the Nineties that will 
last." One attractive aspect of Coverall's sales literature -- for grocers at 
least -- is a passage that claims supermarket firms can save "millions of 
dollars in bag costs" by selling Eco-Bag alongside paper and plastic. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their European cachet, reusual totes have raised some doubts in the 
supermarket industry. One retail executive said that the cloth bags may harbor 
dangerous bacteria from one shopping trip to another. Jeanne Wirka, of 
Environmental Action Foundation in Washington, took exception to such 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired of the supermarket industry raising the specter of contamination to 
maintain the status quo," she said, at the same time doubting that the cloth 
carriers will catch consumers' imagination. 
</P>
<P>
"Cloth bags are just not the way Americans bag groceries. And they're not 
widely available," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The proliferation of reuseable bags demonstrates that, among other things, 
there are few limits to manufacturers' attempt to get on the environmentalist 
bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
Cedar Fresh Products, of Norristown, Pa., announced last week that it was now 
selling the "world's first environmentally safe moth ball" made from 100% 
natural, aromatic cedar wood and not "common moth chemicals."

FOOD PHARMACY: A NUTTY ANSWER FOR CHOLESTEROL

Eating almonds may help curb high blood cholesterol. That's what Dr. Gene A. 
Spiller, a noted researcher and director of the Health Research and Studies 
Center in California, has found. 
</P>
<P>
In tests, he asked a group of men and women with fairly high blood cholesterol, 
averaging around 240 milligrams per deciliter, to eat 3 1/2 ounces of almonds a 
day for three to nine weeks. Other groups ate equal amounts of fat from cheese 
or olive oil. They all ate comparable amounts of grains, vegetables and fruits. 
</P>
<P>
The almond-eaters' cholesterol dropped from 10% to 15% compared to that of the 
cheese-eaters. The almonds also reduced cholesterol slightly better than olive 
oil did. 
</P>
<P>
It makes sense, says Spiller, because most of the fat in almonds and olive oil 
is the same type -- monounsaturated. If olive oil is good for the heart, as has 
been shown in much research, so is almond oil. There is a drawback. All fats 
are high in calories; 3 1/2 ounces of almonds has 636 calories. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Spiller does not advise eating that amount of almonds every day. His 
point is that it's OK to eat almonds instead of meat and dairy fats to help cut 
back on cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
Many people with ulcerative colitis, a serious inflammatory bowel disease, got 
better after taking fish-oil capsules for four months. So found Dr. William F. 
Stenson, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
In a test, 21 sufferers of ulcerative colitis first took plain vegetable-oil 
capsules, then fish-oil capsules, each for four months. They also took their 
usual medications. Before and after each diet, doctors examined the patients. 
This included doing a sigmoidoscopy in which physicians look inside the colon. 
</P>
<P>
The results: After taking fish oil, 15 patients improved, according to 
sigmoidoscopy scores. But two showed no changes, and four actually appeared 
worse. For all symptoms, doctors judged half of the patients improved, half the 
same and one worse. 
</P>
<P>
Stenson explains that fish oil seems to work in some people by reducing blood 
levels of an inflammatory agent called leukotriene B4. 
</P>
<P>
One caution, though. Consult a doctor before using fish-oil supplements to 
treat disease. You could unwittingly harm yourself with high doses. 
</P>
<P>
Want to infuse your blood with compounds believed to help ward off cancer and 
other chronic diseases? Eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day. 
</P>
<P>
That's what Dr. Phyllis Bowen at the University of Illinois at Chicago found 
when she and colleagues put women on a five-month experimental diet that 
included five fruits and/or vegetables a day, as recently recommended by a 
National Academy of Sciences Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Bowen says it was a surprise. But within a month, the women's blood levels of 
disease-fighting compounds called carotenoids (found in a variety of fruits and 
vegetables) had jumped dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
Blood concentrations of one compound, lycopene, tripled; lycopene is a red 
pigment in tomatoes and strawberries, linked to lower cancer rates, notably 
pancreatic cancer. Lutein levels, another reputed anti-cancer compound rich in 
tomatoes, nearly doubled. Blood amounts of beta carotene, too, more than 
doubled. Beta carotene, in carrots and green leafy vegetables like spinach, is 
thought to slash the odds of lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, said Bowen, most people don't get enough of these anti-disease 
carotenoids -- and one way to cure that quickly is by eating five fruits and 
vegetables a day.

STATE FINDS 48% RISE IN DROPOUTS SINCE 1986; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOLS: THE GLENDALE DISTRICT SAYS THE INCREASE FROM 12.9% TO 19.1% MAKES 
THINGS APPEAR WORSE THAN THEY ARE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T TAKE TRANSIENCY INTO 
ACCOUNT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Glendale school officials said a state report issued this week showing the 
district's high school dropout rate had jumped 48% in three years made things 
appear worse than they actually are. 
</P>
<P>
State figures released Monday showed that 19.1% of the Glendale Unified School 
District's class of 1989 dropped out of school, compared with 13.1% of the 
class of 1988 and 12.9% of the class of 1986. Despite the increase, last year's 
rate measured below the statewide average of 20.4%. The Los Angeles Unified 
School District improved its rate from 42.7% in 1986 to about 35% last year. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale's 19.1% dropout rate represents about 377 students, 123 more dropouts 
than in 1986. During the same period, district enrollment grew from nearly 
20,000 to 23,130. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 of the 377 dropouts in last year's class actually dropped out. The 
remaining 177 or so left the district and never had their records requested by 
another district or notified officials about where they were going, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the district provided the data used by the state, the figures do 
not accurately reflect the number of students dropping out of Glendale schools, 
said Gary Hess, the district's director of student services. 
</P>
<P>
Hess, who said he was "very surprised" by the figures, is reviewing each high 
school's records. 
</P>
<P>
"We will admit we have 9.6% of that graduating class in 1989 who left before 
they were 18, left without a high school diploma or left without passing the 
California proficiency exam," Hess said. 
</P>
<P>
"All the state of California uses the same criteria, so I have to accept that 
our dropout rate has increased 48% over the last three years," he added. "But 
the penalty is the image. And we maintain that the image isn't as bad as it 
appears." 
</P>
<P>
The state measures the dropout rate by calculating how many students entered 
the 10th grade and left high school without a diploma or its equivalent by the 
end of the 12th grade. A school has 45 days to track a student who leaves its 
campus. If it cannot, the youth is recorded as a dropout -- even if the student 
enrolled elsewhere and did not notify or request grades and other records from 
the district he or she left, Hess said. 
</P>
<P>
Because it is unlikely that the new school would not request the student's 
records, a lack of notification is interpreted to mean that a student has 
dropped out, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not necessarily the fault of a school that they have a high dropout rate 
if things like transiency are the cause of it," said Susie Lange, a spokeswoman 
for the state Department of Education. "They have no control if a kid is yanked 
out of school. But if a student's records weren't requested, there's a good 
chance they dropped out. It's important to be accurate about where these kids 
are." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale officials said the number of students moving in and out of Glendale 
each year is rising -- about 40% of the district's 24,000 students last year 
moved into and left the city -- and that group is difficult to track. 
</P>
<P>
Transiency rates have risen in part because of the growing number of new 
apartments in Glendale, which has allowed more mobility, Hess said. There were 
nearly 35,800 apartments and condominium units in 1986; today, there are nearly 
42,600, said Keith Palmer, a senior planner for the city. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some youths are foreign students who return to their countries, 
where their schools do not request records or notify the district, Hess said. 
</P>
<P>
"With students moving around at such a high rate, it's not uncommon that their 
records aren't requested," said Vic Pallos, a district spokesman. "If a student 
is a no-show, there is an attempt to follow up by contacting the last known 
address or phone number. If no student is there and no indication is given of 
the whereabouts of the family, there's not much we can do." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Unified schools also have high transiency rates -- as much as 70% 
-- that make it difficult to track students. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a matter of tracking," said Pete Martinez, coordinator of the Los Angeles 
district's dropout prevention office. "We're constantly advising our people to 
follow the paper trail. But we don't dispel the validity of the state's 
figures. It's a benchmark we use that tells us we're losing youngsters." 
</P>
<P>
Hess said the Glendale district will attempt next year to monitor the rate more 
closely by requesting specific information about where students are moving and 
the new schools they will attend. It also will continue a prevention program 
that locates dropouts who have remained in the Glendale area and encourages 
them to return to school, he said.

LANDMARKS: SOME HOMEOWNERS OBJECT TO A DRIVE TO LABEL THEIR STONE HOUSES AS 
HISTORIC. BUT OTHERS SAY THE DESIGNATION WILL ENSURE THEIR SURVIVAL.

A campaign to designate Glendale's stone houses as city landmarks has run into 
trouble because many owners believe the plan will undermine their property 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Muriello, who has spearheaded the preservation drive, said Monday that 
she hopes city planners can resolve such concerns and ensure the survival of 
the unique dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
"The people have raised objections out of fear," she said. "If they're not 
sure, they say no. Perhaps the next step is to provide stone home owners with 
detailed information about what is involved. I think people will be less 
leery." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Muriello urged the Glendale City Council to protect the city's stone 
houses, fearing a bulldozer might someday demolish the architectural 
curiosities, built mainly in the 1920s and 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
By designating such houses -- many of which are in the part of La Crescenta 
within the Glendale city limits -- as historic landmarks, the city could stop a 
property owner from tearing one down to make room for a more modern house, 
Muriello said. 
</P>
<P>
"Who would ever build another house like this?" Muriello asked, referring to 
her own La Crescenta stone house. "Who would ever take the time to go stone by 
stone and build a house like this? They're irreplaceable." 
</P>
<P>
She made her plea to the Glendale City Council shortly after city officials had 
applied for a $2,000 state grant to conduct a citywide survey of stone houses. 
As part of the survey, the city recently sent letters to about 20 stone-house 
owners, asking whether they favor a landmark designation for their homes. 
</P>
<P>
The early returns indicate that some stone-home owners do not share Muriello's 
interest in city protection. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of those who responded in writing rejected the idea. Two owners 
also attended last week's Historic Preservation Commission meeting and 
complained that the city is putting them between the proverbial rock and a hard 
place. 
</P>
<P>
The owners said they want to preserve their distinctive dwellings but fear that 
landmark status will entangle them in red tape when they try to modify or sell 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"If it wasn't for the government intrusion, I'd be delighted with such a 
thing," said Bertrand Murphy, who owns a 64-year-old stone house in Glenmore 
Canyon. Murphy, an interior decorator, said he doesn't want the city to dictate 
the design of any addition to his house. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't mind advice, but I don't need someone less competent than me 
deciding what I can put on my house," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy has other concerns. 
</P>
<P>
He questioned whether landmark status might hamper a prospective buyer from 
getting a loan on a stone house. In addition, Murphy, 67, is worried that city 
officials might deny him permission to install an elevator when he can no 
longer climb the 46 steps leading to his front door. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk MacDonald, whose grandfather built some of the stone houses in La 
Crescenta, also told the commission that a historic designation would lead to 
unwelcome government interference in decisions regarding his La Crescenta home. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Ogdon, a city planner, said the challenge now is to resolve some of the 
concerns expressed by the current stone-house owners. 
</P>
<P>
He said landmark status would not prevent an owner from making changes in a 
home. But he said the city would work with the property owner to ensure that 
the original character of the dwelling is preserved. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale officials have the authority to impose protective landmark status on a 
building without the owner's consent, but Ogdon said, "In 99% of the cases, the 
city is going to respect the wishes of the property owner." 
</P>
<P>
He said city officials hope to meet with owners of the stone houses soon to 
answer questions about the impact of a landmark designation. 
</P>
<P>
"Our philosophy is that we want the people themselves to preserve these 
places," said Vonnie Rossman, chairman of the Historic Preservation Commission. 
"I think we'll have the majority of the people who will be interested in saving 
them. They're a cultural jewel." 
</P>
<P>
History buffs and building experts say the homes, distinguished by walls made 
of rugged stones and mortar, would be too costly to build today. In most cases, 
they were built of stones collected on the property, with little attention to 
future significance. 
</P>
<P>
"They just thought architecturally, they made a nice house," said Roderick 
MacDonald, whose father, Rory, developed La Crescenta's Highway Highlands 
tract, which includes many of the remaining stone homes. "They built a 
wood-frame house and veneered the stones on the outside." 
</P>
<P>
He said the stone construction provides good insulation and is durable. 
</P>
<P>
"They haven't shaken down in any of our earthquakes," MacDonald said. "They 
have lost a few chimneys, but I don't know of any stone-house walls that have 
shaken down." 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, these buildings are significant," said David L. Smith, president of 
the Glendale Historical Society, which is urging the city to grant protection 
to many of the city's older houses. 
</P>
<P>
Although they may be divided over whether the houses should have landmark 
status, the owners appear to be united in their affection for the unusual 
dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Muriello said it was a case of love at first sight when she and her 
husband, Joseph, bought their stone house in 1986. "We saw it from the street 
and said, 'That's our house,' " she recalled. "We're kind of nostalgic. We like 
houses with character." 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Daly said she and her husband, Bryan, were responding to a vague real 
estate ad when they found their new home in the 1500 block of Kenneth Road. 
"When we saw it was a stone house, we fell in love with it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the dwellings do not appeal to all home hunters. Real estate agent Rocky 
Williams, who represents the owners of a stone house on 4th Avenue in La 
Crescenta, said it is priced at $305,000 -- slightly less than some 
similar-sized but more modern houses in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said he tells prospective buyers about the city's preservation plan to 
enhance their interest. "The way we've been advertising is that it is a 
possible historical landmark," he said. "I think they would take pride in 
that."

PLAN TO CREATE PARK ON SCHOOLYARD FIZZLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A last-minute attempt to turn part of a Los Feliz private school campus into an 
urban park faltered this week after two Los Angeles city councilmen said the 
city could not help finance the effort. 
</P>
<P>
Without city aid, the sale of the entire property is all but certain, school 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Feliz Hills School administrators and neighboring residents were trying to 
garner city funds to buy part of the Russell Avenue campus in an effort to 
create a park and help the school fight off bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, residents have said they fear that if the campus is sold to a 
developer a high-density apartment or condominium complex could end up on the 
property, increasing traffic and congestion in the area. 
</P>
<P>
An offer by another school for the property could be accepted this week, said 
Phyllis Lake, a real estate broker representing the property. She would not 
identify the potential buyer because the sale still is being negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
Lake said she has received offers from several groups that want to continue 
using the property as a school. 
</P>
<P>
Los Feliz Hills School occupies 6.2 acres on a bluff near ABC Studios and the 
Shakespeare Bridge. The school's several octagon-shaped buildings take up less 
than two acres, and a grassy field and parking lot cover the remaining 4.6 
acres. Some area residents have proposed that a park should be created in the 
field area, which would allow the school to remain at the site, said Tony 
Michaelis, a board member of the Franklin Hills Residents Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The association and school board members had requested about $250,000 from the 
city's Recreation and Parks Department. That was envisioned as the key 
component of a $2.2-million funding package of state, local and private funds, 
said Michaelis, who orchestrated the park effort. 
</P>
<P>
But aides to councilmen Michael Woo, whose district includes Los Feliz, and 
John Ferraro told Michaelis this week that the city had no money to give. 
</P>
<P>
"We made an effort to try to make this thing work, and the city basically shot 
us down," Michaelis said. 
</P>
<P>
But Woo's and Ferraro's aides said the money was allocated months ago to 
another recreation and parks project, which lies in Ferraro's district. They 
said city funds might be available next year, but that requests by Michaelis 
were made too late for this year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
"If the money was there, we would do it," said Diana Brueggemann, a senior 
field deputy for Woo. "But these kind of acquisitions generally take a lot of 
planning, and the city is just not flush with money to do park acquisitions." 
</P>
<P>
The $250,000 was key to the effort because it was expected to trigger other 
private and state funding, Michaelis said. For instance, he and other 
supporters of the school had been told that if the city had provided funds, the 
Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy would be more likely to provide a $250,000 
matching grant, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Michaelis said he and others will continue to search for funds. But he 
acknowledged that a sale of the entire school now is almost certain. That would 
leave Los Feliz Hills School students, teachers and administrators searching 
for a new home, administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
The school, built in 1960, owes nearly $2 million to its creditors. 
Administrators said the debts were created in the 1970s, when the school was 
closely tied to the Church of Scientology. The relationship ended in 1984 
because of differences over finances and control of the school, Headmaster 
Chris Geissmann said. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, the school filed for reorganization under federal bankruptcy 
laws, which allow financially troubled companies to try and solve their 
economic woes rather than closing.

SANTA MONICA EXPANDS LIMITS ON WATER USAGE; 
</P>
<P>
DROUGHT: COUNCIL APPROVES ADDITIONAL CURBS ON LAWN WATERING AND URGES A 
VOLUNTARY 10% REDUCTION. CITY OFFICIALS ALSO OFFER INCENTIVES TO CUT WATER USE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Monica City Council on Tuesday night agreed to impose additional 
emergency water conservation measures -- including limiting the watering of 
lawns to twice a week and encouraging a voluntary 10% reduction in water usage 
from last year's level -- with the hope of avoiding water rationing. 
</P>
<P>
City officials hope to help residents achieve the 10% cut in water usage by 
providing free low-flow shower heads and faucet aerators for kitchens and 
bathrooms, free inspections of lawns to determine watering needs, free 
adjustments to automatic irrigation systems, and free inspections for leaks for 
customers whose water consumption exceeds last year's use by 20%. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency conservation measures, which become effective next week, will be 
temporary and will continue until the City Council determines that emergency 
drought conditions have subsided. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the City Council imposed many water conservation measures. Among 
those are measures that prohibit watering lawns between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., 
hosing down patios or driveways more than once a week, and running water from 
hoses while washing cars. Also made permanent were requirements to immediately 
repair all leaks from exterior and interior pipes and for all restaurants to 
serve water only upon request. 
</P>
<P>
The additional conservation measures approved Tuesday will limit the watering 
of lawns to twice a week and impose a complete ban on the hosing down of 
driveways and patios. Swimming pools will not be allowed to be filled or 
emptied, unless it is the first filling of a newly constructed pool or if 
required repair work on a leak was performed. 
</P>
<P>
The city will hire two inspectors to enforce the conservation laws, inspect 
homes for retrofitting of low-flow toilets and shower heads, and do public 
outreach for the conservation programs. 
</P>
<P>
Repeat violators of the measures face a surcharge on their water bills of $20 
or 20% of their bimonthly water bill, whichever is higher, or a fine of up to 
$100. 
</P>
<P>
Residents also will receive written notification on their water bills of their 
monthly consumption compared to the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
City Conservation Coordinator Atossa Soltani said the restrictions are designed 
to minimize the effect of the drought and the possible need for rationing next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Santa Monica became the first California city to impose 
fines on residential property owners who do not install low-flow plumbing 
fixtures in existing residences. 
</P>
<P>
Low-flow toilets use a maximum of 1.6 gallons per flush and low-flow shower 
heads limit flow to three gallons per minute. 
</P>
<P>
After July 1, owners of single-family homes who have not complied will have $1 
a month added to their water bills, and owners of multifamily buildings will be 
charged 65 cents each month per unit. Commercial properties are not affected. 
</P>
<P>
All residents will be charged the fine through their water bill until the new 
fixtures are inspected and verified by city officials. Money collected from the 
fine -- the city calls it a "conservation incentive fee" -- will be used to 
finance the city's Baysaver program, which includes $100 rebates per bathroom 
for property owners who install the low-flow plumbing fixtures.

AIDS MARCH PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley has proclaimed Sunday as AIDS Candlelight Memorial Day in Los 
Angeles, linking a Hollywood candlelight march with other observances to be 
held that day in more than 200 other cities around the world. 
</P>
<P>
The seventh annual International Candlelight March, designated "Communities as 
Family . . . Building Hope" is set for Sunday, beginning at 6 p.m. at the 
Hollywood High School football field, 1521 N. Highland Ave. 
</P>
<P>
After the march, closing ceremonies are to be held at Plummer Park in West 
Hollywood. As many as 2,000 people are expected, according to Andrew Weisser of 
AIDS Project Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The marches are being held "to honor those who have died of AIDS and those who 
continue the fight," Weisser said. 
</P>
<P>
Marches will be held in Chicago, New York City, San Francisco, Houston, 
Helsinki, Berlin, Manila, Buenos Aires and Sydney, Australia. Internationally, 
the march is being coordinated by Mobilization Against AIDS in San Francisco.

DWP FACILITY OPEN HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Councilman Marvin Braude will join Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power officials at the opening of a new electrical facility at Sunset Boulevard 
and Church Lane in Brentwood from 10 a.m. to noon Saturday. The public is 
invited. 
</P>
<P>
The open house will include tours of the facility, as well as informational 
exhibits, entertainment and refreshments, a DWP spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The facility, which began operating last September, was built to relieve demand 
on nearby distributing stations and improve the reliability of electrical 
service in the area, project manager Ralph Jones said. It serves an area 
bounded by Mulholland Drive on the north, Wilshire and San Vicente boulevards 
on the south, Westwood Boulevard on the east and Bundy Drive on the west, he 
said.

DROPOUT RATE FALLS SHARPLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aggressive follow-up of students leaving the school system has enabled the 
Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District to register a sharp decline in its 
dropout rate over the last three years, school officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's graduating class in the district had a dropout rate of 19.6%, 
compared to 41% for the class of 1986, according to a report released this week 
by the state Department of Education. But school officials said the two 
percentages were not directly comparable. 
</P>
<P>
The 1986 figure substantially overstated the true dropout rate, they said, 
because the district made little effort to find out whether students who left 
Santa Monica-Malibu schools enrolled elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 figure is much lower, Santa Monica High School Principal Nardy Samuels 
said, because "we have actively pursued where these people go. When they don't 
tell us, we get on the phone and find out. 
</P>
<P>
"We get zinged on dropout rates," Samuels said. "A high dropout rate looks 
bad." 
</P>
<P>
The state figures the dropout rate according to how many students entered 10th 
grade and left high school without a diploma or its equivalent by the end of 
12th grade. A school has 45 days to account for a student who has left its 
campus. If it cannot, it must count the student as a dropout. 
</P>
<P>
Youths who leave Santa Monica High School and transfer to the district's 
Olympic Continuation High School are not classified as dropouts, Samuels said. 
Olympic has about 200 students; Santa Monica High has about 2,600. 
</P>
<P>
The other two public school districts on the Westside had much smaller changes 
in dropout rates, according to the state report. 
</P>
<P>
In Culver City, the dropout rate was 9.7% for the class of 1989, down from 
12.4% for the class of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In the Beverly Hills Unified School District, the rate increased slightly, from 
6.1% for the class of 1986 to 8.9% for the class of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School District had a dropout rate of 34.9% for last 
year's class. Statewide, the dropout rate for 1989 was 20.4%.

NEW PARKING METER HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Starting this summer, motorists will have to feed parking meters later into the 
night in most of the city's commercial areas. 
</P>
<P>
Parking is now free after 6 p.m. at most street parking-meter spaces. 
</P>
<P>
An exception is Main Street, where parking regulations are in effect until 
midnight. All of the city's surface parking lots -- most of them west of Main 
Street -- are subject to time limits 24 hours a day. In the downtown parking 
structures along the Third Street Promenade, the hours are 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday agreed to standardize enforcement of parking meters 
from 8 a.m. to midnight seven days a week in the six downtown parking 
structures along Ocean Avenue and the downtown area bordered by Wilshire 
Boulevard, Lincoln Boulevard, the Santa Monica Freeway and Ocean Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Wilshire and Santa Monica boulevards east of Lincoln Boulevard also will have 
their parking meter hours extended to 8 a.m to midnight, except Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
City traffic engineer Ron Fuchiwaki said the changes will be made gradually, 
with all changes expected to be completed by July 1. The increased hours are 
expected to generate an additional $350,000. The cost of street parking ranges 
from 25 cents an hour in the city parking structures to 75 cents an hour in the 
Main Street area.

11TH ANNUAL ART WALK IN VENICE PLANNED TO RAISE FUNDS FOR CLINIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visitors to the 11th annual Art Walk on Sunday will be able to look inside the 
studios of the artists of Venice and feed on the creations of some of the 
city's culinary artists. 
</P>
<P>
The Art Walk is the major fund-raiser for the Venice Family Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the event drew 5,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
A $45 ticket entitles the buyer to walk through the studios of more than 50 
artists, including Charles Arnoldi, Martha Alf, Laddie John Dill, Fritz 
Scholder, Ruth Weisberg and Susan Hauptman. The artists' media range from oil 
painting to neon sculpture. There are also 24 special exhibits, including 
"Artists in the Backroom," a display of art by budding artists who work in 
galleries. 
</P>
<P>
More than 300 works of art will be offered for sale at a silent auction at 
Westminister Elementary School, 1010 W. Washington Blvd., where tickets can be 
purchased Sunday. To buy tickets in advance, call (213) 392-8630. The school is 
the starting place for the walk. 
</P>
<P>
A separate component of the Art Walk on Saturday and Sunday will be guided 
docent tours, for a contribution of $90, of selected studios and the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
At the annual Art Walk dinner Saturday night at Santa Monica Airport, 
pediatrician Walter M. Tasem and restaurateurs Rebecca and Bruce Marder, owners 
of Rebecca's and the West Beach Cafe, will be honored. 
</P>
<P>
All proceeds from the Venice Art Walk go to the Venice Family Clinic, which 
provides medical care for the uninsured, working poor and homeless. About 
10,000 patients are served at the clinic each year. The Art Walk provides about 
one-quarter of the clinic's funding. 
</P>
<P>
For more information, call (213) 392-WALK.

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DIAL-A-RIDE CONTRACT GOES TO COSTLIER FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale City Council on Tuesday awarded a one-year contract for 
Dial-A-Ride transportation services to Medi-Ride Inc., even though the company 
plans to charge $34,000 more than a second firm that also sought the contract. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said that in addition to cost, they were considering 
Medi-Ride's references and its track record in serving the city since December. 
</P>
<P>
The Dial-A-Ride program provides van and taxi transportation to the elderly and 
handicapped on weekdays, between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m., in Glendale, La 
Canada-Flintridge and the county areas of La Crescenta and Montrose. 
</P>
<P>
Medi-Ride said it would provide four vans and cab service for $436,725. Another 
firm, Care Van, offered the same service for $402,795. An evaluation team 
representing the cities and the county recommended that the contract go to 
Medi-Ride, beginning July 1. 
</P>
<P>
A city staff report stated that since Medi-Ride took over the ride program on 
an interim basis in December, complaints have decreased and ridership has 
increased. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley K. Thesman, owner of Care Van, told the council that he did not believe 
his firm was properly notified or given fair consideration by the city staff. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Larry Zarian and Councilmen Richard Jutras and Carl Raggio voted to 
follow the staff's recommendation and award the contract to Medi-Ride. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg dissented. "I'm not at all sure we played fair on 
this one," she said.

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN GARDENER'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A transient accused of beating to death a Glendale gardener pleaded not guilty 
last week to a murder charge and was ordered to undergo a blood test. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Pinedo, 28, will return to court June 5 for a preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Jimmy Noda, 67, was discovered April 5 in Noda's Glendale home 
after police found his bloodstained car abandoned outside a Denny's restaurant 
in North Hollywood. When Pinedo was arrested, he had a deep cut on his hand, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they were uncertain how Noda and Pinedo met. Pinedo admitted 
to police that he had beaten Noda, but said he left while the gardener was 
still alive and denied killing him, Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Pargament said. 
</P>
<P>
Pinedo was arrested April 28 in Studio City after he jaywalked in front of two 
Los Angeles police officers, who matched him to a composite drawing of a murder 
suspect that they had seen that morning.

PLASTIC SURGERY SYMPOSIUM IN NEWPORT DRAWS THRONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HOFMANN, Jan Hofmann is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gravity, sun and time have conspired against you, and now you don't like 
looking in the mirror as much as you once did. Instead, you spend more and more 
time perusing the plastic surgery ads, wondering if there's a doctor-magician 
out there somewhere who can make you look like the women -- or men -- in the 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
But before you resort to such drastic measures, how about a free, instant, and 
completely reversible face lift, courtesy of the doctors at the Scripps Clinic 
and Research Foundation in La Jolla? 
</P>
<P>
It's quick, easy and quite painless. 
</P>
<P>
Ready? 
</P>
<P>
Step 1: Pick up a mirror. 
</P>
<P>
Step 2: Lie down on your back. 
</P>
<P>
Step 3: Look up into the mirror. 
</P>
<P>
The face you see there is a "pretty good preview" of what you'd look like after 
a face lift, according to Dr. Ross Rudolph, who heads the division of plastic 
and reconstructive surgery at Scripps. Bags and wrinkles are minimized but not 
erased. If you hoped to see the face of a 19-year-old fashion model looking 
back, you're not alone. Most prospective plastic surgery patients have the same 
unrealistic expectations, Rudolph said at a recent Scripps symposium on 
"Rejuvenating Aging Skin" at the Four Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Then you get the patient who comes into a physician's office and asks for a 
'mini-face lift,' " says Dr. Stephen H. Miller, a plastic surgeon at Scripps 
who chairs the American Board of Plastic Surgery. "Then she says she has an 
important social engagement coming up in four days, and she has a minimal 
amount of money, so she wants to put it on her MasterCard but she's $100 away 
from her limit." As the crowd chuckled, Miller filled in the caricature. "And 
she doesn't want her husband to find out, so she asks you to make sure he can't 
see the scars." 
</P>
<P>
The presentation was the first Scripps has made in Orange County, and 
organizers were overwhelmed at the response. Nearly 600 people -- mostly women 
-- attended the two-hour session, and more than 600 others who couldn't get in 
signed up for a future session. 
</P>
<P>
As the baby-boom generation grows older, the effects of aging -- and what can 
be done to slow or reverse them -- have become a hot topic, Rudolph said. 
</P>
<P>
As skin ages, it becomes thinner, drier and less elastic, he said. Although fat 
may collect in other parts of the body, it diminishes in the face, and that 
contributes to wrinkling and sagging. Sun exposure also causes surface 
wrinkles. 
</P>
<P>
Surgery can minimize some of those problems, and others can be helped with 
chemical peels, dermabrasion or collagen injections. But so far, nobody has 
figured out a way to turn back time, the Scripps doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
The first, and possibly the most important, step for a plastic surgery patient 
is choosing a doctor. And that can be confusing, Miller said. "A few years ago, 
I would tell people to make sure their doctors were board certified," he said. 
But that's not enough now, because many of the people who are not approved by 
recognized medical societies have formed their own boards. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the surgeries being performed are by individuals without the 
credentials necessary to be board certified," Miller said. He advises checking 
with local hospitals and colleagues before choosing a physician. "You have but 
one body to give," he said. "Be careful to whom you entrust it." 
</P>
<P>
It's important to discard those unrealistic expectations early on, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
A common misconception about face lifts, he said, is that once you've had one, 
you'll need another, and another. "Do you have to have it again? No. Does it 
last forever? No," he said. "Some people, if they are heavy with very loose 
skin, may need the operation again within eight to 12 months." 
</P>
<P>
Face lifts have improved from the old tightly pulled, artificial look to a more 
natural appearance, the doctors said. A new technique involves tightening 
underlying muscles as well, which improves the effect. Price vary greatly, but 
at Scripps, the typical face lift costs $4,600 to $6,200, the doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph, Miller and dermatologist Hubert T. Greenway of the division of 
Dermatology and Cutaneous Surgery, showed several before-and-after slides of 
their patients, many of which drew "oohs" and "ahs" from the audience. "These 
women are wearing makeup on the post-operative photo," Rudolph explained. "This 
was not intended to deceive you, but it's part of the process. We send patients 
to a cosmetician afterward to learn how to use makeup, and these pictures were 
shot when they came in for their post-operative visits. I'll be darned if I'll 
ask somebody to take off their makeup just for that. But I want to make sure 
you know the improvement is not just from the surgery." 
</P>
<P>
One advantage of aging skin, Rudolph said, is that, "as you get older, scars 
heal easier and less visibly on the face. Unfortunately, that's not true for 
the trunk, and if you have surgery there, a breast augmentation or 
abdominoplasty -- a tummy tuck -- you will have a more visible scar. But no 
scar ever becomes invisible." 
</P>
<P>
The advent of liposuction, in which fatty tissue is literally vacuumed out of 
the body, has given plastic surgeons another tool for sculpting faces and 
bodies. In addition to areas of the body with large accumulations of fat, 
doctors also use liposuction to remove bags from under the eyes and tighten the 
neck. 
</P>
<P>
But surgery isn't always the answer, said Greenway, who explained such 
dermatological techniques as collagen injections, chemical peels and 
dermabrasion. Collagen, he said, flattens deep furrows temporarily, but is 
eventually absorbed by the body. Some doctors in Mexico have used liquid 
silicone for the same purpose, "but you have to be careful with that. We had 
one patient who got silicone injections in Mexico and they migrated into her 
cheeks. She looked like a chipmunk." 
</P>

Chemical peels -- in which acid solutions are applied to the face, peeling off 
the skin's outer layer, and dermabrasion -- which involves literally sanding 
the skin, are sometimes the best answer to fine wrinkles, Greenway said. But 
there are side effects. "Two weeks later you look like you've been mugged by a 
Brillo pad," he said. Both techniques work best on light-colored skin. 
</P>
<P>
Retin-A, the anti-wrinkle drug approved in 1988, may not be as effective as 
first thought, Greenway said. "It was initially tested on the forearm, and it 
seems to work better there than on the face. The changes are very subtle." He 
also advises against going to Tijuana to buy Retin-A over the counter. "What 
you buy there may or may not be Retin-A," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the audience was mostly women, the doctors said more men have begun to 
embrace plastic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no longer dismissed as surgery for vanity's sake," Miller said. "It's 
becoming culturally and emotionally acceptable, because you are a whole person, 
and what you look like does have an effect on how you feel about yourself. To 
dismiss that as vanity seems awfully shortsighted."

ASK THE VET: CARE AND TREATMENT OF A FELINE BRAWLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. GLENN ERICSON, Ericson, a practicing Orange County veterinarian, is 
immediate past president of the Southern California Veterinary Medical Assn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: My 7-year-old cat has just gotten over his third abscess from fighting, and 
I need to know if there is another way to keep him from getting into fights or 
treating his bite wounds. He was neutered at 1 year of age and has been a good 
pet except for the fights. He is both an indoor and outdoor cat. It really 
upsets me that he gets into fights, which make him look so ugly as well as sick 
when he gets infected. Do you have any suggestions on treating him? 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Robert Kern, Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
A: Since abscesses are the result of fight wounds, it would ideally be best to 
eliminate the source of the problems by keeping your cat indoors and letting 
him out only when you are around to prevent confrontation with the neighborhood 
cats. If the other combatant is a stray, you might try using a humane trap and 
capture this cat and take him to the shelter. If your cat's opponent is a 
neighbor's pet, it may help to talk to the owner and make some sort of 
arrangement to prevent the two pets from meeting. I'm sure they are equally 
tired of their pet's wounds. 
</P>
<P>
If your cat gets into a fight, check him over for any wounds or patches of hair 
loss. You can clean these wounds with hydrogen peroxide or an antibiotic soap. 
If your pet limps, has a swollen area, or stops eating, seek veterinary care 
right away. Make sure that your cat is current on his vaccinations, especially 
the feline leukemia virus vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My 13-year-old poodle, Zorro, has had several seizures within the past 
month, and I'm becoming worried that he might not recover from the next one. 
They seem to cause him a great deal of pain as he cries and acts very upset. 
Can dogs get epilepsy? What is the best way to treat him? What should I do when 
he has one of these seizures? I don't want him to get hurt but I don't want to 
get bitten either. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Samuel Vance, Seal Beach 
</P>
<P>
A: Any seizure disorder is serious and should be investigated by your 
veterinarian. Seizures can range from mild tics or tremors to full convulsions 
with possible loss of consciousness. The causes for seizures are also numerous 
and could take a fair amount of time to eliminate some of the potential 
etiologies. 
</P>
<P>
Your pet should be checked out thoroughly by your veterinarian. Blood tests, 
X-rays of the skull or thorax, EKGs, as well as a complete neurological 
examination, should be done. Special tests such as analysis of the spinal fluid 
or CAT scans may be necessary to help locate the cause of your pet's problem. 
</P>
<P>
Treatment will be based on the findings of these tests. In the case of 
epilepsy, if your pet does have a seizure, keep him quiet. You might cover him 
with a blanket or thick towel and keep him from hurting himself until the 
convulsion is over. Never attempt to put your hand in his mouth or physically 
try to restrain him.

FAMILY LIFE: HYPNOSIS OFFERS A SAFE WAY TO GET AT PROBLEMS, RELIEVE STRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE SPENCER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You say the kids, the spouse, the job and the water shortage -- in no 
particular order -- are about to put you over the edge and you're not quite 
sure where to turn? 
</P>
<P>
Well, a little mesmerizing might be all that's needed to keep you from taking 
that walk off the pier. 
</P>
<P>
Hypnosis can not only ease stress, say the experts, but it's a lot safer and 
cheaper than tranquilizers. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Point family therapist Rex King is one believer, using hypnosis for a 
whole variety of complaints, from the monstrous to the mundane. 
</P>
<P>
"I have found it particularly useful when a patient has blocked from his or her 
memory a significant event or experience from the past," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"Often we will find someone who can't make progress in therapy because they 
won't allow themselves to face a particular experience. And through hypnosis, 
we can root it out." 
</P>
<P>
He has also used it to help people stop smoking or to control their weight -- 
even on some athletes to prepare for an event or contest. 
</P>
<P>
And, in his role as a counselor at CPC Hospital in Laguna Hills, he's currently 
exploring the use of hypnosis to help patients recovering from alcohol and/or 
drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its proven success in a number of areas, hypnosis is avoided by much of 
the public, King says, because Hollywood has given it a bad name. 
</P>
<P>
People are afraid that some "evil eye" will turn them into mass murderers or 
make them cackle like chickens or otherwise make themselves look foolish, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
They are also afraid of losing control. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's all very silly and unfortunate," says King. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is a person under hypnosis cannot be forced to do anything he or she 
would not do without it. That's the reason so many people are not able to stop 
smoking with the help of hypnosis; they really don't want to stop. 
</P>
<P>
"With many overeaters, it's the same problem. Their denial (that they really 
have a problem) is stronger than their expressed desire for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't make anyone do anything against their will." 
</P>
<P>
Another popular misconception about hypnosis, says King, is that people are 
always placed in deep trances, usually with shiny objects. 
</P>
<P>
"The most common hypnosis is what we call 'walking hypnosis,' " says King, "and 
it's the kind of thing people experience all the time. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, you are waiting for results of some medical treatment and you're 
worried. The doctor walks in, pats you on the shoulder and says, 'You're 
looking better today.' 
</P>
<P>
"Instantly, you feel better. Nothing has changed in your physical condition, 
but the power of suggestion -- a form of hypnosis, if you will -- puts you in a 
better frame of mind and you really do feel better." 
</P>
<P>
It's the form he finds best for working with stress patients, he says. "Before 
hypnotizing them, I will determine in conversation some of their most pleasant 
memories or places where they are most at peace -- a river, a lake or mountain 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, under hypnosis, I will give them visual suggestions about those places, 
allowing them to manifest them in their own minds. 
</P>
<P>
"Later, when they're in a stressful situation, they are able to recall those 
scenes and relax themselves." 
</P>
<P>
King also reminds us that we have all at one time or another hypnotized 
ourselves. "When you sit in front of a fireplace or a camp fire and stare into 
it, after a while, you become entranced. 
</P>
<P>
"That's hypnosis," he says, and the odds are Orson Welles wasn't even in the 
neighborhood when you did it.

DEMOCRACY GETS TEST IN LARGEST SOVIET REPUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MOSCOW 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With simmering tempers and much arguing, Russians embarked Wednesday on a 
struggle to create an institution unprecedented in their republic's long and 
tumultuous political history: a democratic legislature with real power. 
</P>
<P>
By a single vote, the new Russian Congress of People's Deputies showed its 
mettle by rejecting an agenda that deputies complained was being forced on them 
by the Soviet leadership. They said it was designed to lead to the swift 
approval of a Kremlin apparatchik as the republic's president. 
</P>
<P>
From a balcony, Mikhail S. Gorbachev impassively surveyed the unruly and novel 
institution he helped to found, one that may deal him a political body blow by 
making Boris N. Yeltsin, the strapping Siberian populist, the new leader of the 
Russian federation instead. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a huge victory for democratic forces," a member of the radical 
Democratic Russia group exclaimed after the agenda, seen as damaging to 
Yeltsin's chances, was rejected 495 to 494. 
</P>
<P>
The Congress, the new Parliament for the largest of the Soviet republics and 
the heartland of the Soviet Union, ironically held its inaugural session in the 
same Kremlin hall used by the old rubber-stamp national legislature. Its 
proceedings were carried live on radio. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the locale, dominated by a statue of Lenin striding confidently 
forward, little seemed the same. 
</P>
<P>
A lawmaker from the Volga valley put his finger on the difference: "Now the 
fundamental question is power." 
</P>
<P>
Another, exasperated by the haggling over procedure that began almost 
immediately from the floor, said: "This is not a congress; I don't know what it 
is. I called home, and they told me the meeting was out of order." 
</P>
<P>
Despite containing over half of the Soviet population and three-quarters of its 
land, the Russian republic has long been a political pygmy in the country's 
governmental system, which in theory is composed of 15 republics equal in 
rights though vastly different in size and economic might. 
</P>
<P>
Although ethnic Russians dominate Soviet politics, the civil service and most 
other fields of endeavor, the continent-sized land they live in has been 
virtually under direct rule by the national governmental apparatus and the 
dozens of Soviet ministries. 
</P>
<P>
"Russia has no rights. It follows the lead of the center; it has no policies of 
its own, foreign or domestic," Yeltsin told a rally Monday as he openly 
campaigned for the Russian presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Many Russians, echoing Americans' complaints about foreign aid, believe wealth 
is being siphoned from their homeland to bolster the lifestyles of ungrateful 
peoples. According to Tass, the official news agency, the central government 
distributes 61% of the profits it collects from Russian enterprises to the 
non-Russian republics. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time the central government stopped biting pieces off Russia," said 
Yeltsin, who wants an office of nationwide importance to push his demands for 
more drastic social and economic change. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's reforms have resulted in demands for local autonomy and even 
independence, and Russia is no exception. Across its 11 time zones, anger at 
the bureaucrats in Moscow has reached such a pitch that some people talk 
openly, if unrealistically, about Russia seceding from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
For many, the test of the new Congress' independence will be whether it elects 
the 59-year-old Yeltsin as chairman of the Russian Supreme Soviet, or Russian 
president. 
</P>
<P>
The incumbent, Politburo member Vitaly I. Vorotnikov, 64, is not being 
mentioned as a candidate, and Communist Party members say the squeeze has been 
put on by the national leadership to choose Alexander V. Vlasov, currently the 
republic's prime minister and a career party and government official. 
</P>
<P>
Pravda, the party daily, gave splashy play this month to an interview with the 
normally low-profile Vlasov, which the gadfly Moscow News said clearly tagged 
the 58-year-old native of the Lake Baikal region of Siberia as the "official 
candidate." 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who was dumped by Gorbachev as Moscow party boss in 1987 but scored a 
stunning political comeback by winning election to the national Parliament, has 
accused Gorbachev of putting pressure on deputies to vote for Vlasov. 
</P>
<P>
Easily elected to the Russian Congress in March from his home region of 
Sverdlovsk in the Urals, Yeltsin claims that one-third of the chamber's 1,068 
members are pledged to him. He may have more, judging by the Congress' decision 
on the first day of its session to reject the agenda calling for immediate 
election of a president. A quick vote was seen as giving Vlasov an distinct 
edge. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Vlasov will be obliged to give an accounting of his three-year tenure as 
Russian prime minister and to explain current economic difficulties. That is 
likely to open him up to tough criticism. However, a Yeltsin victory in the 
secret-ballot election still appears a long shot. 
</P>
<P>
Prominent radical Tatyana Koryagina, who like the towering Siberian has made a 
political career out of her attacks on official perks and privileges, garnered 
more than 400 votes Wednesday in her bid to win election to the Credentials 
Commission of the Parliament, but ultimately failed. That bodes poorly for 
Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
A powerful legislative branch is hardly in the political traditions of this 
land where the czars long ruled as they saw fit, and where Lenin could speak 
contemptuously of "parliamentary cretinism." 
</P>
<P>
A key reason that Soviet rulers politically emasculated the Russian federation 
was the longtime fear that its institutions, if allowed any autonomy, could 
become alternate power bases to the national bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
For example, though it has far more Communists than any other republic, Russia 
for decades was without its own party apparatus, unlike the Ukraine or Armenia, 
for example. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, when Gorbachev, already Soviet president and general secretary 
of the Soviet Communist Party, created a separate "Russian bureau," he made 
himself its chief as well. 
</P>
<P>
OFFER TO MOSCOW -- Lithuania said it would suspend secession laws to get talks.

</P>

<P>
THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC 
</P>
<P>
The Russian Republic, formally known as the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist 
Republic, was formed in 1917 and joined the Soviet Union in 1922. It is by far 
the largest and most populous of the republics, extending from the Baltic Sea 
and the Arctic Ocean in the north to China and Mongolia in the south, and to 
the Pacific Ocean in the east. 
</P>
<P>
AREA: 6.5 million square milees. 
</P>
<P>
POPULATION: 145 million. 
</P>
<P>
ETHNIC BREAKDOWN: 82.6% Russian; 3.8 Tatar; 2.7 Ukrainian; 1.2% Chuvash. There 
are about 100 other nationalities in the republic.

STATE ASKS TO KEEP IDLE ACCOUNT FUNDS; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCE: THE $40.4 MILLION WAS ILLEGALLY TAKEN FROM DORMANT ACCOUNTS BY BANK OF 
AMERICA. THE OWNERS CAN'T BE FOUND, OFFICIALS SAY.

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Controller Gray Davis wants to cancel an extraordinary attempt to reunite 
missing Bank of America customers with $40.4 million of their money and instead 
use the funds to reduce the state's cash shortage. 
</P>
<P>
In papers filed with the Sacramento Superior Court, Davis said he has 
"exhausted all reasonable" efforts to find owners of the unclaimed money that 
was illegally kept by the bank. He argued that searching any further would "not 
be cost-justified." 
</P>
<P>
Davis thus is trying to end a marathon struggle that started 15 years ago when 
the bank was sued for recovery of the depositors' funds. The state got most of 
what it sought. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, the money represents the remaining cash portion of a combined 
$53-million cash and land transfer settlement worked out in 1988 on behalf of 
customers whose bank accounts had become dormant and were improperly wiped out. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who needs the permission of Judge A. Richard Backus to end the ambitious 
two-year project, also disclosed in court papers that nearly $5 million had 
been spent on the special "reunification" effort. But it produced payments 
totaling only $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
"It is better to have spent $5 million to return $1 million to the rightful 
owners than to have done nothing and denied these people their forgotten 
assets," said Deputy Atty. Gen. Yeoryios Apallas, who represents the 
controller. 
</P>
<P>
Apallas said the decision to terminate the program was made because "we were 
just not getting the numbers that we would have liked. Some people (former 
depositors) have disappeared." 
</P>
<P>
The unclaimed $40.4 million would make only a small dent in the projected 
$3-billion shortfall between state spending and income. The funds are held in 
special trust accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Under the state's "unclaimed property" laws, financial institutions must 
attempt to find the owners of accounts that have become dormant after seven 
years of inactivity. If the owners cannot be found, the funds are transferred 
to the controller, who must make a similar search. 
</P>
<P>
In theory, at least, the money is kept in perpetuity for the missing owners, 
who may have died, moved elsewhere or simply forgotten their assets. In 
practice, the money flows into the state general fund and helps finance 
government activities. 
</P>
<P>
In the Bank of America case, Judge Backus ruled that the bank illegally had 
wiped out the dormant accounts of depositors -- many of them schoolchildren -- 
by levying service charges. In addition, the bank failed to pay interest on the 
deposits. 
</P>
<P>
A law enacted after the suit was filed requires financial institutions to 
notify customers in advance that service charges may be levied on inactive 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the difficulty in finding the missing Bank of America customers was 
the bank's former practice of routinely destroying records containing thousands 
of names and addresses. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Backus ordered Davis to conduct a special, intensified effort to track 
down the Bank of America customers who had disappeared, or their heirs, and 
return the money to them. Involved were accounts that became dormant between 
1949 and 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Backus approved a $5-million budget for the project. Among other things, it 
called for hiring extra employees, obtaining additional computers and telephone 
lines, contracting with a public relations firm and buying broadcast and 
newspaper advertising. 
</P>
<P>
In an accounting filed with the court last week, Davis reported the balance at 
$40.4 million, including $6.7 million in interest. He said he had received 
184,024 inquiries, received 16,881 claims, and paid 12,376 claims totaling $1.1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The controller said that although he wants the project abandoned, claims 
triggered by the Bank of America case would continue to be processed, using a 
computerized data bank and a permanent toll-free telephone number 
(1-800-992-4647).

A TASTE OF CHINA SOUTH OF THE BORDER 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
MEXICALI, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of Californians come to this border city every week to shop, go to 
the bullfights, spend time in a foreign land and eat Mexican food. 
</P>
<P>
They also come to eat Chinese food. 
</P>
<P>
Connoisseurs of Chinese cuisine know Mexicali as a city with some of the finest 
Chinese restaurants in the Western Hemisphere. And there's no lack of choice -- 
more than 100 Chinese restaurants are open for business here. 
</P>
<P>
It should come as no surprise. Mexicali, which is just south of the California 
city of Calexico, has a Chinese heritage that goes back to the community's 
beginnings at the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there were Chinese in Mexicali before there were Mexicans. And 
throughout the first quarter of this century, the city had more Chinese 
residents than Mexican. 
</P>
<P>
"In the early days of Mexicali, there were so many Chinese here most Mexicans 
were bilingual, speaking Spanish and Chinese," said Ramon Wong, 62, a 
third-generation resident of the city. 
</P>
<P>
As Mexicali became established, its Mexican population quickly surpassed and 
dwarfed the Chinese community. Of the city's current population of 400,000, 
Mexicali officials estimate that slightly more than 2,000 are full-blooded 
Chinese and about 8,000 are mixed-blood Chinese-Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Mexicali's Chinese community ranks as one of Mexico's largest. And its 
influenceand importance remain strong. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Mexicali's downtown is owned by Chinese, as are many commercial 
buildings throughout the community. The city's new $60-million Cachanilla Mall, 
one of the largest in Mexico, is owned primarily by Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
"Chinese are involved in all kinds of businesses in Mexicali," said Raul 
Escamilla, 46, manager of a large Mexicali real estate corporation. "They own 
ABSA, El Ahorro and Ley supermarket chains. They are in banking, land 
development, real estate. They own and operate department stores, clothing 
stores and a variety of commercial enterprises." 
</P>
<P>
Ramon Wong owns Casa Wong, the largest money exchange company in Mexicali, and 
is part owner of several other businesses. His family owns the Mandarin Mall, 
and he served as president for five years of the Associacion China Mexicali, an 
organization of the city's Chinese merchants that has a membership of 600. 
</P>
<P>
With pride, Wong said, "Chinese were pioneers of Mexicali. . . . They have 
played a leading role in the development of this city since the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
That beginning occurred in 1901 when the Colorado River was diverted and water 
flowed into the southeast corner of California and the northeast corner of Baja 
California. The U.S.-owned Colorado River Land Co. owned 800,000 acres in the 
Mexicali area and planted cotton on it. Workers from China were brought to 
Mexicali by the company to pick the crop. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no one living in the area up until that time except for a small 
community of Cocopah Indians," said Joseph Anderholt, 69, historian and curator 
of California's Imperial County Historical Assn. Museum. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the company brought in more than 10,000 Chinese men to pick cotton 
during the first two decades of the century. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest migration of Chinese to Mexicali occurred from 1910 to 1920," 
noted William Hendricks, 63, director of the Sherman Library in Corona del Mar, 
where the archives of the old Colorado River Land Co. are stored. "Many Chinese 
later returned to China. Many stayed on and married Mexican women." 
</P>
<P>
Freddie Gee, 73, a longtime grocer in Holtville, Calif., said the laborers 
brought from China were not permitted to bring Chinese women to Mexico with 
them. "The Chinese were not allowed to buy land in Mexico, but many of them 
married Mexican women and that way were able to purchase property."

Now in its 90th year, the Chinese immigration to Mexicali continues. Acmex, a 
company made up of Taiwanese investors, just opened a $5-million industrial 
park in Mexicali for Asiatic firms. The companies manufacture products for 
export to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
A Hong Kong muffler company, a Taiwanese sunglass firm, a Korean patio 
furniture manufacturer and a Taiwanese auto parts company have set up shop in 
the complex. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel very much at home here," said Grace Lee, 42, Acmex's financial 
controller. 
</P>
<P>
She moved to Mexicali from Taiwan five years ago, and the adjustment has been 
easier than she anticipated. Lee said: "The old Chinese families have welcomed 
us. The food in the Chinese restaurants is outstanding, comparable to the best 
restaurants in Taipei." 
</P>
<P>
Lee speaks Chinese and English. Now she's learning Spanish.

FUNGUS MAY BE A CAUSE OF PARKINSON'S DISEASE; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: TWO RESEARCHERS SAY PROOF WILL BE DIFFICULT, BUT COULD CONSTITUTE 'A 
MAJOR DISCOVERY.' 
</P>

<P>
At least some cases of Parkinson's disease, a devastating neurological illness 
that affects as many as 500,000 Americans, may be caused by infection by a 
common soil fungus, researchers from UC Davis will report today. 
</P>
<P>
Infection of laboratory animals with the fungus, called Nocardia asteroides, 
damages the specific areas of the brain involved in Parkinson's disease and 
produces symptoms identical to those found in human patients, the researchers 
will tell a meeting of the American Society for Microbiology in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to be easy to prove this (that Nocardia causes Parkinson's in 
humans), and there are going to be large numbers of skeptics," said 
microbiologist Blaine L. Beaman of UC Davis. "It certainly seems unbelievable, 
but if we can prove it, it translates into a major discovery." 
</P>
<P>
Pinpointing a cause of Parkinson's would be of tremendous significance because 
scientists currently do not know what causes the disease. Furthermore, 
identifying a cause, particularly an infectious agent, should lead to new ways 
of preventing the disease, such as immunization against the microorganism. 
</P>
<P>
Nocardia is widespread in the environment and most people are probably 
routinely exposed to it, either in the air or through cuts. It normally causes 
transient flu-like symptoms, such as cough and fever, but it has been observed 
to cause neurological symptoms in humans, and in some susceptible individuals 
may actually trigger Parkinson's, according to Beaman. 
</P>
<P>
Other Parkinson's researchers were cautious in their assessment of the 
scientists' results, primarily because no one had seen the study. But "their 
finding is intriguing," said neuroscientist Debra Mash of the National 
Parkinson's Foundation. "It fits in with what we already know. There are a lot 
of things that cause Parkinson's, and most of us agree that it is something in 
the environment." 
</P>
<P>
"That's an astounding assertion," said neurologist J. William Langston of the 
California Parkinson's Foundation in San Jose, who himself discovered that a 
contaminant formed in the production of the street drug methamphetamine can 
cause Parkinson's. "It would be absolutely fascinating if it is proved to have 
some basis." 
</P>
<P>
Parkinson's disease primarily affects people over 55. Its main symptoms are 
incapacitating tremors and rigidity of the limbs. As many as 30% of the victims 
also suffer dementia, a form of mental impairment. 
</P>
<P>
The disorder results from the death of brain cells that produce the 
neurotransmitter dopamine, a brain hormone that is particularly important in 
the control of muscle movement. Symptoms can be alleviated, at least in the 
early stages, with the drug L-dopa, which is converted into dopamine in the 
brain. 
</P>
<P>
Physicians are also experimenting with transplanting dopamine-secreting cells 
into the brains of Parkinson's victims, but those results, while promising, are 
still considered inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers have never been able to identify the cause of Parkinson's, however, 
and that mystery is a source of considerable study. Their best lead in the past 
was Langston's discovery that a chemical called MPTP, which contaminates some 
batches of illicit methamphetamine, causes a Parkinson's-like disease in young 
people who use the drug. 
</P>
<P>
At least 400 cases of Parkinson's disease caused by MPTP are known, and 
researchers routinely use the chemical to induce Parkinson's in experimental 
animals. Many researchers believe that environmental chemicals with a structure 
similar to MPTP may cause the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Some pesticides, for example, have similar structures. But no one has ever been 
able to prove the association. 
</P>
<P>
A report to Congress by the Office of Technology Assessment on Wednesday, in 
fact, argued that the government is not doing enough to control the release 
into the environment of chemicals that may have the potential to cause both 
Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. The report called for an additional $1.5 
million for study of the neurotoxic effects of such chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Although many researchers have suggested that infections might also be a cause 
of Parkinson's, most researchers discount that possibility because of a lack of 
supporting evidence. No one has ever been able to isolate an infectious agent, 
such as a virus or bacterium, from the brain of a Parkinson's victim, and no 
one has observed any residual traces of the inflammation that would be expected 
to accompany an infection. 
</P>
<P>
But Beaman and his colleague, microbiologist Shunro Kohbata, who is on 
sabbatical at Davis from Gifu University in Japan, believe they have found an 
explanation for the lack of such evidence. "Nocardia does unique things that 
other bacteria do not do," Beaman said. 
</P>
<P>
When Beaman and Kohbata infused large quantities of Nocardia into the blood of 
research animals, the animals suffered widespread inflammation and the few that 
survived showed a variety of neurological symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
But when they infused much smaller doses, they found that the microorganism 
infected the brain without any inflammatory response -- not surprising because 
immune cells cannot enter the brain unless there is a breach of the blood-brain 
barrier that shields the brain from potentially toxic chemicals in blood. 
</P>
<P>
In the brain, the Nocardia infection was self-limiting, Beaman said, and it was 
cleared within two weeks. Only after all traces of the infection were gone did 
the neurological symptoms develop. "If we didn't follow the course of events 
carefully, we would never be able to detect the organism," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Beaman, about 15% of the several hundred animals studied in his 
experiments developed symptoms that included rigidity on one side of the body 
(hemiparesis) and head shaking. These symptoms were alleviated with L-dopa. 
Langston cautioned, however, that hemiparesis is not one of the major symptoms 
of Parkinson's, which "raises some doubts" about their discovery. 
</P>
<P>
Although Nocardia seems to produce no major health effects in most people, it 
causes a much more serious infection in people whose immune systems are 
suppressed, such as by AIDS, organ transplants or cancer. In those patients, it 
can cause serious brain damage or be lethal. 
</P>
<P>
As support for their theory, Beaman and Kohbata noted that many people with 
severe Nocardia infections have been seen to develop a variety of neurological 
symptoms, including those of Parkinson's disease. Even less serious Nocardia 
infections might trigger such symptoms in genetically susceptible people, they 
speculated. 
</P>
<P>
Beaman plans to begin looking for traces of Nocardia infection, such as 
antibodies against it, in Parkinson's victims, but he acknowledges that a long 
road lies ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"There may be many etiologies for Parkinson's. There probably are. Nocardia may 
be one of them, but it will require a lot of work to find out."

RADIO FREE EUROPE PHASE-OUT SUGGESTED; 
</P>
<P>
BROADCASTING: THE RECOMMENDATION WOULD REQUIRE ACTION BY THE ADMINISTRATION. 
OVERSEER DEFENDS THE SERVICE.

<P>
A presidential commission recommended Wednesday that Radio Free Europe, the 
40-year-old American propaganda operation that broadcasts to Eastern Europe, be 
phased out in the wake of the collapse of Soviet rule in the region. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation would require action by the Bush Administration. But the 
unanimous finding, extraordinary for the usually routine annual report by the 
U.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy, is expected to carry weight. And 
it instantly drew the indignant objection of the head of the independent board 
that oversees Radio Free Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Radio Free Europe, founded in 1950 and originally financed by the CIA, is one 
of three radio services of the U.S. government. Its sister operation, Radio 
Liberty, broadcasts directly to the Soviet Union and is aimed particularly at 
Soviet ethnic minority nationalities. 
</P>
<P>
The third service, the U.S. Information Agency's Voice of America, puts more 
emphasis on providing news of the United States and makes more of an attempt to 
appear an objective provider of all sides of an issue. 
</P>
<P>
The commission report called for the continuation of Radio Liberty and Voice of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm S. Forbes Jr., chairman of the Board for International Broadcasting 
that now oversees Radio Free Europe and its sister operation, Radio Liberty, 
insisted that Radio Free Europe "enjoys several times the audience of Voice of 
America in Eastern and Central Europe." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that Polish labor leader Lech Walesa and Czechoslovak President Vaclav 
Havel both have pleaded that the broadcasts continue. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes criticized the commission's "too close relationship with USIA" and asked 
for an "independent, blue-ribbon presidential commission that would establish 
criteria for measuring the success of U.S.-sponsored international radio 
broadcasts." 
</P>
<P>
In its report, the commission recommended that, "The United States should start 
planning now for the termination of Radio Free Europe's language services when 
their goals have been achieved and the transfer of assets as appropriate to the 
Voice of America. 
</P>
<P>
"Unlike VOA, whose worldwide mission to broadcast news and information about 
the United States will continue, the goals of some surrogate broadcasting 
services will be achieved if democratic trends are sustained," it said. 
</P>
<P>
But it emphasized the need for country-by-country evaluation of changes, saying 
that while Polish and Hungarian broadcasts can be cut, Radio Liberty's 
broadcasts in Russian and 11 Soviet minority languages should remain. 
</P>
<P>
Commission Chairman Edwin Feulner Jr. said that the group is "depressed that 
the government seems to have no coherent policy to meet the new situation" in 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Feulner, president of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington think 
tank, suggested that a national council, similar to the National Council on 
Space, should be formed to coordinate government agencies dealing with 
information. 
</P>
<P>
As broadcasting decreases, his panel's report said, more classic cultural 
exchange programs involving teachers, students and artists should be expanded 
to take their place, as well as increasing funding for libraries and 
educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Public diplomacy is not, as some suggest, a creature of the Cold War, its work 
now accomplished," the report said. "The new governments . . . need what 
decades of totalitarian rule did not provide: nation-building skills, 
entrepreneurial know-how and a firm intellectual foundation in democratic 
values and human rights."

Lithuania's Parliament offered Wednesday to suspend laws it has enacted since 
declaring the republic's independence if the Kremlin agrees to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution adopted by the Lithuanian Supreme Council is aimed at breaking 
Lithuania's impasse with Moscow, but council spokeswoman Rita Dapkus said it 
does not involve rescinding the republic's March 11 declaration of independence 
itself as the Kremlin has demanded. 
</P>
<P>
She said the offer will be delivered to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today. 
</P>
<P>
Dapkus said the proposal closely resembled the compromise suggested last month 
by French and German leaders but adds a transition period before full 
independence and concrete proposals on military cooperation, economic plans and 
other topics. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev spokesman Arkady A. Maslennikov has said the proposal by West German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand went "along the 
lines" of Gorbachev's thinking. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev pronounced Lithuania's declaration of independence invalid in March 
and followed up with economic sanctions, including a partial blockade that 
officials say has left the republic of 3.8 million on the verge of running out 
of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene said Tuesday that she believes 
talks with Moscow could begin this week, and she is expected to be in Moscow 
today. 
</P>
<P>
A leader of neighboring Latvia said Wednesday that talks on Baltic independence 
would start next week with mid-level Kremlin officials. Deputy Prime Minister 
Ilmars Bisers, just back from meetings in Moscow, said talks with Soviet 
officials would focus on "the gaining of independence on the basis of a treaty 
with the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
All three Baltic republics were reported to be calm Wednesday, one day after 
thousands of anti-independence protesters converged on government buildings in 
Riga, the capital of Latvia, and Tallinn, the capital of Estonia.

LIVES NOT IMPROVING, GORBACHEV OUT OF FAVOR WITH PEOPLE, PRAVDA SAYS

The Communist Party newspaper Pravda said Wednesday that Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev has fallen out of favor with the people because his 
reforms have not improved their lives fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
A defense of Gorbachev, now protected by a law against defaming or slandering 
the head of state, was printed in Pravda beside extracts of a letter from a 
longtime Communist who expressed disillusionment with the Kremlin chief. 
</P>
<P>
"Heavy is the lot of a leader who made the first step toward truth and now . . 
. has taken on himself the burden not only of responsibility but also of what 
we must frankly call popular ingratitude," the commentary by columnist 
Alexander Ilyin said. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, which the newspaper said was typical of many it is receiving, a 
woman from Krivoi Rog in the Ukraine said Gorbachev's continuing defense of 
communism and the party suggested that he is insincere and "playing at 
democracy." 
</P>
<P>
The woman, Olga Ishchenko, who said she has resigned from the party after two 
decades as an activist, declared that she finds that Gorbachev's continuing 
assertions of his Communist faith contradict his proclaimed commitment to 
change. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, an electoral official in a Moscow district where Gorbachev is 
running for election as a delegate to the coming Communist Party congress 
revealed that he had won only 61% of the vote against 36% for a radical 
opponent.

REPRESSIVE PAST HAUNTS SUNDAY'S ROMANIA VOTE; 
</P>
<P>
DEMOCRATIZATION: THUGGERY MARKS VOLATILE CAMPAIGN. CITIZENS FIND FREE SPEECH A 
DIFFICULT CONCEPT TO GRASP.

<P>
As Romanians limp toward their date with democracy on Sunday, ghosts of the 
repressive past they are struggling to overcome have haunted the election 
campaign and raised questions about whether the voting will be truly free. 
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Party candidate for president has a black eye, inflicted by a rock 
his supporters say was thrown by a former Communist loyal to interim President 
Ion Iliescu of the National Salvation Front. 
</P>
<P>
Ion Ratiu, another Iliescu challenger, contends that his rallies have been 
routinely broken up by pro-front thugs and that the governing party monopolizes 
the state-run news media in a concerted effort to ensure its power. 
</P>
<P>
And the Bush Administration last Thursday briefly recalled Ambassador Alan 
Green Jr. to Washington for "consultations" in a gesture that State Department 
officials made clear was meant as a "public signal" of concern about the 
intimidation of opposition candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Iliescu and his party dismiss the accusations of harassment as speculation and 
sour grapes among opponents who fear they are going to lose. 
</P>
<P>
The National Front enjoys an outright majority of voter support, according to 
Romanian and foreign pollsters, and the tens of thousands who flock to 
Iliescu's campaign appearances add weight to the governing party's argument 
that it does not have to cheat to win. 
</P>
<P>
The vitriolic exchanges among the three leading parties have made for a 
volatile campaign and an atmosphere of fear and distrust even five months after 
the overthrow of Nicolae Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
The confrontations, which have repeatedly spilled over into violence, 
illustrate the difficulties Romanians have in grasping the democratic concept 
that even opponents have the right to air their views. 
</P>
<P>
"Romanians don't understand what a campaign is supposed to be; they are the 
products of 50 years of darkness," said Sorin Mester, a regional campaign 
director for the front. 
</P>
<P>
Especially in the countryside, where Ceausescu's tyrannical policies had their 
harshest effect, the reflexive response to unwelcome arguments is to attack and 
humiliate an opponent. 
</P>
<P>
The National Front bands together former dissidents and reformed Communists in 
an interim government that took power after Ceausescu was toppled and executed 
in December. 
</P>
<P>
The leading party has campaigned on promises to build a market economy and a 
democratic society. But the Liberals and the National Peasant Party, the only 
two challengers considered to have a chance among more than 70 parties on 
Sunday's ballot, contend that the front actually seeks to restore a Communist 
order and is therefore supported by former Communists and agents of the 
Securitate, Ceausescu's shadowy secret police force. 
</P>
<P>
A round-the-clock protest has filled Bucharest's University Square since April 
22, demanding that Iliescu and all other former Communists be barred from the 
election. Hundreds of demonstrators have cordoned off the central square and 
barred vehicle traffic, and the tent city that has sprung up to house them is 
strewn with litter. Passers-by spew invective at the sit-in participants and 
shout for the police to sweep them from the square. 
</P>
<P>
"They are lazy do-nothings who should be thrown out of the country," said 
Alexandrina Apostol, a 53-year-old engineer. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the young participants, when asked about the aims of their protest, 
appeared to be confused and offered contradictory responses. 
</P>
<P>
"Former Communist Party activists should not be allowed to run," said Ioana 
Geanta, 20, who said she works in a power plant. But she said Iliescu should be 
allowed to compete and be voted down by opponents of communism. 
</P>
<P>
Adrian Nastase of the front leadership said the interim government has no 
intention of halting the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
"That is just what our opponents would like," Nastase said, adding that the 
protesters are trying to provoke a violent confrontation that would cast the 
front as a repressive force trying to silence its opponents. 
</P>
<P>
While the public tone of the interim government is tolerant, its supporters in 
the countryside have at times resorted to Stalinist measures to deter 
opponents. Sorin Botez, the Liberal Party executive secretary, said that at 
least a dozen local party headquarters have been broken into and ransacked by 
front supporters and that threatening groups of drunken laborers frighten 
people away from the party's campaign rallies. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people are supporting the front only out of fear," Botez said. "The polls 
are not reliable because people do not feel free to say what they think." 
</P>
<P>
At a recent Iliescu campaign stop in Rimnicu Vilcea, about 110 miles northwest 
of the capital, front supporters angrily denounced two women shouting that 
Romanians fail to see the threat posed by the election of former Communists. 
</P>
<P>
"You better get out of here before you get hurt," a man shouted as the women 
moved through the crowd of 10,000, nearly all of whom had come to cheer 
Iliescu. 
</P>
<P>
It was in the eastern city of Braila that Liberal Party presidential candidate 
Radu Campeanu was attacked after a campaign speech. About 40 people entered a 
hall and chased the candidate out under a barrage of rocks, bricks and bottles, 
one of which struck the 66-year-old Liberal near his right eye. 
</P>
<P>
"The intimidation is so rampant that it is no longer tolerable," said Ratiu, 
presidential candidate for the Peasants Party, whose list of grievances against 
the government grows daily. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Elizabeth, narrowly escaped injury in early May when workers at a 
Bucharest mental hospital she visited attacked her car and an escort vehicle, 
smashing the windows with iron bars. 
</P>
<P>
"I am absolutely convinced that this is a deliberate attempt to prevent me from 
putting my campaign before the people," said Ratiu, a retired shipping magnate 
who has been bankrolling his own campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Front supporters contend that Ratiu is fueling the University Square 
demonstration by paying each participant $10 a day to stay at the site. The 
accusation is considered ludicrous by foreign observers, who have heard the 
story repeatedly.

The government of Taiwan would welcome talks with China, the presidential 
spokesman said Wednesday, which could pave the way for closer ties with 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
President Lee Teng-hui, in a meeting Tuesday with lawmakers who had just 
returned from China, said he favors government-to-government dialogue between 
Taiwan and China. 
</P>

ARIZONA ENACTS LAW TO ESTABLISH DR. KING HOLIDAY

Gov. Rose Mofford signed legislation Wednesday designating a paid holiday for 
state employees to honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., just hours after the 
Arizona House passed it. 
</P>
<P>
The late-afternoon signing of the bill culminated a 15-year political struggle 
over a King holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the House passed the bill, 35 to 25. 
</P>
<P>
Former Gov. Bruce Babbitt, a Democrat, proclaimed a day honoring the late civil 
rights leader in 1986. His successor, Republican Evan Mecham, rescinded the 
order before it was to have taken effect and the ensuing uproar led to protest 
marches, boycotts and cancellations of conventions in the state. 
</P>
<P>
The new law designates the third Monday of January to be observed as Martin 
Luther King-Civil Rights Day. It repeals an earlier measure that substituted a 
King Day for Columbus Day on the state's calendar of paid holidays. 
</P>
<P>
Because it also cancels a November referendum on the issue, the law is likely 
to touch off a drive to put the matter to a popular vote.

TORNADOES RIP OKLAHOMA; FLOODS STILL MENACE TEXAS

A tornado pulverized a path across Stillwater, Okla., leaving a 4-year-old boy 
dead as it smashed cars, blew away roofs and drove wooden planks from shredded 
rafters 2 and 3 feet deep into yards. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the tornadoes, torrential rain, hail and floods struck the nation's 
midsection, while Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana kept fighting roiling 
floodwaters, the National Weather Service reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Eight people were injured in the Stillwater tornado late Tuesday and more than 
200 homes and businesses destroyed or damaged. More than 200 people were 
evacuated from homes and from where power lines on the ground posed a threat, 
said Stillwater Police Lt. Kirk Mittelstet. 
</P>
<P>
A tornado also struck near Foyil in northeastern Oklahoma, injuring eight 
people and damaging 10 homes. Gov. Henry Bellmon promised he would seek federal 
disaster aid. 
</P>
<P>
Mittelstet said some looting had been reported. Police and a National Guard 
unit cordoned off 1 square mile with the heaviest damage in Stillwater. Only 
residents, authorities and the media were allowed in. 
</P>
<P>
In Missouri, 275 residents were evacuated in Kansas City as the swollen Blue 
River spilled over its banks. Storms dropped up to 3 inches of rain at 
Lockwood, about 25 miles northwest of Springfield. Southwestern Missouri was 
under a flash-flood watch and more storms were expected, said Jim Lee, weather 
service specialist. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy rain flooded residential areas in Champaign, Ill., and University of 
Illinois student Mark Drendel reported up to 3 feet of water in places. "It 
looks like a river more than anything. Cars are under water." 
</P>
<P>
In the South, flooding from the Red River reached Louisiana, after inundating 
thousands of acres in Arkansas and Texas. Flooding from the Red River forced 
about 400 people in Shreveport, La., to evacuate low-lying homes and a number 
of roads were under water. 
</P>
<P>
Midway between Alexandria and Shreveport, the Red River was up to a mile wide. 
</P>
<P>
In other spots, horses and cattle huddled on small islands amid the flooding. 
</P>
<P>
In sections where flooding appeared imminent, levees were reinforced with extra 
dirt then covered with plastic sheeting and more sandbags. 
</P>
<P>
In flood-stricken South Texas, the Trinity River Authority released a record 
88,000 cubic feet of water per second through the floodgates at Lake Livingston 
Dam toward the Gulf of Mexico to relieve a Trinity River swollen in places to 
10 miles wide. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Emergency Management Agency extended a presidential disaster area 
Wednesday to four more Texas counties, bringing the total to 33 counties 
eligible for government assistance because of severe weather and flooding since 
April 15. 
</P>
<P>
Liberty County officials warned holdout residents in low areas along the 
Trinity to join about 7,000 others who have evacuated in the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Among the holdouts are Joe and Annie Loftin, who fished from the porch of their 
new stilt home as water crept to their steps and soaked the net of a basketball 
hoop on a nearby cottonwood tree. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody better pull the plug, my St. Augustine grass has done been watered," 
Joe Loftin said.

REVIEW CLEARS JUSTICE DEPT. IN REP. GRAY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Solicitor General Kenneth W. Starr concluded Wednesday that an internal Justice 
Department inquiry into the circumstances that led to public disclosure of an 
investigation involving House Democratic Whip William H. Gray III was thorough 
and that no disciplinary action is warranted. 
</P>
<P>
The Gray investigation was revealed in a CBS-TV broadcast as the Pennsylvania 
congressman was running for his House leadership post last year, sparking 
accusations that the leak was politically motivated. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh 
subsequently ordered the internal inquiry by the department's criminal 
division. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh asked for Starr's review after rejecting advice by the department's 
internal watchdog, who had called for further investigation and possible 
discipline, according to sources. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department investigation of Gray's office focused on alleged 
financial irregularities involving a former accountant for the congressman and 
prompted an unusual statement by Thornburgh that Gray himself was not a target. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh and Starr met Wednesday with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman 
Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks 
(D-Tex.) and the ranking Republican members of both panels to report Starr's 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
Biden had expressed concern because Thornburgh did not place the investigation 
in the hands of Michael E. Shaheen Jr., counsel of the office for professional 
responsibility. Shaheen, the Justice Department's chief internal watchdog, is 
the official who normally would conduct an investigation of a departmental 
leak. 
</P>
<P>
Starr's inquiry found that "several individuals" experienced difficulties with 
polygraph examinations during the internal inquiry. It has been reported 
previously that Robert S. Ross Jr., Thornburgh's former executive assistant, 
and David Runkel, his chief spokesman, showed deception during lie detector 
tests administered by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
Both men, who served under Thornburgh when he was governor of Pennsylvania, 
were reassigned to other duties Monday. But senior department officials have 
said that their reassignments were not related to the Gray incident. 
</P>
<P>
In his announcement, Starr cited "certain concerns of an administrative 
nature," and noted that Thornburgh has taken corrective actions. Those 
administrative problems appeared to be related to the press office's policy of 
handling inquiries about criminal investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Starr agreed with the criminal division's finding that there was no evidence 
that any individual at the "main" Justice Department -- a term that excludes 
the FBI -- or at any U.S. attorney's office was the source of the original 
unauthorized disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that Runkel played a secondary confirming role when CBS reporter Rita 
Braver asked him about the story she had uncovered. Although it was not 
mentioned by Starr, the agency's criminal division also found that an FBI 
official, no longer with the bureau, served as a secondary confirming source on 
the Gray story. 
</P>
<P>
Starr did not recommend that any disciplinary action be taken against Justice 
Department officials and concluded that Thornburgh was acting appropriately 
when he came to a similar conclusion.

Freed American hostage Robert Polhill has a cancerous growth around his vocal 
cords that will require surgeons to remove his voice box, his physicians said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Such radical surgery, scheduled for today, might have been avoided if the tumor 
had been diagnosed sooner, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
The tumor "is quite old, probably at least a year," said Col. Russ Zajtchuk, 
deputy commander of clinical services at Walter Reed Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
There is no evidence the cancer has spread, but Polhill's treatment will 
include radiation therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Polhill, 55, was held captive by Shiite Muslims in Lebanon for 39 months before 
being freed April 22.

GROUPS SPLIT OVER ENDORSING FIRE-SAFE CIGARETTES

Burn victims and consumer advocates urged Congress on Wednesday to pass 
legislation designed to reduce the fire danger from cigarettes, the nation's 
leading cause of fatal fires. 
</P>
<P>
But tobacco officials, testifying against the bill before a House subcommittee, 
were joined by some fire officials in urging that more research be done before 
a fire safety standard is set. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer activists and congressmen pushing the bill had hoped for a united 
front by fire groups. But the proposal has split the ranks of the groups, some 
of which have received grants and contracts from the Tobacco Institute in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"It is now time to begin the process of moving a fire-safe cigarette from the 
laboratory into the environment where it can make a difference," said District 
of Columbia Fire Chief Rayfield Alfred, speaking for the International Assn. of 
Fire Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
"Let us see if the fire-safe cigarettes can be made before we attempt to 
mandate them," countered Philip Stittleburg, representing the National 
Volunteer Fire Council. "It is not a political determination but a scientific 
one." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Doug Walgren (D-Pa.), chairman of the subcommittee on commerce, consumer 
protection and competitiveness of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, 
questioned whether support from the industry played a role in persuading some 
fire organizations to endorse study over action. 
</P>
<P>
"Simply put, we need a cigarette which, when dropped accidentally in a chair or 
bed, goes out before a life-threatening fire can start," Walgren said. 
</P>
<P>
Cigarette fires kill nearly 1,500 Americans a year, including children who were 
at home when a smoker fell asleep. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, a federal task force concluded that it would be "technically 
feasible" to produce safer cigarettes. The study found that thinner cigarettes, 
using looser-packed tobacco and less-porous paper, would cause fewer fires. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Joe Moakley (D-Mass.) introduced a bill that would give the Consumer 
Product Safety Commission a year to establish an ignition resistance standard 
for cigarettes. The industry then would have another year to bring its products 
into line with the standard. 
</P>
<P>
A rival bill by Reps. Rick Boucher (D-Va.) and Thomas J. Bliley Jr. (R-Va.) on 
behalf of the industry would launch a three-year study of unresolved issues, 
including the commercial potential of safer cigarettes. It would not require 
any action upon completion. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue of commercial feasibility is a real question," said Charles Whitley, 
a former congressman who testified on behalf of the Tobacco Institute. "More 
research needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
Asked by Walgren about the industry's financial support of fire groups, Whitley 
said there were "no strings" attached to the grants. 
</P>
<P>
The industry several years ago began providing the grants, creating what an 
industry lawyer called "the largest privately financed fire education/fire 
prevention program in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson reported from Washington and Levin reported from Los Angeles.

Looking for a nice place to walk, hike or jog on a cool springtime morning or 
lazy afternoon? Then look no farther than Poway, North County's self-pro- 
</P>
<P>
claimed "City in the Country." Nowhere in the county will you find a better- 
developed system of trails lacing both suburban neighborhoods and adjoining 
open space. 
</P>
<P>
Poway's enlightened approach to community trail development is partly a 
reflection of its residents' preoccupation with the outdoors, and partly due to 
some savvy planning during the city's infancy in the early 1980s. As soon as 
several parcels of surplus public-domain land on the city's edge were deeded 
over to the city by the federal Bureau of Land Management, Poway declared them 
permanent open space and initiated an aggressive program of trail construction. 
</P>
<P>
Today, 40 miles of trails cover not only these areas, but also many of the 
city's residential neighborhoods. According to Poway's riding and hiking trails 
plan, an additional 50 miles or so will be completed during the next several 
years. The system's peripheral trails are designed to link with trails in other 
jurisdictions, possibly as part of a future, countywide system of multiuse 
trails. 
</P>
<P>
Poway's most interesting trail of moderate difficulty encircles the 60-acre 
surface of Lake Poway, a reservoir (currently full) storing emergency water 
supplies. Even if you don't like hiking, visiting the impeccably maintained 
recreational area (Poway residents get in free; nonresidents pay a parking fee 
of $3 weekdays, $4 weekends) along the lake's west shore might be worth your 
while. You can loll on the grass in a 10-acre picnic area; play horseshoes, 
volleyball, or softball; or rent a boat to fish or cruise on the lake. The 
recreation area is open seven days a week, sunrise to sunset (phone 748-2224 
for more information). 
</P>
<P>
The loop trail around the lake features 3 miles of dirt road and switchback 
trail, some of the latter steeply pitched. The whole trip takes less than an 
hour for joggers and power walkers, and more than two hours for bird watchers 
and flower sniffers. Down at the bottom of the trail, in a ravine just below 
the rock-fill dam, you might deviate a little from the route to visit the 
seldom-used wilderness campground, open only to those on foot or horseback. You 
can use one of the picnic tables there to relax, tank up on fluids and admire 
the line of oaks, sycamores and willows hugging the nearby creek. 
</P>
<P>
On the east side of the lake another side trip option presents itself. Climb a 
short way up the steep Mt. Woodson Trail for a look at some of the 
late-blooming spring wildflowers -- Indian pink, scarlet delphinium, and monkey 
flower -- along the north-facing slopes. 
</P>
<P>
The Mt. Woodson Trail is your gateway to the rugged area of open space known as 
the Clyde Rexrode Wilderness (named in honor of Poway's first mayor). If you're 
up to a strenuous hike, pick a cool morning to explore either of the two upper 
branches of the trail. One branch forks left and climbs the steep and shaggy 
slopes of Woodson Mountain -- or Mt. Woodson, if you prefer the corrupted name. 
This 8-mile (round trip) west approach of the mountain involves a non-trivial 
2,000 feet of elevation gain and loss, and some easy boulder-hopping near the 
top. Wear lug-soled boots or waffle-soled running shoes to ensure good 
traction, and bring along plenty of water and high-energy snacks. 
</P>
<P>
The right branch of the trail gyrates wildly up and down, following a course 
across the boulder-frosted south flank of Woodson Mountain. Two delightful 
picnic spots are passed, where you can sit in the cool shade of a venerable 
live oak and survey the rugged terrain around you. This branch of the trail 
heads toward California 67, but does not now connect to anything because of the 
widening of the highway roadbed. Eventually an extension of this trail will 
link up with the Iron Mountain Trail, about 1 mile south. Because of the many 
ups and downs, this alternative (9 miles round-trip to California 67) is about 
as strenuous as the west approach of Woodson Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Another way to enjoy the area is to hike the steep, paved service road up along 
Woodson Mountain's east slope. The route passes through the county's premier 
rock-climbing area, a landscape strewn with smooth and angular boulders shaped 
like oversized jelly beans and jelly-bean fragments. If you start the climb to 
the top (1,200 feet gain in 1.7 miles) no later than around 6:30 p.m., you'll 
enjoy a spectacular sunset from the summit plateau. Return by the light of the 
nearly full moon (best July 3-6 or Aug. 30-Sept. 2) or by flashlight. Access to 
the mountain is now awkward: you must park across from the fire station along 
California 67, quickly cross the highway on foot and walk past the station to 
reach the service road.

There are many things to see and do when visiting Oceanside Harbor. The 
following are just a few ideas. For more information on events in Oceanside, 
contact the Oceanside Chamber of Commerce, 722-1534. 
</P>
<P>
1) Beer Can Races every Wednesday night, June 13-Aug. 29. Sponsored by the 
Oceanside Yacht Club. Boats race on short courses inside and outside the 
harbor. Sometimes 30 boats compete. Open to anyone with a sailboat. The Yacht 
Club opens to the public after the races for race clinics and barbecues. 
Usually sailed in light, northwesterly winds. For information, call 722-5751. 
</P>
<P>
2) Nightly bonfires at fire rings lining the beaches of Oceanside Harbor. There 
are plenty of rings, and more are being installed for summer. Roast hot dogs 
and marshmallows to the sound of the roaring ocean. No alcohol, pets or glass 
items allowed on the beach. Bring lots of wood. 
</P>
<P>
3) Whale watching or fishing on one of Helgren's Sportfishing boats. The 
yellowtail will be biting for the next two months. A half-day's fishing trip 
costs $19 for adults, including trip and bait; a one-day fishing license is 
$5.75; fishing gear rents for $6. For information, call 722-2133. 
</P>
<P>
4) Pecan turtles at the Harbor Sweet Shop in Cape Cod Village. Priced at $3 a 
quarter pound. For information, call 722-7837. 
</P>
<P>
5) Tuesday at Harbor Fish &amp; Chips in Cape Cod Village. There is a new 
special every day at this quaint little restaurant. Tuesdays its a medium 
basket of fish and chips for $2.95. For information, call 722-4977. 
</P>
<P>
6) Happy hour at Monterey Bay Canners restaurant. Try the San Francisco-like 
sourdough French bread. Other good bets are the oyster shooters and tiger 
prawns. A nice place to watch the sunset. For information, call 722-3474. 
</P>
<P>
7) RV camping along the beach. The price is right: $3 for day use, $13 for 24 
hours. Maximum is five days. 
</P>
<P>
8) T-shirt ties at Sunn Shirts in Cape Cod Village sell for $4.95 and are made 
in the shape of fish and other ocean creatures. For information, call 722-6639. 
</P>
<P>
9) Dinner at Mykonos Greek and Seafood Restaurant, Wednesday through Sunday. In 
addition to the requisite belly dancers, owner Vasilis Papadopoulos, a giant of 
a Greek, dances and entertains his guests. For information, call 757-8757. 
</P>
<P>
10) An evening walk out on the south jetty and sandy beaches of the outer 
harbor. The surf laps along at your feet as the moon and stars shine above the 
sea.

NORTH COUNTY PEOPLE: 3-YEAR ODYSSEY TO AUSTRALIA, ASIA AND EUROPE STARTED OUT 
AS A LARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three years ago, Kristen Mitchell was $12,000 in debt, had less than $600 to 
her name and had just started a job as a financial planner. 
</P>
<P>
Not exactly an ideal time to plan an expedition to Arizona, much less to 
Australia. But then a bargain airline ticket changed her life. 
</P>
<P>
Opportunities knocking unexpectedly as they do, that is precisely what the then 
26-year-old Encinitas resident did. She purchased an inexpensive, "once in a 
lifetime" airplane ticket to Australia, quit her job, packed a bag, and said 
"G'day" to her family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
What Mitchell hadn't anticipated was a three-year solo Odyssey that stretched 
like an accordion into Japan and then throughout Asia, the Soviet Union and 
several Eastern Bloc countries. Along the way, she mined opals, modeled in 
Japan, crossed a river in a wooden bucket and found love behind a picture in a 
Nepalese cafe. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know what my driving force was behind this," Mitchell said. "I 
did have this thought, 'You know, I really would like to go to Australia.' But 
it just came from nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell planned her trip very carefully. Relieving several travel agencies of 
all their brochures on Australia, she outlined an elaborate itinerary and set 
her departure date for a year in advance. 
</P>
<P>
Not long afterward, however, Mitchell had the opportunity to buy an inexpensive 
airplane ticket to the land Down Under. The only catch was that she had to 
leave right away, months earlier than she had planned. 
</P>
<P>
"I panicked immediately," recalled Mitchell. "I said, 'No, no! I can't do this! 
I've got this plan.' " 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said it was then that she learned to grab opportunity's hand before it 
moves on to someone else. Even so, she was half-terrified the night before her 
departure, trying to cram her belongings into a duffel bag two sizes too small. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm basically a weenie," Mitchell confessed. "I've literally been afraid of 
everything I've ever done." 
</P>
<P>
"But fortunately, I'm more determined than I am afraid, so, as long as I can 
keep the ratio 51% determined to 49% scared, I'll always be able to do what I 
want to do." 
</P>
<P>
Besides being a "weenie," Mitchell said, she was handicapped by her inability 
to find her own bathroom at night (forget trying to navigate in a strange land) 
and an utter hopelessness at speaking any foreign language other than the 
international tongue of "point and grunt." 
</P>
<P>
But Mitchell took to travel like lint to blue serge, and could have easily 
created a travel brochure of her own. In her 10-month stay in Australia, when 
she wasn't working as a waitress, she went horseback riding in the tropical 
rain forests, diving on the Great Barrier Reef and, in central Australia, 
mining for opals. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to Cobber Pedy, which is this great opal-mining area," Mitchell said. 
"Everybody lives underground because the climate aboveground is so extreme, so 
hot and dry. It was fascinating to stay in an underground youth hostel, see an 
underground church, and just go opal mining." 
</P>
<P>
From Australia, Mitchell extended her trip to Singapore and through Malaysia, 
traveling up the coast of Indonesia and into Thailand. With funds running low, 
Mitchell decided to head for Japan or Hong Kong, where, she had heard, there 
were jobs available teaching English. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know which one to go to, so I flipped a coin, and it came up Japan," 
she said. "By the time I got there, I think I only had 3 cents left." 
</P>
<P>
As luck would have it -- and Mitchell did seem to have it throughout her entire 
three-year adventure -- Mitchell landed in Japan during the peak hiring season 
for English teachers. A qualified teacher, she taught for a while, in the end 
at ECC, the largest language institute in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
It was at ECC that Mitchell gained celebrity status. Her blond, Princess Di 
looks appealed to the Japanese, who used her as a model in their television 
commercials and in their poster ads on trains and subways. 
</P>
<P>
Not just on a pleasure trip, Mitchell said she was committed to earning as much 
money as she could to help defray the $12,000 debt she had left back home. She 
worked in countries with the strongest currency, which would translate best 
into American dollars, she said. 
</P>
<P>
When she reached a new destination, Mitchell would try to quickly learn the 
value of money there, and the different ways people tended to get robbed or 
swindled. After mastering that knowledge, she said, she could manage quite 
easily. 
</P>
<P>
"I also traveled and lived very cheaply -- I basically slummed it," Mitchell 
said, recounting the times she slept on the luggage racks of trains in India to 
save on hotel expenses, or the number of waiting rooms and banana-leaf huts she 
nodded off in. 
</P>
<P>
"I ate what they ate and lived the way they lived," she said. "I lived in very 
slum-like conditions, but it was no worse than how the local people were 
living." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell also found in her travels that there were advantages to being a woman. 
She was not a threatening presence and most people were more curious about her 
than intimidated, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was able to go places that men were not able to go," she said. "In Vietnam, 
I went into someone's house -- they really wanted me to come in and show me 
around -- but then another foreigner, a man, came in and they immediately put 
everything away. They weren't sure what to think of him." 
</P>
<P>
In Muslim countries such as Pakistan, Malaysia and Indochina, Mitchell said, 
she did encounter some problems between the sexes. Men in Pakistan were 
mind-boggled by Mitchell when she attempted to speak to them or hold direct eye 
contact, yet they thought nothing of grabbing her bottom as she walked down the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned to always walk facing oncoming traffic because, if you walk with 
traffic, you are virtually molested on the street by passing traffic," Mitchell 
said. "I also learned to just slug people if they got too close." 
</P>
<P>
The only time Mitchell feared for her safety was in the northern Pakistan city 
of Hunza, high in the mountains. Populated by several rival Muslim sects living 
on opposite sides of a river, Hunza was beautiful, but violent, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ignoring local warning, Mitchell one day crossed the river in a wooden bucket 
that operated on a precarious pulley system. She had barely stuck a toe on the 
opposing river bank when several men with guns slung over their shoulders came 
out of the mountains and aimed at her. 
</P>
<P>
"Some other men started throwing rocks at me," Mitchell said. "I thought, 
'This, maybe, is the end of my trip.' " 
</P>
<P>
Again, being a woman saved her, Mitchell believes. "I think they knew I was no 
threat to them, and they let me go back across the river in the bucket." 
</P>
<P>
Although a self-professed "weenie," Mitchell claims she never got homesick and 
remembers crying only one time -- when she left her guest house in New Delhi to 
make a phone call and couldn't find her way back. After wandering a maze of 
narrow streets and alleys for six hours, Mitchell plunked down and bawled. 
</P>
<P>
"It was 10 o'clock at night, and I was so tired, and I thought I would never 
get home again," Mitchell said. "This big fat Indian woman saw me crying and 
she held me to her breast and she said, 'Why are you crying madame? You should 
not be crying, American madame. You a very strong American woman.' She wiped my 
tears and patted my head and she sent her son with me to find my guest house." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell does recall one night alone in Katmandu when she was prompted to write 
a long letter to a friend she had left back home in Encinitas. Writing what she 
called her "credo of life," or her thoughts on what she wanted out of life, 
Mitchell put the letter inside a Japanese puzzle box and mailed it to Malcolm 
Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first move in what turned out to be a transcontinental marriage 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a little wooden box that required 17 moves to open it," Mitchell said. 
"Malcolm had such a hard time opening that box, he nearly took a hammer to it," 
she laughed. 
</P>
<P>
Not to be outdone, Malcolm wrote back, instructing Mitchell to go look for a 
letter behind a picture in a cafe in Nepal. He had been there 11 months earlier 
and knew she would be on his trail at some point. 
</P>
<P>
"I managed to find the cafe, and I managed to find the picture, and, when I 
wedged the picture away from the wall and found the letter, I opened it up and 
it was a proposal of marriage," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Having lost his phone number in the meantime, Mitchell immediately sent a 
telegram simply stating, "Yes." "Then I went off trekking for two weeks," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In her travels, Mitchell said, she really learned the concept of adventure. 
"It's not something you find on a mountaintop or in a foreign country or that 
you can sign up for." 
</P>
<P>
"Adventure is something that's within you. It's a decision to make something 
extraordinary out of the ordinary," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most importantly, however, besides developing a sense of humor and 
learning to rely heavily on strangers, is learning how to live life rather than 
get through it, Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone can do what I did," she said. "There are no commitments you can't 
somehow bend to your will or your dreams. 
</P>
<P>
"It will never ever be exactly the right time to do the things you want to do," 
she added. "For me, it was probably the most unperfect time to go, but the 
opportunity was there, and the opportunity was perfect." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell returned to the United States last November with her debts paid off, 
$600 in her pocket and $5,000 in the bank. She now is living back in Encinitas 
with her new husband, Malcolm, and works as an office manager for Silicon 
Graphics in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
She is considering writing a book about her adventures, and she has already 
given lectures to packed audiences at Adventure 16 outdoor clothing stores and 
for the San Diego Audubon Society.

NICARAGUA: WORKERS SAY THEY WON SOME CONCESSIONS. THEY RESTORE PHONE SERVICE 
AND RELEASE MEDICINE AND OIL SHIPMENTS.

MANAGUA, Nicaragua 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Backing down from its refusal to negotiate under pressure, the government 
resumed talks with Sandinista union leaders Wednesday, and both sides reported 
steps toward settling Nicaragua's worst strike in 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro sent her labor minister and other top 
aides to restart the talks after public employees defied a back-to-work order 
Tuesday by shutting down the international airport and the telephone system, 
isolating a country in which government offices, banks, schools, bus lines and 
railroads were already closed. 
</P>
<P>
After eight hours of talks, union leaders said they had won a preliminary 
agreement guaranteeing at least temporary job security for public employees and 
a promise of no reprisals against participants in the six-day-old protest by 
50,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, the unions quickly restored telephone service, allowed shipments 
of crude oil to refineries on a strike-bound railroad and released a shipment 
of medicine held up by striking customs agents at Managua's Augusto Sandino 
Airport. The airport itself remained closed to national and international 
flights. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that they have started a dialogue is a great success for us," said 
Jesse Luis Selva, a spokesman for the strike-leading General Confederation of 
Public Administration Workers. "The government can come out a winner too, 
because this will tend to stabilize the country." 
</P>
<P>
A second round of talks began in the afternoon over wages. In the morning 
session, the government doubled its offer of a 60% increase and the unions 
lowered their demand from a boost of 200% to one of 180%. Menial government 
jobs pay the equivalent of about $15 a month, while public employees with some 
technical skill earn at least $65. 
</P>
<P>
The return of the government to the bargaining table after it declared the 
strike illegal Monday and threatened to fire the strikers was an official 
acknowledgement of Sandinista strength in the first major conflict of 
Chamorro's three weeks in office, a dispute that goes far beyond wages. 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro, who defeated President Daniel Ortega in the Feb. 25 elections, took 
office April 25 after a decade of revolutionary rule, inheriting what she 
called a bankrupt economy and a power structure built by the Sandinistas, whose 
supporters retain key positions in the government bureaucracy, the army, the 
police and the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Ordered by the government to reopen strike-closed offices with minimal 
violence, riot police retreated from showdowns Tuesday with aggressive 
Sandinista pickets at several government buildings and have made no further 
moves to clear them. 
</P>
<P>
In another setback for the government, the Sandinista-dominated appeals court 
in Managua ruled Wednesday that the strike is legal. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sandinistas are showing very clearly that they can keep this government 
from governing," said Luis Sanchez Sancho, a leader of Chamorro's 14-party 
coalition in the National Assembly. "Violeta is sitting on a powder keg." 
</P>
<P>
The strike is the most disruptive in Nicaragua since 1979 when workers, often 
supported by their employers, paralyzed the country several times in a popular 
uprising against dictator Anastasio Somoza. After deposing Somoza in July that 
year, the Sandinista guerrillas took control of the labor movement and used 
force to discourage strikes. 
</P>
<P>
A Chamorro aide said that the 60-year-old president, who has not joined the 
negotiations herself, does not yet regard the walkout as a severe crisis but is 
eager to resolve it anyway. Ortega, now the opposition leader, also appeared 
intent on a settlement. On Wednesday he visited Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo 
and asked the Roman Catholic leader to use his influence to keep the labor 
negotiations from breaking down. He also offered to open a "dialogue" between 
the Sandinista leadership and the government. 
</P>
<P>
The strike started after the new government devalued the cordoba, setting off a 
burst of inflation, and offered workers a 60% wage boost to compensate. When 
some workers began striking to demand more, Chamorro last Thursday suspended a 
Sandinista-authored civil service law that gives public employees job security, 
prompting the walkout to spread to all ministries.

The opposition Labor Party issued a fresh call for an official British inquiry 
into the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am 747 airliner over Scotland that killed 270. 
The call, backed by families of British victims, follows a U.S. report that 
suggested the bombing could have been prevented by better security. The British 
government has said that an independent inquiry cannot take place until 
criminal investigations are complete.

BOMB KILLS SOLDIER; SECOND IS WOUNDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bomb blast outside an army recruiting office in London killed a British 
sergeant and wounded another, and the armed forces minister said the attack was 
part of a "campaign of terror" by Irish nationalists. The rush-hour explosion 
in north London came two days after a bomb planted by the Irish Republican Army 
injured seven people at an army education center in the southern part of the 
capital.

A new cooling valve was fitted inside the space shuttle Columbia at Kennedy 
Space Center in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
A bad valve had been removed and found to have a torn filter. An inspection of 
adjacent plumbing uncovered no other problems. The valve had delayed Columbia's 
mission until at least the end of the month. It had been scheduled to lift off 
today with seven astronauts and the Astro observatory, capable of detecting 
sources of radiation.

The federal government will pay two Virginia builders $34.1 million for a 
150-acre tract that was condemned 18 months ago to save the Manassas Civil War 
battlefield from encroaching development. 
</P>
<P>
Under the negotiated settlement, the government will pay William Center Limited 
Partnership and NVHomes Limited Partnership for land near the Manassas 
Battlefield Park that the two groups owned jointly. 
</P>
<P>
Still to be decided is the price to be paid developers John T. (Til) Hazel Jr. 
and Milton V. Peterson for a parcel of more than 350 acres condemned at the 
same time. 
</P>
<P>
A nationwide "Save the Battlefield" campaign headed off plans to build a 
regional shopping mall and more than 500 houses on the tracts, off Route I-66 
near Manassas about 30 miles west of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Two battles were fought in the fields, in 1861 and 1862, with Confederate 
forces winning both. 
</P>
<P>
When Congress enacted a so-called legislative taking, which was signed into law 
on Nov. 10, 1988, the government gained title to the entire tract with 
compensation to be negotiated.

GROUPS SPLIT OVER ENDORSING FIRE-SAFE CIGARETTES 
</P>

<P>
Representatives of fire-prevention organizations split Wednesday over 
legislation designed to produce cigarettes that are more fire-safe, with some 
fire officials joining tobacco companies in urging Congress to require more 
study before action is taken. 
</P>
<P>
Of four fire officials who testified before a House subcommittee, two endorsed 
a bill that would require the industry to make cigarettes less apt to cause 
fires if dropped on upholstery and bedding. The other two backed an industry 
measure calling for more research. 
</P>
<P>
The two approaches have divided fire-prevention groups, many of which have 
received lucrative grants and contracts from the Tobacco Institute in recent 
years. Cigarettes are the nation's leading cause of fatal fires, claiming 
nearly 1,500 victims a year. 
</P>
<P>
"It is now time to begin the process of moving a fire-safe cigarette from the 
laboratory into the environment where it can make a difference," said District 
of Columbia Fire Chief Rayfield Alfred, speaking for the International Assn. of 
Fire Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
"Let us see if the fire-safe cigarettes can be made before we attempt to 
mandate them," countered Philip Stittleburg, representing the National 
Volunteer Fire Council. "It is not a political determination but a scientific 
one." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Doug Walgren (D-Pa.), chairman of the subcommittee on commerce, consumer 
protection and competitiveness of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, 
questioned whether support from the industry played a role in persuading some 
fire organizations to endorse study over action. 
</P>
<P>
"Simply put, we need a cigarette which, when dropped accidentally in a chair or 
bed, goes out before a life-threatening fire can start," Walgren said. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, a federal task force concluded that it would be "technically 
feasible" to produce safer cigarettes. The study found that thinner cigarettes, 
using looser-packed tobacco and less-porous paper, would cause fewer fires. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Joe Moakley (D-Mass.) introduced a bill that would give the Consumer 
Product Safety Commission a year to establish an ignition resistance standard 
for cigarettes. The industry then would have another year to bring its products 
into line with the standard. 
</P>
<P>
A rival bill by Reps. Rick Boucher (D-Va.) and Thomas J. Bliley Jr. (R-Va.) on 
behalf of the industry would launch a three-year study of unresolved issues, 
including the commercial potential of safer cigarettes. It would not require 
any action upon completion. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue of commercial feasibility is a real question," said Charles Whitley, 
a former congressman who testified on behalf of the Tobacco Institute. "More 
research needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
Asked by Walgren about the industry's financial support of fire groups, Whitley 
said there were "no strings" attached to the grants. 
</P>
<P>
Before Wednesday's hearing, the Tobacco Institute and the National Volunteer 
Fire Council orchestrated a letter-writing campaign in which some fire groups 
endorsed the industry-backed bill.

U.S. SEEKS DUAL ROLE FOR BORDER CHECKS

<P>
Federal officials are seeking court authority to use two major U.S. Border 
Patrol checkpoints in Southern California for the "dual purpose" of immigration 
and drug checks, a government prosecutor said. The proposal, which critics see 
as a significant expansion of the traditional immigration-law role of the 
checkpoints, has drawn fire from civil libertarians and others concerned about 
a violation of 4th Amendment safeguards against unreasonable searches and 
seizures. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say the "dual purpose" designation, if authorized, could have 
far-reaching implications at immigration checkpoints throughout the U.S.-Mexico 
border area, and, possibly, at law enforcement checkpoints elsewhere in the 
United States. But Assistant U.S. Atty. Patrick K. O'Toole argued that the 
"dual purpose" designation is necessary to combat the ever-expanding volume of 
drug traffic from Mexico through San Diego County.

SILBERMAN CASE BEGINS TO UNFOLD IN COURTROOM; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: PROSECUTOR SAYS SILBERMAN PRESSED FOR ILLEGAL BUSINESS. DEFENSE SAYS 
SILBERMAN WILL TESTIFY TO HIS INNOCENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Richard T. Silberman laundered cash he had been told was Colombian cocaine 
profits and was pressing for more business when he was arrested and confessed 
his guilt, a federal prosecutor said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrest last year, Silberman, a prominent San Diego businessman and 
one-time top aide to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., said he knew that running 
a money-laundering ring was a "stupid thing to do," Assistant U.S. Atty. 
Charles F. Gorder Jr. said as trial began in the complex case. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers, however, said there was no truth to any of those contentions. 
There was no confession because Silberman had no reason to confess, defense 
attorney James J. Brosnahan said in his opening statement. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, Brosnahan promised, would take the stand to say that the first deal 
was legitimate, but that he was coerced into a second deal by a government 
informer who threatened his family. 
</P>
<P>
And, though the FBI taped thousands of hours of phone calls and meetings in the 
investigation, there was no videotape or audio tape of the first key meeting 
involving Silberman or of Silberman's alleged confession, Brosnahan said. 
</P>
<P>
As the long-awaited trial kicked off Wednesday with the delivery by the lawyers 
of the conflicting -- and lengthy -- sketches of what they planned to prove 
over the six weeks the trial is expected to run, Silberman appeared relaxed and 
confident. He said he felt "real good." 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, 61, is standing trial on seven counts stemming from allegations that 
he laundered $300,000 that an undercover FBI agent portrayed as the proceeds of 
Colombian drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Silberman faces up to 75 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Four other men also were charged in the alleged money-laundering scheme. Two of 
the four have pleaded guilty over the past month, each to a single criminal 
count. 
</P>
<P>
One of those two, Jack Norman Myers, 44, a Malibu investment banker, pleaded 
guilty Monday to failing to file paper work that federal law requires for 
certain currency transactions. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for the recommendation by prosecutors of a reduced sentence, Myers, 
who has known Silberman since both were active political fund-raisers for 
Brown, agreed to testify against Silberman. Myers was once married to Los 
Angeles socialite Lynn Wasserman, the daughter of MCA Chairman Lew Wasserman. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Ziegler, 45, of Moorpark in Ventura County, agreed to a deal last month, 
pleading guilty to one criminal count of violating federal currency laws. It is 
not known whether Ziegler will testify at Silberman's trial. 
</P>
<P>
The two remaining men, reputed mobster Chris Petti, 63, of San Diego and Darryl 
Nakatsuka, 43, of Los Angeles, are scheduled to stand trial July 17. 
</P>
<P>
Petti, who was released late last week from Terminal Island federal prison 
after serving nearly 13 months of a sentence imposed for violating his 
probation in a bookmaking conviction, appeared Wednesday mid-morning as a 
spectator at Silberman's trial. He declined to comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving has barred from evidence at Silberman's 
trial any mention of the financier's attempted suicide in February. Purportedly 
believing he could not get a fair trial before Irving, Silberman took an 
overdose of sleeping pills in a Las Vegas hotel room, according to his wife, 
San Diego County Supervisor Susan Golding. 
</P>
<P>
Though much of Wednesday's proceedings were devoted to the opening statements, 
testimony actually began with FBI agent Peter Ahearn, the key undercover agent 
in the case, detailing the initial months of the investigation that led to 
Silberman. 
</P>
<P>
By October, 1988, FBI agents had been busy for months investigating Petti and 
alleged mob interest in gaming operations at the Rincon Indian reservation, 
Ahearn said. 
</P>
<P>
That October, Silberman, who had known Petti for years -- they first met at a 
Mission Valley hotel barbershop -- asked him for a meeting, purportedly looking 
for investors in his financially troubled gold mining company, Yuba Natural 
Resources, Ahearn said. 
</P>
<P>
In what is likely to be a familiar pattern, Ahearn's testimony was punctuated 
by the in-court broadcast of snippets of conversations gathered by FBI agents 
through wiretaps aimed at Petti. 
</P>
<P>
Those first few tapes established only that Silberman called Petti to set up a 
meeting and that Petti met with Ahearn, who was secretly posing as Pete 
Carmassi, a representative of Colombian drug dealers interested in laundering 
funds. Petti originally had been introduced to Ahearn through government 
informer Robert Benjamin. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have said the key evidence against Silberman will be his own words, 
recorded in hour after hour of the tapes, many gathered under a novel law -- 
used for the first time -- that allows agents to wiretap even public pay 
phones. 
</P>
<P>
Ahearn did not reach the substance of any of the deals Wednesday. But Gorder 
devoted his entire opening statement to their details -- and Brosnahan, when it 
was his turn, rebutted them. 
</P>
<P>
After Silberman's calls to Petti, those two joined Benjamin and Ahearn at a 
Nov. 9, 1988, meeting at a Mission Valley coffee shop to discuss the first 
deal, an exchange of $100,000 for stock in a Yuba subsidiary, Gorder said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the deal actually occurred, Ahearn made it plain to Silberman that his 
clients "only knew the coke," Gorder said. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman actually said he wanted to do a $500,000 deal, Gorder said. But 
Ahearn agreed solely to a test run and settled on $100,000, Gorder said. 
</P>
<P>
Brosnahan alleged that Silberman was looking only to sell $500,000 of stock 
that a frustrated Swiss shareholder wanted to unload. And Silberman had "no 
conscious awareness" that any funds were illegal, Brosnahan said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the lawyer said, Ahearn led Silberman to believe that the money was 
from Mexican investors who sought confidentiality in their financial dealings. 
</P>
<P>
Brosnahan noted that no audible recording of the Nov. 9 meeting exists. Gorder 
said the recorder that Ahearn wore to the meeting malfunctioned. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 30, 1988, at Silberman's direction, Myers and Nakatsuka picked up 
$100,000 from Ahearn at a Los Angeles hotel room, Gorder said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier that day, Gorder said, Silberman talked to Ahearn on the phone and told 
him the code for that night: "You tell them you're 'Mexico,' and they'll tell 
you they're 'Baja.' And I've used these guys on much bigger things, like zero 
problems, works like greased lightning." 
</P>
<P>
Over the next few days, Ziegler broke the money into smaller sums and 
eventually wire-transferred it to Hong Kong, to a bank account that Gorder said 
was controlled by Silberman. Later, through intermediaries, Silberman had 
delivered to Ahearn a Yuba stock certificate, Gorder said. 
</P>
<P>
Brosnahan said the delivery of the certificate proved that the deal was just 
what Silberman thought it was -- a legitimate business transaction. The FBI, he 
said, didn't understand the intricacies of international business and was 
trying to prove something that didn't exist. 
</P>
<P>
Though Gorder said Silberman pressed for more deals, Brosnahan said that was 
not so. If Silberman had been so eager, he would have called Ahearn frequently, 
but the two men had no contact from Jan. 6 through Jan. 27, 1989, Brosnahan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorder said the second deal began in February. But Brosnahan said it really 
began in January, when Benjamin, a convicted felon who had become a government 
informant, called Silberman and threatened his wife, Golding, and their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
According to Brosnahan, Benjamin said: "You think we don't know you have a 
family. You think I don't know you have a wife and children. You'll do this 
deal because we tell you to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin, who was paid some $120,000 in rent, car and other expenses during the 
course of the FBI investigation into Petti and Silberman, had a "direct 
financial motive" to threaten Silberman because he was paid only when 
information he provided led to court cases, Brosnahan said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorder, meanwhile, said the second deal, an exchange of $200,000 for U.S. 
Treasury bonds, began on Feb. 22, 1989 when Myers and Nakatsuka picked up the 
cash from Ahearn in a San Diego hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
Gorder said Silberman again expressed confidence, at one point saying "the 
mechanism I use is so comingled -- all I can tell you is no one has written us 
up in the newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
On March 2, $142,620 of bonds were delivered to Carmassi. Even accounting for 
commissions, Silberman thought Ziegler had kept too much money, perhaps up to 
$40,000, and discussed with Ahearn whether they should bring in Petti's 
friends, some "muscle," to talk to Ziegler, Gorder said. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman decided to propose a third deal to Ahearn, at least $750,000 or 
perhaps $1 million, but to cut his own fees on the transaction to make up for 
the shortfall on the second deal, Gorder said. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman and Ahearn were negotiating in a Mission Bay hotel room on April 7, 
1989, when Silberman was arrested, Gorder said. 
</P>
<P>
Brosnahan contended that Silberman had "no interest" in a third deal and "told 
Mr. Ahearn that." 
</P>
<P>
And, Brosnahan said, Silberman feared Benjamin so terribly that, when he was 
arrested and felt a hand on his shoulder, he thought he was about to be killed. 
Silberman was "oddly relieved" to learn that he was in the custody of FBI 
agents, Brosnahan said. 
</P>
<P>
No tape, video or audio, of the alleged confession exists. Gorder said it is 
FBI policy not to tape confessions.

BEACHED OCEANSIDE LANDOWNERS WANT TO RAZE STRAND DEVELOPMENT BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some coastal property owners in Oceanside, angry that they can't sell or 
develop their land despite the city's beachfront renaissance, have organized to 
demand that a 10-year-old building ban be lifted. 
</P>
<P>
The state Coastal Commission imposed the moratorium on a six-block, 51-parcel 
section of the South Strand, fearing new construction in the largely 
deteriorated area would worsen beach erosion. 
</P>
<P>
Although the area has remained basically unchanged since the prohibition went 
into effect, other parts of The Strand have blossomed from a blighted, 
high-crime area into an attractive stretch of upscale condos, new parks and 
rehabilitated houses. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, South Strand property owners had enough, and 28 of them recently 
formed the South Strand Assn. to urge city officials to petition the Coastal 
Commission for relief. 
</P>
<P>
"The property owners are getting absolutely frustrated this thing isn't being 
lifted," said Richard Eisendrath, the association's chairman and co-owner of a 
nine-unit apartment building erected in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
He and his partners want to replace their building with beachfront condos, 
partly for their personal occupancy, but they are blocked from undertaking the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"The effect of the moratorium has been suppressed property values," said 
Eisendrath. "Our dream is to have a condo on the beach, but the moratorium 
stymies everything." 
</P>
<P>
Although, an Oceanside real estate agent, and his partners are eager to improve 
their property, some owners don't have time to wait. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Larson and her husband, Don, have owned five units on two adjoining lots 
since 1978, and they want to sell. "We'd like to retire. If we were 15 years 
younger, this would be great," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, the couple had a deal with a buyer, but, "three days before the 
escrow was scheduled to close, it fell apart," Larson said. She said the 
erstwhile buyer "couldn't get financing" because lending institutions are 
reluctant to get involved in areas with building restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have the right to sell at a decent return on our investment after so 
many years," Larson said. 
</P>
<P>
She's especially upset because people with coastal holdings outside the 
moratorium area but near eroded beaches have been able to sell or develop their 
property. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel it's discriminatory," she said. 
</P>
<P>
South Strand owners are mobilizing now, in part because the city's innovative 
sand bypass operation has proven it can distribute sand via a long pipeline to 
keep beaches from eroding. 
</P>
<P>
To owners, that signifies the time to end the prohibition on South Strand 
building. They met Wednesday night with city officials, who agreed to explore a 
request to the Coastal Commission to remove the ban. 
</P>
<P>
There appears to be sensitivity toward the property owners' plight. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're ready to start making the motions to lift it (the moratorium) 
and get some development down there," said Mayor Larry Bagley. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Whitson, principal assistant to the city manager, said she would also 
recommend lifting the ban because the sand bypass project "has proved 
everything they hoped it would prove" and there is no reason to uphold the 
building limitation. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing we've been waiting on is the sand bypass operation," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Coastal Commission imposed the moratorium, it had been denying 
building applications along the South Strand. Besides beach erosion, the 
commission worried that too much residential building would prohibit parks and 
visitor attractions from being developed at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson said it's in Oceanside's interest to help South Strand property owners.

PANEL URGES LANDMARK STATUS FOR CANYON AREA 
</P>

The city Cultural Heritage Commission recommended Wednesday that about 31 acres 
of mountain property be declared a cultural landmark in an unprecedented 
decision that critics said represents a misuse of a law meant to protect Los 
Angeles' heritage. 
</P>
<P>
The commission recommended in a 4-1 vote that the upper half of Fryman Canyon, 
a serene 63-acre parcel of unspoiled land in Studio City, be protected from 
development as a culturally and historically significant site. 
</P>
<P>
Studio City residents and environmentalists had sought landmark status for the 
entire 63-acre parcel in an eleventh-hour effort to prevent construction of 26 
luxury homes planned for the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's decision, made after two hours of debate and discussion, 
represented a compromise that left both sides unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
If upheld by the City Council, the decision will not prevent developer Fred 
Sahadi from building the homes. Sahadi had already planned to donate the 
approximately 31 acres as open space to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy 
and build the homes on adjacent land. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Marx, founder of the Urban Wilderness Coalition and leader of the campaign 
to stop the development, told the commission that unless it acts to save a 
nearby stream and forest slated for destruction to make way for the houses, 
"you might as well not even designate any of it." 
</P>
<P>
"What they have designated changes nothing," Marx said. "The entire ecosystem 
is still in danger." 
</P>
<P>
Sahadi's attorney criticized the commission's ruling as an abuse of the panel's 
powers, and said he will appeal the designation to the City Council because he 
finds it ridiculous that a parcel of land could be declared culturally 
significant only because of its beauty. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very curious as to how you could make this finding in good faith," 
attorney Benjamin Reznik told the commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
"Culture is something that is person-made and society-influenced. There is 
nothing on the site that is society-influenced," he said. "This is not the 
forum within which to implement environmental concerns." 
</P>
<P>
Reznik characterized the campaign to declare the canyon a landmark as "an 
attempt to stop a project, not to preserve something cultural." He predicted 
that the vote will encourage a flood of applications from slow-growth 
neighborhood activists seeking landmark status for land in efforts to prevent 
new housing or businesses elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't let yourselves be used like that," Reznik urged the commissioners. "If 
you do, this will become a great tactic for anyone wanting to stop a 
development that's been approved already." 
</P>
<P>
Sahadi's project was approved by city officials in 1985 after nearly seven 
years of planning and more than 25 public hearings. Grading permits were issued 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, designation of a site as culturally significant means that the 
location is protected from demolition or development for up to a year. The 
city's cultural landmark ordinance states that a designation can be awarded to 
"historic structures or sites in which the broad cultural, political, economic 
or social history of the nation, state or community is reflected, or which are 
identified with historic personages or with important events." 
</P>
<P>
Since Sahadi's building plans do not affect the landmark area in this case, 
construction would not be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners defended their decision. 
</P>
<P>
Amarjit Marwah, chairman of the commission, said it would not be fair to 
prevent Sahadi's project from going forward since plans for the development had 
been in the works for about 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that the land is significant culturally because it was once 
owned by Harry C. Fryman, who built and operated the Hayward Hotel and 
developed housing tracts in the Santa Monica Mountains. Fryman, who died in 
1946, sat on the city's Civil Service, police and harbor commissions. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Harold Becks defended the panel's decision to designate only half 
of the parcel as culturally significant, saying that the portion they protected 
is that most commonly used by the public. "We designated an area that is 
historically significant -- the trail paths and that which the public had come 
to know." 
</P>
<P>
Sahadi faces other major hurdles before work can begin on the site. 
</P>
<P>
While the commission considered declaring the site as a cultural monument, 
Sahadi's grading permit expired, and the city rejected his application for a 
six-month extension.

GUN BARRAGE KILLS BYSTANDER; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: MOTHER OF FOUR DIES WHEN SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES FIRE AT MAN WITH GUN IN 
LIQUOR STORE. 
</P>

<P>
A mother of four who had stopped at a liquor store Tuesday night for items to 
restock her in-progress birthday celebration was shot to death when Los Angeles 
County sheriff's deputies chased a man into the store and critically wounded 
him in a barrage of gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
When the shooting stopped at E&amp;W Liquor, at Central Avenue and Century 
Boulevard, Gianna Maria Blue was lying in a pool of blood. Blue, who turned 30 
that day, died 90 minutes later at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The wounded man, who was taken to the hospital in critical condition, was 
identified by family members as Hernandez Vincson, 24, a cement finisher and 
roofer who lived a few blocks from the store. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department said the deputies opened fire after Vincson ran into 
the store about 10 p.m. Tuesday with them in pursuit. Authorities said he 
pulled a gun from his waistband and pointed it at them as they stood just 
outside the door. Six other customers and employees of the liquor store were 
unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
Blue's father, Will Wright, her sisters and other relatives said they were 
angry that deputies would fire into a store with innocent people standing 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I'm angry," Wright said. "I just don't know who to be angry with." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities on Wednesday declined to describe Blue's wounds other than to say 
she had been hit in the upper torso. Her distraught family said doctors at the 
hospital told them two bullets went through her heart and spun her around, 
allowing two more bullets to hit her in the back. The hospital declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kind of glad it happened like that because it means she didn't suffer," 
said Runaa DeBruce, a longtime family friend who described herself as Blue's 
"play stepsister." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Hal Grant, a sheriff's spokesman, said investigators had not determined 
if Blue was shot by the deputies or by Vincson. Grant said a five-shot, 
.38-caliber revolver was taken from Vincson. It had one spent cartridge in it 
and four bullets that had not been fired, Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
Vincson was placed in police custody at the hospital on suspicion of assault 
against a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
Grant said the two deputies had spotted Vincson outside the store after a 
pedestrian flagged down another patrol car and reported that a man was at the 
corner of Central and Century waving a gun. 
</P>
<P>
After the deputies arrived and ordered him to halt, Grant said, Vincson fled 
into the store. 
</P>
<P>
Grant declined to identify the deputies, saying that they had been temporarily 
assigned to station duty, a standard procedure in deputy-involved shootings. 
</P>
<P>
The two, he said, fired "eight to 10" shots, using 9-millimeter semiautomatic 
service pistols. But three witnesses -- a man who was with Blue, a man who was 
with Vincson and the store manager -- contend that the deputies fired many more 
shots into the store as customers leaped over counters for cover and store 
employees, fearing a robbery, dived frantically for weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Vincson's mother, Irene, said doctors told her her son had 12 bullet wounds, 
all either in his right shoulder, right chest or right side, and a broken arm. 
Grant said he did not know how many wounds Vincson had and the hospital 
declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
Vincson's neighbor, Cleophus Bealey, 40, who had walked with him to the store 
and was inside when the shooting started, said the barrage of gunfire directed 
at Vincson was so intense that it kept him on his feet as long as it lasted. 
</P>
<P>
Bealey disputed almost every detail of the sheriff's account of the incident, 
contending that the deputies fired upon Vincson without provocation and without 
warning. If Vincson had a gun, it was never in view, Bealey said. 
</P>
<P>
But Barry Hawes, manager of the liquor store, said he had seen Vincson outside 
the store with a chrome-colored revolver with a black handle shortly before the 
shooting. Vincson returned the gun to his right front pants pocket before the 
deputies arrived, Hawes said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Bealey, the deputies, who had been driving by in an unmarked car, 
started after Vincson because they saw him urinating on a wall. He said he 
never heard an order for Vincson or anyone else to halt. 
</P>
<P>
He and another customer, Nicole Hall, 17, who had just left the store, said 
Vincson walked, rather than ran, inside. Hall, however, said she heard one 
officer say to someone, "Stop walking."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CONSULTANTS HIRED FOR DWP EFFICIENCY STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has hired a team of consultants 
for a two-month study of the energy efficiency and conservation practices of 
the utility as well as its customers, Mayor Tom Bradley announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Working in conjunction with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an 
environmental group, the DWP hired two firms for $88,000 to conduct the study 
to help determine what policies should be undertaken to improve energy 
efficiency, Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Nichols, senior attorney for the council, said the study will look at 
current energy-efficiency marketing efforts, find areas for conservation 
initiatives, and recommend practical, creative strategies for optimum energy 
savings.

CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles City Council panel on Tuesday endorsed paying $3.9 million to a 
young boy and his sister who were injured when a city van driven by a lifeguard 
crashed into their home. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Casales, 5, and his sister, Elizabeth, 11, were hurt when the van, driven 
by Shawn Jordan, crashed into their home near 70th and San Pedro streets in 
1985, Assistant City Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Sugar said. 
</P>
<P>
Brian, who was 8 months old at the time, suffered a massive head injury and 
brain damage. His sister had bruises and tissue damage. 
</P>
<P>
Under the settlement approved unanimously by the Budget and Finance Committee, 
$3.8 million would be used to purchase a lifetime insurance annuity for Brian 
and $100,000 would go to his sister.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BODY OF MISSING WOMAN FOUND IN CITRUS GROVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A body found in a secluded citrus grove in Riverside County has been identified 
as Jamie Michele Bowie, 24, a Van Nuys woman who was the subject of an intense 
search last month after she disappeared while driving home from Phoenix, 
authorities said Wednesday. She had been shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside County Sheriff's Sgt. Jon Carlson said Bowie's body was found 
Saturday by an irrigation worker about two miles north of Indio and Interstate 
10, the route the woman was known to be taking home after an Easter visit to 
friends in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Carlson said an autopsy determined that she died of multiple gunshot wounds. 
Though bullet casings were found nearby, it was unknown if they were from the 
murder weapon. It was also unclear whether Bowie was killed at the scene or 
elsewhere. There are no suspects in the case.

JOFFREY BALLET CRISIS GROWS -- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR QUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MICHAELSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The management crisis of the Joffrey Ballet deepened Wednesday as Penelope 
Curry disclosed that she had resigned as the company's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation means that since the first of this month the renowned dance 
company has lost its artistic director, Gerald Arpino; its executive director, 
Curry; and the co-chairman of the board and principal financial angel, Los 
Angeles developer David H. Murdock. 
</P>
<P>
However, the departure of Curry and Murdock, who were counted as Arpino's 
detractors, could signal the return of the artistic director and co-founder. 
</P>
<P>
Curry, who has been with the company for 22 years and executive director for 
the past four years, said she submitted her resignation on Tuesday to members 
of the Los Angeles board at a meeting at the Music Center and through a 
telephone hookup to board members in New York. She said she will remain as a 
consultant to the company for the remainder of the Los Angeles season and 
"beyond that." 
</P>
<P>
Curry's resignation came hours after Murdock, who had been co-chairman of the 
board with Anthony A. Bliss of New York, issued a statement reconfirming his 
own resignation, which he had submitted on May 7. 
</P>
<P>
Arpino resigned May 1 in a dispute with the bi-coastal board. Now, however, the 
board is negotiating with Arpino in an effort to bring him back, according to a 
source close to Arpino. Curry said Wednesday that "negotiations are going very 
positively with Jerry," but declined comment on whether her resignation was 
tied to the talks. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week the company announced that Arpino had agreed to permit the 
Joffrey to perform his choreography for the remainder of the Los Angeles 
season. Arpino had withdrawn his works from the repertoire after his 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Arpino co-founded the company with Robert Joffrey in 1956, starting as a dancer 
and eventually becoming the company's chief choreographer. Arpino was named 
artistic director after Joffrey's death in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Joffrey became the resident company at New York City Center in 1966, and in 
1983 it adopted Los Angeles as a second home. Murdock was instrumental in the 
company's move West. Arpino and Curry had reportedly been at odds over the 
direction of the company. The Joffrey is nearly $2 million in debt, including 
$828,000 due from payroll withholding. 
</P>
<P>
Curry's disclosure of her resignation came almost casually. In a call to The 
Times from the Joffrey office here, she said: "Our focus is on keeping the 
company going. The only thing I can comment on, I did turn in my resignation 
yesterday. I agreed to stay on for two weeks during any transition, and I will 
be of help beyond that." 
</P>
<P>
With a hint of sadness in her voice she added: "Twenty-two years is a long 
time." At the same time she declined comment on what prompted her resignation. 
"All my energy is being devoted to having the company survive," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Murdock's statement noted that he has announced his resignation and quoted him 
as saying: "I have been active as a co-chairman of the board for seven years 
and I feel it is time to step down. It has been an honor and privilege to serve 
with this fine ballet company." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Murdock said the announcement was reissued because the 
multimillionaire financier had been inundated with phone calls. There had also 
been reports that Murdock was playing a key behind-the-scenes role in the 
Joffrey's negotiations with Arpino. 
</P>
<P>
Murdock's departure only worsens the situation because he had reportedly 
offered to erase that debt.

HEALTH DEPARTMENT CITES KAISER FOR ILLEGAL DUMPING

The County Department of Health Services has issued four notices of violation 
to Kaiser Foundation Hospital for dumping biomedical and infectious waste in a 
county landfill at least seven times in the past four months, investigators 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the violations could lead to a fine of at least $25,000, said Dan 
Avera, assistant deputy director of Environmental Health Services for the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
Avera pointed out that, if violators "knowingly" disposed of such waste, the 
penalty could be as large as $100,000 per incident. He said the County 
Department of Health Services and the district attorney's office are conducting 
a joint investigation of Kaiser, from which infectious waste was dumped in the 
Sycamore landfill in Santee on at least seven occasions between Feb. 9 and May 
2. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Kaiser, on Zion Avenue in Allied Gardens, said the violator may 
be an employee unaware of hospital policies governing the dumping of such 
waste, or the person is knowingly breaking the law. 
</P>
<P>
"We now have a toxic waste inspector on the premises 24 hours a day, and it's 
someone we installed just in the past couple of weeks, in response to these 
charges," said Jim McBride, the Kaiser spokesman. "We're conducting an intense 
educational program among our staff to make sure everyone is aware of the 
problem, to make sure they understand the policies and how truly serious this 
is." 
</P>
<P>
Avera said county health regulations mandate that hospitals treat infectious 
waste through a process called autoclaving, which heats the material under 
pressure. Only after that process is complete can the waste be taken to a 
facility authorized to receive infectious waste.

SPECIAL PROGRAMS, BETTER ACCOUNTING CUT DROPOUT RATES

<P>
More South Bay parents are getting notes when their high school kids play 
hooky, and more of those same kids are getting writer's cramp from lengthy 
assignments in detention classes. 
</P>
<P>
The result, school officials say, is that more high school students who would 
have dropped out now are in class. 
</P>
<P>
Dropout rates in most South Bay high school districts fell between 1986 and 
1989, in part because counseling, anti-gang, vocational, incentive and 
monitoring programs are taking hold, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The rate also decreased because officials were more successful in finding 
students, previously classified as dropouts, who had transferred and failed to 
tell officials at their former school. Students are recorded as dropouts if 
they have not attended school for 45 days and school officials receive no 
request from another school for the student's records. 
</P>
<P>
Dropout rates for the Class of 1989 ranged from a high of 29.1% in the 
Centinela Valley Union District, where an influx of immigrants has led to a 
high level of transience in the student body, to a low of 1.7% in the affluent 
Palos Verdes Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
The statewide dropout rate last year was 20.4%. In Los Angeles County, the rate 
was 26.4%. 
</P>
<P>
The general improvement in the South Bay mirrored state and county decreases, 
but even so, progress here was uneven. 
</P>
<P>
Centinela Valley Union, the district with the highest dropout rate, reported 
the South Bay's only increase -- though it was only 1.4%. And in the Los 
Angeles Unified School District, the six South Bay high schools also showed no 
decrease, with their aggregate dropout rate of 23.9% unchanged from 1988 to 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
The most striking decreases occurred in Inglewood and Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
In Inglewood, 31.5% of the Class of 1986 dropped out between the beginning of 
10th grade and graduation. For the Class of 1989, the dropout rate was down to 
11%, a decrease of more than 20 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood has a number of programs aimed at reaching the students most likely 
to drop out. 
</P>
<P>
Those who skip school or receive suspensions are sent to Project Hope, where 
they spend the day working on regular class assignments under a strict code of 
discipline. 
</P>
<P>
"In a program like this, you don't want to come back any more," said Director 
Ed Washington. "You don't want to sit in a classroom and write all day long." 
</P>
<P>
At Morningside High, Inglewood students involved with gangs receive counseling 
from Hector Torres. "I try to let them know that this is real life, and they 
can't live in a cartoon world. When they blow someone's head off, it's not like 
the Roadrunner and Coyote. . . . I try to help them understand that without an 
education they are nothing." 
</P>
<P>
The district also encourages parents to visit school campuses during the day to 
monitor classrooms, help with clerical duties or patrol the campus looking for 
troublemakers. 
</P>
<P>
In Torrance, the dropout rate fell from 19.3% to 6.3% -- a 67.4% decrease that 
was the sixth largest in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Delighted administrators at the Torrance Unified School District credited an 
"opportunity school" aimed at preventing ninth- and 10th-grade students from 
leaving school. Teachers and students in the program sign agreements about 
deadlines for completing class work. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance students who already have dropped out or who cannot attend school 
regularly for some reason can enroll in an independent study program, said Paul 
Sittel, the district's supervisor of child welfare, attendance and health 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Under this program, each student spends one hour with a teacher each week, 
preparing a study and work plan. The student turns in work from the previous 
week for grading and asks questions about any confusing material. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to tackling the drop-out problem, many schools also grappled with 
reporting requirements for dropouts, a problem particularly acute in the Los 
Angeles Unified School District. The problem involves students, who are not 
dropouts, but just move to another district and do not inform their old school. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Gardena, Carson and Narbonne high schools said this problem is 
particularly widespread in schools with substantial numbers of Latino students, 
many of whom transfer to a parochial school after junior high school. Others 
leave the country for family reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"We're 50% Hispanic," said Narbonne High Principal Patrick Donahoe. "We have a 
real problem with kids who leave the country. We have never ever received a 
request for records from Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
Donahoe credited a vigorous effort to locate students assigned to Narbonne 
after junior high school but who had transferred out of the system without 
informing school officials with helping cut the dropout rate from 33.8% in 1988 
to 20.7% in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
This year, he said, Narbonne had 75 so-called "no-show" students in October 
that would have been recorded as dropouts. Efforts to find them "got it down to 
10 no-shows," Donahoe said. 
</P>
<P>
At Gardena High, Ralph Butler, assistant principal for student services, blamed 
the "no-show" problem for a jump in the dropout rate from 15.6% in 1988 to 
23.7% in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
At Carson High, where 30% of the students are Latino, Susan Price, assistant 
principal for student services, agreed. "I know that accounts for a lot of 
dropout data that is just not correct." The dropout rate at Carson High also 
increased, going from 23.2% in 1988 to 26.7% in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
To reduce the dropout rate, Price said the school booster club now is hosting 
"big ice cream bashes with all the toppings" for the homeroom with the best 
attendance. In terms of fighting dropouts, "you might think that isn't 
important, but it really is," she said. 
</P>
<P>
At San Pedro High School, where the dropout rate fell from 27.3% in 1988 to 
18.7% in 1989, Joseph Orona, assistant principal for student services, said 
that he was shocked when he learned of the high rate for the Class of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, there wasn't much emphasis on it. . . . When I saw the numbers, I 
started digging in on it. That upset me. I said, 'There is no reason for that,' 
" Orona said. 
</P>
<P>
"We do a lot of follow-up on our students. We have conferences with the parents 
immediately (after attendance problems) and discuss the other educational 
options in the district. . . . The idea is . . . customizing educational 
opportunities to that student's needs. It seems to be working. . . . We call 
home. That helps. " 
</P>
<P>
The dropout rate at Banning increased from 26.1% in 1988 to 32.1% in 1989. At 
Westchester High, the rate increased from 11.1% in 1988 to 13.5% in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In the Centinela Valley Union High School District, the number of students who 
dropped out of school grew by seven between 1986 and 1989, but that was enough 
to give the district the distinction of being the only one in the South Bay 
with a rising dropout rate. The rate grew from 28.7% in 1986 to 29.1% in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators at the district -- which has been embroiled in racial tensions 
in the last few months -- blame poverty, changing demographics and a high 
transiency rate among newly arrived immigrant families for the district's 
problems in keeping students in school. Between 1986 and 1989, the percentage 
of Latino students grew by 16%, and the percentage of Anglo students declined 
by 18%. 
</P>
<P>
About 80% of the Centinela district's students must work to help support 
themselves and many leave school before graduating because they are having 
problems balancing their jobs with their classes, Supt. McKinley Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had to fight to stay even," Nash said. "The fact that it (the dropout 
rate) only went up by seven students and one percentage point indicates that 
the schools are meeting the needs of this population." 
</P>
<P>
Many newly arrived Latino immigrants come to Lennox, Hawthorne and Lawndale -- 
the three communities from where the district draws its students -- to get 
established before moving on to other communities, said Jean Lukas, who is in 
charge of testing and evaluation in the district. Only 50% of the students who 
start school in the district every September are there when the year ends, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As in Los Angeles Unified, many students who moved to other districts between 
1986 and 1989 were counted as dropouts simply because school officials didn't 
know where they were, administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
In the South Bay Union High School District, where the rate fell from 6.8% in 
1986 to 5.4% in 1989, administrators said a special program for ninth- and 
10th-grade students has reduced the district's dropout rate by more than 20%. 
</P>
<P>
"We pull kids out when they're having problems, and we work with them on their 
skills and their own self-image," Supt. Walter Hale said. "We've identified 
staff who can help with any of a number of problems. . . . It seems to be 
working." 
</P>
<P>
During the two years the program has existed, Hale said, enrollment at the 
district's continuation high school has dropped from a peak of 250 to about 
125. 
</P>
<P>
"We must be doing something right," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the El Segundo Unified School District, the rate fell from 16.8% in 1988 to 
10.2% in 1989, according to state figures. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo Supt. Richard Bertain attributes the district's decline in dropouts 
to better counseling of students who have been identified as potential dropouts 
at El Segundo High School and the continuation Arena High School. He said 
counseling was stepped up in the last year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
The lowest dropout rates in the South Bay were in the affluent Palos Verdes 
Peninsula Unified School District. The rates there declined from 3.3% in 1986 
to 1.7% in 1989. Spokeswoman Nancy Mahr said one reason for the reduction "is 
undoubtedly due to the enrollment decline the district has experienced" -- a 
25.7% drop in three years. 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH BAY HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT RATES 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the dropout rates for high school districts in the South Bay. Rates 
listed are based on the number of students who entered 10th grade but had quit 
by the end of the 12th grade. Figures are expressed as percentages of student 
enrollment.

$2.7-MILLION GRANT TARGETS YOUNGSTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The children of Logan Heights and Barrio Logan will be the beneficiaries of a 
$2.7-million grant awarded Tuesday by the U.S. Department of Labor. 
</P>
<P>
The three-year grant to the San Diego Consortium &amp; Private Industry Council 
will be used to create a neighborhood program to help youths finish school, 
find summer jobs and provide alternatives to gang activities, according to 
Aurelia Koby, chief executive officer of the consortium. 
</P>
<P>
The county group is a joint public and private organization charged by the 
federal government with training and placing low-income youth, adults and 
laid-off workers in jobs. The group includes representatives from the San Diego 
City Council, the County Board of Supervisors and 22 leaders from private 
industry and education. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor was delighted with the news," said Paul Downey, spokesman for Mayor 
Maureen O'Connor. "This is something she has been working on and lobbying in 
Washington for over a year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
The grant proposal, begun in 1989 when the mayor declared the Year of the 
Child, was developed with the advice of 39 public and private organizations who 
will implement the Youth Opportunities Unlimited program, according to 
consortium officials. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was also based on visits by O'Connor, Councilman Wes Pratt and 
others to model programs in San Francisco, New York City, Cleveland and Denver. 
</P>
<P>
The program will be housed at the William J. Oakes Boys and Girls Club near 
Memorial Junior High and provide services to as many as 1,000 children in its 
first year, said Hank Killmar, executive vice president of First Interstate 
Bank and chairman of the Youth Opportunities task force.

PERSPECTIVE ON INDUSTRIAL POLICY; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S PRUDENT, NOT IDEOLOGICAL, FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO HALT OUR DECLINE IN 
TECHNOLOGY'S GLOBAL MARKETPLACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By William Pfaff, William Pfaff is a Times syndicated columnist based in Paris. 
He wrote this column in Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
<P>
Americans think of themselves as an unideological people, solving problems by 
common sense and experience rather than by doctrine. This, though, is not true; 
certainly it is not true about the way the United States runs its economy. The 
debate over industrial policy -- state support and direction for industrial 
research -- shows the country in the grip of ideology, and jeopardizing its 
future as a result. 
</P>
<P>
The national ideology was expressed in the Bush Administration's recent 
rejection of the Defense Department Advanced Research Projects Agency attempt 
to lead research on high-definition television, and it is articulated in the 
President's economic report for 1990. That document says that "over the past 40 
years the world has learned that excessive government involvement in the 
economy leads to unsound decisions . . . slows growth and costs jobs." 
</P>
<P>
That statement confuses state socialism and the command economy with industrial 
policy. At the moment when Japan is pulling ahead of the United States in 
computer technology (having long since passed it in computer manufacture and 
sales), is already ahead in high-definition TV technology and is preparing to 
challenge the United States in aerospace -- virtually the only high-technology 
area where America still is ahead of Japan -- it is absurd to talk about 
industrial policy as something producing job losses and unsound decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration declares that industrial policy doesn't work at the same 
time that it contests the government subsidies and direction that produced the 
European Airbus program -- which has broken America's monopoly in the 
commercial aircraft market. It complains about the European Community's 
sponsorship of commercially valuable research in a score of other 
high-technologies. 
</P>
<P>
If state-sponsored research and development really produced "unsound 
decisions," one would think the United States should be glad to see its 
competitors on the wrong course. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the last 40 years have not shown Japan, France and West Germany making 
bad decisions and suffering slow growth and job losses. Quite the contrary. The 
last 40 years have shown these countries -- and others following the same 
policies -- coming from far behind to become America's most formidable 
present-day competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, public-sponsored research has also produced failures and waste. The 
current Japanese attempt to develop a fifth-generation computer has not 
succeeded in terms of the assumptions made when the work began. The Japanese 
now are redirecting their efforts along new lines of research. The 
Franco-British supersonic airliner, the Concorde, was a commercial failure, but 
the Airbus is a success, in part because of that earlier failure. Now France 
and Britain say they plan a second-generation supersonic transport aircraft, 
profiting from what they have learned from Concorde's technological success. 
</P>
<P>
Japan would not pose the commercial challenge it does today if it ran its 
affairs the way George Bush would have the United States do. Postwar Western 
Europe would never have recovered a leading scientific and technological 
position had its governments not sponsored projects with capital requirements 
beyond the resources of individual companies, or involving pay-off time-periods 
unsustainable by commercial enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
One may object to industrial policy on theoretical grounds. An economist may 
argue that the international economy tends towards an efficient division of 
labor, assigning to countries what each is best able to do. In theory, it makes 
no difference who does what, so long as international efficiency is maximized. 
Nations then exchange their products to maximum overall benefit. 
</P>
<P>
The theory is indifferent to national interest. Let's say considerations of 
relative efficiency relegate the United States to a role of low-income 
raw-materials producer and supplier of the cheap services that can be performed 
by a quasi-illiterate work force. That, the theorist would say, is tough for 
Americans, but good for international efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of industrial policy also argue that American government and business 
would conduct such a policy badly, whatever may happen abroad. Yet the evidence 
is otherwise. The American era of unquestioned technological supremacy, from 
the 1940s to the mid-1970s, was produced by an industrial policy disguised as 
defense and space policy. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning with Pearl Harbor, the Pentagon and NASA sponsored research and 
development programs that gave the United States world leadership in nuclear 
physics, aeronautics, computers, artificial intelligence, metallurgy, lasers, 
bio-technology and virtually every other field crucial to today's 
advanced-technology industries. 
</P>
<P>
Today, military spending is on a downward curve. Places like Southern 
California already feel the pinch. The public demands a peace dividend in lower 
taxes or higher social spending. American industry itself is being left to 
develop the next generation of technology. It is not going to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
Not only are there inherent obstacles in the way the industrial marketplace 
works, but the investment structure of American business today penalizes 
long-term research investments. Yet one may ask if national security means mere 
security against military attack. Does it not encompass the well-being and 
prosperity of citizens? 
</P>
<P>
The evidence is that nations which practice an intelligent industrial policy, 
deploying public and private resources to long-range national advantage and 
long-term return, are the nations that prosper. The United States was the 
world's technology and science leader from the 1940s through the 1970s because 
war and cold war forced it to invest in research that commercial criteria would 
have rejected as too costly, excessively speculative or without evident 
commercial application. 
</P>
<P>
Now the declining technological position of the United States threatens to 
produce continuing decline in American living standards and increased economic 
and industrial dependance on other countries. Yet one would think that most 
Americans still want to lead, innovate and prosper. If so, they had better do 
something about the ideologues setting national policy.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An adult Boy Scout leader accused of molesting a 14-year-old Scout pleaded 
innocent Wednesday to 12 felony counts against him. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Stark, 41, who was a Boy Scout volunteer for more than 20 years, will go 
on trial July 3. 
</P>
<P>
Stark is also a sixth-grade teacher at Black Mountain Middle School in Rancho 
Penasquitos and has been employed by the Poway Unified School District since 
1973. He is currently on a leave of absence. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen friends and supporters accompanied Stark to his arraignment 
Wednesday before Superior Court Judge Jesus Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Sally Penso said afterward that the trial is expected to 
last two weeks, but could last longer depending on how many witnesses the 
defense attorney calls. 
</P>
<P>
Penso said she expects Lane Cooke, who is representing Stark, to call a number 
of other Boy Scouts as witnesses to testify that they also went on camping 
trips with Stark and were never molested. The boy testified at a preliminary 
hearing several weeks ago that the alleged molestation took place on camping 
trips. 
</P>
<P>
Stark, who lives in Rancho Penasquitos, remains free on $15,000 bail posted 
soon after his arrest in early March.

DEMOLITION WORK BEGINS ON FORMER BREWERY BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Preservationists who had hoped to protect the Aztec Brewery buildings in Barrio 
Logan suffered a setback Wednesday when the property's owners began preliminary 
demolition of the historic structures. 
</P>
<P>
Crews, operating on provisional permits issued by the city of San Diego, began 
tearing out windows and frames on the buildings at 2301 Main St. 
</P>
<P>
"The permits allowed them to pull the windows out (before starting) actual 
demolition," a city spokesman said Wednesday. "They might be able to get their 
final demolition permit in a day or two." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego City Council members in March agreed to stall demolition for 60 days 
in order to give Foote Development Co. one last chance to negotiate a 
development agreement with Northern Automotive, the current owner. That permit 
delay period ended Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Council members in March made it clear that they would allow demolition if 
Foote or another developer failed to strike an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a Foote spokesman declined to comment on those discussions. "We have 
met, and we have talked," the spokesman said. "But I wouldn't want to 
jeopardize the (negotiations) by saying any more than that." 
</P>
<P>
Community groups in the Barrio Logan threatened Monday to seek legal action 
aimed at stopping demolition. It was uncertain Wednesday, however, if any court 
action had been initiated. 
</P>
<P>
The buildings were erected in 1911 and 1915. The city earlier agreed to 
temporarily display murals that were removed from the brewery's rathskeller.

WINFIELD REACHES SETTLEMENT, READY TO JOIN THE ANGELS; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: HE GETS CONTRACT EXTENSION FOR ONE YEAR, PLUS TWO OPTION YEARS. 
PACKAGE IS WORTH AS MUCH AS $9.1 MILLION.

<P>
Ending an often stormy residence in the New York Yankees' "Bronx Zoo," Dave 
Winfield on Wednesday agreed to terms with the Angels on a one-year extension 
to his current contract plus two option years, at the Angels' option. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which could be worth as much as $9.1 million to the 38-year-old 
outfielder, was reached five days after Winfield vetoed the Yankees' attempt to 
trade him to the Angels in exchange for Mike Witt. 
</P>
<P>
It was also nearly 12 hours after Winfield and representatives of the Yankees 
and Angels began negotiating the terms that would mollify Winfield and persuade 
him to drop his challenge to the Yankees' right to trade him. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield's contract extension will take effect in the 1991 season, after the 
expiration of the 10-year, $20-million contract he signed with the Yankees in 
December, 1980. The first year of the extension is worth $2.55 million and is 
the only year that is guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield is scheduled to join the Angels today in Milwaukee for the finale of 
their three-game series against the Brewers. Angel General Manager Mike Port 
had given Winfield until Friday to report, and was pleased at Winfield's 
eagerness to join his new club. Winfield will wear No. 32. His old number, 31, 
is worn by pitcher Chuck Finley. Angel Manager Doug Rader would not say whether 
Winfield will be in the starting lineup today. 
</P>
<P>
"To our delight, David had already made a plane reservation to Milwaukee," Port 
said by phone from Phoenix, where he was tending to personal business 
Wednesday. "That's very much to his credit. That's the type of player we're 
getting." 
</P>
<P>
Winfield based his refusal of the trade on his rights as a 10-and-five player, 
but apparently was not acting only on principle. Port said the Angels were 
obliged to give Winfield a new contract before Winfield would agree to the deal 
and drop a grievance that was scheduled to go to arbitration Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
And even as Winfield and the Angels came to terms, the Yankees apparently tried 
to obstruct the deal. Port would not reveal specific details, but said he 
"would not deny" that George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, almost 
to the last minute attempted to prevent Winfield's exchange. The Yankees did 
not pay Winfield $100,000 in bonuses, as they were required to do, until 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I can say more on that in a day or two," Port said. "Perhaps we'll be in a 
better position then. For the moment, I must be silent." 
</P>
<P>
Winfield was vocal in expressing his relief that the deal was done. A 12-time 
All-Star and career .287 hitter, he had been reduced to platoon status by 
Yankee Manager Bucky Dent, who actively advocated Winfield's departure. 
Winfield hit .213 with six runs batted in in 20 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been an ordeal to a large degree," Winfield said. "Maybe things didn't 
work out (in New York), but I know they're going to work out in California." 
</P>
<P>
Port acknowledged that he, too, felt emotionally drained by the complications 
of working out the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a trying few days," Port said. "Not at all because of Dave Winfield 
or (Winfield's agent) Jeff Klein, because the negotiations with Dave and Jeff 
were reasoned, logical and progressive, although they were detailed. Other 
things were involved that made it trying. In spite of some obstacles that had 
nothing to do with Dave or Jeff Klein, we are able to fulfill what he indicated 
to our fans, that Dave Winfield is going to come to Southern California. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Dave Winfield is right there with Reggie Jackson in terms of leadership 
capabilities and in the performance sense, his ability to carry a club on his 
back for several days if need be. When he gets hot, he can take up a lot of 
slack." 
</P>
<P>
Winfield's contract extension has a no-trade clause. However, it does not 
contain any stipulations regarding contributions by the Angels to the Winfield 
Foundation, a charitable enterprise that was one of many sources of friction 
between Winfield and Steinbrenner over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield and Steinbrenner went to court after Steinbrenner tried to prove that 
Winfield was using foundation funds for personal enjoyment rather than for the 
benefit of others, and the dispute was settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the acquisition of Winfield is settled, Port said he could "set sail" 
on another deal that would reduce the Angels' outfield surplus. The Angels must 
also make a roster move before Winfield can play because they are at the 
25-player limit.

PIECING THROUGH THE LAKER WRECKAGE; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: EVERYONE HAS A THEORY ABOUT WHAT WENT WRONG, BUT NO ONE KNOWS 
WHAT CAUSED THE COLLAPSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The way some talk, the Lakers' mystifying playoff collapse should be included 
in the next Time-Life book of unexplained phenomena. These people are convinced 
that outside forces were involved in the team's sudden demise after a decade of 
prominence. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, the loss to the Phoenix Suns in the Western Conference semifinals, 
after winning an NBA-best 63 games in the regular season, is not easily 
explained. There are the tangible reasons, supported by statistics. But there 
also are a lot of theories twisting around the Forum like Kevin Johnson on a 
layup. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry West, the Lakers' general manager, offered no quick and definitive 
explanations Wednesday. West has his theories, like everyone else. His mean 
more, because he will determine the team's future. 
</P>
<P>
And West promised that changes will be forthcoming. Already, there has been 
talk that the Lakers will pursue free-agent forward Sam Perkins or John (Hot 
Rod) Williams. Trade talk, come late June, will heat up. 
</P>
<P>
For now, though, West is groping for reasons and solutions. 
</P>
<P>
"No one knows why," West said. "I don't know. But it happens. It's perplexing. 
Everyone wants to blame someone. I think you can blame the team, en masse. 
Blame them all. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I knew why we didn't play like the team we were in the regular season. 
This makes my job harder." 
</P>
<P>
West said he awoke at 4 a.m. Wednesday, thoughts already racing through his 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
He has heard all the theories -- some rational, some outrageous -- that have 
circulated from the expensive courtside seats to the press table to the parking 
lot that West likes to stalk during stressful moments in games: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Minnesota Timberwolves, not Phoenix, beat the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Say what? The expansion Timberwolves did not even qualify for the playoffs. 
But in October, Minnesota President Bob Stein, who has a football background, 
turned down a Laker offer of two first-round draft choices and reserve center 
Mark McNamara for Rick Mahorn, who had told the Timberwolves he would not play 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
It was a deal most could not refuse. Minnesota did. A month later, Mahorn was 
traded to Philadelphia for one first-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
Mahorn is the physical big man the Lakers lacked. Certainly, he could have 
prevented Sun center Mark West from dominating the middle. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't tease me," said Magic Johnson, when asked about Mahorn as a Laker. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to add a big man, get someone big and strong. I said it all season, 
and I'll say it now. Vlade (Divac) played good, but him and Mychal (Thompson) 
are still the same. They aren't strong. Every team you see that's in there now 
has two different types of players. From San Antonio, who go from (David) 
Robinson to Frank (Brickowski) to Caldwell (Jones). Portland has (Kevin) 
Duckworth and (Wayne) Cooper. You gotta have a blend, and we got two guys who 
are just the same." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Lakers miss Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
 During the regular season, no. But in the playoffs, the Lakers could have used 
Abdul-Jabbar in the middle. Teams did not double-team James Worthy in the low 
post as long as Abdul-Jabbar was around. Even at 42 last season, Abdul-Jabbar 
filled space in the lane, if nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Johnson said the Lakers missed Abdul-Jabbar's playoff-ready attitude. He 
suggested that newer Lakers had not adopted that approach. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year, we changed over (mentally) from the other season to the playoffs. 
That never happened. We used to crank it up another notch. That's where you 
miss Kareem and other guys that are used to being there. It used to be, bam, 
we're a different team." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Players are tired of Riley's dogmatic approach. 
</P>
<P>
 For as long as West can remember, there has been grumbling among the team 
about Riley's taxing practices. Just last weekend in Phoenix, Riley unleashed 
two screaming fits. Some players felt it was uncalled for. Others passed it off 
as typical Riley motivational tactics. 
</P>
<P>
But West and Johnson both defended Riley, who has said he wants to remain Laker 
coach next season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always easiest to blame the coach," West said. "In this case, it's 
grossly unfair to do it. I've never heard of any team where players don't 
complain. Our players are treated well, from a coaching and management 
perspective. The grumblings I've heard are the same grumblings I've heard for 
30 years." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said: "He's definitely the coach for this team. There's no problem 
there. We won 63 games. He's had us there all these years. Now, to say it's his 
fault is ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Other Western Conference teams have improved more rapidly than at any time 
in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
This is undeniable. Phoenix won 55 and 54 games the last two seasons. Portland 
posted a franchise-high 59 victories this season. Utah had a franchise-high 55. 
San Antonio pulled an NBA-record 35-game turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew it was going to be tough," Johnson said. "The NBA was the strongest 
this year as ever before. The West has been super-strong. We knew coming in, 
whoever we faced would be a tough opponent." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Outside shooting, not outside forces, did them in. 
</P>
<P>
 Byron Scott, fighting injuries all season, had a poor offensive season. He 
averaged 15.5 points and shot 47%. In the playoffs, he dipped to 13.4 points 
and 46.2% shooting. Michael Cooper shot 38.7% in the regular season and 28.6% 
in the playoffs, Larry Drew 44% and 37.5%. 
</P>
<P>
West said that acquiring a shooting guard -- coming off the bench, most likely 
-- is a priority. 
</P>
<P>
"We need help, I don't think there's any question," West said. "We need more 
support off the bench. We felt we needed a shooting guard this year. That's why 
we signed Quintin Dailey, and that didn't work out. That hurt." 
</P>
<P>
One report is that the Lakers will try to trade Scott while his value is still 
high. West said he always listens to offers about all of his players. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Lakers overemphasized the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 West laughed. 
</P>
<P>
"What, we should have tried to finish with the worst record? Our players like 
to win all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 -- They are too old. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers have seven players 30 or older. Thompson, at 35, and Cooper, at 34, 
are the oldest. Thompson is signed through next season. All Cooper has to do is 
pass a physical to get his contract renewed automatically through next season. 
</P>
<P>
West did not reveal his plans for Thompson. But he said of Cooper: "He's been a 
very integral part of our success. I would assume that Michael Cooper will 
(eventually) retire here." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The demands of fatherhood . . . Five Lakers became new fathers during the 
season, two for the first time. The theory goes that those dead-of-night 
feedings were disruptions and sapped strength. 
</P>
<P>
"No, that's not it," Orlando Woolridge said. "You deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
 -- It was the L.A. Kings jinx. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers borrowed King owner Bruce McNall's private jet for the Phoenix 
series, and everyone knows the Kings are always eliminated in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bart Simpson is their muse. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the start of the playoffs, the Lakers posed for a promotional poster 
with the animated cartoon family, "The Simpsons." And isn't Bart's motto, 
"Underachiever and proud of it?" 
</P>
<P>
West believes that although it may have been the case in the playoffs, the 
Lakers will not be chronic underachievers. He said he will make changes without 
breaking up the core of the team. 
</P>
<P>
West said Divac probably will be the starting center next season, pending 
another Yugoslav army deferment. "I feel like, in Vlade, we've got someone else 
we can start building around," West said. "Here's a kid who's going to be a 
real fine NBA center." 
</P>
<P>
New additions figure to be role players, though West did not rule out a 
so-called blockbuster trade if he thought it would benefit the team. The Lakers 
also will pursue free agents, but they might be financially constrained because 
both Johnson and Worthy are expected to seek contract renegotiation. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't have to be a (star)," West said of new players. "It can be support 
people. Your great core players usually do their end of it. Those are people we 
are delighted with. Other people, we're going to take a look at. We'll listen 
to people, but that's not unusual." 
</P>
<P>
West also had been listening to those theories attempting to explain his team's 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
"You people are always doing this, telling us what's wrong," West said. "It's 
almost laughable at this time of year." 
</P>
<P>
But he wasn't laughing.

<P>
When the fish are in Pine Creek, there's no time to waste. 
</P>
<P>
"I was down working on my Jeep Sunday when Ernie (Spalding) called and said, 
'Hey, there are fish running,' " Laird Marshall Jr. said. "So we were up here 
Monday bright and early." 
</P>
<P>
With their rods and flies? 
</P>
<P>
Hardly. Fishing at nearby Eagle Lake doesn't open until the Saturday before 
Memorial Day -- May 26 this year. Spalding, whose ancestors helped to settle 
the area of the lake in the mid-19th Century, is a Lassen County sheriff for 
the Eagle Lake substation. Marshall is assistant manager of the state's Crystal 
Springs Fish Hatchery 65 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Each spring, at the first hint of a thaw, Marshall eagerly awaits Spalding's 
call. 
</P>
<P>
"He usually doesn't call when the creek runs," Marshall said. "He calls when 
the creek is running with fish." 
</P>
<P>
That means the Eagle Lake rainbow trout are trying to spawn. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is always critical. No other game fish has shown it can tolerate 
the high alkalinity of Eagle Lake, and yet there is no adequate spawning area. 
This year, the creek -- the lake's only significant inflow -- ran only three 
weeks. Two years ago, it ran only four days. 
</P>
<P>
The trout, driven by instinct, don't know that even if they managed to lay 
their eggs and escape before the creek ran dry, their fry would never survive. 
That's why for more than 30 years the California Department of Fish and Game 
has played midwife. 
</P>
<P>
As they head upstream, the fish find their way blocked by a 3-foot-high weir, 
with flat board fingers extending to prevent their leaping the falls. Instead, 
they are diverted into a trap along one side and milked of their eggs and 
sperm, which are transferred to the hatchery. The biggest and best of the 
spawners go back into the lake, to be rejoined by some of their offspring a 
year later. 
</P>
<P>
Others go to other Northern California lakes, where they are prized for their 
hardy nature. There are about 100,000 Eagle Lake fingerlings at Fish Springs 
Hatchery in the Eastern Sierra waiting to be planted late this summer in 
troubled Crowley Lake as sub-catchables. 
</P>
<P>
Especially around Northern California, Eagle Lake rainbows are special. They 
are selectively planted at about three-quarters of a pound and, thriving where 
other fish would fail, they grow to two pounds in one year, to three pounds in 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
They're large enough that the lake limit of three -- two fewer than the new 
statewide limit -- seems fair. Six-pounders are caught often, 12-pounders 
occasionally. Catches averaged 16 1/2 inches on opening weekend last year. The 
best fishing is over the underwater springs that replenish the lake. 
</P>
<P>
Also, in "California Trout" by Jim Freeman, the author writes: "The Eagle Lake 
trout are deep-bodied and the flesh is both firm and fine-grained, making them 
some of the best eating trout in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, they are still "wild" fish. They just took a detour through a 
nursery. 
</P>
<P>
Doc McCormack, manager of the Crystal Springs hatchery, said: "Basically, 
that's a brood pond for us. We put the fish back in there. They grow up to 
brood fish, and then we spawn 'em. We're just doing what nature is unable to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Nature has always had its capricious way with Eagle Lake. Its level fluctuates 
constantly, and the fishing has been diversified, if not always bountiful. 
</P>
<P>
The lake lies in a volcanic region at 5,100 feet on the east side of Lassen 
National Park. According to the book "Purdy's Eagle Lake" by local historian 
Tim Purdy, after an earthquake initially dropped the level two feet in 1889, 
over the next several years it gradually rose to its highest historic levels, 
until man intervened. 
</P>
<P>
The lake has no natural outlet, but in 1923 a developer, Leon Bly, built an 
irrigation tunnel that took the lake to its lowest level over the next 12 
years. Until then, the lake was known for truckloads of trout, and largemouth 
bass did well for a time, but attempts to establish populations of browns, 
silver salmon and other species failed. Finally, the alkalinity increased as 
the lake level dropped, and the bass were unable to reproduce, totally 
disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in November, 1986, after many years of financial problems and water 
rights disputes, the Bureau of Land Management had the tunnel sealed, and Eagle 
Lake's latest comeback seems hindered only by the continuing statewide drought. 
</P>
<P>
With a pH alkalinity factor of between nine and 10 (seven is neutral), only the 
Eagle Lake trout remain, sharing the lake with non-game tui chub and Tahoe 
suckers. And the trout were barely hanging on when the DFG took a renewed 
interest in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall said: "Historically, they think the only way the fish stayed in this 
stream and in the lake was that they stayed in the upper reaches of Pine Creek 
that never dries up. Then, in good water years, their offspring would replenish 
the lake." 
</P>
<P>
In 1956, the DFG took a half-dozen of that original stock, spawned them 
artificially and subsequently planted about 3,000 offspring back into the lake. 
In 1958, the project sped ahead with the construction of the fish trap and 
egg-collecting station. 
</P>
<P>
This spring, the U.S. Department of Agriculture declared an "extreme drought" 
condition for the region. One or two launching ramps may be unusable, and the 
water may warm earlier than usual, but the fishing should still be good. 
</P>
<P>
The creek ran strong enough and long enough that DFG workers collected 
1.1-million eggs -- 10% more than their goal -- which they expect will result 
in about 850,000 fish, allowing for attrition. 
</P>
<P>
About 200,000 of the largest will be recycled into Eagle Lake next year. 
</P>
<P>
"The small fish don't come (back) here," Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
The DFG also has some insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll selectively spawn some of the larger fish, and those eggs will be 
specifically earmarked for a broodstock program at Darrah Springs Hatchery and 
raised there until about six months prior to spawning," Marshall said. "Then 
they'll be transferred to Mt. Shasta Hatchery and spawned. 
</P>
<P>
"That's our backup if the whole fishery in this lake falls down. We have Eagle 
Lake trout in the hatchery system, either coming up as catchables or future 
broodstock." 
</P>
<P>
The DFG intends to keep Eagle Lake for Eagle Lake trout. 
</P>
<P>
Don Weidlein, DFG supervising fishery biologist for northeastern California, 
said the alkalinity is "extremely high and higher than most trout can survive 
in . . . (but) I think other fish would probably survive, particularly as water 
quality improves in the future, which it should do with the sealing of the 
tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
"I would suspect that Lahontan cutthroat would survive better than Eagle Lake 
trout, based on work we have done elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
In one project at Indian Tom Lake, cutthroat survived, but Eagle Lake trout 
didn't -- although Weidlein points out that other water quality factors also 
could be important. His greatest fear is that someone might illegally introduce 
bass back into the lake, upsetting the delicate balance. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a disaster for the trout fishery," he said. 
</P>
<P>
During the spring run, a DFG employee lives in the small shack on a bluff above 
Pine Creek, near the fish trap. If the stream flow varies, he must adjust the 
flow through the trap accordingly to avoid losing any fish. At least once this 
year, the attendant, Al Johnson, had to get up at 2 a.m. to do it. As it was, 
of 475 fish handled this year, only five failed to survive the stress of the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
One day this spring, Marshall and Johnson were working in the enclosed 
streamside chamber where the diverted flow brings the fish into tanks the size 
of wash tubs. Marshall held while Johnson squeezed. Gently. The eggs oozed into 
a pan. Then Johnson squeezed a male over the eggs to fertilize them. 
</P>
<P>
Periodically, DFG assistant Dottie Mason took a pan and poured it into a milk 
can. Soon there were enough cans in the pickup truck to start the 1 1/2-hour 
ride to the hatchery. 
</P>
<P>
These eggs were in the tender "green" stage. At the hatchery, they were ladeled 
into incubator trays, where they were kept until reaching the more stable 
"eyed" stage, when the dead ones could be eliminated. In about 32 days they 
hatched. 
</P>
<P>
In 56-degree water, Marshall said, some domestic broodstock will hatch in 22 or 
23 days, but the water temperature at Crystal Springs is only about 48, "so 
that slows 'em down." 
</P>
<P>
That's OK. There's no hurry, at least until next year.

PREP BASEBALL: WESTLAKE EMERGES FROM LAST YEAR'S DEBACLE AND ASCENDS TO A LOFTY 
25-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A steep 80-foot dirt embankment at the base of the right-field fence at 
Westlake High gives opponents fits. A fielder is allowed to climb the hill to 
catch a fly ball, and Westlake outfielders hold an advantage because they do it 
in practice. 
</P>
<P>
"The secret is not to look down," said Matt McHendry, a Westlake right fielder. 
"Never look down." 
</P>
<P>
The team is heeding that advice as it enters the playoffs Friday precariously 
perched on the top rung of the Southern Section ladder. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake (25-1), which plays host to Mira Costa (13-13), is seeded No. 1 in the 
5-A Division and is ranked No. 2 in the nation by USA Today. The players insist 
that congratulations, however well-deserved, remain premature. 
</P>
<P>
"Forget 25-1, forget our rankings, it's a new season," catcher Mike Lieberthal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
An admirable -- and perhaps necessary -- approach to the playoffs. But forget 
this season? No way. Study it as a blueprint for what every high school team 
strives to become. Surely, when their season does end, Lieberthal and his 
teammates will savor the memories for a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors opened the season by winning the El Segundo tournament, defeating 
highly regarded Millikan, Edison and Culver City in the final three games. Then 
they blew through the Marmonte League with a 12-0 record en route to Westlake's 
first league title. 
</P>
<P>
The only loss came in the first round of a spring-break tournament in Las 
Vegas, the morning after the trip from Westlake Village turned into a 10-hour 
ordeal when the team bus broke down. 
</P>
<P>
Since the loss, Westlake has won 10 in a row, prompting ovations at student 
rallies, a large and vocal following at games and a pervasive feeling of 
invincibility among the players. 
</P>
<P>
Said pitcher Mike Eby: "It's been a fun year, a great year." 
</P>
<P>
And a major surprise. Last season under first-year walk-on Coach Rich Herrera, 
Westlake fumbled its way to an 11-13 record, making 42 errors. Under Rich's 
brother, Larry, the junior varsity was 8-13. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, the names are the same. No star player transferred to Westlake. 
Rich, 26, is still the walk-on coach; Larry, 25, is the third-base coach. 
</P>
<P>
How did Westlake transform from a below-average team into a national power? The 
changes were subtle, yet substantial. 
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal, one of the best high school players in the nation, moved from 
shortstop to catcher, enabling Tim Falsken to move from second base to 
shortstop and Rick Wolters to move from backup catcher to second base. Each 
player has flourished at his new position, and they combine with fleet center 
fielder Rob Neal to give the team exceptional defense up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
Eby (9-0, 1.37 earned-run average) learned a changeup that has become his best 
pitch, making him a cut above the typical two-pitch high school hurler. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera developed a softer touch with the players. "Last year they were tight 
because I put pressure on them," he said. "This year, I'm more easygoing. They 
know me, I know them." 
</P>
<P>
Above all, the amazing turnaround is a testimony to friendship and flexibility 
in a program notorious for producing players whose opinions of themselves 
soared higher than the hill in right field. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera is Westlake's sixth coach since the program began in 1978. The first 
five were vilified by overbearing parents and underachieving players who had in 
common only uncommon selfishness. The team was 40-115-5 through 1985 and did 
not make the playoffs until 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Last season was more of the same. 
</P>
<P>
"Guys were saying, 'I hope this guy doesn't do well so I can get in,' " Falsken 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, anyone wishing to toot his own horn had better join the school band. There 
is no room in the dugout for inflated egos. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year everyone just played for themselves," Lieberthal said. "This year, 
everyone has pulled together. Team unity is the main reason we've been so 
strong." 
</P>
<P>
Players lavish praise on one another. Lieberthal, rated the No. 3 high school 
player in the nation by Baseball America magazine, would as soon discuss 
teammates as himself, using the tone of a proud brother. "Watch us take 
pregame. Every guy has arm strength," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Credit Herrera with recognizing that a kinder, gentler approach would increase 
harmony. He had impressive credentials as an assistant on two 
conference-champion Oxnard College teams and as an assistant on two Rio Mesa 
High Southern Section champions. Yet he admits to having been self-conscious 
about his youth last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the kids the first day of class, this is the way it's going to be," he 
said. "It was a tough year. I felt like I had to come in and command respect." 
</P>
<P>
The respect has been earned rather than demanded. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year Coach Herrera tried to put his foot down," left fielder Sean Howard 
said. "This year, he knows each player and everyone is more comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Herrera is able to admit to a mistake and take a suggestion -- even from 
players. Falsken proposed an alternative to the double-steal defense Herrera 
had implemented. "It made sense, so now we do it his way," Herrera said. 
</P>
<P>
The coach's youth seems like an advantage now. "He cares what we do off the 
field. He's like a part of us," Howard said, noting that Herrera recently took 
photos of players and their dates before a prom. 
</P>
<P>
In the evenings, players might gather at Lieberthal's back-yard batting cage or 
relax at Falsken's house. Whatever they do, it's together. 
</P>
<P>
"We go out on weekends and after games. We have fun together," said Neal, the 
center fielder. "There isn't one guy on this team I don't like." 
</P>
<P>
Winning, of course, serves as excellent bonding for friendships. It's difficult 
to dislike a teammate who drives you home every time you reach base. 
</P>
<P>
For Westlake, victory has become inevitable, as if a game cannot end until the 
Warriors have the lead. "In the late innings, you can feel it in the dugout," 
Eby said. "We just know we're going to pull it out some way or another." 
</P>
<P>
The feeling was spawned during an 8-7 comeback win over Millikan in the El 
Segundo tournament the second game of the season. Westlake trailed, 7-2, in the 
third inning but pulled to within 7-5 on a three-run home run by 
designated-hitter Keith Hess and won on a three-run home run by Lieberthal. 
</P>
<P>
"After coming back against Millikan and beating Culver City in the final, we 
knew we could go all the way," outfielder Keenan McAluney said. 
</P>
<P>
Five league victories were decided by one run, including two in extra innings. 
Westlake marked its league opener with a five-run, seventh-inning rally that 
overcame a 4-2 deficit. The next game, at Royal, was won in the ninth on a 
run-scoring double by Lieberthal. 
</P>
<P>
The heroics continued. Neal singled home Falsken in the seventh to beat Newbury 
Park, 2-1. Eby pitched a one-hitter to beat Channel Islands, 1-0. Third baseman 
Todd Preston singled home the winning run in the seventh to defeat Thousand 
Oaks, 4-3. Lieberthal singled home Wolters in the eighth inning of a 4-3 win 
over Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Once we learned we could win the close ones, we've fallen into a cycle," said 
Falsken, who has scored 36 runs and is batting .389. "We'll have big innings in 
the first or second, do nothing in the third through fifth, then turn it on." 
</P>
<P>
The team motto, "A Hard Seven," underscores the desire to play well in the late 
innings. "Last year we only played a hard three or four innings," Herrera said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Westlake can be explosive, the bulk of the offense has been carried by 
the lineup's top four hitters -- Neal, Falsken, Lieberthal and Hess -- who have 
scored 110 runs and driven in 95 of the team's 184 runs. Besides those four, 
only Eby and utility player James Jones are batting above .300. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense has to get the credit," said Herrera, noting in particular 
Lieberthal's arm, Neal's range and the play of the infield. "We don't beat 
ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Because none of the pitchers are overpowering, defensive lapses would be 
devastating. 
</P>
<P>
"We make the routine plays, we have all year," said an appreciative Eby, whose 
excellent changeup upsets the timing of hitters and induces them to put the 
ball in play with less than their best swing. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera, who pitched at Rio Mesa High and Oxnard College before becoming an 
assistant coach at those schools, convinced Eby that mixing in some change 
would make him a money pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"High school hitters are taught how to hit the fastball and curve," Herrera 
said. "If you can throw a changeup for strikes, you'll win." 
</P>
<P>
Eby pulls the string and leaves hitters hanging. "I make them get themselves 
out rather than having to get them out." 
</P>
<P>
Also flustering hitters are James Clark (6-0), Scott Lerner (4-0) and Donnie 
Hill (2-1). Clark, a junior left-hander, has been especially effective, 
fashioning a 1.17 ERA despite striking out only 17 in 36 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Falsken (4-0, 0.41 ERA) was a strong closer early in the season but he hasn't 
pitched in five weeks because of a tender shoulder. That type of misfortune 
could have provided a ready excuse for late-inning losses. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake, however, has had no need for alibis. 
</P>
<P>
'Twas the night before the playoffs and all through Westlake Village . . . 
</P>
<P>
Players wore only their stirrups to bed? 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of superstitions, that's one of them," Wolters said. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera cannot discourage such behavior, not when he plays the same song on his 
car stereo driving to the field every game day. "Even if I have to rewind it 
three times," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And not when Larry Herrera has that same penny in his pocket, the one he found 
while coaching third base when the team trailed Millikan, 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
Superstition is a way of handling anxiety. And winning can cause more stress 
than losing as long as expectations remain unmet. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake opened with 15 wins, stumbled once, and won 10 more. The playoffs are 
five games long if a team continues to win, and going all the way would give 
the season a nice symmetry. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing the coaches said this year was mark June 2 on your calendars, 
that's the day of the finals," Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
Hence the Warriors' reluctance to reflect on their accomplishments just yet. 
They are reminded every time they look toward right field: Never look down.

COACH SURPRISED BY YOUNG ROLLING HILLS TEAM'S TIE FOR BAY LEAGUE TITLE

<P>
Garry Poe has experienced many emotions in 20 years as the Rolling Hills High 
baseball coach. 
</P>
<P>
There was the exhilaration of 1972, when the Titans upset El Segundo and the 
legendary Scott McGregor, 2-0, in the Southern Section 3-A semifinals. 
"McGregor was considered unbeatable," Poe said of the ex-Baltimore Oriole 
left-hander, who was 51-6 in his prep career. Rolling Hills went on to defeat 
Katella of Anaheim, 3-2, for the 3-A championship. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the disappointment of last season, when Rolling Hills lost five 
of its last six games to fall from first to fifth in the Bay League and drop 
out of playoff contention. "Everyone was looking for us to have a great year," 
Poe said. "Unfortunately, my rain dance didn't prove very efficient and we had 
to play the last six." 
</P>
<P>
And now there is the surprise of 1990. With only three returning starters and 
five seniors on the varsity, Rolling Hills was considered a year away from 
contending for the Bay League title. But the Titans overcame inexperience to 
tie Torrance and Beverly Hills for the championship, the school's first league 
title since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"A real pleasant surprise like this one is worth waiting for," Poe said. "The 
kids have been enthusiastic and upbeat the whole time. For 20 years it's been 
fun, but every once in a while you get surprised." 
</P>
<P>
Poe wants the surprises to continue Friday, when Rolling Hills (12-11) plays 
host to Angelus League runner-up St. Paul of Santa Fe Springs (17-9) at 3:15 
p.m. in the first round of the 5-A Division playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans haven't won a playoff game since 1984, and another early exit isn't 
out of the question. Poe didn't expect to get even this far after the 1989 team 
graduated its top three pitchers, two all-league outfielders and an all-league 
catcher. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a complete make-over," Poe said. "We were so young, I really didn't 
expect a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills keeps surpassing expectations, especially when Kirt Kishita 
pitches. 
</P>
<P>
The junior right-hander, the starting first baseman as a sophomore, beat every 
Bay League team on his way to a 7-1 record. Kishita (8-4 overall) also plays 
second base and ranks second on the team with a .403 batting average. 
</P>
<P>
"He's improved so much," Poe said. "Most of it has been on-the-job training. 
He's done a wonderful job of keeping everything in balance. He's poised every 
time out. We feel so comfortable with him on the mound." 
</P>
<P>
Tristan Paul is another junior who has played a key role. The shortstop and No. 
2 pitcher, Paul leads the Titans with a .408 average. "He's one of the better 
athletes in the area," Poe said. 
</P>
<P>
With 12 of 17 varsity players returning, Rolling Hills could be looking at 
another championship season in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
But, as Poe can tell you, there are no sure things. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills continued a pre-playoff tradition Tuesday, splitting the team for 
a rousing game of Frisbee baseball at Torrance Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The seniors and sophomores beat the juniors and freshmen, 14-12, in seven 
innings. The game ended with runners on second and third. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a bit of a surprise," Poe said. "All those juniors thought they would 
outrun the seniors, but experience counts in Frisbee baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nice break. Too much of the time you get caught in that grind during 
the season. You need a change of pace." 
</P>
<P>
Poe said much of the credit for the Titans' success belongs to walk-on 
assistant coaches Tom Papadakis and Tom Vick. 
</P>
<P>
"They help out part-time, but they're usually there at the right times," he 
said. "They did a great job of balancing me and keeping the kids in balance. 
The kids have responded so positively." 
</P>
<P>
The 1972 Rolling Hills team that won the 3-A Division title was led by pitchers 
Mike Ongarato and Tom Bondurant and catcher Phil LaFollette, a 5-foot-5, 
125-pounder who was named to the All-CIF first team. 
</P>
<P>
Ongarato was drafted out of high school and played triple-A ball for the Boston 
Red Sox. Bondurant pitched for Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
Bondurant's biggest victory at Rolling Hills came when he won the duel with 
McGregor in the '72 semifinals. That season, the El Segundo ace was 17-2 with 
an 0.24 earned-run average and 175 strikeouts in 117 innings pitched. 
</P>
<P>
McGregor's 51 career victories is still the Southern Section record. 
</P>
<P>
McGregor also holds the Southern Section record for consecutive shutouts with 
six in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Right-hander Rob Croxall, El Segundo's current ace, is in the middle of a 
similar streak. He has not allowed a run in 30 consecutive innings since St. 
Anthony scored off him in the sixth inning of a Camino Real League game April 
5. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Croxall's impressive streak, Coach John Stevenson hasn't decided who 
will start El Segundo's Southern Section 2-A playoff opener Tuesday. The 
top-seeded Eagles (24-3) have a first-round bye Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from Croxall, the team also has two capable starters in right-hander Tate 
Seefried and left-hander Jason Wayt. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to say (who will start)," Stevenson said. "We're going to go with at 
least two (starters in the playoffs), and it's nice to have that third one. I 
don't see it as a major issue. I think all three are good enough to win." 
</P>
<P>
Croxall is 9-1 with an 0.71 ERA, Seefried is 7-1 with a 1.58 ERA and Wayt is 
6-1 with a 2.62 ERA. In addition, junior Brian Wise, a left-hander, has a 2-0 
record and an 0.41 ERA. The Eagles boast an outstanding team ERA of 1.44. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd have to go back a long time to find (an El Segundo) staff that has this 
quality," Stevenson said. "We have four guys who would be aces on any other 
staff in the area." 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson said he will probably decide on a starter for Tuesday's game after 
watching Santa Clara of Oxnard and Morro Bay play Friday. The winner meets El 
Segundo, the defending 2-A champion. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside girls' basketball Coach Frank Scott said there was a good chance he 
would have been hired as an assistant coach at Cal State Long Beach if Lisa 
Leslie had picked the 49ers instead of USC. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a strong possibility," he said Tuesday, one day after the 6-5 Leslie 
signed with USC. "But I'm not really disappointed. Who knows? Maybe I'll get 
the same offer at (USC). It's possible, but nothing is definite now." 
</P>
<P>
Scott said he is pursuing a college job. He has coached Morningside for 10 
years, guiding the Lady Monarchs to two state titles, four Southern Section 
titles and eight consecutive league titles. 
</P>
<P>
"If something breaks, I might possibly be leaving," he said. "I'd say it's 
about 60-40 that I will be back at Morningside. I've done just about everything 
on this level. I'm ready to explore new territory." 
</P>
<P>
Sisters Brigit and Beth Tapp, two of the busiest athletes at West Torrance 
High, will help lead the Warrior softball team against visiting Laguna Beach at 
3 p.m. today in the first round of the Southern Section 3-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Brigit, a senior who bats lead-off, ranks second on the team with a .352 
average. She also has 21 steals. Beth, a sophomore who bats fifth, is fourth on 
the team with a .327 average. 
</P>
<P>
This is the third sport in which the sisters have competed this school year. 
They also played on the soccer and volleyball teams, and this summer they plan 
to compete on traveling softball teams. 
</P>
<P>
"They live this stuff 12 months out of the year," said Bob Tapp, the girls' 
father. 
</P>
<P>
West (17-5) tied South Torrance for the Ocean League title, while Laguna Beach 
(10-6) took third in the Pacific Coast League. South (17-3) plays host to 
Capistrano Valley (15-10) in another playoff opener today. 
</P>
<P>
PREP NOTES -- Bishop Montgomery and St. Bernard will hold a weightlifting 
competition from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday at Bishop Montgomery to raise funds 
for the schools' football programs. It will also give the teams a chance to get 
acquainted with each other before meeting next season as new members of the 
Mission League. . . . Former El Segundo baseball standout Jeremy Carr, freshman 
center fielder for Cuesta College in San Luis Obispo, has been named to the 
All-Western State Conference first team. Carr, the left fielder on El Segundo's 
1989 2-A Division champion team, batted .321 with an on-base percentage of 
.615. He led the conference with 16 stolen bases and was named the conference's 
best defensive outfielder by the coaches.

WINNING OVER A FRIEND; 
</P>
<P>
WAVES' MELENDEZ MAKING AN IMPACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a picturesque afternoon in Malibu Canyon with clear skies and plenty of 
sunshine. Sitting in the baseball field bleachers at Pepperdine University, Dan 
Melendez is all smiles as he watches the ocean waves crash along the cliffs 
below him. 
</P>
<P>
Melendez, a 1989 graduate of St. Bernard High, said life at Pepperdine 
definitely agrees with him. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't imagine being anywhere else right now," Melendez said. "Is this the 
way to live or what? This place is almost too good to be true." 
</P>
<P>
From where Melendez is sitting, he certainly seems to be on top of the world. A 
freshman on the baseball team, he has started at first base in all of the 
Waves' 63 regular-season games. He is batting .320, has scored 36 runs and is 
second on the team in runs batted in (49) and home runs (10). 
</P>
<P>
Although Melendez has suffered from a sore left thigh the past two weeks, he 
has played with pain. 
</P>
<P>
His play has so impressed opposing coaches that he is the leading candidate for 
West Coast Conference freshman-of-the-year honors. 
</P>
<P>
Melendez could improve his reputation further with an outstanding performance 
this weekend in a critical three-game series against 11th-rated Loyola 
Marymount. Pepperdine (35-22 and 22-11 in the WCC) needs to sweep the series to 
claim its seventh consecutive WCC title and receive an automatic bid in the 
NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves, who without a sweep would be a borderline team for an at-large berth 
in the tournament, have beaten the Lions in two of three games. 
</P>
<P>
But there is more at stake for Melendez than a conference championship and a 
postseason award. The fact that he wasn't actively recruited by nearby Loyola 
and is good friends with the Lions' starting left fielder, Tim Williams, an '87 
St. Bernard graduate, makes a good performance even more important. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you could say I'm feeling some pressure about this series," Melendez 
said. "For the seniors, I want them to be have been part of a program that 
never lost a WCC title. And as a freshman, I want to continue that tradition of 
winning here." 
</P>
<P>
It's been an up-and-down season for Pepperdine, which started off slow but is 
finishing strong. The Waves are a young team and Melendez is one of four 
freshmen starters. His ability to adjust quickly from high school to college 
baseball has drawn praise from his coaches and teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"I recruited Dan with the intention that he would be able to come in and 
start," said Pepperdine Coach Andy Lopez. "But he has even exceeded some of my 
expectations. He has stepped into some critical situations and really performed 
well. We've asked a lot of him, but he's been able to adjust." 
</P>
<P>
One of the first things Lopez asked Melendez to do was bat fourth behind senior 
Chris Martin. Opposing pitchers haven't been able to look past Martin since 
Melendez has posted some impressive numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"Dan swings the bat very well," Martin said. "I've scored a lot or runs off his 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
"Every one on the team knows he's a good player, but he's not cocky at all. 
He's handled the pressure well, especially for a freshman." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez also has asked Melendez to give up his pitching and concentrate full time 
on playing first base. The result is a new respect for defense and a better eye 
at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Melendez was a top pitcher at St. Bernard his junior and senior seasons. He 
also played in the infield and led the Vikings to the Southern Section 2-A 
Division playoffs both seasons. He was selected to the all-Southern Section 
first team both seasons and was player of the year as senior when he was 12-3 
pitching and hit .530. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very relieved at not having to pitch any more," said Melendez, who is 
6-foot-4, 185 pounds. "I never really liked pitching. It always made my arm so 
sore that I often was too tired to swing the bat. But my (high school) team 
needed me on the mound, so I did what I had to do. This season, however, I've 
been able to concentrate more fully on my swing and my defense. I'm definitely 
doing better at both things." 
</P>
<P>
St. Bernard Coach Bob Yarnall said Melendez definitely is commanding more 
respect at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's showing all the (professional) scouts that he should have been 
drafted higher," Yarnall said. "He's the best pure hitter I've ever coached. 
And I've had some big players come through here." 
</P>
<P>
Melendez was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the seventh round of June's 
amateur draft, but elected to go to college because he said he felt he wasn't 
ready for professional baseball mentally or physically. 
</P>
<P>
He won't be eligible for the draft again until the end of his junior year, but 
if he continues to perform at his current level, he will be drafted again. 
</P>
<P>
Melendez, who hasn't declared a major, said he anticipates a career in the 
major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"Dan is definitely a position player who will do very well in professional 
baseball," Loyola Coach Chris Smith said. "I watched him play all through high 
school and was always impressed with what he could do and with his attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"I was well stocked with first baseman, so I really couldn't recruit him. But 
the fact that he is doing so well doesn't really surprise me." 
</P>
<P>
Melendez is not surprised by his success, either. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal was to come here and start," said Melendez, who chose Pepperdine over 
USC. "The ability to battle for a starting job was a significant factor in why 
I came here. I had a hunch I could perform well on the college level. I'm 
staying quiet and working hard, but I'm pleased with my progress. 
</P>
<P>
"What a great place to play baseball. Definitely no regrets here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pals Off the Field, Foes on It 
</P>
<P>
Tim Williams and Dan Melendez were teammates on the St. Bernard High baseball 
team. Williams was Southern Section CIF player of the year in 1987 and 
Melendez, Williams' junior by two years, received the same honor last season. 
</P>
<P>
Both spurned professional offers to attend Southland colleges, Williams at 
Loyola Marymount and Melendez at Pepperdine. Both are having fine seasons. 
Williams has emerged as Loyola's left-handed power hitter and Melendez appears 
on his way to earning West Coast Conference freshman-of-the-year honors. 
</P>
<P>
They are close friends, taking batting practice together in their leisure time 
and talking on the phone weekly. 
</P>
<P>
But this weekend they are rivals fighting for the West Coast Conference title. 
Loyola and Pepperdine play a three-game, season-ending series in Malibu to 
decide the WCC title, starting with a 2 p.m. game Friday. They finish with an 
11 a.m. doubleheader Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola leads the conference by three games, so a Lion victory would clinch the 
title and the conference's NCAA berth. Pepperdine needs a sweep to force a tie, 
in which case the Waves would be declared conference champions by virtue of 
winning the season series.

EL CAMINO REAL'S PECK MASTERS SAN PEDRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like an artist, Chrissy Peck has taken pains to master her medium. Peck, the 
ace pitcher on the El Camino Real High softball team, has learned to brush back 
batters, canvass her domain on defense and paint the corners of the strike 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
And, as Peck displayed Wednesday against San Pedro, she also has learned to 
whitewash. 
</P>
<P>
Behind Peck's one-hit, 11-strikeout performance, El Camino Real defeated San 
Pedro, 7-0, to advance to the semifinals of the City Section Division 4-A 
playoffs. The Conquistadores will play Cleveland next Wednesday at South Gate 
Park. Cleveland beat Granada Hills, 14-4, Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Peck, the City 4-A Player of the Year last season who recently committed to 
play for Barry College in Miami, Fla., threw just 76 pitches. She retired the 
first nine batters and did not throw a ball through the first 2 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"When she's in a groove like she was today, she's just impossible," said 
Conquistadore Coach Neils Ludlow, whose top-seeded team improved to 21-3, also 
Peck's record. 
</P>
<P>
Peck, evidently a perfectionist, was not elated by her effort this season. 
</P>
<P>
"During the season, I did enough to get by," said Peck, who hurled three 
no-hitters. "I was satisfied but I knew I could do better. 
</P>
<P>
"After the third or fourth inning, I usually slow down and lose my 
concentration." 
</P>
<P>
Peck has been running wind sprints and taking extra pitching practice in 
preparation for the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
"She's committed," Ludlow noted. 
</P>
<P>
The defending 4-A champion, El Camino Real defeated San Pedro, 1-0, in last 
year's title game with Peck pitching. The Pirates (14-8) lost five All-City 
players to graduation and have struggled. 
</P>
<P>
"We were expecting a lot more," Peck said. "We weren't sure what they had. No 
one had seen them." 
</P>
<P>
Even with his standouts from last season, San Pedro Coach Tony Dobra conceded, 
Peck would have been tough to crack. 
</P>
<P>
"We hadn't seen anything like this in a month and a half," Dobra said. "She 
combines physical skills with mental skills and that's hard to beat." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real, which amassed eight hits, scored two runs in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Balint came home on an overthrow and Jenny Flemming singled in Alisha 
Knopf. Flemming also drove in Ann Antis with a sacrifice fly in a two-run 
second. 
</P>
<P>
Peck led off the fifth with a walk, advanced on an error and scored on a single 
by designated-hitter Heidi Crocker. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the fifth, Carrie Reulbach scored on Erin McGuire's infield single and 
Laurie Bischoff, who walked, came home on a fielder's choice. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro's lone single -- a chopper by Michelle Harper over first baseman 
Flemming -- came with two out in the third.

MIRA COSTA MEETS NEWPORT HARBOR IN QUARTERFINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Top-seeded Mira Costa High will travel to meet Newport Harbor at 7:30 tonight 
in the quarterfinals of the Southern Section 4-A boys' volleyball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The match was moved up a day because Newport Harbor's prom is Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want them laboring under that problem," said Mira Costa Coach Mike 
Cook, who had to agree to the change. "If my kids had the prom that night, I 
would hope my opponent would allow us to have the game early. Maybe someone 
will do me a favor someday." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor (11-5), which won the 4-A title in 1987, is led by setter Alex 
Opoulos, freshman outside hitter Mark McAnlis and 6-foot-3 middle blocker Ian 
Juberg. The Sailors defeated Leuzinger in the first round Friday, 12-15, 15-4, 
15-6, 15-4. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa (19-0) advanced with a 15-4, 15-5, 15-6 victory over Dos Pueblos of 
Goleta. The Mustangs have four players who have signed with major colleges: 
outside hitter David Swatik (UCLA), middle blockers Pat Ivie and Mike 
Ashenfelter (USC) and setter Canyon Ceman (Stanford). ROB FERNAS

CARSON HIGH SWIMMER SETS TWO CITY RECORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Claudine Martinez of Carson High broke records in the 200-yard individual 
medley and the 500-yard freestyle Wednesday night in the City Section swim 
finals in Long Beach. 
</P>

NEWSWIRE: PRYOR FINALLY GETS GO-AHEAD, KNOCKS OUT JONES IN 3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aaron Pryor, the former junior welterweight champion, returned to boxing for 
the first time in 17 months Wednesday night and knocked out Daryl Jones at 1:15 
of the third round at Madison, Wis., ending a day which saw the fight canceled 
and reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
Pryor, who was a champion from 1980-85, knocked Jones down twice in the second 
round. 
</P>
<P>
He then finished off his former sparring partner with a four-punch combination, 
ending it with a right hand. Jones tried to get up but was counted out. 
</P>
<P>
Pryor, 34, in his first fight since knocking out Herminio Morales in December 
1988, has been denied permission to box in four other states -- Nevada, New 
York, New Jersey and California -- because of impaired vision in his left eye. 
He underwent surgery on the eye in January 1988 to repair a detached retina and 
remove a cataract and is legally blind in the eye. 
</P>
<P>
Wisconsin gave him a tentative OK to box before a state licensing board on 
Wednesday morning denied promoter Diana Lewis a permit to hold the exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
The board denied the permit because Lewis' boxing company was not incorporated 
when she first applied. But a judge overruled the board hours later.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Might Drexel Burnham Lambert rise like a phoenix from the ashes of its 
bankruptcy? 
</P>
<P>
The odds are heavily against it. But Drexel's management and lawyers for the 
first time have raised the possibility that the firm might emerge from Chapter 
11 proceedings and go back into business in some form. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of several things we're considering," Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder 
said. "We haven't made a decision yet." 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Drexel has said the entire company would be liquidated. When the 
parent company, Drexel Burnham Lambert Group, was forced to file for bankruptcy 
protection on Feb. 13 due to a cash crisis, the firm and all of its 
subsidiaries abruptly stopped normal operations. They began winding down their 
positions in stocks, bonds and commodities. 
</P>
<P>
To date, the firm has fired all but about 500 of the more than 5,000 employees 
it had just before the bankruptcy. And in early June, an auctioneer in New York 
is due to sell off the bulk of Drexel's office furniture, computer equipment 
and cafeteria furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said, however, that Drexel Chief Executive Frederick H. Joseph is 
considering taking the firm back into business in some limited form as a way of 
increasing the possibility that the company's shareholders eventually will 
receive something substantial for their stock. Much of Drexel's stock is held 
by former or current employees, many of whom have a considerable part of their 
net worth tied up in it. They stand to get nothing unless Drexel's other 
creditors are paid in full first and the many lawsuits against the firm are 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said there is virtually no possibility that Drexel would attempt to 
resume operations as a securities broker-dealer. Instead, a reorganized firm 
might simply manage Drexel's remaining portfolio of junk bonds and other 
assets. Executives also are considering offering limited investment banking 
services to customers, although the sources said it is too early to speculate 
on what the services might be. 
</P>
<P>
Such an option might be attractive because Drexel has accumulated a huge net 
operating loss, in part from writedowns on the securities it has sold since the 
bankruptcy filing. Although the tax implications apparently haven't been worked 
out fully, the operating loss conceivably could be used to shelter any profits 
that the reorganized firm might earn. 
</P>
<P>
Anreder cautioned that complete liquidation of the firm is still one of the 
main options under consideration. However, others noted that there would be 
obvious advantages to avoiding selling off Drexel's remaining holdings right 
away. Much of Drexel's remaining assets are in junk bonds, bridge loans and 
partnership interests that may not be readily salable. With the junk bond 
market still severely depressed, sources say it might be more logical for 
Drexel to hold on to what remains and manage the assets rather than selling 
them off now at fire-sale prices. 
</P>
<P>
A big question, however, is whether a post-bankruptcy firm that attempted to 
attract clients would find public acceptance. The bankruptcy followed a severe 
decline in Drexel's business that stemmed partially from the firm's legal 
problems. Drexel pleaded guilty last year to six felony counts and agreed to 
pay $650 million in penalties for securities fraud related to the firm's junk 
bond operations. Many civil lawsuits related to that are still pending. 
</P>
<P>
A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Securities Corp., which 
provides institutional investors with analysis of the securities industry, said 
that if a new company emerged and kept the Drexel name, it might have trouble. 
But Lipper noted: "There are individuals there who have talent who I think 
would find acceptance with their clients." 
</P>
<P>
A source close to Drexel asserted that public hostility to the firm has abated 
since the bankruptcy filing and since former Drexel junk bond chief Michael 
Milken pleaded guilty last month to six felony counts. He said Milken thus 
personally shouldered some of the blame that previously had fallen on Drexel's 
top management. The source claimed that since these developments, "you don't 
see that much negativism around about Drexel per se." 
</P>
<P>
Drexel and its bankruptcy lawyers are believed to have begun working on a 
reorganization plan to file with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. The plan could call 
for resuming some operations or liquidating or other possibilities, such as 
placing remaining assets in a trust. Under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Code, the firm's management has the exclusive right until mid-June to formulate 
a reorganization plan. Drexel may seek an extension. If a deadline expires 
before the firm comes up with a plan, creditors would be free to propose their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel's creditors' committee, meanwhile, is continuing to weigh several 
options to ensure that creditors get paid in full. Among these, as reported, is 
the possibility of an attempt to recover $260 million paid out in bonuses to 
Drexel executives shortly before the bankruptcy. Thought also is being given to 
attempting to recover huge sums paid to Milken in the late 1980s, on the theory 
that the amount paid was so large that it couldn't have been for actual 
services rendered. Milken, for example, received $550 million in salary and 
bonus from Drexel in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for one Drexel creditor said that New York's "fraudulent conveyances" 
statute might allow creditors to seek to recover money paid to Milken as long 
as six years ago. New York law would apply since the company is based in New 
York and the bankruptcy was filed there, the lawyer said. A spokesman for 
Milken declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Creditors also are still considering whether to attempt to get back the $500 
million paid last year by Drexel in fines and penalties as part of the $650 
million that it had agreed to pay under the settlement of criminal and 
Securities and Exchange Commission charges. Creditors' lawyers have said 
bankruptcy law may allow them to reclaim the money. 
</P>
<P>
Marc S. Kirshner, the lead attorney for the creditors committee, confirmed that 
these options are being considered. But he refused to say when any action may 
be taken. Other sources close to the creditors' committee said members first 
want to get an accurate picture of Drexel's financial position. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent financial statement filed with the Bankruptcy Court, which 
includes Drexel's balance sheet as of March 30, appears to show that the 
company isn't insolvent. Assets exceed liabilities, leaving the company with a 
positive net worth of $444 million. This indicates that at least theoretically 
there is enough to pay creditors in full. 
</P>
<P>
But creditors say they aren't at all confident that the figures are reliable. 
Creditors say many of the assets are practically impossible to value 
accurately, since there is little or no current market for them. And they note 
that major new lawsuits keep popping up, such as a suit filed earlier this week 
by the central bank of Yugoslavia, which claims that it suffered a $70-million 
loss due to improper action by a Drexel subsidiary. The New York Stock Exchange 
also reportedly is considering fining Drexel as much as $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
One sign of the increasing restiveness of creditors is that two of Drexel's 
subsidiaries also have been forced into bankruptcy proceedings in the past few 
days. Until then, only the parent company was officially in bankruptcy. The 
units are Drexel Burnham Lambert Trading Corp. and Drexel Burnham Lambert Trade 
Finance Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The parent company's creditors committee is now embarking on an extensive 
program of "discovery" through the bankruptcy court. This involves subpoenaing 
records and taking sworn depositions of top Drexel officials. The aim is to get 
a more detailed understanding of the firm's financial position. One source said 
a main focus of the inquiry also will be to see if there were any improprieties 
in transactions between Drexel and its employees in the months preceding the 
bankruptcy filing.

BUCHWALD LAYS CLAIM TO CHUNK OF 'NET PROFIT' ON 'COMING TO AMERICA'; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: THE HUMORIST SAYS THE EDDIE MURPHY FILM EARNED $39.8 MILLION EVEN BY 
HOLLYWOOD'S UNIQUE DEFINITION. HE AND HIS PRODUCER WANT UP TO $14.6 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Preliminary audit figures released Wednesday by attorneys for columnist Art 
Buchwald and producer Alain Bernheim suggest that, far from losing $18 million 
on the hit Eddie Murphy comedy "Coming to America," Paramount Pictures Corp. 
earned a "net profit" of $39.8 million as of last December. 
</P>
<P>
Buchwald and Bernheim's share of that net ought to range between $6.9 million 
and $14.6 million, Pierce O'Donnell, their attorney, asserted in documents 
filed Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to misread the agreement to get to those figures," said Robert 
Schwartz, an attorney with O'Melveny &amp; Meyers, which represents Paramount 
in the case. "The studio's reaction is that their claims are baseless and 
unfounded. The studio is confident that (the trial judge) will see this as a 
transparent attempt by Mr. Buchwald and his attorneys to walk away from an 
agreement negotiated by his agent who, by the way, was the head of the William 
Morris Agency. 
</P>
<P>
"As to the auditor's claims regarding 'Coming to America' expenses, they're 
meritless." The humorist and his producer blamed the $58-million gap between 
what Paramount says the picture earned and what they believe that it earned on 
radically different methods that Paramount accountants and Buchwald's own 
auditor, Philip Hacker &amp; Co., used to compute production costs, interest 
expense and income on the motion picture. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount, for example, puts a $58.5-million price tag on the production, or 
so-called negative, cost of the movie, while Buchwald's calculations allocate 
only $22.9 million to make "Coming to America." Payments of $1 million for 
Eddie Murphy's entourage, $900,000 for excessive fringe benefits and a uniform 
15% "overhead" charge assessed to the entire production budget -- amounting to 
$8 million of the negative cost all by itself -- should not be included in the 
cost of making the movie, O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
The brief points out that $1.65 million of the $8 million in overhead "was 
merely for writing gross participation checks to Eddie Murphy and (director) 
John Landis." 
</P>
<P>
Paramount has maintained for months that, contractually, it owes nothing to 
Bernheim or Buchwald because the movie has earned no "net profits," as those 
profits are defined in their contract. 
</P>
<P>
Until last January, Paramount executives held that neither Buchwald nor 
Bernheim had any contractual claim at all to the 1988 box office hit. Buchwald 
sued, charging that the movie was based on an eight-page treatment that he sold 
to the studio in 1983 about an African king who comes to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In the film's credits, the screenplay for "Coming to America" is said to be 
based on a story written by Eddie Murphy, not Buchwald. 
</P>
<P>
In the first phase of a two-phase lawsuit tried in December, the 63-year-old 
humorist proved to the satisfaction of Judge Harvey Schneider that he, not 
Murphy, wrote the story upon which "Coming to America" is based. As a result, 
the 1983 contract -- which calls for a payment of between 19% and 40% of net 
profits to Buchwald and Bernheim -- is binding, Schneider ruled. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount has said it will appeal Schneider's decision, but in the meantime 
Buchwald's auditing team has been poring over the Paramount books to prepare 
for a July 9 trial on the accounting for "Coming to America" -- the second 
phase of Buchwald vs. Paramount. Wednesday's brief is the opening salvo in a 
barrage of charges and countercharges that the studio and the Pulitzer 
Prize-winning columnist are expected to level at each other in the weeks 
leading up to that trial. 
</P>
<P>
Buchwald auditor Hacker said the studio continues to withhold details of key 
expense and income items, such as a breakdown of foreign box-office revenue and 
videocassette sales. Given those figures, according to O'Donnell, his estimates 
on the net profit total for the $300-million box-office winner could be even 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest disparity between Buchwald's and Paramount's bottom line lies 
in how the humorist and the studio define the term "net profit." O'Donnell's 
114-page brief, which outlines a full-scale legal attack on the studio's 
accounting procedures, didn't confine himself to criticism of Paramount's 
bookkeeping. The brief took on the entire Hollywood studio accounting system, 
as it has evolved over more than half a century. 
</P>
<P>
The seven major film studios -- Columbia/Tri-Star, Disney, MGM/UA, Paramount, 
20th Century Fox, Universal and Warner Bros. -- have employed a 
"take-it-or-leave-it standard profit participation agreement" that makes it 
nearly impossible for most creative personnel involved in a film's production 
to share in the profits, according to the brief. 
</P>
<P>
"These agreements are 'standard' because you cannot negotiate them, you cannot 
get better terms elsewhere and your guild has been unable to get the studios to 
make them a subject of collective bargaining," the brief reads. "Literally, you 
can take it or leave it." 
</P>
<P>
Such agreements, which writers in particular must sign as their entree to 
Hollywood, define net profit participation in such a manner that even the most 
successful motion picture rarely goes into the black because of expenses that 
the studio purposely charges to the movie to maximize its own bottom line while 
minimizing the writer's, director's, actor's or producer's return, according to 
the brief. 
</P>
<P>
The studio "exploits . . . ambiguities (in its own standard profit 
participation contract) to the great financial detriment of profit 
participants" and "abuses its awesome power and unconscionable contract terms 
to manage the venture by making hidden profits, charging exorbitant interest 
and utterly destroying any hope of 'net profits' by self-interested acts," 
according to the brief. 
</P>
<P>
"Is Paramount right that Buchwald and Bernheim get only the leftovers -- a 
worthless share of an $18 million deficit -- while Paramount reaps a financial 
bonanza of at least $55.3 million?" the brief asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Is Paramount right that under the applicable law, the court is powerless to 
look behind the words of the form contract, which is the same one used by every 
studio, to scrutinize how it was unilaterally imposed upon Buchwald and 
Bernheim on a take-it-or-leave-it basis?" 
</P>
<P>
DUELING AUDITORS 
</P>
<P>
Auditors for Art Buchwald claim that the Eddie Murphy hit "Coming to America" 
had a $39.8-million net profit, not an $18-million loss as Paramount Pictures 
claims.

INNOVATION: CENSUS IS REGARDED AS JUST MORE JUNK MAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hey you! 
</P>
<P>
Yes, you. 
</P>
<P>
Did you mail in your census form? You didn't? You naughty, naughty citizen. 
Where's your sense of civic pride and public responsibility? Don't you know 
that the census is an integral part of tracking this great country we call 
America? 
</P>
<P>
Actually, I'm getting fed up with the hectoring we citizens are being subjected 
to because of our comparatively lackluster census response rates. The Census 
Bureau reports that only 76% of us have mailed in our forms -- a full 13 
percentage points behind the 1980 census levels. The return rate for the longer 
form lags yet another six percentage points behind 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Census Bureau Director Barbara Everitt Bryant blames citizen "apathy" as a key 
reason for the decline. She points out that the shortfall is consistent 
throughout the 50 states and that there's a high correlation between census 
return rates and voter turnout levels -- and we all know that voter turnout has 
been dropping like a stone. The director also notes that many people fear, 
incorrectly, that their responses may somehow become public and that their 
privacy will be violated. 
</P>
<P>
The real possibility of an undercount, of course, scares the dickens out of 
money-hungry big-city mayors with the visions of subsidies dancing in their 
heads as well as megalomaniacal politicos just aching to gerrymander 
congressional districts. 
</P>
<P>
With all due respect to the director and other census scolds, I don't think 
that the American people are as apathetic or as dim as their public servants 
think they are. (In fact, I have to admire the bipartisan gall of a do-nothing 
Congress and President watching the savings and loans bleed hundreds of 
billions of dollars while we are the ones who get called apathetic). Americans 
have perfectly good reasons to treat the census as cavalierly as they have. 
Let's look at some numbers: 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the total estimated U.S. population was 221.7 million. That year, the 
total number of pieces of regular, third-class bulk a.k.a. junk mail was 
roughly 22 billion. In 1989, the U.S. population was roughly 247.1 million and 
the total volume of junk mail, according to the U.S. Postal Service, was more 
than 50.7 billion pieces -- and that doesn't even include mailings from 
not-for-profit organizations. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, while the population of the United States grew about 10% in the 
last decade, the total annual volume of junk mail increased almost 150%. For 
all intents and purposes, the census form has become just another piece of junk 
mail; an ugly little gray envelope that is as intrinsic and inviting as yet 
another financial services circular from Merrill Lynch. It's a nuisance and 
Americans don't like nuisances. 
</P>
<P>
"What we see and a trend that's being seen all through the survey response 
field is where a decade ago you'd get telephone survey response rates of more 
than 80%, today, 65% to 66% is regarded as a good participation rate," says 
Andrew R. McGill, a group vice president with Sandy Corp., a Troy, Mich., 
company that does customer research for such giants as Nissan, Ford and General 
Motors. 
</P>
<P>
People are "just tired of getting called," says McGill. Is it really irrational 
for Americans to get fed up with a high-volume diet of surveys, inquiries and 
questionnaires? Let's not forget that in virtually every story you read about 
the census, it's being described as a treasure trough of data just waiting for 
the direct-mail marketeers to snuffle through. Reality dictates that the 
results of the 1990 census will launch yet another deluge of junk mail and 
micromarketing appeals. Is it any surprise that this prospect generates 
something less than enthusiasm? What the Census Bureau is seeing isn't apathy, 
it's a population that is past the point of diminishing returns when it comes 
to cooperating with yet another poll taker. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the census has to be another piece of junk mail," says Vincent 
P. Barabba, who ran the 1980 census and is now General Motors' executive 
director of market research and planning. "But there is a lot of clutter out 
there." Barabba mentions that Bryant was relatively new to the job and didn't 
have the time to form a team to promote census participation in the way he was 
able to a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
But let's also remember a few other points: The census remains a tasty and 
expensive morsel of political pork that provides hundreds of thousands of 
temporary jobs for people who just happen to know somebody. That always 
inspires citizen cooperation. What's more, any professional demographer and 
statistician will tell you that we don't really need to tap every single 
residence of the United States to paint a statistically accurate portrait of 
what the population looks like. Besides, if the census were really all that 
important, it wouldn't have been too difficult for the President, Barbara Bush 
and Millie the Dog to tape a couple of public service announcements. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is that, while times have changed, the census hasn't. With the feeble 
exception of a toll-free hot line number, there has been little creativity or 
innovation in the way this census was handled versus a decade ago. Whose fault 
is that? The only surprise here is that people are surprised. Better luck next 
time.

Southern Pacific May Leave San Francisco: Southern Pacific Transportation Co. 
may sell its downtown headquarters and transfer some or all of its 1,800 
workers out of San Francisco, spokesman Jim Loveland said. 
</P>
<P>
The sale could help relieve the company's burden of about $500 million in 
acquisition debt. But Loveland said offers for the building triggered the 
company's review of a possible sale. "We're going to analyze the process by 
which we might sell the building and move to less expensive headquarters -- 
possibly in the Bay Area or possibly outside," Loveland said.

LANDMARK AND HON AGREE ON PROPERTY DEAL; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPERS: THE ACCORD IS SMALLER THAN ONE SCOTCHED LAST WEEK BY REGULATORS. A 
BUYER IS SOUGHT FOR OTHER GOLF AND RESORT AREAS. 
</P>

Landmark Land Co. said Wednesday that it has agreed to sell a 6,700-acre 
Riverside County parcel to Laguna Hills developer Barry Hon for $275 million 
and has hired an investment banking firm to peddle the company's remaining 
big-name golf and resort assets. 
</P>
<P>
The new deal comes just nine days after federal thrift regulators blocked a 
$967-million sale of Carmel-based Landmark's prime properties to Hon. 
Regulators had called the original deal unsound because Landmark's subsidiary, 
Oak Tree Savings Bank in New Orleans, was providing too much financing to Hon. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that it was in the best interest of everyone to reach this revised 
agreement quickly," said Hon in a prepared statement. "I believe that this 
revised agreement gives us the best real estate development that Landmark owns 
and that we are still well positioned to purchase other Oak Tree assets." 
</P>
<P>
Under the revised deal, Hon would put $75 million down by the end of July for 
undeveloped land in a planned golf-course community called Oak Valley at Pomona 
Freeway and the I-10 freeway near Beaumont. Oak Tree would provide $200 million 
in financing. Regulators must approve the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
Landmark, a leading golf course and resort developer, holds and operates more 
than $1 billion worth of real estate through Oak Tree. But federal law enacted 
last August to bail out the ailing thrift deposit insurance system now requires 
S&amp;Ls to sell their interests in such investments within five years. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald G. Barton, Landmark's chairman, president and chief executive, said 
directors had wanted to dispose of the property in the way least disruptive to 
more than 3,500 employees who work in the golf, hotel and real estate 
development and operations divisions. The original deal with Hon would have 
transferred those divisions intact. 
</P>
<P>
In the face of federal objections, though, directors decided Tuesday to hire 
Salomon Bros., a New York investment banking firm, to try to come up with a 
buyer for the entire company, Barton said. Any buyer interested only in the 
real estate operations could sell Oak Tree to a third party, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had the financial capacity, we'd pull out the real estate companies 
ourself" and put them in the holding company, he said. "Since we don't, we have 
to look elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
While he acknowledged that few prospective purchasers are large enough to buy 
Landmark, which has $3 billion in assets, Barton said he believes that Salomon 
will come up with offers in one to three months. Salomon also will look into 
other options, including the possibility of bringing new investors into Oak 
Tree. 
</P>
<P>
As a last resort, he said, Landmark would liquidate Oak Tree's real estate 
investments over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
Since the original deal with Hon was announced in mid-April, Landmark's stock 
has taken a beating on Wall Street. The price has fallen from $17.50 a share on 
the day the deal was announced to $10.875 a share at the close of trading on 
Wednesday, up 50 cents a share from Tuesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
Stock analysts and financial advisers had doubted that the first deal with Hon 
would go through. It was structured to close in two phases over a year with a 
total of $200 million in cash from Hon and more than $750 million in financing 
from Oak Tree, an amount that represented more than 25% of Oak Tree's assets 
and made regulators balk. 
</P>
<P>
In the revised deal, Hon gives up his plans to own resort properties in three 
states, more than 10,000 acres of developable land and such golfing jewels as 
PGA West, La Quinta and Mission Hills Country Club, all in the Palm Desert 
area. 
</P>
<P>
But the new agreement "makes more sense both for Landmark and for Hon," said 
Kenneth D. Campbell, an analyst with the Montvale, N.J., real estate investment 
advising firm Audit Investments Inc. "It gives Landmark more flexibility in 
dealing with others, and Hon can come in and bargain for whatever he wants." 
</P>
<P>
Though Hon couldn't be reached for comment, his lawyers and advisers agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe Mr. Hon got the pick of the litter and is still well-positioned to 
purchase other Oak Tree assets," said lawyer William Biel of Costa Mesa. And 
Hon's financial adviser, Vaughn Mahnke, said Hon will "remain a key player in 
the disposition of other of Oak Tree's assets."

MAXWELL AGREES TO ACQUIRE THREE SUPERMARKET TABLOIDS

British media baron Robert Maxwell said Wednesday that his Mirror Group 
Newspapers Ltd. has agreed to buy the gossipy tabloids Globe, National Examiner 
and Sun in the latest ownership shakeup among the publishers of magazines sold 
mainly in grocery checkout aisles. 
</P>
<P>
The value of the transaction was not disclosed. Maxwell said he hoped to 
complete the purchase from Globe International Publishing Inc. by mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
Globe International, a privately held publishing concern based in Montreal, 
said the combined circulation of the three weekly magazines exceeds 2.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The deal comes amid a major consolidation among the supermarket tabloids. 
</P>
<P>
The publisher of the National Enquirer, the supermarket tabloid leader with 
circulation of more than 4.1 million, recently agreed to buy the second-biggest 
tabloid, the Star, which sells an average 3.6 million copies a week. 
</P>
<P>
The buyer, G. P. Group Inc. of Lantana, Fla., said in late March that it had 
agreed to pay at least $400 million in cash and securities to Rupert Murdoch's 
News Corp. for the Star. 
</P>
<P>
The Globe International tabloids would be Maxwell's first magazines in the 
United States, where his main interest has been book publishing and information 
services. Maxwell Communications Corp. bought Macmillan Inc. two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell also is chairman and chief executive of Britain's Mirror Group PLC, 
which publishes the Daily Mirror, the United Kingdom's second-largest 
newspaper, and other newspapers such as Sporting Life and the Daily Record and 
the Sunday Mail in Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
Its Mirror Group Newspapers unit recently launched the European, an 
English-language weekend newspaper for Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell reportedly lost out in bidding for the National Enquirer, which was 
sold last year by the estate of founder Generoso Pope Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The tabloid went to a group that includes the media investment company 
Macfadden Holdings Inc. and Boston Ventures Management Inc. for $412.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Globe and the National Examiner each have been published for about 35 
years. The Globe originated as a local entertainment magazine in Montreal 
called Midnight while the National Examiner had its roots in the Midwest, 
according to Globe International spokesman Dean Heine. 
</P>
<P>
He said Mike Rosenbloom, the owner of Globe International, acquired both the 
Globe and National Examiner about 20 years ago. Rosenbloom started Sun about 
nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Audit Bureau of Circulations said the Globe had an average circulation of 
1.33 million in the six months ended Dec. 31, down 12.9% from a year earlier, 
while the National Examiner averaged nearly 894,000, down 20.2%. 
</P>
<P>
The bureau does not audit circulation figures for Sun, but Heine said its 
circulation is about 450,000 a week. 
</P>
<P>
Heine said the three magazines emphasize entertainment and generally have moved 
away from the gruesome stories that once characterized the supermarket 
tabloids. 
</P>
<P>
In the current edition of the Globe, the cover features photos of actresses 
Vanna White and Linda Evans to accompany a featured story alleging they are "in 
a bitter battle for the same man." 
</P>
<P>
The National Examiner has cover stories claiming that former evangelist Jim 
Bakker is going insane and describing the plight of a tourist whose prosthetic 
plastic nose melted in the Florida heat. 
</P>
<P>
"Jesus back on Earth, say scholars" reads another cover headline. 
</P>
<P>
It publishes Bridal Guide, the humor magazine Cracked and Your Health magazine. 
It also publishes so-called mini-mags on topics such as calorie counting and 
horoscopes, detective magazines and puzzle books. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate announcement, Maxwell said he planned to buy a major stake in the 
Communist Party-owned Berliner Verlag, East Germany's biggest publishing house.

CIA RATES EASTERN EUROPE'S PROSPECTS; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: IT LOOKS FOR SHORT-TERM PAIN AND LONG-TERM GAIN. THAT'S MORE 
OPTIMISTIC THAN A SIMILAR REPORT ON THE SOVIET UNION LAST MONTH. 
</P>

<P>
Eastern Europe's emerging democracies face daunting problems, including the 
likelihood of deep recession, in shifting to a free-market economic system, but 
their long-term prospects are good if they can surmount these difficulties, the 
CIA said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A similar report on the Soviet Union, prepared by the CIA and the Pentagon's 
Defense Intelligence Agency in April, said the Soviet economy was so unstable 
that it could collapse in the face of any serious shock. 
</P>
<P>
But the agency's special report to Congress on Wednesday spoke of optimistic 
prospects for East European countries over the long run and praised governments 
such as Poland's for embarking on "unprecedented" reforms, even though they are 
likely to prove painful in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
It warned, however, that even countries that undertake needed restructuring 
face years of slow growth and high unemployment that could spawn serious social 
disruption and a severe political backlash that could set back reform efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the near-term pessimism, the CIA report was decidedly more 
optimistic than the one issued on the Soviet economy. It said that the response 
to reform efforts in Poland show that "an entrepreneurial spirit survives -- 
there are . . . risk-takers" left. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the document cautioned that "the realities of the economic 
situation facing the region are daunting," and "performance may be poorest in 
those countries pushing reform the hardest" -- at least until the harsh 
economic medicine has time to take effect. 
</P>
<P>
The agency also expressed optimism about the likely impact of the impending 
reunification of West Germany and East Germany, saying that it would "help 
jump-start" East Germany's economic recovery and could boost incomes there by 
5% a year. 
</P>
<P>
And it predicted that, with the Soviet presence now diminished, former East 
Bloc countries will begin cutting defense spending sharply, providing a kind of 
"East European peace dividend" that ought to free up needed resources to help 
finance economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's report is expected to bolster calls in Congress for added aid to 
Eastern Europe, although that was not necessarily its intent. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), chairman of the panel's subcommittee on national 
security, said the CIA's findings show that many East European countries "are 
in for a period of recession and economic crises. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope our own long-term policy will help provide stability and the necessary 
investments to work through these problems," Bingaman said. 
</P>
<P>
The White House has been urging caution in providing such help to make sure 
that the new governments undertake the proper reforms. But the lawmakers have 
consistently voted more money for Eastern Europe than the Administration has 
requested.

The 45-page report compiled for Congress' Joint Economic Committee said that 
despite "real progress" in moving toward a free-market economic system, most 
countries in the region lag behind in carrying out planned reforms. 
</P>
<P>
It said Western governments can play a major role in getting the region on its 
feet but that much of the help will have to come from private investment. Most 
lending from commercial banks already has dried up. 
</P>
<P>
And it predicted that the key to stability in the region will lie in how much 
hardship East European voters are willing to tolerate as they move toward a 
more productive economies. That "remains largely untested, even in Poland," the 
document said.

SOCIETY: ALUMNI AT SDSU TAKE TO THE FIELD FOR ONE LAST TIME 
</P>

<P>
At Aztec Bowl last Saturday, the twin concrete stands stood empty, seeming to 
stare moodily at each other across a football field that, in earlier days, rang 
to the chants of as many as 16,000 fans of the San Diego State University 
Aztecs and their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
The old scoreboard, which sees limited action now, was lighted and displayed: 
Visitors 00, Home 99. And, as the twilight shades gathered along the hand-set 
cobblestone walls, old Aztecs began to drift toward the northern end of the 
field. Most wore black tie. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the SDSU alumni were so eager to visit the site of former glories, in 
fact, that more than 20 couples arrived 30 minutes ahead of the official 
starting time of the university's 1990 Annual Alumni Awards Gala. This 14th 
annual event, "Memories: An Evening in Aztec Bowl," drew a record attendance of 
560, a figure that organizers attributed both to the roster of alumni to be 
honored -- it included journalist Eileen Jackson and her artist husband, 
Everett Gee Jackson -- and to nostalgia for the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Aztec Bowl, a Depression-era Work Projects Administration arena dedicated in 
1936, saw its last Aztec football game in 1966 and is scheduled to be 
demolished, after serving as the site of SDSU's May 27 graduation exercises, to 
make way for a student activities center that will include a 12,500-seat 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Gala chairwoman Yvonne Larsen, decorations chairwoman Betty Brayshay and their 
committee frosted the upper end of the field with grass-green carpeting and 
topped it with a great celebratory cake of a white tent, garlanded with 
red-and-black balloons and furnished inside with replicas of the school's 
campanile and with tables set in the SDSU crimson and ebony tones. The tent was 
ordered with clear sides so that, said Brayshay, everyone could "see the 
scoreboard and share in the nostalgia we all feel for the place." 
</P>
<P>
Not many in the crowd needed visual clues to prompt feelings of nostalgia, but 
the committee spread them around the perimeter of the outdoor cocktail area 
anyway, primarily in the form of photographs taken of attendees back in their 
undergraduate years. Most examined these with some care, and then trundled off 
to stare for another moment at what for many was a true field of dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Ben and Nikki Clay co-chaired a host committee of more than 40 couples that, 
without exception, were alumni or had at least attended the university. The 
idea was to give the couples a feeling of shared nostalgia, and it worked. Ben 
Clay recalled watching -- or rather, not watching -- a mid-1960s game against 
Fresno State that was so shrouded in fog that a spotter with a microphone had 
to be sent on the field to report the plays to the stands. Nikki Clay said 
that, in 1963, she rode around the field as queen of the high-spirited chariot 
races sponsored by SDSU fraternities; she represented Lambda Chi, which 
captured the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
"We made the cocktail hour extra long just to give everyone time to reminisce," 
said chairwoman Larsen, a 1952 graduate and a runner-up for homecoming queen. 
"I've been to lots of events on this field, and this stadium is filled with 
wonderful memories." 
</P>
<P>
The memories extended to the program, which offered photographs of important 
dates in Aztec Bowl history, such as the commencement address offered in June, 
1963, by President John F. Kennedy, and the placement of a plaque in May, 1983, 
that named the bowl California Registered Landmark No. 798. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU President Thomas Day offered an unexpected and solemn addition to the 
formal program by taking the podium to ask for a moment of silence in memory of 
Malcolm S. Love, who died earlier that day. Love served as president from 1952 
through 1971 and is credited for raising SDSU to preeminence in the California 
State University system. 
</P>
<P>
The program also included a welcome by Art Flaming, the outgoing president of 
SDSU Alumni &amp; Associates, who informed the crowd that there are more than 
100,000 SDSU alumni in the immediate area and then led the election of new 
officers, a most unusual feature at a fund-raising gala. Attorney Jim B. Kuhn 
was chosen to preside over the new slate of officers. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to name a couple as co-alumni of the year was unprecedented, 
although the choice of the Jacksons was indisputably popular. Eileen Jackson, 
who for 60 years has reported the city's social events for several newspapers 
and now writes a weekly column for the Tribune, let her husband do all the 
talking during the awards presentation. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking that, with all this publicity, I might run for some office, 
like city dogcatcher," Everett Jackson said to much laughter, adding, "but you 
were all on the beam in choosing Eileen for this honor." 
</P>
<P>
Named alumni of the year by the school's seven colleges and Imperial Valley 
campus were attorney Dwight Stanford, a graduate of the College of Arts and 
Letters; executive Arch Rambeau, College of Business Administration; investment 
real estate broker and former San Diego Chargers defensive back Willie 
Buchanon, College of Education; engineer William Sevier, College of Education; 
Union of Pan Asian Communities executive director Beverly Yip, College of 
Health and Human Services; educator Elena Castro of the Imperial Valley Campus; 
San Diego Union columnist Tom Blair, College of Professional Studies and Fine 
Arts, and biochemist and medical researcher E. Aubrey Woodroof, College of 
Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
The program followed a dinner of roast beef tenderloin bordelaise and 
strawberries Romanoff -- rather more elegant fare than most guests recalled 
consuming on other occasions in Aztec Bowl -- and preceded a live auction of 
five items particularly appropriate to the evening. The pace of the auction, 
conducted by 1961 graduate Bob Arnhym, picked up somewhat after a friendly San 
Diego skunk paid a call to the immediate neighborhood; a choice item on the 
block was the right to lead the SDSU Marching Aztec Band during halftime at the 
1990 homecoming game against the University of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
The attendance included Frank and Marsha Aronoff, Betty Hubbard, Tom and Tracy 
Stickel, Tim and Sharon Considine, Kay North, Tom and Judy Carter, Kim and 
Marilyn Fletcher, Roy and Judy Lessard, Anne Evans, Doug and Betsy Manchester, 
Tammy Smith, Dick and Liz Miller, Gordon and Karon Luce, Roger Conlee, George 
and Ethel Sorenson, Dick and Betty Meads, Bruce and Mary Hazard, Lee and Sharon 
Grissom and Bob and Patricia Menke.

ARCHITECTURE: IS GASLAMP RIGHT SPOT FOR CONDO TOWER? 
</P>

<P>
Developer Neil Senturia, a former television sitcom writer, is about to spring 
some high drama on the city of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Senturia wants the city to approve a 325-foot-high building in the historic 
Gaslamp Quarter downtown, an area zoned for a maximum of 125 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
Several key people within the city's urban planning system are opposed to the 
project's height, including City Architect Mike Stepner; Max Schmidt, Centre 
City Development Corp.'s urban planning expert, and Pam Hamilton, CCDC's 
executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
During the coming months, Senturia will try to persuade the City Council to go 
against the advice of its top planners, arguing that the design fits in with 
nearby high-rises. Going against aides' advice would not be unprecedented. Last 
year, the council approved a 38-story luxury condominium project on lower 
Broadway, despite Stepner's reservations about its height and bulk. 
</P>
<P>
Some council members said they won't make a decision until they get a good look 
at Senturia's project, probably this summer, after an environmental impact 
report is completed. 
</P>
<P>
The site Senturia has optioned (he doesn't own it yet) for the project, Park 
Plaza, is bounded by 5th Avenue, K Street, 3rd Avenue and Harbor Drive, at the 
southern entrance to the Gaslamp Quarter across from the San Diego Convention 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
The $75-million complex would include 25,000 square feet of retail space and 
150 
</P>
<P>
condominiums. The building would have a six-story base and a 27-story tower, 
set close to K Street and 100 feet back from 5th Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Senturia, a short, wiry, articulate, gregarious man and a preference for crisp 
dress shirts and well-polished shoes, has been working as a developer in San 
Diego since 1985. Some of his projects include the Union Bank building at 5th 
and University avenues in Hillcrest, One Harbor Drive (a pair of 41-story 
downtown luxury condo towers scheduled to break ground June 15), a single-room 
occupancy hotel at 4th Avenue and Fir Street and a large parking structure 
being built on 6th Avenue, between A and Ash streets downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Senturia laid out his argument for Park Plaza last Friday in his offices in a 
downtown high-rise, where he enjoys sweeping views of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The project has already gone through many design revisions. Senturia initially 
worked with Arquitectonica, the hip, slick, Miami firm, but its design 
apparently didn't please either Senturia or city officials. 
</P>
<P>
"It was some of the poorest site planning and design I'd seen," said City 
Councilman Ron Roberts, the lone council member trained as an architect. "There 
were four buildings, with two on Harbor Drive, and none of the architecture or 
site planning related to anything around it." 
</P>
<P>
Senturia now agrees that the scheme wasn't right for the location. 
</P>
<P>
Senturia's argument in favor of his 325-foot tower is that, because several 
larger high-rises are about to be built 
</P>
<P>
nearby along Harbor Drive (including his own One Harbor Drive), and because the 
Park Plaza site actually stretches beyond 4th Avenue (outside the western 
boundary of the historic district), his tower is really as much a part of 
intense adjacent redevelopment as it is a part of the low-scale historic 
district. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't placate people like Howard Greenberg, a Gaslamp Quarter Planning 
Board member who is converting the low-rise Pioneer Warehouse to apartments, 
across K Street from Senturia's site. 
</P>
<P>
"I fought long and hard for the increase to 125 feet, and I thought that was 
pushing the envelope," Greenberg said, referring to the area's initial height 
limit of 75 feet. "For someone to come in over 300, I think, is pushing the 
envelope too far." 
</P>
<P>
Architect Ralph Roesling, who sits on the Gaslamp board, prepared a computer 
model of the Gaslamp Quarter, including Senturia's project, to study building 
heights and bulk. Roesling also helped write the plan that convinced the city 
to increase the height limit to 125 feet from 75 feet in select cases. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's too high," Roesling said of Park Plaza. "That project is 
definitely within the Gaslamp Quarter district, and they're asking for 325 
feet. That would be so out of scale with everything else, I think it would be 
wrong." According to Roesling, the tower would cast large shadows across 5th 
Avenue in the afternoon, besides towering over surrounding buildings. 
</P>
<P>
High-rise units generally bring premium prices, and Senturia said a lower 
building would be "less economically feasible." 
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, several Gaslamp Quarter businesses have struggled or died 
during delays in the building of the Horton Plaza shopping center and the San 
Diego Convention Center. However, even after those projects opened, many 
businesses continued to stagger, and members of the Gaslamp Quarter Council 
(now Gaslamp Quarter Planning Board) began thinking that a few large new 
projects, probably hotels, would help turn business in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
When the city of San Diego wrote a plan to limit new buildings to 60 feet (75 
in some cases), the Gaslamp Quarter Council commissioned its own height study. 
The conclusion: buildings up to 125 feet should be considered for four large 
parcels, including Senturia's. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego City Council passed a Gaslamp planning ordinance solidifying this 
policy late last year, with Senturia's project excluded. 
</P>
<P>
Judged without consideration for height, the present design is a sound piece of 
architecture, though not the masterpiece that Senturia claims could spawn a 
whole new phase of downtown architecture. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the six-story portion of the project, along 5th and K, looks very 
good, with Senturia promising to use high-grade stone such as granite, brick 
and ceramic tile on the base, and reinforced concrete panels for the tower. 
</P>
<P>
Low-rise facades along K and 5th are well articulated, and these buildings 
would be punctuated by bay windows echoing the bay windows found on many other 
Gaslamp buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Senturia rightly described the site as the gateway to the Gaslamp Quarter, an 
important "transition" block. The corner of the project closest to Harbor Drive 
would be anchored with a low, open pavilion. Broad stairs would lead from 5th 
Avenue to second-level terraces. 
</P>
<P>
The design of the project's back portion is crucial because it would face the 
pedestrian-oriented "linear park" designed for the city under the direction of 
San Francisco landscape architects Peter Walker and Martha Schwartz, with the 
local Austin Hansen Group and several artists. 
</P>
<P>
Park Plaza's two tiers of restaurants would step down to meet the park, and 
Senturia is offering to donate part of the land for park use at one corner of 
his site. 
</P>
<P>
The tower steps back and would be crowned with Mission tile. It would feature a 
circular sundial emblem created by local artists. The proportions are good, but 
the tile seems too cute a way to incorporate local Spanish influences. 
</P>
<P>
There is also some question as to whether the existing buildings on Senturia's 
site should be destroyed. None is great architecture, but one was designed by 
early 20th-Century architect William Hebbard, who gave architect Irving Gill 
his start here. 
</P>
<P>
Historic Site Board chairwoman Kathryn Willetts said there's a valid argument 
that the buildings should remain, if only to retain the scale and character of 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
Senturia's project isn't yet scheduled for hearings at the CCDC, Historic Site 
Board or City Council. Tuesday, he made the latest of several presentations to 
the Gaslamp board. 
</P>
<P>
The most logical response to his 325-foot fantasy seems to be the one offered 
by Stepner and echoed by many others: 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a very handsome building that deserves to be built somewhere, but 
my question is, is it in the right location?"

DA PROBES GLENDORA INSURANCE PRACTICES; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: MAYOR BOB KUHN IS CO-OWNER OF AN INSURANCE FIRM HANDLING SOME OF 
THE CITY'S BUSINESS.

<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office is reviewing the city's 
insurance practices, including its purchases through a brokerage agency 
co-owned by Mayor Bob Kuhn, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
City records show that the city, without soliciting competitive bids, has paid 
$126,528 for insurance policies purchased through Kuhn's Glendora-based 
company, Alandale Insurance Agency, since Kuhn joined the City Council in 
April, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"To avoid any possible conflict of interest," the city is moving to terminate a 
Parks and Recreation policy, carrying a $4,500-a-year premium, obtained through 
Alandale, Finance Director Larry Schroeder said. That is the only 
Alandale-brokered policy currently in effect, he said. Other policies have been 
shifted since 1988 from Alandale, co-owned by Kuhn and Cleve Traughber, of La 
Canada Flintridge, to a firm Traughber co-owns with other partners. 
</P>
<P>
Records show that Kuhn has voted at least three times since 1986 to approve 
payments of city insurance premiums totaling $7,475 to Alandale. He abstained 
from voting on 13 other payments to his company. 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn, who in statements of economic interests has disclosed that he owns a 
share of Alandale worth more than $100,000, vigorously denied any impropriety. 
He said he could not specify how much his firm has earned in commissions from 
city business but said he himself has not profited. 
</P>
<P>
Traughber, who said he has handled the city account since 1972, said the 
commission is usually about 15%. Using that figure, Alandale's commissions from 
city accounts would have totaled more than $18,000 since July, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, state Government Code Section 1090 prohibits officials from 
being "financially interested in any contract made by them in their official 
capacity, or by any body or board of which they are members." 
</P>
<P>
State Deputy Atty. Gen. Ted Prim said there are some exceptions to the law in 
cases where a contract predates an official's election. 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn, in office four years, said the city has a longstanding relationship with 
Alandale, dating to 1968. He became a co-owner of the firm in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Prim refused to discuss the matter further or to explain how it might relate to 
the Glendora situation. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office is reviewing the city's dealings with Alandale 
as well as the city's methods of obtaining insurance in general, Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Thomas Wenke said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking to see if there's a conflict of interest in the city's 
insurance practices," Wenke said. "We want to make sure their procedure for 
acquiring insurance is in accordance with what the (Municipal) Code requires." 
He declined to provide further details. 
</P>
<P>
The review was sparked by complaints from a Glendora resident, said 
investigator Rick Daum of the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
The state Fair Political Practices Commission has received at least one letter 
about the insurance matter and has undertaken a review, commission spokeswoman 
Jeanette Turville said. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, who became finance director last summer after serving as acting 
director since 1988, said he inherited the Alandale account and simply 
continued it. He said the mayor has never influenced his selection of an 
insurance brokerage firm for the city. "It was my choice," Schroeder said. 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn said that he tries to abstain from voting on all insurance matters and 
that he has conscientiously tried to disqualify himself from any votes 
concerning payments to his company. He noted that long "warrant registers" 
listing bills paid by the city are routinely submitted to the City Council for 
review and approval. 
</P>
<P>
"If I see our name on it, I abstain," Kuhn said, but added that he might have 
overlooked a few. "Sometimes there are 150 or 100" names on the list, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn said Alandale's commissions on city business were used for office overhead 
or to pay the agent who secured the policies. The city's current policy through 
Alandale, which covers the city's summer youth sports program, does not 
generate any commission, Kuhn said. Traughber, however, said the policy carries 
a 15% commission. 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn said City Atty. Cheryl Kane told him that there was no conflict of 
interest in Alandale's doing business with the city "as long as there was no 
direct income to me." 
</P>
<P>
Kane refused comment. "I don't discuss my advice to my clients," she said. 
"That's privileged communication." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, one council member has raised questions about the propriety of 
transferring accounts from Alandale to Glendale Insurance Agency Inc., which is 
co-owned by Traughber, Kuhn's business partner in Alandale. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman David Bodley said he fears that Glendale might have received the 
city business "because they're friends of Kuhn, and here he is sitting on the 
council." 
</P>
<P>
Bodley and council members Larry Glenn, Marshall Mouw and Molly MacLeod said 
they will seek more information about the insurance decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Traughber said he and Kuhn decided during the 1988-89 fiscal year to shift city 
business to Traughber's firm to "get it (the city's account) completely out of 
conflict of interest." The Parks and Recreation policy was overlooked because 
it is relatively small, Traughber said. 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn denied that he took part in the decision to transfer the policies to 
Glendale and said he has not sought to influence any of the city's insurance 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Since the shift in 1988, records show, the city has paid at least $123,816 for 
insurance policies purchased through Glendale Insurance Agency, which is based 
in Glendale. Traughber said he owns a third of the firm. Kuhn has no financial 
interest in the Glendale agency. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, Kuhn has voted to approve five payments to Glendale Insurance, city 
records show. He has abstained in three payments to the agency. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor said his votes on payments to the Glendale agency are irrelevant 
because he does not hold an interest in that firm. "If no money changes hands, 
what difference does it make?" Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Government Code, an official may not take part in decisions in which 
he has a "financial interest." The state Code of Regulations says that 
"financial interest" includes businesses deemed "otherwise related to" an 
official's own firm. Factors determining whether a business is "otherwise 
related" include sharing management and control, resources or employees. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State records list Traughber and Dan Johnson of La Canada 
Flintridge as officers of both the Alandale and Glendale agencies. State 
Department of Insurance records list Traughber and Johnson as licensed agents 
of both firms. 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn, who said he owns more than two-thirds of Alandale, said he bought out 
Johnson's interest in Alandale last spring and plans to buy Traughber's 27% 
share as well. The mayor said he alone controls Alandale. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson emphasized that the mayor holds no financial interest in Glendale. "Bob 
Kuhn in no way, shape or form derives any remuneration from the fact that 
Glendale underwrites the insurance for Glendora," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the city's insurance, $229,502 in premiums for liability coverage 
in 1989-90, is handled by the Independent Cities Risk Management Authority, a 
26-city insurance pool, Schroeder said. Kuhn, who was instrumental in setting 
up the pool in 1986, said he helped the city obtain lower rates by transferring 
most of its coverage from Alandale to the pool. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said he expects the pool, as it grows, to handle more of the city's 
insurance needs. Meanwhile, he defended using Alandale and Glendale as brokers 
for smaller policies. "Once a broker gets to know you and your needs, sometimes 
there's no reason to go out for a bid," Schroeder said. "Cleve (Traughber) has 
done it for a long time, and the rates seem to be right in there." 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said Kane told him that insurance placement does not fall within the 
provisions of the city's purchasing procedures. The procedures, spelled out in 
Glendora's Municipal Code, require the city to solicit bids for professional 
services and for formal contracts exceeding $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
Kane again refused comment. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said Alandale has brokered a number of different policies for 
the city, including insurance covering worker's compensation and city cars and 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn also defended the city's brokerage decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"Why would they change agents when they've had an agent working on it for 
years?" Kuhn said, referring to Traughber. "Cleve -- he understands the 
business, the needs of the city, that the infrastructure is how old it is." 
</P>
<P>
Lee Lewis, technical director of the 11,000-member Independent Insurance Agents 
&amp; Brokers of California, said most cities do not use brokers. Of those that 
do, the usual pattern is to put the contracts out to bid every three years, he 
said. But "it is not unusual to stick with one," he added. 
</P>
<P>
That may be because there are so few insurers from which to choose, he said. 
Fewer than 10 companies in the state are willing to insure cities, Lewis said. 
"Some (cities) don't even shop because the market is so low." 
</P>
<P>
During budget discussions that begin next week , Bodley said, he plans to 
suggest that the city begin putting its insurance business out to bid.

<P>
More police officers would be hired under a $1.7-billion city budget that 
continues to dip into the city's meager surplus funds and calls for city 
departments to cut spending by 1%. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach's soaring crime rate and community complaints about police services 
left a mark on the city manager's 1990-91 budget proposal, which would add 14 
officers and seven civilian positions to the police force. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Ernie Kell, in a turnabout, is suggesting that the city dip even further 
into its surplus funds and add 10 officers beyond the 14 recommended by City 
Manager James Hankla. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Kell was adamant that reserves not be used for long-term costs, such 
as police staffing. He persuaded the City Council to instead spend a portion of 
the 1989 budget surplus on sidewalk repairs, a move for which he has been 
criticized in this spring's mayoral race. 
</P>
<P>
But caught in a runoff race amid continued rises in the crime rate, Kell this 
year wants the council to spend nearly $1 million more than Hankla is 
recommending for police staffing and is suggesting that two of the new officers 
be assigned to anti-graffiti duties. 
</P>
<P>
The call for more police comes on top of a June 5 ballot proposal that would 
create a new property tax levy to expand the 677-member Police Department by 75 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to make it clear that those proposals to increase the number of police 
officers in no way supplant the need for another 75 officers that we are asking 
the voters to approve on June 5," Kell wrote in in his budget letter to the 
council this week. "Long Beach needs both . . . to put enough officers on the 
street to fight crime and improve response time to citizen calls." 
</P>
<P>
The General Fund portion of the budget, which pays for basic city services, 
would increase 4.8% to $287 million, while the total budget would jump 22% to 
nearly $1.7 billion. Much of that spending is earmarked for self-supporting 
departments over which the council has no control, such as the Harbor 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from extra police services, Hankla's spending plan also calls for minor 
expansions in a variety of other areas. A nurse would be hired for the city 
jail, several nursing and laboratory positions would be added to the city 
health department, staffing will be slightly increased for senior citizen 
programs at city parks, and a $217,000 literacy program would be started by the 
public library system. 
</P>
<P>
Under two pilot projects, 50 city vehicles would be converted to burn 
compressed natural gas rather than gasoline, and trash dumpsters would be 
purchased for automated garbage trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 14 police positions recommended by Hankla, four would be assigned to the 
airport and would be paid for out of airport funds. The seven civilians would 
be hired to free the same number of officers from desk duties, allowing them to 
work on crime investigations. The park ranger program, under which armed park 
rangers patrol city parks, would also be expanded with the conversion of three 
part-time positions to full-time slots. 
</P>
<P>
About $240,000 was also added to the budget to continue anti-gang programs. 
</P>
<P>
General Fund income will fall short of expenses by about $4.4 million, forcing 
Hankla to turn to end-of-the-year reserves to make up the difference. Under 
Hankla's plan, all but $1.4 million of the reserve fund would be spent in the 
coming fiscal year -- in addition to the $2.5 million the city must by law hold 
in reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Kell's proposal to hire even more police would further whittle the reserve, 
leaving just $400,000 in surplus funds at the end of the coming fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
To find money for programs, Hankla is asking all his departments to cut their 
spending by 1% in the coming year and cut their use of the city vehicle fleet 
by 10%, for a total savings of about $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
A number of city fees would also be increased, including charges for city 
garbage collection, marina slips, oil production, paramedic ambulance service 
and public health licenses. 
</P>
<P>
The department cuts will not require any layoffs, and Hankla said the public 
shouldn't notice any difference. "There will be no noticeable service cuts as a 
result of the budget," Hankla said at a budget briefing for the press Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"If this was a perfect world and our crime rate was going down and not up, I'd 
probably like to be sitting on about a $9-million reserve," Hankla said. 
</P>
<P>
Reductions in federal revenue sharing and drops in the city's once-bountiful 
oil income have taken their toll on the city's budget, which is also hurt by a 
relatively small sales tax base. 
</P>
<P>
Glancing quickly at the budget, council members said they generally supported 
the push for more police. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I favor, rolling up our sleeves and doing what we can to maximize 
our (police) coverage," Councilman Warren Harwood said. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is that if we had been doing this for the last 10 years, we 
wouldn't be in this situation," said Councilman Les Robbins, saying the city 
never should have allowed the ranks of the police force to thin to the point 
they have. 
</P>
<P>
As for the skimpy reserve funds, Robbins said: "It is real risky. But I don't 
know what choice we have." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Clarence Smith also supported more spending on police, but he 
lamented the absence of more recreation funding in the budget. "I think it's 
going to cost us more money if we continue to deny young people the chance to 
be involved in creative activities."

FAMILY FEUD; 
</P>
<P>
SISTERS OF MERRITT ADAMSON JR., ABOVE, ARE LOCKED IN A BATTLE WITH HIS WIDOW 
OVER CONTROL OF THE FAMILY'S VAST FORTUNE. THE CONTEST MAY ULTIMATELY DECIDE 
THE FUTURE OF MALIBU. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Merritt Adamson died of cancer in 1986at the age of 59, he left behind 
more than just his one-third share of a $75-million family fortune. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before he died, the real estate scion signed an agreement making his 
two sisters the sole guardians of a once-mighty Malibu land empire and leaving 
his widow, Sharon, with little say in the affairs of the Adamson Cos., the 
family firm. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Sharon Adamson and her former sisters-in-law are slugging it out in court 
for control of the contested third of the family holdings. Barring a 
settlement, the case is expected to go to trial this summer. But beyond 
settling a feud among wealthy heirs, the outcome may also play a key role in 
shaping Malibu's future. 
</P>
<P>
In its rush to install a sewer system in the seaside community, Los Angeles 
County has struck a private deal with the sisters, Sylvia R. A. Neville and 
Rhoda-May Dallas, to surrender six acres they own near Pepperdine University 
for the site of a sewage treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, the county offered to help expedite approval of a 300-room, 
$65-million hotel the sisters want to build in Malibu. The hotel, and 
Pepperdine's plans to double the size of its campus, depend on the sewer 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, however, the sewer appears to be less than a sure thing. Malibu 
voters are poised to decide June 5 whether the community becomes a city, and 
approval is widely expected. They also will pick a five-member City Council 
that is likely to be far less enthusiastic than the county has been about 
sewers, hotels and development in general. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, a judge struck down an attempt by the county Board of Supervisors to 
delay Malibu's actual incorporation date until next March if voters approve 
cityhood. The delay had been intended to enable the county to start work on the 
sewer before a new local government had the chance to block it. 
</P>
<P>
And despite the county's eagerness to accept from Neville and Dallas the 
six-acre parcel that is intended to be the centerpiece of the $43-million sewer 
system, more trouble is brewing. 
</P>
<P>
The property has become tangled in the nasty legal battle between Adamson and 
her former sisters-in-law. Adamson, who doesn't want the sewer plant built 
there, claims a one-third ownership of the six acres and insists that the two 
sisters have no right to give it away. 
</P>
<P>
She is said to be sympathetic to about 100 homeowners whose houses are uphill 
-- and, they say, downwind -- of the site. They say that if the plant is built 
under their noses, it could wreck the resale value of their million-dollar 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pawns caught in a war between major landowners, with the county wanting 
to sacrifice us," said Bob Briskin, a member of the Malibu Country Estates 
Homeowners Assn. The group has hired well-known public interest attorney 
Carlyle Hall Jr., and is threatening a lawsuit to try to block the plant. 
</P>
<P>
Theirs is a cause celebre among anti-sewer, pro-cityhood forces in Malibu who 
have long regarded the county's efforts to install sewers as a prelude to 
widespread development. For many slow-growth advocates, the Adamson ruckus is 
an unexpected bonus. 
</P>
<P>
The squabble over the plant site, however, is only a small part of the legal 
war between the heirs. 
</P>
<P>
In her lawsuit against Neville and Dallas, in which she is seeking a third of 
the family fortune that some observers say may now have appreciated to $100 
million or more, Adamson has asked that the partnership agreement her husband 
signed be nullified. She claims that Neville and Dallas exerted undue influence 
on her husband to sign, knowing that he was too ill to understand it. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement replaced one drawn up 18 years earlier that had provided that, 
upon the death of any of the siblings, his or her heirs would have the right to 
sell their one-third share of the Adamson Cos.' assets at full market value. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new arrangement, however, the sisters became sole general partners in 
the family firm when their brother died, and Sharon Adamson, as a limited 
partner, was left with little say over what she claims should have been her 
inheritance. Neville and Dallas, meanwhile, say the agreement gave them the 
right to buy out their brother's entire share of the family fortune for 
$200,000. 
</P>
<P>
In a countersuit against Adamson, the sisters have asked that the agreement be 
enforced and that Adamson accept the $200,000 and relinquish any further 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
Although none of the women would agree to be interviewed, friends and former 
business associates, as well as court documents, reveal a rift between Merritt 
Adamson's widow and his sisters that has become intensely personal. 
</P>
<P>
For example, one of the first things Neville and Dallas did after their 
brother's death was to dismiss his son, Grant, from the company job he had held 
for seven years. They also quickly moved to exclude Sharon Adamson from 
participating in any company decisions, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
"There's enough family infighting there to fill several episodes of 'Falcon 
Crest,' " said a longtime associate of the women, who spoke on condition that 
he not be identified. Close associates say they haven't spoken amicably to each 
other in years. 
</P>
<P>
In court documents, Adamson accuses Neville, 68, and Dallas, 73, of being inept 
managers who don't even know how to read an annual report. 
</P>
<P>
She says that they've failed to provide an estate plan, and that if either were 
to die, the company would have to sell much of its assets at distressed prices 
to pay inheritance taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Adamson contends that the sisters have frittered away many millions of dollars 
through poor business decisions and by relying on individuals with little or no 
expertise in managing the firm's diverse holdings. 
</P>
<P>
For example, she says they erred last year in not accepting $5.17 million from 
the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy for 575 acres above the Pepperdine 
campus that real estate appraisers had determined could not be developed. 
</P>
<P>
She faults them for taking out an unnecessary $3-million bank loan that she 
says was placed in a bank certificate of deposit earning less than the interest 
on the loan. 
</P>
<P>
Among the advisers, Adamson is especially critical of George Sheridan, who went 
to work for the company in 1984 earning $54,000 a year, and, after marrying 
Neville, ended up as a company executive earning $220,000. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's 2 1/2-year marriage ended in divorce in January, several months 
after a company lawyer came to Sheridan's office to tell him that his wife 
wanted out of the marriage and that she wanted him to clean out his desk. 
</P>
<P>
In court documents filed on their behalf, Neville and Dallas shrug off 
Adamson's accusations as those of someone bent on breaking up assets that have 
been in the family for nearly a century. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the family say privately that Neville, especially, never 
approved of her brother's choice of a bride. Adamson, a graduate of Stanford 
and the daughter of a naval architect, was married to Merritt Adamson in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the couple's successful 32-year marriage, friends say, the two sisters 
always viewed her as an outsider. 
</P>
<P>
It was their grandfather, Frederick Hastings Rindge, who founded the family 
empire in 1892 when he bought 13,300 acres of a former Spanish land grant known 
as the Rancho Malibu Topanga Sequit. 
</P>
<P>
His widow, May Knight Rindge, later expanded the domain to 17,000 acres, 
stretching west from Topanga Canyon along 25 miles of coastline, and as far as 
three miles into the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
May Rindge spent the early decades of this century protecting what was hers. 
She thwarted the Southern Pacific's plans to run a railroad by the ranch. And 
she battled for years against the Pacific Coast Highway that she knew would cut 
a swath through her property. 
</P>
<P>
Her only daughter, Rhoda Agatha Rindge Adamson, and Rhoda's husband, Merritt 
Huntley Adamson Sr., inherited the struggle, and in the 1930s almost got more 
than they bargained for. The Depression plunged the family beef ranch into 
bankruptcy, prompting trustees to sell large parcels of their land to pay 
creditors. Only the family dairy, Adohr Farms (Rhoda spelled backward), kept 
the family solvent. 
</P>
<P>
It was a diminished but still substantial empire in 1962 when it passed to the 
next generation and came under the control of Merritt Huntley Adamson Jr., 
whose development initiatives transformed Malibu from a mostly private domain 
to a mecca for the rich and famous. 
</P>
<P>
During his quarter-century as manager of the remaining Rindge-Adamson empire, 
he donated land for the core of a campus to Pepperdine University. He built a 
mobile home park, a recreational vehicle park and condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
He sold thousands of acres to the state and federal governments for parkland. 
He subdivided big chunks of oceanfront property, on which celebrities and 
others built the kind of lavish homes for which Malibu is now famous. 
</P>
<P>
And less than two months before his death in 1986, his company received 
long-sought permission from the California Coastal Commission to build Malibu's 
first large hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Friends say that toward the end of his life, Merritt Adamson was consumed with 
the hotel plan. Despite his illness, he traveled to San Francisco to appear 
before the coastal panel the day it was approved. Some say his devotion to the 
project accounts for his sisters' determination to pursue it despite community 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Their desire for the hotel also helps to explain why the Adamson Cos. has for 
years led the fight against Malibu cityhood. In granting its approval, the 
Coastal Commission stipulated that a Malibu sewer system would have to be 
installed before the hotel can open. 
</P>
<P>
But time appears to be running out on the hotel. The company has already 
obtained four one-year extensions of its coastal permit, and if ground is not 
broken before Malibu's incorporation, company lawyers fear they will have to 
start over with the application process. 
</P>
<P>
Only this time, instead of dealing with the county, which has been quick to 
encourage development in Malibu, the Adamson Cos. would face a potentially far 
more hostile city government. 
</P>
<P>
While opposing cityhood, the company has been a generous campaign contributor 
to Los Angeles County supervisors. Between 1981 and 1985, the firm was 
Supervisor Pete Schabarum's largest corporate contributor, with $23,750 in cash 
plus hunting trips and gifts. 
</P>
<P>
In the last four years, the Adamson Cos. has donated more than $40,000 to the 
supervisors, mostly to Schabarum and Supervisors Deane Dana and Mike 
Antonovich. They, along with Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, have consistently opposed 
cityhood for Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
In their private dealings with the county, Neville and Dallas offered to give 
away the land for the sewer plant and said they would try to get Sharon 
Adamson's cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to get Adamson to relinquish her purported interest in the property, the 
sisters decided to offer the land to the county anyway, and agreed not to 
object if the county found it necessary to acquire the property by 
condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
County officials, who acknowledge that they do not have a ready backup site if 
their efforts to acquire the parcel hit a snag, have been noncommittal about 
using condemnation proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the supervisors are expected to vote Tuesday to accept the property 
as a gift from the Adamson Cos., after having been assured by attorneys for the 
firm that Neville and Dallas have the authority to donate it. 
</P>
<P>
Adamson disagrees, contending that the parcel was among about $15 million in 
assets shared in common by her husband and his two sisters outside the firm and 
that the company has no authority to deal it away. 
</P>
<P>
Her attorney, Hillel Chodos, called the arrangement idiotic. 
</P>
<P>
"In short, (the sisters) want my client to give them her interest in the 
property so that they can give it away to the county without, according to 
them, receiving so much as a snicker," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Others suggest that the sisters may not have been entirely willing partners in 
the deal to give the county the land, noting that the county for a time had 
considered putting the sewer plant next to the hotel site. 
</P>
<P>
"With this deal, the county gets some free land, and the sisters get to build a 
hotel where the guests don't have to smell (excrement)," said a Malibu Country 
Estates resident, who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
County officials deny holding the threat of a sewer plant next to the hotel 
over the sisters' heads and insist that they are not swapping favors with the 
sisters in the current arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
A copy of the agreement Neville and Dallas submitted to the county indicates, 
however, that the offer involved more than altruism. 
</P>
<P>
It states that their giving the land is intended to help "ensure the county's 
cooperation in the timely processing of (the company's) grading and foundation 
permits" for the hotel, as well as approval of interim sewer treatment 
facilities in the event work on the hotel is completed before the county's 
sewer system is installed. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Stone, the county's deputy director of public works, said that such an 
arrangement was "not unusual," adding that the county "tries to cooperate with 
an individual developer like the Adamsons just as it would any homeowner." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the prospects for building the sewer plant if the dispute over the 
property isn't resolved soon, he replied, "Then it may be back to the drawing 
board."

FLOOD OF PUBLIC DOUBT GREETS PLAN TO CLEAN UP WATER

<P>
With color-coded charts, sophisticated maps, slide shows and exhibits 
resembling a school science project, federal and state environmental officials 
Tuesday unveiled their $106-million water pollution cleanup plan to a skeptical 
San Gabriel Valley audience. 
</P>
<P>
"San Gabriel is a top priority," said Tom Kremer, an official with the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency in San Francisco. He spoke to 60 people at the 
first of two workshops to explain the proposed cleanup of underground water 
pollution spread across much of the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the federal and state officials' lengthy presentations and 
assurances of concern, some in the audience weren't persuaded. "I feel like the 
carpetbaggers are here. They're just tickling the public fancy," said Geoff 
Nunn, president of the Whittier-based California Domestic Water Co. "Promises, 
promises, promises and nothing delivered." 
</P>
<P>
Don Mauri, a Hacienda Heights resident and South El Monte business owner, said, 
"This meeting is an exercise in futility." 
</P>
<P>
"We really want to know what you think," said David Cohen of the state Water 
Resources Control Board. He urged those in the audience who had strong feelings 
to make their comments in writing by the July 20 deadline, when state and 
federal officials will assess public reaction to the short-term cleanup plan 
announced last month. 
</P>
<P>
Kremer acknowledged that the problem with toxic pollution in the San Gabriel 
Valley, as well throughout America, "is bigger than people realized" a decade 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental officials consider the San Gabriel Valley situation to be one of 
the worst in the West. The 45 water suppliers in the region have managed to 
continue providing their 1 million customers with water that meets all state 
and federal quality standards. To do so, though, is increasingly expensive. 
</P>
<P>
"This problem took 40 to 50 years to get to this stage, and it's going to take 
a long time to solve it," said Neil Ziemba, the EPA's project manager for the 
San Gabriel Valley, which six years ago was placed on the federal Superfund 
list of the nation's 1,200 worst pollution problems. 
</P>
<P>
In response to one critical comment about how federal environmental officials 
have handled the water pollution problem, Ziemba replied: "We acknowledge 
there's a lot we do not know." 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, a retired couple from Azusa, Bob and Betty Wertz, studied a 
map showing plumes of underground water pollution. "I'm getting so I hesitate 
to take a drink of water," Bob Wertz said, tracing his finger on the map where 
his house is situated, not far from the pollution. "We're surprised so few 
citizens get involved. We think it's real serious, but most of our neighbors 
don't really seem to care." 
</P>
<P>
The last workshops on the plan will be June 28 at El Monte Community Center, 
3130 N. Tyler Ave. The afternoon session will run from 2:30 to 5 p.m. The 
presentation will be repeated that evening from 7 to 9:30. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the state Water Resources Control Board will hold a hearing in 
November to assess what progress is being made with the cleanup.

</P>
<P>
Citing drought conditions, the company's district superintendent, Kenneth 
Vader, said: "We're sending a clear message that we encourage both residents 
and businesses to do whatever possible to eliminate water waste. . . . Our 
water shortage is real." 
</P>
<P>
The kits include toilet tank bags that displace water and can save hundreds of 
gallons of water annually. The company is also giving away devices that 
restrict the flow of water in shower heads and dye tablets that help detect 
toilet leaks.

HISTORIC DESIGNATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Myrtle Avenue business area was declared a historic district by the City 
Council on Tuesday, and guidelines were established to preserve the 
architectural character of the city's century-old downtown buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to preserve in perpetuity the historical character of downtown," said 
Donald R. Hopper, director of community development. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the guidelines, which govern the look of renovated storefronts and 
new construction in the area, the council set up a Historic Review Committee 
made up of three city staff members, a representative of the Downtown Merchants 
Assn. and a representative of the city's historic preservation groups. 
</P>
<P>
The committee will review every building or demolition permit in the downtown 
area that affects the exterior architectural appearance of the building.

CHILD-CARE PROGRAM OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A city-employee child-care program and a $100,000 loan program to operate 
child-care centers in Northwest Pasadena were approved Tuesday by the Board of 
Directors. 
</P>
<P>
Under the $171,020 Model Employer Program, the city will provide a subsidy to 
low- and moderate-income city employees who need help paying for child care. 
</P>
<P>
The board approved providing $142,000 to such payments that are expected to 
average about $87 monthly for very low-income city workers. 
</P>
<P>
The program also provides six months of unpaid maternity leave for city workers 
who could return to a reduced work week of 20 hours. City employees would be 
allowed to take sick leave for family emergencies or to care for a sick child. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Northwest Child Care Trust Fund, three-year loans at 5% interest 
would be provided to family day-care homes and child-care centers in Northwest 
Pasadena, the city's largest minority neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The model employer program is an effort by the city to set an example and to 
encourage private businesses in Pasadena to set up child-care programs. Only 
Santa Monica and Irvine offer similar subsidies to city employees. 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena loan program will begin July 1, but the city's child-care program 
will initially serve only management and non-union employees. Labor unions 
representing about 1,200 of the city's 1,600 workers must agree to the 
child-care program before it goes into effect for unionized employees.

BRETHREN CHRISTIAN SCHOOL WILL MOVE TO CYPRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brethren Christian Junior and Senior High School, which has been located on 
South Orange Avenue at Alondra Boulevard in Paramountfor more than 36 years, is 
leaving the city. The school is moving to Orange Avenue in Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
The 480-student school is moving primarily for more space and to be closer to 
the students it serves, Supt. Dennis R. Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
The school plans to be in its new location by Sept. 5 for the beginning of 
school next fall, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Brethren will lease a 20-acre junior high school site closed in the early 1980s 
by the Anaheim Union High School District due to declining enrollment, Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Paramount campus is on 8 acres of land and serves many students from the 
Orange County area. The old school site will be sold, administrators said.

<P>
MAYOR, 3 COUNCILMEN SUED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of dissidents who say the city's Redevelopment Agency is wasting 
taxpayers' money served Mayor Stan Quintana and Councilmen Jim Kelly, Art Olmos 
and Albert Perez with a legal action during last week's City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
During the segment of the meeting in which residents are allowed to address the 
council, Christopher Sutton, lawyer for Citizen Advocates of South El Monte, 
walked to the podium and handed the papers to the four councilmen. 
</P>
<P>
"Gentlemen, consider yourselves served," Sutton said. Only newly elected 
Councilman Raul Pardo was excluded. 
</P>
<P>
The dissidents, who are South El Monte residents, business people and property 
owners, are challenging the designation of two redevelopment plans. Business 
Improvement District Projects 1 and 2, as the projects are called, cover 239 
acres in six widely scattered parts of the city. They were adopted by the City 
Council, whose members serve as the redevelopment agency's board, in 1988 and 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint calls the two plans irrational and invalid and holds that 
implementing them would squander city revenues. The city officials named in the 
suit declined comment on the advice of counsel. 
</P>
<P>
Trial in the suit is set for July 31 in Los Angeles Superior Court.

TREATMENT PLANT INSTALLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Workers on Tuesday began installing a $800,000 treatment plant to save a 
polluted Baldwin Park well. 
</P>
<P>
The well, on Maine Avenue near Irwindale, was polluted last year by 
carcinogenic compounds commonly used in industries and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Water officials say the pollution stemmed from one of the four large plumes of 
contamination that plague large portions of the underground water supply of the 
San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The need for the treatment plant is heightened because of the drought, said 
Stanley D. Yarbrough, general manager the Valley County Water District, which 
is building the facility. "Without this project, the district's existing well 
supply is not going to be enough to meet the high demands during the hot summer 
months," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The district serves 40,000 residential and business customers in Baldwin Park, 
Irwindale and West Covina. Of the district's 10 wells, seven have been shut 
down because of pollution. To finance the project, the water district in 
February imposed a 25% rate increase, most of which will go toward the costs of 
the treatment plant.

RESULTS OF FIRST FARMERS MARKET PLEASE MERCHANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whittier held its first farmers market, and the results were better than 
merchants had hoped, said Janet Crossman, office manager of the sponsoring 
Whittier Uptown Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a thousand people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was wonderful." Crossman said the 15 vendors sold $5,000 worth of 
merchandise. "They were so shocked they couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty vendors have signed up for the next market, which operates from 9:30 
a.m. to 1 p.m. Fridays on Bailey Street between Greenleaf and Comstock avenues. 
</P>
<P>
Because the market is certified by the state, Crossman said, the produce for 
sale must pass regular state inspection in order to minimize any danger of 
spreading agricultural pests, such as the mediterranean fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers hope the market will do more than inspire the purchase of locally 
produced eggs, strawberries, honey, nuts and flowers. The idea is to get 
shoppers downtown again, to boost a city-center economy that was already 
hurting before the October, 1987, earthquake decimated buildings and 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
For one day at least, "the cash registers were ringing like crazy all over 
town," Crossman said.

A POSSIBLE SOLUTION TO FREEWAY GAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a solution to the longstanding controversy over closing the gap in the 
Long Beach Freeway. It is an alternative to the Meridian Variation route 
preferred by Caltrans and the No Build preferred by South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The alternative is a combination of parts of several routes studied by Caltrans 
that are included in its soon-to-be-released Final Environmental Impact 
Statement. No further studies are needed. 
</P>
<P>
This alternative consists of connecting the existing Long Beach Freeway with 
the Pasadena Freeway near York Boulevard. The Pasadena Freeway would connect to 
the Foothill Freeway via the adopted Meridian route in Pasadena, leaving the 
existing freeway around Raymond Hill as a second freeway connection to 
Pasadena. This plan (developed in the mid-1980s) would: 
</P>
<P>
* Require half the number of homes and half the number of people to be 
displaced. The route would be located through more open space and less densely 
populated areas. 
</P>
<P>
* Avoid hauling millions of cubic yards of excess dirt on city streets and 
congested freeways to the Irwindale gravel pits, a disposal that may not be 
environmentally acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
* Permit excess dirt to be placed in open space valleys adjacent to the freeway 
in a manner to create building sites for replacement housing. 
</P>
<P>
* Provide the opportunity for relocating people in the same community. New, 
three-bedroom manufactured houses can be placed on these newly created building 
sites for less than $100,000 each. Many displaced people can then qualify for a 
new home without a subsidy from public funds. 
</P>
<P>
* Avoid most historic districts and historic places now on the National 
Register. 
</P>
<P>
* Remove the slide area at Monterey Road north of Avenue 60, as was done on the 
San Bernardino Freeway at Kellogg Hill where new homes have been built. 
</P>
<P>
* Permit construction of two-level structures rather than four-level structures 
over the Raymond Fault near Orange Grove Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
* Permit construction in the Arroyo Seco to be either double-decking or 
side-by-side roadways with park use of the space under the freeway, as was done 
in San Antonio, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
* Be one-half mile longer for Long Beach Freeway traffic, but one-half mile 
shorter for Pasadena Freeway traffic. 
</P>
<P>
* Cost much less than the Meridian Variation route. 
</P>
<P>
All that is needed to resolve the problem are a few days for Caltrans to 
rewrite the "summary and conclusion" sections of the FEIS and to recommend this 
compromise combination of routes in lieu of the Meridian Variation route 
through South Pasadena.

<P>
IN THOUSAND OAKS, A DRAMATIC ADAPTATION OF GEORGE ORWELL'S CLASSIC PROVES A 
DELIGHT TO THE EARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD EVERETT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This weekend, the Performing Arts Guild in Thousand Oaks concludes an 
eight-performance run of their reading of Nelson Bond's dramatic adaptation of 
George Orwell's "Animal Farm." Always worth rereading, the story is a delight 
to the ears as well. 
</P>
<P>
Set in a time described as "the past; the present; the future," "Animal Farm" 
has long been regarded as a classic piece of political allegory. Led by three 
pigs, the livestock on "Manor Farm" revolt against Farmer Jones, establishing a 
commune, renamed "Animal Farm," where the animals work for themselves, and not 
humankind. 
</P>
<P>
Before long, the societal order promised by the porkers -- "Four legs good; two 
legs bad" and "all animals are created equal" -- becomes a memory, as the pigs 
establish themselves as the new, and no less unsavory, upper class. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the fable, the members of the porcine upper crust are walking on 
their two hind legs, wearing Farmer Jones' old clothes and making covert deals 
with human businessmen, their former enemies. History is rewritten on the hoof 
at Animal Farm, and the rules are changed as the game is in motion. 
</P>
<P>
In its simplest reading, the 1945 book is the British author's commentary on 
the dangers of a totalitarian government: specifically, the Soviet Union under 
Stalin. But things aren't always so simple, and "Animal Farm" is as meaningful 
in these days of a liberated Eastern Europe as it was nearly a half-century 
ago. There are also obvious parallels in Western Europe and even in today's -- 
and yesterday's, and probably tomorrow's -- North, Central and South America. 
</P>
<P>
Under the direction of John-Michael Duggan, each of the seven players takes on 
a variety of clearly defined roles, with narration -- passed from actor to 
actor -- setting up situations and moving the action forward. Clad in formal 
black, the actors remain seated for most of the performance, though one or 
another will stand up or step to the front from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
Accents range from the pure English of Margaret Nesbitt, who plays the pig 
Napoleon and his (also male) predecessor, to varyingly successful attempts at 
stage English to straightforward American. The actors' reading skills vary too, 
with some having difficulty with the lines at last Friday night's performance, 
three nights into the run. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Nesbitt, the cast consists of Bill Schneider, the effective 
chief narrator; David Mathews, who plays the idealist, Trotsky-figure pig 
Snowball; Irv Citron, properly sniveling as Squealer; Ken Johnson as the draft 
horse Boxer; Barbara Arnello as the vain mare Molly, and Barbara Bellinger as a 
number of relatively less-significant animals. Lights and sometimes-intrusive 
but often-effective musical cues are handled by Barbara James. 
</P>
<P>
At last Friday's show, the audience outnumbered the actors by less than two to 
one. "Animal Farm" deserves better -- one reason that Napoleon and his pigs 
were able to get the upper hand was the other animals' brief memory for 
history. 
</P>
<P>
* The Details: "Animal Farm" can be seen tomorrow and Saturday at 8 p.m. and 
Sunday at 7 p.m at the Arts Council Center, 482 Greenmeadow Drive in Thousand 
Oaks. Tickets are $7, $6 for seniors and students. For reservations, which are 
suggested, or further information, call (805) 499-4355.

ABC SCHOOL DISTRICT YIELDS ON ADMINISTRATOR; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: THE BOARD BOWS TO UNION PRESSURE AND SHELVES A PLAN TO ADD A 
RESEARCH AND EVALUATION DIRECTOR WHILE ELIMINATING 18 POSITIONS.

<P>
The ABC school board Tuesday approved the layoff of four maintenance and 
clerical workers as part of its plan to cut $1.3 million from next year's 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
But the board bowed to union pressure and temporarily shelved a plan to add a 
new administrator for research and evaluation while eliminating 18 other 
positions. All of those cuts will be handled by not filling vacancies and 
reassigning employees, trustees decided. 
</P>
<P>
An accounting clerk, warehouseman, switchboard operator and glazier are the 
only employees who will lose their jobs at the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
ABC Unified School District Board President Jim Weisenberg and members Robert 
Hughlett, Dixie Primosch and Catherine Grant voted for the layoffs, while Cecy 
Groom, Sally Morales Havice and Dean Criss dissented. 
</P>
<P>
"We did listen to you on the assessment research director," Primosch said. "We 
are deferring that." 
</P>
<P>
But union leaders said they are not satisfied and plan to pressure Supt. Larry 
L. Lucas, who recommended the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"We're mad as hell," said Steve Highland, president of the American Federation 
of State, County and Municipal Employees. "We intend to get a vote of 
no-confidence on the superintendent." 
</P>
<P>
By a no-confidence vote, Highland said, members of his union "hope to show the 
superintendent how awful morale is. We hope it will change his mind." 
</P>
<P>
Highland said the union represents about 275 district blue-collar workers. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Sharp, field representative for the California School Employees Assn., 
said his union will join in the voting. The union represents 600 clerical, 
secretarial and technical workers. 
</P>
<P>
John Ennes, president of the teachers union, said he is "disappointed for our 
classified colleagues but pleased that the decision was made not to get a 
research director. The administration hadn't convinced the teachers there was a 
need for the position." 
</P>
<P>
Ennes said his union will not participate in the vote of confidence on the 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal to create a director of research, assessment and evaluation at a 
cost of $78,000, including salary and benefits, outraged the unions. Another 
$27,000 had been budgeted for the director's secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas had said earlier that a director was needed to make "an overall 
assessment of student performance." 
</P>
<P>
However, Lucas read a statement before the board voted Tuesday, asking the 
board to delay hiring a director. 
</P>
<P>
He said a director is needed but suggested that the board postpone creating the 
position because of the criticism. He recommended that staff members and 
parents study whether a director can be hired for less money. 
</P>
<P>
The district's proposal originally called for the layoff of six workers. 
However, other jobs were found for two of the employees. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas said the district will help the other four find jobs within the district 
or with private businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The district is short $1.1 million in its $83-million budget for 1990-91. It 
has projected that $2.5 million in reductions must be found to balance the 
1991-92 budget.

* THE MUDHEADS, WHO GOT TOGETHER 1 1/2 YEARS AGO, LIKE TO PLAY ACOUSTIC SONGS 
IN A BAND FORMAT.

The Firesign Theatre was probably the funniest comedy group of all time. In the 
early '70s, its album "Don't Crush That Dwarf, Pass Me the Pliers" featured a 
pair of characters called Porgy and Mudhead. Naturally, Ventura's Mudheads 
didn't get their name from the Firesign Theatre. The band members are too young 
to remember the Firesign Theatre. So much for that story. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was going to Ventura College, I took this American Indian history class 
from Joyce Evans," drummer Bill Boland said in a recent interview. "And we 
learned about these guys called Mudheads -- they were really cool. They were 
sort of priest clowns or priest comedians from the Hopi and Zuni tribes." 
</P>
<P>
"Check it out," said singer/guitarist Bill Coffey. "We've got a drummer that 
can read." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, all of them can read. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill, myself and Dave Ragsdale all met at San Bonaventure High School. I 
didn't even pick up a guitar until I was a senior," Coffey recalled. Then they 
met Luke McAuliffe; "we've only been together as a band for about a year and a 
half. Boland is a communications major and Ragsdale is an English major -- both 
go to UCSB. I do too, but I'm not going this quarter." 
</P>
<P>
Since Santa Barbara's Toad the Wet Sprocket was recently signed by Columbia 
Records, the local buzz is that the Mudheads may be next. They put on a very 
impressive live show -- people dance and everything. During a recent three-band 
bill at Charlie's in Ventura, the whole place erupted into a chant of 
"Mudheads! Mudheads! Mudheads!" and brought the band back for an encore. Pretty 
unusual for a bar. 
</P>
<P>
Coffey has this classic rock 'n' roll voice, clear and strong, and harmonizes 
perfectly with guitarist McAuliffe, while Ragsdale, resplendent in his Dodger 
hat, shreds on bass and Boland beats the hell out of the drums. 
</P>
<P>
"We sort of play acoustic songs in a band format," said Coffey, the chief 
songwriter. "I'd like to do this so we wouldn't have to work anymore. I just 
want to write good songs -- good songs, that's the main thing." 
</P>
<P>
And there's a bunch of good songs on the band's recent tape, "P.U. Ideas." "One 
Voice," "Empty Bottles" and the title tune, "Picking Up Ideas" have more hooks 
than the pier in August and will live in your head for days on end. 
</P>
<P>
"The tape made money; we sold about 400 copies so far, so we'll definitely do 
it again," Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the troubadour type, Coffey often performs an acoustic set with his 
pal Matt Shulte, lately the brain behind the Crashing Plains. Anyway, they 
compare favorably to the Everly Brothers. Really. Using an organic sound system 
(as in acoustic and no electricity), the duo recently played the Clock Tower in 
Ventura during Friday Happy Hour, serving as a backdrop for business types 
crying over big real estate deals that got away. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, we were playing away when the bartender came by and told us, 'Hey, can 
you guys keep it down?' We decided that was enough for that place," Coffey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Mudheads cite influences such as Eric Clapton, Bob Marley, X, Creedence 
Clearwater Revival, the Flying Burrito Brothers and King Sunny Ade. 
</P>
<P>
The Mudheads will be at Charlie's this evening along with that singing 
landscaper, Spencer the Gardener.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE

'Family Leave' Bill 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 237 to 187, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 770) requiring 
private employers of at least 50 workers, state and local governments and 
members of Congress to institute "family leave" as a job benefit. These 
employers would have to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave each year to 
enable parents to care for a new baby or ailing parent, spouse or child. 
Seriously ill employees could use the time for personal medical leave. 
Leave-takers would retain any medical insurance provided for them and be 
assured of returning to the job they left or its equivalent. 
</P>
<P>
Federal employees would get broader benefits, receiving up to 18 weeks of 
family leave over two years and 26 weeks of unpaid medical leave annually. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Sherwood Boehlert (R-N.Y.) said, "We talk about family values in this 
town a lot," and it is time to act. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Robert S. Walker (R-Pa.) said it was "not a family bill," but rather 
"another big government welfare-oriented kind of bill." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to pass the bill.

Leave Bill Provisions 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 155 to 264, the House rejected a motion to replace key provisions 
of the family leave bill (above) with a two-year study of the issue and a pilot 
program conducted among House employees. Sponsor Fred Grandy (R-Iowa) said his 
motion would make those in Congress "the guinea pig for a change." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Marge Roukema (R-N.J.) said the motion "simply guts the bill." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to study the need for a family leave law.

Amtrak Funding 
</P>
<P>
The House approved, 322 to 93, the conference report on a bill (HR 2364) 
providing Amtrak with an average annual subsidy of $670 million between fiscal 
years 1989 and 1992. The Senate later sent the bill to the White House. 
Taxpayers last year covered nearly 30% of the cost of operating Amtrak's rail 
passenger service to almost 500 communities. President Bush urges no federal 
funding of Amtrak and threatens to veto the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"This country would lose its national rail passenger service" without a federal 
subsidy, said supporter Thomas A. Luken (D-Ohio). 
</P>
<P>
Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) said, "The only cure for deficit spending is to cut 
that spending." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to authorize the federal subsidy of Amtrak.

CITY ATTORNEY RESIGNS POST IN SOUTH GATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SOUTH GATE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Atty. Bruce Boogaard has resigned effective May 25 to become chief 
attorney for the city of Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Boogaard has been South Gate's city attorney for eight years but had come under 
criticism recently. 
</P>
<P>
During the campaign leading up to the April 10 election, some candidates 
suggested that administrators, including Boogaard, would be fired if the 
balance of power changed on the five-member City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Three newcomers were elected. The new council quickly scrapped a plan -- 
approved on the eve of the election -- to give top appointive officials, 
including the administrator and city attorney, more job protection and an 
improved severance package. 
</P>
<P>
The council also hired a special legal counsel for some matters. Mayor Robert 
A. Philipp said the council wanted to avoid creating a possible conflict of 
interest for Boogaard. Philipp, a critic of Boogaard, said the city attorney 
"had resigned. He was not fired." Philipp said he would not discuss 
difficulties he had with Boogaard. 
</P>
<P>
Boogaard said he enjoyed working in South Gate and "was looking forward to a 
new challenge." 
</P>
<P>
Philipp said the council may name a new attorney at its next meeting May 29.

* SHADES OF THE AGNEW WATCH: DAN QUAYLE AND HIS BOSS HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO 
COLLECTIBLE HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DAVID LUSTIG 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Wristwatches were rather dull before Stephen Hill and Rick Ongstad came along. 
</P>
<P>
True, there was a choice of sweep hand or digital, square or round, plain or 
Mickey, but none resembled anything like what these two former stockbrokers 
from Simi Valley have recently been marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Take their Dan Quayle watch. Please. There's Dan, hands in pants pockets, 
smiling his vice presidential smile, the two parts of his tie acting as the big 
and little hand. But the numbers are not in the traditional spots. They're not 
even in any particular order. "Kind of reminds you of him, doesn't it?" Ongstad 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
While studying the Quayle timepiece, he pulls out two more designs; a George 
Bush watch that just happens to run backwards, and the just-released "Gorby the 
Ukrainian Cowboy" model that resembles a compass, complete with a small north 
at the top, south at the bottom and east on the right. In the middle is a 
smiling Gorbachev, surrounded by a sickle and a hammer turned into a pogo 
stick. To the left is a very big west. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting side by side, munching on beef teriyaki at a Japanese restaurant, Hill 
and Ongstad, the co-owners of the Krazy Time Co. seem to have come from two 
different cultures. No, make that two different planets. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, 28, is a mild-mannered, three-piece suit corporate-looking type with a 
strong "Hi, how are ya?" handshake. His sport-shirted, disheveled, blond 
40-year-old partner, on the other hand, looks like a fugitive from an Annette 
Funicello beach party movie. 
</P>
<P>
"Steve stays at home with his family, mows the lawn and watches television and 
drinks beer," Ongstad said. "I smoke, drink and chase women." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't drink beer," said Hill, "I sit out on the porch." 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever," said Ongstad, taking one last puff on his cigarette after Hill 
urged him to put it out. 
</P>
<P>
Hill and Ongstad may have different ways to conduct their personal lives, but 
professionally, they are of single purpose: to propel Krazy Time from the 
original wild idea they kicked around in the brokerage office last year to 
full-fledged, in-the-black reality. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't stand the business anymore," Ongstad said of brokering. "It was 
boring and mundane and I was unfulfilled." While talking with Hill in the 
office one day, he noticed some guy named Dan Quayle was running for vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
"We were reading about him in the newspapers and then the quotes started 
rolling out. He's better than Spiro Agnew ever was." 
</P>
<P>
Emptying their bank accounts and encouraging friends to invest, the pair 
amassed $87,000 and went to a restaurant in Simi Valley. "Well, why not," 
Ongstad said, "we had to do our marketing consulting somewhere, didn't we? 
</P>
<P>
"We'd go in and get people's opinions; the customers, barmaids, bartenders, all 
the people we knew there." 
</P>
<P>
After receiving everyone's input and relying on their own gut feelings, Hill 
and Ongstad had a professional artist do a rendering and placed an order for 
5,000 Dan Quayles with a Hong Kong manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
"We put the numbers on the Dan Quayle watch in the wrong places," Hill said, 
"because the guy is so confused it seems like every time he starts talking all 
the wrong stuff comes out." 
</P>
<P>
The watches showed up, but orders for them didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Ongstad got worried, so he had a "Get Your Dan Quayle Watch for Father's Day" 
banner printed and took his Jeep and 50 watches to Malibu Canyon and sat by the 
side of road waiting for the throngs of customers he knew would be there. He 
came home with 50 watches. 
</P>
<P>
"We were sitting and yelling at each other," said Hill. "We had this whole 
office filled with thousands of watches and I had sold two that day. Not 2,000, 
two watches. So we start scraping for customers. The first scary thing was our 
telephone bill, it was $3,600 a month. We were on the phone day and night, 
calling every newspaper in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Then two things happened. Associated Press picked up the story and at the same 
time, Hill and Ongstad persuaded a small number of retail outlets to carry a 
few watches "just to see if they sell." 
</P>
<P>
What resulted, they said, was a pattern that has repeated itself ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"A store buyer would reluctantly try 12," said Hill, "then a few days later 
order 36, then a few days after that, a ton of them." Currently, shipping about 
500 watches a month, the pair have sold more than 27,000 Quayle watches and 
2,500 of the recently introduced George Bush model. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush watch, Hill said, was supposed to be in stores by January but trying 
to find a good watch movement that ran backward was a problem (Hill says the 
only other backward watch ever on the market was one featuring Goofy). So Krazy 
Time had one specially made. 
</P>
<P>
The month of May was the unveiling of the Gorby the Ukrainian Cowboy watch, 
featuring a chain and extra large stem, "because everything Russian seems big, 
clumsy and heavy," Ongstad said. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted a Russian watch with missiles and explosions," he said, "but the 
politics kept changing. We noticed he was 'Westernizing' things so our watch 
has him pointing that way. And we heard he liked Clint Eastwood movies, so we 
gave him a cowboy hat." All three models, Quayle, Bush and Gorbachev, retail 
for $34.95. 
</P>
<P>
While Krazy Time is planning to market future caricature watches -- Hill and 
Ongstad are mum on who will be next -- they said they are trying to be careful 
to make each design original, clever, and not offensive. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone suggested a Pete Rose watch with playing cards instead of numbers," 
Ongstad said, "but stuff like this has to be very funny and cute. You have to 
have a gut feeling that it is going to sell when you put it together." 
</P>
<P>
And now that Hill and Ongstad are entrepreneurs, watches are not the only items 
in their future. In the works is a George Bush bush -- actually a potted plant 
called a Texas privet. Purchasers' names will be kept on a list, Hill said, and 
after five years, Krazy Time will contact everyone and announce a 
hedge-trimming contest. "The person who comes closest to George will win the 
Grand Prize."

MILLIKAN ENTERS 5-A PLAYOFFS SEEDED NO. 2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Millikan High School, which opens the Southern Section baseball playoffs Friday 
afternoon as the second-seeded team in Division 5-A, hits so well that Coach 
Dan Peters is reminded of his 1983 CIF championship team. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very comparable to that club," Peters said. The Rams (22-4), who play 
Alemany (13-13) at 3:15 at Blair Field in Long Beach, are batting .364 and 
feature four .400 hitters. 
</P>
<P>
Senior center fielder Aaron Seja leads the team with a .463 average, followed 
by senior first baseman Omar Diaz (.434 with five home runs), junior designated 
hitter Larry Satterlee (.432) and junior second baseman Dante Powell (.411). 
</P>
<P>
Peters, who is in his ninth season at Millikan, won the Moore League title for 
the third time when the Rams edged out Lakewood, their biggest rival. He has a 
189-60 record and has reached the CIF finals three times. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are consistently successful, he said, because most of the players come 
out of the strong Long Beach Pony League program. The situation is similar at 
Lakewood High, where players come from the Lakewood Pony League. 
</P>
<P>
"These players have battled each other for years," Peters said. The Rams won 
two of three games from Lakewood this season. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen teams from the Southeast/Long Beach area are in the playoffs. Here is 
a look at the rest of Friday's games, which start at 3:15 unless otherwise 
indicated. 
</P>

p.m. at Blair Field. 
</P>
<P>
Angelus League runner-up St. Paul (17-9) will be at Rolling Hills (11-9).

WATER CLEANUP PLAN UNVEILED FOR SAN GABRIEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With color-coded charts, sophisticated maps, slide shows and exhibits 
resembling a school science project, federal and state environmental officials 
Tuesday unveiled their $106-million water pollution cleanup plan to a skeptical 
San Gabriel Valley audience. 
</P>
<P>
"San Gabriel is a top priority," said Tom Kremer, an official with the 
Environmental Protection Agency in San Francisco. He spoke to 60 people at the 
first of two workshops in El Monte to explain the proposed cleanup of 
underground water pollution that has spread across much of the San Gabriel 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the federal and state officials' lengthy presentations and 
assurances of concern, some in the audience were not persuaded. "I feel like 
the carpetbaggers are here," said Geoff Nunn, president of the Whittier-based 
California Domestic Water Co. "They're just tickling the public fancy. 
Promises, promises, promises and nothing delivered." 
</P>
<P>
"This meeting is an exercise in futility," said Don Mauri, a Hacienda Heights 
resident and South El Monte business owner. 
</P>
<P>
"We really want to know what you think," said David Cohen of the state Water 
Resources Control Board. He urged those in the audience who had strong feelings 
to make their comments in writing by the July 20 deadline, when state and 
federal officials will assess public reaction to the short-term cleanup 
announced last month. 
</P>
<P>
Kremer acknowledged that the problem with toxic pollution in the San Gabriel 
Valley, as well throughout America, "is bigger than people realized" a decade 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
EPA officials consider the San Gabriel Valley situation to be one of the worst 
in the West. So far, the 45 valley water suppliers have continued providing 
their 1 million customers with water that meets all state and federal quality 
standards. To do so, though, becomes increasingly expensive. 
</P>
<P>
"This problem took 40 to 50 years to get to this stage, and it's going to take 
a long time to solve it," said Neil Ziemba, the EPA's project manager for the 
San Gabriel Valley, which six years ago was placed on the federal Superfund 
list of the nation's 1,200 worst pollution problems.

ALBACORE ON THE MOVE, TUNA ACTION LOOKS GOOD

<P>
This could be the start of a record-breaking sportfishing year. Migrating 
albacore were discovered 100 miles from Point Loma last week, possibly 
indicating the start of an early summer run. 
</P>
<P>
Anglers are waiting to see if this school of fish could be the one that 
wintered at Guadalupe Island and has started its migration northward early. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Harbor Sportfishing's Shogun was on a five-day trip to San Benitos in 
Mexico fishing yellowtail when Capt. Norm Kagaw received word of the albacore. 
Anglers set the jigs out and Kagaw said 50 fish were caught with the average 
weight of six to 15 pounds. Kagaw said conditions look perfect for a good 
summer of tuna fishing. 
</P>
<P>
The Shogun returned Friday with 359 yellowtail and 103 albacore. Jackpot 
winners were Rancho Palos Verdes fishermen Jim Hammand with his 21 3/4-pound 
yellowtail and Dean Zuchi of Torrance, who caught a 20 1/4-pound fish. 
</P>
<P>
The King Harbor Marlin Club's annual marlin tag-and-release trip to Rancho 
Buena Vista in Baja was a huge success. 
</P>
<P>
Over 65 marlin were tagged and released during the three days of fishing. Club 
member Clyde Rainwater said that after the tagging was completed, the group 
fished for rooster fish, yellow-fin tuna, and cabrilla. The trip's jackpot was 
awarded to Wolfgang Nachsel with a 196-pound marlin. 
</P>
<P>
The Cabrillo Marine Museum will hold its annual Catalina marine observation 
trip Saturday aboard the Shogun. Staff divers will bring up marine life for 
deck observations and study. The highlight of the trip again will be shark 
baiting in an attempt to lure them for close-up observation. 
</P>
<P>
Departure time at L.A. Harbor Sportfishing is set for 6 a.m. The group will 
return at 6 p.m. Information: Larry Fukuhara at (213) 548-7563. 
</P>
<P>
Seymor Burtin of Long Beach, fishing off Catalina aboard the Toronado, caught 
the big fish of the week, a 52-pound white sea bass. Tony Shaw of Gardena, 
fishing aboard the Blackjack off Catalina, won the jackpot with a 45-pound 
white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Hartman of West Los Angeles, fishing off Catalina aboard the First 
String, caught a 32-pound white sea bass. Greg Solmon of Malibu, fishing off 
Catalina aboard the Outerlimits, caught a 29-pound white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Brown of San Pedro, fishing off Catalina aboard the Betty G, caught a 
24-pound halibut. Eugene Archiball of Westwood, fishing off Catalina aboard the 
Victory, caught a 16 1/4-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Fish Reports: Big bonito have started to bite again from Rocky Point to Santa 
Monica Bay. Halibut fishing remains slow, with legals being caught in the 
mornings. 
</P>
<P>
At Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Spitfire worked the bay for a catch of 60 
sculpin, 45 sand bass and three halibut. 
</P>
<P>

and 15 sand bass. The Betty O rock cod special fished the shallow rock piles 
and caught 171 rock cod and three cow cod. 
</P>
<P>
At Redondo Sportfishing: The Sea Spray fished rocky point and had a catch of 53 
bonito, 47 sand bass, 31 sculpin, 12 barracuda and nine rockfish. 
</P>

<P>
Ventura is going to be invaded this Friday, Saturday and Sunday. By Pontiacs. 
</P>
<P>
Coming in all shapes and sizes -- some 1950s models seem only slightly shorter 
than a Navy cruiser -- the event might be mistaken for a scene out of "American 
Graffiti," especially Friday evening when everyone is scheduled to assemble 
their steel Indians at Hudson's Grill on Telephone Road to recreate "cruise 
night." 
</P>
<P>
It's not a scene from a movie, but part of the 7th Annual Western Region 
Convention of the Pontiac/Oakland Car Club being held this year at Harbortown 
Marina Resort in Ventura. Club members said events such as cruise night will be 
a great time for nostalgia, complete with hamburgers, tire-kicking and plenty 
of people "talking Pontiac." 
</P>
<P>
But if you're not a member and don't own the right car, don't despair. During 
the convention's swap meet and car display, which will feature a range of cars, 
from a 1933 convertible coupe to a 1990 TransAm, the public is invited -- for 
free. 
</P>
<P>
"The theme of the club is the preservation of the car," said member Dick Hoyt, 
50 of Canoga Park. "This isn't a hot rod club. Most of the guys are trying to 
put them back to their original specs." 
</P>
<P>
The "them" Hoyt refers to are not only Pontiacs, but its sister car, the 
discontinued Oakland, both of which can trace their bloodlines to the 1890s and 
the Pontiac Buggy Co. of Pontiac, Mich. Later known as the Oakland Motor Car 
Co., by 1909 it had become part of General Motors. In 1926, the Pontiac 
re-emerged as a separate car with such success that its Oakland parent was 
dropped from the GM line six years later. 
</P>
<P>
The car club has a much shorter genealogy. Begun in 1972 by a couple of 
Escondido, Calif., Pontiac owners who felt a club might be an easier way to 
scrounge for hard-to-find parts, the national organization has about 9,500 
members and the Southern California chapter slightly more than 250. 
</P>
<P>
Quoting statistics on how many hard-core Pontiac club members there are is one 
thing, but finding out why people choose this particular make over, say, a 
Plymouth, is a little harder to explain. For many members, it turns out a 
Pontiac was their first car. Or their dad's. 
</P>
<P>
"My father worked for Pontiac when I was in high school," said Dan Santoro, 43 
of Placentia. "I bought a 1959 Bonneville right after graduation, but sold it 
when I went into the Air Force." 
</P>
<P>
Years later, lamenting that it was probably the best car he had ever owned, his 
future wife suggested he get another one. Today, he owns two restored 1959 
Pontiac Bonnevilles and a 1964 Pontiac Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Plastino, 50, of Corona del Mar, learned to drive in one. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a 1940 Pontiac when I was a teen-ager and grew up on Hot Rod magazine," 
he said, "so when I decided to hobby, it was only natural my wife, Jan, and I 
joined a car club." 
</P>
<P>
The Plastinos own three Pontiacs, including a 1957 Safari station wagon and a 
1964 Catalina, but it is their 1933 coupe that they are the most proud of. 
"It's got panache," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Don Finn, 57, of La Habra feels the same way about his 1959 Bonneville two-door 
sport coupe. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always liked the older cars," he said, explaining that the Bonneville 
trunk was so large that after removing the spare tire, he and his wife used to 
sleep in it when the couple went camping. Twenty-nine years later, his wife, 
Barbara, now 53, laughed and said: "I didn't know if I fell in love with him or 
that car. All that chrome!" 
</P>
<P>
But Finn sold the car shortly afterward, and said he regretted it ever since. 
Five years ago, after an extensive search, he purchased another. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a far cry from when I first saw it," he said. "It followed me home, smoke 
coming out of it and dented. It barely ran." Now equipped with a new engine, 
the rust removed, the upholstery redone, a glistening paint job smoothing over 
three decades of wear, it is, in the eyes of its owner, a thing of beauty. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the Pontiac owners, like Hoyt, who are only interested in one 
particular year. 
</P>
<P>
Hoyt owns three 1957 limited-production fuel-injected Bonneville convertibles, 
one of them being the only black one ever made. Of the original 630 cars 
produced, he estimated 50 are left today. Since he began collecting 30 years 
ago, Hoyt has had four Bonneville convertibles, a standard Star Chief 
convertible and a Safari wagon -- all 1957s. 
</P>
<P>
Hard-pressed to explain why he prefers that year, Hoyt said that to him, " '57 
Pontiacs just have a lot of elegance and beauty." 
</P>
<P>
The city of Ventura was chosen for this year's convention because, "it's a 
beautiful location," said club members, "and it's not overly hot this time of 
year." The latter is an important point, they said, because some of the older 
cars as well as a few of the 1960s "muscle cars," like the GTO model, tend to 
overheat. Past host cities have included Prescott, Ariz.; Santa Clara, Calif.; 
and Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The three-day event is scheduled to be divided into a number of segments 
including Cruise Night, which Hoyt said is actually "park night" at Hudson's 
Grill; the swap meet, where members can sell their oversupply of bumpers, shock 
absorbers and widgets to those who just happen to be searching for that exact 
part; and the Car Corral, where members can bring Pontiacs that they are trying 
to sell. 
</P>
<P>
While the swap meet is open to the public, the biggest draw, said club 
officials, is the Saturday Car Show from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., where more than 150 
vehicles will be on display competing in one of 32 different classes, including 
Best Convertible, Best Station Wagon, Best 1930s Car, Best 1940s Car and the 
highest award, Best of Show. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the heavy male-orientation of the hobby, club members insist their 
wives, often silent partners in helping find parts as well as being chief 
psychologists in soothing a furrowed brow when "the blasted part just won't 
fit," have not been forgotten. At 9 a.m. on Saturday, they have their own 
"Ladies Brunch." 
</P>
<P>
"I love the social aspect of the club," said Barbara Finn. "We all have the 
same interests and while I don't know as much about cars as Don does, it's a 
fun group. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a Pontiac widow, but I don't mind," she said gamely. "At least I don't 
have to put up with football games." 
</P>
<P>
* THE DETAILS : To join in the fun, or just watch the cars go by, here are the 
convention events that are open to the public: 
</P>
<P>
* On Friday night, everyone participating in the 'Cruise to Hudson's' will meet 
in front of the Harbortown Marina Resort about 7:30 p.m. and at 8 p.m. will 
head to Hudson's Grill on Telephone Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
* The swap meet and "Car Corral," where members will be selling their Pontiacs, 
begin at 7:30 a.m. on Saturday across the street from the hotel and is expected 
to last until about 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
* At 9 a.m. Saturday there will be a new car show of 1990 Pontiacs. 
</P>
<P>
* Beginning at 11 a.m. on Saturday will be the main event for the public, the 
car show with about 150 cars on display, ranging from 1933 to the present. 
</P>
<P>
* At 2 p.m. will be the technical seminar inside the hotel at the Harbor View 
Room.

If you've ever wandered through a museum and wondered what goes on behind the 
scenes, you may want to drop by the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History May 
20 for International Museum Day. 
</P>
<P>
Not only will the docents be out in force to explain the exhibits, but some of 
the scientists will talk about what it is exactly that they do. 
</P>
<P>
"The naturalists from the vertebrate department will demonstrate how they 
prepare skins to study," said spokeswoman Lois Klein. "Animal skins are used 
for scientific study. They help to tell what a population of a particular 
species looks like." 
</P>
<P>
The invertebrate zoology department also will be represented. Scientists will 
show fossils and various other artifacts related to the museum's ongoing giant 
squid exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a giant squid hanging from the ceiling in the Marine Hall," said 
Klein. "It's a model of the largest ever found. The kids love it. Anything 
giant is great." 
</P>
<P>
Though they may not be giants, the docents are loved by the kids, too. 
</P>
<P>
Who wouldn't love someone who would answer such questions as "Why are bird's 
feet different?" "How come the bear's fur is so rough and the otter's fur so 
soft?" and "Do stuffed animals make any noises?" 
</P>
<P>
The education department and the anthropology department will be open and there 
will be extra planetarium shows, hourly from 1 to 4 p.m. Activities take place 
from noon to 4 p.m. Admission is free. The museum is at 2559 Puesta del Sol 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
What's for lunch today at Monroe and Washington schools in Santa Barbara? 
Estuary soup and kelp cookies. 
</P>
<P>
At least for the fifth- and sixth-grade students involved in the Los Marineros 
Sea Fair from 1 to 2 p.m. The students participated in a marine science program 
and this is their opportunity to show the public what they learned. 
</P>
<P>
"The students took a workshop at McGrath State Beach," said coordinator Sheila 
Cushman of the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary. "One of the stations 
had a chef who talked about all the elements that made up the murky water. We 
will have soup, but no one will have to eat it." 
</P>
<P>
There also will be a walk-in kelp forest (strands of kelp hanging from the 
ceiling) complete with starfish and sea urchins. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe School is located at 431 Flora Vista Drive. The fair will be in the 
library. Washington School is located at 290 Lighthouse Road. Go to Room 118. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 Festival of Animation -- a collection of 17 short films from the 
United States, England, the Soviet Union, Canada and Holland -- will open a 
two-week run at the Victoria Street Theater tomorrow night. 
</P>
<P>
Featured are such films as "Knickknack," the story of a miniature snowman 
trying to escape from his paperweight snowball, so he can be with other 
knickknacks on a shelf; "Locomotion," a modern, computer graphics version of 
"The Little Engine that Could;" and British Academy Award winner "The Hill 
Farm," complete with its stick-figure animals and country folk. 
</P>
<P>
Show times are 7 and 9:30 p.m., Monday to Saturday; 4:30, 7 and 9:30 p.m. 
Sunday. There will be an extra midnight show on May 19. All 17 films will be 
presented at each show. Tickets are $6 at the door. The festival will run 
through May 31. The theater is located at 33 W. Victoria St. For more 
information, call 965-1886.

MATING GAME IS FIXED FOR STERILE MEDFLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It was what thousands of malathion-weary residents have been awaiting for 
months: the arrival of millions of sterile Medflies as a welcome substitute for 
aerial pesticide spraying. But as Lourdes Sanchez found out Wednesday, somebody 
apparently forgot to tell a couple of overly eager insects about the plan. 
</P>
<P>
As the gloved Sanchez tapped at the bottom of a fly-filled bucket, most of the 
4,500 pink-dyed pests inside flew furiously down Whittier Boulevard in the 
quest for fertile Medflies to breed into oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
But there on the side of the pickup truck sat a couple of troublesome and 
entangled flies that had begun the mating game a bit early. 
</P>
<P>
"They've jumped the gun," said the 27-year-old Sanchez -- "Mama Medfly" to her 
3-year-old son -- as she tried to flick the pair away. "I guess that's what 
happens when you've been in captivity." 
</P>
<P>
Such are the pitfalls for the several dozen work crews who began spreading the 
sterile Medflies around the northern tip of Orange County late last week and 
will continue to do so through summer there and in about 234 square miles of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The releases mark the state's latest attack on the Mediterranean fruit fly, a 
strategic shift that is, by most accounts, a welcome reprieve from months of 
unpopular malathion sprayings. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the more than 400 square miles of Southern California's spray 
areas are now being switched from spraying to the release of steriles, and 
state officials -- while overly confident in past projections -- predict that 
virtually all areas will be switched by next month. 
</P>
<P>
No sterile flies will be released in Orange County's largest spray zone, a 
36-square-mile area centered in Garden Grove. Instead, it is scheduled to get 
two more aerial malathion applications after Wednesday's application. 
Agriculture officials hope they can finish the Garden Grove area's treatment by 
May 30 and thus avoid using the hard-to-come-by sterile flies, which are bred 
in Hawaii and dyed pink to avoid confusion with wild, fertile flies. 
</P>
<P>
For most residents in the eight-square-mile spray zone around Brea, La Habra 
and Fullerton, however, the arrival of the steriles is good news. 
</P>
<P>
As some residents stared curiously at the odd sight Wednesday afternoon, a crew 
of four state workers cruised the streets of Brea for two hours, leaving a path 
of a half-million sterile Medflies in their wake. The process is aimed at 
distributing the specimens evenly throughout infested areas to try to breed the 
fertile flies out of existence. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm delighted by this because it means they won't be spraying here any more," 
said La Habra Mayor Beth Graham, who has heard increasing complaints about the 
aerial malathion applications since they began there in late November. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of people upset by the sprayings. There are always going to be 
some people who will protest anything, but this (sterile release program) is 
much preferable." Graham said. "Certainly, there's no reason to fear these 
sterile Medflies, and if they accomplish the same thing, great." 
</P>
<P>
But there is some debate over the efficiency of the sterile releases. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists concede that they are still puzzled by how the process works -- for 
example, whether it is the sterile males, or females, or both, that break the 
reproductive cycle. (The state is releasing both sexes.) They acknowledge that 
the success of the technique -- rarely tried on a scale as large as Southern 
California -- is far from guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
Although many residents seem to favor sterile flies over spraying, there has 
still been some grumbling. 
</P>
<P>
"The public in general has been just really misinformed about what this is all 
about," said Greg Guntle, a sterile release supervisor who oversaw Wednesday 
afternoon's distribution in the Brea area -- the fourth there since last week. 
"The biggest misconception is that we're actually spraying (malathion)." 
</P>
<P>
Some residents have angrily stopped the trucks to find out just what was going 
on, Guntle said; a few people have even thrown rocks and other objects at the 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
And several residents in Whittier -- where the state has been releasing the 
sterile flies for months -- complain that the insects seem attracted to fresh 
paint and have stuck themselves to newly painted walls. 
</P>
<P>
For Sanchez, who worked from the back of the truck Wednesday in Brea to release 
the flies, it is this occasionally negative reaction from the public that she 
says makes her job the toughest. "Some people just don't understand," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez, unemployed until she saw an advertisement for an agriculture aide in 
February, says she really enjoys the work. 
</P>
<P>
The flies come out readily and need only a bit of coaxing in cold weather. And 
flies that constantly surround her, occasionally nesting in her hair, aren't 
much of a problem, she insists. 
</P>
<P>
"The flies really don't bother me," she said as she sent another batch skyward. 
"If they were killer bees or something, I'd have problems. But these guys are 
harmless." 
</P>

$10-MILLION MCCOLL SETTLEMENT OFFERED; 
</P>
<P>
LITIGATION: DEFENDANTS WOULD PAY THE AMOUNT TO 200 FAMILIES WHO CLAIM THE TOXIC 
WASTE DUMP HAS CAUSED HEALTH AND PROPERTY DAMAGES.

<P>
A group of developers, oil companies, city insurers and others have agreed to 
pay almost $10 million to about 200 families to settle claims that the McColl 
toxic waste dump has harmed their health and property values, court documents 
show. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest round of settlements over the World War II-era dumping of 
aviation fuel refinery wastes at the site, Superior Court Judge Tully H. 
Seymour on Tuesday approved one $2.25-million offer from developers and is 
expected to rule soon on remaining offers. Two weeks ago, he approved a 
$700,000 settlement by the city's former insurers. 
</P>
<P>
The total settlements are expected to amount to about $52,000 per household for 
families who filed the second batch of lawsuits in late 1986 and early 1987, 
according to one document. A first round of lawsuits, settled in 1986, paid 
about $42,000 to each family filing suit, according to the document. 
</P>
<P>
The $10-million settlement figure was listed in the proposed agreement filed by 
Union and Shell oil companies. The two companies have agreed to pay the 
homeowners $950,000 to drop the suits against them, and their court papers 
state that this amount is almost 10% of the total $10-million offer. Seymour is 
scheduled to consider the Union and Shell settlements June 15. 
</P>
<P>
Other defendants -- oil companies, the city's insurers, developers, engineering 
firms and an adjacent country club -- have filed proposed settlements that 
total about $1.08 million. Court documents show that agreements have been 
reached in the remaining cases, but the specifics have not yet been filed with 
the court. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the homeowners and defendants contacted refused to talk about the 
proposed settlements or could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
Milo Burdick, a 58-year-old Fullerton resident whose home borders the dump site 
and who is one of the second-round plaintiffs in what has become known in legal 
circles as "McColl II," said lawyers in the complex case have not given him 
specific financial terms of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been told that they've basically reached an agreement and we'll be told 
about it in the near future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, after years of litigation, the prospect of an end to the legal 
maneuvering was not an altogether satisfying one for Burdick. 
</P>
<P>
"Does this make everything better? No," Burdick said. The dump "is still out 
there, and we still live here, so I won't be satisfied until they do something 
about it and clean it up. What's the money going to do?" 
</P>
<P>
Oil companies and other parties alleged to be responsible for the World War 
II-era dumping refinery sludge at the McColl site have been debating with the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency over how to clean up the site. The EPA 
favors burning the waste, while oil companies have been pushing to seal the 
wastes underground and leave it. A final decision is not expected until next 
March. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour left on vacation Tuesday and could not be reached for comment on the 
proposed settlements, which were hammered out after several all-day settlement 
hearings last year. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's approved settlement was offered by the Fullerton Hills Development 
Co., William Lyon Co. and the Chevron Land &amp; Development Co., which built 
homes around the McColl dump in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement calls for all homeowners to drop their suits against the company 
and not encourage other homeowners around McColl to file similar suits. 
</P>
<P>
Suits filed by residents claim that noxious fumes enter their homes from McColl 
and that nearby soil and ground water is contaminated, possibly leading to 
health problems. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour is expected to approve the remaining settlement offers from other 
developers, oil companies and others when he returns from vacation. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Union-Shell proposed agreement, the other proposals awaiting 
Seymour's signature are a combined $500,000 offer from seven other oil 
companies; $402,625 from the current and past two owners of the Los Coyotes 
Country Club, where toxic wastes also were dumped; $700,000 from the city of 
Fullerton's insurance carriers, and $105,000 from Chevron Corp. and Chevron USA 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the settlements, none of the defendants acknowledge any blame for 
putting the toxic sludge in the dump or for failing to clean it up before homes 
were built. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Fullerton has opposed settling the lawsuits and objects to the 
insurance companies' paying $700,000 on its behalf, said Richard Montevideo, 
one of the city's attorneys for the McColl suits. 
</P>
<P>
"The insurance companies settled over the objections and without the consent of 
the city," Montevideo said Tuesday.

SHERIDAN SAYS SHE'S HANDLED HOUSE SALES FOR CITY STAFF; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: CRITICS QUESTION WHAT OTHER CLIENTS SHE HAS REPRESENTED AND WHETHER 
THEY HAVE INTERESTS BEFORE THE COUNCIL.

<P>
Councilwoman and real estate agent Sally Anne Sheridan, under fire for her role 
in the sale of the city attorney's house, has also acknowledged being involved 
in the sale of homes for 14 city employees and eight executives of the Irvine 
Co. over the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
A city-ordered investigation of Sheridan's votes on issues involving the city 
attorney found no wrongdoing, but Sheridan's opponents in a hotly contested 
race for mayor have continued to question what other clients she has 
represented and whether they have interests before the council. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated by continued scrutiny, Sheridan and her husband, Donald, also a real 
estate agent, have opened to public inspection their income tax returns and 
records of real estate sales dating back to 1984, when she began serving on the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
Among city employees, records show, the Sheridans have been involved in selling 
or buying property on behalf of not only the city attorney but the Irvine city 
manager, the city clerk and the police chief. The Sheridans have also assisted 
in a property deal for the vice chairman of the Irvine Co., the city's largest 
landholder and master developer. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheridans say that these deals are a normal part of doing business, that 
they have not actively sought clients at city hall or at the Irvine Co., and 
that they have scrupulously tried to avoid any conflict of interest. They say 
they have each carefully studied the rules and regulations of the Fair 
Political Practices Commission and sought the advice of the city attorney when 
there were any questions. 
</P>
<P>
"I have voluntarily offered the information so that I can stop this witch hunt 
and get on with the issues in this campaign," Councilwoman Sheridan said. "As 
my husband says: 'When loving a woman and making a living in this city are 
against the law, it's time to leave.' " 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Roger Grable, whose home sale prompted the controversy, said that 
Sally Anne Sheridan has repeatedly asked him over the years about her votes 
involving the Irvine Co. and that he has advised her that her votes would be 
proper. 
</P>
<P>
City officials who have also used the Sheridans for help in their real estate 
transactions say they did so because they know her, trust her and found it 
convenient to do business with her. 
</P>
<P>
"Irvine city employees -- past or present -- having had real estate 
transactions with the Sheridans have nothing to hide or be ashamed of," said 
City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr., who used the Sheridans in three real estate 
transactions since 1984. "All of us, including spouses, resent any implication 
or arousal of suspicion that we did anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
At the council's request, Brady compiled a list of 20 real estate transactions 
between the Sheridans and a total of 14 current and former city employees, all 
occurring since Sheridan took office in 1984. Commissions from the sales 
totaled at least $79,500, according to records released by the Sheridans. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at the Irvine Co. expressed similar sentiments. "I had gotten to 
know Don over the last 10 years and he was the only real estate person I knew 
well in the city of Irvine," said Irvine Co. Vice Chairman Thomas H. Nielsen 
who listed and sold a home he owned in Irvine through the Sheridans. "I thought 
he had a good understanding of the market. 
</P>
<P>
"No one ever asked me or ever suggested to me that I use them, nor did Sally or 
Don ever come to me. Certainly that was never the case." 
</P>
<P>
The Sheridans disclosed that together they made commissions totaling $50,163 on 
deals that involved Irvine Co. personnel. In all, commissions from city 
employees and Irvine Co. executives totaled about $130,000, roughly 16% of the 
couple's gross combined earnings of $815,000 for six years. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheridans have been business partners in Orange County working as 
realtor-associates for an Irvine realty firm and have split most of their 
commissions since 1979, Donald Sheridan said. They were married in November, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Sally Anne Sheridan blames much of the uproar over the property transactions on 
her political nemesis and opponent in the June 5 election, Mayor Larry Agran. 
</P>
<P>
"No question, Agran is trying to destroy me personally, professionally and 
politically," Sheridan said. "I am not going to give up and hide behind some 
bush. This is the worst I have faced in my three runs for office." 
</P>
<P>
The controversy began last month when Councilman Edward A. Dornan, an Agran 
backer, asked the city manager whether Sheridan had a conflict of interest in 
her December vote to renew the contract of the Rutan &amp; Tucker law firm for 
city attorney services. In April, she and her husband earned $8,640 in 
commission by selling the home of City Atty. Grable, who works for the law 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
In response to Dornan's inquiry, City Manager Brady hired San Francisco 
attorney Joe Remcho, an expert in conflict-of-interest law, to investigate the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
Remcho's report, made public on May 8, said Sheridan's December vote was proper 
because she hadn't earned any money from the transaction at the time of the 
vote. However, the report said she should abstain from all votes involving 
Grable or Rutan &amp; Tucker for 12 months from the date of the home sale. 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan subsequently complied with the request at the April 24 council 
meeting, abstaining from a routine agenda item involving Grable's law firm. 
Under state law, elected officials must not vote on matters involving a 
personal financial gain of $250 or $500 for a spouse. 
</P>
<P>
Remcho also warned that city employees or elected officials who do business 
with each other or anyone with an interest pending before the council should 
consult the Fair Political Practices Commission, a state watchdog agency that 
monitors the conduct of elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan and Agran questioned Sheridan's role in convincing her council 
colleagues to hire Brady as the city manager in March, 1989, rather than 
conducting a national search. Sheridan's vote on Brady's contract came only 
nine months after Donald Sheridan had acted as the selling and buying agent on 
homes for then-Assistant City Manager Brady, records show. 
</P>
<P>
"When Sally Anne Sheridan is cheerleading for us to hire Paul Brady and a 
couple of years later I find out she made money in real estate transactions 
with him, I don't think that's very ethical," Dornan said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Sheridan's records, she and her husband split $16,038 in 
commission when Brady purchased a home through Donald Sheridan on June 1, 1988, 
and sold a home on June 29 of that year. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a legal opinion that says I've done nothing wrong," Sally Anne Sheridan 
said, referring to a private attorney she asked to review the Brady matter. 
</P>
<P>
In seven of the eight transactions involving Irvine Co. executives, Donald 
Sheridan said, he and his wife acted as agents. In the other, he said, they 
represented a client who did not work for the company and bought a house that 
turned out to be owned by an Irvine Co. manager. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Donald Sheridan said he helped Gary H. Hunt, a senior vice 
president, find a mobile home in El Morro Beach Mobile Home Park south of 
Crystal Cove. Donald Sheridan said he handled some the sales paper work for 
Hunt free. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt acknowledged that Donald Sheridan helped him find the mobile home but 
rejected any notion that it even remotely influenced Sally Anne Sheridan's 
votes on Irvine Co. matters. 
</P>
<P>
"There is absolutely no validity to all those accusations. They are patently 
absurd," Hunt said. "To assert that there could be undue influence exerted in 
the normal course of business is a political smoke screen."

Community members are rallying to support the family of Jimmy De La Riva, the 
4-year-old boy who died in an apartment fire last Friday as his father looked 
on helplessly. 
</P>
<P>
Lori and Joseph De La Riva and their four young children whom Joseph rescued 
from the blaze have been living in a motel room paid for by the Red Cross. The 
organization also paid for funeral services for Jimmy, who was buried Wednesday 
in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Employees at the Tustin post office, where the boy's mother has worked for 
about a month, have raised more than $700 for the family and plan to hold a 
bake sale Tuesday to raise more money. 
</P>
<P>
More than $1,500 has been donated to a memorial fund established by the boy's 
grandmother, Josie Ruiz, at the Bank of America branch in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
Ruiz said the family members are holding up well emotionally, although they 
remain angry that police officers blocked Joseph De La Riva from trying to 
rescue his son. Officers said he could have been killed in the attempt to bring 
Jimmy out. De La Riva rushed Joseph Jr., 7, and Adam, 6, out the front door of 
the burning apartment before carrying out Micah, 3, and Sarah, 1 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
"We are more at peace now," Ruiz said. "We're doing a lot better. We had a 
beautiful service. We know he's in a safe place. The pastor said he's playing 
in the streets of gold." 
</P>
<P>
Ruiz said the family is touched by the response of the community. 
</P>
<P>
"People from all over the county are donating money," she said. "Five dollars 
here or $10 there, but it's adding up. We hope it brings a lot of families 
closer together." 
</P>
<P>
The fire caused an estimated $80,000 damage to the three-bedroom apartment on 
Bliss Lane and destroyed most of the family's belongings. 
</P>
<P>
"They lost everything," Ruiz said. "They had no savings. Whatever money they 
had was in Joe's wallet and that was lost in the fire too." 
</P>
<P>
Erla Sine, a postal worker who is helping organize the bake sale, said De La 
Riva's co-workers wanted to help after learning of the tragedy. Donations of 
baked goods are being solicited for Tuesday's sale at the post office parking 
lot, 340 E. 1st St., from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think our employees alone will supply enough to last all day," Sine 
said. "With just our employees, we'd probably sell out by 11. There's only 
about 100 of us." 
</P>
<P>
Ruiz said the family has received donations of clothing, furniture and 
household goods, but is still in need of many items. They are looking for an 
apartment, she said, because they will be leaving the motel Friday.

2 UCI TEACHERS MAY PROTEST REPLACEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two UC Irvine instructors of Chinese language are expected to file formal 
grievances this week to protest their replacement by three professors hired 
from outside the university. 
</P>
<P>
Jennie Hu and Richard Liao, who were on year-to-year contracts, are upset over 
the hiring of three new instructors in the East Asian languages and literatures 
department, according to Daniel Tsang, a representative of Local 2226 of the 
American Federation of Teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Tsang said Hu and Liao were not given fair warning before the university 
decided against renewing their contracts. He said they were notified March 27 
that the university was interviewing applicants for the department, and both 
indicated their interest in the positions. However, neither was contacted nor 
interviewed, Tsang said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're saying they didn't evaluate them (for reappointment) in the correct 
manner," Tsang said. "To be fair, they should have interviewed the two people 
that were here." 
</P>
<P>
University spokeswoman Linda Granell disagreed. "They had the opportunity to 
apply," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Granell declined to comment specifically on the qualifications of those who 
were hired. But she said that one had a doctorate degree and that all were 
natives of China. 
</P>
<P>
Liao, who taught at the university for five years, holds two master's degrees 
in the area of Asian studies. Hu, who has taught at the university for three 
years, is a native of China and holds a bachelor's degree in Chinese 
literature. 
</P>
<P>
Granell was unable to give the names of the recently hired professors, saying 
that their names are kept confidential until they become employees of the 
university. She did say, however, that the candidates came from Cornell, the 
University of Vermont and the University of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
The UCI student newspaper, the New University, reported that petitions were 
circulating on behalf of Hu and Liao. DANICA KIRKA

SEVERE BUDGET CUTS PROPOSED FOR PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Projections of a 40% to 50% cut in the $12-million annual budget for the 
county's top transportation planning agency portend a bleak future for 
improving traffic congestion in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Keenan, chief financial officer of the Orange County Transportation 
Commission, presented various scenarios for the 1990-91 budget at the panel's 
meeting in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Each of them involves serious belt-tightening, resulting in spending plans 
totaling between $5.7 million and $6.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
The commission oversees traffic priorities countywide and, through armies of 
consultants, readies some transportation projects for construction by other 
agencies such as Caltrans and the traffic departments of individual cities. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the reduction proposals call for completing projects already under way 
and not starting new ones. The reason for that is partly that state and federal 
grant money is becoming scarce, officials said, and partly because the OCTC 
staff is already spread too thin. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the commission expects to make significant withdrawals from cash 
reserves and from funds previously earmarked for the Santa Ana Freeway transit 
way, a special ramp reserved for buses and car pools. 
</P>
<P>
A public hearing on the proposed budget is scheduled for June 11. JEFFREY A.

4 JOURNALISM AWARDS FOR SUNNY HILLS HIGH

<TEXT>
<P>
The student newspaper at Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton, The Accolade, 
took the most awards in the Times Orange County 1990 high school journalism 
awards, winning four categories and earning two honorable mentions. 
</P>
<P>
High school newspapers throughout the county were recognized for outstanding 
work during the 1989-90 school year in an awards ceremony Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Accolade won in the "best issue" category for newspapers with more than 
four pages. Judges called the publication "an exceptional paper," lauding its 
layout, writing and overall presentation. "Students are getting good training," 
judges said. 
</P>
<P>
In the division including newspapers of four pages or less, winner in the best 
issue category was Paw Prints, from Los Amigos High in the Garden Grove Unified 
School District. Judges said the school's paper "shows lots of teacher-student 
dedication" and complimented its "serious tone." 
</P>
<P>
The Accolade and Paw Prints earn $1,000 each for the schools' journalism 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
Betsy Burnbridge of Fullerton's Sunny Hills High School won the award for best 
sports story for an entry judges said included "lots of good insights." 
</P>
<P>
In the feature story category, Elizabeth Bangs of Sunny Hills won top honors 
for an article on teen pregnancy. Vanessa Flint of Orange High School won for 
best feature photo of a football coach and player. She also won honorable 
mention for a photo of scuba divers. 
</P>
<P>
The award for best news story went to Sheila McDonald of Dana Hills High School 
in Dana Point for a story about a mock trial on campus. McDonald "did a 
particularly good job of communicating the drama and intensity," judges said. 
</P>
<P>
In the best cartoon/illustration category, Jennifer Mahr of Sunny Hills won top 
honors for an illustration accompanying a story about depression. 
</P>
<P>
"The bold pen-work of her illustration," judges said, "seizes the eye, 
fulfilling the obligation of the illustrator to prepare the reader for the 
story to follow." 
</P>
<P>
Judges unanimously agreed that an analysis by Duncan Delp of Garden Grove High 
School about a closed campus planetarium was the best editorial entered. 
</P>
<P>
"It's concise, clear and makes its point by acknowledging the arguments 
advanced by those who say it would be too much bother to reopen the 
planetarium, and then it shows their weaknesses," judges said.JOHN PENNER

PLANNING HEAD QUITS, CITES FOE ON COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David V. Hart, chairman of the Planning Commission, resigned Monday, citing 
conflict with City Councilwoman Joanne Coontz. 
</P>
<P>
Hart, who has served 19 years as a commissioner, submitted a letter of 
resignation to Mayor Don E. Smith Monday evening which was presented at this 
week's City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my understanding that Councilwoman Joanne Coontz has expressed 
dissatisfaction to (Smith) about my service as a planning commissioner for the 
City of Orange," Hart said in the two-paragraph letter. 
</P>
<P>
Hart served on the Planning Commission from 1963 to 1968 and has served 
continuously since 1976, including several years as chairman. He asked that his 
resignation become effective immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Coontz said Hart's resignation had been discussed for months but that his 
reasons for stepping down came as a "complete surprise." 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Coontz said she had not talked substantively with Hart 
about any development issue this year and was "shocked and surprised to be 
singled out by Mr. Hart as the reason for his resignation." 
</P>
<P>
Planning Commissioner Don Greek said he might also resign because of what he 
called a "list of gripes (against Coontz) that go years back." 
</P>
<P>
"What I am seriously considering is running for City Council," Greek said, 
adding that he would wait to resign from the commission before announcing his 
candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
Coontz and Councilman William Steiner are up for reelection in November. 
</P>
<P>
If Greek runs for a council seat, Hart said, he would be "very anxious and 
willing" to manage the campaign. MARY HELEN BERG

MORE HEALTH CARE FOR POOR URGED; 
</P>
<P>
CLINICS: THE GRAND JURY OFFERS A STINGING INDICTMENT ON THE LACK OF MEDICAL 
SERVICES. OFFICIALS SAY THE FUNDS AREN'T THERE. 
</P>

Saying that Orange County's overburdened community clinics meet "an urgent 
need" for a growing number of residents who lack health insurance, the county 
grand jury Wednesday called on the Board of Supervisors to expand these 
services and "take more responsibility for basic health-care for the poor." 
</P>
<P>
While offering few ideas on how the county should pay for such an expansion, 
the grand jury recommended that supervisors assume leadership by "educating the 
citizenry to accept basic health care for the poor as a social obligation." 
</P>
<P>
Top county officials called the fact-finding body's latest report 
well-intentioned but said they had no idea where they could find the money to 
expand services at county and community-operated clinics. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's the source of funding?" asked Don R. Roth, chairman of the Board of 
Supervisors. "Yes, we ought to expand the availability of services to the poor, 
but we're limited by the amount of dollars available." 
</P>
<P>
Grand juror Frank Spittle said he and his colleagues did not deal in detail 
with the question of funding in their report because it is the supervisors' job 
"to set those priorities." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez noted that in March the board recommended giving 
community clinics $1.5 million from California's new tobacco tax. But beyond 
that, he said, "the money is just not provided by the state" and key state 
legislators now appear willing to accept the deep cuts in health care 
recommended by Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian proposed 1990-91 budget slashes of $19.1 million from county 
health-care programs, and overall, the county projects a deficit of more than 
$20 million next year. In this environment, Roth, Vasquez and Supervisor 
Harriett M. Weider said, expanded health services were unlikely soon. 
</P>
<P>
But Margie Fites-Seigel, vice president of the Coalition of Community Clinics 
which represents the 12 community-run clinics, applauded the grand jury 
findings, especially one that asked supervisors to give community clinics "a 
stable source of funding." 
</P>
<P>
She added that it was time for Orange County to "come to terms with what is 
basic health care . . . and then ensure access to basic health care for all 
citizens." 
</P>
<P>
Noting that more than 2,500 pregnant women were turned away from county-run 
prenatal clinics last year because those facilities were full, Fites-Seigel 
said, "Orange County should be ashamed of itself. From the community clinic 
standpoint, we should not have gotten to that point." 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury was the latest group this year to ask county government to 
assume a broader role in the health care of the poor. Earlier, the Orange 
County Medical Assn. and the United Way Health Care Task Force asked 
supervisors to offer a wide range of general medical services at county-run 
clinics and also ease crowding at Medi-Cal hospitals by operating their own 
birthing center. But supervisors have repeatedly said they have no funds for 
such ventures. 
</P>
<P>
According to the grand jury report, more than 120,000 people with Medi-Cal 
coverage or no insurance at all use the county's community clinics each year as 
their primary source of care. There, the report said, they receive "accessible, 
comprehensive, quality, cost-effective treatment," for very low fees, sometimes 
only $20 -- or a donation by the patient. 
</P>
<P>
The 12 clinics form a diverse group, most struggling to survive on a mix of 
private and public funds. Two of them are operated by UC Irvine. Others include 
four family-planning clinics operated by Planned Parenthood and general medical 
clinics such as the Share Our Selves Clinic in Costa Mesa, La Amistad de Jose 
in Garden Grove and the South County Community Clinic in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to offering "well-child" visits, these clinics now offer "primary 
care" also known as general medical care, the report said, treating such 
problems as respiratory infections, abdominal pain and chronic headaches. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the community clinics, the county Health Care Agency operates clinics 
for state-mandated services that include prenatal care, immunizations, child 
health screenings and treatment for sexually transmitted disease. 
</P>
<P>
But the report said: "The four permanent county public health clinics are busy 
beyond capacity, causing some clients to stand in lines in hallways waiting for 
services sometimes for hours." 
</P>
<P>
Among the Grand Jury's recommendations were suggestions that supervisors 
provide a larger and more stable share" of financial support to community 
clinics, expand locations of county clinics, especially in South County and 
link public and private resources to help the poor get care. (The county did 
that this year, the report noted, when supervisors allocated $1.3 million from 
tobacco tax funds to start a birthing center at Western Medical 
Center-Anaheim.) 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the grand jury asked county officials to expand county clinic 
services to provide a primary care, which is a wide range of outpatient medical 
services beyond those mandated by state law. 
</P>
<P>
County Health Care Agency director Tom Uram called many of the recommendations 
"interesting ideas" that would be reviewed. But he said he would recommend 
against expanding county clinics to offer primary care. "We're a broker of 
services. We're not a provider. We contract for primary care," Uram said.

PEOPLE: NUN NOT FORCED TO SACRIFICE IDENTITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When she was younger, Doreen Herrman was a regular tomboy, climbing trees, 
jumping over hedges, playing baseball and touch football. 
</P>
<P>
"In my days, girls were nice young ladies, and my mother couldn't understand 
why I couldn't be like the other girls," she said. 
</P>
<P>
It's five decades later and that romping little girl is Sister Doreen Herrman, 
69, who just celebrated her 50th year as a member of the Third Franciscan Order 
of Syracuse (New York), a teaching and nursing order. 
</P>
<P>
"To a certain extent, I still did all those things after becoming a nun," she 
said, although a recent leg ailment that requires surgery has slowed her 
somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
"For some reason, people outside the convent think we don't have any fun, that 
we can't have parties and can't have friends," said the recently retired 
principal of San Juan Capistrano's Mission School. She continues to teach 
there. 
</P>
<P>
And, she said, others think of a nun's existence as unchallenging and dull and 
that the whole purpose is a religious life. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not true," she said, but she admits that the reputation has caused a 
drop in the number of women who are interested in becoming nuns. 
</P>
<P>
Sister Doreen said the life of a nun is a matter of interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
"Being together with one another, playing together, praying together, going 
through our struggles together, teasing each other and playing tricks on one 
another is part of our life," she said. "It's not unlike regular community 
life." 
</P>
<P>
And just like life outside the convent, she said, "we try to let people see us 
as normal, warm human beings. We all have our own personalities." 
</P>
<P>
As teachers -- as any teachers -- she notes, "nuns have to point out mistakes 
and correct people." 
</P>
<P>
"There are those who say we are hard to please and are grouches," added the 
University of Dayton (Ohio) graduate. "I guess sometimes we can be that way, 
just like any teacher. We often have to nag at some students to remind them of 
their shortcomings." 
</P>
<P>
Sister Doreen has spent most of her career as a nun in Syracuse and in Hawaii, 
where she received her master's degree in education at the University of 
Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
She has been at the mission in San Juan Capistrano for 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I have accomplished a number of things, most of all that I was a 
forthright person," she said. "I called a spade a spade." 
</P>
<P>
And there are no regrets about her life as a teaching nun, which includes 
instructing students in elementary, junior high and high school. 
</P>
<P>
As principal at Mission School, she initiated a computer system and used 
computers to aid schoolwork. 
</P>
<P>
While she sees the need for computers, she insists that "computers will never 
replace teachers." 
</P>
<P>
Her long career as a nun belies the fact that she wasn't especially interested 
in becoming a nun and, early on, had planned a career in law. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was young, a friend asked me to visit a convent with her one night, but 
I had a date and didn't want to go," said Sister Doreen. "She told me, 'Keep 
your old date.' But I broke it and went with her." 
</P>
<P>
During her career, she shied away from politics. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe in being political," she said. "Maybe it's because I have 
stereotyped some politicians as being untruthful and saying things just to get 
what they want." 
</P>
<P>
However, she added, "people have wrong ideas about (nuns), and maybe I have the 
wrong idea of some politicians." 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledgments -- Donald D. Reimann, who will retire next month after 30 years 
of teaching at Fullerton College, was the unanimous choice for the President's 
Award, the school's top staff honor of the year. The veteran humanities teacher 
also received $500. He is the father of seven children.

"Our investigation of this accident is complete, but it has not been released 
yet," Card said. "It's a fairly thick report. Basically what happened is that 
there wasn't enough water (beneath the ship) as the ship came in." 
</P>
<P>
The 800-foot oil tanker American Trader apparently ran over its own anchor on 
Feb. 7 as it was preparing to offload at a marine mooring about a mile and a 
half off Huntington Beach. At the time, the cause of the accident was 
attributed to the ship's being in shallow water, and Card said that is verified 
in the written report. 
</P>
<P>
Card said no big surprises will come in the report, which is about the overall 
federal investigation of the accident. He said the report is likely to be made 
public sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard has issued an order requiring annual depth-checking surveys of 
the ocean floor around the Huntington Beach offshore mooring, he said. But he 
said overall questions about oil delivery still remain to be addressed at the 
state level. 
</P>
<P>
"The larger question . . . is how the state wants to treat (ocean delivery of) 
oil," Card said. "As long as you use more than 2 million barrels of oil a day, 
and you import 1 million of that, you're going to need to bring it in in some 
way. This may or may not be the most efficient way, but it's the Coast Guard's 
job to make sure it's done as safely as possible." 
</P>
<P>
The State Lands Commission has jurisdiction over most of the offshore 
oil-delivery moorings in California, including the one 1.3 miles off Huntington 
Beach. So far the commission has issued no report or recommendations on the 
offshore moorings following the Feb. 7 oil spill. The Huntington Beach City 
Council on April 19 wrote the state commission, urging it to deny ships further 
use of the offshore mooring in that city. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J. Mays, who was among the speakers at the oil 
spill seminar, said in an interview that the city still is waiting for the 
State Lands Commission to respond. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically the ball is in their court," Mays said. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor added, "I guess they (the State Lands Commission) are still 
collecting information and evaluating our request. We want to get rid of that 
mooring. . . . There's no reason for it to be there. It faces the open ocean, 
and it can be vulnerable to high seas. Even if you have a six-foot clearance 
(between ocean floor and ship bottom), if you have six- to eight-foot ocean 
swells, you're going to have a ship bouncing up and down. 
</P>
<P>
Mays said the safest thing to do is move the offshore moorings to a port, such 
as Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The oil spill seminar was sponsored by the California Marine Parks and Harbors 
Assn., an Irvine-based private organization consisting primarily of small-craft 
boat owners. 
</P>
<P>
Mays told the group that Huntington Beach was better able than most cities to 
handle a crisis like the oil spill because the city, since 1983, has had a 
disaster-preparedness plan. The city devised its plan following the heavy rains 
and floods there in 1983.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: 58TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT; 
</P>
<P>
MAYS RILES RIVALS ON SPECIAL INTERESTS ISSUE 
</P>

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After two months of mostly polite dialogue among the five Republican candidates 
vying for the open seat in the 58th Assembly District, candidate Thomas J. Mays 
ignited a feud Wednesday by charging that two of his opponents are controlled 
by special interests. 
</P>
<P>
Mays' attack prompted his Huntington Beach opponent, Peter von Elten, to say: 
"I think he's got a hell of a lot of nerve to make accusations about me. I 
think Tom is becoming a little hysterical now." 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Wednesday afternoon, Mays charged that most of von 
Elten's campaign money came from developers who would command his attention in 
the Legislature. Von Elten is an executive at Mola Development Co. in 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Mays also charged that Long Beach Republican candidate Dr. Seymour Alban, a 
physician, would be similarly compromised because he has so many contributions 
from the medical community. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's desperate," Alban said. "I think he's just flailing about because 
he's out of touch with the electorate." 
</P>
<P>
Mays, the mayor of Huntington Beach, said his campaign will probably be 
outspent at least 3 to 1 by both von Elten and Alban. He called on all of the 
candidates to limit campaign expenditures to $150,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
"I am appalled at the hypocrisy of the candidates who talk about ethics in 
their campaign but who are using big monetary contributions from special 
interest groups in an attempt to buy the election," Mays said. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates are running in the June 5 Republican primary for the seat held 
by Assemblyman Dennis Brown (R-Long Beach), who said he will not run for 
reelection. The mostly Republican district stretches from Long Beach south to 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Mays, von Elten and Alban, the Republican candidates are Long 
Beach City Council members Jan Hall and Jeffrey A. Kellog. Democrat Luanne W. 
Pryor and Libertarian candidate Scott Stier, both of Long Beach, are running 
unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
An angry von Elten responded to Mays by charging that Mays has been a "puppet 
of the Huntington Beach Co.," a large developer in the city. Mays has voted 
recently on issues benefiting his contributors, von Elten said. 
</P>
<P>
Because von Elten declined to identify the contributors, Mays said he could not 
respond. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really insulted when he makes those accusations because he truly is the 
one who has shown favoritism for those special interests that have supported 
him," von Elten said. 
</P>
<P>
The environment has been a major issue in the district, and Mays attacked his 
opponents' claims of protecting the beaches by pointing to their connections 
with the oil industry. He noted that Alban has more than $110,000 invested in 
Union Oil Explorers Ltd. and Mesa Petroleum Co. 
</P>
<P>
"That is a small part of my portfolio and it has nothing to do with my 
opposition to any offshore oil drilling," Alban said. 
</P>
<P>
Mays also said von Elten's employer, the Mola Co., owns several oil wells in 
Huntington Beach. But von Elten charged that Mays has taken thousands of 
dollars in contributions from oil companies in his City Council races. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a state campaign with a whole different set of problems and a 
different set of rules," Mays responded.

LANDMARK, HON STRIKE DEAL ON $275-MILLION LAND PARCEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Landmark Land Co. said Wednesday it has agreed to sell a 6,700-acre Riverside 
County parcel to Laguna Hills developer Barry Hon for $275 million and has 
hired an investment banking firm to peddle the company's remaining big-name 
golf and resort assets. 
</P>
<P>
The new deal comes just nine days after federal thrift regulators blocked a 
$967-million sale of Carmel-based Landmark's prime properties to Hon. 
Regulators had called the original deal unsound because Landmark's subsidiary, 
Oak Tree Savings Bank in New Orleans, was providing too much financing to Hon. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that it was in the best interest of everyone to reach this revised 
agreement quickly," Hon said in a prepared statement. "I believe that this 
revised agreement gives us the best real estate development that Landmark owns 
and that we are still well-positioned to purchase other Oak Tree assets." 
</P>
<P>
Under the revised deal, Hon would put $75 million down by the end of July for 
undeveloped land in a planned golf course community called Oak Valley at the 
Pomona Freeway and the Redlands Freeway near Beaumont. Oak Tree would provide 
$200 million in financing. Regulators must approve the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
Landmark, a leading golf course and resort developer, holds and operates more 
than $1 billion worth of real estate through Oak Tree. But federal law enacted 
last August to bail out the ailing thrift deposit insurance system now requires 
S&amp;Ls to sell their interests in such investments within five years. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald G. Barton, Landmark's chairman, president and chief executive, said 
directors had wanted to dispose of the property in a way least disruptive to 
the more than 3,500 employees who work in the golf, hotel and real estate 
development and operations divisions. The original deal with Hon would have 
transferred those divisions intact. 
</P>
<P>
In the face of federal objections, though, directors decided Tuesday to hire 
Salomon Brothers Inc., a New York investment banking firm, to try to come up 
with a buyer for the entire company, Barton said. Any buyer interested only in 
the real estate operations could sell Oak Tree to a third party, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had the financial capacity, we'd pull out the real estate companies 
ourself" and put them in the holding company, he said. "Since we don't, we have 
to look elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
While he acknowledges that few prospective purchasers are large enough to buy 
Landmark, which has $3 billion in assets, Barton said he believes that Salomon 
will come up with offers in one to three months. Salomon will also look into 
other options, including the possibility of bringing new investors into Oak 
Tree. 
</P>
<P>
As a last resort, he said, Landmark would liquidate Oak Tree's real estate 
investments over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
Since the original deal with Hon was announced in mid-April, Landmark's stock 
has taken a beating on Wall Street. The price has fallen from $17.50 a share on 
the day the deal was announced to close Wednesday at $10.875 a share, up 50 
cents a share from Tuesday's close. Stock analysts and financial advisers had 
doubted that the first deal with Hon would go through. It was structured to 
close in two phases over a year with a total of $200 million in cash from Hon 
and more than $750 million in financing from Oak Tree, an amount that 
represented more than 25% of Oak Tree's assets and made regulators balk. 
</P>
<P>
In the revised deal, Hon gives up his plans to own resort properties in three 
states, more than 10,000 acres of developable land and such golfing jewels as 
PGA West, La Quinta and Mission Hills Country Club, all in the Palm Desert 
area. 
</P>
<P>
But the new agreement "makes more sense both for Landmark and for Hon," said 
Kenneth D. Campbell, an analyst with the Montvale, N.J., real estate investment 
advising firm Audit Investments Inc. "It gives Landmark more flexibility in 
dealing with others, and Hon can come in and bargain for whatever he wants." 
</P>
<P>
Though Hon could not be reached for comment, his lawyers and advisers agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe Mr. Hon got the pick of the litter and is still well-positioned to 
purchase other Oak Tree assets," said attorney William Biel of Costa Mesa. And 
Hon's financial adviser, Vaughn Mahnke, said Hon will "remain a key player in 
the disposition of other of Oak Tree's assets." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce A. Tester, an Irvine lawyer who is part of Hon's negotiating team, said 
it was premature to say whether Hon will bring in other investors to purchase 
other Landmark assets. But he said the team has talked with several Japanese 
companies that are interested in Landmark's California golfing operations and 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
The revised deal would be Landmark's biggest sale of a single asset, Barton 
said. It would also give Hon his biggest project ever. Hon is currently 
developing the 2,750-acre Foothill Ranch with 3,900 housing units in South 
Orange County and is proposing an 850-acre development in Rancho Palos Verdes 
that would include a 450-room Ritz-Carlton resort hotel and two golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
Like many of Hon's previous developments, the Oak Valley project, with five 
miles of frontage on the Redlands Freeway, is oriented toward golf and 
recreation. One of four planned golf courses is already built.

RITZ-CARLTON GIVES PARENTS BREAK, OFFERS CHILDREN'S PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Nothing like a night away from life's troubles to calm the soul. All it takes 
is a quiet dinner and a movie, just a few blissful hours away from your 
problems and responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Problems, that is, such as picking up your socks, making decent grades or 
trying to impress the girl who sits three desks away. A child, after all, can 
use a break, too. And that's where the Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel thinks it has 
the answer. 
</P>
<P>
For the third summer, the Dana Point hotel is trying to capitalize on the 
family vacation market by sponsoring a children's program. It is designed to 
give parents a rest from watching junior and to give children a chance to, uh, 
chill out. 
</P>
<P>
Children's programs at hotels are not a new idea, but the Ritz-Carlton version 
is more elaborate than most. For $40, parents will be able to put their child 
through a daylong list of events that includes gymnastics, sandcastle contests, 
swimming pool games, arts and crafts, and kite flying. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday and Saturday evenings, the hotel organizes a dinner and movie for 
children -- allowing parents the chance to escape for a romantic dinner if they 
choose. 
</P>
<P>
For teen-agers, the seaside hotel will be offering informal volleyball and 
croquet. 
</P>
<P>
Despite room rates that start at $185 a night, the Ritz-Carlton has been a 
destination for vacationing families. The hotel promotes itself as an ideal 
location for visits to Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm, as well as to Sea 
World and the San Diego Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
"This is where families come, and to have something to do with the kids is 
important," said hotel spokeswoman Christie Johnson. The children's program 
starts June 22. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of summer, the hotel, which is only 6 years old, will undergo a 
million-dollar refurbishment. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, the Cafe restaurant will be remodeled and its name changed to the 
Terrace Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The lounge will also be made over. Though the furniture looks as new as ever, 
General Manager Henry Schielein points out wobbling antique replica chairs as 
evidence of the effects of five years of power lunches and sunset cocktail 
parties. The hotel will remodel its suites later this year and eventually plans 
to redo its guest rooms.

RENOVATION: BUDGET-CRUNCHED COLLEGES CAPITALIZE ON PROFITABLE STUDENT CENTERS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The generation that grew up at the shopping mall now can find one right on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
Colleges, feeling a budget crunch, have been able to capitalize on student 
centers and turn what was a losing or break-even proposition into a cash cow. 
</P>
<P>
Once synonymous with cafeteria food and rot-gut coffee, student centers now 
house mini-malls. 
</P>
<P>
At the University of South Carolina, students can do their banking, shop for 
clothes, flowers, cards, drop off their dry cleaning, get a haircut, visit a 
travel agency and pick up tickets to local concerts and shows. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we had a huge empty space in the heart of campus -- very valuable 
real estate that we were letting go to waste," said R. W. (Pete) Denton, senior 
vice president for business and finance at the university in Columbia, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
As cuts in federal aid to education continued in the 1980s, other universities 
around the country realized that their student centers were not generating any 
income or, worse, they were losing money. 
</P>
<P>
"And besides, this building was supposed to be the center of campus social life 
-- the living room of the campus-based students -- and it looked awful," Denton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
So Denton, like student union directors elsewhere, began to try to figure out 
what students wanted. 
</P>
<P>
"We did market surveys. We did studies. But mostly we listened to the 
students," he said. 
</P>
<P>
What the students wanted turned out to be what many had experience hanging out 
in: shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
The university renovated 15,000 square feet in the centrally located University 
Union building at a cost of $350,000. Within three years of its 1985 opening, 
renovation costs were recovered. Now, the operation is producing $300,000 in 
revenues annually. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State University in Fort Collins had a money-losing student union when 
Manny Cunard became its director in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"It had a net loss of $250,000 and was in technical default," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the union, which collects rents from the merchants -- and a percentage of 
their profits -- has an annual operating budget of $14 million and generates a 
surplus of $300,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Does this mean that what's good for the student union is good for the students? 
</P>
<P>
At the University of Michigan, enterprising students set up a used textbook 
exchange that allowed cheaper books and better returns for students. Union mall 
merchants were not pleased. 
</P>
<P>
The Barnes &amp; Noble book outlet, unhappy with the competition, gave the 
university an ultimatum -- banish the student book business or say goodby to 
Barnes &amp; Noble, one student organizer said. 
</P>
<P>
The student book exchange is now located in a cramped space in another building 
three blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan Student Union director Frank Cianciola explained: For the amount of 
time the student book exchange "wanted to use it and the size of the space they 
wanted, it would have also conflicted with other student groups." 
</P>
<P>
Cianciola arrived at the Ann Arbor campus in 1980 to find in the basement of 
the Michigan Student Union a long-abandoned cafeteria and lots of empty space. 
Now the union has an annual operating budget of $6 million and profits of 
$150,000. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Blackburn, executive director of the Assn. of College Unions 
International, is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
In his office two blocks from the student union at Indiana University in 
Bloomington, Blackburn said the requirement that unions be self-sustaining 
profit centers might overshadow the original educational role. 
</P>
<P>
"They served as laboratories of citizenship for students," said Blackburn, 
describing the unions as centers for student organizing and places for 
political as well as cultural activities. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a balance has to be achieved between the commercial interests and the 
traditional educational role these buildings serve and I think that will be a 
problem."

RANDY LEWIS: THE NIGHT SAMMY DAVIS JR. OVERSHADOWED OL' BLUE EYES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Randy Lewis

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sammy Davis Jr. was one of those famous folks whose celebrity overshadowed his 
talents, especially during the last half of his life when his 
cigarette-puffing, head-swaggering manner had become its own parody. 
</P>
<P>
I have to confess to being among those who always figured Davis would go down 
in entertainment history -- if he went down at all -- as a crony of Frank 
Sinatra and Dean Martin, rather than for anything he had accomplished on his 
own as a song and dance man. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until I saw him at the Pacific Amphitheatre in 1987, when he was 
sharing a bill with his Rat Pack pal Frankie, that I caught a real glimpse of 
why Davis had earned and not just befriended his way onto the showbiz Mt. 
Olympus. 
</P>
<P>
Before that night, I, probably like most of my post-World War II peers, had my 
opinion of Davis shaped through his talk show and telethon gigs, not to mention 
those always penetrating interviews with Army Archerd on Oscar nights. 
</P>
<P>
As a singer, he was known to us in the rock generation chiefly through his only 
No. 1 single, the diabetic-seizure inducing "Candy Man." 
</P>
<P>
So I had come to the Pacific prepared to endure Davis as part of the price of 
getting to hear Sinatra again, knowing full well that Frank still could be, on 
a good night, the best pop singer in the world.

<P>
That tepid August evening, however, turned out to be a bad one for the Chairman 
of the Board as he rambled somewhat disjointedly between songs and never took 
his eyes away from a TelePrompTer that scrolled all his lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
But it was a great night for Sammy. Instead of giving us one of those 
exaggerated Vegas lounge-act performances that had seemed to typify him, Davis 
came across as a sharp, canny vocalist whose innate rhythmic sense made it 
perfectly clear why he had jumped to the stages of vaudeville virtually as soon 
as he could walk. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, he did give us his overblown signature tune, "I Gotta Be Me," but he 
infused a surprising amount of freshness and character into it, and into such 
familiar material as "Begin the Beguine," "Satin Doll" and even "The Girl From 
Ipanema." In selections from "Porgy &amp; Bess," he reminded us why he had been 
such an appropriate choice to play Sportin' Life in the film nearly three 
decades before. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, I felt a little sheepish realizing that I'd expected nothing more 
from the first half of the concert than a stroll down memory lane with Sammy, 
Friend of the Superstars. I left that night with the happy realization that as 
a musician, Sammy Davis didn't have to be anybody's junior.

POP BEAT: WEIR, WASSERMAN PAIR UP IN ACT FILLED WITH ENOUGH INTENSITY TO RAISE 
THE DEAD; 
</P>
<P>
THE GRATEFUL DEAD GUITARIST AND SINGER JOINED THE BAY AREA BASSIST AT THE COACH 
HOUSE. THE SETS OFTEN LACKED THE GRACE AND INTERACTION NEEDED TO ROUND OUT THE 
MUSIC.

<P>
Usually, when a band member moonlights from a major rock group, it's to kick 
back, take it easy and do some musical meandering. 
</P>
<P>
With the Grateful Dead, though, laid-back meandering is the gist of the 
everyday agenda. So it was fitting that Bob Weir tried something different 
Tuesday night at the Coach House in his duo show with Bay Area bassist Rob 
Wasserman -- namely, near-constant focus and intensity. 
</P>
<P>
As singer and guitarist for the Dead, the Ol' Man River of rock bands, Weir is 
part of a slowly unfolding musical ebb and flow. The Big Muddy approach may be 
just the thing for arena evenings or sunbaked stadium afternoons when the Dead 
provide the soundtrack for their followers' gentle communitarianism. But slow 
and mellow isn't the ticket when the music is pared down to bare basics -- a 
singer with an acoustic guitar, joined by an accompanist shuttling between a 
traditional acoustic stand-up bass and an upright electric version that looked 
like an Art Deco reconstruction of the old-fashioned design. 
</P>
<P>
Weir and Wasserman were anything but mellow, playing two sets that emphasized 
forceful rhythms and, for just a bassist and guitarist, a fair amount of 
hard-edged noise. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the 90-minute concert (two 45-minute sets divided by a half-hour 
intermission) had some of the trappings of a Dead show in miniature. The 
audience consisted overwhelmingly of new-generation Deadheads, listeners in 
their teens and early 20s who hadn't even been born in 1965 when the Grateful 
Dead began. 
</P>
<P>
The packed Coach House featured the usual uniforms and comportment: tie-dyed 
shirts and peasant dresses, bandannas and serapes, incense burning, ritualistic 
free-form dancing in the wings and the characteristically pleasant mood that 
makes the Deadheads' hippie-throwback antiquarianism a little easier to stomach 
than if they were hippies in fashion only. 
</P>
<P>
The repertoire also followed the Dead's rootsy eclecticism. Most of the show 
was devoted to originals Weir has recorded with the Dead or on his own albums, 
but there was also a liberal heaping of standards ranging from Robert Johnson's 
"Walking Blues" to the Beatles' "Blackbird" and Bob Dylan's "When I Paint My 
Masterpiece" to a crooned encore of "Misty." 
</P>
<P>
Weir sang with immediacy and conviction, even on the good-timey numbers early 
in the show. The energy of his performance helped compensate for a voice that 
was as texturally flat and featureless as America's midsection. (Still, despite 
an earnest effort, Weir is not a singer you want to hear attempt "Misty.") 
</P>
<P>
Looking athletic in shorts and a polo shirt, Weir was the lean-and-intense 
antithesis of his partner in the Dead, Jerry Garcia, rock's answer to Santa 
Claus. As Weir strummed his hard, percussive rhythm parts, and Wasserman 
followed his lead with hammering bass lines, one wished that Garcia were there 
to provide some of his sweet, airy guitar melodies. Especially in the first 
set, the music lacked the melodic grace notes and interactive playing that 
would have made it fuller and more rounded. A harsh sound mix didn't help. 
</P>
<P>
The second set was less blunt, and more reflective, as Weir explored serious 
themes. "Artificial Flowers," an old Broadway show tune once popularized by 
Bobby Darin, juxtaposed sprightly, ragtime-influenced music with a bleak story 
about an abandoned child forced to scrape for pennies by making "artificial 
flowers, flowers for ladies of fashion to wear." 
</P>
<P>
Weir was able to make his bitter point about the exploited poor and the 
exploiting rich with some subtlety (at least more so than on "Throwing Stones," 
the soapbox anthem that closed the set). Delicacy also was a virtue on "Easy to 
Fall," a warm, gently philosophical number. 
</P>
<P>
Weir and Wasserman also took time in the second set to stretch out with more 
responsive playing that finally enabled Wasserman -- best known for recording 
an album of bass-and-voice duets with the likes of Rickie Lee Jones, Aaron 
Neville and Lou Reed -- to show more than the unremarkable accompaniments he 
had played through most of the show. Wasserman's big solo ranged from the 
obvious (blues rock riffs and "Satisfaction") to the enchanting (a passage that 
sounded like twin Celtic or country fiddles, created by bowing a drone with his 
right hand while simultaneously tapping out a lead with his left hand). 
</P>
<P>
While the show offered the Deadheads something different -- concentrated 
intensity in a small club -- Weir and Wasserman didn't try to reach out and 
lend the show an extra personal dimension. The Dead rarely speak to their 
audiences from the stage. Besides a mumbled excuse for some early sound 
problems, and a directive to the audience to "clap in time" when it was 
clapping chaotically during one of the more rocking numbers, Weir more or less 
remained mum, too. 
</P>
<P>
Deadheads might say that talk from the pulpit isn't necessary when communion 
through music is complete. As it was, they remained in a rapture from start to 
finish, applauding each number with religious zeal. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps if they were a less faithful flock, a more demanding audience, Weir 
would have reached out in a way that most audiences find important. But in 
matters of faith -- and that's what's involved with the world's only 
stadium-sized cult band -- the normal standards don't apply. 
</P>
<P>
Kris McKay, a newcomer from Austin, Tex., had the unenviable job of playing an 
acoustic opening set for a cult that wasn't hers (she told the audience that 
she is on the same record label as the Dead, as if that was going to earn her 
points). While the crowd kept up a steady hum of chatter through McKay's set, 
it also displayed its bonhomie by cheering each song lustily as it ended. Such 
unconsidered applause is about as meaningful as a have-a-nice-day button. 
</P>
<P>
McKay's more intimate, folk-based (and therefore least heeded) songs sounded 
best. Her attempts at husky blues belting rang gratingly false as she abandoned 
control and decorum and raised her voice in a raspy, unflattering growl that 
did little but bid for attention.

THE ENDURING NATURE AND POIGNANCY OF CHEKHOV'S 'THE CHERRY ORCHARD'; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE: THE PLAY HITS HOME FOR ACTRESS LYNN REDGRAVE, DIRECTOR TOM MOORE AND THE 
LA JOLLA PLAYHOUSE ITSELF.

<P>
The proof of the poetry in Anton Chekhov's plays is their durability. Like a 
divining rod, they continue to plunge into the emotional life of everyone who 
touches them, opening up fresh wells of feeling every time. 
</P>
<P>
For director Tom Moore, Chekhov's "The Cherry Orchard," which opened Sunday at 
the La Jolla Playhouse's Mandell Weiss Theatre, is more than a story of a great 
estate that must be sold if a certain sum of money isn't raised by August. He 
stresses the universal story of individual loss. 
</P>
<P>
"The range of the play is so great," Moore said. "It encompasses your entire 
life because it is continually fresh. Whenever you do a production of it, it 
has to do with your life." 
</P>
<P>
Moore looks into the script and sees his own memories: his parents' separation 
when he was 8 and later their deaths -- first his mother's, then his father's. 
</P>
<P>
But, for Lynn Redgrave who stars as Mme. Ranevsky, the stylish and charismatic 
owner of the orchard who must now set her wits to saving it, the play makes her 
think of the loss of her father, Sir Michael Redgrave, who received acclaim for 
his portrayal of Vanya in Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya." 
</P>
<P>
And for theatergoers who have been watching the financial struggles of La Jolla 
Playhouse over the past year, they see the perfect tale to start a season that 
almost didn't happen because of money troubles. Not only does the production, 
like the script, begin in May when the cherry orchard is in bloom, but, just as 
Mme. Ranevsky is desperately trying to raise money, the Playhouse itself, in 
bloom with this play, is still trying to meet its $1-million fund-raising goal 
by June 30. 
</P>
<P>
If the play is about the Playhouse at its most stressed and stretched, it is 
also about what the Playhouse does best: giving top artists a chance to work on 
the projects of their dreams with the artists of their choice. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cherry Orchard" was a dream project for Moore and Redgrave, who have 
wanted both to work together and to work at the Playhouse for years. 
</P>
<P>
For Moore, who directed the long-running hit musical "Grease" and has been 
nominated twice for Tonys (for the Pulitzer Prize-winning " 'night, Mother" and 
"Over Here"), Redgrave's performance was his one good memory from the ill-fated 
TV show "Fridays" he directed and would prefer to forget. 
</P>
<P>
"She's an actress of great depth and range," said Moore. "She's a well-known 
personality who is also capable of hard work, which doesn't necessarily happen 
together. She has a lot of life on stage, and she wants to tackle the hard 
roles. And this is one of them." 
</P>
<P>
He also values her sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of melancholy and ennui in Chekhov, but there is also a lot of 
fun. You suffer, but when you can laugh, you do." 
</P>
<P>
For Redgrave, a frequent face on television ("House Calls" and "Chicken Soup") 
who makes it a point to perform on stage at least once a year, the opportunity 
to work with Moore was an offer she couldn't resist. 
</P>
<P>
"I particularly liked ' 'night, Mother.' And there really aren't many theater 
directors who go out and direct theater anymore." 
</P>
<P>
That, in fact, could have been said of Moore, for whom "The Cherry Orchard" 
will be a return to the stage after four years of directing television shows 
such as "thirtysomething," "L.A. Law," "The Wonder Years" and a variety of 
television movies. 
</P>
<P>
Their schedules didn't coincide until 1985, and it wasn't a Shakespeare piece. 
Redgrave was set to do Anton Chekhov's "The Seagull" in La Jolla, but her 
Broadway run of "Aren't We All?" with Rex Harrison and Claudette Colbert was 
extended, and she had to cancel. She jumped at the opportunity to do "The 
Cherry Orchard," which will be her first Chekhov play. 
</P>
<P>
Redgrave deeply misses her father, who died in 1985. And this play brings her 
closer to him. She says: "I have a great sense of family along with my sister 
and brother, three acting nieces and a student-acting daughter. We all have the 
sense of carrying on a family tradition. I very strongly conjure up before a 
performance a memory of the generations of actors in my family and find 
strength in that." 
</P>
<P>
It was Moore's extreme disappointment over his first Broadway flop, 
"Frankenstein," that allowed him to pour frustration, pain and a feeling of 
vulnerability into Chekhov's "The Three Sisters" at the American Conservatory 
Theatre in San Francisco, which was one of his great successes. 
</P>
<P>
The Cherry Orchard "is much more synthesized," Moore said. "By the time he 
wrote this, he was quite ill. He died six months later. He was writing about 
his own death." 
</P>
<P>
It is that sense that Moore is trying to capture. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't do Chekhov until you've experienced loss and frustration. Our best 
production of Chekhov would be if we all got together just before we died."

LOST YOUR WAY? BLAME IT ON THE BRAIN'S RIGHT SIDE 
</P>

Orange.

<P>
Although Suzanne lived in Kansas City for three years, she had difficulty 
finding her way around town and would often get lost. 
</P>
<P>
"I became turned around the minute I arrived there and never got straightened 
out," said the 40-year-old high school teacher who now lives in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Suzanne, who asked that her last name not be used, has always had difficulty 
with directions. 
</P>
<P>
"Everywhere I've lived, this has been a problem, although I've found some areas 
more confusing than others." 
</P>
<P>
All of us know people who get lost easily. We dismiss them as careless people 
who don't pay attention to where they're going. 
</P>
<P>
Our assumptions are wrong, however. People who are unable to navigate 
themselves have a weakness in the right side of the brain, which is the area 
that controls our sense of visual and spatial orientation, say 
neuropsychologists. 
</P>
<P>
"Topographical orientation problems are caused by a weakness in the visual 
right hemisphere of the brain," said Ida Stolk, a clinical psychologist in 
Tustin who specializes in neuropsychology. 
</P>
<P>
The problem can range from mild to more severe. 
</P>
<P>
"My bias is that everyone has a certain amount of brain dysfunction and that 
accounts for individual differences," said Arnold Purisch, a clinical 
psychologist who directs the Orange County Neuropsychology Group in Irvine. 
"Many people have this problem in varying degrees. There are those who have 
some difficulty navigating and then there are individuals who actually have 
brain damage and can get lost in areas that are well known to them. Most people 
have minimal problems, though." 
</P>
<P>
Individuals who often get lost do so because they easily become spatially 
disoriented. 
</P>
<P>
"When they travel down a street in a new area, they will usually turn left when 
they should turn right and vice versa," Purisch said. "They have to make sure 
they write everything down when they get directions and carefully check out 
maps. Diagrams also cause them problems. If they are going to put something 
together, they often can't understand the diagram and will end up reading the 
verbal directions until they work it out in their minds." 
</P>
<P>
Direction sufferers never aced a geography class, either, although such people 
are often very intelligent. 
</P>
<P>
"It is frustrating," said Suzanne, who tests well in academics and languages. 
"I've often asked myself: 'Why are you not able to find your way around? You're 
an intelligent person. It's not that complicated.' " 
</P>
<P>
Individuals who have this difficulty often have exceptional verbal skills, 
which are regulated by the left hemisphere of the brain. 
</P>
<P>
"The average person has average skills across the board," Purisch said. "But 
when someone has exceptional verbal skills, they often have problems in the 
spatial area." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, people with orientation problems generally succeed in careers such 
as psychology, languages, writing and publishing, and law. 
</P>
<P>
"Law is a perfect example," Purisch said. "It is a purely analytical, verbal 
type of profession." 
</P>
<P>
The problem is rarely seen in people who are successful architects, engineers, 
mechanics or surgeons. Individuals in such professions should be able to look 
at diagrams and know where everything fits. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers aren't sure why one area of the brain becomes weaker than the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
"An injury or brain infection may cause it at some point, but more often than 
not people are born with the weakness," Stolk said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have found that spatial problems sometimes run in families. It could be 
genetic," Purisch said. "There is also the possibility that a trauma occurred 
during pregnancy or birth that created biochemical abnormalities. Or there 
could be subtle structural differences in the brain. But at the moment our 
diagnostic technology isn't advanced enough to determine this." 
</P>
<P>
One theory of early brain dysfunction may explain why some people have a 
weakness in the right hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
"The brain seems to have a preference for developing verbal skills over 
nonverbal ones," Purisch said. "So some of the latter skills may get crowded 
out while the verbal skills develop to a greater extent. This could be what 
happens to people who don't have a sense of direction." 
</P>
<P>
Because having a mild lack of direction is not that critical in our society, 
there is no prescribed method for treating individuals with the problem. 
Experts do have techniques for treating people with more severe spatial 
problems, however, and those can be applied. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult to improve one's inherent sense of spatial appreciation by 
itself," Purisch said. "Generally individuals have to learn how to compensate 
by using their left hemisphere better. They need to use prepositions when 
traveling, which the left hemisphere is so good at using, such as left and 
right and up and down." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of simply noting the billboard near their destination, people with weak 
right hemispheres must become verbally aware of it. They have to acknowledge 
where it is in relation to where they are going. Is it to the left, right or 
behind? They should read the billboard aloud and even spell words. It is 
helpful if as many senses as possible are involved. 
</P>
<P>
Carefully studying maps improves the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"When they go somewhere they've never been before, they should look at a map, 
write out the route and slowly and deliberately practice it over and over," 
Purisch said. "That makes it conscious and verbal, which is very left 
hemisphere." 
</P>
<P>
By using their left hemispheres, people may even strengthen the weak areas of 
their brains, according to Stolk. Computer programs have been developed to 
strengthen the brain. One program created by Psychological Software Services 
Inc. in Indiana shows shapes on the screen momentarily, which then need to be 
recalled by the person using the program. 
</P>
<P>
"This helps a person develop a sense of placement and association," Stolk 
explained. Another test Stolk uses consists of a set of four boards that hold 
nine pegs. One peg on each board is stationary. Testers pull on all of the pegs 
to determine which ones are intact and watch as the boards are placed on top of 
one another. Then they try to indicate which are the stationary pegs. 
Individuals with direction problems will often have difficulty with this, 
especially when boards are rotated. 
</P>
<P>
"I panicked when the boards were turned," Suzanne said. "I couldn't keep track 
of where they were. Once I learned the pattern, it helped, but I still had 
difficulty. It's nice to know, though, there is help for this problem," she 
said. "Although it hasn't caused too much trouble, it has been irritating, and 
I'm glad to know that I'm not crazy."

JOSEPH N. BELL: AT A LECTURE ON POWER, HE LOST THE URGE BEFORE SURGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I've been going through this power thing with my editor and my wife and the 
trash collector and some Republican politicians, among others, so when a friend 
sent me a ticket to a lecture by Anthony Robbins last week, I was instantly 
intrigued. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins, the accompanying publicity told me, has written a "national 
bestseller" called "Unlimited Power," and he was prepared to tell me and anyone 
else who cared to show up at UC Irvine's Bren Center on the evening of May 9 
how to tap into it. 
</P>
<P>
He would also explain how to "DISCOVER keys to Mastery of Excellence," "HEAR 
how to Communicate with Confidence to Anyone," and "EXPERIENCE how to Conquer 
Limiting Fears and Beliefs." 
</P>
<P>
Since I have some problems in all those areas, I went. 
</P>
<P>
So, it turned out, did about 6,000 other people. Even the University of Nevada 
Las Vegas-UCI basketball game has never drawn as many people to the Bren Center 
as Robbins did. I had to outflank the worst traffic jam I've even seen on the 
UCI campus just to get out of my car. 
</P>
<P>
When I finally got into the Bren Center, I was struck instantly with the 
remarkably efficient crowd control exercised by several dozen young men in 
white shirts, ties and walkie-talkies, men who had clearly done this before for 
Robbins Research International -- the blanket name for Robbins' operation. We 
were filtered through a single entrance and given no seating options. The crowd 
was a curious amalgam. About half were men in business suits and women in chic 
dresses, who appeared to have come directly from the office. The rest were a 
mixture of young and old, trim and tacky. There were a lot of couples and 
probably a majority of women. 
</P>
<P>
By way of introduction, we were shown films of several TV news segments done on 
Robbins. The centerpiece is usually Robbins walking barefoot on a bed of hot 
coals, followed by a group of his trainees. I remembered seeing this on 
television but hadn't associated it ahead of time with the evening's program. 
The fire walk has become a kind of trademark for Robbins. He referred to it 
later in the evening as "metaphor for turning fear into power. If you show 
yourself you can walk on hot coals without injury, then you ask: 'What else can 
I do that I didn't think was possible before?' " 
</P>
<P>
He was introduced by his marketing director, and we were asked to stand when he 
appeared. Everyone dutifully did, like greeting visiting royalty. The same kind 
of audience manipulation permeated the evening. Robbins -- a 33-year-old 
dervish of animated movement and old-time-religion fervor, clad impeccably in 
white shirt, tie and jacket -- constantly exhorted the crowd to action. We were 
asked to raise our hands in response to a multitude of questions, massage the 
back of the person next to us, clap our hands, groan, and shout in a kind of 
Messianic heat -- and virtually everyone did. 
</P>
<P>
I have a lot of problems with this sort of things -- which I presume Robbins 
would see as an inhibiting character defect that needs correction. But Robbins' 
enthusiasm and the hunger of most members of the audience for what he was 
offering made them totally malleable to his suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
I'm hard put to summarize what he was offering, but it came off to me as 
Pavlovian show business, Skinner with a Spin -- and I don't mean to be flip. 
Robbins has taken two precepts generally accepted in the scientific community 
-- that we have barely scratched the possibilities of the human mind and that 
one's mental state exerts a profound influence on the physical -- and 
metamorphosed them into a system called Neuro Linguistics Programming (NLP). 
</P>
<P>
This appears to contain generous elements of Skinner's behaviorism, positive 
thinking, Christian Science, physiology, "The Little Engine That Could" and an 
especially heavy dose of a technique called modeling. Developed by 
psychotherapists Richard Bandler and John Grinder, successful modeling can 
systematically produce the same behavior in a subject as the person being 
modeled. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins combined an intensive study of these techniques with a driving need to 
be successful and the growing skills of a professional entertainer to create 
his company. Over the past decade, he has built up an imposing list of people 
-- some quite well known -- who say their lives have been changed by his 
teaching. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins' performance at the Bren Center alternated between lecture, jiving with 
the audience and demonstration. He asked people to tell him their fears and 
went through a great many before a young woman said she was afraid of animals. 
Then he asked if there was an animal in the audience, and lo and behold, 
someone had a seeing-eye dog. So he brought the dog and the fearful lady to the 
platform and went through 20 minutes of hand manipulation, what to me was 
totally incoherent talk, and exhortation that ended, finally, with the woman 
petting the dog. Maybe he changed a lifelong phobia or maybe she just wanted to 
get off the platform. I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
He repeatedly returned to the theme -- scarcely new -- that all of our behavior 
is conditioned by fear, and by neutralizing the fear, we can open up new vistas 
of living. He pointed out that we all say we would like to make more money, but 
subconsciously part of our brain is saying that more money might bring pain. 
</P>
<P>
"So we have a mixed association in the nervous system as to what money means," 
he explained. "The ability to do anything grows out of one's ability to control 
the nervous system. Your state of mind changes your body's chemistry." 
</P>
<P>
Although there was a lot of talk about money, it took him 90 minutes to get 
into his own commercial. He pointed out that we could take what he said tonight 
or read his book and put NLP into practice. But the system works much better 
with teaching and supervision. I didn't get the full significance of that until 
I left early. 
</P>
<P>
Almost two hours into the program, Robbins was still going strong, and I was 
giving out. He had promised to tell us the four areas we must master to change 
the quality of our lives but then got sidetracked, and I couldn't wait. I 
presume he got to them since the auditorium still hadn't emptied as I drove 
past it on my way home. 
</P>
<P>
As I departed the Bren Center, several rows of tables had been moved into the 
lobby. The person in charge of each table was identified by a prominent name 
card. I asked one young woman what they were up to, and she said they were 
signing up students for an "Unlimited Power Weekend" to be held at Bren on June 
8 to 11. It would normally cost $895, she explained, but if I signed up 
tonight, I could get $200 off. Each table had a credit-card machine to expedite 
the sign-ups. Since I can't pass those crucial areas we need to master along to 
you, I guess you'll have to enroll at the Power Weekend to find out -- or 
perhaps ask someone whose staying power that evening was greater than mine. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think I'll attend the Power Weekend. The first day ends in a fire walk, 
and I have this gnawing fear that if it didn't work, I wouldn't be able to play 
tennis for a month. So I guess I'll look for my metaphors in a less risky 
place. After all, Jesus refused to throw himself off that mountain to prove his 
powers to doubters, and that's still good enough for me.

BENEFIT BOASTS FASHIONS, MARGARITAS

Bumper-to-bumper Benzes jostled Jags in the parking lot on Friday as 710 ladies 
who lunch, dress up, and donate homed in on the huge tent parked next to 
couturier Amen Wardy's Newport Beach boutique. 
</P>
<P>
Here came the county's distaff who's who -- in summer suits and showy hats, 
jewels a-jangling -- for the fourth annual Angelitos de Oro fashion show 
fund-raiser for Big Brothers/Big Sisters of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The $150-per-person benefit luncheon raised $150,000. Receiving a cardboard 
photo-opportunity-size check -- as tall as its recipient -- Jo Alexander 
smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to catch my breath," said Alexander, executive director of Big 
Brothers. Then she turned and lugged the check offstage. 
</P>
<P>
Before her appearance on the bright white stage -- soon to be dominated by 
hip-thrusting models draped in Bill Blass togs -- Alexander nibbled the healthy 
grilled chicken, shrimp and mixed greens lunch with table mates that included 
her granddaughters, Kristine and Lisa Spurney, and Sharon Ormsbee, president of 
the support group. 
</P>
<P>
The party started when guests were met by a small army of valets outside 
Wardy's mirrored dress shop. Through the maze-like store the ladies went, 
exiting into a sunny courtyard where a bartender blended strawberry margaritas 
and servers circled with trays of mineral water and Chardonnay. The air buzzed 
with the sound of a mariachi quartet's harmonies. 
</P>
<P>
"Amen has been pushing for mariachis for years," said Donna Devine, chairwoman 
of the event. "We loved the idea, so we picked up on it." 
</P>
<P>
Pinata-colored decorations gave the tented lunchroom the look of a garden in 
bloom. Orange, green and yellow swaths of fabric were draped overhead like 
crisscrossed tightropes; the many tables fanned out from the runway were 
covered in pink, turquoise, orange and green. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Rabbitt of Newport Beach thumbed through a copy of the "Gold Book" -- a 
magazine-size ad book put together in conjunction with the benefit -- with her 
sister, Melanie Maxon. Rabbitt, editor of this year's Gold Book, said she and 
her committee sold close to 200 ads at prices ranging from $50 to $3,000, 
contributing about $30,000 to the net proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
As for the fashions in the pricey store and the Blass on leggy display, Rabbitt 
laughed. "I couldn't afford any of that stuff," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jo Anne Mix, on the other hand, said she would probably buy something, "but I 
don't want to break the bank. I have a top price and I won't buy anything more 
than that, unless it's a real investment, like a good suit, or if I have to 
have it." 
</P>
<P>
Big Brothers/Big Sisters is a national nonprofit agency that matches children 
from single parent homes with men, women and couples who schedule weekly 
outings with their young charges to provide friendship and role model 
companionship. 
</P>
<P>
Among guests were Melinda Moiso, Sandy Sewell, Peggy Hakes, Judie Argyros, 
Deeann Baldwin, Shirlee Guggenheim (whose husband, Robert, was the first 
president of the local chapter of Big Brothers/Big Sisters) and Maria Crutcher, 
a friend of Amen Wardy and chairwoman of the past three Angelitos fashion 
shows.

PASSENGER TRAFFIC AT AIRPORT FALLS 5%

<P>
Passenger traffic at John Wayne Airport was down more than 5% for the first 
four months of this year, according to statistics released yesterday by airport 
officials, who attributed the decline to cutbacks in service by American 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
American, which is the airport's largest carrier, reduced its number of flights 
to San Francisco from eight to 10 a day to two and three a day, airport 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the main reason for the decrease in our passenger traffic," said Karen 
L. Robertson, an official in the airport's noise abatement office. 
</P>
<P>
According to figures supplied by the airport, the total number of passengers 
using the facility dropped from 1.41 million during the first four months of 
last year to 1.34 million during the same period this year. 
</P>
<P>
Although American Airlines officials declined to provide specifics about their 
reduced passenger loads, they agreed that the airline's flight reductions could 
account for most of John Wayne's drop-off in traffic. JIM NEWTON

POP MUSIC: THE SUCCESS OF ALBUMS BY SUCH ACTS AS M. C. HAMMER AND SINEAD 
O'CONNOR IS PART OF A LARGER BREAKTHROUGH THAT INDICATES INCREASING ACCEPTANCE 
OF FRESH FACES AMONG FANS AND RADIO PROGRAMMERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
There's been a change on the pop music charts. The old reliable superstars that 
have in recent years been the anchors of pop sales are having to make room for 
new faces and new styles. 
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic examples involve the success of Irish singer Sinead O'Connor, 
whose "I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got" is entering its fifth week as the 
nation's best-selling album, and the finally indisputable arrival of rap, which 
had been viewed for nearly a decade by the record industry as little more than 
a passing fad. 
</P>
<P>
The success of albums by such rap acts as M. C. Hammer and Public Enemy is also 
part of a larger breakthrough of new acts that indicates increasing acceptance 
of new faces among pop music fans and radio programmers. 
</P>
<P>
Though individual rap acts, including Run-DMC and the Beastie Boys, have had 
platinum albums in the past, the new rush of rap best-sellers has caught the 
industry by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was scared of rap," said Michael Martin, music director of Los 
Angeles radio station KIIS-FM (102.7). "But rap is unavoidable. When you have 
people like M. C. Hammer (having big hits), people have to stop closing their 
ears." 
</P>
<P>
Concurred Al Tavera, Martin's counterpart at KPWR-FM (105.9): "It's amazing how 
well rap is doing with adults as well as kids. That's a trend I see changing. I 
think the audience is accepting (rap) more than a few years ago." 
</P>
<P>
A check of the Billboard pop albums chart confirms this. Hammer's "Please 
Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em" album, with sales at about 2 million, is pushing 
O'Connor for the No. 1 spot and is joined in the top dozen albums by the 
rap-influenced Bell Biv Devoe's "Poison" at No. 9 and Public Enemy's 
controversial "Fear of a Black Planet" at No. 11. 
</P>
<P>
The Top 15 singles include the title cut from the Bell Biv Devoe album at No. 
8, Digital Underground's "Humpty Dance" at No. 14 and Hammer's "U Can't Touch 
This" at No. 15. 
</P>
<P>
"We never expected something like 'Humpty Dance' to work like that," said 
Tavera. "We thought it would be a nice underground record, but it turned into a 
major pop single." 
</P>
<P>
But rap's not alone in bringing new vitality to the sales charts, which -- 
except for occasional breakthroughs such as Paula Abdul and Soul II Soul -- 
were chiefly the domain in recent years of veteran superstars. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor is joined in the Top 12 albums this week by Depeche Mode, which was 
formerly considered a cult band, and rookie Lisa Stansfield. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems the major superstar acts are taking the safe route, coming out with 
very formula songs," said Martin. "Radio listeners take a more aggressive 
stance, which is where the new names are coming out. Not that (listeners) don't 
like hearing Phil Collins or Michael Bolton any more, but in between they like 
hearing the M. C. Hammers and Bell Biv Devoes and Digital Undergrounds that are 
crossing over to become hits." 
</P>
<P>
The irony is that rap's success has a lot to do with its reliance on the 
familiar. Hammer's hit, for instance, is built on a sampled bass line from Rick 
James' 1980 hit "Super Freak." 
</P>
<P>
"Half the people don't know they're hearing M. C. Hammer," said Martin. "We get 
people calling asking, 'Would you play "Super Freak," but the one with the rap 
in it?' " 
</P>
<P>
But the success of rap goes beyond that, as evidenced by the Public Enemy 
album, an angry black power statement that has had a lot of media attention, 
but virtually no radio play outside of the nation's few specifically 
rap-oriented stations. That, say some industry observers, proves the legitimacy 
of the form, dismissing the notion that the album is selling largely on the 
strength of the critical debate it has stirred. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think people run out and buy things just because they're 
controversial," said Warner Bros. senior vice president and director of sales 
Lou Dennis. "You've got to like what you're buying. Your curiosity might get 
you, but it's not like the old days when they used to ban a book in Boston and 
then everybody would try to buy it. I think people are reacting to the Public 
Enemy album because it's saying something they want to say." 
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the best-selling newcomers these days is no accident, suggest 
representatives of record companies and retail outlets. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing our business has determined is that you have to have stars of 
tomorrow," said Lou Mann, vice president of sales at Capitol Records, whose 
roster includes both new-guard chart-topper Hammer and old-guard Heart, whose 
new album is currently No. 3. "There has been an emphasis for the last 18 
months on developing new talent and we're starting to see the fruits." 
</P>
<P>
Mitch Perliss, director of purchasing for Show Industries, the parent company 
of the 75-store Music Plus chain, says that he hasn't seen any increase of 
sales, but he is seeing better quality sales, i.e. the same customers seeking 
wider variety than before. 
</P>
<P>
"It's refreshing," he said. "Our feeling is you have to have the (reliable) 
sales base of a Phil Collins or Michael Jackson or Rolling Stones. But in my 
mind, the whole business is new artists, developing new artists that have 
longevity. . . . What we need to do is not just have a Phil Collins buyer come 
in when he has a new release, but turn that buyer on to something else he or 
she might also enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind record companies and retailers have been working together on 
aggressive campaigns to expose new acts, such as offering money-back guarantees 
on selected releases and not giving up on promising records even if initial 
sales are disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
Said Capitol's Lou Mann: "It used to be you'd throw new product out there and 
try to get it played (on radio) and if you couldn't in six weeks, you dropped 
it. Now radio play is just one spoke in the wheel. If it doesn't work you've 
got other areas to go to."

THE ONE-MAN VARIETY SHOW NAMED SAMMY DAVIS JR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There have been a lot of balladeers, a lot of dancers, a lot of clowns, a lot 
of mimics, a lot of actors who could do both comedy and the heavy stuff. But no 
one comes to mind who was all of those talents to such a superlative degree as 
Sammy Davis Jr., who on Wednesday lost his brave battle with throat cancer. 
</P>
<P>
He was a one-man variety show, every act on the damnedest vaudeville bill 
anybody ever watched. He was all the floats in the big parade, a cast of 
hundreds (it sometimes seemed) contained in one slight frame that had to be 
composed entirely of pure genius and pure energy. 
</P>
<P>
It was not just that Sammy Davis Jr. could do so many different things; it was 
that he did them all so amazingly well. In the space of half an hour he could 
make you think of everybody from Bojangles Robinson and Al Jolson to Nat Cole, 
to cite only a few from a whole galaxy of audience-holding entertainers whose 
equal he was. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of the '60s, one of the best reasons anybody had for going to Las 
Vegas was to catch what came to be called the Rat Pack: Frank Sinatra, Dean 
Martin, Peter Lawford and Sammy. Their appearance at the Sands Hotel was the 
toughest ticket in town. 
</P>
<P>
Considered historically, it might be that their high jinks and their heavy 
joshing would be found a bit self-indulgent and even self-conscious, a kind of 
every-night boys' night out. But the saving grace was that Frank and Dean and 
Sammy were talented and charismatic performers who, as ballplayers say of a 
fast pitcher, could really bring it. If there was anything to forgive, you 
forgave it when the singing started. 
</P>
<P>
Sammy's role was as the mascot of the group, and the kidding was (so my own 
memory says) not always comfortable for the audience and possibly not always 
comfortable for him. But the role was also a bit of a disguise, like the rube 
who turns out to be the real pool shark. When the stage was his, he knocked the 
audience sideways, and it became wonderfully clear that the honors, talentwise, 
were equally divided up there. 
</P>
<P>
(It's hard now to remember exactly what Lawford's function was in the 
free-for-alls: a kind of bemused charm, I guess. The sadness about him was yet 
to come.) 
</P>
<P>
The gifts and the magical stage presence that Sammy Davis Jr. had were honed 
and polished in a hard school that began for him at an age when most of his 
contemporaries were still wearing diapers at night. As he wrote in a couple of 
notably candid and moving autobiographies, he spent years trouping when a good 
audience was one that let you get off stage uninjured; years when, talented or 
not, he was handcuffed to Jim Crow. 
</P>
<P>
Even in Las Vegas in the times of his first triumphs, the color line separated 
the stage from the lounges and the tables like an iron curtain, to keep the 
high-rollers content. Over there in Las Vegas, and among black entertainers, 
one of the things Davis will be remembered for most gratefully was his role 
(with Sinatra's help) in breaking down the color line. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to his own candor about himself, Davis' life was widely known to be a 
kind of cautionary tale, a three-act play divided into the rise to fame, the 
costs of fame and, at last, the rewards of fame. He left no doubt that he 
hadn't handled success well. He had worked hard and for a time he enjoyed hard, 
making a mess of things until he got his act together again (with some 
chastening help from Sinatra). 
</P>
<P>
What kind of fool was he? His own kind, but the point the world could note at 
last was that he stopped playing the fool and revealed the strength that had 
got him past all the earlier hazards, including the wreck that cost him an eye 
and nearly his life. 
</P>
<P>
The rallying around him when he fell ill said a good deal about Sammy Davis Jr. 
His talent had spoken for itself; his kindness and his humanity revealed 
themselves in the loyalty of his friends.

THE MAN WHO GAVE SOUL TO THE MUPPETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Catapulted to fame by "Sesame Street," Muppet creator Jim Henson, who died 
Wednesday at age 53 in New York of a massive bacterial infection, left behind a 
dynasty of remarkable foam-and-wire creations -- Kermit the Frog, Fozzie Bear, 
Miss Piggy and Big Bird among them -- that live on with a beguiling independent 
reality of their own. 
</P>
<P>
The flamboyant vanity of Miss Piggy ("Moi?"), the endearing greed of Cookie 
Monster, the shy sweetness of Big Bird and Kermit's bemused voice of reason are 
familiar to audiences worldwide through television, films, records, books, 
toys, computer software, clothing and other Muppet merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
More significant than the marketing bonanza it became, was the fact that the 
special world of the Muppets offered a haven to children growing up in an 
increasingly troubled era, a haven where reading and numbers were fun, a haven 
without peer pressure or violence or drug dealers. Parents encouraged their 
children to walk down "Sesame Street" or soar with "Pigs in Space," secure in 
the knowledge that no harm would befall them. 
</P>
<P>
Although the characters will survive, the sorrow is that their future will lack 
the guiding hand of their gentle creator. 
</P>
<P>
Henson's genius flowered in his original exploitation of television as a visual 
medium. Earlier television shows with human and puppet characters, such as 
"Kukla, Fran and Ollie," were set up like little theater performances, with a 
human host and puppeteers behind a curtain. 
</P>
<P>
Henson created interaction between humans and Muppets -- his term for a cross 
between puppets and marionettes -- with complex, three-dimensional settings and 
crew members concealed in trenches or behind walls. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of seeing a human simply talking to a puppet, viewers were offered a 
new dimension, one where Muppets were firmly in control and human visitors had 
to cope with the eccentric surroundings as best they could. 
</P>
<P>
Muppets could appear above, below, behind or in front of their human guests. 
The effects wouldn't have worked for a live audience -- the scaffolding would 
have been visible and the cameras would have gotten in the way -- but the 
results were spectacular to home viewers. 
</P>
<P>
Without their endearing, humorous, all-too-human characteristics, however, the 
Muppets would have been just another technological surprise, to be exclaimed 
over and then dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Henson gave them more than technical life; he gave them soul. Sweet, petty, 
crusty, jealous, greedy, grumpy, wise and funny, each possessed an 
individuality with which their human counterparts could identify. 
</P>
<P>
And identify they did. Henson's Muppets became a merchandising and media 
phenomena, second only to Disney characters in their instant visual identity. 
Last year, Kermit and Mickey Mouse became a mega-team, when Henson's production 
company and the rights to his Muppet characters were purchased by the Walt 
Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
Henson's stunning artistic and commercial success were light years away from 
his high school puppet club days and a career that began in the '50s with "Sam 
and Friends," a local puppet show on a television station in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
That show, the first major outing for Kermit the Frog, won an Emmy in 1958. 
Quirky guest appearances on "The Ed Sullivan Show," "The Tonight Show" and "The 
Jimmy Dean Show" followed. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1969, came "Sesame Street," and Henson's Muppet dynasty proliferated 
with instantly appealing blue and green monsters, shaggy dogs and round-headed, 
goggly-eyed creations, helping millions of children learn letters, numbers and 
social skills.

The first generation of "Sesame Street" viewers are now watching Oscar the 
Grouch and Bert and Ernie with their own toddlers. (This is the second major 
creative loss for "Sesame Street." Joe Raposo, its remarkable composer and 
musical director, died last year.) 
</P>
<P>
But Henson wanted to reach a wider audience, and "The Muppet Show," a 
star-studded variety program, premiered in London in 1976, before moving to the 
United States. Feature-length movies came later, and still more television 
series -- "Fraggle Rock"; "The Jim Henson Hour," an innovative mix of live 
action, computer graphics and puppetry; the Saturday morning cartoon "Muppet 
Babies"; and the HBO music appreciation series, "The Ghost of Faffner Hall." 
</P>
<P>
Not all brought commercial success -- the movies "Labyrinth" and "The Dark 
Crystal" didn't do well -- but Henson's fantastic creations continued to earn 
wide-eyed raves. 
</P>
<P>
Kermit the Frog, the reasonable mediator, frequently perplexed by an 
unreasonable world, was often referred to as the soft-spoken Henson's alter-ego 
(he was one of Henson's earliest creations and Henson supplied his voice). 
Henson, who preferred staying out of the limelight, denied that his 
award-winning creations spoke for him. In a 1984 Times interview, he said, 
"They don't do or say things I wouldn't otherwise do or say. I don't see myself 
as a repressed person hiding behind the characters." 
</P>
<P>
Yet during that interview, Henson only became voluble when he spoke as Kermit. 
To a little green frog, the spotlight was a warm and wonderful place to be.

ROBERTO BEDOYA: A NEW FACE AT LACE -- AND A NEW DIRECTION; 
</P>
<P>
THE ARTS: DIRECTOR OF L.A. CONTEMPORARY EXHIBITIONS WILL EXPAND THE PROGRAM TO 
INCLUDE 'MORE PEOPLE OF COLOR.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

"I think my appointment is really a signal," said Roberto Bedoya, the new 
executive director of Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions, during his first 
day on the job. "It's no longer a Euro-centric world, or a Euro-centric Los 
Angeles, and LACE has been behind in recognizing that. I think my appointment 
says, 'Here is Roberto Bedoya, a person in charge of a multidisciplinary arts 
organization, and he's a person of color.' " 
</P>
<P>
Bedoya, 38, a native Northern Californian of Mexican descent, began his new 
post on a part-time basis May 3, and will take over full time June 1. He comes 
to LACE from the similarly programmed but smaller-budgeted Intersection for the 
Arts in San Francisco, where he was managing director and literary programmer 
for more than eight years. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's remarkable that as a Chicano, I'm the head of an arts 
organization that is not ethnic-run," Bedoya said. "I'm part of an organization 
that's redefining a little bit, and . . . my appointment will mean expanding 
the program to include more people of color." 
</P>
<P>
Bedoya was chosen after a nearly three-month search to replace former executive 
director Joy Silverman, who resigned Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Walker, a former president of LACE's board of directors, and the interim 
acting director, acknowledged that there was truth to Bedoya's claims that his 
ethnicity was a determining factor. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a person of color was a real consideration for the board with what's 
happening in L.A.," said Walker, noting of that the four final applicants 
interviewed for the position, two were of non-European descent. "We are aware 
of being a very white organization and of addressing that need." 
</P>
<P>
Walker noted that on LACE's present board of directors, for instance, only two 
of 16 members are non-white. But, he said the board would like to change that 
factor when it fills its six vacancies, a matter in which Bedoya will have "a 
strong voice." 
</P>
<P>
"It has to do with giving more people access to the organization," Bedoya said, 
noting that bringing more multicultural representation to both the board and 
LACE's various programing committees, is a major goal. "If you want to have 
more (multicultural artists) represented in your programing, you do that by 
putting their peers in decision-making positions. . . . I think that's what 
(LACE's board of directors) were acknowledging in appointing me." 
</P>
<P>
Multicultural representation is not the only first that Bedoya brings to his 
position. He is also the first non-visual artist to run LACE, which consists of 
a fairly large gallery, performance space, video screening room and bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
But while Bedoya may differ from past LACE directors in terms of his ethnicity 
and background, he says he plans to maintain the strong advocacy position LACE 
was known for under Silverman, who was a founder of the L.A.-based Coalition 
for the Freedom of Expression and who left LACE to do arts advocacy work on a 
national basis. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be actively involved in defending our rights for freedom of 
expression," Bedoya said. "That's not going to change." 
</P>
<P>
Bedoya noted that through his work as president of the National Assn. of 
Artists Organizations, he has already "been actively involved in advocacy work, 
and I plan to remain so."

CBS PULLS PLUG ON 'FALCON CREST,' 2 OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, TIMES TELEVISION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the most successful soap operas in the history of TV, CBS' "Falcon 
Crest," comes to an end tonight at 9 after a nine-season run. 
</P>
<P>
In the early and mid-1980s, "Falcon Crest," which starred Jane Wyman in a tale 
set in the Napa Valley wine country near San Francisco, ranked among the Top 
10-rated shows for three consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
It was the period of prime-time soap opera's greatest success, with such series 
as "Dallas" and "Dynasty" dominating the field and "Knots Landing" also a 
strong finisher. 
</P>
<P>
CBS also yanked two other series Wednesday -- "City," a Valerie Harper sitcom, 
and "The Famous Teddy Z," a comedy about a young talent agent -- after both 
shows registered disastrous ratings Saturday when paired for the first time 
against NBC's powerful tandem of "The Golden Girls" and "Empty Nest." 
</P>
<P>
"City" and "The Famous Teddy Z" will be replaced effective this Saturday by 
reruns of the Vietnam War drama "Tour of Duty," which earned double the ratings 
of the two comedies in the same time slot before winding up its season. "Tour 
of Duty" is awaiting a decision on whether it will be renewed for next season. 
</P>
<P>
CBS' decision to cancel "Falcon Crest," which was down to 19% of the audience 
this season, came as the network -- on a surprising rebound this month -- 
focused in on its new lineup for fall, soon to be announced. "Dallas" has also 
slipped sharply, although "Knots Landing" remains a relative success. 
</P>
<P>
In another series change, Fox TV's "The Tracey Ullman Show," which tied for 
89th place in last week's ratings with "The Famous Teddy Z," became the second 
quality series to depart the fledgling network. Ullman's innovative variety 
program, which gave Fox its first Emmy Awards but drew low ratings, followed 
"It's Garry Shandling's Show" in bowing out after its fourth season. 
</P>
<P>
"I thank Fox for letting someone no one ever heard of do a show on a network 
that didn't exist," Ullman said. "Well, it certainly does exist now and I am 
proud to have helped give it credibility." 
</P>
<P>
In last week's ratings, "City" ranked last among 91 shows, drawing only 6% of 
the audience, and "The Famous Teddy Z" was 89th, with 7%. "Tour of Duty," which 
previously fared respectably against TV blockbusters such as "The Cosby Show" 
and "Roseanne," attracted 13% of the national audience this season in 
competition with "The Golden Girls" and "Empty Nest."

Chocolate Contest -- A caption appearing in the May 3 Food section incorrectly 
named the winners of a truffle contest held during the Chocolate Weekend at Le 
Meridien in Newport Beach. According to Josseline Tamers of the hotel: "The 
confection picturing Newport Beach Marina is the work of Yvan Valentin of 
L'Orangerie in Los Angeles. The French chef received the top prize of $300 
along with Russell Armstrong of Trees restaurant in Corona del Mar, who also

<P>
The son of actor Marlon Brando was arrested on suspicion of murder this morning 
after the boyfriend of the actor's daughter was found shot to death at the 
elegant Brando estate overlooking Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Christian Brando, 32, told them that he fired a single pistol shot 
into the head of Dag Dorllet, 26, about 10:40 p.m. Wednesday after accusing 
Dorllet of beating 20-year-old Cheyenne Brando, who is pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
According to the family, the abuse took place shortly before the murder and 
apparently was not part of a sustained pattern of mistreatment, police said. 
Detectives said the young woman is not believed to be seriously hurt and bore 
no signs of injury. They did not say how soon the baby is expected or who the 
father is. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not sure Christian was totally sober, but it doesn't appear to be some 
sort of drink fest," said Lt. Ron Hall, commander of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's West Los Angeles Division. "There were definitely no drugs." 
</P>
<P>
The reclusive, 66-year-old actor, his wife, Tarita Tariipia and Cheyenne Brando 
were all in the home at the time of the slaying and all heard the fatal shot, 
but none actually witnessed the shooting, according to Hall. The lieutenant 
said there were no other people in the home when the shooting occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Marlon Brando used the 911 emergency number to phone police about five minutes 
after the shooting, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
Hall said that arriving police units recovered the weapon involved, a 
.45-caliber semiautomatic pistol, along with a shotgun, a .44-caliber carbine 
and two unregistered fully automatic firearms -- an Uzi submachine gun and an 
M-14 rifle. 
</P>
<P>
"Christian has indicated that he was a gun enthusiast," Hall said, "but he has 
not given any other reason for why he had the weapons." 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred in the den of the Brando home, while the Academy 
Award-winning actor, his wife and daughter were in other parts of the 12-room 
house, according to Hall. The police lieutenant said the suspect and the other 
members of the Brando family all waited in the home until police arrived, "and 
everyone, including Christian, was cooperative." 
</P>
<P>
Brando's house is part of a sprawling, three-home complex on a two-acre site 
atop the Santa Monica Mountains, a few hundred yards west of Coldwater Canyon. 
The two other houses on the property belong to actor Jack Nicholson, according 
to property tax records. It was not known whether Nicholson was there when the 
shooting took place. 
</P>
<P>
A tall, wrought-iron fence surrounds the secluded, heavily wooded complex. None 
of the houses are visible from the street. The gate giving access to the single 
driveway leading to the three homes is topped with a concertina spiral of 
barbed razor wire. 
</P>
<P>
The complex earned notoriety in 1977 when director Roman Polanski was arrested 
and charged with having unlawful sexual intercourse at one of the Nicholson 
homes with a 13-year-old girl. Nicholson was away on vacation at the time. 
Polanski pleaded guilty to the charge but fled the country to avoid sentencing 
in 1978. He has never returned. 
</P>
<P>
Hall said his detectives learned during interviews with the Brando family at 
their home early today that Dorllet had maintained "a romantic relationship" 
with Cheyenne Brando "for some time" and had been staying in the Brando home 
since arriving here from Tahiti about 10 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
Hall said that -- like the actor's wife, Tarita, who co-starred with him in 
their remake of the film, "Mutiny on The Bounty" -- the slain man was of 
Pacific Island extraction. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they did not know Dorllet's occupation. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Brando was booked at the West Los Angeles station on suspicion of 
murder, and police said additional charges may be filed in connection with the 
automatic weapons. He was ordered held without bail. Arraignment is not 
expected until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
William Kunstler, a noted '60s-era civil rights attorney who has long been a 
friend of Marlon Brando, said he will be representing Christian Brando, along 
with Los Angeles lawyers Barry Litt and Daniel Stormer. 
</P>
<P>
Kunstler told the Associated Press in New York that a "distraught" Marlon 
Brando called him early today and asked him to take the case. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect listed his occupation as "self-employed welder." Police said the 
welding reportedly consisted primarily of fabricating metal sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect is the son of Marlon Brando and Anna Kashfi, the actor's first 
wife. She divorced the actor in 1959, and for the next six years, the two of 
them waged an ugly, accusatory legal battle over their son, with the actor 
finally being granted custody in 1965. Kashfi was remarried in 1974 to Los 
Angeles businessman James Hannaford.

A former top aide to ex-Sen. Joseph Montoya pleaded guilty today to one felony 
count of lying on a home loan application, as prosecutors dismissed four 
corruption charges stemming from the FBI's undercover probe of the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
Amiel Jaramillo, 36, entered the plea before U.S. District Judge Milton 
Schwartz, who set sentencing for July 26. 
</P>
<P>
Jaramillo pleaded guilty to concealing debts totaling $18,000 in outstanding 
student loans in a February, 1987, home loan application to the Veterans 
Administration. The loan was later approved. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said the count on which Jaramillo pleaded guilty was a new charge 
not related to the Montoya case. It carries a penalty of up to five years in 
prison and a $250,000 fine.

The Soviet Union has presented medals to President Bush's son, Jeb Bush, and 
grandson, George P. Bush, for helping victims of the December, 1988, earthquake 
in Armenia, the White House announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Medals and certificates of appreciation were given to the two Bushes by Soviet 
Ambassador Yuri Dubinin at the White House earlier this week.

Jeb Bush, 37, and George P. Bush, 14, were among the volunteers who accompanied 
a relief airlift to Armenia two weeks after the quake. The airlift brought 
100,000 pounds of medicine, clothing and other supplies to earthquake victims.

An international commission today urged nations that oppose the forced 
repatriation of Vietnamese boat people to establish and finance refugee centers 
on their own soil. 
</P>
<P>
One delegate said the call was aimed at countries like the United States, which 
has condemned Hong Kong for sending back Vietnamese refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Thailand and Malaysia sponsored the statement, which was released at the 
opening session of a conference of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees 
committee on Indochinese refugees. 
</P>
<P>
The statement was endorsed by all delegations except the United States and 
Norway, which expressed reservations, conference sources said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Norwegian representatives believe that the statement should have 
accentuated positive developments, like a decrease in the numbers leaving 
Vietnam, said Herman Laurel, a member of the Philippine delegation. 
</P>
<P>
"This is mostly directed at the U.S. and Vietnam," he said, adding that Asian 
nations "took the initiative out of their frustration on the continuing 
problem" of Indochinese who leave for economic and not political reasons. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the British government announced that it had suggested that the 
United States take 9,000 Vietnamese boat people from Hong Kong and house them 
in a special camp, possibly on the American island of Guam. 
</P>
<P>
In the statement, so-called "countries of temporary refuge" -- those where boat 
people land first -- urged Vietnam to take effective measures to prevent its 
people from leaving their homeland illegally. 
</P>
<P>
The statement said the repatriation of those not considered political refugees 
was needed to prevent Asian nations from being flooded with Indochinese who do 
not qualify for settlement in the United States or other third countries. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an obligation on any country which opposes the repatriation of 
non-refugees who do not volunteer (to return home) to offer an effective 
intermediate solution, such as the setting up and financing on its own 
territory a regional holding center for all non-refugees," the statement said.

In testimony before a House telecommunications subcommittee, he said the trip

DOW RESUMES ITS RALLY, GAINS ANOTHER 12.03

<P>
The stock market pushed ahead to new highs today, resuming its recent rally. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had slipped 2.77 on Wednesday, 
rose 12.03 to 2,831.71. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 825 up, 658 down and 490 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 164.77 million shares, against 159.81 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index gained .35 to 193.49. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the gains came early in the session, encouraged by a brief drop in 
open-market interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
As the day passed, however, rates turned higher. Yields on long-term government 
bonds climbed to the 8.65%-8.69% range. 
</P>
<P>
In the economic news, the Commere Department reported that the nation's trade 
deficit increased to $8.45 billion in March from a 6 1/2-year low of $6.10 
billion the month before. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers said the latest figure, although larger than expected, didn't 
significantly discourage the belief that the United States has been gradually 
improving its competitive position of late in world markets. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury bond prices firmed slightly today in moderate early trading 
despite a government report showing a larger-than-expected March trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The bellwether 30-year bond was up around 1/8 point by midday, or $1.25 per 
$1,000 face amount, after losing around $1.50 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Its yield, which moves inversely to the price, slipped to 8.61% from 8.63% late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said bond traders generally shrugged off today's Commerce 
Department report on the March trade shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
Although most economists had been predicting a March deficit of around $7.5 
billion, "it didn't seem the numbers were that negative," said Elizabeth 
Reiners, a vice president and economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
She said the market sentiment is that the trade gap will eventually improve 
this quarter because of the dollar's recent decline in foreign exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Bond traders are concerned about the trade figures because they can often 
influence the dollar. When the trade gap widens, the dollar sometimes falls, 
thereby hurting the value of dollar-denominated securities like bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Adding an early boost to bond prices today was speculation that the Federal 
Reserve might be easing its credit stance a bit, but when the Fed failed to 
take any action today, prices retreated slightly, Reiners said. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
rose between 1/16 point and 1/8 point, intermediate maturities rose around 3/16 
point and long-term issues were up around 1/8 point, according to the Telerate 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer, 
rose 1.87 to 1,150.85.

A Philadelphia businessman who asked his secretary to scout for good-looking 
women at a local pub and then call him on a beeper to tell him of his prospects 
is a dubious "winner" in a national bosses' contest. 
</P>
<P>
Other bad and "downright unbelievable" bosses included a New York supervisor 
who followed female employees to the restroom and stood outside to time them. 
</P>
<P>
A boss at a brokerage firm in Cleveland was awarded a special "boss-felon" 
award for holding "forgery contests" among secretaries to see who could best 
forge clients' signatures on stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
A boss in Gaylord, Minn., "won" for discriminating against pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
The contest, sponsored by a Cleveland support group for clerical workers called 
9to5, National Assn. of Working Women, also honored "good" bosses. 
</P>
<P>
Those included the president of a computer services firm in Birmingham, Ala., 
for progressive family leave policies; a department chairman at Hofstra 
University in Hempstead, N.Y., for advocating pay raises, and the chairman of 
Northwest Airlines for making company employees "feel like an asset to the 
airline." 
</P>
<P>
A Philadelphia secretary who nominated her boss said she was asked "to go to a 
'beef &amp; beer' " to check out women before he entered. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me to beep him if there was anyone good-looking in the bar so he 
wouldn't waste his time," the woman wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Another bad boss was nominated by a state worker in Madison, Wis., whose mother 
had to be rushed to the hospital. The next day, the worker asked for the 
afternoon off to visit her. 
</P>
<P>
"Well . . . go ahead. But next time you should plan these things better," the 
boss responded. 
</P>
<P>
The manager of an insurance company in Boulder, Colo., also "won" for yelling 
at a female worker to bring coffee and adding, "You squaw; me chief."

JUDGE DISMISSES 180 TAX COUNTS AGAINST LEONA

<P>
A state judge today dismissed nearly all of a 188-count state tax fraud 
indictment against hotel queen Leona Helmsley, saying the charges constituted 
double jeopardy because of her federal tax conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Helmsley, 70, was not satisfied, saying all the criminal charges should have 
been dismissed by State Supreme Court Justice John Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
"They're after my hide because I'm Leona Helmsley," she told reporters as she 
left the courthouse with her legal entourage and headed for a black stretch 
limousine. 
</P>
<P>
All eight counts are the same -- offering a false instrument for filing in the 
first degree. Each has a maximum penalty of four years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Helmsley has already been sentenced to four years in prison for her federal 
conviction last summer. A jury found that she cheated the government out of 
millions of dollars in taxes by disguising renovations to her Greenwich, Conn., 
mansion as business expenses of the hotel empire she runs with her husband, 
Harry. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley dismissed 180 counts in the 188-count state indictment, nearly all of 
which stem from activities at Dunnellen Hall, the 26-acre estate. 
</P>
<P>
He said a double-jeopardy situation was created by the joint state-federal 
investigations, in which many of the same witnesses were presented to state and 
federal grand juries. 
</P>
<P>
The eight counts Bradley left intact concern a condominium in North Hills, 
N.Y., and the Park Lane Hotel in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley rejected Helmsley's arguments that all charges should be dropped in 
"the interest of justice." 
</P>
<P>
"It has long been a concern of the public that white-collar criminals not be 
coddled by the criminal justice system," Bradley wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Helmsley's federal sentence is stayed pending appeal. Her lawyer, Alan 
Dershowitz, is confident that she will not spend a day in jail.

<P>
The Aug. 17-19 event, formally known as the JVC Jazz Festival-Newport, will 
mark the festival's 10th year back in Newport. 
</P>
<P>
The original Newport Jazz Festival was held from 1954 to 1971, when a riot by 
gate-crashing rowdies moved the event to New York. 
</P>
<P>
Trumpeter Wynton Marsalis will produce the jazz festival's Aug. 17 Armstrong 
tribute, featuring Marsalis and New Orleans musicians, along with trumpeters 
Doc Cheatham, Ruby Braff and Jon Faddis and singer Carrie Smith. Actor Ossie 
Davis will act as host for the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's lineup features Miles Davis, Gerry Mulligan, B. B. King, Elvin Jones 
and Latin jazz artists Celia Cruz and Tito Puente. Sunday's finale will feature

MANUSCRIPT BY BEETHOVEN SOLD FOR $892,000

A music manuscript by Ludwig van Beethoven and a letter from him to a woman 
friend broke world auction records for the composer today, Sotheby's auction 
house said. 
</P>
<P>
Otto Haas, a London dealer, paid $892,000 for the 16-page first movement of the 
Sonata for Violoncello and Piano in A Major, a celebrated piece of chamber 
music. 
</P>
<P>
Beethoven wrote it in brown crayon and black ink between 1807 and 1808, saying 
it was composed "amid tears and sorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Scholars have been unable to determine what he meant by the remark. 
</P>
<P>
The previous highest auction price for a Beethoven music manuscript was 
$168,000 paid in London in May, 1988, for his Ninth Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
An anonymous buyer paid $159,800 for a letter of 1811 to Bettina Brentano, a 
poet and writer, containing references to two of the greatest German literary 
figures, Friedrich von Schiller and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Beethoven mentions Antonie von Brentano, the recipient's 
sister-in-law, who is believed by some historians to have been the "immortal 
beloved" to whom the composer referred in a letter found unsent after his death 
in 1827. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1985, $67,600 was paid in London for a letter by the composer to 
Antonie von Brentano, the previous highest price for a Beethoven letter. 
</P>
<P>
The manuscript and letter belonged to Felix Salzer, who taught music theory at 
the graduate school of the City University of New York. He died in 1986, and 
his collection was sold by his collaborator and widow, Hedwig.

NBC's "Today" show, which will welcome Joe Garagiola back in June as its third 
co-host, still has the ratings blues. It was in second place last week for the 
19th straight week, Nielsen estimates showed today. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's "Good Morning America" remained first in ratings, averaging a 4.8. 
"Today" averaged a 3.2 and "CBS This Morning" a 2.6. Each ratings point 
represents 921,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
The 19th week of bad news for "Today" came a day after it was twitted on local 
TV by WNYW-TV's "Good Day New York" show, which last week beat the slumping NBC 
show in local Nielsen ratings. 
</P>
<P>
The needling occurred Wednesday on the East River, where "Today" was 
broadcasting live from a 160-foot luxury yacht. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Elliott, who normally barges into homes for live interviews on "Good 
Day," dogged the "Today" broadcast in a rented cabin cruiser. 
</P>
<P>
NBC was not amused, said the puckish Elliott, whom viewers saw using a bullhorn 
to hail NBC's show, ask permission to board what he called the "SS Today," and 
interview co-hosts Bryant Gumbel and Deborah Norville. 
</P>
<P>
NBC, through the Coast Guard, "formally asked us to stay 100 yards from their 
vessel, which I thought was bad sportsmanship," he groused. "I was going to 
make our show available to help them in the ratings." 
</P>
<P>
But Elliott can sympathize with ratings woes like those of "Today." He once was 
a host of "Good Morning Australia," which at one time also had ratings 
problems. "It happens to every show," he said.

A $5-million London stage musical about assassinated black civil rights leader 
Martin Luther King Jr. is to close on June 2 after only six weeks, its 
producers said today. 
</P>
<P>
They blamed damaging reviews and publicity about problems affecting "King" 
before it opened. 
</P>
<P>
The show started its run in London's West End almost three weeks late. 
</P>
<P>
King's widow, Coretta, endorsed the production in March after earlier 
complaining that the music trivialized her husband's memory and threatening 
legal action to try to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
The producers claimed that the production was receiving nightly ovations but 
had taken only $170,000 in advance bookings. 
</P>
<P>
Daily Mail critic Jack Tinker said "King" had taken an exciting subject and 
"driven it into the ground under the weight of good intent."

g czar William J. Bennett, who is on a crusade against crack dealers, took a 
swipe at a celluloid bad boy -- Bart Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
During a tour Wednesday of the Foundation for Abraxas drug-treatment center, 
Bennett spied a poster of the cartoon miscreant and told recovering addicts 
that they shouldn't follow Bart's lead as an underachiever. 
</P>
<P>
"You guys aren't watching 'The Simpsons,' are you? That's not going to help you 
any," said Bennett, director of the national drug policy office. 
</P>
<P>
Bart is the spike-haired son on "The Simpsons," the Fox network's highly rated 
cartoon sitcom featuring the adventures of a bug-eyed family of five. 
</P>
<P>
"We have great respect for Mr. Bennett's task and responsibility," said Brad 
Turell, a spokesman for the show. "But I am not aware of any one TV program 
that will help teen-agers kick the drug habit."

Gerard Depardieu, star of the European blockbuster film "Cyrano," will travel 
to Moscow next month to promote the movie featuring what some critics say is 
his best performance. 
</P>
<P>
"Cyrano" is vying for the coveted Gold Palm award at this year's Cannes Film 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
It stars Depardieu as the long-nosed dreamer who breathes his passion and 
poetry into the empty head of a simple soldier to woo the beautiful Roxanne. 
</P>
<P>
At a cost of about $19 million, "Cyrano" is France's most expensive cinema 
production. It was Depardieu's 60th film role and has been called his strongest 
work by many critics. 
</P>
<P>
The film adapted from Edmond Rostand's theater classic was directed by 
Jean-Paul Rappeneau. 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu will be accompanied by Theirry de Beauce, secretary of state in the 
Foreign Affairs Ministry, and will also travel to Czechoslovakia and Hungary, 
where the movie was filmed.

Anita Bryant, the former Florida orange juice woman and campaigner against gay 
rights, calls herself a "walking miracle" for having survived a nervous 
breakdown, pill addiction and divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant, a pop singer in the 1960s, moved to Nashville from Selma, Ala., in 
August to get back into the business. 
</P>
<P>
She just finished an album called "With Love" and is working on her 11th 
inspirational book. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that I am a walking miracle," she said in an interview published 
Wednesday in The Tennessean. "You know how you read about the 'points' you get 
if you have trauma in your life? I've got enough trauma points to have died and 
resurrected about three times. So I know I'm here by God's grace." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant said she had suffered a breakdown, financial woes and addiction to 
pills. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, she took part in a campaign to block a Miami ordinance that would have 
prevented job discrimination against homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
When her marriage ended in divorce 10 years ago, the same people who had 
applauded her crusade against homosexuals condemned her, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the darling of a lot of people. They waved their palms and then the same 
ones next time were saying, 'Crucify her, crucify her,' " she said. "Divorce is 
not God's perfect plan. But thank God it's forgivable."

Country music singer Johnny Cash wrote a letter to the editor saying he's 
worried about what he called obscene, violent, racist and sexist humor favored 
by some new comedians. 
</P>
<P>
The deep-voiced singer known for such hits as "I Walk the Line" and "A Boy 
Named Sue," said in the letter published today in the Tennessean that children 
are getting the wrong idea about what is funny. 
</P>
<P>
He lamented the influence "anti-Semitic, anti-black and anti-immigrant jokes, 
obscenities directed at all women in general and the desecration of traditional 
values will have upon the young minds in this country." 
</P>
<P>
Cash wrote in response to last week's appearance of comic Andrew Dice Clay on 
NBC's "Saturday Night Live." Clay has been criticized for his coarse humor, 
which includes comments that disparage women and homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
Cash said he didn't see the program, but was alarmed about such humor in 
general. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an undercurrent of violence in this new obscenity," Cash wrote. "It 
will shatter the hopes and dreams of many who hoped and prayed and worked for 
brotherhood and racial tolerance."

The British government sent a list of convicted soccer hooligans to Italian 
authorities today and recommended that the rowdy fans be barred from attending 
World Cup matches next month. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement by Home Secretary David Waddington, whose department is 
responsible for law and order in Britain, came one day after a flare-up of fan 
violence at an English soccer match. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-eight people were charged with assault and other offenses after running 
onto the field Wednesday night in Newcastle during a playoff game against 
Sunderland. Nine police officers were injured in battles with fans. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 fans were arrested at several games around England on May 5, the 
final day of the English Soccer League season, with the worst violence and 
property destruction in the southern coastal city of Bournemouth.

Mike Flanagan's return to the big leagues was delayed indefinitely by a 
doctor's examination showing a "general weakness" in his throwing arm. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan said he planned to begin physical therapy for his shoulder soon. 
</P>
<P>
But he would offer no prediction of when he might be ready to resume the big 
league career that began with the Baltimore Orioles in 1975 and, for the 
moment, ended with his release by the Toronto Blue Jays on May 8. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan, 38, won his first two starts and pitched five times for the Blue Jays 
before they let him go last week. But he learned of his shoulder problem only 
Tuesday after he was examined in Worcester, Mass., by Dr. Arthur Pappas, team 
orthopedist of the Boston Red Sox and Flanagan's longtime arm specialist. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan said the decision to be examined by Pappas was "mutually agreed upon" 
by him, his agent and the Red Sox, the team that seemed in the lead to sign 
him. Flanagan said he wouldn't necessarily have joined the Red Sox had he 
gotten a positive report from Pappas. He was also said to be involved in talks 
with the Oakland Athletics, the Dodgers and Chicago Cubs. The Orioles declared 
themselves out of the running earlier this week.

Herman Cohen, president of Pimlico race course from 1952 until he sold it in 
1986, died today at age 95. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen had cancer. 
</P>
<P>
His death came just two days before the 115th running of the Preakness, second 
jewel of the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, Cohen sold the track to Frank De Francis, who died in August. 
</P>
<P>
Since the sale, Cohen operated a Baltimore land developing and construction 
business with his younger brother, 90-year-old Ben Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen also raced and bred thoroughbreds, and he was a past director of the 
Thoroughbred Racing Assn. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, Grace, two brothers, a sister, two grandchildren 
and a niece.

UNBRIDLED, FAVORED AT 7-5, DRAWS NO. 6 POST

Kentucky Derby winner Unbridled was made the early 7-5 favorite and drew the 
No. 6 post today for Saturday's Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall, who finished second at Churchill Downs, will start next to 
Unbridled at the No. 7 post and was the second betting choice at 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Mister Frisky, who had been expected to be one of the top contenders in the 
Kentucky Derby but finished a disappointing eighth, drew the No. 9 post and was 
listed at 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great post position, number six," said Carl Nafzger, Unbridled's 
trainer. "No problems there. I don't see any problems for anybody, not with the 
long run down the stretch." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it (post position) makes much difference," said Cot Campbell, 
one of the members of the syndicate that owns Summer Squall. "We'd just as soon 
have three or four, but certainly this is not bad." 
</P>
<P>
The field, in post position order with jockeys and early odds: (1) Music 
Prospector, Frank Olivares, 30-1; (2) Land Rush, Angel Cordero, 10-1; (3) Baron 
de Vaux, Joe Rocco, 20-1; (4) Kentucky Jazz, Kent Desormeaux, 15-1; (5) 
Fighting Notion, Alberto Delgado, 30-1; (6) Unbridled, Craig Perret, 7-5; (7) 
Summer Squall, Pat Day, 2-1; (8) J. R.'s Horizon, Mark Johnston, 50-1; (9) 
Mister Frisky, Gary Stevens, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
If all nine start, the gross value of the race will be $686,000, with $445,900 
going to the winner. All starters will carry scale weight of 126 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Preakness shapes up as a battle between Kentucky Derby winner Unbridled, 
Summer Squall, who was second, and Mister Frisky. 
</P>
<P>
Land Rush also ran in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
With the stretch-running Pleasant Tap and the front-running Champagneforashley 
out of the race, the strategy was bound to change some. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes away one come-from-behind horse, and one speed horse is out," said 
Summer Squall's trainer, Neil Howard. "There are two top contenders out, but 
it'll still be a tough race." 
</P>
<P>
But Mister Frisky's trainer, Laz Barrera, was not second-guessing his strategy 
in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing you can do is think you did something wrong and change it," 
Barrera said. The Florida-bred Mister Frisky went into the Derby with a 16-0 
record built mostly on tracks in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see anything that I did wrong," Barrera said about his horse's poor 
Derby showing. "The only thing I can say is the horse ran on a track that he 
was not used to running on." 
</P>
<P>
Mister Frisky's trainer, Laz Barrera, was pleased with the draw of the No. 9 
post for his colt. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you are in a position where you can see everybody and you don't have 
to worry about anybody shutting you off," he said. 
</P>

<P>
After almost 40 years of working together, internationally recognized Ojai 
ceramists "Vivika and Otto" have just been awarded what is known as "the Oscar 
of craftsmanship." 
</P>
<P>
Vivika and Otto Heino hate taking time off from work, even to go to the Atlanta 
convention where they will be honored. As if they are a single person, they 
will become a Fellow of the American Craftsmen, and they have been one since 
they met in the early 1950s, sharing marriage, work, creating and teaching. 
</P>
<P>
"We lived in New Hampshire," said Vivika, "he on a milk farm, me in a little 
village outside Concord. I met Otto on my way into town. He asked where I was 
going. I said, 'To teach a pottery class.' He said, 'I'll come with you and 
take your class.' Then he came by to see if I needed any help setting up my 
studio. After that, we were never apart. He got rid of the farm where his 
old-fashioned Finnish father had made him and his brother milk 90 cows twice a 
day. When he sold it, he said, 'Now I'll never have to milk another cow again." 
</P>
<P>
As a G.I. during World War II, Otto had been exposed to European folk art and 
had come back to the States with a great love of good craftsmanship, wood, 
glass and pottery. Vivika had already studied at the New York College of 
Ceramics, the New Hampshire League of Arts and Crafts, and the San Francisco 
School of Fine Arts and had developed her own studio. Otto was hungry to learn 
and studied at the Chouinard Art Institute and USC while Vivika was teaching 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't want to be known as Mr. Vivika," she said. "So he went off and got a 
job at Douglas Aircraft. But he worked and worked at his pottery. He was so 
conscientious, so humble about it. I said to him, 'You haven't really learned 
to throw. You're still coiling. . . .' Or he would pass it to me for me to 
scratch. I said, 'I don't want to scratch. You do your own thing.' " 
</P>
<P>
What has resulted is a kind of teamwork that does not exist with other 
ceramists. Both Vivika and Otto throw pots and both glaze, unlike other 
husband-and-wife teams who may each specialize in one or another aspect of a 
craft. 
</P>
<P>
"He throws a bigger pot than I do," Vivika said. "But we like the same forms. . 
. . Neither one of us draws. We let the clay dictate where we're going. The 
only thing I draw is ideas to remember -- I put them on file cards." 
</P>
<P>
And always, no matter who conceived the original concept, the signature remains 
the same: "Vivika and Otto." 
</P>
<P>
"He prints his name and I write mine in longhand," she said. "But we see things 
alike. It's remarkable. When we landscaped this place, we both had very similar 
feelings about how it should be done," she said, waving at the tremendous 
expanse of garden surrounding their Ojai home-studio-shop, where from every 
angle is seen beauty of line, form and color. 
</P>
<P>
"We may have different ideas about how or what should be planted, but our 
feelings are very much the same." She laughed. "I can't forget -- a long time 
ago, we were with some friends. Someone asked, 'What would you want if you had 
lots of money?' One of them answered, "I want a boat.' Another said, 'I'd buy a 
race horse.' Otto just sat there. You see how he sits," she beamed at him 
fondly. "I asked him, 'Otto -- what do you want?' He looked sheepish. Then he 
said, 'I want peace of mind.' You know, that's what we both want. It's in our 
work, in the way we live." 
</P>
<P>
Their home, their studio, the gardens, their pots all reflect the yearning for 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
They haven't become California funky, say the art critics. They're traditional 
potters who have kept a straightforward approach and, as such, because they are 
fine and dedicated teachers, have had an enormous influence on ceramics. 
They've been shown in hundreds of exhibitions from Czechoslovakia to Canada, 
have taught wherever they've lived and have received awards including the Gold 
Medal at the Vallauris Biennale. 
</P>
<P>
It's no accident that they started out in New Hampshire and, after a nomadic 
life of creating and teaching, wound up here in a sunny peaceful valley. 
</P>
<P>
"New England was a hard life. Otto used to have to drag our stuff through the 
ice and snow. I couldn't let him keep on, back and forth to the barn in 
below-zero weather. When we heard Beatrice Woods' old place was for sale, we 
were here in two days. That was 18 years ago. It was our dream." 
</P>
<P>
"It was Paradise," put in Otto. "It still is."

SWAY THE NIGHT AWAY;

<P>
* DANCING: WHETHER YOU PREFER COUNTRY, BALLROOM, REGGAE OR DISCO, YOU'LL FIND A 
DANCE FLOOR TO SUIT.

Asking locals to recommend places to go in Ventura County to do some social 
dancing is like asking an 8-year-old boy to recommend a good place to do 
homework. You get a few giggles, a snicker, a couple of, I don't knows, and one 
or two, What do you means. But if you wait long enough, you get the answer 
you're looking for, and in this case, directions to get there. 
</P>
<P>
Though it may not be immediately evident, there are some pretty nice places to 
do all kinds of dancing around town -- and it doesn't necessarily have to be 
square dancing. It just takes a little looking around, which is what Ventura 
County Life does best. True, we dance to our own drummer, but at least we 
dance. We two-stepped, waltzed and flat-out boogied our way across the county 
to get a sampling of the social dancing available. 
</P>
<P>
When we weren't chewing up the dance floor, we were checking out the 
establishments themselves. Would we take our mothers there? Would we be ashamed 
to let our mothers know we even knew about the place? Would we need a hosing 
down when we got home? We took a look at various other elements too -- things 
that could make or break a night on the town. Like noise level. There's no 
sense going out dancing if you'll never hear again. So we've given each place 
listed here a noise rating, based on perhaps the most awful noise there is -- 
garbage men clanging cans at 6 on a Monday morning. (One garbage man is 
relatively quiet, 10 garbage men are obnoxiously loud, and dangerous to one's 
health). 
</P>
<P>
Being the traditionalists we are, we naturally associated social dancing with 
some actual physical contact between partners. Wrong. Then again, we had never 
heard of John Travolta either. Some places have touch dancing, some don't. As a 
service we studied closely, very closely, the physical contact going on at each 
stop we made. Finally, we looked at the potential for romance in the various 
clubs. Of course, we skipped some of the obvious places knowing all too well 
we'd be the hamburger among the T-bones, but every place has its potential for 
short- or long-term romance. 
</P>
<P>
We took a look around and made some quick assessments. So now you'll be ready 
to dance the night away, whether you prefer country, ballroom, reggae or disco. 
But don't try to find us there. We'll be soaking our feet -- while trying to 
figure out why that woman slapped us when we asked her if she'd like to 
Lambada. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE CHAPARRAL CLUB 
</P>
<P>
281 West Main St., Ventura 
</P>
<P>
Country-western all the way, from the four wagon wheels over the bar, to the 
three sets of steer horns bolted to the wall. You can hear the whooping and 
hollering the moment you pull into the dirt parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Each Thursday, Friday and Saturday there's a live band playing songs like "All 
My Ex's Live in Texas," "Lookin for Love," and "Tulsa Time." And there's a 
great mix of people, most of whom are in their 30s, dancing to the music. There 
are the polished dancers and the, well, people who might benefit from a lesson 
or two. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of an unwritten law that the low-steppers (the good ones) dance 
around the outside of the dance floor in a square," said waitress Deedee 
Romero, "and the others (the not-so-good ones) stay on the inside and just do 
that swing thing. They slow dance, fast dance, I don't know what they call it." 
</P>
<P>
The good ones, on the other hand, do know their favorite dances by name. Along 
with various line dances (one of which is called the Tush-Push for obvious 
reasons) there is the two-step and the Cotton-Eyed Joe. 
</P>
<P>
"We mostly do the Texas two-step. It's the same as the fox-trot or swing," said 
John Godds, a former dance instructor, who comes to the club regularly with his 
wife, Clara, and a group of other trained dancers. "Country-western covers all 
kinds of music and all tempos of music. The style is very unstructured." 
</P>
<P>
And why does Clara like country-western dancing? 
</P>
<P>
"You can be vulgar and dirty and no one says anything," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Decibel level: 6 garbage men. Touch analysis: Hands on shoulders and hands on 
hips (one's own or those belonging to someone else. Chance of romance: With a 
good drawl and a nice pair of boots, you'd have a 50-50 chance of lassoing 
someone. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RUBE'S VALLEY HOUSE OF BAR-B-QUE 
</P>
<P>
1115 E. Los Angeles Ave., Simi Valley 
</P>
<P>
Imagine a 40ish husband and wife doing the swing, while over your shoulder an 
unshaven dude in a Levi vest gives a gruff rendition of "Poison Ivy?" 
</P>
<P>
Rube's is a family-oriented steakhouse with a dance floor. Kids and bikers 
welcome. The autographed photo of Los Angeles Dodger Manager Tommy Lasorda 
across from the entrance is there to rope in diners. 
</P>
<P>
There is live music Thursday through Sunday beginning about 9 p.m., with music 
mostly from the '50s, '60s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
"We start out with nice, soft dinner music. We don't want to blow any steaks 
off the plates," said manager Bruce Donabedian, whose parents own the 
12-year-old place. "The first set is ballad music. The dancing is slow and 
people are rubbing tummies. Around 10 or 10:30 we start to get the walk-ins who 
want to boogie the night away." 
</P>
<P>
Donabedian brings in bands from Los Angeles, like the four-piece group 
"Notorious," who play danceable oldies like "Boni Maroni" and "Georgia." 
</P>
<P>
Decibel level: 5 garbage men. Touch analysis: As the man said, tummy on tummy 
for the slow dances. It's hand to hand or freestyle for the faster ones. 
</P>
<P>
Chance of romance: The single folks hang out at the bar. It helps if you have a 
better opening line than this one used by the Poison Ivy guy: You know, I find 
myself becoming very attracted to you, even though I know we don't have a damn 
thing in common. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OXNARD COMMUNITY CENTER 
</P>
<P>
(Ventura Room) 
</P>
<P>
800 Hobson Way, Oxnard 
</P>
<P>
Wanted: Men!!! Tall men, short men, any men. Must be at least 50 years old. 
Must have staying power on the dance floor every Thursday night at the Oxnard 
50-plus Club's weekly ballroom get-together. 
</P>
<P>
Each week more than 100 people show up, the majority dressed semi-formally, the 
women in glittery dresses and the men in coats and ties. The ambience is 
similar to that of a senior prom, with the unattached lining the walls in 
nervous anticipation. The bad part is there aren't enough men to go around. Not 
by a long shot, say the frustrated women. 
</P>
<P>
"Men die younger," said 73-year-old Charlie Foxworth, who wears a white shirt, 
a red bow tie, a black coat, black pants, black shoes and black hair (which he 
swears is natural). "Women love men to death. I'm trying to get back at them. 
I've been married five times." 
</P>
<P>
Foxworth's latest "steady," 71-year-old Louise Morlin, explained the shortage 
differently. "They all die young because they were wild when they were 
younger." 
</P>
<P>
The dance hall, located right across from the bingo hall, is large, really 
large. One expects the Lakers to come dribbling through the door. But the 
dancers cover the entire length of it, all dancing counter-clockwise and 
organized. There are 96 lights on the ceiling, though most are off during the 
dance. There are also about 130 folding chairs. 
</P>
<P>
At the far end of the hall, there's an elevated stage for the three-piece band 
led by Johnny Olins. Olins also plays for the weekly Ventura, Santa Barbara and 
Reseda 50-plus dances. On an average Thursday in Oxnard you might catch him 
crooning "Kansas City" or "Button Up Your Overcoat." 
</P>
<P>
What you will definitely find are a lot of people who love the dancing and the 
camaraderie. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to find someone younger than me," said Foxworth. "They can't stay up 
with me. I dance every dance." 
</P>
<P>
Decibel level: 2 garbage men. Touch analysis: Man's left hand against woman's 
right hand. Man's right hand touching woman's back. All very proper. 
</P>
<P>
Chance of romance: Great, if you're In the Mood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ERIC ERICSSON'S 
</P>
<P>
1140 Seaward Ave., Ventura 
</P>
<P>
Don't let the name of this club or the wooden Viking in the courtyard fool you. 
There's some serious reggae music and dancing going on inside every Sunday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"People who are into the dancing will dance all night long," said bouncer Ken 
O'Neill. "They'll work up a killer sweat." 
</P>
<P>
And perspiration is just what management likes to see dripping onto the 
triangular, stone dance floor. "The kinds of bands we bring in are upbeat and 
contemporary, more than slow, rootsy and repetitive. Upbeat keeps them 
dancing," said promoter Michael Levine. "The two things the people want are 
reggae and dance." 
</P>
<P>
The people Levine is talking about are difficult to categorize. 
</P>
<P>
"The crowd is on a tangent with the Grateful Dead. Some don't even want to 
drink. They'll drink water and just dance," said O'Neill. "We get a younger 
crowd mostly, but we get both sides of the coin. We get the salt-and-pepper 
crowd too. A lot of times there are girls in gypsy apparel -- bracelets, beads, 
bangles, sandals -- kind of an earthy group." 
</P>
<P>
But there's also a fair share of shorts, T-shirts, dresses, jeans, slacks and 
tie-dyed anything. 
</P>
<P>
Dick and Dodie Crank, an Oxnard couple in their 50s, have been coming to 
Ericsson's on Sunday nights for the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if you don't know how to dance you can move to reggae music," said Dodie, 
dressed in an understated khaki blouse and black skirt. "People come from all 
over following reggae." 
</P>
<P>
"It's peaceful, inspirational," said Dick, dressed in a black tie-dyed shirt, 
black pants and a thin leather choker. "It's a natural beat to dance to. For me 
this is like going to church." 
</P>
<P>
Decibel rating: 8 garbage men. Touch analysis: Not much touching one another, 
but a lot of getting in touch with oneself. 
</P>
<P>
Chance of romance: Well, there was definitely some flirting going on. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ALAMO RESTAURANT 
</P>
<P>
1312 Del Norte Road, Camarillo 
</P>
<P>
It's mostly Top 40 and rap dance music here, though Wednesday nights are dubbed 
country-western and on Saturdays you get alternative music from groups like 
Oingo Boingo, if anyone is interested. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically it's stuff with a real hard beat," said DJ Jeff Rotter. "They want 
to feel the beat." Which means you're likely to hear a lot of stuff by Paula 
Abdul and some Tone Loc mixed in with some of the old favorites like "Wild 
Thing." 
</P>
<P>
The dance floor and surrounding area could pass for a miniature Arthur Murray 
studio if it weren't for the Lighted Spuds McKenzie off in the distance and an 
enormous collection of beer signs hanging about the place. There's the hardwood 
floor, the rotating mirrored ball on the ceiling, and three full-length mirrors 
on the wall. The small fan just off the dance floor would indicate that it can 
get warm out there. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 couples could dance fairly comfortably. But, said disc jockey Jeff 
Rotter, "You should see this place on a Friday night. It's a madhouse. You 
can't even walk. They squish about 30 couples out there. And they dance out on 
the patio too." 
</P>
<P>
There's dance music Tuesday through Saturday and on the average weekday the 
place attracts mostly regulars (men and women in their 20s, and softball 
players relaxing after the game). 
</P>
<P>
Decibel level: 7 garbage men. Touch analysis: There is probably more physical 
contact at the softball game. Here, the dancers take the basic freestyle 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
Chance of romance: We're talking mostly short-term relationships here. There 
are some nice out-of-the-way booths that might allow for some conversation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
JUDGE ROY BEAN'S 
</P>
<P>
2780 Tapo Canyon Road, Simi Valley 
</P>
<P>
It's a rare club these days in which a band can play the song "Mony, Mony" and 
most of the people there will think of Tommy James and the Shondells not Billy 
Idol. 
</P>
<P>
But's that's the case at Bean's. 
</P>
<P>
The clientele is predominantly in their mid-30s and they are elbow to elbow on 
the dance floor for every song. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the kind of crowd we try to attract," said bartender Cindy Weening. 
"We're not a hang-out." 
</P>
<P>
There's a new band every Friday and Saturday, all doing music from the '50s and 
'60s, with soloists or duos playing the rest of the week. Bands play songs like 
"Under the Boardwalk," "Sweet Home Alabama," "Lucille" and various Elvis tunes. 
</P>
<P>
Decibel level: 8 garbage men. Touch analysis: Like the Alamo, there's more 
touching off the floor, than on. 
</P>
<P>
Chance of romance: Where there's Elvis, there's love.

BANDLEADER STAYS UPBEAT ABOUT DANCING 
</P>

What worries Ventura's Johnny Olins? 
</P>
<P>
Oh, affairs in the Middle East worry him. So does the state of labor unions. 
And so does the small number of young adults interested in ballroom dancing. 
</P>
<P>
As a bandleader, this last worry is to be expected. If people don't dance, 
Olins doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
"Without the young people, we're losing the lifeblood of ballroom dancing. 
We're losing it by attrition," he said. "Some of them say they feel awkward, 
but ballroom dance is easy. It's step one. Step two. It's like putting your 
rifle together. Eventually you don't think about it, you just go." (Olins spent 
some time in the military, by the way.) 
</P>
<P>
But as concerned as he is, Olins is encouraged by ballroom dancing's rise in 
popularity over the last decade or so and he says that as long as people need 
to socialize, they will need to dance together. 
</P>
<P>
There may be no better evidence of the strong heartbeat of ballroom dance than 
the number of people who come out to fox trot, waltz and swing every time Olins 
and his four-man band perform. 
</P>
<P>
The group is one of several local bands -- including the Mello Tones, the 
Social Climbers, the Melody Makers and the 19-piece Societe -- which keep busy 
working for local groups, private parties and the 50-plus clubs in Oxnard, 
Ventura, Santa Barbara and Reseda, which get turnouts of more than 100. 
</P>
<P>
The 65-year-old Olins picked up a cornet at age 9 and has never been far from a 
horn since. Growing up in Chicago, he played with the likes of Lawrence Welk 
and Les Brown and, after moving to California, taught junior high school music 
for 25 years. His years of experience and mistakes, he said, have taught him 
what it takes to be a good bandleader. 
</P>
<P>
"You are the authority. If you're not, what the hell, let's put a record on," 
he said. "The dancers are expecting that you're going to provide them with 
typical good dance music." 
</P>
<P>
"I have to know how difficult it is for a man to lead a woman on the floor if 
she's not really qualified to be there," he said. "I've got to watch the crowd. 
I've got to look out there and see if someone is stumbling. I admire women who 
follow some of these guys who are klutzes." 
</P>
<P>
Those klutzes can be a musician's pitfall. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times I turn to the drummer and say, 'Don't watch the guy with the 
funny shirt. He's out of step,' " said Olins. 
</P>
<P>
Certain waltzes, he said, depend on certain tempos and the band is expected to 
maintain a consistent rhythm. If he doesn't "then they're tripping and 
falling." 
</P>
<P>
And that wouldn't be a good example for those impressionable youth. LEO SMITH

IRVINE ARTS LEADER AIMS TO CREATE A SCENE; 
</P>
<P>
CULTURE: HENRY KORN IS WORKING TO REBUILD A PUBLIC ARTS PROGRAM IN THE MECCA OF 
MASTER PLANNING. THE EFFORT IS PART OF A NATIONWIDE TREND TO IMPROVE THE 
QUALITY OF LIFE.

<P>
So why would an arts administrator leave Santa Monica, with one of the most 
active and diverse cultural scenes in Southern California, for the antiseptic 
environs of Irvine? 
</P>
<P>
 For the challenge, of course, answers Henry Korn, now in his second week as 
Irvine's cultural affairs manager. 
</P>
<P>
In the face of Irvine-esque "sameness of people's every day experience," the 
arts can "invest a community with a sense of identity," Korn said. "If ever 
there was a place that needed it," he adds, "it was sure going to be Irvine." 
</P>
<P>
If he is daunted by the thought of trying to bring a spark of culture -- with 
its implicit promises of spontaneity and individual expression -- to the mecca 
of master planning, he doesn't let on. In fact, he seems to relish it. 
</P>
<P>
"The part about (arts administration) that interests me the most is the 
beginning of things because that's when the creative opportunities are the 
greatest," Korn said. "That's when you're dreaming the dreams." 
</P>
<P>
Korn's appointment is the most concrete step yet in Irvine's quest to establish 
a local arts agency. After years of reports, studies and committee meetings, a 
Cultural Affairs Commission was appointed earlier this year. Commission members 
are now working with Korn to present a detailed funding plan to the City 
Council, possibly by July. 
</P>
<P>
The agency's mission is still being defined, but its primary tasks probably 
will include giving grants to local arts groups, rebuilding a public arts 
program, establishing a mechanism to raise private funds, lending a hand in 
local arts education, and administering the existing Irvine Fine Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
Several Orange County cities already have arts agencies, and the county itself 
is thinking about establishing one. These efforts are part of a larger trend, 
according to Thomas Wolf, a consultant whose Massachusetts-based Wolf 
Organization prepared a blueprint for Irvine's proposed agency. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last two decades, the local arts agency movement has grown from 
virtually nothing to a movement which is very large," Wolf said this week. 
"Cities of even moderate size now generally are developing local arts 
councils." Wolf said economic factors play as big a role in the movement as a 
desire to improve the quality of life: Cities have noted that "cultural 
amenities" are effective incentives for attracting businesses, as well as 
high-income and well-educated residents. 
</P>
<P>
Wolf sees the role of local agencies gaining in importance as state and federal 
arts support hits a ceiling. "Since the beginning of the '80s, the real growth 
explosions of new monies have been at the local level," he said. Federal and 
state support have "really capped, because there's a huge federal deficit. The 
states are facing big deficits." 
</P>
<P>
The soft-spoken Korn, 44, continues to live in Los Angeles with his wife Donna 
Stein, an independent exhibition organizer (she is bringing parts of the Berlin 
Wall to Los Angeles), and their 3-year-old daughter, Sophie. An author, Korn is 
currently working on a book of fiction and takes part in a weekly comedy 
writing workshop with veteran TV writer Danny Simon, brother of playwright 
Neil. 
</P>
<P>
Korn was hailed in Santa Monica for his handling of the city's public arts 
program, which installed 15 public sculptures during his four-year tenure, and 
for the success of the Santa Monica Art Foundation, which raised $250,000 from 
the business community in three years. 
</P>
<P>
Among his other accomplishments: administration of an active performing arts 
program, including free outdoor theater; a literature program that, among other 
things, put poetry on the inside walls of city buses; a video art program that 
broadcast artists' works on the city-run public access channel, and creation of 
a city art collection. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a number of these things are applicable to Irvine," Korn said. 
</P>
<P>
While he enjoyed his work in Santa Monica, he says he felt he had fulfilled his 
goals there and was ready to move on. "There are lots of 'maintainers' in the 
world," he notes. "I'm not a maintainer." 
</P>
<P>
One obstacle he acknowledges in Irvine is its youth and affluence. The cost of 
housing is not exactly within the reach of most artists, and because there are 
few older buildings, inexpensive studio space can be hard to find. According to 
the Wolf Organization report, studio rentals in Irvine can run three times as 
high as equivalent space in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Korn says, "we hope to create a situation hospitable to an artists' 
community," perhaps by providing employment for artists and arts professionals 
through residencies and commissions, and through jobs at the Fine Arts Center 
and through the public schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We can perhaps even create working spaces for artists," he said. The Wolf 
report suggests expanding the Fine Arts Center to accommodate private studios 
or creating some sort of partnership with UC Irvine. Korn sees the university 
as one of the city's attributes both as a source of cultural expertise and as a 
partner in arts ventures. Already, the city and UCI have joined to build the 
Irvine Theatre, due to open in October. 
</P>
<P>
And, even as he jokes about Irvine's reputation as a middle-class fortress of 
enforced architectural uniformity, Korn says he has found Irvine residents to 
be open and enthusiastic about creating a cultural scene. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can come to any conclusions about people from the outsides 
of their houses," he said. "The built environment has been defined by 
developers and corporate institutions. 
</P>
<P>
"Creativity is meaningless without receptivity. . . . My sense is that Irvine 
has a very well-developed degree of receptivity."

A STAR BY WORD OF MOUTH; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: SALLY JESSY RAPHAEL WORKS WITHOUT THE RAZZLE AND DAZZLE OF HER 
COMPETITORS, BUT SHE'S BEEN NOMINATED AGAIN FOR AN EMMY AS BEST TALK-SHOW HOST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, TIMES TELEVISION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sally Jessy Raphael has learned to live with the question: Is she upset that 
talk-show competitors such as Oprah Winfrey are far better known? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, gosh, no. I don't feel bad," maintains Raphael. "I'm grateful to be where 
I am." 
</P>
<P>
It would be only human, of course, if she really felt otherwise. Last year, in 
a TV Guide interview, her husband was quoted as saying that the Oprah 
phenomenon was discussed "ad nauseam." But Raphael simply and diplomatically 
said the other day, "Oprah is magic." 
</P>
<P>
If Raphael, whose show is carried in Los Angeles by KCAL Channel 9, has a major 
strength, it is that she knows her place. Better yet, she knows who she is. She 
is an average-looking, hard-working, down-to-earth broadcast professional who 
has been through the mill -- fired 18 times -- but has not let it embitter her 
as she tackles her daily syndicated series with a matronly warmth. 
</P>
<P>
The approach works. Last year, she won the Daytime Emmy Award for best 
talk-show host, beating out Oprah, among others. And last Thursday, both she 
and her show were nominated again for this year's Daytime Emmys, which will be 
televised on ABC from New York on June 28. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, Raphael is out promoting her new book, "Sally," which she wrote 
with Pam Proctor. Typically, it focuses on what she calls the "funny, crazy" 
experiences of her career: "It tells the stories of a man and a woman and their 
kids going from town to town trying to find work. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the story of thinking you've made it 20 times, and each time the show 
gets canceled or the station changes language and you're back at ground zero. 
And you're going, 'Why does it take so long?' It's also the story of telling 
people that if you stay around long enough, having nothing to do with talent. . 
. . Well, I think the talent is in staying." 
</P>
<P>
The day after her latest Emmy nomination last week, Raphael sat calmly on a 
couch in her suite at the Beverly Hills Hotel amid hurried reminders that she 
had to leave soon to tape her guest shot on the Arsenio Hall show. She refused 
to be rushed. 
</P>
<P>
No, she said of her image, she did not try to keep a low public profile 
compared to competitors Winfrey, Phil Donahue, Geraldo Rivera and, now, Joan 
Rivers: "It may be because there's nothing sensational about me. I mean, I'm a 
lady who's been married to the same man for 25 years. I have my children; I 
travel with them. The tabloids don't call. There's no dirt, there's nothing, 
just somebody working at their job. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that in today's world, that says something. And I think the reason you 
last is that you're a comfortable, not objectionable, person to a lot of 
people. Now, there's two ways of making it. There's making it with a great big 
splash. But Hugh Downs is a slow guy who's always going to work. Sally Jessy 
Raphael is a slow person who's always going to work." 
</P>
<P>
No one, of course, epitomizes the big-splash species more than Winfrey. And 
Raphael has sized up her competition: "In any business, there's always somebody 
who comes along who wins all the prizes. Oprah's the one who won all the 
prizes. There is no comparison in terms of fame or salary or acceptance or 
timing or anything. I don't feel that anybody, either Geraldo or Phil or I or 
any of the other shows, comes near to Oprah's phenomenal success. 
</P>
<P>
"This lady did not get lucky. This lady is a good broadcaster. She's what 
America wants to see. I don't know what other people earn. I don't know what 
stock they have. But none of us could put up a studio (as Winfrey has in 
Chicago). It's like saying to some man who's working somewhere, and he thinks 
he's done well -- and has -- 'Let's compare you with John D. Rockefeller.' " 
</P>
<P>
As for Donahue, Raphael says: "That guy probably would have been pretty happy 
being an Irishman in politics. I know him, so I know that's true. He's been 
doing this 23 years. He's forgotten more than this lady is going to learn. 
Would he ever give this up and run for politics? I wouldn't be surprised." 
</P>
<P>
KCAL broadcasts the "Sally Jessy Raphael" show twice daily -- a rerun at 11 
a.m. and new segments at 2 p.m. Low profile or not, she has become one of that 
special breed of national TV schmoozers whose first name alone is sufficient 
identification -- Phil, Geraldo, Oprah and Sally -- and whose styles and 
frequently flamboyant content provoke endless debate. 
</P>
<P>
Raphael says that perhaps 70% of her programs come from viewer mail: "Please do 
a show on. . . ." And although her first-run broadcasts are presented at 2 p.m. 
on KCAL, she says her national exposure is vastly different: "My audience is 
largely 10 o'clock in the morning, predominantly female, surprisingly young -- 
but they're home because they're mothers. They've had their baby and they're 
staying home with their child." 
</P>
<P>
The mid-morning time slots nationally could also explain why Raphael's profile 
is lower than those of Oprah, Phil and Geraldo, who, in Los Angeles for 
example, are used as lead-ins to the local evening news, and thus become part 
and parcel of hard-hitting TV packages. 
</P>
<P>
On a national basis, too, says Raphael, "Oprah, Phil and Geraldo are late 
afternoon. People put us together in one bag. But by late afternoon, when 
they're on, there are many more men watching, and their audiences also have 
children included. There are very few school systems where there are many 
children home at 10 o'clock in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
Still, with her mix of subjects ranging from matchmakers to diseases to social 
issues to a bikini contest, Raphael is definitely on a roll. And in her effort 
to enhance her down-home image as opposed to the big boppers like Donahue and 
Geraldo, she's made it a point to take her show to many cities. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe she shouldn't have stayed at the Beverly Hills Hotel. You almost expect 
to find Sally Jessy Raphael at a Holiday Inn, gabbing in the lobby with 
families checking in. The fast lane really isn't her speed, and that's clearly 
her appeal to her fans. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the show," she says. "I want to stay here as long as I'm allowed. You 
get your 10 minutes in the sun and you do what you do, and then you have to be 
prepared for the day it's over."

</P>
<P>
BOOKS: 'AN INCONVENIENT WOMAN,' DOMINICK DUNNE'S NEW NOVEL, TAKES AIM AT 
SOUTHLAND'S SOCIAL SET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JEANNINE STEIN, TIMES SOCIETY WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
It was only a matter of time before author Dominick Dunne decided to turn his 
attention westward and give the bluebloods of Los Angeles some attention. After 
writing two novels chronicling the lives, loves and scandals of the moneyed and 
powerful members of the East Coast social circuit, he's come up with "An 
Inconvenient Woman," set in Los Angeles. The book, his fourth (already sold as 
a miniseries to ABC), takes up with the lives of the old guard and Hollywood 
nouveau riche. Although the two groups have seldom been known to cross paths, 
they do in this book, with murders and dangerous liaisons shaking the 
foundations of some seemingly perfect lives. 
</P>
<P>
After two novels -- "The Two Mrs. Grenvilles" and "People Like Us" -- dealing 
with East Coast society, Dunne explains why he decided to take his focus west. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you one thing, I lived in Los Angeles for many years, and it is an 
utterly fascinating city," says the 64-year-old former movie producer, now a 
contributing editor of Vanity Fair magazine. "I've had enormous happiness 
there, and enormous unhappiness there. I've sort of gone through the spectrum. 
But I've always been interested in how the groups do not overlap the way they 
do in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never understood it, but I've always been fascinated by it. The kind of 
old guard Los Angeles who belong to the L.A. Country Club really are totally 
into themselves. It's not like the ladies who go to the Bistro, they don't sit 
there and talk about the movie stars at the next table. They might even live 
next door to celebrities, but they don't care, and they don't relate to them. 
It goes the other way, too. The movie world has no fascination for the social 
world. . . . I still don't think they do for the most part. I think one of the 
best things that happened to L.A. was the Music Center, because it did bring 
those various groups together." 
</P>
<P>
Scandal-driven downfalls of a city's most prominent citizens are a recurring 
theme in Dunne's previous novels. It's a case where art obviously imitates 
life. He has to look no farther than the newspaper to find models like Donald 
and Ivana Trump, Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky. 
</P>
<P>
So why is it that we revel in seeing the mighty fall so hard? 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't that we're tearing them down," he says. "They're tearing themselves 
down. Nobody tore down Mike Milken. Nobody is tearing down Trump. And I think 
you only relish seeing them fall if you think they've abused the system. 
Certainly Mr. Milken abused the system. I think it's wonderful that they 
haven't gotten away with it. There's something about Donald Trump, that his ego 
has so kind of gotten in the way of his life. Donald rode high for so long, he 
was kind of due for a fall." 
</P>
<P>
So far, he says, "An Inconvenient Woman," due out next month, hasn't caused too 
many social moths to turn the book into a brainteaser as they try to determine 
on whom the characters are based, as they've done with his previous books. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I've ever written a one-on-one character," he says. (Although he 
has admitted to close correlations in the past, including Gus Bailey, who 
mirrors Dunne himself in "People Like Us.") "I've always put three or four 
people together. A friend of mine said this book goes beyond the guessing game, 
and if that's what people are doing, they're missing the point of the book. 
Someone else said they loved the book, and they've already guessed who everyone 
was. I don't think that's a compliment." 
</P>
<P>
Dunne called L.A. home from the '50s through the '70s, when he produced such 
films as "The Boys in the Band" and "The Panic in Needle Park." The source of 
his "enormous unhappiness" in L.A. could be the death of his daughter 
Dominique, who was murdered by her ex-boyfriend in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"An Inconvenient Woman" isn't the first book Dunne has set in L.A. His first, 
"The Winners," dealt with the inner workings of the movie industry. He readily 
admits it was a flop. 
</P>
<P>
"Listen, nobody read 'The Winners,' that just sort of passed by," but he still 
has "great affection" for the novel. Some characters who appeared in "The 
Winners" crop up again in "An Inconvenient Woman." Actually, Dunne threads some 
of the same characters through all of his novels. 
</P>
<P>
"I do that to show that there is a continuation of life, even though 'The Two 
Mrs. Grenvilles' took place in the '50s and this takes place in the '90s. It 
reminds us that these groups keep going on." 
</P>
<P>
He keeps in tentative touch with the L.A. social scene through sporadic visits 
here. "When I go back now," he says, "I really sort of don't go out very much. 
When I'm there it's usually to do a story for Vanity Fair. My former wife, with 
whom I'm very close, is there, and I've got some great chums there. . . . I was 
out there recently and went to (literary agent Irving) Lazar's Academy Awards 
party. I always have a great time at that; it's a wonderful way to catch up 
with people." 
</P>
<P>
His exclusive contract with Vanity Fair has resulted in profiles of Candy (Mrs. 
Aaron) Spelling, Imelda Marcos, Diane Keaton, Claus von Bulow and Elizabeth 
Taylor. Dunne is now writing about "a wedding that recently didn't take place 
in Venice between a great Australian heiress, who turned out not to be an 
heiress, and a Venetian prince, who turned out not to be a prince." He laughs 
mischievously and adds: "The wedding was canceled at the last minute. But 
that's what I love about working for Vanity Fair. You wake up one morning and 
get a call and it's someone saying, 'Can you go to Venice tonight?' " 
</P>
<P>
Dunne heaps credit on editor-in-chief Tina Brown for his late-in-life success 
as a magazine writer. "I met her at a dinner at the home of (fellow 
contributing editor) Marie Brenner. I had just left Hollywood and was here in 
New York and trying to write 'Grenvilles.' This was before she was editor of 
Vanity Fair, and I knew she was this English girl who was with the Tattler. So 
I got a call from her and she said, 'You know, you should be writing for 
magazines.' I said, 'Listen, I'm just learning how to write a book.' And she 
said, 'I could teach you.' She recognized that I had something." 
</P>
<P>
Access to the rich and infamous affords Dunne fodder for his novels. For years 
he's managed to maintain a delicate balance between befriending the social 
elite and writing about them. But not all his subjects have been thrilled with 
his stories. "Listen, some people get mad at me. I don't think Claus von Bulow 
wants to have dinner with me, but I don't want to have dinner with him, 
either." 
</P>
<P>
He says he never sets out to skewer his subjects. "I would hate to make a fool 
of anybody. That's irresponsible. Besides, people are too damned interesting. 
If you know how to interview them right, let them do it to themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Still, after years of viewing firsthand the world's moneyed and powerful, Dunne 
isn't the least bit jaded by some of the scenes he has witnessed. 
</P>
<P>
Imelda Marcos, for instance, allowed him a four-hour interview at the deposed 
couple's Hawaiian hide-out while Ferdinand was at the dentist. "When he came 
back and saw me there I could tell he was mad," Dunne recalls. "He was furious 
with her. They got into a fight in front of me. Now, I can't talk about foreign 
policy, but to see this couple that the whole world was focused on, that was 
fascinating." 
</P>
<P>
Dunne is also at work on a Vanity Fair piece about Erik and Lyle Menendez, the 
brothers accused of murdering their parents. 
</P>
<P>
His book tour kicks off as the miniseries version of "People Like Us" has just 
aired on NBC. A recent TV Guide article, titled "Author: TV Botched My 
Bestseller," portrayed Dunne as being displeased with the show's final script. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't read the piece," he explains, "but God knows I've had it read to me. 
The headline says something about it being botched. I never said that. I know 
the network is really upset with me. I stand behind those quotes, and I still 
retain my opinion about the fact that people writing screenplays ought to 
consult with the author. But I was talking in generalities about adaptations. I 
was a movie producer for years, and I changed other people's works. All the 
good stuff that I said -- and I spoke very highly of the producer, that I knew 
how hard he fought to retain as much of the book as he could -- none of that is 
mentioned." 
</P>
<P>
With the miniseries over, what's pressing now are his Vanity Fair deadlines and 
the book tour. A billboard ad for the book is due on Sunset Boulevard soon. 
</P>
<P>
He chuckles at the thought of it. "It's like a cheap dream, isn't it?"

<P>
It has taken two sports and three colleges, but Jim Short finally has found 
athletic success. 
</P>
<P>
Short, the starting first baseman for Fullerton College, also has been enrolled 
at the University of Nevada Reno and Cypress College. 
</P>
<P>
The right-handed hitting Short has had an outstanding season for the Hornets, 
batting .327 with 12 home runs, 13 doubles and 56 runs batted in. Short and his 
Fullerton teammates hope to continue their success when they play Moorpark in 
the Southern California Regional playoffs at 11 a.m. Friday at Riverside 
College. The playoffs continue Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Short's travels started after graduation from Esperanza High in 1988. He had 
excelled as a baseball player in high school and was an All-Empire League 
selection at designated hitter. However, his first love was football, so he 
accepted a football scholarship from Nevada Reno. 
</P>
<P>
But Short's collegiate football career ended before it started when he suffered 
a pinched nerve in his neck while in high school. The injury prevented him from 
passing the basic physical at Reno. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me that if I got hit just right I'd be in a wheelchair," Short said. 
"That didn't sound like too good an option." 
</P>
<P>
Short, 6-feet-2 and 220 pounds, was offered a partial scholarship and a chance 
to play baseball at Reno, but decided to return home and attend Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
He started well for Cypress as the designated hitter but eventually slumped. He 
was removed from the starting lineup and pinch hit occasionally. Short hit .242 
(16 for 66) with four home runs and 10 RBIs and struck out 24 times. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pressing to do too much," Short said. "It seemed like there was 
something on the line with every at-bat and I wanted to do too much." 
</P>
<P>
Tired of being seen as just the designated hitter, Short decided to switch to 
Fullerton in an effort to change his role. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach (Nick Fuscardo) said that I would be the guy at first," Short said. "So 
I decided to come here. Also, the commute was getting too much. It took me an 
hour and 15 minutes to get there (Cypress). It only takes 15 minutes to get 
here (Fullerton)." 
</P>
<P>
This season, Short started slowly and was troubled by a familiar problem -- 
chasing breaking pitches below his knees. After 15 games, he was hitting .240 
with three home runs and 18 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
He continued to work, and things came together during a three-game stretch 
March 6-10. Short went seven for 11 with four home runs and 15 RBIs, and raised 
his average to .311. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an aggressive guy," Fuscardo said. "It's just a matter of him making sure 
he gets a good pitch to hit." 
</P>
<P>
The streak was reminiscent of one in high school. Short was 16 for 16 in his 
first four Empire League games and hit .552 with five home runs for the year. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always tried to be a consistent hitter," Short said. "Sometimes I just 
explode and things just start to go really well." 
</P>
<P>
Short proved his steadiness with a 16-game hitting streak in conference. He hit 
in 21 of 24 Orange Empire games. 
</P>
<P>
Short is being recruited by Loyola Marymount, and also is looking forward to 
the professional draft, June 4-6. 
</P>
<P>
He hopes to be drafted for the third consecutive season. He was selected in the 
late rounds by the Astros last June, but the team made no offer to sign him. He 
was drafted after high school in the 19th round by the Phillies, but had no 
plans to continue his baseball career, so he ignored the draft. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he's very interested in the draft. After all, it would give him another 
chance to move. 
</P>
<P>
In Friday's first-round games at Riverside: 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (26-14) vs. Moorpark (24-12), 11 a.m. -- Fullerton has recovered from 
a mid-season skid to win eight of its past 10. Steve Trachsel (8-3) took two 
weeks off because of a tired arm, then pitched a complete-game 4-2 victory 
Friday over College of the Canyons. Maybe the most important news was the 
performance of pitcher Matt Lipscomb (3-3) Saturday. He allowed five runs in 
the third but only one hit the rest of the way as Fullerton won, 9-5. Lipscomb 
now will become the third starter, something Fullerton searched for all season. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark, a tri-champion in the Western State Conference, is making its first 
playoff appearance in 15 seasons and the second in the history of the college. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago (34-10) vs. Riverside (29-15), 3 p.m. -- Rancho Santiago 
defeated Riverside in three of the four conference meetings, but that's about 
all the good news for the Dons. Second baseman Rob Reimers was hit by a pitch 
in practice Monday and has a broken left arm. He'll be replaced by Wayne Hefft, 
who hasn't played for over six weeks. Rancho Santiago also had to replace 
shortstop Ed Renteria (leg injury) seven games into the season. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Matt Lackie (10-3), who is coming back from a viral infection that 
sidelined him for three weeks, is strong and should start the first game. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to paint a big red cross on our bus," Rancho Santiago Coach Don 
Sneddon joked. "We're a traveling M.A.S.H. unit right now." 
</P>
<P>
In Friday's first-round games at Cerritos College: 
</P>
<P>
Golden West (27-12-1) vs. San Bernardino Valley (31-13), 11 a.m. -- Golden West 
was perhaps the most impressive team in the first round of the playoffs. The 
Rustlers got complete games from Todd Long (8-3) and Jason Hutchins (6-2). 
</P>
<P>
Long pitched a six-hitter and Golden West won, 4-0, in the first game against 
Cuesta. Hutchins came back with a five-hitter the next day as Golden West won, 
8-2. San Bernardino Valley advanced by beating Los Angeles Mission twice last 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West's team speed should come in handy at Cerritos, one of the largest 
parks in California. It's 365 feet down the lines and nearly 420 in center 
field. The Rustlers led the Orange Empire Conference in triples with 34. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Harbor (45-6) vs. Rio Hondo (22-17), 3 p.m. -- Harbor is the 
favorite to take the regional, but Rio Hondo already has one upset in the 
playoffs. Rio Hondo took two of three from second-seeded Cerritos last weekend 
at Cerritos.
