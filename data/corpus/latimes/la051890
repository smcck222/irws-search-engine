<P>
Ironically, we are faced with a situation where gridlock isn't slowing us down 
but actually speeding up our arrival with disaster. 
</P>
<P>
It is time we focus our energies towards solutions instead of creative ways to 
occupy our time while stuck in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
I can't count how many times I've longed to be on a commuter train, reading, 
rather than inhaling pollutants from hundreds of cars around me. My eyes and 
lungs burn to the point of having to keep my windows shut. 
</P>
<P>
Props. 111 and 108 are solutions that will produce noticeable results from our 
conscious efforts. I intend to vote yes on Props. 111 and 108.

After thinking about the gas tax hikes that are on the ballot, I have come to 
the realization that it would be foolish to vote for them. 
</P>
<P>
All you have to do is look at the ridiculous building on the Harbor Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
With the money Caltrans is spending for the double-decking how many miles of 
monorail could be built? They could even use the same right of way as they are 
using now. 
</P>
<P>
If car-pooling would work, we wouldn't need the double-decking. We also do not 
need any more buses. They cannot and do not serve the people very well. 
</P>
<P>
I think the people know that if state officials get their hands on any of the 
money they will do as they darn well please, no matter what type of regulations 
have been attached to the bill. 
</P>
<P>
I always thought that all this talk was to get the cars off the road and get 
mass transportation for the people to take them where they need and when they 
need to go in a reasonable time and at a reasonable cost. But I guess this is 
not to be.

There they go again. The environmentalists have placed another animal on the 
endangered species list. 
</P>
<P>
It is called the red squirrel. I wonder how much longer it will be before the 
mosquitoes, flies, ants and cockroaches are on their list. It seems like the 
environmentalist won't be satisfied until the animals and insects are in 
complete control and we are all out of work.

Your May 14 editorial ("Making a Case for Car-Pool Lanes") chastises Orange 
County for not enacting a "transit tax" as in neighboring Riverside County. 
Orange County voters have twice rejected a sales tax increase, and may reject 
Prop. 111 due to specific projects it would fund. 
</P>
<P>
The last I heard, we live in a democracy and it is our prerogative to vote for 
or against a measure based on merit. 
</P>
<P>
Car-pool lanes have proved controversial, if not unpopular. Caltrans and the 
Orange County Transportation Commission steadfastly refuse to permit an A-B 
comparison study of mixed-use and car-pool lanes in such key areas as traffic 
efficiency, cost-effectiveness and safety. 
</P>
<P>
Give Orange County resident some credit. We see gridlocked freeways, 
comparatively empty car-pool lanes, and plenty of self-serving statistics. 
</P>
<P>
A no vote on Prop. 111 will send a message to the transportation mavens that 
"enough is enough."

Our "environmental" President should sit down with Lujan, who says, "Nobody's 
told me the difference between the red squirrel, a black one, or a brown one," 
and explain what the Endangered Species Act is about. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, it is all about endangered red squirrels and hundreds of other 
species already listed as endangered or threatened or awaiting action by the 
Fish and Wildlife Service to save them from extinction. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan complains that the act is "too tough" and then asks, plaintively, "Do we 
have to save every subspecies?" The answer, Mr. Secretary, is yes, we must try. 
</P>
<P>
The bear on California's state flag should remind us of what we have done to 
some of our species. It is a grizzly. And it is extinct in California and in 
most other states where it once roamed. Hundreds of other mammals, birds, 
reptiles and other animals have been lost in the inexorable drive to cut down 
our forests, fill in our wetlands and destroy millions of acres of other plant 
and animal habitats.

PLEASURE IN THEIR COMPANY

Nothing tells us so much about ourselves as the things in which we take 
pleasure. But, relentless categorizers that we are, we classify even these: 
Some we call harmless; others, guilty pleasures. 
</P>
<P>
A few are more special yet. Wednesday, two men died who have given us pleasures 
of that latter sort -- the sort in which we can take pride. 
</P>

Sammy Davis Jr., who was 64, described himself as "a saloon entertainer," who 
had earned his audience's respect "because people say . . . 'he's always going 
to give you your money's worth.' " But, quintessential song-and-dance man 
though he was, he gave something more. He tirelessly brought his enormous gifts 
to bear on the struggle to force the American conscience to come to grips with 
the indignity and dishonor of racial discrimination. If that's the sort of 
entertainment to be had in saloons, make ours a double.

Jim Henson, who was 53, took an ancient diversion, puppeteering, and turned it 
into an expressive art made wholly new by its wit and warmth. Since their debut 
in 1969, the characters he created for "Sesame Street" have fanned out across 
the globe to instruct and delight children in 80 countries. Henson's 
sensibility married a child's heart and an adult's conscience. His puppets' 
appeal transcended generations because they reminded us of the children we once 
were, and suggested to our children what they might hope to be.

RECYCLING: THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR EASING THE GARBAGE CRUSH LIES WITH PRODUCT 
MANUFACTURERS TO DESIGN RENEWABLE PACKAGING.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL SHRIVASTAVA, Paul Shrivastava is a management professor and 
editor-in-chief of Industrial Crisis Quarterly, Bucknell University. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Each year we generate more than 150 million tons of garbage, in the form of 250 
million tires, 2 billion disposable batteries, 28 billion glass bottles and 
jars, 50 million tons of paper and 18 billion disposable diapers. We then dump 
these materials into one of our overburdened waste sites where they sit for 
hundreds of years. This year 50% of our cities will run out of landfill space 
to store these treasures. We are in the throes of a garbage crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The worst part of this problem is that we are headed down the wrong track to 
its solution. Corporations, government agencies and environmentalists have 
enthusiastically endorsed the idea that recycling is the solution. This is 
wrongheaded for two reasons. First, actual levels of recycling in the United 
States are abysmally low. Less than 5% of garbage generated is recycled. We 
generate more trash each month that we recycle each year. 
</P>
<P>
Second, all this talk of recycling has conditioned the American public to 
believe that it alone is responsible for the problem and for finding the 
solution. Consumers are not the source of garbage; they only discard the excess 
that manufacturers put into products. Waste disintegrates so slowly because 
most products and packages are highly over-engineered by manufacturers. Primary 
responsibility for the solution should be in their hands, where it rightly 
belongs. They design the containers that are built to outlast the pyramids. 
Certainly, it is easier to regulate a few thousand manufacturers than to 
coordinate the recycling efforts of 200 million consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Recycling is a useful idea that needs to be encouraged, but should not be 
mistaken for a solution. Besides, it is impossible to effectively recycle 
significant amounts of waste without investing in an expensive recycling 
infrastructure. Countries like Japan that have developed successful recycling 
programs have done so by providing a variety of laws, monitoring agencies, 
municipal services, equipment, personnel and information to make them work. 
</P>
<P>
Recycling also heavily depends on action by citizens. This dependence on 
voluntarism is the Achilles heel of the entire idea of recycling. Let's face 
it: Can a society in which less than half the people vote or fill out census 
forms be expected to voluntarily recycle its garbage? Probably not. 
</P>
<P>
The real solution to the garbage crisis lies in not generating unnecessary 
garbage in the first place. Product manufacturers think of disposability as 
producing inexpensive and short-life products that consumers can afford to 
simply throw away. They need to rethink this concept. Product design should 
seek to minimize not only the cost of the product, but also the cost of 
disposing it. The real cost of disposing a product, such as a tire or battery, 
is incurred over hundreds of years of its useless life in landfills, and may be 
more than the cost of the product itself. 
</P>
<P>
Packaging manufacturers need to design materials that are relative to expected 
product life. If the time taken from production to consumption, of coffee, or 
detergent, or soft drinks, is six months, do we need to wrap them in material 
that lasts for 500 years? 
</P>
<P>
Consumers can help by substituting disposable products with renewable ones 
whenever possible. In fact, renewable products often turn out to be less 
expensive in the long run. For example, used over five years, an electric razor 
costs about $15 per year. Disposable razors cost about $35 per year and also 
generate 750 pieces of plastic and metal, as opposed to one piece of waste from 
an electric razor. 
</P>
<P>
If we fail to implement effective garbage control strategies, we may invite the 
fate envisioned by a satirist paraphrasing Robert Frost: 
</P>
<P>
 Some say the world will end in fire 
</P>
<P>
 Some say in ice, 
</P>
<P>
But at the risk of sounding sarcastic, 
</P>
<P>
 I say the world will choke on plastic.

AFTER BOTH SIDES PRESERVE THEIR WELFARE PROGRAMS, BUSH WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT 
TO ABANDON HIS "NO NEW TAXES" STAND.

<P>
O, what a tangled web it weaves, when first the Bush Administration practices 
to deceive. 
</P>
<P>
Why is the President about to abandon his "read my lips" doctrine? Do not be 
fooled by the sudden "concern" on the part of Bush about the budget deficit, 
which in combination with the "no new taxes" pledge has served the 
Administration's stated ends admirably. After all, the combination of "no new 
taxes" and the Gramm-Rudman constraints on borrowing has yielded a dramatic 
decline in the growth rate of federal spending, particularly as a proportion of 
gross national product. Is that not what Bush wants? 
</P>
<P>
No, we must dig deeper. Let us return to the beginning of the year, when the 
Administration's proposed budget assumed a decline in real interest rates and 
continued strong economic growth. This allowed Budget Director Richard Darman 
and other Administration pooh-bahs to view potential spending reductions under 
Gramm-Rudman with a certain smugness; any cuts in defense would be no greater 
than those likely to be forced by Congress in any event in light of the new 
security environment. And some small cuts in domestic programs would 
demonstrate "toughness." 
</P>
<P>
What a difference a few months make. That this fiscal "conservatism" was cheap 
has been made painfully obvious by the stark reality that the economic 
assumptions in the budget have come a-cropper. Real interest rates have gone up 
while economic growth is down. Accordingly, what looked like a small or 
moderate reduction -- at most, about $25 billion -- now has turned into an 
$80-billion monster. 
</P>
<P>
From the standpoint of the Administration, it now is impolite to mention all 
that old talk about bloated government and Democrat profligacy, however true it 
was on its own terms. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the time has come for a budget summit with "no preconditions" because 
good, solid Republican welfare programs are in danger. There are the 
Export-Import Bank subsidies, largely a trough for aircraft manufacturers. 
There is the super-conducting super-collider, a multibillion-dollar toy; pull 
the cord and it emits a siren song for the Texas vote in the Electoral College. 
There is the space station, a boondoggle with no defined purpose other than 
provision of busywork for the space shuttles, themselves justified years ago as 
needed adjuncts for the future space station. There are the subsidies for the 
ubiquitous water projects, without which the Army Corps of Engineers actually 
might have to find honest work. And let us not fail to mention the various farm 
subsidy programs, the source of higher food prices, enormous resource waste, 
considerable environmental damage, many, many billions in spending and a good 
number of Republican votes. And do we really need such large armed forces under 
current international conditions? 
</P>
<P>
The Administration hopes that a decline in the deficit will reduce interest 
rates, but that effect will be small. The only way to make it big will be to 
increase taxes in such a way as to reduce business investment, but that will 
hardly be salutary for the economy as a whole. And all this talk about enhanced 
budgetary "control" for the Administration as an outcome of the budget summit 
is just so much hot air. The line-item veto, for example, assumes that 
Presidents systematically will be willing to take the political heat for 
cutting while others get the credit for saying "yes." Don't bet on it. 
</P>
<P>
And George Bush -- a man without clear thoughts on policies in particular or 
policy in general -- is most unlikely to do so. Consider the forthcoming 
avalanche of Democratic welfare. He will not veto the clean air bill, a blob of 
pork that will guarantee bankruptcy for small businesses, even as it does 
little for air quality but much for various special interest groups and the 
coercive authority of aspiring bureaucrats. He will not veto the civil rights 
bill, a measure that has little to do with "civil rights" but which will force 
the nation to adopt racial quotas as a matter of course. He will not veto the 
Americans with Disabilities Act, a guarantee of full employment for the 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
The much-ballyhooed budget summit will produce little or nothing in terms of 
true spending reduction, just as an identical exercise in 1982 did not. This is 
sad because, as a crude generalization, Democratic welfare hurts the poor but 
expands the bureaucracy, while Republican welfare creates troughs at which only 
white elephants feed. Some excise taxes are likely to rise, providing more fuel 
for the federal spending machine. And the Gramm-Rudman deadlines will be 
allowed to slip, thus removing another constraint on spending. If you read 
Bush's lips, you will find that he cares more about special-interest largess 
than about taxes, new or old. That is, until he reads the opinion polls. Taxes, 
anyone?

NCAA WOMEN'S TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIP;

STANFORD'S NO. 3 GRAHAM IS NO. 1 IN THE NATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN HERBERT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stanford's Debbie Graham wasn't second-fiddle in a season in which the Cardinal 
was 29-0 and national team champion. 
</P>
<P>
She was third-fiddle, behind No. 1 Meredith McGrath and reigning national 
singles champion Sandra Birch. 
</P>
<P>
But on Thursday, Graham, a graduate of Los Amigos High in Fountain Valley, 
finished the year No. 1 in the nation, defeating Nicole Arendt of Florida, 6-3, 
6-3, to win the NCAA Women's Tennis Championships at Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath lost in the tournament's second round, and Graham upset Birch in 
Wednesday's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Graham said her being overlooked was a motivating factor. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever anyone ever thinks about Stanford tennis, it's always Sandra and 
Meredith and I'm sitting at No. 3," Graham said. "I'm the No. 3 player in the 
middle and no one ever cares. I wanted to prove to everyone that Stanford is 
not just its one and two players." 
</P>
<P>
Graham did not lose a set during the tournament, but Arendt had a far more 
difficult route to the finals. She was extended to three sets in both Tuesday's 
quarterfinals and Wednesday's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"I was tired, but tried not to think about it," Arendt said. "I would say 
something carried over (from the semifinals)." 
</P>
<P>
Both players remained on serve until the eighth game, when Graham recorded the 
only service break of the first set. 
</P>
<P>
"The first set was so important for me to win," Graham said, "because I started 
off the match, and I don't remember a time where I've ever been so nervous. I 
was thinking about so many different things. I felt that she was really nervous 
in the beginning too." 
</P>
<P>
Graham, seeded sixth, broke Arendt in the first and third games of the second 
set taking a 4-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't serving extremely well at all today," said Arendt, who got just 53% 
of her first serves in compared to 60% by Graham. "I missed a lot of first 
serves and second serves were landing short." 
</P>
<P>
Arendt, the seventh seed, was able to break Graham's serve twice, pulling to 
within 5-3, before Graham served out the match. 
</P>
<P>
"I have this tendency to get up sometimes and then choke," Grahm said. "I start 
looking ahead." 
</P>
<P>
"When I was down, 5-3, I thought there was a shot, there was a little light, 
but she blew it out real fast," Arendt said. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA title is Graham's second important tournament victory in as many 
months. She defeated McGrath in the final of last month's Pacific 10 Tournament 
in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
"After I won the Pac-10s, people kept coming up to me and said that it's 
tradition that the winner of the Pac-10s goes on to win the nationals," Graham 
said. "I wasn't looking ahead that far, but it kind of made me nervous, so I 
tried to put it into the back of my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Graham and Birch lost to their top-seeded Stanford teammates McGrath and Teri 
Whitlinger, 4-6, 7-5, 6-2, in the doubles finals. 
</P>
<P>
Graham, a sophomore, says she will stay in school until getting a degree and 
then join the professional tour. This summer, she plans on playing in U.S. 
Tennis Assn. satellite tour events.

In other Metro games: 
</P>
<P>
Southwest 6, Mar Vista 5 -- Southwest made the most of four hits, scoring the 
go-ahead run in the top of the seventh, to tie Montgomery for the league title. 
Rafael Padilla had the game-winning hit, a single to left that drove in Dan 
Silva, who reached on one of five Mar Vista errors. Southwest tied for the 
title after winning just two nonconference games. 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater 8, Bonita Vista 1 -- Frank Castro hit a two-run homer to lead 
Sweetwater to its 20th victory against eight defeats, which might be enough for 
an at-large playoff berth. Sweetwater finished fourth in league at 8-6. Bonta 
Vista finished fifth at 7-7 (13-13 overall). 
</P>
<P>
Hilltop 6, Chula Vista 2 -- After forfeiting 17 victories for using an 
ineligible player, Hilltop (2-24, 2-12) has won two in a row. Chula Vista 
finished 10-15-1, 5-9. 
</P>
<P>
City Harbor League 
</P>
<P>
Coronado 6, Clairemont 3 -- Scott Dickerson hit a two-out, two-strike, grand 
slam in the top of the sixth to power Coronado in a second-place playoff game. 
Both Coronado (17-8) and Clairemont (15-13) finished 8-4 in league, one game

HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP;

<P>
GIL MASTERS MONTGOMERY FOR CASTLE PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Castle Park's Benji Gil didn't seem overly impressed with his four-hit, 3-0 
victory over Montgomery High Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
He rated it just his third-best performance this season -- behind a one-hit, 
5-0 victory over Carlsbad and a two-hit, 1-0 decision against Monte Vista. 
</P>
<P>
It is easy to see why Gil, a junior right-hander, leads the county in 
earned-run average at 0.55. 
</P>
<P>
In overpowering co-Metro Conference champion Montgomery, Gil (6-3) carried a 
no-hitter into the sixth before allowing four singles in the final two innings. 
He also struck out eight, giving him 89 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
But those weren't the impressive numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery managed to "hit" just two balls to the left side of the field. The 
first didn't occur until the fourth inning. It was a check-swing blooper that 
diving shortstop Raul Molina snared over his head as it headed for left field. 
The other was a weak grounder to Molina. 
</P>
<P>
A third baseman, left fielder and center fielder essentially were of no use to 
Gil. 
</P>
<P>
"He showed us why he's the best," Montgomery Coach Manuel Hermosillo said. 
"That's why he's got that oh-five-something ERA." 
</P>
<P>
Said Kiko Palacios, Castle Park's catcher: "There are times he's thrown better 
pitches and had to work less." 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery's Mike Arroyo (5-4) was effective as well. He allowed only five 
singles, but three came in a three-run fifth with two outs. 
</P>
<P>
After two singles and a hit-by-pitch (Gil), Palacios, a sophomore hitting .447, 
lined a two-run single to left that was misplayed and thrown around enough for 
Gil to score all the way from first. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the loss, Montgomery completed one of the greatest turnarounds in the 
30-year history of the San Diego Section. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs finished 10th in the 10-team Metro last year. This year, with six of 
eight Metro teams playing .500 or better on the field (Hilltop had to forfeit 
17 games), Montgomery is 19-8 and 11-3. Southwest, a 6-5 winner over Mar Vista, 
is 13-12, 11-3, Castle Park (19-10, 8-4) finished third. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery and Southwest will play today at Hilltop High at 3 p.m. to determine 
the league's top seeding for the 3-A playoffs. The loser is also assured a 
playoff spot, and Castle Park, playing its best baseball of the season, 
probably wrapped up one of eight at-large berths in the 16-team draw. JIM

LA JOLLA BOYS: TENNIS TEAM THAT REFUSES TO GO AWAY;

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has been 19 years, but the cheers of a crowd at the Los Angeles Tennis Club 
still ring in Russ Lanthorne's ears. 
</P>
<P>
There were oohs and ahs and outbreaks of applause as his La Jolla High tennis 
players hit winning shots against a heavily favored opponent. Lanthorne, now 
63, remembers how an awed crowd gathered because of curiosity and grew with 
delight. They were cheering for his boys. 
</P>
<P>
The sounds still echo inside his head, the wild hooting, then the hush. 
</P>
<P>
Lanthorne, 10 years removed from coaching, thinks of what might have been. He 
had what he called, "the greatest high school team in history. 
</P>
<P>
"It all came down to the last match. We were leading the third set, 4-1, and 
serving . . . and we lost." 
</P>
<P>
The story was not the loss. The story was that La Jolla's opponent that 
afternoon in 1971 was USC, a team that went on to finish fourth in the NCAA 
that year. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans, with their backs against a wall, pulled out a 5-4 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of those things," Lanthorne said. "The kid from USC just started 
playing better. He might have realized he'd better win." 
</P>
<P>
Funny. That match, and two others La Jolla played against top college teams 
that year, are now just nice little pieces of trivia for a high school tennis 
program that has known few bounds in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla also lost to 1971 NCAA champion Stanford, 8-1, and UCLA, 7-2. 
Lanthorne said the matches only took place because his players were so heavily 
recruited by those teams. Six La Jolla players received full-ride scholarships 
to Division I schools that year. 
</P>
<P>
Raul Ramirez, later ranked seventh in the world in singles, and John Holladay 
went to USC. Chico Hagey moved on to Stanford. Steve Mott wound up at UCLA. Ted 
Hagey and Alex Hernandez signed with Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-two La Jolla players received full rides in Lanthorne's 13 seasons as 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla has won 18 of the past 20 San Diego Section boys' team championships, 
22 of the 29 titles recorded since 1961 and 15 in a row from 1970 to 1984. 
Nineteen championships were before the section established separate Division 
2-A and 3-A tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
But La Jolla, a 2-A school, continues to beat all comers. It heads into the 
Western League team tournament Monday with a 21-0 record. In two years under 
Coach Ryk Bjork, La Jolla is 42-0. If all goes according to plan, La Jolla, 
which has also been runner-up twice, will win the 1990 section team title May 
25. 
</P>
<P>
Five La Jolla singles players have won section individual championships; eight 
have finished runner-up. In doubles, La Jolla has won 15 of 27 recorded section 
titles -- records from 1968 and 1969 are not available -- and has had 12 teams 
lose in the final. In fact, one La Jolla team has beaten another for the 
championship seven times. 
</P>
<P>
Lanthorne remembers how his players used to fear not winning the section each 
year. Bjork now fears they take it too lightly. Before last year's team final, 
Bjork's players took the court wearing T-shirts that already proclaimed them 
1989 champs. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew it would be a major upset if we didn't win it," Bjork said, "but I 
brutalized them for that." 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla was taken to a third-set tiebreaker in the No. 1 singles match, worth 
two points, before claiming its third consecutive title, 7 1/2-3 1/2. Sophomore 
David Smith beat St. Augustine's Ignacio Martinez at No. 1 singles, 6-4, 2-6, 
7-6 (7-5). 
</P>
<P>
Bjork, 25, in his second year as coach, also works as a pro at the Hilton 
Tennis Club. He is the sixth coach La Jolla has had since 1961. He says 
coaching La Jolla is not the challenge he expected, so he's resigning after 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Many of his 16 players are ranked among Southern California's top juniors. His 
No. 1 singles player, Smith, was ranked 22nd in the U.S. as a 16-year-old last 
year. He has James Conda, ranked second in Southern California as a 14-year-old 
in 1989, and Jon Elsberry, who was 20th among Southern California 16-year-olds 
and won a national mixed doubles championship last year. All three were part of 
La Jolla's section team in 1989. None are seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Then along came Simon Kurth, who played No. 1 singles at The Bishop's School 
last year and Tim Kreysing, an exchange student who was ranked 10th among 
15-year-olds in his native West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Even Kreysing, who has been in America just a few months, expects La Jolla to 
have an easy time winning its fourth consecutive section championship. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't lose," he said. "We've got three of the six best 18-year-olds in San 
Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Bjork admits that with all the talent, he has little more to do than bring out 
new balls for every match and pick up the trophy at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
He says his role in the team's success has been "pretty minimal." 
</P>
<P>
Times have certainly changed since Lanthorne, a retired math teacher, took over 
a losing program in the mid-'60s and wound up putting La Jolla on the same 
court as USC, UCLA and Stanford. During one stretch, La Jolla won 155 
consecutive matches. Before he stepped down after the 1979 season, Lanthorne 
had coached 10 consecutive section champions. 
</P>
<P>
But Lanthorne was an old-fashion whip-cracker. He made his players practice 
from 1 to 6 p.m. daily and put them through marathon best-of-three-set 
challenge matches. Bjork runs practices, too. But usually only six players will 
show up. The rest work on their game with a private coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked the kids very hard, and they were extremely proud of that," Lanthorne 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Bjork's players are so advanced, having them practice with the team 
would only inhibit their progress. He is more concerned with keeping them 
focused and motivated during matches. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm trying to do anything, it's to make them better people," Bjork said. "I 
encouraged the kids to go with their coaches. But at the same time, it's gotten 
kind of frustrating for me. I'd like to utilize my abilities." 
</P>
<P>
Said Smith: "I think Ryk's been perfect. He pumps us up when we need to be 
pumped, and he's always focused on what needs to be done. He's a great coach." 
</P>
<P>
From the outside looking in, Bjork has a great job. Just ask Paul Rubens, coach 
of Western League opponent University City, who faced La Jolla as a player at 
Mission Bay and was once in line to coach there himself before he had to turn 
down the job because of a teaching conflict. 
</P>
<P>
"This is no knock on (Bjork), but that team will win regardless of who's 
coaching," Rubens said. "It's an ideal situation. It's the best tennis 
community anywhere in the country. You've got kids who are really motivated and 
a community that's 110% behind you. (The players) have the best facilities and 
the best equipment. They have money." 
</P>
<P>
Not only has La Jolla turned out some of the best talent San Diego has seen, it 
has become a tennis mecca for outsiders. Many of the current La Jolla team's 
best players either moved to La Jolla as teen-agers or have transfered in from 
other communities. 
</P>
<P>
"Talent attracts talent," said Rubens, whose UC team was the last to beat La 
Jolla in a league match in 1986. "They have families that house tennis players 
from out of the city and out of the county. Some people say it's recruiting. It 
borders on it." 
</P>
<P>
Conda, a sophomore, lives with Elsberry during school months and visits his 
family, which lives in Paradise Hills, only a couple of days a week. But Conda, 
like others, said he had reasons other than tennis for attending La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents didn't want me to go to Morse," he said. "I didn't know about all 
of this before I got here." 
</P>
<P>
Smith transfered to La Jolla last year as a sophomore after winning the 
Southern Conference singles title as a La Jolla Country Day freshman. He said 
he didn't like the smallness of a private school. 
</P>
<P>
Kurth and doubles partner John Bucher both left Bishop's, he said, because of 
the high tuition. 
</P>
<P>
"It was quite a financial strain," said Kurth, who lives in Clairemont. "School 
is a top priority and La Jolla is a very strong academic school. It's just a 
very lucky thing they have such a good tennis team." 
</P>
<P>
Kreysing, who plays No. 1 doubles with Jimmy Brown, said he had no choice of 
where he would land in the states when he signed up for the exchange program in 
Hamburg. 
</P>
<P>
"I've no idea how I got to La Jolla," he said. "I got lucky, I guess. I could 
have ended up in Kansas." 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla has won several matches this season without any of those guys. That's 
how deep the talent is. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll get in trouble for this, but they could probably beat Point Loma College 
and USIU, maybe UCSD," Rubens said. 
</P>
<P>
As good as it is, La Jolla likely won't take this year's section tournament as 
lightly as it did last year. Had Smith lost his match to Martinez, it would 
have put La Jolla and St. Augustine into a tiebreaker situation. He couldn't 
bear the thought of not being able to hold up tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought about the dynasty," he said. "I was down, 5-4. Ryk came up and said, 
'Well, I think if he wins, we lose.' It was pretty hairy." 
</P>

<P>
Stock prices resumed their upward march Thursday to close at a record high 
after a mild setback Wednesday, overcoming persistent weakness in the bond 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said stocks were bolstered ahead of today's expiration of key stock 
options, which could free up new buying power. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, off 2.77 on Wednesday, rose 12.03 points 
to 2,831.71. 
</P>
<P>
Gainers beat losers in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed 
stocks, with 832 up, 649 down and 505 unchanged. Big Board volume totaled 
164.77 million shares, against Wednesday's 159.81 million. 
</P>
<P>
The market's advance was tempered by weak bond prices for the third straight 
day. Bonds slipped on the belief that the Federal Reserve plans no imminent 
lowering of interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Most of stocks' gains came early in the day, encouraged by a brief drop in 
open-market interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow traded in about a 26-point range, after brushing aside news that the 
U.S. trade deficit widened to $8.45 billion in March from a revised $6.1 
billion gap in February. The report said exports reached record levels but that 
imports also soared. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said investors continued to hunt for bargains among stocks expected to 
show strong earnings growth in the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Some big gainers among Southland stocks included Western Waste, up 1 7/8 to 37 
1/2; Unitrin, up 1 3/4 to 32 3/4; Price Club, up 1 7/8 to 37 1/2; and Software 
Toolworks, up 1 7/8 to 17 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
Gap Inc. fell 2 1/2 to 66 1/2, amid some evident disappointment with earnings 
for the company's fiscal quarter ended May 5: 60 cents a share, against 43 
cents a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stocks closed firmer, helped by a strong yen. But an absence of new 
market factors drove more and more players to the sidelines. The Nikkei 
225-share index added 93.98 points to close at 32,061.60. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks closed mixed in Frankfurt, West Germany, after a volatile session. The 
30-share DAX index closed 0.19 point lower at 1,841.58. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CREDIT 
</P>
<P>
Bond Prices Fall Over Credit Policy 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices fell moderately after indications that the Federal Reserve was not 
easing credit policy. 
</P>
<P>
The bellwether 30-year bond slipped 3/16 or about $1.87 per $1,000 face amount, 
after losing around $1.50 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Its yield, which moves inversely to the price, edged up to 8.64% from 8.63% 
late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Prices had moved higher in early trading after the Commerce Department released 
the trade deficit report for March. 
</P>
<P>
The deficit was larger than expected, but analysts said the market shrugged off 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Reiners, a vice president for money market research at Dean Witter 
Reynolds Inc., said traders were looking for signs from the Fed that it would 
ease credit, thereby allowing interest rates to fall and bond prices to rise. 
</P>
<P>
However, the hoped-for signals never materialized, and investors decided to 
take some profits, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Trading was thin and exaggerated price movements, Reiners said. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.188%, up from 7.50% late Wednesday. The jump was due to 
technical factors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Shrugs Off Trade Deficit Report 
</P>
<P>
The dollar ended firmer against all key currencies except the British pound and 
Canadian dollar, even though the government reported that the U.S. trade 
deficit widened sharply in March. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers and analysts said the currency market generally shrugged off the trade 
report. "The trade number wasn't that far out of expectations to be a big 
enough deal," said Craig Sloane, a currency analyst with Smith Barney, Harris, 
Upham &amp; Co. "We're not talking about anything that shocking." 
</P>
<P>
Sloane said technical factors helped push up the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Platinum Rises on S. African Violence 
</P>
<P>
Platinum futures prices rose sharply amid reports of increased racial violence 
in South Africa, the world's largest platinum-producing country. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, gold and silver futures also advanced; copper 
futures were mixed; pork futures rose to the daily limit for the second 
straight day; soybeans rebounded from recent losses, and energy futures were 
mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Platinum futures settled $5.30 to $5.40 higher on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange, with the contract for delivery in July at $492.90 an ounce.

BEHIND THE WHEEL: HYBRID TURBOCHARGES ITS WAY TO CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The galloping Callaway Twin Turbo -- barred from California since creation 
because its builder chose not to chase state emission standards -- has cleaned 
up its act and has been cleared to sell locally. 
</P>
<P>
Watch out. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a 190-m.p.h. pacemaker to the heartbeat of America, a private-sector 
mutagenesis of a Chevrolet Corvette that accelerates faster than a Lamborghini 
Countach or a Porsche 911 Turbo. 
</P>
<P>
With twin turbochargers building almost 400 horsepower, the Callaway can outrun 
a Ferrari Testarossa -- and the terminal velocity of that particular Italian 
redhead just happens to be faster than liftoff speed of an F-16. 
</P>
<P>
The Callaway Twin Turbo is also relatively affordable, undisputedly exclusive 
and a hot rod in sheep's cladding that may be ordered alongside Luminas and 
Corsicas at your neighborhood Chevrolet dealer. 
</P>
<P>
This assigning of an RPO (Regular Production Option) designation to the 
Callaway says a lot for GM's tolerance and acceptance of an after-market hybrid 
clearly competing in price, performance and enthusiast appeal with Chevrolet's 
super fast (but still slower) Corvette ZR-1. 
</P>
<P>
And by tacit endorsement of the Twin Turbo, Chevrolet obviously is putting its 
reputation (also its 12-month and 12,000-mile powertrain warranty) behind a 
product that meets cherished standards of reliability for sports cars that -- 
like the thirtysomething Corvette and the yearling ZR-1 -- are docile enough 
for the 'burbs yet become absolute thrashers on interstates. 
</P>
<P>
The Callaway Twin Turbo rose from a 1985 misfit -- a turbocharged, experimental 
Corvette built for Chevrolet by an outside contractor. 
</P>
<P>
Chevrolet wasn't much thrilled by the prototype. But Connecticut engineer Ely 
Reeves Callaway III, former Formula Vee racer, descendant of Georgia Baptist 
preachers and Callaway Vineyards, saw it as the greatest potential for blinding 
motion since the $25 firecracker. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, with Chevrolet's blessing, Callaway was in limited production. 
Today there are some 400 Twin Turbos blowing off doors throughout 49 states. 
But not until last month's certification and satisfaction of California's 
bulletproof smog standards has the brute that purrs been available here. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, there's a limited market in the rest of the country for a high 
performance car such as this, and selling in California was the next logical 
step," said Roger Smith, managing director of Callaway Cars of Old Lyme, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, we are seeing the rest of the country moving towards adopting 
California's (emission) standards. So we thought we might as well do it 
(comply) and get it over with." 
</P>
<P>
Every Twin Turbo starts life as a stock Corvette equipped with the venerable 
but trusted small block Chevy V-8. The car is shipped to Callaway's Connecticut 
skunk works where moving parts are magnafluxed and balanced. Main bearings are 
worked over. Stainless steel valves, a forged crank and pistons and a new cam 
with hydraulic lifters are added. 
</P>
<P>
Then comes the heart transplant -- the addition of twin, intercooled 
turbochargers that boost the Corvette's standard 245 horsepower to 390 
horsepower, which actually is more like a stampede. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate proof of power, however, is this thing called torque -- the engine 
force that produces wheel rotation and vehicle motion. Torque is measured in 
terms of maximum oomph produced to move poundage over footage. 
</P>
<P>
The torque-feet of a Toyota Celica GT, for example, is 140 pounds-feet. The 
5.0-liter Ford Mustang puts out a very respectable 300-pounds-feet. But the 
Callaway Twin Turbo transmits a thumping 562-pounds-feet to its rear wheels and 
that's enough to leave divots in your driveway. 
</P>
<P>
For the discreet who do not wish to advertise, the Callaway Twin Turbo may be 
purchased as a coupe or convertible that externally is only a badge and a 
plaque removed from a stock Corvette. 
</P>
<P>
But the brash might choose an $8,500 Aerobody option that gives the car a row 
of flared nostrils and straked body ducts. It includes a new, slick, rounded, 
aerodynamic nose and a sculptured rear end that looks for all the world like a 
grown-up Miata with a ducktail. The whole is awfully handsome. Especially with 
the Dymag magnesium wheels. 
</P>
<P>
The interior of the car is pure 1990 Corvette. 
</P>
<P>
It also is an abomination. 
</P>
<P>
In their semicircular, Pac-Man setting, essential instruments are a mix-up of 
needles and digital readouts. Warning gauges, numbered to show only the 
extremes of their operating range, confuse before they inform. 
</P>
<P>
And then there is dash lettering that's a squint even for those with vision 
only one diopter removed from 20/20. Is this a radio we see before us? Or the 
climate control panel? Either way, the display is a litter of toy knobs and 
pitiful symbology. And the radio doesn't scan. 
</P>
<P>
On a happier note, the cockpit cuddles nicely, the seats feel rugged and hold 
well during spirited cornering, and like all Corvettes, the car comes with an 
air bag. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there is no doubting that this is a Callaway. It says so on a dash plaque 
(and in the true spirit of adventure and high-speed risk, the production number 
of the test car was 007) and a boost gauge for monitoring the twin 
turbochargers. 
</P>
<P>
The suspension remains untouched and stock Corvette. So does the car's 
six-speed manual transmission. Together, they give a surplus of performance 
management that does not diminish as speed builds but actually seems to improve 
with pace. 
</P>
<P>
But then the Corvette always has been a flat, determined, obedient ride. It has 
brakes (13-inch discs) to spare for late dives into interesting corners. More 
important, there's power aplenty to boot through and out of the turns. 
</P>
<P>
Today's Corvettes come with selective ride control (Tour-Sport-Performance) and 
at no time -- even if fishtailing, overcorrecting or losing some other portion 
of the car's geometry -- is there a shadow of suspension floats or steering 
dithers. 
</P>
<P>
To all of this, add a power plant designed and tuned to do little else but 
convert a two-place car into a drill boring 190-m.p.h. holes through the air. 
</P>
<P>
But forget that speed. It isn't important. It would also be fair to state that 
nobody who owns a Callaway has ever driven it at that speed. Or will. Then why 
have it? 
</P>
<P>
Because an inordinately quick top end is simply the byproduct of searching for 
a stupendous mid-range where most mortals live. And it is here -- entering 
freeways, pulling clear of tailgaters, moving around the blind idiot cutting 
across our bows -- where the Callaway is simply astounding. 
</P>
<P>
It takes five seconds to accelerate from 60 m.p.h. to 100 m.p.h. It rockets 
from rest to 100 m.p.h. in a sniff over 10 seconds. And it is raw speed in a 
gentle hurtle where the power seems endless. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, smoothness is the pleasant surprise of the Twin Turbo. In town, in 
traffic, it's an easy drive. Shifting is a click and the clutch no heavier than 
a Honda. On the open road it's an enormous dose of docile power where the 
rear-view mirror can be forgotten because no other car will be fast enough to 
sneak up. 
</P>
<P>
That's not a Chevy. 
</P>
<P>
That's a Callaway. 
</P>
<P>

DOWN-HOME HAIR WAR FOUGHT IN THE TRESSES 
</P>

<P>
HAIRDO by Sarah Gilbert (Warner Books; $17.95, 256 pages) 
</P>
<P>
"Hairdo" is "Steel Magnolias" without the pathos; "Shampoo" sans Beatty; an 
antic Southern novel set entirely in Miss Ruby McSwain's Celebrity Styling Shop 
in the town of StuckeyC. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Ruby's only serious rival for the town's tresses is her cousin Gladys 
Bessinger, who owns the Tres Chic Salon directly across the square. The book 
would be perfect for reading under the dryer if the dryer hadn't gone the way 
of the dirigible and the snail darter. Still, in Stuckey, Dippity-Do outsells 
mousse and many of Miss Ruby's clients even insist upon a final spritz of Happy 
Hair: "not just hairspray . . . the real thing -- lacquer. And for those of you 
who don't know, and for those of you who forgot, lacquer will do the trick." 
</P>
<P>
As the novel opens, the Celebrity Styling Shop still is plastered with posters 
of convoluted updos, and the second busiest day of the week is Tuesday. If you 
have your hair cemented and baked into place on Tuesday, you can get through an 
entire week by sleeping with your head hanging over the bed, squashing the ruin 
under a hat for Sunday church, hiding all day Monday until Miss Ruby reopens 
the following morning. Of course, if there's a special event on Saturday, 
you'll visit the salon too, but Saturday is really reserved for the youngsters, 
while Tuesday is favored by the blue-rinse ladies, the backbone of both salons. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Miss Ruby hasn't been totally impervious to the passage of time, even 
though she dresses for work in floor-length evening gowns. In addition to 
veteran stylist Yvonne, who treats hair like meringue and bewails the advent of 
the natural look, Miss Ruby employs Thurston, who has gradually lured Yvonne's 
loyal patrons away with his magic blow dryer, reducing her virtually to shampoo 
girl. 
</P>
<P>
Thurston is flamboyantly gay and proud of it. Though he gets most of the 
customers and all the best lines, this characterization seems as dated as the 
beehive. The staff also includes Ronder Jeffcoat, who returns to work after her 
husband Buck turns out to be a major life mistake. Miss Ruby had warned her, 
and though she charitably takes Ronder back when Buck turns out to be good for 
nothing but swilling beer in front of the TV, Ronder is demoted to bikini 
waxing -- which, in the salon hierarchy, is tantamount to the mail room. (It's 
never clear why bikini waxing is so popular with the Dippity-Do crowd, none of 
whom could possibly have worn a bikini since 1950, if then, but let it go.) 
</P>
<P>
The plot, if that's the word, centers upon fierce competition between Miss Ruby 
and her cousin Gladys. After a brief closure for alterations, Gladys reopens 
with every one of her booths dedicated to a different European country, each 
manned, in a manner of speaking, by stylists named Raphael, Carlos, Trevor, 
Wilhelm, Tonino and Lars of Norway. 
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, Miss Ruby remodels the Celebrity Salon as the OK Hair Corral, 
outfitting Ronder, Yvonne and Thurston in cowboy and Indian costumes to 
administer the Wild Bill Hickok Cut, the Buffalo Bill Perm and the Billy the 
Kid Frosting Special. 
</P>
<P>
These radical innovations take place just as everyone is eagerly anticipating 
the annual Hair Show in Atlanta. By the time this crucial event rolls around, 
Thurston's lover Duran has returned from a short stretch in prison and is able 
to join the party traveling south for the hair Olympiad, a journey that 
provides further opportunities for the sort of adventure often called madcap. 
In addition to the usual crew, the Atlanta convoy includes an alcoholic hair 
model from New York and two extraneous fellow travelers who play exceedingly 
minor roles, proving that a comic novel doesn't need comic relief, but the 
precise opposite. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of a South Carolina fiction award, Gilbert is not only a "registered 
cosmetologist" herself but has also worked as a model, a bartender and a car 
painter before "realizing that her background was perfect for that of a fiction 
writer." 
</P>
<P>
She may have a point. The definitive novel about car painting is still 
unwritten.

ABC's 'Home': New Woman in Five Parts 
</P>
<P>
You've heard promises of the ultimate makeover before, but this time ABC's 
"Home" show delivers. Los Angeles resident Eileen Lizer has a whole new look 
from inside out. Plastic surgeon Dr. Harry Glassman (Mr. Victoria Principal) 
saw Lizer through a nose job and eye-area surgery back in January. Then, Lizer 
received a facial, had her hair cut, permed and colored and Los Angeles 
designer Carol Anderson provided a whole new wardrobe. The entire ordeal, 
including the reconstructive surgery, will be shown in five parts beginning 
Monday. Lizer, who will only admit to being thirtysomething, has wanted to 
revamp her look for years. Though, she says, others have always complimented 
her on her appearance, "I am absolutely thrilled with all of it. It was like 
the Wizard of Oz giving me a heart." 
</P>
<P>
CAL COMES TO SO. CAL: Calvin Klein is moving in next door to Anne Taylor on the 
second level of South Coast Plaza. The 4,500-square-foot shop, scheduled to 
open in October, will give South Coast Plaza another big name to add to it's 
growing list of designer stores. Later this summer Liz Claiborne and Chanel are 
moving in. 
</P>
<P>
TROUSSEAU TO GO: When Ford Motor Co. spokeswoman Lindsay Wagner saw the clothes 
that stylist Gale Evans brought to a recent commercial shoot, she just had to 
have four of the outfits. All were by Los Angeles designer Julia Gerard. A few 
days later Wagner stopped by Gerard's store on Melrose, J. Gerard, and picked 
up another armload of goodies to take to Bali, where she is honeymooning with 
film producer Larry Mortoff. 
</P>
<P>
LOOKING PALE: The Bain de Soleil model, Kriss Ziemer, is beginning to fade 
away. Her 10-year reign as the longest, leanest, tannest woman ever to lounge 
across the centerfold is not over. But, for the new decade, Ziemer wears a 
golden glow instead of her mahogany tan. The advertising shift to pale is a 
direct response to a survey Bain de Soleil conducted that found only 10% of 
women aged 21 to 50 thought a dark tan preferable to a healthy glow. 
</P>
<P>
DOGGY BAGS: Judith Leiber has made jeweled evening bags in just about every 
shape imaginable, including butterflies, hearts, fans, cats and the Hollywood 
sign. So when Barbara Bush sent Leiber a picture of First Dog Millie, it was a 
simple task for the designer to make a rhinestone-encrusted, gold-plated, 
dog-shaped purse in Millie's image. Retailer Amen Wardy so loved the idea that 
he is offering personalized pooch purses through his two stores in Southern 
California. So far, 10 women have come into Wardy's store with pictures of 
their dogs and Leiber is making them purses that resemble their pets. Those who 
wish to put on the dog take note: The 4-inch-tall bags sell for $2,195 each. 
</P>
<P>
EEEK! SPIDERS!: Frank Marshall, celebrating his directorial debut with this 
summer's release of "Arachnophobia" (fear of spiders), an Amblin-Hollywood 
Pictures thriller starring Jeff Daniels and John Goodman, is no longer bugged 
about what to give members of the cast and crew. While shopping at Sami Dinar 
for Men in Beverly Hills, Marshall found the perfect tie-in. He ordered dozens 
of spider motif ties by Howard Behar and black socks with a gray spider web on 
the ankle. "Spiders are going to be cute after this movie," predicts Dinar, who 
is planning a window display around images of the creepy crawlers.

Q: I'm 5-foot-10 and wear a Size 10 medium shoe. What style shoes should I wear 
with my strapless white taffeta prom dress? My date is also 5-foot-10, and I 
don't want to tower over him. 
</P>
<P>
The dress has a fitted bodice and long, full skirt. I plan to wear it with a 
white lace shawl. -- L.M. 
</P>
<P>
A: How about dancing the night away in ballet slippers? They're fashionable, 
comfortable and will make your date feel 10 feet tall -- well, almost. Those 
illustrated here are a new, improved version of the classic dance shoe. By Paul 
Mayer, they are designed with a ruffled top line to simulate the look of 
drawstrings and/or elasticizing. 
</P>
<P>
The shoes are available in white leather, bronze and gold metallic leather, 
black suede and black patent for $86.95. Any of the first three would look 
ideal with your dress. The shoes come in Sizes 5-10 medium at Nordstrom's San 
Francisco Center, 855 Market St., San Francisco, Calif. 94103. If you haven't 
already purchased the white lace shawl, how about giving the white a lift by 
wearing a gold shawl with gold ballet slippers?

Piscopo, Miller Beer Rapped: A New York federal judge has rapped Miller Brewing 
Co., its ad agency and comedian Joe Piscopo by refusing to dismiss a copyright 
infringement suit against them brought by the Fat Boys rap group. At issue is a 
nationally-broadcast Miller Brewing television commercial featuring Piscopo and 
three Fat Boys look-alikes performing in the group's distinctive style. The Fat 
Boys had refused to appear in the ad, and U.S. District Judge Charles Haight 
said Miller and Piscopo exercised "bad faith and evasive motive" by copying the 
group. GREG BRAXTON

FELTSMAN AT AMBASSADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Mussorgsky's finger-busting "Pictures at an Exhibition" is a work virtuoso 
pianists haul out when they want to show their chops. And their resources at 
the keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
Many succeed. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Feltsman, who has now used the familiar suite twice, in recitals at 
both the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at the Music Center (in January, 1989) and 
Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena (Wednesday night), does not exactly fail. He 
certainly sails through the piece, conquering its technical challenges gamely 
and indicating the scope of the composer's vision. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he does not take one's breath away with his achievement, or thrill the 
listener with his coloristic palette, or reflect glory on Mussorgsky's 
imagination. He merely gets through, neatly and competently. 
</P>
<P>
Why should he play the work at all, then? One tends to wonder. 
</P>
<P>
In his first Pasadena appearance, the 38-year old musician -- who came to this 
country in 1987 in a blaze of publicity -- actually presented himself in a 
better light than he did 16 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the 1,200-seat hall at Ambassador College flatters, rather than 
dampens, the sound of a grand piano, and creates an ambience of warmth and 
security for a recitalist. Pianists tend to sound their best in this 
atmosphere. And audiences feel close to the performer. 
</P>
<P>
Thus it was that Feltsman could show his best side in his playing of Busoni's 
much-loved (by pianists) transcription of Bach's D-minor Chaconne, which opened 
this recital. 
</P>
<P>
Here, he displayed a structural integrity one has sometimes missed in his 
playing; and, here, his penchant for overusing the pedal could be forgiven, 
because it worked toward the success of this particular piece. No one can 
pretend it is echt Bach; what Busoni created is a wondrous, Romantic canvas of 
Bachian inspiration. Feltsman made it shine.

'STRAPLESS': THE PLOT JUST DOESN'T HOLD UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Strapless," written and directed by David Hare, is supposed to be a romantic 
movie for literate grown-ups. In other words, there's not a whole lot of 
yelling and hair-pulling and laughter -- there's not a whole lot of life. 
</P>
<P>
All this dull anomic melancholy is nevertheless meant to signify the currents 
of cultured passion. Hare, best known as the playwright of "Plenty," is 
indulging in a subtle, snobby high-art game here. By stifling the messiness of 
romantic emotion, he's aiming for a "higher" truth cleansed of "common" 
feeling. The educated bourgeois sufferers in "Strapless" (at selected theaters) 
indulge their sorrows as if they were expensive pets. 
</P>
<P>
Blair Brown is Lillian, an American working for the past 12 years in London as 
a hospital physician. Vacationing abroad for a week, nursing the breakup of a 
long-term relationship with an actor, she finds herself being romanced by 
Raymond Forbes (Bruno Ganz), a mysterious, well-tailored gent who doesn't blink 
very much. Her retreat from his advances only sparks his ardor; he traces her 
back to London and proceeds to court her shamelessly, buying her everything 
from flowers to horses to BMWs. His hand-dog mooniness finally gets to her, 
even though she knows precious little about him except that he's some kind of 
bullion entrepreneur and that he speaks his heavily accented English 
exceedingly slowly, in complete sentences. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond's otherworldly passion is meant to contrast with Lillian's pinched 
reserve. Even though she's an able doctor, she doesn't draw much emotional 
sustenance from her work. Her career has closed off her life; she gives and 
gives and, in the film's narrow terms, gets nothing back. When Raymond cajoles 
her with a marriage offer, asking her if she's ever wanted to do something 
"that didn't entirely make sense," she's primed to respond. 
</P>
<P>
"Strapless" (rated R) has a super-sophisticated veneer but it's really just an 
artsy variant on the 
lonely-spinster-on-vacation-finds-love-with-a-mysterious-stranger scenario. 
It's "Summertime" with British damp. Hare wants us to recognize that, despite 
Lillian's professional role as healer, she's in need of emotional repair 
herself. It's too neat a formulation. Lillian's romantic renewal seems 
preordained; it's like the working out of a theorem. In any case, since she 
doesn't seem to be banking too many fires, her Raymond-inspired "release" has 
no heat. She's still the same vaguely happy, vaguely sad woman at the end as 
she was at the beginning. And Raymond is the same cipher. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt Hare intends all this to be a more modern and adult version of what 
love is really like. No fireworks, just a few spluttering sparklers. But the 
cultivated high tone of these quasi-lovers isn't necessarily so realistic; by 
dampening their passions, Hare is foisting his own version of "Invasion of the 
Body Snatchers" on us. Lillian and Raymond are such tony sufferers they're 
practically pod people. 
</P>
<P>
The only member of the cast who creates a stir is Bridget Fonda, playing 
Lillian's younger sister. Fonda's Amy, an aspiring clothes designer who camps 
out in Lillian's apartment with an assortment of mod friends, has the life 
force that Hare denies the rest of his characters. Fonda has a sequence in 
which she recoils before her sister's wrath, and another when she returns that 
wrath, that are so finely felt that it's as if we were watching the emergence 
of a major actress right before our eyes. Amy is in the movie to give the film 
a classic balance. She and Lillian, so different on the surface, share the same 
plight. They're "strapless," at large in a world where their faith is not soon 
repaid. 
</P>
<P>
Fonda's ferocity upsets this too-neat balance. If only the film belonged to 
her.

SMALL TOWN EXPLODES AS TWO FAMILIES 'FEUD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why do men war with and kill each other? Great ideals? Land, gold, beautiful 
women? In his 1983 comic novel, "The Feud," Thomas Berger suggests that we 
fight and die because of stupidity and stubbornness, geography and lies. 
</P>
<P>
Berger's story -- about a daffily escalating small-town vendetta, engendered by 
trifles and proceeding to catastrophes -- is great movie material. But the film 
that's been made from it, Bill D'Elia's "The Feud" (at the Fine Arts), shows 
little imagination, less intensity. It preserves much of Berger's dialogue and 
plot, but little of the Swiss-watch precision and comic ruthlessness that 
animates it. 
</P>
<P>
The basic story is a wry holocaust, set in the era of Bonnie and Clyde, in 
which two families, the Bullards of Millville and the Beelers of nearby 
Hornbeck, become embroiled in hostilities that claim two lives. The cause: an 
inane argument over paint remover and an unlit stogie in Bullard's hardware 
store. 
</P>
<P>
The novel is about small-town dopes with frontier dreams. The combatants are 
frustrated little men, nasty teen-age punks, hothead bullies leading dull 
lives: all of whom explode over nothing. D'Elia's film, fast-forwarded into the 
1950s -- for no perceivable reason except the lure of a rock 'n roll period 
score -- loses that desperate '30s edge, the sense of lawlessness and hard 
times that fuels the feud. It becomes an urbanized sitcom in which the dopes 
are stripped of their cosmic obsessions. 
</P>
<P>
Except one. As Cousin Reverton Bullard -- an alleged railroad detective who 
carries around a starter's pistol to terrify would-be assailants -- Rene 
Auberjonois has a great face that's a cross between a mad ferret, a shabby 
Puritan lay minister and one of cartoonist Charles Addams' evil bald little 
men. He's the ultimate outsider, a knee-jerk bigot with a hair-trigger temper 
and, within minutes of the credits, he's pulled his gun on the equally 
foul-tempered Dolf Beeler (Ron McLarty), uncorking a donnybrook that rolls 
along like a Laurel and Hardy destruction derby. But D'Elia never develops the 
visual grace to match Berger's dead-on dialogue. And, except for Auberjonois -- 
and Ron Vanderberry as the unspeakable teen-age snot, Junior Bullard -- he 
hasn't cast well, either. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Tucci, an expert comic actor, is too urban and snappy for the beefy, 
lecher-bully police chief, Harvey Yelton; Gale Mayron too Brooklynesque tarty 
for sister Bernice Beeler; Lynne Killmeyer too old for 13-year-old sexpot Eva 
Bullard; Scott Allegrucci too sharp for her football lineman beau, Tony Beeler. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps D'Elia can't keep a secret. He reveals, as they happen, the culprits 
behind the Bullard hardware store fire and Beeler car bombing -- destroying 
much of the story's suspense and irony. He's lost the dark passion and longing 
of Eva and Tony's Juliet and Romeo pursuit and encouraged Joe Grifasi, as Bud 
Bullard, to a ridiculous crazy-ape breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
The book is by someone who really understands small towns; the movie seems to 
have been directed by an urban kibitzer who finds them coy, silly and 
grotesque. But D'Elia deserves every credit for finding this book and bringing 
it to the screen -- even if we might wish that Arthur Penn or the Coen Brothers 
had found it first. 
</P>
<P>
"The Feud" (rated R for sex, language and violence) has something most movies 
don't: a good story, if not always a well told one. Stupidity, as we learn 
here, is eternal, passion only temporary.

TWO VIEWS OF AIDS: ONE A TRIUMPH, THE OTHER A FAILURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Art exhibitions that approach the subject of AIDS enter a mine field. This 
difficult territory is studded with medical, social, ethical and political 
issues that claim a prominent position among the most important of our time. 
The stakes are high, the ramifications far-reaching. It's no place for good 
intentions unredeemed by piercing insight. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Municipal Art Gallery opened two exhibitions whose 
contradictory approaches demonstrate the thorniness of the matter. "Raging at 
the Visible: AIDS in the City of Angels" overflows with the awful failure of 
good intentions. By sharp contrast, "The Indomitable Spirit: Photographers and 
Artists Respond to the Time of AIDS" is an achievement of unusual note. 
</P>
<P>
"The Indomitable Spirit" was organized by Photographers + Friends United 
Against AIDS, a Manhattan-based organization that raises substantial funds for 
AIDS research, education and care. The exhibition has generated a book and a 
limited edition portfolio featuring new work by 10 of the participating 
artists; both are for sale. (The portfolio may be seen at BlumHelman Gallery, 
Saturday through June 9.) The 94 works in the Municipal Art Gallery show, which 
had its debut last February at New York's International Center of Photography, 
will be auctioned at a Sotheby's benefit in October. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to fund-raising, the group also seeks to utilize the talents of 
artists to stimulate action and awareness of AIDS issues. Forsaking lip 
service, they have here produced an important model. 
</P>
<P>
The fight against AIDS has been cruelly hampered by those who, in the name of 
religion, politics or profits, cynically manipulate human lives for 
self-serving ends. "The Indomitable Spirit" manages a remarkable end-run, by 
offering nothing less than a convincing image of collective healing. 
</P>
<P>
What it heals is the horrific social divisiveness that so far characterizes 
general response to the disease. Curator Marvin Heiferman invited photographers 
of all kinds to participate in the show; commercial, art, sports, fashion, 
medical and journalistic photographers contributed. They were asked simply to 
submit an image that, from their own perspective, would serve as "a celebration 
of human strength, compassion, and courage in the face of challenge and 
adversity." 
</P>
<P>
The subject of the show is not the ravages of disease, but hope in the time of 
AIDS. If that sounds sentimental -- or difficult, liberating, mysterious, 
desperate, uplifting, contradictory or beautiful -- rest assured that it is. 
All these responses and more will be found in the show. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Davis's cool, silent, exquisitely elegant photograph of an iceberg is 
plainly metaphoric, matching the dazzling beauty of nature with its awesomely 
destructive power. In Bert Stern's 1962 photograph of Elizabeth Taylor as 
Cleopatra, that same beauty, culturally magnified, is paired with mortal 
fragility: A tiny tracheotomy scar stands as the only blemish on Taylor's 
otherwise flawless body. With a change in gender, the aim is the same in Herb 
Ritts's 1987 image of a muscle man hefting an evanescent soap bubble. 
</P>
<P>
Proscribed fantasies of modern heroism are explored in David Levinthal's 
picture of children's toys, in Burt Glinn's photograph of Christopher Reeve on 
the set of "Superman" and in Cindy Sherman's glamour-queen self-portrait. 
There's gentle communion in Sally Mann's tribute to her father's life and 
death, and in Alon Reininger's picture of the tenderness between men, one a 
person with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Daunting puzzles of discovery are offered by Peter Nagy's hieroglyphic map of 
an Egyptian pyramid and John Schlesinger's mysterious beaker illuminated by a 
movie projector. There is even a "pure" image of hope: a seemingly abstract 
photograph by scientist Michael Davidson, which in fact shows the crystalline 
structure of the medication AZT. 
</P>
<P>
More than any of the several score of accomplished works, however, it is the 
magnificent panoply of responses that is truly moving. The focus is quietly but 
firmly shifted away from divisive stalemate among competing doctrines, and 
toward an encounter with diversity, openness and the dignity of individual 
humanity. 
</P>
<P>
"The Indomitable Spirit" opens up the experience to include virtually everyone, 
which is precisely the most frequently obstructed and denied reality of this 
disease. The populations who have taken the initial brunt of the epidemic -- 
gay men, blacks, Latinos -- were already shunted to the margins by our culture. 
AIDS has been used to add barbed wire to the fence. The exhibition artfully 
takes the fence down. It knows, and shows, that we are all living with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Would that the same could be said for the companion show, which has been 
assembled by Gallery curator Susan Foley Johannsen. A brochure tells us that 
"Raging at the Visible: AIDS in the City of Angels" is limited to work by 
artists who have been "diagnosed with AIDS related symptoms or know a friend or 
loved one who has." To be sure, the AIDS community has special reason to insist 
upon being heard; but this ill-considered venue muffles voices instead. 
</P>
<P>
First, it divides people into Us and Them. In the context of a discriminatory 
society that has stalled research and care from the very beginning, a show like 
this cannot avoid an exploitative aura of voyeurism. The effect inadvertently 
parallels the noxious claim that the disease is a factor of special "risk 
groups," who can be contained, when in truth it is spread by risk behaviors, 
which are responsibilities shared by everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Second, it inappropriately implies that the disease is another new impulse for 
the creation of heartfelt works of art expressing human mortality. (The show's 
title comes from Theodore Roethke's poem, "The Dying Man.") When you come upon 
the late Nicholas Wilder's non-figurative painting, "Echo II-For G.C.," you 
have been primed to scan its nested, horizontal rectangles -- black inside navy 
blue inside white -- as a metaphor for the human condition in the time of AIDS. 
This is both a gross distortion of Wilder's art and a dodging of the specific 
ideological conditions actually responsible for the spread of suffering and 
death. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS is a disease, not a metaphor. A few works attempt to address it as such. 
But the clear aim of the presentation, which frames them all, is to uncover an 
indivisible essence at the core of experience of the disease. At best naive, 
this romantic effort speaks of a serious curatorial misapprehension. 
</P>
<P>
The error is that the mysterious core of the experience is not hidden, nor is 
there any supposed secret waiting to be uncovered. The unique essence residing 
deep inside this ravaged moment is a complex virus called HIV, a virus that 
must be avoided, subverted, stopped. Many things could have been done in the 
show to contribute to these necessary actions. That it only contributes to 
their continued obfuscation is to be earnestly regretted. 
</P>
<P>
"The Indomitable Spirit" and "Raging at the Visible" remain through June 24 at 
the Municipal Art Gallery, 4800 Hollywood Blvd., (213) 485-4581.

GREAT PANCAKES? A HOT CAKE LOVER WILL FLIP OVER THESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ANAHEIM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One friend of mine has been talking about the German pancake at Walker Brothers 
in Chicago for as long as I've known him. Another been bragging about Polly's 
Pancake Parlor in Sugar Hill, N.H., for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
It is with some satisfaction that I can tell you I've finally found a place 
that shut these guys up for a whole morning. 
</P>
<P>
A pancake lover will be sorely tempted to call the Original Pancake House in 
Anaheim the best restaurant in Orange County. Yes, it's a chain restaurant, but 
yes, it's that good. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Original Pancake House is not to be confused with the much 
larger International House of Pancakes chain. But maybe the Anaheim OPH has an 
additional secret of success: It's totally a family operation. Owned and 
managed by its former chef, Ron Voll, along with his wife, Nancy, its current 
chefs are their sons Adam and Gary, and you won't find more experienced pancake 
chefs between here and Portland, where the Original Pancake House chain 
started. Or between here and Tierra del Fuego, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant itself is modest, just a woodsy-looking coffee shop with 
cherrywood paneling and coffee-colored vinyl booths. It's set back slightly 
from the street, so look for a rather dilapidated sign depicting a smiling chef 
in a baker's hat, partially hidden behind a tall tree. If this doesn't work, 
keep your eye out for an auto parts store; it's right next door. 
</P>
<P>
During the week you'll see the regulars, a colorful crowd of truckers, seniors 
and secretaries. Weekends, it's a big favorite with families. There's standing 
room only in the lobby as people wait for tables. 
</P>
<P>
Why do they wait? The pancakes served here are anything but modest, every one 
made from special batters infused with sourdough yeast. These are the pancakes 
great-grandma used to make: light, finely textured, complex. There are about 30 
varieties to choose from. 
</P>
<P>
Tops on my list would definitely be the apple pancake, simply the best pancake 
dish I have ever eaten. It's a giant, golden puff the size of a small pie, with 
a crunchy cinnamon glaze topping half an inch thick and a pile of freshly cut 
apples glistening in the center. It positively drools butter. This is the one 
that silenced my friend with the Chicago fixation. 
</P>
<P>
Second place would be the Belgian waffle, available plain or with various berry 
toppings. Eggy, crisp and golden brown, this is one of the most perfect waffles 
I have ever tasted. The batter is whipped until thoroughly aerated, giving a 
sensuous crunch to every bite. Try it plain. Putting fruit on it is like 
putting ice in champagne. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, most of the customers seemed to be eating either the German pancake 
and its smaller cousin, the Dutch baby, probably because they are lighter and 
more digestible than most of the other dishes. They look like golden sombreros, 
edges burnt from baking in an extra-hot oven. The tops are dusted with powdered 
sugar and doused with fresh lemon juice and butter. Don't let them cool down, 
because they deflate like an overcooked souffle. 
</P>
<P>
For purists there are classic buttermilk pancakes, puffy and springy with a 
pleasant sour aftertaste. You can get three of them with any of the menu's 
first-rate egg dishes. I recommend the buttery, golden brown ham-and-cheese 
omelet (served pancake style, natch). 
</P>
<P>
But why limit yourself to the familiar? A host of eccentric offerings are 
available. "Palestine pancakes" are rolled crepes laced with a runny sour cream 
sauce faintly tinged with Cointreau. Or how about cherry Kijafa crepes, a still 
lighter crepe which the menu describes as stuffed with "luscious, blushing 
cherries simmered in liqueur"? 
</P>
<P>
The list goes on and on. Swedish pancakes, so thin you can see right through 
them, served with a heaping bowl of lingonberry preserves. Hawaiian pancakes 
with pineapple-based "tropical syrup." 
</P>
<P>
Is the Original Pancake House perfect? Well, no. The buckwheats I got were on 
the doughy side, and all the pancakes come with a big gob of whipped butter 
that tends to melt into a big puddle. And the ham and bacon is forgettable, 
even if they do prepare a pretty mean sausage patty. (Some cob-smoked Vermont 
bacons and hams would make a wonderful addition to this menu.) Pure maple 
syrup? At these prices, forget it. 
</P>
<P>
But who cares? The syrup they do serve is awfully good for a commercial brand. 
Their fresh-squeezed juices are sweet and pulpy and their coffee is always hot. 
From start to finish, this place is definitely a class act. 
</P>
<P>
The Volls have recently opened another Original Pancake House, this one in 
nearby Yorba Linda. The new restaurant has most of the same good old recipes, 
plus a few new ones such as apple waffle, vegetarian omelet, and even a pancake 
made from cottage cheese. I hope people start going there. It might help 
shorten the lines at the original Original Pancake House in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Prices are low. Fruits, juices, and preserves are $0.75 to $1.35, waffles $2.50 
to $4.95, pancakes $2.65 to $6.05. Side orders run a big $0.95 to $2.85.

USTINOV TRIES TO EXPLAIN 'THE MOZART MYSTIQUE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like Peter Ustinov? Then you'll probably like "The Mozart Mystique," airing 
tonight (9:30 p.m. on Channel 28, 9 p.m. on Channels 15 and 24). 
</P>
<P>
Ustinov carries the two-hour program with characteristic zest, acting out both 
sides in Mozart's correspondence with his father, lecturing sternly or 
marveling over the mystery of genius. 
</P>
<P>
He says, "Mozart was a genius both ingenuous and sophisticated, both trivial 
and profound, not by turns but at one and the same time." Something much the 
same could be said of this show, written by Israela Margalit and directed by 
Jochen Richter. 
</P>
<P>
There are attempts to summarize and elucidate the titular mystique at the 
beginning and end of the program, but generally Margalit and Ustinov settle for 
a straightforward biography, recounted chronologically. 
</P>
<P>
Performance clips are frequent, and run a wide stylistic gamut. A two-hour show 
probably ought to have whole movements or arias, but the music is all 
excerpted, and identified only by the complete work. The stellar crop of 
conductors -- Georg Solti, Helmuth Rilling, Colin Davis, Jeffrey Tate -- and 
the lesser-known but talented soloists are named only in the rush of credits at 
the end. 
</P>
<P>
Ustinov tells us little about the actual music, and what he does say is often 
vague, tautological or misleading. The program does not illuminate Mozart's 
music; rather, the music -- which follows the biographical chronology -- seems 
chosen to illustrate Mozart's life. Along the way Ustinov does some useful 
debunking. He rescues Salieri from the "Amadeus" mire of mediocrity and murder, 
and reminds us that Mozart was not quite so poor in his last days as legend 
would have it. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mozart Mystique" may not go far toward explaining the phenomenon of 
Mozart's genius, but Ustinov communicates the wonder of it admirably. JOHN 
HENKEN

A GUIDE TO BERKOFF AND KAFKA ON BRAVO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone who has been stumped by the work of Steven Berkoff -- its bombast, its 
outrageousness, its virulence, its scatology -- might find the Sunday 3 p.m. 
edition of "The South Bank Show" on Bravo cable (repeated May 29 at 7 p.m. and 
12:30 a.m.) a guide to understanding this extreme iconoclast. 
</P>
<P>
"His philosophy, his way of life and his art are exactly the same," says Joseph 
Papp, artistic director of the New York Shakespeare Festival, who employed 
Berkoff to stage "Coriolanus," finding him something of an enigmatic handful. 
</P>
<P>
"He is what he does." 
</P>
<P>
That is perhaps the key to this rebellious child of Russian Jews (his father 
was a tailor), who grew up in the rough and tumble area of East London and 
proceeded to conduct his life with a logic at once enviable in its directness 
and trouncing in its bluntness. 
</P>
<P>
The show intercuts among Berkoff acting, Berkoff talking about himself and 
others talking about Berkoff -- such as Papp, Roman Polanski (who played Gregor 
Samsa in Berkoff's stage adaptation of Kafka's "Metamorphosis" in Paris in 
1988), Mikhail Baryshnikov (who took on the same role on Broadway) and actress 
Linda Marlowe, his partner in "Decadence" and "Greek." The variety of 
commentary deepens the portrait. 
</P>
<P>
Since the show is followed (at 7 p.m. and 1:30 a.m., and again May 29 at 8 p.m. 
and 1:30 a.m.) by Berkoff's own impressive, highly stylized television version 
of "Metamorphosis" (starring Tim Roth as an electrifying "bug" and Berkoff as 
the father), these segments take on special significance. 
</P>
<P>
"It was through my loneliness that I identified with Gregor Samsa," says 
Berkoff, explaining the physical attempt to create movement on "six legs" by 
crossing the arms, raising the wrists, bending the elbows, spreading the knees, 
dragging the legs. 
</P>
<P>
"His ideas are very, very strong and he gets what he wants," comments Polanski. 
"It's difficult on the actors, but so what?" Adds Baryshnikov: "He never allows 
you to think during rehearsal." 
</P>
<P>
"I started writing because I wasn't employed," Berkoff says about his 
beginnings. "They didn't recognize this gigantic neo-Olivier," which in part 
explains why he wrote such plays as "East" and "Greek" in a unique, 
neo-Shakespearean slang -- and why critics have accused him of "intellectual 
incontinence" and writing like a 15-year-old who looks 50. 
</P>
<P>
Berkoff's lifelong "anti-authority stance" also explains why the explosive 
quotient of "adolescent rage" in his plays makes them such good therapy for 
prison inmates. Berkoff mimes everything, from props to violence. "Language," 
he says, "should represent the violence . . .," and despite the misogyny that 
pervades many of his 10 or so plays, he is the author of some of the most 
explicitly ardent writing for and about women. 
</P>
<P>
As an adjunct to "The South Bank Show" and "Metamorphosis," a segment of "The 
Modern World: Ten Great Writers" focusing on Kafka (and featuring a 
presentation of "The Trial") airs Sunday at 4 p.m. (and May 29 at 9:30 p.m.). 
Each can be seen independently, of course, but the three together constitute a 
mini-education in modern theater. SYLVIE DRAKE

PLANS ADVANCE FOR DISPUTED LUXURY HOUSES IN MOORPARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PSYCHE PASCUAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Moorpark City Council has decided to allow a Westlake developer to move 
ahead with a proposal to build a luxury housing tract despite criticism that it 
would destroy the rural character of the city's northern slopes. 
</P>
<P>
The 4-1 decision Wednesday night allows developer Paul Bollinger to submit 
plans to build 101 estates on half of 518 acres of rugged hillsides off Grimes 
Canyon Road. In return, Bollinger has promised to build a championship golf 
course, an equestrian center and tennis clubs on the rest of the acreage. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a quality project, and they realize it's a quality project," Bollinger 
said Thursday. "It's what the city needs. It gives them upscale houses." Each 
house would cost between $800,000 and $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Bollinger said he will submit plans to Moorpark officials within a month. The 
project is being called Devonshire Farms, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Council members who voted to allow Bollinger to move forward said they reacted 
favorably to the proposal because they believe that it will preserve a large 
chunk of open space in the city's vast northern corridor. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Scott Montgomery strongly opposed the project, saying he has 
"severe concerns" over the impact that the residential development would have 
on the environment and surrounding farms and horse ranches. 
</P>
<P>
The zoning allows landowners to build only one house on five acres, but 
Bollinger plans to build houses on two-acre parcels. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery accused Bollinger of offering to build recreational facilities that 
actually will be closed to the public. He said that while the public may be 
allowed to use the golf course, the tennis courts and riding center will be 
limited to those who live in the estates. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to destroy .. . the northern part of this city to line the pockets 
of a developer," Montgomery said. "I think the developer may have snowed the 
council rather well." 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery said he would continue his opposition to the development when the 
council reviews the project again for final approval. The project still faces 
tough environmental and legal hurdles as it passes through the planning 
process. 
</P>
<P>
It is likely that an environmental impact report will be required, city 
officials said. Also, the property Bollinger hopes to buy to develop the 
housing is entangled in a court battle involving its two general partners. 
</P>
<P>
Federal investigators are looking into an alleged bank fraud scheme involving 
questionable real estate loans at the defunct Westlake Thrift &amp; Loan. In 
connection with the investigation, the assets of Thousand Oaks financier Olen 
B. Phillips, including the land involved in the proposed real estate venture, 
were seized. Phillips was a board member at Westlake Thrift. 
</P>
<P>
A court-appointed attorney last week signed papers allowing Bollinger's 
application to be processed by Moorpark city officials pending the outcome of 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
Landowners surrounding the proposed development have threatened to file a 
lawsuit if city officials allow Bollinger to increase the density of the 
property.

OXNARD OFFICER HAS EMPATHIC EAR FOR CRIME VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oxnard Police Officer Glenn McIntyre was off duty five years ago when his 
motorcycle slid into a drunk driver who tried to make a U-turn in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of the collision broke McIntyre's back in 17 places and left him 
paralyzed from the ribs down. 
</P>
<P>
McIntyre was a 23-year-old patrol officer and had been out of the police 
academy for only 18 months when the accident left him in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
But McIntyre and the Oxnard Police Department have both made the best of the 
tragic accident. Although the department lost a good beat cop, it gained a desk 
officer with a particular sensitivity to victims of crimes and accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Before McIntyre was injured, the department was considering creating a desk job 
for injured officers who could soothe crime victims, fill out reports and 
answer questions about the law. The position was a perfect fit. 
</P>
<P>
"It was advantageous for him and the department," said Lt. Stan Myers, 
McIntyre's supervising officer. "It provided us with somebody with experience 
and knowledge. And, boy, he's contributed a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Myers said that many times police officers on the street don't have enough time 
to listen to victims or residents with a concern. But McIntyre "has the time to 
listen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McIntyre agrees. He said that because he was a victim of an accident and a 
crime, he can now better sympathize with the victims he comforts at the police 
station. 
</P>
<P>
"I can relate to them being disabled or I can relate to them as victims," he 
said. "I tell them if you didn't end up with a permanent injury or you didn't 
lose something that you can't replace, that money can't buy, then you're doing 
all right." 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Robert Owens said he offered McIntyre the position of answering 
phone calls from victims because "we knew he was a good man, a good officer." 
</P>
<P>
Because McIntyre's accident occurred while off duty, he was not eligible for 
many of the Police Department's insurance benefits, Owens said. To aid their 
disabled colleague, several police officers donated their sick leave so that 
McIntyre wouldn't lose his regular paycheck, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are like a family," he said. "We try to support each other." 
</P>
<P>
Although he said he tries to be encouraging to victims, McIntyre has had to 
struggle in his own life. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of people that have bounced back better than I, and there are 
some who haven't bounced back as well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McIntyre said it took him five months to learn how to dress himself and 10 
months to learn how to use the bathroom without any help. And then there is the 
constant pain, which he said is "like someone digging their knuckles into your 
back." 
</P>
<P>
Although the struggle to fight off depression and frustration continues every 
day, McIntyre said, things are looking up. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, he bought a two-bedroom house in Oxnard, which he has renovated for 
wheelchair access. He installed a Jacuzzi specially designed so he can get in 
and out without help. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he married Hellmi Chavez, a young records clerk he met at work. 
Merlin, a black Labrador service dog who spends almost 24 hours a day at his 
master's side, carried the rings in a basket during the wedding ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
McIntyre, a blond, blue-eyed native of Laguna Beach, competes in tennis 
tournaments for the handicapped and lectures schoolchildren about the 
capabilities of the disabled. St. John's Regional Medical Center has sponsored 
McIntyre in the tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like being in a chair," he said. "I hate being in a chair. I want to 
change my own light bulbs and I want to paint my own house and do my own 
gardening. But I wouldn't change what I have with my wife and my dog and the 
Police Department and the community of Oxnard." 
</P>
<P>
When asked, he does not hesitate to recount the events involving the motorcycle 
accident that so drastically altered his life. 
</P>
<P>
On the night of April 5, 1985, McIntyre was headed north on Pacific Coast 
Highway in Laguna Beach, returning from Palm Springs with a woman friend on the 
back of his bike, when a Ford Mustang suddenly cut in front of him, beginning a 
U-turn. 
</P>
<P>
McIntyre, who was riding at about 45 miles per hour, had just enough time to 
apply the brakes and slide the motorcycle onto its side. 
</P>
<P>
Although the impact of the crash broke his back and shattered his hip and five 
ribs, McIntyre never lost consciousness. His friend suffered several broken 
bones but recovered with no permanent injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the car was not injured. However, police tests later showed that 
the driver had a 0.18% blood-alcohol level and had used cocaine that day. 
Several witnesses said they saw the man stagger into the Mustang just before 
the accident but no one tried to stop him. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't angry at the guy," McIntyre said. "I met him several months later in 
court. He just cried and said he was sorry." 
</P>
<P>
The driver was sentenced to one year in jail and ordered to pay $65,000 in 
restitution to McIntyre. The drunk driver spent eight months in jail and has 
yet to pay the restitution, McIntyre said. 
</P>
<P>
McIntyre admits that the episode made him "a little frustrated with the whole 
justice system," but he said he tries not to let it discourage him or affect 
his work. 
</P>
<P>
McIntyre underwent 14 hours of surgery before he was strapped face down onto a 
special hospital bed that nurses rotated every two hours to keep him from 
developing bedsores. He remained strapped to that bed for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, McIntyre said, he considered suicide to end the agonizing pain in 
his back. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a 24-hour watch on me for several weeks because it was so 
depressing," he said. "The pain was unbearable. Sometimes you just lay there 
and scream and cry for hours." 
</P>
<P>
But he survived the eight months in the hospital with the support of his 
parents and many friends. 
</P>
<P>
Things were different when McIntyre returned to the police station. It bothered 
him that his colleagues had to look down to meet his eyes. And although he 
continues to be physically active, he said some officers began to greet him 
with a feeble handshake. 
</P>
<P>
"People should know that being in a chair you still have the same wants," he 
said. "You want to do everything just like before and you really hate it when 
someone looks at you differently." 
</P>
<P>
Hellmi, his wife, said that even after McIntyre got out of the hospital and 
returned to work, he was often depressed and frustrated. She said much of her 
time with him has been spent motivating him to do such basic things as getting 
dressed. 
</P>
<P>
"To be married to someone who is in a chair can be a lot of work," she said. 
"But when you are in love with someone it really doesn't matter."

APHIDS INFLICTING HUGE LOSSES ON ORGANIC FARMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PSYCHE PASCUAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Organic farmers in Ventura County stand to lose millions of dollars in crops 
this year because of the worst outbreak of aphids in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Growers, who blame the outbreak on drought conditions, say that crops most 
endangered by the insect are organically grown lettuce, broccoli, cabbage and 
celery. 
</P>
<P>
"In the mountains, all the vegetation is dry up there, so they come after our 
crop in stronger numbers," said organic farmer Dean Walsh. "This is the worst 
year we've had in 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Up and down the central coast, organic farmers are trying to exterminate armies 
of the tiny, winged insects. They say they are severely hampered, however, 
because -- unlike other farmers -- they do not use pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had an aphid problem like we've never seen in our lives," said Mary Ann 
Sprinkle, a spokeswoman for the Carpinteria chapter of California Certified 
Organic Farmers. "Aphids are on things I've never seen them on before." 
</P>
<P>
There is only a small contingent of organic farmers in Ventura County. Fourteen 
farmers till 1,200 acres, producing between $10 million and $15 million of 
vegetables and fruit, growers estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Without organic solutions to the aphid outbreak, "you're looking at a 
multimillion-dollar loss for the county," said Bob Scowcroft, executive 
director of the California Certified Organic Farmers, which represents 630 
growers. 
</P>
<P>
While other farmers can spray chemicals to rid their produce of the pest, 
organic farmers say they are almost powerless to prevent the damage aphids can 
wreak. They are turning to nontoxic methods to kill the irksome insects: soapy 
water, and other bugs. 
</P>
<P>
Organic farmers have been spraying their fields with soapy water by hand to 
wash aphids off their crops. They also have introduced ladybugs and lacewings, 
which feed on aphids, into their fields to reduce the aphid population. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh runs the largest organic farm in Ventura County, a 540-acre ranch in 
Camarillo, and a 280-acre farm near Lompoc in Santa Barbara County. His farm 
ships about 1 million cartons of organic vegetables to domestic markets each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The green bugs suck vegetables dry, ruining produce that is ready for market. 
Even vegetables believed to be clean of bugs have made their way to supermarket 
stands, only to be found sprinkled with aphids. 
</P>
<P>
About 10% to 15% of Walsh's green vegetables were lost to hungry aphids last 
month when 15 acres were infested, he said. Harvested crops had to be dumped 
after supermarkets discovered the insect and rejected the produce. 
</P>
<P>
While organic farmers blame lack of rain for the aphid outbreak, county 
agriculture officials refrain from attributing the outbreak only to the 
drought. They say the bugs are returning as part of a seasonal reproductive 
cycle, but admit the population is unusually large this year. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Phillips, a pest management specialist with the University of California 
farm adviser's office in Ventura, said lack of rain has broken down the 
resistance of crops to predatory insects such as aphids. Moreover, plant 
physiology changes during periods of drought and actually makes them more tasty 
to their enemies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The plant, when it's under stress, produces more proteins in the plant sap. In 
doing that, it produces a more nutritious meal," Phillips said. Hungry aphids 
see it as "akin to eating filet mignon as opposed to hamburger." 
</P>
<P>
Aphids leave tell-tale signs of their feasting, Phillips said. After the bug 
has sucked a plant dry, its leaves curl under or wrinkle. 
</P>
<P>
The only spray organic farmers can use is a soapy insecticide that dries out 
aphids, but it has only a "mediocre" deterrent effect, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, organic farmers have begun planting other crops to divert aphids away 
from commercially grown vegetables. They are planting alfalfa, mint and 
marigold flowers, Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Walsh farm is bracing itself for another attack on the cucumber 
and tomato harvest next month, Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
"Before there were farmers, there were aphids," he said. "We're always 
preparing for them." 
</P>
<P>
CONSUMER TIPS 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture officials say the most common signs of aphid infestation are: 
</P>
<P>
* Aphids that are visible on the skin or outer leaves of vegetables or fruits. 
</P>
<P>
* Wrinkled, curling or deformed leaves that indicate aphids have been sucking 
the juices out of the plant. 
</P>
<P>
* Discoloration, such as small yellow specks, particularly on the outer leaves 
of cabbage. 
</P>
<P>
* A sticky, filmy residue on the outer leaves and skin. 
</P>
<P>
Produce that does have aphids can still be eaten, growers said. They add that a 
thorough rinse of the vegetable usually gets rid of the bugs.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRADLEY APPOINTS DIRECTOR OF HUMAN 
RELATIONS PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a bid to improve relations among the city's diverse racial and ethnic 
groups, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley Thursday announced the appointment of an 
executive director for the Human Relations Commission -- the first in 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Wakabayashi, 46, a United Way vice president who will assume the post May 
29, has been asked to establish programs to deal with racism, sexism, 
homophobia, xenophobia and religious intolerance, Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
The nine-member commission was established in February, 1966, in response to 
the Watts riots. In 1988 Bradley asked the panel to reevaluate its mission, and 
one of its recommendations was to appoint an executive director. 
</P>
<P>
The council approved funds of up to $50,000 to fill the post in the 1989-90 
budget.

PROBE OF NAVAL ACADEMY INCIDENT URGED

<TEXT>
<P>
An Alabama senator called Thursday for a Pentagon investigation into the 
resignation of a woman U.S. Naval Academy midshipman who was handcuffed to a 
men's room urinal and taunted by male classmates. 
</P>
<P>
Gwen Marie Dreyer of Encinitas resigned from the Naval Academy last month after 
she became dissatisfied with the investigation of the Dec. 8 incident at the 
once all-male academy in Annapolis, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Richard Shelby, D-Ala., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, 
wrote Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Navy Secretary Lawrence Garrett III, 
asking them to personally investigate the circumstances surrounding Dreyer's 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
"Those responsible for the sexual harassment were only given demerits and a 
loss of leave time, while the victim has felt it necessary to resign from the 
Navy," Shelby wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"I have also been led to believe that the victim was intimidated by classmates 
who warned her not to testify at a disciplinary hearing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shelby said he found the incident "reprehensible," and he urged the Pentagon 
officials to "make all efforts to determine whether there is an institutional 
bias against women in our military academies." 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that this is just an isolated incident, that it is not reflective of a 
deep-seated bias against women in our military," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Midshipmen 2nd Class John Hindinger and Tom Rosson were punished with demerits 
and loss of leave time as a result of the incident. Six other midshipmen 
received written warnings for lesser roles in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
The academy ruled that the incident wasn't premeditated and therefore could not 
be considered hazing, which can lead to dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
Virgil L. Hill Jr., the academy superintendent, described the incident as "a 
good-natured exchange" that "got out of hand." He said it escalated from a 
snowball fight that had taken place minutes before. 
</P>
<P>
Dreyer was pulled from her dormitory room and dragged to the bathroom by male 
midshipmen. She was eventually freed from the urinal after her roommates shoved 
their way into the crowd and pleaded for the keys to the handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
About 10% of the 3,000 midshipmen at the academy are women.

POLICE UNION RIPS D.A. FOR TRYING 2 OFFICERS; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: PROSECUTORS ACCUSED OF HOLDING POLICE TO UNREASONABLE STANDARD IN WAKE 
OF PAIR'S ACQUITTAL. 
</P>

<P>
The San Diego police union sharply criticized the district attorney's office 
Thursday for bringing kidnaping and robbery charges against two downtown 
patrolmen and accused the prosecutor's office of abandoning "logic, reason and 
fairness" in evaluating allegations of officer misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
In a strongly worded statement, the board of directors of the Police Officers 
Assn., which represents 1,800 officers on the San Diego Police Department, 
contended that the recent trial of officers Lloyd J. Hoff Jr. and Richard P. 
Schaaf shows that the district attorney is holding police officers to an 
unreasonable standard. 
</P>
<P>
Hoff and Schaaf, with a combined 13 years of police service, were acquitted 
Wednesday on felony charges of kidnaping and robbing illegal aliens in the 
downtown district. 
</P>
<P>
"Those close to the investigation concerning Officers Schaaf and Hoff believe 
the not-guilty verdict was the just one," the POA said. "It is another in a 
long line of cases where the jury system has exonerated police officers who 
were prosecuted on flimsy or non-existent evidence by our San Diego district 
attorney." 
</P>
<P>
The police union also noted that the district attorney declines to prosecute 
about 1,000 cases against accused felons each year. At the same time, the POA 
said, the district attorney imposes a higher standard when deciding whether to 
prosecute police officers. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the prevailing belief of the police officers of the city of San Diego 
that our district attorney has abandoned logic, reason and fairness in 
evaluating allegations against police officers," the POA said. 
</P>
<P>
Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller called the POA's allegations "irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
"They know very well that that case was investigated by the Internal Affairs 
unit of the San Diego Police Department and then submitted to us with a 
recommendation for prosecution," he said of the Hoff and Schaaf matter. 
</P>
<P>
"We realized it was a tough case. But we had sufficient evidence, and that's 
demonstrated by the fact the jury was out for two days. 
</P>
<P>
"And I just want the public to know that our policies haven't changed. When we 
are convinced police officers have committed a crime, when we have sufficient 
evidence, we're going to prosecute them." 
</P>
<P>
Added Michael R. Pent, who heads up the district attorney's special operations 
unit that prosecutes police misconduct: "The allegations are utter absurdity 
and nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
Steve McMillan, POA vice president and chairman of its legal defense fund, said 
in an interview that the union is not asserting that all officers are honest 
and above the law. "We don't want dirty cops around here," he said. "If that's 
happening, let's get rid of them." 
</P>
<P>
But he said the district attorney seems to be bending to political and media 
pressures in aggressively pursuing criminal charges against police officers, 
more so than in cases against others. 
</P>
<P>
"Our contention is that they should look at these cases the way they do all of 
them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the POA will closely monitor how the Police Department completes 
its administrative review of Hoff and Schaaf. Even though the officers were 
found not guilty in Superior Court, the Police Department is still initiating 
its own investigation to determine whether Hoff and Schaaf should be 
disciplined or fired. The officers are now on voluntary, unpaid leave. 
</P>
<P>
Hoff, a four-year police veteran, hopes to return to duty, and, if he is 
blocked, McMillan said, the POA will defend him in an effort to be reinstated. 
"We'll attempt to get his job back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Schaaf, meanwhile, has said he is so disappointed in the way the Police 
Department treated him and Hoff that he has no plans to continue his career in 
law enforcement after nine years as a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
But McMillan said the POA is still interested in helping Schaaf restore his 
reputation. "He may not now want to be a police officer, but he still wants to 
clear his good name," McMillan said. "And I think, once he does that, he'll go 
on to something else. And then this city will be losing one good cop."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SPEAKERS AT HEARING URGE NAVY TO KEEP 
SHIPYARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Community leaders in Long Beach say thousands of high-tech jobs would be lost, 
hundreds of workers and their families dislocated, and the local economy 
severely hurt if the Navy shuts down its shipyard here. 
</P>
<P>
"We shouldn't make our shipyard workers an endangered species," said City 
Councilman Evan Braude at a Navy hearing Wednesday on the fate of the Terminal 
Island yard in Long Beach Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
During the hearing on the economic, social and environmental impact of the 
yard's closure, three dozen speakers backed by 100 spectators presented their 
case for keeping the yard open. 
</P>
<P>
A report will be submitted to Congress in January to help determine which 
military facilities might be closed. 
</P>
<P>
The yard is the city's fifth-largest employer, with 4,100 workers. It is one of 
many military facilities that could be closed to trim defense spending.

CITY COUNCIL IN DEADLOCK; VOTERS WILL FILL VACANCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM KOWSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lawndale City Council will let the voters decide in November who will fill 
a vacant seat after the four council members deadlocked on who to appoint to 
the position left open last month. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's stalemate foreshadowed how the politically divided council is 
likely to deal with several important development issues facing the city in the 
next few months, many residents said. 
</P>
<P>
Hanging in the balance is how the tiny city will respond to a surge of new 
development that some say has strained its already fragile infrastructure, 
exacerbated traffic and parking problems and created intense conflict among its 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4 to 0 to set the election on Nov. 6, the same day as the 
general election, after attempts failed to appoint community activist Gary 
McDonald, the closest runner-up in April's race. The seat was left vacant when 
Councilman Harold Hofmann ran successfully in April for mayor and subsequently 
resigned from his council seat. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal to appoint McDonald was made by Councilman Larry Rudolph, who 
predicted that, unless the council could appoint a fifth member, it would find 
itself intractably deadlocked on important city business. 
</P>
<P>
"From now to November we're going to be 2-to-2 without a majority," Rudolph 
argued to his council colleagues. "Even if we have an election in November, 
it's still only going to be a 17-month term. I still think it's feasible we 
vote for the next highest vote getter." 
</P>
<P>
But Councilwoman Carol Norman, an outspoken foe of McDonald, and newly elected 
Councilman William Johnson, who beat McDonald by seven votes, refused to agree 
to the proposal, which failed on a 2-to-2 vote. They also refused to support 
Hofmann's suggestion that recently retired councilman Dan McKenzie be appointed 
to the post. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel confident that, excluding this issue, the four of us can take care of 
city business until November," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The council made its decision after hearing the comments of a dozen citizens 
who, like the council, were equally divided about McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
Several people claimed the financially strapped city could save up to $40,000 
by not holding an election and instead appointing McDonald to the seat. Their 
position was backed by a petition signed by more than 200 people. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in support of McDonald, developer Jonathan Stein directed his remarks 
to Johnson, asking how he "would have felt if he had lost by seven votes (but) 
. . . after a long election, after an expensive election, after a very 
well-attended election, the people's mandate was not followed? I think there's 
every reason to appoint now." 
</P>
<P>
But others strongly disagreed, saying the number of candidates from which 
voters had to choose was a key factor in McDonald doing so well in the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
"I urge you to not diminish the power and authority of that seat by making it 
an appointed seat," said community activist Nancy Marthens, who was among 10 
council candidates who ran in the April election. "It is by law an elected 
seat, and I urge you not to put a price on our right to vote on an individual 
in an election." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Maxwell, a former parks and recreation commissioner who also ran in April, 
provoked loud objections from the mayor and members of the audience when he 
questioned whether McDonald was responsible enough to hold a seat on the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
"This man is like a stick of dynamite. . . . He goes off on tangents and 
crusades for personal vendettas," Maxwell said. "Is this in the best interest 
and safety of this community and its citizens?" 
</P>
<P>
McDonald was not present but he said Thursday that Maxwell's remarks would not 
deter him from waging a bid for the seat this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I make human mistakes, I'm not perfect, and I don't think people expect 
someone to be perfect in everything," McDonald said. "What no one has ever 
denied, though, is my interest in this city." 
</P>
<P>
Norman Lagerquist ran on a slate with Johnson in April and plans to enter the 
race to fill the vacancy. Lagerquist predicted he would have a better chance of 
beating McDonald in November because the votes will be split among fewer 
candidates.

GOLFER SINGLE-HANDEDLY BEATS THE ODDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Saldana was on the seventh tee at the Catalina Island Golf Club, ready 
to try for another hole in one; he had shot his eighth a few weeks ago. They 
marvel at that in the barbershop down the hill. And they say a steel helmet 
saved Saldana's life when his right hand was blown off in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Saldana stood in a right-hander's position and held a 3-iron with his left 
hand. He used the stump at the end of his right arm to steady the club. As he 
swung, he pulled the stump away just before hitting the ball, and followed 
through with his left arm. 
</P>
<P>
The ball soared toward the flag 203 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
"Not another one," said Gil Voci, who was in the foursome. 
</P>
<P>
But this time, the ball stopped 12 feet short of the hole. 
</P>
<P>
"You realize," playing partner Buddy O'Jibway said, "how amazing this guy is?" 
</P>
<P>
A short man with a stomach he admits beer has greatly expanded, Saldana wore a 
baseball cap, shorts and a T-shirt with the crossed-swords insignia of his old 
Army unit, the 11th Armored Cavalry. 
</P>
<P>
"A little more and that thing goes in," he said in a matter-of-fact tone as he 
got back in his cart. Sipping from a can of beer, he drove down a fairway 
bordered by fat palms and overlooked by mountain ridges that touched clouds. 
</P>
<P>
This is the easygoing Saldana's island, where, like the 10 brothers and sisters 
before him, he was born and reared. This is the course where he caddied as a 
boy and learned the game from his brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Now, at 44, his amazing golf feats have made him the talk of the town in 
Avalon. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me feel like I can do something," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After a moment's thought, he added, "This is about all I do." 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when Saldana thought he would never do much of anything again. 
</P>
<P>
He was a 24-year-old specialist fourth class when, during a midday Viet Cong 
ambush in 1969, a rocket grenade hit the ammunition can in the personnel 
carrier he was driving. In the blast's aftermath, his right hand dangled from 
his wrist; it was later removed at a field hospital. The muscles in his left 
arm were severely damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Reminders remain. His left arm is scarred, and he says the stump throbs and his 
ears ring constantly. 
</P>
<P>
After the ambush, Saldana spent 3 1/2 months in a Veterans Administration 
hospital in San Francisco, then returned to Avalon. "I was all bummed out," he 
said. "I didn't want to go out." 
</P>
<P>
A 1963 graduate of Avalon High School, Saldana had been a volunteer fireman 
before he was drafted, and had hoped to join the Avalon Fire Department after 
the service. "I didn't think about it after that, didn't think it would work 
out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He had also worked at the Catalina Bird Farm. But the farm, a home to the 
exotic birds he fed, had closed by the time Saldana returned from the war -- 
not that he would have had much interest in working there again. 
</P>
<P>
"For three years I didn't want to do anything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he had the support of many friends and his close-knit family. "All I did 
was hang around them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Martan Saldana, a gardener, moved to Santa Catalina Island from Mexico in 1919. 
He met Margarita Mesa a year later, and they soon were married. All of their 
children have stayed on the island. 
</P>
<P>
Angie Romo, 65, and Isabel Lopez, 64, are homemakers; Margarita Ponce, 58, is 
an employee of the Catalina By the Sea souvenir shop; Ruth Sampson, 55, works 
at Leo's Drug Store; Frank Saldana, 53, works at Abe's Liquor Store; Herman, 
51, helps take care of the island's interior; Joe, 50, is the golf club 
champion; Sylvester, 48, owns a landscaping business, and Lolo, 60, runs the 
barber shop. The oldest brother, Martan, 61, died last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody cares about everybody here," Richard Saldana said. "When I was in 
the hospital, I got a shoe box full of letters from the island. All of my 
family and friends visited me." 
</P>
<P>
Sampson recalled the time her brother came home from San Francisco: "We felt 
worse than he did. I took care of the wounds, he had a lot of shrapnel in his 
arms." 
</P>
<P>
The sweet smell of a green liquid called Osage Rub, which Lolo applies to the 
heads of his customers, filled his barber shop. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty much all over town," he said about his brother's latest ace. 
"Bobby Piacentini was in here the other day and said, 'Geez, I've played golf 
for 35 years and haven't got one.' " 
</P>
<P>
The walls of the sports-oriented shop are busy with pennants, photos and 
paintings, as well as rosters of youth baseball teams. 
</P>
<P>
The Saldanas have stayed on Catalina, Lolo said, because of its slow pace and 
their sense of belonging. "We're all involved in community activities," said 
the barber, whose son, Gilbert, is a former Avalon mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Jordan, whose hair was being cut, is the handicap chairman at the golf 
course. He assessed Richard Saldana's golfing ability: "An excellent putter. 
Not really long on his drives, but steady. Nerves of steel." 
</P>
<P>
"He's proud," Lolo chimed in. "What he does, he likes to do right." 
</P>
<P>
During his long rehabilitation, Richard Saldana had figured that he was through 
with golf. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to play," he said. "I had a hook screwed into my stump and it was 
attached to a golf club, but it didn't work right. So I forgot about it. Gave 
my clubs away." 
</P>
<P>
Roger Cadman, 40, who cleans fish at the Avalon Fish Market, remembered the day 
during that period when he tricked Saldana into showing him how to hit a golf 
ball. "He hit the ball well with his left hand," Cadman said. "I think he was 
surprised. It got his confidence up." 
</P>
<P>
Saldana, who has an 11 handicap, shot his first hole in one eight years ago. 
Two years later, he got two in a week. All of his aces have occurred at the 
Catalina course: two on the 114-yard second hole; two on the 124-yard sixth; 
three on the 159-yard ninth, and one -- the most recent -- on the 203-yard 
seventh. 
</P>
<P>
He finds it hard to pinpoint a reason for such stunning success. "Yeah, it does 
surprise me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday afternoon, Saldana was teamed with O'Jibway, Gil Voci and Jim 
Wright in a best-ball match. 
</P>
<P>
"The town hustler we call him," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I just play," Saldana said, laughing softly. Nonetheless, Saldana, who 
gets a monthly veteran's disability pension, gladly pocketed his winnings after 
the match. 
</P>
<P>
He lives with fiancee Kathy Emerson in the same three-story house, with its 
post-card view of rooftops and the harbor, where he has lived since he was in 
the sixth grade. 
</P>
<P>
He appreciates it when the Catalina Islander weekly newspaper runs a little 
item on him now and then, but he does not believe he is considered a celebrity. 
"I doubt it," he said. "I'm just around here." 
</P>
<P>
He usually takes a walk in the morning, then goes to the nine-hole course to 
play two, sometimes three rounds of golf a day. But the best time comes late in 
the afternoon at Silky's, a bar near the course named for Silky Reyes, who was 
the pro there when Saldana was a youngster. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, there was a baseball game on the TV, the mountaintops could be 
seen through the small square windows up near the ceiling, and the beer and 
sports talk flowed in liberal amounts. 
</P>
<P>
Saldana kept his hat on and sat at a table with a group that included Voci, 
O'Jibway, Jordan and Joe Machado. 
</P>
<P>
"He's such a nice person," said O'Jibway, a short-haired, red-faced man who 
rents boats. "He does anything to help you out." 
</P>
<P>
Teri Gill, a regular at Silky's, came over to the table. She looked at Saldana 
and said to a visitor, "He's one of the most special guys in the world." 
</P>
<P>
The guys at the barber shop had probably been right about the helmet having 
saved Saldana's life. 
</P>
<P>
But in this room, with the sun slanting in on the one-handed man who could not 
have looked happier, it was clear that it was golf that saved it the second 
time.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOORPARK; 
</P>
<P>
VOLUNTARY WATER GUIDELINES ADOPTED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Moorpark will mount a campaign to get residents and area farmers to 
use less water under a voluntary water conservation program the City Council 
has unanimously adopted. 
</P>
<P>
The council wants to cut water use by 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers use 45% of the 40 million gallons of water consumed annually in Ventura 
County Waterworks District No. 1, an area that includes the city of Moorpark 
and surrounding farms. 
</P>
<P>
But county agricultural officials say that farmers are cutting back as much as 
possible and pay the highest rates in the county for their water. 
</P>
<P>
But some council members said they believe that farmers are not doing enough to 
conserve. County water officials are considering new billing rates that would 
penalize the largest agricultural consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Eloise Brown on Thursday criticized "wasteful usage" by 
agricultural users at a time when households are being asked to cut back on 
common household uses. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark's voluntary conservation campaign aims to change the water-wasting 
habits of private citizens in their own homes by getting residents to be 
conscious of conserving water when washing clothes, showering and brushing 
their teeth. There are no fines attached to the voluntary measure. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign to reduce water use was ordered by the Calleguas Municipal Water 
District, which supplies about 7,400 Moorpark households and 88 surrounding 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said the conservation measures are an attempt to prevent 
shortages in 1991. Most of the city's water supplies are shipped to Moorpark 
through the state water project. A fourth of the water used in the city comes 
from local ground-water sources. PSYCHE PASCUAL

RADIO NURSE'S SPECIALTY: CANDID TALK ABOUT SEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From tiny KFOX-FM in Redondo Beach, JoAnn Woodward -- no relation to Paul 
Newman -- tells Los Angeles whatever it wants to know about sex every Wednesday 
morning on "South Bay Sex." 
</P>
<P>
Although other programs feature doctors or psychologists who dispense advice 
about sex and other topics, hers is the only radio talk show in the Los Angeles 
basin devoted exclusively to sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
Woodward, a certified nurse practitioner, said she began the show, which is 
oriented toward women, three years ago because she believed "women have a lot 
of questions that they need answered." Since then, she has attracted a small 
but devoted audience that includes counselors who advise their clients to tune 
in. 
</P>
<P>
The program is aired from 8:30 until 9 a.m. on KFOX (93.5 FM), a station that 
sells time to people who want to produce their own broadcasts. The eclectic mix 
on KFOX has included a feminist businesswoman's program, fundamentalist 
religion and a dating service. 
</P>
<P>
The station, with offices just off the Redondo Beach Pier, reaches an area 
stretching from Malibu to Laguna Beach and inland as far as downtown Los 
Angeles, the San Fernando Valley and Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Although Woodward's breezy presentation, intermixed with advertisements for her 
nursing practice, is not the polished professional format found on larger 
stations, she has dealt with topics many others would not touch. 
</P>
<P>
Some recent programs have been devoted to masturbation, the role of the 
clitoris in society, sexually transmitted diseases (with graphic descriptions 
of symptoms), and the latest in condoms, a model designed for women. 
</P>
<P>
"I swear I'm not making it up," she said of the last topic. "They call me the 
Dr. Ruth of the South Bay." 
</P>
<P>
Although she speaks frankly on the air, Woodward said she has not been a target 
of obscene or abusive phone calls, even after a program devoted to the subject 
of abortion. "I have never gotten calls from fundamentalists," said Woodward, 
who described her program as a "pro-choice show." 
</P>
<P>
This week, Woodward's guest was Shelley Lessin Stockwell, a former airline 
stewardess and author of the forthcoming book, "Sex and Other Touchy Subjects." 
</P>
<P>
"We'll keep all the flight attendant jokes out of this," Woodward told 
Stockwell in opening the program. "What got you interested in the field of 
sexuality?" 
</P>
<P>
"I was raised in the school of the double standard," Stockwell said. "It was 
very clearly brought home that my job in life was to remain a virgin, go to 
college, snag myself a nice, professional man using my sexuality as the bait 
and have lots of children and live happily ever after." 
</P>
<P>
Stockwell said that plan was derailed in the 1970s "when people were going hog 
crazy wild." She recalled once going with her gynecologist to "some people's 
house, and they were having an orgy. I was horrified. It was so opposite to the 
way I have been raised. That was my first sexual eye-opener to how people were 
behaving in the 1970s." 
</P>
<P>
Some time later, she said, she made love to her boyfriend "in a very loving 
relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, she said, "all I could think of is, 'They lied to me. They told me 
-- they meaning society, my parents -- that if you made love before you got 
married, that a man would use you, he wouldn't respect you and the relationship 
would end, basically, because you had to be a virgin. 
</P>
<P>
"And what I found was that we were closer and more bonded and more intimate, 
and I felt so cheated that I had wasted all that time when I could have been 
intimate because of that obscure rule that didn't make any sense to me." 
</P>
<P>
At this, Woodward interjected, "However, we don't recommend that you have 
sexual activity until you are ready for it." 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, Stockwell took a call from a woman identifying herself as 
Camille. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been involved in a monogamous relationship for years, for well before 
AIDS became a household word," Camille began. 
</P>
<P>
"And recently that relationship ended and I started to date again. I would like 
your perspective on how to approach the subject of AIDS with a prospective 
lover . . . how soon in a relationship it should be approached, and in a way 
that it is not calculating." 
</P>
<P>
Stockwell responded: "Well, I don't think at hors d'oeuvres at your first 
dinner date would be appropriate. 'Gee, it's so nice to meet you. What a lovely 
suit, and by the way, do you have AIDS?' 
</P>
<P>
"But somewhere early on, maybe after the first smooch or something. I don't 
know. What do you think, JoAnn? You're an expert on this." 
</P>
<P>
Woodward advised posing the question early in the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"It's never too soon to approach it," she said. "It's important for you to talk 
about it because it's on everybody's mind. I think that a person who hears you 
talk about it will have a lot of respect for your self-esteem and how highly 
you value your health and safety." 
</P>
<P>
Camille seemed a bit dubious about this. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I'll give it a wing," she said with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
Stockwell took one more call, from a woman who wanted to know how to put aside 
workday worries when she gets home from the office. 
</P>
<P>
The answer: Visualize a shelf attached to the outside of your house and imagine 
yourself making a tidy package of "work." Place the package on the shelf and 
ignore it until it's time to leave for work the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
In the early days of the program, Woodward confided in an interview, she asked 
friends to call in questions, but she said that is no longer necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first did this show three years ago, I had 'prepped' callers, but my 
friends have long since stopped calling. You can't ask someone every Wednesday 
morning, 'Do me a favor. . . .' It ended a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
Although KFOX does not subscribe to the Arbitron radio audience rating service, 
Woodward and others say that "South Bay Sex" has a devoted audience. 
</P>
<P>
Brooke McIntyre, South Bay Free Clinic's services director, said Woodward is 
serving a useful purpose. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot more people are coming in for checkups as a result of her show," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She added: "People I know as friends comment about her show and how informative 
it was and how wonderful it was for them." 
</P>
<P>
Cam McCarthy, a licensed marriage, family and child counselor in Manhattan 
Beach, advises her clients to tune in to Woodward. 
</P>
<P>
"She will answer things over the air that everyone wanted to know but never had 
the guts to ask. You can listen to it while you are washing the dishes or 
driving a car or whatever. . . . It reaches people who aren't going to be 
reached in other ways."

$42,000, DRUGS SEIZED IN RAIDS; 5 ARRESTED

Four men and a woman suspected of operating a large cocaine sales ring have 
been arrested in a series of raids following a two-month investigation by five 
Ventura County law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"These people had the capacity of selling kilos at a time," said Oxnard Police 
Sgt. Joe Munoz. 
</P>
<P>
Police confiscated 56 grams of cocaine and $42,000 in cash during raids 
Wednesday on three residences in Oxnard, Port Hueneme and Ventura. Also seized 
were 10 guns, four vehicles, sales records and assorted drug paraphernalia, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have evidence that we missed some of the dope that had just been 
distributed," Munoz said. "But you need cash to buy the drugs and we got that." 
</P>
<P>
Arrested were Oxnard residents Raymond Chaparro, Erma Hernandez and Lance 
Williams, all 23. Also arrested were Todd Gamboa, 26, of Ventura and Raul 
Losaya of Port Hueneme, Munoz said. 
</P>
<P>
All five are being held at Ventura County Jail on bail ranging from $20,000 to 
$100,000, Munoz said. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez was arraigned Thursday on charges of possession of a controlled 
substance with intent to sell. The others will be arraigned today, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The operation was the result of a lengthy investigation by the police 
departments of Oxnard, Ventura and Port Hueneme; the Ventura County district 
attorney's office; and the local branch of the federal Drug Enforcement 
Administration, Munoz said. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, two men were arrested in Port Hueneme after an ounce of 
methamphetamine was found in their car, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Michael Crawford, 24, of Port Hueneme and Mark Cousineau, 28, 
of Oxnard after the drug was discovered during a car search. SANTIAGO O'DONNELL

$33-MILLION FUND INCREASE NO CURE FOR STRAPPED CITY, LOCKWOOD SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most of the debate over City Manager John Lockwood's record $1.2-billion budget 
proposal has focused on whether City Council should increase taxes and fees 
Lockwood says are needed if the city wants to maintain police, fire and 
sanitation services during the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
Almost lost in the debate is the fact that Lockwood's budget would increase the 
general fund, which is used to pay for many basic city services, by $33 million 
to $444 million. That increase, critics maintain, is more than enough to keep 
service levels from sliding. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not as simple as that, Lockwood says. Lockwood explains that the 
$33-million increase will barely cover a handful of expenses included in his 
proposed budget. For example, Lockwood said, the $33-million increase won't 
even cover two big-ticket items: inflation, which will raise next year's costs 
by $28 million, and the costs associated with settling lawsuits, which are 
expected to approach $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
With just inflation and litigation expenses, "you're already in the red" when 
it comes to the $33-million increase, said Lockwood, who said that nearly $60 
million in new revenue is needed to keep services at their present level. 
</P>
<P>
With just $33 million, "there's not one penny there, to maintain the existing 
ratio of police officers to residents, or to keep libraries, recreation centers 
and swimming pools open," Lockwood said. 
</P>
<P>
Why is the current budget crunch so much worse than past crunches? 
</P>
<P>
"There seem to be a lot of chickens coming home to roost," said Jim Ryan, 
executive director of the San Diego County Taxpayers Assn. "There's always been 
a financial rope to grab onto in the past." 
</P>
<P>
"But a lot of things are coming to a head," Ryan said. "It's a watershed year 
for local government financing because a lot of concerns about the effects of 
Proposition 13 that were raised (years ago) have come home to roost." 
</P>
<P>
The budget crisis "has been a kind of a creeping thing," according to J. P. 
Fowler, who chaired the Citizens Finance Committee that, in January, predicted 
the crunch. "It's been building, building, building . . . since 1979 when 
Proposition 13 went into place." 
</P>
<P>
"On one hand, it's been the intent of the voters to limit revenue growth from 
property taxes," Fowler said. "But, at the same time, they've continued to 
press each and every council to fund new programs." 
</P>
<P>
But the upcoming year's budget is sorely lacking in the "one-time money" that 
council has used to ease past budget crunches, Lockwood said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the council last year bolstered the size of the general fund by 
using $10 million earmarked for capital improvements and other projects. That 
money was used to hire more police officers and pay other operating costs, but 
it made it difficult to fund those programs during the upcoming year because 
"there is no one-time money this time," Lockwood said. 
</P>
<P>
Most experts agree that "one-time money should go for one-time capital 
improvement projects, not operations," Lockwood said. "We always knew that 
would come back to bite us in the behind." 
</P>
<P>
But San Diego has often done just that: During the 1980s, for example, the city 
used a multimillion-dollar legal settlement to fund after-school recreation 
programs. Lockwood on Tuesday recommended that those programs be dropped 
because funding has evaporated. Several years ago, the city used $10 million 
from the sale of the old Sears property in Normal Heights to fund operations. 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood offered a long string of examples of where the city must find new 
funds -- or cut existing services -- to pay its bills. Among them are: 
</P>
<P>
Next year, the city will pay $1 million for new programs mandated by federal 
and state agencies. (These programs include such items as new work boots 
required for certain jobs and boiler inspections mandated for the first time.). 
</P>
<P>
The city must pay $2.8 million to operate and maintain new city parks, a fire 
station and 75 new traffic lights. For the most part these are projects paid 
for by developers, but the operating costs must be paid by the city. 
</P>
<P>
The city would have to pay $1.7 million to create 37 new police officer 
positions that would maintain the city's current ratio of 1.68 officers per 
1,000 residents. Similarly, it would have to pay $3.2 million to "maintain the 
current level of service for . . . fire apparatus replacement, staffing of 
three new municipal courts and other similar items." 
</P>
<P>
Because of an accounting technique known as "annualization," the upcoming 
budget must also include salaries for police officers and civilian employees 
whose full salaries were authorized but, in many cases, not completely funded 
during the current year. Annualization costs for police and civilian employees 
will top $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood has listed nearly a dozen "big-ticket" items that will increase the 
upcoming budget, but not necessarily increase the level of service. 
</P>
<P>
For example, he has budgeted $28 million for inflation. That amount, he said, 
is needed to finance an estimated $12 million in promised wage increases as 
well as $11 million to restore supply budgets that the council last year froze 
in order to cut general fund expenses, along with other inflation-related 
items. 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood maintains that the city, which agreed to pay a record $25 million in 
lawsuit settlements during the current year, expects litigation awards to hit 
nearly $20 million during the coming year. Because the city ran out of funds to 
cover settlements, it will use $6 million of next year's general fund to pay 
for settlements reached during the current year.

2 MEN FACE CHARGES OF MAIL FRAUD; 
</P>
<P>
ARRAIGNMENTS: THE ENCINO RESIDENTS ARE ACCUSED OF BILKING 150 INVESTORS OUT OF 
$1.2 MILLION IN A BOGUS OIL WELL SCHEME IN 1984 AND 1985. 
</P>

<P>
Two Encino men who allegedly bilked investors out of more than $1.2 million by 
selling shares in bogus oil wells will be arraigned Monday in federal court on 
charges of mail fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Stanford, 42, and Anthony Colagreco, 32, promised more than 150 investors 
from around the country substantial returns on shares in oil-producing wells 
owned by American Southwest Petroleum Ltd., according to a federal indictment 
unsealed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The shares, which sold for between $2,500 and $3,000 each, were for wells that 
salesmen said were already producing oil, although only one well ever produced 
oil, the indictment charges. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford and Colagreco will each face 19 counts of mail fraud in U. S. District 
Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment was the culmination of a joint investigation of the offices of 
the U. S. Attorney and the Los Angeles County district attorney, said Terree 
Bowers of the U.S. Attorney's Office. The two offices have cooperated in the 
past to prosecute oil and gas investment scams operating in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford was arrested Thursday by postal inspectors and was released later on 
$25,000 bail and also was required to post additional property, Bowers said. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford's attorney, Tom Nolan, said the charges were unfounded but refused 
further comment. 
</P>
<P>
Bail had not been set for Colagreco, who was not arrested because of a deal 
between his attorney and investigators, said Don M. Tamura of the district 
attorney's office. Colagreco's attorney did not return telephone calls 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, Stanford and Colagreco operated American 
Southwest, a telephone sales operation in West Los Angeles, in 1984 and 1985. 
Telephone salesmen, who called themselves account executives, solicited 
prospective investors and were offered shares in wells already producing oil in 
Oklahoma and Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment charges that only one well owned by the company ever produced 
oil. Other wells drilled by the company at three locations produced only water. 
A fourth location touted as having oil-producing wells was never drilled, the 
indictment claims. 
</P>
<P>
To maintain the appearance that the wells were producing oil, Stanford and 
Colagreco mailed progress reports detailing false production levels, Bowers 
said. They also sent small checks to investors, claiming that they were 
returns, he said. Stanford and Colagreco returned about $38,000 to investors, 
according to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment also alleges that American Southwest was established in October, 
1984, with $50,000 solicited from a woman who was promised that her money would 
be invested in oil wells.

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 MEN FOUND DEAD IN CAR ON DESERT ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives are investigating the apparent murders 
of two men whose bodies were found Thursday in a car on a dirt road in the 
eastern Antelope Valley desert near the San Bernardino County line, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The two men, both about 30, have not been identified, Sheriff's Deputy Dean 
Scoville said. 
</P>
<P>
The car with the bodies was spotted by deputies patrolling in a sheriff's 
helicopter about 9:50 a.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The body of a white or Hispanic man was in the front passenger seat of the 1978 
Oldsmobile, and the body of a black man was in the back seat, Scoville said. 
</P>
<P>
The men appeared to have suffered multiple gunshot wounds from a handgun or 
rifle, according to a source close to the investigation.

<P>
But Scoville would not say whether the men had been shot or bludgeoned, 
confirming only that both suffered head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The men appeared to have been dead between one and two days, but it is not 
clear where they were killed, Scoville said. 
</P>
<P>
The car was parked on Black Butte Basin Road, a dirt road amid desert buttes 
north of California 138 and about three miles west of the county line, Scoville 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are trying to determine whether the car belonged to one of the 
victims, Scoville said.

TRAFFIC DEATH PLEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Heather Tolles of South Pasadena pleaded not guilty Thursday in South Bay 
Municipal Court to two counts of murder and three other felony charges stemming 
from a May 5 traffic collision in Manhattan Beach that killed a pregnant woman. 
</P>
<P>
Tolles, 19, is charged with the murder of Laura Obele, 26, and her fetus. 
</P>
<P>
The Manhattan Beach woman was scheduled to give birth to a baby boy three weeks 
after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Tolles, who was allegedly under the influence of LSD, is also charged with 
vehicular manslaughter, driving under the influence of drugs and evading a 
police officer. 
</P>
<P>
She is scheduled to face a preliminary hearing June 12 in South Bay Municipal 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
Police say Tolles and a friend took LSD outside a Saturday afternoon Grateful 
Dead concert at Cal State Dominguez Hills in Carson, then drove through 
Manhattan Beach. Tolles allegedly ran a red light while driving north on 
Highland Avenue and collided with Obele, who was driving east on Manhattan 
Beach Boulevard, just four blocks from her apartment.

LAGOMARSINO ON CHILD CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iam outraged that Rep. Bob Lagomarsino plans to vote against his own child-care 
bill, as he stated in an article in The Times on April 13. 
</P>
<P>
If he is indeed concerned about the cost, then he should vote against the B-2 
bomber and save enough money to fund many child-care programs. Children, our 
most precious possessions, are relegated to the lowest priorities of our 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Lagomarsino, I challenge you to rethink your values and your vote.

SPECIAL SCHOOL PARLEYS RESCHEDULED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Centinela Valley Union High School District trustees have rescheduled a series 
of private get-togethers that were canceled last week after a group of 
protesters took seats in the room where the discussions were to take place. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-minute, private sessions -- designed to give parents, teachers, students 
and community members a chance to talk to individual trustees about racial 
tensions in the district -- have been set for May 21 in the board room where 
last week's demonstration occurred. 
</P>
<P>
In accordance with open-meeting guidelines for elected bodies, no more than two 
trustees will be present at any get-together. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the predominantly Latino school board said the sessions were 
scheduled as part of a 10-point plan to help ease the district's racial 
tensions. But several black groups, including the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People, objected to the meetings because they replaced 
two regular board meetings. 
</P>
<P>
A second series of sessions is set for June 12. Anyone interested in attending 
a meeting with a trustee must sign up at the district's personnel office 
between June 4 and June 8, Trustee Jacqueline Carrera said. 
</P>
<P>
Though trustees will consider calling police if protesters try to disrupt the 
newly scheduled sessions, "I'm hoping it won't come to that," Carrera said.

'Family Leave' Bill 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 237 to 187, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 770) requiring 
private employers of at least 50 workers, state and local governments and 
members of Congress to institute "family leave" as a job benefit. These 
employers would have to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave each year to 
enable parents to care for a new child or ailing parent, spouse or child. 
Seriously ill employees could use the time for personal medical leave. 
Leave-takers would retain any medical insurance provided for them and be 
assured of returning to the job they left or its equivalent. 
</P>
<P>
Federal employees would get broader benefits, receiving up to 18 weeks of 
family leave over two years and 26 weeks of unpaid medical leave annually. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Sherwood Boehlert (R-N.Y.) said: "We talk about family values in this 
town a lot," and it is time to act. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Robert S. Walker (R-Pa.) said: "This is not a family bill but another 
big government welfare-oriented kind of bill." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to pass the bill.

Leave Bill Provisions 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 155 to 264, the House rejected a motion to replace key provisions 
of the family leave bill (above) with a two-year study of the issue and a pilot 
program conducted among House employees. Sponsor Fred Grandy (R-Iowa) said his 
motion would "make us the guinea pig for a change." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Marge Roukema (R-N.J.) said the motion "simply guts the bill." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to study the need for a family leave law.

Amtrak Funding 
</P>
<P>
The House approved, 322 to 93, the conference report on a bill (HR 2364) 
providing Amtrak with an average annual subsidy of $670 million between fiscal 
1989-92. The Senate later sent the bill to the White House. Taxpayers last year 
covered nearly 30% of the cost of operating Amtrak's rail passenger service to 
almost 500 communities. President Bush urges no federal funding of Amtrak and 
threatens to veto the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"This country would lose its national rail passenger service" without a federal 
subsidy, said supporter Thomas A. Luken (D-Ohio). 
</P>
<P>
Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) said: "The only cure for deficit spending is to cut 
that spending." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to authorize the federal subsidy of Amtrak.

Leave Bill Provisions 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 155 to 264, the House rejected a motion to replace key provisions 
of the family leave bill (above) with a two-year study of the issue and a pilot 
program conducted among House employees. Sponsor Fred Grandy (R-Iowa) said his 
motion would make those in Congress "the guinea pig for a change." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Marge Roukema (R-N.J.) said the motion "simply guts the bill." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to study the need for a family leave law.

Amtrak Funding 
</P>
<P>
The House approved, 322 to 93, the conference report on a bill (HR 2364) 
providing Amtrak with an average annual subsidy of $670 million between fiscal 
years 1989 and 1992. The Senate later sent the bill to the White House. 
Taxpayers last year covered nearly 30% of the cost of operating Amtrak's rail 
passenger service to almost 500 communities. President Bush urges no federal 
funding of Amtrak and threatens to veto the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"This country would lose its national rail passenger service" without a federal 
subsidy, said supporter Thomas A. Luken (D-Ohio). 
</P>
<P>
Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) said, "The only cure for deficit spending is to cut 
that spending." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to authorize the federal subsidy of Amtrak.

Sheriff's deputies are investigating what appears to be the murder-suicide of a 
67-year-old man and his 65-year-old ex-wife in the man's mobile home in San 
Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies Wednesday found the body of Ruth Estella Klauer on the living-room 
floor and that of Ernest Hall on the bed in the master bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
Hall had a revolver in his hand. 
</P>
<P>
About 5:30 p.m. Wednesday, deputies were summoned to the mobile home in the 
1900 block of San Marcos Boulevard by neighbors because a car was parked in the 
driveway, but lights in the home had been on for a few days. 
</P>
<P>
Klauer lived in the 3600 block of Village Circle in Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary investigation indicated that Hall shot his ex-wife, then himself, 
sheriff's deputies said.

A fire in a Leucadia market caused $75,000 damage to the structure owned by an 
Oceanside businessman, according to an Encinitas Fire Department spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Catherine Carne said the fire was reported at 12:21 a.m. Thursday,

Carlsbad fought the "difficult and smoky fire." 
</P>

No injuries were reported.

San Diego County sheriff's deputies said transients were seen sleeping near the 
Royal Liquor Deli, owned by Amir G. Abdou, 38, before the fire started in an 
outside storage area. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department arson unit is assisting fire officials in determining 
the cause of the fire, Carne said.

A 21-year-old San Diego motorist was shot in the left arm Thursday shortly 
after he left Interstate 5, in what police said was a random shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Newman had taken the Sassafrass Street exit about 11:30 a.m. and was 
stopped at a traffic light with his arm hanging out the window. Suddenly, he 
felt pain just above his left elbow. He had been shot, police spokesman Bill 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Newman drove home, and relatives took him to Sharp Memorial Hospital, Robinson 
said. A hospital spokeswoman said Newman was in good condition and was 
scheduled to undergo surgery.

A Cessna 152 crash-landed on its approach to Montgomery Field Thursday evening, 
killing the pilot, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police Sgt. Jim Clear said details of the crash, which occurred shortly before 
6 p.m., were sketchy but that the plane went down on the east end of the 
runway, which is on the eastern side of the airport property. 
</P>
<P>
He said the victim, identified only as a male, died at the scene. There were no 
passengers, Clear said, and no one on the ground was injured. 
</P>
<P>
"The plane was pretty scrunched up," he said, "but there was no fire at all 
from the crash." 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the crash was unclear, and Federal Aviation Administration 
investigators were still examining the wreckage late Wednesday night.

WESTHEAD TELLS GRADS NOT TO BE AFRAID TO TAKE A SHOT

Basketball coaches aren't often chosen to give commencement addresses, but then 
coaches don't often have the academic background of Loyola Marymount's Paul 
Westhead, who has a master's degree in literature. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead was a popular choice as the featured speaker at Loyola's graduation 
ceremonies Saturday, and mixed literary and sports allusions in his speech. 
"Don't be afraid of failure," he told the graduating class, which included 
scoring players Bo Kimble and Jeff Fryer from this year's team that made the 
NCAA's final eight. 
</P>
<P>
"So what if you miss," Westhead said. "Look at our basketball team. Do you 
think Bo Kimble or Jeff Fryer ever worried about missing a shot? . . . Whatever 
you endeavor go out and take a whole bunch of shots -- the next one will go in. 
There will be times in your future when you will feel whipped, beaten, done. 
It's OK to call a timeout, to get away from the action; but come back refreshed 
and running the system faster than ever. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no limit if you believe in yourself. On paper our basketball team 
should not have won a game in the NCAA -- we won three. All of you graduates 
are about to be given your varsity uniforms. The world awaits your jump. It 
will be better than you have done so far. You are well prepared, well trained. 
You are the best. You are Lions." 
</P>
<P>
Westhead then bid a sentimental farewell: "As a teacher of writing, I searched 
for the exact word to fit my meaning. Au revoir -- too much like perfume. Ciao 
-- too quick. Arrivederci -- sounds like lunch. Sayonara -- too sad, and Marlon 
Brando beat me to it. Goodby -- goodby makes the journey harder still (a Cat 
Stevens lyric). And then I found it. My collegiate years of studying -- or 
should I say struggling with -- German provided me with the exact words. Auf 
wiedersehen. Till we meet again. And we will meet again." 
</P>
<P>
Toro Awards: Cal State Dominguez Hills pitcher Armando Gomez, outfielder George 
Scott and infielder Fred Camarena were named to the all-California Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. baseball first team, and first baseman Darrell Conner received 
second-team honors. Toro catcher Mike Gabbani was given honorable mention. 
</P>
<P>
Top award winners in the CCAA were UC Riverside's Pete Weber, player of the 
year, and Jack Smitheran, coach of the year, and Cal State Northridge's Craig 
Clayton, who was pitcher of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills also announced its annual award winners, with soccer players 
receiving four of the five honors. Joe Flanagan won the male student-athlete 
award, Kristi White won the female student-athlete award, Mark Lincir was named 
male scholar-athlete and Jeanine Charroux was named female scholar-athlete. 
Lincir and Charroux are both nominees for Academic All-America honors. 
</P>
<P>
The only winner from another sport was basketball player Kevin Shaw, who 
received the Richard Butwell Senior Award. That award, named for the school's 
late president, is given to a senior who has lived up to academic and athletic 
standards and shown community involvement as well. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Marymount's Tim Williams, the baseball team's top left-handed power 
hitter, said references to his 5-foot-9 stature do not bother him. 
</P>
<P>
"One (scout) told me, 'If you were 6-2, you'd be a top-five pick,' " Williams 
said. "A couple scouts have told me, 'We hope you grow a little.' I used to 
worry about it. Now I look at (major leaguers) Rickey Henderson, Brett Butler, 
Lonnie Smith. Height doesn't mean anything. It's all in the mind." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Williams is taller than recent Hall of Fame inductee Joe Morgan, one 
of the top power hitters of the 1970s, and 1930s star Hack Wilson, who still 
holds the National League record for home runs in a season with 56. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 5-9," Williams said. "What's wrong with that? The thing that helps me is 
I'm left-handed. There's a scarce supply of left-handed guys in the outfield. 
I'm seeing more and more smaller outfielders than before. They say if you're 
small you've got to be twice as good. 
</P>
<P>
"I say the best player and the way you perform should be the deciding factors. 
I look at Howard Johnson (of the Mets) -- he's 5-10 and he's a 30-30 
(homers-steals) guy. (Expos outfielder) Tim Raines . . . they aren't all 
6-footers, but they have heart. They don't let people's expectations bother 
them. If you can play, you can play." 
</P>
<P>
Stat of the Week: Taking a page from the basketball team, the Loyola baseball 
team has scored in double figures in five consecutive games and six of eight. 
The Lions, who average 8.7 runs, have scored 60 in the past five games. 
</P>
<P>
College Notes -- Loyola Marymount radio station KXLU-FM 88.9 will broadcast 
Saturday's baseball double-header at Pepperdine. The broadcast, featuring 
play-by-play by Brian Berger and color by Chris Kelly, will begin at 
approximately 10:50 a.m. Today's 2 p.m. game will be shown on Prime Ticket at 5 
p.m. . . . Loyola outfielder Rick Mediavilla has tied the Loyola and West Coast 
Conference record for hits in a season with 105. He leads the WCC in batting at 
.423. . . . Catcher Miah Bradbury leads the WCC in runs batted in with 63. . . 
. Pepperdine baseball Coach Andy Lopez might be on the sidelines for the 
Pepperdine series. Lopez has chickenpox. . . . Loyola forward Per Stumer has 
filed for hardship status and made himself available to the pro draft, 
according to Loyola coaches. Stumer, a Swedish native who started for two 
seasons, will probably play professionally in Europe while helping the Swedish 
National Team try to qualify for the 1992 Olympics.

MORNINGSIDE AIMING TO KEEP ITS WINNING TRACK RECORD GOING; 
</P>
<P>
PREPS: MONARCHS WILL COUNT ON LESLIE AND RELAY TEAMS TO LEAD THEM TO VICTORY IN 
SOUTHERN SECTION MEET.

<P>
At today's Southern Section divisional championships at Cerritos College, the 
Morningside High girls' track-and-field team will be one of the favorites for 
the 2-A title. 
</P>
<P>
And senior Lisa Leslie, one of the few Monarchs with championship experience, 
will be in the spotlight. She's Morningside's top entrant in the field events 
and will compete in the high jump, long jump and triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
The meet is just one part of busy week for Leslie, who Monday signed a 
basketball letter of intent to attend USC. But Coach Ron Tatum is counting on 
her to be at her best. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping we can get a good performance out of Lisa (today)," Tatum said. 
"We definitely would like to win the title -- it's something we've talked about 
since early in the season -- and she can help us do it." 
</P>
<P>
But, unlike in basketball, Leslie doesn't have the pressure of being "the 
franchise." As is the case with many outstanding track and field squads, the 
Monarchs are built around their relay teams. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside's athletes said that the relay events generate team spirit. 
</P>
<P>
"I like my individual events," said sophomore hurdler Sanoma Nickson, who also 
runs on the 400- and 1,600-meter relay teams. "But the relays are more special 
because I like working with my teammates." 
</P>
<P>
Senior Toneisha Hodges, who also runs on both relay teams, agrees with Nickson. 
"You get more pumped up (for relays) than for individual events because you're 
depending on each other," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Santisha Arnold and freshman LaShawn Stringer are anchors for 
Morningside's 400 and 1,600 relay teams, respectively. The Monarchs had the 
best qualifying times in both relays and will have girls entered in nine of the 
other 13 events. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Woodbridge, another top contender in the 2-A, is also entered in 11 
events. 
</P>
<P>
Without looking past the challenge of Woodbridge and other Southern Section 2-A 
teams, Tatum said he is already thinking about the state championships. "We 
want to go to state, not just to be there, but to score," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tatum is counting on both relays to advance to the state meet and is hopeful 
that Arnold (100 and 200), Nickson (100 hurdles) and Stringer (400) will also 
qualify. 
</P>
<P>
Nickson and Stringer are in their first season of varsity competition. 
</P>
<P>
Nickson qualified for the finals with a time of 15.08 seconds in the 100 
hurdles, only .05 seconds behind top qualifier Elinor Tolson of La Quinta. 
Stringer clocked 57.37 in the 400, the best mark in last week's preliminaries. 
</P>
<P>
Nickson said that an absence of top-flight competition in the league enabled 
Morningside to focus on the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
"I always ran to win, not for a time," Nickson said. "But now it's the big 
time, so I really have to run." 
</P>
<P>
Arnold had the 2-A's top qualifying time in the 100 (12.49) and was the No. 2 
qualifier in the 200 (25.45). Hodges (who qualified for the 200 with a time of 
26.46) is the Monarchs' leader and is confident Morningside can win the state 
title. 
</P>
<P>
Hodges is so confident, in fact, that she said Morningside's biggest fear isn't 
the competition, but injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody has to make sure to completely stretch out their muscles," she said. 
"We just have to be careful; we've come too far to mess up." 
</P>
<P>
Nickson said she is concentrating on details. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that we did well last week, but I'm a little nervous now," she said. 
"I'll be concentrating on the baton (exchange) because any little thing can go 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Hodges said that the large crowd anticipated for today's meet can also help the 
Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
"Our teammates have big mouths, so we always hear them and get fired up," she 
said. "And we usually seem to pick up a following from other people (in the 
crowd)." 
</P>
<P>
Others representing Morningside will be Rena Harris (long jump), Sherin Harris 
(400) and LaTarus Johnson (300 hurdles). 
</P>
<P>
The Morningside boys are also entered in both relay events today. The Monarchs 
had a season-best time of 3:21.74 in the 1,600 relay, despite having to shuffle 
their lineup at the last moment due to injuries. 
</P>
<P>
That mark gave them the best time in the field. Morningside's 400 relay team 
qualified with a time of 43.19 seconds, which was second only to Lompoc 
(42.75). 
</P>
<P>
A dominant performer in the boys' triple jump will make it tough on three South 
Bay athletes at the Southern Section 2-A finals. 
</P>
<P>
St. Bernard's Martin Smith (45-7 qualifying mark), Morningside's Dennis Savage 
(45-1 1/4) and Torrance's Bryce Yamaguchi (44-7 1/4) will have to battle 
Magnolia's Phoupet Singbandith, who set the 2-A record in last week's 
preliminaries with a jump of 49-11 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Enna Serina (33-3 qualifying mark in the shot put) and junior Joe 
LoGuidice (15.63 in the 110 high hurdles) will represent Miraleste in the 
Southern Section 1-A finals. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Montgomery's Nicole Haynes is only a sophomore, but she is a veteran of 
the Southern Section finals. She is entered in the 3-A finals in the 200 and 
400 runs and both relays. Last year, she finished sixth and fifth, 
respectively, in the 200 and 400, which didn't meet her goals. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, I was nervous," she said. "Now I feel more confident." 
</P>
<P>
Haynes qualified for the finals with a personal best of 57.4 seconds in the 
400, which was the second-best qualifying mark. And she said that she is 
capable of improving that time by almost a full second. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, I've been preparing with different workouts," she said. "I've been 
doing more speed work, not so much on distances, and that's bringing my times 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Haynes said her experience from last year's finals is providing her with a lot 
of motivation. "I really want to do well since I didn't last year," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In the 400 relay of the Southern Section 4-A girls' finals Friday, Hawthorne 
(47.69 qualifying time) and Torrance (49.91) will be trying to chase down 
favorite Pasadena Muir (47.07). 
</P>
<P>
In the same meet, Melissa Fair and Jennifer Valliere will form the Rolling 
Hills team. Fair had the fifth-best qualifying time in the 1,600 (5:09.5) last 
week. Valliere had the fifth-best mark in the 400 (58.78).

CAL LUTHERAN FALTERS AGAINST HAWAII PACIFIC IN NAIA AREA 1 BASEBALL PLAYOFF 
OPENER, 5-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A late-inning breakdown proved disastrous for Cal Lutheran in the first game of 
the NAIA Area 1 baseball playoffs Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran was tied with Hawaii Pacific going into the eighth inning but 
surrendered three runs in the final two innings to drop a 5-2 decision at the 
University of Portland's Farley Field. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 2-2, and one out in the eighth, CLU starter Mike Clark hit 
two batters. Reliever Mike Rooney entered and gave up a run-scoring double and 
run-scoring single. Rooney gave up another RBI double in the ninth, but Clark 
(6-3) got the loss. 
</P>
<P>
"Clark goes 0-2 on two guys trying to bunt, and he hits both of them, and 
that's the game," CLU Coach Rich Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
CLU (32-15) put two men on with two out in the ninth, but Hawaii Pacific 
(24-19) escaped when the next batter struck out. The Kingsmen scored a run in 
the second, when Leonard Matsumoto came home on a throwing error, and in the 
sixth, when Blake Babki scored Dave Leonhardt with a two-out single. 
</P>
<P>
CLU will play Whitworth (19-18) of Spokane, Wash., a 4-0 loser to Lewis &amp; 
Clark in another first-round game, today at 10 a.m. The Kingsmen must win four 
consecutive games to win the championship Saturday. After losing their first 
game in the District 3 playoffs last weekend, the Kingsmen rebounded to win the 
next four and the title.

BURNS RETAINS LEAD IN DIVISION II GOLF MEET, BUT NORTHRIDGE TEAM NEEDS TO CATCH 
FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Burns still has the hot clubs in the NCAA Division II golf championships, 
but he's going to need help today if Cal State Northridge is to slow Florida 
Southern's march to the title. 
</P>
<P>
Burns fired a four-under-par 68 Thursday, the lowest score of the week on the 
6,850-yard course at the Loxahatchee Country Club. He remains atop the leader 
board, and, with a three-day total of 213, holds a six-stroke advantage over 
the 90-player field. 
</P>
<P>
However, Florida Southern increased its lead in the team standings to 15 
strokes with a 294, good for 883 overall. The Moccasins led by 10 and 12 
strokes, respectively, after the first and second rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Burns, Northridge moved into a tie for second with Troy State (Ala.). 
The Matadors shot 296 Thursday, Troy 297. CSUN was second after the opening 
round; Troy State was the runner-up at the midway point. 
</P>
<P>
"Our chances of making up 15 shots (today) are not very realistic," Northridge 
Coach Jim Bracken said. "What we'll have to do is make the turn under par and 
then play even better, turn up the heat a little higher, on the last nine. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Florida Southern) have a very good team. You can't wait for them to 
collapse. We came here with a good team too. We just haven't got it done this 
week." 
</P>
<P>
Similar sentiments were echoed by Charley Matlock, who has coached FSC to four 
Division II championships and four runner-up finishes in the past 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
"For Northridge or Troy to win now," Matlock said, "they would have to have a 
couple of players shooting 72s and 73s and for us to have some in the 80s. They 
(Northridge and Troy) could do it, but it will be difficult on this golf 
course." 
</P>
<P>
With only the low four of five scores counted each day, Florida Southern has 
not had to include a round higher than 77. By comparison, Northridge has not 
had a round under 75 -- except the two by Burns -- and has had two 78s. 
</P>
<P>
"I just decided to forget about the bad attitude I had about the greens and go 
play today," said Burns, 22, a junior from Granada Hills. Hitting 17 greens in 
regulation, he had five birdies -- three on putts in the 10- to 15-foot range 
-- and one bogey, on the par-3 12th, the green he missed. 
</P>
<P>
Florida Southern's Dave McMillan is second with 219 after posting a 73 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Other results for Northridge Thursday: Jeff Sanday, 75-225; Sang Hyun, 75-230; 
Wayne Merich, 78-236; and Corby Segal, 82-236.

SOFTBALL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH TORRANCE'S 1-0 PLAYOFF VICTORY IS FIRST IN 33 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

A strong wind helped cause an error on a routine fly ball, allowing South 
Torrance High to score a 1-0 victory over visiting Capistrano Valley on 
Thursday in the first round of the Southern Section 3-A Division softball 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
With South's Angela Bean on second base, shortstop Gillian Boxx hit a lazy fly 
ball into right field that looked to be the final out of the sixth inning. But 
the ball sailed away from Capistrano Valley's Shelly Smith and popped out of 
her glove. Bean scored and Smith was charged with an error. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the game, a strong breeze blew from the west across South's diamond. 
South right fielder Tammy Hertica also made an error on a windblown fly ball, 
but the mistake didn't cost the Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
"Right field can be a killer in this ballpark," South Coach Larry Lent said. 
"It didn't hurt us any today, but it hurt them, and that was the difference in 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
It also gave South its first playoff victory in softball in 33 years. The 
Spartans (18-3) tied West Torrance for the Ocean League championship, but went 
into the playoffs as the league's No. 2 entry after losing a coin flip with 
West. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley, the fourth-place team from the South Coast League, entered 
the playoffs as an at-large team and finished 15-11. 
</P>
<P>
For three innings, Capistrano Valley freshman starter Daniela Hugelshofer kept 
South off-balance. She allowed only one hit before giving way to senior 
Jennifer Smith (10-10), who struck out four in three innings. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Smith gave up only one hit, an infield chopper between the pitcher and 
first base by Bean in the sixth. Bean advanced to second on Monica Emmrich's 
ground out, then Boxx, South's best hitter at .529, hit the fly ball that won 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
South senior Julie DeJaifre (6-1) allowed only Hugelshofer's base hit down the 
first-base line in the fourth. DeJaifre, who missed six weeks of the season 
with a broken bone in her left foot, struck out two. 
</P>
<P>
South will play either Bellflower (22-6) or Covina (14-5) in the second round 
Tuesday.

<P>
EL CAMINO SENDING CROWD TO STATE MEET ON SATURDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
El Camino College will be well represented at the state junior college track 
meet Saturday at Santa Barbara City College. Fifteen individual Warriors and 
four relay teams have qualified. 
</P>
<P>
The El Camino women's track team, which placed third in last week's Southern 
California Championships, will have a hard time defending its state title 
against this year's tougher competition, but the Warriors should come away with 
several individual titles. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, El Camino has two of the state's top distance runners. Sophomore 
Sharette Garcia, last year's 800-meter state champion, is favored to repeat. 
Freshman Diana Tracy is a strong bet in the 3,000- and 5,000-meter races. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, from Belize, won the 800 and 1,500 meters in the Southern California 
meet at Cerritos College, and Tracy, 37, swept the 3,000 and 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Adienna Thomas qualified in the 100 meters, and cross-country standout Carla 
Swain will run in the 3,000 meters. Julie Salas, a surprise qualifier, earned a 
spot in the 1,500 meters with a 4:41.49 finish at the Southern California meet. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino is also expected to rack up points in the triple jump and long jump. 
Tiesha Holmes will compete in both events, and Sharlotte McKoy and Gail Suthern 
will go for triple-jump titles. 
</P>
<P>
The women will also have 400- and 1,600-meter relay teams at the state meet. 
</P>
<P>
The El Camino men's team qualified seven individuals as well as 400- and 
1,600-meter relay teams. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman DeAndros Long qualified by winning the 800 meters in 1:52.84 at the 
Southern California meet. Sophomore Keith Davis will also compete in the 800 
meters, freshman David Haskell in the 3,000-meter steeplechase, Khevin Pratt 
and Yuli Henry in the 400 meters and Phil DeMontigny in the 1,500 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Mitchell, considered the state's best triple jumper, will go for the 
official title in Santa Barbara. The sophomore leaped 52 feet, 5 1/2 inches at 
the South Coast Conference meet April 28. 
</P>
<P>
Alan King, longtime Palos Verdes High boys' soccer coach, will replace Roy 
Janes as the Harbor College men's soccer coach next season. 
</P>
<P>
In 17 years at Palos Verdes, King compiled a 320-118-54 mark. He led the Sea 
Kings to seven Bay League titles and made the CIF 4-A semifinals nine times. 
</P>
<P>
His teams have won the past two CIF titles with a 33-0 record in 1989 and a 
29-2-2 record this past season. At Palos Verdes, King was named league coach of 
the year seven times, CIF coach of the year twice and national coach of the 
year twice. 
</P>
<P>
King will continue coaching boys' soccer and teaching at Palos Verdes while 
coaching at Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Harbor first baseman Ryan Karp isn't major league material. At least he 
didn't behave like it in the Seahawks' first playoff game against Miracosta 
College Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In back-to-back at-bats, Karp got hit in the head by Miracosta pitcher Aaron 
Mirandon and he didn't rush the mound fiercely, major league style. 
</P>
<P>
The University of Miami-bound sophomore simply jogged to first base even after 
the second hit, which bounced off his helmet and struck his neck. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor Coach Jim O'Brien said he trains players to remain calm in those 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
"We've worked at it," he said. "If you do (rush the mound), you get in a fight 
and guys get thrown out of the game. We don't think it's worth it. That's why 
we don't rush the mound first. But I'll tell you, if they do, you can bet 
they'll get a good homecoming." 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks won that game 11-5. Mirandon gave up nine hits and six runs in 
five innings. The right-handed sophomore walked two and had three wild pitches. 
</P>
<P>
It's been a terrible baseball season for the entire South Coast Conference, not 
just El Camino. The two SCC teams that reached the playoffs were eliminated in 
last week's first round. 
</P>
<P>
Defending state champion Cerritos (35-7, 19-1 in the SCC) lost to Rio Hondo, 
and Long Beach (16-23, 10-10) got wiped out by Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino handed Cerritos its only conference loss May 3, but the Warriors had 
a disappointing season under interim Coach Glen LeVier. El Camino placed fourth 
in the five-member SCC with a 6-13-1 record and was 14-21-1 overall. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors, however, weren't forgotten when all-conference teams were 
selected. Sophomore pitcher Jon Newville and sophomore infielders Cesar Rivas 
and Denny Hocking were named to the first team, first baseman Brian Wixom and 
outfielders Steve Allyn and John Otte to the second team.

GLENDALE'S BECK GATHERING MOMENTUM IN INTERMEDIATES

A single hurdle remains for Marty Beck. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale College sophomore will attempt to cap an undefeated season in the 
400-meter intermediate hurdles Saturday night in the state junior college 
championships at Santa Barbara City College. 
</P>
<P>
Beck, bound for UCLA, posted the fastest mark in the state at 50.97 seconds en 
route to winning the Southern California championships last Saturday at 
Cerritos College, and he lopped nearly a second off his previous best of 51.84 
set in the Western State Conference finals April 27. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't be in any better shape than I am now," said Beck, who placed ninth in 
last year's state meet in his first year competing in the hurdles. "I'm not 
going to place ninth this year. I'm looking to win, but I'm going to run my own 
race." 
</P>
<P>
Melanie Clarke of Valley is the favorite in the heptathlon. 
</P>
<P>
However, the freshman from El Camino Real High has been slowed by a sprained 
right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Swanson of Glendale is the leading qualifier in the high jump. Swanson 
cleared 7 feet 0 1/4 inches in the regional meet. 
</P>
<P>
Rod Carrillo of Moorpark and Ryan Rapoza of Ventura will compete in the javelin 
and decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
Other local qualifiers include Glendale's Rick Provenzano in the 800 meters 
(1:53.60) and Marji Gilles in the triple jump (37-3 1/4) and heptathlon (4,008 
points), and Ventura's Jaime Galindo in the 5,000 (14:46.21) and Simone Cain in 
the 200 (23.97) and 400 (55.00). 
</P>
<P>
Competition will begin at 10 this morning with the heptathlon. The women's 
5,000 and men's 10,000 meters will be the only finals held today. The other 
events will be contested Saturday, beginning at 3 p.m.

STATE HIGH COURT REJECTS JOB BIAS TO PROTECT WOMEN

<P>
The state Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a challenge to a trailblazing 
appellate decision that struck down a Fullerton firm's "fetal protection" 
hiring policy as discriminatory against women. 
</P>
<P>
The action came in a test case that has been widely watched because it posed a 
conflict between an employer's desire to limit workplace hazards and state 
civil rights laws aimed at curbing employment bias. 
</P>
<P>
Under the policy at issue, women of child-bearing age were barred from working 
in certain areas of a battery manufacturing plant because of the firm's concern 
that their exposure to toxic lead could cause birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
In the first such ruling of its kind in the nation, a state Court of Appeal in 
Santa Ana held last February that the restriction violated state fair 
employment laws. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief order, the state high court on Thursday refused to hear the 
company's appeal of the February decision. Four votes are required for such 
review, but none were forthcoming from the seven justices. As a result, the 
appellate decision becomes binding on trial courts throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
"This is fabulous," said Michelle A. Reinglass, secretary of the Orange County 
Bar Assn. "It's a nice sign that (the justices) are going along the lines of 
supporting employee's rights. If that fetal protection policy had been upheld, 
it would have meant that, at their whim, (employers) could engage in adverse, 
arbitrary actions against women in the workplace." 
</P>
<P>
The case was brought by Queen Elizabeth Foster, 35, of Anaheim Hills, who 
challenged the fetal-protection policy at a Fullerton facility operated by 
Johnson Controls Inc. of Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Foster said she applied for a $9-an-hour job operating a battery-assembly 
machine but was told she would be hired only if she provided medical 
documentation she was sterile. 
</P>
<P>
The high court's action came as something of a surprise. It had been 
anticipated by lawyers in the case that the court might set aside the appellate 
decision until the U.S. Supreme Court acts in a Wisconsin case raising a 
similar issue under federal fair employment law. While the federal high court 
decision would not be binding on California law, it might have proved 
persuasive to the state Supreme Court, which often looks to its federal 
counterpart for guidance. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for the state Fair Employment and Housing Commission noted that in 
the wake of Thursday's action, even if the U.S. Supreme Court eventually allows 
such policies under federal law, California -- like other states that have 
passed laws covering the subject -- will be able to bar the restrictions as 
discriminatory against women. 
</P>
<P>
"California law stands independent of federal law in this instance," said state 
Deputy Atty. Gen. Manuel M. Medeiros. "States are free to grant their workers 
more protection against discrimination than required by federal law." 
</P>
<P>
Catherine Ruckleshaus of the Employment Law Center, which represented the woman 
employee who challenged the policy, called the action "a landmark victory" for 
California workers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first ruling in the country that recognized that excluding women 
from such job opportunities in the name of protecting potential future 
offspring constitutes illegal sex discrimination," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald A. Griffin, a Los Angeles attorney representing Johnson Controls, 
expressed surprise and disappointment with the action. "I would have thought 
the state Supreme Court would have been as interested in grappling with this 
important question as the U.S. Supreme Court," said Griffin. "A case with such 
significant issues should have been heard." 
</P>
<P>
Before 1982, Johnson Controls had allowed women to take such jobs, provided 
they signed documents saying they were aware of the risks. The firm, defending 
the new policy, cited medical research showing that unborn children need more 
protection from lead than adults and that exposure to the substance can 
permanently injure the fetus's developing brain and nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
The state fair employment commission, acting on a complaint filed by Foster, 
ruled in 1987 that the policy represented illegal sex discrimination. Any risk 
to the unborn child should be left to the "sound discretion" of the worker, the 
commission said. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, an Orange County Superior Court judge overturned that decision, 
finding the restrictions permissible under state law as a means of protecting 
fetal health from industrial hazards. 
</P>
<P>
Foster's lawyers appealed, contending the policy unfairly singled out women of 
child-bearing age and that there was medical evidence men and their offspring 
could also be at risk. 
</P>
<P>
The state Court of Appeal upheld Foster and the commission, finding the policy 
was based on what it called "unfounded, unscientific stereotypic notions of 
women." 
</P>
<P>
Retired Appellate Justice Robert O. Staniforth, in an expansive attack on sex 
discrimination, said the across-the-board exclusion of women, solely on the 
basis of their fertility, unfairly prevented women from making their own 
"reasoned, informed choices" about workplace hazards. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in an era of choice," Staniforth, participating by temporary 
assignment, wrote in an opinion joined by Appellate Justices Thomas F. Crosby 
and Sheila Sonenshine. "A woman is not required to be a Victorian brood mare. 
She may, with constitutional basis, prefer not to have children." 
</P>
<P>
In other action Thursday, the justices: 
</P>
<P>
Unanimously upheld the death penalty for the slayer of a Visalia woman in a 
self-described "military mission" by three men to steal weapons from her son's 
gun collection. The court rejected an appeal by Ryan Michael Marshall, who was 
convicted of the execution-style murder of Sylva Teague in her rural home in 
January, 1985. Marshall, 18 at the time, and two others allegedly sought guns 
and ammunition intending to become mercenaries and join in a fight against 
communism in Myanmar, formerly Burma. 
</P>
<P>
Agreed to decide whether the state of California improperly shifted the costs 
of indigent health care to the counties and therefore must provide up to $400 
million annually in additional funding for such aid. 
</P>
<P>
Refused to block the proposed "nickel a drink" ballot initiative, which would 
tax beer, wine and liquor to provide funds to combat alcoholism.

A STUBBORN CANADIAN, WITH SOME HELP, IS PUTT-PUTTING THROUGH THE SKIES HOPING 
TO REINSTILL IN THE ENDANGERED TRUMPETER SWAN THE INSTINCT TO MIGRATE SOUTH.

<P>
Almost 300 years ago, trumpeter swans were so abundant in North America that 
fur trader Antoine Laumet Cadillac, approaching the shore in his pirogue near 
what is now Detroit, mistook their stately masses for a profusion of 
waterlilies. 
</P>
<P>
Soon afterward, alas, someone noticed what good pens the quills of the 
trumpeter swan made, and a great swan kill-off began. By 1932, there were only 
70 trumpeters left in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the trumpeter swan has made a faltering comeback in remote parts of 
North America, but even this modest rebound is imperiled by the bird's 
inability to migrate to its wintering grounds in the eastern United States. 
</P>
<P>
If quill fanciers and hunters failed to wipe out the swan altogether, their 
depredations did erase the bird's knowledge of migration routes, which had been 
passed on through eons from parent to cygnet. 
</P>
<P>
And so it is today that when ornithologists try to repopulate the species by 
releasing trumpeters into the wild, the birds fly off in all directions. Some 
get lost, some get shot, some go north for the winter and starve. The clever 
ones get on by hanging around the warm-water waste pools of power plants. 
</P>
<P>
"When they're not raised by their natural parents, they're morons," Harry 
Lumsden, a retired Ministry of Natural Resources biologist, said with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
Lumsden has spent a decade trying to re-establish trumpeter swans in Ontario. 
One good epidemic at one of those sheltering power plants, he said, and a 
sizable percentage of the trumpeter population worldwide would be lost. 
</P>
<P>
David Weaver, executive secretary of the Minnesota-based Trumpeter Swan 
Society, said: "The problem is such that we need to consider everything that 
comes along, no matter how ludicrous it may sound." 
</P>
<P>
Mother Nature, meet Father Goose. 
</P>
<P>
On warm summer days, 51-year-old Bill Lishman can be seen in the skies of 
southern Ontario, skimming over cornfields and pasturelands with a perfect 
chevron of gray and black Canada geese honking along behind him. Lishman has 
trained the geese to fly in formation with his homemade ultralight aircraft, 
after three arduous years of trial and error, busted wings and broken feet. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the help of Canadian naturalist Bill Carrick, Lishman hopes to take 
trumpeter swans to the air lanes. If the two men succeed in training the 
trumpeters to fly with the ultralight, they will then guide the rare birds back 
to their wintering places on Chesapeake Bay, re-establishing the migration of 
old. 
</P>
<P>
"The theory is extremely sound," said William Sladen, professor emeritus of 
immunology and infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins University and an authority 
on swans and their migratory habits. "We believe the ultralight is the answer." 
</P>
<P>
On 100 acres of fallow pastureland and pine groves here, northeast of Toronto, 
Lishman has for three years been keeping gaggles of goslings in pens by the 
side of a grassy airstrip. By day, in early summer, Lishman jogs up and down 
the runway with his fluffy goslings in hot pursuit. Lishman swings a tape 
recorder on a strap as he runs, blaring the sound of an ultralight engine at 
full throttle. By night, Lishman beds the goslings down under the wing of his 
parked ultralight. His neighbors call him Father Goose. 
</P>
<P>
"Geese need a lot of mothering," Lishman explained. "The more attention you pay 
to them, the more they'll stick with you. You can't just spend five minutes 
with them in the morning and five minutes at night." 
</P>
<P>
By running with the baby geese at least three times a day, every day, he says, 
he accustoms them to the engine's roar, and to his strange, human form. 
</P>
<P>
Lishman is motivated, he says, by a dream he has had since childhood of flying 
with the birds. He was born in 1939 to a biologist mother and a 
fighter-pilot-trainer father, who raised him on a steady diet of 
daring-young-man stories featuring the pilots of Spitfires and Hawker 
Hurricanes in wartime Europe. 
</P>
<P>
When peace came, the Lishman family settled down on a farm. Young Bill would 
spend hours watching the seagulls that trailed after his father's plow, 
daydreaming about fighter planes. As soon as he was old enough, Lishman 
enrolled in the Canadian Air Cadets, but it turned out he was colorblind, and a 
medical panel declared him ineligible to fly. Lishman grew up to become a 
successful sculptor, but he never abandoned his dream of flying with the birds. 
When the first crude hang gliders emerged, in the early 1970s, he bought one, 
added an engine, and began experimenting on a hill behind his house. 
</P>
<P>
While all this was going on in Blackstock, Carrick -- himself a World War II 
pilot -- had begun making nature movies. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy animals and being outdoors, and I could never figure out why nobody 
else does," he said, slogging from pond to pond during an interview on a 
marshy, nine-acre nature preserve he keeps just outside of Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, Carrick got a contract to provide the animals for a film about "Gray 
Owl," a British naturalist who lived with Indians in the Canadian wild and 
wrote vividly about the antics of beavers. Carrick introduced half a dozen 
beavers to his preserve and, for realism's sake, threw in assorted waterfowl. 
He even built a wind tunnel for the birds to fly in on camera, and he set about 
"imprinting" the ducks, geese and beavers that would star in the film. 
</P>
<P>
"Imprinting" is a technique developed by Konrad Lorenz, the Nobel Prize-winning 
Austrian pioneer of ethology, the study of animal behavior. Lorenz, who kept a 
houseful of fish, fowl and wild animals, observed that baby birds instinctively 
followed the first large creature that moved away from them after they hatched. 
The hatchlings formed a parental bond with that creature, he wrote, 
"imprinting" themselves upon it. 
</P>
<P>
Carrick, an admirer of Lorenz, adopted the Austrian's technique to get his 
geese up and flying in the wind tunnel. His children amused themselves by 
training the imprinted geese to fly behind their bicycles. One goose even took 
to flying behind a friend's car, Carrick says. A local newspaper told of these 
goings-on, and the wishful Lishman read of them excitedly. 
</P>
<P>
"He called me up," Carrick recalled. "He said he'd been flying for years and 
years. He asked me if geese would follow an airplane. I said, 'No reason why 
not.' " 
</P>
<P>
Soon, the two men had formed a loose partnership. 
</P>
<P>
The first summer, Lishman imprinted a dozen geese to fly behind his motorcycle, 
assuming they would make an easy transition to the ultralight. He assumed 
incorrectly: In one early experiment, a goose hit the ultralight's propeller, 
breaking the prop and splintering the bird's wing. The next spring, Lishman 
started over with a fresh batch of goslings, and a redesigned, goose-friendly 
aircraft. But this time, on the maiden flight, a carburetor valve stuck, the 
engine stalled, and Lishman tumbled into a ditch and broke his foot. He spent 
six weeks in a cast. 
</P>
<P>
The third year, Lishman designed and built yet another ultralight and imprinted 
yet another gaggle of goslings. Each day, he said, he hauled himself out of bed 
before sunrise, fed the geese, ran with them and played the sound of the 
ultralight engine for them. He would taxi up and down the airstrip, the birds 
flapping along behind. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, one day, he decided the birds were ready to fly. He taxied down the 
airstrip, revved the engine a few times to attract the geese's attention and 
opened the throttle as they burst out of the gate. Lishman pulled up, executed 
a 90-degree turn and looked back to see the geese far below, flapping madly in 
an effort to catch up. He eased back to 20 m.p.h., just above stalling speed, 
and the geese came up alongside, forming a ragged chevron off his wing. 
</P>
<P>
Below, on the ground, his wife and children cheered. A friend filmed the scene 
with a video camera, making what was to be an award-winning documentary that 
will be shown at the National Educational Film and Video Festival, in San 
Francisco, on May 26. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, back at his preserve, Carrick was spinning more ideas. A member of 
the Trumpeter Swan Society, he knew the difficulties swan lovers were having in 
restoring trumpeters to their native habitat. As the trumpeter swan had died 
out, it had been replaced with mute swans imported from Europe, "the ones you 
see in parks and on toilet paper," Carrick sniffed. 
</P>
<P>
To the uninitiate, mute swans may make a lovely sight, but North American bird 
lovers consider them an unacceptable substitute for the trumpeters. Mute swans, 
by definition, lack the trumpeter's sonorous call; they hiss a lot. They are 
also aggressive, known to catch goslings and ducklings and make a meal of them. 
</P>
<P>
Ontario, and some American states, have been running discreet programs to 
dethrone the mute swan and bring back the trumpeter. They send field workers to 
find mute swan nests, take out the eggs, shake them to kill the embryos, and 
return them, along with a few trumpeter eggs, to the nests. The idea is to make 
the mute swans unwitting foster parents to the baby trumpeters. 
</P>
<P>
This gambit doesn't always work. Trumpeter eggs, for one thing, cost $200 
apiece, and they don't always hatch. Then, the white hatchling trumpeters have 
to be caught by biologists and dyed the dusky color of mute cygnets, so the 
"parents" don't reject them. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, if the trumpeters are lucky enough to reach maturity, there is no one 
to teach them the old migration routes. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing all this, Carrick got to thinking that as long as Lishman had trained 
geese to fly with his aircraft, he might just as well train trumpeter swans and 
guide them to safe wintering grounds. When he told Lishman his plan, the 
sculptor was inspired. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Lishman is building a new ultralight that will take off and land on 
floats, since swans, unlike geese, must take off from water. Carrick began 
working out with trumpeter cygnets and a motorboat last year. Sladen, the Johns 
Hopkins swan man, is looking for financial backing and has found a safe 
wintering spot for the first batch of birds, on the grounds of a conference 
center near Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Lishman plans to make a dry run with Carrick's dime-a-dozen geese later this 
summer, and if all goes well, he, Carrick, and a ground crew will embark with 
the precious swans in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be very careful," Lishman said. "With trumpeters, it's a whole 
different ball game. Trumpeters fly much later in the year, so late in the 
season that we might not get the weather (we need). You can't fly ultralights 
in rough weather. 
</P>
<P>
"And when the trumpeters first learn to fly, they're much more awkward than 
geese. You could have a mid-air with one of them very easily." 
</P>
<P>
But Lishman noted that it should take only one successful trip with the 
ultralight to show the birds the way south. After that, the swans will be on 
their own, and he can return to full-time sculpting. 
</P>
<P>
Lovers of the trumpeter swan might argue that Lishman's airborne exertions as 
the man who teaches birds to fly are themselves art of a high order. 
</P>
<P>
"Surely the best art is always functional," says Lumsden, the trumpeter swan 
restoration expert.

HAWTHORNE SETTLES VAGOS POLICE SUIT FOR $2 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARITA HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In one of the largest settlements of its type in California, the city of 
Hawthorne agreed Thursday to pay nearly $2 million to resolve a lawsuit in 
which members of the Vagos motorcycle club and others claimed they were targets 
of massive police abuse in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement, which involved 70 plaintiffs who claimed their rights had been 
violated by the Hawthorne Police Department, brought an end to a civil trial 
that had been under way for more than three months in Los Angeles County 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the Vagos said the settlement was a vindication of their clients' 
claims that Hawthorne police officers had engaged in a campaign of harassment 
against the bikers. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody expected a motorcycle club to achieve this kind of 
victory," said Paul Hoffman of the American Civil Liberties Union, the lead 
attorney in the case. "But we demonstrated that when anyone's rights are 
violated, you can get full vindication in our system." 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman added that the hefty settlement should send a clear message to the 
Hawthorne Police Department to change its "abusive" tactics which, he argued 
during the trial, extended beyond the Vagos to other minority groups in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the city had no comment on the settlement. Specifically 
named as defendants in the suit were former Hawthorne Police Chief Kenneth R. 
Stonebraker, three of his lieutenants and a sergeant. Numerous unnamed officers 
who participated in the searches also were listed as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
After attorney fees are paid, about $1.5 million of the money will be divided 
among the plaintiffs. Some of the money is meant to compensate them for damage 
to their homes sustained during police raids seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesseses testified during the trial that police broke down doors, ransacked 
drawers and confiscated motorcycles and cars during searches of members' homes, 
and even searches of neighbors' homes. 
</P>
<P>
But the property damage was relatively minor, attorneys said, compared to the 
violation of the plaintiffs' civil rights. Witnesses said that during the raids 
police pointed guns at the heads of children, used obscene language against 
women, used unnecessary force and made false arrests. 
</P>
<P>
"The money doesn't matter," said plaintiff Lenard Barela, 42, after the 
settlement agreement hearing. "All we wanted was for (police) to get the 
message that we're people too and the law applies to everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Barela said that members of the Vagos, formed in the 1960s to fight off the 
outlaw Hells Angels, have almost grown used to harassment from police. "It's 
part of the game and they have a job to do," he said. "But when they terrorize 
my kids, they're pushing too far. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they launched the 1983 raids in a manhunt for a club member 
suspected of stabbing three men in a bar fight. The plaintiff's lawyers, 
however, argued that the homes were raided merely to harass the families in a 
ploy to pressure the suspect to give himself up. 
</P>
<P>
Club members charged that the raids were part of a pattern of harassment 
against them that had lasted for years. Members were often stopped by police on 
any excuse, including "wearing green" in the city, said Barela. The club's 
emblem, which members wear on the backs of their sleeveless jackets, is green. 
</P>
<P>
More than 80 witnesses were called during the trial before Judge Maurice Hogan 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
But it was a former Hawthorne police officer who provided some of the key 
testimony for the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Griffith, who now lives in Texas, testified that his colleagues made 
unwarranted arrests, wrote false crime reports and roughed up suspects, all 
with their superiors' approval. Griffith said that officers routinely referred 
to incidents involving blacks, Latinos, motorcycle gangs or poor whites as 
"N.H.I." or "no human involvement." 
</P>
<P>
ACLU attorneys argued that the alleged harassment campaign against the 
motorcycle club and other groups was a result of an overzealous get-tough 
stance by city and police officials. 
</P>
<P>
"The best way to change the city's policy is to impose substantial damages," 
Hoffman said after the settlement agreement. "This will cause the Police 
Department to change as rapidly as anything anybody can do." 
</P>
<P>
Griffith, however, was not optimistic. The disgruntled former officer said he 
has been unable to get another job in law enforcement. He contends that 
Hawthorne police smeared his reputation by claiming he was the subject of a 
murder investigation, although no charges have ever been filed. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith predicted that Hawthorne police officers would escalate their 
harassment of the Vagos because of the court settlement.

PRAISE FOR SAMMY DAVIS JR. IS EXTRAVAGANT IN THE CITY WHERE HE ADORNED MARQUEES

Claude Trenier could not contain himself. Even before the gold lame curtain 
lifted over the stage of the Sinbad Lounge in the Aladdin Casino, the 
70-year-old entertainer delivered the announcement that almost every act in 
town would make before the long desert night ended. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to dedicate this show," he barked, "to a great showman who will 
surely be missed!" 
</P>
<P>
It was the night that Sammy Davis Jr. died, and Las Vegas, an outsized place 
where gambling halls are transformed into castles and praise swells into 
adoration, was awash in an effervescence of tribute. In darkened lounges and 
club rooms up and down the Strip, the luckless and the eternal optimists of 
this gambling capital paid fealty to "Mr. Entertainment," each in his or her 
own grandiose fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Middle-aged gamblers who once envied Davis and his Rat Pack pals as the 
embodiments of eternal finger-snapping nonchalance paused to mull their 
generation's approaching mortality. Chorus-line dancers and hotel maids grew 
teary-eyed, recalling Davis' words of encouragement -- and the cases of Dom 
Perignon he sometimes sent to chase the words down. Even inside the drab office 
corridors hidden away from the neon-lit caverns of slot machines, casino 
officials turned away -- however briefly -- from their counting books to voice 
their respects. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, man, it's worth it," explained Claude Trenier as he took the stage. 
"We're talking about Sammy." 
</P>
<P>
When the curtain lifted, Trenier was not quite the dynamo of four decades ago 
on what he described as the chitlin circuit. In his prime, he and his four 
brothers would turn hardwood stages into trampolines with their frenetic 
song-and-dance act. 
</P>
<P>
But as Trenier -- who said he knew Davis well -- negotiated his creaky 
soft-shoe routine, he and his group honored the entertainer the way any 
seasoned lounge act would honor a fallen star. They honored him often. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost one of our great friends today!" he reminded his audience as the 
Treniers worked their way through the "Sheik of Araby." 
</P>
<P>
"We lost a dear friend today," he noted before performing "Hava Nagila." 
</P>
<P>
And on it went as they sang and danced and paid homage through a collection of 
the sort of standards that Davis did so well. 
</P>
<P>
The part of this town that was Davis' struts its stuff at night, and during the 
day of his death the tributes were somewhat muted. Casino marquees bore no 
mention of his passing, frozen in their usual promotions of performing 
chimpanzees and army-sized chorus lines. 
</P>
<P>
As night approached, however, the casino chieftains collectively declared a 
tribute that only Las Vegas could announce -- plans to darken all the marquees 
for 10 minutes tonight, the first time that the massive neon billboards will 
dim since the death of President John F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
At Bally's, orders went out to move a framed portrait of Davis from its honored 
place in the hotel-casino's Celebrity Room -- where it hangs with photographs 
of Rat Pack buddies Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and other stars who have played 
the showroom -- to a prominent place at the casino's front entrance. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember to get some flowers with it," hotel publicist Tom Bruny told an 
assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Nelson Bell, 46, a titian-haired piano player, did her part to make sure 
casino visitors knew just whose day it was. Seated serenely at an ebony piano, 
Bell played Davis' most popular hits, reproducing "Candyman" and "Mr. 
Bojangles" in endless rippling glissandos. 
</P>
<P>
After playing a medley requested by a Davis fan, Bell said she had "tried to 
make it as exquisitely tender as I could. Each of us ought to thank that man 
for the joy he brought to this city. We all knew he was ill, but I kept 
thinking that somehow, he'd go on forever." 
</P>
<P>
In the casino's penthouse, 26 floors up, hotel maid Maria Sudbury, 62, 
repeatedly removed a crumpled slip of paper from her apron pocket, read it and 
stuffed it away. 
</P>
<P>
Sudbury, a Belgian native who has worked nearly 20 years as head maid in the 
penthouse, asked a "lady on the switchboard" to help her write a short message 
that she wanted to wire to Davis' widow, Altavoise. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Davis, he was my baby," Sudbury said, shaking her frosted head of hair 
sadly as she took a break in a newly cleaned suite. Next door in the 
"Ziegfield," a penthouse suite that was always held open for Davis, hotel 
parking attendants were being fitted for new uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
Sudbury joined them, poking her way past racks of gray and scarlet uniforms to 
point out where the entertainer's favorite furniture could no longer be found. 
</P>
<P>
"He was so neat and so clean," she said. "A fine gentleman Mr. Davis was." 
</P>
<P>
She examined the carefully printed note one more time. "Dear Mrs. Davis," it 
said. "My deepest sympathy. I am so sorry that Mr. Davis passed away. I hope I 
see you one day." 
</P>
<P>
It was signed, "Maria on the 26th floor."

28,000 JOBS MAY HANG ON RULING ON OWLS

In casual remarks that could portend serious economic trouble for parts of the 
Pacific Northwest, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan told federal workers 
Thursday that he expects the northern spotted owl to be added to the endangered 
species list next month. 
</P>
<P>
If that decision is formally reached by scientists studying the rare bird -- 
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service insisted that no decision has been made -- a 
U.S. Forest Service study has predicted it could jeopardize as many as 28,000 
jobs in Oregon, California and Washington, the country's three biggest timber 
states. 
</P>
<P>
The potential economic fallout from logging limits in the timber-dependent 
region where the owl is found has made the medium-size, mottled-brown bird the 
subject of the most intense political battle in the history of the Endangered 
Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
The law was passed in 1973 to protect plants and animals from the rapidly 
increasing threat of extinction in the face of human development. 
</P>
<P>
A formal decision on whether to add the owl subspecies to the list of birds 
threatened with extinction -- and thus force the government to limit old-growth 
logging and other activities to protect the bird and its habitat -- is expected 
by the Fish and Wildlife Service by June 23. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan sparked a small furor last week when he told people in Denver that the 
spotted owl case should prompt Congress to modify the law to prevent it from 
interfering with substantial exploitation of natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists said Lujan's idea would essentially gut the law just as the 
dramatic recoveries of the bald eagle and other once-endangered species are 
beginning to demonstrate its true effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, in informal remarks to about 100 regional department employees in 
Boston, Lujan said, "On June the 23rd, that owl is going to be declared 
endangered. When that happens, a lot of this timbering will have to shut down." 
</P>
<P>
The act prohibits consideration of economic impact when deciding whether to 
protect an animal, but does allow consideration of such impacts while deciding 
how best to protect endangered species from extinction. 
</P>
<P>
The small owls, which live primarily in old-growth forests in the Pacific 
Northwest, reproduce well only in the older trees, scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
A recent Forest Service economic analysis predicted that setting aside 8 
million acres to protect the owl could result in the loss of 28,000 jobs in the 
logging, lumber and paper industries by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Forest Service, there are 949 known owl pairs in Northern 
California, Oregon, and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Fish and Wildlife Service officials in Portland, Ore., said Lujan's remarks 
were premature. 
</P>
<P>
"No decision has been made . . . on listing or not listing. We haven't reached 
a conclusion yet," said spokesman Dave Klinger. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the service refused to list the owl, but environmentalists claimed in 
court that the decision was motivated by politics, not science. A federal judge 
in Seattle ultimately found deficiencies in the first study and ordered another 
review, which began last summer and will end next month. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan, in Boston, pledged to carry out the law in protecting the owl. 
</P>
<P>
"The law says I cannot interfere with the listing of this owl, and I'm not 
going to," he said. "I don't want to interfere because biology is the only 
thing that matters as far as listing that owl. If they're endangered, they're 
endangered."

Floodwaters gushed from a rain-swollen lake into the Trinity River in Texas at 
a record rate Thursday, but despite warnings to evacuate many residents 
downstream stayed home to guard against looters, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Floodwaters from Lake Livingston, about 75 miles northeast of Houston, are 
expected to inundate more than 200 square miles along the Trinity. 
</P>
<P>
At the dam, operators increased the flow through a dozen floodgates to a record 
100,800 cubic feet per second by midday Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-three counties in Texas have been declared eligible for disaster aid. 
</P>
<P>
In Oklahoma, Gov. Henry Bellmon dispatched the National Guard to help get feed 
to stranded cattle. Floods along the Red and Arkansas rivers have prompted 
Bellmon to request disaster aid for 36 of the state's 77 counties. 
</P>
<P>
In Missouri, Gov. John Ashcroft declared Jackson County, which includes Kansas 
City, a disaster area and promised to seek federal assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in St. Louis, meanwhile, prepared for floods from the Mississippi 
River expected to hit by Saturday. City workers began piling up sandbags and 
setting up floodgates near the city's trademark arch along the Mississippi as 
the river continued rising. 
</P>
<P>
The Mississippi was 29 feet deep Thursday, and was expected to crest at 34 feet 
Saturday, 4 feet above flood stage. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't expect any damage at all. There will be a lot of mud and it won't be 
pretty, but nothing should be hurt," said Jim Suelman, director of St. Louis' 
street department. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri's other major river, the Missouri, was already 10 feet above its 
21-foot flood stage Thursday at Hermann, where the river was at 31.7 feet. It 
was expected to crest at 33.5 feet today. 
</P>
<P>
In northwestern Louisiana, about 200 square miles, most of it sparsely settled 
farmland, was under water from the Red River and backwaters. 
</P>
<P>
In southern Mississippi, about 34 people spent Wednesday night at a shelter set 
up at an elementary school in Beaumont, said Red Cross volunteer Clay Keys. 
Evacuees said water in homes was four to five feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the flooding, tornadoes continued to plague the nation's midsection. 
</P>
<P>
One woman was killed and her husband injured when their home in McDougal in 
northeastern Arkansas collapsed in a tornado Wednesday night. At least two 
other people were injured and about a dozen homes were destroyed. High winds 
were accompanied by driving rain and flash floods in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
At least one death was reported in Folsomville, Ind., as the storm moved east. 
A 61-year-old woman died of head injuries when a tree toppled by 50-m.p.h. 
winds fell onto a mobile home.

RENOIR WORK SELLS FOR $78.1 MILLION; 
</P>
<P>
AUCTION: THE PAINTING 'AU MOULIN DE LA GALETTE' IS HIGHLIGHT OF SOTHEBY'S 
OFFERING OF IMPRESSIONIST AND MODERN ART. THE PRICE IS THE SECOND HIGHEST EVER.

<P>
"Au Moulin de la Galette," an Impressionist dance hall scene by Pierre Auguste 
Renoir, was purchased at auction Thursday night for $78.1 million by an 
anonymous telephone bidder. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of the Renoir painting at Sotheby's occurred 49 hours too late to 
establish a world auction record. It was upstaged by Tuesday night's 
$82.5-million sale at Christie's of Vincent van Gogh's "Portrait of Dr. Gachet" 
to the Kobayashi Gallery of Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the paintings had been valued at $40 million to $50 million, leading to 
speculation about whether either would top the $53.9-million auction record set 
in 1987 for Van Gogh's "Irises." But Van Gogh's "Dr. Gachet" is now the world's 
most expensive artwork on public record, the Renoir is second and "Irises," now 
owned by the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, is third. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we'd like the price of the Renoir to be a few million dollars more 
but $78.1 million is a wonderful price," auctioneer John L. Marion said after 
the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Bidding began at $25 million and rose in increments of $1 million, with most of 
the competition -- including the final bid -- taking place by telephone. 
Sotheby's declined to disclose any information about the buyer's identity. 
</P>
<P>
The mystery buyer purchased a painting of a happy crowd enjoying a summer day 
at an outdoor dance hall in the Montmartre section of Paris. Renoir painted the 
convivial scene in 1876 at Moulin de la Galette, a gathering place for working 
class families. His models were milliners, dressmakers and floral shop 
attendants who frequented the dance hall. 
</P>
<P>
The Impressionist painting was sold by Betsey Cushing Whitney, a New York 
philanthropist who has donated much of her collection to museums. Her late 
husband, John Hay Whitney, a financier and former publisher of the now-defunct 
New York Herald Tribune, bought the painting for $165,000 in 1929. 
</P>
<P>
The Renoir sale, which easily broke the artist's record of $17.7 million, was 
the highlight of the auction that totaled $286 million in sales, a record for 
an Impressionist and modern art auction. 
</P>
<P>
Sotheby's had estimated that the sale of 70 works would total between $216 
million and $289 million. Although 12 relatively low-priced lots failed to 
sell, a dozen pricier works exceeded their high estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Sotheby's sale Wednesday night of the Lydia Winston Malbin 
collection of modern art, which totaled $75 million and lived up to the auction 
house's most optimistic predictions, Thursday night's sale seemed to allay 
fears that the Impressionist and modern art market was headed for as strong a 
correction as contemporary art experienced in last week's auctions. 
</P>
<P>
Three works put on the block by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York 
brought considerably higher prices than predicted. Ernst Beyeler, a dealer from 
Basel, Switzerland, bought Wassily Kandinsky's "Fugue" for $20.9 million, well 
above its estimate of $10 million to $15 million. An unidentified Japanese 
dealer paid $14.85 million for Marc Chagall's fanciful painting, "Anniversary," 
which had been valued at $6 million to $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
The third Guggenheim sale, "Boy in a Blue Vest" by Amedeo Modigliani, also 
valued at $6 million to $8 million, was purchased for $11.55 million by New 
York dealer Klaus Perls. In a move that has been criticized by art critics, the 
Guggenheim decided to sell these three prime works to buy a collection of 
Minimalist sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
Remarking on the high prices of the Guggenheim consignments, Marion said: "When 
you have things of unusual quality on the market, they bring unusual prices." 
</P>
<P>
The Kandinsky and Chagall works set records for the artists, as did a group of 
six bronze models for Auguste Rodin's "Burghers of Calais" ($4.3 million), 
Ernst Kirchner's Expressionist painting, "Drahtseiltanz" ($1.65 million) and 
Liubov Popova's "Cubist Cityscape" ($1.76 million). 
</P>
<P>
A Renoir still life and a landscape failed to attract buyers but the artist's 
painting, "Young Girl With Cat," was purchased anonymously for $18.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
This week's series of Impressionist and modern art auctions ends today with 
Sotheby's sale of less expensive paintings, sculpture, drawings and 
watercolors.

N.J. LAWMAKERS APPROVE NATION'S TOUGHEST BAN ON ASSAULT WEAPONS 
</P>

<P>
The New Jersey Legislature approved the nation's toughest ban on assault 
weapons Thursday night, including a provision that would require most people 
who legally bought the weapons to give them up. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, pushed hard by Democratic Gov. James J. Florio, cleared both 
houses of the Democratic-controlled Legislature despite aggressive lobbying led 
by the National Rifle Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The new law would allow collectors to keep their weapons if they remove the 
firing pins. It also would exempt target shooters who can prove they use the 
guns in organized competitions. 
</P>
<P>
The exemptions would cover about 20% of the 300,000 to 600,000 assault weapons 
believed to be in the state, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Florio hailed the law's passage, saying: "These are weapons of war designed to 
kill as many people as possible in the least amount of time. They have no place 
on our streets, where too often our police find themselves outgunned." 
</P>
<P>
But a leading opponent, Democratic state Sen. Raymond Zane, called the measure 
"absolutely absurd," saying: "The bill is just directed at the wrong people. 
These people are law-abiding citizens. Some of them are clergy, lawyers, 
doctors, schoolteachers." 
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, residents who own assault rifles and are not in an exempted 
category would be given one year to sell them out of state. Manufacture, sale 
or possession of the 38 kinds of assault weapons listed in the bill would be 
punishable by three to five years in prison and fines of up to $7,500.

POLHILL'S CANCEROUS LARYNX IS REMOVED

Surgeons removed the voice box of former hostage Robert Polhill on Thursday in 
what doctors called a successful operation to rid his body of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"He's in intensive care after undergoing surgery," Walter Reed Army Medical 
Center spokesman Ben Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
"His condition's good. 
</P>
<P>
Smith quoted doctors as saying the cancer had not spread beyond Polhill's 
larynx, or voice box. 
</P>
<P>
Polhill, 55, was freed April 22 after more than three years in captivity in 
Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Army Dr. Russ Zajtchuk said Wednesday that Polhill, a smoker, will not be able 
to speak normally after the operation but he will be able to communicate, 
perhaps with an electronic larynx. 
</P>
<P>
Polhill, whose voice was faint and raspy in the days following his release, 
also will receive radiation treatment after his recuperation.

President Bush, preparing for the U.S.-Soviet summit in two weeks, told West 
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Thursday he would insist that a unified 
Germany must be allowed to choose its own security alliances. 
</P>
<P>
Washington and Moscow have been at odds about whether a united Germany should 
be a full participating member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
</P>
<P>
"Forty-five years after the end of the war there is no reason that a unified, 
democratic Germany should be in any way singled out for some special status," 
Bush said after more than three hours of talks with Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
"Germany should be fully sovereign, free to chose its own alliances and 
security arrangements," Bush declared. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl, before departing to return to Bonn, where finance ministers of East and 
West Germany today will sign a treaty on currency and economic union, said: "A 
united Germany will remain a member of the North Atlantic alliance." 
</P>
<P>
He said the changes in Eastern Europe, however, required that NATO put more 
emphasis on political rather than military needs. 
</P>
<P>
Bush intends to discuss the German issue during his May 30-June 3 summit with 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, hoping to soften the Kremlin's 
opposition to allowing a unified Germany to be part of NATO. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union has said that the security status of a united Germany could be 
settled after unification. West Germany, backed by the Western allies, has 
insisted that all questions related to German sovereignty be resolved before 
union. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything's going very well," Kohl told reporters while posing for pictures 
with Bush at the start of their meeting in the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl declined to predict whether East and West Germany would be able to unite 
before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing's been speeded up. It's just normalcy," Kohl said of unification 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Bonn, West German officials disclosed the extent of East 
Germany's debts, predicting that the country's budget deficit would reach $20 
billion in the second half of 1990 and $32 billion next year. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he and Kohl agreed that the rights of the four World War II victors 
-- the United States, the Soviet Union, France and Britain -- should be 
terminated at the time of German reunification. 
</P>
<P>
"A united Germany should have full control over all of its territory without 
any new, discriminatory constraints on German sovereignty," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
In remarks on the South Lawn of the White House, Bush said he and Kohl agreed 
that U.S. forces should "remain stationed in the united Germany and elsewhere 
in Europe to continue to promote stability and security." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Kohl called for all-German elections soon. The move to elections by 
December or January is seen as a way to take advantage of the current 
popularity in East Germany of his Christian Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
German unification takes its first official step forward today when East and 
West German officials sign a treaty making the Western mark the currency for 
all Germans starting July 1. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure of East Germany's debt by West German Finance Minister Theo 
Waigel came after officials put the finishing touches on the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
Waigel had spent weeks trying to pry out of East Berlin exact figures on the 
state of East Germany's finances. 
</P>

CHINA PROTESTS U.S. CRITICISM OF ITS HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD

China issued a strong protest Thursday against criticism by President Bush of 
its human rights record, saying it is resentful and has made its views known to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Beijing also accused the human rights group Amnesty International of 
interfering in its internal affairs by publishing a report condemning China for 
secret executions, torture and unfair trials. 
</P>
<P>
"We have all along been opposed to interfering in China's internal affairs, 
smearing and attacking the Chinese government by the U.S. Congress under the 
pretext of freedom and human rights," Li Jinhua, spokeswoman for the Foreign 
Ministry, said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now the U.S. government has gone so far as to issue the public announcement at 
the request of Congress," she said. "We are extremely resentful of this and 
hereby express our strong protest." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, who had taken controversial steps to preserve ties with China 
since last June's bloody crackdown, last week sharply criticized Beijing's use 
of deadly force to suppress a campaign for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Signing a proclamation making May 13 a national day in support of human rights, 
he said the force used on protesters "went far beyond the legitimate 
requirements of law and order." 
</P>
<P>
Washington says China has made only minimal improvements in human rights since 
suppressing the democracy movement, and some members of Congress are calling on 
Bush to end most-favored-nation status for Chinese imports. 
</P>
<P>
China announced last week that it had released 211 people detained in 
connection with the demonstrations. It said 431 were still under investigation. 
Analysts believe thousands are still held. 
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Communist Party, said in an interview 
with ABC's Barbara Walters that 42 university and college students are among 
those still held. 
</P>
<P>
In the interview, to be shown tonight on ABC's "20/20" program, Jiang said it 
might have been possible to avert the army crackdown last June if Beijing had 
adopted "resolute measures," such as barring gatherings in Tian An Men Square, 
when the demonstrations began. He said authorities had learned from "our 
mistakes" and now have made "adequate preparations in terms of strengthening 
the police force and storing of non-lethal weapons."

U.S. DROPS DRIVE TO BOOST NATO SPENDING; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: FEW MEMBERS CAN MEET THE REQUIRED 3% INCREASE. THE MOVE IS INTENDED 
TO EASE TENSIONS.

<P>
In a move reflecting the profound political and military changes in Europe, the 
United States announced Thursday that it is dropping its longstanding demand 
that its North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies increase their defense 
spending by 3% a year after accounting for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The policy change is designed to reduce friction in the alliance over spending 
targets that few countries have met and to respond to a substantially 
diminished threat of war from the Soviet Union and its former Warsaw Pact 
allies. 
</P>
<P>
The shift in the 13-year-old policy is expected to be ratified by the NATO 
defense ministers at a previously scheduled meeting in Brussels next week. The 
ministers also plan to set force goals for the coming year and to begin 
redrawing the military map of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the changes in European security requirements, we are no longer asking 
our allies to increase their defense budgets by 3%," the Pentagon's written 
statement declared. "We are asking (that) they contribute to the military force 
structure required by the NATO military command." 
</P>
<P>
An Administration official added: "It's part of the President's call for a new 
strategy in response to the transformation in Eastern Europe, a reflection of 
changed events." 
</P>
<P>
The allies' consistent failure to meet the 3% growth target has sparked regular 
and sometimes rancorous debate on Capitol Hill, with lawmakers charging that 
generous U.S. defense spending has subsidized the Europeans' network of social 
services. The United States spends twice as much on military hardware and 
manpower as all the European NATO members combined. 
</P>
<P>
None of the 14 members of NATO's military structure has consistently met the 3% 
inflation-adjusted target. Even the U.S. military budget has been declining in 
inflation-adjusted terms since 1985 by an average of nearly 3% annually. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just a formal recognition of the realities in terms of the threat we 
face -- the prospect of war in Europe is minimal and shrinking steadily," said 
Barry Blechman, a Washington defense analyst. "And it's a recognition of fiscal 
realities -- we're facing extraordinary fiscal problems and the budget is 
definitely coming down." 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has projected an average inflation-adjusted 
decline of 2% annually in U.S. defense spending through the mid-1990s, but many 
in Congress and the Administration expect the Pentagon budget to fall more. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is we haven't met the percent goal for several years ourselves," said 
a senior Pentagon official who requested anonymity. "It's inherent in the 
budget we sent up to the Hill earlier this year that we won't meet 3%. We're 
talking about a 2.6% real decline." 
</P>
<P>
The official said that "it would be hypocritical for us to present such a 
budget and still hold to a position" requiring the allies to increase spending 
by 3% annually. 
</P>
<P>
According to a Pentagon study released last month, only six NATO nations -- 
Denmark, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal and Turkey -- met the 3% target in 
1988. Two members, France and Iceland, are not part of the alliance's military 
structure. The other allies are Belgium, Britain, Canada, the Netherlands, 
Norway, Spain and West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon report also revealed that only four NATO nations -- Canada, 
Luxembourg, Norway and Spain -- met the 3% goal on average from 1978 through 
1989. During those years, the U.S. defense budget grew by an average of 4.7% a 
year, including the massive military spending increases of the early years of 
the Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
On Capitol Hill, where the so-called "burden-sharing" debate has stirred the 
most controversy, the Pentagon shift was greeted with skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
"It lets the allies off the hook," said Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.), who 
has been a leading critic of what she considers the relatively small European 
contributions to alliance defense. "It deals with reality vis-a-vis the allies 
-- they are not ever in the near future going to increase their budgets by that 
much." 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder recently introduced a bill that would bring most Europe-based U.S. 
troops and their families back to bases on American soil and give them 
secondary assignments in Europe for exercises or permanent duty in the event of 
war. Under her proposal, the billions of dollars now spent to support the U.S. 
military structure in Europe would be spent in the United States instead. 
</P>
<P>
But for Administration policy-makers and NATO ministers, the debate over 
alliance "burden sharing" now seems settled. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of discussing how much each ally should pay for the defense of Europe 
and manpower and equipment matters, the military chiefs are likely to turn next 
week to larger questions of what needs to be defended, and against what threat, 
U.S. officials said Thursday.

WON'T TOLERATE BIAS NOR ACCEPT QUOTAS -- BUSH

President Bush said Thursday that he will not tolerate bias in hiring but also 
will not accept a civil rights bill that imposes quotas on employers. 
</P>
<P>
Sens. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and John C. Danforth (R-Mo.) quickly unveiled 
a compromise amendment intended to deal with his objections to the bill. 
</P>
<P>
But the White House and Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) said it failed to remove 
their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to sign a civil rights bill, but I will not sign a quota bill," Bush 
said at a ceremony honoring the recently revived U.S. Commission on Civil 
Rights. 
</P>
<P>
The President, who met three times this week with civil rights groups and 
lobbyists to search for a compromise on the legislation, said before Kennedy 
and Danforth announced their new proposal: "I think we can work it out." 
</P>
<P>
There is no mention of quotas -- the hiring of a certain number or percentage 
of minority or other workers -- in the bill. But Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh and 
other critics have said the earlier version's standard of proof for justifying 
exclusionary hiring practices was so tough that employers would use quotas as a 
way to avoid lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would undo a series of 1989 Supreme Court decisions that make 
it harder for workers to prove they were victims of job discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the House began action Thursday on a proposal to extend to the 
disabled -- including people with AIDS, blindness, cerebral palsy and a number 
of other mental and physical impairments -- the civil rights protections given 
racial minorities and women. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate passed the bill last September by a 76-8 vote, and the White House 
supports it. 
</P>
<P>
But the House approved an amendment Thursday that would allow food service 
workers with AIDS to be assigned duties to keep them from handling food. That 
may endanger passage since the White House had endorsed the bill's protection 
for AIDS patients.

SHRIMP BOATS KILL 44,000 TURTLES, SCIENTISTS SAY; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: A PANEL FINDS THE ANNUAL DROWNING OF THREATENED SEA ANIMALS TO BE 
FOUR TIMES OFFICIAL ESTIMATES. THE TOLL COULD BE CUT 97% WITH ESCAPE DOORS.

Shrimp boats working the United States' southern Atlantic coast and the Gulf of 
Mexico may have been killing as many as 44,000 threatened and endangered sea 
turtles each year -- four times the official government estimate -- a panel of 
the National Academy of Sciences reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The drownings, the panel concluded, theoretically could be reduced 97% by the 
full use of nets equipped with escape doors. That could make the shrimping 
industry compatible with protection of the huge turtles, whose numbers have 
dropped alarmingly. 
</P>
<P>
On the Mexican coast of the Gulf of Mexico, where 40,000 Kemp's ridley turtles 
were observed nesting on a single day in 1947, the population of nesting 
females now may be no more than 350, the panel said. Although populations of 
green and loggerhead turtles have stabilized in some areas of Florida, the 
number of loggerheads continues to decline on the beaches of Georgia and South 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
The academy study grew out of a furious debate over requiring shrimp nets to be 
equipped with turtle exclusion devices, or TEDs. Shrimpers, particularly in the 
Gulf of Mexico, bitterly argued that the trap door nets that allow the turtles 
to escape would cause them to lose 40% of their catch. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, supporters of the shrimpers requested the study, hoping that it 
would debunk the National Marine Fishery Service's estimate that 11,000 turtles 
are killed each year by the shrimpers. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists hailed the report's outcome Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"Opponents of the federal regulations have argued that sea turtles are not 
really endangered, that shrimpers do not kill many sea turtles, and that TEDs 
are not needed for sea turtle conservation," said Michael Bean, an attorney for 
the Environmental Defense Fund. "But the academy's study forcefully rejects all 
of these contentions. 
</P>
<P>
"The Commerce departments of the last two administrations, at least three 
federal courts, and now the National Academy of Sciences have sided with the 
turtles," he continued. "Now it is time for shrimpers in the northern Gulf to 
do what most shrimpers elsewhere have already done . . . : face up to the need 
to act responsibly to end the slaughter of sea turtles." 
</P>
<P>
Regulations requiring the use of turtle-safe nets were first issued in 1987, 
and a fishermen's organization called Concerned Shrimpers of America went to 
court in an unsuccessful effort to block implementation. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher set aside the net 
regulation and proposed to protect turtles by requiring trawlers to pull up 
their nets every 105 minutes to allow entrapped turtles to escape before they 
drown. He was taken to court by the National Wildlife Federation, and a federal 
judge in Houston -- calling his action a "total abrogation of the regulations" 
-- ordered the safe net requirement enforced. 
</P>
<P>
With the regulation now in place, shrimp boat operators can be fined as much as 
$8,000 a day for operating without the safety nets, but no figures were 
available Thursday on arrests or fines. 
</P>
<P>
Academy panel member Charles H. Peterson of the University of North Carolina 
said the findings in the new study will support federal efforts to protect the 
endangered turtles. But they also indicate that nets equipped with the excluder 
devices are not effective under all circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
In rivers and coastal waters where heavy grass makes the safe nets ineffective, 
turtles can be protected by limiting the tow times to 40 minutes during the 
summer and 60 minutes during winter. 
</P>
<P>
In other areas, the report suggests that the requirements for turtle safe nets 
be expanded. At present, regulations do not require the use of TED-equipped 
nets along the Georgia and Carolina coasts beyond the end of August. But the 
panel said that turtles, including the severely endangered Kemp's ridley, 
remain in that area at that time of the year and are being killed. 
</P>
<P>
Although the panel said that shrimp nets are the chief threat to survival of 
endangered turtles, hundreds more are being killed by other fishing operations 
-- collisions with boats, dredging operations and the destruction of abandoned 
oil rigs. 
</P>
<P>
No estimate was made, but the panel said the 24,000 tons of plastic packaging 
dumped into the ocean each year pose an additional threat, especially to 
species that feed on jellyfish and confuse floating plastic for their favorite 
food. But for efforts of the Mexican government, Peterson said, the Kemp's 
ridley turtle might already face extinction. For the last 10 years, the 
Mexicans have carefully protected the nesting females and their hatchlings at 
Rancho Nuevo, the species' primary nesting beach. 
</P>
<P>
The area where their eggs are laid was seriously damaged when Hurricane Gilbert 
hit Mexico's Gulf Coast in the fall of 1988, leaving gravel and rubble where 
there had been sand, and further threatening their survival.

A VARIETY OF CHARGES ARE POSSIBLE IN KILLINGS; 
</P>

LESSER CRIME, SUCH AS MANSLAUGHTER.

In deciding what charges to file against Marlon Brando's son, prosecutors can 
choose from an array, ranging from first-degree murder to involuntary 
manslaughter, legal experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"They all begin as murder (charges) on homicide cases," said William Kunstler, 
the attorney retained to represent Christian Brando, who was arrested Thursday 
in the slaying of his half sister's Tahitian boyfriend. "This is clearly not 
going to end up as a murder case." 
</P>
<P>
Kunstler explained that the charges could be modified as the investigation 
continues. "At this point, it's a convenience for them (prosecutors) to charge 
him with murder," he said. "It's easier for a prosecutor to go down (in the 
hierarchy of charges) than go up. . . . If there was a struggle for the gun and 
the gun went off, for example, I don't know if there would be any liability at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
The attorney said that from the facts he has been able to gather so far, "it 
might be self-defense. . . . I understand there may have been a struggle over 
the gun, and some beating going on of Marlon's daughter." 
</P>
<P>
Kunstler also raised questions about whether the 32-year-old suspect's rights 
had been violated by police who questioned him without an attorney present. He 
also said there are questions about young Brando's mental condition at the time 
of the shooting. Police said the suspect may have been drinking. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the facts that emerge from the investigation, legal experts say, 
Christian Brando ultimately could face one of the following charges: 
</P>
<P>
* First-degree murder is the deliberate, premeditated killing of a person with 
malice, either express or implied. Or killing in the course of a robbery or 
other felony. Or killing by poison, lying in wait or torture. Criminals like 
the Hillside Strangler and Night Stalker fall within this category. The penalty 
is 25 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
If so-called special circumstances, such as murder for financial gain, apply, 
the penalty is death or life in prison without possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
* Second-degree murder, which carries a penalty of 15 years to life, is "your 
typical garden-variety-type murder" without premeditation, veteran Los Angeles 
County prosecutor Steven Kay said. For example, a jury found former gang leader 
Virgil Byars guilty last month of second-degree murder in a case involving two 
drive-by shootings. The prosecution had argued for a first-degree conviction; 
the defense had hoped for manslaughter if not acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
* Voluntary manslaughter is killing during a sudden quarrel or in the heat of 
passion. The classic example of this, Kay said, is the husband who finds his 
wife in bed with another man and kills them both. "But," noted Kay, "if he hid 
in the closet to surprise them, as happened in a recent case, that's not 
manslaughter." 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Supervisor Dan White was convicted of voluntary manslaughter in 
the 1978 killings of the mayor and another supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Voluntary manslaughter carries a sentence of three, six or 11 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
* Involuntary manslaughter, which carries a sentence of two, three or four 
years, is the inadvertent killing of a person during a dangerous activity. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes what begins as murder ends up as manslaughter. In the 1987 case of 
Ricky Kyle, for example, the defendant was charged with murder but found guilty 
by the jury of the reduced charge of involuntary manslaughter in the Bel-Air 
shooting death of his Texas tycoon father. Jurors said they believed that he 
fired the gun in self-defense, while he and his father were searching for a 
burglar. 
</P>
<P>
A homicide may be found justifiable if it is committed in self-defense or in 
defense of another person. Kunstler has suggested that this may be the tack he 
takes if Brando is charged. Arraignment is scheduled today. 
</P>
<P>
Kay and other prosecutors say celebrities or their kin are treated no 
differently from ordinary suspects. 
</P>
<P>
But defense attorneys say they are handled with extra care -- and often treated 
more severely than ordinary defendants. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty or 30 years ago, celebrities were treated more favorably," noted 
defense attorney Gerald Chaleff says. "But today, police and prosecutors appear 
to go more by the rules (with celebrities) than with someone not in the public 
eye."

Christian Brando has plied a few trades while living in the shadow and the 
gated, sumptuous home of his famous actor father. 
</P>
<P>
A high school dropout, he learned artistic welding, attempted to start a tree 
trimming service and tried his hand at acting. 
</P>
<P>
He prevailed at none. 
</P>
<P>
Even in marriage, Marlon Brando's oldest child, who turned 32 last week, was 
less than a success. 
</P>
<P>
Records show that when his ex-wife, Mary McKenna Brando, refused to sign 
divorce papers in 1986, Christian Brando "worked himself into a rage and said, 
'You better call the police or get out of the house because I'm going to kill 
you if it's the last thing I do. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
He had come home "many times and for no reason became enraged and started 
breaking furniture and throwing me across the room," McKenna Brando said in a 
signed declaration to the court. 
</P>
<P>
Once, in a particular moment of anger, he aimed a loaded rifle at his 
mother-in-law, divorce documents allege. 
</P>
<P>
Such was the man Los Angeles police arrested Thursday on suspicion of having 
shot to death the boyfriend of his pregnant half-sister, Cheyenne Brando, 20, 
after a heated argument Wednesday night in the den of their father's home. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of four traffic tickets since May, 1987, there is little to 
indicate that Christian Brando has ever before been in trouble with the law. 
</P>
<P>
While detectives and big-time defense attorneys scrambled to explain the 
shooting Thursday, Christian Brando's former sister-in-law depicted him as a 
"mellow, very unglamorous guy" who likes to scuba dive and collect guns, but 
"isn't the kind to carry guns around." 
</P>
<P>
Even his ex-wife found it hard to believe that he had been implicated in a 
slaying. 
</P>
<P>
"He is not a killer," Mary McKenna Brando said in a brief telephone interview. 
"There must have been a reason for it. He was very protective of his sister." 
</P>
<P>
McKenna Brando would not comment on claims she made during her divorce 
proceedings that Brando had threatened to harm her. 
</P>
<P>
Born May 11, 1958, to Marlon Brando's first wife, Calcutta-born actress Anna 
Kashfi, Christian was not yet out of diapers when his celebrity parents 
separated and divorced. The split was hardly amicable; his parents' fighting 
was regular and searing -- the stuff of gossip columns. 
</P>
<P>
Kashfi was awarded custody of her son. But five years later, a judge declared 
that her "reliance on drugs and alcohol" contributed to an uncontrollable 
temper often demonstrated in public, and the boy was removed. The court ordered 
that Christian, then 6, live with Marlon Brando's older sister. 
</P>
<P>
Marlon Brando had married twice more and had three more children by 1972, when 
the actor was awarded custody of Christian after a lengthy court hearing in 
Santa Monica. Brando enrolled him at the exclusive Ojai Valley School near 
Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
While Brando was filming "Last Tango in Paris," Kashfi allegedly kidnaped 
Christian and took him to a hippie camp in Baja California, where he was 
eventually found, living in a drafty tent and suffering from bronchitis. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, Kashfi sued to recover custody of the boy, claiming that Brando's 
performance in the sexually provocative "Last Tango in Paris" had caused 
Christian "ridicule and embarrassment." She dropped her lawsuit in 1974, after 
being assured by Brando that she would get reasonable visitation rights. 
</P>
<P>
By the 11th grade, Christian had dropped out of school. Tall and thin, with 
brown hair and brown eyes, he kept no steady job, but continued to live at 
home, in Brando's hilltop estate just west of Coldwater Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1980, records show, his father bought him a cabin on five acres in 
southern Washington state, an area of gentle hills with fir and cedar trees and 
salmon streams. 
</P>
<P>
Seven months later, young Brando married Mary McKenna, a makeup artist he had 
met when they were 12. McKenna, also a high school dropout, ran a cosmetics 
shop with her sister in the 700 block of North La Cienega Boulevard. The couple 
separated in June, 1983. Brando sued for divorce in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
During the divorce proceedings, he described his occupation as "tree service 
worker" and listed his monthly income at $800. His monthly expenses were listed 
at nearly twice that. 
</P>
<P>
"(He) has never worked more than occasionally," McKenna Brando responded in 
court papers. "He has never had a steady job or reliable flow of income." 
</P>
<P>
Christian's primary source of income, she said, "consisted of running errands 
for his father." 
</P>
<P>
McKenna filed a declaration contending that her husband frequently was 
violently abusive. 
</P>
<P>
"Once, when I tried to get away, he jumped on top of my car to keep me from 
going anywhere," she stated. "On another occasion, (his) brother was present 
and even his brother was afraid to help me. Even Marlon told me that the next 
time (he) tried to lay a hand on me, I should call the police." 
</P>
<P>
The divorce was made final in February, 1987. Christian got to keep his two 
trucks, a 1984 Camaro his father had given him, the Washington state property, 
and a $499,000 trust fund set up by the actor when his first-born was a baby. 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1987, Christian worked on his first -- and apparently only -- 
movie, playing the part of a hit man in an Italian film about the assassination 
of a village official. 
</P>
<P>
According to the library of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 
Beverly Hills, "there is no evidence that the film was ever released in Italy 
or anywhere else in the world." It was produced under the Italian title "La 
Posta in Gioco," and was called both "Up for Grabs" and "The Stakes" in 
English. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Brando was quoted at the time as saying that his father, whom he 
called "Pops," offered him a bit of advice before filming started: "Get the 
first three punches in. They're the ones that count."

GOP PLAN ASKS HEALTH INSURERS TO TAKE ALL APPLICANTS 
</P>

<P>
With election year politics slowing progress on major health insurance 
legislation, Assembly Republicans on Thursday offered a modest plan to lower 
the cost of insurance in hopes that more small businesses will provide it for 
their employees. 
</P>
<P>
But the GOP lawmakers and a coalition of business representatives rejected the 
idea of requiring employers to provide coverage, saying such a mandate would 
drive many small companies out of business. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to make health plans more affordable to small employers," said 
Assemblywoman Bev Hansen (R-Santa Rosa). "We cannot endorse mandated health 
care proposals that would force small businesses to lay off their workers or 
take other drastic steps to afford coverage." 
</P>
<P>
The Republican bill relies on a plan to require insurance companies to accept 
all applicants, regardless of health condition, and to create an industrywide 
pool to share the costs of providing care to the chronically ill. 
</P>
<P>
The measure also would limit premium increases and guarantee that businesses 
could renew their insurance policies. 
</P>
<P>
"The insurance industry must do its fair share to solve this problem," said 
Assemblyman William P. Baker (R-Danville). But Baker and Hansen said the 
state's budget crisis will probably force them to jettison proposals to expand 
the Medi-Cal program for the poor and to allow the state to pay private 
insurance premiums for the working poor. Those provisions would have cost 
taxpayers about $2 billion, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Without the more expensive proposals, the bill's sponsors said, the measure 
would probably help about 1 million Californians obtain insurance. An estimated 
5 million state residents are without health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
The measure was endorsed by the National Federation of Independent Businesses, 
the California Chamber of Commerce and the California Restaurant Assn. The same 
groups have opposed several competing measures under consideration by 
lawmakers, including a plan sponsored by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown that 
would require all California businesses to provide insurance to their workers. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said the Republican proposal was inadequate because it would not help 
enough people. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they may be unrealistic," Brown said. "You have to mandate to really 
cover, and it has to be employer-based." 
</P>
<P>
But others involved in the health care controversy pointed out that Brown's 
ambitious proposal probably would require a tax increase to be workable, and 
that would seem to be impractical in an election year.

FORMER MONTOYA AIDE ADMITS GUILT ON 1 OF 5 COUNTS IN PLEA BARGAIN

<P>
A former top Senate aide accused of helping ex-Sen. Joseph B. Montoya in an 
extortion scheme pleaded guilty Thursday to one felony count of making a false 
statement on a loan application. 
</P>
<P>
Amiel A. Jaramillo, who worked for Montoya as the principal consultant to the 
Senate Business and Professions Committee, thus becomes the fifth person 
convicted in a long-running federal investigation of corruption in the state 
Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for the guilty plea, U.S. Atty. David F. Levi agreed to drop four 
counts of extortion and racketeering against Jaramillo. The 36-year-old lawyer 
faces a maximum of five years in prison and a fine of $250,000. He also could 
lose his license to practice law. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a serious crime," Assistant U.S. Atty. John Vincent said. "We have 
obtained a felony conviction against this defendant and we can now move on to 
other things." 
</P>
<P>
By avoiding a time-consuming trial, federal authorities can devote their 
attention to the continuing investigation of at least five other legislators: 
Sens. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana), Frank Hill (R -- Whittier) and Daniel E. 
Boatwright (D -- Concord) and Assembly members Pat Nolan (R-Glendale) and Gwen 
Moore (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Montoya, then-chairman of the Senate Business and Professions Committee, was 
convicted of seven corruption counts in February. Former Sen. Paul Carpenter, 
now a member of the State Board of Equalization, is scheduled to go to trial in 
August on four counts of extortion, racketeering and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher H. Wing, Jaramillo's attorney, said he expects the former Montoya 
aide to be subpoenaed to appear before a federal grand jury and questioned 
about legislators, staff members and lobbyists who are under investigation. 
However, he said Jaramillo has made no deal to cooperate with the U.S. 
attorney's office in exchange for a light sentence. 
</P>
<P>
With his guilty plea, Jaramillo admitted that he failed to list more than 
$18,000 in outstanding student loans when he applied for a Veterans 
Administration loan on a house in Sacramento. Prosecutor Vincent said the 
outstanding debt, if properly reported, probably would have prevented Jaramillo 
from receiving the $116,000 loan. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence at Montoya's trial showed that Jaramillo and the Democratic senator 
from Whittier were involved in real estate transactions together, including the 
purchase of a house with Montoya's campaign funds. 
</P>
<P>
The charge of making the false statement was not included in the initial 
charges against Jaramillo, who was originally indicted along with Montoya. At 
that time, Jaramillo was accused of aiding the senator in an extortion scheme 
and of engaging in three attempts to extract money from individuals seeking 
legislative action. 
</P>
<P>
Among Jaramillo's alleged victims were a San Diego company that makes 
mail-order contact lenses, representatives of Sacramento employment agencies 
and the Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons of California. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Jaramillo and Montoya, others convicted as a result of the 
Capitol corruption investigation are former Assembly Republican staff member 
Karin Watson and former Yolo County Sheriff Rod Graham and his one-time top 
assistant, Wendell Luttrull.

SPECTRADYNE TRIES TO REALIGN ITS DEBT LOAD; 
</P>
<P>
PAY TV: THE PROVIDER OF ADULT CHANNELS IN HOTELS ALSO IS IN MERGER DISCUSSIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spectradyne Inc., the company whose adult films every traveling executive prays 
do not show up on the hotel bill, is doing a lot of its own praying these days. 
</P>
<P>
The leading provider of pay television movies to hotels, which was acquired by 
investor Marvin Davis last year, is negotiating with its lenders to restructure 
the company's finances and reduce its heavy debt load. 
</P>
<P>
The company is also in discussions about merging with Comsat Video Enterprises, 
one of its major competitors, but officials termed the talks "preliminary" and 
said no deal has been struck at this time. 
</P>
<P>
Spectradyne is facing a squeeze on its cash flow as growth in its core business 
-- providing mainstream and adult pay-per-view movies to hotel rooms -- slows 
down and the costs of wiring new rooms and acquiring rights to movies continue 
to rise. 
</P>
<P>
In a quarterly report filed last week with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Spectradyne said its debt repayment schedule has "caused the 
company to begin a review of alternative capital structures and other means to 
refinance all or a portion of its existing debt." 
</P>
<P>
Spectradyne's $440 million of debt includes $240 million in credit lines from a 
group of banks led by Wells Fargo, $125 million in reset notes and $75 million 
in subordinated debentures. 
</P>
<P>
If a deal is reached to merge Spectradyne with CVE, it would be the third 
change of ownership in as many years for the hotel cable television service. 
</P>
<P>
Davis acquired SPI Holding Inc., Spectradyne's parent company, in a highly 
leveraged transaction in which he paid $64.9 million for the common stock and 
assumed $575 million of Spectradyne's debt and other obligations. 
</P>
<P>
Davis acquired the common shares from Ft. Worth investor Robert M. Bass, who 
less than two years earlier had bought the company from its original owners in 
a leveraged buyout. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC filing also reported that Spectradyne has exhausted its primary bank 
credit line of $225 million and has already drawn an additional $7 million from 
a supplemental $15-million line because its cash flow since October, 1987, 
could not service its debt. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the company said its operating cash flow "fell below expectations" by 
$720,000 in the first quarter of 1990, which resulted in borrowing an extra $1 
million from its supplemental credit facility. 
</P>
<P>
For the first three months of 1990, Spectradyne posted a net loss of $19 
million on revenue of $35.4 million. The company generates the majority of its 
revenue from pay-per-view systems in hotel rooms, but the frequency of hotel 
guests' movie orders has been slipping in recent quarters, even though 
Spectradyne added 108,000 rooms during the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"They have had trouble with viewing levels and maintaining their margins," said 
James Bolin, a vice president at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. in New York. "They 
haven't been hitting their targets." 
</P>
<P>
Bolin and other analysts said Spectradyne is not in imminent financial danger 
and the basic business of providing cable television to hotels remains stable. 
A recession, though, could dampen business travel, which in turn would have an 
impact on hotel occupancy rates and therefore the use of Spectradyne's service. 
</P>
<P>
In the SEC filing, the company said it expects to borrow an additional $2 
million from its supplemental credit line during the second quarter and 
increase cash flow by cutting costs and trying to get hotel guests to order pay 
television movies more frequently . 
</P>
<P>
James Boso, president of Richardson, Tex.-based Spectradyne, confirmed that 
Comsat Video Enterprises executives have met with Davis Co. officials regarding 
a possible merger. Analysts said CVE could provide an equity infusion that 
would reduce its debt load. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, it hasn't gone anywhere," Boso said. "There is no proposal on 
the table." 
</P>
<P>
He would not comment on recapitalization plans, but said he does not expect to 
exhaust the remaining $8 million of the company's $15-million supplemental 
credit line. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Spectradyne could run into trouble next year, however, when it 
must begin making principal repayment on its senior bank loan, and in 1992-93, 
when it must begin making cash payments on its reset notes and preferred stock. 
Until then, payments are made "in kind," meaning with additional notes or 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
Spectradyne is available in 670,000 hotel rooms in the United States. Comsat 
Video Enterprises, its nearest competitor, is available in 300,000 rooms. CVE 
is estimated to have lost $18 million on revenue of $50 million last year. CVE 
started as a joint venture between Comsat and Holiday Inns Corp., but Holiday 
Inns sold out its interest to Comsat in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said one of the problems that Spectradyne faces is slower growth 
because it has already "wired" major hotel chains, including Hilton, Marriot, 
Sheraton and others with 300 rooms or more. Future growth lies in smaller 
hotels or new markets such as hospitals or overseas hotels.

AMERICAN STORES HOPES TO SELL 161 STORES AS PACKAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA L. La GANGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American Stores Co. pledged Thursday to sell 152 Alpha Beta and 9 Lucky 
supermarkets in Southern California as a package instead of piecemeal, but 
industry analysts said a buyer for the entire chain would be hard to find in 
the current retail market. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which has spent two years trying to merge the two operations into 
one chain, agreed Wednesday to sell the stores within five years as part of a 
legal settlement with the California Attorney General's Office. 
</P>
<P>
Michael T. Miller, senior vice president for Salt Lake City-based American 
Stores, said the company has no prospective buyers lined up. In fact, he said, 
it has yet to even hire an investment banker to put the deal together. 
</P>
<P>
"This issue of selling Alpha Beta is something that evolved in the last eight 
days," Miller said Thursday. "We had no premature indication that we would go 
in this direction. We hadn't had an opportunity to even consider who might be 
possible buyers. I assume that there might be a number of chains . . . 
interested in going into the most dynamic growth market in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
But the most dynamic growth market is also among the most competitive, retail 
analysts said. They think American Stores will be hard-pressed to keep the 
chain together. Miller said that if the 161 stores can't be sold together 
within three years, the company will consider breaking them up. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the market conditions and availability of money, it's not a great market 
to go out and sell stores," said Neil Stern, a partner in the Chicago retail 
consulting firm of McMillan/Doolittle. "There are not a lot of buyers. And it's 
a huge acquisition for one." 
</P>
<P>
Stern also said the stores don't make a particularly attractive package because 
most are around 35,000 square feet -- half the size of supermarkets being built 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Who might buy? Most industry experts refused to name names, but they did 
speculate Thursday about the kind of operation that might be interested. John 
B. Kosecoff, managing director at the New York investment firm of First 
Manhattan Co., said it could be a California chain wishing to gain size and 
economy of scale or a chain outside the state desiring a presence here. 
</P>
<P>
Another analyst said large grocery wholesalers such as Super Value in 
Minneapolis and Fleming Foods Co. in Oklahoma City could find the chain 
attractive. 
</P>
<P>
Stern said he could think of only two possible takers and, even then, the match 
between buyer and seller would not be perfect. 
</P>
<P>
"Albertson's has the money, but generally does not buy stores -- instead builds 
them," he said. "The only other company that publicly announced a commitment to 
California is Smith's Food King." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Knechtel, a manager at Alpha Beta's office and warehouse center in La 
Habra, said Alpha Beta management had discussed three options for the company, 
including a buyout by former Alpha Beta executives. Smith's Food King of 
Arizona has expressed interest in buying Alpha Beta to gain entry to the 
California market, Knechtel said, and management has said it would welcome 
Japanese investors. 
</P>
<P>
Knechtel told more than 100 employees at the La Habra facility Thursday morning 
that their jobs are not in jeopardy and that the company would be better off 
with another owner. 
</P>
<P>
Not all agreed with his view. John C. Sperry, president of the Buena Park-based 
United Food and Commercial Workers union Local 324, which represents 3,660 of 
the estimated 12,000 Alpha Beta employees in Southern California, said through 
a spokesman: "I believe that John Van de Kamp jumped the gun on this issue. In 
the long run, it will harm the employees and the consumer. It will harm the 
employees because of the loss of jobs. It will harm the consumer with higher 
prices when these stores are sold off to independent market owners instead of 
food-industry chains." 
</P>
<P>
Sperry had a surprising ally in John M. Lillie, former Lucky chairman. In a 
Thursday letter to Van de Kamp, Lillie said that the Southern California 
grocery market has become "somewhat less competitive in recent years" and the 
settlement would not resolve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"The sale of Alpha Beta will most likely produce another weak competitor that 
will have no favorable impact on price competition," he wrote. "The Lucky/Alpha 
Beta combination would have produced major cost savings which would have 
supported consumer prices."

American Stores stock rose $3.50 on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday, to 
close at $69. Analysts and company officials said the investor reaction was 
part relief and part support. "I think the settlement was what people have been 
waiting for," Stern said.

AUTOS: CHRYSLER'S NEW TV AD CAMPAIGN FAILS TO BOOST SALES. SOME SAY IT SMACKS 
OF DESPERATION.

Lee A. Iacocca, who became a national hero after resurrecting Chrysler Corp. in 
the early 1980s, has again taken center stage as the United States' No. 3 car 
company mounts a major marketing assault aimed squarely at the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
New television commercials depict the company's flamboyant chairman arguing 
that the American people aren't getting the real message about Chrysler cars: 
that they are every bit as good as Japanese autos. Using Chrysler-commissioned 
surveys, Iacocca even argues that, given a choice, Americans will choose 
Chryslers over Hondas. 
</P>
<P>
So does Iacocca still have the charisma to rally the American public? Judging 
by recent sales, not so far. 
</P>
<P>
In the first 10 days of May, Chrysler sold 21.3% fewer cars and trucks than in 
the comparable period a year ago. Moreover, there are signs that Chrysler's 
Japanese competitors aren't taking him very seriously, either. 
</P>
<P>
Some market analysts argued that the aggressive new marketing campaign, dubbed 
"Advantage: Chrysler," is really an act of desperation, a tacit admission that 
maybe the Japanese are just better at making and selling cars. 
</P>
<P>
Others criticize the marketing campaign as hypocritical "Japan-bashing," 
especially since Chrysler was one of the first joint-venture partners with the 
Japanese and still imports Mitsubishi cars under its own nameplate. Mitsubishi 
even designed Chrysler's new Dodge Stealth sports car, which will be introduced 
in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Some suggest that Iacocca should be leveling his attacks not at the Japanese, 
but at himself for neglecting Chrysler affairs to the point that sales 
plummeted in the mid-1980s. And they argue that the days are over when Iacocca 
could sell cars through sheer dint of his personality. 
</P>
<P>
Consider this episode: 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America, the Cypress-based U.S. marketing arm of the 
Japanese auto maker, held a meeting of district sales managers about a month 
ago at which they screened a parody of an Iacocca commercial. 
</P>
<P>
An Iacocca character stalks a Chrysler boardroom, fuming over the way American 
car buyers chose a Japanese-branded car over an American-branded one -- even 
though the cars are identical and made in the same factory. In the parody, 
Iacocca's voice is dubbed to make it appear that he is praising the Japanese 
and saying he wishes he had their sales force. 
</P>
<P>
The line raised a cheer among the Mitsubishi executives. That's because 
Mitsubishi is actually Chrysler's partner in a joint venture called 
Diamond-Star Motors in Illinois that builds cars for both companies -- the cars 
that Iacocca alludes to in the commercial. 
</P>
<P>
"I smile, because (in the real Chrysler commercial) he's giving us credit for 
doing a better job of marketing our products out of Diamond-Star than he did," 
said Richard D. Recchia, executive vice president and chief operating officer 
of Mitsubishi Motor Sales. 
</P>
<P>
At American Honda Motor Co., the target of some Chrysler ads, officials have no 
plans to respond to Chrysler's offensive. "We're not making any comment about" 
the ads, said Robert Butorac, a Honda spokesman. "We think the sales numbers 
speak for themselves." In the first 10 days of May, sales of U.S.-made Hondas 
were up 32.3%. 
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's annual meeting of Chrysler shareholders in Universal City, 
Iacocca stoutly defended his campaign, saying that it's high time that Chrysler 
started tooting its own horn. He denied that the campaign was Japan-bashing, 
calling that term a code word for racism. 
</P>
<P>
"I had some strong words about Japan's trade policies, and even stronger words 
about our own government for letting Japan get away with them," he said. "But I 
never said a negative word about the Japanese people, whom I happen to respect, 
or about the products they make, which are damn good -- yet I'm called a 
Japan-basher." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "We're not going to be intimidated by that kind of gutter innuendo. 
I'm sorry to say it seems to come with the territory these days, if you're an 
American trying to peddle your wares and you have the audacity to say they're 
as good as the other guy's -- and that's all we're saying." 
</P>
<P>
Iacocca left the meeting without answering reporters' questions. 
</P>
<P>
However, Gerald Greenwald, Chrysler's vice chairman and the likely successor to 
Iacocca when he leaves the chief executive's suite at the end of 1991, conceded 
in an interview that the campaign could be viewed as an admission that Chrysler 
hadn't sold itself well enough in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"We were being self-critical of our own communications capabilities, and we 
were trying with regard to the issue of marketing to be provocative in the 
minds of the American consumer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he denied that the campaign was an act of desperation, or that Chrysler's 
troubles stem from any inattention by Iacocca during the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
He also denied any hypocrisy in the campaign, arguing that it was aimed at 
specific Japanese competitors, not at all Japanese autos. He pointed out that 
Mitsubishi imports account for only a fraction of Chrysler's sales, and that 
Chrysler is scaling back such sales. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, not everyone is critical. Chrysler has taken steps to pull up its 
market share, and the quality of its products has improved, some analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"(Chrysler) is confident about the gains they have made in product quality and 
reliability, as well as in new technology added to the vehicles, and they are 
trying to get that message across to consumers," said Chris Cedergren, an 
automotive market analyst and director of competitive assessments at J. D. 
Power &amp; Associates, an Agoura Hills-based market research firm. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler needs a breakthrough. Its share of the U.S. market for cars and light 
trucks fell to 12.4% in the first four months of 1990 from 14% in the same 
period last year, according to Ward's Automotive Reports. By contrast, Toyota's 
total share jumped to 7.2% from 5.6% and Honda's to 5.7% from 5%. In sales of 
cars alone, Honda, with 8.5% of the market, is closing in on Chrysler, with 
8.8%. 
</P>
<P>
It's quite a change from the heady days when Iacocca brought Chrysler back from 
the brink of bankruptcy with such innovative products as the K-car, the minivan 
and the LeBaron convertible. 
</P>
<P>
But in the mid-1980s, Iacocca's attention was distracted from Chrysler business 
by his work with the Statue of Liberty restoration, a divorce, books and other 
outside activities, critics said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a former executive, who asked not to be identified, said many 
Chrysler executives may have been cowed by the cult of personality that grew up 
around their boss. Iacocca failed to heed the advice of his lieutenants to go 
forward with development of a V-6 engine, leaving Chrysler to rely on a 
Mitsubishi engine for some of its models, the executive said. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts questioned several other decisions, including the purchase of American 
Motors Corp. several years ago. It saddled Chrysler with enormous costs and a 
sizable underfunded pension liability. In addition, the company cut a 
$250-million deal with Italy's Maserati car company that resulted in an 
expensive but poor-selling luxury sports coupe. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chrysler's main product line has developed notable gaps, 
particularly a subcompact to replace the defunct Dodge Omni/Plymouth Horizon 
and a mid-sized passenger car to compete with the likes of Ford's Taurus, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
But there are signs that Iacocca has placed his hands back on the wheel. The 
company is cutting $1.5 billion in costs and has sold off non-automotive 
divisions. And Chrysler will bring out several new models by the mid-1990s to 
rejuvenate its passenger car line, including the much-anticipated Dodge Viper 
sports car premiering in late 1991. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, will the "Advantage: Chrysler" campaign work? "From the 
beginning, there was a fear that that there may be some backlash from 
consumers" who might resent the implication that they were being duped by the 
Japanese, said George Peterson, president of AutoPacific Group, a Santa 
Ana-based automotive marketing and product-consulting company. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "That does not seem to have been the case based on our own 
research."

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / S.J. DIAMOND: GASOLINE RIP-OFFS ARE DIFFICULT TO DETECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S.J. DIAMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's surprising how many people suspect their gas station of "watering the 
gas." Others suspect that they were cheated because their gas gauge should have 
moved further for the amount of gas pumped. Still more drive away from stations 
offering discounts for cash with a sum of money that just doesn't seem right. 
</P>
<P>
Could be. Nobody really "waters" gas, but there are other possible abuses, 
including falsified octane ratings, short measures of gas, inflated charges. 
Inherently complicated, gasoline sales involve multiple pumps, multiple prices, 
and arithmetic that requires a calculator. Only later, given receipts and time 
to check them, can the consumer catch the fact that his station charged $17.70 
for 12.4 gallons of unleaded at $1.399, when the total should have been $17.35, 
and $17 (not the correct $16.69) for 12.1 gallons at $1.379. 
</P>
<P>
The tradition of adding .9 to every price adds complication, as does an 
unusually large spread between self-serve and full-serve prices (service 
shouldn't cost 40 cents a gallon, say insiders), and instant cash discounts. 
"The consumer could get ripped off right and left," says Steve Shelton, 
executive director of the Southern California Service Station Dealers Assn., 
"but he has the power to police the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
Not always. The consumer can't really analyze the content of his gas, 
particularly the octane rating that distinguishes regular from premium 
gasolines. Indeed, a recent report from the General Accounting Office found 
octane rating misrepresented in about 9% of gas samples nationwide and in more 
than 50% of samples from some states. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act of 1978, the EPA and FTC are 
responsible for making sure consumers get accurate information about octane 
ratings, but if they ever started testing and enforcing, they stopped some 
years ago, says the GAO. It may even be understandable: Mislabeling is less 
likely to occur at refineries or bulk terminals, where it's constantly tested, 
than at wholesale or retail outlets; enforcement must, therefore, be local. 
</P>
<P>
But local action isn't guaranteed: Only 20 states have their own octane-testing 
programs. In California, for example, the state Food and Agriculture 
Department's division of measurement standards has gasoline-testing labs in 
Sacramento and Anaheim. The bureau picks up samples in response to consumer 
complaints, does some random sampling, and every five years, does a statewide 
survey of stations. 
</P>
<P>
Local authorities do more regular station inspections, checking everything from 
the accuracy of the price signs to the anti-drain valves on nozzles. At that, 
they cover large areas. Los Angeles County's Department of Weights and Measures 
inspects 3,400 stations and 42,000 "nozzles," with six inspectors. New York 
City's Consumer Affairs Department covers all five boroughs, its five 
inspectors checking over 14,000 pumps last year at 1,600 gas stations. 
</P>
<P>
It's a myth that sophisticated inspectors can judge octane rating just by the 
color of the gas. Those they inspect are also sophisticated: "They get wise to 
us and compromise the color," says Bob Kelley, deputy director of enforcement 
for New York City's Consumer Affairs Department. But given complaints, or their 
own suspicions that "the price isn't right, and the color's off," they take 
samples for lab testing. 
</P>
<P>
The measure of gas pumped and the charge are another problem. "People 
automatically assume the amounts on the pump are going to be right," says 
Joseph Jamora, division chief at Los Angeles County Weights and Measures. 
</P>
<P>
But many pumps are still mechanical, even when the remote console at the 
cashier's booth is electronic, and both the measure and the charge have to be 
set manually -- every time the price changes. Given the likelihood of manual 
error, one pump off out of 12 is considered forgivable, but 3 out of 12 would 
be unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
Inaccuracies in the volume of gas pumped are usually just "sloppy 
housekeeping," says Kelley, and 65% of those inaccuracies actually come out in 
the consumer's favor. But "when the charges are off," he says, "it's never in 
favor of the consumer." 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors generally visit unannounced, but are almost immediately 
identifiable: Few consumers pull out 5-gallon calibrated measures and start 
drawing off gasoline. California's inspectors take 10 gallons worth to check 
the volume measure, then check the accuracy of the charge by multiplying the 
unit price by 10 and seeing if the price on the pump agrees with the answer. 
</P>
<P>
The consumer could duplicate some of this routine, protecting himself at least 
against overcharges -- one reason, perhaps, that in Kelley's experience, 
overcharges are much rarer than octane misrepresentation. But few consumers are 
that methodical about their suspicions: They tend to go by the gauge, says 
Jamora, complaining that they seemed to get less than they paid for. And those 
who are least suspicious -- a station's loyal, regular customers -- probably 
have most cause to be: "Smart people only steal from their known customers," 
says Kelley. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers can certainly guard against today's most common cheat -- by all 
accounts, a failure to give the promised cash discount. Some pumps register 
both cash and credit prices, but most show only credit price, leaving it to an 
attendant to calculate and hand back the difference. An inattentive customer 
may be handed the wrong change or be told that the stated price is already 
discounted, and a very inattentive customer may be told nothing at all. 
</P>
<P>
But the gambit is easily foiled. Consumers (as if they didn't have enough to 
watch for) need only ask.

Inspections Ordered for Boeing 737: The Federal Aviation Administration has 
ordered emergency inspections of Boeing 737s built in the past two years after 
a steering wheel came off in a co-pilot's hands during flight. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing said an inspection after the plane landed revealed that a pin fastening 
the wheel to the steering column was missing. In its inspection order, the FAA 
said "this condition is likely to exist on other airplanes." The FAA and Boeing 
said the missing pins did not mean 737s were unsafe.

Money Supply Mixed: The Federal Reserve Board reported that the narrowest 
measure of the nation's money supply, known as M1, fell in the week ended May 7 
to a seasonally adjusted $805.5 billion from $805.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
A broader measure, M2, rose to a seasonally adjusted $3,271.6 billion from 
$3,269.2 billion the previous week. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits 
in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts such 
as savings deposits and money market mutual funds.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: SOME GROWTH STOCKS STILL A GOOD BUY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With apologies both to Bart Simpson and to his many detractors, the 'toon kid 
could probably summarize the stock market's current state pretty well: "Don't 
have a cow, man -- the good stocks aren't all gone!" 
</P>
<P>
If you think it's too late to get in on the market rally, you're probably 
making two mistakes: First, thinking it's too late; and second, being panicked 
over timing, period. 
</P>
<P>
True, many good stocks have jumped sharply this year, as investors have once 
again focused on the basics -- that is, they've flocked to stocks of "growth" 
companies that are capable of posting 15% annual earnings gains or better. 
</P>
<P>
But let's say you zero in on a stock such as Boeing, and you fear that it's 
overpriced now at $77.125, or 14 times estimated 1990 earnings per share. In 
March, a lot of investors worried that Boeing was rich at $67.375, or 12 times 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Who knows whether, a year from now, Boeing will be selling for 16 times 
estimated 1991 earnings. The point is, Boeing's earnings growth looks very 
healthy for another two to three years. That's a lot of insurance for an 
investor, and that's what the market is paying for these days. 
</P>
<P>
If you hunt for growth stocks now, you're going to pay more than you would have 
paid in March, by and large. If you keep waiting for prices to go lower, 
however, you may be disappointed. And even if stocks take a hit soon, how will 
you know when we're at the bottom? 
</P>
<P>
Growth stock investors take a long-term view and they put their faith in a 
market axiom that is almost never wrong: If the company's earnings keep rising, 
so will the stock price. That's why the Dow Jones industrial index has risen 
from 41.32 in 1932 to 2,831.71 now. 
</P>
<P>
Bill D'Alonzo, who runs the very successful Brandywine stock mutual fund 
(assets: $220 million) in Wilmington, Del., says simply: "We're not market 
timers. We don't want to be sitting here every day agonizing over the market's 
short-term moves." 
</P>
<P>
His fund is up 21% over the past 12 months on the strength of his stock 
picking. When D'Alonzo looks at the market today, he still sees stocks that are 
reasonably priced for a two-year time horizon. 
</P>
<P>
Here, some ideas from D'Alonzo and two other money managers: 
</P>
<P>
* D'Alonzo has had a big winner in ShowBiz/Pizza Time, the Irving, Tex.-based 
restaurant chain that succeeded the first (and now defunct) Chuck E. Cheese 
restaurants. New management has engineered a turnaround by shifting the focus 
to a younger crowd (kids aged 2 to 12), he said. At 13 times estimated 1990 
earnings per share of $1.90 (including tax benefits), the stock still looks 
attractive to D'Alonzo. 
</P>
<P>
He also cites SynOptics Communications. The Mountain View, Calif., firm designs 
computer networking systems for companies -- a fast-growing market. SynOptics 
sells for 20 times estimated 1990 earnings per share of $1.95. But based on 
estimated 1991 earnings of $2.65, the stock's price-to-earnings multiple is 15. 
That's very reasonable for a growth stock, D'Alonzo says. 
</P>
<P>
* Gordon Fines, senior portfolio manager at IDS in Minneapolis, oversees some 
of the stock fund industry's stars, including the IDS Growth fund. Fines looks 
at a red-hot stock such as Compaq Computer and still sees a bargain at 12 times 
estimated 1990 earnings. At $118.75 a share, he says, "that's just no big deal 
for a company growing at Compaq's rate." He feels the same about casino firm 
Circus Circus and tobacco/food giant Philip Morris. 
</P>
<P>
* Prudential-Bache Securities this month pulled together a list of 23 solid 
growth stocks that it believes could lead the pack in the early 1990s. Included 
are retailer Melville Corp. (Marshall's, Thom McAn shoe stores and CVS drug 
stores, among others); Newell Co., a very profitable maker of appliances and 
products for the kitchen and bath, and Chips &amp; Technologies, a computer 
chip company that Pru-Bache says "leads the industry in innovation."

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: WANT HOBBY TO BE BUSINESS? BEWARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Turning your hobby into a business sounds like a good way to make money while 
having fun. But if you're not careful, you'll lose your shirt and your interest 
in what was once your passion. 
</P>
<P>
People who have successfully transformed hobbies into small businesses say no 
matter how much you love something, you must step back and treat it like a 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Having a clear vision of the potential market and enough money in hand to last 
at least a year are essential ingredients for success, according to these 
entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is the dream of most collectors to make their hobby into a 
business, but most are not successful," said Larry Whitlow, who began 
collecting coins and stamps as a child. 
</P>
<P>
At 18, Whitlow paid $35 a month in rent for his first coin shop. He knew a lot 
about coins and was sure he could make some money buying and selling them. But 
within three months, he ran out of money and closed the shop. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlow, who now owns Galleria Unique, an elegant coin, fine arts and antique 
gallery in Oakbrook Terrace, Ill., said his first venture taught him to keep 
his emotions in check while pursuing objects for his store. 
</P>
<P>
"When you buy something for $100 and sell it for $75, you remember it," said 
Whitlow. Over the years, Whitlow said he has learned to separate his passion 
for collecting beautiful objects from the business aspects of selling them. He 
has surrounded himself with experts in various fields and sought help in 
running the business side. This year, he expects sales to reach $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
If you are thinking of creating a business around your hobby, Whitlow 
recommends finding a job with a company that does something similar so that you 
can learn as much as possible before going out on your own. Bob Marriott was a 
real estate developer who learned about the fly-fishing equipment business by 
hanging around a friend's store. 
</P>
<P>
With high interest rates thwarting his development projects, Marriott bought 
the business from his friend in 1983. It has flourished as fly-fishing has 
gained popularity as an international sport. 
</P>
<P>
Fly-fishermen shun live bait in favor of flies designed to resemble insects and 
other natural materials. All handmade, the flies are wrapped with brightly 
colored feathers and other decorative materials. 
</P>
<P>
Marriott and his partner, Larry Alperin, operate three fly-fishing equipment 
stores in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"I got into the business for the business and not for the sport," said 
Marriott, who also set up an international mail-order catalogue. "But I knew if 
I wanted to do some fishing, I had to create enough volume to hire people to 
keep this going when I'm away." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the three fly-fishing stores employ about 14 people and host workshops 
taught by celebrity fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
Marriott's partner, Alperin, said that although he works hard in the business, 
he still considers it more of a hobby than a job. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people say don't turn your hobby into a business because you won't like 
it any more," said Alperin, who sold his commercial printing business a few 
years ago with the thought of retiring. 
</P>
<P>
While Marriott and Alperin surround themselves with feathers and reels, Jim 
Bennett spends much of his time surrounded by show horses at the Los Angeles 
Equestrian Center. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, who grew up on a farm, moved to California four years ago from Texas. 
In 1988, he was offered a chance to take over a training stable at the 
Equestrian Center in Burbank. Soon, his Bennett Farms began to attract a 
star-studded clientele, including actors Patrick Duffy and William Shatner and 
singer Stephen Stills. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a barn filled with dozens of glorious horses and loyal clients, Bennett 
said he lost a tremendous amount of money the first year because he lost 
control of expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"The business is just now beginning to break even and make a little bit of 
profit," said Bennett, who spends about 20 or more hours a week at the barn 
when he is not working as a clinical director for ASAP Family Inc., a chemical 
dependency treatment program. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett said his greatest challenge was hiring the right people, especially 
since he can't be in the barn all the time. He relies on his trainer, Renee 
Hammond, to keep track of the horses and clients. Someone else handles the 
finances. 
</P>
<P>
 "At times, it becomes a more of a job and less fun," admited Bennett. He said 
he still needs to keep better track of the money because when you are dealing 
with horses, "it comes in and flows out so quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes a hobby spawns an idea for a potentially big business. Two Los 
Angeles real estate and hotel developers, Bo and Robert Zarnegin, recently 
opened the Los Angeles Fine Arts &amp; Wine Storage Co. to house their 
extensive wine and art collection and similar items owned by collectors 
throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
"Our own collections of post-Impressionist and contemporary art works began to 
overflow our ability to display them in our homes and offices," said Bo 
Zarnegin, executive vice president of Probity International Corp. 
</P>
<P>
When Zarnegin and his brother couldn't find a secure, fireproof place for their 
valuable paintings, they spent about $8 million building a 45,000-square-foot 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
They think that it will be successful because so many wealthy art and wine 
collectors live in Southern California. Depending on the size of the room and 
what is stored inside, monthly rents range from about $20 to $700.

A Maoist rebel faction said it is suspending military action in Peru while it 
reviews its anti-government struggle, but it vowed to resume its armed 
insurgency. In leaflets found in the Andean city of Ayacucho on the 10th 
anniversary of the Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) uprising, rebels who claim 
to represent a splinter faction said they will lay down their arms to "evaluate 
all our brilliant actions of the decade and then return with new impulses and 
ideas." Three bombs rocked Ayacucho, birthplace of the Maoist movement, and a 
10-year-old boy was injured, police said.

A senior Contra rebel leader said the June 10 deadline for disarming the 
Nicaraguan insurgent force is "utopian" and that at least 10,000 rebels will 
still be armed on that date. Contra political leader Aristides Sanchez said a 
strike by Sandinista workers this week showed that President Violeta Barrios de 
Chamorro is not in full control of the government and could not guarantee the 
security of the disarmed rebels. "Whenever the Sandinistas want, they can 
paralyze the country," Sanchez said.

Students at Mills College ended their two-week blockade of campus buildings, 
expressing hopes that the school's officials will reverse or postpone their 
decision to admit undergraduate men in 1991. The blockade began the day of the 
officials' decision to go co-ed, which they said is needed to boost enrollment 
and restore the school to financial health. The college's trustees are 
scheduled to meet today to study faculty and alumni plans to keep Mills a 
women's school.

The city of San Francisco has notified the Modesto Irrigation District that it 
intends to file suit challenging a proposed water treatment plant. "It is truly 
with a heavy heart that the city has determined that it must proceed with 
litigation regarding your environmental impact report for the domestic water 
treatment plant," Mayor Art Agnos wrote the district. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit would challenge an environmental impact report on the $200-million 
plant that would deliver Tuolumne River water to 160,000 customers in Modesto 
and outlying areas. San Francisco officials charge that the report did not 
adequately analyze the underground water supply or detail the effects on San 
Francisco's water supply and does not explore conservation options. MID 
President Bill Lyons called the pending litigation an attempt by San Francisco 
to control more than its share of river water. "We will not sit down and talk 
with a gun to our heads. It's blackmail," he said.

A proposal that malpractice insurance costs to obstetricians, which now often 
run $40,000 a year, be spread out over the larger medical community through a 
small hospital bed tax, or through health insurance premiums paid by all 
individuals, was made by Walter Zelman, a candidate for the Democratic 
nomination for insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Zelman said California now ranks 36th out of the 50 states in the percentage of 
pregnant women receiving prenatal care. In part, he said, this is because many 
obstetricians have been driven out of their specialty by malpractice insurance 
costs. It is also a result of cuts in state aid for the needy, he said.

'SWEETHEART SWINDLER' CAPTURED, POLICE SAY; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE GLIB CHARMER ALLEGEDLY BILKED LONELY WOMEN COAST-TO-COAST. THE 
DAUGHTER-IN-LAW OF ONE ALERTED AUTHORITIES.

<P>
As a dancer, they say, George Perkins wasn't much. But, heavens, what a 
charmer. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't just shake your hand when he met you. He enfolded it warmly and 
pulled you close. He sent flowers. He called constantly. There were movies, 
dinners, moonlit strolls. 
</P>
<P>
And he was so good-humored that even the police were struck by it, even though 
the 56-year-old man is suspected of defrauding at least a dozen elderly women 
throughout the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"I call him the Sweetheart Swindler," said a 69-year-old Florida divorcee whom 
he wooed and allegedly bilked. "Oh brother, is he smooth, smooth, smooth!" 
</P>
<P>
So smooth, in fact, that when authorities caught up with him this week -- 
dining at a Redondo Beach coffee shop with a widowed grandmother -- he 
reportedly looked up from his spaghetti and quipped, "Gee fellows, this isn't a 
very funny joke." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the allegations against him are anything but funny. 
</P>
<P>
Perkins, whose real name is Leslie Joseph Gall, has a criminal history dating 
back more than 15 years. At the time of his arrest Sunday, he was being sought 
by authorities ranging from a pair of Florida detectives to the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police. 
</P>
<P>
With nerve, charm and fake IDs, authorities say, he stole tens of thousands of 
dollars from women he met at senior citizens' dances. He also has been 
convicted of defrauding businesses in Canada, police said. In Southern 
California, police said, he had latched onto at least two grandmothers, one in 
Pico Rivera and the other in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Although neither of the local women is pressing charges, there are at least two 
cases pending against him in Florida, police said. On Thursday, he was being 
transported to Los Angeles County Jail pending extradition and was unavailable 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities in Florida say they had been seeking him for more than a year 
before he was caught because of the suspicions of the daughter-in-law of the 
Redondo Beach widow he was wooing and the persistence of a Mountie in Niagara 
Falls. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to read stories like this and think, 'This couldn't happen to us,' " 
said the daughter-in-law, a Torrance flight attendant who told the story on the 
condition the family remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
"But it did happen. And this is a story that must be told, because all along, 
people kept telling us that it was our imagination, that he was a nice guy, 
that she was in love, let her alone," the daughter-in-law said. "Well, now 
she's heartbroken. And these are supposed to be her golden years! He could have 
stripped her of everything." 
</P>
<P>
The case of Leslie Joseph Gall is long and Byzantine. In Ontario, Canada, where 
police say he began his career embezzling from businesses, there are 11 
outstanding warrants for his arrest. He had at least eight identities, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But to the white-haired Redondo Beach woman who met him three years after her 
husband's death -- and to most of the women he allegedly bilked or tried to 
bilk -- he was George L. Perkins, a man of indeterminate age and wealth, who 
had smiled beguilingly from across a room full of waltzing single grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
"She met him around Christmas at a dance in Hawthorne for people in their 60s 
and 70s," the daughter-in-law said. "Many of the other ladies had their eyes on 
him. She was so honored because he had picked her." 
</P>
<P>
Before long, the family noticed, "she was very busy, going to movies, dances, 
daily excursions." 
</P>
<P>
One day, early in the relationship, the widow called her son and 
daughter-in-law and invited them to meet the new man. They had lunch. 
</P>
<P>
"And right then, I got a funny feeling about the guy," the daughter-in-law 
said. "He was a real joker. He'd never answer a question straight." At one 
point, she said, she asked him what his profession had been. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Do you mean before or after I was in prison?' " the daughter-in-law 
said. "When I asked him what he was talking about, he said 'Can't you take a 
joke?' " 
</P>
<P>
Uncomfortable, the daughter-in-law kept quiet, even though her father-in-law on 
his death bed "begged us to take care of her." 
</P>
<P>
"I figured, 'This guy is too young. It's too good to be true,' " she said. 
"Well the next thing you know, he's moved in with her. And when we told her we 
didn't like it, she made it clear that she was madly in love with him." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, she said, her mother-in-law was paying for plane tickets to Florida and 
weekends in Las Vegas. Most ominous was the joint savings account, opened, the 
daughter-in-law said, because he had claimed a Canadian couldn't have an 
account of his own in this country without a Social Security card. 
</P>
<P>
She began checking up on George. She even put the question to a deejay on a 
call-in radio show. She enlisted her sister-in-law to collect information: his 
license plate number, his date of birth. 
</P>
<P>
"Our husbands were going, 'Let her alone. Let her live her life. She's having a 
good time,' " she said. "But we both felt something in our stomach about him, 
and it was making us sick." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in May -- as the Canadian-born suitor was begging her mother-in-law to 
marry him -- she telephoned Cpl. Tom Hennigar of the Mounties. She read him the 
license plate number. The plate, Hennigar said, had been stolen. 
</P>
<P>
Hennigar checked further and was referred to the Clearwater, Fla., police, who 
had two warrants out for Leslie Gall -- alias George Perkins -- in connection 
with a divorcee he had allegedly defrauded of $40,000 there and an alleged 
bigamous marriage to a Ft. Lauderdale widow. 
</P>
<P>
The Clearwater divorcee, a semi-retired beautician who asked that her name not 
be used, said Gall told her he needed her money for a real estate deal. She had 
met him, she said, when they locked eyes across a dance floor at the Holiday 
Park Social Center for Seniors. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry I ever went out for that first cup of coffee. He's a worm. They 
don't come any lower than him," she said. "I'm still sick over it. But I was a 
lonely woman, and I was swept off my feet." 
</P>
<P>
Hennigar alerted the Florida authorities, who called the police in Redondo 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Beach Police Lt. John Nelson said officers caught Gall with two 
briefcases full of fake ID. Also in the briefcases, he said, were stock 
certificates, blank power-of-attorney forms and blank checks linking Gall with 
at least 10 women -- including the Pico Rivera grandmother. Nelson said the 
woman was stunned when police told her that Gall was carrying several thousand 
dollars worth of stock certificates that belonged to her. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the briefcase were newspaper clippings detailing con jobs elsewhere and 
reporting the deaths of rich men, Nelson said. "Love Scam Bilks Lonely," a 
clipping said, and "Man Serves Less Than Four Months in $500,000 Swindle." 
</P>
<P>
Gall was in the holding tank at the Redondo Beach Police Department, awaiting 
extradition on Wednesday when he got one last lucky break. The jailer 
mistakenly let him go, believing there were no longer any charges on which to 
hold him. 
</P>
<P>
At 3 a.m. Wednesday, Gall blithely walked free. 
</P>
<P>
The daughter-in-law said he showed up almost immediately at her mother-in-law's 
home, took the car, drove to the home of the woman in Pico Rivera and then 
returned to Redondo Beach. To disguise himself, he had shaved not only his 
salt-and-pepper beard but his head as well. 
</P>
<P>
"They picked him up," she said, "as he was coming out of a bank" where the 
Redondo Beach widow had secured a safe deposit box in both their names.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AIDS TESTS AGAIN URGED FOR TRANSFUSION 
PATIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hospital Council of Southern California and the Los Angeles County Medical 
Assn. on Thursday reiterated earlier recommendations that people who received 
blood transfusions between 1978 and June, 1985, have their blood tested for 
AIDS antibodies. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, the two organizations announced "The AIDS Notification 
Campaign," designed to increase early diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus 
infection, the cause of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"With the recent findings that early diagnosis and AZT therapy can prolong the 
life of HIV-infected patients, we feel that everyone who received transfusions 
during that time should now be tested," David Langness, vice president of the 
hospital council, said in a prepared statement. "This is especially important 
for children, who could see major advancement in the treatment of AIDS in their 
lifetime."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NETWORKS LOSE BID FOR TAPES IN MENENDEZ 
CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Monica Superior Court Judge James A. Albracht on Thursday denied requests 
by the ABC and NBC television networks for potentially key evidence in the 
murders of Jose Menendez and his wife, Kitty. 
</P>
<P>
Albracht tentatively rejected making public an audiotape of an emergency 911 
telephone call made to police last Aug. 20, when the Menendez couple was found 
slain in their Beverly Hills mansion. 
</P>
<P>
He said he would reconsider his decision next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also rebuffed attempts by the networks to gain video and audiotapes 
made during the seizure of evidence in a Beverly Hills psychologist's office, 
and information dealing with the purchase of two shotguns that are believed by 
police to be the possible murder weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Albracht has ordered the county coroner to make public autopsy reports on the 
slain couple. On Thursday, on a motion by the Los Angeles Daily Journal 
newspaper, he ordered the coroner to make public investigative and 
toxicological reports as well.

FREE MEASLES VACCINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County residents can receive free measles vaccinations Saturday at 
any of 18 clinics set up by the Los Angeles County Medical Assn. in an effort 
to stop the spread of the area's worst measles epidemic since the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, seven Los Angeles County residents have died and 2,650 cases 
of measles have been reported, compared to 1,202 cases in all of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of these cases were among preschool children, 70% of them 
Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Children should be at least 1 year old and should have their immunization 
records with them. If these documents are not available, they will be provided 
at the site. Interpreters fluent in English and Spanish will be on hand. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteer doctors and nurses will be giving the vaccines between 11 a.m. and 3 
p.m. at the following immunization clinics:

BILL BOYARSKY: EXPLOITING PROP. 73 LOOPHOLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bill Boyarsky 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If this primary election illustrates anything, it's that money still dominates 
the political process, despite all the laws attempting to limit the corrupting 
influence of campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps you recall that in 1988, California voters approved something called 
Proposition 73, restricting contributions to $1,000 a donor. It was the latest 
of many political reform laws that have been enacted, amid high hopes, since 
the Watergate scandals. 
</P>
<P>
The new law imposed limits on every election in the state, from governor down 
to city council. This is important to Los Angeles County, where running for one 
of the five supervisorial seats in huge districts is often more expensive than 
many U.S. Senate campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, supervisorial campaigns are financed by businesses dependent 
on county regulation, mostly those involved with real estate development. 
Contributions of $5,000 or $10,000 from a single business were not unusual in 
the days before Proposition 73. Donations of that size come dangerously close 
to vote-buying, and Proposition 73 was supposed to eliminate that evil. 
</P>
<P>
Despite good intentions, all the laws have had weaknesses. Watching the current 
county supervisorial election, the loopholes in the latest effort become 
obvious. 
</P>
<P>
For example, hotshot lobbyist Arthur K. Snyder, a former Los Angeles city 
councilman, threw a fund-raiser for Sarah Flores, who's running for the 1st 
District seat of retiring Supervisor Pete Schabarum. The district covers the 
San Gabriel Valley and southeastern Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder is a power. His experience, knowledge of intricate government procedures 
and friendships with well-placed city officials have helped him win approval 
for big projects. Money also helps -- not his, especially, but money he raises. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his clout, fellow lobbyists and developers don't like to cross him. 
They fear a vengeful Snyder putting roadblocks in the way of their 
developments. That adds up to a high acceptance rate when Snyder sends out 
invitations to fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
It certainly helped the Flores campaign. Flores' campaign manager, Ron Smith, 
told me the event brought in $7,000. If Flores wins, Snyder will be remembered 
in her camp as the man who came up with $7,000 when it was needed. While 
Proposition 73 limited Snyder to $1,000, he gets credit for seven times as 
much. That's quite a loophole. 
</P>
<P>
Another demonstration of how large contributions can be assembled by a single 
person despite the laws came Wednesday night in an unlikely place -- the 
corporate headquarters of In-N-Out Burger in Baldwin Park, in the industrial 
heart of the San Gabriel Valley. It was the scene of a $500-a-person 
fund-raiser for Superior Court Judge Greg O'Brien, probably the best-financed 
candidate in the 1st District race and Flores' main rival. 
</P>
<P>
The host, Rich Snyder, president of In-N-Out Burger, provided the meal -- the 
house specialty, naturally, along with salads and desserts. The political punch 
was provided by Supervisor Schabarum. Both get credit for this one. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum is supporting O'Brien. Members of the Schabarum political team are 
working on the O'Brien campaign. Most important, Schabarum is raising money for 
O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisor is a prodigious political fund-raiser. His fund-raising pool is 
full of people doing business with the county in one way or another. While 
reports for the current campaign will not be available until next week, I think 
it's safe to assume that he's soliciting money from that familiar pool. 
</P>
<P>
You might make the same assumption about Flores' supervisorial supporters, Dana 
and Antonovich, both of whom are rounding up financial support for her 
campaign. Their contribution lists also are loaded with names of people 
dependent on the County Hall of Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The temptation for candidates to push hard for contributions is tremendous. The 
best way to communicate with voters is through mailed advertising. And that's 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Smith, Flores' campaign manager, said it costs $100,000 for a single 
mailing. O'Brien has already sent out two. Former Rep. Jim Lloyd, the third 
strong candidate, is in danger of being left behind because he can't match 
O'Brien and Flores in fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
I know many of the contributors simply think O'Brien, Flores or another 
candidate is best for the job. That's why they give. I talked to several such 
people at the O'Brien fund-raiser. But the rest, unfortunately, have been drawn 
into it by the high-pressure political strong-arm tactics that have been left 
untouched by political reform laws.

OFFICIAL IN L.A. IS NO DEFECTOR, CHINA SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reports that China's former top representative in Hong Kong is seeking 
political asylum in the United States were discounted Thursday by the Chinese 
government, which depicted Xu Jiatun's sojourn as simply a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
China's declaration concerning Xu, who is believed to be in the Los Angeles 
area, contrasted sharply with press accounts that he is eager to defect because 
of continuing pressure over his sympathy toward the pro-democracy movement that 
was crushed in the bloody military crackdown on student protesters at Tian An 
Men Square last June. 
</P>
<P>
Xu, as bureau chief of the Beijing-controlled New China News Agency in Hong 
Kong, had been China's de facto ambassador to the British colony from 1983 to 
last January. If reports of his defection prove true, he would be one of the 
most senior Communist Party members to defect since the party's rise to power 
in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
Xu was believed to be staying with a Hong Kong businessman in the Los Angeles 
area. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher on Wednesday would neither confirm 
nor deny knowledge of Xu's intentions, in conformance with a long-standing 
policy of secrecy concerning the asylum process. Boucher confirmed that Xu had 
been issued a tourist visa and "our understanding is that he is now visiting 
the United States." 
</P>
<P>
One U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: "I don't really 
think he wants to be tracked down. I don't think he wants to talk to the press. 
I think he wants to be quiet." 
</P>
<P>
China's official statements Thursday represented its first reaction regarding 
Xu since speculation about his intentions began circulating earlier this week. 
"Xu Jiatun is in the United States for travel and a rest," a Foreign Ministry 
spokeswoman told reporters. She declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
However, a Japanese newspaper, the Yomiuri Shimbun, on Wednesday quoted Xu, 74, 
as saying that he left China because of continuing pressure from Communist 
Party officials over his opposition to the use of force against student 
demonstrators last June than left about 800 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
Xu was also quoted as objecting to government interference with his authority 
over two Communist Party-controlled newspapers in Hong Kong, Wen Wei Pao and Ta 
Kung Pao. After Xu left for the United States, several of his colleagues in the 
Hong Kong news bureau were recalled to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Xu, known for his fondness for Western lifestyle and customs, applied for and 
received a tourist visa to the United State in Hong Kong rather than Beijing -- 
an action considered highly unusual for a member of the Communist Party. Some 
reports suggested that several family members, as few as three and as many as 
10, are traveling with him. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese newspaper quoted Xu as saying that Premier Li Peng's government 
was preparing a political reprimand against him for his praise of capitalism 
and his close ties to former party chief Zhao Ziyang. Zhao was dismissed from 
his post last June and accused of several transgressions, including support for 
student protesters.

TWO BROTHERS HELD IN KILLING OF NEIGHBORS; 
</P>
<P>
VIOLENCE: MAN AND WOMAN WERE SLAIN AFTER THE SUSPECTS HAD ARGUED WITH THEM OVER 
LOUD MUSIC, POLICE SAID.

Two brothers were arrested after an argument with two neighbors over loud music 
turned violent and one of the brothers opened fire with a handgun, killing the 
neighbors and wounding the apartment building manager, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
After the shooting Wednesday, Duc Minh Lien, 36, and his brother, Phuoc Quang 
Lien, 28, barricaded themselves in their north Long Beach apartment in the 6300 
block of Paramount Boulevard -- one of them for nearly eight hours, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Duc Minh Lien surrendered after police fired tear gas into the dwelling. His 
brother remained in the apartment for another hour, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the shooting occurred after the brothers argued with their upstairs 
neighbors over loud music. The brothers had attempted to get Barajas Gregorio, 
29, and Patricia Venegas, 23, to turn their music down, Long Beach Detective 
Roy Hamand said. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers had argued with the neighbors over loud music before, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a longstanding feud. . . . It came to a head, " homicide Detective 
Larry Stoops said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before Wednesday's shooting, which occurred at 5:12 p.m., Duc Minh Lien 
"had banged on the ceiling for them to shut it down," Hamand said. 
</P>
<P>
Gregorio left his apartment and he and the brothers got into an argument about 
the music outside of the ground-floor apartment of building manager Joseph 
Miller, police said. The shooting followed that argument, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Venegas was shot when she too went downstairs and said Miller was 
shot when he went to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
Duc Minh Lien allegedly fired numerous shots at the three with a .38-caliber 
handgun, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, 64, was listed in serious condition at Long Beach Memorial Hospital 
after undergoing surgery. He was shot three times in the stomach, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The 1-month-old daughter of Gregorio and Venegas was turned over to the county 
Department of Children Services. The girl was unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
After the shooting, the brothers barricaded themselves inside their home, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
A special weapons team was called to the scene and, after attempts to talk the 
two men into surrendering failed, police fired tear gas into the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Duc Minh Lien gave up at 11:50 p.m. Phuoc Quang Lien surrendered at 1 a.m. 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Both men were arrested on two counts each of murder and one count of assault 
with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the brothers had lived at the residence for more than 13 years.

THE ART OF HOLDING A MEETING; 
</P>
<P>
EMMYS: TELECASTS OF THE LOS ANGELES SCHOOL BOARD'S SESSIONS ARE IN THE RUNNING 
FOR ONE OF THE AWARDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It's local Emmy Award night in Los Angeles. The best and the brightest of 
Southland-produced television have gathered to accept their peers' accolades. 
And rubbing shoulders with programs like Channel 7's "First International 
Stuntman Competition" and Channel 5's "Rose Parade Countdown" is the decidedly 
non-dramatic series about the Los Angeles Board of Education. It's no joke. The 
school board meetings, televised on the district's own cable television station 
for the last two years, are one of two nominees for best local public affairs 
show shot outside of a studio. The other competitor is consumer advocate David 
Horowitz's show, "Fight Back." 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be less than honest if I said I expected to get this nomination, what with 
all the networks and things in this city," admits Robert V. Greene, who 
produces the weekly show for the Los Angeles Unified School District's 
television station, KLCS. 
</P>
<P>
The Emmys will be presented Saturday night at a private ceremony at the 
Pasadena Civic Auditorium, which is also the site of the televised national 
Emmy Awards ceremony in September. 
</P>
<P>
Up for consideration are 220 locally produced television shows, nominated in 51 
categories and judged by panels from local stations across the country. The 
hourlong montage of school board meeting footage was reviewed by a crew from a 
Detroit news station, which narrowed the field of submissions in its category 
-- from three to two. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to compare us to 'Fight Back,"' said Greene. "It's apples and 
oranges. It's whether we're going to look at which Ziploc bags work better or 
who gets eliminated from the budget." 
</P>
<P>
KLCS has won local Emmys before, mostly for its instructional programs, which 
are shown in classrooms. But this is the first time that the station has been 
nominated for its meeting coverage. 
</P>
<P>
It was during her term as president that board member Roberta Weintraub -- a 
veteran of television talk shows -- decreed that meetings should be broadcast, 
giving outsiders a peek into how the nation's second-largest school district 
conducts its business. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the biggest criticisms of the board had been that we were inaccessible 
to the public," Weintraub said. "We wanted to let the public really be a part 
of what was happening." 
</P>
<P>
No rating service keeps tabs on how many people tune in the taped programs, 
shown on KLCS at 9 p.m. each Monday, then replayed Sunday afternoons at 3. But 
a one-time check by the station showed that 125,000 people watch it at any one 
time, and the board meetings are among its most popular shows, Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always amazed at the number of people who say 'I've seen that' when they 
find out what I do for a living," he said. While the telecasts draw large 
numbers of parents and teachers, "we're probably discovered by people just 
flipping channels more than anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Viewers have a lot of time to flip. The typical board meeting can last six or 
seven hours. The taped presentation often lasts until 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Our meetings are definitely a lot longer now," Weintraub said. "We used to 
just go through the reports, bang, bang, bang. Now, we take the time to explain 
(to the viewers) what we're voting on and what the programs involve." 
</P>
<P>
Each board member now seems compelled to look directly into the camera and make 
a speech about almost every issue up for a vote -- speeches that became so long 
that the board earlier this year voted to restrict the time each member could 
speak to five minutes per turn and is now considering a motion to limit board 
meetings to five hours. 
</P>
<P>
"We all know we're on television, and if you don't make a statement, you worry 
that you look like 'What are you doing there?' " Weintraub said. "We're 
political, and we use it as a tool. But I'd hate to go back to the days when we 
did our business in the dark."

BLYLEVEN CAN SHARE BLAME IN 6-3 LOSS

<P>
The offense he criticized so scathingly last Saturday provided him with an 
early lead and later got him off the hook, so Bert Blyleven could not complain 
about lack of support Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Nor did he utter a peep about his teammates' failures, focusing instead on his 
own efforts in the Angels' 6-3 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to have one pitch back, but what can you do?" Blyleven said, 
referring to Greg Vaughn's three-run homer in the second inning. "You keep 
going out there and battling and try to turn it around. You just try to be 
consistent, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven did not pitch badly over six innings, walking three, striking out five 
and yielding only the runs on Vaughn's third home run of the season. Angel 
Manager Doug Rader had found fault with the location of some of Blyleven's 
pitches after the 39-year-old right-hander tired in his last outing, but Rader 
saw little that displeased him Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"Bert threw one poor pitch and unfortunately that led to a three-run home run," 
Rader said. "I thought he pitched extremely well. We just didn't put anything 
together. We didn't get it done in the first inning, when we had to get it 
done. We got the bases loaded in the first inning with no one out and only got 
one run." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels appeared ready to back Blyleven heartily in the first after singles 
by Luis Polonia and Max Venable and a walk to Wally Joyner, but the threat 
fizzled when Chili Davis struck out, Dante Bichette forced Joyner at second -- 
scoring Polonia -- and Johnny Ray popped to short. 
</P>
<P>
After Vaughn had powered what Blyleven called "a major league hanging 
curveball" into the left-field seats with two out in the second inning, the 
Angels countered in the third on a double by Joyner and a single by Davis to 
cut the lead to one run. They tied the score, 3-3, in the sixth inning on a 
walk, an error by Vaughn and a single by Lance Parrish. 
</P>
<P>
But Willie Fraser, in his first appearance since his recall from triple-A 
Edmonton on Monday, couldn't hold Milwaukee in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers scored three times on four hits, none of which could have been 
mistaken for a blast, burdening Fraser with his second loss in as many 
decisions and handing the Angels their sixth loss in eight games and 20th in 
28. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Molitor, Gary Sheffield, Robin Yount and Dave Parker singled in succession 
for two runs, then Greg Brock drove in Yount with the final run on a sacrifice 
fly. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought (Fraser) threw better than when he left," Rader said. "He gave up 
one broken-bat hit, one jammed base hit, then one legitimate hit. I thought he 
threw pretty well, much better than how it all came out." 
</P>
<P>
That it came out a loss left Fraser frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're going the way I'm going right now, that's the way it's going to 
happen," said Fraser, who had been optioned to Edmonton on April 30 for three 
starts and came back with a split-finger fastball to replace his ineffective 
forkball. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a few good pitches and a few bad. I just basically didn't get the job 
done. I had a chance to get a win and we lost. That's the only thing that 
bothers me. 
</P>
<P>
"The pitch Yount hit was breaking down pretty good. The pitch to Sheffield was 
up. Parker hit a ground ball that just found a hole. That's the way it goes 
when you're struggling." 
</P>
<P>
That is precisely what the Angels are doing. They had a chance to take the lead 
in the seventh when Kent Anderson led off with a double, but he had to hold 
when Polonia grounded out. He tagged on Brian Downing's fly to right but was 
stranded when Joyner grounded out to second. 
</P>
<P>
"We had our chances to go ahead," Joyner said. "We just need to keep going out 
there and playing well. We'll have our opportunity and we'll start turning it 
around." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Infielder Mark McLemore was put on the 15-day disabled list Thursday because of 
a sprained right wrist and suspected break in his navicular bone, the bone 
between the thumb and the wrist. He injured it in the fifth inning Wednesday, 
when he fell while rounding first on a double. X-rays taken here were 
inconclusive and he returned to California for further examination. 
</P>
<P>
Center fielder Devon White was scratched from the starting lineup because of a 
sore left thumb. He came in as a defensive replacement in the seventh. . . . 
Pitcher Jim Abbott watched tapes of his 1 1/3-inning, four-walk performance 
Wednesday with pitching coach Marcel Lachemann and said they had found some 
mechanical flaws that might explain his woes.

BIG WEST MOVES BASKETBALL FINAL FROM NCAA CONFLICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Long Beach was left out of the NCAA basketball tournament two months 
ago because it couldn't beat Nevada Las Vegas, which won the national 
championship by 30 points over Duke in the NCAA final. 
</P>
<P>
Determined to prevent its teams from being caught again in a time conflict 
between the televised NCAA tournament program and the conference's televised 
title game, the 10-team Big West Conference decided Thursday at Santa Barbara 
to cut its men's and women's tournaments to eight teams and restructure the 
tournament so that the men's championship game will be over before the 
televised selection program begins. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach learned at halftime of the Sunday afternoon tournament final in 
March that the NCAA selection committee had announced it would be invited only 
if it beat UNLV to win the automatic Big West berth. The 49ers lost, 92-74. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Haney, Big West Conference commissioner, said the NCAA has not given the 
Big West assurances that it would not be penalized again for the lateness of 
its title game. 
</P>
<P>
The Big West title game began at 3 p.m. on a Sunday last season, conflicting 
with the 3:30 p.m. selection show. Haney said the final is tentatively set for 
1 p.m. next season. 
</P>
<P>
But Seth Greenberg, then an assistant and now head coach of the Long Beach team 
that was left out, said he is not convinced the change will make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't think when that final game is played has an effect of the 
selection process," said Greenberg, who replaced Joe Harrington, now coach at 
Colorado. "By that time, they pretty much know who's in and who isn't. But it's 
nice they moved it. It takes one less cop-out away from the NCAA committee. The 
bottom line is the people on the committee have to decide whether the Big West 
merits four teams."

GRETZKY'S SHADOW FOLLOWING JANNEY NOW; 
</P>
<P>
NHL PLAYOFFS: TIKKANEN, ILLNESS DOGGED BRUIN IN TRIPLE-OVERTIME LOSS TO OILERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>

BOSTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Craig Janney finally found someplace to hide from Esa Tikkanen early Wednesday 
morning -- a hospital bed. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the way the Edmonton Oiler wing shadowed the Boston Bruin center 
throughout Game 1 of the Stanley Cup finals Tuesday, Janney could almost 
imagine Tikkanen showing up as a volunteer nurse. 
</P>
<P>
Janney was sent to Massachusetts General Hospital, suffering from dehydration, 
after playing in the longest game in the finals, a 115-minute 13-second, 
three-overtime marathon won by Edmonton, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
His problems, though, began before he arrived at Boston Garden. Already hit 
with stomach flu, he had a 100-degree fever when he stepped onto the ice in the 
hot, humid arena. 
</P>
<P>
"With the length of the game, I just kept losing fluids," he said. "Between the 
second and third overtime, my whole body cramped up and I just couldn't go on. 
I didn't have anything left. I've never been in such pain. I just wanted to 
survive." 
</P>
<P>
He did, thanks to the overnight hospital stay and intravenous fluid. 
</P>
<P>
Janney was back on the ice to practice Thursday and expects to play tonight in 
Game 2 at the Garden. 
</P>
<P>
So much for the pain in his stomach. The pain in the neck won't be so easy to 
shake. 
</P>
<P>
Tikkanen is merely doing what he does best, what he did to Wayne Gretzky in the 
second-round series against the Kings and Denis Savard in the third round 
against the Chicago Blackhawks. Tikkanen is assigned to the key man in the 
opposing offense and told to disrupt him and, thus, the opposing team's game 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the Bruins, that would be Janney, the center who often fed Cam 
Neely on his way to a team-high 55 goals. 
</P>
<P>
With Tikkanen on the job Tuesday, it was left to defenseman Ray Bourque to 
score both Boston goals. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had anything like that," Janney said. "It just seemed wherever I 
turned, (Tikkanen) was just right in my face the whole game. It was hard to 
breathe, he was so close to me. I didn't really touch the puck all night." 
</P>
<P>
At one point, in desperation, Janney faked as if he were coming off. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to see if it would work," he said. "I went toward the bench and 
screamed, 'Change! Change!' He looked to his bench. Then, I cut away and was 
open for a second, but nobody saw me. 
</P>
<P>
"The next time, he waited until I crossed the boards. He said, 'That's not 
going to work this time, son.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hockey Notes 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, Edmonton announced the signing of defenseman Craig Muni to a two-year 
contract, the second season being an option year. Muni, 27, a former 
first-round draft pick of the Toronto Maple Leafs, joined the Oilers four years 
ago as a free agent and has played on their last two Stanley Cup winners. 
</P>
<P>
Leftovers from Tuesday night's Boston marathon: The longest previous Stanley 
Cup game was played in 1931 in Montreal between the Canadiens and the Chicago 
Blackhawks, with the game-winner scored by Cy Wentworth 13 minutes 50 seconds 
into the third overtime. . . . Tuesday's game was the ninth longest in NHL 
history, No. 1 being a 1936 game between the Detroit Red Wings and Montreal 
Maroons, won by Detroit, 1-0, at the 16:30 mark of the sixth overtime. The Red 
Wings' Moderre (Mud) Bruneteau scored the only goal. 
</P>
<P>
Boston out-shot Edmonton Tuesday night, 52-31, including 22-15 in the 
overtimes. . . . After tonight, the scene shifts to Edmonton for Game 3 Sunday 
and Game 4 Tuesday.

TV-RADIO: ABDUL-JABBAR JOINS NEW TEAM, MAKES IT TO NBA FINALS AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ready for the announcing team of Keith Olbermann and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar? 
</P>
<P>
It's coming your way during the NBA finals. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar will join Olbermann in the Channel 2 studios for postgame shows 
during the championship series. Question: Will it be "The Keith and Kareem 
Show" . . . or (deep breath) "The Olbermann and Abdul-Jabbar Show"? 
</P>
<P>
The retired Laker center may not be as loquacious as Dodger Manager Tom 
Lasorda, who hooked up with Channel 4's Fred Roggin during the 1988 World 
Series, and then again after the 1989 Super Bowl. But Olbermann is optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"Who else knows more about basketball -- or life, for that matter -- than 
Kareem?" said Olbermann, who added that he will treat Abdul-Jabbar more as a 
co-host than as a guest analyst. 
</P>
<P>
One thing this gig will do for Abdul-Jabbar is give him some needed on-air 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping he'll be good enough so that we can send a tape to NBC," said 
Leonard Armato, Abdul-Jabbar's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar has expressed interest in being part of NBC's NBA coverage next 
season, preferably as a host or feature reporter. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope we can find a spot for him," said Terry O'Neil, executive producer of 
NBC Sports. 
</P>
<P>
The "Today" show has gained a co-host, but SportsChannel hasn't totally lost an 
Angel commentator. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning June 4, Joe Garagiola will join Bryant Gumbel, Deborah Norville and 
crew on "Today" three days a week -- Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, he will work Angel SportsChannel telecasts on May 23, 25 and 30. 
After that, he will work weekend telecasts when possible, said Lynn Woodard, 
SportsChannel L.A. general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Garagiola said he will continue to live in Paradise Valley, Ariz., near 
Scottsdale, and commute to New York and Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Garagiola said the seed was planted for his return to NBC when he made a 
fill-in appearance on "Today" in January. 
</P>
<P>
"Bryant and Gene Shallit kidded me about coming back and making other 
appearances," Garagiola said. "Shallit suggested once a month. I told him he 
could be my agent. I guess he did a pretty good job." 
</P>
<P>
Television's penchant for showing oddball events never seems to subside. The 
other day came news of a one-on-one basketball tournament for pay-per-view, 
planned for June 25. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes word of a golf event pitting Greg Norman against Wayne Gretzky, Ivan 
Lendl and Larry Bird, which actually might be pretty interesting. 
</P>
<P>
The "Norman Challenge," as it's being called, will be held July 14-15 in 
Rogers, Ark. Trans World International will produce it for CBS. 
</P>
<P>
Nine holes will be shown the first day, nine more the second. The three-man 
team will play a scramble -- or best-ball -- format. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' final TV appearance of the season Tuesday night drew a record Los 
Angeles Nielsen cable rating, Prime Ticket reporting a 30.1. 
</P>
<P>
The loss to Phoenix was seen in 626,300 households, almost one-third of L.A.'s 
cable TV households. The overall rating for all TV households was 15.1. 
</P>
<P>
Add ratings: Rick Feldman, Channel 13 station manager, said the 5.7 overall 
Nielsen rating that Prime Ticket reported for the Kings' double-overtime 
victory over Calgary on April 21 was incorrect. Feldman said the rating was 
actually 4.1. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Ticket admitted the mistake, saying it was a communication error. The 
peak rating was a 5.7, the average a 4.1. 
</P>
<P>
Merlin Olsen could be the next sportscaster to change networks, going from NBC 
to CBS. 
</P>
<P>
NBC has given Olsen permission to look elsewhere, and he said he has talked 
with CBS. 
</P>
<P>
Look for NBC to name one or two new football commentators soon. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Nathanson, longtime football director for NBC, was hired by SportsChannel 
to work the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
All that happened in Nathanson's first telecast was a three-overtime game that 
was delayed during the third overtime by a power outage. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the telecast lasted six hours. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome aboard, Ted. 
</P>
<P>
In a series beginning this weekend called "Athletes in Rehab," FNN Sports will 
take a look at athletes who have experienced drug-abuse problems. 
</P>
<P>
During the next seven weeks, 2 1/2-minute segments will be shown during FNN's 
weekend "Final Score" programs, from 7 p.m. to midnight. 
</P>
<P>
Sportscaster Wayne Root has traveled the country for interviews. The series 
will conclude with a one-hour special in early July. 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
How about a team of Brent Musburger and Jim Valvano? ABC, Musburger's new 
employer, reportedly is interested in Valvano as a college basketball 
commentator. . . . Attention, boxing fans: HBO has what should be a good fight 
Saturday at 7 p.m. -- Pernell Whitaker vs. Azumah Nelson. . . . Showtime will 
televise the June 1 fight between Evander Holyfield and Seamus McDonough. . . . 
NBC has added another edition of the "Greatest Fights Ever" series. On July 28, 
the network will show a tape of the 1971 Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier fight, their 
first. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 11 weekend sportscaster Tom Nettles, a cousin of former major leaguer 
Graig Nettles, has apparently left the station in a contract dispute. Greg 
Wyatt and Joe Buttitta have been filling in. . . . The NFL's Fastest-Man 
competition is being held Saturday at the College of the Desert in Palm Desert 
and will be televised by NBC on Aug. 5 
</P>
<P>
Prime Ticket has taken some heat in Phoenix for so-called biased coverage in 
its follow-up reports of the baseball brawl between USC and Arizona State on 
April 14. The network will respond on "It's Your Call" Wednesday at 6 p.m.

U.S. TEAM DRAWS A CROWD IN NEW YORK; 
</P>
<P>
WORLD CUP: AMERICAN SOCCER BEING WHAT IT IS, SEND-OFF FOR ITALY REALLY ISN'T 
OVERWHELMING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. soccer team stopped traffic here Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it was New York's finest who stopped traffic so photographers could 
take pictures of the U.S. players under the World Cup flags that were streamed 
from one side of Mulberry Street to the other. 
</P>
<P>
Being New Yorkers, the drivers who had their miserable, expletive-deleted, 
cross-town journeys interrupted for a bunch of soccer players reacted in the 
congenial, laid-back fashion that has made them loved and admired the world 
over. 
</P>
<P>
"What the hell is this all about?" inquired one driver who was not honking his 
horn. 
</P>
<P>
He obviously was not a civic-minded citizen or he would have known that New 
York Mayor David Dinkins had proclaimed Thursday as "U.S. National Team World 
Cup Day." 
</P>
<P>
Dinkins took time out from dealing with the racial tension that threatens to 
engulf his city in a genuine "Bonfire of the Vanities" to attend a send-off 
luncheon at a restaurant in Little Italy for the U.S. team that will begin 
World Cup play next month in Big Italy. 
</P>
<P>
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and President George Bush were not there, but they 
sent telegrams. 
</P>
<P>
O.J. Simpson, Marcus Allen and Kathy Lee Crosby were not there, either. But 
they appeared with some of the players on a rap video that was filmed in 
Malibu. It was produced by Shelli Azoff of Beverly Hills and midfielder Paul 
Caligiuri of Santa Monica, the hero of last November's 1-0 victory over 
Trinidad and Tobago that put the United States into the World Cup for the first 
time in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Togetherness and unity 
</P>
<P>
 "Mean victory in Italy." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the real rap began. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the team has showed significant improvement in recent exhibitions, 
winning two of its last three games and tying the other, Werner Fricker, 
president of the U.S. Soccer Federation, said: "Needless to say, I am pleased 
with the team's performance to date." 
</P>
<P>
But then he chose to bring some of the ominous rain clouds that were hovering 
outside into the restaurant with him. 
</P>
<P>
"You ask me if I'm satisfied with the players," Fricker said. "Absolutely not. 
They can do better. You ask me if I'm satisfied with the coach and the support 
staff. The answer is the same. Absolutely not. They can do better." 
</P>
<P>
Asked later if he meant to be that blunt at a function that was, essentially, a 
pep rally, he said: "I don't make it a practice to make statements I don't 
mean. Some people don't appreciate my straightforwardness. 
</P>
<P>
"If I see people with the God-given talent to perform superior to what they are 
performing, I expect more. I firmly believe they haven't played up to their 
maximum. But I think they will at the World Cup. They have progressed very 
methodically, at the right pace. The coach (Bob Gansler) has timed it 
correctly." 
</P>
<P>
Fricker stood behind his prediction of a month ago that the United States will 
fare well enough in the first round against Italy, Czechoslovakia and Austria 
to advance to the second round. 
</P>
<P>
"I believed it then, and I believe it now," he said. "Qualifying for the World 
Cup was not a dream. That was a job, a task, an opportunity, a goal, and we 
wanted to achieve that. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, playing well in the first three games and going to the second round, 
that's not a dream. That's another task." 
</P>
<P>
As Adidas picked up the check, the athletic apparel manufacturer used the 
occasion to unveil the white-with-blue-trim uniforms that the U.S. team will 
wear in Italy. It seemed like the right time to ask Fricker about the 
oft-repeated story that he will not allow the U.S. team to wear red because of 
his staunch anti-Communist, anti-Soviet sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
Fricker said he has heard that story so often that he is rarely amused by it 
any more. 
</P>
<P>
"I played most of my lifetime as a soccer player in a red jersey with black 
shorts for a German-Hungarian team outside Philadelphia," he said. "I have 
nothing against red. It's part of our national flag. 
</P>
<P>
"I like all white or all blue or all red because it makes the players' numbers 
easier to identify. Canada wears all red. My preference is all white because we 
play a lot of games in warm and humid conditions, and white is better for the 
players. 
</P>
<P>
"People who want to embarrass me spread that story to the media. I have a pair 
of shorts that I wear around the pool that are red with white stripes." 
</P>
<P>
One person who might like to embarrass Fricker is his federation rival, Paul 
Stiehl, who wants to be the next president. But he was at Thursday's send-off 
to support the team. So was Ricky Davis, the former U.S. captain who has been 
critical of Gansler for not giving him a chance to play for the World Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not happy with the federation," said Davis, who will be going to Italy as 
a television commentator, "but most of the players are my friends. I wish them 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Togetherness and unity. 
</P>
<P>
When the party ended, the players were surprised to see a large group of 
celebrity-seekers gathered outside the restaurant. No one had the heart to tell 
them that most of the gawkers were there to see the filming in the next block 
of "The Godfather III."

KEY FOR KINGDOM IS MORE OLYMPIC GOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A two-time gold medalist and world record-holder in the high hurdles, Roger 
Kingdom says his goal is to win again in the 110-meter event at the 1992 
Olympic Games in Barcelona, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
If he does, he would become the first high hurdler to win three Olympic titles. 
</P>
<P>
Only Kingdom (1984, 1988) and Lee Calhoun (1956, 1960) have won consecutive 
gold medals in the technical and demanding event. 
</P>
<P>
Kingdom, 27, has talked about concentrating on the decathlon, but has revised 
his priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm backing off that now," he said. "People have helped me to realize what 
goals I would be sacrificing financially and the pride of achieving something 
historically." 
</P>
<P>
Kingdom, who will compete in the Jack in the Box Invitational track meet Sunday 
at UCLA's Drake Stadium, had an exceptional season last year. He broke Renaldo 
Nehemiah's world record of 12.93 seconds with a time of 12.92 in Zurich, 
Switzerland, and was recognized by Track &amp; Field News as the 1989 male 
athlete of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to retain my position as the top-ranked hurdler through 1993," Kingdom 
said. "I'm not trying to boast, but anyone coming after me better be ready to 
run in the high 12s or 13 zeroes." 
</P>
<P>
Kingdom will be confronted with a relatively new challenger this year -- Tony 
Dees. 
</P>
<P>
Dees, 26, is a late bloomer who has divided his time between sprinting and 
hurdling. He was unranked in the hurdles in 1989, but is coming on with a 
13.09-second wind-aided performance in the recent Modesto Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
"That 13.09 inspired me," Kingdom said. "Now we have some more competition in 
the U.S. So let's go." 
</P>
<P>
Kingdom, 6 feet and 200 pounds, attacks the hurdles, in contrast to smooth 
stylists such as Tonie Campbell and Nehemiah. 
</P>
<P>
"I would describe my style as being very unique and aggressive," Kingdom said. 
"It's not the textbook style of hurdling. I started playing with the hurdles, 
trying to get over them the quickest, most relaxed and comfortable way as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
"So I put my lead leg down off the hurdle quickly while pulling my trail leg 
through. Sometimes it looks as if I'm twisted sideways, but I keep my hip 
rotation all the way down the track, and that makes it easier for my legs to go 
properly over the hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes when you're square going over the hurdles, you have to work your 
trail leg extra hard. If you're already rotating, it's something you don't have 
to think about." 
</P>
<P>
Kingdom said that Nehemiah was his idol when he was a freshman at the 
University of Pittsburgh in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Nehemiah left track to pursue a brief career with the San Francisco 49ers 
of the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
He has returned to track and has had some creditable performances. But he 
doesn't dominate the event as he once did. 
</P>
<P>
"I talk with him a lot, try to boost him up," Kingdom said, "and he gives me 
some pointers. 
</P>
<P>
"I really admire him. He's a helluva athlete. If he stays motivated, he'll be 
back to the 13.1s. You can bet I'll be talking trash to him to get him 
motivated." 
</P>
<P>
Kingdom, who will be making his 1990 outdoor debut Sunday, is bothered by 
allergies. 
</P>
<P>
"As I'm talking to you now, I can hardly breathe and my eyes are watering," he 
said. "With my colleagues, Larry Myricks and Greg Foster, being suspended, I 
have to suffer now because there isn't a thing in the world I can take now." 
</P>
<P>
Myricks was suspended for three months by The Athletics Congress for taking a 
cold medicine containing a banned substance. Foster has a similar suspension 
because of a banned substance contained in some vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
"Taking a cold medicine as a stimulant is ridiculous because you'd have to 
(overdose) to get enough in your system," Kingdom said. "If you take that much, 
it will work against you because you don't have control over your body. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember that I once OD'd on cough syrup. I had no control over my body. The 
problem is that a lot of stuff that TAC suggests you take just doesn't work 
because they don't have anything (relieving medication) in them." 
</P>
<P>
For TAC, it's now the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Huffman is the latest member of the United States' 19-foot club in the 
pole vault. He cleared that height in the Modesto Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
It was an orthodox vault for Huffman, a former Kansas vaulter, meaning that 
both legs went over the bar at the same time. But that isn't the way he usually 
clears heights. 
</P>
<P>
Huffman squirms over the bar with what he calls the Western roll, an old 
high-jumping technique. 
</P>
<P>
"I call it 'Huffing the bar,' " he said. "What triggers it is to get any part 
of your body over as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, a vaulter goes up to the bar with with both feet straight up. Only 
my right foot goes straight up. I drop my left leg until it's almost vertical. 
</P>
<P>
"My right leg goes entirely over the bar, and my left leg is completely under 
and behind the bar. If I were to keep going that way, I would take the bar off 
between my legs. 
</P>
<P>
"My left leg is the last thing to clear the bar. I'm now straddling the bar at 
which time I'm doing a roll, and then I do a 360-degree spin on the way down." 
</P>
<P>
The decision as to whether to "Huff" the bar or cross it more conventionally is 
made as he goes up. 
</P>
<P>
Huffman, who won the pole vault with a then career-best jump of 18-8 1/4 last 
February at the Times/Eagle Indoor Games at the Forum, said his high-jump form 
while pole vaulting developed naturally for him. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I did it was in my freshman year at the Big Eight outdoor 
meet," said Huffman, who will compete Sunday at Drake Stadium. "I made 18-5 
1/2, which was a national freshman record. And I said to myself, 'My goodness. 
What did I just do?' 
</P>
<P>
"Other vaulters have said they've tried it and don't see how I do it. I don't 
think it's anything you can work on." 
</P>
<P>
Track Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific 10 track and field meet begins Saturday at the University of 
Washington. At the outset of the season, the UCLA men's team, which has won the 
Pac-10 title the past three years, was favored to win again. However, numerous 
injuries have reduced the Bruins to underdogs. In a poll of conference track 
coaches, Oregon was the favored team. . . . The UCLA's women's team is favored 
to win its fourth consecutive Pac-10 title. 
</P>
<P>
Two-time Olympian Diana Richburg will not run her 800-meter specialty in the 
Jack in the Box meet because she suffered bruises when she was struck by a 
truck after a workout at the University of Florida Thursday. Correction from 
April 30 column: It was Jim Bailey, not Jim Beatty, who ran the first 
sub-4-minute mile in the United States.

NCAA WOMEN'S TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIP; 
</P>
<P>
STANFORD NO. 3 GRAHAM IS NO. 1 IN NATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Stanford's Debbie Graham wasn't second-fiddle in a season in which the Cardinal 
was 29-0 and national team champion. 
</P>
<P>
She was third-fiddle, behind No. 1 Meredith McGrath and reigning national 
singles champion Sandra Birch. 
</P>
<P>
But on Thursday, Graham, a graduate of Los Amigos High in Fountain Valley, 
finished the year No. 1 in the nation, defeating Nicole Arendt of Florida, 6-3, 
6-3, to win the NCAA Women's Tennis Championships at Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath lost in the tournament's second round, and Graham upset Birch in 
Wednesday's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Graham said her being overlooked was a motivating factor. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever anyone ever thinks about Stanford tennis, it's always Sandra and 
Meredith and I'm sitting at No. 3," Graham said. "I'm the No. 3 player in the 
middle and no one ever cares. I wanted to prove to everyone that Stanford is 
not just its one and two players." 
</P>
<P>
Graham did not lose a set during the tournament, but Arendt had a far more 
difficult route to the finals. She was extended to three sets in both Tuesday's 
quarterfinals and Wednesday's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"I was tired, but tried not to think about it," Arendt said. "I would say 
something carried over (from the semifinals)." 
</P>
<P>
Both players remained on serve until the eighth game, when Graham recorded the 
only service break of the first set. 
</P>
<P>
"The first set was so important for me to win," Graham said, "because I started 
off the match, and I don't remember a time where I've ever been so nervous. I 
was thinking about so many different things. I felt that she was really nervous 
in the beginning too." 
</P>
<P>
Graham, seeded sixth, broke Arendt in the first and third games of the second 
set taking a 4-0 lead.

LONGAKER COMES BACK STRONG; 
</P>
<P>
SOFTBALL: AFTER NEARLY QUITTING LAST SUMMER, UCLA PITCHER LEADS BRUINS IN 
NATIONAL TITLE HUNT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA's top-ranked women's softball team will begin its quest for a third 
consecutive national championship today at 3:30 p.m. against Northern Iowa in 
the first game of a best-of-three series at Sunset Field on campus. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins (55-6) have won 25 of their last 26 games, the loss coming to 
Arizona in the final game of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Starting for the Bruins will be senior pitcher Lisa Longaker, who was named 
Pacific 10 player of the year for the third time. Longaker was 18-1 with an 
earned-run average of 0.47. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited to play Northern Iowa," she said. "They are somebody new. We've 
always played other teams from Southern California in the first round of the 
playoffs, and this way we get to play somebody we haven't seen before." 
</P>
<P>
Longaker was heavily recruited at Mayfair High in Lakewood, and made an 
immediate impact with the Bruins. She won her first Pac-10 player-of-the-year 
award as a freshman, going 20-5 with 213 strikeouts and an ERA of 0.35. 
</P>
<P>
"We came so close when I was a freshman (losing in the tournament final to 
Texas A&amp;M)," she said. "Actually, I think that is what made my sophomore 
year so great." 
</P>
<P>
As a sophomore, Longaker was named the national player of the year when she was 
31-4 with an ERA of 0.30. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have to say that was my best year because I had so many games, and the 
pressure was on because one of our pitchers left school and another got 
mono(nucleosis) in midseason," Longaker said. "So the pressure was on and I 
reacted." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Bruins won a national championship again when she was a junior, 
Longaker struggled for he first time in her college career. She was 18-1, but 
her strikeouts slipped to 114, fewer than half her sophomore total. 
</P>
<P>
"I was struggling the whole year," she said. "I think it was a mechanical 
problem at first, and then I waited too long and it turned into a mental 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
Longaker uses five pitches, her best pitches being a riseball and a fastball 
that has been clocked at 65 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
According to Sharron Backus, the Bruins' coach, Longaker's strong suit is her 
control. 
</P>
<P>
"Lisa has a command of all the pitches," Backus said. "What distinguishes Lisa 
is her ability to put any of those five where she wants to." 
</P>
<P>
Longaker, whose father coached softball until last summer, began playing the 
game when she was 8. She started pitching when her family moved from Houston to 
Lakewood and, on the advice of a friend in the area, Longaker and her father 
went to see Ron Lefebvre, a pitching instructor in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"A girl who played for my dad in Houston played for Ron, so when she moved 
here, she told us to go see Ron if I wanted to pitch," Longaker said. "My dad 
was the one to catch me six days a week, and Ron was the one we went to one or 
two days to learn how to throw pitches. He would tell me what I was doing 
wrong, and Dad would pick up on it." 
</P>
<P>
Longaker chose not to seek Lefebvre's advice last season when she experienced 
trouble, deciding instead to live with it. Disappointed, she also decided to 
quit softball after the season. 
</P>
<P>
During the summer, her father, who had retired from coaching, had a change of 
heart, got a team together and asked his daughter if she would like to play. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you say no to your father?" she said. "I've never been able to do it." 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the summer, Longaker was pitching well again and shelved the 
retirement plans, for this season at least. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to retire after this summer," she said. "I'm going to play in the 
Olympic (Festival) and an international tournament in Illinois this summer, but 
then I'm going to retire." 
</P>
<P>
This season, Longaker pitched 11 shutouts, including a perfect game against 
Arizona State. Her only defeat was that 3-2 season-streak-ender against 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
"They were on fire," Longaker said of the Wildcats. "I would have had to (have) 
been extremely on to beat them." 
</P>
<P>
Now the task is to beat Northern Iowa, a team that seemingly has peaked at the 
right time. Northern Iowa won the Gateway Collegiate Athletic Conference 
tournament after being seeded ninth. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little more apprehensive than the kids," Backus said. "Any team that 
gets into the (tournament) had to be good to get there." 
</P>
<P>
The series will continue Saturday at 1 p.m. and if a third game is necessary, 
it will be played after the first game Saturday.

MILLER LEADS VETERANS IN GIRLS' FIELD

<P>
More than 1,500 high school athletes will compete today in the 78th annual 
Southern Section divisional track and field meet at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
The four-division meet, which includes both boys' and girls' competition, will 
begin at 3 p.m. with the field events. 
</P>
<P>
Track events start at 4. The top nine finishers in each event will qualify for 
next week's Masters' Meet. 
</P>
<P>
Sprinter Inger Miller of Pasadena Muir, the defending girls' 4-A Division 100- 
and 200-meter champion, heads the girls' competition, but 27 of the 60 events 
have returning champions. Miller, who will anchor the Mustangs' 400- and 
1,600-meter relay teams, is the force behind Muir's bid to repeat as 4-A 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' 3-A Division, freshman Marion Jones is expected to lead Oxnard 
Rio Mesa to its second consecutive championship. Jones, who set a divisional 
record of 11.66 seconds in the 100 meters in last week's preliminaries, is the 
leading qualifier in both the 100 and 200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the boys' competition will be the 1-A Division showdown between 
Coley Candaele of Carpinteria and Bryan Dameworth of Agoura, two of the top 
middle distance runners in the nation, in the 1,600 meters. 
</P>
<P>
The boys' 4-A Division 100 and 200 meters also will be competitive races with 
leading qualifiers Andre Green of Long Beach Poly, Tim Martin of San Clemente, 
John Thomas of San Bernardino, Kenneth Moore of Compton Dominguez and Chris 
Alexander of Hawthorne. LONNIE WHITE

MAD ABOUT THE MOVIES; 
</P>
<P>
PEOPLE IN MANY L.A. NEIGHBORHOODS ARE UP IN ARMS OVER THE INTRUSIONS OF FILM 
CREWS. A FEW ARE FIGURING OUT WAYS TO MAKE THE MOGULS PAY. 
</P>

<P>
In the weeks preceding the outbreak of hostilities, the art gallery had gone 
through video hell. 
</P>
<P>
The gallery is in Los Angeles' industrial downtown, a neighborhood so favored 
by TV and movie makers for its all-purpose gritty-slummy-New Yorky-Philly look 
that film companies have been known to arrive there of a morning to find other 
film companies setting up at the far end of the same block. 
</P>
<P>
Almost every week had brought another filmmaker to the gallery's doorstep, 
another caravan of vans and trailers and equipment trucks. The crew filming 
"The Doors." The crew shooting a commercial -- they wouldn't let a staffer 
cross the street to open for business until their shot was finished. The Disney 
company making "Filofax." In pique, some local slipped Disney its own Mickey: a 
sketch on a cinder-block wall of Mickey about to become mousemeat via a bullet 
from an automatic pistol. 
</P>
<P>
So it was that when a music video crew from Squeak Productions showed up 
unawares one recent morning, sentiment among some at the nonprofit multimedia 
gallery had reached critical mass. Hot words ensued over how long this would 
take, over whether the crew could film the building, over a car scraped by a 
film trolley, over music that could be heard inside the brick-walled offices. 
</P>
<P>
At last, one staffer simply stood in front of the camera: by executive producer 
Pam Tarr's account, to demand money; by his account, to stop the filming until 
he could get questions answered. By the time filming ended, $300 had changed 
hands, for the homeless writers' coalition, the gallery employee said. "The 
money isn't the point," the man said. "I'd rather they move elsewhere" and not 
impede the life of the neighborhood. If they won't, they "should leave 
something behind for the people most affected," like the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Tarr's small company tries to be "as courteous and cooperative as we can be. . 
. . If we had any idea how upset they would be, we would not have shot there." 
However laudable the charity, the $300 hurt: "Sometimes we feel like whenever 
we shoot, Paramount Pictures has been there the day before with $10,000 petty 
cash to throw around." 
</P>
<P>
Lights, camera, action -- reaction. 
</P>

Something about filmmaking stirs up a cinematic "not in my back yard" syndrome. 
In the town that made movies, and was all but made by them, film crews can feel 
as unwanted as fill dirt from Chernobyl. Los Angeles cohabits with a beloved 
monster of an industry that does not always operate tidily behind factory 
walls. Resenting glitzkrieg invasions, town after town and neighborhood after 
neighborhood lays down rules and hikes up fees. Long Beach charges $250 for a 
film permit, $400 a day to shoot in the city, and $200 an hour for filming on 
city property. Beverly Hills, not known for coming cheap on anything, charges 
$759 a day, and a $125 business tax. Manhattan Beach, $1,500 a day. 
</P>
<P>
That makes Los Angeles a bargain, and a draw. With a $130 permit, the right 
insurance and policing, you can film all day in the mayor's office for $250. 
You couldn't film a shoeshine stand for that. So movie makers are at City Hall 
at least once a week, passing it off as Congress or the Vatican or San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Yet City Hall, disinclined to so much as ruffle the feathers of the golden 
egg-laying movie goose, now wants a bit more order in its own corridors, "to 
exert a little more control over the situation," said Charles Weisenberg, 
director of the city's motion picture and television affairs office. Garage 
worker Eddie Santillan has heard that the mayor, driving out of the garage, 
complains that they can't see the traffic for the movie vans nosed along the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
* The view from the canvas chair: 
</P>
<P>
Film companies feel blackmailed by scams and greedheads. They're visible, their 
shooting schedules leave them vulnerable, and from the weekly take from 
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" some people think anyone with a camera is rich. 
</P>
<P>
LAPD Traffic Officer Tim Wienckowski has worked for years on movie security. At 
a filming for Fox-TV's "The Outsiders" at a San Fernando Valley construction 
site, a workman ostentatiously revved up a chain saw. The crew objected. I tell 
you what, the workman said, all sweet reason. For $300 I will stop. "That right 
there," said Wienckowski, "is extortion." But they were losing the light, 
losing several thousand dollars every hour that cameras were shut down. And so 
a guy Wienckowski was itching to arrest walked away with his chain saw and 
$300. 
</P>
<P>
Location manager Cliff Roseman: "You have the horror stories and the 
sweethearts just like everything, the nice people who'll bring out coffee and 
doughnuts, and then you have the goniffs. L.A. just seems to have more goniffs 
than other places." 
</P>
<P>
* The view from the front porch and the office window: 
</P>
<P>
Locals feel bullied by Hollywood arrogance that takes cooperation for granted, 
that acts as if the words "We're filming here" ought to command the same 
deference as "We're curing cancer here." A City Hall staff member, who asked 
not to be named, said that she doesn't mind the snarls of cable so much as 
this: "I get resentful because of that sense of importance that dominates the 
movie industry -- that a half-hour episode of 'Hooper' could be more important 
than anything I could possibly do here." 
</P>
<P>
In the rankings of urban unpleasantness, when movie shoots come in well behind 
real shoots -- the semiautomatic kind -- behind crack sales and smog alerts, 
life in a "hot spot" neighborhood can still try anyone's endurance. A pediatric 
surgeon complained that he was kept awake long past midnight by filming. A 
major movie figure importuned a location manager to tell him how to keep away 
the movie companies that like to ply his own trade on his street. "Sometimes," 
said another manager, "the worst are the people in the movie business." 
</P>
<P>
Unless you live in it, a movie shoot may amount to a traffic delay, a detour, a 
momentary scare when you see the helicopters and ambulances before you spot the 
cameras. KNX Radio traffic doyen Bill Keene recalls the evening rush hour in 
the Cahuenga Pass, when a video company started to inflate a Spuds Mackenzie 
balloon. "The Hollywood Freeway was absolutely locked, people looking at this 
dumb dog being blown up." 
</P>
<P>
Such is life in a company town. Weisenberg said, "If we lived in Dodge City, 
we'd have cattle drives." 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, aerospace and tourism are richer, but movies and TV generate $5 
billion a year for California, 90% of it for Los Angeles. Three billion more 
skips town in productions shot elsewhere, largely, the industry said, because 
of costs and more red tape than videotape. The city must meet the competition, 
they warn. Or we'll go. 
</P>
<P>
Angelenos have actor sightings enough, in delis, at the dry cleaners, in court. 
Who wants them cluttering up your block? Each day, 40 or 50 productions, from 
feature films to 15-second commercials, hit L.A. streets. Production 
concentrates in a 30-mile zone, most of the L.A. basin, beyond which overtime 
and location costs soar. Of the 94 cities in the zone, said California Film 
Commission Director Lisa Rawlins, perhaps 16 are constantly filmed, some more 
willingly than others. Los Angeles bends over to be accommodating: 
</P>
<P>
Zoning laws prohibit business operations in most neighborhoods, the chief 
exception being the one allowing people to rent their homes for movies. Film 
crews can get permission to reroute buses and move bus stops. With $5-million 
insurance they can fly helicopters. The city's charges are "minimal," said 
Weisenberg, "intended to encourage filming here." 
</P>
<P>
The crew of "Diehard" had to wait one day for a Century City scene of tanks and 
troops thundering across Avenue of the Stars, guns blasting. President Reagan 
was due in that night and his security people "might not understand," said 
Weisenberg. 
</P>
<P>
The powers that be said yes when the crew of "Diehard 2" wanted to stage a 
predawn riot at the Tom Bradley Terminal. But they said "no" when a crew wanted 
to use plastic snow, lest it drift across the runway and be sucked up in jet 
engines. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Gay is chief deputy to City Councilman Gil Lindsay. Movies are good fun, 
he said, but how far is fair? For another business, the city would insist on 
environmental impact reports on noise and traffic and parking. "Movie studios 
don't have to do any of that stuff. They get basically carte blanche to do 
anything they want to." 
</P>
<P>
Walking down a City Hall corridor now and again, Gay has found himself grabbed 
by a crew member who pulled him out of the shot. A crew permitted to film 
Lindsay's office wanted the staff to "come through the back door, and shut off 
our phones from ringing." 
</P>
<P>
This year's St. Patrick's Day gala -- with Mayor Bradley, Ed McMahon, the 
former Lord Mayor of Dublin and two Aer Lingus stewardesses -- ended with a 
parade of bagpipers and shamrocked preschoolers. 
</P>
<P>
They marched out of council chambers -- and into a smoky, half-lit hallway 
being filmed for a commercial. "OK, everybody back up against the wall!" the 
director shouted at his crew, and directed pipers and kids to daylight. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'm saying is, what's the limit?" said Gay. "When you come into City 
Hall, the actual seat of government where major policy is happening each day, 
the last thing you need when you're trying to get somewhere is to have someone 
stop you, yank you into a bathroom, telling you to watch the cables or to shut 
up when you're trying to have a business conversation. We've swung the pendulum 
so far, we're so anxious to get them here." 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of a sound stage, Hancock Park is probably the most-shot 
part of Los Angeles. Its homes are big, architecturally varied, and lush with 
the kind of detail that no studio can afford to create. For several thousand 
dollars a day, they can rent it. 
</P>
<P>
Producer Ron Gilbert was shooting there a while back, across the street from a 
man who "wanted money, even though we weren't shooting (him) or disturbing 
him." He drove his car across the street and turned up the radio to "blast." 
</P>
<P>
"I want you to know," said Gilbert, "this guy lived in an estate. And he said 
he'll turn it off for $500. It was the principle. I wouldn't pay him." At last, 
"his wife came and pulled him away." 
</P>
<P>
Every shoot adds to the anthology: a woman who cranked up her country-Western 
station and sat waiting for a payoff, not knowing the crew wasn't shooting 
sound film. The man in a window flashing a light into the cameras to get them 
to leave. The contractor and homeowner who were paid big money not to start 
noisy repair work that they had no intention of doing anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the people who are mad are the people who don't make money for it," 
said Al Drouin, a Van Nuys man who let filmmakers use his house for "Real Men." 
</P>
<P>
"And let's face it, they don't pay everybody." 
</P>
<P>
No neighborhood, even Hancock Park, is uniform in its attitudes. But the 
homeowners' association has drawn up regulations requiring advance notice, 
parking on only one side of the street, busing in the crew, and trucks arriving 
no earlier than the permit allows and leaving no later than it demands. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't care about seeing movie stars or television actors," said its 
president, Marguerite Byrne. "It's a question of the peace and quiet of your 
own home. It's like whether you can sleep at night, have your family over. . . 
. I would say probably three or four times as many people turn down thousands 
of dollars to use their home for filming." 
</P>
<P>
In adjacent Windsor Square, a family near Harry Olivar's house bought a house 
some years ago intending "to pay their mortgage out of the revenues" of renting 
it for movies, Olivar said. Neighbors complained at the ceaseless file of 
trucks and crews. The family became "somewhat indignant, that this was their 
divine right -- 'How am I going to pay the mortgage without it?' What you have 
here is a few individuals benefiting in a monetary way, and a drawback to the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
When it does work, as it did for Al Drouin, big disruption is balanced by big 
bucks. 
</P>
<P>
Drouin's neighborhood had already starred in "Fast Times at Ridgemont High." 
MGM-UA came back to blow up the garage across the street for "Real Men," and it 
needed Drouin's house to launch the missile. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-five people out there, shooting past midnight, noise, trucks, lights, 
but at $500 a day, "the money is good, let's face it." By the time the crew 
left, the Drouins had a new front fence and a nice little nest egg. A neighbor 
confined to a wheelchair had a video of the enterprise, recorded by Drouin's 
son and paid for by the film crew. And one neighbor had a new color TV, won in 
a drawing set up by the film crew. 
</P>
<P>
Good manners and occasional cash flow: location manager Brian Haynes has 
offered to kennel dogs during an explosive gunfight, and hired a vet to stand 
by when the scene was shot. He hands out studio tour tickets as thank yous. He 
replaced a $6,000 wooden floor when a fish tank leaked during a fistfight. Like 
his fellow location managers, he sometimes finds that a judiciously placed $50 
bill can shut off a lawn mower, or a radio, or a complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Since January, any company wanting to stop traffic on Main Street in the rustic 
town of Fillmore must put up $15,000 for the merchants, a figure City 
Councilman and Assistant Fire Chief Roger Campbell thinks is too high. Some 
merchants must think so, too. Paul Hogan's company spent months there, and were 
so courteous some merchants gave the money back. "If all film companies were as 
good as (Hogan's)," said Campbell, "we wouldn't need any ordinance." 
</P>
<P>
Their ordinance, two years in the making, was a defense measure for a town 
overwhelmed by filmmaking, some of it fine, like "La Bamba," some outrageous: 
</P>
<P>
* The day Campbell and the police chief checked out a car roll-over stunt and 
calculated it would smash into the back of a house. "The (stunt) guy said 'You 
don't know what you're talking about.' " He took off, and crashed into the 
house. Campbell was furious. "That was the pure intention of the stunt." 
</P>
<P>
* The morning an apparently driverless car, steered from under the dashboard, 
was to careen down Main Street and crash into a fake barrier. It looked 
harmless enough until the fire chief noticed a film crewman standing by with a 
five-gallon bucket of gasoline, "to throw it as the car went by and light it." 
</P>
<P>
* Last November, when a music video company "had a guy and a girl doing things 
that shouldn't be done except in the privacy of their own home," at an open-air 
shoot with kids hanging around. A lewd-conduct regulation was worked into the 
ordinance, too. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance also requires script approval to make sure that what they say 
they will do and what they intend to do are one and the same, and a $500 fee, 
partly refundable, for the city's paper work. The state film commission "sent 
very strong suggestions as to what was wrong with our ordinance," said 
Campbell. "We didn't pay attention to them." 
</P>
<P>
As balm to raw feelings, Rawlins' office and movie makers have worked up a code 
of conduct that sounds as simple as a high school's. Pick up your trash. Wear 
ID badges. Be polite. Arrive when you're supposed to, leave on time. For that's 
the rub, when "just one hour" becomes five, when "a few people" become 50. 
</P>
<P>
In the recent movie snafu in the Mojave Desert, filmmakers assured authorities 
that markings they wanted to paint in an ancient limestone cavern would wash 
off, and then they didn't. That kind of intrusion is what brings 15 or 20 
complaints a week to Rawlins' office. Cash blandishment "wears thin after a 
while," said Rawlins. "I think the industry had become very accustomed to 
throwing money at a problem," and "will have to adopt a much stronger (public 
relations) position." 
</P>
<P>
In South Pasadena, film companies already donate to local projects, and "local 
attitudes have changed recently simply because of this," said Rawlins. 
</P>
<P>
Local attitudes were taken into account when "Heat Wave" came to South Central, 
a place that sees as little of film companies as it does of chain stores. 
L.A.-based Avnet/Kerner Production Co. is making the cable feature about the 
1965 Watts riots, and it prides itself on its responsible films. They always 
intended, they say, to arrange a community benefit tied to a "Heat Wave" 
screening, but in part through Assemblywoman Maxine Waters and Lindsay deputy 
Gay, the neighborhood got more. 
</P>
<P>
When they filmed the Pueblo housing projects, they filmed the Pueblo people 
too, as extras, at $40 for eight hours' work. The disgruntled were offered 
motel rooms and meals. Twelve hundred dollars went to a local exterminator, 
after crews found their working interiors around 33rd and Central aswarm with 
rats. Buildings got painted, buildings got cleaned up, all by paid locals, all 
of a piece with the agreement to "leave the area as good or better," said lead 
producer Jordan Kerner. 
</P>
<P>
For an hourly $15 each, Louis Farrakhan's Fruit of Islam followers were 
enlisted as round-the-clock security. Lead producer Jordan Kerner: "They were 
just tremendous, very easy to work with." 
</P>
<P>
A socially responsible, expensive shoot. It cost "a lot more" for this "very 
important movie," Kerner said -- $100,000 over budget for the Fruit of Islam 
alone. Now "it's just a matter of how much we'll lose." Yet there are other 
kinds of profit; the newsmagazines and news shows have come knocking. 
</P>
<P>
"The saturation, the volume of films, the amount of filming done on a daily 
basis, and the lack of cooperation from people, and the greed" -- it makes for 
misery on both sides, said Roseman. But Los Angeles "will say 'damn' when it's 
gone." 
</P>
<P>
As far as Campbell is concerned, the upheaval "can be justified if the city 
gets the benefit" in something tangible, like recreation projects. "People do 
not like having their daily lives disrupted, and just to make a movie is not a 
good enough reason to do that."

"C'mon L.A. . . . Express yourself!" Those were Madonna's opening words at one 
of her sold-out concerts here this week. And the erstwhile Material Girl's 
faithful fans did indeed respond to her call, expressing themselves through 
mimicry. Madonna wanna-bes hit the L.A. Sports Arena in full force, providing a 
walking retrospective of the fashion styles that, as much as her music, have 
made the singer a cultural icon. Racing to copy her ever-changing fashion 
shifts, these youthful fans had her previous looks down pat, but the object of 
their flattery-by-imitation stayed one step ahead of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
On stage, in her latest incarnation, Madonna mixed high style with high camp. 
With dark eyebrows, electric red lips and her blond mane slicked back and 
topped with a fountain-like, fake ponytail, the songstress shifted through a 
wide array of costumes, most of them by Paris designer Jean Paul Gaultier, 
others by Los Angeles based Marlene Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
Revolving around her wardrobe's main staple -- a corset with pointy, heavily 
stitched bra -- Madonna's costume changes included a double-breasted pinstripe 
pantsuit with corset worn over the pants, under the jacket, a striped hooded 
Lycra top worn over the corset and pants, without the jacket; a silver sequined 
and fringed outfit reminiscent of a Las Vegas chorus line costume, and a long 
black, shroud-like dress. The encore outfit was a little bit more frivolous: a 
polka dotted halter with mega-flared hip-hugger pants. Her main accessory was a 
gold lorgnette on a long, gold chain that she first wore for her "Express 
Yourself" video. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the Sports Arena, fans squealed, "Strike a pose," in reference to 
Madonna's new hit video, "Vogue," but they did not adapt the Old Hollywood 
glamour looks she wears for that video. One homage outfit included a black 
sequined bustier over cut-off, rolled-up blue jeans, patent leather Doc Martin 
shoes and a slew of crucifixes. As the wearer, Karen Jimenez put it, she 
imitates the singer because "Madonna's baaad." 
</P>
<P>
 Styles featured on Madonna's recent videos, particularly "Express Yourself," 
found their way into the wanna-be repertoire. Kathlene Kolian, 23, had the look 
down to a T with a mannish-cut dark suit and curly platinum hair. 
</P>
<P>
Even men got into the act. Kolian's companion, Mitchell Stevens, paid tribute 
to Madonna with knee-length shorts and a string of pearls around his neck. 
Emerson Chavez, in a black "Express Yourself" suit replete with plunging 
neckline and carefully coiffed hairdo, described his fascination with Madonna's 
look. "Every time she comes out with something new, some new look, I try to 
copy her. She's the one. She's got great style." 
</P>
<P>
Liz Rosenberg, vice president of publicity at Warner Bros. records, has been 
touring with Madonna and found that, like their idol, the Madonna mimics are 
changing. "They've grown up," she noted, adding that most of the people who 
started copying Madonna in their teens are now easing into their 20s but they 
haven't turned away from their idol. 
</P>
<P>
"Madonna says, 'Be like what you want,' and what they want is to be like her." 
</P>
<P>
While not every fan went for all-out imitation, some tidbits of Madonna's 
fashion sense were noticeable on almost everyone. Rolled-up, knee-length jeans, 
see-through chiffon tops and small black hats like one she wore for her "Open 
Your Heart" video, were spotted. 
</P>
<P>
The Gaultier influence was not lost on the fans either. Many sported knockoff 
versions of the designer's contoured jackets and T-shirts imprinted with the 
Gaultier logo. "It's Madonna and Jean Paul Gaultier," said Maya Rudolph. 
"They're what style is all about." 
</P>
<P>
Fans copped lifestyle tips from their idol as well. Recalling a scene from 
Madonna's film "Desperately Seeking Susan," long lines formed at the 
wall-mounted hand dryers in the ladies' room. The faithful weren't there to dry 
their hands though. A twist of the nozzle and the wanna-bes had created a 
makeshift hair dryer. Express yourself, indeed. 
</P>

-- is a corset with "bullet" bra. For more on her, and her wanna-bes, see E12.

THINGS ARE TUFA ALL AROUND RANGERS AT MONO LAKE RESERVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES HILLINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
MONO LAKE TUFA STATE RESERVE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Janet and Dave Carle are California's tufa rangers. 
</P>
<P>
They are the only year-round tufa rangers in America, possibly in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"When we're far from home and out of uniform and someone asks our occupation, 
we say we're guides and guardians of tufa," said Janet Carle. " 'Tufa? What's 
tufa?' everybody asks." 
</P>
<P>
Tufa (too-fah) is a unique limestone-like substance found in outcroppings 
around a few of the most unusual lakes on earth. 
</P>
<P>
And Mono Lake, a cratered Ice Age leftover, is perhaps the best known of the 
tufa lakes. Here on the shores of ancient and mysterious Mono Lake, dramatic 
tufa formations decorate the foot of Yosemite's Tioga Pass. 
</P>
<P>
Imaginative visitors to the lake "see all kinds of things in the tufa," said 
Dave Carle, "They say they see mammoth mushrooms, or camels, horses, or 
elephants. They see a woman holding child, a couple arm-in-arm, and even giant 
cement cauliflowers." 
</P>
<P>
Calcium carbonate tufa spires, knobs and towers are created by thousands of 
calcium-bearing fresh water springs welling up through the alkaline waters and 
briny lake bottom of Mono Lake. When the calcium and carbonate combine, the 
product is a limestone-like precipitate. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, the state established the Tufa Reserve here to protect what the Carles 
say is "one of the greatest concentrations of tufa on earth." 
</P>
<P>
The designation helps preserve and protect the spectacular tufa formations and 
other natural features found along the shores of the million-year-old lake, one 
of North America's oldest. 
</P>
<P>
When the Tufa Reserve was established, Dave Carle, 39, and his wife, Janet, 36, 
became the first California State Park rangers assigned here. 
</P>
<P>
"We share one ranger position, get one paycheck between us," said Dave Carle. 
"There are a half-dozen shared ranger jobs in the state park system, but we're 
the only husband-wife team." 
</P>
<P>
The Carles, who have two sons, say their eight-year assignment has been an 
exciting one. Both are veteran rangers -- Janet for 13 years, Dave for 15. 
</P>
<P>
By sharing their tufa ranger post, Dave Carle is able to pursue his other 
career as a mystery writer. His first book, "Hitting The Wall," stars a state 
park ranger and is scheduled for publication this fall by Cliffhanger Press, 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the Carles have pioneered the trails in the 7,000-acre reserve, 
finding paths around the state-owned portion of the 13-mile-long and 
eight-mile-wide lake. The remainder of the shoreline is U.S. forest. 
</P>
<P>
"We take turns patroling the area, conducting nature walks, doing maintenance 
work, providing information to visitors," said Janet Carle. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to nearly any region of the lake find themselves surrounded by exotic 
tufa formations. Some canoe through tufa outcroppings. Some swim with tufa -- 
or float, actually, since submersion is almost impossible in a lake that is 
more than twice as salty and 1,000 times as alkaline as the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The water of Mono Lake feels soapy and slippery. Its unusual properties have 
been documented by many of its visitors but most famously perhaps by Mark 
Twain, who 130 years ago wrote: 
</P>
<P>
"Its sluggish waters are so strong with alkali that if you only dip the most 
hopelessly soiled garment into them once or twice, and ring it out, it will be 
found as clean as if it had been through the ablest of washer woman's hands." 
</P>

Two members of the Orange County Planning Commission helped host a private 
dinner Tuesday where they solicited campaign donations on behalf of an Assembly 
candidate from Huntington Beach, according to some of those present. 
</P>
<P>
Among those attending were several representatives of South County developers, 
including at least one who has a project pending before the Planning 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The dinner, on behalf of 58th Assembly District candidate Peter von Elten, took 
place at a restaurant owned by Planning Commission Chairman Stephen Nordeck and 
was attended by commission member Roger Slates. 
</P>
<P>
Nordeck, however, strongly denied in an interview that it was a fund-raising 
dinner, that he hosted the gathering or that he solicited any contributions. He 
said he was present on and off throughout the evening only because of his 
duties as owner of the Trabuco Oaks Steak House. Slates declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Others at the dinner provided a different account of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the roughly 15 people present said that the financing of von Elten's 
bid for the Legislature was discussed, and that both Nordeck and Slates spoke 
to the guests on behalf of the candidate, encouraging them to contribute to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"Roger obviously and Steve Nordeck -- the two of them, they sponsored the 
dinner -- were indicating it would be nice if they wanted to contribute," said 
Huntington Beach City Councilman Don MacAllister, who was there. "But there was 
no pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Among those who attended were two representatives of the Arvida Corp., which 
has a phase of its multimillion-dollar Coto de Caza development pending before 
the Planning Commission. Also present was a prominent lobbyist who has 
represented other South County developers that have periodic dealings with the 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Ellis, von Elten's campaign manager, said that no money "changed hands" at 
the dinner. Others interviewed said that guests were encouraged to contribute 
at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Michioku, a spokeswoman for the California Fair Political Practices 
Commission, said Thursday that state law bars appointed members of public 
commissions or boards from soliciting campaign contributions of $250 or more 
from individuals who have matters pending before them. 
</P>
<P>
Michioku stressed that her comments were general and that she could reach "no 
conclusions" about the dinner at Nordeck's restaurant without further 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, they may not accept, solicit or direct a contribution of 
$250 or more for any campaign if the contributor is involved in a decision 
which is pending before that body," Michioku said. 
</P>
<P>
But Nordeck said he didn't solicit contributions from developers or anyone else 
at the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been in politics for years," said Nordeck, 48, who was appointed to the 
Planning Commission last year by Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez. "I am not naive 
enough to ever allow a fund-raiser in my restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
Reached by telephone, Slates said simply, "I'm not talking to the press." 
Slates, a 60-year-old real estate consultant, first served on the commission 
from 1972 to 1975 and was appointed to a new term last year by Supervisor 
Harriett M. Wieder. 
</P>
<P>
Von Elten, an executive with the Mola Development Co. in Huntington Beach, did 
not return calls for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis said that neither he nor von Elten paid for their meals, and that he 
understood the tab would be divided later between the two planning 
commissioners and von Elten's campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Harlow, a consultant who represents developers before the Huntington 
Beach Planning Commission, said that he attended but didn't pay for his meal, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't get a chit set in front of me," Harlow said. "I left money for a tip. 
. . . You paid for the dinner at your own option." He said he assumed that he 
would "settle up" with Slates later. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Councilman MacAllister said that both Nordeck and Slates spoke 
to the group on behalf of the candidate and encouraged the guests -- most of 
whom he described as South County businessmen -- to contribute to von Elten's 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
MacAllister also said that von Elten was introduced to guests by both Nordeck 
and Slates and that he then talked about his goals as a candidate and the 
difficulty of financing a campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Councilman John Erskine, who also attended, described the 
dinner as "a very typical political event" where "it's understood that this is 
the guy that X, Y and Z is supporting." Guests at such events, Erskine said, 
are encouraged to make contributions at a later date rather than writing a 
check at the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Erskine said he was driven to the dinner with MacAllister, Slates, and Harlow 
in a chauffeured white limousine, for which each passenger chipped in $50. 
Erskine said he paid no one for his meal and assumed that Slates had picked up 
his tab. Erskine said he plans to report the dinner as a gift from Slates on 
financial disclosure statements that public officials are required to file 
under law. 
</P>
<P>
"I was basically asked to go by Roger Slates, who's a friend and a member of 
the Planning Commission," Erskine said. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign manager Ellis refused to disclose who was invited to the dinner, 
describing the guests only as leading South County businessmen who do not like 
"politics and publicity." 
</P>
<P>
Nordeck said he did not know who was invited to the dinner because he was not 
involved in planning the affair. 
</P>
<P>
But Ellis said that Nordeck invited von Elten. 
</P>
<P>
And Supervisor Vasquez said Nordeck called one of his aides about two weeks ago 
to inform him of the "meet and greet" dinner that was to be held at his 
restaurant. Vasquez described it as a courtesy call and said Nordeck did not 
invite him to attend. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez said he would reserve comment on the dinner until he learns more about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
When told of the dinner, Supervisor Wieder expressed surprise. "That's the 
first I've heard of it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the guests at the dinner in Nordeck's restaurant were Irwin R. Schatzman 
and Kevin A. Canning, both representatives of Arvida. In addition to the 
sprawling Coto de Caza subdivision near Trabuco Canyon, the corporation is 
planning the Rolling Hills development near San Clemente, which is under 
preliminary review by county planners. 
</P>
<P>
Schatzman, a planning consultant who represents the Coto de Caza project before 
the county, declined to comment beyond referring questions about the dinner to 
von Elten's campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
Canning, a director of governmental relations for Arvida, acknowledged that he 
attended as a guest of Schatzman, who also attended. He said he paid no one for 
his meal, but assumed that Schatzman had picked up the tab. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Wednesday with The Times, Canning at first said there was no 
discussion at the dinner of von Elten's campaign and that guests were there 
simply to watch the Los Angeles Lakers game on television. 
</P>
<P>
When told that others had acknowledged that the campaign's finances were 
discussed, Canning said: "There was a general discussion of what it cost him to 
run a campaign but that was as far as it went." 
</P>
<P>
On March 5, Canning spoke on behalf of Arvida's expansion plans for the 
southern end of Coto de Caza, which includes construction of an additional golf 
course to be surrounded by 90 single-family houses. The county planning staff 
recommended against the proposal, according to minutes of the March 5 Planning 
Commission meeting. The proposal remains under review, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Nordeck and Slates participated in the commission's questioning of Canning 
at the March 5 meeting, according to minutes of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Barnard Klein, a lawyer for homeowners who recently filed a lawsuit over the 
Planning Commission's approval of another expansion in the Coto de Caza 
subdivision, said he found reports of the dinner at Nordeck's restaurant 
troubling. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that asking someone to do a favor when you're in a position to do 
another favor exposes you, rightly or wrongly, to being accused of a conflict 
of interest." Neither Schatzman nor Canning live in the 58th Assembly District, 
which von Elten seeks to represent. (The district includes Huntington Beach, 
Seal Beach and portions of Long Beach, among other areas. Voter records show 
that Schatzman lives in Fountain Valley and Canning lives in San Clemente.) 
</P>
<P>
At least one of von Elten's opponents, Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J. Mays, 
said he has questions about the dinner at Nordeck's restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned about this race being funded by special interests," Mays said. 
"That's exactly what is happening. He (von Elten) has left Huntington Beach, 
where the money is tight, and gone down to the South County." 
</P>
<P>
"It appears to me the Planning Commission is putting the squeeze on the 
developers. The developers can't say no to planning commissioners. . . . If 
they don't play ball, they don't get their projects approved." 
</P>
<P>
Also present at Tuesday's dinner, according to Canning and others who attended, 
was Lyle A. Overby, one of the county's most prominent lobbyists and a 
representative of the Santa Margarita Co., which has an ongoing development 
project in South County. 
</P>
<P>
Overby, who ran unsuccessfully for a Santa Ana City Council seat last year, 
declined to discuss the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
"I was at no fund-raiser. . . . I don't have anything to discuss with the L.A. 
Times," Overby said. "Where I am and what I do is of no concern of yours."

DAVID ROCKEFELLER TO BUILD OFFICE PROJECT IN ANAHEIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A partnership led by David Rockefeller said Thursday that it will build its 
first Southern California project here -- a $100-million complex across the 
street from Anaheim Stadium that will include two 13-story office buildings and 
a 150-room hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by a stone wall and several rings of trees, the 12-acre Central Park 
Towers project is intended to look like a scaled-down version of New York 
City's Central Park. It will be more lavishly landscaped than most of the 
office buildings in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the usual tinted glass that most Orange County office buildings 
sport, the office towers by Rockefeller &amp; Associates Realty will probably 
have exteriors of precast concrete designed to look like marble. 
</P>
<P>
The Rockefeller partnership is a development and investment company based in 
San Francisco. Its predecessor developed that city's big Embarcadero Center 
office and hotel complex. David Rockefeller, one of the wealthy family's more 
prominent members, is the chairman and major owner. Most of the other investors 
are his New York business associates. 
</P>
<P>
The project comes at a time when the nation's top banking regulators have 
warned lenders to be wary of overbuilt real estate markets, Orange County among 
them. The office vacancy rate in Orange County exceeds 20%. 
</P>
<P>
But the Rockefeller partnership is betting that it can exploit a lull in 
construction around the stadium and open the complex when that office market 
gets tighter several years from now. 
</P>
<P>
The firm said it picked Anaheim -- a less prestigious business address than 
Irvine or Newport Beach -- because the office markets in those cities are not 
expected to improve as quickly as Anaheim's. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership has agreed to buy the Anaheim property from several owners for 
$12.7 million. The sale is expected to close this summer. Construction of the 
578,000-square-foot office development is scheduled to begin next spring and to 
finish during 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The project has yet to be approved by the city, but Rockefeller &amp; 
Associates officials said they do not anticipate any major problems when it 
goes before the City Council in September. 
</P>
<P>
Whether both office towers will be built at the same time depends on the number 
of tenants that can be signed up before construction, said Timothy B. Good, an 
Irvine developer and a partner in the project. 
</P>
<P>
Good said the partners are negotiating with four hotel companies to run the 
small hotel and that a deal is near. Original plans called for the hotel to 
have 350 rooms, Good said, but it was scaled down when he found that big hotel 
companies had saturated the Anaheim market and were not interested in running 
another big full-service hotel. This hotel is to be an all-suite facility 
designed for extended stays. 
</P>
<P>
Central Park Towers will also include a big restaurant and several smaller 
eateries and shops. The stadium area, once an industrial neighborhood, does not 
have many shops or restaurants, so office developers usually provide them. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership spent a year looking at Southern California before deciding on 
Orange County, said Bill Hatch, president and managing partner of Rockefeller 
&amp; Associates. It is still studying other investments, which it will not 
disclose, in the county. Rockefeller &amp; Associates also bought a business 
park in La Jolla in San Diego County this spring. 
</P>
<P>
(Rockefeller &amp; Associates is not part of the family's Rockefeller Group, 
which owns Rockefeller Center in New York City. That company made news last 
year when it sold 51% of itself and its landmark Manhattan building to 
Mitsubishi Estate Co. of Japan.) 
</P>
<P>
In Anaheim, at least three major developers have already obtained city 
permission to build office towers around the stadium, which is home to the 
California Angels baseball and the Rams football teams. 
</P>
<P>
But at least some of those buildings probably will not be constructed, Good 
said, because finding money to build has recently become much harder. 
</P>
<P>
"The amount of office space coming on the market won't be nearly as great as 
you might think," he said, "because players in the capital markets are getting 
hard to find as dinosaurs." 
</P>
<P>
Thrifts are out of the picture after the savings and loan debacle, the banks 
are leery of real estate, and big investors -- pension funds and insurance 
companies -- are also being more cautious. Some, in fact, are trying to sell 
buildings they already own in Orange County because the market is so soft. 
</P>
<P>
L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., recently 
cited Orange County as one the places bank regulators believe is overbuilt. 
Local and state officials, however, said federal officials failed to consider 
the area's continuing population growth and its strong absorption rate (the 
rate at which new space is leased). 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there are still plenty of tenants, real estate brokers said. But 
developers have built so many buildings that they must offer low rents and 
other incentives to persuade tenants to sign a lease. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still a tenants' market right now, and landlords are giving up quite a 
lot in the way of concessions, but it's not as bad as it was a year and a half 
ago," said Mike Martin, a partner in the brokerage Lee &amp; Associates. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Orange County market is already tightening up, brokers say, and 
office rents are getting higher. 
</P>
<P>
The competition for tenants is a big problem in the Newport Beach and Irvine 
neighborhoods around John Wayne Airport, where big developers have preferred to 
build. Add the traffic jams and the high cost of housing in those cities, Hatch 
said, and the Anaheim market begins to look more appealing. 
</P>
<P>
Until 1986, older cities such as Anaheim and Santa Ana, with their run-down 
urban neighborhoods, were generally passed over as sites for office towers. 
Then, until 1988, developers built office towers in those areas. The developers 
stopped building, though, when most of the offices were not leased quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Among the developers were some of the biggest in the county -- Hutton 
Development, the Koll Co., Hillman Properties. Most of them have city 
permission to build even more towers near the stadium, although none has 
announced plans to do so yet. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Rockefeller perceives a window of opportunity here," said John Owen, a 
vice president at Cushman &amp; Wakefield in Orange County, a commercial real 
estate brokerage owned by the Rockefeller Group. "A lot of space came on the 
market in 1988, and there's a hesitancy for the next guy to jump in and build 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Backed with Rockefeller's financial muscle, loans to build the project will be 
easy to obtain, Good said. 
</P>
<P>
He and Dave Dawson, another developer, are limited partners in the project. 
David Rockefeller is putting up all the money from partnership and will own the 
vast majority of the project. Good, who conceived Central Park Towers in his 
former job with McKellar Development and Dawson, former chairman of the 
Stanford Ranch planned community near Sacramento, will receive an unspecified 
small percentage of the ownership for helping develop and market Central Park 
Towers. 
</P>
<P>
There is the risk that another wave of construction will dump another large 
amount of office space and high vacancy rate on the central county market 
several years from now. 
</P>
<P>
That's OK, Hatch said. "We build and own projects for the long term," he said. 
"And central Orange County is a lot more valuable than people give it credit 
for. We see it eventually developing into an extremely important, high-quality 
location."

DIANNE KLEIN: SMOKEY THE CAT LANDS ON ALL FOURS -- BACK IN ILLINOIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No one is really sure why Smokey took off. Ethel guesses it was on account of 
the vandal who smashed in the side window of the motor home. 
</P>
<P>
You get used to things being a certain way -- 17 years is a long time -- and a 
vandal in the motor home at night sort of throws things out of kilter. So 
Smokey bolted, not right away, (she was probably too shocked to do that), but 
sometime the next afternoon, at the sisters' house. 
</P>
<P>
The sisters are Mildred and Lois Shell, retired junior high school teachers in 
Fullerton. Ethel is Ethel Plieman, a friend formerly of Fullerton and now of 
Fox Lake, Ill. Ethel says she used to type for the Army and the Navy "years 
ago, when the war was on." That would be World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Smokey is Ethel's cat. She's gray, mostly, with some darker stripes. The white 
around her mouth makes her look like she started to lap up some white paint 
thinking it might be milk. Smokey is at least 17 years old, of indeterminate 
parentage. Ethel is 79. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, except for the smashed-in window on the smallish, secondhand motor 
home, Ethel's trip from Fox Lake to Fullerton was pretty uneventful. It was the 
usual stuff: highways, parks, visits with friends and relatives, that sort of 
thing. A little over two months in all. 
</P>
<P>
Ethel's made the trip lots of times -- just her and Smokey, and this year, 
Daisy, a 1-year-old mongrel. Skipper, another dog, recently passed away at the 
age of 17, so he couldn't come. Ethel does all the driving herself. 
</P>
<P>
Well, as I was saying, what threw things out of kilter was this business about 
the vandal and Smokey's exit. This is definitely not the usual stuff. The motor 
home had never been broken into, and as far as Ethel can recollect, Smokey's 
only left her one time before. 
</P>
<P>
"She was young," Ethel explains. "She didn't escape; she got scared. It was the 
Fourth of July, in Minnesota. She got away from me a little." 
</P>
<P>
No one can say for certain at exactly what point Smokey decided to try it again 
at the sisters' house. Mildred suspects that Smokey got bored just waiting in 
the motor home and decided to see the world while the three of them were having 
tea and refreshments. 
</P>
<P>
The sisters and Norma and I were having tea and refreshments ourselves as I was 
hearing this story the other day. Norma, by the way, is Norma Cook, the judge's 
wife, who lives across the street. (I suppose I should say the retired judge's 
wife, except that the judge is working awfully hard these days and nobody 
really thinks of him as retired.) 
</P>
<P>
OK, so Smokey got out somehow. Ethel discovers this en route to her sister's 
place. Ethel turns the motor home around, back to Fullerton. By this time the 
Shell sisters have gone out, so Ethel leaves a note on their door telling them 
about Smokey's disappearence. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's a camper around, she may go in it," the note said. ". . . If 
miracles happen, I hope to find her." 
</P>
<P>
Not content with a note, however, Ethel picked another neighborhood home, 
willy-nilly, to alert. Providence, the ladies agree in hindsight, must have 
been guiding Ethel at this point. 
</P>
<P>
Norma was home and took Smokey's vital statistics. This was at the end of 
March. 
</P>
<P>
Weeks passed and nothing. Norma finally untaped her note about Smokey from her 
cupboard door in the kitchen. There'd been no sign of any cat that fit Smokey's 
description, although one evening, during one of her walks with her husband, 
Norma did wonder about a cat that seemed to single her out for a special meow, 
down by the corner. 
</P>
<P>
Mildred and Lois, meanwhile, had been putting out table scraps on their back 
patio. They got lots of takers. None of them looked like Smokey. Then one 
weekend morning earlier this month, Norma opened her garage door and saw a gray 
flash heading toward the door. It looked like a cat. Norma started putting 
scraps out. In the mornings, she could see that something had been nibbling on 
them. This went on for a few days. 
</P>
<P>
One evening, Norma and Jim, the judge, were on their way out to dinner. They 
were in a hurry, so Norma didn't stop to investigate the gray flash she saw 
streaking from the garage. On the way back, however, she saw it again. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a baby opossum," Norma says. "Then I went around back and saw a second 
baby opossum, or at least it looked like a second one." 
</P>
<P>
Well, you can imagine, all this buildup for an opossum, possibly two opossums. 
Norma decided to get serious. She bought real cat food, and kitty litter. 
</P>
<P>
And then she heard the cry. A cat cry, from the bushes. 
</P>
<P>
Norma got cagey, moving the food, luring the cry closer and closer and finally, 
collaring a cat. Odds were good that it was Smokey. She had the white around 
the mouth, but she looked like she had seen better days. She was scrawny, and 
old-looking. Not good. 
</P>
<P>
A little while later, Norma called the veterinarian who, years ago, had treated 
the family dog, now deceased. Norma was thinking humanitarian thoughts, like 
maybe Smokey should just be put out of her misery. No sense in telling Ethel 
about any of this, she thought. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Glassberg, the vet, resisted. He told Norma to bring Smokey in. The 
cat was fine, he said, although she seemed to have some sort of infection. Also 
way too skinny. She'd been on her own about five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Glassberg thought Smokey should definitely be returned, alive and in good 
health, to Ethel. Norma had to agree. She went home with Smokey and a week's 
supply of cat antibiotics, which she administered twice a day. 
</P>
<P>
Suffice to say, Smokey thrived. After a while, she was living in the house, 
with Norma and the judge. One time, Norma says, she came home from someplace 
and found Smokey curled up next to her husband's head as he was reading in bed. 
</P>
<P>
By this time, of course, Ethel had been called. She was so happy to hear the 
news about Smokey that she started to cry. She'd already shed plenty of tears 
thinking that she'd never see her again. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just so hard to take, her being so old and all, out on her own," Ethel 
says. "And she'd never been gone before." 
</P>
<P>
Norma made the travel plans -- which ultimately involved her and Jim getting up 
at 4:30 a.m. to drive Smokey to the Ontario airport -- and Glassberg gave 
Smokey free vaccinations. After some last-minute hitches, Smokey finally 
arrived in Fox Lake around midnight. 
</P>
<P>
This was last week. Smokey's doing great. First thing she did when she got home 
was visit the litter box and head to the kitchen to see what was to eat. Gave 
Daisy, her traveling companion, a nose kiss. Also met the newcomer, a puppy 
that Ethel's grandson gave her in New Mexico on the trip back. 
</P>
<P>
"I have great faith in miracles," Ethel tells me over the phone from Fox Lake. 
"We're all fine. Smokey's right next to me now, curled up in this teeny 
basket." 
</P>
<P>
But back in Fullerton, Norma confesses to feeling a bit let down. She misses 
the little thing but reminds herself that the mission was to get her back. 
</P>
<P>
Mildred and Lois opine that Smokey is an intelligent cat, independent, with 
lots of personality. Norma brought her over to visit once. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't know what we would have done if it had decided to stay here," 
Mildred says. "We are not cat people." 
</P>
<P>
That's what Ethel tells me she said, too. Seventeen years ago.

IMPROVEMENTS BEGIN ON BEACH BOULEVARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Traffic-choked Beach Boulevard is getting help. Work was launched Thursday on a 
yearlong construction project to make Beach into a wider, safer "super street," 
the first such streamlined surface road in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Beach Boulevard runs north-south from the Orange County line in La Habra to the 
ocean, at Pacific Coast Highway in Huntington Beach. Along the way, it carries 
about 80,000 cars a day -- more traffic than any other surface street in Orange 
County, according to the county's Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
For four years, county Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder has worked to get Beach 
Boulevard expanded and streamlined so that traffic would move faster and 
easier. At groundbreaking ceremonies on Thursday morning in Huntington Beach, 
Wieder proudly heaved the first shovel of dirt. 
</P>
<P>
"They say that good things are worth waiting for, and this is a good thing," 
Wieder said to a group of about 50 people at the intersection of Beach and 
Edinger Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder recalled that the county Transportation Commission began planning for 
super streets four years ago, after county voters had rejected Measure A, a 
ballot proposal for more taxes to improve highways. "After the defeat of 
Measure A, we did go back to the drawing board," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Delays, she said, have been caused by lack of money for the project and by 
difficulties in getting the 10 cities along Beach Boulevard to agree to the 
plans. No parking will be allowed on Beach after it becomes a super street, and 
some cities initially balked at that idea. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation Commission officials said 19 1/2 miles of Beach Boulevard, from 
Pacific Coast Highway to Imperial Highway, ultimately will have synchronized 
stoplights, additional lanes, better turn areas and other safety improvements. 
The initial phase of the project calls for work between Ellis Avenue in 
Huntington Beach and Lincoln Avenue in Anaheim. That phase will cost $12.8 
million, and work is scheduled to be complete by the summer of 1991. The 
redevelopment of the remainder of Beach Boulevard will then proceed. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J. Mays spoke at the ceremonies and praised the 
project, which he said is vital to "a very important commercial area" of his 
city. Part of the super-street work, at the corner of Edinger and Beach, will 
improve access to Huntington Center, a mall that is one of the biggest 
sales-tax producers for Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Keith McKean, director of the state Department of Transportation, told the 
audience that the super-street project is "a beginning of what I see as a 
renaissance in commercial development, making access to commercial areas more 
feasible during peak hours." 
</P>
<P>
Three more super streets in the county are scheduled after Beach Boulevard is 
completed. They are Imperial Boulevard, Katella Avenue and a super street 
linking Edinger Avenue, Irvine Center Drive, Moulton Parkway and Street of the 
Golden Lantern. BILL BILLITER

DISABLED STUDENT'S LIFE SHORT BUT FULL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANICA KIRKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thessaly Lynne Miles' dream was to be typical -- to go to a university, to live 
in a dormitory, to go to college dances. 
</P>
<P>
Miles knew life in the dorms would be complicated because she had a muscle 
disorder, possibly muscular dystrophy. She needed the help of an attendant in 
the morning and the evening, used a wheelchair and had a breathing support 
system at night. 
</P>
<P>
And when she died in her dorm room last week at age 18, she left a legacy of 
admirers who say they are inspired by her courage and her example. 
</P>
<P>
The coroner's office said the exact cause of death won't be known for about 16 
weeks. But a coroner's official said it appears that Miles died of natural 
causes. She is survived by a brother, a sister and her parents. 
</P>
<P>
"You get the feeling it's not real. You expect to see her any time," said Jaime 
Amezcua, 18, a biological sciences major who lived next door. "She loved 
school. It was just her dream to come to school, live in the dorm -- live a 
normal life to the best possible extent." 
</P>
<P>
Miles' father, John, a Newport Beach attorney, said that doctors were unable to 
stem the progress of an illness they could never fully diagnose, and Thessaly 
Miles and her family knew she could die at any time. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing she wanted more than anything was a life as normal as possible," 
the Newport Beach attorney said. "She was trying to fly by herself, and we were 
trying to let her." 
</P>
<P>
As he gazed out the window of his fifth-floor office, Miles recalled how the 
illness slowly crept up on his daughter, from the first time she had to place 
her arm against the wall for support as a child to when she was too weak to 
climb the stairs of the school bus. It was almost as if she were carrying her 
body weight on her shoulders. If she were to stumble, her arms didn't have the 
strength to break her fall, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Eden Bright, who was Miles' algebra teacher in junior high school and at Dana 
Hills High School, said Miles walked on her own until the exhaustion of moving 
around the high school campus forced her into a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
She seemed so fragile that administrators were concerned about the job she held 
at school, working the switchboard. But Bright said Miles proved them wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"It is tough," Bright said of accepting Miles' death. "Especially when (she'd) 
worked so hard and gone so far." 
</P>
<P>
Academically, she did well. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she saw she could get past the wheelchair," her father said. "You 
really don't need a strong body, you need a strong mind." 
</P>
<P>
Her father said she refused to give up, refused to even think of herself as 
handicapped. She needed a wheelchair, but hated the idea of motorized vans with 
automatic lifts. She never wanted her parents to park in handicapped parking 
spots. She wanted to attend UC Irvine, even though a smaller campus would have 
been easier. 
</P>
<P>
Miles said his daughter "really felt included" by the students at UC Irvine. 
Her roommate, for example, prodded her to attend the annual semi-formal dance. 
</P>
<P>
She told her father that unlike other dances she had attended, she enjoyed this 
one. After her death, John Miles found flowers and a trophy glass among her 
things -- party favors from the dance. 
</P>
<P>
Her happiness with life at UCI prompted her father and some friends to discuss 
beginning a scholarship program in her honor for handicapped or disadvantaged 
students at UCI. 
</P>
<P>
Preston Allen, the associate director for residential life in Middle Earth dorm 
complex, said he will remember Miles' cheerfulness, which he attributed to "the 
fact that she had decided on something she wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
"She enjoyed (life) while she had it," he said. "I think we all wish that our 
lives were so complete." DANICA KIRKA

ALLEGATION DROPPED IN JUVENILE HALL CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE GEWERTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Civil rights lawyers who are challenging several practices in Juvenile Hall 
dropped another of their claims Thursday: the allegation that adolescents are 
wrongfully subjected to strip-searches. 
</P>
<P>
Their lawsuit originally had targeted procedures in Juvenile Hall and three 
outlying institutions: the Youth Guidance Center in Santa Ana, the Joplin Youth 
Center in Trabuco Canyon and the Los Pinos forestry camp in Cleveland National 
Forest. 
</P>
<P>
The strip-search allegation was the only one remaining against the three 
outlying institutions. The withdrawal of the allegation means that those three 
facilities are no longer targets of the case, which is in its fifth week of 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
A range of other complaints about the three facilities, including the 
censorship of minors' mail and difficulty getting access to lawyers, were 
dropped earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The Superior Court trial will now be limited to Juvenile Hall, focusing on such 
practices as tying adolescents to metal-frame beds or locking them in padded 
rooms when they misbehave. Mark I. Soler, an attorney for San Francisco's Youth 
Law Center, said he withdrew the strip-search allegation when it became clear 
that Juvenile Court judges often order such searches as a condition of 
confinement for teen-agers serving sentences. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney David G. Epstein, who represents the county, saw the dropping of the 
allegation as an admission that the plaintiffs would lose on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"They knew we had about 10 witnesses lined up who would testify that 
strip-searches are justified because contraband is often found," he said.

FELDHAUS WILL VIE FOR CITY COUNCIL SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA MASCARO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Planning Commissioner Frank E. Feldhaus Jr. has announced that he will run for 
City Council in November. 
</P>
<P>
Feldhaus, 61, a longtime Anaheim resident and businessman, is the first 
candidate to challenge the three incumbents who are expected to seek 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
A planning commissioner since 1987, Feldhaus said he wanted to get a head start 
on campaigning to have time to canvass the city. He criticized candidates who 
try to reach voters through mailers and other advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
"That's buying your way into the council," Feldhaus said. "That's not what I 
want to do." 
</P>
<P>
Though he will wait until later in the campaign to detail his goals and 
priorities for the city, he said personnel increases at the Police Department 
will be a main theme. 
</P>
<P>
The terms of council members Irv Pickler and Miriam Kaywood and Mayor Fred 
Hunter expire in November, and the three are likely to provide tough 
competition for Feldhaus. 
</P>
<P>
Allan B. Hughes, executive director of the Chamber of Commerce, praised 
Feldhaus' years of involvement in the city's business community and said the 
chamber's recently formed political action committee may consider endorsing 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Feldhaus estimates that a successful campaign will cost between $175,000 and 
$200,000, adding that he is willing to contribute about $25,000 to launch the 
effort. His first fund-raiser last week drew about 60 supporters; they donated 
about $8,000 to the campaign, he said. LISA MASCARO

CITY TO JOIN IN STUDY OF TRANSPORTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brea officials have decided to join Fullerton in a study of potential mass 
transit for those cities. 
</P>
<P>
"Both cities contain a number of retail, employment and institutional centers," 
Brea City Manager Frank Benest said. "The study will determine where these 
centers are and what kinds of modes of transportation would serve best." 
</P>
<P>
Of primary concern is linking the resulting transportation system to other 
systems around the county. 
</P>
<P>
Although there has been no discussion of what form the transit system would 
take, Benest said there was little doubt that it would go beyond buses. 
</P>
<P>
"Buses are just not adequate," he said.

A SERVICE FOR OFFICERS SLAIN ON JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Sgt. Paul McInerny, Thursday's memorial service honoring Garden Grove 
police officers killed in the line of duty held a special significance. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 10 years ago, McInerny, Officer Donald Reed and two reserve officers 
went to the Cripple Creek Bar to arrest a narcotics suspect. The incident 
turned violent when the suspect pulled out a semiautomatic handgun and opened 
fire, killing Reed and wounding the two reserve officers and two customers. 
McInerny was not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"A whole bunch of things went through my head," McInerny said. "You're the only 
officer who walks away unhurt, and you start to wonder why." 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by honor guards and four American flags, McInerny told the stories 
of Reed and three other police officers lost in the line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
Most who attended the third annual ceremony in front of the Garden Grove Police 
Department were relatives, colleagues or friends. 
</P>
<P>
"By being here, you give the police officers today a lift," McInerny told the 
group of about 100 people. 
</P>
<P>
The feeling was reflected among the family members of the three other officers 
who attended the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very proud," said Garden Grove resident Helen Rose Wharton, whose husband, 
reserve Officer Andy Reese, was killed in 1970 when he was struck by a car as 
he directed traffic during Garden Grove's Strawberry Festival Parade. 
</P>
<P>
Also at the ceremony was Lori Rainford, whose husband, Michael Rainford, was 
killed in 1980 when he was struck by a drunk driver as he was issuing a 
citation to another motorist on a ramp leading to the Garden Grove Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real hard," Lori Rainford said. "It makes you feel that people do 
remember -- they don't forget." 
</P>
<P>
She attended the ceremony with her daughter, Melissa, 7, and son, Michael, 9. 
She was pregnant with Michael when her husband was killed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to have these kind of services so he knows," she said. "He has a lot 
of pictures around the house. He knows a lot of guys around the department." 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief John Robertson unveiled a new plaque to honor the officers, which 
will be placed on stone markers bearing each of their names. 
</P>
<P>
"These people made the ultimate sacrifice," Robertson said. "As long as there's 
a Garden Grove, no one's going to forget that." 
</P>
<P>
Robertson's awareness of the dangers of police work came early in his life. His 
father, Ed, was the best friend of Sgt. Myron Trapp when both were among the 
first officers to join the Garden Grove Police Department in the late 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
In 1959, when John Robertson was only 7, Trapp was shot and killed in the line 
of duty. 
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony, John Robertson told Trapp's mother, Ruth Cawthon, 82, of 
Costa Mesa, that he remembered his father going to Trapp's grave every year to 
remember the all the good times they had. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a strong tie between police officers," said Trapp's brother, Harold, 
67. "You kind of unite to help tolerate the pressure. . . . It's like a giant 
brotherhood." ED JOHNSON

MIKE PENNER: TIME IS BIG MONEY IN WINFIELD'S EYES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MIKE PENNER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If it wasn't quite a six-day war, it was close. At the very least, it was the 
longest dramatic pause in baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a week after the Angels posed the question, Dave Winfield said yes. Yes 
to the uniform change, yes to the address change, yes to the name change. 
</P>
<P>
Now you know him as Dave Windfall. 
</P>
<P>
Time is money, they say, but until now, no one had the exact figures. How much 
is cab fare to limbo? Probably less than the $9.1 million Winfield stands to 
make after shrewdly sitting out six days in May. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield knew what he was doing when he didn't do anything. He knew it was a 
seller's market. The Angels did all the chasing in this one, which means all 
their practice in the American League West this season finally paid off. 
</P>
<P>
From the start, the Angels were enamored with everything about Winfield, from 
his stature in the lineup to his stature in the clubhouse to his surname. Win. 
Field. Lately, the Angels haven't done too much of either. 
</P>
<P>
What Winfield wanted to know is what's in it for Winfield. The Angels said a 
one-year contract extension, plus two option years. Total package: $9.1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Besides that, the Angels told him, there were fringe benefits. Bonuses. Perks. 
</P>
<P>
A partial listing . . . 
</P>
<P>
Old Friends: The manager, Doug Rader, is a teammate from their San Diego Padre 
days. The vice president, Mike Port, was in the Padre front office at the same 
time, moving his way up the organization and through his first thesaurus. And 
the left fielder, Luis Polonia, shared Yankee pinstripes with Winfield as 
recently as a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
Polonia has interesting opinions and when the Winfield trade-to-be-named-later 
was first announced last Friday, he wondered why the Angels would make such a 
deal. According to Polonia, Winfield can't play the outfield anymore. 
</P>
<P>
And, according to Andrew Dice Clay, Sam Kinison needs to clean up his act. 
</P>
<P>
New Fans: OK, so they arrive late, leave early, eat moths, like Rally Bells and 
sometimes root for the wrong team. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody's perfect. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Angel fans never require rabies shots and when they throw something on 
the field, a plastic beach ball is as bad as it gets. 
</P>
<P>
No knives, no rocks, no nuts, no bolts, no Duracell batteries. Everyone gets 
out alive. 
</P>
<P>
Improved Employee Relations: Meet the new boss. Not the same as the old Boss. 
</P>
<P>
The old boss fires managers who win 90 games. 
</P>
<P>
The new boss spends $16 million on pitchers who win 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
The old boss fires general managers who fail to bring home the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
The new boss promotes general managers who let Gold Glove catchers slip away 
for $1. 
</P>
<P>
The old boss sues you. 
</P>
<P>
The new boss woos you. 
</P>
<P>
And if you don't finish first, well, he thanks you for at least trying. 
</P>
<P>
Familiar Scenery: In other words, right field. 
</P>
<P>
Washington slept here. Chili was beaned here. Sacred ground, this is not. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Winfield has lost a step, even if his glove is more rust than gold, 
even if his back goes out again, he will be welcome here. 
</P>
<P>
Beautiful Working Facility: Otherwise known as Anaheim Stadium. Otherwise known 
as The House That The Rams Rebuilt. Just 33 pennants behind Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Not much history here -- no brag, just fact -- but that gives Winfield the 
opportunity to make some of his own. A rare opportunity too. How many of us are 
handed a clean slate at 38? 
</P>
<P>
Winfield will notice that Anaheim Stadium has no monuments in the outfield. 
Never has. A few statues from time to time, but never any monuments. 
</P>
<P>
Job Awareness Seminars: So you're interested in a high-paying career in the 
exciting field of Angel outfielding? You're not alone. 
</P>
<P>
Talk with those who have been there. Chili Davis. Devon White. Dante Bichette. 
Luis Polonia. Max Venable. 
</P>
<P>
Talk with those who still are there. Chili Davis. Devon White. Dante Bichette. 
Luis Polonia. Max Venable. 
</P>
<P>
Try together to solve this puzzling brain-teaser: How does six go into three 
and keep everybody smiling and in the lineup? 
</P>
<P>
Most likely, the trade for Winfield means another trade. The Angel outfield 
either needs a diamond lane or a couple less bodies, and right now, White's 
name is making the rounds again. Port could trade him, but he shouldn't trade 
him for Mookie Wilson and Nelson Liriano, the current hot rumor. 
</P>
<P>
Even at .200, White ought to command a higher return than a pair of mid-sized 
Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
Any more 10-5 guys out there? Give them six days and the Angels will give them 
the world.

GRAHAM WINS SINGLES AS STANFORD SWEEPS; 
</P>
<P>
TENNIS: SOPHOMORE FROM FOUNTAIN VALLEY WON'T BE OVERLOOKED ANYMORE AFTER 
ROLLING TO NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP WITHOUT LOSING A SET.

<P>
Stanford's Debbie Graham, a sophomore from Fountain Valley, won the singles 
final in straight sets Thursday and the Cardinal became the first team to sweep 
all three titles at the NCAA Women's Tennis Championships. 
</P>
<P>
The sixth-seeded Graham beat seventh-seeded Nicole Arendt of Florida, 6-3, 6-3. 
In the doubles final, Meredith McGrath and Teri Whitlinger of Stanford rallied 
to defeat teammates Graham and Sandra Birch, 4-6, 7-5, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, the Cardinal won its seventh NCAA team title. Stanford is the 
first team in the nine-year history of the event to capture the team, singles 
and doubles championships in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
Graham, a graduate of Los Amigos High School, pulled away from a 3-3 tie in the 
first set by winning 12 of the final 13 points from Arendt. 
</P>
<P>
"The first set was so important for me to win," Graham said. "I knew if I 
played a very aggressive game, kept the pressure on her and worked her nerves a 
bit, I could get up on the first set." 
</P>
<P>
Big ground strokes and timely passing shots helped Graham take a 4-0 lead in 
the second set and she broke serve twice to clinch the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"She just outsmarted me," Arendt said. 
</P>
<P>
Until this week, Graham didn't even rate as second fiddle at Stanford. Most of 
the attention went to McGrath, ranked atop the rankings most of the season, and 
reigning national singles champion Sandra Birch. But McGrath lost in the 
tournament's second round and Graham upset Birch in Wednesday's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Graham, who did not lose a set during the tournament, said being overlooked was 
a motivating factor. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever anyone ever thinks about Stanford tennis, it's always Sandra and 
Meredith and I'm sitting at number three." Graham said. "I wanted to prove to 
everyone that Stanford is not just its one and two players." 
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded doubles team of McGrath and Whitlinger, who entered the 
tournament with a 26-0 record, lost the first set and trailed, 4-1 and 5-4, in 
the second set before they rallied. 
</P>
<P>
"When we lost the first set, we were both thinking how terrible it would be to 
come this far and have just one loss, in the national championship," McGrath 
said. "When we were down, we concentrated not so much on playing great shots, 
but on playing more consistently, and that got us back on track."

BUCK STOPS HERE; HE FAILS TO QUALIFY; 
</P>
<P>
TRACK: DANA HILLS SOPHOMORE, CENTER OF CONTROVERSY AFTER DISQUALIFICATION, 
DOESN'T EARN SPOT IN FINAL DURING RE-RUNNING OF HURDLES.

After five days of controversy, Jeremy Buck's quest for a spot in tonight's 
Southern Section track and field championships came to an uneventful finish 
Thursday when he failed to qualify in the re-running of the boys' 4-A 300-meter 
intermediate hurdles preliminary at Gahr High School. 
</P>
<P>
Buck, a Dana Hills High School sophomore who was disqualified for running 
around a hurdle in the original preliminary race Saturday, was granted a 
reprieve Monday by Southern Section Commissioner Stan Thomas. After viewing a 
videotape of the race, Thomas ruled that Buck had been misled by an improperly 
placed hurdle and that the race would have to be run again. 
</P>
<P>
The National Federation of State High Schools approved the re-running, but 
ruled Wednesday that not one but all four heats would have to be re-run. 
</P>
<P>
All but three of the 33 original preliminary entrants showed up Thursday for 
the re-run, knowing that they would have to either win their heat or be among 
the next five fastest overall to advance to tonight's 7:50 final at Cerritos 
College. 
</P>
<P>
Only one of the original qualifiers -- Vince Grant of Muir, the second-fastest 
intermediate hurdler in the state -- failed to qualify Thursday. Ian Humphrey 
of Cajon (seventh-fastest at 39.03) gained a berth he had not originally 
earned. 
</P>
<P>
Buck said he was running in a pair of borrowed spikes that were 2 1/2 sizes too 
small. One of his spikes, he said, was stolen from the Dana Hills locker room. 
</P>
<P>
He got a good start but hit the first two hurdles. As he came off the final 
turn, Buck was in good position to win the heat but then, after scrambling his 
steps before the final hurdle, he was nipped at the finish by Bill Ephram of 
Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
Ephram's time of 39.39 seconds was the slowest of all nine qualifiers. Buck's 
time (39.62) was the 14th-fastest overall. 
</P>
<P>
Buck, who said he received "a lot of dirty looks," from several of the hurdlers 
while warming up, did not seem to be tremendously disappointed once he heard 
his time and learned his chances of qualifying were slim. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have that good of a race," said Buck, the South Coast League 
champion. "I'm just happy I did good in league." 
</P>
<P>
John Klink, the Dana Hills hurdles coach and athletic director who filed the 
protest on Buck's behalf, was not quite as nonchalant: "He looked down at the 
last hurdle. He's supposed to look up at the finish line. . . . Oh well, no one 
feels worse than him." 
</P>
<P>
But Grant was certainly feeling pretty miserable. As a senior with a personal 
best time of 37.9, Grant ran a disappointing 39.25 -- 10th overall -- making 
him the alternate for tonight's race. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel awful. I feel real bad," said Grant, who will compete tonight as part 
of Muir's top-seeded 1,600-meter relay team. "Words can't say how bad I feel. 
We (the Muir boys' team) were picked to win CIF. I was an important factor. Now 
it's going to be close. . . . Now I just feel like it's all gone. I can't 
believe I didn't qualify." 
</P>
<P>
Other qualifiers, and their times, were: Cajon's Charles Johnson (38.00), 
Keadrick Washington of Rowland (38.29), Jabari Reynolds of Nogales (38.38), 
Demond Smith of Hawthorne (38.57), David Fair of El Toro (38.81), Derek Ferrell 
of Muir (38.81) and Avery Anderson of Riverside North (39.20).

South Torrance 1, Capistrano Valley 0 -- South Torrance only had two hits, but 
it did have a hometown wind in its favor. 
</P>
<P>
South Torrance's Gillian Boxx hit a lazy fly to right field that looked to be 
the final out of the sixth inning. But the ball sailed away from Capistrano 
Valley's Shelly Smith and popped out of her glove for an error, scoring Angela 
Bean from second base. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the game, a strong breeze blew from the West. South Torrance right 
fielder Tammy Hertica also made an error on a windblown fly ball, but the 
mistake didn't cost the Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
"Right field can be a killer in this ballpark," South Torrance Coach Larry Lent 
said. "It didn't hurt us any today, but it hurt them, and that was the 
difference in the game." 
</P>
<P>
It also gave South Torrance its first playoff victory in softball in 33 years. 
The Spartans (18-3) tied West Torrance for the Ocean League championship, but 
went into the playoffs as the league's No. 2 entry after losing a coin flip. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley, the fourth-place team from the South Coast League, entered 
the playoffs as an at-large team and finished the season at 15-11. 
</P>
<P>
For three innings, Capistrano Valley freshman Daniela Hugelshofer kept South 
Torrance off-balance. She allowed only one hit before giving way to senior 
Jennifer Smith (10-10), who struck out four in three innings. 
</P>
<P>
Smith gave up only one hit, an infield chopper between the pitcher and first 
base by Bean in the sixth. Bean advanced to second on Monica Emmrich's 
groundout, then Boxx, South Torrance's best hitter at .529, hit the fly ball 
that won the game. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Julie DeJaifre (6-1) went the distance for South Torrance, allowing only 
Hugelshofer's hit down the first-base line in the fourth. DeJaifre, who missed 
six weeks of the regular season with a broken bone in her left foot, struck out 
two. 
</P>
<P>
South Torrance will play either Bellflower (22-6) or Covina (14-5) in the 
second round Tuesday. STUART MATTHEWS

STRONG PITCHING KEYS KENNEDY, GARDEN GROVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
This year's Southern Section 4-A softball final just might be an all-Garden 
Grove League affair. Orange County powers Kennedy, the 4-A division's 
second-seeded team, and fourth-seeded Garden Grove could meet in the 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
First-round 4-A games are scheduled for 3 p.m. today, with Kennedy (21-3-1) at 
home against La Habra (15-11) and Garden Grove (21-4-1) at home against Sunny 
Hills (11-12). 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy and Garden Grove, co-champions of the Garden Grove League, are evenly 
matched as evidenced by a 20-inning, 1-1 tie in their first meeting. Kennedy 
won the second game, 1-0, in 11 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy won the division title two years ago and lost to Western in the 
semifinals last year. Both years, pitcher Cheryl Longeway helped the Fighting 
Irish advance. Longeway, now a junior, is 16-2-1 with 159 strikeouts and an 
0.22 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove has Orange County's strikeout leader, senior Stephanie (Smitty) 
Smith, who has struck out 282, a school record. She is 21-4-1 with an 0.07 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Another 4-A contender is third-seeded Buena Park (16-3-2). The Coyotes won 
their first Freeway League championship since 1976. Buena Park is led by senior 
pitcher Shannon Akau (16-3), who has an 0.16 ERA with 176 strikeouts, and 
senior catcher Kari Escobedo, a .417 hitter. 
</P>
<P>
The top three teams in the Orange League -- Savanna (23-7), Valencia (20-9) and 
Western (13-18) -- don't appear to have the pitching to contend with Kennedy or 
Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
The Century League entrants might have a little better luck. Canyon (21-6) 
ranked fifth in the final county coaches' poll and shared the Century League 
championship with Villa Park (13-10-1). 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the county entrants in 4-A are Pacifica (12-8) and Sunny Hills. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1-A division, Santa Margarita (14-3) travels to Huntington Park to meet 
St. Matthias (5-6-1) and Calvary Chapel travels to Los Angeles to take on Notre 
Dame Academy (12-7). 
</P>
<P>
In the small schools division, Liberty Christian (17-4) is at home against 
Providence (9-4-1). 
</P>
<P>
In Division 4-A play Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park 3, Fontana 0 -- Munique Hernandez (12-4) pitched a three-hitter, 
struck out six and walked one to lead host Villa Park (14-10-1). Fontana is 
13-9.Michele D'Amato had one hit, one RBI and Robyn Kerfoot had two hits and 
scored a run for Villa Park.

TUSTIN RALLIES IN SEVENTH TO TIE, THEN KNOCKS OUT SECOND-SEEDED IRVINE

<P>
Unseeded Tustin High School, after being held hitless for six innings, tied the 
score with a run on two hits in the seventh inning and scored two in the eighth 
to defeat Irvine, 3-1, Thursday at Heritage Park in Irvine and knock the 
second-seeded Vaqueros out of the Southern Section 3-A softball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's Jennifer Brundage hadn't allowed a hit until Shannon Ellis led off the 
top of the seventh with a single. Christine Garner followed with another single 
and Kim Kolina's sacrifice bunt moved the runners to second and third. Ellis 
then scored on a passed ball by Irvine catcher Lisa Goodwin. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin (15-9) scored two in the eighth as Irvine committed two errors and two 
passed balls. Ellis drove in the second run with a single. 
</P>
<P>
Brundage (21-3), who allowed only six earned runs all season, struck out 10 and 
walked none for Irvine (24-4), which had finished the regular season ranked No. 
2 in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin pitcher Ellis struck out eight and walked one. 
</P>
<P>
In other 3-A playoff games: 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback 4, Mission Viejo 1 -- Desi Abrego, the shortest player on Saddleback 
High School's softball team, was a giant on the mound. The 5-foot-1 sophomore 
held Mission Viejo to four hits and struck out 14. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback (20-2) will play the winner of the Ramona-Alta Loma game. Mission 
Viejo ended the season at 17-10. 
</P>
<P>
Leann Larriva's home run in the third inning gave Saddleback a 1-0 lead. 
Mission Viejo, which reached the 3-A final last year, self-destructed in the 
fourth inning by committing two errors that led to three runs. 
</P>
<P>
Kristen Harrison came on in relief of Mission Viejo starter Jodi Lemire to open 
the fourth. She hit the first batter she faced, Priscilla Sarmiento. After 
Abrego popped out, Nikkanni Andrews singled and Sarmiento stopped at second. 
Amber Smith drilled a shot back to Harrison, whose throw to first was wild, 
allowing Sarmiento and Andrews to score. 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Jennifer Ward then threw out Kim Carstens, but first baseman April 
Snyder's wild throw to second allowed Smith to score the fourth Saddleback run. 
</P>
<P>
The Diablos' run came in the sixth when Snyder scored from second on Tamar 
deFries' single. DENNIS KAISER

NEWPORT HARBOR'S HOPES THWARTED BY SWATIK'S KILLS

<P>
Dan Glenn, Newport Harbor boys' volleyball coach, wore a worried look when he 
watched Mira Costa's team warming up for its Southern Section 4-A quarterfinal 
game Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
"All we have to do," Glenn said, "is stop the best player in the nation (David 
Swatik) and the best team." 
</P>
<P>
The Sailors failed to do either and Mira Costa, ranked No. 1 nationally by 
Volleyball Monthly, rallied in all but the last game for a 15-11, 16-14, 15-5 
victory at Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa, the 4-A runner-up in 1987 and 1989, advances to the semifinals 
against the winner of Friday night's Laguna Beach-San Marcos game. 
</P>
<P>
Swatik had 17 kills and four blocks and Pat Ivie, the younger brother of USC 
and United States national team member Bryan Ivie, had 13 to lead Mira Costa 
(16-0). Alex Opoulos and Ian Juberg each had 11 kills to lead Newport Harbor 
(11-6). 
</P>
<P>
"Swatik had the kills that counted," Glenn said after the game. "That's why 
he's a great player." 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa Coach Mike Cook said his team struggled in Newport Harbor's small, 
noisy gym. 
</P>
<P>
"We toughed it out," he said. "This was a tough place to play. The Newport 
crowd made a lot of noise and our kids couldn't communicate. Newport gave us an 
excellent test in the first two games." 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa rallied from a 9-4 deficit in the first game. Swatik had four kills 
and Mike Ashenfelter had two blocks as the Mustangs capitalized on four Newport 
Harbor hitting errors in an 11-2 run. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs trailed again early in the second game. They fought back from 
deficits of 5-0 and 10-5 and fought off game point to tie it at 14-14. 
Consecutive kills by Mark Shoptaw and Brian Thurston gave the Mustangs a 16-14 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't lose this game," Glenn said. "They beat us. I just wish we could 
have had that second game back. 
</P>
<P>
"We got stuck on nine in the first game and 10 in the second game. Mira Costa 
is a real good team and if you make mistakes against them, they'll capitalize 
on you." 
</P>

Mira Costa didn't have to bother with a comeback in the third game. The 
Mustangs built a 6-0 lead and let Newport Harbor no closer than five.

YOUTH IS ALREADY SERVING AT CORONA DEL MAR;

CORONA DEL MAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charlie Brande looked at the Corona del Mar High School boys' volleyball roster 
last March and wondered what was left of his defending Southern Section 4-A 
championship team. 
</P>
<P>
There wasn't much. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take all of Brande's 15 years of coaching experience for him to 
understand that the Sea Kings were in for a rough season. 
</P>
<P>
They lost their top nine players from last year's team, and they were so young 
-- only three seniors -- that their roster looked like a junior varsity team. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar opened with losses to Marina and Huntington Beach. The Sea Kings 
blew a two-games-to-one lead to Marina and were swept by Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We've come a long way since then," Brande said. "A long way." 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings have won their second consecutive Sea View League title and have 
reached the quarterfinals of the Southern Section 4-A tournament, where they 
will meet Edison at 7:30 tonight at the Corona del Mar gym. 
</P>
<P>
It will be the first meeting this season between Edison, 15-1 and ranked second 
in 4-A, and Corona del Mar, 10-5 and ranked seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Edison Coach Brian Rofer said he wished he knew more about his team's opponent. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm kind of at a loss for words," he said. "I never thought we would meet them 
at this point of the season. I think maybe I should have paid more attention to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Rofer's not the only one surprised by the Sea Kings' success. 
</P>
<P>
After an 0-2 start, Brande has blended a winning formula from a lineup of five 
sophomores, three juniors and three seniors. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been times this year when we have had a senior, a junior and four 
sophomores on the court," Brande said. "I thought we could be competitive by 
the end of the year. I thought it would take some time. 
</P>
<P>
"The younger kids are athletes and they've been involved with a winning 
basketball team. That makes for a competitive atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Included in that group of all-around athletes are Matt Herrington, Matt 
Cwiertnia, Chris Pliha and Ty Price, an all-Southern Section selection at 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Carter Reece, a senior and one of only two returning varsity players, said 
Brande has "handled this year's team with the same maturity as last year." 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of winners last year," Reece said. "He had time to groom those 
guys into the perfect team. He's had to do the same with us in only a year." 
</P>
<P>
Brande said this year's team needed time to mature. 
</P>
<P>
"All the sophomores are the fighters. It's tough for a sophomore, or someone 
like Jon Upham, who's new, to lead." 
</P>
<P>
Upham, a 6-foot-5 junior, is playing his first season of volleyball. He and 
sophomore outside hitter Doug Hesse played for the Sea Kings' basketball team, 
which reached the Southern Section 3-A championship game. They both made the 
all-Sea View League second team. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to teach the game to Jon because he hadn't played until 2 1/2 months 
ago," Brande said. "For the coaches to put him on the all-league team has shown 
how far he has come." 
</P>
<P>
But it has been the consistent play of seniors Reece, Clark Brogger and Steve 
Olsen that has given the younger and inexperienced players time to develop. All 
three players were first-team all-Sea View League selections. 
</P>
<P>
Reece, a 6-5 middle blocker who will attend UC Santa Barbara, averages 15 kills 
a match and was the league's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
"I always kid him that he's a middle hitter instead of a blocker," Brande said. 
"Against University earlier this year, he had 15 kills in only 19 attempts. As 
he goes, we go." 
</P>
<P>
Olsen, a 6-foot setter, averaged 30 set assists a match. 
</P>
<P>
"Steve's been in our program for a number of years," Brande said. "He was our 
serving specialist last year and he has a good idea of what was happening. I 
figured by the time the (Southern Section) tournament came around, he would be 
a pretty good setter." 
</P>
<P>
Brogger, a 6-2 outside hitter, averages 11 kills a game. Brande said Brogger's 
all-around game is one of the main reasons why the Sea Kings are contenders. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing Clark does is pass 75% of our balls," Brande said. "To put it 
subtly, that's where you win. He's our team captain and he keeps us together." 
</P>
<P>
Reece said he, Olsen and Brogger weren't used to the leadership roles. He and 
Olsen were reserves last year and Brogger was on the junior varsity. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to learn to take charge," Reece said. "Last year we weren't in charge 
of anything. I played behind (Jason) Perkins (who started on USC's national 
championship team this year) and Pliha. Last year I was all talk. This year I'm 
actually doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Reece and Brande say the Sea Kings' record is deceptive. Their five losses have 
been to top 10 teams -- Marina, Huntington Beach, Laguna Beach, Woodbridge and 
Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Edison, meanwhile, has defeated Marina, Huntington Beach and Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"How they match up to us will determine the outcome," Rofer said. "They're not 
a real big team and they're young. We're playing with a lot of composure right 
now. We start five seniors and I think our size can come into play." 
</P>
<P>
Brande said the Sea Kings are wary of Edison's Karl Van Reusen, a middle 
blocker who is known for intimidating opponents with finger-pointing and verbal 
taunts as well as his powerful hitting. 
</P>
<P>
"I think his being out of control helps us," Brande said. "Our kids don't like 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Reece said Edison is "a loud team." 
</P>
<P>
"They talk a lot and that will fire us up," he said. "It's not our style to 
talk under the net." 
</P>
<P>
But Brande doesn't expect to put a stoic group of players on the court Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"If we play with a lot of emotion and intensity, we can give them a good 
match," Brande said. "We're lucky it's at our place. Those three seniors 
looking at this as possibly their last match might be enough motivation for 
us."

U.S. EXPORTS INCREASE TO RECORD LEVELS; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: THE GOOD SHOWING ABROAD IS TEMPERED BY A SURGE OF IMPORTS THAT PUSHED 
THE NATION'S TRADE IMBALANCE TO $8.4 BILLION. 
</P>

<P>
Sales of American-made goods overseas jumped to record levels in March, the 
Commerce Department reported Thursday, but a surge in imports widened the 
nation's trade deficit to $8.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Economists expressed little alarm at March's trade imbalance, which was 
slightly higher than expected after a revised $6.1-billion deficit in February. 
But they hailed the strong export showing as a clear signal of increasing 
economic strength. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear that foreign exports are giving momentum to the U.S. economy now," 
said Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch in New York, noting that 
exports during the first quarter were 11% higher than a year earlier. "If they 
keep that up, there's no way the economy can fall into a recession this year." 
</P>
<P>
In another encouraging sign, the United States' trade deficit with Japan posted 
its first significant decline since the U.S.-Japan trade imbalance emerged as a 
serious international and political irritant in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter of 1989, the deficit with Japan was $12.4 billion, the 
Commerce Department reported. The figure dropped to $9.6 billion this year, an 
impressive 23% decline. 
</P>
<P>
"The monthly deficit number was worse, but the underpinnings of this report 
means a stronger economy," said economist Allen Sinai of the Boston Co. "The 
record high exports are very encouraging and that says strong economic growth 
overseas is helping our exports and providing an important prop to growth in 
our economy." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, last month's increase in the trade deficit was exaggerated by seasonal 
adjustments as well as by the previous month's unusually favorable figures. 
February imports were at their lowest level in a year as U.S. importers and 
retailers worked off inventory, while exports were boosted by a surge of 
overseas aircraft sales in the wake of last fall's Boeing strike. 
</P>
<P>
Aircraft exports declined somewhat in March. But other exports, primarily 
manufactured goods, easily made up the difference, the government reported. 
</P>
<P>
The big gains in exports, which reached a record $33.3 billion in March, were 
led by computers, telecommunications equipment, scientific instruments and 
other high-technology manufactured products, industrial supplies and even 
automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
Although March imports of $41.7 billion were second only to a peak reached last 
October, the first-quarter import total was running only 5.5% above the same 
period in 1989 -- roughly half the growth rate for exports. 
</P>
<P>
"In the next few months, imports are not going to rise this fast again, because 
domestic demand is weak . . . , especially for consumer goods and big-ticket 
consumer durables," said Merrill Lynch's Steinberg. "And that's what we have 
been buying from Japan." 
</P>
<P>
The nation's trade deficit averaged just under $8 billion a month during the 
first quarter, and economists said that it now appears the deficit will finish 
the year in the $95-billion range. Until recently, most analysts were 
predicting only minuscule improvement over last year's $108.9-billion deficit, 
which averaged slightly more than $9 billion a month. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Lewis, an international economics and trade specialist with the National 
Assn. of Manufacturers, noted that most of the improvement in U.S. trade in the 
past few years has been in exports to other industrial countries. 
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of 1989, for example, the United States posted a trade 
surplus of just under $900 million with the European Common Market. This year, 
the first-quarter surplus with the Europeans was $2.1 billion. It was $1 
billion in March alone. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis noted that economic problems in most developing countries largely have 
eliminated any demand on their part for U.S. manufactured goods. A global 
expansion of agricultural production, meanwhile, has made it much tougher for 
American farmers to find steady markets for U.S. grain in non-industrial 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, U.S. dependence on foreign oil has resumed the upward march that 
was interrupted by the oil price and supply disruptions of the 1970s, and fuel 
has become a steadily growing trade deficit item. 
</P>
<P>
In March, oil imports were nominally the same as in February at $4.8 billion, 
but a slight decline in price masked an actual increase of 18 million barrels 
to a monthly total of 261 million barrels.

'BURNED OUT' HEAD OF HOBIE SPORTS WILL LEAVE COMPANY

<P>
The president of Hobie Sports, a chain of retail surf-wear shops in California 
and Hawaii, said Thursday that he is quitting because he is "just burned out." 
</P>
<P>
Tony Mardian, an executive for 12 years with the chain and president for the 
past two years, said he plans to stay with the company through July to help 
with the transition to an as-yet-unnamed successor. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just ready to move on," said Mardian, who is the son of Robert C. Mardian, 
the former U.S. assistant attorney general best known for his role in the 
Watergate scandal. His father was a lawyer in the reelection campaign of former 
President Richard M. Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
As for his plans, the San Clemente resident said, "I'm going to take the summer 
and think about it." 
</P>
<P>
Hobie Sports has seven stores in California and six in Hawaii, with about 70% 
of its sales in clothing. It is one of a series of independent, separate 
businesses that hold licenses to use the name of Hobie. The brand name was made 
famous by surfboard and catamaran pioneer Hobie Alter in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Mardian, 38, said his proudest accomplishments as president were overseeing the 
company's growth, updating the accounting systems and developing the chain's 
own private line of clothing, Hawaiian Sun. 
</P>
<P>
He came to the company's Irvine headquarters from Hawaii, where he had gone to 
open a Hobie store in Kona. 
</P>
<P>
He said that no successor has been named but that the list of candidates for 
president has been narrowed to three. 
</P>
<P>
Mardian said he leaves the company in strong financial shape. "The surf 
industry in general had a very flat first quarter" of 1990, he said. "We fared 
well because of our ladies' sales." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he said, sales in general have bounced back and "business is fine."

BUYERS SNAP UP COUNTRIFIED LOTS AT COTO DE CAZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by John O'Dell, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ever wonder who buys the custom residential lots the folks at Coto de Caza put 
on the block every so often? And where the money comes from? 
</P>
<P>
Well, it isn't the county's doctors and lawyers using up their reserves of 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
In the past three weeks, 72 single-family lots have been sold in the 
undeveloped south half of the gated community in the hills behind Mission 
Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
And most of the acre-plus properties have been acquired by "entrepreneurs and 
high-level executives," says Rod Gilliland, vice president of sales and 
marketing for the California division of Florida's Arvida Co., owner of Coto de 
Caza. 
</P>
<P>
"These are people in their mid-40s who either own their own businesses or are 
way up in the corporate hierarchy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that the corporate types are most interested in the 4,000-acre 
development's countrified lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
And because Arvida's rules preclude contingency sales -- an agreement to buy a 
home only if your former home is sold by a certain date -- most buyers 
apparently are using equity from the sale of recently sold business or 
residential properties, savings or investment profits to gain entry. 
</P>
<P>
The portrait of a custom lot buyer at Coto de Caza is rounded out with these 
observations from Gilliland: 
</P>
<P>
* 20% pay cash. 
</P>
<P>
* Of those who finance their purchase, few make down payments larger than the 
25% minimum required by Arvida. 
</P>
<P>
* Virtually all are from South Orange County, with Mission Viejo providing the 
bulk of the buyers. 
</P>
<P>
* Almost half are embarking on their first experience with custom home 
building; the rest have already had at least one previous custom home and a few 
are on their third or even fourth. 
</P>
<P>
In coming years, Gilliland said, Coto de Caza plans to sell about 350 more 
custom lots. He said that nearly 2,000 people have signed up to be notified of 
lot sales, which are conducted on a first-come, first-served basis. 
</P>
<P>
On April 25, when the first 44 lots went up for sale, about 300 prospective 
buyers showed up, and all the lots were gone in four hours -- at prices ranging 
from $150,000 to $335,000. An additional 250 buyers turned up May 11, when 32 
lots were sold in 2 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the price of the lot -- which has been averaging about $250,000 
-- buyers also have to build a home. 
</P>
<P>
And while the minimum acceptable size is 3,000 square feet of living space, 
Gilliland said most exceed that size. 
</P>
<P>
"The typical home here is not built on a shoestring budget," is the way he 
politely put it. Most of the community's custom-built homes are in the 4,500- 
to 6,000-square-foot range and cost from $350,000 to $550,000. Add in the lot 
value and a little bit of appreciation and most of the properties will be worth 
at least $1 million when the owners move in, Gilliland said. 
</P>
<P>
If all that is too rich for your blood, Coto de Caza's plans also call for 
2,500 to 3,000 "production homes," a mix of attached and single-family styles. 
Prices are expected to start in the high $200,000s. 
</P>
<P>
There also is a batch of new production homes for sale in the community, with 
prices starting in the high $200,000s and going well past $1 million.

NURSES GET PRIZES, PERKS AND BONUSES TO TAKE JOBS; 
</P>
<P>
COMPETITION: HOSPITALS AND HEALTH-CARE AGENCIES ARE RESORTING TO A VARIETY OF 
RECRUITING GIMMICKS BECAUSE OF A NATIONAL NURSING SHORTAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sometime this fall, a chauffeured limousine will pull up to South Coast Plaza 
in Costa Mesa and out will step a grand-prize winner with $5,000 to start a 
four-hour shopping spree. 
</P>
<P>
No, the lucky shopper won't be a radio show contestant or a participant from a 
revival of the "Queen for a Day" television show. It will be a nurse from FHP 
Inc., a health maintenance organization in Fountain Valley that is rewarding 
nurses who recruit others for the company. The winner will be drawn in 
September from the names of FHP nurses who bring in new hires. 
</P>
<P>
Since FHP began a new recruitment award program in March, nurses who recruit 
their peers have also been eligible for drawings for a camera, a portable 
compact-disc player and a VCR. And the company is giving away $500 for every 
full-time registered or licensed vocational nurse and $250 for every part-time 
nurse. 
</P>
<P>
A severe nationwide nursing shortage is prompting FHP and other health-care 
companies and hospitals to pull out the stops. They are offering bonuses of up 
to $4,000 for nursing recruits and other bonuses for staff nurses who bring in 
new recruits. 
</P>
<P>
The stakes are high. The number of hospital nursing vacancies statewide has 
more than doubled from 2,757 in 1983 to 6,770 currently. In Southern 
California, 11.5% of full-time positions for registered nurses were vacant in 
1988, according to the latest available data from the California Assn. of 
Hospital and Health Systems. 
</P>
<P>
The problem has been exacerbated by a four-year decline in nationwide nursing 
school enrollments, according to the California Nurses Assn. 
</P>
<P>
As career options for women have expanded, fewer have embraced nursing. At the 
same time, demand for registered nurses has grown with the proliferation of 
home health-care services and the changing role of hospitals, which are 
treating patients who are more acutely ill. 
</P>
<P>
So hospitals are flexing their recruiting muscles, and none more than White 
Memorial Medical Center, a 377-bed nonprofit hospital in Los Angeles. In 
addition to a $2,000 sign-up bonus, White Memorial offers nursing recruits free 
maid service at their homes for a year. 
</P>
<P>
Such marketing gimmicks have drawn mixed response. Critics say they blemish the 
professional image of nursing and distract from efforts to increase nurses' 
wages and improve their working conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"Gimmicks are not going to solve the nursing shortage. Nurses need more say and 
more pay rather than a VCR," said Maureen Anderson, spokeswoman for the 
California Nurses Assn., a nurses' union. 
</P>
<P>
The union is pushing for higher salaries for senior nurses, a stronger voice in 
hospital policy and the hiring of non-medical staff to perform everyday tasks 
that don't require trained nurses, such as transporting patients in wheelchairs 
and distributing meals. 
</P>
<P>
St. Joseph Hospital in Orange scoffs at recruitment incentives as mere 
gimmickry. "They are all substitutes for salary and have the potential of 
preventing salary raises," said Judy Burton, the hospital's vice president of 
nursing. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, many hospital recruiters argue that bonuses are effective 
recruitment tools. 
</P>
<P>
They say that referral bonuses are a less-expensive way to recruit nurses than 
advertising in newspapers or hiring nurses by the hour from private nurse 
registries, which supply them for a fee. Registries tend to charge 40% more 
than staff nurses at hospitals receive. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Kelley, manager of professional staffing at FHP, said the $5,000 shopping 
spree contest helped make employees aware of the hospital's referral bonuses. 
She said 10 nurses have been hired as a result of the promotion. 
</P>
<P>
"In any marketing campaign, you have to have a calling card to draw them in," 
said Beverly Morris, a nurse recruiter at White Memorial in Los Angeles. The 
hospital has signed on 35 new nurses since it began offering free maid service 
to recruits last October. It has also received numerous inquiries from other 
Southern California hospitals that are considering instituting a similar 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Morris said the hospital also offers a $2,000 sign-up bonus and $750 to staff 
nurses who direct bilingual registered nurses to the hospital, which is located 
in predominantly Latino East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Morris said job applicants are aware of the perks and not shy to ask about 
them. "One of the first things they ask is: 'Do you have sign-up bonuses?' " 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not unusual for young nurses today to just move around and get what they 
can," agreed Phyllis Fliegel, a nurse recruiter for Kaiser Permanente, Southern 
California's largest health maintenance organization. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser offers $1,000 "finder's fees" to any of its employees who help Kaiser 
recruit for hard-to-fill positions such as nurse managers and certified nurse 
anesthesiologists. "It works fantastically well," Fliegel said. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Kato, a recruiter at Martin Luther Hospital in Anaheim and La Palma 
Intercommunity Hospital in La Palma, said she relies heavily on employee 
referals. As an incentive, she said, the hospitals pay $1,000 to both a new 
recruit and the nurse who made the referral.

Chapman General Hospital in Orange has hired five or six nurses since it began 
offering a $2,500 referral bonus 18 months ago. "In a small facility, that 
really helps," hospital administrator John Kramer said. 
</P>
<P>
Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach also uses perks to attract nurses. This month, 
the hospital doubled its finder's fee from $250 to $500. It also recruits 
nurses on a temporary basis from other parts of the country, paying their 
transportation and living expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Health-care officials say that wooing nurses is just part of their task. 
Equally important, they say, is persuading them not to stray to another 
employer who may offer attractive incentives. 
</P>
<P>
During the past couple of years, White Memorial has boosted its educational 
benefits for nurses, given them more decision-making power and increased wages, 
Morris said. As a result, the hospital's nurse vacancy rate has fallen from 
between 17% and 21% to between 10% and 12%. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is retention. Otherwise you will have a revolving door, no 
matter what you offer," said David Langness, vice president of communications 
for the Hospital Council of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Langness said the council advises hospitals that they could save millions of 
dollars spent on recruitment ads and marketing ploys if they instead took steps 
to increase the number of people entering the nursing profession. 
</P>
<P>
The council has organized a health career information center that, among other 
things, points out to job seekers that salaries for Southern California nurses 
rose 17% in the last two years. The average annual pay for a staff nurse in the 
region now is $35,214, according to the most recent council survey, while a few 
nurses with special training and experience make more than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a slight increase in nursing school enrollments last fall, many 
professional recruiters expect the shortage to worsen as hospitals continue to 
compete for nursing talent with other health-care providers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will get worse before it gets better," said Ruth Spears, employment 
manager at St. Joseph Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
GROWING NURSE SHORTAGE 
</P>
<P>
The number of openings for registered nurses in California hospitals steadily 
increased from 1983 to 1988. Figures for 1989 are not available, though most 
experts say the shortage continues to be acute. The shortage in Southern 
California is estimated to be nearly three percentage points higher than in the 
rest of the state.

ART GROUPS UNITE IN FIGHT TO SAVE THE NEA; 
</P>
<P>
CENSORSHIP: AS LEGISLATION IS DRAFTED TO CONTINUE THE CONTROVERSIAL ENDOWMENT 
ANOTHER 5 YEARS, SUPPORT FOR NEA IS RUNNING 9-TO-1 IN ITS FAVOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Representatives of 17 major arts organizations have been summoned to a rare 
Capitol Hill summit conference next Tuesday to try to forge a unified proposal 
to extend the legislative lifetime of the National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was called Thursday afternoon by Rep. Pat Williams (D-Mont.), 
chairman of a House subcommittee that is drafting legislation to continue the 
NEA for another five years. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Williams and other sources in Congress said some initial 
signs have emerged that arts groups have finally begun to effectively counter 
an onslaught of mail and media initiatives undertaken by opponents of the NEA. 
Williams said mail to his office, which had been overwhelmingly in opposition 
to the NEA over the endowment's role in funding controversial artworks last 
year, has reversed course in the last three weeks and is now running 9-to-1 in 
favor of the endowment. From Williams's home district in western Montana -- a 
rural bastion -- Williams said the ratio is still 3-to-1 pro-NEA. 
</P>
<P>
Included among the arts summit participants are such mainstream organizations 
as the American Assn. of Museums, American Arts Alliance and the American 
Council on the Arts. Also included were more traditionally grassroots 
organizations such as the National Assn. of Artist Organizations, representing 
artist-run agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The roster also listed activist arts-political groups such as the National 
Campaign for Freedom of Expression and Coalition of Writers Organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The Williams proposal emerged in the midst of a raging controversy over the 
NEA's future and after, Williams said, he concluded the turmoil has made it 
impossible to move ahead with an NEA extension bill proposed by President Bush 
that would renew the NEA's mandate, but reject federally mandated controls over 
the content of NEA-funded artworks. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as early this week, Williams had planned to hold a subcommittee 
session to make final editing changes in the Bush bill next Wednesday. But at a 
press conference and in a telephone interview Thursday, Williams said the 
intensity of the political controversy over the NEA forced him to abandon the 
plan and, in effect, give the nation's arts community an ultimatum to come up 
with a consensus plan to save the NEA. 
</P>
<P>
"It is simply not timely to move ahead with my previously scheduled agenda," 
Williams said. "It is absolutely clear that the majority of members of the 
House of Representatives are going to vote to keep the NEA alive. The question 
is: Under what structure?" 
</P>
<P>
In making the statement, Williams acknowledged the difficulties posed for the 
NEA by the dual forces of conservative opposition that has attempted to 
dismantle the NEA entirely and a deepening split in the arts community, in 
which a breakaway group of state arts councils proposed late last week that 
state art agencies get 60% of the NEA's money -- up from 20% now. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was embraced as a legislative alternative to the current NEA 
structure earlier this week by two key House Republicans -- Reps. Tom Coleman 
(R-Mo.) and Steve Gunderson (R-Wis.) But there were signs that opposition to 
the restructuring, in which the NEA would effectively cease to exist as a 
national, peer-review-based funder of artistically significant work, had begun 
to mount. 
</P>
<P>
After Robert Reid, director of the California Arts Council, came out in 
opposition to the plan Monday, other state groups appeared to follow suit. 
James Backas, head of the Maryland Arts Council, announced his opposition late 
Wednesday. Backas said arts councils in Alabama, New Mexico, North Carolina, 
South Carolina and Montana had joined in opposing the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said the special summit committee would meet starting Tuesday 
afternoon, with a mandate to come up with an arts unity program for NEA renewal 
as quickly as possible -- preferably within about two days. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction among arts groups was positive. Williams attended a closed meeting of 
NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer and leaders of half a dozen key arts 
organizations Thursday morning to present his proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working together, and working together is always a good idea," said Anne 
Murphy, executive director of the American Arts Alliance. "The arts community 
is sitting down and working and seeing if there are things we can work out. 
Things are moving very, very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Robert L. Lynch, director of the National Assembly of Local Arts Agencies, 
which represents city, county and other local art councils, said the prospects 
for success of the Williams plan in resolving the NEA crisis are good.

'SNL' WITH CLAY WINDS UP FOURTH IN NATIONAL RATINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It looks as if wholesome can still beat outrageous, even on "Saturday Night 
Live." 
</P>
<P>
NBC said Thursday that despite the impressive overnight ratings for the 
controversial appearance by comedian Andrew Dice Clay last weekend, the final 
national figures showed that the program was only the fourth highest rated 
edition of this season. The first? The one hosted by Fred Savage of ABC's "The 
Wonder Years." 
</P>
<P>
The Clay installment had garnered "Saturday Night Live's" best ratings of the 
season in the 23 large cities that deliver overnight figures, but the numbers 
did not hold up in the smaller markets.

EVALUATION: TWO MAJOR ORANGE COUNTY CHORALES AND A LOCAL SYMPHONY WERE PRAISED 
BUT ANOTHER SYMPHONY WAS CRITICIZED BY A STATE ARTS ADVISORY GROUP.

<P>
A state arts advisory panel meeting here this week had bouquets for Orange 
County's two major chorales and for one local orchestra. But for another local 
orchestra, it had brickbats. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Chorale, the Master Chorale of Orange County and the South Coast 
Symphony all were highly praised, but the Garden Grove Symphony was called 
"very poor" in preliminary discussions by the seven-member panel, which is 
evaluating 80 chorales, orchestras and opera troupes statewide. Orange County's 
Opera Pacific and Pacific Symphony were to be considered late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the panel will assign each group a numerical ranking (from one to four, 
the highest) to be used by the California Arts Council when it awards its 
1990-91 Organizational Support Program grants this summer. In past years, only 
groups rated three minus or above have received grants. 
</P>
<P>
The panelists include John Alexander, artistic director of the Pacific Chorale, 
but he left the room while his group was being discussed. 
</P>
<P>
"This essentially volunteer chorus (all but 22 of the Pacific's 152 members are 
volunteers) is at a higher level (artistically) than all the rest" of the 
chorales applying for CAC grants, said Patricia Mitchell, deputy general 
director of the Los Angeles Music Center Opera. The chorale was rated four 
minus last year. 
</P>
<P>
"They do major pieces fabulously," added Robert Cole, director of UC Berkeley's 
performing arts presenting program. "I'd like to sing in this chorus." 
</P>
<P>
The panels judge groups' fiscal and managerial strength and community outreach 
as well as their artistic mettle. A word of caution came from panelist Rand 
Steiger, a San Diego composer, conductor and percussionist who said he hopes 
that the Pacific "doesn't lose touch with (its) home base" now that it has 
begun performing regularly with the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Pasadena 
Symphony and at the Ojai Music Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Other panelists said the chorale should add minorities to its all-white 
19-member board -- an effort already in progress, according to the chorale's 
application. 
</P>
<P>
The Master Chorale of Orange County, ranked three last year, was called "one of 
the finest chorales" in the country by panelist Denis de Coteau, music director 
and chief conductor of the San Francisco Ballet. "The quality of singing is far 
beyond that which I've heard back east and (artistic director) William Hall has 
not been afraid to attack 20th-Century music," de Coteau added. 
</P>
<P>
Panelists further praised the chorale for an increase in subscriptions sold and 
for a 22-member board of directors that includes five minority-group members. 
</P>
<P>
South Coast Symphony, ranked three minus last year, was complimented for taking 
a serious approach to orchestral music. "This is a real orchestra. They play 
real music" instead of fluff, Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander said it is especially "amazing" that the orchestra, which usually 
plays in a modest hall at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa, "has accomplished 
what it has (in the) shadow" of the $73.3-million Orange County Performing Arts 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
In stark contrast was the criticism of the Garden Grove Symphony which has 
failed to qualify for CAC grants for the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
"Artistically, I think (the orchestra's) standards are very, very low, very 
poor," Cole said. "It sounds like it doesn't have very good artistic 
leadership." Edward Peterson is founding conductor and artistic and music 
director of the orchestra, which ranked two plus last year. 
</P>
<P>
Clifton Swanson, music director of the San Luis Obispo Mozart Festival, was 
sent by the panel to hear the orchestra play live and wrote back that while it 
appeared to have strong community support, its "programming . . . in general 
tends to be very light and popular in orientation. Each concert borders on a 
pops flavor." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the orchestra has announced elimination of its two-concert pops 
series and its annual New Year's Eve concert in order to focus its audience's 
attention on classical concerts. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the orchestra has defended lightweight fare, maintaining that it 
wants to reach a broad range of listeners including those unfamiliar with 
classical music. Cole rejected that argument. Noting that the orchestra's 
programs have contained as many as nine short pieces "instead of one, two or 
three solid" works, Cole said, "(If) they think that's too ambitious for the 
audience, then they shouldn't have an orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
The Garden Grove Symphony was lauded, however, for its efforts to reach the 
large Korean community in Orange County. Through a guest conductor exchange 
program, Peterson will be conducting the Inchon Symphony in Korea in November 
and Won-Sik Lim of Korea is scheduled to appear in Orange County in September. 
The orchestra has two Koreans on its board. 
</P>
<P>
Grants will be awarded Aug. 23 and 24. Tere Romo, manager of the CAC's 
Organizational Support Program, said it is impossible to predict how many 
groups will win grants until the council's new budget is determined.

MCGILLIS TO APPEAR IN GARDEN GROVE EVENT

Kelly McGillis, recently appointed to the board of the Grove Shakespeare 
Festival, will participate in a "readers' theater" fund-raising event on July 
30 at the Festival Amphitheatre in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
McGillis and others from the troupe will read excerpts of speeches by their 
favorite Shakespearean characters, said Grove executive vice president Barbara 
Hammerman. The evening's format will be decided next week, Hammerman said. 
</P>
<P>
Hammerman noted that McGillis, who also will be honorary chairperson for the 
event, may invite other actors from the Hollywood community to participate but 
that prospects remain vague. "We would love to have one or two other artists of 
note," said Hammerman. 
</P>
<P>
The Grove, which launches its 12th season this weekend with Moliere's "The 
Miser," has projected a $717,000 budget for 1990. The theater troupe already 
has encountered a cash-flow shortage, Hammerman said, chiefly because there has 
been no box-office income for more than three months. The final show of last 
season, "Twelfth Night," closed on Feb. 3. 
</P>
<P>
"We've basically had a cash shortage since the summer of 1988," said artistic 
director Thomas F. Bradac, who heads a salaried staff of only five full-time 
employees, including himself and Hammerman. "We've been in a 'fallout mode' 
ever since we lost our financial support from our partnership with Rancho 
Santiago College and from the city." 
</P>
<P>
The college had provided $105,000 in goods and services, such as scene shop 
facilities, salaries for designers, and program printing, Bradac said. The 
Garden Grove City Council had provided $87,000 in an annual cash subsidy, but 
that has been phased down to less than $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
Hammerman emphasized, however, that the Grove is not in any deep fiscal 
trouble. She said its current subscription drive has kept pace with last 
season's, drawing more than 1,700 season ticket holders so far. The goal is 
2,500, about 300 more than last year's record high of 2,200. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Grove has begun negotiations with the City Council to 
obtain a five-year lease of both the indoor, 172-seat Gem and the outdoor, 
550-seat amphitheater. Currently, the city leases the facilities to the Grove 
on an annual basis. Hammerman said an extended lease would not only provide the 
theater troupe with greater security but also help other fund-raising efforts 
by assuring potential contributors that the troupe has the long-term support of 
its community.

<P>
The drive from her Anaheim home to Santee in San Diego County was only two 
hours, but Robin Gryvnak, 26, had been dreaming about this moment for years. 
</P>
<P>
She had fussed all week over what she would say to him, what she should wear to 
impress him, even how to arrange her hair so she would look more like him. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted everything to be just right. It had to be perfect, right down to 
every detail," she had said nervously the night before. 
</P>
<P>
But this Saturday morning four weeks ago as she drove into the Santee 
neighborhood, parked by the white-framed house with the neat front lawn, and 
saw Richard Campbell on the front lawn, grinning and waving -- she simply 
melted. 
</P>
<P>
She walked toward him shyly and awkwardly, suddenly like a little girl, 
clutching the mementos she had brought just for him -- a bouquet of daisies and 
a balloon that bannered the words, "It's a Girl!" 
</P>
<P>
Then Robin Gryvnak fell into Campbell's embrace. An adopted child who found her 
long-unknown birth father. A personal journey that now seemed headed for a 
happy ending. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when reunions of adopted persons and their birth parents were 
a true novelty, a rarely publicized lost-and-found phenomenon in America. 
</P>
<P>
But not anymore. In the past decade, these tearful happenings have become 
increasingly familiar. The parties in these long-abandoned relationships not 
only are more eager to reunite, but also more willing to tell their 
irresistibly dramatic and sentimental stories to the media. 
</P>
<P>
All such tales are full of sure-fire plot elements -- first, secrecy and shame; 
then, rediscovery and elation. Some relate such extraordinary ordeals and 
bizarre twists that they border on the melodramatic. 
</P>
<P>
And this is no passing fad. The American Adoption Congress, an umbrella 
organization for search-support groups and reunion registries, believes there 
are now at least 250,000 "active searchers" nationwide. While most still are 
adult adoptees, the numbers of birth parents and those searchers under 30 are 
markedly increasing. 
</P>
<P>
But search advocates said the traditional stigmatic secrecy over adoptions 
remains massive, despite the growing acceptance of the full "open adoption" 
concept -- where birth parents are identified and remain in open contact with 
the child and the adoptive parents. 
</P>
<P>
California, like most states, keeps original birth certificates and other key 
adoption-related records sealed, opened generally only by court order, which is 
rarely given, activists said. 
</P>
<P>
And many defenders of traditional "closed" adoptions still denounce searchers 
as militant malcontents who break the original pact of confidentiality, engage 
in extralegal search tactics and cruelly harass those who are contacted. 
</P>
<P>
"Ridiculous!" countered Florence Fisher, founder of the national Adoptees' 
Liberty Movement Assn. "That 'malcontent' accusation is just one more myth." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher and other advocates conceded the potential does exist for "extreme 
traumatic reactions" from the persons contacted. But, they noted, searchers 
themselves could also face shocking discoveries, such as finding people who are 
criminals or drug addicts. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, we worry about both these possibilities, but they happen very 
rarely," said Cindy Shacklett, Orange County coordinator for the national 
Concerned United Birthparents search-support organization. 
</P>
<P>
Shacklett led a small group of protesters May 1 at the Orange County Courthouse 
as part of a nationwide "Open My Records Day." In California, the advocates are 
backing an Assembly bill, now in committee, that would make the most vital 
adoption-case records -- such as original birth certificates -- available 
without court order to adult adoptees, birth parents and adoptive parents. 
</P>
<P>
People search for different reasons, advocates said: For adoptees, it is to 
find their full identity; for birth parents, to heal emotional wounds from 
giving up their children; and for all of them, to exercise a new form of civil 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't go searching for a 'Mommy' or a 'Daddy' at age 18 or 40," Fisher 
said. "They're looking for other answers." 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan O'Brien, now 39, was raised lovingly by her adoptive parents, her 
adoption status openly acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
After all, she was told, "adopted children were chosen, were picked out, are 
very special. There's nothing to be ashamed of." 
</P>
<P>
But "when you're older, you begin to feel there's something askew -- the flip 
side of those usual explanations," recalled O'Brien, a graphic designer who 
lives in Laguna Hills and belongs to the Orange County branch of Concerned 
United Birthparents, whose members include adoptees. 
</P>
<P>
"I began to feel a sense of void about my whole identity. It's feeling lost and 
that certain pieces of our puzzle are still missing." 
</P>
<P>
Her adoptive parents, she said, never went into depth about her adoption. 
</P>
<P>
"They never said it was a forbidden topic, but you could sense it was too 
hurtful to bring up. And you don't, because you love them," O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
But by the mid-1970s -- after she had married and her own daughter, Jennifer, 
was born -- O'Brien began searching on her own sporadically. Her adoptive 
parents knew her full birth name and had told O'Brien. So she often spent whole 
evenings, pouring over phone books of areas throughout California and other 
states, looking for people with that unusual last name. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the random calls -- and her own attempts to obtain identifying 
information from public records -- proved to be a dead end. In 1988, however, 
after turning her search over to a professional consultant, O'Brien located the 
birth mother -- now 67, divorced, living in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien placed the first call in February, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, I was shaking, and I wasn't sure I could even speak," she said. "Sure, 
you're worried about absolute rejection. Sure, you wonder how upsetting this 
might be to the other person." 
</P>
<P>
"But (support groups and consultants) tell you to take it easy, to be up front 
and tell them you're not out to intrude in their lives, but only want to meet, 
learn about their lives and tell of yours." 
</P>
<P>
The call went well, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"She was polite," O'Brien said. "She never acknowledged the birth date or the 
adoption. But she did say we might meet, but not right away -- she wasn't 
feeling well." 
</P>
<P>
The explanation devastated O'Brien. "She said she had cancer; she was 
undergoing chemotherapy." 
</P>
<P>
Two months later, just before Mother's Day, 1989, they met. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw this woman, very ill, but who looked so much like me. It stuns you, no 
matter how prepared you think you are. I hugged her. I cried a lot. We sat on 
the couch, touching each other -- our faces, our hands, comparing 
similarities." 
</P>
<P>
"She swore me to secrecy," O'Brien said. "Her two daughters (from a later 
marriage) didn't know about me. She asked me not to tell them or contact them 
-- until after her death." 
</P>
<P>
At the funeral 10 months later, O'Brien walked up to the half-sisters, offered 
her condolences but introduced herself only as "a close friend of the family." 
Later, when all the others had left, she returned alone to the grave site and 
-- for the first time that day -- allowed herself to cry. 
</P>
<P>
She has since phoned the half-sisters, who are both in their mid-30s. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been like instant empathy, like we've known each other all our lives," 
O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
Their first formal gathering will be this Memorial Day -- at their mother's 
grave. 
</P>
<P>
But O'Brien's memories of her birth mother are poignantly mixed. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw her many times. But, no, I can't say it was perfect. There were strained 
moments. I couldn't get real close to her. She stayed distant, and I realize 
now she was a very private person." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, O'Brien added, "I had this feeling that she was glad to see me and to know 
that I was doing all right and had a wonderful daughter of my own. And that, 
yes, overall, everything was OK." 
</P>
<P>
The last visit took place in the hospital two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw her alone and hugged her, like I always did," O'Brien said. "She 
couldn't speak. But she moved her hand toward mine, and I held hers -- as 
tightly, and as long, as I could." 
</P>
<P>
Her mother died the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Trish McAleer, now 40, remembers the feelings of guilt, secrecy and isolation 
when she gave birth to her daughter out of wedlock 22 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But eight years ago, McAleer, who is married and has no other children, decided 
to take matters into her own hands. 
</P>
<P>
The San Clemente resident became a dedicated activist in the search movement, 
inspired by a Phil Donahue talk show about the reuniting of birth parents and 
adoptees, and driven by her own need to find her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
And six years ago, after "piecing together bits of information" from public 
records and sympathetic relatives, she located her daughter, who was born in 
Ohio and still lives there. 
</P>
<P>
After the daughter turned 18 in 1986, McAleer took the plunge. She went back to 
Ohio and attended the daughter's commencement -- but staying incognito and 
accompanied only by a trusted relative. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to see her, even if from afar," McAleer said. "I had to be there. I 
cried the whole time." 
</P>
<P>
The next evening, while still in town, McAleer decided to take the next obvious 
step. She phoned the daughter's home. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, said McAleer, the daughter answered and was alone. "She was guarded 
and startled, but she took it very well. She seemed positive about talking 
again and exchanging letters and pictures." 
</P>
<P>
But the next day, McAleer said, the mood had changed abruptly. "She told me we 
shouldn't meet and that if we did, it would hurt her parents." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, when McAleer returned to San Clemente, she mailed off a packet of 
photographs with an explanatory letter to the adoptive parents. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them," McAleer said, "I wasn't out to disrupt things, but only to make 
contact -- and, if it works out, become friends." 
</P>
<P>
The packet came back, the photographs and letter still in it, and with this 
tersely formal note from the daughter: 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia: I want no further contact with you. If I wanted contact with you, I 
would have done so years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The most theatrical twist in this story came 18 months later when McAleer -- 
in Ohio to visit relatives -- decided to seize the moment. 
</P>
<P>
Urged by relatives who knew where the daughter worked, McAleer went straight to 
the store, intending to make face-to-face contact. But the daughter wasn't 
there. "They told me she was in a car accident, that she was in the hospital 
with serious injuries." 
</P>
<P>
Once again, she took the plunge. That evening at the hospital, after the 
adoptive parents had left and the daughter was alone, McAleer -- feeling both 
terrified and driven by this one chance -- entered the room and introduced 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
According to McAleer, the daughter reacted at first with anger, then curiosity 
and "we eventually had a nice talk." But basically, said McAleer, the daughter 
shut the door on her, indicating the adoptive parents strongly opposed any kind 
of contact. 
</P>
<P>
That was 2 1/2 years ago. McAleer has not seen -- or heard from -- the daughter 
since. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no regrets about what I did. I would do it again, a thousand times 
over, because you get only so many chances, if at all," said McAleer, a 
Concerned United Birthparents national official and now a search consultant 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
"What people like me have done may be audacious, perhaps. Certainly, 
persistent. But harassment? That's absurd! Since I last saw her, I have sent 
her little cards on birthdays and holidays. Nothing more." 
</P>
<P>
"I think of her constantly," she added. "And all I want her to know is that I 
care, that I am here, and that my door is always open to her." 
</P>
<P>
Trish McAleer is still sending the cards. Still wishing. Still waiting. 
</P>
<P>
For Robin Gryvnak of Anaheim, who met her birth father in the Santee reunion, 
the wait is finally over. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, through a consultant with the Fullerton-based Severed Strings search 
program, she found her birth mother, now 42 and still living in San Diego 
County. They have met only once and their relationship is "a slowly evolving 
but difficult one," Robin said. 
</P>
<P>
And that embracing reception last April 28 from the family of Richard Campbell, 
the birth father, has touched her deeply -- "just like a real family," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Campbell is now the very image of the solid family man. He and his 
wife, Roberta, have two sons, Rick, 24, and Shawn, 22. And Campbell, who saw 
Army combat duty in Vietnam in 1966, is a longtime employee -- an electrician 
-- with a regional utility company. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it (Robin's first call April 22) might be some kind of hoax," said 
the 47-year-old Campbell, who admits he was "something of a hell-raiser" at the 
time he knew Robin's birth mother. "I never knew about the baby. I never saw or 
heard about (Robin's birth mother) all these years. But I'm convinced I'm 
Robin's father." 
</P>
<P>
And now, said Campbell, pointing to a snapshot of Robin and her children, 
Joshua, 4 1/2, and Amanda, 3, "we find ourselves suddenly with both a daughter 
and grandkids!" 
</P>
<P>
At their April 28 meeting in Santee, an obviously elated Robin presented 
Campbell, a railroad model buff, with a miniature classic Rio Grande caboose 
car -- and this note: 
</P>
<P>
 To you, this may be the end of a train. 
</P>
<P>
To me, it's a symbol of the end of a long search. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Love, Robin. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Gryvnak, one of her staunchest supporters throughout the six-year search. 
</P>
<P>
Last Oct. 16, the day after Robin met her birth mother, she sent Mary a huge 
bunch of roses. "I knew she would be feeling kind of hurt, and I didn't want 
that to happen. I wanted to tell her something from the heart." 
</P>
<P>
So with the roses came a tiny card -- one that made the 53-year-old Mary 
Gryvnak, as she recalled later, "cry every time I read it." 
</P>
<P>
 To my one and only MOM!!!!! 
</P>
<P>
 -- Love, always, Robin.

ANN CONWAY: NOVEL HAS NEWPORT BUZZING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was 85 degrees Fahrenheit on the sand at her club, and the club's hot mommas 
were white-hot on that Saturday afternoon. . . . Most of the hot mommas were no 
younger than Cher and no older than Jane Fonda. Many could rival either when it 
came to body sculpting. It was astonishing what the Nautilus, the knife, and 
single-minded dedication had accomplished in The Golden Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "The Golden Orange" 
</P>
<P>
by Joseph Wambaugh 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach telephones are sizzling with talk about the "hot mommas" of 
Joseph Wambaugh's new novel about Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody knows they're supposed to be a covey of tanned and tawny women who 
hang out at the Balboa Bay Club (on a patch of sand Wambaugh calls "The Kill 
Zone"). Even Wambaugh has gone on the record to confirm that. 
</P>
<P>
The question that's crisping the wires: Who are they exactly? Gadabout Mary Ann 
Miller, for 20 years a member of the exclusive enclave by the bay, swears that 
toned and saucy Sassy Luby was/is one. "But the group changes like the tide," 
Miller says. "Because they come to the beach when they're going in and out of 
divorces. They're simply gorgeous women who wear outrageous bathing suits and 
lay around the club's beach bar. They don't do anything wrong. They just like 
to have fun." 
</P>
<P>
But Luby, who holes up in one of the sanctum's coveted bay view apartments, 
says uh-uh. "I'm not a tight body," she purrs with a giggle. "I haven't been a 
hot momma since I was 16!" 
</P>
<P>
Luby, ex-wife of Roger Luby (ex-boyfriend of Aissa Wayne, daughter of John 
Wayne), says she found Wambaugh's 317-page fictional account of Orange County's 
club, restaurant and bar scene "amusing." 
</P>
<P>
"Joe and I are old friends," she said with that easy sound in her voice that 
tells you life is good. "He went to school with Roger. Joe has taken a 
composite of people and written a book. Of course the club is the Bay Club. Of 
course there are hot mommas. And of course they're gorgeous. There's enough 
silicone on that beach to float a boat." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Soderling, also a Bay Club resident, said the whole beach scene at the Bay 
Club is hot to watch. As for "hot mommas," well, Soderling wants to take the 
Fifth, thank you very much. "I'll just say there are some ladies who frequently 
come to the beach who are mostly divorced and live at the club. They're 
unattached females looking for attachment. I don't feel they wear terribly 
outrageous bathing suits. They're very nice, sophisticated ladies who enjoy the 
sun." 
</P>
<P>
Surprise. Balboa Bay Club President Tom Deemer hasn't read the controversial 
book that calls the bar at his prestigious hangout "dark enough to camouflage 
nips and tucks and bad sutures and lumpy implants and curdled silicone." 
</P>
<P>
"What?" he said, when told about the teensy paragraph that jolts the reader at 
the bottom of Page 63. "That's ridiculous! Come on down here and I'll show you 
windows! And when the sun goes down, the lights go on! 
</P>
<P>
"Joe moved out of town kind of quick, didn't he?" Deemer added, referring to 
Wambaugh's recent switch from Newport Beach to north San Diego County. "He's 
moved out of Orange County three times. It's the strangest thing; people who 
are celebrities aren't celebrities in Newport Beach. Sometimes it distresses 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Trying Out: A few hundred of arts society's most svelte women are set to 
audition to model for the benefit fashion show that will be staged at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center on Sept. 18. On May 30 at the Center's 
rehearsal hall, members of the Guilds of the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center plan to strut their stuff before four judges: Bonnie Page, a marketing 
rep from South Coast Plaza; Kitty Leslie, fashion coordinator for Newport 
Center Fashion Island; Marge Cooling, an ex-model who is chairing the modeling 
committee, and Carlton Burnett, director of the fashion extravaganza that is 
expected to pour a considerable sum into Center coffers. While most of the 
models -- 150 are needed for the show -- will be selected by the judges, some 
will appear by virtue of their beauty and dedication to Center causes. On that 
list: Kathryn Thompson, Georgia Spooner and Judie Argyros. What? No Janice 
Johnson, whose idea it was to stage the innovative fund-raiser? "I'm too short 
-- 5-foot-3," Janice says, noting that models must be at least 5 feet, 6 
inches. Renee Segerstrom and Willa Dean Lyon are honorary co-chairwomen of the 
event. Both South Coast Plaza and Newport Center Fashion Island have donated 
$25,000 to help underwrite the production.

Nearly $18 million was gained by county cities during April as as result of the 
state of California's latest disbursement of sales and use tax revenues. 
Another $900,000 was received by county government agencies, making the 
county's total take $18,791,945. That's a 25% decrease from the March outlay 
received locally. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim and Santa Ana were the two largest beneficiaries, taking in $4.4 
million between them, for 24% of the total. Costa Mesa, though, received by far 
the highest per capita amount -- $17.59 for each resident. At the other end of 
the spectrum on both counts was Villa Park with its $2,245 total (32 cents per 
resident). 
</P>
<P>
The $18.8 million received here was more than the amounts sent to either 
Riverside, San Bernardino or San Diego counties, but only about a third of what 
Los Angeles County took in. Orange County had the highest per capita amount of 
any of the five counties, though. 
</P>
<P>
Each month, city and county governments and other governmental organizations 
receive payments from the state in anticipation of actual sales tax revenues. 
In the fourth month, they receive a cleanup payment -- the difference between 
actual revenues and the amounts previously received -- plus the first advance 
payment for the next quarter. The amounts listed here are for the second 
advance payment of the first quarter of 1990.

SINGLE LIFE: TO ATTRACT IDEAL MATE USE MENTAL MAGNETISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EVAN CUMMINGS, Evan Cummings is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Can you attract the love of your life by calling on the power of your mind? 
Sioux Harlan believes that you can. The Irvine-based therapist found a husband 
by using her own brand of positive thinking called creative visualization. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned that the mind is a powerful magnet, and when I got serious about 
marriage, I changed my mind, and changing my mind transformed my life," says 
Harlan, who has a master's degree in counseling and a doctorate of education in 
psychology. 
</P>
<P>
Recent mind research performed at Stanford University proved that "every time 
we think a thought, an electrical current goes through our brain causing a 
chemical reaction in our bodies," according to Harlan. "Each time an electrical 
force field is created there is simultaneously created a magnetic force field, 
which explains why we bring about what we think about." 
</P>
<P>
She contends that "what we think has a magnetic force that brings us to what we 
are holding in the image . . . or whom." 
</P>
<P>
She offers a four-week seminar called "A Month of Mondays" in which she shows 
anyone who is serious about marriage how to construct "a proclamation, an 
announcement you give to your mind." 
</P>
<P>
First, she says, make a list of desired character traits divided into three 
categories -- physical, mental and spiritual. "The physical traits have a 
sub-category of physical action. For example: 'Feminine; 5 feet, 6 inches to 5 
feet, 9 inches; auburn hair; vivid green eyes; athletic; likes volleyball and 
camping." 
</P>
<P>
Harlan encourages people to be as specific as possible. The categories are a 
tool that trigger thinking of specifics. "There is no right or wrong to this 
list, except that you should avoid using negative phrases such as nonsmoker." 
She suggests instead that you ask for someone who prefers breathing clean air 
into his or her lungs. 
</P>
<P>
Your proclamation, she explains, serves as a conduit through which the mind is 
opened to select the traits you want in another person. Don't worry if your 
list seems too rigid or even silly, she says. "You can refine your list, adding 
and subtracting as you grow and learn more about who you are and what you 
want." 
</P>
<P>
Equally important is deciding what is negotiable and what is not. "Affectionate 
(physical), monogamous (spiritual) or career woman (mental) are probably not 
negotiable, but big blue eyes and loves hockey may be," she adds. 
</P>
<P>
Once you have constructed your shopping list, she recommends putting it away. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't necessary to look at the list daily. Your subconscious mind knows 
what is on your list," she explains. "Your conscious mind is the chooser, it 
makes up the list. Your subconscious mind is the doer. It makes it happen." 
</P>
<P>
Next is the affirmation phase. "Throughout the course of your day -- upon 
awakening, before going to bed, while exercising -- whenever your body is 
occupied but your mind is not, simply repeat your intention: 'I, (your name), 
am harmoniously married to my perfect mate." 
</P>
<P>
If you have someone special in mind should you incorporate their name into the 
affirmation exercise? Harlan says no. 
</P>
<P>
"Be careful what you wish for. You may be hanging onto someone who is wrong for 
you. Your request should be for the right person; if that person is meant to 
come to you, they will." 
</P>
<P>
A beneficial effect to making the list, Harlan says, is that you can compare 
desired traits to those of a person you may already be dating or on whom you 
have set your sights; that gives you a chance to see how he or she measures up. 
</P>
<P>
"Never close your mind to someone who may be out there whom you never 
considered before." 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate, Harlan recalls her own love story. "As it turned out, I had been 
introduced to my husband, Terry, several years before." 
</P>
<P>
The two were linked professionally, which enabled them to see each other 
occasionally at various business functions throughout Orange County. It was 
through that professional network that Terry became more involved in her life. 
"By that time I had constructed my list and was affirming it daily." 
</P>
<P>
An occasion arose that required a co-host for a large party she was planning. 
She asked him and he accepted. On the night of the party he arrived early 
(punctuality was on her list) and he helped in the kitchen (one of her requests 
was for someone who "loves cooking together"). He was "imaginative and a great 
host." 
</P>
<P>
Harlan realized that the man she had wished for was right there, and his recent 
breakup of a long-term relationship made him available. It was a match made . . 
. first in her mind. 
</P>
<P>
The couple will celebrate their fourth wedding anniversary in May.

THE PAPER TRAIL TO A PAST; 
</P>
<P>
SUPPORT GROUPS LESSEN THE ODDS FOR SEARCHERS OF KIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Searches by adoptees and birth parents for blood relatives vary widely, 
depending on the ages of those sought, the state in which they reside, what 
records are available -- and just plain luck. 
</P>
<P>
Some searches take decades, others a few weeks. The most common, say Orange 
County specialists, take six months to two years. 
</P>
<P>
The ages of searchers range from 18 to 70. But the range centers between 25 and 
35 and includes mostly women. But now there are younger searchers -- and also 
more men. 
</P>
<P>
And some searches are unusually urgent, such as one case in which the birth 
parents were sought for a bone-marrow transplant for their leukemia-stricken 
child. Some adoptees need to obtain vital genetic or medical background, 
including effects of drug abuse, for themselves and their children. 
</P>
<P>
For adoption-rights advocates, the public-records situation remains bleak. Only 
three states have open access to original birth certificates and other key 
adoption case documents. 
</P>
<P>
In all other states, including California, such records are sealed unless 
opened by court order. However, access to these records -- and therefore to 
crucial identifications, particularly the birth parents -- are routinely denied 
by judges. 
</P>
<P>
And what information is made available is often useless, they said. In these 
instances, the names and whereabouts of birth or adoptive parents and the 
children's adopted names are usually deleted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's absolutely a blank wall. It's ignoring the fact that adoption is a 
lifelong process and that adoptees as adults have a right to know," said 
consultant Patricia Treadway of the Fullerton-based Severed Strings. 
</P>
<P>
Others in the adoption field, however, are appalled by the prospect of any 
"unlimited openness" for records. The most outspoken foe is William Pierce, 
president of the Washington-based National Committee for Adoption, whose 
members include traditional adoption agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's strictly voluntary, if all parties in the triad -- adopted adults, 
adoptive parents, birth parents -- consent to it, there's no problem, 
obviously," said Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
"But there are many who are frightened by the thought of (open records), who 
feel they are being betrayed if their privacy is invaded," added Pierce. "They 
had entered into (the adoption) agreement because it was confidential and the 
court promised that. We should continue to respect -- and protect -- their 
rights." 
</P>
<P>
Generally, searchers said, they are still left with piecing together fragments 
of information from available basic records, with details also culled from 
hospital, marriage, divorce, property and other such records. If lucky, some 
searchers do so armed with at least a last name and specific city. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, they pray for a little extra help. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you get a sympathetic attorney or doctor who has greater access to 
records, or a sympathetic or unknowing (records) clerk," said one searcher. 
"Sometimes, someone even forgets to black out the names -- and you're home 
free!" 
</P>
<P>
Others gain vital information about the person being sought -- a special 
occupation, a high school, a close relative, sometimes the person's full name 
itself -- from their adoptive parents, who somehow heard about it or found it 
in old documents. 
</P>
<P>
While many do searches on their own, some join the two major support 
organizations for next-of-kin searches -- Adoptees' Liberty Movement Assn. 
(ALMA) and Concerned United Birthparents (CUB). Some searchers also hire 
American Adoption Congress-backed consultants -- there are five in Orange 
County -- while others employ regular private investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Overall estimates of actual reunions, said search specialists, are hard to come 
by. However, the Nevada-based International Soundex Reunion Registry, which has 
listed more than 66,000 people since 1975, has reported 2,400 reunions from its 
computer-matching service. 
</P>
<P>
And Tustin-based search consultant Patricia Sanders said studies have indicated 
that "unfavorable" reunions -- those involving total rejection -- may be no 
more than 5% to 10%. 
</P>
<P>
But in many ways, search-movement leaders said, the "closed adoption" syndrome 
remains all-powerful in American society. 
</P>
<P>
Also, they said, while the concept of "open adoptions" -- where the birth 
parents maintain ongoing open contact with the child and the adoptive parents 
-- is now widely praised, the number of "fully open adoptions" remains 
relatively few. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Kaplan, executive director of Parenting Resources, estimated that the 
number of "fully open" cases in California -- where 5,918 adoptions took place 
last year -- amounted to no more than 10% to 15%. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, though, search-movement advocates like to say that other trends point 
to a "new candor" in American society. They cite the impacts from such other 
issues as abortion rights and the lessening stigma attached to teen-age 
pregnancies and unwed mothers.

BALANCED BUDGET MAY HIDE PAINFUL CUTS TO COME; 
</P>
<P>
FORECASTS: PROJECTED STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING CUTS COULD MEAN A COUNTY 
SHORTFALL IN HEALTH AND WELFARE PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a glance, Ventura County's $653-million budget for the fiscal year beginning 
in July appears benign. 
</P>
<P>
Released Thursday, it shows a spending increase of $41 million, provides 
another 190 workers, virtually maintains current levels of service and is 
balanced. 
</P>
<P>
But the budget is based on optimistic forecasts of state and federal funding, 
said the analysts who prepared it. And almost surely it will be pared by 
painful cuts in health and welfare programs before the Board of Supervisors 
approves it in early August. 
</P>
<P>
"Where we are headed in the immediate near future is to a large degree 
determined by the federal and, even more so, state government," Chief 
Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg said in a report to the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"That direction, much to our dismay, is definitely downward," he added. 
</P>
<P>
A state budget deficit now estimated at $3 billion for the 1990-91 fiscal year 
could mean a county shortfall of $1 million in its health and welfare programs, 
Budget Manager Bert Bigler said. 
</P>
<P>
Mandated cuts in the federal budget could mean additional losses in a variety 
of social programs next fall, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is bad news," Bigler said. "The fact is that there aren't sufficient 
funds to deal totally with what we feel are ongoing needs and requirements. And 
it doesn't deal with state reductions either." 
</P>
<P>
Nor does the budget provide much money -- a total of $14 million -- to be kept 
in reserve or spent on a long list of proposals that county department heads 
say are essential. 
</P>
<P>
Collectively, the departments want equipment and 328 new employees at a cost of 
$46 million. For the long term they also say they need at least $50 million to 
build new structures and to keep existing ones in repair. 
</P>
<P>
"The dollar magnitude of these issues is far beyond any financial means the 
county has of addressing them," Wittenberg said. But he said the needs are 
real. 
</P>
<P>
For example, county social services needs $1 million more to meet current 
demand for welfare payments. The General Services Agency needs $4.9 million to 
upgrade its computer systems and the Municipal Court needs $246,000 to hire new 
judges to catch up with a backlog of cases. 
</P>
<P>
Also needed, but not in the budget, is $630,000 for emergency and foster-care 
services for children, $60,000 to continue assistance for the frail elderly and 
$29,000 for a full-time dogcatcher to enforce the county leash law in Meiners 
Oaks, Oak View, Mira Monte and the Ventura beaches. 
</P>
<P>
A district attorney's program hailed for its success in spotlighting repeat 
juvenile lawbreakers has lost its state grant and needs $63,000 to continue. 
</P>
<P>
When considering these requests, the supervisors say they will have to make 
their toughest choices. 
</P>
<P>
The department heads "say they can't live without all of this," Chairwoman 
Madge L. Schaefer said. "We say, 'Here's a red pencil, start prioritizing.' It 
is painful for everybody. Some of these choices are just awful." 
</P>
<P>
For example, Schaefer and Supervisor John K. Flynn disagree over whether the 
county should commit $600,000 to a $4.5-million Camarillo housing project for 
the homeless mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn, who has worked on the project for three years, is trying to gain the 
commitment before budget hearings. Schaefer and Supervisor Maggie Erickson have 
insisted on weighing that project against others at budget hearings. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, pressure grows to protect the county's buildings by paying 
for maintenance that has been put off for years, Wittenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Wittenberg presented to the board a five-year building and 
maintenance plan that ranked by need 97 projects that would cost $132 million. 
</P>
<P>
In his budget summary, the chief administrator asks the supervisors to restrict 
new hiring, to increase the county's construction and maintenance budgets and 
to set up a $3-million fund that would pay the debt on construction bonds. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to do more toward preserving our assets," Wittenberg said. "We have 
roof problems and computers that have to be maintained. There is less money for 
personnel costs, so we are asking the board to limit these things."

BLUEGRASS IS TAKING ROOT AT S.D. FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the last decade or so, a thriving bluegrass music scene has developed in San 
Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
There's a club, the San Diego Bluegrass Club, with nearly 400 members. 
</P>
<P>
There's a music store, New Expression in North Park, that carries a healthy 
selection of bluegrass records and instruments. 
</P>
<P>
There's a radio show, "Bluegrass Special," that airs each Sunday from 10 p.m. 
to midnight on KSON. 
</P>
<P>
And, since last year, there's also an annual bluegrass festival. The inaugural 
1989 San Diego Bluegrass Festival was a single-day event featuring a handful of 
local performers. 
</P>
<P>
This year's festival, which begins Friday at the Lake Henshaw Resort in Santa 
Ysabel, is a three-day affair with performances by a dozen bluegrass bands, 
five of them from out of town. 
</P>
<P>
"I've wanted to see a bluegrass festival established here for years," said 
co-promoter Noel Taggart, a 35-year-old biomedical technician at the UC San 
Diego Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something I feel San Diego needs," he said. "The papers, the media, don't 
give the local bluegrass scene nearly enough exposure, and I'm convinced there 
are a lot of people out here who, if they knew this stuff existed, would come 
out and participate." 
</P>
<P>
Headlining the 1990 San Diego Bluegrass Festival will be the Osborne Brothers, 
named the nation's No. 1 bluegrass group for nine consecutive years by Music 
City News. Regulars at the Grand Ole Opry since 1964, the Tennessee quintet has 
toured with Merle Haggard, performed at the White House and recorded for such 
major labels as Decca, MCA and RCA. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Osborne Brothers' songs have become bluegrass classics, including 
"Tennessee Houn' Dog," "Midnight Flyer," and "Rocky Top," the official state 
song of Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
Taggart said he is a lifelong bluegrass fan who "decided to take it up a little 
more seriously about 1975, I guess." He bought a banjo, took some lessons, 
joined the then-fledgling San Diego Bluegrass Club, and, before long, had 
formed his own bluegrass group, Blue Skies. 
</P>
<P>
For the next 12 years, Taggart said, Blue Skies regularly played around town, 
mostly at private functions, and periodically performed at bluegrass festivals 
throughout the state. When the band broke up, Taggart put together a new group, 
Higher Ground, whose most recent engagement was at McP's Pub in Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Taggart said, he's attended myriad bluegrass festivals 
throughout the country. And, although he has often thought about producing a 
festival of his own in San Diego, he said, it wasn't until last year that 
thought turned to action. 
</P>
<P>
"I found out that one of my co-workers (at the UCSD Medical Center), Sebastian 
Gomez, loved bluegrass as much as I did," Taggart recalled, "so we just kind of 
got together and did the one last year, with only local groups. 
</P>
<P>
"After that, we decided to go ahead and try it again, this time making it 
bigger and booking acts from outside San Diego as well." 
</P>
<P>
Booking out-of-town acts for this year's festival, Taggart said, "was a 
hit-or-miss situation." 
</P>
<P>
"I simply started calling people who might know somebody, and I ended up 
getting in touch with Wayne Rice, who hosts the bluegrass show on KSON," 
Taggart said. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave me a long list of contacts, and that's pretty much how I was able to 
get the acts I got. The exception is the Lonesome River Band. They had somehow 
heard of the festival, and they called us, telling us they were going to be in 
the area and would be more than happy to play the festival. 
</P>
<P>
"And we, in turn, were more than happy to get them." 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post recently called the Lonesome River Band, from Roanoke, Va., 
"one of the best new mainstream bluegrass bands in some time." 
</P>
<P>
Other out-of-town bluegrass bands performing at the festival will be the Piney 
Creek Weasels from Sacramento, Damascus Road from Riverside and the Coyote 
Brothers from Lake Elsinore. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego contingent will consist of Higher Ground (in which festival 
co-promoter Taggart plays banjo), Pacific. . .ly Bluegrass, John Moore and 
Bluegrass Etc. (Moore is a former sideman of Bill Monroe, the legendary "father 
of bluegrass"), Old Train, Ranch Party, Hickory Ridge, and Sweetwater. 
</P>
<P>
Also on hand will be the Stemware Steppers, a local clogging dance group. 
</P>
<P>
Bluegrass festivals such as his, Taggart said, are essential to the genre's 
survival because they provide practitioners of the old-time acoustic music with 
some badly needed mass exposure. 
</P>
<P>
"Like jazz, bluegrass is one of the only pure styles of music that developed in 
the United States," he said. "It's a real American art form, a real piece of 
Americana, and I would hate to see it fall by the wayside." 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego Bluegrass Club meets the second Tuesday of every month in the 
Marketplace at the Grove shopping center's fast-food emporium for a three-hour 
jam session, beginning at 7 p.m.

Don't ever ask an old cowboy -- or a cowboy-at-heart -- too much about cowboy 
poetry and song. He's apt to choke right up, like Lou Schubert. Or like Mike 
Mahaney, who paused to collect himself while reciting a sample of the 
deceptively spare verses of the anonymous cowboy classic, "Blood on the 
Saddle": 
</P>
<P>
 There was blood on the saddle 
</P>
<P>
 There was blood on the ground 
</P>
<P>
 And a great big puddle of blood all around. 
</P>
<P>
 A cowboy lay in it, all bloody and red 
</P>
<P>
 For his horse had fallen on him 
</P>
<P>
 And crushed in his head . . . 
</P>
<P>
Choked up or not, Mahaney and Schubert and a number of other Wild West 
wordsmiths will be singing and reciting, yodeling and ti-yi-yippee-ing cowboy 
tales Sunday at the 30th Annual Topanga Banjo and Fiddle Contest at the 
Paramount Ranch in Agoura -- as part of the contest's first-ever "Cowboy Poetry 
and Storytelling" segment. 
</P>
<P>
Are Mahaney and Schubert cowboys? No. Fifty-year-old Mahaney is a lifelong folk 
singer (and former host of KCSN's cowboy program, "Trail Mix") currently 
working in telemarketing for KCET television. Schubert is a 61-year-old, 
Boston-born former engineer and salesman (and former contest organizer) whose 
wrangling experience is confined to having been social director for dude 
ranches in Arizona and New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Are they cowboys at heart? Sure as a bronco bucks. You can see it in their 
misty eyes, hear it in their quavering voices, when they talk about how they 
became interested in Western folklore -- or when they recite such famous pieces 
of verse as "The Strawberry Roan," by cowboy poet Curley Fletcher, or sing 
cowboy songs that have crossed over into mainstream tastes, like "Don't Fence 
Me In," or those that haven't, like "The Old Chisholm Trail." 
</P>
<P>
" 'The Old Chisholm Trail' is my speciality," said Schubert from his Malibu 
Canyon home. "It probably has millions of verses. Some of them you only do in 
men's company, and of course, I won't do any that are inappropriate at the 
contest. And some are really written for children, and others for families." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, "Chisholm" has as many verses as there were cowboys to make them up. 
Schubert collected several hundred during years of travel around the country, 
interviewing old cowboys and other guardians of Old West memories, and will 
perform as many as 70 verses at the contest. 
</P>
<P>
"It's both a poem and a song," said Schubert, now a partner in an equestrian 
center-building company who discovered his love for the West while reading Zane 
Grey novels as a child. "I start it off by singing and yodeling, and then I 
play the harmonica, then I read some verses from various books, then I play 
Autoharp and sing some more. And then," he added, laughing, "I play my 
mandolin. It takes a hell of a long time to get through the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
"Chisholm" tells several stories at once, and Schubert seems emotionally 
involved with each of them. His baritone voice arches and growls dramatically 
and spontaneously as he sings; he ti-yi-yippees like it really means something. 
A few of his favorite stanzas: 
</P>
<P>
"Come along boys, and listen to my tale 
</P>
<P>
 Tell you all my troubles on the old Chisholm Trail 
</P>
<P>
 Come a ti-yi-yippee, come a ti-yi-yay 
</P>
<P>
 Come-a-ti-yi-yippee-yippee-yay 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 Started down the trail on October twenty-third, 
</P>
<P>
 Started down the trail with the Barracks herd 
</P>
<P>
 Ten-dollar hat, forty-dollar saddle 
</P>
<P>
 Best damn cowboy that ever been straddled 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"Most of these songs go back to probably the 1840s and 1850s," said the lanky 
Mahaney, who lives a cow-chip toss from the Burbank Equestrian Center, and a 
short gallop from the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum (whose namesake first 
inspired Mahaney's interest in Western lore at Saturday matinees long ago.) 
"Some of the songs -- their meters and melodies -- can be traced to Irish and 
Welsh tunes." 
</P>
<P>
And the nonsense words like "ti-yi-yippee," which aren't really so nonsensical, 
have similar roots. Schubert said: 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lady that teaches folklore at night school in Culver City, and she 
took a lot of these nonsense verses -- like a 'donny donny oogle and a bonnie 
bonnie way' . . . and explained to me that it actually meant something in 
Gaelic, and showed how some of these things eventually made their way to 
American folk songs. They eventually lost their meaning for the singers, but 
they still sounded good." 
</P>
<P>
Mahaney, who will host the cowboy segment, blew the lid off the pastoral, 
guitar-cradling "singing cowboy" stereotype as depicted in movies. Yes, 
wranglers did sing -- but no, they did not strum guitars and croon like Gene 
Autry or the Sons of the Pioneers. The music was often a cappella, and when it 
wasn't, the instruments of choice were the fiddle and harmonica. The songs were 
often far simpler than the fare that Autry warbled. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it's a genre that's been criticized by academia," said Mahaney. "Most 
of the poetry and song consists of four-line stanzas that rhyme. It's very easy 
to listen to and understand -- pretty simple -- and it should be. It's all 
really about a lost way of life, or a way of life that is struggling to be 
preserved." 
</P>
<P>
Or, perhaps it's more correct to say, a mythified way of life? 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it is more the myth that I love than reality -- you know, at least the 
myth of simple living, truth and honesty, the white hat, friendship and those 
kind of things," said Mahaney, whose home is in a neighborhood known as "River 
Bottom" that used to house movie cowboys and their ponies in the '30s and '40s. 
"Whether they really existed in the West or were the invention of Ned Buntline 
(creator of the Buffalo Bill Cody dime novel, forerunner of paperback); whether 
they were from the imagination of a writer or really existed, I don't know. But 
I've seen so damn much film about the cowboy that it's left me with definitely 
a love of the myth." 
</P>
<P>
The cowboy theme of the contest was Schubert's idea -- the result of a 
suggestion by contest director Mary Ellen Clark to add a "storytelling" 
segment. Schubert quickly suggested calling Mahaney, and other volunteers were 
rounded up, including storyteller/poet Greg McCarty, David Bouren, Beryl Black, 
Dorin Kayser, Reine River and Christina Egrr. But reading is not limited to 
special guests. Audience members will be invited on stage to spin tales of the 
"lone prairie," and some of the stories are likely to be pretty authentic. 
</P>
<P>
"There are two or three old cowboys who have come every year to sing songs in 
the general competition, and we'll undoubtedly get some of those guys to come 
over and talk and tell cowboy tales," said Schubert. 
</P>
<P>
What? You mean, really working cowboys? Didn't know there were any left. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"They're retired now," he said, "because they have too many broken bones or too 
many aches, or they found there was more money in being a Hollywood cowboy than 
a real one. There's one young guy, well, he's young compared to me -- he's 42 
-- and he's a tremendous showman. He's a lot like some of these Will 
Rogers-type people who were humorists. When he gets up and does a song, it's 
really not a song at all; it's an act." 
</P>
<P>
Schubert's own act is well-tested. In a lifetime's journeys around the world, 
the former dude-rancher (an accomplished horseman in both English and Western 
riding styles) always toted his guitar. Despite the fact that he courteously 
made a point of singing in the language appropriate for whichever country he 
happened to find himself in, in each case, Schubert said, "the thing everybody 
loved was my cowboy songs and yodeling. It's a universal thing." 
</P>
<P>
And a thing that he is still at a loss to explain the allure of. When asked 
that question most dreaded by lovers of cowboy lore and history, "What do you 
love about the songs and poems?" Lou Schubert could barely get the answer out: 
</P>

DIXIELAND IS ALIVE AND KICKING IN THE VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINE ZIAYA-ZEIGER, Ziaya-Zeiger is a regular contributor to Valley 
Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are certain musicians who have been playing it for more than half a 
century. But ask them exactly what Dixieland music is, and they are hard 
pressed for words. 
</P>
<P>
Some say it's a style of music, defined by the number of instruments played -- 
at least five, but perhaps six or seven. Others will tell you that real 
Dixieland must make use of the bass and tuba. Others insist that it's the banjo 
that defines the music. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to figure out where the Dixieland sound originated can be just as 
perplexing. Was it conceived in the South by black musicians who improvised 
together? Or did it begin on the streets of New Orleans during parades and 
funerals? Perhaps it was really born on the shores of the Mississippi. Or in 
the heart of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
No one seems to know for sure. 
</P>
<P>
"Dixieland is a misnomer," said Dick Miller, cornet player with a group called 
the Jazzin' Babies. "It connotes five or six guys sitting around playing a 
dozen tunes people know." 
</P>
<P>
One thing is sure, though. Dixieland music is happy music. It will bring you up 
when you're down. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Teagarden, treasurer of the Valley Dixieland Jazz Club, says it even 
helps her clean house: When she turns on Dixieland jazz, her cleaning chores 
get done a whole lot quicker. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Fernando Valley, fewer than half a dozen venues offer this type of 
jazz. Still, those who regularly attend the restaurants and clubs that feature 
Dixieland will not be dissuaded. They have too good a time. 
</P>
<P>
For the last 12 years, the Jazzin' Babies have been playing Dixieland every 
Wednesday evening at the Red Vest Pizza Parlor in Sylmar. The tradition began 
when Dave Dolson, then a police captain in the Foothill Division of the Los 
Angeles Police Department, formed the group and needed a place for the band to 
jam. A clarinet and soprano saxophone player, Dolson has since moved to 
Montana, where he is the police chief of White Fish. However, the Jazzin' 
Babies play on. 
</P>
<P>
The group is composed of Rosy McHargue, saxophone; John Innes, an original 
member of the band, on trombone; Larry Fisher, drums; Jimmy Green, banjo; 
Miller, cornet; Don Romig, tuba, and Patrick Gogerty, piano. 
</P>
<P>
In the narrow aisles, a few courageous couples often hop to their feet and 
dance to their favorite tunes, while young children chase one another across 
the floor or compete on the electronic video games in the rear of the 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
After an evening on the playing field, members of local softball teams also 
like to relax -- and eat -- while the Jazzin' Babies entertain with pieces from 
their 300-song repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday nights, two other spots in the Valley feature Dixieland -- Casey's 
Tavern in Canoga Park and My Brother's Place in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Six years ago, when Lee and Jean Casey opened their neighborhood bar on Sherman 
Way, they were especially interested in establishing a jazz nightspot. Lee, a 
systems designer for Teledyne, and Jean, a secretary, had always enjoyed 
traditional jazz but had trouble finding it. So now, every Sunday from 6 to 9 
p.m., Casey's features the Jelly Roll Jazz Band. 
</P>
<P>
"People get to hear good music, go home, go to bed and get up and go to work on 
Monday," Lee Casey said. "It's a good way to start the week." 
</P>
<P>
For those who are looking for Dixieland jazz, plus atmosphere and a varied 
dinner menu, My Brother's Place is the answer. Since taking over the restaurant 
in the early part of October, brothers Rick and Don Rann have made quite a few 
changes. They've relocated the stage, rearranged the tables and moved the dance 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
One thing they haven't altered is the Sunday night performance, from 7 to 10, 
by Bob Ringwald's Great Pacific Jazz Band, with Dick Carey, piano; Bob Havens, 
trombone; Don Nelson, soprano sax; Ringwald, banjo; Ray Templin, drums; Jack 
Wadsworth, saxophone, and Zeke Zarchy, trumpet. 
</P>
<P>
Ringwald, 48, started his band about 11 years ago with the intention of helping 
to preserve jazz music, which he refers to as "a truly American art form." And 
although the band doesn't play strictly Dixieland music, they perform many 
arrangements from the early days of jazz, including some by Louis Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen years ago, Ringwald helped establish the Sacramento Dixieland Jubilee, 
which is now held every year over the Memorial Day weekend. Since then, he 
said, jazz festivals have boomed. Festivals in many cities include the Los 
Angeles Classic Jazz Festival on Labor Day weekend and the San Diego 
Thanksgiving Dixieland Jazz Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Besides playing live music, Ringwald is also involved in his own radio program 
-- one of three Dixieland broadcasts in the Los Angeles area. "Bob Ringwald's 
Bourbon Street Parade" airs on KCSN (88.5-FM) Saturday afternoons from 3:05 to 
5. (The other programs that feature Dixieland music are "After Hours" on KPCC 
in Pasadena (89.3-FM) Tuesday through Friday from midnight to 2 a.m. and 
"Traditional Jazz With Bob Epstein" on KLON in Long Beach (88.1-FM) Sunday from 
5 to 7 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
Ringwald thinks that records are a good way to expose the younger generation to 
the old tunes. Traditionally, a majority of listeners have been older. And many 
of the musicians are also up in years -- McHargue of the Jazzin' Babies is 87; 
Carey and Zarchy of Ringwald's band are 73 and 74 respectively. 
</P>
<P>
However, Ringwald noted that young people are learning to appreciate this style 
of jazz. This same trend is being witnessed at the Valley Dixieland Jazz Club 
and the Santa Clarita Dixieland Jazz Club. 
</P>
<P>
"Five years ago, most of the people in our audiences were older people," said 
Bob Gatineau, president of the Santa Clarita jazz club. "But now younger people 
-- age 30 and up -- are starting to go for this music." Every year at the L.A. 
Classic Jazz Festival, "the crowd seems to be getting younger and younger. 
There's a tremendous amount of interest in traditional jazz." 
</P>
<P>
The Valley Dixieland Jazz Club also reports an increase in the number of 
younger patrons. 
</P>
<P>
Although these clubs, both nonprofit organizations, meet only once a month, 
they provide jazz enthusiasts with alternative spots to enjoy Dixieland. The 
programs, each lasting about four hours, are set up much the same way. 
</P>
<P>
Musicians who are interested in performing sign up at the beginning of the 
show. A musical director assigns individual musicians to groups, which are then 
given an opportunity to jam. In addition, each month a featured band is hired 
to perform as part of the afternoon's entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Gatineau said attendance at the Santa Clarita Dixieland Jazz Club's monthly 
meetings averages 250. 
</P>
<P>
Between 250 and 300 attend the Valley Dixieland Jazz Club's get-togethers. 
Patrons are welcome to dance, and they do. An open bar and food concession 
offer refreshments. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone's there to have a good time and enjoy the music," Gatineau said. 
"It's a gay, happy, toe-tapping music. When you look into the audience, you see 
the people stomping out there -- whether they're dancing or sitting down." 
</P>
<P>
Casey's Tavern is at 22029 Sherman Way, Canoga Park. (818) 992-9362. 
</P>
<P>
My Brother's Place is at 9545 Reseda Blvd., Northridge. (818) 886-5841.

Sunday of every month at the Elks Lodge, 804 Pico St., San Fernando. Admission 
is $3 for members, $5 for the general public. (Annual membership is $10.) 
</P>

JERRY'S IN ENCINO OFFERS TOO MUCH TO BE JUST A DELI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some is good. More is better. Too much is just right. 
</P>
<P>
Words many people live by in Southern California, and a good slogan for Jerry's 
Famous Deli of Encino, a flashier, more self-confident version of the larger 
Jerry's down the boulevard in Studio City. Everything about this place is too 
much: the sound-stage decor, the oversized menu, the overflow crowds, the 
overflowing hype. 
</P>
<P>
Then you spot movie industry types nibbling on duck salad and fajitas. In a 
deli! 
</P>
<P>
Yes, I realize this is California, but I'm outraged that these dishes are on 
the menu anyway. If Zero Mostel were still alive, he would personally escort 
anyone eating them from the premises, just as he did at Katz's in New York when 
someone ordered pastrami with lettuce and tomato. If I weren't a consummate 
professional, I might have done the same. 
</P>
<P>
No complaints about Jerry's pastrami, though. It's a lean, spicy cut, with a 
peppery top crust. The counterman slices it into a generous mound before piling 
it on the relatively undistinguished house rye bread. The corned beef here is 
even leaner, thickly sliced but not nearly as moist. 
</P>
<P>
And just to prove Jerry's is serious about its sandwiches, there are jars of 
Gulden's mustard on every table. Try putting that on duck salad. Hah! 
</P>
<P>
Actually, I found most of the cooking here rather serious. It's just, well, too 
much. The bath towel-sized menu is so crammed with entries, it's hard to know 
where to begin. 
</P>
<P>
Personally, I'd start with soup, one of the big draws at this restaurant. 
Probably the killer matzo ball, one enormous, fluffy spheroid in a porcelain 
crock of rich chicken broth and shredded chicken meat, or the mushroom barley, 
a hearty bowlful chock full of barley. Pass on the gummy kreplach, a doughy 
ball that will sink to your stomach like an anchor. 
</P>
<P>
At Jerry's, the menu has a section called appetizers, referring to things like 
chopped liver, stuffed kishka, and potato pirogen. Now I love these dishes -- 
my mother made all three of them -- but calling them appetizers is like calling 
earthquake damage a tax incentive. 
</P>
<P>
However, the kishka is great, a fat sausage casing bursting with a stuffing of 
carrots, flour, and chicken fat. Eat it with the thick, caramel-colored gravy 
served on the side. Potato pirogen are little pockets of boiled dough filled 
with a potato puree and smeared with sour cream, Russian style. And the chopped 
liver is wonderful, airy without being light. Even an agent wouldn't be hungry 
after eating a plateful. 
</P>
<P>
On the lighter side, Jerry's serves a mean chopped salad, a huge bowl of 
lettuce, carrot, cucumber, salami, bell pepper, turkey, ham, and cheese. The 
Greek salad has lots of crumbly feta and a choice of anchovies or the less 
Hellenic herring. 
</P>
<P>
Of the fish, nova tastes about the best -- smooth, buttery, and properly salty. 
Eat it with cream cheese on one of the good house bagels. Sable and sturgeon, 
two rarefied white fish with a lower salt content and a higher price tag, are 
almost always available. I found them a bit bland, certainly too delicate for 
cream cheese and Bermuda onion. Whitefish, chubs, or gefilte fish may satisfy 
the purists. I didn't get to the gefilte fish. Sentimentality only counts for 
so much. 
</P>
<P>
Come for breakfast (served 24 hours a day), and you'll find the full gamut from 
pancakes to omelets, plus a good selection of pastries. Come for lunch or 
dinner, and there is a whole section of the menu devoted to cooked dishes, ones 
like stuffed cabbage, short ribs, or Wienerschnitzel. 
</P>
<P>
I'd have something from the rotisserie, like roasted duck, or a superbly juicy 
and crisp skinned chicken. Jerry's is something of a paradise for chicken 
lovers. Chickens are boiled, stewed, roasted, fried, or barbecued, and all 
versions are really meaty. Turkey's good here too. 
</P>
<P>
For sweet tooths, there is no shortage of dessert. The menu boasts cheesecakes 
flown in from New York. Big deal. They are the dry, crumbly kind, and I found 
them unexceptional. Bread pudding, a custardy interpretation, is far better. It 
is baked on the premises and served with thick whipped cream. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't end there. Napoleons, eclairs, and cookies are always in stock, plus 
any number of fountain treats like egg creams, phosphates, or malts. Of course, 
maybe it would be better to show some restraint. 
</P>
<P>
But watch it. Not too much. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes; kishka with gravy, $4.35, matzo ball soup, $3.60, New 
York-style pastrami sandwich, $7.35, nova lox on a bagel, $8.35, rotisserie 
half-chicken, $9.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry's Famous Deli, 16650 Ventura Blvd., Encino. (818) 906-1800. Open seven 
days a week, 24 hours a day. Parking in lot. Beer and wine only. All major 
credit cards accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $20-$35.

PREVIEW: SAN FERNANDO VALLEY CHORALE PLANS 2 CONCERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WYMA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It's almost like a family, and the audience can feel that when we sing," 
Margaret Stoddard, a longtime member of the San Fernando Valley Chorale, said 
of the group. "They can feel that we like each other and there aren't any prima 
donnas and jealousy." 
</P>
<P>
The chorale, which has had its ups and downs in 12 years of existence, is on 
the comeback trail. Membership, which dipped as low as 20 about three years 
ago, is at 35. 
</P>
<P>
The ensemble will present its Spring Concert on Sunday afternoon, with a 
reprise two weeks later, on June 3. The singers do popular music only -- no 
classical -- and are firmly in the tradition of dedicated amateur community 
groups that work hard at their music and perform whenever they can. 
</P>
<P>
For the San Fernando Valley Chorale that means three big concerts a year and 
far more frequent appearances at retirement homes and before organizations such 
as women's and Kiwanis clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"We get asked back by every group we've performed for," Stoddard said. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's show will take place at 3 p.m. at Our Saviour's First Lutheran Church 
in Granada Hills, site of the chorale's weekly rehearsals. The June 3 show, 
also starting at 3 p.m., will be at First Evangelical Lutheran Church in San 
Fernando. There is no admission charge for either show, although donations are 
accepted. 
</P>
<P>
On the program are excerpts from "The Music Man," "Carousel" and other musical 
comedies; two older popular songs, "Sweet Betsy From Pike" and "When I Was 
Single;" three spirituals, "Poor Man Lazrus," "Dry Bones" and "Don't Be a Weary 
Traveler," plus performances by a women's trio and a men's quartet made up of 
chorale members. 
</P>
<P>
Conrad Immel, director of the chorale for the past two years, believes a public 
prejudice often hurts attendance at events. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like pulling teeth to get people to a concert," he said. "But once they 
get there they say, 'Golly, I didn't know it could be so good.' 
</P>
<P>
"Especially in California," he added, "if someone is not a professional we tend 
to think, 'It's not worth my bother, they can't be very good.' But people are 
impressed by the quality of our concerts and they generally come back." 
</P>
<P>
One reason they return, he said, is to enjoy the magic of live music. 
</P>
<P>
"People are so used to having canned music," Immel said, "especially canned 
popular music -- records, tapes, videos, the radio you play in the car. We give 
an audience good live music. I believe in the intensity that comes with live 
music. There is something important between the audience and the singers, a 
sweat-of-the-brow kind of contact." 
</P>
<P>
Although he teaches corporate computer classes for a living, Immel has 
classical music training. He holds a master's degree in music and has been an 
opera singer. He said his background has changed the chorale's sound, even 
though all the material still comes from popular genres. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're a pop musician without any background, you learn from listening to 
other pop musicians," he said. "You take over their style, and maybe add a 
little style of your own. But if you look at music from the standpoint of a 
classical musician, you shape your interpretation differently. I hope it's 
better. I think it is." 
</P>
<P>
Immel said -- and chorale members confirmed -- that he works on tone far more 
than the group's previous directors. 
</P>
<P>
"He has taught us about music," Stoddard said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando Valley Chorale's Spring Concert will begin at 3 p.m. Sunday at 
Our Saviour's First Lutheran Church, 16603 San Fernando Mission Blvd. (at the 
corner of Hayvenhurst Avenue), Granada Hills. Donations will be accepted. For 
further information call (818) 891-2922.

SCHOOL BUS DRIVER PLEADS NO CONTEST TO SEX CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Laidlaw Transit school bus driver pleaded no contest to a charge he had sex 
with a minor, a 15-year-old hearing-impaired Burbank girl he drove to junior 
high school, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
Manny G. Acosta, 33, of North Hollywood entered the plea Thursday in Burbank 
Municipal Court in exchange for a promise from the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office not to seek a sentence of more than 16 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The plea was entered in a closed hearing after Municipal Judge Marion Gubler 
granted a defense request to exclude the public and the media from the 
courtroom. Deputy Dist. Atty. David Disco, who heads the Pasadena office, said 
his office objected to the closed hearing in a previous meeting in the judge's 
chambers. 
</P>
<P>
Acosta, who Laidlaw officials said will be fired after the company is 
officially notified of his plea, is scheduled to be sentenced June 8. He has no 
prior criminal record, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on the facts of this case it was our view that the 16-month maximum 
sentence was appropriate," Disco said. 
</P>
<P>
The bus driver was arrested May 2 after a two-day investigation which began 
after one of the 15-year-old girl's friends told a school counselor of her 
involvement with Acosta. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank police said Acosta drove a bus route which took the girl from Burbank 
to Toll Junior High School in Glendale, where she attended special classes for 
the hearing-impaired. Detectives said the girl fell in love with Acosta and the 
two began a relationship. Police said Acosta and the girl engaged in consensual 
sex in his van, not in the bus or on school property. 
</P>
<P>
After the arrest, Burbank Unified School District officials said they would 
consider discontinuing use of the bus company. Acosta's arrest was the fourth 
time this year Laidlaw drivers were arrested in Southern California.

DA CHARGES BRANDO'S SON WITH MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marlon Brando's 32-year-old son, who is accused of killing his pregnant 
half-sister's boyfriend at the actor's mountaintop home, was charged with 
murder today. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Brando, a self-employed welder and artist, is held without bail in 
connection with the death of Dag Drollet, 26, a guest at the sprawling, 
three-house estate on Mulholland Drive. He was the son of a well-known official 
in Papeete, the Tahitian capital. 
</P>
<P>
Brando was arraigned this afternoon in West Los Angeles Municipal Court on the 
murder charge, as well as one felony count each of illegally possessing an 
assault rifle and possession of a silencer. He was brought to court in 
handcuffs from the West Los Angeles jail for the arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office announced the charges before the arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
Drollet, shot and killed in the den of one house, reportedly was the expectant 
father of 20-year-old Cheyenne Brando's unborn child. Police said the 
mother-to-be may have been "slapped around," an apparently isolated incident 
that may have triggered the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, who has done some fashion modeling in Tahiti and reportedly came to 
Los Angeles about three weeks ago with Drollet, is believed to be about six 
months pregnant. Police said she showed no signs of injury. 
</P>
<P>
She is Marlon Brando's daughter by his current wife, Tarita Teriipia, a 
Tahitian woman who played his lover in the 1962 film version of "Mutiny on the 
Bounty." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Drollet, whose ancestors reportedly came to Tahiti from 
Denmark, was shot once in the head with a .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol, 
which was recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Marlon Brando, who reportedly tried to revive Drollet with mouth-to-mouth 
resuscitation and phoned 911 Wednesday night to request an ambulance, was 
distraught when authorities arrived. 
</P>
<P>
The 66-year-old actor urged police to take away all of his son's guns, 
including the presumed murder weapon, a .44-caliber carbine and two 
unregistered automatic weapons -- an Uzi submachine-gun and an M-14 rifle.

House and Senate negotiators failed today to agree on a long-awaited spending 
bill granting $720 million in emergency aid for Panama and Nicaragua, adding to 
delays that have prompted anger at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush requested the foreign aid months ago and he stepped up his 
campaign for the money this week with a public call for the Congress to delay 
its planned Memorial Day holiday if the bill is not finished. 
</P>
<P>
Members of a conference working out the differences between the House and 
Senate supplemental spending bills have agreed on all new spending in the 
legislation. They were to have completed their agreement today by specifying 
the defense cuts that will offset the non-mandatory spending in the bill.

A twin-engine inter-island plane crashed and exploded in a fireball in a Manila 
suburb today, killing all 21 people aboard and burning to death a family of 
four inside their home, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The propeller-driven Beechcraft 1900 aircraft went into a spin as it fell two 
minutes after takeoff from Manila's airport. 
</P>
<P>
It slammed into the main bedroom of a house leased by a Japanese businessman, 
engulfing it in flames and scattering debris and bodies over a wide area. 
</P>
<P>
The plane's burning tail came to rest by the family swimming pool. The rest of 
the aircraft exploded in pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Just before the crash, the pilot radioed the control tower that he was turning 
back because his right engine had cut out.

The oldest profession is a taxable profession, the Court of Appeal ruled today, 
rejecting a woman's argument that the government was not entitled to share her 
immoral earnings. 
</P>
<P>
"The tax man is a pimp and the government is a pimp," Marion Aken, also known 
as Miss Whiplash or Lindi St. Claire, said outside court. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, the judges held. 
</P>
<P>
"As regards the propriety of the Inland Revenue seeking to recover the proceeds 
by tax of prostitution, the revenue authorities are merely looking at the 
accomplished fact of profits from trade," Lord Justice Fox said in giving the 
court's opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Lord Justice Parker added: "There is no doubt that prostitution is a trade." 
</P>
<P>
Aken was ordered to pay $99,340, plus the government's legal costs in 
responding to her appeal.

BLOCH SURVEILLANCE DATA OKD FOR HEARING;

<P>
The State Department today won the right to use evidence gathered through 
electronic surveillance in proceedings to dismiss suspected spy Felix S. Bloch 
from the Foreign Service. 
</P>
<P>
A federal judge said in an order released today that the electronic 
surveillances were conducted lawfully under the Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Act. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Stanley Harris rejected a contention by Bloch's attorneys 
that the surveillances were illegal and could not be used in the State 
Department dismissal hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The proceeding had been scheduled to begin last week but was postponed pending 
court action on the case. 
</P>
<P>
While not charged with any crime, Bloch has been suspected by the FBI of 
selling secrets to the Soviet Union when he was posted in Europe as a diplomat, 
most recently at the U.S. Embassy in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
Bloch, a 30-year veteran of the diplomatic corps, was placed on administrative 
leave last June after the investigation began. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 8, the State Department said it had suspended Bloch's annual salary of 
$80,700 and would seek to dismiss him from the Foreign Service. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI conducted extensive surveillance of Bloch last summer while the case 
was under active investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The surveillance ended late last year after the bureau decided it was unlikely 
it could prove that Bloch passed classified information to the Soviet Union, 
according to law enforcement sources.

The National Council of Churches has approved a resolution condemning 
Christopher Columbus' arrival in the New World in 1492 because of its impact on 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution was introduced Thursday night to the ecumenical Christian group 
by the Rev. George Tinker, an Osage Indian who called Columbus' arrival an 
"invasion" that brought about the slavery and genocide of native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"American people have so digested the myth on American history that they have 
lost sight of the truth -- the pain of so many people who live on the 
continent," Tinker said. 
</P>
<P>
A competing resolution introduced by the Right Rev. David Reed, an Episcopal 
bishop from Kentucky, sought to soften the language of Tinker's offering. 
</P>
<P>
His resolution acknowledged the injustice and pain suffered by Indians after 
the arrival of Columbus and other European explorers, but sought to retain the 
"passion and words" of Tinker's resolution while adding positive aspects of the 
last 500 years. 
</P>
<P>
After a heated debate, Reed's resolution effectively was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Reed said he did not believe that anyone will take Tinker's resolution 
seriously because of its strong wording.

A subway robber took $30 from a man on a train today and then shot and killed 
another passenger who rose from his seat and yelled, "Leave him alone." 
</P>
<P>
The armed bandit staged his holdup in the next-to-last car of a train that was 
approaching a Lower Manhattan subway station shortly after 6 a.m., said Al 
O'Leary, a transit police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
As the robber took $30 from his victim, a man seated in the middle of the car, 
identified as Antonio Gonzalez, 45, rose from his seat and yelled at the 
gunman, "Leave him alone!" O'Leary said. 
</P>
<P>
The remark prompted the gunman to walk to the middle of the car, where another 
man, who had been seated next to Gonzalez, got up to confront the robber, 
O'Leary said. The bandit fired his weapon at that man but the gun jammed. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez then stood up again, inciting the gunman to pull the trigger once 
more, killing Gonzalez, O'Leary said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman fled the train at the next stop.

A prominent real estate broker on Martha's Vineyard was sentenced to five years 
in prison for fraudulently collecting nearly half a million dollars in deposits 
for oceanfront properties. 
</P>
<P>
State police said Judith C. Strimel, 41, took $485,000 in deposits from 
September, 1986, to January, 1989, for three waterfront homes in Edgartown, 
some of which, like the home of Washington Post Co. Chairman Katharine Graham, 
were not for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The money was later transferred from escrow to business accounts at Strimel's 
firm, Avery and Co., of Edgartown.

Slumping sales prompted the fraud, said Richard Piazza, assistant district 
attorney for the Cape and the Islands.

SHEARSON LEHMAN TO SPLIT OPERATIONS;

Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., the nation's second-largest securities firm, will 
reorganize by splitting its investment banking business and large retail 
brokerage operation, company sources confirmed today. 
</P>
<P>
The troubled unit of American Express Co., which lost nearly $1 billion last 
quarter, also is likely to change its name to either Shearson Lehman Holdings 
Inc. or SLH Holdings Inc., with the two separate divisions under it, said 
Shearson employees briefed on the proposed realignment. 
</P>
<P>
Shearson is the largest securities company in the country behind Merrill Lynch. 
It grew by leaps and bounds in the freewheeling boom years of the 1980s but has 
faced increasing financial and management problems in the aftermath of the 1987 
stock market crash that sent Wall Street into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
Shearson has four operating divisions: investment banking, capital markets, 
retail brokerage and asset management. 
</P>
<P>
Under the reorganization, the retail brokerage and asset management businesses 
would be combined into one division, which would include nearly 10,000 
stockbrokers catering to individual investment needs, said Shearson employees, 
who spoke on condition of anonymity. It will probably retain the Shearson name, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
The other division would include the operations in investment banking and 
capital markets and could operate under the resurrected name of Lehman 
Brothers, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The reorganization is expected to be announced before the end of the month, the 
sources said. "It could be as soon as next week, but I don't see it as a 
definite," one said. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Faigen, a spokesman for Shearson, said he couldn't confirm or deny the 
reorganization plans. 
</P>
<P>
"At this time the firm is examining a number of options that would result in a 
more customer-driven organizational structure," he said. "But we haven't made 
any decision on exactly how we'll move ahead on that score." 
</P>
<P>
Shearson, formerly known as Shearson-American Express, acquired the venerable 
Lehman Brothers, Kuhn Loeb Inc. in 1984. The merged Shearson Lehman purchased 
E. F. Hutton &amp; Co. in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The latest reorganization plan reportedly has been in the works since Howard L. 
Clark Jr., a former American Express official, became Shearson chairman earlier 
this year, replacing Peter A. Cohen, who resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Clark was unavailable for comment today, Shearson officials said. 
</P>
<P>
During the first three months of 1990, Shearson lost $915 million -- the 
largest sum in securities industry history -- in large part to pay for a 
restructuring that included 2,000 layoffs and business cuts initiated by 
American Express. 
</P>
<P>
American Express, which owns 61% of Shearson, recently signed an agreement to 
buy the rest of its outstanding common shares. American Express was forced to 
inject more than $1 billion into Shearson to raise its capital levels.

Ruling out diversification into the highly competitive civilian aviation field, 
a senior official of General Dynamics Corp. said today the company would prefer 
to lay off about 7,000 employees in face of deeper defense budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview published in today's Ft. 
</P>
<P>
Worth Star-Telegram, Charles Anderson, vice president and general manager of 
the company that makes F-16 fighter planes, said General Dynamics is not 
prepared to risk financial disaster by switching to commercial jet liners to 
make up for the lost defense business. 
</P>
<P>
"The commercial world is not as rosy out there as everybody thinks it is," said 
Anderson, who is in charge of General Dynamics's Ft. Worth division where the 
F-16s are made. "It's easy for people to say you ought to diversify, but the 
main problem is it takes a tremendous amount of cash." 
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics, headquartered in St. Louis, has already laid off 350 workers 
from the F-16 production line in the past month. Anderson said the company, 
however, will continue to make military planes at the Ft. Worth facility where 
32,000 people work.

doing interviews to promote the movie special. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we are back again," she says. "Except for 'Lucy,' I don't know of any 
other show that's been on as much as 'Green Acres.' It's on in Africa; it's 
everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
And though she loves the part, she thinks it has stereotyped her. 
</P>
<P>
"Hollywood type-casts you always. It's very difficult to get out of that. I was 
never given a chance to do a performance where the audience can see that I'm a 
serious actress," she says. 
</P>
<P>
When she arrived here from Budapest, Hungary, Gabor signed with Paramount 
Pictures and did two unmemorable movies -- "Forced Landing" in 1941 and 1942's 
"Pacific Blackout." 
</P>
<P>
Paramount soon dropped her. Television, however, was kinder, as Gabor tackled 
variety shows, guest appearances and even Chekhov, co-starring with Boris 
Karloff in "Uncle Vanya." 
</P>
<P>
People recognize her no matter where she goes, she says, oftentimes mistaking 
her for her cop-slapping sister, Zsa Zsa. Being mixed up with her sister is 
something she has had to deal with most of her life. 
</P>
<P>
"It does not help to be from a family where there is so much chaos," she says, 
and laughs. "I walk down the street and people yell, 'Hey, Zsa Zsa,' and I say, 
'Not Zsa Zsa -- Eva!' "

Japan became a "Rhythm Nation" as Janet Jackson opened her tour at the Tokyo 
Dome, cascading thunderous waves of funk and choreography over 50,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Teen-agers in miniskirts, families with children and men in business suits rose 
as one Thursday night when the pop star, silhouetted in colored smoke, was 
lifted to the massive stage on a platform and launched into "Control." 
</P>
<P>
"Want to get nasty?" she yelled as she strutted and rapped her way through 
"Nasty." Fans roared their approval but kept their decorum. 
</P>
<P>
It was the opening for Jackson's five-night appearance in Japan on her first 
world tour. She travels next to the Japanese cities of Osaka and Yokohama, back 
to the United States and then on to Europe in September. 
</P>
<P>
The energy and enthusiasm of Jackson and her 15-member troupe managed to punch 
through the cavernous expanse of Tokyo Dome, an indoor baseball stadium 
nicknamed the Big Egg. 
</P>
<P>
She donned a paramilitary uniform with medals and billed hat -- a getup 
mimicked by many of her fans -- to close the show with "Rhythm Nation," a song 
popularized by its use since January in Japan Airlines commercials. 
</P>
<P>
The choreography, a cross between break-dancing and military maneuvers, sent 
some spectators dancing into the aisles.

Borrowing a gimmick from David Letterman's late-night TV show, legislators 
adopted a resolution listing 10 reasons why he should broadcast live from 
Austin to celebrate a theater's 75th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
A regular feature on "Late Night with David Letterman" is a Top 10 list, read 
in reverse order, spoofing various topics. 
</P>
<P>
Among the reasons: 
</P>
<P>
"9. No women in Austin currently claim to be married to or even a little bit 
interested in Mr. Letterman. 
</P>
<P>
"6. A psychic channeler has determined that Mr. Letterman is the unwitting host 
for the spirit of our late President Lyndon Baines Johnson and that the oil 
bust will not be over until Dave brings Lyndon home. 
</P>
<P>
"4. The Texas National Guard has agreed to keep Cher and Shirley MacLaine 
outside the city limits during Mr. Letterman's stay, using excessive force if 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"2. During his visit, the city's 750,000 resident bats will perform the world's 
largest stupid urban bat colony trick by re-creating the astrological sign of 
Mr. Letterman's choice in the skies above Austin. 
</P>
<P>
"1. Throughout his stay, Mr. Letterman will be officially addressed by all 
Texans as 'The Great White Enchilada From Somewhere South of Poughkeepsie.' " 
</P>
<P>
The resolution by Rep. Terral Smith invites Letterman to be the Legislature's 
"honored guest" for the Paramount Theatre's 75th anniversary.

A documentary of blues man B. B. King's life, produced for the British 
Broadcasting Co.'s "Omnibus" television series, had its world premiere in his 
hometown. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from $10 ticket sales for the one-hour film will go to Indianola's 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100 people turned out for the film, which was shown at the Mid-Delta 
Arts Assn. theater. The film has yet to be broadcast in England. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the film about the blues musician was filmed in Indianola. Many scenes 
of last year's concert in Fletcher Park are included, as are local landmarks 
and citizens. The film reviews King's childhood in Indianola. 
</P>
<P>
King is giving a benefit concert June 1, with proceeds going to parks in the

Remember those kids who used to tell Art Linkletter the darndest things on TV? 
Well, they're older now, but Linkletter says he's still a kid at heart. 
</P>
<P>
When he isn't pitching recliners on television, Linkletter likes to ski, surf 
and scuba-dive -- in short, all those fun things that other young guys do. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no definition for old except attitude and mobility," the 78-year-old 
Linkletter said. "Attitude tells whether you are old or not. If you are 
curious, challenging, doing something, you are not old." 
</P>
<P>
Not that Linkletter denies that he may be getting old. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had a mid-life crisis, but 80 is daunting," he said. "This is the 
only birthday I've looked at with some suspicion. Eighty sounds pretty damn 
old." 
</P>
<P>
But it could be that when 80 arrives, Linkletter will be too busy to notice. 
</P>
<P>
The author of 23 books and the star of two of the most beloved shows in 
television history, "House Party" and "People Are Funny," is involved in a new 
project, making a home video called "How to Be a Great Grandparent."

Denver Nuggets guard Todd Lichti was in stable condition but very distraught 
today after losing his girlfriend in a one-car accident in Nevada and 
undergoing surgery on his right foot, said his family and team officials and 
his family. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors said the surgery for a broken bone in his foot was successful, but 
stressed that it is too early to determine when or whether Lichti will fully 
recover. 
</P>
<P>
But his emotional state was suffering because of the death of girlfriend 
Kristin Gravrock, 23, of Bellevue, Wash., said his mother, who spoke briefly to 
Lichti by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just beside himself," Ora Lichti told the Contra Costa Times in a story 
published today. "Physically, he's OK, but he's emotionally shot. He's really 
broken up." 
</P>
<P>
The Nevada Highway Patrol said Lichti, 23, was a passenger in the car that ran 
off Interstate 80, 30 miles east of Lovelock, Nev., and overturned in the 
median about 7:15 a.m. (Story, Section C). 
</P>
<P>
Gravrock, the driver, was pronounced dead at the scene. Troopers said that 
Lichti's face and hands were covered with blood from multiple cuts and that he 
complained of pain in his foot. 
</P>
<P>
Investigating officers said Gravrock apparently fell asleep. Her car ran off 
the right side of the highway and slid into the median when she overcorrected. 
</P>
<P>
Lichti and Gravrock began seeing each other about three months ago, and Lichti 
was bringing her home to meet his family in Northern California when the 
accident happened, Ora Lichti said. 
</P>
<P>
Lichti, a former Stanford star, was the Nuggets' first-round draft pick in the 
1989 NBA draft. He played in 79 games for the Nuggets this past season, 
starting four.

LARRY CSONKA TRIES TO ORGANIZE A NEW UNION FOR NFL PLAYERS

<P>
Hall of Fame running back Larry Csonka is trying to organize a new union for 
NFL players and part of his platform is a promise of a collective bargaining 
agreement within 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
NFL players have been without a contract since a five-year agreement expired in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL Players Assn., involved in a number of lawsuits against management, 
decertified as a union last November. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the climate is right for the players to get a contract now," said 
Csonka, who has mailed authorization cards to the players. 
</P>
<P>
Csonka sent a three-page letter to the players, emphasizing mistakes he 
believes the Players Assn. has made. "With decertification, the NFLPA is 
totally powerless to negotiate a new contract," the letter said. "Therefore, 
you have no say in your wages or working conditions." 
</P>
<P>
The letter urges the players to sign union authorization cards that are 
included in the packets Csonka sent out. He promises a contract within 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Upshaw, executive director of the NFLPA, predicted that the effort would 
fail as at least two other organizing efforts have since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"The players aren't that stupid," Upshaw said. "They understand what's going 
on. The players realize that salaries are going up, that they took in 60% of 
the gross revenues last year. The lawsuit we filed forced the Plan B (free 
agency) move and the players now realize what free agency can mean."

ANGELS MAY FILE GRIEVANCE AGAINST STEINBRENNER OVER WINFIELD TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Angels plan to file a grievance seeking damages from the New 
York Yankees over the Dave Winfield affair, New York Newsday reported today, 
but in Anaheim, General Manager Mike Port would not confirm it. 
</P>
<P>
Port told The Times this morning that although such an action is possible, no 
grievance had been filed. 
</P>
<P>
According to Newsday, Port said the grievance would be filed in the next few 
days, charging that Yankee owner George Steinbrenner's two-hour "air-clearing" 
meeting with Winfield last Monday was inappropriate and damaged the Angels' 
bargaining position. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels traded pitcher Mike Witt to New York for Winfield last Friday, but 
the outfielder refused to report, citing his right, as a 10-year player who has 
spent the last five years with the same team, to veto trades. 
</P>
<P>
The matter seemed headed for arbitration until Winfield agreed to the deal 
Wednesday when the Angels offered a three-year $9.1-million contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
While the trade was in limbo, Steinbrenner met with Winfield, assuring him that 
he would be a full-time player if an arbitrator ruled that he remain with the 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, who were using a regular job as one of their incentives to get 
Winfield to report, reportedly referred to the Steinbrenner meeting as 
"tampering in its grandest form." 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner said he saw nothing improper about meeting with Winfield, his 
longtime adversary during the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I was asked to meet with the player," he said. "And I got permission to meet 
with him before I did it. 
</P>
<P>
"I just went to tell him what had happened and clear the air on some things. 
But (the Angels) offered him a multiyear contract and I did not."

UNBRIDLED'S DERBY VICTORY: NO FLUKE FOR FRANCES GENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW BEYER, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After Unbridled crossed the finish line, television cameras focused on the 
little lady in the polka-dot suit, and a nationwide audience was touched by the 
sentimentality of the moment. At the age of 92, Frances Genter had entered a 
horse in the Kentucky Derby for the first time -- and she had won it. 
</P>
<P>
This may have appeared to be a wondrous stroke of fortune, but people in the 
racing business know that neither luck nor sentiment had anything to do with 
it. Few operations in the sport have been managed in such an intelligent and 
businesslike fashion, or have achieved such consistent success, as the Frances 
A. Genter Stable. 
</P>
<P>
The Thoroughbred Times analyzed the performance of horses bred by the stable 
over a 25-year period, and the results are stunning. More than 90% of these 
horses got to the races; 74% won at least one race; 18% won stakes. The average 
Genter-bred horse earned $63,000 in purse money. The Derby triumph was no 
fluke; it was the culmination of decades of preparation, as well as one fateful 
decision that Frances Genter made in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
Genter and her late husband, Harold, initially became interested in the sport 
as fans and bettors. Their longtime friend, John Nerud, said: "He was a 
horseplayer and she was a horseplayer. She was a good handicapper, and she 
still loves to bet." When they decided they would like to buy some horses, the 
Genters had the wherewithal to do it, for Harold was chief executive officer of 
the Toastmaster Corp. and the inventor of the pop-up toaster. They acquired 
their first horse in 1940, but it was their 1950 purchase of a horse named 
Rough 'n Tumble that spurred them to get seriously involved in racing and 
breeding. 
</P>
<P>
Rough 'n Tumble had a successful career, winning the Santa Anita Derby and 
other stakes, before he was retired to stud in Florida. The Genters then made a 
deal with the farm owner, trading him a part interest in the stallion in 
exchange for one foal from Rough 'n Tumble's first crop of offspring. According 
to Nerud, it was Frances Genter who said, "Let's take the filly" -- and 
acquired the daughter of Rough 'n Tumble, who would leave an indelible stamp on 
American racing. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever Harold Genter was perturbed, he would archly address his wife, "My 
dear girl!" Frances bestowed this name on their new filly, and My Dear Girl 
went on to become the champion 2-year-old of her generation. But what she did 
after her retirement eclipsed any of her feats on the track. 
</P>
<P>
She produced seven stakes winners, among them In Reality, who earned nearly 
$800,000 in the 1960s and went on to sire 74 stakes winners. (One was Frances 
Genter's champion sprinter, Smile.) My Dear Girl's daughters produced countless 
stakes winners, including Dr. Carter, who earned nearly $900,000. My Dear 
Girl's blood would be found in most of the Genters' successful horses for the 
next three decades -- including Unbridled. 
</P>
<P>
"That broodmare was a gold mine," said John Veitch, who formerly trained for 
the Genter Stable. "But they also knew what to do with that gold mine. They 
managed their whole band of broodmares very well." 
</P>
<P>
The Genters kept their horses at Tartan Farm in Florida, where they had the 
benefit of the counsel of Tartan's president, Nerud, an exceptional horseman 
who is enshrined in the Racing Hall of Fame. But Harold Genter didn't need -- 
or want -- anybody's advice. He would listen to his wife, but otherwise, Nerud 
said: "Old Man Genter ran the operation absolutely by himself. 
</P>
<P>
"He traveled and stayed wherever the stable was. He had his own ideas. He 
stayed with speed -- all those pedigrees with the Rough 'n Tumble background. 
And he had a theory that when a mare was 12 years old you might as well sell 
her, even though for most breeders that's still prime time." 
</P>
<P>
So Harold Genter was constantly culling and selling his and his wife's horses, 
running the stable in a businesslike fashion. The exception to this policy was 
My Dear Girl, who stayed at Tartan Farm until her death at age 30. "She was a 
whole lot of their life," Nerud said. 
</P>
<P>
When Harold's health began to fail -- he died in 1981 -- Frances' son-in-law 
Bentley Smith took over the management of the stable and viewed the job with 
the same kind of pragmatism. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be profitable," Smith said. "If we're not, we're out. We have an 
overhead of $3 million a year." He continually culls his older and 
less-successful stock horses; last fall alone the stable sold 40 horses. But 
Smith also buys horses to infuse the breeding operation with new blood. 
</P>
<P>
Because so much of the Genter bloodlines are speed-oriented, he looks for 
acquisitions that will bring some stamina to the gene pool. When Tartan Farm 
was holding its dispersal sale, Smith listened to Nerud's advice and spent 
$275,000 for a stoutly bred mare named Gana Facil and another $70,000 for her 
weanling son, who was to be named Unbridled. 
</P>
<P>
But although the Genter Stable has always been concerned with the bottom line, 
it has never pushed its trainers to get results fast -- the surest way to ruin 
promising horses. In fact, the Genters never push their trainers to do 
anything, which is one reason they have had exceptionally long and amicable 
relationships with all of the horsemen they employ. 
</P>
<P>
"They were first-class people running a first-class outfit, and you never heard 
one word of criticism from them," Nerud said. Frances Genter could have made a 
trip to Louisville as long ago as 1967, but trainer Sunshine Calvert thought it 
might be asking too much too soon to run In Reality in the Derby -- and the 
owners never questioned his decision. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of a hands-on approach to the breeding operation and a 
hands-off approach to the training continues to work for the Genter Stable. 
Smith said the stable has shown a profit in 14 of the last 15 years -- a 
remarkable performance in a sport where the vast majority of owners lose money 
every year. 
</P>
<P>
In the context of this record, it is evident that Frances Genter did not get to 
the winner's circle at Churchill Downs because of a random stroke of fate. This 
was a triumph that she had earned, and that she deserved.

SHOEMAKER ENTERS FIRST RACE AS A TRAINER

<P>
Bill Shoemaker, who retired 3 1/2 months ago as the winningest jockey in 
thoroughbred racing history, officially begins phase two of his professional 
life today -- as a trainer. 
</P>
<P>
Star Child, a 3-year-old Kentucky-bred daughter of Our Native and Ice Princess, 
is running for Shoemaker in today's fifth race at Hollywood Park, a mile 
allowance event for 3-year-old fillies on turf. One of 10 entries in the 
$32,000 race, Star Child will be ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye and was assigned 
117 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it was Delahoussaye, aboard Exemplary Leader, who won the final 
race in which Shoemaker competed, at Santa Anita on Feb. 3. Shoemaker's mount, 
Patchy Groundfog, finished fourth in the race billed as "The Legend's Last 
Ride." 
</P>
<P>
While he's a little reluctant to admit it, the man known simply as "The Shoe" 
for most of his 41 years as a rider is eager to start his new career. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just one of my horses to run. If it wasn't the first one, no one would 
care," Shoemaker said at Barn 65 South, where his stable is housed at Hollywood 
Park. "I'm excited to get her in a race. She's been training good. Hopefully, 
she'll run good." 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker said he has 24 horses in his stable. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the people just came to me," he said. "I just thought I'd start out 
with 10 or 12. It blossomed up to 24 before I knew it. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, so good. It's a different phase of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker was emphatic when asked if he missed riding. "No. I went 40 years," 
he said. "That's long enough. It's time to do something else." 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker made it clear he's determined to become more than just another 
trainer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to win the Triple Crown, or win the (Kentucky) Derby with a horse," 
he said. "I won the Derby riding a horse, I'd like to train a winner. Only one 
guy's ever done that before and that's Johnny Longden."

PREAKNESS;

<P>
OWNERS WILL RUN SUMMER SQUALL DESPITE BLEEDING FOUND IN NOSTRIL

Summer Squall won a battle in the Preakness' war of attrition today when his 
owners said he would race despite a small amount of blood found in a nostril. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Neil Howard discovered the blood in Summer Squall's nose while the 
Kentucky Derby runner-up was grazing after a morning gallop. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a little trickle after cooling out," Howard said. "He's done this 
before." 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall's 2-year-old campaign was shortened by a hairline fracture of his 
cannon bone, and he had to stop training for several weeks during the winter 
when he experienced pulmonary bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
Howard said this was not related to the earlier bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
The trainer was still confident of Summer Squall's chances despite the bleeding 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"He's done it a couple of times," Howard said. "It's a three- or four-minute 
type of thing -- nothing to worry about." 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall normally runs on the diuretic Lasix, which is used to control 
bleeding in horses. Cot Campbell, head of the Dogwood Stable syndicate that 
owns Summer Squall, said the horse did not gallop on Lasix this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, two Preakness contenders -- Pleasant Tap and Champagneforashley -- 
were sidelined by injuries, cutting the field to nine for Saturday's race. 
Pleasant Tap, third in the Derby, strained a tendon sheath in his left foreleg, 
and Champagneforashley, who passed up the Derby, broke a bone in his right 
front ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Summer Squall, also racing on Lasix are Unbridled, Music Prospector, 
Land Rush, Fighting Notion and J.R.'s Horizon. Mister Frisky, Kentucky Jazz and 
Baron de Vaux will run without medication. 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled was the 7-5 early favorite for the 1 3/16-mile race, but the 
Preakness does not appear to favor his one-run style of coming from off the 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall, the second choice at 2-1, is likely to be close to the pace, 
while Mister Frisky, who finished eighth as the Derby favorite, is likely to be 
on the lead before the race is very old on a track that favors speed. 
</P>
<P>
"On this track speed goes, and it's bye-bye baby," said Laz Barrera, Mister 
Frisky's trainer. 
</P>
<P>
If that's so, the question is how it might affect jockey Craig Perret's 
strategy with Unbridled. He has been quoted as saying he might have to make 
adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
In the Derby, Unbridled was able to come from off a very fast pace with a clear 
run that swept him past Summer Squall in the upper stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Barrera and jockey Gary Stevens would like to dictate a slower pace Saturday.

ONE-OF-A-KIND-JOB;

<P>
HER ONLY DUTY IS TO KEEP AN EYE ON A HOLE IN THE SAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is perhaps the strangest baby-sitting job in America as Linda Brower sits on 
the beach in Oceanside and watches the hole, the swirling, sinister, 
child-swallowing hole. 
</P>
<P>
Brower drops her eyes to scan passages from her usual science fiction or real 
estate books, yet she remains ever vigilant, mindful of her sole duty as sentry 
to this 20-foot-wide, 6-foot-deep hole at the seashore. 
</P>
<P>
Her job is odd and wonderful at the same time. It is both unbearably boring and 
spiritually exhilarating. It is peaceful and perilous. And monitoring this hole 
in the sand for eight hours a day, two days a week is also infinitely better 
than what Brower was doing before. 
</P>
<P>
For 15 years back in Kansas City, Mo., this blond, 41-year-old grandmother 
hand-cut stencils for lettering on bowling shirts. "Then a computer came in and 
did a better job than I could, so that was the end of my career," Brower said. 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband, now an unemployed construction worker, moved to San Diego 
County, and one day last year Brower learned of the hole. 
</P>
<P>
It is caused by Oceanside's novel sand bypass project, which restores eroded 
beaches by sucking up sand from the city marina and distributing it southward 
along the coast via a lengthy pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
When the pumps are fired up, sand and water are forced out at places along the 
pipeline. But, at the point where the pipeline narrows south of the Oceanside 
Pier, the pressure is more ferocious, creating a powerful jet of water that 
bores a hole in the sand. It's like squirting a garden hose into soft dirt. 
</P>
<P>
This turgid, roiling creation needed an alert, stolid master to warn the 
innocent to beware. 
</P>
<P>
So reasoned the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which manages the sand bypass 
project, and Healy Tibbitts Builders, the subcontractor that operates it. 
</P>
<P>
Brower was hired early in October for $8.50 an hour to embark on a new career 
adventure as possibly the nation's only hole sitter. After all, as Dana 
Whitson, a city official, pointed out, there is but one such sand bypass in the 
entire United States. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of a kind," Whitson said. 
</P>
<P>
And perhaps so is Brower. 
</P>
<P>
Tending a hole for a livelihood may be slightly absurd, and even Brower 
concedes "it is a little strange. I never would have thought of this back in 
Missouri." 
</P>
<P>
Yet it is an occupation ideal for a person such as she, who craves sunshine and 
the gently mesmerizing sea. The hole is a place for Brower to eat her apples 
and oranges and read half a book a day when things are quiet. They aren't 
always, though, because the hole is a relentless tempter. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it gets real tense, you get 40, 50 kids who want to get in that 
thing at one time," said Brower, who usually manages to ward off the unduly 
inquisitive before it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the hole beckons, and children have on occasion suddenly vanished into 
the dark water just feet from where Brower stations her low beach chair. But, 
before the hole could have its evil way, Brower boldly plunged in, and she 
knows from experience the depth of her adversary. 
</P>
<P>
"Not by choice, but I've been in there a couple of times," she said. "In the 
center, where the water pressure is highest, it's been over my head." She is 5 
feet, 5 inches tall. 
</P>
<P>
There have been other frights for Brower, like the time she spotted fins 
cutting along the ocean. "The first time I saw a dolphin, I thought it was a 
shark. I'm from Missouri," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the monotony is maddening, but then the familiar characters will 
wander along to keep Brower company. 
</P>
<P>
There's Bruce, the bird. "I like to feed the birds, they're quite humorous. One 
sea gull, I call him Bruce, he squawks loud and chases the other birds away. 
He's a big hog," she said. 
</P>
<P>
And there is the usual cast of local street people who know they always have a 
friend to talk to. 
</P>
<P>
One man, "he would act like a bird and have fistfights in the air with whoever. 
But he never did anything obnoxious," Brower said. "He said the Army made him 
crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Many times she just dawdles in easy conversation with strangers. "I like 
people, so it doesn't bother me. I've heard so many life stories and sad 
stories. They know I'm not any threat to them, and they can tell me anything 
they want," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the hole is ever and silently demanding, and, even when it rains, 
although Brower retreats to the cover of a nearby public restroom, she manages 
to keep the hole under strict surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
By mid-afternoon, after an eight-hour shift, the sand bypass project stops 
pumping, and the hole fills with sand and becomes dormant. That is, until the 
next time. 
</P>
<P>
Brower heads for home, usually at peace. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to feel career-motivated, you know, make the real money. But I guess 
I've mellowed out in life," she said. 
</P>
