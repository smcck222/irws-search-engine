KOOP TO RETIRE

<TEXT>
<P>
Many thanks to the retiring U.S. surgeon general, Dr. C. Everett Koop. How 
refreshing to have had a leader who respected us, who told us the truth! His 
insistence on "our right to know" was proof of that respect. 
</P>
<P>
His anti-smoking message, his enlightened, humane concern for AIDS victims and 
his campaign for sex education show what a difference one person can make. 
</P>
<P>
He has been a vitally important voice. That voice will be missed.

YOSEMITE PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Developments at Yosemite Park," editorial, May 8: 
</P>
<P>
I would agree that a serious reassessment of park policy be a top priority for 
this national treasure. What are we looking for when visiting this scenic 
valley? An escape from city congestion and stress? I've seen that same 
atmosphere on a crowded summer weekend at Yosemite. Some pure air and majestic 
scenery? If you can see through the smog that often hangs in the valley you may 
realize that the pollutants which are destroying our local San Bernardino 
forest will work just as well in a Sierra forest. 
</P>
<P>
A chance to "get back to nature?" A questionable request from the visitor 
booked in at the Ahwahnee Hotel and traveling in air-conditioned, 8-cylinder 
style. Why must so many people insist on making the environment play by our 
rules? Instead, Yosemite visitors should be educated and encouraged to adapt to 
the rules of nature. Let's camp out, dirty our clothes, shiver during a late 
April snow flurry, and sweat on a hot August afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Let's lose our car keys for a day (as a start!) and introduce our sedentary 
bodies to other forms of transportation. As the late Edward Abbey said, "A man 
on foot, on horseback or on a bicycle will see more, feel more, enjoy more in 
one mile than the motorized tourists can in a hundred miles." I think when 
discussing future policy regarding Yosemite that focusing on the best interests 
of the environment will ultimately serve all of us best in the quality and 
longevity of this national park.

CURBING OUR LOTTERY FEVER

<TEXT>
<P>
Not being a Washington writer, physician, lawyer, university professor or 
anything else of consequence, I cannot expect space equal to that accorded to 
Peirce, but I can wish that you will print a letter response. 
</P>
<P>
The column is a scarcely-disguised advocacy of prohibition from gambling. While 
some of his suggestions have some validity from a view of public economy, e.g., 
the business of advertising, the gist of the article is that people, especially 
poor people, don't know how best to spend their money. 
</P>
<P>
However arrogant this and other expositions on the subject are, including The 
Times' own editorial hostility to lotteries, its greater sin is smugness. Has 
not Peirce ever heard of a simple thing called hope? When you're down, perhaps 
down and nearly out, hope goes a very long way. And it is not the same thing as 
an unreasonable expectation. 
</P>
<P>
Let comfortable people with discretionary funds engage in the random but holy 
process of stock trading; let those who wish to do so buy lottery tickets.

IN SEARCH OF BALANCED EXPORT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The strong showing of American industrial exports in March affirms the nation's 
new competitiveness in world markets and serves as a useful reminder of the 
importance of moving ahead with the new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT) to make world commerce even freer. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush's Economic Policy Council has, at the same time, made a positive 
contribution to trade negotiations with its proposals for dealing with 
allegedly unfair practices on the part of America's trading partners. That 
report proposes strict limitations on retaliation in handling complaints under 
the omnibus trade legislation adopted last year, avoiding provocative responses 
that could touch off a trade war just when there is the promise of substantial 
progress in the GATT talks. 
</P>
<P>
The record exports of March helped reduce, but not eliminate, the trade 
deficit, continuing for the second year a trend of significant improvement. If 
this trend continues, the year will end with a deficit of $110 billion compared 
with $120 billion last year and $152 billion in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
There are two evident problems that need attention: oil and the value of the 
dollar. Increased oil imports at a time of rising petroleum prices were a major 
factor in offsetting some of the positive impact of the exports. The nation's 
oil conservation efforts are weakening. And the rise of the dollar to the 
highest level in more than a year could brake the export surge, making American 
goods costlier on foreign markets while making foreign goods cheaper on the 
U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen whether central bank interventions will succeed in 
stabilizing the dollar and returning it to a more competitive lower level. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Mosbacher, the secretary of commerce, tempered his enthusiasm about the 
March trade figures with some common sense. "These numbers support our 
contention that a favorable movement in exports and imports is under way," he 
said. "Nonetheless, monthly trade figures are too volatile, and it would be 
unwise to put too much weight on any one or two months' data." 
</P>
<P>
That volatility may account for the hesitancy of export industries to 
demonstrate confidence in the export trend by enlarging their plants. Many of 
them are operating close to plant capacity, which could translate into stagnant 
exports.

ALASKA SPILL AND 'BIG OIL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank God for Rep. Mel Levine ("Alaska Spill Energizes Vigilance in 
California," Op-Ed Page, May 8) and all your other writers, for keeping the 
horror and devastation of the Valdez oil spill alive and ticking before the 
public eye. Perhaps the public will eventually see what oil industry white lies 
and public apathy can do. 
</P>
<P>
It makes me disgusted and sad to see the animals, birds, and the marine life 
dying from the oil that was so carelessly spilled. 
</P>
<P>
It makes me raging mad that Exxon is so irresponsible about cleaning up the 
mess. I'll bet they're right on top of things when getting their oil leases 
from the government. In fact, Exxon action can be real swift. Recently Exxon 
agreed to give $4 million toward a public information campaign to offset the 
effects of the Valdez accident on Alaska's tourism industry. 
</P>
<P>
When selfish or monetary reasons are at the core, action occurs, doesn't it? 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Conrad, too. His cartoon on "Whitewash" (May 8) describes it all to a 
T.

ALASKA SPILL AND 'BIG OIL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Colman McCarthy really laid it on the line in his column " 'Big Oil' Is All of 
Us" (Editorial Page, May 13). And he is right too. We did reduce our national 
oil consumption from 18.5 million barrels per day in 1979 to 15.5 million in 
1982-83. But since then, we are back to our guzzling and are now using 17 
million per day. Since U.S. oil production continues to slide, imports are 
rising sharply and have more than doubled to 8 million barrels per day from 
1985 to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
As McCarthy describes, a congressman cuts up his Exxon credit card and 
environmentalists rant and rave about the oil companies. However, a lot more 
people would rant and rave if there weren't enough gasoline to fill their tanks 
or oil to heat their homes. So tankers keep coming from OPEC countries to fill 
our growing demand. 
</P>
<P>
Every time the environmentalists win a battle against offshore drilling and 
against development of the Alaskan North Slope Wildlife Preserve, that assures 
that more and more OPEC oil in tankers will be coming to the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, importing more oil will assure a faster return to power of the 
OPEC countries and their ability to control prices. If you think the price of 
oil is high right now, just wait until OPEC is really in the driver's seat 
again!

CURBING OUR LOTTERY FEVER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The column on curbing lotteries was excellent, especially for its inclusion of 
seven suggestions for lessening today's gambling craze. 
</P>
<P>
However, in his listing of our assorted lottery "rashes" he neglected to 
mention the most image-damaging, heart-breaking, hard-work canceling, unfair 
lottery that could possibly be imagined that was announced recently by none 
other than our State Department in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
A Times report (Part I, May 10) declares that more than 3 million people from 
around the world, all eligible, have applied for visas to live in the United 
States. Have their names been taken in the order in which they applied? No. 
There is to be a computer visa lottery for 10,000 of them in 1991, and for 
another 10,000 the following year. 
</P>
<P>
It would appear that now we are making U.S. citizenship possible as the product 
of an addiction! Move over, drugs, alcohol, tobacco and gambling. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, for shame!

An Atlanta resident has accused actor Rob Lowe in a civil lawsuit of making 
sexual videotapes with a minor female. The lawsuit was filed against the Brat 
Pack star on Friday in Fulton County State Court. The lawsuit alleges that Lowe 
seduced a minor into appearing in the tapes with him and another person while 
he was in Atlanta for last summer's Democratic National Convention. The lawsuit 
contends the 25-year-old actor "used his celebrity status as an inducement to 
females to engage in sexual intercourse, sodomy and multiple party sexual 
activity for his immediate sexual gratification and for the purpose of making 
pornographic films of these activities." The lawsuit, obtained by an Atlanta 
television station, was sealed within an hour of its filing. Fulton County 
Dist. Atty. Lewis Slaton said he has a copy of the tape and is reviewing it to 
determine whether criminal charges would be filed. Criminal charges would 
include allegations that Lowe violated Georgia statutes involving the making of 
pornographic movies with minors, Slaton said. The penalty upon a conviction is 
1 to 20 years in prison. Lowe was out of the country an unavailable for 
comment. Claudia Puig

A Pittsburgh radio station that wanted to call attention to its new format 
played part of the same song for two days, prompting listeners worried about 
the station's disc jockeys to flood emergency, FBI and police lines with 
telephone calls, officials said. WYDD-FM started playing the song "What's on 
Your Mind" by Information Society at 6 p.m. Tuesday, and when it got to the 
phrase "pure energy," repeated it over and over until 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, when 
the station changed to its new format. Program director Rick Sklar made a tape 
loop that "just kept repeating, 'Pure energy, pure energy,' " said Bob Hank, 
station general manager. The new station's theme is "Energy 105," based on the 
new call letters, W-N-R-J. But listeners hoping for the usual tunes became 
alarmed when regular music never came on and began phoning the station, the 
police, the 911 emergency number and the FBI, said station general manager Bob 
Hank. After the station realized listeners were worried, it ran teasers on the 
promotion's second day saying the stuck record was intentional, Hank said. "We 
were just trying to draw a little bit of attention," he said. "We never dreamed 
it would go this far." Claudia Puig

Actress Kathleen Turner may be evicted from her New York cooperative apartment 
house, if the building's board members have their way. Turner allegedly sublet 
her apartjment to her sister-in-law without the board's permission, according 
to court papers. A hearing on the conflict, scheduled for Thursday in 
Manhattan's state Supreme Court, was re-scheduled for June 29. Turner now lives 
with her husband, Jay Weiss, in a Greenwich Village townhouse. After a year of 
being unable to find a buyer for the 10th-floor apartment at 148 W. 23rd St., 
they decided to sublet it and asked the board's permission to do so. Turner 
said in court papers that she got no reply, so a year later she renewed her 
request, specifying her sister-in-law Laurie Weiss Howell and her husband as 
subtenants. On May 1, the Howells moved into Turner's apartment. On May 2, the 
board notified Turner she had violated co-op rules and threatened to terminate 
her apartment lease. Claudia Puig

If you're just counting heads, Saturday's opening half of the two-day Country 
Fest '89 was a colossal flop. Measured against last year's turnout of more than 
30,000 a day, the estimated 6,000 people in attendance left stretches of the 
vast Santa Fe Dam Recreation Area in Irwindale virtually deserted. 
</P>
<P>
Musically, however, the program provided an interesting mix of more than 30 
knowns (including Ray Price, Roger Miller and Juice Newton) and unknowns from 
the country world and its rock and folk-influenced tangents. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the poor turnout -- attributed in part by organizer Milt Petty to 
lack of a promotion budget -- led directly to the artistic highlight of the 
10-hour event. 
</P>
<P>
Due to the lack of box-office receipts, Petty said he was unable to make a 
payment to a sound equipment operator at a contracted time during the 
afternoon. The operator then ordered the plugs pulled and the fest's four music 
stages stood silent. 
</P>
<P>
While Petty and the operator huddled, some of the musicians tried to make the 
best of a bad situation using a little down-home resourcefulness. 
</P>
<P>
On one stage, the very un-down-home Ethel and the Shameless Hussies (a trio of 
country comediennes), went ahead undaunted and un-miked with a few dozen fans 
gathered up to the stage. 
</P>
<P>
Near a second stage, Guy Clark, a veteran Austin singer-songwriter, was joined 
by New York folk-blues guitarist David Bromberg for an unscheduled jam session 
and sing-along down on the lawn for about the same size gathering. 
</P>
<P>
With power restored about half an hour later, the pair were joined on stage by 
Jerry Jeff Walker (scheduled to perform by himself later on another stage) for 
a few songs, with performers and fans alike clearly pumped up by the 
spontaneity that had been forced upon them. 
</P>
<P>
To top it off, an inspired Michelle Shocked followed with the day's revelation: 
Heretofore an activist folkie, the wispy Texan made the giant leap to activist 
rocker, fronting a smoking band led by producer-guitarist Pete Anderson. The 
usually shy Shocked, whose solo performances had changed from personable to 
predictable during the last year, proved an unlikely natural as she giddily 
rocked out on the likes of "If Love Was a Train" and several enticing new 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
Few of the 6,000 even saw that, though. Most settled in at the Silver Bullet 
stage, which featured the biggest name attractions of the day. 
</P>
<P>
That left only about 75 people at each of the other stages where the day's high 
points were unfolding, though larger crowds might have made the acoustic 
goings-on impractical.

POP CAPSULES : THE WINANS AND WHITNEY HOUSTON AT THE WILTERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Singing Winans actually outnumber singing Jacksons, and most of the vocally 
prodigious Detroit family -- which has successfully brought gospel lyrics to 
the black pop mainstream -- made it to the stage in a sometimes indulgent but 
always passionate performance Friday night at the sold-out Wiltern Theatre. 
Brother and sister BeBe &amp; CeCe Winans were joined by several more sibling 
Winans, Mom and Dad Winans, and even prominently featured Whitney Winans. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Houston was introduced by her real name but might as well have been 
family, sharing as she does their way of swooping and dipping all over a poor, 
defenseless syllable. Call it the Megalo-Melismatic school. The show's second 
half was filled with what the New Testament writers might call "vain 
repetition": ballads stretched out so the singers could challenge each other 
with repeated renderings of the same word or phrase. Showing off for the Lord? 
Maybe. But the more compact, upbeat numbers offered a joyously noisy brand of 
bouncy black pop all too rarely heard with any kind of lyric these days. CHRIS 
WILLMAN

SOUTHWEST CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY IN PASADENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY McQUILKIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Southwest Chamber Music Society's four pieces by 20th-Century Americans 
Friday at the Pasadena Public Library underscored the pleasures still available 
in works from the non-experimental ranks of composers. 
</P>
<P>
Pianist Albert Dominguez opened with Five "Anniversaries" by Leonard Bernstein. 
These cleverly wrought trifles sparkle with rhythmic vigor and melodic charm; 
Dominguez brought control and clarity to his playing. 
</P>
<P>
He later offered Elliott Carter's Sonata (1946). The pianist capitalized on the 
work's frequent and marked contrasts. He delivered the powerful pronouncements 
with authority and the gentle interludes with sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
Wide contrasts also abound in Copland's "Vitebsk," and violinist Kimiyo Takeya, 
cellist Richard Treat and Dominguez effectively made the most of them. 
</P>
<P>
Though each work on the program falls within the pale of American 
neoclassicism, Halsey Stevens' Trio No. 2 provides a textbook example of the 
style. The three easily conveyed the work's breezy lyricism and ebullient 
vitality. TERRY McQUILKIN

COMPOSERS' COMPETITION WINNERS PERFORM AT USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For most of the past decade, the National Assn. of Composers USA has made a 
fetish of providing recognition to young musicians willing to specialize in 
contemporary music. Friday night at USC, two of the winners in these Young 
Performers' Competitions displayed their expertise. 
</P>
<P>
Soprano Jennifer Cable and flutist Rachel Rudich offered a short but 
substantial program of works by Karlheinz Stockhausen, Raoul Pleskow, Marshall 
Bialosky, Harvey Sollberger, Miriam Gideon, Brian Ferneyhough, Ursula Mamlok 
and Lee Hoiby; their performances proved clarified and bracing. 
</P>
<P>
Rudich's playing of Sollberger's "Riding the Wind," Parts II, III and IV, for 
solo flute (1973-74) seems to exhaust the possibilities of extended techniques 
for the instrument while contemplating musical materials that invite 
reconsideration. Here, one had to admire the flutist's deep virtuosity and 
probing seriousness, just as one had to marvel at her ability to memorize, play 
and dance a complicated Stockhausen score. 
</P>
<P>
Cable, sympathetically supported by pianist Phillip Young, negotiated the 
myriad difficulties in 11 songs by five contrasting composers. Of particular 
interest were Bialosky's touching "Three Short Songs for Voice Alone," to 
Dickinson texts, and Gideon's tortured, restlessly atonal cycle, "Poet to 
Poet." Mamlok's "Daybreak" and two Hoiby songs reminded us that neo-Romanticism 
is alive and well. DANIEL CARIAGA

BOULEZ IN MAZE OF MAHLER 9TH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, Times Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When one thinks of Gustav Mahler, one doesn't automatically think of Pierre 
Boulez. 
</P>
<P>
Mahler is indulgent in his passions. He is prone to extremes of dramatic agony 
and lyrical ecstasy. He is a prime exponent of heroic Angst, a protagonist of 
ethereal dreams, a poignant witness to the crisis of romanticism in decay. 
</P>
<P>
Boulez, both as composer and conductor, tends to be cool. He savors analytical 
virtues, cultivates objectivity, stresses clarity and balance where others want 
to gild emotional lilies. He is, in the best sense, a modernist. 
</P>
<P>
At first thought, the combination of Mahler and Boulez may seem unlikely, even 
perverse. But under the right conditions, the two actually can bring out the 
best in each other. 
</P>
<P>
The conditions were emphatically right Saturday night at Royce Hall, UCLA, 
where Boulez led the Los Angeles Philharmonic through the daunting maze of 
Mahler's Ninth Symphony. The performance, installment No. 2 in the three-part 
Festival Boulez, offered numerous revelations. 
</P>
<P>
Boulez' attitude toward this music isn't exactly idiomatic. There certainly are 
other ways to deal with Mahler's sprawling valedictory. 
</P>
<P>
The majestic Germanic conductors of the past did not shrink from the vast 
spatial, dynamic and expressive contrasts in the score. In their quest for 
superhuman impact, however, they ran the risk of exaggerating what arguably was 
already exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
Boulez allows no such risk. He limits the exposition to a mere -- everything is 
relative -- 80 minutes. He refuses to stretch the line, overload the sentiment, 
thicken the texture or push the scale. 
</P>
<P>
He obviously believes that Mahler's emotional appeal needs no help from the 
conductor. In fact, he suggests that interpretive restraint can enhance the 
inherent pathos. 
</P>
<P>
He suggested similar things, it should be remembered, when he created a sonic 
"Ring" in Bayreuth to complement the revolutionary staging of Patrice Chereau. 
Confounding the fears of Wagnerian traditionalists, he proved that fresh 
intellectual insights still could be illuminating, even in Valhalla. 
</P>
<P>
Boulez' Mahler is not shattering in the conventional sense. But it is intensely 
moving and valid on its own introspective terms. And it certainly isn't vulgar. 
</P>
<P>
Its impact is predicated on telling application of color and nuance, on 
impeccably gauged climaxes and delicately sustained tensions. Boulez' 
perspective refuses to obscure the cumulative impact of the long, taut line. 
</P>
<P>
One can be grateful, especially in the often overwrought churnings of the 
Ninth, that this conductor will not bludgeon with bombast. He focuses, wherever 
possible, on the calm rather than the storm. 
</P>
<P>
He isolates the insistent wry humor in the folksy dance pattern of the second 
movement. He defines the repetitive grotesquerie of the following rondo with 
dry precision and finds catharsis in simplicity when nearing the final, 
reluctant cadence of the adagio. 
</P>
<P>
He also makes the Los Angeles Philharmonic sound like a great, lean, virtuoso 
orchestra. It doesn't always sound like that. 
</P>
<P>
The Mahler Ninth requires no curtain raiser, no programmatic throat clearing. 
Nevertheless, Boulez opened the concert with some useful attention to historic 
miniatures of Webern. 
</P>
<P>
First he demonstrated the elegant agitation of the still-romantic Passacaglia, 
Opus 1 (1908). Then he reveled in the harmonic daring, structural concentration 
and sheer sonic glitter of the Six Pieces for Orchestra, written in 1910 -- the 
same year as the Mahler Ninth. 
</P>
<P>
The performance was a model of finesse. The juxtaposition was jolting.

CALFEST PUTS 'GEOGRAPHY' ON THE MAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South Coast Repertory had a big weekend. The industrious playgoer could see new 
plays by Marlane Meyer, Beth Henley and Robert Daseler, and attend readings of 
new scripts by Sam Garcia Jr. and Philip Kan Gotanda, all part of SCR's 
California Play Festival -- Calfest. 
</P>
<P>
With time for only one show, I chose Meyer's "The Geography of Luck." This 
started as a reading at the Los Angeles Theatre Center and will return there 
for a mainstage production in August. It's a work in transition, although you 
wouldn't know it from Roberta Levitow's assured SCR production, featuring Ebbe 
Roe Smith as an ex-con trying to connect with his life and Elizabeth Ruscio as 
a woman who is ready to help him, up to a point. 
</P>
<P>
This is Meyer's third play (after "Etta Jenks" and "Kingfish") and we begin to 
see where her concerns lie. She's not endorsing "attitude" for attitude's sake 
-- although her characters are masters of it. She knows that they are hurting, 
and she suggests that the hurt runs through the culture. 
</P>
<P>
She's particularly concerned with men, because they run things. She presents 
them as landlocked creatures with a primitive response system, rising only to 
power games and sex. What a pity, she says, that they can't respond to the 
woman in themselves. What a tragedy that real women have to descend to their 
archetypes to find a place in the world. 
</P>
<P>
We could sense Meyer's concerns in "Etta Jenks" and "Kingfish," but they are 
literally spelled out in "The Geography of Luck," not to the improvement of the 
play. The setting is Las Vegas, a world of strippers and used-car sharpsters. 
Levitow's SCR cast makes us believe in their sleaze, and we neither expect nor 
want them to talk like normal people -- brigands deserve a language of their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
It can even be a little high-flown. Thieves do believe that they know it all. 
But when Meyer's characters start to talk about "demystifying the landscape," 
one wonders why such informed sensibilities are still drinking Ripple with 
their fish sticks. Without losing its fantasy, the language of the play needs 
to be taken down a peg. 
</P>
<P>
There is a play here. The story suggests "Tender Mercies" -- an ex-country 
singer (Smith) gets redeemed by a good woman (Ruscio). Here, though, the hero 
is just out of the pen for having killed his wife. He's also haunted by the 
goddess-like image of his mother, a former showgirl (Joan Stuart-Morris). Not 
until she becomes just an image, will he be free. 
</P>
<P>
His liberation isn't spelled out, simply played, and it registers. Less 
explanation might also deepen the scene where Smith forces his mean-mouthed 
father (Al Ruscio) to accept his love -- a fight scene, paradoxically. There's 
sound mythic stuff bubbling under "The Geography of Luck," if Meyer would just 
remove the footnotes. 
</P>
<P>
Smith and Elizabeth Ruscio are very strong at the center of the play. Neither 
asks for sympathy from the audience, and each gets it. Fine, cold supporting 
performances come from John Nesci, Scott Burkholder, Ismael (East) Carlo, 
Dendrie Taylor and the aforementioned Stuart-Morris, doubling as a customer who 
takes Smith for a ride. 
</P>
<P>
Cliff Faulkner's setting isn't lavish -- not with all those other plays on the 
budget -- but Susan Denison Geller's costumes are properly hostile and Tom 
Ruzika's lights convey the hellishness of a town that never sleeps. Orpheus in 
Vegas: it fits. 
</P>

THE REVOLUTION WILL NOT BE TELEVISED;

ANCHORS CAME FOR SUMMIT, WALKED INTO HISTORY

NEW YORK

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cable News Network anchor Bernard Shaw, still in Beijing, spent Sunday fully 
expecting the authorities to cut all phone lines out of China, severing the 
last link of live reports by foreign broadcasters there. 
</P>
<P>
And then, he said in a late-night phone interview as Army troops massed to 
clear Tian An Ming Square of hundreds of thousands of protesters, "We just sit 
here until the government feels it has control of the situation and can loosen 
the screws." 
</P>
<P>
CBS' Dan Rather, meanwhile, arrived home in New York, instructed by his bosses 
to leave Beijing Saturday when, he said, it appeared the airport might be shut 
down. He stopped in Tokyo to drop off news footage taped before and after 
authorities ordered CBS and CNN to shut down their portable transmitters and 
pulled the plug for NBC and ABC at the state-run China Central Television 
satellite uplink station. 
</P>
<P>
The live shots of the CBS and CNN shutdowns Friday night -- CNN was first to go 
at 7:05 p.m. PDT (11:05 a.m. Saturday in Beijing), followed by CBS at 8:49 p.m. 
PDT -- dramatically symbolized the news dimout for American and other foreign 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
But their reports continued by phone, with their networks showing photos of the 
reporters, maps of Beijing, pre-shutdown tapes or fresh footage taped despite 
severe restrictions by Chinese authorities and "pigeoned" out of Beijing by 
departing staffers or travelers. 
</P>
<P>
It all occurred in an extraordinary week for the networks -- one that began 
with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's historic China visit, and evolved into 
high-tension confrontations that had exhausted reporters and producers working 
almost nonstop. 
</P>
<P>
It was a particularly extraordinary week for both Shaw and Rather. The latter, 
in addition to signing off Friday as CBS' plug was pulled, also anchored a "48 
Hours" special Thursday from Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
"Unbelievable -- we all came here to cover a summit and we walked into a 
revolution," Shaw told viewers shortly before CNN's satellite link was cut, 
preceded by dramatic split-screen shots of Jane Maxwell, CNN special events 
vice president in Atlanta, talking with officials in Beijing, trying to keep 
the video line open. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally expect next a cutting of all telephone communications out of here 
and a shutting down of the airport," Shaw said Sunday. "I just regard it as 
standard operating procedure." 
</P>
<P>
On CBS' Sunday newscast, CBS Beijing bureau chief John Sheahan, was reporting 
live by phone of the possibility of a "massacre" in the streets when army 
troops moved to clear Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, Shaw said, the government had briefly jammed reception of 
network newscasts dealing with the China story. That stopped, he said, "but I 
expect it to continue." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw and Rather were the only American network news anchors on the scene all 
week, NBC and ABC having decided to keep Tom Brokaw and Peter Jennings here. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a hell of a story," said Rather, adding that he wanted to stay but that 
CBS officials, who only had 20 minutes to decide whether he should catch what 
might prove the last flight from Beijing for a while, told him to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Rival ABC and NBC had correspondents reporting from Beijing, but the sounds of 
teeth gnashing in envy could be heard in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting our butts kicked," one stateside NBC producer moaned to a friend 
earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
For NBC, the timing of its keep-Brokaw-here decision was awkward. Friday's 
plug-pulling in Beijing came as NBC's affiliates were gathering in San 
Francisco for their annual convention. 
</P>
<P>
But NBC News President Michael Gartner didn't think the decision was a 
mistake."No, of course not," he said Saturday from San Francisco. Referring to 
NBC's staff in Beijing, including Asian veterans George Lewis and Kenley Jones, 
he said he was "happy with the work that everybody who's been over there. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
ABC sent a 30-man crew that among other things shot footage of CNN's 
plug-pulling, 20 seconds of which it provided CNN late Friday. But worried 
about a potentially explosive situation in Panama, the network kept Jennings 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Like others in CNN's 60-member delegation, Shaw, who celebrates his 49th 
birthday today, had averaged only about two or three hours of sleep a day, 
feeding the 24-hour-a-day network with constant updates watched closely by both 
American viewers and rival networks. 
</P>
<P>
CBS' Sheahan, part of CBS' 60-member Beijing contingent, wasn't surprised that 
authorities ordered CBS' satellite uplink shut down hours before CBS' 
permission to use it expired. 
</P>
<P>
Incredibly, about 600 viewers in New York were outraged and called in 
complaints Friday night -- not about the government's action, but CBS' two live 
reports -- one for three minutes, then other for 18 minutes -- that interrupted 
the season-ending episode of "Dallas." Later, the broadcast of "Beauty and the 
Beast" in Los Angeles was interrupted for another 3-minute live report from 
Beijing that ended at 8:49 PDT, when a network technician flicked a switch and 
the screen faded to video snow. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the protests, Rather said he'd heard that one viewer called to say, "I 
was watching Dan Rather and he was interrupted by 'Dallas,' and what's going on 
here?' " 
</P>
<P>
Shaw, who with colleagues Mike Chinoy, Steve Hurst and producer Alec Miran 
worked in relays, wasn't surprised that phone links weren't shut down at the 
same time the government pulled the plug on video transmissions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they want to get everything lined up" before they start quelling 
demonstrations, he said. "They want it to be precise . . . they want whatever 
they do to be effective." 
</P>
<P>
With phone links still open Friday night, it was possible for CNN's Beijing 
staff to Fax the government's official, written, earth-station shut-down order 
to CNN executive Jane Maxwell in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
She said the authorities threatened to confiscate CNN's satellite uplink if the 
order wasn't obeyed. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a real concern," she said Saturday, shortly after an ABC News crew, 
as part of its coverage of the story, taped an interview with her. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters in Beijing had another major concern when martial law was imposed 
Friday. It was Municipal Order No. 3, in which foreign reporters' movements 
were sharply restricted, and taping and interviews with Chinese forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
The movement restrictions, CBS bureau chief Sheahan said by phone Saturday, 
included barring reporters from Tian An Men Square, a 40-minute drive from the 
CBS encampment at a hotel with a now-ironic name -- the Shangri-La Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, he'd met with no hostility from the students, their professors 
and ordinary residents of Beijing, even though on Saturday "they kept coming up 
to us and saying, 'Well, haven't you heard? You foreigners aren't allowed to be 
here, to take pictures.' 
</P>
<P>
"We'd ask, 'Do you want us to leave?' And they'd say, 'No, no, you must tell 
the world what's going on here.' "

The signed photos on the celebrity wall at Sal's Famous Pizzeria in the 
Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn are familiar to everyone. Frank Sinatra. 
Sophia Loren. Al Pacino. Joe DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, as the angry young black they call Buggin Out sees it, is that the 
subjects are all Italian and Sal's customers are mostly black. How about 
putting some black faces up there on that wall, Sal? 
</P>
<P>
"Because I own this place and I'm Italian," Sal says. "You buy your own place, 
you can put up pictures of anybody you want." 
</P>
<P>
That basic disagreement provides the spark on an already smoldering summer day 
that leadsto the violent last-reel riot in Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing," a 
film that has people here believing it is both good enough to win the top prize 
at the Cannes Film Festival and strong enough to incite riots back home. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not make this movie to incite riots; that's the thing people are going 
to hang me for," Lee said, shortly before a press conference Friday. "I do not 
think that black people will watch this movie and come out wanting to tear 
things up." 
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Lee got a huge ovation -- a rare show of appreciation 
from the international body of reporters and critics -- then was asked to 
defend an ambiguous ending that seems to condone violence. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not Jesus, I don't have any solutions," Lee said. "All I can do is show 
the problem so we can talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
"Do the Right Thing," a $6-million film set for release in the United States by 
Universal on June 30, is an anatomy of a riot -- one day on one block in one 
racially tense neighborhood when the temperature and the temperaments both soar 
above 100. 
</P>
<P>
Lee, the film's writer, director, producer and star, said the story was 
inspired by the 1986 Howard Beach incident, in which a young black man was 
killed by a car while fleeing from whites chasing him with baseball bats and 
tree limbs. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt in my mind there would have been a riot that night if it had 
happened in the summer," Lee said. "In fact, it happened in the dead of winter 
when no one was on the street." 
</P>
<P>
For "Do the Right Thing," Lee took the basic outline of the Howard Beach 
incident, plus elements from a separate event where a black youth was killed by 
police, and set his story around a family pizzeria that serves as the social 
hub of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The first two-thirds of the movie is a funny and effective street comedy, 
following an array of locals around the neighborhood. Among them are: Sal 
(Danny Aiello) and his two bickering sons; Da Mayor (Ossie Davis), a homeless 
philosopher living in the past; Mother-Sister (Ruby Dee), the neighborhood 
matriarch; Mookie (Lee), the aimless pizza delivery man who lives for his 
paydays; and two angry youths -- Buggin Out and Radio Raheam, who wears 
"LOVE-HATE" brass knuckles and carries a ghetto blaster that is constantly 
blowing out the song "Fight the Power." 
</P>
<P>
There's also Mister Senior Love Daddy, a radio deejay who does his show from a 
bay-window perch that gives him a view of the block and the trouble that's 
brewing there. 
</P>
<P>
What Mister Senior Love Daddy sees in the street is as unsettling a dramatic 
conclusion as any major studio has ever paid for, and Universal Pictures, which 
spent last summer defending its release of Martin Scorsese's "The Last 
Temptation of Christ," may spend this summer defending the timing of "Do the 
Right Thing." 
</P>
<P>
"People are going to walk out of theaters across America and throw trash cans 
through pizzeria windows, there's no doubt about it," said one American 
distributor who expressed concern about opening the film in certain markets. 
"It's a great movie, but it's coming out at a very questionable time." 
</P>
<P>
Universal Pictures disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"The film will only get heat if (the media) make it so," said Tom Pollock, the 
head of Universal Pictures, and the man who gave the green light to "The Last 
Temptation of Christ" and Lee's movie. "I don't think movies cause incidents. 
Incidents cause incidents." 
</P>
<P>
Pollock said Cannes' invitation to screen "Do the Right Thing" in competition 
actually pushed the opening date forward. It was originally set to open later 
in the summer, he said. It will now open in more than 300 theaters for the long 
July Fourth weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Pollock said the studio encountered no exhibition resistance to the timing of 
the film's release. 
</P>
<P>
Lee said "Do the Right Thing" was always meant to be a summer movie. "It's set 
in the summer, we made it in the summer, and people go to movies in summer," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
What is most likely to put "Do the Right Thing" on the editorial pages at home 
is the positioning and language of two quotes -- one from Martin Luther King 
Jr., the other from Malcolm X -- that end the movie. King's quote addresses the 
futility of violence; Malcolm X gets the last word, saying that violence in 
self-defense is "intelligence." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm leaning now more toward the words of Malcolm X than King," Lee said. 
"Nonviolence had its time. . . . Now, when you're getting hit upside the head 
with a brick, I don't think young black America is just going to turn a cheek 
and say, 'Thank you, Jesus.' " 
</P>
<P>
There's another agenda to the timing of "Do the Right Thing," as far as Lee is 
concerned. New York Mayor Ed Koch, whom Lee blames for much of the racial 
tension in the city, is up for reelection this fall, and Lee said he wouldn't 
mind if the film helps him get defeated. 
</P>
<P>
Pollock said Universal sought Lee out and gave him creative control over "Do 
the Right Thing" because the studio is confident that it can make money with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not some crusading studio out looking for social issues," Pollock said. 
"Spike is interested in the subject matter, and so are we. . . . But we can't 
afford to make movies if we can't make money on them." 
</P>
<P>
Pollock said Lee's first two films -- "She's Gotta Have It," made independently 
for $175,000, and "School Daze," a $6-million Columbia Picture -- both made 
money. 
</P>
<P>
The only parallel Pollock was willing to acknowledge between "Do the Right 
Thing" and "The Last Temptation of Christ" is that they were both made by 
"talented, opinionated, passionate film makers with their own unique visions 
about the movies that they make. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's one of the obligations of our industry to support the most 
talented film makers." 
</P>
<P>
The articulate, outspoken Lee seems primed to use his forum from "Do the Right 
Thing" to give a black perspective of racial issues that, in film at least, are 
usually filtered through white points of view. At the press conference, he 
brought up both Steven Spielberg's "The Color Purple" and Alan Parker's 
"Mississippi Burning" as examples of black-themed stories distorted by white 
directors attempting to appeal to white audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Justifying the unresolved ending of "Do the Right Thing," Lee said, "It would 
have been a lie to have a Steven Spielberg ending where we're all holding hands 
singing, 'We Are the World.' I don't think I should be criticized for making a 
film from the point of view of a black director." 
</P>
<P>
Lee also lashed out at the white press for exacerbating racial tension with 
subconscious racism. Asked at the press conference about the absence of drugs 
in the movie, he shot back, "Drugs are everywhere. How many of you journalists 
went to 'Rain Man' and 'Working Girl' and said, 'Where are the drugs?' This 
movie is not about drugs. . . . The question shows what you think about 
blacks." 
</P>
<P>
"Do the Right Thing" is sure to draw comparisons to Dennis Hopper's "Colors," 
which dealt with gang warfare in Los Angeles and prompted some incidents. Lee 
said the comparison was unfair. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Colors' was much more inflammatory. It really exploited the whole subject 
matter," Lee told The Times. "This film does not exploit the issue. It just 
shows it the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
Lee also cited the recent incident where a gang of youths beat and raped a 
white woman jogging in Central Park. The event was a continuing Page 1 story in 
the New York press, Lee said, while the rape and death of a black woman a few 
days later was relegated "to Page 28." "No rape is OK, but you always see this 
mentality among editors that a black life is not important," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lee is very good at describing the events that are polarizing urban 
neighborhoods and threatening to break into new waves of racial violence. The 
question is whether in showing so many people in "Do the Right Thing" doing the 
wrong things is he going to provoke the kind of productive discussions he says 
he wants, or merely drive the summer's urban temperatures up even higher? 
</P>
<P>
"I'll go on the record right now saying that whatever happens I won't shrink 
from the responsibility," Lee said. "You can't predict the effect of any film."

SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: MEDIA / KEVIN BRASS;

<P>
RADIO TALK SHOW HOSTS GO A FEW ROUNDS ON ETHICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A workout room at the M. Larry Lawrence Jewish Community Center was the 
unlikely site as four key players in local talk radio debated the ethics of 
their profession last week and took a few shots at each other in the process. 
And it seemed the participants were eager to go a few rounds. 
</P>
<P>
XTRA-AM (690) morning talk show host Mark Williams was on hand to continue his 
admitted efforts to gain publicity by attacking his major rivals at KSDO-AM 
(1130). Instead, Williams' form of crusading talk radio -- he is part of a 
nationwide coalition of talk show hosts advocating causes -- became the major 
topic of discussion. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that I can be so arrogant to say we are leaders of people," 
KSDO's executive producer, Gayle Falkenthal, told the crowd of about 35 people. 
"We're a mirror for people." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the so-called Tea Bag Rebellion, in which talk show hosts throughout 
the country encouraged listeners to send tea bags to their representatives in 
Congress to protest a proposed congressional pay raise, Williams believes a 
talk radio host should be a catalyst to action. His hero is KFI's Tom Leykis, 
who recently garnered publicity for advocating the destruction of Cat Stevens 
records after the Salman Rushdie incident. 
</P>
<P>
"I say give people the extra piece of information: what they can do about" an 
issue, Williams said at the Thursday give-and-take. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the personal squabbling -- both Williams and the KSDO contingent were 
privately looking forward to the opportunity to aim a few barbs at the 
competition -- the forum accented the schism developing within the talk show 
industry. Every radio market has at least one talk show host trying to inflame 
listeners, but most stop short of using the air waves as vehicles for change. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said he simply reflects the views of his listeners, but he is more 
than willing to make suggestions. For example, last week he advocated sending 
someone to Panama to assassinate Gen. Manuel Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
The Tea Bag movement "borders on a 'get the posse together,' vigilante 
movement," said KSDO afternoon host Stacy Taylor, whose on-air politics often 
come across as an on-air Attila the Hun. "A talk show host is not elected to 
lead the masses." 
</P>
<P>
Poor Clark Anthony of KFMB-AM (760) was the fourth panelist. His homey show has 
little to do with the intense shows hosted by Taylor and Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"Clark relieves stress, I create it," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
There was one area where Williams and the KSDO representatives could agree upon 
-- the growing popularity and impact of talk shows in general. 
</P>
<P>
"It's reflecting that people feel more and more disenfranchised from the forces 
controlling their lives," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Sports guy Jim Laslavic, who has played behind Ted Leitner at KFMB-TV (Channel 
8) for the past six years, is moving to KNSD-TV (Channel 39) to become sports 
director. He starts July 5, replacing Bobby Estill, who never quite caught on 
in San Diego. Estill will stay on the air through June. General Manager Neil 
Derrough said: "Jim brings to us what we always talk about being. He brings a 
straight no-nonsense sports style with instant credibility to the station." 
</P>
<P>
In the depositions for ex-reporter Bob Donley's wrongful termination suit 
against KGTV (Channel 10), lawyers for Channel 10 raised the issue of a 1987 
incident when an advertiser, a car dealer, called to complain about Donley. The 
station basically told Donley to stop harassing the car dealer. The car dealer 
was Tony McCune, and Donley was investigating the alleged prostitution 
operation making headlines then. Though no charges have been filed, McCune has 
since been linked to the case by court documents. 
</P>
<P>
"McCune called, and I called him back," News Director Paul Sands said. "He was 
appalled at the way he had been treated on the phone, that he had been 
threatened (by Donley). He didn't say, 'Don't do the story' or anything about 
getting Bob. He was just (angry). We talked to Bob and said we don't operate 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
Sands said there was not enough information available for a story at the time, 
long before McCune allegedly gave money to a suspected madam. 
</P>
<P>
The two extremes of media coverage of the McCune story: In one of his 
"Perspective" pieces, Channel 10's Michael Tuck chastised the media for 
overzealous coverage of McCune. "Reporters sold the public a lemon on this 
one," Tuck proclaimed. San Diego Union cartoonist Steve Kelley drew a cartoon 
depicting McCune soliciting prostitutes. "Would you buy a used car from this 
man?" one of the prostitutes says. 
</P>
<P>
XTRA-AM (690) Sports Guy Lee Hamilton is talking to Channel 39 about doing a 
sports phone-in show after weekend baseball games during the summer. Nothing 
has been set, Hamilton says. 
</P>
<P>
The renewal of Channel 8's operating license has been held up by complaints 
filed by the NAACP and the National Black Media Coalition charging that the 
station has discriminated against blacks and other minorities in its hiring 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 10 is marketing a video of Jack White's "San Diego Remembers: The War 
Years" series. Available at Blockbuster Video, the price tag is $19.95. It is 
believed to be the first time a San Diego station has marketed a video of a 
news series. 
</P>
<P>
The three stations vying for the right to air Padres games will meet with team 
officials again Wednesday. The decision is expected within the next couple of 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Issues &amp; Politics: the Magazine for Concerned San Diegans," is a 
good-looking, slick new 32-page magazine focusing on local politics. "I 
envision it as a cross between the California Journal and Campaign and 
Elections, nitty-gritty campaign stories," said publisher-editor Mike Ribant, a 
Republican and former stockbroker. Among other features, the first issue 
includes an interview with Lucy Killea, an analysis of local companies 
susceptible to takeovers and a listing of bills introduced by local assembly 
members. The magazine, with a first press run of 5,000 copies, will focus on 
subscription sales, Ribant said. 
</P>
<P>
A press release touting the 40th anniversary of KFMB-TV is full of blooper 
stories from some of the many employees who have worked at the station for more 
than 20 years, such as the time a personality doing a commercial for ginger ale 
spit out the drink on the air. Bob Lopez, now director of "Sun Up," recalls 
having to drive a car into the studio during a live broadcast. The studio 
immediately started filling with exhaust fumes, causing everybody in the 
studio, including announcer Ray Wilson, to choke. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 39's General Manager Neil Derrough on recently chosen News Director 
Donald Shafer, currently in Tucson. "He's a news junkie. He comes from a very 
hard-news background." 
</P>
<P>
Billboard Magazine has added KKLQ (Q106) to its programming listing of the "top 
24" stations in the country.

3 HURT AS SNIPERS FIRE ON CROWD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. GARCIA, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Sunday morning sniper attack on a crowd in Watts wounded three people and 
sent sheriff's deputies, suspected gang members and bystanders scurrying for 
cover, capping another weekend of violence in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Eight people were killed in the county since late Friday in gang-related 
violence. Nearly a dozen others were seriously injured, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Two deputies responding to a report of gunfire in Watts about 12:30 a.m. Sunday 
had begun to question a group of suspected gang members when snipers opened 
fire. Sheriff's Deparment officials said bullets barely missed the deputies, 
instead striking two alleged gang members and a woman bystander in the legs. 
</P>
<P>
"The deputies saw the muzzle flashes and saw the people shooting at them but 
couldn't see them well enough to return fire," said Lt. Charles Schultz of the 
Sheriff's Department Lennox station. 
</P>
<P>
The injured woman and one of the men were taken to Martin Luther King Jr./Drew 
Medical Center. The second man was treated at the scene. About 40 deputies and 
a helicopter combed the area, but a search near Century Boulevard and Vermont 
Avenue failed to uncover any suspects, Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies said they knew of no motive for the attack, which they described as a 
rare and random assault. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just one of those incidents that happen once in a great while," said Lt. 
Ray Gonzales. "We were trying to determine a motive for it, but it could be 
anything from a retaliation for past arrests or just a case where someone 
doesn't like representatives of authority. We doubt that it was premeditated, 
but it could have been." 
</P>
<P>
Also Sunday, an unidentified 15-year-old gang member was fatally shot in the 
head by a gunman in a passing car, police said. The juvenile was standing with 
several other people in front of a house on East 54th Street when the gunman 
fired two bullets. The boy, whose name was not released, was taken to King 
medical center and died shortly after. 
</P>
<P>
Two teen-age boys were also killed in gang drive-by shootings in Inglewood 
Sunday evening, police said. Few details were available late Sunday on the 
shootings -- one in the 3100 block of 99th Street and the other near 111th 
Street and Prairie Avenue. Neither victim was identified, and investigators had 
not determined whether the shootings were related. 
</P>
<P>
In other fatal incidents: 
</P>
<P>
* Deputies searched in Azusa Sunday for suspects in a stabbing. One man was 
killed and another critically wounded after a fight broke out during a party at 
a house on Suzanne Marie Court. Neither of the victims was identified. 
</P>
<P>
* On Friday, Lorenzo Albarran, 24, was killed and Phillip Lopez, 30, was 
seriously injured when a street fight broke out involving 14 men. Leovardo 
Garcia, 31, was booked by deputies on suspicion of murder. 
</P>
<P>
* Los Angeles police detectives searched for two alleged gang members suspected 
in the fatal shooting of an unidentified man during a Saturday night robbery. 
</P>
<P>
* Also on Saturday, Adan Guerrero, 18, was shot to death in Bell Gardens. 
Deputies arrested Jose Huerta, 23, and two juveniles on suspicion of murder. 
</P>
<P>
* Police said an unidentified man was shot to death during a gang-related 
attack late Friday in South-Central Los Angeles.

WHEELS OF JUSTICE;

LONG DAYS, LITTLE HEADWAY ARE INMATES' FARE ON JAIL BUS LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since his arrest on armed robbery charges 17 months ago, Doyle Ray Jones has 
been awakened before dawn every few days and escorted to a series of windowless 
holding cells so crowded and poorly ventilated that a federal judge has likened 
them to "pigpens." 
</P>
<P>
From there, things get worse. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, an inmate in the Men's Central Jail who has not yet been convicted of 
anything, is chained to three fellow prisoners, shuffled out to a gloomy 
courtyard and dispatched on a tightly secured Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department bus to court. After the five-minute ride, he is locked in another 
cramped holding cell, where he waits for hours to be called before a judge. 
</P>
<P>
Unless his case is heard quickly enough for him to return on the early 
afternoon bus, it may be 8 or 9 p.m. before Jones, 45, is back in his own cell. 
</P>
<P>
What is the result of such 15-hour days? 
</P>
<P>
Usually, next to nothing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
20-Minute Appearances 
</P>
<P>
Until Jones' trial finally began this month, most of his court appearances 
lasted no more than 10 or 20 minutes -- just long enough for the judge to deny 
bail or continue his case. 
</P>
<P>
Jones' story is hardly unusual. The inmate, who is a plaintiff in a jail 
overcrowding lawsuit, is one of more than 2,000 county prisoners bused each 
morning for courtroom appearances, only a handful of which are trials. 
</P>
<P>
The jail busing system, known as the daily "courtline," is the largest of its 
kind in the nation. The sheriff's fleet of 61 metal-barred, black-and-white 
buses, which fan out from the central jail to 40 courthouses from Pomona to 
Malibu, San Pedro to Lancaster, carry more passengers a day from downtown Los 
Angeles than Greyhound. 
</P>
<P>
Most experts agree that given the dizzying logistics, the $10-million-a-year, 
24-hour-a-day forced busing program functions remarkably smoothly. Yet most 
also acknowledge that rarely in the annals of county government can one find a 
program that accomplishes so little while functioning so well. 
</P>
<P>
"They go out there and back they come . . . and only about 10% of them actually 
(are on) trial," said a frustrated U.S. District Judge William P. Gray while 
presiding over an April hearing on jail overcrowding. "There has got to be some 
better way of working out a system in which the mountain comes to Mohammed. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe the technology has not gone far enough to permit a judge in 
Lancaster or Santa Monica or Pomona to be able to sit in his chamber to 
confront the prisoner in County Jail over television and decide these 
(pretrial) matters without having to travel." 
</P>
<P>
Gray, during the last 12 years, has made several major rulings on County Jail 
overcrowding lawsuits filed by the American Civil Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of those orders, Sheriff Sherman Block last year began releasing 
thousands of inmates accused or convicted of misdemeanors to keep the jail 
population from exceeding 22,388. The county's 10 jail facilities have a rated 
capacity of 13,464. 
</P>
<P>
Gray, who has compared conditions in the 14-foot courtline holding cells to 
"the Chicago stockyards" and his "uncle's pig ranch in Lancaster," has also 
repeatedly threatened to force the sheriff to give a holding cell seat to each 
inmate. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the judge announced that he would finally enforce the 
requirement, but subsequently voided his action at the request of the ACLU, 
which had used the threat to pry concessions to help reduce the time it takes 
to settle criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
If ever implemented, the directive would almost certainly cause massive 
disruptions in court schedules since there are only 753 holding cell seats at 
Men's Central -- and, at this point, 2,300 prisoners are bused each morning. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, government agencies have studied various alternatives, 
closed-circuit TV among them, to help reduce the daily bus load, but have been 
stymied by financial and legal obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the number of prisoners bused continues at a dizzying pace. 
Last Nov. 28, a one-day, one-way record of 3,442 was set. For the year, 
sheriff's vehicles carried prisoners on 1.79 million trips. Officials estimate 
that fewer than 10% of the prisoners bused to court are actually on trial. 
</P>
<P>
"The RTD of the criminal courts," as Gray recently termed it, begins its daily 
cycle shortly after midnight, when the county's computer center in Downey 
prints out a list of inmates due in court. By 2 a.m., a deputy at Men's Central 
has begun dividing the list into busloads for each courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
The procedure is complicated by the fact that many prisoners require special 
handling. For example, members of rival street gangs must be kept apart. So 
must informants, women and those deemed especially violent. In addition to 
general seating for about 40, each bus contains three locked compartments, 
commonly referred to as "cages," to house the special prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
The staging ground for the daily courtline is a courtyard behind the Inmate 
Reception Center at Men's Central. Before dawn each morning, several hundred 
prisoners housed in outlying facilities are bused downtown to be transported to 
courthouses throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
Wake-up time for some of these prisoners can be as early as 4 a.m., even though 
they will not reach the courtroom, in some instances, until nine or 10 hours 
later. At Men's Central, court-bound prisoners are awakened between 5 and 6 
a.m., before being led downstairs. 
</P>
<P>
With far too few seats in the cinder-block cells, many prisoners are forced to 
stand; others lie on the floor in fetal position trying to catch an extra hour 
of sleep. Due to the lack of windows, a funky odor permeates the area. 
</P>
<P>
"Dehumanizing? Certainly," Jones said in a jailhouse interview. "People are 
smoking, there are wall-to-wall people. . . . In the holding cells it's like 
putting a hundred people into a walk-in closet." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hooked' Together 
</P>
<P>
Before the prisoners are led out to the buses, they are "hooked" together, four 
to a chain. Two armed deputies, one serving as the driver, ride on each bus. 
</P>
<P>
Although there have been only a handful of escapes, and sheriff's officials go 
out of their way to praise the general prison population for its cooperation, 
security, understandably, is a major concern. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody gets on the bus without being handcuffed -- nobody," said veteran 
Sheriff's Deputy Brian Glennon, who trains new drivers. 
</P>
<P>
On the buses, some of the jumpsuit-clad prisoners sit sullenly. Others yell out 
the window at nearby motorists. As freeway traffic intensifies, trips to 
outlying courts have become increasingly drawn out. 
</P>
<P>
While Sheriff's Department officials would like to see the daily courtline 
lightened, some note that the bus ride itself can be a break for inmates 
confined for long spells behind bleak jail walls. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Long Day' 
</P>
<P>
"For some of them it's a very long day, but on the other hand, they don't have 
anything else to do," said Capt. Jerry L. West, commander of the Sheriff's 
Transportation Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Inmate Wendell Meeks, who has awaited trial on murder charges since last July, 
says there are two sides to that story. 
</P>
<P>
"The little bit of sun you get . . . for the long period of sitting and waiting 
and a minute in court and coming back to this (jail) . . . it's not even worth 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meeks and Jones are among eight plaintiffs in a current ACLU lawsuit that 
accuses the county's Superior Court judges of infringing on prisoners' rights 
to a speedy trial by granting excessive continuances. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ACLU Contention 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU contends that judges and others use the courtline as "a means of 
forcing in-custody detainees into either pleading guilty or enduring excessive 
continuances and jail confinement prior to trial." 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU also maintains that some prisoners, after taking the long bus ride, 
are not even brought inside the courtroom when minor actions are taken in their 
cases. ACLU attorney John Hagar says the daily courtline would decrease 
significantly if judges disposed of criminal cases more expeditiously. 
</P>
<P>
But Presiding Judge Richard P. Byrne, who contends that judges are doing 
everything within their power to speed up court proceedings, said the courtline 
"is a very, very complex system involving many, many people far-flung 
geographically. It's not capable of an easy panacea." 
</P>
<P>
Some experts contend that much of the burden for the courtline has to be placed 
on defendants and their lawyers, since many continuances are sought by defense 
attorneys who either have too many cases to try or believe that their clients' 
chances will be enhanced as the memories of witnesses fade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
35 Appearances 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Jones, who had 35 court appearances before finally going on 
trial on charges stemming from the armed robberies of five restaurants and a 
supermarket, Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Grosbard points out that almost all the 
continuances were sought by the defense. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, who says he wanted his trial to begin a year ago, maintains that many of 
the delays are the result of stalling by the district attorney's office in 
turning over necessary evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are being held in jail, you don't want continuances," the Pasadena 
resident said. "You want to get out." 
</P>
<P>
Gray, at an April hearing, indefinitely stayed the ACLU's lawsuit, advising 
Hagar to first seek a ruling in state court. 
</P>
<P>
But the federal judge warned that he may eventually be forced to alter the 
busing system. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe somehow, with the help of the Superior Court and county counsel and ACLU 
and my participation to the extent as appropriate, another attempt can be made 
to stop this intolerable process that these fellows have to be taken to all 
these outlying areas for no purpose other than to consider a continuance or 
motions of some kind," Gray said. "The time may come when this court will have 
to consider the constitutional issues that are involved."

$300 BLOCK PARTY; 
</P>
<P>
ANNUAL RODEO DRIVE EVENT RAISES MONEY FOR CANCER RESEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A block party was held Sunday on a street in Beverly Hills called Rodeo Drive, 
and as might be expected, this one was different from the standard, 
bring-your-own-wieners, meet-the-neighbors, short-pants-only block parties 
known to most of America. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, it cost $300 to attend. 
</P>
<P>
"It's silly when they're paying $300 a head just to get in," one of the 
bartenders said, "but we made a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
The bartender in this instance was Shelley Winters, and the money was to 
finance cancer research through an unusual charity formed by the friends of a 
woman who fell victim to the disease in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Than 2,500 Guests 
</P>
<P>
The event, staged on Rodeo Drive for the 15th year in a row, attracted more 
than 2,500 paying guests. They ate exotic foods, listened to Japanese drummers, 
watched flamenco dancers and, at an auction, bid on furs, jewelry and a Jaguar 
convertible. Many stayed into the evening for a show headlined by Don Rickles. 
</P>
<P>
"I come every year and this year I'm going to do a little entertaining," said 
the comedian, who had done another benefit show the night before. "I'm getting 
a little tired of charity," he added, apparently in jest. "I wish they'd chip 
in and pay me." 
</P>
<P>
Actors impersonating W. C. Fields, Laurel and Hardy and Marilyn Monroe roamed 
tables set up down the middle of the famous thoroughfare of pricey shops, and a 
belly dancer wriggled atop a table piled high with Middle Eastern delicacies. 
</P>
<P>
The event was sponsored by the Concern Foundation for Cancer Research, an 
organization that pays no one except its administrator. It was founded by 14 
Westside couples who were friends of a woman who died of cancer in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
"Concern has raised in excess of $11 million since then," said Marty Golden, 
president of the group. 
</P>
<P>
He said the money largely is spent on grants of as much as $100,000 to help 
young scientists research ways to increase the body's immunity to cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"Our donors are largely Westsiders, affluent people who could afford to just 
write checks but they're not only going to give money but also come out and do 
the work themselves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Starting at 5:30 a.m., the volunteers erected an entrance gate designed to look 
like a train station for the luxurious Orient Express. Aided by Naval ROTC 
students from UCLA, they set up hundreds of tables and five food pavilions. 
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to it every year," said Martin Appel, a Beverly Hills attorney 
who brought a tableful of children and grandchildren to the event. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'More Informal and Sociable' 
</P>
<P>
"For most fund-raisers, you go to a hotel, put on a tuxedo and black tie and 
sit at a crowded table," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is more informal and sociable. It wouldn't work as well if it wasn't in 
Beverly Hills. Being on Rodeo Drive adds a sort of cachet. It helps bring out 
the celebrities." 
</P>
<P>
Other movie and TV actors who tended bar included Jack Carter, Dianne Ladd and 
Lee Meriwether, who spilled a drink and said, "Thank God I don't have to do 
this for a living." 
</P>
<P>
Organizers originally thought that the event would also bring out freeloaders, 
since a listing in The Times indicated that it would be open to the public 
without charge. 
</P>
<P>
They stationed extra security, but no problems were reported with 
gate-crashers.

WOMAN FREED AFTER 2 HOURS IN MUDDY HOLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN H. LEE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Firefighters dramatically rescued a woman who had been stuck in a narrow 
crevice 20 feet below ground for two hours Sunday night at a construction site 
west of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of onlookers applauded as a woman identified by authorities as Cooke 
Manzanarel, 22, was pulled to the surface about 9:30 p.m., covered with mud and 
trembling, but otherwise uninjured, at a car wash in the 4000 block of Beverly 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trapped by Pipe 
</P>
<P>
Manzanarel was wedged between a 4-foot-diameter pipe that extended 20 feet 
below the surface and the surrounding earth, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The pipe was secured only at ground level, and officials said they were 
initially concerned that it might move and crush her. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighter George Perez descended into the narrow opening and found the woman 
in waist-deep water. He placed her in a harness, and rescuers carefully pulled 
her to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a hero," Perez said afterward. "I've got to finish my shift." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looking for Ball 
</P>
<P>
The woman told authorities that she climbed into the hole looking for a ball 
and became stuck. 
</P>
<P>
She was taken to Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital where she was listed in stable 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
The rescue unfolded as a television movie depicting the 1987 rescue of a 
toddler named Jessica McClure from an abandoned well in Texas was being 
broadcast.

MOUNTAIN BIKERS BATTLE BACK; 
</P>
<P>
BARRED FROM MANY TRAILS AS THREAT TO HIKERS, CYCLISTS FORM SELF-POLICING 
PATROLS IN ATTEMPT TO REGAIN ACCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The biker was cranking hard along a shady fire road toward a pair of older 
riders in Point Mugu State Park's Sycamore Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
A slight swerve by one of the slow riders forced the young man to sharply 
maneuver his 18-speed mountain bike off the road and back on. He pedaled away 
without a word. 
</P>
<P>
But Mark Langton, coordinator of a group of mountain bikers who patrol Santa 
Monica Mountains park areas, saw the incident and caught up with the speeding 
biker. 
</P>
<P>
"You're in Sycamore Canyon, and you have to mellow out," Langton told the 
bicyclist. "You can't ride that way here." 
</P>
<P>
Operating on fire roads and trails in a number of popular biking areas since 
late December, the 25 volunteer members of the Van Nuys-based Mountain Bike 
Unit hope that their presence will serve to moderate the sometimes dangerous 
behavior of thrill-seeking fellow riders. 
</P>
<P>
The patrol's members, who underwent extensive National Park Service training, 
want to be ambassadors for their sport. They want to calm the fears of hikers 
and equestrians who see mountain bikers as a safety threat. 
</P>
<P>
They hope to demonstrate that mountain bikers also cherish the natural beauty 
of the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Formerly unregulated, many trails have been closed to bikers in recent years 
amid concerns by hikers about safety, trail damage and destruction of 
wilderness calm. 
</P>
<P>
By improving the image of mountain bikers, members of the patrol units and the 
Concerned Off-Road Bicyclists Assn. -- the patrols' parent organization -- hope 
to regain access to back-country trails. Although substantial barriers remain 
to achieving that goal, CORBA has won some converts during its 18 months of 
existence. 
</P>
<P>
"We have, if nothing else, put a face on the mountain bike riding community," 
said Langton, an editor at a Woodland Hills-based off-road biking magazine and 
a member of CORBA. 
</P>
<P>
"The attitude and the climate toward mountain bikers has improved. We're not 
faceless marauders. We're a group of individuals . . . concerned about the 
environment as well as with enjoying the aesthetics of the area." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, partly as a result of CORBA's efforts, the Santa Monica Mountains 
Trails Council, a longtime opponent of mountain bikers, has endorsed opening 
three trails to the bicyclists. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy plans to supply equipment 
for CORBA to expand its patrols into conservancy territory, and CORBA intends 
to recruit additional volunteers. The expansion would be a prelude to giving 
bikers access to most of the roads and trails on conservancy property, a 
conservancy official said. 
</P>
<P>
"Their presence in our parks is good for their image, and our image," said 
Carolyn Barr, a project analyst for the conservancy, a state agency that 
acquires and manages parkland in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The patrol units can "explain to people why they need to be polite," Barr said. 
If mountain bikers behave irresponsibly, other groups will question their 
presence in the back country, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the state Department of Parks and Recreation and the National Park 
Service -- which together control 56,000 acres in the mountains -- welcome the 
bike patrols, each has strict limits on where bikes can go. Essentially, the 
agencies allow bikes only on fire roads. 
</P>
<P>
A state parks department policy, which became effective in January, allows 
district park superintendents to grant exceptions to the restrictions. A public 
meeting is scheduled for 7:30 tonight at the Malibu Civic Center on whether 
more parkland trails should be opened. Strident opposition to CORBA's position, 
as well as substantial support, are expected. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, said several longtime Santa Monica Mountains hikers, is not the 
behavior of mountain bikers, but the sheer numbers of them. Practically unknown 
five years ago, riders of the durable, fat-tired, multispeed bicycles have 
become the largest and the fastest-growing recreation group in the mountains, 
parks officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A ranger in Point Mugu State Park, one of the most popular biking areas, 
recently counted 700 bikers in Sycamore Canyon during a single day. Also 
popular are Malibu Creek State Park, Topanga Canyon State Park and trails in 
the Cheeseboro Canyon area. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the newest, fastest-growing user group out there and that isn't making 
the other two groups very happy," said Peter Heumann, a Woodland Hills bike 
rider who helped form CORBA. The other 
</P>
<P>
major groups are equestrians and hikers. "They don't see us as legitimate 
back-country users. They see us invading their privacy." 
</P>
<P>
The CORBA patrols, modeled after the Mounted Assist Units organized by 
equestrian groups, have been trained by the National Park Service to give first 
aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation and to keep their unofficial standing in 
mind when dealing with the public. The two-person bike patrols are equipped 
with emergency radios, first-aid kits, repair kits and maps. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Official Power 
</P>
<P>
Patrol members stressed that they have no power to enforce laws; they can only 
remind park users of rules and provide directions, maps, advice or emergency 
water. On a recent patrol that Langton said was typical, he helped repair a 
bicyclist's gears, informed someone clutching a bouquet of wildflowers that 
picking flowers is against the law, advised another visitor that dogs are not 
allowed in the park and reprimanded a fellow biker for riding too fast. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that you should never go fast, but you should always be in control of 
yourself," Langton said. "There are plenty of places you can go flat out, with 
no regard for people going slow." 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, Sycamore Canyon, which stretches in a sometimes steep slope from 
Newbury Park to the Pacific Coast Highway, is not one of them. That message 
seems to be getting out. 
</P>
<P>
"Most mountain bikers we encounter anymore are courteous and they either slow 
down or stop for horsemen," said Ralph Bauer of Chatsworth, an equestrian who 
recently encountered one of the CORBA patrols in Sycamore Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"There are only so many trails, and we know we have to share them," added his 
wife, Elodie Bauer. "If we don't all work together, we're going to lose these 
trails." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm impressed by their zeal and their sincerity," Dan Preece, Santa Monica 
Mountains state park district superintendent, said of CORBA members. 
</P>
<P>
But issues remain, he said. "We are determined to keep an open mind, but 
basically we have been concerned by the things we've seen on the trails with 
bikes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complaints Continue 
</P>
<P>
Hikers and bikers are often injured in collisions, he said, although he could 
supply no statistics. And park rangers continue to hear complaints about 
speeding bikers. "Our concern is that bicycles do move down steep inclines at a 
high rate of speed in silence, so there is very little warning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Preece said he also worries about the difficulty of enforcing any policy change 
that opens some state park trails while keeping others closed. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Webster, who builds trails in the Santa Monicas for the Sierra Club and the 
conservancy, once praised CORBA's efforts. But he had a change of heart when, 
on a recent hike, a large number of bikers peddled past and he felt besieged. 
</P>
<P>
"I go into the parks, personally, for peace and solitude," he said. "I felt 
they were seriously infringing on my ability to enjoy the parks in that way." 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, he said, he will urge that all state parks, including their fire 
roads, be off limits to bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
But Linda Palmer, president of the Santa Monica Trails Council, plans to 
support the reopening of three trails for use by bikers: the Bent Arrow Trail 
in Topanga State Park; the Yearling Trail at the Reagan Ranch in Malibu Creek 
State Park and the La Jolla Loop Trail near the western end of the Santa 
Monicas. Palmer said the trails council's stand is a departure from past 
positions. She said the change "is probably a good deal due to CORBA's 
educational efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"The mountain bicycles are probably with us to stay, and it is such a large 
user group that they do need places to ride," she said. "It is a legitimate 
recreational pursuit, and there must be a way of working it out."

BERNARDI-HALL RACE FOR COUNCIL STARTS TO SIMMER AS RUNOFF NEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
What has thus far been a low-key Los Angeles City Council race to represent the 
east San Fernando Valley promises to take an aggressive turn in the final two 
weeks of campaigning as veteran Councilman Ernani Bernardi tries to stave off 
challenger Lyle Hall. 
</P>
<P>
It will be a battle waged in the last days before the June 6 runoff election, 
through the mails and over the telephone, the candidates' campaign consultants 
said. Registered voters in the diverse district -- from rustic Sylmar hillsides 
to densely populated Pacoima -- can expect a barrage of telephone solicitations 
and biting campaign literature. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all going to boil down to the last four or five days," said Allan 
Hoffenblum, a veteran consultant hired by Bernardi to devise mailers and advise 
him on campaign strategy. "That's when people say, 'Oh, hey, we have an 
election going on.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Series of Endorsements 
</P>
<P>
The runoff race has so far been marked by a series of endorsement 
announcements, several press conferences focusing on crime issues and 
relatively quiet public forums. 
</P>
<P>
But the energy has begun to build. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, 7th-District residents began to receive some of more than a dozen 
slick flyers for Hall produced by campaign consultant Harvey Englander. During 
the next two weeks they can expect more mail that will point to instances in 
which Bernardi has "failed the community." Englander declined to identify those 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi has not yet started his mail campaign, but Hoffenblum hinted that the 
bulk of the flyers will be sent in the last week before the election and that 
they will portray Hall as a candidate "with no real local involvement in the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi, 77, the dean of the City Council with 28 years of service, has found 
himself campaigning in a largely new district that was carved out during City 
Council reapportionment in 1986. The redistricting replaced a swath of his 
longtime Van Nuys support with the communities of Sylmar, Lake View Terrace and 
predominantly Latino and black areas of Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Starting Over 
</P>
<P>
"It's close to starting all over again. It's a new campaign in a diverse 
community," Bernardi said. "I've been working here 2 1/2 years, but we've still 
had to pretty much introduce myself to a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
Hall, 49, a Los Angeles city Fire Department captain and former president of 
the firefighters' union, has strong union backing, and his message to voters 
has been a call for change and new ideas. 
</P>
<P>
"After 28 years of decline and neglect . . . it's time for a fresh, aggressive 
and realistic point of view," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates do not differ on most issues: Both want more police officers in 
the northeast Valley, they support the closure of Lopez Canyon Landfill and 
they seek controls on the construction of more apartments and condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
One disagreement is over the Nancy Reagan Center for drug rehabilitation. 
Bernardi vehemently opposes its location in a residential area of Lake View 
Terrace. Hall supports it because he believes that it would be a valuable 
resource in an area plagued by drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Candidate Polls 
</P>
<P>
Both campaigns have conducted polls and both show Bernardi ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Hall's poll, completed two weeks ago by Valley pollster Arnold Steinberg, shows 
Bernardi only one point ahead, in a 40% to 39% vote split, with 21% undecided, 
Englander said. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi's poll, conducted May 6 by a San Francisco firm called Charlton 
Research, said Bernardi was 18 points ahead, in a 49% to 31% split, with 20% 
undecided, Hoffenblum said. 
</P>
<P>
Each side challenged the other's results. 
</P>
<P>
While consultants prepare mailers and supervise polls, the candidates gather 
endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi is using endorsements to bolster his image as a grass-roots man of the 
people. He has assembled a list of about 50 community activists, educators and 
social service workers -- names that are largely unknown outside small 
community circles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deliberate Effort 
</P>
<P>
This is a deliberate attempt to counter Hall's endorsements from better known 
politicians such as Bobbi Fiedler, a former congresswoman, and state Sen. Art 
Torres (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
"For every Bobbi Fiedler they have, I told Ernie to go out and get five local 
people," Hoffenblum said. "For every Art Torres they have, I said go get five 
community activists." 
</P>
<P>
Englander said endorsements do not mean much to the average voter, but big 
names can lend credibility to a lesser-known candidate such as Hall. 
Credibility can help raise money and move voters to read mailers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fiedler will be pictured on a mailer to conservative voters in the district, 
Englander said. Torres' endorsement will be highlighted in a mailer to Latinos 
and Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Endorsements are generally more important to the challenger than to the 
incumbent, said Kam Kuwata, a Los Angeles-based political consultant not 
involved in the 7th-District race. But he said this is a race that may break 
that rule because Bernardi is campaigning in a relatively new district. 
</P>
<P>
In the areas Bernardi's district acquired in 1986, "if he's able to gain key 
endorsements, then it could have nearly as much impact for him as for a 
challenger," said Kuwata, because many of the voters in the new district are 
not familiar with him. 
</P>
<P>
Notable among endorsements for Bernardi are those from an emerging Latino 
coalition. Sylmar attorney Raymond Magana, who helped organize the group, 
described Bernardi in a letter to 150 Latinos as "a friend to our community" 
because of his recent record on Latino issues, such as supporting City Council 
actions to establish day-labor hiring halls. 
</P>
<P>
But another plus for Bernardi among Latinos is that the councilman has promised 
to retire at the end of his four-year term. That would open a path for a Latino 
candidate to run in the next election without having to face an incumbent. And 
the formation of the pro-Bernardi coalition has given the group experience at 
building a political organization, which leaders hope will be strong enough to 
find and promote such a candidate in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an election where we can practically and tangibly make a difference. 
It's laying the foundation for down the line," Magana said. "It's important 
that there is an open seat so we don't face an entrenched incumbent."

BATTLE OVER SITE OF OLD HIGH SCHOOL MIRRORS TENSIONS IN MOORPARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Teresa Godinez is so fed up with Moorpark officials that she has asked a lawyer 
about suing the school district and the city to force a decision on the fate of 
a 70-year-old high school that closed nearly a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
But the city and school district may beat Godinez to the punch and file suits 
against each other if they cannot reach a compromise soon on what to do with 
the school's 26-acre campus, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In a dispute that reflects tension between old and new residents of this 
rapidly growing city of 24,900, the two entities have been unable to agree for 
the past year on how the property on Casey Road should be zoned or on the price 
of a portion that Godinez and other residents want for a public park. 
</P>
<P>
The district says the 8 acres the city wants for the downtown park are worth 
$980,000 -- about three times more than the city's offer of $319,750. 
</P>
<P>
While no one is eager to have the issue settled in court -- Godinez said her 
group has decided to try lobbying politicians before suing -- frustration and 
bitterness are growing. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll use the court system if we have to," City Councilman Scott Montgomery 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that "when Moorpark sues Moorpark, the people who pay are the 
Moorpark taxpayers," said school board member Tom Baldwin. "The only people who 
win are the lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the Memorial Union High School campus began more than a year 
ago when the school district announced plans to sell or lease the site for 
development to pay for new schools needed in other parts of the rapidly growing 
district. 
</P>
<P>
The district, which now has about 4,500 students in kindergarten through 12th 
grade, has been growing at a rate of 10% to 15% a year, said Thomas G. Duffy, 
superintendent of the Moorpark Unified School District. Most of the growth 
comes from new housing tracts outside the downtown area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rezoning Requested 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1988, the school district asked the City Council to rezone the 
abandoned high school property for residential or commercial use. The site is 
now zoned for about three homes per acre, which is too few to generate enough 
income to pay for new schools, Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
The property is made up of a large flat parcel near railroad tracks, known as 
the lower fields; a smaller football field on a terraced hillside, and several 
structures, including a gymnasium, a 350-seat auditorium and classroom 
buildings. The district closed the old high school in June, 1988, and a new 
high school across town opened in September of that year. 
</P>
<P>
"We see the property on the Casey Road site as an asset we can use to generate 
an income stream," Duffy said. "We can't educate kids unless we have funds." 
</P>
<P>
But several citizens groups oppose large-scale development of the downtown 
site, primarily because of traffic concerns. One group, which launched an 
unsuccessful recall campaign in June, 1988, against four of the five school 
board members who supported developing the site, said the old high school 
should be preserved because of its historic significance. The City Council did 
not approve the zoning change that the district requested. 
</P>
<P>
"We need more growth in Moorpark like Hitler needed more Russians," said Bill 
La Perch, president of the downtown Neighborhood Council, which opposes 
high-density development of the site and wants the city to buy part of the 
property for a park. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Ignored and Deprived' 
</P>
<P>
Godinez, a member of a group called Citizens Advocating a Major Park, said 
longtime downtown-area residents have felt increasingly "neglected, ignored and 
deprived" by city officials as Moorpark's population has grown sixfold, from 
4,030 in 1980 to 24,900 at the end of 1988, according to a report by the state 
Department of Finance. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our turn now, and we want a downtown park on the lower fields," Godinez 
said, noting that all but one of the city's nine parks are in newly developed 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
The district is willing to sell the city the lower fields for a park but 
expects to be able to develop the rest of the property in exchange, Baldwin 
said. But the two have been unable to work out a deal after months of 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Under a provision of the state education code known as the Naylor Act, a city 
is allowed to purchase 30% of a district's surplus school sites for as little 
as 25% of market value. Based on a $4.2-million appraisal of the 26-acre site, 
the city has offered the district $319,750 for the 8 acres of the lower fields. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Considered Most Valuable 
</P>
<P>
But the district says the lower fields, which it considers the most valuable 
portion of the property, are worth $980,000. The appraisals differ because the 
district appraised the land as if it were already zoned for higher densities, 
and thus were more valuable, said Councilman Clinton D. Harper. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the district said that because only 17 acres of the hilly property 
are usable, the city can buy only about 5 acres at a reduced price under the 
Naylor Act, instead of 8 acres. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pie-in-sky planning and we don't buy it," Harper said. "The city will get 
the lower fields at the price it wants or that site will just sit there at 
current zoning." 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin, on the other hand, called the city's offer "a setup for a lawsuit."

WATCH IS TIMED TO CASH IN ON QUAYLE'S IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two former stockbrokers from Thousand Oaks hope to make money from Vice 
President Dan Quayle's image as the embodiment of confusing times. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, Richard Ongstad and his partner, Steve Hill, began selling the 
"Quayle Time" wristwatch. 
</P>
<P>
It costs $30 and features a cartoon depiction of a disoriented-looking vice 
president. Perhaps that's because the numbers on the watch are in the wrong 
places, but the hands keep time according to the conventional system. 
Consequently, even while the watch is right, it appears to be wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Ongstad said the watch represents Quayle's apparent state of confusion because 
"every time he turns around, something goes wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Ongstad said he and Hill initially sold 250 of the watches by word of mouth 
through their Krazy Time Co. They have 250 more on order from a Los Angeles 
based-watch maker. 
</P>
<P>
"So far it's done extremely well, much better than I thought," Ongstad said. 
"Everybody thinks this is going to be the next pet rock." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, he said, there are plans to market the novelty in Washington. But, 
Ongstad added, "I don't want to make fun of the guy. I think he's probably a 
hell of a guy."

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MOTORISTS CATCH DRIVER AFTER HIT-RUN ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four motorists who saw a driver attempt to flee after his car struck a 
bicyclist in Lancaster on Sunday morning forced the man off the road and held 
him until deputies arrived, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Perry C. Bingham, 35, of Lancaster was arrested on suspicion of felony 
hit-and-run and felony drunk driving, Sheriff's Deputy Barbara Critchlow said. 
</P>
<P>
Bingham was driving erratically on Sierra Highway near Avenue H at about 2:30 
a.m. and veered into a bicycle lane, hitting cyclist Carlos Quesada, 28, of 
Lancaster, Critchlow said. 
</P>
<P>
Quesada, who suffered cuts to his head, hands and feet, was in fair condition 
at Antelope Valley Hospital Medical Center, Critchlow said. 
</P>
<P>
Bingham continued driving after hitting the bicyclist, but motorists in three 
cars followed his car for about a block and forced it to stop, Critchlow said. 
The motorists asked Bingham if he knew he had struck the man, and he said yes, 
Critchlow said. Bingham did not try to flee while the motorists watched him 
until deputies arrived, she said.

RUTHERFORD FAILS TO QUALIFY IN LAST-DITCH EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

INDIANAPOLIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fastest 33-car field in racing history will start the May 28 Indianapolis 
500 without three-time winner Johnny Rutherford, whose last-minute qualifying 
attempt blew up Sunday along with the engine in the car he borrowed from A.J 
Foyt. 
</P>
<P>
Rutherford, 51, was bumped from the lineup by Rich Vogler with under 15 minutes 
remaining on the final day of time trials. But Foyt, a fellow Texan and 
longtime friend, put Rutherford into a Cosworth-powered Lola, got the car 
through technical inspection and onto the 2 1/2-mile oval one minute before the 
scheduled close of the track. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway screamed its approval when 
Rutherford rolled off pit row. 
</P>
<P>
His crew said Rutherford's warmup lap was more than 217 m.p.h., well above what 
he needed to get back into the field. 
</P>
<P>
But, fewer than 100 yards after taking the green flag for the start of a 
four-lap, 10-mile qualifying run, smoke poured from the engine and the crowd 
groaned in disbelief as Rutherford took a slow ride back to pit row. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second consecutive year that Vogler has been the final qualifier, 
bumping a former Indy winner. In 1988, he put a car into the field in the last 
moments, knocking Gordon Johncock out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to see that happen, but what happens happens in racing," Vogler said. 
"I know that Johnny Rutherford and Johncock are two people who kind of 
understand that. They've raced for a living for a long, long time. I don't 
know, maybe that means I'm gonna win this race some day." 
</P>
<P>
Rutherford, speaking in hushed tones, said: "There's just no words to describe 
the disappointment. . . . I guess we'll have to regroup and get things together 
and try again next year. It was apparently a dropped valve. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, I'm on the other end of the stick. I have been for so many years, I 
guess I can't really kick too hard. I have been on the pole many times, and won 
the race three times and had a pretty good career here, but I still like to 
race here and I'm still disappointed not making this one." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Vogler, who will drive in his fifth Indy 500, Bill Vukovich III, the 
1988 Indy rookie of the year; Davy Jones, who was bumped and bounced right 
back, and Pancho Carter made the lineup Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The field average of 216.588 m.p.h. breaks the Indianapolis record of 210.280 
m.p.h. set in 1986. Rookie Bernhard Jourdain of Mexico was the slowest 
qualifier at 213.105. 
</P>
<P>
The record-smashing field is led by defending champion Rick Mears, who won his 
record fifth pole a week ago with a four-lap average of 223.885 and a fast lap 
of 224.254. 
</P>
<P>
Rutherford failed to join the eight other active former Indy winners, four-time 
winners Al Unser and Foyt, three-time winner Mears, two-time champion Johncock 
and Mario Andretti, Tom Sneva, Bobby Rahal, and Danny Sullivan in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
All the others made the field on the first weekend of time trials except 
Sullivan, the 1985 winner, who led Saturday's qualifications at 216.027 despite 
driving with a special brace on his broken right forearm. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's six-hour qualifying session began with two positions open in the 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Vukovich, the only third-generation driver to compete at the Indianapolis Motor 
Speedway, was first out, turning four laps of more than 216 m.p.h. for a 
10-mile qualifying average of 216.698. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like we were lost," said Vukovich, whose grandfather was killed at 
Indy while leading the 1955 race after winning the previous two years and whose 
father finished second in 1973. "Our crew chief finally brought us back to 
where we should have been by doing a lot of adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought this year would have been a lot easier, but it was a lot harder." 
</P>
<P>
Rutherford, Indy winner in 1974, 1976 and 1980, was the 33rd qualifier at 
213.097. He has started 24 Indy 500s, second only to Foyt, who will drive in a 
record 32nd consecutive race next Sunday. Rutherford was a rookie here in 1963 
and has missed only two previous races, 1966 and 1983, during that period, both 
because of injury. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a lot slower than we had hoped for obviously," said Rutherford, who 
sweated out the last starting spot until Vogler jumped into already-qualified 
Kevin Cogan's backup car and bumped the popular Texan from the field with an 
average of 213.239. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Bettenhausen ran two laps at 212.4 and rookie Michael Greenfield had one 
lap at 210.7 before Rutherford made his last effort as time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Parsons, son of 1950 winner Johnnie Parsons and half-brother to Pancho 
Carter, crashed while trying to get a car belonging to rookie Steve Saleen up 
to speed. Saleen crashed in practice on Saturday and spent the night in 
Methodist Hospital after complaining of lower back pains. He was released 
Sunday, but hired Parsons to drive his backup. Parsons was not injured.

<P>
Everyone knows by now that Charlie Whittingham trains the best 3-year-old 
thoroughbred in the country. Sunday Silence proved that once and for all in the 
Preakness Stakes on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But could Whittingham have the best 4-year-old colt as well? And if so, which 
one is it? 
</P>
<P>
Nasr el Arab, who will be favored in the $500,000 Turf Handicap at Hollywood 
Park on Memorial Day, made his case Sunday with a workout on the turf that 
would have won most races. 
</P>
<P>
Then, a few hours later, Ruhlmann took the stage and put away Sabona to win the 
$212,800 Mervyn LeRoy Handicap by a conclusive three lengths. Take your pick. 
</P>
<P>
Ruhlmann and Nasr el Arab may never meet, but if they do, Whittingham will be 
the last to play favorites. Between them, they could keep him smiling long 
after Sunday Silence has survived his Triple Crown ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
Ruhlmann's emergence as California's best middle distance runner has come at a 
time when there is a vacuum in the division. Only four horses could be mustered 
to face the seal-brown son of Mr. Leader in the LeRoy, despite the Grade I 
ranking of the 1 1/16-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
But then, who wants to stick their hand in a blender? Ruhlmann has been on 
everyone's mind since he broke the mile record at Santa Anita on March 5. He 
was every bit as impressive in winning the San Bernardino Handicap in his 
subsequent start. 
</P>
<P>
After the April 2 San Bernardino, however, the Ruhlmann watch became a favorite 
stable area pastime. 
</P>
<P>
"How fast did he go today?" was always heard whenever he was asked for speed in 
a workout. 
</P>
<P>
Under a succession of jockeys who are pretty tough to please -- including Chris 
McCarron, Laffit Pincay and Corey Black -- Ruhlmann dazzled them. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a freak," Black said after finishing third in the LeRoy on Perfec Travel. 
"He does things you can't believe." 
</P>
<P>
What Ruhlmann does best, according to both Pincay, his LeRoy rider, and 
assistant trainer Rodney Rash, is allow his considerable speed to be carefully 
rationed. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what pleased me the most about his race today," said Rash, who is 
caring for the horse while Whittingham is with Sunday Silence. 
</P>
<P>
"Until he showed me he could relax when Laffit wanted him to, I wasn't 
convinced he would realize his full potential. Today he proved how hard he will 
be to beat in any situation." 
</P>
<P>
The fans agreed. Rulhmann went off at odds of 3-10 and paid $2.60, $2.40 and 
$2.10. Sabona, hitting the board in the LeRoy for the third time in his career, 
returned $4 and $2.10, and Perfec Travel paid $2.10. Ruhlmann was so heavily 
bet that there was a $3,163 shortfall in the show pool, made up by the track. 
</P>
<P>
Ruhlmann, seven for 16 in his career, came within a fifth of a second of the 
track record with his final time of 1:41 1/5. 
</P>
<P>
"He let me rate him the first quarter mile," said Pincay, who swept all three 
stakes at Hollywood over the weekend. "Then I let him run a little down the 
backstretch, because I didn't want to discourage him. He's so competitive, I 
don't ever think I could take him way back. But he does whatever I ask, and 
that's the sign of a really good horse." 
</P>
<P>
Ruhlmann, showing poise, was running second to San Fernando Stakes winner Mi 
Preferido through the first turn and onto the backstretch before Pincay let out 
a notch. Ruhlmann eased to the lead from along the rail, and from there it 
became a matter of how far and how fast. 
</P>
<P>
Time has been on everyone's mind at Hollywood Park lately. The sandy track has 
been well watered to make it tight, and some outstanding times have been 
recorded. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the 2-year-old Magical Mile set a track record of :56 2/5 for five 
furlongs in his first start. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the allowance horse Sam Who set a track record of 1:08 for six 
furlongs, then a half hour later Bayakoa became only the second filly or mare 
in racing history to break the 1:33 barrier on the main track, winning the 
Hawthorne Handicap in 1:32 4/5. 
</P>
<P>
Things got a little out of hand, however, when the $10,000 claimer Madcuff won 
Sunday's 6 1/2-furlong first race in 1:15 1/5, just off the track mark. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Ruhlmann was expected go faster than 1:40 for the 1 1/16-mile 
race because he had done it more than a year ago at Bay Meadows.

AFTER PREAKNESS WIN, HORSE SETS SIGHTS ON BELMONT AND TRIPLE CROWN

Easy Goer was transported 200 miles from Pimlico to Belmont Park on Sunday, 
which means that he beat Sunday Silence to the site of the final Triple Crown 
race by a day. 
</P>
<P>
It's the only time Easy Goer has beaten Sunday Silence. 
</P>
<P>
Although heavily favored in two previous Triple Crown races, Easy Goer finished 
second to Sunday Silence each time. He was 2 1/2 lengths behind in the Kentucky 
Derby, and on Saturday at Pimlico, he was nosed out of a victory in what may go 
down as the most rousing Preakness of them all. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence and Easy Goer will meet again in the 121st Belmont Stakes on 
June 10. Sunday Silence can become the 12th 3-year-old -- and the first since 
another California-trained colt, Affirmed, in 1978 -- to sweep the Triple 
Crown. Because of a sponsorship by an automobile company, a Triple Crown title 
is worth $5 million, which includes the first-place purse money from all three 
races. Should Sunday Silence not win the Belmont but finish second or third, he 
would still win a $1-million bonus; Easy Goer could win the $1 million by 
winning the Belmont and if Sunday Silence finishes fourth or worse. 
</P>
<P>
Ron McAnally, trainer of Hawkster, a horse who has been unable to beat Sunday 
Silence in the Santa Anita Derby, the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness, doesn't 
need the Belmont to know which horse is best. Hawkster has been fourth, fifth 
and fifth in those three races. 
</P>
<P>
"Sunday Silence missed two days of training (because of a sore foot) and still 
won the Preakness," McAnally said. "There's no question that he's the best 
horse. Because of that, he was about two lengths rather than a nose better than 
Easy Goer on Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer's trainer, Shug McGaughey, thought that his colt's dull race in the 
Kentucky Derby was because of the muddy track at Churchill Downs. But there 
were no excuses in the 114th Preakness, unless you count the foul claim by 
jockey Pat Day, who thought that Sunday Silence squeezed his mount enough in 
the furious stretch run to be disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
"Easy Goer fouled Patrick (Valenzuela, Sunday Silence's jockey) a heck of a lot 
more than he was fouled by us," trainer Charlie Whittingham said Sunday 
morning. "The other horse had his head turned in my horse's direction and Day 
was whipping him left-handed on the rail, which made his horse come out some." 
</P>
<P>
The stewards took eight minutes -- a little longer than usual -- to review the 
race before they officiated Sunday Silence's victory. 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham said Sunday Silence will be shipped to Belmont Park today and be 
placed in trainer Dick Lundy's barn. Lundy worked as an assistant to 
Whittingham in California for six years before he formed his own stable. 
</P>
<P>
At 1 1/2 miles, the Belmont is the longest of the three Triple Crown races. The 
Derby is 1 1/4 miles and the Preakness is 1 3/16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Whittingham nor Day believe their horses will have trouble running the 
Belmont distance. Although Belmont Park issued a list of eight non-Preakness 
horses that are possibilities for the race, it remains to be seen how many will 
actually run. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though we missed two days last week because of the foot, I wasn't worried 
that Sunday Silence would be fit for the Preakness," Whittingham said. "He was 
plenty fit for the Derby two weeks before and had that under him. On Saturday, 
he was ready to run half-way to California without using the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
McGaughey thought that Day moved to the lead too early -- Easy Goer took over 
heading into the far turn -- but said that no jockey change is planned for the 
Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
"I agree with what Pat said," McGaughey said. "If he didn't move early, he 
would have been parked outside the rest of the way. And if he had waited and we 
still lost by a nose, everybody would have said that he moved too late." 
</P>
<P>
Pimlico's record crowd of 90,145 made Easy Goer the 3-5 favorite and sent 
Sunday Silence off at 2-1. In the Kentucky Derby, Sunday Silence was 3-1 and 
Easy Goer, coupled with stablemate Awe Inspiring, was 4-5. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's betting didn't surprise Whittingham, but it did amuse him. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys (Easy Goer's supporters) don't die very easy," he said. "It's the 
press that makes the odds, and sometimes they get people thinking poorly." 
</P>
<P>
In talking about Sunday Silence's second career defeat, which preceded his 
current five-race winning streak, Whittingham mentioned Houston, the horse that 
beat him in a 6 1/2-furlong allowance at Hollywood Park last December. This 
year, Houston has finished fifth in the Santa Anita Derby, eighth in the 
Kentucky Derby and sixth in the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
"Houston got good press early," Whittingham said. "But the race he beat us at 
Hollywood still told me that I had a very good horse. My horse had just broken 
his maiden a couple of weeks before, and against Houston he put away three 
horses early before they hooked up in the stretch." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence, who lost to Houston by a head, has developed into possibly the 
best horse Whittingham, 76, has ever had. Whittingham has won more than 500 
stakes races, which is a record, and has trained eight horses that have won 
national championships. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, Sunday Silence could be the best," Whittingham said. "For sure, 
he's the only one who's given me both a Derby and a Preakness." 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham won his first Derby in 1986 with Ferdinand. Their Triple Crown 
aspirations ended quickly, however, when Ferdinand was second, four lengths 
behind Snow Chief, in the Preakness, and then Ferdinand ran third in the 
Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Whittingham and Sunday Silence are only 1 1/2 miles away. Easy Goer has 
the early lead, but only because he shipped out of here Sunday.

BELL OPENS ROUND ONE; 
</P>
<P>
AS RAMS' MINI-CAMP STARTS, RUNNING BACK TAKES SOME JABS AT MANAGEMENT 
</P>

File this under new seasons, new tailbacks, new controversies, new holdouts. 
Eric Dickerson is only a memory, but the concept lives on in Anaheim, where the 
Rams open mini-camp today without leading rusher Greg Bell, who is laying the 
groundwork -- "If I was in Buffalo, I'd probably be making a million a year" -- 
for one hot summer of No. 42. 
</P>
<P>
The season opener, remember, is Sept. 10 at Atlanta, but don't be shocked if 
Bell isn't on the midnight plane to Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
So what makes for a really good holdout? Two sides that are absolutely rooted 
in their principles of rightness -- and can present convincing cases. Also, it 
helps if the player involved is articulate, educated and loose-lipped. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to Greg Bell vs. Rams Management. Gentlemen, start your engines. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, Georgia (Frontiere, Ram owner) is going to get tired of being 
second best," Bell said last week. "I don't know if I'll be here when she's 
tired of being second best. I don't know if you'll be writing when she's tired 
of being second best. 
</P>
<P>
"Al Davis doesn't want to be second best. He always wants to be first class, 
and first in line. That's the way he wants to live his life. Same thing with 
Jerry Buss. You're talking about championship ball clubs. Right now, in L.A., 
the Rams are very nonexistent." 
</P>
<P>
More gunfire later, but first some background. The Rams, you'll recall, 
reluctantly took over payments on Bell when the Buffalo Bills wanted to unload 
him as part of the Dickerson trade in 1987. Bell was a talented but mysterious 
runner -- a former first-round pick and 1,000-yard rusher -- who had 
free-fallen from grace in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams took him aboard with no guarantees; in fact his chances of making last 
year's roster seemed slim after the Rams selected tailback Gaston Green with 
their first pick in 1988. The Rams told Bell as much. They offered a 
take-it-or-leave-it, one-year contract at $300,000 for 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Bell wanted to leave it, but said the Rams refused his many requests for a 
trade before training camp. 
</P>
<P>
You know the rest of the story: Bell came to camp, won the starting tailback 
job from Charles White and Green, then made the Rams look like geniuses. He 
finished the season as the National Football League's fourth-leading rusher 
with 1,212 yards, trailing only the millionaire rushing firm of Dickerson, 
(Herschel) Walker, and (Roger) Craig. Bell also led the NFL with 18 touchdowns 
despite not starting three games (CD: coach's decision). 
</P>
<P>
Ram Coach John Robinson wasn't always enamored with his new runner, though he 
finally asked late last season that we all accept Greg Bell for what he'd done. 
It was a compliment. 
</P>
<P>
So guess who wants a raise? And deserves one. The Rams are offering Bell a 
two-year deal with base salaries of $400,000 with a chance to make an extra 
$150,000 per season in incentives. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that Bell wants about twice as much in base salaries. 
</P>
<P>
"If you measured a football field as the distance of being apart, we're 10 
football fields apart," Bell's agent, Kathy Clements, said this week. 
</P>
<P>
The battle lines have been drawn, and it's not a pretty picture. Bell appears 
ready to sit out the summer to make a stand. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm not going to Tokyo," he said, referring to the team's overseas 
exhibition opener against San Francisco Aug. 5. "I don't mind not being in 
camp. If I have to wait until September to walk in here, that's the toll I'm 
prepared to go." 
</P>
<P>
To prove he's serious about his football and future, Bell has been working out 
at a fever pitch down at Rams Park. He's dropped 10 pounds in the off-season 
and has never been in better shape. 
</P>
<P>
He's gambling that the Rams need an experienced fish in a sea of youthful 
runners, and that the team has finally grown tired of grueling contract 
negotiations and second-place finishes. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rams will consistently win 10, 11 games a season," Bell said. "But will 
you hear from them? For many years, the Rams have been eating half the pie. It 
takes a whole pie to fill you up." 
</P>
<P>
Bell insists he's not being unreasonable. In fact, he maintains he's a regular 
blue-light special. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not asking for the moon," he said. "Just pay me what the market says I 
deserve to be paid. . . . The market would say I deserve $900,000 to $950,000 a 
season. What I'm asking for is below market." 
</P>
<P>
Bell bases his numbers on Dickerson's salary of $1.4 million per season and 
Bell being the fourth-leading rusher in the league last season. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Rams haven't always paid attention to market prices. And while 
they don't discuss negotiations publicly, their feelings toward Bell seem clear 
enough: They would argue that they plucked Bell from the ashes of Buffalo and 
possibly saved his career. They would argue he thrived in the John Robinson 
system, running behind one of the NFL's best offensive lines. 
</P>
<P>
They would argue that Bell is hardly comparable to Dickerson, who was the Ram 
offense during four-plus seasons. They could argue that several talented 
runners (Green, Robert Delpino, Cleveland Gary) are standing in line to pick up 
the slack. 
</P>
<P>
Bell said he's not disturbed that the Rams recently used yet another 
first-round choice on a runner. 
</P>
<P>
"Cleveland Gary I don't think is going to go out and do the things I do on the 
field," Bell said. "When I was in Buffalo, the next year they went out and 
picked Ronnie Harmon, and everyone knows what kind of a pick that was. . . . 
They wanted a big, inside runner who can catch the ball. He (Gary) has done 
some great things in college. A lot of guys do great things in college." 
</P>
<P>
But the Rams, of course, can play hardball with the best pitchers. They waited 
out a two-game Dickerson holdout in 1985. They froze Henry Ellard out for seven 
games in 1986. Last year, they squashed receiver Ron Brown, who retired in 
frustration only to return later in the season on the team's financial terms. 
</P>
<P>
So what makes Greg Bell so different? It's true, as Bell said, the Rams 
softened their hard-line negotiating stance last season when it was important 
to facilitate the signing of the draft picks acquired for Dickerson. 
</P>
<P>
But they can still make it hard on individual players, and very much control 
Bell's rights under the present laws of NFL "free" agency. 
</P>
<P>
If they so chose, the Rams could decide not to deal with Bell at all, still 
retain his rights, and make him sit out the season. 
</P>
<P>
"If that happens, then Greg Bell will do just like John Shaw," Greg Bell said 
of the Rams' vice president, who has given most negotiating responsibilities 
over to Jay Zygmunt. "I'll just use my brain. His brain isn't any more 
intelligent than mine is. I went to college. I worked just as hard as he has. 
I've worked on my MBA as hard as he has. I could go into junk bonds and make 
five billion dollars. I think I can go out and live comfortably." 
</P>
<P>
He may get the chance to find out, especially if Bell continues comparing the 
standard to certain rival owners. 
</P>
<P>
"It all boils down to do you want to wear a ring," Bell said. "Teams that are 
gung-ho toward keeping unity and paying properly are the teams that are wearing 
rings. You can look at Al Davis and say, ah, he wastes money, but every time Al 
looks down he sees those rings on his fingers. . . . It's the same thing (San 
Francisco owner Edward) DeBartolo says. They conquered the '80s. The 49ers have 
two quarterbacks who make a million each, and one sits on the bench. There's no 
dissension at all. But from the day I walked into our locker room, the one 
thing I saw was dissension. When I walked in here, it was Eric and LeRoy 
(Irvin). Last summer, it was the whole defensive line." 
</P>
<P>
Next up appears to be Greg Bell. 
</P>
<P>
Mini-camp Notes 
</P>
<P>
Veteran linebacker Carl Ekern, recently asked by the Rams to retire after 13 
seasons, will stay on with the team as a volunteer coach. "We've obviously got 
a full coaching staff already," Ekern said. "So I'm just helping out. It'll be 
a heck of a learning experience for me." Defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur 
has called Ekern the smartest player he's ever coached. Ekern, 35, admits he's 
also hanging around in case of emergency. "It's 99% true that I'm probably done 
playing," he said. "But you never know. If something catastrophic were to 
happen, they might try to dig up some old bones." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jim Everett is entering the last year of his contract, which will 
pay him $450,000 this season. The Rams and Everett's agent, Marvin Demoff, will 
quietly attempt to work out a renegotiation during the season. . . . Despite 
three consecutive Pro Bowl appearances, safety Jerry Gray will earn only 
$250,000 this season. Gray said progress is being made toward renegotiation and 
he will attend practices this week. And so will receiver Ron Brown, who is 
without a contract. . . . Though cornerback LeRoy Irvin's contract runs through 
1990, he said last week that 1989 will likely be his last season. . . . The 
mini-camp runs through Thursday.

Pete Rose becomes eligible for induction into baseball's Hall of Fame in 1992, 
but he may not get the 75% of the vote required if it is determined he bet on 
games involving the Cincinnti Reds, according to a survey taken by the Palm 
Beach (Fla.) Post. 
</P>
<P>
The Post reported that it contacted 68 Hall of Fame voters from the Baseball 
Writers Assn. of America, the official balloting body. If Rose is suspended for 
life for betting on the Reds, only 54.4% of those responding said they would 
still vote for Rose. 
</P>
<P>
And only 32% said they would vote for induction if it is determined Rose bet 
against the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
A sizable group, 16.2% of those contact, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
The 68 surveyed by the Post represent only about 15% of the total number who 
will vote.

GOLF ROUNDUP;

<P>
LOPEZ SHOOTS FINAL-ROUND 66, WINS LPGA TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the start of Sunday's final round of the LPGA Championship at Mason, Ohio, 
Ayako Okamoto held a two-stroke lead in her pursuit to win her first major 
title on the women's tour. 
</P>
<P>
But she was anything but confident considering she had fallen victim to golf's 
fickleness on past occasions. 
</P>
<P>
Her worse fears were realized once again when Nancy Lopez won her third LPGA 
Championship -- all at the Jack Nicklaus Sports Center Grizzly Course -- with a 
final-round six-under-par 66, overtaking Okamoto on the final eight holes to 
win by three shots. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the 40th of Lopez' 13-year professional career. 
</P>
<P>
"Nancy is No. 1. . . . " Okamoto said. 
</P>
<P>
Okamoto, who has been in or near the lead in the final round of the last five 
LPGA Championships, said she was not surprised to be overtaken. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew that Nancy -- or somebody -- would catch up after the turn," she said. 
"A one- or two-stroke lead isn't much over those players." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez has won more than $157,000 on the Jack Nicklaus Sports Center course in 
her 11 LPGA Championships. She lived on the course for two years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to compare them," she said of her three LPGA victories. "All have 
been special for me. The first year (as a rookie in 1978), being so young, 
winning with my dad here and all of that pressure at such a young age -- it 
meant a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez finished at 14-under-par 274 after earlier rounds of 71, 69 and 68. Her 
closing 66 was the low round of the day. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was Lopez' fifth top-10 finish in the LPGA Championship. It was her 
first victory of 1989 and made her the top money-winner with more than 
$279,000. She has finished in the top three in eight of her 10 tournaments this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Okamoto's closing 71 gave her a 277 total. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Sanders, a non-winner in five years on the tour, closed with a 68 to 
finish third at 278. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Bradley, who won the LPGA Championship in 1986, shot a 73 for 283, tied 
with non-winner Allison Finney. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Geddes, the 1987 LPGA Championship winner, was at 284 with a final-round 
71. Patty Sheehan closed with a 78 for 285. 
</P>
<P>
Ian Baker-Finch of Australia was given breathing room by the double bogey that 
struck down Tim Simpson on the 14th hole and cruised to a four-stroke victory 
in the Colonial National Invitation tournament at Ft. Worth, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Baker-Finch needed only a closing round of par 70 to become the first 
wire-to-wire winner on the PGA Tour this year. 
</P>
<P>
David Edwards, nine strokes back when play began, took second with a 65 for a 
274 total, and Simpson, one stroke closer when play started, finished with a 68 
for 276 and was tied for third with South African David Frost, who had a 
closing 69. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Charles shot a five-under-par 65 to defend his title in the $300,000 
Commemorative Seniors tournament, breaking his tournament record with a 
17-under-par 193 total for 54 holes. 
</P>
<P>
Charles, who had a four-stroke lead entering play Sunday, saw it narrowed to 
two by Don Bies when he bogeyed the par-4 eighth hole. He recovered to win by 
five shots. 
</P>
<P>
It was Charles' third tour victory this year. He has earned $45,000 to boost 
his 1989 earnings to $184,137. 
</P>
<P>
Holly Hartley of Oceanside shot a one-under-par 71 and Taiwan's Huang Bie-shyun 
slumped to a 76 to give Hartley a two-stroke victory in the Chukyo 
TV-Bridgestone tournament at Kasugai, Japan.

NEWSWIRE: NEWSPAPER SAYS MILLS IS CONSIDERING ARIZONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chris Mills, former Los Angeles prep star ruled ineligible by the NCAA to play 
at Kentucky, is considering transferring to Arizona, the Arizona Republic 
reported in its Sunday editions. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona Coach Lute Olson is in West Germany with the Wildcat basketball team 
and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, it was reported that Mills, who played at Fairfax High, is considering 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA on Friday placed Kentucky on three years' probation for several 
violations. Among them is the case of Mills' father allegedly being mailed 
$1,000 by Kentucky assistant Dwane Casey. 
</P>
<P>
Mills was Kentucky's second-leading scorer as a freshman.

NUNN WILL DEFEND HIS IBF TITLE AGAINST BARKLEY AUG. 14 IN RENO

<P>
International Boxing Federation middleweight champion Michael Nunn of North 
Hollywood has signed to defend his title against former World Boxing Council 
champion Iran Barkley on Aug. 14 in Reno. 
</P>
<P>
It'll be the third title defense for the unbeaten Nunn (33-0, 23 knockouts), 
who is coming off his most impressive performance, a devastating first-round 
knockout of Sumbu Kalambay in March. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley (25-5, 16 knockouts) is coming off his most disappointing loss, to 
Roberto Duran in February on a split decision that cost him his WBC crown. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn will receive in excess of $1 million for the fight, Barkley a little bit 
under half-a-million. 
</P>
<P>
The choice of Reno as a site ends months of negotiations that involved Las 
Vegas, Atlantic City and the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
The fight will be televised by HBO. STEVE SPRINGER

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
ATHLETICS ARE WINNING DIFFERENTLY THIS SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
At this time last season, the Oakland Athletics were already well on their way 
to claiming the American League pennant. They were winning games with pitching 
and the hitting of the Bash Brothers, Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
They had a 29-14 record after 43 games and were leading the West by seven 
games. 
</P>
<P>
This season, half of the Bash Brothers tandem -- Canseco, who hit 42 homers and 
stole 40 bases -- hasn't played a game because of a wrist injury, and although 
they lead the West, they are unable to distance themselves from the Angels 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, even though teams are pitching around McGwire, the Athletics 
have an identical record (29-14) after 43 games. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of winning with power hitting, the Athletics have had to scratch out 
runs and depend even more on their strong pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Parker snapped a tie with a bases loaded single in a four-run fourth 
inning Sunday at Oakland and the Athletics held on for a 5-4 victory over the 
Boston Red Sox to beat Roger Clemens (5-3) and remain a game ahead of the 
Angels. 
</P>
<P>
On a day when Curt Young didn't have his best stuff, young Todd Burns pitched a 
strong 3 2/3 2/3 innings to improve his record to 3-0 and Dennis Eckersley 
pitched a hitless ninth inning to get his 14th save. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not happy with my batting average (.251), but I am contributing," Parker 
said. "We know that with McGwire in the lineup, we will get more pitches to 
hit. I'm starting to see the ball better." 
</P>
<P>
Parker, who drove in two runs in Saturday's victory, has raised his average 40 
points and has driven in 10 runs in the last nine games. 
</P>
<P>
About the only time Eckersley is noticed is the rare occasion in which he gives 
up a run instead of getting a save. He did it in spectacular fashion Friday 
night, serving up a grand slam to Dwight Evans that won the game for the Red 
Sox. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, Evans hit his sixth home run in the second inning as the Red Sox gave 
Clemens a 3-0 lead. Ordinarily, that's all the brilliant right-hander needs. 
But not this time. He went the distance, yielding seven hits while walking 
four. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 2, Baltimore 0 -- It wasn't a victory, but after his first start in 
two seasons, Brian Holton could smile. 
</P>
<P>
As a relief pitcher last season, Holton played a part in the Dodgers drive to 
the National League pennant and the world championship. For the Dodgers, he was 
7-3 and had an earned-run average of 1.70. In six innings of postseason play he 
gave up only one run. 
</P>
<P>
Now 30, Holton was not unhappy that he was included in the trade with the 
Orioles that sent Eddie Murray to the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday at Baltimore, in his first chance to start, Holton went six innings, 
giving up eight hits, but no earned runs. His record fell to 1-4. 
</P>
<P>
His downfall came in the third inning when Felix Fermin reached on third 
baseman Craig Worthington's error. It was the first error by an Oriole 
infielder since Worthington committed one April 30. One run scored on two 
singles and the other when right fielder Steve Finley made a wild throw trying 
to double up a runner at first base after he made a fine catch. 
</P>
<P>
"That's baseball," Holton said. "We're not going to be shut out every game. I 
know I'll get rewarded later on. I feel pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
New York 6, Seattle 2 -- Rookie Clay Parker, in just his third major league 
start, pitched a five-hitter and struck out 10 at Seattle to beat his former 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, a 26-year-old right-hander obtained in a trade for outfielder Henry 
Cotto, took a shutout into the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
He lost it when Scott Bradley singled and Ken Griffey, Jr. hit a line drive 
that bounced off the head of diving center fielder Roberto Kelly for an 
inside-the-park homer. It was the sixth home run for the talented rookie. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees beat ace left-hander Mark Langston, who is rumored to be on the 
trading block. Langston (4-5) allowed eight hits and five runs in 6 2/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 6, Texas 1 -- Although he had an 0-2 record, Twins' Manager Tom Kelly 
thought Francisco Oliveras deserved another chance. 
</P>
<P>
Olivares reponded by giving up only four hits in seven innings at Arlington, 
Tex., to win his first major league game. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 4, Kansas City 2 -- Fred Lynn broke out of a season-long slump with 
three hits, including a two-run double at Detroit to lead the Tigers to a 
three-game sweep of the Royals. The Tigers are 3-0 since Manager Sparky 
Anderson was sent home to rest. 
</P>
<P>
Going into the game, Lynn was batting only .191. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 9, Chicago 3 -- The Blue Jays are starting to score runs, and they are 
winning under interim manager Cito Gaston. They pounded out 12 hits at Chicago 
to give them a 5-1 record since Gaston took over. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson Liriano had three hits, including a go-ahead double in the sixth. He is 
now nine for 11 in his hot streak. 
</P>
<P>
George Bell and Ernie Whitt hit homers in the ninth and John Cerutti won for 
the first time since last July. DAN HAFNER

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
MAHLER GETS HIS SIXTH WIN FOR CINCINNATI, 7-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Rick Mahler never has been overpowering and he has a tendency to fade when the 
weather gets hot and humid. But in the cool of the spring, Mahler has been one 
of the most successful pitchers in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
For 10 years, from 1979 through 1988, he usually helped get the Atlanta Braves 
off to a good start. 
</P>
<P>
Mahler is now doing the same for the Cincinnati Reds, who signed the 
35-year-old right-hander as a free agent last December. 
</P>
<P>
Mahler pitched an eight-hitter Sunday at Cincinnati and, with Eric Davis 
getting four hits and driving in three runs, breezed to a 7-2 victory over the 
Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
Mahler, who was the victim of poor defense in his first two starts, improved 
his record to 6-4. He has won five of his last six starts and has pitched three 
complete games. 
</P>
<P>
Mahler also helped his own cause with a bunt single to trigger a four-run 
fourth inning that gave the Reds a 4-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Bielecki (3-2) picked up Mahler's bunt and threw it away, allowing two 
runs to score. 
</P>
<P>
Mahler has two shutouts and has impressed Cincinnati Manager Pete Rose, who 
originally planned to use the 35-year-old Mahler as a long reliever and only an 
occasional starter. 
</P>
<P>
"He knows what he's doing," Rose said. "You can learn a lot about the game of 
pitching from watching him. He's a master when he pitches like he has lately. 
He has one of the better ERAs and I like to watch him. He makes them earn what 
they get." 
</P>
<P>
The Braves gave up on Mahler because they are committed to a youth movement 
that is going quite well. Last season, in posting a 9-16 record, he gave up 
more hits (279) and runs (125) than any other pitcher in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I'm pitching better than I did my last two seasons with the Braves," 
Mahler said. "When the breaking ball is working for me, I often get a lot of 
strikeouts." 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 10, New York 6 -- The problem for the Mets, who were expecting to 
run away with the East, has been their inability to score runs. For the most 
part, the pitching and defense have been adequate. 
</P>
<P>
But in this game at New York, that wasn't the case. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets gave Sid Fernandez a quick 4-1 lead, then the Giants, taking advantage 
of a two-out throwing error by shortstop Kevin Elster, scored six runs in the 
seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Kennedy's bases-loaded pinch double was the big blow in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets were leading, 5-4, when Roger McDowell took over with one out in the 
seventh and one on. 
</P>
<P>
With two out, Will Clark singled to tie the game and Kevin Mitchell also 
singled. Ken Obkerfell grounded to short, but Elster's throw was high and the 
Giants were rolling. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, who hit his major league-leading 14th home run in the second, had 
three other hits. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where we would be without Mitchell," Giant Manager Roger Craig 
said. "We'd probably be in last place or pretty close. He's had stretches where 
he's carried us. We just went along for the ride." 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 17, Houston 5 -- Could it be the hitters are finally ready to meet 
the challenge of the National League pitchers? 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates, who have had more troubles with the pitchers than most teams, had 
18 hits in this game at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Van Slyke, recently returned from a rib cage injury, had four hits, 
including his first home run. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Bonilla also homered and the Pirates gave Neal Heaton (1-4) his first win 
since last July, although he lasted only five innings. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 6, Atlanta 1 -- The Cardinals and Braves were tied 1-1 after nine 
innings at Atlanta before a throwing error by third baseman Ron Gant helped the 
Cardinals score five times in the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
Gant's error let in the go-ahead run, then Ozzie Smith and Vince Coleman 
followed with RBI singles and Willie McGee singled in two more. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 3, San Diego 1 -- Steve Jeltz, who hadn't homered since 1984, hit 
a two-run home run in the eighth inning as Philadelphia beat the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the second homer of the infielder's career and he had failed to hit 
one in his previous 1,357 at-bats. DAN HAFNER

NEW TIDE OF 'BOAT PEOPLE' FLOODING ASIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

PULAU BIDONG CAMP, Malaysia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new tide of Vietnamese "boat people" has swamped Asian countries in recent 
weeks, overwhelming refugee facilities and threatening to undermine an 
international agreement aimed at solving the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Refugees in the region's camps have increased to more than 71,000, the highest 
level since 1979, when an international conference set standards by which 
Vietnamese could be resettled in the United States and other Western nations. 
</P>
<P>
Hardest hit are Malaysia, which recorded 3,400 arrivals in April, and Hong 
Kong, where arrivals reached 2,918 the same month and where refugees continue 
to pour in at the rate of 270 a day. Even the Philippines, which has received 
few "boat people" over the past decade, had 1,286 refugees in April -- six 
times the number for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
The surge occurred after members of the Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations 
announced March 14 that they no longer would automatically accept refugees for 
resettlement -- a well-publicized move that observers believe is triggering the 
latest exodus from economically stagnant Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
These countries -- Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Brunei, Singapore and the 
Philippines -- agreed to follow the example of Hong Kong, which last June began 
screening arriving refugees and rejecting those considered to be fleeing 
economic hardship rather than political persecution. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the 'last train from the station' mentality that has taken hold," one 
Western relief official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "The 
announcement of the March 14 deadline without putting any other measures in 
place to deal with the question was an unmitigated disaster." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Entire Families Are Leaving 
</P>
<P>
One significant change, according to refugee officials, underscores the widely 
held belief by the "boat people" that this may be their last chance. In the 
past, most used to flee without relatives in the hope that others would follow; 
now, entire families are leaving Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, so many refugees have arrived in the past month that the 
government has been forced to put 1,600 "boat people" on four rented ferries 
moored in the harbor -- a temporary measure because of the incipient danger of 
typhoons in the summer months. An uproar was created earlier this month when 
the government decided to ship 2,000 new arrivals to already crowded camps. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is accommodation," said Michael Hanson, the British colony's 
refugee coordinator. "Conditions are going to deteriorate. There's no way to 
avoid it." 
</P>
<P>
And Ruby Lee, the head of the Malaysian Red Crescent Society, which cares for 
refugees in that country, declared: "It has to come to the breaking point. 
Maybe it will create an awareness so that other governments will take a 
decision. It's preferable to have a crisis situation now than four weeks from 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Next month, a new international conference is scheduled in Geneva to decide on 
a refugee policy to replace the one adopted in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Draft Agreement 
</P>
<P>
Under a draft agreement adopted after a preparatory meeting in Kuala Lumpur, at 
which the March 14 cutoff was announced, Vietnam said it would discourage 
illegal departures and take back "boat people" who volunteer to return home. 
The so-called "first asylum" countries of Asia, meanwhile, said they would 
receive the "boat people" and screen them for political refugees, while 
resettlement countries of the West, led by the United States, Canada, Australia 
and Britain, agreed to continue accepting political refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Under the 1979 agreement, virtually all "boat people" were considered refugees 
and eligible for resettlement. But the mood has changed dramatically with the 
passage of time after the Vietnam War, and many governments now feel that the 
grounds for offering refugee status to Vietnamese have largely disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Even if a new final agreement is achieved in Geneva, it will take several 
months, or even years, to begin to implement it. Meanwhile, the refugees are 
expected to keep arriving in large numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Pulau Bidong, a typical refugee camp on a tiny island 20 miles from the 
northeastern Malaysian town of Kuala Terengganu, already is extremely 
overcrowded and rat-infested. In the last year, the camp's population has risen 
from about 5,000 to 14,359, although there are accommodations for only 6,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Congestion Growing Worse 
</P>
<P>
The congestion has become so serious that authorities recently had to raise the 
floorboards in the refugees' houses and move in families under the floors. 
</P>
<P>
"They're packed in so tightly, I don't see how they're going to get any more 
people in," said Nancy Charlesworth, a nun from Buffalo, N.Y., who works with 
unaccompanied children who are refugees. "They'll have to hang hammocks from 
the trees." 
</P>
<P>
Already, camp officials have taken over six school classrooms to use for 
housing, and more are threatened. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have to close the schools, the young people will have nothing to do," 
said Pierre Francesco, program director on the island for the Office of the 
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
As it has become clear that Malaysia cannot proceed with its original plan to 
accept upward of 20,000 refugees, officials said it also is evident that the 
overcrowding in Pulau Bidong and other camps also could prove a significant 
factor in the Geneva deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Malaysia Seeks to Get Word Out 
</P>
<P>
One Malaysian official conceded privately that his government would like the 
word to get back to Vietnam about how bad conditions are. Authorities only 
recently opened the camp to journalists. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of interviews here, many refugees who fled Vietnam acknowledged 
that they were aware of the cutoff but were undeterred by it. 
</P>
<P>
One was Vu Thi Kim Van, a 39-year-old mother of two with relatives in San 
Antonio, Tex., who arrived March 31. "I'd rather die in the sea than go back to 
Vietnam," she declared, echoing the sentiments of many other refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Another refugee, Nguyen Kim Lang, said she had tried several times to escape 
her country, only to be turned back. "I hope the Malaysian government and the 
U.N. will take pity on us and accept us for resettlement," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The determination of the refugees is evident from the fact that many have come 
across despite a series of pirate attacks that have left hundreds dead. Doan 
Van Ly, a former South Vietnamese army major who was released recently after 13 
years in a re-education camp, has been told that three of his nephews were 
murdered by pirates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Won't Stop Coming' 
</P>
<P>
"I cry for my nephews, but we won't stop coming," Ly said. "We cannot live with 
the Communists." 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all the men interviewed said they had served in the army before the 
collapse of South Vietnam in 1975. Army service is expected to be a major 
criterion when the screening of refugees is started after the Geneva 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
Public officials in Malaysia and Hong Kong are talking about a need for Vietnam 
to accept the notion of forced repatriation -- in other words, to take back 
those who are not considered refugees, whether they want to go back or not. 
Vietnam has previously opposed forced repatriation on "humanitarian grounds" -- 
a stand in which it finds itself in rare accord with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is particularly sensitive in Hong Kong, where the British 
administration accepts Vietnamese "boat people" but immediately sends back 
refugees from China, where many Hong Kong Chinese have relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson, the colony's refugee coordinator, said he feels that a refugee policy 
will not work without "involuntary repatriation" for "boat people" who are not 
admitted as political refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Since June 14, Hong Kong has screened 1,463 "boat people" out of 17,000 
arrivals. Of this number, only 145 have been accepted as refugees. Those not 
accepted are sent to closed camps, surrounded by barbed wire and operated by 
the prison department. Those who are accepted are sent to refugee camps that 
are open and where the residents may have jobs and attend schools outside. 
</P>
<P>
The government caused a furor in early May by bowing to public pressure and 
dropping its plans to settle 2,000 refugees in a vacant public housing project 
called the Four Seasons. Instead, they were sent to an already overcrowded camp 
where authorities were forced to convert workrooms into housing space. 
</P>
<P>
"Many thousands of those Vietnamese are children," Phillip Barker, director of 
the Save the Children Fund in Hong Kong, said in a letter to the South China 
Morning Post. "Some have been pushed around like parcels five or six times in 
the last 18 months in the wake of so-called government policy. The use of 
children as pawns in an abusive 'game' cannot be condoned." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Barker said his group was considering withdrawing from the 
refugee program in Hong Kong because of the resources that have been wasted. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some refugee experts believe that the problem of the Vietnamese 
"boat people" will not be solved unless all arrivals are returned to Vietnam 
and told to apply for resettlement under the Orderly Departure Program. 
</P>
<P>
The program was created as an alternative for Vietnamese wishing to leave, and 
it relocated 22,000 people directly from Vietnam last year. But the waiting 
list is very long -- people who applied in June, 1982, are only now being 
processed -- and escaping by boat is seen as a way of jumping to the head of 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like buying a lottery ticket," Barker said.

YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This has always been a land of stark contrasts and magnificent subtleties, 
never more so than in the aftermath of last summer's spectacular season of fire 
which scorched enough timber and meadow to rival Rhode Island in size. 
</P>
<P>
From the sky where the graceful bald eagles soar, the oldest and grandest of 
our national parks now resembles a peculiar marble cake, baked by the caprice 
of nature into patternless swirls of vegetation and death. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Much Unscathed 
</P>
<P>
Despite infernos that whipped through the treetops like blast furnaces, most of 
the pristine landscape emerged unscathed, as did the elusive grizzly bears in 
the high country, the resilient herds of elk and bison and the famous geysers 
that fill the air with eerie puffs of steam and mist. With the last of the 
winter snow rapidly melting, much of Yellowstone is bathed in the glorious hues 
of spring. 
</P>
<P>
But cut into the green are huge gashes of once-thriving forest that now appear 
either pitch black or rusty brown, depending on whether the trees were roasted 
or merely singed. Either way, they're dead. 
</P>
<P>
Once-lush hillsides are now covered by little more than the skeletons of 
stately lodgepole pines. Their needles, twigs and even limbs gone up in smoke, 
some of these "widowmakers," as loggers call them, still jut precariously from 
the charred dirt. Others lay scattered across the ground like giant 
pick-up-sticks. 
</P>
<P>
Down at ground level, the same scenery is a thing of beauty, not devastation, 
to the eyes of soil scientist Henry Shovic. He turns a spade of blackened earth 
and finds rich brown soil just beneath the crust, a sign that the forest not 
only remains fertile but will soon be teeming with new life. 
</P>
<P>
Already, clumps of grasses are beginning to jut to the surface and here and 
there a yellow buttercup or purple shooting star has also broken through. In a 
few weeks, meadow floors will be carpeted in a thick blanket of wildflowers. 
"Did you see the green?" asks Shovic, ecstatic. "I'm amazed. It's going to be a 
picture postcard." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spring Brings Rebirth 
</P>
<P>
Spring has come to Yellowstone and with it an inspiring process of rebirth and 
renewal. But while the 1988 blazes have long since flamed out, the controversy 
they kindled is still smoldering. It is sure to leave its mark on future fire 
and management policies not just at Yellowstone but throughout the vast system 
of national parks and wilderness areas. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a hell of a summer, let me tell you," said Yellowstone Supt. Bob 
Barbee. 
</P>
<P>
Arguments still rage over the impact of the fires on wildlife, the conduct of 
officials responsible for monitoring the blazes and the role of the media and 
others in creating an erroneous impression that a national treasure had somehow 
been reduced to cinders. 
</P>
<P>
The debate has also served to underscore a basic conflict in the mission of 
national parks as set out by Congress. On the one hand, they are supposed to be 
preserves of the past, the last outposts in America where nature is allowed to 
take its course with as little intrusion as possible from man. On the other 
hand, they are also set aside as vacation and tourist havens for the taxpayers, 
who, after all, pay the bills. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, said James Agee, a forest ecology specialist at the University 
of Washington, the furor raised by the fires should force environmentalists to 
temper their purist approach to park management. Ecologists argue that 
wildfires clear away dead timber and overgrowth and are vital to the 
rejuvenation of forests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tied to Neighbors 
</P>
<P>
But "parks can no longer be considered ecological and sociological islands," 
Agee told a conference of conservationists here over the weekend. "They are 
inextricably tied to their neighbors for better or worse." 
</P>
<P>
Some movement in that direction may already be under way. The Interior 
Department, parent of the National Park Service, has already ordered a 
summer-long moratorium on its politically sensitive "let-burn" policy, under 
which lightning-triggered blazes are allowed to burn unless they threaten human 
lives or property. The edict applies to all but two parks in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"With the exception of Big Cypress and the Everglades, we will be in full 
suppression mode," a park service spokesman explained. 
</P>
<P>
And, after a sweeping review and nationwide public hearings, the agency has 
tentatively decided to modify -- though not flatly abandon -- the controversial 
fire strategy once the moratorium expires. Under the changes, expected to be 
announced shortly by Bush Administration officials, all parks would have to run 
through a safety check list that includes an assessment of weather, moisture, 
winds and available firefighting crews before they could make a decision on 
whether or not to let a lightning fire burn. 
</P>
<P>
Leading environmentalists are cautiously optimistic about the new plan because 
it retains at least a stated commitment to the retention of so-called "natural" 
policies. At the same time, however, they warn that saddling park managers with 
extensive conditions could effectively result in quick suppression of all 
wildfires. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Become Gun-Shy 
</P>
<P>
Michael Scott, regional director of the Wilderness Society, said restrictions 
could lead to a "systematic politicization of ecosystem management" and make 
officials gun-shy about letting fire burn for any reason. 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to say 'we better just put out the fires,' " Scott predicted. 
"There could be a chilling effect on allowing nature to take its course." 
</P>
<P>
From an ecologist's standpoint, the "let-burn" policy could be the most serious 
casualty of last year's blazes, which swelled to historic proportions and 
ultimately seared nearly 1 million of the park's 2.2 million acres. 
</P>
<P>
Heeding complaints that fires were getting out of hand and could threaten 
surrounding communities, officials suspended the policy by mid-July. And some 
of last year's most destructive blazes were triggered by man, not nature, and 
fought from the first sign of smoke. Eventually 25,000 firefighters were called 
in from around the nation and the bill for suppression efforts soared to $120 
million, nearly 10 times the size of Yellowstone's annual operating budget. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say the flames were fanned by record drought and gale- force winds 
and virtually nothing could have stopped them. "What is most humbling is that 
one-quarter inch of rain and snow on Sept. 11 essentially stopped what the 
greatest firefighting effort in history could not," argued John Varley, 
Yellowstone's chief scientist. 
</P>
<P>
But many local politicians and residents disagree. They say the park did too 
little, too late and let the fires get out of hand. And many people who live in 
nearby resort communities remain bitter over what they contend was a 
preventable tragedy that could scare away tourists and imperil their 
livelihoods. 
</P>
<P>
"If (park superintendent) Barbee were here I'd choke him to death even today," 
said Betty Morton, a motel owner in tiny Cooke City, where the threat of fire 
forced a temporary evacuation last September. "Even a 5-year-old child knows if 
something's burning you got to stop it quick. All that stuff about burning's 
good for growth is a crock. I'll never see any of it in my lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Keep Job 
</P>
<P>
While many critics have called for Barbee's head, Interior Secretary Manuel 
Lujan Jr. said in an interview that the Yellowstone superintendent was in no 
danger of losing his job. Still, Lujan, a former New Mexico congressman 
appointed to his Cabinet post only this year, said park officials should have 
"admitted" that they erred in losing control of the blazes. 
</P>
<P>
To a great extent, lingering resentment over the conduct of firefighting 
efforts is fueled by economic uncertainty. Morton, for example, said all 12 of 
the cabins she rents out are usually reserved for the Memorial Day weekend 
weeks in advance. This year, only one of the rooms has been taken so far. 
</P>
<P>
There are conflicting signals over what impact the fires have had on the 
tourist trade. Other independent innkeepers, as well as lodges in the park, 
also report that reservations are soft. However, Marsha Karle, a spokeswoman 
for the park, said letters and calls logged by Yellowstone operators are about 
double their usual pace and the number of visitors entering the park so far 
this spring has been well above normal. 
</P>
<P>
The park has embarked on an unprecedented publicity drive as well as an 
$8.5-million rehabilitation project to reassure reluctant tourists that it has 
not been transformed into a bleak wasteland. The centerpiece of the campaign 
appears to be an effort to turn what, to some might appear a disaster, into an 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"Welcome to the New Yellowstone," reads the headline on a special fire brochure 
handed to each visitor as they drive into the park. " . . . We have the rare 
opportunity to witness wildlife regeneration on a scale rarely seen anywhere on 
Earth." 
</P>
<P>
A new $250,000 exhibit on fire ecology is under construction, as is a series of 
wayside exhibits describing various fire scenes. Interpretive programs will 
feature talks on fire and its effects and there are even tentative plans to 
develop a children's trail through a fire-damaged area to explain the 
phenomenon to youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expect Many Scientists 
</P>
<P>
While the response from tourists is still questionable, the park is bracing for 
an unprecedented onslaught of scientists looking into everything from fire 
behavior patterns to its effects on grizzly bears, fisheries, grasslands and 
the nesting status of bald eagles. "Hundreds of people are here doing 
research," said Karle. "It's like a big laboratory." 
</P>
<P>
Even local merchants, suppressing any anguish over the fire and its ultimate 
impact, are jumping on the bandwagon. Colorful souvenir books detailing the 
fires in words and pictures are big sellers at curio shops both in the park and 
gateway communities. Another hot item: videos. "Yellowstone -- The Place Where 
Hell Bubbled Up," comes in both 90-minute deluxe and 30-minute highlight 
packages as well as a Japanese narrative version. 
</P>
<P>
Yellowstone officials are making no apologies for their handling of the fires, 
which they contend was not only ecologically sound but also in concert with 
then existing park service regulations. Circling the wagons against critics, 
they insist that the uncertainty and furor raised by what happened here 
resulted largely from media accounts that sometimes wildly exaggerated the 
extent of the blazes and their impact. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no ecological downside to the fires," Barbee said recently. " . . . 
The media, in my opinion, went into a frenzy. They outdid themselves with 
hyperbole." 
</P>
<P>
Whether coverage was fair or not, the media's impact on heightening awareness 
of the situation was clearly considerable. The blazes were probably the first 
major wildfire covered on television by live hourly updates emanating from 
satellite trucks in the middle of a forest. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan's reservations aside, an internal government review has largely backed up 
the approach taken by Barbee and other park officials in dealing with the 
fires. But it did fault the park service for a haphazard public relations job 
that fueled confusion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Natural, Beneficial 
</P>
<P>
Another major post-fire study, this one conducted by a panel of experts from 
several major universities, has yet to be released. However, the chairman of 
the panel, Duke University botanist Norman L. Christensen, told a congressional 
hearing last January that he considered the fires to be both natural and 
beneficial to the Yellowstone environment. 
</P>
<P>
"Ecologists are in total agreement that wildfires were a natural part of the 
primeval North American landscape," Christensen testified. " . . . Although 
less frequent, fires approaching the size of those in 1988 occurred in the 
1700s and probably occurred at 200- to 300- year intervals through the Western 
mountains over the past 10,000 years." 
</P>
<P>
Christensen said that there is ample evidence that such fires kill few animals 
and ultimately improve their habitat by promoting the growth of plants and 
shrubs that could not thrive in the gloom of a thick forest. 
</P>

REFORESTATION IN YELLOWSTONE 
</P>
<P>
About 80% of the trees burned in the greater Yellowstone Park fires were 
lodgepole pines, a tree that is self-pruning. Branches below the productive 
region of the crown (upper 8 to 10 feet) die and fall off as the tree grows. 
Here is how reforestation process takes place after logging or a fire: 
</P>
<P>
Stage 1- Lodgepole pine saplings grow in stands before forming canopy (up to 40 
years after a fire). 
</P>
<P>
Stage 2- Closed canopy of even-aged, usually dense young trees (40 to 100 
years). 
</P>
<P>
Stage 3- Lodgepole pines dominate, canopy largely intact. Some spruce and fir 
below (100 to 300 years. 
</P>
<P>
Stage 4-Canopy quite ragged. Undergrowth includes spruce, fir and white-bark 
pine (over 300 years). 
</P>
<P>
Stage 5- Canopy, dominated by over-mature lodgepole pines, beginning to break 
up (over 300 years).

EAGERNESS TO 'MAKE' GUN CITED IN LAPD LAB ERROR

<TEXT>
<P>
Little more than 12 hours after Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Rickey Ross 
was picked up by Los Angeles police in the company of a prostitute on Feb. 23, 
Detective Jimmy Trahin, an examiner in the Police Department's firearms 
laboratory, wrote a half-page report concluding that Ross' revolver had fired 
the bullets that killed three prostitutes last year. 
</P>
<P>
Trahin, an LAPD veteran of 19 years who has trained numerous police officers in 
the tedious specialty of weapons and ammunition analysis, left no room for 
doubt. 
</P>
<P>
When he wrote that test bullets fired from Ross' gun were "positive" matches to 
the bullets that killed the prostitutes, he underlined positive. The fatal 
shots, he added, could have been fired only by Ross' 9-millimeter Smith &amp; 
Wesson "and no other weapon." 
</P>
<P>
Eleven weeks later, in the same lab building, Trahin sat silently as 
prosecutors and defense lawyers listened to two of the nation's most respected 
firearms inspectors explain why he had been wrong, why there were obvious 
differences between the tiny scratches and chips found on ammunition fragments 
he had matched. 
</P>
<P>
Three days after that -- last Monday -- Rickey Ross was out of jail. By Friday 
the Los Angeles County district attorney's office had announced that it would 
begin using private firearms examiners to double-check results of the LAPD lab 
and in some cases bypass the lab entirely. 
</P>
<P>
A reconstruction of the investigation offers two key lessons. 
</P>
<P>
One, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. William Hodgman, who remains philosophical 
in the wake of defeat, is that firearms examination is at times more art than 
science. 
</P>
<P>
The other lesson, according to some critics, is that the cockiness of some 
examiners in the LAPD firearms investigation unit periodically leads to gross 
mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
Department spokesmen and Trahin have declined to comment, citing the 
department's review of firearms lab practices. 
</P>
<P>
The Ross case was the third high-profile murder case since 1984 in which LAPD 
firearms experts were forced to admit that they had made an incorrect analysis. 
</P>
<P>
"The reputation of the LAPD lab has always suffered" because of such incidents, 
said Robert Joling, a Wisconsin lawyer and past president of the American 
Academy of Forensic Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Asking Right Question 
</P>
<P>
Even before the Ross affair, LAPD was in the process of trying to replace sworn 
officers with civilians in its firearms lab, officials said. Charles Morton, an 
outside forensics expert who conducted the tests that would begin unraveling 
the Ross case, said the distinction is important because different qualities 
are required of scientists than of police officers, who are trained to make 
extremely quick decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"Too often they get caught up in doing the work of the prosecution," Morton 
said of the police experts. "They don't ask, 'Is there anything that excludes 
this guy?' " 
</P>
<P>
Police were under intense public scrutiny when they arrested Ross. They had 
investigated the killings of 69 prostitutes and the "street murders" of 30 
other women in the previous four years with only one conviction. At a Police 
Commission meeting the night before Ross' arrest, members of the Black 
Coalition Fighting Back Serial Murders protested what they claimed was a lack 
of police concern. 
</P>
<P>
In South-Central Los Angeles at 1:30 a.m. on Feb. 23, two officers stopped a 
car that was moving erratically. Inside they found Ross, who they thought was 
drunk, and a prostitute. A Pepsi can that had been used as a "crack" cocaine 
pipe was tossed out of one of the car's windows, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The confluence of facts was intriguing: Ross was in the area where the killings 
had occurred. Officers were on the alert for a 9-millimeter pistol because 
previous tests on the bullets that killed three of the prostitutes -- Judith 
Simpson, Cynthia Walker and Latanya Johnson -- determined that the same kind of 
weapon had been used in each case. When they searched Ross' trunk, police found 
that type of gun. 
</P>
<P>
Within a few hours -- as little as 90 minutes according to one account -- 
Trahin concluded that Ross' handgun had fired the three shots that killed the 
prostitutes. That was the clincher. 
</P>
<P>
In bringing the circumstantial murder case against the 40-year-old sheriff's 
narcotics investigator, prosecutors, as they often do, put their faith in 
police expertise. In this case, they were trusting tests conducted under 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fast Work Demanded 
</P>
<P>
One senior police officer said homicide investigators were telling the firearms 
experts, ' "Get in there and do a comparison. . . . We need it now, we need it 
now.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hours later Ross was booked as a murder suspect. 
</P>
<P>
As they prepared for his arraignment, Ross' court-appointed attorneys seemed 
ready to accept Trahin's findings. Even if the murder weapon was in their 
client's car, they noted in what appeared to be a rather desperate posture, 
prosecutors would still have to prove he pulled the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose I was like the average citizen," said co-counsel Guy O'Brien. "They 
said it was a match, I thought it was like a fingerprint." 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing where the defense sought an arraignment delay, a deputy district 
attorney named Harvey Giss appeared as a fill-in representative of the 
prosecution. Three years ago Giss had been burned by a faulty LAPD gun match at 
the trial of James Hawkins Jr., accused of killing two alleged drug dealers. 
Hawkins had been convicted despite the mistake, but the uproar caused the LAPD 
to add a backup inspector to each case. 
</P>
<P>
Giss assumed it couldn't happen again. He stressed to reporters how certain 
police were of their evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, prosecutor Hodgman and LAPD homicide investigators were trying to 
find witnesses to finger Ross and back up their firearms evidence. But the best 
they could find was a man who thought he had seen a car and heard a man's voice 
at the scene of one of the prostitute killings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gun Was the Key 
</P>
<P>
The gun evidence clearly was the linchpin of the case. One day, Hodgman drove 
over to the LAPD firearms investigation unit in northeast Los Angeles to check 
it out. Looking through a special two-sample microscope that puts murder 
bullets and test bullets next to each other was a journey into foreign 
territory. He saw gross similarities, but the subtleties that supposedly "made" 
Ross' gun had to be pointed out to him. 
</P>
<P>
Although the written report reflected absolute certainty, Hodgman said, Trahin 
told him early on that there were some analytical gray areas. Nevertheless, 
"there was a sense of confidence that the LAPD firearm investigation unit had," 
the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Trahin was a pro. "Within that unit, he is the lead man, he's been an 
instructor throughout the nation," said Capt. Joe De Ladurantey, commander of 
the Harbor Division, who until two months ago was in charge of the department's 
Scientific Investigations Division, which oversees the nine-member firearms 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
But one veteran private firearms investigator who once worked for a Los Angeles 
County law enforcement agency said he was sometimes put off by Trahin's 
flippancy, a quality that other private investigators -- who spoke only on the 
condition of anonymity because they still do consulting work for LAPD -- said 
is too common in the unit. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a nickname in our profession," one specialist said, for mistakes in 
which an investigator is too quick to "make" a gun. It is "Wolferism," a 
reference to DeWayne Wolfer, a one-time LAPD criminalist who misread evidence 
in the assassination of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy in Los Angeles in 1968, even 
though the guilt of Sirhan Sirhan was never in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
When Ross' defense went searching for a firearms expert, they settled on one of 
seven specialists who were asked years later to reevaluate Wolfer's findings. 
He was Charles Morton, a private criminalist from Oakland who had subsequently 
worked on some of the country's most prominent murder trials, including those 
of Ted Bundy, Dr. Jeffrey McDonald and Atlanta's convicted child killer, Wayne 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Hodgman wasn't worried. Usually you never saw these defense examiners in court 
because they merely confirmed, to their clients' dismay, the police expert's 
"make." 
</P>
<P>
After 26 years as an expert in the laboratory testing of bullets, blood and 
other crime-scene remnants, Charles Morton had a healthy respect for the power 
-- and pitfalls -- of physical evidence. 
</P>
<P>
An old Orange County case frequently reminded him of what was at stake. 
</P>
<P>
A catering truck driver named William DePalma had been convicted of holding up 
a Buena Park savings and loan in 1968, even though the defense produced a dozen 
witnesses who swore that at the time of the robbery he was serving them lunch 
15 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
One small piece of evidence -- a fingerprint -- outweighed all the alibi 
testimony and sent DePalma to prison. A Buena Park police sergeant testified 
that he lifted the print, which clearly matched DePalma's, from the counter of 
the savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
"This type of evidence has so much weight," said Morton, who runs his own crime 
lab. "And in most cases it should be that persuasive." 
</P>
<P>
But there was one problem, which was discovered by a forensics student only 
after DePalma had spent 2 1/2 years behind bars. The Buena Park sergeant had 
fabricated the fingerprint, using a photocopy of a real print taken off the 
defendant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conviction Upset 
</P>
<P>
DePalma's conviction was overturned and the sergeant wound up in jail for 
preparing false fingerprint displays in yet another case. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years later, while Morton was analyzing the twisted and mushroomed 
bullet fragments that prompted authorities to charge Rickey Ross with murder, 
he thought again of the Buena Park scandal. There was no suggestion of fraud 
this time, but one factor seemed similar. 
</P>
<P>
"It's rare that a case is so dependent on one bit of evidence," Morton said. 
</P>
<P>
But when Morton walked into LAPD's firearms lab on April 17, he had no reason 
to suspect that the Ross evidence might be discredited. Although he sometimes 
found himself challenging police experts in court, "I have had a lot more cases 
where I agreed with them," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Trahin's report documented two types of evidence, the three bullets found in 
the prostitutes and a single shell casing, found near Cynthia Walker's body and 
presumed to come from the murder weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Trahin and his co-examiner, Officer Jim Fountain, had begun by firing nine test 
bullets from Ross' guns into a water tank. 
</P>
<P>
Morton, a 52-year-old professorial-looking man with a neat graying beard, came 
prepared to look at the evidence for himself. He greeted Trahin, who had been 
one of his students in the Department of Criminal Justice at Cal State Los 
Angeles. Trahin handed him packets of bullet fragments and stacks of 
photographs showing greatly magnified details. 
</P>
<P>
The first thing Morton examined was LAPD's analysis of the single shell casing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Discrepancies Found 
</P>
<P>
One of the clearest marks made on a shell casing is from the gun's "ejector," a 
tiny piece of metal that spits the spent shell out of the firing chamber. In 
all of the test firings of Ross' gun, Morton found, the ejector left an 
oval-shaped mark near the outside of the shell. 
</P>
<P>
On the cartridge recovered near Walker, however, the mark was narrower and near 
the inside of the shell. 
</P>
<P>
"There's something wrong," Morton said to himself. "The ejector mark is clearly 
different." 
</P>
<P>
Then he looked at the tiny impression left by the firing pin as it strikes the 
back of the shell, setting off the explosion that sends the bullet speeding 
down the barrel of the gun. 
</P>
<P>
The nine test shots police had fired from Ross' Smith &amp; Wesson left a 
telltale squiggle, made by a minute defect on the tip of the gun's firing pin. 
On the Walker shell, however, there was no such mark. 
</P>
<P>
Morton's suspicion was hardening into a conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
The LAPD report did not mention either of the discrepancies that Morton had 
noticed. Instead it linked the Smith &amp; Wesson to the Walker shell by 
matching "breechface stria," a jumble of dozens of microscopic scratches left 
on the shell. 
</P>
<P>
Morton compared the crime-scene and test shells under the microscope and 
confirmed that a few of the scratches seemed to go in the same direction. But 
many others were going in different directions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Couldn't Be the Gun 
</P>
<P>
Morton's dispute with LAPD was more than the typical experts' quarrel over the 
degree of certainty -- over how well police had proven their case. 
</P>
<P>
As he saw it, "we were looking at an exclusion." In other words, Ross' gun 
couldn't have produced the Walker cartridge. 
</P>
<P>
The analysis of the murder-scene bullets was not so clear. By broad "class 
characteristics," Ross' gun could have been the murder weapon. The number and 
slant of the grooves inside of the gun's barrel, which cause a bullet to spiral 
toward its target, were the same as those found on the slugs taken from the 
prostitutes -- "six right," in the experts' parlance. 
</P>
<P>
"But there is nothing unique about these dimensions," Morton said. "There are 
tens of thousands of these weapons made with the same characteristic." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, LAPD examiners apparently thought they had a distinct detail to 
prove the match. It was a defect line that appeared to be similar in both sets 
of bullets. 
</P>
<P>
Morton concluded that this was an illusion. 
</P>
<P>
When Trahin examined the bullets, he aligned them incorrectly under a poorly 
focused microscope, Morton said. There was not enough evidence to make a "100% 
exclusion," he said, but clearly you could not make a positive match between 
bullets and gun. 
</P>
<P>
On his second day in the LAPD lab, after confirming his findings by firing and 
examining five more test shots, Morton told the defense team that LAPD had 
blown the case. 
</P>
<P>
Eager to obtain Ross' release from jail, the lawyers asked Hodgman to come to 
the lab on April 24 and meet with Morton. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't seem really worried," Morton said. "They took the position that 
there was room for differences of opinion. But I said, 'I don't think this is 
merely a matter of differences of opinion.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hodgman told the defense he could not respond to Morton's results without 
talking to Trahin, and Trahin was in Virginia at a convention of the Assn. of 
Firearms and Toolmark Examiners, delivering a paper on the conversion of 
semi-automatic weapons into automatic ones. 
</P>
<P>
Before Trahin returned, the defense and the prosecution agreed to what was in 
effect a tie-breaker. Al Biasotti of the state Department of Justice and John 
Murdock of the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Department would come to the LAPD 
lab for several days. 
</P>
<P>
On the third day of their testing, Murdock and Biasotti told both sides they 
should meet. On May 12, the prosecution, defense and LAPD representatives 
gathered in a conference room. Before they sat down, Biasotti, carrying 
photographs and 18 pages of notes, sought out Trahin to let him know they would 
disagree with his findings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Have Been Chance 
</P>
<P>
Murdock, according to one person in attendance, "made a statement in which he 
said the main reason he wanted to call the meeting was to make sure this didn't 
happen again." 
</P>
<P>
For more than a half-hour Murdock and Biasotti explained why, in the words of 
another person in attendance, "the points of identity (between the murder 
bullets and the test bullets) that were noted by the LAPD were attributable to 
chance or random correspondence." 
</P>
<P>
The quality of equipment at LAPD also came in for criticism. Biasotti suggested 
that the evidence be re-tested at the state Department of Justice's lab in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting broke up. Several people "ran for the phone," said one observer. 
</P>
<P>
Ross' attorneys asked Hodgman and Sterling E. Norris, the head of the district 
attorney's special trials section, to drop charges immediately. The prosecutors 
said they couldn't make that decision without conferring with superiors. This 
was too hot a case. One police agency had put another's officer in jail. He'd 
sat there nearly three months. 
</P>
<P>
It was a Friday. A decision would have to wait until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prosecutors suggested to the police that they might want to look 
at the evidence again in light of Murdock's and Biasotti's criticisms. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department did. The next day it ran more tests on Ross' gun. This 
time, said Hodgman, the relationship between the test bullets and the murder 
bullets was found to be "inconclusive." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still a Suspect 
</P>
<P>
The charges would have to be dropped, even though authorities said that Ross -- 
dismissed for his conduct on the night of his arrest and for allegedly 
tampering with drug evidence -- remains a murder suspect. Ross has declined to 
be interviewed by The Times since his release. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of days later, prosecutor Harvey Giss wondered once again how to 
regard police experts. What was he supposed to do, he asked, begin hiring 
outside examiners himself? 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that upsets me and everybody else so much is that by and large LAPD 
is a first-rate organization in our minds. But a problem like this makes 
everybody sick because it tarnishes the image of the people who ID blood, hair, 
semen, saliva, fabric. They're all stigmatized." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday representatives from LAPD and the district attorney's office agreed 
on a formal request from prosecutors that they be able to selectively employ 
outside firearms examiners. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Ronald L. Soble, Hector Tobar and Tracy Wood contributed to

EVIDENCE THAT MISFIRED

The crisis now engulfing China has reached such critical proportions that even 
if the country's aging leaders manage to crush the democracy demonstrations and 
sweep student protesters from the streets, the future course of the world's 
most populous nation has almost certainly been changed. 
</P>
<P>
The forces that have come to the surface over the past week run so deep that, 
if history is any guide, the Chinese regime will not be able to keep them 
suppressed forever. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly is an upheaval of historic dimensions, and I think it will 
eventually change the dynamics of politics in China," Prof. Kenneth Lieberthal, 
director of the Center for Chinese Studies at the University of Michigan, said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past four decades, ruling leaders of the Chinese regime have several 
times cut off student protests or other demonstrations -- only to find in later 
months or years that the protests had reemerged even stronger and that leaders 
of the crackdown were themselves swept away. 
</P>
<P>
And, with the possible exception of a full-scale revolt in Tibet in 1959, none 
of these previous outbursts of protest were nearly so large or pervasive as the 
outpouring of demands for democracy that have swept the country over the past 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Although students have taken the lead in the massive democracy demonstrations, 
experts agree that they are supported by virtually every segment of the Chinese 
population and throughout nearly all regions of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic example of a crackdown that proved unsuccessful in the long 
run was in April, 1976, five months before the death of Chairman Mao Tse-tung. 
As many as 100,000 people turned out in Tian An Men Square to protest what they 
felt was the Chinese leadership's refusal to give proper respect and honors to 
the memory of former Premier Chou En-lai, who had died earlier that year. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as now, the fervor of the protesters was mingled with softer emotions 
that seem to characterize such confrontations in China -- including surprising 
concern among the demonstrators for the forces arrayed against them. Such 
sentiments stand in sharp contrast with the harsh spirit of comparable protests 
in many other countries, most notably neighboring South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1976, the regime was controlled largely by radical leaders 
such as Mao's wife, Jiang Qing. The leadership called security forces into 
Beijing to clear the square and quell the protests. By all accounts, there was 
considerable violence and, according to the initial estimates of security 
officials, more than 100 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
The brutal suppression of that protest, while initially successful, eventually 
helped lead to the downfall of some of the Chinese leaders involved in calling 
out the security forces. A month after Mao died, his wife and her allies -- 
known as the Gang of Four -- were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The more moderate leaders who rose to power after Mao's death overturned the 
Chinese Communist Party's judgment that the 1976 protests had been 
counterrevolutionary and instead concluded that they had been "completely 
revolutionary." 
</P>
<P>
"If Chairman Mao had been in good health, if he had been capable of making up 
his own mind, he would not have made such decisions," declared a new Chinese 
leader nearly three years after the suppression of the Tian An Men 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, that new Chinese leader was Deng Xiaoping, the same man who now, as 
chairman of the Communist Party's Central Military Commission, has become a 
symbol of resistance to political change and the target of student protests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Democracy Wall Protests 
</P>
<P>
In late 1978 and early 1979, a new series of demonstrations swept Beijing. 
Hundreds and sometimes thousands of young people began gathering at a site 
known as Democracy Wall, where wallposters called for human rights and 
democracy in China. 
</P>
<P>
Deng, then in the process of consolidating his control over the Chinese 
Communist Party, at first voiced some support for the Democracy Wall protests. 
But a few months later, he led a crackdown. The demonstrations were stopped, 
leaders were arrested and the right to put up wallposters was eliminated from 
the Chinese constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Wei Jingsheng, the leader of that Democracy Wall movement, was tried as a 
counterrevolutionary for allegedly giving state secrets to a foreign 
journalist. He remains in jail, but the people in the streets today -- 
numbering in the hundreds of thousands -- are his political heirs. 
</P>
<P>
Deng's willingness to suppress the Democracy Wall campaign was reminiscent of 
his successful efforts two decades earlier, with Mao, to crack down on 
intellectual freedom in China. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hundred Flowers' Movement 
</P>
<P>
In 1956, when Mao was Communist Party chairman and Deng was the party's general 
secretary, the party encouraged intellectuals to voice their opinions. "Let a 
hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," said Mao, 
quoting an old Confucian aphorism. 
</P>
<P>
The following year, astounded by the vehemence of the intellectuals' criticism 
of the Communist Party that the invitation had triggered, Mao and Deng cracked 
down. About 300,000 people were purged from the party, and thousands of 
intellectuals were jailed or exiled to the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Deng and the Chinese regime have confronted a recurring series 
of student demonstrations and have tried to cut them off. But the efforts have 
proved unsuccessful over the long run. 
</P>
<P>
The current wave of student demonstrations dates to December, 1984. At first, 
the protests were pitifully small, particularly when compared to the mass 
outpourings of the past week. 
</P>
<P>
At Beijing University, the nation's most prestigious school, several hundred 
students put up wallposters and marched at night to protest overcrowded 
conditions on campus. At another nearby university, students demonstrated to 
complain of poor food. 
</P>
<P>
The regime paid little attention until the following fall, when the student 
protests spread to Tian An Men Square and took on larger political overtones. 
Nearly a thousand students outside the Great Hall of the People denounced 
Japan's "economic invasion" of China and corruption within the party. Some of 
these demonstrators also called for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the Chinese leadership acted. The regime warned students that it 
would use tough measures against anyone who took part in another planned 
demonstration. After the protest movement subsided, a handful of student 
leaders vanished from campuses. 
</P>
<P>
Within a year, however, Chinese students were back in the streets, this time in 
much greater force and focusing more directly on the cause of democracy. In 
December, 1986, protesters at a small university in Hefei, encouraged by a 
school administrator named Fang Lizhi, took to the streets to protest efforts 
by party officials to exclude non-approved candidates from an election. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the protests for democracy spread. In Shanghai, tens of thousands of 
students took to the streets. In Beijing, students staged a midnight march to 
Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
The crackdown began in January, 1987, when the Chinese Communist Party launched 
a campaign against "bourgeois liberalization." Communist Party General 
Secretary Hu Yaobang and his propaganda chief were ousted from their jobs, and 
three leading intellectuals, including Fang Lizhi, were expelled from the 
Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
For a time, the crackdown worked. But in April, triggered by the death of Hu, 
students took to the streets again, this time in far larger numbers and with 
the support of workers and others in China.

LONDON AND MOSCOW SWAP EXPULSIONS;

<P>
BRITISH QUIETLY ORDER 11 TO LEAVE FOR SPYING; KREMLIN RETALIATES

Britain and the Soviet Union locked diplomatic horns over the weekend, with 
Britain expelling or declaring persona non grata 11 Soviet citizens who were 
apparently caught spying and the Soviets responding with tit-for-tat 
expulsions, the British ambassador disclosed here Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet retaliation was out of step with improving British-Soviet ties, 
Ambassador Rodric Braithwaite told a news conference. "This is a mirror-image 
act of retaliation with no objective justification," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not think this is in accordance with the way the relationship has been 
developing between the two countries, and we have no desire that it should 
affect wider political relations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev paid a three-day visit to Britain last 
month, holding talks with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and lunching with 
Queen Elizabeth II, who accepted in principle an invitation to visit the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Britain's Foreign Office summoned the Soviet ambassador in London to 
inform him that five Soviet government officials and three Soviet journalists 
had to leave the country within two weeks and that three other Soviet 
government officials who already had left the country were declared persona non 
grata. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Euphemism for Spying 
</P>
<P>
All 11 were accused of "activities incompatible with their status," which is 
generally diplomatic language for spying. Britain's ITN radio reported that the 
Soviets were caught spying on military installations. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides ordered those expelled to leave within 14 days. 
</P>
<P>
London chose not to publicize word of the expulsions. It went public only after 
the British ambassador was summoned to the Foreign Ministry in Moscow late 
Saturday night and told that eight Britons were being expelled, including three 
journalists, and that three diplomats who had already left the country were 
being declared persona non grata. 
</P>
<P>
British officials here privately expressed surprise and disappointment with the 
Soviet response. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a generally productive relationship with the Soviet Union. We had 
hoped the inconveniences caused by unofficial behavior in London that led to 
the expulsions there were behind us. This was unfortunately not the case," one 
British official said here in an interview, asking that his name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Unjustified Retaliation' 
</P>
<P>
"The way we chose to handle it -- without publicity -- was in part a signal 
that we wanted to continue the positive part of our dialogue," the official 
said. "The unjustified retaliation shows that some people in the Soviet 
government do not have that positive attitude toward our relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Braithwaite identified the three journalists ordered to leave as Angus Roxburgh 
of the Sunday Times, Ian Glover-James of Independent Television News and Jeremy 
Harris of the British Broadcasting Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The eight diplomats were identified as second secretaries Michael Anderson and 
Adam Noble, third secretary Paul Sharp, naval attache Capt. Christopher Meyer, 
assistant naval attache Lt. Christopher Watson, assistant military attache 
Nigel Shakespeare, vice-consul Helen Pickering and Warrant Officer Laing 
Purfit. 
</P>
<P>
"The country is going through some very exciting changes, and I am very 
disappointed that my assignment should end like this," Glover-James, 41, said. 
</P>
<P>
Roxburgh, who first came to the Soviet Union as a student 10 years ago, said he 
was stunned when told Sunday that we was being expelled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Feel Very Close to It' 
</P>
<P>
"The reason I feel so sad about it is that I am 35 years old and I have spent 
half my life studying Russian and the Soviet Union. I feel very close to it," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets ordered to leave London were not identified. 
</P>
<P>
Recent expulsions of Soviet diplomats from Western countries -- for instance 
when the United States expelled a Soviet military attache in March -- have 
resulted in immediate expulsions of the same number and rank of diplomatic 
representatives from Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The latest expulsions are the first of their kind since the Soviet Union and 
Britain expelled 31 of each other's citizens in two groups in 1985. The 
deportations then began when London ordered 25 Soviet embassy staff members, 
journalists and trade officials to leave after the defection of an alleged 
Soviet spy chief, Oleg Gordievsky. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union then ordered 25 Britons to leave Moscow, London expelled six 
more Soviets and Moscow ordered six more Britons to leave before the expulsion 
war was over.

ALFONSIN OKS EARLY EXIT AS ARGENTINE PRESIDENT

<P>
In the face of a devastating economic crisis, President Raul Alfonsin agreed 
Sunday to move up the inauguration of his Peronist successor rather than 
stagger through a seven-month transition. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Alfonsin's incumbent Radical Civic Union and advisers to 
President-elect Carlos Saul Menem are negotiating legal changes so that 
Alfonsin's term would conclude early, probably July 9 -- Argentina's 
independence day -- instead of Dec. 10 as scheduled, officials from the two 
parties said. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement Sunday, Alfonsin did not mention a date, saying merely that 
negotiators from the two parties were working out a formal accord to allow 
Menem to assume office "in the near future." 
</P>
<P>
Early today, Radical party leaders said that the talks with the Peronists had 
not yet produced a date for the transfer of power. In a statement, they 
stressed that the party had not asked for the early transition, but wanted to 
show "maturity and patriotism" in coping with the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bitter End 
</P>
<P>
Handing over power prematurely would be a bitter end to Alfonsin's term, which 
brought a consolidation of civil liberties in Argentina but also saw the onset 
of an economic nightmare that ensured Menem's landslide victory May 14 over the 
Radicals' candidate, Eduardo Cesar Angeloz. 
</P>
<P>
The Radicals have seemed incapable of providing direction to the economy in 
recent weeks. Workers' buying power has vanished in a cloud of inflation, and 
some consumer goods and medicines are scarce because suppliers cannot set 
realistic prices. Foreign lenders won't provide fresh loans because the 
government is $3 billion in arrears on its $60-billion debt. 
</P>
<P>
The crisis led the parties to agree to shorten the transition to calm the 
current chaos in financial markets stemming from uncertainty over the long 
interregnum. The dollar shot up by nearly 70% in the week since Menem's 
victory, further fueling inflation expected to reach 50% for May alone. 
</P>
<P>
The plan would require the provincial electoral colleges to meet quickly and 
designate Menem as president -- a formality since he won a majority of 
electoral college votes -- and to have Congress adopt a law changing the 
inauguration date. The electoral college had been scheduled to meet Aug. 10. 
Alfonsin thus would not formally be resigning but merely concluding a shortened 
term. 
</P>
<P>
Alfonsin, 62, took office in 1983 after his own landslide victory following a 
seven-year military dictatorship. The constitutional transition from one 
elected president to another will be the first in Argentina in 61 years, and 
all parties are determined to maintain the constitutional order. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as Friday, both Menem and Alfonsin insisted that the inauguration 
take place as scheduled Dec. 10.

Deposed Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos, clinging to life after

Honolulu hospital but was still listed in extremely critical condition, 
hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos, 71 -- exiled here with his family since February, 1986 -- is more alert 
and communicative, said a hospital spokesman, but the prognosis is still poor

AQUINO'S VICE PRESIDENT WILL HEAD OPPOSITION PARTY

<P>
President Corazon Aquino's adversarial vice president, Salvador Laurel, on 
Sunday was elected head of the Philippines' main opposition party. 
</P>
<P>
In a national convention, the Nacionalista party also elected two former top 
aides of deposed President Ferdinand E. Marcos to the party's next two most 
powerful positions. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Ponce Enrile, a former defense minister, was chosen secretary general, 
while former Labor Minister Blas Ople was elected executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
The platform of the party, which is holding its first convention since it 
became inactive during the martial-law years in the 1970s, proposed the gradual 
dismantling of key U.S. military bases in the Philippines when their lease 
expires in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Laurel, who broke with Aquino in September, 1987, over the president's handling 
of a 20-year-old Communist insurgency, was unanimously elected party president. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to 1,000 cheering delegates, Laurel called the Aquino 
administration "the most incompetent this nation has ever had." 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot remain a nation divided, a nation wracked by insurgency and 
lawlessness. . . ," he said. "The government goes not govern. The leader does 
not lead." 
</P>
<P>
Both Laurel and Enrile are considered leading candidates for the 1992 
presidential election. Aquino has said she has no plans to seek reelection when 
her six-year term expires. 
</P>
<P>
The 81-year-old Nacionalista party, the country's oldest political grouping, 
was the party that brought Marcos to power in the 1965 presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
It disintegrated in 1972 when Marcos declared martial law and formed his own 
New Society Movement. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Sunday, Enrile said the ailing Marcos should be allowed 
to return to his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino has banned Marcos from returning -- dead or alive -- because she fears 
he would destabilize the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos, 71, is in critical condition in a Honolulu hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason why he should be deprived of his right to come home at this 
time of his life," Enrile said. "He is so ill. How can he destabilize the 
country?" Laurel echoed Enrile's sentiments.

Yugoslavia announced it will lift a dusk-to-dawn curfew but maintain a ban on 
gatherings in Kosovo province, eight weeks after 24 people were killed in 
ethnic rioting. A government official in Belgrade said the decision proves that 
the situation in the southeastern province -- where about 1.8 million ethnic 
Albanians outnumber about 200,000 Serbs -- "is gradually getting back to 
normal." However, Yugoslav troops and tanks, along with federal police forces, 
sent to Kosovo late in February, have remained in the province.

40,000 ABORTION FOES RALLY IN ST. LOUIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 40,000 people rallied in downtown St. Louis to urge the reversal of Roe 
vs. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion. Those at the 
"Show-Me Life" rally, held at the Old Court House and organized by the Missouri 
Citizens for Life, carried placards, banners, posters and balloons marked with 
anti-abortion slogans. The crowd heard an address by Sen. John C. Danforth 
(R-Mo.), who said that the high court either should overturn the 1973 decision 
or modify it so Congress can settle the controversial issue. Danforth compared 
the rally to the pro-democracy demonstrations at Beijing's Tian An Men Square. 
"The winds of change are blowing halfway around the world, and they are blowing 
here today," the senator said.

A small U.S. plane used in the anti-drug effort in Peru crashed in the Andes 
mountains, killing the six Americans and three Peruvians aboard, officials 
said. U.S. Embassy spokesman Charles Loveridge said the plane went down 
Saturday, after it left the town of Tingo Maria. The dead Americans included 
Drug Enforcement Administration agent Rick Finley, 36, of Ft. Knox, Ky., two 
helicopter pilots, the plane's pilot, a mechanic and an embassy security 
officer. The Peruvians included a police captain, the son of a police commander 
and the chief of the U.S.-funded coca eradication program. The cause of the 
crash, in the Upper Huallaga valley region notorious as a source of the coca 
leaf, was not known.

Israeli troops carried out the biggest single roundup of Palestinians during 
the 17-month-old uprising in the occupied territories, arresting 250 activists 
of Hamas, a Muslim fundamentalist movement. The group's spritual leader, Sheik 
Ahmed Yassin, was among those detained in the raid, designed to cut the level 
of violence in the Gaza Strip. The army accused Yassin, 51 and confined to a 
wheelchair, of ordering anti-Israeli activities, including the killing of 
Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel. Hamas, Arabic for "zeal," 
is considered the strongest movement in the Gaza Strip.

Lebanon's rival leaders united in pleading with the Arab League to save their 
country from destruction even though they remain as divided as ever on a 
solution to the crisis. Acting Premier Salim Hoss, a Sunni Muslim, said in a 
memorandum to the league -- which starts its summit Tuesday in Morocco -- that 
the solution lies in reforms giving Muslims, unofficially estimated to form a 
majority of Lebanon's 3.5 million people, an equal share in power with 
Christians before the election of a new president. But the rival Christian-led 
administration of Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun insists on the withdrawal of all 
foreign troops as a main condition of any political settlement. Syria maintains 
about 40,000 troops in Lebanon.

Three West German relief workers left Lebanon, five days after two of their 
colleagues were kidnaped. Witnesses said the three, from the ASME-Humanitas 
agency that helps Palestinian refugees, left the southern port of Sidon by 
launch to board a ship sailing for Cyprus. Markus Quint, one of the three, was 
kidnaped May 4 and held for 10 days before being freed. Palestinian sources 
said the two West Germans still being held, Heinrich Struebig and Thomas 
Kempner, could be used as bargaining chips in a bid to gain the release of 
Mohammed Ali Hamadi, a Lebanese sentenced to a life term in Frankfurt for 
murder and air piracy in the 1985 hijacking of a U.S. airliner.

A twin-engine plane carrying a U.S. drug agent and Peruvian police officers 
crashed in the Andes, killing all nine people aboard, six of them Americans, 
U.S. and Peruvian officials said. U.S. Embassy spokesman Charles Loveridge said 
the Cessna, owned by the State Department and on a routine reconnaissance 
flight, went down Saturday, soon after leaving the jungle town of Tingo Maria. 
He said the wreckage was spotted Sunday near Huanuco, northeast of Lima, and 
that a U.S. team was en route to the site. He said that of the six Americans, 
one was a Drug Enforcement Administration agent, one worked for the State 
Department and four were contract pilots. One of the Peruvians aboard was the 
chief of the U.S.-funded coca eradication program.

A California condor chick was coaxed from its egg at the San Diego Wild Animal 
Park -- the third successful hatching this year in a captive breeding program 
aimed at saving the giant vulture from extinction. The chick named Kaduku was 
the first conceived by a pair of birds at the Los Angeles Zoo and changed 
biologists' notions about when condors reach sexual maturity, said animal park

The daughter of artist Willem de Kooning, who is said to have Alzheimer's 
disease, asked a court in New York to declare him mentally incompetent to 
manage property worth up to $150 million, according to ARTnews magazine. De 
Kooning, 85, whose "Pink Lady" sold at a Sotheby's auction last year for $3.6 
million, lives in East Hampton on Long Island, and continues to paint daily 
with the violent, slashing strokes that have earned him fame as one of 
America's most prominent living artists. His daughter, Lisa, and his attorney, 
John Eastman, have filed a petition in state court in Mineola requesting they 
be named co-conservators of the artist's assets, the magazine reported.

A major storm forced the Air Force to postpone the launch of an advanced 
navigation satellite for a second time at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station 
in Florida. The launch of the Delta 2 rocket was rescheduled for Tuesday at 
4:43 p.m. PDT. Lt. Col. Ron Rand, an Air Force spokesman, said: "There is a 
thunderstorm, an anvil cloud and lightning within five miles of the launch pad. 
The lightning requires a shutdown of the rocket guidance computer." The launch 
was first postponed Saturday night because of strong winds. The $65-million 
satellite will enable military units to determine their location within 50 feet 
anywhere on the globe.

RIDING AND CARING FOR HORSES A KEY PART OF CURRICULUM

The way they see it at Thacher School, a kid can learn a lot about himself by 
shoveling manure at dawn. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1889, every student at this exclusive college-preparatory boarding school 
has been assigned his own horse to care for -- a commitment that includes 
feeding the steed, learning to ride and cleaning up the barn. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it makes us a lot less pretentious," said headmaster Willard G. Wyman. 
"Shoveling . . . in the morning keeps a lot of manure from being shoveled in 
the English papers in the afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 graduates gathered this weekend to celebrate that earthy 
philosophy as Thacher marked the 100th anniversary of its founding on an old 
Ojai orange ranch 85 miles northwest of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, those imbued with Thacher's unique brand of horse sense have 
included oilman Howard Hughes, playwright Thornton Wilder, "Mutiny on the 
Bounty" author Charles Nordhoff and the offspring of such familiar Western 
surnames as Livermore, Mudd, Chandler and Bechtel. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the oldest private boarding school this side of the Mississippi River, 
Thacher continues to mix character-building equine tasks with a college prep 
program that routinely propels many of its 227 students into the Ivy League. 
</P>
<P>
"The principles that my father believed in . . . a kind of puritanism, hard 
work, self-denial . . . haven't changed," said headmaster emeritus Anson S. 
Thacher, 84, the son of founder Sherman Day Thacher. "They may be 
old-fashioned, but they're sound." 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, at the school's 400-acre campus perched on a scenic plateau at the 
base of Los Padres National Forest, the emphasis was on displaying those 
qualities. 
</P>
<P>
With alumni dating back to the class of '20 on hand, the current crop of 
teen-age students treated the crowd to a gymkhana demonstration, a show of 
horseback skill that traces its roots to the cavalry drills practiced during 
the Spanish-American War. 
</P>
<P>
The competition, which Thacher students have been enjoying for nearly a 
century, includes relays, precision riding and tricks, such as speeding past a 
silver dollar and snatching it off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We're So Sheltered' 
</P>
<P>
"This teaches you discipline," said Toby Rosenblatt, class of '56, a financial 
consultant and, until recently, chairman of the San Francisco Planning 
Commission. "This takes you away from thinking you're the most important thing 
in the world." 
</P>
<P>
It is a discipline won hard. Not every student fully appreciates early-morning 
shoveling. Nor do they all value the school's other regulations, which include 
mandatory 6:30 a.m. breakfasts, dorm room inspections and no television, 
Walkmans, or long hair and earrings on boys. 
</P>
<P>
Other students, noting the heavy percentage of white, upper-middle-class 
teen-agers who pay $14,350 a year to attend the isolated campus, sometimes fret 
that such an environment isn't adequately preparing them for the realities of 
urban life. 
</P>
<P>
"We're so sheltered here," said senior April Taylor, 17, from Los Angeles. "A 
lot of kids are concerned because they know in the outside world it's going to 
be totally different." 
</P>
<P>
But many say that Thacher School has instilled in them a new-found confidence, 
a sense of self-reliance that only four years of high-powered academics mixed 
with horsemanship could bring. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'More in Charge of Myself' 
</P>
<P>
"Being here has made me more in charge of myself," said senior Rob Morrill, 19, 
from San Francisco. "You have to be more responsible for your life." 
</P>
<P>
That's just what Sherman Thacher -- a man fond of saying "there's something 
about the outside of a horse that's good for the inside of a boy" -- would have 
wanted to hear. 
</P>
<P>
A Yale-educated lawyer, Thacher came west in 1887 at the age of 25 to bring his 
sickly brother to the warm, dry Ojai valley. When his brother died a short 
while later, the Connecticut man decided to stay and raise oranges. 
</P>
<P>
But when, in 1889, Thacher agreed to take on a friend's nephew for a year of 
academic and outdoors instruction, a different kind of seed was planted. By 
1891, there were five students; by 1900, 45. 
</P>
<P>
In those days, of course, owning a horse was a necessity. Students had to ride 
the five-mile trek into Ojai every day just to pick up the mail. The church in 
town allowed the boys to attend services in cowboy boots because it was unsafe 
to ride in dress shoes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'First Control Yourself' 
</P>
<P>
With the advent of the automobile, however, maintaining the equestrian program 
became more of a conscious effort to use horses as nonverbal teachers. The 
animals, administrators note, are at once dependent on their young caretakers 
and always capable of overpowering them. 
</P>
<P>
"Fundamentally what it comes down to is that you can't control a horse unless 
you first control yourself," said Anson Thacher, who retired from the school in 
1970. 
</P>
<P>
While the school's commitment to academic rigor and personal responsibility has 
been altered little over the years, the Thacher administration has adjusted 
some policies to reflect the changing times. 
</P>
<P>
Where once students were required to care for a horse all four years, the 
program is now mandatory only for freshman. Women, who were excluded from the 
school until 1977, now compose half the student body. 
</P>
<P>
And, in an effort to promote diversity at the school, Thacher has launched a 
fund-raising drive to expand from 20% the number of students who receive 
scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Wyman, the school's headmaster, is quick to caution that Thacher will 
always remain something of a dinosaur in the Computer Age, relying on the 
wisdom of four-legged animals as the antidote to dehumanizing, high-tech 
trends. 
</P>
<P>
"We're square here," Wyman said. "We try to be different. There's nothing cool 
about getting up at 6 in the morning to rake a corral."

MEXICAN REFORM WILL GIVE U.S. INVESTORS A NEW LEASE ON LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every few months, Russell W. Bogda likes to escape Los Angeles and relax in his 
vacation home 100 miles south of the border. 
</P>
<P>
But the Mexican government has welcomed the Los Angeles attorney only up to a 
point. Like all non-Mexicans, he was not allowed to own his property near the 
coast; he could control it for only 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
That changed dramatically last week, however, when Mexico announced a sweeping 
relaxation of restrictions on foreign investment. As a result, some California 
investors foresee a sharply rising U.S. stake in Mexican hotels, resort 
complexes, villas, condominiums and other tourist properties. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, you want to look at the fine print, but I think it will make more 
people interested and willing to consider investments in Mexico," Bogda said of 
the new rules. "That's why I was excited." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
100% Foreign Ownership 
</P>
<P>
Under the far-reaching changes, Americans who seek resort homes in Mexico no 
longer will have to relinquish them after 30 years. A Mexican bank will 
continue to have ownership through a trust -- but at the end of 30 years, the 
foreigner's control will be extended for another 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Mexico is for the first time allowing 100% foreign ownership of 
Mexican corporations in tourism and certain other industries. Previously, 
foreigners were restricted to owning less than half of Mexican enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
"If I can go down and build a four-unit condo on the beach and deal with a 
60-year trust and not have to have a Mexican partner, I'll be more inclined to 
do it. I think it's a positive sign," Bogda added. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico's incentive is no secret: The rule changes are designed to ease its 
foreign debt burden, estimated at $108 billion. Tourism is considered an 
especially effective tool to combat debt because it draws hard currency. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Mexico's tourism industry has been far smaller than that of nations in 
Western Europe, for example, "even though it (Mexico) has a giant country like 
the United States and also Canada in close proximity," said David G. Ellsworth, 
a Los Angeles attorney whose clients include foreign developers in Mexico and 
Mexico's tourist development and finance agency. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Hank Gonzalez, the nation's secretary of tourism, has reportedly said 
that Mexico seeks to double its income from tourism between 1988 and 1994 to $5 
billion, and expects 50,000 new hotel rooms to be built in that time. 
</P>
<P>
Now some believe the changing rules may help usher in some of the development 
that the debt-ridden nation seeks. 
</P>
<P>
"This obviously makes a very, very big difference," said Don Gandy, a San Diego 
consultant who has worked with several developments proposed for Mexico. "More 
than anything, it indicates a change in philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
Under the old philosophy, for example, foreign investors had trouble gaining 
long-term financing for projects, in part because they were limited to minority 
ownership. 
</P>
<P>
"Now a U.S. or Japanese developer can go down to Mexico and set up their own 
company without having to find a Mexican partner or get approval from a 
national commission -- and own 100% of the company," said Ellsworth. 
</P>
<P>
He continued: "The lender's going to look at it (Mexican development) much more 
favorably." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Climate Was Improving 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the 30-year restriction on control applied not just to choice 
oceanfront property but to a sprawling band of territory known as the 
"forbidden zone," stretching 32 miles inland from the coastline and 64 miles 
from Mexico's borders. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year limit "has been a hindrance on developers going into Mexico to do 
projects and individuals going into Mexico to buy projects," Ellsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the announcement, the foreign investment climate in Mexico seemed 
to be improving in light of Mexican officials' friendlier attitude. For 
instance, the stage is being set for rapid growth in Northern Baja, between 
Tijuana and Ensenada. 
</P>
<P>
"If you drive up and down the coast, you can see dirt being moved on eight to 
10 smaller projects," said Gandy, adding that "Within the last year, 
practically every piece of vacant usable land on the water has been put in 
position for development."

Wage, Price Controls Extended: Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will 
extend wage and price controls beyond the July 31 expiration date, newspapers 
said. Salinas said the controls must remain in force to ensure improved living 
standards for workers. The controls went into effect in February, 1988, after 
prices soared 159.2% in 1987. Inflation was reduced to 51.7% last year. Under 
an agreement, the government pledged to curb spending, labor to hold down wage 
demands and business to freeze prices.

FLORIDA MAY TAP PENSION TO AID EASTERN BUYOUT

Florida Gov. Bob Martinez is considering whether to use $50 million from the 
state employees' pension fund as loan money to facilitate a buyout of bankrupt 
Eastern Airlines, a published report said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez is exploring the option as one way to preserve jobs in Florida, the 
Miami Herald reported. Eastern, which is based in Miami, traditionally has been 
one of south Florida's largest private employers. 
</P>
<P>
But the loan will be made only if the deal represents a sound investment for 
the state's pension holders, the governor's chief of operations, Brian Ballard, 
told the Herald. 
</P>
<P>
Ballard met Friday in New York with representatives of the pilots union at 
Eastern, the newspaper said. Talks were expected to continue this week. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Line Pilots Assn. has backed a buyout of Eastern as the best way to 
resolve the airline's current crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern, formerly the nation's seventh largest airline, was forced to suspend 
all but about 10% of its flights, lay off 9,500 workers and file for bankruptcy 
after its pilots and ground workers walked off the job March 4. 
</P>
<P>
Two separate investor groups have submitted proposals to purchase Eastern, but 
both have been criticized by bankruptcy examiner David Shapiro for not 
committing sufficient resources to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
One group is led by former Piedmont Airlines Chairman William Howard, while the 
other group is led by Chicago options trader Joseph Ritchie. The state plan 
under consideration is not linked to either bidder. 
</P>
<P>
The pilots union first proposed the state loan, the Herald said.

Mortgage Rates Fall: Rates for 30-year, fixed mortgages fell 0.24 percentage 
points and adjustable-rate mortgages fell 0.08 percentage points, the Federal 
Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said. The agency, which buys mortgages from lenders 
and packages them as securities for sale to investors, said interest on 
fixed-rate loans fell to 10.69% last week, down from 10.93% the week before. 
Adjustable-rate mortgages fell to 9.28%, down from 9.36%, the agency said.

ABANDONING THE BOX; 
</P>
<P>
TODAY'S EXECUTIVES ARE LIGHTENING THEIR LOADS WITH SOFTER, FLEXIBLE PORTFOLIOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Wolf, vice chairman of the Los Angeles advertising agency Chiat/Day, 
used to go to business meetings toting a conventional hard-sided briefcase. But 
today he uses a lightweight $300 canvas and leather case to carry his papers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more flexible," Wolf explained. "You can get more stuff into it. I carry 
mostly papers from work, but I also carry a dictating machine and a 
calculator." The case is "light and it has a shoulder strap, which is a real 
advantage over a leather briefcase when you are running through airports trying 
to catch a plane." 
</P>
<P>
One of the country's most celebrated deal makers, real estate magnate Donald J. 
Trump of New York, summed up the current attitude toward briefcases in his 
autobiography: "I play it very loose. I don't carry a briefcase." 
</P>
<P>
Across the country these are tough times for traditional "business cases," a 
category that includes the soft accordion-like rectangular leather briefcases 
used by many lawyers, extremely wide "catalogue cases" used by salesmen as well 
as the slender, strongbox-like attache case favored by many tradition-minded 
business executives. 
</P>
<P>
A cooling off of the nation's seven-year-long economic expansion, an explosion 
of new business technology such as portable computers and cellular telephones, 
as well as the rising number of women executives who prefer lighter-weight 
portfolios, have combined to erode the status and utility of familiar 
leather-bound business cases, once used chiefly to shuttle papers and lunch 
from home to office. 
</P>
<P>
"In the business world, the attache case is not the status symbol it once was," 
said John T. Molloy, a management consultant and author of the book "Dress for 
Success." 
</P>
<P>
"Many top executives don't even carry briefcases any more," Molloy continued. 
"If they carry anything, they carry a small leather (portfolio)." 
</P>
<P>
It's not just top executives that are forgoing briefcases, however. Many 
younger middle mangers -- unconstrained by tradition -- are opting for 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Revenue Up Slightly 
</P>
<P>
During the past three years, when unit sales of other hand luggage rose 9% to 
86.7 million, unit sales of business cases -- which includes the soft-sided 
canvas-type carried by Wolf -- have remained at about 11.4 million, said Robert 
K. Ermatinger, executive vice president of Luggage &amp; Leather Goods 
Manufacturers of America Inc., a private industry trade group in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Wholesale revenue from business cases climbed only slightly last year to $646 
million from $615 million in 1987, according to the trade group. And with 
businesses paring their work forces of executives these days in an attempt to 
run leaner and more competitive, sales might grow even more sluggish. 
</P>
<P>
"As the economy goes, so goes the sale of business cases," said Herbert 
Schlesinger, vice president of Berlin, N.J.-based Schlesinger Co., a leading 
American manufacturer of leather briefcases. 
</P>
<P>
From the late 1970s to 1988 the industry was blessed with a combination "of 
status-conscious yuppies . . . and a booming business expansion," Schlesinger 
explained. But today, he said, "the market is saturated" with business cases. 
</P>
<P>
The industry has not stood still in the face of these challenges. 
</P>
<P>
Although the traditional briefcase market still accounts for the bulk of sales, 
manufacturers are scrambling to offer variations on the theme. Consumers can 
buy everything from a $10,000 James Bond-like briefcase with eavesdropping 
devices offered by CCS Communication Control Corp. of New York, to canvas 
carrying cases and oversized portfolios with shoulder straps. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even in the traditional market of standard 18-by-12-by-4-inch briefcases, 
there has been a proliferation of new materials and designs. 
</P>
<P>
At the exotic end of the scale are elephant and alligator cases that cost 
upward of $1,500. More typical are $80 to $400 black, brown or burgundy leather 
and vinyl cases, said Lewis Savinar of H. Savinar Luggage Co., a family-run 
discount retailer in Los Angeles. But there are also canvas, wooden and even 
gold, silver or black aluminum cases. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers are not only tinkering with the outward appearance of business 
cases. Inside, they have been adding more compartments, flaps and pockets to 
hold things such as pens, calculators, business cards and appointment books. 
</P>
<P>
"From a merchant's standpoint, the sheer variety of selection has become tough 
to manage," Savinar said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Influence of Women 
</P>
<P>
"A super-conservative buyer like a lawyer or an accountant would buy the brief 
bag; a lot of judges, for instance, buy these," Savinar said, pointing to the 
accordion-like bags that close at the top with a small flap. 
</P>
<P>
Those a little less conservative, he said, often stick with a basic leather 
attache case. And trendy yuppies and "your entertainment industry types" are 
partial to the $340 to $560 silver and black aluminum briefcases marketed by 
Zero Halliburton, a division of Zero Corp. of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But it is the rise of women executives that has caused perhaps the biggest 
rethinking in business case design and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Stack, first vice president at the Los Angeles investment house of 
Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, is typical of those women executives who have 
chosen a soft-sided case over a hard-sided briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
"Style was a minimal consideration" when she decided to forgo a traditional 
briefcase and buy a soft-sided, expandable portfolio case, Stack said. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, I brought it because it was cheap and functional," Stack said. "I 
can carry my lunch in it, my calculator and my appointment book. I don't think 
people's egos are as tied up in what they carry," she said, adding that she's 
seen a lot of men carry portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, manufacturers have alternately toyed with bright colors, 
slimmer designs and softer materials in an effort to appeal to women 
executives. Yet, except for preferring lighter-weight products with shoulder 
straps, most women generally stick with the same conservative colors and styles 
that men purchase, retailers say. 
</P>
<P>
"They buy the same thing men buy," Savinar said. "The only difference is that 
they don't like anything heavy. Savinar said many women customers at his store 
buy small three-inch-wide briefcases or portfolios -- a flat portable leather 
case that usually closes at the top with a zipper or a leather flap. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, although attache cases still outsell all other business cases, unit 
sales of portfolios increased 115,000 to 5.17 million from 1987 to 1988, nearly 
twice the unit increase of attache cases, according to the Luggage &amp; 
Leather Goods Manufacturers of America. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Penix, executive vice president of Hartmann Luggage Co., a division of 
Brown-Forman Corp. of Louisville, Ky., concedes that "women have had a big 
impact on us. We now offer a little softer design and the addition of shoulder 
straps on some portfolios," Penix said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attached to Old Cases 
</P>
<P>
Technology is also having a big impact on the design of briefcases. 
</P>
<P>
At least one company, Rona of Little Ferry, N.J., now offers a briefcase with a 
compartment for a mobile cellular telephone. The company already produces other 
models designed to hold tape recorders and typewriters. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, while many manufacturers are experimenting with unusual designs and 
materials, some experts complain that it's difficult to get consumers to try 
some of the newer variations because people become so attached to their old 
briefcase. What's more, prices for new leather cases have escalated sharply in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"Briefcases are like a desk away from the office," observed Penix, of Hartmann 
Luggage Co. "A good briefcase helps you organize your life. People get very 
emotionally attached to their briefcases. We've done a lot of repairs for 
people who've had their briefcases for 20 years or more and don't want to give 
them up for a new one."

APPOINTMENT BOOKS RANGE FROM MERELY TRENDY TO HIGH TECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As briefcases have become more varied and complex to appeal to a greater 
variety of people, so too has another piece of business gear: the appointment 
book. 
</P>
<P>
Once a simple affair -- sporting perhaps a calendar and a pen holder -- some 
appointment books have become as large as briefcases and as complicated as 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
Casio Inc., a big Japanese consumer electronics company, has a new device they 
call the B.O.S.S. (for business organizing scheduling system). The B.O.S.S., 
which is about the size of a checkbook, can electronically list appointments, 
write memos, exchange data with a personal computer and sound an electronic 
alarm that reminds the busy executive that he or she has another appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Yet bells and whistles aren't confined to electronic products. Ordinary 
paper-based appointment books are sprouting new twists also. 
</P>
<P>
Culver City-based Day Runner Inc., a leading maker of appointment books and 
scheduling aids, says the market for such products has changed dramatically 
since the company was founded in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Demand has cooled for the company's original product: bright red, green or blue 
vinyl appointment books that included a simple calendar and note pad and closed 
with a Velcro strap. 
</P>
<P>
But sales of the company's more conservative -- and costlier -- black- and 
burgundy-leather covered books have increased so much that the company no 
longer sells the original vinyl product. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to tone them down, then get rid of them completely," Hope Neiman, vice 
president-marketing, said in reference to the bright-colored appointment books. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened," she continued, "was that (our original) trendy female-oriented 
item, became a business tool for men and women. And people wanted to look 
businesslike." So they opted for the leather books, which combined listings for 
telephone numbers, appointments, memos and other notes. 
</P>
<P>
Although Day Runner sells appointment books for as little as $10, its top of 
the line model, the $250 "Entrepreneur," is as large and expensive as some 
briefcases. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we are going to deceive ourselves and say that this is the only 
thing an executive needs to carry," Neiman said of the portfolio-sized 
organizer, which has retractable handles to make it easier to carry. "There are 
still things they are going to need a briefcase for." 
</P>
<P>
As for competition from electronic scheduling organizers such as Casio's, 
Neiman said: "I'm not terribly concerned. People still operate mostly on a 
paper-based systems."

'INTERVENTIONIST' JUDGE IN EASTERN CASE; 
</P>
<P>
LIFLAND'S STYLE BORDERS ON THE ECCENTRIC, SOME LAWYERS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Eastern Airlines' tortuous path has taken it through multimillion-dollar losses 
into a crippling strike and the refuge of bankruptcy court. Now its fate rests 
with a powerful judge known for biting sarcasm, a penchant for popcorn and a 
determination to get the airline flying again. 
</P>
<P>
In the 2 1/2 months since Burton R. Lifland has been overseeing Eastern's 
reorganization, his actions have chafed the carrier and its lawyers. Even 
representatives of Eastern's unions, who applaud many of Lifland's decisions, 
privately call him "a loose cannon." 
</P>
<P>
Lifland, 60, has a style that some lawyers and acquaintances privately say 
borders on the eccentric. 
</P>
<P>
During one tense, closed-door negotiation, he made bowls of popcorn for 
everybody. His courtroom utterances are liberally sprinkled with humor and 
jibes. He can reduce high-powered, haughty attorneys to the level of red-faced, 
stammering schoolboys standing nervously before him. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the rows of law books lining the walls, a huge poster of Rumpole of the 
Bailey, the fictional British barrister, dominates Lifland's chambers in the 
federal bankruptcy courthouse. The high-ceilinged rooms in the 
turn-of-the-century Customs House Building in lower Manhattan command a 
splendid view of the Hudson River. 
</P>
<P>
Lifland rarely talks to reporters and declined to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lectures at Schools 
</P>
<P>
As the chief U.S. bankruptcy judge for the Southern District of New York, 
Lifland has presided over some of the biggest and most complex cases in 
history. They include former asbestos maker Manville Corp., steelmaker LTV 
Corp. and farm machinery maker Allis-Chalmers Corp. 
</P>
<P>
He's a graduate of Syracuse University and Fordham University Law School, and 
frequently lectures at law schools and legal conferences. 
</P>
<P>
Lifland's primary concern for the past 2 1/2 months has been Eastern, since 
parent Texas Air Corp. put it into Chapter 11 protection from creditors on 
March 9, five days after a crippling strike. 
</P>
<P>
In the Eastern case, as in others, Lifland has departed from the historically 
neutral role many bankruptcy judges take, in the view of some lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been interventionist at the far end of the spectrum," said Karen Gross, 
a professor at New York Law School and a director of the National Bankruptcy 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the case, Lifland ordered the appointment of a bankruptcy examiner for 
Eastern with extraordinary powers. He later ordered all parties to explain why 
he shouldn't put the airline up for auction. 
</P>
<P>
He has continually said it's in the public interest to get Eastern back to a 
full schedule quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'm hearing is a reflection of parochial interests; what I'm not hearing 
is the public interest here," Lifland scolded attorneys for Eastern and the 
unions at one hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"The public is a main player here," he said, citing the consumers who "have 
scrimped and saved" to buy Eastern tickets and can't use them. 
</P>
<P>
Statements like that have riled a number of bankruptcy attorneys who are not 
involved in the Eastern case but say they are worried about precedents that may 
be set by Lifland. 
</P>
<P>
Some believe that the judge has lost his impartiality, has sided with Eastern's 
unions and is pushing the airline into a hasty "bargain-basement" sale. 
</P>
<P>
They dismiss Lifland's public interest argument, asserting that a bankruptcy 
court is charged only with protecting the interests of creditors and 
shareholders. The public, they say, can find seats on other airlines if needed. 
</P>
<P>
"He's grandstanding and that's counterproductive," said a bankruptcy attorney 
unconnected with the Eastern case who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Even union representatives, who have liked many of Lifland's moves, complain 
privately that he has raised their expectations too high and has subsequently 
backed down on several occasions. 
</P>
<P>
"He really has painted himself into a corner; there doesn't seem to be any easy 
way out of it," said a union team member who asked not to be identified. 
"Bankruptcy judges do not do heroic things very often." 
</P>
<P>
In mid-April, sources say, Lifland was persuaded under pressure to back down 
when he came close to appointing a powerful temporary trustee to run Eastern, 
which in effect would have invalidated management's authority. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Insisted on Trustee 
</P>
<P>
The trustee issue was at the heart of the collapse of ex-Baseball Commissioner 
Peter V. Ueberroth's $464-million deal to buy Eastern from Texas Air Chairman 
Frank Lorenzo. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern's three unions, which had agreed to accept a reported $210 million in 
labor concessions in exchange for a 30% share in the airline, insisted on a 
trustee to replace Lorenzo before Ueberroth took over. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo refused to accept the appointment of a trustee, which is rarely done in 
bankruptcy cases and usually implies fraud or mismanagement on the part of a 
company's bosses. 
</P>
<P>
Sources say Eastern's lead bankruptcy attorney, Harvey Miller, mobilized other 
lawyers to warn Lifland against naming a trustee and the signal that would 
send. Miller, widely considered one of the most prominent bankruptcy lawyers in 
the country, declined comment on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he (Lifland) saw he was going to have a battle" if he opted for a 
trustee, said a source close to the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Lifland does have defenders in the legal community, however. 
</P>
<P>
"I know him to be a dedicated, sincere judge. He's very well motivated," said 
Joseph Gassen, a former bankruptcy judge who is now an attorney in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Lifland is trying to find a timely solution to revive Eastern, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The judge's razor-sharp humor is relentless. 
</P>
<P>
In one hearing, after making a lengthy speech, Miller somberly presented a 
towering stack of documents to Lifland. He waved them away, telling the 
attorney, "I had planned to devour a Robert Ludlum novel tonight." 
</P>
<P>
On another occasion, Lifland expressed disappointment that "no members of the 
female gender graced" the lawyers' bench at that particular hearing. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing on Eastern in late April, pilots union attorney Bruce Simon said 
he was so angered by Miller's remarks that "I am moved to stand." 
</P>
<P>
"Would you be less moved if you sat down?" Lifland shot back.

IN DESERT SOLITUDE, FAITHFUL PAY TRIBUTE TO THE ABBEY MYTH

Edward Abbey died on March 14 at age 62. That evening, friends hauled the 
author of "The Monkeywrench Gang" into the desert and buried him under a big 
pile of black rocks, somewhere out in the middle of nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, some of those same friends, accompanied by hundreds of 
others, walked into another part of that vast slick rock and cacti cemetery to 
celebrate the life of a man, who, more quickly than any writer since Jack 
Kerouac, has been resurrected as a modern myth. 
</P>
<P>
In "Desert Solitaire," the 1968 book that incited a generation of 
environmentalists, Abbey described hauling the bloated carcass of a tourist 
from a remote canyon in Arches National Park. Then a seasonal ranger, Abbey 
congratulated the man on his good fortune in dying under the desert sky, away 
from meddling doctors and priests. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had loved him," he added, "we would sing, dance, drink, build a 
stupendous bonfire, find women, make love . . . and celebrate his 
transfiguration from flesh to fantasy in a style proper and fitting, with fun 
for all at the funeral." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, folks did just that -- presumably all of it. They also talked at 
length about why, as one speaker said, so many of the disparate people who had 
arrived at this remote mesa from around the country would recall the moment 
they heard Abbey had died as vividly as the moment they learned that John 
Kennedy had been shot. 
</P>
<P>
As the morning sun lifted layers of gray from the surrounding red and black 
bluffs, poet Wendall Berry told the congregation that Abbey's work gave people 
courage. 
</P>
<P>
Berry is forbidden to read Abbey at night because his laughter wakes up the 
house, he said. But concealed in Abbey's humor, he added, is a commitment to a 
serious vision and an antidote to the despair that sometimes seems integral to 
modern life. 
</P>
<P>
"I never laid down a book by Edward Abbey that I did not feel more encouraged 
than when I picked it up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hike Up a Dirt Road 
</P>
<P>
The tribute was staged a short hike up a dirt road that had been the entrance 
to the park when Abbey worked there. Soaring Entrada sandstone cliffs framed 
one side of the setting; in another direction hovered the snow-capped 
Tukuhnikivats, which Abbey called "the mightiest mountains in the land of 
Moab." 
</P>
<P>
Someone had set an American flag beside the small podium, from which speakers 
addressed the several hundred people spread out across a gentle slope of 
lichen-mottled sandstone. 
</P>
<P>
More than one speaker remarked that Abbey's work was distinguished by a rare 
love of life and love of country, despite his anti-authoritarian disgust with 
government and his radical stands against much of modern life. 
</P>
<P>
"Patriotism," Berry said, "is not the love of air conditioning or the 
interstate highway system or the government or the flag or power or money or 
munitions. It is the love of country." 
</P>
<P>
The Eastern Literary Establishment made only grudging nods of recognition at 
Abbey. That apparently suited him fine. In one of his worst nightmares, he once 
said, the "effete" novelist John Updike moved into the scruffy neighborhood 
outside Tucson, Ariz., where Abbey and his fifth wife, Clarke, lived for almost 
two decades. 
</P>
<P>
But now, even some of the Eastern literati are paying homage, said Barry Lopez, 
author of books such as "Arctic Dreams" and perhaps the best known of the new 
breed of nature writers. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the literary Establishment ignored Ed, or dismissed him as a crank," 
Lopez said, before addressing the Abbeyites. "Now they're coming around 180 
degrees. The reason he is already a mythic figure is his quality of integrity 
and saying exactly what's on his mind. We live in a land where so much is based 
on duplicity of language. People have a real thirst for anyone who speaks with 
a clear voice in a direct and uncompromising manner, saying precisely what they 
mean." 
</P>
<P>
Few writers with their literary roots in the West ever doubted that Abbey was a 
force to be reckoned with. 
</P>
<P>
Larry McMurtry, author of "Lonesome Dove," has termed Abbey "a modern Thoreau." 
</P>
<P>
John Nichols, the author of "The Milagro Beanfield Wars" whose bad heart kept 
him at his Taos, N.M., home this weekend, said of Abbey by telephone: "I think 
'Desert Solitaire' will stand up as a powerful classic. And 'Monkey Wrench 
Gang' will always be a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Monkey Wrench -- the romantic tale of a ragtag band of river rats who 
rampage through the Southwest ripping up survey stakes, dismantling bulldozers 
and launching other quixotic attacks on alleged progress -- the author wrote: 
eight other novels (the last of which is scheduled for release in the fall); 
five coffee table photographic collections, and six collections of essays. All 
reflect his preference for the natural over the man-made world and a 
strong-headed individualism in combat against technocracy. 
</P>
<P>
Abbey's books, "were burrs under the saddle blanket of complacency," author 
Wallace Stegner wrote in a letter Berry read to to the gathering. "He was a 
red-hot moment in the conscience of the country, and I suspect that the 
half-life of his intransigence will turn out to be comparable to uranium." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Beer-Can Salute 
</P>
<P>
George Foreman, who co-founded the radical environmental group Earth First!, 
raised a beer-can toast to the man who inspired what has been called "red-neck 
environmentalism." 
</P>
<P>
"Ed said that one brave deed is worth a thousand words. But every novel, every 
essay, every story Ed wrote has launched a thousand brave deeds," he said. The 
people cheered. A string quartet played Mozart. 
</P>
<P>
Word about the tribute spread in a way the anarchist Abbey might have approved. 
Throughout his life, he had fired off fusillades of white postcards to praise, 
scold and maintain contact with the countless people, who, for whatever 
reasons, drifted into his field of influence, those who knew him said. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's affair, announced with a postcard barrage and a few notices in 
publications of the environmental fringe, drew academic admirers and 
reverential young Abbey cultists who insist on chucking beer cans out car 
windows because their iconoclastic hero was known to have done so. A physician 
who attended said he had worked with Chico Mendes in the Amazon rain forests 
before that organizer of the rubber-tappers union was murdered. Another man who 
came said he spent his life exploring for gas and oil throughout the Southwest. 
He felt no guilt about what might appear to be hypocrisy. Abbey would 
understand his need to work outdoors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Those who knew Abbey conceded that he had a few inconsistencies himself. His 
attitude was, "So?" 
</P>
<P>
He has been accused of racism, sexism, fascism. Abbey supporters said such 
charges are made by people who have not read his work closely. Supporters found 
other things to fight with him about. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Abbey once wrote: "If there's anyone still present whom I've 
failed to insult, I apologize." 
</P>
<P>
Nichols, who shared Abbey's environmentalism but denounced aspects of his 
politics, said that the author's humor defused any true antipathy. "When I 
think of Ed Abbey, I think of Emma Goldman, who said, 'If I can't dance, I 
don't want to be part of your revolution,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Congress is now considering a bill that would make several million acres along 
the Utah-Colorado border a wilderness area. A congressional sponsor of the 
proposal has recommended that the area be named after Abbey. 
</P>
<P>
Other parts of the land he cherished, though, have fallen to his worst fears. 
</P>
<P>
In "Desert Solitaire," Abbey decried the "industrial tourism" he felt the 
National Park Service encouraged with its paved campgrounds and flush toilets. 
Such places disregard the adventurous urbanites who came for a rare taste of 
"the primitive and remote." Instead they attract "the indolent millions, born 
on wheels and suckled on gasoline." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, tourists now march into the air-conditioned visitor's center at Arches 
National Park and ask if there are sights they can see without leaving their 
motor homes. The winding main roads are now paved and lined with numbered signs 
pointing out each spectacular mesa and rock formation. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the paradox" said Robin Wilson, widow of Bates Wilson, the park 
administrator whom Abbey credited with "much of what understanding I have of a 
country we both love." 
</P>
<P>
"All of us who know this area want to bring all our friends here and share it 
with them," said Wilson, now an activist in the area. "It builds and builds." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dancing and Drinking 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, at a guest ranch outside Moab, hundreds of Abbey aficionados 
danced and drank. 
</P>
<P>
It probably was not as raucous as Abbey had wanted, but someone did let the 
horses out of the corral, and at least one young woman, wearing only a blouse, 
staggered across a lawn littered with cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
The ranch, complete with a bookstore well-stocked with naturalist writings, 
poetry, and wildflower guides, is run by Ken Sleight, widely acknowledged to be 
Abbey's inspiration for the Monkey Wrencher, Seldom Seen Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm meeting all sorts of people I thought were myths tonight," said Sleight's 
wife, Jane. 
</P>
<P>
Among the myths she knows well is Douglas Peacock, reportedly the man upon whom 
Abbey based George Washington Hayduke, the Monkey Wrench hero who is gunned 
down by a government helicopter like an American mujahedeen defending God's 
Country. 
</P>
<P>
About midnight, while young Abbeyites hooted and spun yarns and sashayed to 
twanging goat-roper music, Peacock and Sleight embraced, grappled, laughed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Borrowed Traits 
</P>
<P>
Peacock, 47, still sunburned and stocky, makes films about grizzlies. Sleight, 
a thin guy with a bowl haircut, glasses and a cowboy boots, takes dudes out on 
horse-pack trips into the canyons he and Abbey used to explore. 
</P>
<P>
"Ed borrowed traits from some of us to wrap the characters around," Sleight, 
59, said, his words coming slowly after a full day of toasting a friend. "But 
they were also very autobiographical. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Abbey myth is going to get bigger and bigger," he said. "I 
encourage it, because I believe in what he had to say." 
</P>
<P>
Abbey was courted by Hollywood off and on throughout his life. He was pleased 
with the film "Lonely Are the Brave" in which Gregory Peck played the hero of 
Abbey's early novel "The Brave Cowboy." 
</P>
<P>
Now companies are reportedly bidding on his latest novel, "Fool's Progress," 
and there is renewed interest in producing a film based on "The Monkey Wrench 
Gang." 
</P>
<P>
Before he died, Abbey completed the sequel to the Monkey Wrench Gang -- 
"Hayduke Lives!" Long before the sequel was announced, though, "Hayduke Lives!" 
bumper stickers became ubiquitous throughout the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
Now there's an addendum. 
</P>
<P>
On the road leading into Sleight's ranch, where a hundred or more cars and 
trucks with raft frames and kayaks and mountain bikes on top lined up, at least 
one sticker on one dirty Jeep had been defaced with the words: Abbey Lives!

O.C. ESCAPEE GETS SPECIAL ATTENTION IN SOUTH DAKOTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
RAPID CITY, South Dakota 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pennington County Jail here on Kansas City Street is an unassuming, white 
stone structure that houses about 100 prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, none of the prisoners is being watched more closely than Michael 
Taylor, who had been the lone escapee remaining free following a November, 
1988, breakout at the Orange County Jail and is a suspect in dozens of 
robberies in California and the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
"He is classified as a security risk," Pennington County Sheriff Don Holloway 
said. "He's in a maximum-security jail cell, and he's put in restraints when 
taken around the facility. We're taking special precautions." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 36, was arrested Saturday in this city of 52,000 when he tried to sell 
several loose diamonds at a pawnshop, where a jeweler became suspicious of 
Taylor and called police. Arrested along with Taylor was a woman who law 
enforcement officials say is his common-law wife, Lisa Marie Prindes, 24. Also 
arrested with Taylor was a man who first gave his name to police as David Meek 
but later was identified as Raymond E. Williams, 24. 
</P>
<P>
Like Taylor, they are being held at the Pennington County Jail without bail. 
They are scheduled to appear before a state magistrate today for arraignment on 
charges related to aiding Taylor, who was wanted on a federal fugitive warrant. 
</P>
<P>
A 6-year-old boy and 2-year-old girl who were traveling with Taylor and Prindes 
were placed in the custody of the state Department of Social Services. Police 
have said that at least one of the children was fathered by Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Rapid City police released few details Sunday about Taylor's activities in 
South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
Police Lt. Doug Noyes told the Rapid City Journal on Sunday that it appears 
that Taylor, Prindes and Williams had been traveling from city to city for the 
last 30 to 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
Noyes told the newspaper that Rapid City seemed to be a place where they 
stopped at the end of a travel day. He would not say what time they had arrived 
in town or whether they had been there overnight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FBI Got Tip 
</P>
<P>
After a May 7 broadcast of Fox network's "America's Most Wanted," a television 
program about fugitives, the FBI received a tip that Taylor and Prindes had 
Nevada driver's licenses and possibly were living in Portland, Me., FBI Agent 
Bucky Cox of the agency's Orange County office said Saturday. When agents 
arrived at the Portland address, however, Taylor was not there. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was believed traveling along Interstate 90 when he stopped in Rapid 
City, which is at the base of South Dakota's Black Hills, northwest of Mt. 
Rushmore. 
</P>
<P>
Interstate 90 runs from Rapid City to Seattle, near where Taylor once lived in 
a home in which police found photographs of him posing in front of posters of 
the FBI's 10 most wanted fugitives. 
</P>
<P>
While local authorities remained tight-lipped about one of the bigger crime 
suspects to come through their city in some time, Rapid City jewelers and 
pawnshop dealers chuckled about Taylor's amateurish attempt to fence some 
apparently hot stones. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason I didn't touch it, he was in here about 1:30, (and) said he had a 
buyer at 4 p.m. but he needed the money now," said Pete Skovran, owner of 
Landstrom's Jewelers on "St. Joe," the local shorthand for St. Joseph Street, a 
main shopping thoroughfare downtown. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Didn't Like Sound of It 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't like the sound of it," Skovran said. "I was going to call the police, 
but I was tied up at the time with a Rolex customer." 
</P>
<P>
Skovran said the diamonds were "pretty good-sized stones," including a 
pear-shaped jewel that looked to be about three-quarters of a carat. 
</P>
<P>
"He said they were 'VS1' stones -- very slightly imperfect -- and I told him I 
would determine that," Skovran said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Taylor left Skovran's shop, the jeweler got a call from Darcy 
Knight, manager of the Fair Deal Pawn &amp; Gun Shop on East Boulevard. Knight 
told Skovran that Taylor had been in his shop, too, and that he was going to 
call the police if he returned. Skovran agreed that that was a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor also tried to sell diamonds Saturday to Butch McKinney, owner of Best 
Pawn Shop on North Street, just a few blocks from Knight's business. 
</P>
<P>
"He come in here and showed me four diamonds," said McKinney. Unlike Knight, 
though, who became suspicious because Taylor was asking so little for what 
appeared to be valuable jewels, McKinney found Taylor's asking price of $2,000 
about 50% too high. 
</P>
<P>
"We lowball the heck out of 'em," McKinney said Sunday. "I didn't get a chance 
to look at 'em real good. . . . But they looked too clean, pretty flawless, and 
that made me nervous. . . . I think they were sapphires myself." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clumsy Attempt 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's clumsy attempt to get some quick cash contradicts his image of a 
meticulous, sophisticated jewel thief, painted by some of his alleged robbery 
victims and by longtime pursuers in law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was awaiting trial in Orange County Jail last November for seven Orange 
County robberies, including the theft of more than $100,000 in gems from a 
Huntington Beach jewelry store last year. Los Angeles police said Taylor was 
connected to other robberies in Los Angeles in 1988, and he was about to face 
charges in 10 of those cases when he led four other prisoners in an escape from 
the roof of the jail in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The five men cut through a wire fence at the top of the jail, then rappelled 
down the four-story structure with a rope made from braided sheets while one of 
two guards assigned to watch the roof area was away from his post. 
</P>
<P>
The two guards were accused of not doing their jobs and were blamed for the 
jail breakout. One was fired and the other was disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
One inmate broke his leg in the escape and was caught immediately. Three others 
were back in custody within a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
But Taylor, who eluded authorities, is suspected of stealing $450,000 worth of 
jewels from a store in the Chicago suburb of River Grove last February after 
abducting the store manager from her home in west Chicago. Chicago police say 
he is a suspect in a number of other robberies as well. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities in Orange and Los Angeles counties said the jewels and gold taken 
in earlier heists may total $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer George Frank in Orange County contributed to this story.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: PURPLE IS NOT WHERE IT'S AT IN ENCINITAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fazal Bandukwala has learned a sad lesson: North County is not as hip as it 
appears. 
</P>
<P>
He thought Encinitas, along Old Highway 101, would be an ideal spot for one of 
his Gamma Gamma stores. Where better to sell avant-garde clothing and jewelry 
than a beach community known for its laid-back life style and tolerance of the 
idiosyncratic? 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't worked out that way. As soon as Gamma Gamma opened, the complaints 
began. 
</P>
<P>
His merchant neighbors didn't like the fact he painted the storefront purple, 
painted his 
</P>
<P>
interior walls black, and put up a black awning. Their fronts are sandstone, 
their walls are white, and most of their awnings are green. 
</P>
<P>
There were also concerns that Bandukwala's offbeat merchandise and decor would 
attract the rowdy punk-rock crowd. 
</P>
<P>
A formal complaint over the purple front was filed with the city. Bandukwala's 
landlord was told to either return the front to its original color or file for 
a painting permit, which would allow the other merchants to air their 
objections. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what decade these people are living in," said Bandukwala, who has 
stores in Long Beach, El Cajon, Hillcrest, Mission Beach and the State College 
area. "All I want to do is sell to people who don't feel comfortable at 
Nordstrom or Sears. It's just plain harassment." 
</P>
<P>
John Gessel, owner of Jerry's Shoes across the street, says Gamma Gamma opened 
just as the newly formed Downtown Encinitas Mainstreet Assn. was working to 
spiffy up the area and keep it commercially viable. 
</P>
<P>
"What we don't want is for the area to look like Berkeley or some sort of 
circus, with one front red, another green, one mauve, like a barber pole," 
Gessel said. "We're not harassing anybody, just asking them to join us in 
making the street look respectable." 
</P>
<P>
The city has sent two notices to Bandukwala's landlord. One more and the case 
goes to the city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Gamma Gamma clerks are circulating a petition asking the city to back off. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I was willing to do whatever they want, now I think there's a 
principle involved," Bandukwala said. "This community is definitely not as hip 
as I thought." 
</P>
<P>
Drawing the Line 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Wambaugh's 1984 book "Lines and Shadows," about the San Diego Police 
Department's two-fisted Border Area Robbery Force, never achieved the success 
of his other efforts. 
</P>
<P>
It did not sell as well as "Choirboys" or "New Centurions." It spawned a 
$91-million civil suit by a disgruntled cop, which is still in the courts, 
where a trial setting conference was held last week. 
</P>
<P>
And now Home Box Office has shelved plans to make "Lines and Shadows" into a 
made-for-television movie. Executives could never agree on a script and began 
to worry that the market for cop movies is overloaded. 
</P>
<P>
Fun at Any Price? 
</P>
<P>
A 22-year-old San Diego man was nabbed at a Target store in Encinitas for 
allegedly shoplifting two-dozen condoms and a compact disk of an English pop 
group. 
</P>
<P>
A store security guard spotted the man stuffing the condoms (worth $4.69) in 
the pocket of his sweat shirt and the compact disc ($13.99) in his shorts. As 
he began to tip-toe away for a weekend of fun, he was snatched in the parking 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
The musical group on the disk: Simple Minds. 
</P>
<P>
Now Class, Back to Work 
</P>
<P>
A wood-shop teacher at San Dieguito High School in Encinitas was surprised when 
a young woman he had never met showed up in his class. 
</P>
<P>
He was even more surprised when the woman told him, "Congratulations, you're a 
(body part)," and then sprayed his face with whipped cream and doused him with 
confetti. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies are investigating. It looks like a conspiracy, with the 
18-year-old hit person, a former student, working in cahoots with a student who 
has a grudge against the teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Principal Simeon Greenstein says the teacher handled the 
"mean-spirited prank" rather well. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a potentially humiliating experience to have that happen in front of a 
class," Greenstein said. "But he was low-key in his response."

POST OFFICE ON WHEELS OPENS IN LEISURE WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A "post office on wheels" opened for business last week in Leisure World. 
</P>

The new postal service consists of three 2 1/2-ton postal vans to be parked 
from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Clubhouse 3 on Mondays and at Clubhouse 5 on Fridays. 
Nearly all services available at post office retail lobbies will be available

window washers who were trapped five floors up on the outside of downtown's 
Federal Building, 880 Front Street, on Sunday afternoon. The workers' platform 
partially collapsed when a motor failed. An aerial ladder was used to reach 
Henry Tudmon and Michael Dace and lift them to safety. DAVID McNEW

A DRIVEN EXPLORER PURSUES ULTIMATE ALTERNATE ROUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
I sometimes fancy myself an intrepid urban explorer. 
</P>
<P>
Like the time in New York when I discovered I could forgo the subway and walk 
to work across the Brooklyn Bridge. That is, until the dank summer arrived. 
There were no showers at The Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
When I returned to California, I took up bicycling to work in Riverside. The 
newspaper there even installed special bike racks to encourage the practice. 
Again, no showers. But that wasn't too bad. The heat was dry. A bigger problem 
was health-threatening smog, which accumulates in Riverside with the regularity 
of raindrops in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Neither walking nor bicycling to work is practical for me now because of time, 
distance, and family obligations. So the big challenge in my daily commute from 
Seal Beach to The Times' office in Costa Mesa is simply to avoid traffic 
congestion. 
</P>
<P>
It has proven to be the most difficult challenge of all, and is personally 
significant since transportation in Orange County is part of my beat. 
</P>
<P>
I can no longer predict which days will be best for joining the queues on the 
San Diego Freeway. Even without accidents, a trip that took me 25 minutes in 
1976 now takes 45 minutes or more during the morning rush hour. Even my 
favorite Mozart tape and National Public Radio's "Morning Edition" no longer 
can keep me mollified on the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
In the office one day, I thought out loud about taking a new shuttle van 
offered by the Orange County Transit District and South Coast Metro Alliance. 
It leaves from a parking lot near my house and stops in front of The Times' 
plant. My boss said, "Forget it -- your work hours are unpredictable. What 
would you do if we needed you to stay past the last shuttle departure at 
night?" Reporters don't keep 9-5 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Then Robert Best, Gov. George Deukmejian's transportation chief, issued a 
challenge to the public generally. "Become smart drivers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And so began my search for The Alternate Route. 
</P>
<P>
Day One. I took the San Diego Freeway to Springdale Street, intending to hook 
up with Warner Avenue. Big mistake. There was a stop sign instead of a signal 
at the top of the off-ramp, which meant it took 5 minutes just to turn onto 
Springdale. Then, at Warner, an accident had traffic narrowed to one southbound 
lane. Trip time: 42 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Day Two. I took the San Diego Freeway to Beach Boulevard, then south to Talbert 
Avenue, where a bare-chested, scruffy-looking man pounded on my window and 
asked for money while I waited for the red light to change. The traffic on the 
Talbert Avenue bridge over the Santa Ana River was backed up all the way to 
Ward Street. Trip time: 44 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Day Three. I took Bolsa Chica Road to Warner Avenue, then down Beach Boulevard 
to Slater Avenue. An accident on Slater near Beach had traffic backed up a 
mile. A Huntington Beach cop stopped me to ask about my custom license plate -- 
"A SNOOP." He's about the fourth law enforcement officer to do so since 1981. 
They usually ask if I'm with the CIA or KGB. Trip time: 40 minutes. There's 
hope! 
</P>
<P>
Day Four. I tried Pacific Coast Highway to Superior Avenue in Newport Beach, 
then north on Fairview Road. The friend who recommended this route didn't tell 
me that a construction project on the highway would back up traffic north of 
the Santa Ana River, and that Superior doesn't go through to Fairview. I got 
lost on Placentia Avenue in Costa Mesa, then lost again around the Mesa Verde 
Country Club. My tape deck jammed on "A Little Night Music." Trip time: 59 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Day Five. A solution! Thirty minutes! I took Pacific Coast Highway to . . . 
</P>
<P>
I'd be crazy to tell you the rest.

HANDICAPPED MAN VANISHES AT DISNEYLAND, IS FOUND SAFE

<P>
A mentally handicapped man who disappeared on a weekend visit to Disneyland was 
found unharmed Sunday, walking along a street on Balboa Island, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Alfonso Navaretti, 52, of Santa Maria was last seen about 5 p.m. Saturday 
entering a restroom next to the Alice in Wonderland attraction in Fantasyland, 
Anaheim Police Lt. Vince Howard said. Navaretti was visiting the amusement park 
with a tour group of about 30 other mentally handicapped people from Santa 
Maria, which is north of Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
An all-night search of the theme park and surrounding neighborhoods by 
Disneyland security and Anaheim police failed to turn up Navaretti or any clues 
as to his whereabouts, Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
"We had been told that he liked to walk, so we expanded our search to include 
some of the areas around the park, thinking that he may have left the park on 
his own" Howard said. "But we came up empty." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Description Circulated 
</P>
<P>
Navaretti's description was sent to other law enforcement agencies in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
About 1:30 p.m. Sunday, Newport Beach patrol officers spotted the middle-aged 
man calmly walking in the 500 block of Balboa Boulevard. He was taken to the 
Newport Beach Police Station, where Anaheim officers picked up him. 
</P>
<P>
He was reunited with his group, a Santa Barbara-based organization called New 
Directions, which puts together tours for the handicapped, and they returned to 
Santa Maria on Sunday afternoon, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Because Navaretti has the mental capacity of a child and can only respond to 
simple questions with yes or no answers, Howard said, investigators were unable 
to determine how Navaretti got from Anaheim to Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"There was just no way to interview him," Howard said. "The important thing was 
he was not hurt and seemed in good spirits."

POSTSCRIPT: ONCE-FEARED SUPER STALLION COPTERS RIDING HIGH ONCE MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE FRANK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago, after a string of fatal CH-53E Super Stallion helicopter 
accidents, residents around the Tustin Marine Corps Air Station began 
questioning the safety of the large helicopter that flew over their homes. 
</P>
<P>
The residents of Tustin and neighboring Irvine had cause to worry. The 
helicopter had been involved in eight accidents that killed 24 Marines and 
injured another 17, many of them stationed at the Orange County Marine base. 
Once, one of the big $18-million copters was forced to make an emergency 
landing in a field in Irvine after suffering transmission problems. 
</P>
<P>
City officials in both Tustin and Irvine wrote letters to the Marines 
expressing their concern, and the Tustin City Council tried to get the military 
to discontinue helicopter flights over the city until the Super Stallion could 
be proven safe. "We don't believe we necessarily have to wait for a major 
disaster to act," said Donald Saltarelli, then mayor of Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
The last crash of a Marine Super Stallion based at Tustin occurred Jan. 8, 
1987, near the Salton Sea in Imperial County. The aircraft was making a 
nighttime landing when the pilot lost his "situational awareness" in the dust 
and sand that was being churned up by the helicopter's giant rotor blades. The 
Super Stallion exploded, and all five Marines aboard were killed. 
</P>
<P>
(A Navy version of the CH-53E called a Sea Dragon crashed last July into the 
Pacific off San Francisco. All eight crew members were killed.) 
</P>
<P>
More than 28 months have passed since the last Marine Super Stallion crashed 
anywhere in the world. Concerns over whether one of the 100-foot-long 
helicopters, designed to lift 16 tons or carry about 50 combat-equipped troops, 
will fall from the sky seem to have dwindled. Super Stallions based at Tustin 
Marine Corps Air Station are flying more hours now than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the aircraft got a bad reputation early on, some of it was warranted," 
said Maj. Gen. Donald E. P. Miller, commander of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing 
at El Toro and Tustin air stations. 
</P>
<P>
Miller called the Super Stallion the Cadillac of helicopters, a blend of power 
and sophisticated electronic equipment. It is manufactured by Sikorsky, a 
subsidiary of United Technologies. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he believes that pilots have learned more about the aircraft, its 
limits and mechanics, and have learned how to better maintain the helicopter, 
which has more moving parts than any other aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. John Clinton, commander of a Super Stallion squadron at Tustin, said 
that trying to come up with an answer to why the helicopter had a string of 
crashes earlier and none for the last 2 years is "like trying to nail Jello to 
the wall." 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe you could say some pilots tried to push it (the craft) a little too 
much," said Clinton, who was given the task of piloting a Super Stallion with 
then Secretary of the Navy James H. Webb Jr. aboard when Webb came to 
California in 1987 to show his support for the troubled helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
Clinton contends that the Super Stallion has a good safety record, even though 
it had a string of crashes earlier. Of the eight accidents, he said, four were 
attributed to pilot error and four were because of malfunctions. 
</P>
<P>
The Super Stallion has an accident rate of 7.53 serious crashes per 100,000 
hours flown, Clinton said, while the popular Huey helicopter during a 
comparable 6-year period beginning in 1964 had a noncombat rate of 25.58 
accidents per 100,000 hours flown. 
</P>
<P>
"The Echo (Super Stallion) got a lot of bad press," Clinton said. "We think the 
aircraft is safe, and if it wasn't safe, we would not be flying it." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the military operates in a "lot more dangerous environment" than 
most civilian aircraft. Marine helicopter pilots train at night and fly low and 
fast. 
</P>
<P>
Through use of the Super Stallion, Miller said, the Marines have learned more 
about how best to move heavy objects by air. The helicopter is capable of 
lifting 16 tons, more than any other such aircraft outside the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more serious accidents involved a Super Stallion that was lifting a 
truck from the deck of a ship off San Clemente Island. The aircraft began 
bouncing, broke apart and plunged into the sea, killing all four Marines 
aboard. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said the accident was triggered when a sling apparatus gave way and 
recoiled back up into the helicopter. So a crew and a helicopter were lost, not 
because of the craft, but because a lifting device failed. 
</P>
<P>
"When you lift that much weight, things begin to rattle and roll, and you get 
some strange, creaking noises," Miller said. "We have learned a lot about 
hooking up heavy loads, and we learned that the aircraft may not do everything 
it was supposed to do."

BURGLARY SUSPECT COLLARED BY THREAT WITH TEETH IN IT

It was an odd time for a campuswide announcement over Orange Coast College's 
public address system, but it got a suspected car burglar's attention about 6 
a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, Allen, we know where you are, and we're going to send the police dogs in 
after you unless you come out now," boomed the voice of Costa Mesa Police 
Officer Clay Epperson throughout the campus. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was effective. Allen Wilcox, 21, of Costa Mesa showed his face 
to police officers before police dogs had a chance to show their teeth. 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox and a companion, Aaron Raffensberger, 21, of Huntington Beach, were 
arrested Sunday morning on suspicion of vehicular burglary, possession of 
burglary tools and possession of stolen property, Costa Mesa Police Lt. Gary 
Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suspect Fled to College 
</P>
<P>
A police officer saw two men apparently burglarizing a car about 5:45 a.m. at 
an apartment complex at 2700 Peterson Place, near Orange Coast College, Webster 
said. Raffensberger was held at the car, but the other suspect fled to the 
college. 
</P>
<P>
Officers surrounded a section of the campus and were given permission to use 
the public address system, Webster said. Although they did not know Wilcox's 
exact whereabouts, they bluffed a bit when they ordered him either to come out 
of hiding or be found by the dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox immediately emerged from the agricultural area. 
</P>
<P>
"The police dogs are a big deterrent," Webster said. "No one wants to meet them 
on a first-name basis."

FULLERTON LOSES TITLE GAME, 2-0

Cami Allen pitched a four-hitter and Palomar College took advantage of a key 
Fullerton error in the sixth to score both its runs en route to winning the 
state community college softball championship, 2-0, Sunday at Golden West 
College. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, Fullerton's Kristin Jacobs pitched a four-hitter to hand 
Palomar its first defeat of the double-elimination tournament, 2-0, and force 
the second game. 
</P>
<P>
Palomar (39-6) opened the bottom of the sixth of the second game with singles 
by Christie Westerlund and Kenda Leffler. Palomar got a big break one out later 
when left fielder Dena Oburn dropped a soft line drive by Allen to load the 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
Westerlund, who went to third on Oburn's error, scored on Jodi Williams' 
infield out. Leffler scored on Jessica Camacho's single. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (39-12) threatened against Allen (28-5) in the seventh when, with one 
out, Pita Licon walked and Christy Richmond and Debbie Wagner singled to load 
the bases. But Kelly Hilliard hit into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt we could hit against them, but we made too many mistakes," said 
Fullerton Coach Margo Davis, who is retiring after 31 years at the school. "You 
can't let a good team off the hook the way we did today." 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs (35-9), who had 19 consecutive scoreless innings before Palomar scored, 
scattered six hits in the loss. 
</P>
<P>
In the first game, Jacobs gave Fullerton a 1-0 lead with an RBI single in the 
fourth inning. Debbie Wagner, who doubled and moved to third on Hilliard's 
sacrifice to start the fifth, scored Fullerton's second run on a bunt by Kelli 
Johnson.

L.A. HARBOR LOSES FIRST GAME, 7-0, WINS SECOND, 2-1

<P>
There are plenty of positive ways to describe the pitching of Cypress College's 
Rich Lodding and Jeff Patterson in the Southern California Regional baseball 
playoffs this weekend at Rancho Santiago. But there's also a negative side -- 
their team will not be going to the state tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, that honor went to Los Angeles Harbor, which defeated Cypress, 2-1, on 
a ninth-inning RBI single by John Lopez in the second game between the teams 
Sunday in front of about 300 at Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Lodding (9-2) pitched a four-hitter as Cypress won, 7-0, to force a 
second game in the double-elimination tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson was supposed to start the second game, but Lodding, a sophomore 
right-hander, decided he had a few more outs in his arm and asked to pitch. He 
pitched two-plus innings, allowing one run, before being replaced by Patterson. 
Lodding allowed only one run in 13 1/3 innings in the regional tournament. 
Patterson allowed four runs in 17 1/3 innings in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson, a sophomore right-hander, had pitched 11 innings to help Cypress 
defeat Rancho Santiago, 4-3, in the first round Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson (10-4) was overpowering in the second game, getting 10 strikeouts in 
6 1/3 innings despite taking the loss. 
</P>
<P>
"Lodding was amazing," Cypress Coach Scott Pickler said. "You can't say enough 
about our pitching. . . . I guess it just wasn't in the cards for us this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Patterson's ninth-inning trouble started when Tony Liebsack led off with a 
single. After a strikeout, Patterson got David Lacroix to hit a grounder up the 
middle that shortstop Mitch Kaylor came up with. But Kaylor's throw skipped 
past first baseman Doug Yates and Harbor (32-14) had runners on first and third 
with one out. 
</P>
<P>
Pinch-hitter Mike Stone was intentionally walked, bringing Lopez up with the 
infield and outfield playing in. Patterson fell behind, three balls and no 
strikes as Harbor inched closer to victory. Patterson came back with two called 
strikes, but Lopez then lined a single past Kaylor at short. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so happy I could cry," Harbor Coach Jim O'Brien said. "This team has come 
so far. The kids learned to believe in themselves when no one else did." 
</P>
<P>
Cypress (34-15) scored in the second on an RBI single by Ken Kendrena to take a 
1-0 lead. Ryan Karp had an RBI single in the third and Harbor tied it, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress left two runners on in the sixth, and two more in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
In the ninth, Kaylor got a one-out walk. Dan Parente, a left-hander, then 
replaced Harbor starter Chris Garrett. Parente gave up a single to left-handed 
hitting Steve Gill, and Cypress had runners on first and second. But Parente 
came back to strike out Jason Friedman, also a left-handed hitter. Friedman 
struck out only 14 times in 214 at-bats this season. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Fulkerson, a right-hander, then replaced Parente and got Doug Yates to 
ground out on the first pitch to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress missed a chance to score in the first inning when Joey Gonzalez hit 
into an inning-ending double play with the bases loaded. Gonzalez appeared to 
beat the throw at first but was ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
In the earlier game, Yates had an RBI single and Friedman scored on a balk as 
Cypress took a 2-0 lead in the first. Harbor's only threat came in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Karp singled to start the inning, but was picked off first. Matt Nuez singled 
and went to third on a single by Parente. Nuez was then thrown out at the plate 
as a double steal failed and Lodding got out of the inning with a groundout. 
</P>
<P>
Lodding retired 15 of the final 17 batters he faced and finished with eight 
strikeouts.

UC IRVINE TRACK PROGRAM SIGNS DISTANCE RUNNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rayna Cervantes of Montebello High School, one of the nation's top high school 
distance runners, has signed a national letter of intent to attend UC Irvine in 
the fall, Cervantes said. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes, who as a junior last year was the state runner-up in the 3,200 
meters and had the second-best time in the nation in that event (10:18.8), won 
titles in both the 3-A 1,600 and 3,200 at the Southern Section track and field 
championships Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
She will provide a major boost to Irvine's already strong returning distance 
corps. Irvine also will have All-American Buffy Rabbitt, a former Newport 
Harbor High star, who spent the 1988-89 school year studying in France.

RICHMAN, BURNETT: A PAIRING OFF THAT PAYS OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The pairing of the ofttimes whimsical Jonathan Richman with T-Bone Burnett, 
writer of some of rock's most convoluted and weightedly ambiguous tomes, might 
not have seemed such a natural thing prior to their show Saturday at the Coach 
House. In retrospect, though, it seemed little less than inspired as, despite 
very different approaches, each performer is essentially a moralist. 
</P>
<P>
While Burnett's cerebral approach to delineating moral dilemmas has garnered 
him gobs of critic-bestowed "importance," Richman is a far more effective 
communicator on stage. For more than a decade he has been tirelessly offering 
his vision of what rock 'n' roll should be -- direct, human and as stripped of 
the hyped-up volume and trappings of arena as possible -- and the effort has 
paid off. Performed with an alarming earnestness, even his lyrics about 
chewing-gum wrappers or Greyhound bus trips become a challenge to touch the 
intensity in each moment of life. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, his short set offered odes to heroes as divergent as Vincent Van 
Gogh, whose "paintings had those colors because he loved life so bad," and 
baseball great Walter Johnson, who, Richman's song explained, "cared about 
people more than he cared about fame." 
</P>
<P>
On stage, Richman very much exemplifies the inspiration he sings about, making 
up verses on the spot and even, after an offhand request from an audience 
member, reprising one of his new songs, "Closer," with an on-the-spot Spanish 
translation. He accented his lyrics with a body language rich in the romance 
tongues and at times in mid-song would eschew his guitar and the microphone 
altogether to sing more directly to the audience. 
</P>
<P>
One of his still-unreleased songs was full of playful imagery about one of 
Orange County's grand contributions to American culture -- the Fender 
Stratocaster guitar: "Like the wind in your hair when the top is down, like 
taillights headed for another town: Fender Stratocaster." More often, though, 
his lyrics were haunting in their immersion in the world most of us lose with 
youth, as on the encore "That Summer Feeling": "When there's things to do, not 
because you've gotta / When you run for love, not because you oughtta / When 
you trust your friends with no reason not ta / That joy I've named shall not be 
tamed, and that summer feeling is going to haunt you one day in your life." 
</P>
<P>
Burnett, despite fighting an obvious case of nerves that may have been due to a 
5-year performing layoff, delivered a set whose strengths were obscured only by 
its length. Basically, Burnett is a performer as monochromatic as the ice-cream 
suit he sported, lacking the variety to give his set's 25 songs their full due. 
</P>
<P>
Paring it down to his strong points, though, it was a triumphal return. He 
relied little on the sometimes leaden allegories of his recent "The Talking 
Animals" album, delving more into 1983's "Proof Though the Night" and 1982's 
"The Trap Door." 
</P>
<P>
From the latter, he performed the biting "After All These Years," written 
following a coroner's disinterment of Marilyn Monroe's body. The song is a 
bitter attack at the way the essence of a person, not to say the person's 
dignity, is ignored in the hero-making process. Saturday, Burnett rededicated 
the song to Elvis Presley, while also wryly noting that if the proliferation of 
Elvis impersonators continues at the rate it has since his death, by 2010, one 
out of three people in the world will be one. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Burnett's strongest songs were also among his least ambiguous, 
particularly those from his sadly overlooked 1986 country album, "T-Bone 
Burnett." Of those "River of Love" and "Shake Yourself Loose" offered 
bittersweet ruminations on life and relationships that sailed in their spare 
simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
Such songs could only have been stronger if Burnett had left out some of his 
lesser songs. Except for when he brought on Sam Phillips, his wife, for two 
songs during his nine-song encore, there was a cumulative sameness to the show 
that blunted its edge.

JERRY GARCIA-BOB WEIR SHOW LACKLUSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some of the most exciting moments in Friday's Jerry Garcia Band-Bob Weir show 
at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre came early in the evening, indeed, well before 
either performer took to the stage. 
</P>
<P>
The pre-show tail-gate party/new-age swap meet common to Grateful Dead-related 
events was particularly enlivened this night by a bearded, be-turbaned fellow 
rolling around on high-tech skates, a portable amplifier strapped to his back. 
With a look of fried glee on his face, he sailed about, playing manic riffs on 
a battered Les Paul, singing something on the order of: "Computerized cocktail 
time, Computerized cocktail time, Midnight box opens, Arrgh! . . . ah, ha 
haaa!" 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it wouldn't have taken him far on "Star Search" but it was a sight more 
energetic than most of what Weir or Garcia had to offer in their Dead-Lite 
sets. Largely, these two front men only served to show, by the absence of the 
band they front, what a fragile magic it is that makes the Grateful Dead work. 
</P>
<P>
With the Dead and his own bands over the years, opener Weir has gained a 
reputation as one of the finest rhythm guitarists in rock, raising that 
oft-neglected role to a fine art. But, as such, he is at his finest as a 
support player, sparking and coloring other's solo flights. Supplemented only 
by acoustic bassist Rob Wasserman, Weir and his acoustic guitar -- on which he 
isn't nearly as nimble -- found little to underscore. 
</P>
<P>
While he did gather some momentum on Lowell George's "Easy to Slip" and the 
Dead's "Throwing Stones," oldies selections such as "Fever," "Twilight Time" 
and "Blackbird" stranded Weir's negligible voice without the Dead's 
unpredictable backings to spur him. Weir took only a few instrumental solos, 
leaving most of that to Wasserman. While the latter offered some flashy 
technique -- including beating his strings with his bow on some mock-flamenco 
passages -- he lacked the common jazzman's ability to really dig into the 
depths of his instrument. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia's set, meanwhile, cried out for some of the support Weir's guitar could 
have provided. Though his band -- which he never identified or even 
acknowledged -- was competent enough, they lacked the empathy and drive often 
needed to push Garcia's skills and corral his excesses. His guitar work 
displayed plenty of both in a set loaded with comfortable oldies. Garcia's 
croaked singing, by the way, has pretty much waned from endearing to 
abominable. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, nothing happening on stage damped the party which had begun long 
before the show, with happy folks dancing and spilling all over the place. 
Whether Garcia's playing was crystalline and probing, as on Dylan's "I Shall Be 
Released," or meandering out to pasture on the Roy Hamilton classic "Don't Let 
Go," it was received with relaxed approbation by a crowd bent on such criminal 
acts as seat-hopping. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing Garcia -- gray enough to be Santa, and cumbersome enough to be Idaho's 
answer to the California Raisins -- distribute his six-stringed sedatives to 
the crowd, one had to wonder: "This is what Irvine city officials view as a 
threat?" The amphitheater's yellow-jacketed security staff certainly seemed to 
be taking it all seriously, struggling to impose order on the milling Dead 
crowd, which has only been coping with itself for, what, two decades now?

BACH'S 'ST. JOHN' PASSION BY OCC SINGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY McQUILKIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were many fine things about Saturday's performance of Bach's "Passion 
According to St. John" at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa, but the one that 
remains indelibly etched in memory is tenor Thomas Randle's profoundly moving 
performance in the role of Evangelist. 
</P>
<P>
It is the Evangelist who must deliver nearly all of the narrative portion of 
the text. With the kind of conviction and persuasiveness that make the title 
evangelist wholly appropriate, Randle brought vivid drama and poignancy to the 
familiar story. His words rang out with clarity and his pronunciation of German 
was faultless. He exhibited sure technique and intelligent phrasing. And he 
sang with warmth and resonance in every register. 
</P>
<P>
Bass Hector Vasquez, in the role of Jesus and in the bass arias, brought 
commanding authority and textual clarity to his singing, showing vocal agility 
and depth of expression. Mary Rawcliffe brought well-controlled vocalism and a 
sweet, limpid sound to the soprano arias. Mezzo Candice Burrows maintained a 
dulcet, angelic tone throughout her range, though she had difficulty projecting 
over the instrumentalists. 
</P>
<P>
Less successful was bass John Ross, who sang the role of Pilate with stolid 
detachment. The minor roles, delegated to choristers, were delivered weakly. 
</P>
<P>
Under the precise leadership of conductor Richard Raub, the Orange Coast 
Chorale and Orange Coast Singers proved a well-disciplined, balanced ensemble. 
With rhythmic bite and driving energy, the singers depicted a frighteningly 
angry mob. In the chorales, Raub elicited a unified, balanced sound and telling 
contrasts. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all of the time, the orchestra proved exceptionally alert. 
</P>
<P>
In two of the arias, a pair of muted violins substituted for the violas d'amore 
indicated in Bach's score. In another aria, Edward Willett's very sensitive 
cello playing substituted for the viola da gamba. 
</P>

MAGIC NAMED MVP 2ND TIME;

<P>
JORDAN EDGED OUT IN CLOSEST VOTE IN 8 YEARS

<P>
Magic Johnson of the Lakers won his second NBA Most Valuable Player award 
today, edging out Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls in the closest voting in 
eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who won the award two years ago, received 42 1/2 first-place votes and 
664.5 points from a panel of 85 writers and broadcasters. Jordan, the 
three-time scoring champion and league MVP last season, had 27 1/2 first-place 
votes and 598.8 points. Karl Malone of the Utah Jazz was third with five 
first-place votes and 362 points. 
</P>
<P>
Each voter selected a top five and points were awarded on a 10-7-5-3-1 basis. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers point guard averaged 22.5 points, led the league in free-throw 
accuracy with a .911 percentage and was second in assists with 12.8 per game. 
He posted career highs in 3-point goals (59) and assists (988) and led Los 
Angeles to a 57-25 record and an eighth straight Pacific Division championship. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a 10-year veteran, had a league-best 17 triple-doubles and decided 
three games with buzzer-beating shots. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan averaged 32.5 points, 2/10 of a point below his career regular-season 
average. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning, that's what it's all about," Johnson said in a release from the NBA. 
"I may not be the greatest, but I'll tell you what: I've got a whole lot more 
diamonds (in championship rings) than a lot of guys who play this game and 
that's all I'm concerned about. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how I want to be remembered." 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Ewing of the New York Knicks was fourth with eight first-place votes 
and 200 points. Akeem Olajuwon of the Houston Rockets was fifth with two 
first-place votes and 179.3 points. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen players were named on at least one ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The margin of 65.7 points was the smallest since 1981, when Julius Erving of 
the Philadelphia 76ers beat Larry Bird of the Boston Celtics by 31 points. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson finished third in the MVP balloting a year ago behind Jordan and 
Boston's Bird. 
</P>
<P>
"Magic is the best player around; I don't think there's any question about 
that," Laker Coach Pat Riley said. "He's a winner. He does whatever is needed 
to win." 
</P>
<P>
Since joining the Lakers in 1979, Johnson has helped them win five NBA titles, 
including consecutive championships in 1987 and 1988. The Lakers, bidding for 
three in a row, now are ahead 1-0 in their Western Conference title round 
against the Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
The Laker guard suffered a partially torn left hamstring Feb. 8 and missed the 
All-Star Game. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question in my mind that Magic Johnson is the best player in the 
game and the best player I've ever seen," said Bird, Johnson's rival going back 
to their NCAA championship game in 1979. "He plays the game the way I like to 
see people play and the way I like to play. He rebounds, passes, is a leader -- 
whatever it takes, that's what he does to win basketball games." 
</P>
<P>
Detroit Pistons Coach Chuck Daly praised Johnson as a "coach's dream." 
</P>
<P>
"He can dominate any game from any position he wants to," Daly said.

HARVARD STUDENT RAZO SAYS HE CONFESSED CRIME WHILE ON DRUGS 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jose Razo, the Harvard University student accused of a dozen armed robberies in 
1987, told a hushed courtroom in Santa Ana this morning that he feigned 
confessions to the crimes because he was high on drugs and believed that he was 
Jesus Christ. 
</P>
<P>
Razo, 22, an honors student and athlete, became the first defense witness in 
his trial in Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
His attorney, John Barnett, earlier told jurors that the defense would counter 
Razo's confessions by showing that he had been using the mind-altering drug 
PCP. The defense attorney also told jurors that Razo was fascinated with the 
criminal mind, which he had studied at college. 
</P>
<P>
When called to the stand, Razo was asked why he first called La Habra police, a 
contact that eventually led to his confession. Razo said he had been using 
drugs and "I felt I was Christ. I felt I had the ability to ask for anything I 
wanted."

Striking teachers returned to the picket lines and more than half the students 
in the Los Angeles Unified School District continued to stay out of classes 
today as the district's teacher walkout entered its second week. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles school board members began closed-door meetings this morning and 
striking teachers staged a massive rally at the Los Angeles Sports Arena, but 
no new talks between the two sides are planned. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the district and representatives of United Teachers-Los 
Angeles broke off Sunday with union leaders charging the school board with bad 
faith bargaining. The district has offered teachers a 21.5% pay hike over three 
years with the possibility of an additional 2.5% increase for the next school 
year. The teachers are asking for a guaranteed 26% pay increase over three 
years as well as a stronger voice in how schools are run.

MAN DIES AFTER FIGHT WITH OFFICERS

<TEXT>
<P>
A young man who "quit breathing" after a struggle with Santa Ana police 
officers who were trying to detain him following an apparently drug-induced 
rampage died today at a Fountain Valley hospital, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The man, whose identity was not immediately known, was pronounced dead at 4:47 
a.m. at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center where he was taken 
after struggling with several Santa Ana officers shortly after 7 a.m. Sunday, 
said Santa Ana police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Police had responded to complaints from several residents in the 1600 block of 
West Brook Street that a man was running across their rooftops, tearing down 
television antennas and "behaving in a wild and bizarre manner," Thomas said. 
The man was detained at gunpoint by one of the residents whose home the man had 
entered, brandishing a butcher knife. When police arrived a few minutes later, 
they attempted to subdue the man without using their weapons, Thomas said. A 
fierce struggle ensued, after which the man stopped breathing and Santa Ana 
fire paramedics were called. An autopsy is to be performed later today.

Richard V. Secord, a former Air Force major general, pleaded innocent today to 
charges of concealing from Congress more than $1 million in profits he 
allegedly pocketed by selling arms to Iran and the Nicaraguan Contra 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors and defense attorneys said at Secord's arraignment before U.S. 
District Court Chief Judge Aubrey Robinson that they will discuss whether to 
combine the latest set of charges with an earlier indictment. A hearing on the 
question will be held May 31. Secord was released on his own recognizance.

Former President Ronald Reagan told an audience of convention goers Sunday that 
President Bush has been treated unfairly -- in part because his predecessor 
accomplished so much. 
</P>
<P>
"George Bush has been a major part of everything we've done these last eight 
years. . . . It's just a case of him not having anything startling to introduce 
so far," Reagan, now a speaker-for-hire, said at one of the nation's largest 
trade shows, the National Restaurant Assn. and Hotel and Motel Show. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan said Bush's problem is that so much was accomplished by the Reagan 
Administration that there were few areas that need shoring up right away. He 
added that because of this, Bush has received unfair treatment, presumably in 
the form of press reviews criticizing the Administration's seeming lack of 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
He said what Bush needs -- and what he himself would be fighting for if he were 
still President -- is a line-item veto on the budget and a constitutional rein 
on congressional spending, which Reagan maintains is the source of the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan did not attempt to address the political upheaval in China or any other 
foreign policy issue but stuck to his anti-communist, pro-democracy posture in 
brief references to Panama and the Soviet Union.

Pope John Paul II has appealed to U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de 
Cuellar and 16 heads of state to take urgent steps to prevent the destruction 
of Lebanon, the Vatican said today. 
</P>
<P>
Vatican officials issued the text of a May 15 letter in which the Pope said the 
"very existence of Lebanon is now in danger." 
</P>
<P>
He told the heads of state of Israel, Syria and other Middle East nations that 
Lebanon is undergoing an intense and painful process of destruction. "We find 
ourselves facing a threat to the entire order of international life. It is a 
moral threat all the more sorrowful because a weaker state is subject to the 
violence of those stronger than itself," he said.

House Speaker Jim Wright, under fire for allegedly using his position for 
personal gain, climbed out of debt last year, according to a financial 
disclosure statement released today. 
</P>
<P>
The forms showed that the Texas Democrat paid off debts of between $105,000 and 
$200,000 and now has no liabilities, but his assets also declined. He listed 
1988 assets of $31,005 to $100,000 -- compared with between $155,000 and 
$435,000 the year before. 
</P>
<P>
House members and senators must annually report their outside income, including 
speaking fees -- known as honorariums -- gifts, assets and liabilities. The 
reports of most of the 435 House members were released today; the Senate's were 
released last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TV Comedy Careers 
</P>
<P>
The forms included those of two members of the House who had previous careers 
in television comedies and a former baseball player. 
</P>
<P>
Former actor Fred Grandy (R-Iowa) reported $20,021 in residual income from "The 
Love Boat," the long-running series in which he played Gopher, a skirt-chasing 
officer on a cruise ship. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Jones (D-Ga.) reported $11,212 in residuals. Jones appeared on the "Dukes 
of Hazzard." 
</P>
<P>
Republican Jim Bunning of Kentucky, a former pitcher, got a $350 royalty check 
from the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Brown (R-Colo.) listed not only his own income but that of his wife and 
three teen-age children. Christy Brown, 19, made $1,600 working in another 
congressman's office and $295 for baby-sitting and yard work. Her sister Lori, 
17, worked in a movie theater for $1,547 and earned $367 for baby-sitting and 
16-year-old Harry got $370 for yard work. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Nighthorse Campbell (D-Colo.) earned $5,000 for his jewelry designs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ethics Rules 
</P>
<P>
Speaker Wright has been charged with violating House ethics rules for 
activities that include getting abnormally high royalties from bulk sales of a 
book and for his financial relationship with Ft. Worth developer George 
Mallick. 
</P>
<P>
Wright reported no more book earnings last year, but he paid off a note worth 
between $50,000 and $100,000 from Mallightco, Inc., the partnership he formed 
with Mallick. 
</P>
<P>
He listed owning less than $5,000 worth of stock in Jewell Enterprises, a 
nursing home operation that has also drawn the attention of the House Ethics 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Investments and $30,000 in speaking fees brought Wright's income up to a range 
of $188,183 to $203,579, nearly doubling his Speaker's salary of $115,000. He 
reported receiving no gifts.

Defense Secretary Dick Cheney promised visiting Israeli Defense Minister

"Mr. Rabin expressed an interest in seeing that the United States maintain its

Cheney met for more than an hour at the Defense Department, and Cheney "said he 
would do his best."

<P>
The Bush Administration has asked Congress to keep total U.S. aid to Israel at 
its current level in fiscal 1990, beginning in October -- $1.8 billion in 
military assistance and $1.2 billion in economic support.

Holly Farms Corp. shares rose sharply today after it agreed to a sweetened 
$1.3-billion buyout by agricultural products conglomerate ConAgra Inc., 
apparently ending a long-running takeover saga for the chicken producer. 
</P>
<P>
Holly stock jumped $3.875 to $66.50, reacting to the new ConAgra offer, 
announced Sunday, which works out to about $70 per share. 
</P>
<P>
Another bidder, Tyson Foods Inc., the nation's largest seller of chickens, said 
it will press forward with its lower buyout offer of $63.50 a share but did not 
signal any immediate plans to try to top ConAgra's higher offer. 
</P>
<P>
ConAgra came in as a white knight for Holly after Tyson made its uninvited bid 
in October.

WHITE HOUSE TRIES TO REIN IN HIGH-FLYING DOLLAR BUT IT RISES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration sought today to dispel doubts about its commitment to 
stable exchange rates but failed to rein in the high-flying dollar, which 
surged to its highest level in 2 1/2 years against the West German mark. 
</P>
<P>
"If the dollar's recent rise against other major currencies is sustained for a 
prolonged period or extended it could undermine international efforts to reduce 
global trade imbalances," White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the rally, which carried the dollar above 2.00 marks today for the 
first time since December, 1986, is "a matter of concern." 
</P>
<P>
Until today the Bush Administration had remained silent about the dollar, 
fueling speculation that it is willing to tolerate a higher level in order to 
restrain U.S. inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The statement appeared to be tied to a late-morning selloff of dollars by the 
Federal Reserve in international currency markets, traders and analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar also broke through the barrier of 140 Japanese yen for the first 
time since October, 1987, despite dollar sales by the Bank of Japan that 
dealers estimated at more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve and several central banks in Europe subsequently sold 
dollars, too, but the impact was marginal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Change of Policy 
</P>
<P>
In early afternoon the dollar was trading around 2.01 marks, down from the 
day's high of 2.0165 but up sharply from 1.9770 at Friday's close in New York. 
It was also quoted at 142 yen, down from a high of 142.90 but up from 139 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Popadiuk acknowledged that the dollar's strength has led to questions about the 
Bush Administration's commitment to economic policy coordination among the 
Group of Seven industrial nations to maintain steady exchange rates within 
fairly broad, unpublicized ranges. 
</P>
<P>
But he said there has been no change of policy. "The Administration remains 
fully committed to this process." 
</P>
<P>
A rising dollar makes imported goods cheaper and dampens the U.S. economy by 
pricing some exports out of world markets. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh questions about the U.S. attitude to the dollar were raised by a New York 
Times article today that said some unidentified non-Treasury officials favored 
more flexible target ranges so that market forces could play more of a role. 
</P>
<P>
Although Popadiuk did not refer directly to the article, Treasury officials 
said his statement was drafted as a denial of the story, which added to demand 
for the greenback. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Will Continue Our Efforts' 
</P>
<P>
"The President and the secretary of the Treasury remain the Administration's 
sole spokesmen on the dollar and exchange rate policy," Popadiuk said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the United States "will continue our efforts to strengthen underlying 
policies that promote the adjustment of external imbalances as well as 
cooperating in exchange markets as agreed in the April G-7 communique." 
</P>
<P>
Finance ministers and central bankers from the United States, Japan, West 
Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy agreed in Washington on April 2 that 
a rise in the dollar that undermined the correction of trade imbalances, or an 
excessive decline, would be "counterproductive." 
</P>
<P>
By keeping the dollar within fairly narrow ranges since the so-called "Louvre 
accord" of February, 1987, the G-7 has helped to create the conditions for a 
slow but steady reduction in the U.S. trade deficit, which fell to $120 billion 
last year from $152 billion in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But by piercing the 2.00-mark and 140-yen levels the dollar has burst through 
the ceilings of the Louvre pact, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the rise is reversed, they said, the improvement in trade will stall, 
fanning protectionist sentiment in Congress and thus raising the risk of a 
contraction in world trade that could even usher in a global recession.

Warner Communications Inc. said today it settled a longstanding dispute with 
its largest shareholder, clearing another potential obstacle to the 
entertainment company's planned $18-billion merger with Time Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The shareholder, Chris-Craft Industries Inc., joined Time and Warner in 
announcing the settlement that the companies said would permit the Time merger 
with Warner to proceed "without any delay or adjustment." 
</P>
<P>
Warner and Chris-Craft had entered an agreement in 1984 in which they acquired 
stakes in each other in what was seen as a defensive maneuver by Warner to 
avoid a hostile takeover. 
</P>
<P>
But in the years since the pact was signed, relations soured between Warner and 
Chris-Craft and there was some concern it could delay the proposed Warner 
merger with Time. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Warner sued Chris-Craft, seeking an order that would have 
compelled Chris-Craft to resolve any objections to the merger. That litigation 
was resolved under today's settlement.

Roulette wheels came to rest and the last card was turned onto the blackjack 
felt at Elsinore's Atlantis Casino Hotel today as it became the first New 
Jersey casino closed under state order. 
</P>
<P>
When dealer Stan Kowal dealt his last hand at 3:47 a.m., more state gaming 
regulators were in the casino than customers, and gamblers were saying "Good 
luck" to Atlantis employees. 
</P>
<P>
The state Casino Control Commission last week determined that the gaming hall's 
$144-million debt was too big a risk to the industry's integrity to allow 
continued play on Atlantis' three-tiered casino floor. 
</P>
<P>
Only subtle signs indicated that casino employees were working their last 
shift. A blackjack dealer taped a small "goodby" note to his table, and some 
floor supervisors wore black-tinged carnations. 
</P>
<P>
At the craps table, Larry Fishman threw out the last set of dice. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoyed myself here for seven years," he said. "I wanted to do it for 
sentimental reasons, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
Atlantis has been plagued with financial problems since 1981, when it opened as 
the Playboy Hotel &amp; Casino. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1985, Atlantis filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, but 
when a reorganization plan was finally implemented in September, 1988, the 
losses continued to mount. 
</P>
<P>
The state Division of Gaming Enforcement, the arm of the state attorney 
general's office that polices the industry, reported that the Atlantis was 
losing money at the rate of $56,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
At the division's recommendation, the commission voted in April not to renew 
Atlantis' regular casino license and appointed a conservator. 
</P>
<P>
At least 1,000 of the hotel's 2,000 workers are affected by the casino closing. 
</P>
<P>
Near the slot machines, mechanics gathered to console each other this morning. 
</P>
<P>
"Ordinarily, we'd be fixing machines, but it doesn't matter now," said one 
mechanic who would identify himself only as John. "It took me a year and a half 
to get this job, and now I'm out looking again."

out 48 bids for its 43rd annual Division I tournament, inviting Arizona State, 
last year's runner-up, and seven Florida schools. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always tough when you have a two-time defending national champion. They 
finished strong, but the bottom line was the overall record," said Gene 
McArter, head of the NCAA baseball committee. "They dug a hole early on and 
weren't able to overcome it."

Stanford, which won nine of its last 10 games, finished the year at 30-28 but 
posted a losing record against Division I competition.

its record-setting 35th appearance; Florida State for the 27th time; USC for

<P>

The father of New York Yankees designated hitter Ken Phelps is in serious 
condition today following a heart attack he suffered during a Yankees game 
against the Seattle Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
Len Phelps, 82, was behind home plate at the Kingdome when he collapsed Sunday 
afternoon. A man sitting next to Phelps pulled him into the aisle and 
administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 
</P>
<P>
"I noticed his face was turning red and his tongue was purple so I knew he was 
having a heart attack," said Sean Alderman, a ski patrolman in Mammoth 
Mountain, Calif. "I've done CPR before with the ski patrol, and it took four 
sessions of pumping on his chest. Then he coughed and I knew he was ready to 
breath." Medics revived Phelps and took him to Harborview Medical Center.

Kentucky basketball center LeRon Ellis announced after a meeting with the 
school's athletics director today that he will not attend the university next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis talked with Athletics Director C. M. Newton and sports information 
officials before confirming his decision at an impromptu news conference. 
</P>
<P>
The sophomore standout said he did not know where he will go to school for his 
remaining two years of eligibility. He played in 32 games for Kentucky this 
last season and averaged 16 points and five rebounds per game. The 6-foot-10, 
225-pounder from Tustin, Calif., was a second team All-Southeastern Conference 
selection by the Associated Press this year. 
</P>
<P>
Under NCAA rules, Ellis may transfer to another NCAA school without losing any 
eligibility because of sanctions imposed against the Wildcats last week. The 
sanctions for alleged NCAA rules violations included placing the basketball 
program on probation for three years, a ban on post-season play for two years 
and a one-year ban on live television appearances.
