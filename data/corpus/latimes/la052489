A March of the Homeless on Malibu? 
</P>
<P>
Rush Limbaugh, a New York-based radio talk show host, has decreed Saturday as 
the day to challenge Honorary Mayor Martin Sheen's declaration of Malibu as a 
sanctuary for the dispossessed. 
</P>
<P>
Limbaugh, whose show is heard on 125 stations, including KFI in Los Angeles, 
said he has 15 buses available. He's offering free transportation to the "left 
coast," as he calls it, but hasn't figured out where the vehicles would park. 
</P>
<P>
When he asked a spokeswoman for the Malibu Chamber of Commerce, she said, 
"There's no place for them here," and then hung up. 
</P>
<P>
Sheen, who is in Canada directing a movie, has condemned "irresponsible media 
personalities who have abused their power to gain ratings by treading on misery 
and suffering." 
</P>
<P>
Limbaugh, who said he embraces programs aimed at making the homeless 
self-reliant rather than giving them handouts, said his intention is not to 
embarrass Malibu or the homeless but to "discredit Sheen." 
</P>
<P>
One place that definitely hasn't opened its arms to the homeless is a 
convenience store in Hollywood, which has posted the following sign: 
</P>
<P>
"7-Eleven and its neighbors would appreciate it if you would refrain from 
giving to panhandlers and solicitors in front of stores or in the parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
However, a controversy involving a different group appears to have ended. 
</P>
<P>
Venice is welcoming back skateboarders and roller-skaters. 
</P>
<P>
A bill that would legalize the two activities on Ocean Front Walk was 
introduced Tuesday by City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, a few days after the 
city Department of Transportation caused an uproar by posting signs that banned 
the wheeled performers. The signs -- since removed -- cited a city ordinance 
that was passed in 1980 and promptly forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
Venice activist Jerry Rubin said that when the council debates the issue next 
Tuesday, he will be present along with such local celebrities as 65-year-old 
Liv Bevington, better known as Skateboard Mama, and Harry Perry, who plans to 
skate into the chamber while playing his guitar. 
</P>
<P>
Here, in Hypeville, one must be careful about certain claims. . . . 
</P>
<P>
But Melissa Miller has a copy of the police report to prove that she's serious 
when she says that someone filched a fiberglass figure of Batman in his 
Batmobile from the front of her Westside collectibles store, Made in America. 
</P>
<P>
Miller isn't sure whether the theft of the 6-foot-long sculpture was the work 
of a joker. Or, perhaps, the Joker. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of jokers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
After the county Board of Supervisors approved the construction of an office 
tower across the street from Times Mirror Square, conservative Supervisor Pete 
Schabarum, who has been criticized on occasion by this newspaper, said:

"Maybe we can bury the Times editorial staff in the footing."

PLANS FOR $425-MILLION RESORT IN MISSION BAY'S DE ANZA COVE OUTLINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal to turn a section of De Anza Cove in Mission Bay into a $425-million 
tourist resort with hotels, shops, public bicycle and jogging paths, a 13-acre 
botanical garden and an improved golf course was unveiled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The plan by the Beverly Hills-based De Anza Group, which operates a mobile-home 
park and campground on the property earmarked for development, would require 
approval of the City Council and a change in state law because the land is 
designated as public tideland. 
</P>
<P>
The De Anza Group now holds leases with the city for the park and campground 
and would need to have them renegotiated for another 50 years, to the year 
2053, in order for construction of the resort to occur. 
</P>
<P>
Such an extension would also need the concurrence of the Legislature, which in 
the early 1980s placed restrictions on the length of the leases. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$125 Million for 1st Phase 
</P>
<P>
If the approvals are made, the first phase of construction would begin as early 
as 1992 and would consist of 400 hotel rooms, two miles of bike and jogging 
paths around the bay, retail shops beside Rose Creek and a bridge over it, and 
improvement to the Mission Bay Golf Course, which the De Anza Group is in 
escrow to buy. This first phase would cost $125 million, according to the 
developer. 
</P>
<P>
The second phase would cost $300 million and would include 1,000 more hotel 
rooms, the botanical garden, a cultural arts center, shoreline park areas, open 
space and a greenbelt. This phase of construction would occur after 2003. 
</P>
<P>
That's a key date because that's when the current lease on the De Anza Harbor 
Resort trailer park expires, and the 1,000 residents who make the park their 
home would be gone. In a complex arrangement negotiated over 19 months, the De 
Anza Group has promised to stabilize rents at the trailer park until 2003 and 
to pay for both the tenants' equity in their mobile homes and their relocation 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
"The critical component was the needs of the residents," said Michael Gelfand, 
De Anza Group's senior vice president. For years, residents of the mobile home 
park, most of whom are older than 65 -- though young families also live there 
-- have feared that commercial development of the park would lead to their 
early "economic eviction," despite their leases, which stretch into the next 
century. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Back 1st Phase 
</P>
<P>
Ted Ball, a resident of the park and president of the park's chapter of the 
Golden State Mobilehome Owners League, said a majority of residents supports 
the first phase of the construction plan, which would occur while those living 
in the 510 mobile-home spaces are still there. 
</P>
<P>
Ball characterized the compromise agreement as an adequate safeguard for the 
residents. Key points of the agreement, he said, include a reaffirmation that 
residents can stay until 2003; "predictable and reasonable" rent increases; the 
construction of a new clubhouse and swimming pool if Phase 1 of construction 
occurs; the developer paying for moving about 115 mobile homes affected by 
construction to other parts of the park, and a pledge by the developer to pay 
for relocation expenses and equity in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
Gelfand declined to say how much it will cost his company to take care of the 
residents, but he said it would cost the city of San Diego about $25 million to 
do the same thing. The city would be on the hook for the expenses, according to 
Gelfand, because of existing state law governing the closure of mobile-home 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, the city as landlord of the tidelands would be forced to pay to 
relocate the residents when the lease expires in November, 2003, Gelfand said. 
In lobbying for its plan and renegotiated leases, the De Anza Group emphasized 
that, without such approvals, the city faces a $25-million expenditure. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bruce Henderson represents the area encompassed by the proposal. He 
was not available for comment Tuesday, but a spokesman said his office hasn't 
had time to analyze the proposal and has no position on it. The spokesman said 
Henderson has been concerned about the fate of the mobile-home residents and 
had been involved in an earlier rent-protection agreement. He also said that a 
final decision may be a few years away. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plan to Consolidate 3 Leases 
</P>
<P>
Although the mobile-home park would eventually cease to exist under the De Anza 
Group's proposal, the affordable Campland on the Bay site, used by campers and 
recreational vehicles, would be reduced by two-thirds, from 900 spaces to 300. 
The lease for Campland on the Bay doesn't expire until 2017, but the De Anza 
Group's plan is to consolidate all three leases -- for the mobile-home park, 
the campground and golf course, which would be upgraded and kept open to the 
public -- into one lease expiring in 2053. 
</P>
<P>
Gelfand stressed that his company's proposal would provide significantly 
expanded public access to Mission Bay, would rehabilitate parts of Rose Creek 
and wouldn't make traffic worse in already congested Pacific Beach. He claimed 
that, as a destination resort, traffic generated by the development would be 
minimal and that the construction of a new bridge over Rose Creek would help 
circulation in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want people to think we're rushing into this," said Gelfand, 
explaining that his company hopes to circulate its proposal in the Pacific 
Beach community and elsewhere and reach a consensus of support. "We want to 
take this to the community to get their input . . . so that what we propose 
makes sense." 
</P>
<P>
A first step in that process will occur tonight, when the plan is outlined at a 
Pacific Beach Town Council meeting.

STILL SOUND ADVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the Bush Administration's most definitive Middle East policy statement so 
far, Secretary of State James A. Baker III has called on Israel and the 
Palestinians to change the status quo and move toward political accommodation 
as a prelude to eventually making peace. On a policy level Baker for the most 
part was simply restating what successive U.S. administrations have been saying 
for more than 20 years. The difference came in his tone. Speaking before the 
American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the pro-Israel lobbying group that 
has had considerable influence on Congress, Baker spoke plainly, almost 
bluntly, about the principles the United States supports as part of the peace 
process. 
</P>
<P>
To Israel, Baker said the time has come to abandon the unrealistic vision of a 
Greater Israel that would incorporate the West Bank and Gaza Strip with their 
more than 1.7 million Palestinians. Israel instead must face the probability 
that one day it will have to trade land for peace. Given that eventuality 
Israeli settlement activity should be halted, and such accommodating steps as 
reopening West Bank schools should be taken. The land-for-peace idea, though 
anathema to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is, of course, a restatement not only 
of U.S. policy but also the Israeli Labor Party's position. 
</P>
<P>
To Palestinians, Baker said the Palestine Liberation Organization should amend 
its charter to delete the vicious call for Israel's elimination. He urged 
Palestinians at the same time to show that they are serious in their diplomacy, 
the clear implication being that Washington so far has not perceived that to be 
the case. Violence, he said, will not work. Finally -- and as always, a key 
point -- "no one is going to deliver Israel for you." The achievement of peace, 
security and Palestinian political rights won't come about through imposition 
by outsiders, but only as a result of compromises, concessions, good faith, 
direct negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The Baker speech contained no new ideas. But it was a timely and necessary 
reaffirmation of basic policy principles, expressed in a context that makes 
clear that the Bush Administration regards the Israel-Palestinian status quo as 
unacceptable and increasingly damaging. Washington is again calling on both 
sides to bend. That advice is relevant, realistic and sound.

THREADS OF A SETTLEMENT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles school board and the teachers' union should stop calling each 
other liars and start settling the strike. Bits and pieces of an agreement can 
be discerned here and there in the public and private pronouncements of board 
members, union leaders and teachers. It's time to pull them together into a 
firm contract so that thousands of students can return to fully staffed 
classrooms where they belong. 
</P>
<P>
There is a hard and ugly edge to the strike now. Tempers flare on picket lines. 
Friendships erode as some teachers work while others walk. Board members are 
clearly at odds. Negotiators for both parties cannot agree on what's been 
offered. Still, leaders on both sides have to focus on the emerging outline of 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
There should be great appeal in the idea of a pay settlement of 24% over three 
years, whether or not it has been formally proposed. Teachers would get a raise 
of almost one-fourth their current inadequate salaries. The district would get 
the three-year contract it wants, so that it does not have to go through this 
again soon. It's enough of a win-win situation that each side should be 
content. 
</P>
<P>
The question of reimbursing teachers for pay docked when they withheld services 
earlier in the school year could be settled by splitting the amount down the 
middle. The teachers felt they should be paid for extra duties. The district 
felt it should not give teachers full pay if they did not perform duties they 
have traditionally performed, such as turning in students' grades. Both were at 
least half right. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the questions of preparation periods for elementary school 
teachers and representation on management councils at each school. Certainly 
elementary school teachers should have 40 minutes a day at school to work on 
materials for their students. Why can't the cost of this provision be made 
contingent on getting extra state money, which now appears available to the 
schools? As for management groups, as long as state law makes the school board 
responsible for the schools, the district is entitled at least to equal 
representation on these councils. 
</P>
<P>
The school board does not need to have all its members present at negotiations, 
as United Teachers-Los Angeles President Wayne Johnson suggests, in order to 
reach this kind of agreement. That should not be a condition of settlement. If 
the teams in place can reach this kind of agreement -- and we think they can if 
they want to -- perhaps this strike will finally be over and students can get 
back to work.

TRASH PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial "Bradley's Trash Plan" (April 29) correctly addresses the urgent 
need for implementation of a citywide recycling plan. 
</P>
<P>
However, your support for paying for such a plan out of the city's general 
revenues would continue to hide the extent of our waste management crisis from 
the average Los Angeles resident who has come to regard anything to do with 
trash disposal as "free." 
</P>
<P>
With each local resident producing a ton and a half of trash annually, and all 
major landfills serving the city reaching capacity or scheduled for closure 
within two to three years, it is imperative that people are made aware of the 
actual cost of our "throwaway" society. 
</P>
<P>
Only then will we be able to garner universal support for reform of our waste 
management system which must include changes in our behavior as consumers as 
well as individual commitment to recycling. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to increase public awareness, I have introduced Assembly Bill 1101 
which will require that every household in the state be notified quarterly of 
its share of the costs associated with collection, transportation and disposal 
of solid waste produced by all residential households in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with this information, the average citizen will have a greater incentive 
to become actively involved in reducing his or her contribution to the 39 
million tons of trash we are currently generating annually in California.

<P>
So far President Bush has displayed an uneven mentality in his conduct of the 
nation's business, an irrational act sometimes succeeded by one that logically 
addresses its consequences. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent example of such behavior has to do with his anti-crime stance. 
Starting off with a benediction for the National Rifle Assn. and its "an 
assault rifle for every red-blooded American with the guts to spill it with" 
policy, President Bush then proposes $1 billion in funding to house an 
estimated 26,000 new benefactors-operators of these ease-of-purchase murder 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Not so! cry the cabal of insular conservatives in his Administration, 
stridently proclaiming that assault weapons are only intended for legitimate 
sportsmen. However, neither George nor the NRA have ever sought to define a 
"legitimate sportsman." 
</P>
<P>
But interestingly enough, since they both subscribe weapons of war as being 
appropriate to his use, it's got to mean that the sportsman is licensed 
(inferentially, if not by forthright edict) to hunt anything on four legs. Or 
two.

"Bush to ask $1 Billion for New Prisons, No Assault Rifle Ban," read one of 
your Page 1 headlines (May 15), revealing to all what a clever plan-ahead guy 
President Bush is: Allow the import and sale of murderous assault rifles, but, 
in order to house the resulting murderous assaulters, spend $1 billion on new 
prisons. 
</P>
<P>
The only problem is, at the rate the nation's gun toters are popping off the

LET TEACHERS SHARE OUR PROSPERITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD H. GOTTLIEB, Gerald H. Gottlieb in a Los Angeles attorney who 
specializes in anti-trust and civil-rights law. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The national interest and the need to create a fair economic package for our 
public school teachers require that we take a fresh look public school strike 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Let's get away from the question that leads nowhere: Who loves the children 
most, the striking teachers and their union, or the school district 
administrators and their negotiators? Let us, instead, turn to matters of the 
public interest and the salary issue. 
</P>
<P>
The first teacher salary demand was for an increase of 21% over the next two 
years on average, 10.5% each year. Later, Wayne Johnson, president of the 
United Teachers of Los Angeles, reduced the demand to a 26% overall increase 
during the next three years on average, about 8.5% per year. The union thus 
eased its demand despite learning of an unforeseen tax surplus of $2.5 billion 
which has now accrued to the state, and which is largely earmarked for public 
education. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Board of Education's position on salary, as best it can now be 
gleaned, is the offer of a 24% increase over the next three years, or an 
average of 8% per year. 
</P>
<P>
Although salary seems to be at the center of the dispute, other policy factors 
deserve mention. First, these times find the economic prognosticators in 
disagreement regarding the danger of severe inflation -- which to the extent it 
occurs can wipe out any benefit expected from a salary increase. Housing costs 
already have skyrocketed. 
</P>
<P>
This is a time when teaching should be one of the nation's top priorities. We 
spend less money per capita on education than does any other industrialized 
democracy. The disparity is close to a national disgrace. And yet we must 
compete against the very countries that outspend us in education to train 
children for future markets. We must help our children to build their skills to 
a level that will elevate this country's production of quality goods and 
services. Only by so doing will we succeed in the long-range competition on 
which this nation's prosperity and economic health depends. 
</P>
<P>
For this reason alone, public judgment ought to coalesce and take shape as a 
local and national resolve to make the teaching profession the best that it can 
be: That means we must insist that teachers be provided with income befitting 
their critical role and important professional responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
A glance at the domestic scene confirms the soundness of such resolve. In 
certain sectors of American society we are going through a lush period. Eleven 
of the highest-paid executives in 354 companies last year received between 
$10.9 million and $40 million each. Also, the average member of that top class 
of executives is receiving $2 million or more annually. 
</P>
<P>
The contrast between teachers and chief executive officers is startling. In 
1988, the average salary of those 700-odd CEOs rose to 72 times the average 
salary of a schoolteacher. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the teachers form the cutting edge of our educational system. The teachers 
serve the children; the school administrators and the educational hierarchy 
should be deemed to serve the teachers. The relationship should be comparable 
to the way a public hospital administrator serves the hospital physicians who 
in turn treat the patients. The public concern ought to focus on how teachers 
and teacher morale can be supported and top teacher talent attracted. Teachers 
should be allowed to concentrate not so much on the struggle to make ends meet, 
but to make the children ready to meet the challenges of adult life in an 
increasingly challenging world. 
</P>
<P>
There is one more circumstance that should be mentioned. The board has 
customarily maintained a salary pyramid. The essence of that arrangement is a 
guarantee that any time the teachers get a raise, the administrators, with 
salaries already markedly higher than the average teacher, will see their pay 
go up further, not by an equal amount of dollars, but by an equal percentage. 
When the teachers move up, the administrators move up faster. In effect, the 
board guarantees that our teachers will never catch up. 
</P>
<P>
The public interest requires that we bring the teachers up to economic levels 
consistent with their professional obligations, start to close the gap between 
teachers and administrators and thereby serve national objectives and goals. 
The board should accept the union's modest proposal for a salary increase and 
end the strike.

L.A. MUST TAKE A STAND ON SCHOOLS

<P>
The lessons of the Los Angeles teachers' strike, now in its second week, have 
been difficult to learn. But given some attention, they can have lasting 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Students have learned that they truly prefer to go to class and do their 
schoolwork rather than play hooky and hang out at the mall. A comment from a 
student at Manual Arts High School is typical of those being heard across the 
school district: "I want school back to normal." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers have learned to stand up for their dignity. This new-found energy will 
undoubtedly make them better teachers when they return to the classroom. They 
will bring new lessons about union activism, about personal anger, about the 
attributes of a democratic society, about values and about relationships with 
people. The students, too, will benefit from these lessons. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Leonard Britton has learned what it takes to run the Los Angeles Unified 
School District. Never again will he be accused of being a newcomer, or being 
unfamiliar with life in Los Angeles. The lesson only clarifies the challenge he 
has ahead of him, most particularly the challenge of making the word unified a 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Education has perhaps had the hardest lesson, and I am not sure we 
have learned it. Working with a restricted, politicized budget makes it 
difficult to care intensely about improving working conditions for teachers, 
improving the level of instruction, providing safe schools and raising the 
quality of education for children of all races and nationalities. The clearly 
outlined box of funds inevitably pits one concern against another. In order to 
provide for one priority, you must forgo another. The choice is not easy or 
final. 
</P>
<P>
The contract negotiations that have lasted so long are only a reflection of the 
difficulty the board and its seven individual members have had in making clear 
choices. And it is a no-win situation. Four votes can resolve to make one 
priority more important than another. The consequence is that the three losing 
members can label the majority as "anti-teacher" or "anti-children." This 
school district cannot survive for the present or for the future on such 
win-lose decisions. This community will not move forward socially or 
economically with such a "we against them" environment in its public schools. 
</P>
<P>
This brings me to the lessons learned by the community. The most obvious is 
that Los Angeles cares about its schools. During the strike, you have not been 
able to ride the bus, lunch at a restaurant or go to a movie without hearing 
comments and opinions about contract negotiations. Numerous unscientific 
surveys have been taken on which side is right. 
</P>
<P>
The second clear lesson is that Los Angeles does not like and does not want a 
teacher strike. School district offices have received hundreds of calls, but 
the message is the same -- settle the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
But the community has not been a player in this drama. The average citizen is 
not involved in our schools. We have not done a good job of informing parents, 
students, business people, civic volunteers and other interested individuals 
about how schools are funded, how negotiations take place and what role the 
city can play in shaping school policies. 
</P>
<P>
This lack of understanding has allowed those on both sides of the strike to 
take hard-line positions without the support of the community. The teachers' 
union President Wayne Johnson has said that "teachers are prepared for the 
siege. The district's crippled schools may be closed for the rest of the 
(school) year." School Board President Roberta Weintraub quotes the 
fact-finder's report, which concluded that the district's offer is the best in 
the country. Striking teachers rally that they will not capitulate. Substitute 
teachers resolve that they are doing the best for the children by keeping the 
classroom open. 
</P>
<P>
Wake up, Los Angeles. These are our schools, these are our children. We cannot 
afford to not know how much money the district has, we cannot afford to ignore 
the politics of those on both sides of this issue, and we cannot afford to be 
absent from the negotiations. We can have higher teacher salaries. But we will 
also have to accept budget cuts in reading programs, textbooks and school 
maintenance. In the end, one side will win, one side will lose. 
</P>
<P>
When a sufficient number of community members (parents, business leaders, state 
legislators, the state schools superintendent, community organizations and the 
media) choose a side, we will know which side is the winner. At that point, the 
contract dispute will be resolved. From there, we can move forward -- perhaps 
with a new resolve to be involved in our schools in such as way as to know that 
this city's future success, or its demise, will be in the classrooms.

<P>
PISTONS START ENGINES AND EVEN SERIES; 
</P>
<P>
DETROIT DOES NOT LEAVE HOME WITHOUT A VICTORY, 100-91 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

AUBURN HILLS, Mich. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The big picture, as some would put it, for the Detroit Pistons was that they 
defeated the Chicago Bulls, 100-91, Tuesday night at the Palace of Auburn 
Hills, overcoming the ejection of center Bill Laimbeer, riding Isiah Thomas' 33 
points and tying the National Basketball Assn.'s Eastern Conference 
championship series at 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons -- as their coach, Chuck Daly, put it -- were in "intensive care," 
but checked themselves out. 
</P>
<P>
Daly was breathing easy, happy to have kept from getting swept at home, and 
happy to have caught the Bulls on a night when Michael Jordan and Bill 
Cartwright were weakened by flu and a night when Scottie Pippen had to miss the 
game's final 13 minutes with an injured foot. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of drawing four technical fouls and doing nothing to stop 
Chicago forward Horace Grant from getting 20 rebounds, Daly seemed satisfied 
with the Pistons' play. Winning was the important thing. Another loss would 
have made their care even more intensive. 
</P>
<P>
So, this was the headline story for Detroit -- getting even. 
</P>
<P>
However, there was a subplot. 
</P>
<P>
A small picture, if you will. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, the team captain, said he thinks the Pistons are playing lousy. He does 
not know why. He wants to know why. He called a team meeting, No Coaches 
Allowed, immediately after Tuesday's game, to try to find out why. 
</P>
<P>
When the meeting ended, there was a look on his face as though Detroit had just 
been beaten by, oh, Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not like the way we're playing," Thomas said, first thing. No smile of 
celebration. No sigh of relief over nailing down a necessary victory. No 
compliments for a job well done. 
</P>
<P>
There was not one word from Isiah about the way he took the play to Jordan, 
beating the taller defender to the basket time after time, outscoring the 
Chicago megastar, 33-27. 
</P>
<P>
Not a word about the way he and fellow Detroit guards Joe Dumars and Vinnie 
Johnson joined forces for 69 points, after donating a measly 27 in Sunday's 
94-88 Game 1 defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Not a word about the way the Pistons, clinging to an 83-82 lead in the fourth 
quarter, pulled away with an 11-1 run to finally get these ever-hustling Bulls 
out of their hair. 
</P>
<P>
Not until he got that other stuff off his chest, at least. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not executing. We're not playing smart basketball. We're not moving the 
basketball. We're not setting screens," Thomas began, rattling off some of the 
things that persuaded him to call the team meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Defensively, we're having a lot of lapses. We don't screen out. We don't 
attack the boards like we usually do. We're not even catching the ball very 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not like the way we're playing right now." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he thought the Pistons could correct the trouble before Saturday's 
Game 3 at Chicago, Thomas, without a hint of humor in his voice, said: 
</P>
<P>
"We damn sure well better." 
</P>
<P>
With the Pistons generally favored to be the people who will keep the Lakers 
from winning championships back to back to back, this is no time for the team 
to go into a funk. Thomas knows these opportunities don't knock often. He knows 
how close Detroit came last season, how they had the Lakers on the ropes in 
both Game 6 and Game 7. 
</P>
<P>
Daly, too, was jumpy, describing Tuesday's game as "our biggest game of the 
season -- no, biggest in two years, I'd say. Losing to the Lakers was tough, 
but hardly an upset. Losing this game would have been Katie bar the door, 
devastating, man." 
</P>
<P>
While everyone, including those in the capacity crowd of 21,454, continued 
waiting for the Bulls to go away and stop bothering them, Coach Doug Collins' 
club kept playing as though a championship series would not be beyond their 
wildest dreams. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls led after one period, were tied at halftime, and fought back even 
when the Pistons peeled away to a nine-point lead late in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Not until Detroit finally went in front by 94-83 with 3:45 to play did the home 
team gain a double-figure lead on Chicago in this series. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody's doing any heavy oddsmaking on us in Las Vegas," 
Collins said. "But don't bet too much against us." 
</P>
<P>
One factor for games to come will be Pippen's bruised arch, which will be 
X-rayed today. Chicago can hardly afford to lose its shooting forward, the 
team's No. 2 scorer this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls lost Pippen at precisely the time the Pistons lost Laimbeer, but not 
because of an altercation they got into beneath the Chicago basket. 
</P>
<P>
On a breakaway, with 1:12 remaining in the third period and Detroit ahead by 
seven, Pippen tried to sky over Laimbeer for a lay-in, but missed it. After 
recovering the ball, Pippen had it roughly stripped from his hands by Laimbeer, 
and responded with a slap. Laimbeer pushed back. 
</P>
<P>
During the scrape, Pippen's foot was stepped on -- by Dennis Rodman, he thinks. 
Pippen left, never to return. Two seconds later, Laimbeer threw an elbow at 
Chicago guard John Paxson, who is nine inches shorter than he is. Being his 
second technical foul of the evening for elbowing, Laimbeer was pointed to the 
dressing room by referee Earl Strom, cited for unsportsmanlike conduct. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was because I stiff-armed Pippen," Laimbeer said. "They gave me one 
chance (by not ejecting him for that) and I didn't use it." 
</P>
<P>
Daly thought Laimbeer guiltless, and said everything "Bad Boys" Rick Mahorn and 
Laimbeer do is "looked at with a magnifying glass." 
</P>
<P>
No one from Detroit's starting front line scored in double figures, but it 
scarcely mattered, what with Thomas scoring 33, Dumars 20 and Johnson 16. Once 
again, however, the Pistons shot far below their usual standard, shooting less 
than 42%. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, who is only 19 of 49 for the series, was stricken with the flu early in 
the day, and said he "had the chills and was aching all over my body." 
Cartwright, Chicago's center, had missed Monday's practice for the same reason, 
and scored only nine points. 
</P>
<P>
After bringing the Bulls to within 83-82 with a swish from the key, Jordan 
missed twice and Detroit went on an 11-1 blitz, led by Dumars' six points and a 
Mark Aguirre dunk. The dunk made it 94-83 with 3:51 remaining -- and even 
though that was the Pistons' last basket, they were home free. 
</P>
<P>
Typical of Chicago's bad luck during these last minutes, the instant Grant got 
his 20th rebound, he tripped over two fallen Pistons and was called for 
traveling. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a bad day at the office for us," Grant said. "But they're thinking 
about us. They're not underestimating us anymore, if they ever did. I think 
people realize we've got a shot at this thing." 
</P>
<P>
Isiah Thomas among them. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern Conference Notes 
</P>
<P>
Games 3 and 4 both will be matinees, Saturday's at 11 a.m., PDT, and Monday's 
holiday game at noon. . . . The 1969 Lakers were the only NBA team to win a 
playoff series after dropping the first two games at home. They swept San 
Francisco the next four. . . . Scottie Pippen of the Bulls was fined $3,000 and 
New York's Kenny Walker $1,500 for fighting in Game 6 of their Eastern 
Conference semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not going to see a pretty game throughout this series," Detroit Coach 
Chuck Daly predicted. "I think it's knockdown, drag out from here on in." . . . 
In games this season in which they have held the opponent to fewer than 100 
points, the Pistons are 44-3. . . . Taxi fare from Detroit's airport to the 
Piston arena is $55, plus tip. Air fare on Southwest Airlines from Detroit to 
Chicago is $29.

DODGERS CAN'T STOP PHILLIES KNOW HOWELL; 
</P>
<P>
PITCHER BEATS EX-TEAMMATES AGAIN AS PHILADELPHIA WINS, 4-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ken Howell, traded by the Dodgers last December, indicated two weeks ago that 
he was somewhat uncomfortable facing his former teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, he has now taken a liking to it. 
</P>
<P>
For the second time in 12 days, the stocky right-hander befuddled the Dodgers, 
pitching the Philadelphia Phillies to a 4-1 victory Tuesday night before a 
crowd of 32,199 at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a situation where I wanted to come back and bury my old teammates," 
Howell said. "I only want to show myself that I can pitch in the major 
leagues." 
</P>
<P>
And if and he was able to do both, all the better. 
</P>
<P>
Howell gave up only three hits in eight innings, giving way in the ninth to 
Steve Bedrosian, who got the final three outs for his fifth save. 
</P>
<P>
Howell (5-2) gave up only one hit, a fourth-inning double by Mike Scioscia, in 
his last 7 2/3 innings, retiring 23 of the last 27 batters he faced after 
yielding back-to-back singles in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
He walked two and struck out six. 
</P>
<P>
His dominance made a loser of Dodger starter Fernando Valenzuela, who is 0-4 
and whose last victory was against the Atlanta Braves last June 14. 
</P>
<P>
And this time Howell faced a more formidable lineup than the one he limited to 
four hits in seven innings of a 3-0 victory May 12 at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
This one included Kirk Gibson, who came off the disabled list to play for the 
first time in almost a month. 
</P>
<P>
Not even Gibson could figure out Howell after lining a single to left in his 
first at-bat. Gibson, who hadn't played since April 25 because of a hamstring 
injury, struck out and twice grounded out in his last three at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
How did his leg feel? 
</P>
<P>
He didn't want to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm playing," he said. "You know how I feel about that. It's not an issue. I 
made it through. We lost. I'm disappointed. I stayed within myself. I didn't 
really have to run that hard tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Gibson took exception when a reporter asked him to comment on Howell's 
contention that Howell had been lucky, and got away with several mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"Who was the winning pitcher?" Gibson asked. "And so who had the best stuff? He 
was the winning pitcher, so obviously he had pretty good (stuff), didn't he?" 
</P>
<P>
Certainly better than Valenzuela, who lasted five innings. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela was in trouble early. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, pitching coach Ron Perranoski visited him after he walked the 
Phillies' first two batters, Juan Samuel and Dickie Thon. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel eventually scored on Mike Schmidt's sacrifice fly, but Valenzuela might 
have escaped the inning unscathed if not for first baseman Eddie Murray's 
ill-advised play. Murray, to the obvious dismay of catcher Mike Scioscia, 
inexplicably cut off a strong throw to the plate by Mike Davis, who had chased 
down Schmidt's fly ball in shallow right field. 
</P>
<P>
Singles by Davis and Gibson and a walk by Murray in the first preceded a 
run-scoring force by Scioscia that pulled the Dodgers even. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela, whose pitches registered between 77 and 82 m.p.h. on the Dodgers' 
radar gun, then retired 11 of 13 batters, giving up only an infield hit by 
Howell as he breezed into the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
But with two out and Steve Jeltz on second base -- he walked and was sacrificed 
to second -- Valenzuela yielded a check-swing single to Thon, whose grounder 
pulled Murray far off the bag at first base. 
</P>
<P>
A good throw probably would have beaten Thon, but Murray threw behind 
Valenzuela, who was unable to hang onto the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Chris James then lined a run-scoring single to center, Schmidt followed with a 
run-scoring single through Valenzuela's legs and, after he retired Ricky Jordan 
to end the inning, Valenzuela was through for the night. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies' lead was 3-1 and Chris Gwynn batted for Valenzuela to lead off 
the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela said he felt "pretty good," and Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda thought 
Valenzuela had thrown well. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't hit the ball hard off him," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
Howell, meanwhile, helped himself in the eighth, doubling to the left-field 
corner off reliever Alejandro Pena to score Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
It was Howell's time on the basepaths -- in addition to singling in the second, 
he walked in the sixth -- that prompted his departure and kept him from 
registering the first complete game of his career. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran a lot today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Literally, as well as figuratively. 
</P>
<P>
He ran circles around the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
To make room on the roster for Kirk Gibson, the Dodgers sent utility infielder 
Mike Sharperson to their triple-A affiliate at Albuquerque, N.M. . . . The 
nine-game home stand, which will also include three-game series against the New 
York Mets this weekend and the Montreal Expos next week, will end a 33-game 
stretch for the Dodgers against teams from the Eastern Division. . . . 
Shortstop Alfredo Griffin, on the disabled list with a sprained right thumb, 
took batting practice from the left side. Griffin, who had not batted since May 
2, the day after he was injured against the Pittsburgh Pirates, was unsure when 
he would be able to hit from the right side.

SHOW HAS ENOUGH TO EDGE GOODEN, 3-2; 
</P>
<P>
PADRE VETERAN WINS FIRST OVER MET STAR; DAVIS GETS 14TH SAVE 
</P>

<P>
It was a pitching matchup that Eric Show didn't savor. 
</P>
<P>
Before Show took the mound for the Padres against the New York Mets Tuesday 
night, he talked about the task ahead. He was facing one of baseball's 
superstars in Dwight Gooden, whom the Padres hadn't beaten in four years. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one night I'm going to have to be at my best," Show said. "This guy 
doesn't give you anything. I've faced him a couple of times without success. In 
'85, I lost the game that made him the youngest pitcher (age 20) ever to win 
20." 
</P>
<P>
Show might not have been at his best, but he was close to it, and his teammates 
did just enough damage to Gooden for a 3-2 victory in front of of 30,066 at San 
Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. Show allowed nine hits over 8 2/3 innings before 
Mark Davis came in for save No. 14. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat knocked the Mets, defending National League East champions, out of 
first place. The surprising Chicago Cubs moved a game ahead by beating the 
Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
Had it not been for a throwing error by second baseman Roberto Alomar in the 
ninth, Show would have had his first complete game of the season. With two 
outs, after the side should have been retired, a single by Dave Magadon put the 
potential tying run on base and forced Manager Jack McKeon to send for Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Lyons greeted Davis with his third consecutive single, which cut the 
Padres' two-run lead in half. But when Kevin Elster relieved the pressure by 
fouling out, Show had the victory that ran his record to 6-4 and dropped 
Gooden's to 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
This was only the third time the Padres had beaten Gooden against eight 
defeats, and the first time since May 20, 1985, when LaMarr Hoyt pitched a 2-0 
shutout. Gooden had beaten them six times in a row, although they managed a 
no-decision against him in New York May 12. 
</P>
<P>
It was Show's first victory over Gooden, but he had lost to the perennial 
All-Star right-hander only in 1985. With the decision, he tied Randy Jones' 
all-time club victory record of 92. 
</P>
<P>
"I think five or 10 years down the road, the record will mean more to me than 
now," Show said. "There are a lot of teams I could have pitched for and never 
had this title. Boston is one of them. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've been wild this year. I just tried not to walk anyone, which I 
didn't, to keep the ball in the park and keep ahead of the hitters." 
</P>
<P>
Pitching coach Pat Dobson had worked with Show on his breaking ball between 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
"Strike one on everybody, that's all," Dobson said. "Getting strike one and 
staying ahead of hitters makes all the difference in the world. Then you can 
make them hit your pitch." 
</P>
<P>
Mets Manager Dave Johnson said Show "mixed his pitches up. "We hit some decent 
balls. You have to give him credit, but we've been giving a lot of guys 
credit." 
</P>
<P>
Davis' 14th save kept him in a tie with John Franco of the Cincinnati Reds for 
the major league lead. Both have perfect records in saving games, research 
having determined Tuesday that Davis was not charged with a blown save in 
Montreal last Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
It was believed that Davis' save streak had ended at 13 when he let a 6-3 lead 
shrink to 6-5 against the Expos. But since the Padres held on to win -- Greg 
Harris got the save -- Davis' record was alive. 
</P>
<P>
Gooden held the Padres to four hits in seven innings before leaving for a 
hitter, but two of them produced two runs in the fourth, one on John Kruk's 
third home run of the season. Luis Salazar gave Show what turned out to be the 
deciding run with a home run, also his third, off Don Aase in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
"Kruk hit a three-two fastball," Gooden said. "We hit some pretty good balls 
off Show, but we just had some double plays (three) that broke it up. 
</P>
<P>
"When you pitch like I did, you have to win those types of games. When they 
scored those two runs in the fourth, I thought, 'There's no way you can give up 
any more runs. It's do or die.' It's just frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
Kruk was fresh off the disabled list after recovering from a hip pointer and a 
strained shoulder, and hit in the leadoff spot for only the third time this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just glad I didn't get in there tonight and screw things up for 
everybody," Kruk said. "We've been playing good baseball. I didn't want to come 
in, bat first, strike out four times and rock the boat. 
</P>
<P>
"Gooden is not a good guy to come off the disabled list against. On the home 
run, he hit my bat. I don't know what I'm doing right now. I was just trying to 
put the ball in play tonight." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon was happy to see the burst of power at the top of his batting order. 
</P>
<P>
"If Kruk hits like he did tonight (he also had a single), he'll be a tremendous 
asset to us," McKeon said. "He's coming back when the club is hitting better. 
We're not so much depending on him alone. 
</P>
<P>
"But let's not forget Show. He did a hell of a job. He had some of his better 
stuff all year. He should have had a complete game, but those things happen." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
With the New York Mets in town, reporters asked Padre Manager Jack McKeon the 
inevitable question about a possible trade. The Mets need a catcher with Gary 
Carter getting up in years (35), and the Padres would be glad to trade Sandy 
Alomar Jr., now at triple-A Las Vegas, for the right price. However, McKeon 
insisted that nothing was cooking. "We haven't talked to them," McKeon said. 
"If they have something they want to talk to us about, fine. We'll talk. I'd 
talk about any of our catchers (Mark Parent included). I've said that from day 
one. But we were in New York just last week, and they didn't say anything." 
McKeon was asked specifically about dealing Benito Santiago, and said, 
"Everybody in baseball would like to to have Santiago. If the right players 
were made available to us, we would have to think about it. We don't want to 
trade him, but I won't say we won't." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres are interested in such Mets as third baseman Howard Johnson, center 
fielder Lenny Dykstra and pitcher Sid Fernandez, but Johnson is unavailable now 
because of the knee injury that has knocked out first baseman Keith Hernandez 
for about two months. Dave Magadan, who would have taken over for Johnson at 
third, is filling in for Hernandez at first. Said McKeon: "If I go to the Mets, 
what do I get? If I want somebody like (pitcher) Mark Langston, I'll go to 
Seattle, but Seattle hasn't come to me. And let's play a game about the Mets. 
Can they afford to give up Johnson and Dykstra? Dykstra, yeah, but I'm not 
going to take him for a catcher. Then I don't have any bargaining power left. 
I'm behind the eight-ball. I will have played my last trump card." 
</P>
<P>
Carter will be eligible to come off the disabled list for Thursday's series 
finale. He said he would catch that day, but Manager Dave Johnson wasn't so 
sure.

Controversial Natalia Zvereva of the Soviet Union, who was at the top of her 
game this time last year while making it all the way to the French Open final, 
may be behind schedule this year. Or, she may have learned the art of tanking a 
match. 
</P>
<P>
With the start of the French in Paris five days away, Zvereva entered a tuneup 
tournament in Geneva and quickly was ousted by U.S. qualifier Shaun Stafford. 
Stafford, 20, of Gainesville, Fla., who has been on the pro tour since February 
and is ranked 92nd in the world, beat Zvereva, 6-3, 7-6 (6-3). 
</P>
<P>
Zvereva, who created a stir recently by announcing that she will now take 
larger portions of her winnings instead of letting the vast percentage of it go 
to the Soviet tennis federation, said afterward that she wasn't surprised that 
she lost, since she entered "to play doubles." She said she was surprised to 
learn that all entrants had to play both singles and doubles. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. men's team swept its first-round match against Switzerland in the World 
Team Cup tournament in Dusseldorf, West Germany. Tim Mayotte beat Jacob Hlasek, 
3-6, 6-4, 6-1; Aaron Krickstein beat Claudio Mezzadri, 5-7, 6-4, 6-0, and the 
doubles team of Rick Leach and Jim Pugh beat Hlasek and Heinz Guenthardt, 6-3, 
6-4.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
WHILE SPARKY'S AWAY, HIS TIGERS SHOW THEY CAN PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Detroit Tigers were off to such a terrible start this season that Manager 
Sparky Anderson had to go home to Thousand Oaks to rest. 
</P>
<P>
It was just five years ago that Anderson's team opened by winning an 
unprecedented 31 of the first 35 games, breezed to the pennant and won the 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
But before Anderson's abrupt departure last week, the Tigers had won only 12 of 
35, the club's worst start. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, for the Tigers, they are playing in the American League East, 
where no team appears capable of playing .500 ball. 
</P>
<P>
A short winning streak under acting Manager Dick Tracewski and, all of a 
sudden, things don't look so bad for the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Trujillo, a journeyman right-hander given a chance because of injuries, 
pitched a six-hitter Tuesday night at Detroit as the Tigers beat Cleveland, 
7-2. 
</P>
<P>
Trujillo, 29, who has pitched for several teams, hurled only the third complete 
game of his career. He beat the division leader, moving the last-place Tigers 
to within 3 1/2 games of first place. Under Tracewski, they have won four of 
their last five. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers chased Greg Swindell, who had won his first four decisions, with a 
five-run third inning, after Gary Ward homered in the second. 
</P>
<P>
Trujillo, signed by the Tigers' Toledo club after Seattle dumped him in 1987, 
made his first start this season May 16 and gave up four runs in four innings. 
This time, though, Trujillo had a shutout until Joe Carter doubled in a run in 
the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians remained in first place, but with an unflattering note. Their 21-22 
mark makes them the first team this late in the season to lead a division with 
a record below .500. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 6, Seattle 5 -- Red Sox Manager Joe Morgan had hardly finished pointing 
out how tough his team's luck was on a recent trip, when the Mariners jumped in 
front, 4-0, at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox, who were 3-6 on the road and just missed winning three of the 
games they lost, are a different club at home. 
</P>
<P>
They battled back to catch up and won it with two out in the ninth. Ellis Burks 
doubled with two out and Dwight Evans singled him home to end it. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Smith (2-1) became the winner when he retired the last Mariner in the top 
of the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Leonard's three-run homer, his ninth of the season, sent the Mariners 
in front. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 2, Minnesota 1 -- The pitchers had charge of this game at Toronto until 
Twins' right fielder John Moses turned Kelly Gruber's fly ball into a 
three-base error. 
</P>
<P>
This happened with one out in the bottom of the ninth in a 1-1 game. George 
Bell followed with a sacrifice fly that let the Blue Jays win the kind of game 
they have been losing of late. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Sanchez, a 1986 All-American at UCLA, made his major league debut as the 
starter for the Blue Jays. He gave up five hits and walked five, but yielded 
only one run in six innings. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 10, Kansas City 8 -- Nolan Ryan didn't even have to pitch well to 
continue his mastery over the Royals, which dates back to his Angel days. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers built a 10-0 lead in four innings at Arlington, Tex., for the 
42-year-old right-hander. Ryan, 22-11 against the Royals, gave up five runs in 
the fifth inning, but lasted through one more to improve his record to 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
He threw 110 pitches in 89-degree heat. 
</P>
<P>
One of the pitches was a three-run home run in the fifth by Bo Jackson. Until 
he finally connected with a Ryan pitch, Jackson had been struck out six times 
in a row by Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 9, Oakland 1 -- The Brewers didn't treat the A's Bob Welch as befits 
a six-game winner. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Gantner doubled to cap a three-run fifth inning in the game at Milwaukee, 
enabling Chris Bosio to improve his record to 6-3, same as Welch. 
</P>
<P>
In the seventh, the Brewers broke it open, when Rob Deer hit his league-leading 
11th home run to ignite a five-run rally. 
</P>
<P>
Although he gave up 10 hits, Bosio made it through seven innings, giving up 
only one run. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 9, Chicago 3 -- The Orioles turned loose a home run barrage at 
Chicago to make it easy for Bob Milacki to win for the second time in six 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Former Dodger Mike Devereaux hit a two-run home run, while Mickey Tettleton, 
Billy Ripken and Larry Sheets also homered. 
</P>
<P>
Milacki gave up eight hits in 7 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time this season the Orioles hit four homers in a game. DAN

GRADUATING A WINNER; 
</P>
<P>
WHITE TAKES CAP AND GOWN OVER MASTERS MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Had track and field been Russell White's primary athletic endeavor, his 
decision to forgo the Southern Section Masters meet at Cerritos College on 
Friday in favor of attending his graduation at Crespi High might have been 
difficult to make. 
</P>
<P>
But as the state's all-time career rushing (5,998 yards) and scoring leader, 
White knows that his future lies in football, the sport for which he signed a 
letter of intent with Cal. 
</P>
<P>
"Football has always been my number-one love," said White, who won the 100 and 
200 meters, long jump and triple jump in the Southern Section 2-A Division 
finals at Cerritos College in Norwalk on Saturday. "I enjoy track. I've always 
wanted to do as well as I can in it, but it's never been as important to me as 
football." 
</P>
<P>
Having qualified for the Masters in the 200, long jump and triple jump, White's 
high school athletic career will end Friday if he does not compete because the 
meet is the Southern Section qualifier for the state championships. 
</P>
<P>
Although White will lose a chance to improve upon his eighth-place finish in 
the 200 as a junior and on his second-place effort in the triple jump as a 
sophomore, he appears content with his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't really that hard to make," he said. "Graduating from Crespi means a 
lot to me and I want to go through the ceremonies." 
</P>
<P>
Followers of Crespi track will not soon forget White's performance: He 
accounted for 40 of the Celts' 42 points to lead them to a second-place finish 
behind Arroyo Grande (70). 
</P>
<P>
White ran personal bests of 10.78 in the 100 and 21.47 in the 200, leaped a 
wind-aided 23 feet, 3 1/2 inches in the long jump and bounded a season best of 
48-11 in the triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
His performances were even more impressive because he was not challenged in any 
event. He eased up in the final meters of the 100 and 200, yet still won by .08 
and .34 seconds. And even though he took only three of his allotted six 
attempts, he had a victory margin of 3 3/4 inches in the long jump and 1 foot, 
5 1/2 inches in the triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to go out with my head held high," White said.

SOUTHERN SECTION BASEBALL PLAYOFFS; 
</P>
<P>
LANGFORD SHARP AS SIMI VALLEY ADVANCES IN 5-A 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Right-hander Rich Langford threw a six-hitter and struck out nine as Simi 
Valley High defeated Baldwin Park, 5-1, in a Southern Section 5-A Division 
second-round playoff game Tuesday at Baldwin Park. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley (23-3) scored three runs in the second, two on wild pitches and 
another on a double by Mike Jenkins. The Pioneers scored again in the fourth 
when Tyler Nelson tripled and scored on the front end of a double steal. 
</P>
<P>
Langford (7-1), who has overcome arm problems that plagued him early in the 
season, had only one bad inning. The senior allowed three consecutive singles 
in the fifth to bring Baldwin Park to within 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Sommer homered in the fifth, his fourth, to give Simi Valley a 5-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Second baseman Jesse Anguiano tied a single-game school record with four walks. 
</P>
<P>
The Pioneers will play Long Beach Millikan, a 4-3 winner over Culver City on 
Tuesday, in the third round on Friday at Simi Valley. Millikan, the host school 
in the first two rounds, must play the remainder of its games on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley defeated Millikan, 8-7, in the El Segundo tournament in March. 
</P>
<P>
In another 5-A game: 
</P>
<P>
Fontana 7, Newbury Park 4 -- A two-run double by Jim Quiroz keyed a four-run 
third inning for Fontana in the second-round game at Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
Quiroz's hit snapped a 2-2 tie. Mark Carter drove in Quiroz with a single, went 
to second on an error by left fielder Brian Smith, and scored on Jerry 
Jamillo's double. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park (19-5-3) had tied the score in the top of the third on Chris 
Marsden's single, Eric Greene's triple and Danny Madsen's sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
Senior outfielder Geoff Black hit his seventh home run -- a two-run blast -- in 
the fifth for the Panthers' other runs. 
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Dewey (8-3), who shut out North Torrance, 11-0, in the first round, went 
the distance for the Panthers. He allowed nine hits, struck out three and 
walked two. 
</P>
<P>
4-A DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
Hart 10, Walnut 5 -- For a while, it looked like a repeat of 1988 when highly 
regarded Hart was ousted, 12-7, in the second round by Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Hart trailed, 4-0, and stranded six runners in the first two innings but 
managed to rally in a second-round game at Hart. 
</P>
<P>
An error by Walnut shortstop Steve Martinez opened the door for four Hart runs 
in the fifth. Hits by Jason Edwards, David Toledo and Jay Sanford keyed the 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
Hart (21-6) added five more runs in the sixth, two on a home run to center by 
Chris Vasquez, his fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Junior left-hander Andrew Lorraine (8-4) threw a six-hitter, struck out 13 and 
walked one. After Walnut scored four times in the second, Lorraine settled 
down, allowing a lone run in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Hart will play top-seeded Buena, an 8-4 winner Tuesday over Lompoc, in the 
third round Friday. Since both teams have played two home games, a coin flip 
will determine the site. 
</P>
<P>
3-A DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
La Palma Kennedy 6, Canyon 4 -- Corey Byars hit two home runs but Canyon lost 
the second-round game at home. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 4-0, after 2 1/2 innings, Canyon (14-12) narrowed the deficit to one 
with three runs in the third. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Rorick led off the inning with a single and Byars followed with his first 
home run. One out later, Rod Markovich and Kevin Backes had consecutive 
singles. Markovich went to third on a fielder's choice and scored on a wild 
pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Byars hit a solo home run with two out in the sixth for Canyon's other run. 
</P>
<P>
2-A DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
St. Bernard 6, Agoura 4 -- Grant Hohman hit a one-out, two-run home run in the 
ninth inning to give visiting St. Bernard the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 4-3, in the bottom of the seventh, Agoura sent the game into extra 
innings when Zac Miller scored on an error by first baseman Al Ibarra. 
</P>
<P>
With two out and Miller on third, Bobby Kazmirski grounded to shortstop Hohman, 
who threw to first in time for the final out, but Ibarra dropped the ball. 
</P>
<P>
St. Bernard held a 4-0 lead after 4 1/2 innings, but Agoura (14-8) rallied. 
Mark Costas singled, stole second and went to third on Nelson Townes' single. 
Townes stole second, then a double by Brian Smith scored both runners. 
</P>
<P>
Costas and Smith each had three hits for Agoura, the Frontier League champion, 
and teammates Josh Smaler and Dan Freedman each added two. 
</P>
<P>
SMALL SCHOOLS DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
Queen of Angels 8, Woodcrest Christian 7 -- Trailing, 6-3, in the bottom of the 
sixth, Queen of Angels scored five runs to win a second-round game at Queen of 
Angels. 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth, Chris Wilson led off with a walk. After Felix Renteria singled, 
Merced Marin was safe on an error to load the bases. One out later, Bernie 
Osuna doubled down the left-field line to score Wilson and Renteria. Murillo 
Hipolito singled home Marin to tie the score, and scored on a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Osuna, a junior outfielder, was four for four with three RBIs and two runs 
scored. 
</P>
<P>
Junior right-hander Steve Steger (3-0) pitched the last two innings, allowing 
three runs, to earn the win. 
</P>
<P>
Queen of Angels will play Villanova Prep, a 7-5 winner over Chadwick, on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Highland Hall 7, Mesrobian 6 -- Highland Hall's Tum Ratanatraiphob singled home 
Ed Anastas with two out in the top of the 10th inning to lead the Hawks to 
their 11th consecutive win in a second-round game at Mesrobian. 
</P>
<P>
In the 10th, Craig Ernst led off with a walk and was sacrificed to second. 
Anastas beat out an infield hit to third, with Ernst holding at second. One out 
later, Ratanatraiphob singled to right-center to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
Junior right-hander Bob Ramirez (14-3) threw a seven-hitter for the Hawks 
(21-5), striking out 14 and walking four. Ramirez set single-season school 
records for strikeouts (142) and wins. 
</P>
<P>
Ratanatraiphob, Anastas, Ernst and Chris Sorensen each had two hits for 
Highland Hall, which will play second-seeded Rosamond on Friday. Rosamond 
defeated Abundant Life, 13-1, on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo Christian 9, Liberty Christian 2 -- John Boardman pitched a 
seven-hitter, struck out six and walked one for Camarillo Christian in the 
second-round game at Rio Mesa High. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo Christian (18-5) took a commanding 6-0 lead in the first inning on 
seven hits and two errors. The Eagles had six singles and a double in the 
inning and sent 12 batters to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Hardy, Gerald Long, Marc Marshall and Boardman each had two hits for 
Camarillo Christian, which has won nine consecutive games.

DIGEST: SAUGUS' MASTERS FACES COLLIER IN RING RETURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former world heavyweight champion will be making a comeback attempt at the 
Hollywood Palace tonight. 
</P>
<P>
OK, so it's only Monte Masters of Saugus, former champion of the little-known 
and even less-regarded World Athletic Assn. of Yukon, Okla. But if Masters 
(30-2, 26 knockouts) can prevail in tonight's 10-round main event, he will have 
taken a small step toward credibility. His opponent will be Dee Collier (12-8, 
seven knockouts) of Los Angeles, a former state champion and the man who 
retired Tex Cobb and, perhaps, Alex Garcia, who has not fought since a loss to 
Collier on Nov. 29. 
</P>
<P>
Masters has been retired for nearly three years, giving up the ring for the 
more solid business of construction. But he has laid the foundation for a 
comeback scenario that he hopes to start acting out tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The car was ready, but the driver was not. 
</P>
<P>
That was the case for the Two's Company entry in the Indianapolis 500 last 
week. After more than a week of mechanical problems, the Sun Valley company's 
March 86C was finally ready to go on the track for qualifying last weekend. But 
driver and co-owner Dick Ferguson of Glendale was ruled ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
Because Ferguson had not raced at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in two years, he 
was required to take a 20-lap refresher course in which he had to maintain a 
speed exceeding 190 miles an hour. The deadline was last Wednesday, but because 
the car still had problems, Indy officials made an exception and set last 
Friday as the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
However, it rained Friday and Ferguson wasn't allowed on the track Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything looked dynamite," a dejected Jim Harkess, one of the owners, said 
by phone from Indy. "There are a lot of disappointed folks out here." 
</P>
<P>
John Wordin of West Hills qualified for the U. S. National Road Cycling 
Championships in July by placing third in the U.S. Cycling Federation District 
3 time trial championships Sunday in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
Wordin, 25, finished the 40-kilometer course in 52 minutes, 41 seconds, 21 
seconds behind Kerry Stockwell and Jay Vanderahe, who tied for first. 
</P>
<P>
Wordin was leading the event until the chain fell off his cycle with 
approximately seven miles remaining. The nationals are July 11-20 in Park City, 
Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Wordin and other area cyclists will next compete in the Redlands Stage Race, 
which runs Friday through Sunday. The race is part of the USCF's National 
Prestige Classic series. 
</P>
<P>
De Dow, a sophomore right-hander at Moorpark College, was selected to the 
all-tournament team at the state junior college softball championships. 
</P>
<P>
Dow (30-7), the winningest pitcher in Moorpark history, won three games in the 
state playoffs last weekend at Golden West College in Huntington Beach. She was 
selected to the all-tournament team along with teammates Rosa Jimenez 
(utility), Paula Allen (outfielder) and Gina Duarte (third base). 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark placed third in the state and set a school record for wins in a season 
(38).

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK; 
</P>
<P>
AGOURA RUNNERS TO FOCUS ON 3,200 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite qualifying in two events, both Bryan Dameworth and Deena Drossin of 
Agoura High will concentrate on only the 3,200 meters in the Southern Section 
Masters meet at Cerritos College in Norwalk on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Both runners also had qualified in the 1,600 meters but will not compete in 
that event, Coach Bill Duley said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel it's possible for most kids to compete well in both those events 
at that elite level," Duley said. "So I gave Bryan and Deena a choice of what 
event they wanted to run." 
</P>
<P>
The top five finishers in each event at the Masters will qualify for the state 
championships next Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth, the two-time defending state Division I cross-country champion, took 
little time in making his decision, opting for the 3,200, in which he has the 
fastest time (9 minutes, 3.62 seconds) in the state this season. 
</P>
<P>
But it took Drossin, winner of the Southern Section 1-A 1,600 and 3,200 on 
Saturday, a day to decide. 
</P>
<P>
"She's been running very well in both events," Duley said. "But I think she 
feels that the 3,200 is her stronger race. Plus, she won't have to run heats in 
that event at the state meet." 
</P>
<P>
Add Agoura: Although Dameworth is one of the favorites for the state title in 
the 3,200, it has been a disappointing season for him in the 1,600. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to run under 4:10 in the event, Dameworth ran a season best of 4:15.75 
to place second behind Coley Candaele of Carpinteria in the 1-A finals. 
</P>
<P>
"I set some pretty high goals for him in the 1,600, hoping that he would take 
it on as his primary event," Duley said. "But he just feels more comfortable in 
the 3,200. 
</P>
<P>
"He's in shape to run a lot faster than he has in the 1,600, but he just hasn't 
been in the right race at that distance." 
</P>
<P>
The 1-A race was a good example of that; the early pace lagged (first 400 in 
65.5 seconds), effectively putting to rest Dameworth's hope of a fast time. 
</P>
<P>
"He ran the last 1,200 in 3:10," Duley said. "But that first lap was just too 
slow." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing but nyet: Even though Sunday's basketball game at UC Irvine between a 
group of high school all-stars from the Soviet Union and the Slam-N-Jam 
all-stars was played under international rules, the locals showed the visitors 
what a fast-break atmosphere is all about. 
</P>
<P>
"The gym was rocking and everybody was really into it," said Cleveland's Adonis 
Jordan, who played for Slam-N-Jam, a 127-99 winner before 1,600 spectators. "I 
had a blast." 
</P>
<P>
The international rules took some getting used to, though. 
</P>
<P>
"You can inbound the ball faster," Jordan said. "And that helped us run, but it 
was different. You can goaltend the ball off the rim, the lanes are a little 
wider and there were no alley-oops. None of us were used to that." 
</P>
<P>
The most striking difference between the teams was in size. None of the Soviet 
players, who are touring the United States, were shorter than 6-foot-4. 
</P>
<P>
"They were all bigger, but a little slower," said the 5-10 Jordan, who scored 
10 points. 
</P>
<P>
What about communication? 
</P>
<P>
"We had a (Soviet) guy in our room before the game that spoke a little bit of 
English," Jordan said. "But we did pretty good communicating with the body 
language." 
</P>
<P>
Body language of another sort took longer to get accustomed to. On the court, 
the Soviets were more physical than the Californians. 
</P>
<P>
"You had to get slammed to the ground before anything got called," Jordan said. 
"They were rough." 
</P>
<P>
Add Jordan: The Kansas-bound senior will play his last high school game for the 
California entry in the Boston Shootout on June 22-24 at the Boston Garden. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament features all-star teams from 50 states, Jordan said. Among those 
expected to join him are Tracy Murray of Glendora, Zan Mason of Westchester and 
Mitchell Butler of Oakwood, all of whom played against the Soviet team.

<P>
SAUGUS ADVANCES BEHIND LEWIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Senior left-hander Cathy Lewis threw a three-hitter and struck out 13 to lead 
Saugus High to a 2-0 win over Culver City in a Southern Section 3-A Division 
second-round playoff game Tuesday at Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
Brandy Rico went two for two, singling home Westie Gray in each of the third 
and fifth innings. 
</P>
<P>
Saugus improved to 19-7 and Lewis, who has every decision for the Centurions, 
improved her season strikeout total to 322. 
</P>
<P>
Saugus Coach Ron Hilton said that Lewis had dedicated the game to the late Jack 
Smock of Bell-Jeff High, one of her former coaches, who died of cancer 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In a 2-A game: 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame 3, Hesperia 1 -- Junior right-hander Becca Berline threw a 
four-hitter and struck out eight in a second-round game at Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
With Notre Dame leading, 3-1, in the top of the sixth, Berline (16-9) gave up a 
pair of singles to put runners on the corners with none out. Berline, however, 
struck out the next two batters and recorded the final out on a comebacker. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Simona Errico gave the Knights (16-9) a 1-0 lead in the first with a 
two-out, run-scoring single and drove in another run with a two-out single in 
the third.

ST. AUGUSTINE MAKES HISTORY WITH VICTORY IN BASEBALL PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ESCONDIDO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the past 14 years, St. Augustine High has had more major league baseball 
players (John D'Acquisto and John Wathan), more NFL players (Monte Jackson, 
Terry Jackson and Tim Smith), more mayors (Roger Hedgecock) and more city 
councilmen (Uvaldo Martinez) than baseball playoff victories. 
</P>
<P>
During that time, however, the Saints had never been in a playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
That is, until Tuesday. The Saints traveled to Escondido High, the site of 
their most recent playoff game in 1975, and defeated the Cougars, 5-1, to 
advance to the quarterfinals of the San Diego Section 2-A playoffs Thursday 
against Grossmont. St. Augustine is 17-11. Escondido finished 20-8. 
</P>
<P>
Cougar Coach Bill Kutzner, a St. Augustine graduate, began coaching at 
Escondido in '75 and barely remembers that playoff game. Ditto for Bill 
Whitaker, St. Augustine's coach that year, who retired last season from 
coaching but still teaches at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Stephensen, Saints' first-year coach, will remember Tuesday's game for a 
long time. 
</P>
<P>
"We executed well," said Stephensen, whose team has won 10 consecutive games. 
"You can't execute any better than we did today." 
</P>
<P>
St. Augustine had timely hitting, scoring five runs on seven singles and a 
squeeze bunt. Eric Dent was two for four with an RBI and two runs scored, and 
Jim Bitler was two for four with two RBIs and a run scored. 
</P>
<P>
St. Augustine played terrific defense. Saints turned a nifty 
pitcher-to-short-to-first double play in the sixth inning. And Bitler, in left 
field, made a diving catch along the foul line to end the game with the bases 
loaded and the tying run at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
But game-ball honors would have to go to pitcher Brad Gennaro (8-6). The senior 
left-hander scattered eight hits and allowed just one run (in the seventh). 
Gennaro, the county leader in strikeouts with 94 during the regular season, 
also struck out five, but admittedly did not have his normal velocity. 
</P>
<P>
What he did have was control of a curveball that kept Escondido hitters 
frustrated for most of the afternoon. "He did a real good job of keeping us off 
balance today," said Kutzner. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Jackson, who threw nine innings on Friday against Hoover to determine 
second place in the City Central League, came in to get the last two outs after 
Gennaro had tired in the seventh.

PITCHERS HAVE BEEN BIG HIT THIS SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pitching talent had a countywide impact on softball this season. 
</P>
<P>
Monte Vista's Suzy Lawrence, Kelli Schott of Vista and Madison's Jennifer 
Booker and Natalie Hurlburt all have enjoyed exceptional seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The four combined this regular season to pitch 446 innings, strike out 570 
batters while walking only 80 and compile a 55-11 record. 
</P>
<P>
Booker, a sophomore, went 10-2 during the regular season with four consecutive 
shutouts. In the middle of that streak, Booker tied a national record of two 
consecutive perfect games, a record also achieved by Castle Park's Dawn Wood. 
</P>
<P>
Madison Coach Steve Miner said Booker's strengths are consistency and velocity. 
</P>
<P>
"She moves the ball around the strike zone," Miner said. "She has the ability 
to throw it where she wants it." 
</P>
<P>
Miner said Booker didn't have the tough opponents left-handed senior Hurlburt 
(10-4) had -- "Her losses have been against some very good teams," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Miner said Hurlburt has more velocity but less control than Booker. 
</P>
<P>
"Her drop's sharper," Miner said, "and her ball moves a little bit better." 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence (16-1), who will attend the University of Hawaii, has emerged from the 
shadow of ace Melissa Rodriguez, who graduated last season. 
</P>
<P>
She had pitched eight consecutive complete-game shutouts and 76 consecutive 
scoreless innings dating back to a March Easter tournament before May 15, when 
Grossmont scored a run on her in the seventh inning of a 4-1 Monte Vista 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
"She's in control of every pitch," Monte Vista Coach Charlie Costello said. 
"The speed at which her ball comes in, if not the best in the county, is one of 
the best." 
</P>
<P>
Schott (17-3), on her way to play at UC Santa Barbara, finished the regular 
season with 200 strikeouts in 151 innings, with a .090 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
"Just how smart she is makes her so good," Vista Coach Kevin Woodrow said. "She 
knows what to pitch and when to pitch it. She knows she doesn't always have to 
go right at the batters." KIM Q. BERKSHIRE

SPORTS ET CETERA: SDSU'S BRADLEY NAMED ASSISTANT BASKETBALL COACH AT BRIGHAM 
YOUNG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Bradley, assistant basketball coach at San Diego State, has been named 
assistant to Roger Reid, the new coach at Brigham Young. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll be a great addition to our program," said Reid, "and he understands what 
it takes." 
</P>
<P>
Said Aztec Coach Jim Brandenburg, who brought Bradley with him from the 
University of Wyoming when he came to SDSU: "Charles has been a great player 
and an excellent coach in all the years we have been together. He's done an 
outstanding job for me at San Diego State as well as at Wyoming. He has a very 
bright future in the coaching profession, and I wish him the best." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley averaged 17 points per game and shot 53% from the floor as a four-year 
starter for Wyoming. Following his graduation in 1981, Bradley was a 
first-round draft pick by the Boston Celtics and later joined the Seattle 
SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984 he launched his coaching career as freshman coach at Mullen High in 
Inglewood, Colo. He also spent a season as a player with the Wyoming 
Wildcatters of the Continental Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley joined Brandenburg's staff at Wyoming in 1986. The Cowboys won the 
Western Athletic Conference tournament in 1986 and advanced in the National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. playoffs with victories over Virginia and UCLA. The 
Cowboys were 24-10 that season.

Mt. Carmel pitcher Byron Klemaske has accepted a full scholarship to 
Nevada-Reno. Klemaske (13-1) was the sixth-leading strikeout pitcher in the 
county (76) and will start Thursday in top-ranked Mt. Carmel's opening 3-A 
playoff game against Patrick Henry. 
</P>
<P>
ADMINISTRATION 
</P>
<P>
Scott Barnes has been named associate director of development for athletics at 
the University of San Diego, Tom Iannocone, director of athletics, announced 
Tuesday. Barnes will assume the new position July 1. He will be responsible for 
marketing, advertising and promotions for USD athletics. He will plan, manage 
and direct the annual fund-raising activities for USD's athletic programs. 
</P>
<P>
This past year, Barnes, 26, was the general manager of the Fresno Flames of the 
World Basketball League. 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Chargers signed free-agent punter Lewis Colbert. Colbert, 
eighth-round draft pick of Kansas City in 1986, played 16 games that season. 
His 40.7 average on 99 punts ranked seventh in the American Football 
Conference. Colbert played two games in 1987 before being placed on injured 
reverse with a back injury. He was released during the Chiefs' 1988 training 
camp, re-signed by Atlanta and released during final roster cuts.

DOLLAR MIXED IN PROFIT TAKING, RUMORS OF REVISED TRADE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The raging value of the dollar turned mixed Tuesday as dealers took profits 
from its recent strength and speculated on what the United States and its 
trading partners might do next to stabilize foreign exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
Traders reported increased dollar selling by the Federal Reserve and central 
banks of Britain and Japan, but they said the market once again ignored the 
interventions. 
</P>
<P>
"The market is sort of catching its breath here . . . but there's still very 
strong sentiment behind the dollar, even though we're seeing a pause right 
now," said William P. Sterling, an international economist with Merrill Lynch 
Capital Markets. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar's slight retrenchment dollar against some other key currencies 
helped to push up most interest rates in the credit markets and to weaken stock 
prices, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices were mixed in the United States, although they regained some of the 
steep losses overseas that stemmed from a rally of the dollar Monday. The price 
of an ounce of gold fell $2.65, to a late bid of $361.85 an ounce, according to 
the Republic National Bank of New York. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar started out strong in overnight trading and closed at another recent 
high in Tokyo, but fell against most currencies in Europe and was mixed in the 
United States due to profit taking and speculation that Japan and the United 
States might change their credit policies. 
</P>
<P>
Traders speculated that the Bank of Japan would soon raise its discount rate, 
the interest it charges on loans to commercial banks, and that the Fed might 
ease U.S. rates, both to stem the dollar's rise. 
</P>
<P>
The market was also rife with rumors that a currency stabilization initiative 
would be undertaken by the Group of Seven, the United States and its six major 
trading partners. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the Bush Administration reaffirmed its pledge to keep exchange 
rates steady and speculation emerged that the Federal Reserve might soon start 
to lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
A day after the White House expressed concern that the surging dollar could 
damage U.S. trade prospects, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said 
Washington was committed to working closely with its allies on economic policy 
and exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important that the major industrial democracies of the world 
continue to work to coordinate their economic policies," Baker said. "It's 
really the coordination of those underlying economic policies that's going to 
make a difference in terms of exchange rate stability." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's chief economic adviser, Michael J. Boskin, also sought to end 
speculation that the Administration was willing to tolerate a stronger dollar, 
which reached a 29-month high against the West German mark this week. 
</P>
<P>
"The Administration has not changed its policy," Boskin told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose sharply on Monday. It broke the 2-mark level for the first time 
in 2 1/2 years and reached a 1 1/2-year high in relation to the yen, due 
largely to a perceived weakness in foreign-exchange policies among the Group of 
Seven. 
</P>
<P>
"The dollar cannot turn around until there are policy changes on either side of 
the water," said Ronald H. Holzer, chief currency dealer with Harris Trust 
&amp; Co. in Chicago. "Until then, we'll be trading off the rumors." 
</P>
<P>
Fed governor H. Robert Heller said, however, that inflation remained "a key 
factor to be considered in monetary policy making," and he gave no indication 
the Fed was considering easing rates to depress the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the government reported that durable goods orders shot up 2.9% in 
April, the best showing in four months and a further indication of U.S. 
economic strength. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the British pound dropped to $1.5675 from $1.5810 late Monday -- a 
22-month low -- despite intervention by the Bank of England. Sterling fetched 
$1.5645 in New York, up from $1.5755. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
rose by 1.50 Japanese yen and closed at 141.95 yen, despite intervention by the 
Bank of Japan for the second consecutive day. In London it traded at 141.60 
yen. Later, in New York, it traded at 142.30 yen, up from 142.05 yen on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar exchange rates in New York, compared to Monday's: 2.0110 West 
German marks, down from 2.01175; 1.7915 Swiss francs, down from 1.7935; 1.19945 
Canadian dollars, down from 1.20125; 6.8100 French francs, down from 6.8115, 
and 1,457.50 Italian lire, up from 1,456.50. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery rose to 
$363.80 an ounce.

Welcome to our home. We hope you enjoy your stay here at SeaWhine as much as we 
enjoy it when we aren't renting it out to make money. We have done our best to 
see that everything is in order, but as you sign this guest book, please let us 
know if there is anything we can do to improve it. We ask that you treat the 
house as your own and leave it as you found it. If you need anything, we can be 
reached at the Motel 6 in town. Have a nice stay.

The ocean was beautiful even though the weather was terrible and we were stuck 
in the house for the entire weekend. We did enjoy the hot tub. Whoops! Sorry 
about your cat. One thing bothered us. You said that there was a place for a 
romantic fire. Not much romance with a wood stove.

What a perfect weekend. The surf could have performed a little better, but you 
can't have everything. We found the wood stove extremely romantic. Amory finds 
energy efficiency an incredible turn-on.

Bob and I and our kids, Zachary, 11, Sandra Dee, 8, and Jedidiah, 3, had a 
wonderful time. Bob liked the sandpipers and the tide pools. I especially loved 
the perfect sunsets from the deck. Zach liked everything and said the VCR and 
the Nintendo were especially "rad," whatever that means. Sandi loved the Power 
Vac and the Microwave. Jedi liked the doorbell. We did our best to get the 
stains out of the rug and the carpet. We do expect the cleaning deposit back 
because what kind of people would do a family home in white and mauve?

Dear "Mom and Dad," 
</P>
<P>
Thank you for this wonderful honeymoon. Between the fire and the tub and the 
beach, we hardly had a moment for romance. (Just joshing!) Those people who 
ruined the rug and the couch ought to be sued. They also left burnt caramel 
corn in the microwave. Weirdest thing, though, was the sock in the freezer. 
Scottie's trying out that wonderful chain saw you gave him for our wedding 
present. He's completely cleared that overgrown row of old redwood trees in the 
back, and we now get a much better view of the neighbors.

Your lovely property has restored my health. A few thoughts: The hot tub should 
be moved outside, the wood stove is corny, patio furniture would help, plant a 
few trees out back, your art is incredibly boring, and a red couch belongs in a 
brothel.

I've been reading over the things the other guests wrote in this book. Bunch of 
rotten dudes, man. We liked everything exactly like it is. The hot tub was 
totally icy, the beach was awesome, and the fire was really hot. Only problem 
was your neighbors didn't like us watching them through the telescope. They 
came over to complain, and we got in a little fracas. I think the deposit will 
cover the windows and the dishware, but the blood wouldn't come off the walls. 
Lucky you got that couch. For sure. One of the guys in the band drew a pentacle 
on the ceiling, and we thought it looked cool so we left it.

CONSUMER VIEWS: TELEPHONE SCAMS -- A BAD CONNECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON G. CAMPBELL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: We live (out of state) now, but used to live in California and always 
enjoyed reading your column. Last fall a firm in (a Los Angeles suburb) called 
to say we had been selected to receive a "marketing promotion premium worth 
$5,600 to consist of a wide-screen TV, VCR and complete stereo entertainment 
center." They requested a "filing promotion fee rebate," which was to be 
returned to us in 14 days. We sent our check for $499.88 and have not received 
anything that was promised for our money. Only the canceled check has been 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing we had to do to get our $500 back was to sign a "rebate coupon 
slip" they were to send us and return it to them. 
</P>
<P>
It took three months and a lot of phone calls from us to get the "slip" for us 
to sign. One other thing they required from us to receive our gifts was to send 
them $89 for freight. That we did not do, but wrote instead saying that I would 
send the $89 as soon as our rebate money was returned. 
</P>
<P>
I have written the regional postal inspector and the state consumer fraud 
office, but all they can say is to continue correspondence with this company. I 
have no proof of anything. They put nothing in writing. They are clever and 
convincing and we are stupid. Can you help us? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Both Jerry Smilowitz, who handles criminal matters for the Los Angeles 
office of the California attorney general's office, and Herschel Aron, 
supervising investigator here for the consumer fraud division of the Los 
Angeles County district attorney's office, say they have "many, many 
complaints" about the company you mention, which is under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the odds on getting your money back appear to range all the way 
from slim to nil. 
</P>
<P>
You've gotten caught up in one of the real growth industries of the decade -- 
the boiler-room telephone scam ("telescam"). And, understandably, it's not 
going to make you feel a whit better knowing that there are hundreds of 
thousands of you out there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unreported Scams 
</P>
<P>
The legitimate telemarketing business takes in about $100 billion a year, but 
the Federal Trade Commission has estimated that another $1 billion to $10 
billion (no one knows precisely because so many scams go unreported) go to the 
telescam artists. And the pitch can cover almost every product or service 
known, from "investments" -- such as precious metals, oil and gas leases, rare 
coins and diamonds -- to the simple "you have won a fabulous prize" scam. 
</P>
<P>
"Occasionally," L.A. County fraud investigator Aron says, "we'll get someone's 
money back, but only if it's early in the game, there aren't yet many known 
victims and the scam artist hopes that by paying off a couple of early 
complaints he can keep operating." 
</P>
<P>
In your case, unfortunately, the scam has been active for quite some time, and 
the operator would make no Brownie points with the authorities by returning 
your or anyone else's money. 
</P>
<P>
In the "investment" type scam, Aron says, the current favorite is the "dirt 
mine" approach. 
</P>
<P>
"The pitch here is that they have a gold mine and, because of new technology, 
it can now be reopened profitably. They need 'start-up' capital, however, for 
the new equipment, so they will sell you an ounce of gold for a flat $200 -- 
delivery to be made in about a year when the mine is operative. Because gold's 
now selling at about $385, how can you lose? Particularly since they promise to 
make up the difference if the price falls below $200. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Specific 'Mines' 
</P>
<P>
"By the time your year rolls around, of course," Aron continues, "they're gone. 
The New Mexico State Bureau of Mines, incidentally, sent out geologists to look 
at some of these specific 'mines.' You guessed it -- there's not a trace of 
gold in any of them." 
</P>
<P>
But, on a less pricey level, the bait that the con artists dangle before their 
victims is frequently tied to purely local concerns. That is why, in the Los 
Angeles area right now, "water filtration" devices are the rage, and the con 
artists are capitalizing on recent public disclosures of widespread 
contamination of our drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
The gimmick: A free diamond watch, mink coat or expensive car if the mark buys 
a $398 system that removes pollutants from the drinking water. This is 
generally a worthless contraption with a couple of charcoal pills in it that 
wouldn't remove any foreign object smaller than a manhole cover from the water 
supply. And, oh yes, the diamond watch, mink coat or expensive car never shows 
up. 
</P>
<P>
"Las Vegas," Aron adds, "got so sensitive about how it was being used as a 
regional center for these telemarketing people that Clark County finally passed 
an anti-boiler-room ordinance with some real teeth in it. Both the employees 
and the independent contractor have to be bonded, and it's pretty stiff -- 
about $25,000 -- and then they have to get a sheriff's work card with their 
picture and other ID on it, the same way casino employees do. If they've got a 
criminal record involving anything like telescam fraud, then they don't get the 
card." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Out-of-State Targets 
</P>
<P>
Almost invariably, Aron says, the boiler-room operators concentrate their 
telemarketing on out-of-state targets. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't want to be based in Southern California, close enough for those 
whom they victimize to actually come after them with a baseball bat. What 
'address' they do have is invariably a mail drop, though." 
</P>
<P>
But, in sheer volume, Aron said, the favorite telescam is the "you have won a 
fabulous prize" gimmick. 
</P>
<P>
"Boats, expensive cars, big-screen TVs -- you name it. They call up," Aron 
says, "and say something like: 'You remember sending in that green card when 
you bought our ballpoint pens (or office supplies, or whatever)? You don't? 
Then someone did it for you, and are you ever lucky! We just drew your name!' " 
At this point, Aron adds, "the more imaginative ones cut in a brief tape of 
people laughing and cheering in the background, and then they say: 'You've just 
won a brand-new Mercedes 300E absolutely free! On top of that we're sending, 
also absolutely free, a $300 35-millimeter camera so that your wife can take a 
picture of you beside the Mercedes, which we can use in future promotions! 
Naturally, you keep the camera too!' " 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Aron adds, there are sales taxes, handling charges, 
dealer-preparation and destination charges amounting to $1,142, which has to be 
remitted at once. 
</P>
<P>
And if you fall for even a modest $20 or $30 telescam, just once, your name 
becomes a valuable commodity in itself. You're on the "mooch" list -- names, 
addresses and telephone numbers of previous victims -- and your name is sold 
over and over again to the telescammers. 
</P>
<P>
"The theory, and it's a good one, is that if you fell once, you'll fall again," 
Aron adds. 
</P>
<P>
How do you keep from being fleeced? An old axiom is still the best, the L.A. 
County district attorney's fraud expert says: "If it sounds too good to be 
true, it almost invariably is." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lot of Questons 
</P>
<P>
But, in addition, Aron advises: "If it's an investment-type deal, tell them you 
never invest without reading the material they have on the plan -- it's an 
automatic hang-up on the caller's part. Other than that: Ask a lot of 
questions. If it's a 'free vacation certificate,' ask if you have to redeem it 
and pay extra charges. Ask specifics about what it pays for, and what it 
doesn't. Be particularly leery if the time element is critical and they insist 
on sending a courier to pick up your check. 
</P>
<P>
"Never give your credit card number over the phone to anyone except a local 
retail store that you've dealt with before. And," Aron says, "be particularly 
cautious about calls coming from the states where the telescams are most 
active: Texas, Florida, California, Arizona, Utah and, in spite of the Clark 
County ordinance, Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
"Before you send any money," he continues, "check with your local district 
attorney's consumer fraud office. We may not specifically tell you if 
such-and-such a company is on the list, but we can say something like: 'Well, 
we've had quite a few problems with people operating like this.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Progress Being Made 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the almost-tidal wave epidemic of telescams coming out of this are, 
however, progress is being made, according to David A. Katz, coordinator of the 
Southern California Fraud Task Force -- a consortium of local, state and 
federal investigative agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"In the three years we've been operating," Katz adds, "we prosecuted about 300 
fraud cases and, in the last 14 months alone, we've gotten sentences of five 
years or more in 22 of them -- several of them running into double digits." 
</P>
<P>
But I'm sorry that there's nothing really that can be done in your specific 
case. The only comfort I can give you is that the noose is tightening around 
these telescam operations, but it's not going to get you your money back. 
</P>
<P>
It's a rotten shame because at least 95% to 99% of the telemarketing business 
is strictly on the level. And then there are these others. . . .

NEW AND USEFUL: LIGHTWAVES AID PEOPLE IN THE DARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SIMROSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lightwaves are new, wearable reflective bands that will make you highly visible 
at night if you're walking, jogging or riding a bike or motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
They are available in adult and children's sizes for wrist, ankle, legs or 
head. 
</P>
<P>
"They're made of the same kind of material that goes on road signs," said 
Lightwave developer Jerry Vitera of Grinnell, Iowa. "We developed a process so 
that material will adhere to cloth and it's washable, too." 
</P>
<P>
The strips have an absorbent underside and attach with hook and loop fasteners. 
Wrist/ankle bands cost $2.95; headbands, $4; leg bands, $5. Specify adult or 
children's sizes. To order, contact Walk for Life, P.O. Box 92, Grinnell, Iowa 
50112, phone (515) 236-6209. 
</P>
<P>
Fog-Free Mirror 
</P>
<P>
ShowerTek is a fog-free shaving mirror designed by Dick Christianson of Napa, 
Calif., who came up with the product because he likes to shave in the shower 
and couldn't find a mirror that didn't cloud up. 
</P>
<P>
The acrylic mirror attaches to the shower head and allows hot water to 
circulate onto the mirror's back, raising it to shower temperature and 
eliminating condensation. It can be easily installed on standard shower heads, 
Christianson said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's uniquely designed to attach securely to the shower arm, not the wall," 
Christianson said. "The mirrors won't slip, fall down or break. Best of all, it 
saves time shaving in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
Suggested retail for ShowerTek is $29. It is available through Sharper Image 
stores and catalogue (800) 344-4444 or in the Los Angeles area at May Co., 
Longs Drugs, and Thrifty Drug. For stores in other areas, call (800) 776-6364. 
</P>
<P>
Dough Detective 
</P>
<P>
Because bogus money seems to be on the increase nationwide -- the Secret 
Service estimates that more than $1 billion a year is fraudulently printed in 
the U.S. -- merchants may be interested in Vistatector, a new pen-sized 
counterfeit currency detector. 
</P>
<P>
The device reveals magnetic particles embedded on the front of all U.S. paper 
currency, an easy way to determine a bill's authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
To use the device, place the bill on a soft, padded surface -- or on the 
optional Vistatector Security Pad -- and hold it down firmly. To activate the 
Vistatector, push the thumb button near the unit's top. A red light and 
chirping sound signify it is working properly. 
</P>
<P>
There are two steps to the test: first, rub the Vistatector rapidly from side 
to side over the bill where the dollar amount is printed under the portrait; 
second, rub it over the black Federal Reserve seal to the portrait's left. A 
tone and lights, red or green, atop the unit will indicate whether the bill is 
genuine. 
</P>
<P>
Suggested retail for Vistatector is $99.95. The optional security pad, with a 
flexible steel cord that hooks it to the device, is $19.95. To order, contact 
Security Products Division, Vistatech Enterprises Ltd., 935 Broadway, New York, 
N.Y. 10010, phone (212) 254-9851. 
</P>
<P>
Bulb Life Extender 
</P>
<P>
Power Mizer, a small disc that fits between a light bulb and the center contact 
of the socket, can extend the life of bulbs considerably while also saving 
energy, its Connecticut manufacturers report. 
</P>
<P>
"Gauged on tests of 100-watt bulbs, Power Mizer extends bulb life up to 38,000 
hours and saves 28% in energy consumption," said co-inventor Anthony Tremaglio 
of Watertown, Conn. "It limits the voltage to the bulb and there is only has a 
5 to 10% illumination decrease." 
</P>
<P>
Noting that light bulbs wear out "primarily because of the initial surge when 
you turn them on and because they operate at very high temperatures, which 
weaken the tungsten filament so it breaks," Tremaglio said the Power Mizer 
eliminates both problems so light bulbs last longer. 
</P>
<P>
Power Mizer can be used only with standard incandescent bulbs with a maximum 
capacity of 200 watts. They don't work with three-way bulbs. 
</P>
<P>
Suggested retail for a package of two Power Mizers is $3.99-$4.99. In Southern 
California, they are sold at most Ace and True Value hardware stores and 
Thrifty Drug. 
</P>
<P>
For information about stores in other areas that carry the device, write to 
Miracle Products, 182 Commercial St., Watertown, Conn. 06795, phone (203)

ROGER SIMON: TIMELY REMINDER OF IRAN-CONTRA AFFAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Roger Simon 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is February, 1987. Snow blankets the East Coast. The stock market boom 
continues. Richard Gephardt becomes the first Democrat to formally seek the 
presidency and Mario Cuomo becomes the first to announce he will not run. 
</P>
<P>
And in the capital, a lone congressman tries to interest his colleagues in an 
intriguing proposition: George Bush should be investigated for his role in the 
Iran-Contra affair with an eye toward possible impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
I interview the congressman, U.S. Rep. Bruce Morrison, a Democrat from 
Connecticut, who serves on the House Judiciary Committee. Morrison says he is 
going to write Committee Chairman Peter Rodino asking that an investigation be 
launched. 
</P>
<P>
This is a full year before Bush's role will become widely discussed in the 1988 
presidential campaign. My column is printed and the reaction of the American 
public is incredible. 
</P>
<P>
"As I recall there was no reaction," Morrison said recently. "I believe it was 
like a tree falling in a forest with no one around." 
</P>
<P>
Well, yes, I admit that's technically true. But now, all of us involved in that 
episode get to say the four most satisfying words in the English language: 
</P>
<P>
 We told you so. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in 1987, Morrison said: "The impeachment of George Bush must be explored. 
. . . The most recent period, in which the facts are still to be revealed, 
clearly implicates individuals in our government in continuing to assist, 
maintain and monitor a military supply operation for the Contras, when that was 
expressly forbidden by U.S. law." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, at Ollie North's trial in April of this year, the defense submitted a 
42-page "admission of facts" that revealed that George Bush flew to Honduras on 
March 16, 1985, and told the president of that country that the United States 
would increase military and economic aid if Honduras would continue to harbor 
and funnel military supplies to the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Bush recently said there was no "quid pro quo" in this deal and it was all 
perfectly legal. 
</P>
<P>
But as Time magazine characterized the impact of the disclosure: "If the 
revelations had come during the campaign or earlier, his (Bush's) candidacy 
might have been hurt. But now Administration officials believe that the public 
is weary of the Iran-Contra question and he can easily weather the storm." 
</P>
<P>
To which I say: Bruce Morrison tried to tell you guys, but you just didn't want 
to listen. 
</P>
<P>
When, a month after my column appeared, Morrison wrote a formal letter to 
Rodino asking for an impeachment investigation, it was not met with delight. 
Morrison was told such a letter should never have been written, such words 
should not have been put on paper and he should forget the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
No investigation of Bush was ever launched by the Judiciary Committee. "There 
was an explicit understanding that they wouldn't go after Bush," Morrison said. 
"Nobody wanted to take it seriously. My letter to the Judiciary Committee was 
just too hot to handle. But it's never a good idea to shy away from the obvious 
questions that ought to be asked and answered. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, we're right back into it and this time these questions touch on a man who 
is not the vice president, but the President. We should have been able to know 
the answers before last November. Bush's assigned role appears to be one of 
many attempts to evade the Boland Amendment. But who's going to get him now?" 
</P>
<P>
Just why Morrison couldn't get any support in 1987 is instructive. First, his 
actions looked partisan (as if that were a dirty word in Washington) because 
Bush was the leading GOP contender for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
But, second, the Democrats wanted to keep Bush's career alive and healthy. "I 
was told at the time that we don't want to knock off George Bush because we're 
going to beat him," Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
And that's what the Democrats thought in 1987. Beating Bush was going to be 
easy. George was the guy who had left no footprints. Mr. Resume. The Wimp. Gary 
Hart would make mincemeat out of the guy and even a stiff like Mike 
What's-His-Name from Massachusetts couldn't possibly lose to him. 
</P>
<P>
Yuk-yuk. 
</P>
<P>
Now, gingerly steps are being taken to more fully explore Bush's role in the 
fiasco. Some lawmakers who served on the congressional Iran-Contra probe have 
asked Bush why the documents brought out at the North trial never surfaced 
during their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Which is still, of course, a long way from impeachment inquiries. But is there 
really something to impeach Bush for? 
</P>
<P>
"The answer is: I'm not sure," Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
Which is why you have inquiries. But is the impeachment of Bush a realistic 
possibility? 
</P>
<P>
"Well," Morrison said, "it would make Dan Quayle President." 
</P>
<P>
On second thought, let's forget the whole thing.

Just in time for the opening of the new Indiana Jones movie, actor Harrison 
Ford, Paramount Pictures and Lucasfilm Ltd. will donate items Friday from the 
film trilogy to the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. 
Memorabilia to be donated include the trademark brown fedora and well-worn 
leather jacket that Ford wore in all three films: "Raiders of the Lost Ark," 
"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" and the latest, "Indiana Jones and the 
Last Crusade." The hat and jacket, which a museum spokeswoman said have 
"influenced men's fashion in the 1980s," will become part of the museum's 
History of American Entertainment collection, but will not be on public 
display. Claudia Puig

Mitzi Shore, owner of the Comedy Store and Comedy Channel Inc., has filed suit 
against Home Box Office in U.S. District Court for trademark infringement. The 
suit alleges that HBO appropriated the name and trademark "The Comedy Channel," 
of which Shore says she had exclusive ownership, having used it since 1982. The 
Comedy Channel Inc. produces, markets and distributes comedy videocassettes 
such as the Ollie Joe Prater Comedy Video and "The Girls of the Comedy Store," 
said Shore's attorney, James Blancarte. Claudia Puig

Motown legend Smokey Robinson urged 1,800 high school students in Pasadena to 
swear off drugs. "I hope you'll want to crush the dope man before he crushes 
us," Robinson told the John Muir High School students Monday. "Every time you 
buy drugs, you're feeding the dope man." Robinson, whose hit singles include 
"Tears of a Clown," "Just to See Her" and "Cruisin'," was part of a program 
that included Joseph Jennings, a former gang member and addict whose shock 
approach and accounts of tragic personal experiences had students 
spellbound.Claudia Puig

'FRIGHT NIGHT II': BITING OFF MORE THAN THEY CAN CHEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The original "Fright Night" film had a faintly homoerotic subtext, thanks to 
the presence of chief vampire Chris Sarandon, who left the impression he might 
be more than just bloodthirsty when it came to young hero William Ragsdale. 
Ultimately, though, creator Tom Holland was more interested in doing a fun, 
bloodied-up Saturday matinee than in morbid sexual tension, and Sarandon bit 
the dust before he could bite too many youthful necks. 
</P>
<P>
In "Fright Night: Part II" (citywide), the central vampire is a real vamp -- in 
the form of indeterminately exotic Julie Carmen -- and it looks as though the 
returning Ragsdale may be in real trouble this time. Finally free from the 
clutches of the psychiatric care that the previous movie's traumas landed him 
in, the kid (now in college) has repeated dreams in which he succumbs to this 
succubus' charms instead of sticking by his less hot-to-trot girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Outside of death itself, this kind of sexual paranoia and hysteria is the 
horror genre's favorite thematic standby, and for a while it looks as if 
"Fright Night II" is going to indulge in it, if not very originally, then at 
least wholeheartedly. But then its luscious bloodsucker turns out to have pure 
revenge, not seduction, on her mind, and director/co-writer Tommy Lee Wallace 
("Halloween III") proves to have nothing on his mind except effectively 
remaking the first film. 
</P>
<P>
Heads will roll (literally, in one scene in a bowling alley). But there's never 
any tension generated over the fate of the endangered young couple, or of 
worrisome Roddy McDowall, returning as "fearless vampire killer" and TV 
horror-pic host Peter Vincent. 
</P>
<P>
"Fright Night II" (rated R) looks good, thanks to the work of frequent 
Cronenberg cinematographer Mark Irwin. But it pays no more attention to 
supernatural "rules" than the first did, and try as Wallace might to duplicate 
it, it's a much slower roller-coaster ride to boot. His was a fangless task.

'TWISTED SPRING' SERIES COMES TO A CLOSE AT LACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oddly paired works completed the "Twisted Spring" programs of 
choreographer-composer collaborations Friday at Los Angeles Contemporary 
Exhibitions (LACE). 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Elgart's "Blind Faith" resembled an MTV video. Emphasis was on striking, 
high-gloss production values (14 trunk-size blocks of ice, moodily lit). The 
dancers wore military-chic costumes, nattily torn and expertly tailored. The 
choreography consisted of bite-sized bits of movement, often amplified into 
depersonalized chorus-line unisons. 
</P>
<P>
Ideas were arresting -- seven "blind" dancers with white-tipped canes 
staggering around the stage -- but even at 40 long minutes, went unplumbed, 
undeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Tomney created the serviceable musique concrete score. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Nancy Lee's "From Grace," for all its clumsiness and obscurity, at 
least had the virtue of psychological probing, tracing the progress of a 
modern-day pilgrim (a secure Sara Wolf) toward some kind of illumination. 
</P>
<P>
But who or what were the three gymnastic ladies (Suzee Goldman, Sun-Mi Jin and 
Jane Real)? Muses? Graces? Norns? Antagonists? Disciples? Maybe all of the 
above. 
</P>
<P>
Though not closely tied to the music, the work also had the benefit of Andrew 
Picken's attractive, Irish folk tune-inspired score, played sensitively by 
violinists Jolianne Von Einem and Sue Giordano, violist J. Lee Graham an 
cellist Susanna P. Reilly. CHRIS PASLES

PIERRE BOULEZ CLOSES GREEN UMBRELLA SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like a courier bearing transfusions of fresh blood at the eleventh hour, Pierre 
Boulez, visiting the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the end of a long and wearying 
season, brings more than the promise of survival. He offers hope beyond the 
current crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Boulez has done this before, and with his familiar magic. Still, the 
conductor/composer's presence on our musical scene, most recently at the 
closing of the Philharmonic's 1988-89 Green Umbrella series in Japan America 
Theatre, has a sense of the miraculous about it. 
</P>
<P>
As always, Boulez on Monday night brought something new -- this time a recent 
work by a protege from IRCAM in Paris, Marc-Andre Dalbavie, "Diademes." 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago Dalbavie, who was born in 1961, created this large-scale 
chamber piece for solo (electronically altered) viola, electronic ensemble and 
instruments -- the performers numbering 18. "Diademes" juxtaposes massive 
blocks of sound moving heavily through time, something aurally analogous to the 
motion of continental shelves as they shift their weight, slowly. 
</P>
<P>
But "Diademes" is no behemoth, despite its 27-minute length. Dalbavie seems to 
use his forces cleverly, and in contrasting combinations, and the electronics 
-- ubiquitous but seldom overpowering -- are practically subtle, as these 
things go. What this promising young composer will come up with, over the long 
haul, one cannot predict. This piece, however, seemed to deserve its spot. 
</P>
<P>
The able performers at this West Coast premiere included violist Dale Hikawa. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the remainder of the program surveyed more familiar territory 
with fresh ears. 
</P>
<P>
Performed in memory of Lawrence Morton, Stravinsky's Eight Instrumental 
Miniatures (1962) again reminded one listener of the atmosphere of 
adventurousness that prevailed over all of Morton's musical projects -- most 
memorably at the Ojai Festival and at Monday Evening Concerts -- in his heyday. 
</P>
<P>
Even more bracing, Boulez's subsequent, and probing, reading of Schoenberg's 
Serenade, Opus 24, restored the characterful qualities of this cherishable 
septet. 
</P>
<P>
But the high point of this generous program was the revival of Boulez's own 
"Improvisation sur Mallarme" No. 2, as sung by soprano Phyllis Bryn-Julson, 
with Lou Anne Neill (harp), Zita Carno (celesta), Gloria Cheng (piano), and 
percussionists Mitchell Peters, Raynor Carroll, Mark Zimoski, Karen Ervin, 
Charles DeLancey and Erik Forrester. 
</P>
<P>
The work remains impenetrable, fascinating, poignant and mysterious, and the 
care lavished upon it by Bryn-Julson, conductor Boulez and their associates 
brought out all its facets.DANIEL CARIAGA

WORKS BY SCHAFFER, STERN AT WESTSIDE ACADEMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a tongue-in-cheek prologue to an evening of their work at Westside Academy 
of Dance, Karl Schaffer and Erik Stern explained which parts of the program 
could be considered art (and thus interpreted) and which could not. 
</P>
<P>
Thereafter, on Saturday these two California-based choreographers presented 
ironic, text-based pieces that explored how people conceptualize experience. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes movement merely decorated a text, as in Stern's "Tiresome 
Explanations," a hilarious compendium of the excuses found on insurance-claim 
forms. But words and motion matched perfectly in two inspired satires about 
over-analyzing dance. 
</P>
<P>
Schaffer's post-Cunningham-style solo "Fad" verbally defined and mocked itself 
as it went along. Stern's duet, "Ethnic Dance," cast him as an ineffectual 
academic explaining break-dance (in French) while Chris Jones provided 
demonstrations that needed no commentary. 
</P>
<P>
Because "thinking too precisely on the event" is their favorite theme, it was 
inevitable that Stern and Schaffer choreograph "Hamlet." However, their "To Be 
or Not to Be" duet proved strangely prim and dutiful, except for their inspired 
shuffle-off-to-Buffalo on the line about shuffling off this mortal coil. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Stern and Schaffer are prisoners of logic. Certainly their work can 
seem doggedly, predictably schematic, whether it's the rhythmic litany of 
corporation names in "Mating Call" (Stern's duet with singer Joyce Fleming) or 
their new, collaborative piece for Pacific Dance Ensemble, "The Curse of 
E.S.P." 
</P>
<P>
Alas, a suite about dancers who dance while they think about something else 
merely encourages the audience to think about something else too.LEWIS SEGAL

BARGAINING IS REVIVED ON SCHOOL STRIKE ISSUES; 
</P>
<P>
INFORMAL SESSIONS WITH LEGISLATORS BRING NEW FACE-TO-FACE TALKS; ANOTHER 
MEETING SET TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN and SAM ENRIQUEZ, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an unusual move to determine who is telling the truth in the increasingly 
bitter Los Angeles teachers' strike, area legislators called both sides to 
Sacramento on Tuesday for a series of informal closed-door meetings that ended 
with a face-to-face bargaining session. 
</P>
<P>
Union and school district delegations flew separately to the capital in an 
effort to resolve some of the confusion over conflicting reports of salary 
offers and perhaps bring the strike, now in its second week, closer to an end. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said the aim of the impromptu face-to-face talks, which lasted almost 
two hours and ended after 9 p.m., was to lay the groundwork for substantive 
bargaining sessions and to come up with a list of issues still dividing the two 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Signs of Movement 
</P>
<P>
When the session broke up, Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) would 
say only that she was "very, very pleased" that the two sides had agreed to ask 
a state mediator to meet with them in Los Angeles this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
As the meetings began early Tuesday afternoon, state Senate President Pro Tem 
David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) described what was taking place as "a 
fact-finding mission." 
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping we can bring them back to the table. . . . If we can help, we 
will do it," said Roberti, who was one of 19 Democratic Assembly and Senate 
members who met with union and school board representatives in a series of 
separate meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Also discussed was the windfall $2.5-billion state surplus announced last week. 
The Los Angeles Unified School District may be in line for as much as $48 
million in additional funds this year, school officials said. But the 
Legislature and governor's office must still determine when the money will 
become available and just what part of it can be designated for teachers' 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
Although both sides described the talks with legislators as cordial, they were 
unsure what impact they might ultimately have on the strike. 
</P>
<P>
The legislators are "interested in what we had done and why we had done it and 
they wanted to know how they could be helpful," said school board member Jackie 
Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
School board members say they offered teachers a three-year contract with 
guaranteed 8% raises each year in a bargaining session that ended in rancor 
Sunday. Union officials have denied that any such offer was formally made. 
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Sacramento on Tuesday morning, United Teachers-Los Angeles 
President Wayne Johnson again insisted that a formal offer was never made and 
he volunteered to take a polygraph test to prove his point. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who last week called for a 26% increase over three years, said Tuesday 
that an increase of 8% each year "is somewhat of an acceptable figure . . . an 
offer we would consider as part of a package." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conditions for Talks 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also announced in the morning that he was ready to resume bargaining 
Tuesday night, but only if the school board agreed to a face-to-face session. 
</P>
<P>
But district spokeswoman Diana Munatones said that the next round of 
negotiations will take place "when the state mediator asks us, not when Johnson 
decides." The face-to-face meeting in Sacramento was apparently at the urging 
of state legislators. 
</P>
<P>
Munatones conceded that the 24% offer was "informal" but insisted that the 
district would have formalized it if union representatives hadn't "scoffed" and 
"angrily rejected it immediately." She added that the 24% offer is "no longer 
on the bargaining table" and that the district's "formal" offer remains 21.5% 
over three years. 
</P>
<P>
As both sides were heading north Tuesday morning, 686 more teachers crossed the 
picket lines and returned to classrooms. More students were trickling in as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance reports for the day showed that 300,944 of the district's 594,000 
students attended class Tuesday -- up 7,426 from Monday, but still down 
considerably from the 430,000 figure on the first day of the strike. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the district canceled its 4-A division baseball championship 
playoffs because of the walkout, affecting 16 senior high school boys' teams. 
The head coaches of all the teams refused to coach during the strike, district 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Separate Flights 
</P>
<P>
With relations worsening between the two sides since talks broke off and with 
no new negotiating session slated, Johnson, with two aides, and school Supt. 
Leonard Britton and two school board members caught separate late-morning 
flights to Sacramento to discuss the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Union officials said that Assemblywoman Teresa Hughes (D-Los Angeles), who 
chairs the Assembly Education Committee, had been in touch with Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"She wanted the full story from each side why there isn't a settlement," said 
union spokeswoman Catherine Carey. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Britton, school board members Roberta Weintraub, Goldberg, 
negotiator Dick Fisher and financial officer Robert Booker made up the 
district's contingent. 
</P>
<P>
District officials said board President Weintraub had received a call from 
Assemblywoman Waters on Monday morning, inviting the district to the capital to 
explain the breakdown in talks and the state funding situation. 
</P>
<P>
"We were summoned to come up here," said Goldberg during the flight north. "The 
Los Angeles delegation called to say, 'What's going on down there?' They called 
it an invitation but I felt definitely summoned. . . . They wanted to hear it 
from the horse's mouth." 
</P>
<P>
By the time the talks finally ended Tuesday night, the district and union 
representatives had missed the last flight of the day from Sacramento and were 
scurrying to find Los Angeles-bound flights from other Bay area cities. 
</P>
<P>
In the marathon session, both sides said they lobbied for early release of the 
extra state funds. 
</P>
<P>
But state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig called the issue of the extra 
money irrelevant as long as the school board is willing to pay a guaranteed 24% 
pay increase. Until Sunday, the district's highest offer had been the 21.5% pay 
increase, with an additional 2.5% contingent on available funds from 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why the strike is continuing," Honig said. "There is no reason if 
everyone agrees 8-8-8 is fair. 
</P>
<P>
"All they have to do is go into a room and (agree). It's unconscionable to me 
they haven't worked it out." 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson has refused to be pinned down on whether the union would accept a 
24% offer unless other concessions are made by the district on such things as 
school management and wages lost by teachers during pre-strike job actions. 
"I'm not prepared to say yes or no," Johnson said of the offer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Teachers' Responses 
</P>
<P>
On the picket lines Tuesday, teachers differed on whether they would accept a 
24% package. But many agreed with Johnson that it would take more than money to 
get them back in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
"It's beyond money -- it's a matter of principle," said Rosalind Williams, a 
seven-year teacher at Manual Arts High School. 
</P>
<P>
Echoed Jefferson High School teacher Cathy Armstrong, "We've been underpaid so 
long, it would have to be a magnificent offer to be something that a person 
could live on. My feeling is if we can really improve the working conditions 
and have school-based management, I believe most teachers would be willing to 
make a compromise." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the wage issue, a major sticking point is a board proposal that school 
management councils, to decide such issues as school discipline, be evenly 
divided between teachers and district appointees. 
</P>
<P>
Union leaders say the proposal is unacceptable because it gives teachers 
insufficient power in deciding school issues. 
</P>
<P>
Current starting pay for Los Angeles teachers is $23,440 and the top is 
$43,319, although that amount can be raised by extracurricular and summer 
school duties. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development Tuesday, the state Court of Appeal denied the union's 
request for emergency relief against the district's withholding of paychecks 
from teachers who have refused to submit roll books and student attendance 
records and grades. 
</P>
<P>
About 16,500 of about 28,000 regular teachers have already complied with the 
superintendent's earlier directive that they turn in the records, the district 
said.

The air seethes with mistrust and intrigue. As angry opponents mass outside, 
police cars race to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Forget the bitter rifts that routinely topple national governments. This is 
politics -- the Filipino-American Community of Los Angeles Inc. trying to 
straighten out its latest tiff. 
</P>
<P>
"We have customs -- if you're hurt you have to fight," explained Roland B. 
Fernandez, president of the nonprofit community group known as FACLA. "It's not 
for the benefit or welfare of the community. It's pride." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hard at Work 
</P>
<P>
Despite the stormy events of that March afternoon, Filipino leaders say they 
are working harder than ever these days to create a more unified community in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
And they have reason: Filipinos are now believed to be the largest Asian ethnic 
group in Southern California, with 155,000 living in Los Angeles County alone, 
a United Way study found. 
</P>
<P>
Yet if the community has grown dramatically, it remains remarkably invisible to 
those outside it. Filipinos often have Spanish last names, speak English and 
blend into the mainstream. There is no Philippine version of Chinatown or 
Little Tokyo; efforts to create one sparked rival factions that called a truce 
only recently. 
</P>
<P>
"If we were to group together, to work as a team -- wow -- it would be a very 
powerful force," said Solomon U. Lorenzana, whose market on North Vermont 
Avenue offers Philippine videos and magazines and such native cuisine as 
embotido, a sort of meatloaf with raisins. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Acknowledges Barriers 
</P>
<P>
But Lorenzana knows that unity won't come easily: "I could go 50 miles from one 
town in the Philippines to another and not understand a single word -- not a 
single word. We don't understand each other. We have different 
characteristics." 
</P>
<P>
That may be an understatement. The Philippines is a cacophony of dialects on a 
jumble of islands. Ninety languages are spoken in the land of 7,100 volcanic 
islands (mostly unnamed and little-populated) sprawling between Taiwan and 
Indonesia. "For us to be able to communicate with each other is a marvel in 
itself," said Artemio G. Pagdan, a neurologist in Pomona who came to the United 
States in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts are not always successful. Elections at FACLA -- which has about 4,000 
members but is just one of hundreds of Filipino organizations in the area -- 
have sparked lawsuits, countersuits and at least one near-riot in recent 
months. 
</P>
<P>
The confusing leadership fracas at FACLA headquarters is still being fought out 
in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
"If we hadn't intervened, that had the potential to become a big brawl," 
recalled Ernie Valdez, an officer with the Los Angeles Police Department's 
Asian Task Force, who called for backup units after arriving at the FACLA 
building in March. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the matter of Ferdinand E. Marcos, the Philippines' deposed 
ruler. Passions over his regime split the community bitterly in recent years, 
although the divisions may be gradually fading. 
</P>
<P>
"People in the Philippines take their politics personally," Pagdan added, in a 
statement heard over and over in conversations with Filipinos. 
</P>
<P>
How personally? "There's a lot of vote-buying," said Ernie Lopez, a Los Angeles 
police officer from Manila, of past elections for the FACLA presidency. "I'm 
talking about people mortgaging their house and borrowing huge sums of money to 
get this position." 
</P>
<P>
If politics can polarize, there is one thing the Filipinos share: a strong 
historical link to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The first immigrants, or Pinoys, arrived here in the 1760s when Filipino 
sailors deserted Spanish galleons to build wooden houses in the bayous of 
Louisiana, according to historians. In 1898, as a result of the 
Spanish-American War, the Philippines became a U.S. colony, after 350 years of 
Spanish domination. The islands did not gain independence until after World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
The colonial legacy endures: English vies with Tagalog as the most widely 
understood tongue. The languages even mix together in a slang known as Taglish. 
"Filipinos are comfortable in the (U.S.) language and the culture. Maybe overly 
so," observed Gil Roy D. Gorre, editor of the Philippine American News in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Language Proficiency 
</P>
<P>
English skills help many Filipino immigrants get jobs quickly in the United 
States. Many arrive here prepared for work in health care and other 
professions. More than 8% of the registered nurses in Los Angeles County public 
hospitals and other health facilities are from the Philippines, according to 
the county's Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
Most gauges of the Filipinos' economic success in America are out of date, 
relying on 1980 census data. But they suggest that many recent immigrants have 
fared well. 
</P>
<P>
An analysis of 1980 census data by the U.S. Civil Rights Commission found that 
Filipinos, after 10 years in this country, had higher incomes than comparable 
Chinese and Vietnamese immigrants. They also surpassed the earnings of white 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, a United Way study ranked Filipino household income of 
$23,693 in 1980 as the highest of all Asian ethnic groups (Japanese-Americans 
placed second.) 
</P>
<P>
Yet the very assets that help Filipinos thrive in America may also have a down 
side. The Filipinos, for example, seem to place lower emphasis on helping new 
immigrants with credit and other social support than do some other Asian 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
"Our individual assets become a detriment to us collectively," lamented David 
C. Guillermo, a Los Angeles public school teacher. "Each individual can say, 'I 
don't need you. I'll push ahead on my own.' " 
</P>
<P>
In fact, many Filipinos live in inconspicuous enclaves throughout Southern 
California. There are concentrations close to downtown -- both near Temple 
Street and on Wilshire Boulevard -- and in San Pedro, Wilmington, Cerritos, 
Carson and West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
But these neighborhoods have never spawned visible centers of commerce and 
culture, such as Little Saigon -- the Vietnamese hub in Westminster and Garden 
Grove -- or booming Koreatown in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first five or even 10 years, the Koreans who come to America are most 
likely to go to a Korean bookstore, grocer and insurance agent," Gorre 
maintained. "That creates a geographically defined center for them. But the 
Filipinos don't feel subject to those same forces." 
</P>
<P>
Once they did. In the 1920s and 1930s Filipino pioneers who journeyed to 
California for jobs in canneries and farmlands settled in Little Manila, near 
today's Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
But, in the first of a series of setbacks for the community, Little Manila was 
destroyed by redevelopment efforts. Many of the pioneers who lived there 
resettled in the area along Temple Street and Beverly Boulevard, between Union 
and Rampart streets. 
</P>
<P>
After World War II, a different sort of immigration began, as more educated 
Filipinos opted for life in America. That wave accelerated when U.S. 
immigration barriers to Asians were eased in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Filipinos make up 21% of the county's entire Asian-Pacific population, 
according to the United Way study conducted in 1987. Americans of Japanese and 
Chinese descent each make up 20%. By some unofficial estimates, the Filipino 
community throughout Southern California may number 500,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the largest Asian community in America," Gorre declared. "The 1990 
census is going to come up with a very big surprise on the Philippine 
community." 
</P>
<P>
While the new focus is on skilled, sophisticated immigrants, problems also are 
emerging. A few years ago, the Los Angeles Police Department counted 32 loosely 
knit Filipino gangs, with such names as Satana and Crazys, Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, earlier immigrants face the travails of growing old, often with 
little money, in high-crime neighborhoods near downtown. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leisure Times 
</P>
<P>
"The old people are still there, playing cards under the trees," said Connie L. 
Guerrero, executive director of the nonprofit Filipino American Service Group, 
which maintains a storefront community center next to a Chinese restaurant in a 
neighborhood of many Central American immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
The recent report by the Civil Rights Commission pointed to a striking schism 
in the Filipino community. In contrast to the successful wave of recent 
immigrants, the U.S.-born families of earlier, unskilled Filipino immigrants 
suffered much more poverty than other longtime Asian-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Now, some Filipinos argue that the time has come to tackle these and other 
problems. The key, they say, is greater political clout through greater unity. 
</P>
<P>
"We were here ahead of the Koreans and the Vietnamese and the Cambodians. All 
of them have accomplished a lot by getting together and asserting their rights, 
and we're just minding our business individually," said Pagdan, the 
neurologist. 
</P>
<P>
Such arguments lead Filipinos straight to Philippine Town, the symbolic 
business-cultural hub that never has been achieved. But it isn't for lack of 
trying. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, Edgar O. Yap, an engineer from Manila, sought to build "the 
pioneer Filipino business-cultural complex in America" on the site of a vacant 
lot and some small buildings he owned on Temple Street a few blocks west of 
Alvarado. 
</P>
<P>
Yap's vision was ambitious: an eight-story hotel with a penthouse for foreign 
dignitaries, a professional building and a community center for the elderly. 
The hope was that other investors would follow, leading to a privately financed 
Philippine Town. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it never got off the ground. "It's a lot of dreams, I guess," said Yap, 48, 
who has put his properties up for sale in an effort to bolster his battered 
finances. "I've got all the things in my mind, but it's not working out the way 
I envisioned it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lack of Funds 
</P>
<P>
Zoning restrictions forced him to cut back the scale of his project, and he 
failed to recruit sufficient financial backing within the Filipino community, 
he said. Political support, meanwhile, ebbed and flowed as the Temple Street 
neighborhood was shuffled from the City Council districts of John Ferraro to 
Michael Woo to Gloria Molina. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on top of everything else, a new group of Philippine Town advocates 
popped up. Perplexed government officials struggled to sort out the difference 
between Yap's group, known as Nayong Pilipinas (Tagalog for Philippine Town), 
and the rival, which called itself the Philippine Town Movement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not for me to determine who the Filipino leadership is," Molina said in 
an interview. "I think they themselves have to talk about what the goals are 
and get it integrated in their strategy." 
</P>
<P>
The job of creating communitywide goals is far from done. Class divisions 
endure, for example, with a small Filipino elite keeping its distance from the 
broader ethnic community. "We don't even talk to them," Pagdan said of the 
wealthiest Filipinos. "We don't even know who they are or how to get hold of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Competing philosophies also linger on the role that personal profit should play 
in developing the community. 
</P>
<P>
For his own part, Yap has not given up on developing a profitable hotel 
complex, and has lately taken his quest to British investors who he said are 
weighing the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"If it will be successful, I can go to San Francisco -- there's a large 
Filipino community in San Francisco," Yap said. "There's a lot of Filipinos in 
San Diego and New York. We can have franchises." 
</P>
<P>
Others prefer to emphasize collective efforts, with profits from a community 
hub reinvested in the community. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Draws a Distinction 
</P>
<P>
"When people are thinking that this (Philippine Town) is for the community -- 
rather than to enrich sombody who has property in the community -- those are 
two different things," said Oscar Domondon, a Long Beach dentist. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even as philosophical tensions smolder, signs of change are emerging. 
</P>
<P>
Near Temple and Alvarado streets, for example, the $3-million Luzon Plaza is 
almost complete, its prospective Filipino tenants to include lawyers, a dentist 
and possibly part of the Philippine Consulate. 
</P>
<P>
"One neighbor said, 'Why are you taking such a risk?' " said Val G. Ramos, one 
of the plaza's developers and a native of the Philippine island of Luzon. "We 
can't just keep saying we need a Philippine Town. We have to take some action." 
</P>
<P>
It is a message that may be gaining currency. In recent months, the 
once-feuding factions behind Philippine Town have formed a joint advisory 
council to tackle issues of strategy and government aid. 
</P>
<P>
Frank S. Ignacio, a caterer who is trying to spearhead unity efforts, recalls 
that he "almost had a heart attack" preparing for the first unity meeting last 
November. 
</P>
<P>
But encouraged by the results, he now declares: "We're coming of age. We're 
dealing with the issue."

LEASE SALE HELD ALMOST CERTAIN TO LEAD TO SPILL 
</P>

<P>
Proposed new oil drilling off the coast of Southern California would 
appreciably increase the chance of a large oil spill in the region and make a 
major spill almost certain within the next 31 years, according to a new 
assessment by the Department of the Interior. 
</P>
<P>
The study, the government's first official estimate of oil spill risks from the 
sale of new Southern California leases, found 1 chance in 7 of a "large" spill 
of 1,000 barrels or more resulting from the proposed federal Lease Sale 95, 
which would include sites off the coast from Ventura County south to the 
Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
That prospect would make all but certain a large spill resulting from Lease 
Sale 95 or continuing Southern California offshore oil drilling under existing 
federal and state leases, according to the assessment. This calculation 
includes the possibility of a spill not only from the drilling but also from 
associated tanker traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The risk assessment, prepared for the White House task force weighing whether 
the Southern California lease sale should proceed, was presented to the panel's 
working group last week. A briefing paper was made available to The Times on 
Tuesday, and its conclusions were confirmed by Administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
The report, assembled by the Interior Department's Minerals Management Service, 
did not attempt to estimate the odds of a major oil spill from existing 
offshore operations, if Lease Sale 95 is not approved. 
</P>
<P>
But it contended that the proposed drilling in the Lease Sale 95 area would be 
far less likely to cause a spill than other continuing oil-related activity off 
the Southern California shore. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the report showed that new offshore drilling would account for 
just 4% of the overall risk to Southern California of a "very large" spill of 
10,000 barrels or more. In contrast, tankers carrying Alaskan oil make up 
nearly half of that risk. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect that new drilling would result in such a "very large" spill was 
put at 1 in 20. Approval of such activity would raise to 94% the overall 
likelihood that the region would suffer such a 10,000-barrel-plus spill in the 
next three decades, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, 77,000 barrels of oil were spilled in the Santa Barbara platform 
blowout of 1969. About 240,000 barrels were spilled this spring in Prince 
William Sound when the Exxon Valdez ran aground on a submerged reef. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Urge Cancellation 
</P>
<P>
Leading opponents of offshore drilling pointed to the projected increased risk 
as further reason that the proposed lease sale off Southern California -- and 
other plans for drilling off the coasts of Central and Northern California -- 
ought to be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, some argued that the prospect of a drilling-related spill is 
far greater than the Interior Department contended, and accused the Bush 
Administration of seeking to play down the risk. 
</P>
<P>
"They're doctoring numbers again," charged Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), 
noting that the assessment formula used by Interior's Minerals Management 
Service had previously been criticized as biased by other government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the fact that they are trying to come to the most benign possible 
conclusion, even that conclusion should raise concerns," Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure of the Interior Department risk assessment came as the task 
force was preparing to convene in Los Angeles today to hear testimony about the 
lease sale from public officials and private citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The risk analysis by the Minerals Management Service was to have been included 
in an Interior Department study assessing the environmental impact of the 
proposed lease sale. Its publication was postponed until after the White House 
task force completes its deliberations at the end of the year, Interior 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The task force, headed by Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan Jr., has been 
ordered to examine whether the offshore drilling plans should be modified or 
canceled out of concern that such activity might cause significant 
environmental harm. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates of "oil spill occurrence risk" for Southern California were presented 
to the task force in bar graph form, with the prospect that Lease Sale 95 might 
result in a large oil spill in coming decades portrayed as hovering near 15%. 
</P>
<P>
However, Robert P. LaBelle, a senior MMS official involved in drafting the 
report, cautioned that the statistics should not be interpreted as "predictions 
of future spill events." 
</P>
<P>
"These are estimates to be given in an environmental analysis," LaBelle said. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates by the MMS of the oil spill risk posed by Lease Sale 95 were based 
initially on the assumption that the new drilling would yield 230 million 
barrels of oil that would have to be produced and transported to shore over the 
next 31 years. 
</P>
<P>
Other assessments took account of U.S. experience, which has shown that tankers 
and pipelines pose a considerably greater risk of spills than do oil platforms.

MANAGING THE MOJAVE: A STRUGGLE FOR THE BLM

<P>
Afton Canyon, a four-mile ribbon of green wetlands wedged between majestically 
weathered rock walls in the middle of California's Mojave Desert, has attracted 
many people for many reasons over the last century. 
</P>
<P>
It has a reputation as a cattle trail, campground, firearms range, off-road 
motorcycle course and bird-watcher's paradise. Wildlife, such as bighorn sheep, 
also come to the canyon for its life-giving, year-round Mojave River flow. 
</P>
<P>
But in trying to accommodate each of those often conflicting reputations at the 
same time, Afton Canyon has earned a new reputation as a clear example of the 
problems preventing the Bureau of Land Management from properly managing the 
Mojave. 
</P>
<P>
Conservationists and others say the California desert is too big for the BLM to 
manage well with the number of employees it can afford. At the same time -- 
though the desert itself covers a quarter of the state -- its most popular 
areas are not big enough to accommodate all the people who want to use them. 
</P>
<P>
Conflicts are common: motorcyclists wrestling with backpackers, gold miners 
pitted against environmentalists and cattlemen battling conservationists. Even 
the U.S. Army has joined the war over the desert; it wants to expand its 
tank-training grounds at Ft. Irwin. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Bureau of Land Management is expected to mediate compromises 
among these users while also planning a balanced and sustainable future for 12 
million acres of desert -- not unlike the way city planners zone suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
An increasingly common opinion is that the BLM has, in many ways, failed. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, concern over the potential for the permanent loss of some resources -- 
especially wildlife habitat and wilderness -- has spurred a campaign by Sen. 
Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and the Wilderness Society to take the state's desert 
from the BLM and turn it over to the National Park Service for preservation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Push for Park Status 
</P>
<P>
They contend that strict preservation as a national park is the only way to 
assure the long-term survival of a deceptively delicate and vital land rich in 
anthropological resources, wildlife and plants, including the planet's oldest 
living thing, an 11,700-year-old creosote bush. 
</P>
<P>
And, scientists say, so little is known about the desert that entirely new life 
forms may be waiting to be found there. For example, Robert Stebbins, professor 
emeritus of zoology at UC Berkeley, has turned up a large-eyed toad in Afton 
Canyon that may establish a new amphibian species. 
</P>
<P>
But the debate over how to protect the desert has, in turn, sparked its own 
debate. Some conservationists challenge the assumption, implicit in Cranston's 
bill, that the BLM is incapable of preserving environmentally sensitive areas. 
Instead, they contend that the bureau has simply been prevented from doing its 
job by political manipulation and under-funding. 
</P>
<P>
For these BLM watchers, the battle over the future of the California desert -- 
and a similar debate that is developing over Utah's rugged canyon and desert 
wilderness -- also are battles over the future of the Bureau of Land Management 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Morale Factor 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever an attractive piece of property is discovered in BLM hands, some 
group or another asks to take it away," said former BLM Director Frank Gregg, 
now working at the University of Arizona. "What that does is demoralize those 
in the agency who have spent their careers -- with considerable success in many 
cases -- trying to move the bureau away from being only a commodity-development 
agency and toward (becoming) a real resource-management agency." 
</P>
<P>
Paul J. Culhane, environmental adviser to former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt 
before joining the faculty at Northern Illinois University, said stripping the 
desert from the BLM could prove problematical for conservationists in the long 
run because it would cement the bureau's reputation as an exploitation agency 
-- as when it is chided as the "Bureau of Livestock and Mining." 
</P>
<P>
"There are good things to be said for letting BLM keep wilderness areas," like 
those proposed for transfer to the Park Service, he said. "It reinforces to the 
agency the fact that there are recreationists and others out there, and they 
serve them too. 
</P>
<P>
"If you isolate BLM to deal only with consumptive users," he added, "you narrow 
its view and its approach to other users." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Hastey, director of BLM operations in California, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"If people continue to carve out these little bits for parks and things," he 
said, "it is going to make it much harder for us to manage the rest of it -- 
areas of less publicity." 
</P>
<P>
Conservationists favoring the desert bill remain suspicious of the BLM for many 
reasons, such as its reluctance to routinely require miners or mining companies 
to post reclamation bonds -- money put in trust to assure that tailings and 
other toxic wastes will not simply be abandoned once a mine is exhausted. BLM's 
semi-independent Nevada state office has balked at requiring such bonds, even 
though the conservative Nevada Mining Assn. itself came out in favor of the 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
California activists, meanwhile, remember a unilateral revision of the 1980 
Desert Conservation Plan by an assistant secretary of the Interior after final 
public hearings were held. BLM workers said the handwritten addendum, allowing 
cattle grazing in a bighorn sheep preserve, was meant to benefit a subsistence 
rancher with 14 children. Critics said the change accommodates "any" grazing -- 
and, in any case, exposes the sheep to potentially deadly bovine diseases. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Internal Dissent 
</P>
<P>
The dissent extends to the BLM staff. As early as 1976, 18 BLM employees wrote 
an internal memorandum, eventually leaked to the press, that criticized the 
California BLM office for routinely ignoring scientific advice and federal laws 
while catering to motorcyclists and other special-interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
Others within the BLM are less critical of the bureau's record, but there still 
is considerable internal debate over how best to administer the Mojave Desert, 
one of the most sensitive and sought-after pieces of public land controlled by 
the agency. 
</P>
<P>
Last February, such internal criticism erupted publicly when Hastey, acting 
against the advice of his own staff expert, asked the California Department of 
Fish and Game to wait up to four years before listing the desert tortoise as a 
state threatened species. 
</P>
<P>
He said BLM needed the time to develop its own tortoise-protection program, but 
he later privately told a reporter that he also feared a negative reaction from 
ranchers and off-road vehicle users, whose activities would be curtailed if the 
tortoise were given threatened-species protection. 
</P>
<P>
"How can we Americans poke our fingers at South American countries for not 
preserving the Amazon rain forest when we're letting the western Mojave Desert 
deteriorate?" said Kristin Berry, a BLM zoologist in the western Mojave. "We're 
giving it all away to a few Marlboro men on motorbikes." 
</P>
<P>
Hastey discounted that charge. He said the BLM -- pressured by the Cranston 
bill and a growing public awareness of what the desert has to offer -- is 
redoubling its efforts to find that elusive balance of demands Congress 
mandated when it approved the 1976 Federal Land Policy and Management Act, or 
FLPMA. 
</P>
<P>
"We have -- I think, quite well -- balanced those socioeconomic needs with the 
need to preserve some of these (natural resources)," Hastey said, citing the 
bureau's efforts to preserve the habitat of such endangered species as the kit 
fox and fringe-toed lizard. 
</P>
<P>
Hastey also cited management of the King Range in Northern California, the 
first Wilderness Conservation Area, as an example of BLM's ability to balance 
conflicting interests in an innovative fashion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Land Swaps Praised 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, conservationists praise the BLM for using land swaps to preserve 
valuable wildlife habitat along Arizona's San Pedro River in the nation's first 
Riparian Conservation Area. 
</P>
<P>
But, as in the past, BLM employees find their job made difficult by a lack of 
adequate funding and the confrontation politics that result when interests 
collide. Confrontations are especially acute in arid lands, since most users, 
whether they prefer wildlife or strip mines, want land with water or access. 
</P>
<P>
Afton Canyon is blessed -- or cursed -- with both. 
</P>
<P>
Its early popularity as a cattle trail and wildlife habitat was compounded in 
the 1960s, when the BLM built a campground linking Afton Canyon with Interstate 
40 east of Barstow. 
</P>
<P>
But the bureau lacked both the money and mandate to staff the campground as the 
National Park Service or U.S. Forest Service might have done. Intense, often 
unregulated vehicle traffic, shooting and cattle grazing resulted, scarring the 
land and destroying native vegetation. Bighorn sheep eventually moved off into 
the open desert and grew dependent on cattle-watering troughs called 
"guzzlers." 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the BLM named the canyon an "area of critical environmental concern" 
-- a designation meant to qualify it for special protective management. But 
Reagan Administration budgets never contained money to manage the canyon, so 
the environmental degradation continued. 
</P>
<P>
Pressured by the campaign to turn the desert into a national park, the BLM last 
year proposed a plan to stop the destruction of Afton Canyon by limiting human 
activity in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the BLM plan would prohibit motorcycles and all-terrain 
vehicles from driving along the delicate stream bed and up the severely scarred 
hillsides, and would assure allocation of enough rangers to enforce the law. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists were ecstatic over the BLM proposal. Judy Anderson of the 
California Desert Protection League called the proposal "the only gutsy thing 
the BLM has done in years." 
</P>
<P>
Off-road vehicle owners were outraged. Richard MacPherson of the California 
Assn. of 4-Wheel Drive Clubs asserted that "there is nothing drastically wrong 
out there" and characterized the BLM plan as "management through closure." 
</P>
<P>
The polarization -- a result of the BLM's exploitative history clashing with 
its new conservation mandate -- has left the bureau in an increasingly familiar 
bind: MacPherson has threatened to sue if the BLM implements the plan, and the 
Sierra Club has threatened to sue if BLM tries to modify it. 
</P>
<P>
MacPherson said, "There is very little documentation to prove the vehicles 
passing through bother wildlife." But Stebbins, the zoologist, said tire tracks 
crisscross the pool of water containing tadpoles bred by the new and possibly 
endangered species of toad he and others are studying. 
</P>
<P>
Others note that the desert, being a dry environment, is slow to heal. Even 
though BLM managers say off-road vehicle users clearly are more environmentally 
sensitive now than in the past, tracks cut in the desert decades ago are still 
plainly visible. 
</P>
<P>
Conservationists say such tracks, some of which were cut by tanks preparing to 
fight in World War II nearly 50 years ago, are more than ugly; they also 
encourage soil erosion and damage vegetation. To limit the impact of the 
vehicles, they are now limited to designated "off-highway vehicle areas." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Race Through Desert 
</P>
<P>
"I may not like motorcycles, but it is not my place to tell them they have no 
place in the desert," said Alden Sievers, manager of the BLM's Barstow resource 
area. That area contains the starting line for the big Barstow-to-Las Vegas 
cross-country motorcycle race, which environmental extremists have tried to 
sabotage to protect wildlife habitat on the race course. 
</P>
<P>
"Congress, in fact, has said we shall find areas for that activity," said 
Gerald Hillier, manager of the BLM's desert district. "But I do think that 
instead of the desert being nibbled to death, as some tell you, we're nibbling 
toward bringing some law to the desert." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, the law must be harsh to accommodate past BLM mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
Desert tortoises, for example, are in dramatic decline for several reasons, 
including loss of habitat to off-road vehicles and other human activities that 
the BLM has been unable to control. Now, their dwindling Mojave community also 
is being decimated by ravenous ravens. 
</P>
<P>
BLM's answer is to shoot and poison the ravens. Environmentalists ask why the 
BLM did not years ago control the urban encroachment on the desert that gives 
the birds a food source -- garbage -- to fuel their population explosion. 
</P>
<P>
This alleged lack of foresight is particularly ironic to some BLM employees who 
say the agency has a tendency to abuse the planning process to avoid making 
tough management decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"Talk is cheap and the bureau is full of talk and plans," said one BLM 
biologist. "We plan to plan. When are we going to implement?" 
</P>
<P>
Some plans will be implemented soon, according to a congressional timetable for 
setting aside wilderness tracts from among BLM lands. But even here, there are 
questions about the bureau's sincerity. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a draft of the BLM's California Statewide Wilderness Study, which 
has been circulated within the bureau and other government agencies but not yet 
released publicly, has been challenged by some outside experts who have seen 
the report for grossly overestimating the amounts of minerals in the Mojave -- 
even after figuring in likely future price increases. 
</P>
<P>
A final version of the wilderness report is to guide Congress as it decides 
which proposed wilderness studies areas should be preserved and which could be 
"released" for other uses, such as mining, grazing and off-road racing. 
</P>
<P>
A geologist who studied the draft report but claims no feeling either way about 
the value of wilderness said the overestimates make the draft "more of a 
political document for anti-wilderness than anything else." This, he said, is 
because the draft seems to assume every mineral trace is valuable, even if it 
is so small or diffuse it is unlikely ever to be economic to mine. 
</P>
<P>
Hastey said the draft plan tries to anticipate the nation's mineral needs. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not know what the market for these minerals might be five, 10 or 20 
years down the road," he explained. "We do know we are dealing with a highly 
mineralized area, and what is not economic today may be valuable 15 years from 
now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Struggle for Balance 
</P>
<P>
Hillier said those kinds of decisions are all part of the bureau's struggle to 
balance inherently conflicting uses, as Congress has instructed. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people complain there is not enough for wildlife," he said, bucking 
uncomfortably across the desert in a BLM four-wheel-drive vehicle, "but 
Congress did not create the desert wildlife park. 
</P>
<P>
"Off-highway vehicle owners complain we do not allow them enough room. But 
Congress did not create an off-highway vehicle park, either. 
</P>
<P>
"What Congress did was create the California Desert Conservation Area, and 
'conservation,' in its old definition, means 'wise use,' not preservation."

OSHA PROPOSES STANDARD ON BIOLOGICAL HAZARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, Times Labor Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Labor Department on Tuesday proposed regulations designed to protect 5.3 
million workers from exposure to blood and other bodily fluids potentially 
infected with AIDS, hepatitis and other serious viruses. 
</P>
<P>
Occupational Safety and Health Administration spokesman Frank Kane said the 
proposed standard would be the agency's first formal regulation on biological 
hazards. 
</P>
<P>
Kane said 4.7 million health care workers would be covered by the standard, as 
well as an additional 600,000 persons working in law enforcement, fire and 
rescue crews, correctional facilities, research laboratories, blood banks and 
the funeral industry. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very big deal," said Jordan Barab, health and safety director of the 
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. "We have members 
all over the country working at hospitals and, despite all the publicity about 
precautions, people tell us over and over that gloves aren't available, needle 
boxes aren't available," he said, referring to two of the precautions 
recommended for protecting workers. 
</P>
<P>
Hearings on the proposal are scheduled for the fall and Barab said it could 
take a year for the proposal to be finalized. 
</P>
<P>
The rules would require employers to evaluate routine tasks and procedures in 
the workplace that involve exposure to blood or other potentially infectious 
materials, identify the workers performing these tasks and use several methods 
to reduce the risks. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the approaches to be used to reduce risk include a written infection 
control plan, changes in equipment, such as the use of puncture-resistant 
containers for the disposal of needles, and the use of protective clothing, 
such as gloves. 
</P>
<P>
OSHA officials estimated that the proposed standard would prevent 10,000 
infections and more than 200 deaths a year for both health care workers 
initially exposed to blood-borne diseases and other viruses, as well as those 
who may be subsequently exposed to viruses by other workers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's basically a sound proposal, but it's long overdue," said Margaret 
Seminario, the AFL-CIO's health and safety director. Unions first petitioned 
OSHA in September, 1986 to enact an emergency standard that would have codified 
guidelines established by the Centers for Disease Control governing worker 
exposure to blood-borne diseases. But OSHA declined to act. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1987, OSHA began to enforce the CDC guidelines through the use of 
its general duty clause, a catch-all provision of federal safety and health law 
that requires all employers to maintain a workplace free from recognized 
hazards. The new regulations would be considerably more specific and easier to 
enforce, Seminario said. 
</P>
<P>
Barab expressed concern that the proposed regulations do not set priorities for 
compliance methods, a deviation from OSHA's normal practice.

State officials from across the nation urged Congress Tuesday to pass tougher 
clean air laws with the aim of reducing pollution from car emissions and other 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
"We strongly support the motor vehicle emissions control program" embodied in 
pending bills, said James Lents, executive officer of the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District.

"Across the breadth of this country we see the signs of environmental distress, 
from forests damaged by acid rain in Vermont to brown clouds of smog in Los 
Angeles," Vermont Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin told the House health and environment 
subcommittee on behalf of the National Governors' Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Subcommittee Chairman Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) said strong action was 
needed now. "According to the Environmental Protection Agency, last summer's 
ozone levels were the worst of the decade. And the problem is getting worse," 
he said.

PROBERS BLAME ALOHA AIRLINE IN FATAL ACCIDENT; 
</P>
<P>
SAFETY BOARD CRITICIZES MAINTENANCE WORK, SEES LAXITY BY FAA, BOEING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board Tuesday primarily blamed Aloha 
Airlines' maintenance program for an accident last year in which the roof of a 
Boeing 737 ripped open over Hawaii, killing a stewardess and imperiling 94 
others on board. 
</P>
<P>
On a 4-1 vote, the safety officials found after a 13-month investigation that 
laxity at both the Federal Aviation Administration and the Boeing Co. also had 
contributed to the loss of an 18-foot section of the jetliner's fuselage. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the board laid the accident's "probable cause" to the failure of 
Aloha's maintenance workers to detect cracks around rivets in the 19-year-old 
fuselage. It said that the airline's management did not "supervise properly its 
maintenance force." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the board criticized the FAA for failing to "evaluate properly 
Aloha Airlines' maintenance program and to assess the airline's inspection and 
quality control deficiencies." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inaction on Lap Joints 
</P>
<P>
It further cited the FAA for failure to require inspection of fuselage lap 
joints, as had been proposed by Boeing in an "alert service bulletin." 
</P>
<P>
And the board suggested that the FAA and Boeing should have taken corrective 
action after the discovery of early production difficulties in the bonding of 
lap joints on 737 fuselages. 
</P>
<P>
The safety officials made 21 recommendations to the FAA, Aloha and the rest of 
the airline industry for improving maintenance and inspection programs. 
Although the safety board does not have the power to enforce its 
recommendations, the FAA and the airlines nearly always follow its advice. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said that sweeping action by the FAA last week, including 
ordering $142 million in modifications to older Boeing 727s, 737s and 747s, 
should go far toward preventing catastrophic failures on aging airliners of the 
sort that struck the Aloha craft. 
</P>
<P>
In a major change of philosophy, the agency said that the modifications would 
have to be made when planes reach a certain age or complete a certain number of 
flights -- not merely when inspections turn up problems, the former policy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stewardess Killed 
</P>
<P>
In the Aloha accident of April 28, 1988, a stewardess was killed when she was 
swept out through a gaping hole in the plane's fuselage. Of the other 94 
persons on board, 61 passengers and crew members were injured, but the pilot 
managed to land the airliner safely at Kahului airport on Maui. The plane had 
been flying at 24,000 feet en route from Hilo to Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
Safety board investigators examined the roles of metal fatigue, aircraft 
design, airline maintenance, crew performance and FAA directives affecting the 
aircraft, which had logged nearly 90,000 flights. 
</P>
<P>
During a daylong meeting, metallurgist James Wildey told the board that a 
3-by-4-foot piece of metal skin from the plane showed that it had been repaired 
but still contained cracks that were missed by airline mechanics before the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
"The piece that they repaired contained additional fatigue cracks that were 
underneath the repair patches, between the repair patches and on either side of 
the repair patches," Wildey said. 
</P>
<P>
Aloha's president and chief executive officer, A. Maurice Myers, said the 
airline "took exception" to that analysis, adding that there was "substantial 
evidence that those multiple cracks were not detectable." 
</P>
<P>
Myers noted that close inspections after the Aloha incident uncovered similar 
cracks in a number of other aging Boeing 737s and said: "This is an 
industry-wide problem that has already been addressed by the industry and the 
FAA." 
</P>
<P>
Safety board member Joseph Nall adopted the same position. He dissented from 
the board's assignment of blame, saying that he thinks that responsibility 
should be spread across the airline system for its failure to deal earlier with 
the problem of aging airliners. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Jim Burnett cited indications that the FAA had not followed 
recommendations from the plane's manufacturer in issuing maintenance directives 
to airlines. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that one Boeing service bulletin had directed airlines to replace 
rivets along the fuselage even before the Aloha 737 split open. But an FAA 
airworthiness directive was vague in its requirements, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The real issue is that (the FAA) didn't follow through on Boeing alert service 
bulletins," Burnett added. 
</P>
<P>
Chief safety board inspector Barry Trotter said that Aloha has improved its 
maintenance program since the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Myers contended that the airline was "in full compliance with FAA requirements 
and industry standards at the time" of the accident and has since made many 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
Aloha has scrapped three of its 737s, including the one that ripped open, and 
purchased several new planes, giving its fleet an average age of 10 years, 
compared with 15 at the time of the accident.

KEY ISRAELIS REJECT BAKER'S PLEA ON LAND 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pleading that they are not prepared to face the issue now, top Israeli 
officials on Tuesday dismissed a call by Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
that Israel give up the "unrealistic vision" of a greater Israel. 
</P>
<P>
In London, where he was on an official visit, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir 
said it is "useless, quite useless" for the Bush Administration to raise the 
issue of Israel's borders. He said that giving up the occupied West Bank and 
Gaza Strip in order to achieve peace is a "theoretical formula, and I don't 
think we have to discuss it now." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir criticized Baker for suggesting that Israel is seeking territorial 
grandeur through its control of the West Bank and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Small Country' 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how anyone could speak at all of a large Israel," Shamir said on 
Israeli radio. "Israel is a very small country, and all of us know that its 
territory is very limited. It really sounds ironic to speak of Israel as big." 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Moshe Arens criticized Baker for daring to define which 
aspirations are realistic for Israel and which are not. 
</P>
<P>
"These are our dreams," Arens said in an interview from Brussels. "We are 
speaking about our country, and we have proven that we fulfill our dreams." 
</P>
<P>
The question of Israeli territorial dreams was the dominant topic in public 
debate on comments Baker made Monday in a speech to a pro-Israeli lobby in 
Washington. The speech was widely viewed as the clearest expression to date of 
Washington's policy toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict -- and the fullest 
outline of issues separating the United States and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, politicians on the right challenged Baker's ability to limit 
Israel's dreams, while politicians on the left insisted that the country has 
yet to decide whether it will keep the land. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to dictate to us not only the political plans and political 
initiative, they want to dictate to us also our dreams -- what to dream about 
and what not to dream about," complained Geula Cohen, a member of the 
right-wing Tehiya party. 
</P>
<P>
Shimon Peres, leader of the centrist Labor Party, cautioned: "I disagree with 
the secretary that the . . . dream of a greater Israel is the policy of the 
present government." 
</P>
<P>
It appeared to some Israelis that Baker was trying to force an issue that 
Israeli leaders had striven to avoid: a decision on the final status of the 
West Bank and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Favors Holding Land 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's Likud Party, the dominant bloc in the ruling coalition, favors holding 
on to the land forever. Peres' Labor Party, the junior partner, is willing to 
surrender some of the territory in return for a peace settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"The American request cannot be answered," Alon Liel, a Foreign Ministry 
spokesman, said. "If we respond to it, the government will fall apart. If we do 
not, we will not find an Arab partner to talk peace." 
</P>
<P>
Liel said that Israel prefers a step-by-step approach that leaves for later 
consideration the contentious issue of who controls the land. 
</P>
<P>
Israel has offered a plan for elections in the West Bank and Gaza to select a 
Palestinian peace delegation. Members of the delegation would have to accept 
five years of self-rule under Israeli authority as a condition for taking part 
in final talks. The final talks would begin three years into the period of 
self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
Arens, upon ending a visit to Washington this week, said that Israel had won 
"unreserved American support" for the peace plan. But U.S. officials indicated 
that the plan falls short in important details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In 'Horrible' Mood 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry officials said that Arens' mood on learning of the Baker 
speech was "horrible." 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time this year that Arens has left Washington at odds with 
Baker. Just after Arens' first visit, in March, Baker told Congress that Israel 
might some day have to talk with the Palestine Liberation Organization in order 
to achieve peace. Israeli officials considered Baker's statement a slip of the 
tongue. Israel officially opposes contact with the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
Now, no one is mistaking Baker's tone. 
</P>
<P>
"This indicates Baker means business," a Foreign Ministry official said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the flap over the land-for-peace formula, Israeli leaders also attacked 
Baker's suggestions on ways to ease tension in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Baker called on Israel to stop building settlements in the occupied 
territories. About 70,000 Israelis live in 139 settlements there, and the 
government has agreed to build five more this year. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinians reacted cautiously to the Baker speech. Newspaper editor Ziad abu 
Ziad, a PLO supporter, said, "I believe Baker's statement is positive . . . but 
it is not the change that the Palestinian is asking for." 
</P>
<P>
Pro-PLO leader Sari Nusseibeh described Baker's speech as a positive sign but 
said its impact will depend on Israeli reaction. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinians in the occupied territories have rejected the Israeli election 
plan.

EGYPT BACK AT SUMMIT; SO IS ARAB SQUABBLING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The leaders of the Arab world convened a summit meeting here Tuesday to 
officially welcome Egypt's return to the Arab fold 10 years after it was 
shunned for signing a peace treaty with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
President Hosni Mubarak, the first Egyptian leader to attend an Arab summit 
since the late Anwar Sadat signed the 1979 treaty with Israel, was warmly 
embraced by Morocco's King Hassan II as he arrived at the gates of Casablanca's 
opulent royal palace for the start of the two-day meeting of the 22-member Arab 
League. 
</P>
<P>
But while Egypt's formal return to Arab councils was held as a historic event 
with major consequences for the balance of power in the Arab world, it was 
apparent that the summit itself was doomed to repeating the spectacle of 
squabbling and confrontation that has become almost a ritual at meetings of 
this sort. 
</P>
<P>
Egypt aside, the two main issues that the kings, presidents and emirs were 
summoned to this "emergency" meeting to discuss are the Palestinian question 
and the deepening conflict in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
And it was clear, from two days of preparatory meetings by Arab League foreign 
ministers, that deep differences had emerged over both issues. 
</P>
<P>
The summit was originally called by Morocco's King Hassan to align Arab support 
behind the Middle East peace initiative launched last November by Palestine 
Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
But at the preparatory talks for the summit, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk 
Shareh made it clear that Damascus strongly rejects Arafat's recognition of 
Israel's right to exist as well as his willingness to confine the creation of a 
future Palestinian state to the occupied territories of the West Bank and the 
Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi, persuaded to join the meeting only at the last 
moment, threatened to walk out if the summit endorses these or any of the other 
moves toward moderation made by Arafat over the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
Summit sources said that Egypt, plunging into the thick of things even before 
Mubarak's arrival, integrated the PLO and Syrian viewpoints into a compromise 
draft resolution on the Palestinian question that will be presented to the 
summit heads for approval. 
</P>
<P>
While the draft does not explicitly endorse all the concessions made by the 
PLO, Palestinian officials said it contains enough for Arafat to move ahead 
with a "peace offensive" aimed at winning Western support for the eventual 
creation of a Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
The working paper presented by the Palestinians at the preparatory meetings had 
sought a more specific endorsement of the PLO's decision last November to 
advocate a two-state solution to the Middle East crisis. 
</P>
<P>
But Egyptian and Palestinian sources said the compromise draft accepted by the 
foreign ministers gives only implicit approval to this formula in the form of 
references to U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338, which call for Israeli withdrawal 
from occupied Arab land and recognize the right of all countries in the region 
to exist within secure boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not so explicit on this point, but we are satisfied with it," PLO 
spokesman Ahmed Abdul-Rahman said. "It still constitutes a mandate for the PLO. 
It gives Arafat carte blanche to continue his political offensive." 
</P>
<P>
Syria, which had wanted the resolution to be tougher on Israel and to include 
the question of Israeli annexation of the Golan Heights, was expected to accept 
the compromise draft "with reservations," a summit source said. 
</P>
<P>
While it had no official place on the summit's agenda, the unusually blunt 
criticism of Israel by Secretary of State James A. Baker III in Washington on 
Monday created a flurry of interest in Casablanca as the Arab leaders gathered 
to discuss their positions on peace moves toward the Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, addressing the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, said it is time 
for Israel to "lay aside, once and for all, the unrealistic vision of greater 
Israel" and to negotiate an accord with the Palestinians that trades land for 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
Reacting favorably to the secretary's remarks, a PLO spokesman said that "we 
appreciate what Mr. Baker said to AIPAC to help them understand that the idea 
of greater Israel is only a dream." 
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman added that Baker's challenge to the Palestinians to take 
"concrete steps towards accommodation with Israel" was, in the PLO's view, odd 
in light of the steps that it maintains it has already taken in that regard. 
</P>
<P>
"What Baker did not say is that, after 40 years of struggle, we have given up 
our dream in favor of a political program that represents a historic change for 
us," the official said. "We have accepted the two-state solution, and we have 
recognized Israel and renounced terrorism. Baker should have acknowledged that 
too."

ALFONSIN TO FINISH TERM IN ARGENTINA, BATTLE INFLATION 
</P>

<P>
A newly forceful President Raul Alfonsin declared Tuesday that he will serve 
out his term rather than hand over power early to his Peronist successor, and 
he pledged "a war economy" to fight raging inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"What is certain is that we are resolved to govern without dismay until Dec. 
10, so no one should come and say that what might happen is reason for an 
earlier hand-over," the president said in a nationally broadcast address. 
</P>
<P>
Alfonsin said President-elect Carlos Saul Menem's negotiators backed down from 
an apparently firm agreement on an emergency economic package to reduce runaway 
inflation, which was to accompany the transition. 
</P>
<P>
Menem denied that the Peronists had broken a deal with Alfonsin's ruling party, 
the Radical Civic Union, and said he is still willing to talk but "without 
committing ourselves to short-term measures that work against the people." 
</P>
<P>
He said Alfonsin's speech was "more or less adequate under the circumstances" 
and added, "I prefer that the president depart without resigning and with all 
the honors that are due to a man who has fought for democracy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plans Bold Action 
</P>
<P>
Alfonsin, who has appeared discouraged and directionless in recent weeks, 
promised a bold new style "which is not to my taste" -- a tough, demanding 
campaign, using government-run media, to get the economy under control. 
</P>
<P>
The standoff left the country where it stood in the days after Menem's May 14 
trouncing of the Radicals' candidate, Eduardo Cesar Angeloz: facing an 
uncertain seven months under a lame-duck administration with the currency 
crashing and annual inflation of more than 8,000%. Meat prices soared by more 
than 80% this week alone. 
</P>
<P>
The Radicals had sought an accord with the labor-based Peronist party for 
higher taxes, exchange controls and other measures to restore order. Economy 
Minister Juan Carlos Pugliese had acknowledged that without the Peronists' 
support, any program imposed by the Radicals was doomed. 
</P>
<P>
Menem's advisers, anxious not to spend their political capital on a risky 
venture even before Menem takes office, insisted they would not co-sponsor any 
plan. Menem, governor of the small province of La Rioja, said he opposes higher 
taxes and fees and wants salary increases for workers whose buying power has 
been decimated by the unprecedented inflation and more aid for the bankrupt 
provinces. 
</P>
<P>
Alfonsin said he failed to understand how the Peronists could hope to increase 
both salaries and provincial funding while refusing to approve ways to raise 
the money to do so. 
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old president, who oversaw the transition from a seven-year 
dictatorship to democratic rule after taking office in 1983, noted that no 
other Argentine president has ever handed over power to an elected successor 
from another party. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a great dream, as you know, because I have referred to it many times: to 
complete the mandate of six years," he said. In accepting the notion of 
shortening the transition, Alfonsin said he took into account that "the mission 
was completed, we had already had the elections, there was already a 
president-elect and the consolidation of democracy was practically a reality." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Homage to Democracy' 
</P>
<P>
"Of course it was painful, but it was called for in homage to democracy 
itself," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Following the failure of that effort, "We are going to create not only a war 
economy but a crisis government. . . . We are going to carry forward a program 
with social awareness, but it will of course be tough, as everyone can 
imagine." 
</P>
<P>
He said the currency exchange market will be closed for the rest of the week to 
allow the Radicals' economic team to complete the emergency package, which is 
to be announced by Sunday. All Cabinet members resigned Tuesday night, and 
Alfonsin is expected to make some changes. 
</P>
<P>
Congressman Eduardo Bauza, Menem's chief negotiator, told reporters that 
Alfonsin sought "to shift to us the blame for the current situation without 
accepting any of the responsibility for it." 
</P>
<P>
He said that "in the face of this arrogance of the government, we cannot 
continue negotiating. . . . The economic measures that they take are the risk 
of the Alfonsin administration." 
</P>
<P>
A Radical legislator involved in the talks said privately that "every 15 
minutes they (the Peronists) changed negotiators and negotiating themes. They 
viewed our act of grandeur as weakness." 
</P>
<P>
He added that some Peronists wanted a broader accord, including an agreement to 
end trials of military officers for human rights violations, a constant 
disruptive factor during Alfonsin's administration.

KHOMEINI HAS DIGESTIVE TRACT SURGERY

<P>
Iran's 89-year-old leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, underwent surgery 
Tuesday to control bleeding in his digestive tract, Tehran Radio and Television 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The broadcasts, monitored in Nicosia, quoted a statement issued by the 
ayatollah's office that said the operation was successful and that the 
condition of the founder of Iran's Islamic state was "completely satisfactory." 
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Khomeini, the ayatollah's son, said the imam's condition was good. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctors are very pleased with the success of the operation. His condition 
is very good and there is no cause for concern. People must rest assured," the 
younger Khomeini told Iranian television. 
</P>
<P>
Iraj Fazel, one of Khomeini's surgeons, said on television that the ayatollah's 
heart and kidneys were functioning well and his blood pressure and pulse were 
normal after the operation. 
</P>
<P>
Pictures showing the ayatollah in white pajamas and black skull cap walking in 
a hospital corridor, apparently before the operation, were broadcast by Iranian 
television. 
</P>
<P>
Later he was shown sitting in bed and murmuring verses from the Koran, a tube 
connected to the back of his right hand and yellow prayer beads in his left 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
According to reports circulating in Europe, Khomeini is critically ill, but 
Iranian officials have regularly issued statements declaring him to be in good 
health. Some people who have been granted rare audiences with the ayatollah say 
that he moves with a slow, shuffling step. 
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press report from Paris said that the Ayatollah Mehdi Kouhani, 
leader of the Shiite Muslims in Europe, had called to say he was told that 
Khomeini had lost a large amount of blood and was in "precarious" condition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heart Attack in 1980 
</P>
<P>
Khomeini suffered a mild heart attack in 1980, a year after his followers 
forced the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi from Iran's throne. No other 
physical problems have been confirmed since then. In the past few years, 
however, the elderly leader has remained in his home in suburban Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts of Iranian affairs have reported that Khomeini, who holds supreme 
religious and state powers in Iran, was shaken and embittered by the collapse 
of Iranian forces in the eight-year war with Iraq, which ended in a truce last 
August. Recently, there has been a struggle for political leadership as the 
country's affairs appeared to drift. 
</P>
<P>
In February, Khomeini roused himself and sharpened the political debate with an 
accusation of blasphemy against novelist Salman Rushdie, the Muslim-born author 
of "The Satanic Verses," and demanded his execution. Subsequent political 
developments in Iran have shown that the elderly leader is still in charge and 
intends to keep Iran on a fundamentalist course so long as he lives. 
</P>
<P>
Several politicians who had advocated strengthening relations with the West in 
the period of postwar reconstruction have been forced to resign their official 
posts. 
</P>
<P>
Khomeini's surgery highlights the question of succession in the leadership of 
Iran's 10-year-old Islamic revolution. In March, he withdrew his blessing for 
his chosen successor, the Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, who had been 
critical of a wave of arrests and executions in Iran. Khomeini's politically 
powerful followers are wrangling for the reins of government, but none appears 
likely to succeed Khomeini in holding both spiritual and temporal power.

FOR YOUTH OF CHINA, IT'S A LITTLE LIKE WOODSTOCK

For the youth of China, the past month's events in Tian An Men Square are 
certain to assume a mythic status exceeding even that of the famed Woodstock 
music festival for Americans who came of age in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Music has been secondary to politics in what will be known as the great 1989 
democracy rallies of Tian An Men Square. But two songs have played important 
roles in protests that appear on the verge of toppling Premier Li Peng from 
office: China's national anthem and the revolutionary socialist hymn, "The 
Internationale." Both songs call for oppressed people to rise up in revolt, and 
the students sing them with gusto. 
</P>
<P>
Softer tunes have been heard as well. One day, to entertain the crowd a 
guitarist stood and played atop a bus parked at the square. At night, people 
huddled in small groups and sang. 
</P>
<P>
There has also been time for some romance during those long days and nights at 
the square. 
</P>
<P>
A few days ago, a couple decided that they wanted to get married, and they and 
their friends put together an impromptu wedding ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
In place of ribbons, red strips of cloth were knotted and pinned to the blouse 
of the bride and shirt of the groom, who stood in the midst of their friends 
for the brief event. 
</P>
<P>
Someone wrote up a wedding certificate -- lacking legal force but surely issued 
with love -- and it was presented to the happy couple as the students around 
them cheered. 
</P>
<P>
Motorbikes are relatively rare on China's streets, but they do exist. During 
weeks filled with high political drama and extraordinary street scenes, one of 
the most gripping sights has been the Flying Tiger Team, consisting of about 
500 young owners of motorbikes and light motorcycles and, in many cases, their 
girlfriends. 
</P>
<P>
Two helmeted riders per bike, with those in the lead carrying streaming 
banners, the Flying Tiger Team has raced through the streets of Beijing in 
search of excitement. 
</P>
<P>
"Block the army trucks!" screamed the riders as they roared toward the city's 
outskirts one recent night to help blockade the advancing People's Liberation 
Army. 
</P>
<P>
The Flying Tigers are themselves a symbol of the new, uneven prosperity that 
senior leader Deng Xiaoping -- himself a major target of the protests -- has 
brought to China with market-oriented reforms over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
Motorbikes, in addition to being in short supply, are too expensive for most 
Chinese. It is primarily the class of prosperous private entrepreneurs who can 
afford them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little strange that they've been some of our strongest supporters," 
said one student as he watched the Flying Tigers roar off into the darkness. 
"Students often complain about unfair distribution of money. The Flying Tiger 
Team, in some sense, represents all that." 
</P>
<P>
But he added that the students have welcomed the bikers' support. 
</P>
<P>
"We can all benefit from democracy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the fascinating, and in a sense tragic, aspects of the current 
demonstrations is how so many people have turned against a leader, the 
84-year-old Deng Xiaoping, who has done so much for them. 
</P>
<P>
Deng has freed China from the irrationality and severe political controls of 
the Maoist era and set it on the path of economic reform and growing 
prosperity. But today's protesting youth, and many of their elders, now view 
him as an aging emperor, unable to understand China's current needs and 
clinging to power past his time. 
</P>
<P>
"Xiaoping, the People of Sichuan Welcome You Home," declared a hand-scrawled 
cardboard poster held by a man standing along the parade route during a recent 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
With some pride, the protester displayed the opposite side of the sign. 
</P>
<P>
"Long Live the Respected Xiaoping. Long Live! Long Live!" it declared. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by several passers-by whether the two sides of his sign did not conflict, 
the man explained: "We want him to go back to Sichuan and pass good days, have 
an idle, very peaceful and quiet life, and live for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
A poster carried in another march captured the feelings of the vast majority of 
protesters: 
</P>
<P>
"Deng Xiaoping -- Thank You. Goodby."

WEST GERMAN PRESIDENT WINS 2ND TERM 
</P>

<P>
Richard von Weizsaecker, West Germany's widely admired senior statesman, was 
elected Tuesday to a second term as president of the nation that was founded 40 
years ago today. 
</P>
<P>
A special federal convention made up of members of the Bundestag, the lower 
house of the Parliament, and delegates from the 11 states voted, 881 to 108, to 
award the 69-year-old president another five-year term. 
</P>
<P>
He was the first of West Germany's six presidents to run unopposed and had been 
endorsed by four of the five political parties represented in the Bundestag. 
Only the far-left Greens party opposed him, but it declined to nominate a 
candidate as each of the parties in Parliament were entitled to do. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the negative votes were cast by right-wing political figures who have 
disagreed with some of Von Weizsaecker's recent decisions that they regarded as 
too liberal. 
</P>
<P>
Von Weizsaecker, a member of the Christian Democratic Union, the senior partner 
in the government coalition headed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, declared after 
the vote that he tries to be above party politics without being blandly 
neutral. 
</P>
<P>
"My office is open to everyone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A recent public opinion poll indicated that Von Weizsaecker has the support of 
94% of the West German voters. According to political analysts, he is widely 
perceived as West Germany's senior statesman. 
</P>
<P>
Rita Suessmuth, president of the Bundestag, said Tuesday at ceremonies in 
Bonn's Beethoven Hall: "The president represents our country to other people in 
the world. But most of all, he makes it possible for citizens to identify with 
our state. We citizens need more than symbols in the form of offices, anthems 
and flags. Such symbols only work with personalities that pretend to be 
democrats." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wounded in WWII 
</P>
<P>
Von Weizsaecker served in the army in World War II, was wounded three times and 
decorated. He won international acclaim in 1985 when, amid the controversy over 
then President Ronald Reagan's 1985 visit to the Bitburg military cemetery -- 
where members of Hitler's elite fighting force, the Waffen SS, are buried -- he 
urged Germans to accept responsibility for the Adolf Hitler era and the 
Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
His visit to the Soviet Union in 1987 was credited with helping repair the 
damage caused by Kohl's comparison of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
with Hitler's propaganda chief, Joseph Goebbels. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, he incurred the wrath of right-wingers by pardoning 
repentant German urban terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
Von Weizsaecker's father, Ernst, a professional diplomat, was Hitler's deputy 
foreign minister. The elder Von Weizsaecker was sentenced to five years in 
prison at the Nuremberg war crimes trial, but he was later pardoned by 
then-U.S. High Commissioner John J. McCloy. Richard von Weizsaecker had helped 
defend his father at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Von Weizsaecker was the Christian Democratic mayor of West Berlin from 1981 to 
1984. On assuming the presidency, he withdrew from active politics. 
</P>
<P>
Yet he has made the presidency, largely a ceremonial post with governmental 
power centered in the chancellorship, something more than it had been by 
traveling widely on official visits and speaking out on humanistic issues. 
</P>
<P>
He will give the keynote speech today at ceremonies marking the formation of 
West Germany on May 24, 1949, under the guidance of the victorious Western 
allies, the United States, Britain and France.

Secretary of State James A. Baker III held out little hope Tuesday that the 
United States and West Germany would resolve their dispute over short-range 
nuclear missiles before next week's North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit 
conference, saying that an issue so "extraordinarily important" could not be 
disposed of hastily. 
</P>
<P>
Baker's pessimistic assessment, which he said was echoed by President Bush in 
an interview Tuesday morning with European journalists, suggested that the 
attempts to prevent the meeting from being marred by political friction may 
fail. The session was intended to celebrate 40 years of allied unity. 
</P>
<P>
"While we would prefer to resolve it before we get to the summit, it's an 
extraordinarily important matter that deals with the security of the West and, 
therefore, it should not be resolved at all costs," Baker said in a briefing on 
the issues that Bush will face at the summit, which begins Monday in Brussels. 
"So, if we have to take it on at the summit, we will take it on at the summit." 
</P>
<P>
In the one bright note at the session, Baker announced that U.S.-Soviet talks 
on long-range nuclear weapons will resume on June 19. The talks, which will 
pursue an agreement on a 50% reduction in the superpowers' arsenals of 
intercontinental weapons, have been delayed for more than half a year while the 
new Administration reviewed national security issues. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the dispute over the short-range weapons is the pace and 
ultimate goal of any East-West negotiations over the deployment of short-range 
nuclear missiles. West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, under political pressure 
from voters favoring wider arms control efforts, has called for speedy talks 
aimed at reducing nuclear weapons with ranges of less than 300 miles. 
</P>
<P>
The United States fears that such talks would push the alliance toward removing 
all nuclear weapons from Europe -- a step that Bush opposes because of the East 
Bloc's overwhelming superiority in conventional weapons. The Bush 
Administration wants to put off any such talks until the imbalance of 
non-nuclear weaponry has been narrowed in talks that have been started in 
Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said that it would be a mistake to move into "early, immediate, 
unconditional negotiations" with the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact over the 
short-range missiles, which NATO had already decided to develop, as a 
replacement for the 88 launchers of its aging Lance missile force. He also said 
that the issue, while "very, very important," would not "totally dominate the 
summit." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Remain Hopeful' 
</P>
<P>
Although he said "we remain hopeful" that continuing efforts will resolve the 
dispute before the summit conference, he foreshadowed a hard line in any 
renewed bargaining with West Germany in the final days before the NATO leaders 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
White House officials supported that view. They said that no face-to-face talks 
between senior U.S. and West German officials are scheduled before the Brussels 
summit. The text of Bush's interview with the European journalists was not 
released to other news organizations. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest exchange of messages between Bonn and Washington, the Germans 
were "quibbling over several points," in response to the latest U.S. proposal, 
an Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
In that proposal, which prompted Baker on Saturday to state that the two sides 
were "very close" to resolving their differences, the United States suggested 
that the NATO nations commit themselves to negotiations with the Soviets on the 
short-range missiles but that the commitment be made conditional on 
"significant progress" in the negotiations on conventional weaponry. Thus, 
there would be no opening of short-range nuclear weapons talks until the United 
States felt assured that the conventional imbalance -- which the nuclear 
missiles and artillery shells are needed to offset -- would be narrowed. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that in a 
response received Monday evening from West Germany, Bonn refused to rule out 
the eventual elimination of all nuclear weapons from Europe. In addition, the 
Germans objected to making a commitment to the eventual modernization of the 
Atlantic Alliance's short-range missile force, and were not willing to put off 
negotiations on these weapons "until we see a full treaty" on conventional 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"These are three critical areas," the official said. "They want wiggle room." 
</P>
<P>
Bush leaves Washington on Friday for the summit of the leaders of the 16 NATO 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said that Bush will emphasize the need for "a strong common defense," 
strengthening of European institutions and the "peaceful decentralization of 
economic, political and social authority in Eastern Europe." He said that Bush 
also will seek to turn NATO's attention to a wider range of issues, including 
environmental problems and the proliferation of chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking to answer critics who have said that Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev has successfully courted support in Western Europe with a skillful 
public relations campaign that threatens the unity of the alliance, Baker said: 
"We're winning economically, we're winning politically, we have the other 
philosophy (communism) acknowledging that it is a failure."

PLAN TO INCREASE CITY'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING INCLUDES DEVELOPER FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL STEWART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday approved in concept a sweeping set of 
plans to create badly needed affordable housing, including a fee to be paid by 
commercial developers into a housing fund. 
</P>
<P>
The watershed package of programs -- ideas borrowed from several cities that 
are well ahead of Los Angeles in responding to skyrocketing housing costs -- 
was approved 13 to 0 after some of its aspects were strengthened by the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Show of Support 
</P>
<P>
The complex set of proposals received a surprising show of support, not only 
from council members but also from a wide range of advocates for the poor, 
housing experts, corporate leaders and commercial development representatives 
who spoke. It was applauded by Mayor Tom Bradley, who released a statement 
saying that he will "eagerly sign these proposals into law." 
</P>
<P>
City officials have estimated that one-third of the city's renters -- 300,000 
families -- pay more than 30% of their earnings for rent, an amount considered 
unaffordable by the federal government. Another 40,000 families live in garages 
and 30,000 to 35,000 people are believed to be homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Each proposal will be drawn up as an ordinance and returned to the council for 
final votes. How much the programs will cost the city, and how many new units 
of housing they will generate, are yet to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
Among the key provisions are: 
</P>
<P>
* A "linkage" fee of between $2.50 and $7.50 per square foot on large 
commercial construction, which will go into a special housing fund. In San 
Francisco, Boston, Seattle and elsewhere such a fee is already raising tens of 
millions of dollars, and has helped create thousands of permanent low-cost 
apartments renting for less than $450 a month. 
</P>
<P>
* Funding for programs that will bring new clout to the city's nonprofit 
housing developers, who are widely viewed as crucial to the creation of 
permanent low-rent housing. Nonprofit developers will be awarded special 
financing and technical assistance not now available. 
</P>
<P>
* Creation of a Housing Partnership, an approach that has worked in other 
cities. Such partnerships encourage corporations and nonprofit housing groups 
to raise and share funds for affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
* Establishment of a Housing Commission to oversee the tangled and sometimes 
duplicative efforts of 11 city departments that have a say in low-cost housing 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
* Strengthening of a long-existing city ordinance that requires new residential 
buildings to include 15% affordable housing, contingent upon the developers 
receiving subsidies. The ordinance has created little low-rent housing because 
of lack of government funds. 
</P>
<P>
* An increase in the document transfer tax charged on real estate transactions 
and other document transactions, a provision that would require changes in 
state law. The money would be paid into an affordable housing fund. 
</P>
<P>
* Allowing expenditures of up to $10 million from the city's reserve fund to 
shore up aging brick buildings that must comply with city earthquake 
strengthening laws or be torn down. Currently such buildings contain more than 
40,000 low-rent apartments, and city officials believe that losing that housing 
would be devastating. 
</P>
<P>
* Placement of a $100-million bond issue on the June, 1990, ballot to provide 
low-cost loans and other assistance to owners of aging brick buildings who must 
comply with city earthquake standards. 
</P>
<P>
* Creation of a special city unit to negotiate with owners of 22,000 affordable 
rental units, whose rents could skyrocket to market level in a few years as 
federal restrictions on their rental limits expire. Most apartments would also 
be placed under city rent control. 
</P>
<P>
* Development of a plan to control the demolition of affordable housing, a 
problem that is reaching huge proportions as the city's development boom 
continues. City officials estimate that more than 4,000 units of affordable 
housing, much of it in sturdy condition, falls to the wrecking ball each year. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Squier, the acting city Housing Authority director, told the council that 
in the year it has taken the proposals to reach the council, "6,000 additional 
new families moved to Los Angeles who now have inadequate housing" and 5,000 
affordable units were torn down to make way for developments and luxury 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Has Major Backers 
</P>
<P>
Among those backing the proposals were Arco President Robert Wykoff; developer 
representative George Mihlsten; Ann Reiss Lane, president of the Shelter 
Partnership, a homeless organization, and Sister Diane Donohue, of the 
South-Central Organizing Committee. All four were on a blue-ribbon committee 
that spent nearly a year drafting the plans. Developers on the panel had 
opposed aspects of the linkage fee, but supported it Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the council debate Tuesday centered on the linkage fee. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Gloria Molina questioned a proposal to set the fee at $2.50 per 
square feet, saying it was too low. The debate was quelled when Councilman 
Marvin Braude suggested an initial fee ranging from $2.50 to $7.50, which was 
adopted. 
</P>
<P>
"I want something that is not a lip service figure but a realistic figure," 
Molina said. "I am worried about locking ourselves into such a low fee." 
</P>
<P>
Donohue told the council, for example, that 10 million to 12 million square 
feet of commercial development is created downtown each year, and if each 
developer were paying $2.50 per square foot, "that would create $25 million a 
year for housing. Even though that isn't enough, it's a start." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Need Special Study 
</P>
<P>
Under federal law, the city must complete a special study before making 
developers pay such linkage fees. The study report, due this fall, will show 
how much housing demand is created each time a developer erects a commercial 
building that attracts workers, who then must find housing. 
</P>
<P>
Permanent fees will be based on the study. Studies in other West Coast cities 
have set the fees at $5 to $8 per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
To provide affordable housing for all who need it, especially given the huge 
influx of immigrants and low-paid workers entering the city each day, city 
officials have estimated that Los Angeles will need several billion dollars.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DIAMOND BAR PICKS FIRST CITY MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Diamond Bar City Council, searching for a city manager who is well-versed 
in traffic issues and the challenges of running a newly incorporated city, has 
chosen the city manager of Big Bear Lake. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Van Nordt, 46, was hired last week by a unanimous vote of the council as 
Diamond Bar's first city manager. Van Nordt became Big Bear Lake's city manager 
shortly after it incorporated in 1981 and has worked to solve the growing 
traffic problems there. 
</P>
<P>
"I love to solve problems," Van Nordt said from his office in Big Bear Lake. 
"I've been dealing with new-city issues for the past eight years." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Pro Tem Paul Horcher said Van Nordt's rapport with San Bernardino County 
officials may come in handy as Diamond Bar seeks to end a dispute over a 
barrier that County Supervisor Pete Schabarum ordered placed across Grand 
Avenue at the county line in order to block San Bernardino County's planned 
expansion of the road.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLASTIC FOAM MAKERS SEEK TO AVERT BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives from plastic foam manufacturers have urged Duarte officials to 
consider recycling rather than banning cellular polystyrene. 
</P>
<P>
City council members have been considering banning the use of plastic foam 
containers and other products in restaurants because it is not biodegradable 
and poses a litter problem. Some cellular polystyrene is made with chemicals 
that damage the protective ozone layer of the atmosphere, contributing to the 
so-called "greenhouse effect." 
</P>
<P>
John Marshall, a product manager of Dow Chemical Co., told city officials 
during a three-hour hearing that manufacturers are moving away from making 
products made with ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs. By the end of 
the year all foam food packaging, including egg cartons and meat trays, should 
be free of CFCs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley John, president of Rastra Building Systems Inc. in Riverside, described 
a recycling plant he plans to open in July that would process 6,000 cubic feet 
of plastic foam daily.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POMONA OKS INTERIM CITY ADMINISTRATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seeking to waste no time putting city government on a different course, the 
Pomona City Council's new majority has selected an interim city administrator 
after one 20-minute interview. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Lazzaretto Jr., former city administrator of Burbank, was appointed by 
the council in a 3-1 vote in closed session last week. The vote split along the 
same lines as the council's May 1 decision to fire City Administrator A. J. 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Council members C. L. (Clay) Bryant, Nell Soto and Tomas Ursua formed the 
majority, while Mayor Donna Smith was the lone dissenter. Councilman Mark 
Nymeyer was absent from both votes. 
</P>
<P>
The council arranged to have Lazzaretto interview for the job after Soto 
suggested him during a discussion at the council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement tentatively worked out with the council, Lazzaretto will 
receive $7,000 a month to work at least four hours a day, five days a week, 
plus council meetings.

AQMD TO SEEK CHARGES AGAINST L.A. OVER LOPEZ LANDFILL FUMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Air quality officials said Tuesday that they will ask the district attorney's 
office to file criminal charges against the Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation 
over an incident in which workers who were grading a road at Lopez Canyon 
Landfill were overcome by noxious fumes. 
</P>
<P>
The city-operated landfill at the northeast edge of the San Fernando Valley 
previously had been cited by the South Coast Air Quality Management District 
for grading a road without the required air district permit. 
</P>
<P>
On March 8, two workers fainted and required medical care after grading 
equipment uncovered garbage that was buried in 1982. Although the odors that 
sickened the workers have never been identified, the AQMD believes that they 
were caused by hydrogen sulfide, a gas that occurs when manure and garbage 
break down. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Referral in 2 Weeks 
</P>
<P>
Air district spokesman Bill Kelly said his department's investigation would be 
referred to the district attorney within the next two weeks. "Once we send it 
to them, it's their case, so I can't really say exactly what the charges will 
be." 
</P>
<P>
The district's case focuses on why city workers were grading a road through a 
mountain of trash without a permit, Kelly said. Air district officials have 
said in the past that they believe that monitoring requirements involved in 
obtaining such a permit might have prevented the accident. 
</P>
<P>
The city Bureau of Sanitation refused to comment on the air district's decision 
to seek criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no knowledge of it," said spokeswoman Gil Elliot. "We haven't heard or 
seen anything yet." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who represents the residential areas nearest the 
landfill, praised the air district for taking a stern stance. 
</P>
<P>
"Their job is to protect the community, protect the people surrounding these 
hazardous landfills, and I'm glad that they're doing their job," Bernardi said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Bill Carter, a member of the Los Angeles Toxic Waste Strike 
Force, said he knew few details of the case except that it was being referred 
to his office. Carter said he probably would not limit his investigation to the 
grading practices but would look at any worker safety violations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Use the Results' 
</P>
<P>
"We'll use the results of the air district's investigation, but if we get any 
leads from those, we may follow them on our own," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez Canyon is scheduled for closure in 1992, but the Bureau of Sanitation 
hopes to keep it open until 2005 and to double its daily capacity of 6,000 tons 
of garbage. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion plans require City Council approval and are opposed by Bernardi 
and Lyle Hall, his opponent in the June 6 council runoff election. Bernardi 
said Tuesday that it was "too early to tell" whether the investigation by the 
district attorney's office would help him gain council support to prevent the 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi has asked the city's legislative analyst to look into the March 8 
accident and general practices at the landfill. He said that report is expected 
within the next month.

SANTA CLARITA OKS BRIDGE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Clarita City Council, confronting the toughest political issue in the 
young city's history, voted unanimously late Tuesday night to build a 
controversial bridge which had been vigorously supported and bitterly opposed 
by two warring neighborhoods for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The bridge would span railroad tracks, San Fernando Road and the Santa Clara 
River to link Wiley Canyon Road in Valencia with Via Princessa in the Circle J 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Circle J residents said the bridge would provide their secluded community a 
badly needed second access, for safety purposes. Currently the only route into 
the community is Circle J Ranch Road, which can be blocked by rail traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Keith McNally, who headed the pro-bridge effort, argued that the council had to 
support the bridge for the good of the entire city, and to prove that selfish 
interests could not control city policy. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia residents complained that the bridge would dump unwanted traffic into 
their peaceful community. "It makes little sense to siphon traffic through a 
residential neighborhood," said Tamsie Irvan. 
</P>
<P>
More than 250 people filled the council chambers Tuesday night. An overflow 
audience listened to the proceedings over speakers set up outside the building. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first really big issue that the city has had to face," Mayor Jan 
Heidt said.

CAGE TESTS EXTENDED; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTY CONTINUES BAN ON COYOTE JAW TRAPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A ban on the use of steel-jawed leg traps to catch coyotes that wander too 
close to homes in Topanga Canyon and other rural communities was continued 
Tuesday by Los Angeles County officials. 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor Mike Antonovich said a six-month experiment by county 
trappers using box traps to catch coyotes without injuring them has been 
inconclusive and must be widened. 
</P>
<P>
Between now and Nov. 30, trappers employed by the county's agricultural 
commissioner will receive special training on how to bait the walk-in cage 
traps and also will be asked to test leg snares that are being used to catch 
coyotes in Canada, Antonovich said. 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural Commissioner E. Leon Spaugy ordered the initial half-year cage 
trap experiment in October after a coyote caught in a jaw trap in Topanga 
Canyon chewed its leg off to escape. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, however, county trappers have failed to catch a single coyote in 
the four walk-in traps they put out in hilly areas the animals roam in search 
of food. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the cages -- which capture coyotes when they step inside to get at food 
bait -- have been damaged by either animals or vandals, officials said. During 
the past six months, trappers would normally have caught up to 60 coyotes in 
leg traps, said Richard Wightman, head of the county's trapping program. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich said the results of the first six-month trial were inconclusive 
"because the traps were not being baited properly and because there wasn't a 
sufficient number of them." He said funding will be made available to purchase 
more cage traps, which cost about $125 each. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles animal control officers will be asked to show the county trappers 
how to use the cage traps, Antonovich said. At the same time, inexpensive leg 
snares that humanely capture coyotes will also be tested, he said. 
</P>
<P>
County trappers will be authorized to use the old-style jaw traps in 
emergencies to catch coyotes that are menacing neighborhoods, Antonovich said. 
The agricultural commissioner's office has about 150 of the leg traps, which 
cost about $5 each. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly public safety is the top priority and the agricultural commissioner 
is free to take whatever steps are necessary when lives are threatened," 
Antonovich said. 
</P>
<P>
The extension of the jaw-trap ban was sought by Lila Brooks, director of a 
Hollywood-based group called California Wildlife Defenders. Her organization 
has pressed for the elimination of such traps for years. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks said cage traps have proven effective when used by trappers who know how 
to properly bait them. She said leg traps have been outlawed in several other 
California counties. 
</P>
<P>
"L.A. County trappers have never used box traps before and do not have the 
skill and experience to catch the target animals," she said.

2 KILLED IN SEPARATE ACCIDENTS ON TOPANGA CANYON BOULEVARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two people died and two were injured Tuesday in separate traffic accidents on a 
half-mile stretch of Topanga Canyon Boulevard in Chatsworth, the Los Angeles 
Police Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Rhind, 32, of Chatsworth died after the Chevrolet Camaro he was driving 
became pinned under a large truck about 11:15 a.m., Officer Jim Thompson said. 
Eight vehicles, including the truck, were damaged in the unusual chain-reaction 
crash, caused by a truck rolling backwards out of control. 
</P>
<P>
The truck, loaded with ice cream mix, was headed north when its drive shaft 
snapped on a grade just south of the Simi Valley Freeway, severing the brake 
lines. The driver, Dennis Acker, 36, of Culver City, was unable to halt the 
truck as it began heading down the hill tail first, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
Acker swerved into the southbound lanes to avoid cars behind him. But he lost 
control and the truck crossed back into the northbound lanes, hitting an 
oncoming car driven by Amanda Piorek, 16, of Northridge, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
Piorek and a passenger in her car, David Friedman, 16, of Chatsworth, were 
treated at Humana Hospital-West Hills for their injuries and released, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The truck continued backwards and clipped a second car before it collided with 
the Camaro driven by Rhind, Thompson said. With the Camaro wedged beneath it, 
the truck spun and hit a parked car, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The truck came to a halt after it hit a second parked car, setting off a series 
of collisions that left two other parked cars damaged, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
In the other accident, a man driving north on Topanga Canyon Boulevard near 
Andora Avenue was killed when his car crossed into the southbound lanes and 
collided head-on with a flatbed truck about 4 p.m. The driver was thrown onto 
the street and run over by his car, Officer Morris Verdini said. The truck's 
driver was not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities withheld the victim's name until his relatives could be notified.

JAPANESE INVESTOR, FOUR SEASONS PLAN MAJOR RESORT IN CARLSBAD

In a deal that demonstrates increasing Japanese interest in San Diego real 
estate, an investor group including a Japanese real estate tycoon and the Four 
Seasons Hotel chain has signed an agreement to build a luxury resort in 
Carlsbad costing more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
The 450-room resort, to be called Four Seasons Aviara, is scheduled to open in 
1992 on the north shore of Batiquitos Lagoon and will be operated by the Four 
Seasons chain, a Toronto-based owner-operator of 22 luxury properties in the 
United States, Canada and Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
TSA International of Honolulu, controlled by Takeshi Sekiguchi of Japan, is 
investing in a number of large hotel projects in the United States, including 
three in partnership with Hawaiian developer Chris Hemmeter. Last year, they 
completed the 1,400-room Hyatt Waikoloa, a $375-million project. TSA and 
Hemmeter are also partners in the Westin Maui and Westin Kauai. 
</P>
<P>
Also investing in the new resort is Hillman Properties, the Newport Beach-based 
real estate investment arm of Pittsburgh billionaire Henry Hillman that 
controls more than $2 billion in real-estate assets. The land on which the 
resort is to be built is part of a 1,000-acre parcel Hillman acquired from the 
Hunt Properties of Dallas for more than $70 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
Although Japanese investors so far have concentrated their Southern California 
activities in the Los Angeles area, they have shown more interest in San Diego 
in the past year or so. Sports Shinko of Osaka bought the La Costa Resort Hotel 
for $250 million in 1987, and several downtown San Diego office buildings are 
now owned totally or in part by Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
The Aviara resort is part of a master-planned project to include an Arnold 
Palmer-designed 18-hole golf course as well as convention and meeting areas and 
2,836 housing units, a Hillman spokesman said. The project is part of a surge 
in resort development in Southern California. More than 5,000 resort rooms are 
planned for the Orange County coast alone over the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
Aviara is TSA's second San Diego project. TSA joined forces last tear with the 
Naiman Co., Shimizu Corp. and Nissho Iwai Trading Co. to develop the 
$150-million Aventine mixed-use project in La Jolla. Now under construction, 
the project includes a 400-room Hyatt Regency Hotel opening Dec 15, a 
225,000-square-foot office building and three restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Construction on the resort is scheduled to start in spring, 1990, according to 
Robert Fox, vice president and general manager of TSA Development Co. Ltd. 
(California) based in La Jolla. "TSA has a very positive feeling about 
California, specifically San Diego," Fox said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
TSA and Four Seasons have teamed up to build the Four Seasons Resort-Wailea, a 
374-room luxury resort on Maui to open later this year in Hawaii and a new 
hotel in Paris, a 200-room property to be completed in 1992, said Four Seasons 
executive vice president Roger Garland. 
</P>
<P>
"We think (Four Seasons Aviara) will provide us with a resort position in the 
San Diego-Los Angeles corridor which will really set a new standard for that 
part of the world," Garland said. 
</P>
<P>
Among Four Seasons' 22 hotels are four in California: the 330-room Four 
Seasons-Clift in San Francisco, the 236-room Four Seasons Santa Barbara, the 
285-room Four Seasons Los Angeles and the 284-room Four Seasons Newport Beach.

Cipher Data Products said Tuesday that it will be only "marginally profitable" 
on lower-than-anticipated revenues for the fourth quarter to end June 30. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Cipher Data Chairman Gary Liebl said his company's 
revenue for the current quarter will come in at "closer to $60 million" than 
the $70 million that some analysts had pegged for the manufacturer of computer 
tape drives. 
</P>
<P>
Profit for the three months apparently will be less than the $5.1 million 
Cipher reported for last year's fourth quarter, when sales totaled $55.9 
million. The quarter's results will include revenue from the Irwin tape drive 
line acquired last month. 
</P>
<P>
Liebl blamed a slowdown in demand "in recent weeks" for its half-inch, 
reel-to-reel tape drives as well as for 5.25-inch tape drives, both of which 
are used as backup data storage devices in computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
Cipher Data Products released the statement after the stock market had closed 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In over-the-counter trading, Cipher stock closed down $.125 at $9.375 a share.

INSTALLATION GALLERY, SPONSOR OF ARTWALK, SUSPENDS SHOWINGS

Faced with mounting debts, a downtown alternative gallery for the avant-garde 
has laid off its two-member staff, accepted its director's resignation and 
suspended its exhibition schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Saying that the nonprofit Installation Gallery at 930 E Street is at a "crucial 
juncture" and may be hindered by "my sometimes outspoken personality," former 
director Dan Wasil tendered his resignation about 10 days ago, he said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I laid off the staff on May 1," Wasil said. "I let it be known during Artwalk 
(April 22-23) that, unless we found ways of coming up with the money, there was 
no way I could continue." 
</P>
<P>
Wasil also canceled a May-June group exhibit of artists from San Diego and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The gallery is $12,000 in debt, said Beverly Schroeder, a member of 
Installation's board of directors. Most of the debt is unpaid rent and staff 
salaries, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not throwing in the towel," Schroeder said. "It just got to the point 
where he (Wasil) couldn't keep working without getting paid. The board is 
meeting, like, three times a week. We have a group on the board that is 
functioning as an operating entity." The group is looking at several 
fund-raising possibilities, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Founded nine years ago by artist Gary Ghirardi and his wife, Carol Roskos, 
Installation has served as a forum for artists "to do some new thinking," 
Schroeder said. In recent years the gallery has expanded from three-dimensional 
room installations of artworks to include original videos and performances. 
</P>
<P>
Installation is best known as the sponsor of the annual downtown Artwalk each 
spring, in which the public is invited to visit artists' studios and galleries. 
This year's Artwalk drew 35,000 people, according to police estimates. However, 
the event wound up costing Installation $3,500. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder denied recent allegations made by several artists that Installation 
had used a grant from the city earmarked for Artwalk for its ongoing operations 
and to pay its debts. 
</P>
<P>
"No," Schroeder said. "We have a separate bank account. Everything is separate 
for Artwalk." 
</P>
<P>
Although Artwalk is a popular event, some Installation events, such as two 
recent exhibits critical of Father Junipero Serra and of businesses, have 
generated controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to get corporate funding when you're showing things like that," 
Schroeder said. "But I think that these kinds of shows need to be shown. 
Usually there is some truth in them. 
</P>
<P>
"We showcase experimental kinds of works. They're not commercial kinds of 
works. It gives young artists a chance to show experimental things." 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said Installation's board of directors is still planning to 
co-sponsor a local exhibit of the "Rosenberg Era Art Project," possibly in the 
fall, with the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a real strong show that needs to come to San Diego and needs to be 
seen," Schroeder said.

PROMOTER FINDS PROMISING ROCK ACTS ON SOVIET SOJOURN 
</P>

<P>
Back in March, Soviet pop singer Laima Vaikule arrived in San Diego for a month 
of rehearsals in an oceanfront mansion in Leucadia. A few weeks ago, San Diego 
concert promoter Scott Pedersen arrived in the Soviet Union for a 12-day talent 
hunt in Moscow and Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
Pedersen returned to town May 5 with a suitcase full of demonstration tapes and 
videos of Soviet rock acts he's thinking about booking here, perhaps during 
this fall's San Diego Soviet Arts Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Of the more than 40 bands and performers who showcased for Pedersen, courtesy 
of the government-run Gosk concert bureau, the one who impressed him the most 
was Vladimir Kuzman, a popular Soviet singer, songwriter and bandleader. 
</P>
<P>
"He was absolutely fantastic," Pedersen recalled. "His music is sort of a cross 
between Sting, Kenny G and progressive Journey, with a lot of good hard-rock 
guitar." 
</P>
<P>
Pedersen caught Kuzman and his six-piece band at the Youth Palace in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about the size of our Civic Theatre," he said, "and the place was packed. 
The whole thing was like a normal rock show at the Civic. There were a couple 
of black backup singers, the horn and saxophone players were hoisted up in the 
air, they had smoke, they had explosions, they had lasers. 
</P>
<P>
"There were even a bunch of groupies hanging around outside the back door, 
waiting for him after the show. They were all dressed up as much as fashion 
would allow -- no Spandex, no miniskirts, nothing risque, but they definitely 
stood out from the other people at the show." 
</P>
<P>
Among the other acts Pedersen enjoyed were Mister Twister, a rockabilly group 
from Moscow, and Avtograf, a Soviet heavy-metal band that toured the United 
States last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The overall level of talent is unbelievable," Pedersen said. "And with 
American interest in the Soviet Union and in Soviet culture at an all-time high 
thanks to glasnost, I think the appeal many of these bands have to Soviet 
audiences would transfer over to American audiences." 
</P>
<P>
He said the low point of his tour was attending a rock festival in a 
14,000-seat arena in which all eight bands were lip-syncing to their records. 
</P>
<P>
"But the crowd either didn't notice or didn't care. It was rock 'n' roll and 
they loved it." 
</P>
<P>
Pedersen's Soviet sojourn was arranged by Don Hughes of La Jolla, whose 
International Attractions regularly imports Soviet dance troupes, choirs and 
puppet theaters to the United States for national tours. 
</P>
<P>
"Don is highly respected in the Soviet Union, and we were taken care of like I 
couldn't believe. Everywhere we went there were interpreters, buses and 
front-row seats," Pedersen said. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, the Soviet Union is not a place to go on a vacation. The bare 
necessities are just not there. Getting a drink of water, a cup of tea, takes 
hours, and the whole time I was there I only had three Pepsis because they're 
practically impossible to find." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest local rock event of the year promises to be the Aug. 22 performance 
by legendary British super group The Who at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the show, the first concert at the stadium since 1983 at which 
people will be allowed on the field, went on sale last Saturday at 8 a.m. More 
than 1,500 eager fans were already waiting behind a chain-link fence in the 
stadium parking lot, wearing numbered wristbands they had picked up the day 
before. Box office workers called out numbers in groups of 100 to limit the 
length of the ticket line. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, thousands of other Who fans were snapping up tickets -- priced at 
$22.50 apiece -- at 11 Ticketmaster outlets throughout San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the day, the total ticket sale tally stood at 30,000. And Kevin 
Stapleford, creative services director with progressive-rock radio station 
XTRA-FM (91X), which is co- producing the concert with Colorado promoter Barry 
Fey, is confident the remaining 24,000 seats will soon be sold as well. 
</P>
<P>
"We're sure it's going to sell out," Stapleford said of The Who's first San 
Diego appearance in six years. "It's a real special concert. They're on their 
25th anniversary reunion tour, and, since there's no opening act, it will be a 
three-hour concert celebrating a quarter-century of what they've done." 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: An ad in last Thursday's Reader for a concert the next night at 
Club Mirage in Mission Valley really built up the star of the show. Quotes from 
six national music magazines tell us he's "a phenomenal guitarist who can do 
things most only dream of," "the greatest thing on guitar since frets," "the 
next big thing in the gallery of guitar gods," and so on. Conspicuous by its 
absence: the star's name. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Country legend Buck Owens' June 17 concert at the Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa 
appears headed for a sellout. Tickets are now on sale for a newly added second 
show, June 18. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Rod Stewart has just been booked for a July 28 appearance at the San Diego 
Sports Arena. Tickets go on sale June 17.

GETTING TO SEA THE OLD WAY -- BY FOOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
He would appear in the late afternoon, walking south through the hills toward 
Mulholland Drive -- a man in his early 60s in street shoes, his head covered by 
a terry cloth cap. 
</P>
<P>
He carried no water, and Jill Swift of Tarzana, coming down the mountain from 
her afternoon hikes, was curious and concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"Where are you bound for?" Swift finally asked one day. Just walking home, he 
replied, to the other side of the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
His name was Chris Clegg, an Englishman who had competed as a race walker on 
three continents. For exercise and diversion, Clegg would hike from the San 
Fernando Valley through the Santa Monica Mountains to Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
Swift, a Sierra Club member, was impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, he epitomized some of the things that we're lacking in the Los Angeles 
area in terms of . . . using public transportation and being able to get to 
some of these natural areas for a very unique outdoor experience," she said. 
</P>
<P>
And Swift also thought: "If he can do it, we can do it too." 
</P>
<P>
Swift's meeting with Clegg more than eight years ago inspired the 
"Valley-to-the-Sea" hike, now something of an institution among local hiking 
enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
One Sunday a month, hikers meet at the end of Reseda Boulevard for the trek to 
Pacific Coast Highway, a distance of 10 to 15 miles depending on the trails 
used. And although a few hikers leave cars on the other side, most return to 
the Valley by RTD bus -- as rare an adventure for some as the hike itself. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a destination hike," said Swift, 60, who usually serves as leader. 
"People love to be able to say, 'I've walked from the San Fernando Valley to 
the ocean.' " 
</P>
<P>
About 25 hikers usually show up, with others choosing from a smorgasbord of 
hikes the Sierra Club leads in area mountains on Sundays. But to avoid 
competing with volunteer trail building on a recent Sunday at Point Mugu State 
Park, the selection of hikes was limited, creating a heavy turnout for 
"Valley-to-the-Sea." 
</P>
<P>
A mob of 48 hikers showed up at the trail head at the end of Reseda Boulevard 
in day packs, lug soles and T-shirts. They were from Northridge and Chatsworth, 
but also from Long Beach, Fullerton and Costa Mesa. They were professors, 
aeronautical engineers and homemakers, a bank teller, a film projectionist and 
others. And although a majority were in their 40s and 50s, others were in their 
60s or 70s. 
</P>
<P>
Most did not look their age, which one man attributed to hiking. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm actually 150 years old," he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
"And I'm his father," another said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dirt Road and Sycamores 
</P>
<P>
The group moved out just after 8 a.m., heading south along Fire Road 28. The 
dirt road climbed gently along the floor of Caballero Canyon, past sycamores 
lining the sandy bed of Caballero Creek. 
</P>
<P>
The road soon crossed into Topanga State Park, bent sharply southeast and 
climbed steeply to Mulholland Drive. In front of the hikers, Rustic Canyon, 
loaded with dense, green growth, opened to the south. 
</P>
<P>
Crossing Mulholland Drive, the hikers turned southwest along the Bent Arrow 
Trail, a rugged footpath clinging to the wall of Rustic Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
About 9:15 a.m, the hikers turned south onto the Garapito Creek Trail, which 
corkscrews to the bottom of Garapito Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The trail turned southwest as it climbed from the base of the canyon, opening 
up to beautiful views of the summits to the west. Just before 10:45 a.m., the 
trail turned onto Chocolate Ridge and reached Eagle Rock, a huge outcropping of 
conglomerate rock that, at 1,957 feet above sea level, was the highest point on 
the hike. 
</P>
<P>
Turning down a fire road and then onto the Musch Trail, the group tramped 
through hilly grasslands into the heart of Topanga State Park. Often during 
this season, these meadows are ablaze with color, but this has not been a good 
year for wildflowers. Still, scores of flowers and plants were on display, 
including nicotiana, Chinese houses, wild mustard, yellow and sticky monkey 
flower, golden yarrow, fireweed and deadly nightshade. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why they go hiking, here is what some of them said: 
</P>
<P>
"It's very invigorating. It's a basic thing," said John O'Sullivan of Woodland 
Hills. "You go from Point A to Point B, and you feel like you've accomplished 
something. And you've done it without a skateboard or turbo power." 
</P>
<P>
"I like the exercise. I like the fresh air. I like the people," said Dave 
Morafka of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I hike once a week, and I hike for the beauty," said Cathy Govaller of Pico 
Rivera. "This is my beauty fix. Then also there's the camaraderie of kindred 
spirits, all out for the beauty of it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Towers of Downtown L.A. 
</P>
<P>
About 1:30 p.m., the hikers reached Parker Mesa above Pacific Palisades. To the 
south and east, foam piled up along the beach and boats scooted in front of the 
fog-shrouded hump of the Palos Verdes Peninsula. The Century City skyline stood 
out to the east, with the towers of downtown Los Angeles beyond. 
</P>
<P>
Turning off the East Topanga Fire Road, the hikers descended steeply through 
dense thickets and a garden of ferns to Los Liones Drive. 
</P>
<P>
A short distance beyond, Pacific Coast Highway served up a rude dose of 
reality. It took a full five minutes for a red light to part the sea of cars 
rushing by at near-freeway speeds. But finally there opened a path to the 
beach, and a chance to dip tired feet in the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
It was a little after 2 p.m. All over Los Angeles, people were coming off the 
back nine, or battling the crowds at shopping malls, or watching the game of 
the week. And 48 hikers were completing a walk from the Valley to the sea.

ROSS DESCRIBED AS 'SHAKING' IN PROSTITUTE'S ACCOUNT OF ARREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A young prostitute who was in a parked car with veteran Los Angeles County 
sheriff's narcotics investigator Rickey Ross when he was arrested by police 
Feb. 23 said in an interview that she smoked cocaine with Ross and described 
him as "shaking" from fright when officers confronted him. 
</P>
<P>
But the prostitute, Jimmie Joann McGhee, also said that she lied to police -- 
telling them that Ross had provided the cocaine -- in order to protect herself 
from a prison sentence. Instead, McGhee said, Ross gave her $10 to buy the drug 
on the street. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block has alleged that Ross -- whom Block 
fired April 27 -- was abusing drugs and alcohol on the night of his arrest by 
Los Angeles police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Ross said the prostitute was "lying," and his attorney denied that Ross was 
using cocaine that night. 
</P>
<P>
"I smoked a hit. And he smoked a hit," McGhee said in an interview at the Sybil 
Brand Institute for Women, where she is serving a brief sentence for 
prostitution. It was her first public statement about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
When police suddenly approached their parked car in South-Central Los Angeles, 
McGhee said, "the dude (Ross) was shaking" from fright. According to Block's 
account, Ross accelerated the car and sped off. He did not stop for three 
blocks, with police in pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
"I made him stop," McGhee said. "I said, 'If you don't stop, I'm going to jump 
out the window,' and I started rolling the window down. He said, 'Be quiet, I 
am the police.' " 
</P>
<P>
McGhee and Ross, 40, of Rialto, an 18-year department veteran, were arrested in 
the early morning of Feb. 23 near 57th and Flower streets by police officers on 
what was described as a routine traffic check. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ballistics Error 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates -- accompanied by Block 
-- accused Ross of slaying three South-Central area prostitutes with his 
service handgun. In a remarkable turnabout, the accusation was dropped last 
week when prosecutors said the original ballistics tests linking Ross to the 
slayings were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, on April 27, Block fired Ross based on several allegations, 
including the use of alcohol and drugs and the mishandling of narcotics 
evidence. Ross then appealed Block's decision. 
</P>
<P>
According to Block's termination letter to Ross -- which has since been 
provided by the department to The Times -- the information McGhee gave to 
police investigators in the hours after Ross's arrest played an important role 
in Block's decision to fire the deputy. The Los Angeles County Civil Service 
Commission is scheduled to decide today whether to hold a hearing on Ross' 
appeal of his firing. 
</P>
<P>
McGhee's account is in sharp contrast with the reputation of Ross, an 
undercover investigator who had a virtually unblemished record until his arrest 
and who was described by friends and colleagues as a highly religious man. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be more than obvious the girl is lying, because the story keeps 
changing," Ross said in response to questions about McGhee's account. He 
declined further comment, citing the Civil Service hearing scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
Ross' lawyer, Jay Jaffe, said that "there was no use of drugs (by Ross) that 
night, and all the chemical tests confirm that." As Ross was released, 
prosecutors said no drugs had been found in his system. Jaffe declined to 
comment on whether Ross had been drinking. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Credibility Questioned 
</P>
<P>
Jaffe also said that McGhee's admission that she lied about where the cocaine 
came from clouds her credibility. Jaffe said that if McGhee were to testify in 
court, her credibility would be in question because "if a witness lied on one 
material fact, she must be distrusted as to the balance. I don't think one can 
engage in selective truth-telling." 
</P>
<P>
McGhee, a lean woman who stands 5 feet, 7 inches and goes by the street name of 
"Jamie," said she has been a prostitute since she dropped out of school in 
Denver in the eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
McGhee said she had never seen Ross before when he first approached her while 
driving his county-leased blue Ford Tempo on Figueroa Street on the night of 
Feb. 23. 
</P>
<P>
"He jumped out of the car and asked, did I want to get high," McGhee said. "As 
soon as I got in the car I could see he was high. He said he had a few drinks." 
</P>
<P>
At no time, she said, did she see any evidence that Ross was with the Sheriff's 
Department. He did not identify himself as a police officer, she said. When 
Ross first approached her, McGhee said, he was wearing a Harley Davidson 
motorcycle T-shirt and "told me he was a biker. I didn't know he was a cop till 
later." 
</P>
<P>
As they drove on side streets, McGhee said, Ross complained that "he'd mixed 
his alcohol and that he couldn't do that 'cause it made him sick." At that 
point, McGhee said, Ross stopped the car, got out and "started throwing up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drug Purchase Made 
</P>
<P>
McGhee said that Ross then gave her $10 to buy some crack cocaine. She said she 
quickly found a seller at 47th and Hoover streets. 
</P>
<P>
McGhee said she changed her story when questioned by police about who provided 
the cocaine because she feared a stiff prison sentence for purchasing drugs. "I 
lied," she said in the hourlong interview. "I told (the police) Rickey already 
had (cocaine), but he didn't. I went and got it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Allegations in Letter 
</P>
<P>
According to Block's allegations, which are contained in his letter to Ross, 
McGhee said she was a "strawberry" -- a prostitute who exchanged sex for drugs. 
"She said that you provided a small piece of cocaine and at the time the 
officers approached your vehicle, you and she were smoking cocaine together," 
Block said in his termination letter to Ross. 
</P>
<P>
McGhee said that after buying the crack, Ross dropped her off at a motel on 
Western Avenue, where she bought a can of Pepsi from a vending machine, then 
emptied the can and used it as a crack pipe. 
</P>
<P>
"Criminalistics laboratory tests concluded that the Pepsi can taken as evidence 
revealed cocaine residue and your fingerprints, as well as those of the 
prostitute," said Block in his letter. 
</P>
<P>
Before police approached the car, McGhee said that Ross unzipped his pants "to 
make it look like we were having sex. I thought he was going to say that he was 
a cop and he was going to arrest me for prostitution . . . to set me up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sex Act Related 
</P>
<P>
But McGhee later told police "she was about to perform an act of oral 
copulation" on Ross, according to Block's letter. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said they found Ross' handgun in the trunk of the car. Ballistics 
tests were conducted on the weapon, a 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol, by the 
Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
McGhee said that she was jailed overnight, and then released. No police 
official, she said, discussed the unsolved murders of prostitutes with her. But 
"all us girls" knew about them, McGhee said. 
</P>
<P>
Since her arrest with Ross, McGhee said she has been arrested for a variety of 
crimes from jaywalking to striking a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
About Ross, she said: "I feel sorry for the man. He's gonna lose a lot."

BLACK LEADERS RALLY SUPPORT FOR BRADLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a taut display of political support that underscored the divisiveness of the 
controversy swirling around Mayor Tom Bradley, a coalition of black community 
leaders rallied in support of the beleaguered executive Tuesday and demanded 
that council members Michael Woo and Joan Milke Flores resign from the 
committee looking into Bradley's dealings. 
</P>
<P>
Angrily defending the mayor in an auditorium of cheering Bradley supporters at 
the Golden State Mutual Building in southwestern Los Angeles, the community 
leaders also urged the investigative agencies probing Bradley's financial 
dealings to draw their conclusions quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a nation and a society of laws and a man or woman is innocent until 
proven guilty," said John Mack, head of the Los Angeles Urban League. "Tom 
Bradley served this city long enough and well enough and with enough integrity 
and honor that he should be given the benefit of the doubt." 
</P>
<P>
But the harshest words by the assembly of community and religious leaders were 
reserved for reporters covering the unfolding drama surrounding the city's 
first elected black mayor, who is under investigation by the City Council, the 
city attorney and federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Paul Martin, pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian Church in South Los 
Angeles, called newspaper reports on Bradley's financial dealings part of a 
"nationwide attempt to discredit any black leader." 
</P>
<P>
"We know we have not been fully accepted as U.S. citizens," said Martin. "We 
know that our journey always demands more of us than anybody else and when some 
of us break through and make an indelible mark in the history of a city, state 
or nation, there are always people like the news media standing in the wings to 
discredit us." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the community leaders and the audience of several hundred supporters 
said the reports of Bradley's political troubles were racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
When a reporter asked the leaders, "Are you saying that the mayor would be 
getting different coverage if he were not black?", the crowd roared back: "Yes! 
Yes!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Look at the Record' 
</P>
<P>
"All you have to do is look at the record," added the Rev. E. V. Hill. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy over Bradley's future has ignited vocal expressions of support 
within the black community by residents fearful of the impact on the mayor and 
worried that his discrediting will damage the prospects of other black 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
Investigations into Bradley's conduct have also formed a backlash in the black 
community against Councilman Nate Holden, who is also black. Holden, while 
challenging Bradley for the mayor's office earlier this year, fanned 
allegations that Bradley's receipt of salaries from two local lending 
institutions doing business with the city presented a conflict of interest. 
Those allegations spawned the current, wide-ranging investigation into 
Bradley's conduct. 
</P>
<P>
"Nate Holden's star is not on the rise. It's on the descent because of this," 
said Mack. "There are many many people who are very, very angry at Councilman 
Holden and feel he has regrettably contributed to the problem rather than the 
solution." 
</P>
<P>
In a statement read by the Rev. Charles Belcher, the leaders called for the 
investigations into Bradley's finances to be concluded "within the next month 
or so," and it implied that ambitious members of the City Council had prompted 
the investigations. 
</P>
<P>
"One does not have to be a genius to conclude that any discrediting of Bradley 
by future mayoral aspirants would serve to quicken their own political 
opportunity for that office," the statement said. "We sincerely hope that those 
who are conducting this investigation are above reproach themselves and they 
are not living in glass houses." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resignations Asked 
</P>
<P>
Without naming names, the group's statement called for the resignation of "all 
future mayoral candidates" from the council's Governmental Operations 
committee, which is overseeing the city attorney's probe of Bradley's finances. 
</P>
<P>
In answers to reporters' questions, leaders targeted for resignation Councilman 
Michael Woo, who heads the committee, and Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, one 
of its members. The two council members were cited because, the leaders said, 
they have made inappropriate comments about the Bradley case before coming to 
any conclusion about the matter. Committee member Gloria Molina, who has been 
sharply critical of Bradley and is also considered a future mayoral aspirant, 
was not singled out. 
</P>
<P>
Defending themselves, Woo and Flores said they would not resign from the 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been very careful not to pass any judgments," said Flores, whose 15th 
District includes segments of South Los Angeles where Bradley is strong 
politically. "I think I've been most careful, probably more careful than most. 
. . . I don't feel I've drawn any conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Little Comment' 
</P>
<P>
Flores added that she has received "surprisingly little comment" from her 
constituents. Woo objected to claims that the Bradley probes have been fueled 
by racism. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it helps the mayor to raise the issue of racism," he said. "I 
don't think racism is a factor." 
</P>
<P>
"It's true that all 15 of the council members are political animals, as is the 
mayor . . . but the question is, is (the investigation) fair? I don't see any 
reason for myself or anyone on the council to disqualify themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of local newspapers also defended coverage of the Bradley 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
The editor of the Herald Examiner, which was specifically accused by several 
black community leaders of racist coverage, said he stood by the newspaper's 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
"The Herald Examiner has reported accurately and fairly on Mayor Bradley over 
the last several weeks," Maxwell McCrohon, editor of the newspaper, said in a 
prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps we have been singled out for criticism by some of the mayor's friends 
because our reporters were the first to disclose some of the financial dealings 
that are under investigation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bradley's Silence 
</P>
<P>
Noel Greenwood, deputy managing editor of The Times, argued that Bradley has 
made it more difficult to present his side of the story by simultaneously 
refusing comment. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor's refusal to respond to all the questions and allegations and issues 
that have arisen -- it is making things more difficult for the press," 
Greenwood said. "The mayor on one hand is complaining he's not receiving fair 
coverage and having his side of the story told. On the other hand, he's not 
telling his side of the story. . . . If he wants complete, total coverage, 
we're ready." 
</P>
<P>
A recent Times poll that showed a definite split between the city's black and 
Anglo communities on the subject of Bradley, his tenure and the investigations. 
The poll charted the views of three of Bradley's historic support groups -- 
blacks, Latinos and Jews -- and also the those of non-Jewish whites. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if they approved or disapproved of Bradley's job performance, for 
example, only 46% of Anglos said they approved of the mayor. But 60% of blacks 
and 65% of Latinos and 62% of Jewish voters supported the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
In answers to other questions, only 21% of blacks and Latinos said they 
believed Bradley had acted unethically, compared to 52% of Jewish voters and 
44% of other whites. Asked whether Bradley had misused his office for financial 
gain, only 24% of blacks and 32% of Latinos answered yes -- compared to 55% of 
Jewish residents and 57% of other white residents. 
</P>
<P>
Besides their concern over Bradley's future, the black leaders said Tuesday 
that they fear that the furor over his activities will adversely affect other 
black politicians. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Still Have Prejudice' 
</P>
<P>
"We still have racial prejudice all too often in Los Angeles," Mack said in an 
interview. "This kind of thing can feed into the bigots who are looking for a 
reason not to support blacks." 
</P>
<P>
Martin, of Redeemer Presbyterian Church, put it more bluntly at the press 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
"If we allow . . . the 16-year track record of one of the greatest mayors ever 
to be discredited," he said, "then the implication is clear that it will be a 
long time before the total community will trust anything that has a dark skin 
in terms of city government."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BOY KILLS FRIEND, 13, IN RUSSIAN ROULETTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 14-year-old boy shot a 13-year-old friend to death in a game of Russian 
roulette Tuesday in Valencia, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Soto, 13, of Newhall, died instantly when he was hit by a single round 
from a large-caliber handgun, Sheriff's Sgt. Birl Adams said. The gun belonged 
to the 14-year-old's father, Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, whose identity was not revealed because of his age, was taken to 
Sylmar Juvenile Hall and held on suspicion of murder. 
</P>
<P>
"They were playing a version of Russian roulette," said Deputy Val Mosley. "The 
difference was, they were pointing the loaded gun at each other instead of at 
themselves, and the 13-year-old happened to be the unlucky one." 
</P>
<P>
The boys were in the living room of an apartment where the 14-year-old lives 
with his parents when the shooting occurred at about 12:30 p.m., Adams said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $2.19 SEWER FEE INCREASE APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council approved a $2.19 monthly increase in sewer service 
fees Tuesday to help offset the cost of upgrading the city's aging sewer 
system. 
</P>
<P>
By an 11-0 vote, the council raised the average monthly fee 27%, from $8.24 to 
$10.43, effective July 1. The raise affects about 640,000 sewer customers. 
</P>
<P>
The council also approved an increase in the one-time sewer hookup charge for 
all new projects, hiking the fee for new homes from $1,728 to $2,003. 
</P>
<P>
The rate hikes, along with a later bond sale, are part of a plan to finance 
$3.4 billion in improvements to the city's sewer system.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY MOVES TO BAN UNTREATED ROOFING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday took steps toward 
requiring that fire-retardant roofs be installed on all new buildings in 
unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors ordered that an ordinance be drafted to require the 
installation of such roofs. The measure, supported by both fire officials and 
building industry representatives, would extend a ban on untreated wood-shingle 
roofs from mountain areas to the flatlands. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-0 vote was the result of recommendations from a committee created last 
December in the wake of several fires in the San Fernando and San Gabriel 
valleys. The wildfires were fueled by untreated roofs. 
</P>
<P>
Wooden roofs would still be permitted, but would have to be treated with a fire 
retardant.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal prison escapee accused of robbing a bank last week in Fountain Valley 
was arrested at a hotel in Wilmington Tuesday morning, U. S. marshals said. 
</P>
<P>
Manuel Garcia Bracamonte, 33, who had been serving a 25-year sentence for bank 
robbery when he fled from the penitentiary at Lompoc on April 21, surrendered 
to marshals and Los Angeles police without incident, according to Melissa 
Ashburn, a deputy marshal. 
</P>
<P>
Ashburn said the officers closed in after receiving a tip from an informant. 
</P>
<P>
Bracamonte, originally charged with 14 bank robberies between September and 
November, 1986, was convicted of four of them and sent to prison. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said he escaped by hiding in a box that was hauled outside the prison

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LEARY'S DAUGHTER RULED UNFIT FOR TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Pasadena Superior Court judge ruled Tuesday that the daughter of 1960s LSD 
guru Timothy Leary is mentally incompetent to stand trial in the attempted 
murder of her live-in boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Terry Smerling ruled that Susan Martino, 41, also known as Susan Leary, 
is incapable of understanding court proceedings and of assisting in her own 
defense. Smerling ordered Martino transfered from the Sybil Brand Institute to 
a state psychiatric treatment facility. 
</P>
<P>
Martino, 41, is accused of shooting Joel Ruben Chavira, 38, in the back of the 
head Dec. 18 as he slept in the Glendale apartment that they shared. The bullet 
lodged in the base of Chavira's skull but was removed by surgeons with no 
apparent complications. 
</P>
<P>
At the brief hearing on Tuesday, Martino stood silently in jail garb with her 
head down. Her attorney, public defender Jonathan Mendel, said Martino's father 
calls frequently to discuss her condition. 
</P>
<P>
Under Smerling's ruling, she will be evaluated by a physician within 90 days of 
her commitment. The physician can recommend that she remain confined or that 
she be ordered to stand trial.

EX-HONOR STUDENT NAMES FRIEND AS 'SKI MASK BANDIT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Harvard University student Jose Razo maintained Tuesday that a childhood 
friend was the real "ski mask bandit" who carried out a string of holdups that 
Razo is charged with committing while home in Orange County on school breaks. 
</P>
<P>
Razo's claim, which came as he took the stand for the second day at his trial 
in an attempt to repudiate an earlier confession, drew skepticism from the 
prosecutor, who said Razo was doing nothing more than "reaching out and naming 
a scapegoat." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Razo had testified that a friend from his hometown of La Habra, whom 
he refused to name, was the actual criminal whom police had dubbed the "ski 
mask bandit." 
</P>
<P>
But under pressure from Superior Court Judge Jean Rheinheimer on Tuesday, Razo 
relented and said the man who committed the robberies is named Richard 
Longoria, about 27 years old and a resident of La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Ravi Mehta, said in interviews outside the 
Santa Ana court that such a person exists and that investigators from the 
Orange County district attorney's office are trying to locate him. Mehta said 
Longoria, if found, may be subpoenaed to testify in Razo's trial. 
</P>
<P>
Razo, 22, is the key witness in his own defense. He is charged with 10 armed 
robberies in Orange and Los Angeles counties between December, 1985, and June, 
1987, in which a total of about $27,000 was taken. If convicted of all the 
counts, the former honor student and star football player at Anaheim's Servite 
High School could be sentenced to 21 years in prison, Mehta said. 
</P>
<P>
Razo said he was academically interested in the crime because he was taking a 
course at Harvard in 1986-87 entitled "Crime and Human Nature." According to 
Razo's defense attorney, John Barnett, Razo was gathering material in La Habra 
on why a disproportionate percentage of Mexican-Americans are convicted of 
crimes.

A TOKYO TALE: $2 MILLION FOUND IN BAMBOO GROVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The $2-million mystery of the bamboo forest, after playing through the Japanese 
psyche like a dark subplot to Tokyo's ongoing political scandal, finally has 
been solved. 
</P>
<P>
But as so often in Japan, the solution seemed only to deepen the mystery. 
</P>
<P>
It began April 11, when a humble seller of grilled chicken, rooting through an 
urban bamboo thicket for some tasty shoots, stumbled across a wad of rotting, 
abandoned yen. 
</P>
<P>
Like any good Japanese, he took the money to the police. 
</P>
<P>
Counting the crumbling bills with some difficulty, they calculated that the 
39-year-old restaurateur had picked up the equivalent of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The gorudo rashu came next -- a gold-rush fever that brought hundreds of 
money-seekers swarming to the grove in Kawasaki, hoping lightning might strike 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
And five days later, a humble part-time laborer, 21, who was actually hunting 
for wild cress, tripped across another $700,000 in yen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Parallel 
</P>
<P>
The frenzy grew, as hundreds more searched for a "third installment." And the 
mystery of who would abandon nearly $2 million without even burying it, and 
then fail to claim the cash when it was found, seemed to obsess the nation, 
even more than the news of the political scandal shaking the government. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, many observers saw a connection between easy money flowing through the 
political world and the mysterious cash of the bamboo forest. It helped 
headline writers, although not the embattled prime minister, that the first 
character of Noboru Takeshita's name means "bamboo" -- and that he had received 
about $2 million from Recruit Co., the conglomerate at the center of the 
scandal that has forced him to announce his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
But as Japan's press rushed forward with theory after theory -- each more lurid 
than the last -- to explain the unclaimed cache, the dark side of politics was 
but one rich lode. Mystery writers were interviewed, past murders rehashed, 
fantastic scenarios constructed around drugs and gangsters, blackmail and tax 
evasions. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, the speculation reflected modern Japanese anxieties -- fear that 
unaccustomed prosperity is corrupting morals and dividing rich from poor, old 
from young. 
</P>
<P>
"The average Japanese cannot play the money game, and when these worlds 
collide, as they did in the bamboo thicket, public interest is immense," the 
newspaper Yomiuri said in an editorial. "It seems that recently the gap between 
the average citizen and the ultrarich has vastly widened . . . that our 
society's view toward money has become very distorted, and this causes great 
frustration for many Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
Many experts -- and nearly all Japanese depicted themselves as experts on the 
subject -- said the money was somehow connected to soaring land or stock prices 
that seem to be disrupting Japan's stable, middle-class society. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gangster Involvement? 
</P>
<P>
Mystery writer Kyuzo Kobayashi, for example, speculated that someone trying to 
extricate himself from the shady side of the land business flung the cash away, 
only to be caught and murdered by gangsters also involved in land profiteering. 
</P>
<P>
Joji Abe, himself a gangster turned mystery writer, speculated that an old man 
hid the money to cheat his children of their inheritance and then died before 
he could enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
While the press speculated and philosophized, police methodically investigated. 
Paper wrappers around the cash carried dates and the names of several credit 
unions in the Kawasaki area, outside Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Comparing the wrappers with bank records, police eventually focused on the 
president of a mail-order business, Kasuyasu Noguchi, 46, who had made sizable 
withdrawals two and three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Owner Fesses Up 
</P>
<P>
Noguchi recently held a press conference and said, yes, the money belonged to 
him. Bowing deeply, he apologized to the people of the world for the trouble he 
had caused. 
</P>
<P>
But Noguchi's explanation, as provided to reporters and more fully to police, 
was "beyond comprehension," Yomiuri said. 
</P>
<P>
Noguchi said he actually had earned the cash in the early 1970s, speculating in 
stamps and other things. A thief had been stalking his office, he told police, 
so for years he carried the money in the trunk of his car. 
</P>
<P>
When Japan began printing a new type of cash, Noguchi exchanged the money for 
new bills -- thus the wrappers indicating withdrawals two and three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, his desire for the money lessened as friends were murdered or 
committed suicide in business-related matters. 
</P>
<P>
"My view of life changed," Noguchi told police. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Feared Tax Audit 
</P>
<P>
He resolved to give the money away, he said, but -- acknowledging that he had 
failed to pay taxes on the income -- he feared a tax audit if he donated the 
money in his own name. So, he said, in October, 1987, he left $2 million in the 
bamboo grove, hoping someone worthy would find it. 
</P>
<P>
He was "relieved" when someone recovered the money, he said. If he gets it 
back, he said he will donate it for research into children's diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they found the explanation puzzling but that they saw no basis for 
further criminal investigation. Tax authorities said they would investigate, 
but income earned so long ago would be beyond their reach. 
</P>
<P>
Seiei Sato, the grilled-chicken seller who found the first chunk of cash, said 
he, too, remained mystified by Noguchi's account, but might be willing to 
settle for a 20% finder's fee and go back to serving yakitori. "It's 
troublesome," he said. "My head is already in a chaotic condition." 
</P>
<P>
The elderly owner of the bamboo grove said he did not care about the money but 
he was unhappy that people were taking his bamboo shoots. 
</P>
<P>
And the press and public seemed to be waiting for a sequel to the mystery, or 
at least another chapter. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel," the Yomiuri editorial said, "the disappointment we experience when 
reading a very bad end to a detective story."

STORIES FROM THE EDGE; 
</P>
<P>
FOR MANY OF L.A.'S HUNGRY, ADVERSITY VISITS SUDDENLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL CIOTTI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They come in battered Pintos with bald tires and missing fenders. 
</P>
<P>
They get off buses, transfers in hand. 
</P>
<P>
They walk in off the street pushing expropriated shopping carts. 
</P>
<P>
Or they drive up in shiny new vans with chrome roof racks and stereo speakers 
fore and aft. 
</P>
<P>
But no matter how they arrive at the county's 475 food pantries, the stories 
they tell have a common theme -- for whatever reason, they live their lives so 
close to the economic edge that anything from a flat tire to an extra-large 
utility bill is enough to put them in the one place they never expected to find 
themselves: standing in line for free food. 
</P>
<P>
For Ruth Alexander, the thing that pushed her over the edge was problems with 
men. 
</P>
<P>
"I was doing great," wrapping meat in a Sacramento supermarket for $12 an hour, 
she says. She had her own car, $300 in savings and a rented room. 
</P>
<P>
Then, she says, "my boyfriend got out of jail." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander is a husky, forthright, trusting woman with her hair piled up in a 
bun and a big purple bruise on her left arm. "My boyfriend did that," she says. 
"He popped my finger, too. I said, 'Hey, I need that to work.' " 
</P>
<P>
He was in culture shock, she says. He didn't know he didn't have to act tough 
anymore. "I felt sorry for him. I took him out to dinner. I spent all my 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Because her boyfriend had grown up in Los Angeles and thought on that account 
he'd have a better chance of finding work here, Alexander sold a diamond ring 
to finance the trip. 
</P>
<P>
When they arrived in Los Angeles, Alexander immediately found work wrapping 
meat in a San Fernando Valley supermarket. It was only later that she 
discovered the pay was just $5.70 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"This is crude," she says. "I was making $12 an hour by myself and doing great. 
Now I'm supporting both of us on $5.70 and sleeping in my car." 
</P>
<P>
A malfunctioning air conditioner led to Keith Perau's standing in the free food 
line. He had a job as a maintenance man to an African consulate in Beverly 
Hills and was living with his wife and their three kids in a house trailer on a 
little side street in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
During a heat spell, Perau complained to the manager that the air conditioner 
didn't work, he says. Then, three men armed with two-by-fours showed up to 
evict him: "They beat me up and threw me out on the street." 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Perau lost his job and couldn't find another. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm dyslexic," he says. "I can't fill out the application. I can't find work. 
I can't find nothing." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Perau says his family now gets $500 a month welfare while living 
in a motel that costs $560 a month. It's an awful place, full of prostitutes 
and crack addicts. "You got people knocking on doors all night." Whenever he 
has to leave for anything, his wife, he says, waits in the locked room with a 
.357 magnum. 
</P>
<P>
On top of everything else, Perau says he has a kind of colon cancer that has 
left him drained and dispirited. 
</P>
<P>
But he's afraid to have an operation because that would mean leaving his wife 
and kids alone in the motel while he recuperates. 
</P>
<P>
"If dad is on his back, he can't provide," Perau says. 
</P>
<P>
It was a red light in Van Nuys that did in Danny, the carpenter. He's 29, blond 
and broad-chested with curly hair and a polite low-key manner. He's originally 
from Ontario in San Bernardino County. He doesn't want to give his last name, 
he says, because he never paid his ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Last Nov. 22, while lost in Van Nuys, a police officer stopped him for going 
through a traffic light. Because he didn't have his license on him, Danny says, 
the police impounded his car and left him and his wife standing in the street. 
"I had a '71 Cougar, good condition, registered and everything," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Danny didn't know what to do. He'd never been on the street before. He and his 
wife spent that first night sitting up in an all-night coffee shop. 
</P>
<P>
He never did get his car back. Every day the impound yard added another $9 in 
storage fees, which Danny couldn't pay. After 45 days, they auctioned off his 
car to the highest bidder. And he's been stuck in the San Fernando Valley ever 
since, living in a motel room and when necessary collecting free food. 
</P>
<P>
There is no end to the reasons why people go hungry in Los Angeles: a new baby, 
unemployment, the need to come up with first, last and a security deposit when 
renting a new apartment. Sometimes people simply don't know where to get food. 
Other times they have no way of getting there. 
</P>
<P>
Or, like Jean Hastings, who until recently had been making $7 an hour running a 
machine in a plastic bag plant, they haven't been out of work long enough to 
quality for welfare. 
</P>
<P>
At the Seedling food pantry in South-Central Los Angeles, director Rita Russo 
has served Central American immigrants who have applied for amnesty, and are, 
therefore, ineligible for Aid for Families With Dependent Children (amnesty 
applicants are required to be self-sufficient). 
</P>
<P>
At the San Pedro Harbor Interfaith Shelter, Sister Marilyn Rudy once had a man 
come in for free food because he had injured himself on the job and his lawyer 
wouldn't let him work until he settled his lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Even people getting public assistance need free food, because sometimes the 
checks are late or never come at all, says Cheri Miller, a welfare advocate at 
the Harbor Interfaith Shelter who testified at a hunger hearing held by City 
Councilman Robert Farrell in March. Other times, the benefits are arbitrarily 
reduced. "Most people only get a fraction of what they are entitled to," Miller 
says. But when the clients complain, she says, "the welfare office hangs up on 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Nor is it only the poor who need free food. 
</P>
<P>
Construction workers and gardeners sometimes need help during rainy spells. 
Homeowners have been forced to the wall by the recent rises in their variable 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Screenwriters came by the North Hollywood Interfaith Food Pantry during the 
writers' strike, says Jerry Rabinowitz, captain of the Friday food giveaway. 
"Afterward, they sent us checks for $100 or $150." One woman who used to come 
in for free food married a farmer. "Now," Rabinowitz says, "she brings us a 
crate of lettuce every week." 
</P>
<P>
Still the most common complaint by people who need free food is the high cost 
of rent -- which in many cases consumes 75%-80% of the family income. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Cleveland, 39, a single mother with three children at home, gets $760 a 
month in welfare and food stamps. But she immediately pays out $600 of that sum 
for rent. As a result, Cleveland says, "I usually run out of food the middle of 
every month." 
</P>
<P>
There are, of course, food stamps. But rarely are they enough. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured it out," says Jimmy, an unemployed person with heart and lung 
problems who gets $24 a month in food stamps. "That's only 80 cents a day. Dogs 
and cats get better." 
</P>
<P>
As he leaves the North Hollywood Interfaith Food Pantry, Rick Rofman has a 
stroke of luck -- he finds five pennies on the asphalt parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a five-cent peanut butter cup at the 7-Eleven," he says, happily. "I 
pick up pennies wherever I find them. I never used to think this way -- I just 
used my MasterCard." 
</P>
<P>
Rofman is bright, articulate and opinionated. He lives in a spectacularly 
unruly apartment littered with large piles of newspapers, magazines and 
assorted articles of clothes and decorated with hundreds of magazine 
photographs taped to the walls. 
</P>
<P>
He says he has two master's degrees from Syracuse University and is a Phi Beta 
Kappa graduate of the University of Pennsylvania -- though when he discovered 
that he went to school with Donald Trump, "I wanted to commit suicide." 
</P>
<P>
On this morning, Rofman, who is 46, walked six miles for his bag of groceries 
but he's quite light-hearted about it all: "When you have diabetes and high 
blood pressure, walking is the best thing in the world. The thing about this 
(economic) depression is that it will strengthen people like me." 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Rofman taught English composition and vocabulary at local 
community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Now he lives on $100-a-week unemployment, which after paying for the 50 
magazines to which he subscribes leaves him with so little discretionary income 
that he recently asked the phone company to disconnect his telephone. 
</P>
<P>
Two years before, the bank repossessed his car, but it didn't bother Rofman -- 
"I couldn't afford to put gas in it anyway." 
</P>
<P>
In order to survive, Rofman has devised all sorts of mini-strategies to save 
money. Recently he went through all his old letters and peeled off any 
uncanceled stamps to re-use. "I found a 6-cent Eisenhower," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever he has a hamburger at McDonald's, he pockets little bags of 
condiments. 
</P>
<P>
"Many times," he says, "my lunch has been four bags of ketchup." Because the 
food pantries don't always have toilet paper, he takes extra sheets from public 
rest rooms. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, he says, his total assets are $3 or $4 in the bank and two 
shares of Disney stock. 
</P>
<P>
When panhandlers stop and ask for money he gives them 50 cents, even though, he 
says, he may only have $1.50 in his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
If they ask "Is that all?" Rofman replies that Jesus only required people to 
give 10%: "I just gave you 30%." 
</P>
<P>
People who work in free food distribution agree that hunger is getting worse in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Emergency food requests in the city are up 10% over the previous year, 
according to a January, 1989, report by the U.S. Conference of Mayors, while 
the amount of food available from such large groups as the Los Angeles Regional 
Food Bank is down 21% for the same period. 
</P>
<P>
The first three months of 1989 were so bad, executive director Doris Bloch 
says, it made her "blood run cold. I remain hopeful. I have to be. But we are 
really hanging on by our fingernails." 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the problem is that distributions of government surplus flour, 
honey, butter, cornmeal, cheese, rice and nonfat dry milk have dropped 
dramatically in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, which distributes food to 425 charitable 
groups in Los Angeles County serving an estimated 175,000 people a week, 
received 65% less government surplus food in 1988 than it did the year before. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, there has been a significant drop in some kinds of private 
contributions from the large food companies and supermarket chains. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of debt service for (their) leveraged buyouts," Doris Bloch says, "the 
big companies are selling their outdated, surplus and damaged goods to the 
secondary market" instead of donating the goods to food banks. As a result, she 
says, some charitable groups have even quit coming to the food bank. "They 
don't get enough food." 
</P>
<P>
The people hardest hit are mothers with infants and young children. 
</P>
<P>
During the flush government surplus years, many mothers fed their children 
nonfat dry milk. Now with the surplus depleted, many mothers, says Cheri Miller 
of the Harbor Interfaith Shelter, have had to resort to filling their babies' 
bottles with watered-down Kool Aid or iced tea. 
</P>
<P>
At the Failure to Thrive clinic at the Harbor-UCLA medical center in Torrance, 
UCLA pediatrician Carol Berkowitz says she sees 10 to 15 babies a week. 
</P>
<P>
Because at least a third of the children simply don't get enough to eat, she 
says, they are small and dwarfed with smaller heads and smaller brains. Their 
ribs show, their flesh hangs loose, there's no swell to their buttocks. The 
size of newborns is smaller too -- 5-6 pounds, as opposed to a more normal 7-8 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
There are several reasons for such malnutrition, Berkowitz says. Mothers who 
are taking drugs often either lose their appetite and neglect to feed their 
kids or just assume that, like themselves, they're not hungry. Some mothers 
don't know about free food programs or because of their illegal immigration 
status are afraid to take advantage of them. 
</P>
<P>
For some mothers, it requires a trip on four different buses just to get to a 
food pantry. 
</P>
<P>
But for the most part, the real problem isn't so much a shortage of food as a 
shortage of nutritious food. 
</P>
<P>
"Peanut butter is like gold," Rabinowitz says. "We need more soups. And I would 
like to be able to give out more than one can of tuna fish to a family of 
eight." 
</P>
<P>
Although most people who get free food are deeply appreciative for the help, 
not everyone standing in line for free food is a charming model citizen 
temporarily down on his luck. 
</P>
<P>
"Some come in real demanding," says Oleeta Crow, a full-time volunteer at the 
Seedling food pantry on South Broadway. They think they are in a supermarket -- 
"I want two butters. Do you have any toilet paper?" 
</P>
<P>
The North Hollywood Interfaith Pantry had to hire a guard to placate neighbors 
who complained that its clients were littering the street with food wrappers, 
and, on one occasion, defecating on the lawn. 
</P>
<P>
Some people need food because they don't use good judgment when it comes to 
spending their money. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm amazed," Berkowitz says, "how many people have TV sets but don't have 
enough food." 
</P>
<P>
Nor are all the people who show up really hungry. Some recipients only want to 
sell the food for drugs and alcohol. When Rita Russo, a former Catholic nun, 
first opened the Seedling six years ago, she often got burned, she says, by 
single men coming in and saying they had six kids to feed: "I started asking 
for proof that the kids existed. And they quit coming in after that." 
</P>
<P>
Rabinowitz estimates that perhaps 20% of the people who come into his operation 
for food are running some little scam. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, he says, it's not worth it to try to separate the needy from the 
greedy -- "We give food to anyone who asks." Besides, he says, if 20% of the 
food requests are scams, that means "80% really need it." 
</P>
<P>
"I do a lot of praying that I will get out of here," says Oleeta Crow, a single 
mother of four sitting at the kitchen table of her small battered house near 
Gage Avenue and South Broadway in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
There are police drug busts up and down the street, knife fights at the nearby 
liquor store and drive-by shootings at the apartment house next door. 
</P>
<P>
Her kitchen sink leaks so badly the floor sags. When it rains, a stream of 
water drips directly into the bathroom toilet bowl. Because the drain has been 
disconnected, the suds from her washing machine run across the utility shed 
floor and out into the side yard, turning the grass gray and making the lawn 
look like a toxic dump. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all this, Crow, 32, is candid, usually cheerful and quite industrious, 
volunteering up to 45 hours a week at the Seedling food pantry next door. 
</P>
<P>
Then, last winter, she got a part-time job at $7 an hour distributing food 
vouchers for food and shelter to homeless people during cold weather. "I was 
making good money," she says, "$500 a month." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Applying for Unemployment 
</P>
<P>
When the warm weather returned and her job ended, she tried to go back on 
welfare. But welfare workers told her to apply for unemployment instead. At the 
unemployment office, they told her she hadn't worked long enough to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
Then, when Crow tried to get Social Security benefits for her daughters (their 
father recently had died in a car crash in Mexico), "the lady asked me if I was 
crazy," Crow says. "She said he didn't work long enough." And besides, the 
caseworker said, he had been working under a phony number. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, welfare agreed to take her back -- but only after 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, she was 100% dependent on free food from the Seedling to feed her 
family. And recently, Crow says, a woman from the Department of Water and Power 
showed up with a cut-off notice resulting from an unpaid electric bill of 
$115.70. 
</P>
<P>
For the kids' sake, Crow tries not to be depressed in front of them. When she 
feels bad, she waits until everyone is asleep. Then, she says, "I just lie 
there and cry."

<P>
And so, we hear, the opera job at the Bastille will go to Myung-Whun Chung. 
</P>
<P>
Myung-Whun Chung? 
</P>
<P>
Myung-Whun Chung! 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't seem to be a very good choice. But then it doesn't seem to be a very 
good job. 
</P>
<P>
The plot, you may recall, reads like a bad opera bouffe. The French government 
decided a few years ago that the city of Paris needed yet another opera house. 
Two weren't enough. 
</P>
<P>
Its inauguration would celebrate the bicentennial of the French Revolution. The 
cost: a whopping $350 million. 
</P>
<P>
To run the house, official "conservative" politicos -- ever sage in artistic 
matters -- engaged Daniel Barenboim, sometime pianist and maestro of 
L'Orchestre de Paris. He had limited experience in opera. Many experts found 
his conducting eminently resistable. His plans for Paris turned out to be 
unimaginative and virtually un- if not anti-French. 
</P>
<P>
But never mind. Somebody up there liked him. He agreed to take the job for a 
whomping $1.1 million. Repeat: $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Enter the new Socialists, equally erudite in matters cultural. They appointed 
-- who else? -- Pierre Berge to supervise the inherited opera project. His 
primary credential for the post: mogulship for the fashionable fashions of Yves 
St. Laurent. 
</P>
<P>
Berge decided that Barenboim would earn too much money, put on too few 
performances, spend too much time elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, logic and righteousness seemed on Berge's side. Unfortunately, the 
instant impresario also made a broader decision: 
</P>
<P>
The artistic director in Paris really shouldn't be an artistic director. He 
should just keep quiet and wave his little stick. 
</P>
<P>
Adieu to logic and righteousness. Adieu also to Barenboim. 
</P>
<P>
Chaos reigned for months, amid much gleeful gnashing and mutual recrimination. 
Many famous artistsrallied behind their fallen hero and threatened to boycott 
the Bastille. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Berge wants Chung to pick up the pieces, and a new round of disasters 
looms. Parisian prestige is on the line. It is a precarious line. 
</P>
<P>
Chung is relatively young and reasonably talented. Still, he hardly seems to be 
the man for this perilous post. Maybe no one else wanted it. Maybe Berge wants 
someone he knows he can kick around. 
</P>
<P>
Chung enjoys a modest international reputation at best. His specific experience 
in opera is, to put it mildly, limited. He has never headed any major cultural 
organization. He has never had to open a can of socio-political worms like 
this. 
</P>
<P>
The prognosis for his success -- much less survival -- in the city of light is 
dubious. 
</P>
<P>
Be that as it may, his appointment will have no effect on the international 
game of Musical Chairs. He wasn't even a likely candidate for the other 
significant openings. 
</P>
<P>
This is a bizarre but sad old story of befuddled priorities and extra-artistic 
interference. There are no heroes here. There might be a victim. 
</P>
<P>
The French did not invent the eternal and universal problem of artistic 
interference. In America, members of almighty boards of directors have long 
been known to tread upon artistic toes. Angelenos with good memories may recall 
what happened when board members decided to hire one Zubin Mehta for the No. 2 
post at the Los Angeles Philharmonic -- without bothering to consult Georg 
Solti, who happened to hold the No. 1 post at the time. 
</P>
<P>
The dilemma becomes most disastrous, however, when governments want to 
establish artistic policies. Certain American presidents -- remember Reagan? -- 
have tried to wipe out national arts subsidies yet, at the same time, create 
tax penalties that discourage the generosity of private donors. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone wants the state to help pay the cultural tab. But no one wants the 
state to tell an artist how to do his job. Artists, after all, don't officially 
tell statesman how to run the country. It might not be a bad idea, now that we 
think of it, but they don't. 
</P>
<P>
We live in interesting times. We live in strange times. The brouhaha in Paris 
reminds us that we also live in silly times.

NBC JOINS UP WITH SEARS AFTER CBS ENLISTS K MART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two weeks after CBS announced that it would be hooking up with K mart to 
promote its fall schedule, NBC said Tuesday it will be doing the same thing 
with Sears. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas the CBS-K mart campaign will feature a viewer contest with more than 6 
million prizes, the NBC-Sears venture will offer grand-prize winners "instant 
stardom" by flying them to Hollywood to appear on NBC's prime-time programs and 
in promotional spots for the network. 
</P>
<P>
The promotion, announced at the annual NBC affiliates convention here by John 
Miller, senior vice president of NBC Entertainment, and Thomas E. Morris, vice 
president of marketing for Sears Merchandise Group, will run over a five-week 
period beginning Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
Miller called the venture "the largest and most exciting promotion in network 
history." 
</P>
<P>
The grand-prize winner in each of four weekly contests beginning Sept. 3 will 
receive, along with a part on a prime-time program and transportation for two 
to Los Angeles, use of a limousine, a deluxe hotel suite, a "beauty makeover," 
shopping sprees, a luxury automobile and $10,000 in cash. Other prizes include 
cars, big-screen TVs, airline tickets, Sears gift certificates and NBC 
merchandise worth a total of $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
To enter the contest, the entrant must answer simple questions about new NBC 
programs. Answers can be found in program descriptions that will appear in 
Sears advertising supplements beginning Labor Day. Entry blanks, available in 
the advertising supplements and at Sears stores, can be deposited in boxes at 
Sears stores. 
</P>
<P>
Sears will also include an eight-page color insert describing the new NBC shows 
in more than 20 million SearsCharge billing statements in September. 
Descriptions of NBC's fall lineup also will be inserted in the Sears fall 
catalogues, which wil be mailed to customers the week before the TV season 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
As K mart stores will be doing for CBS, Sears retail stores throughout the 
country will feature "NBC fall preview centers" decorated with mobiles, 
banners, posters and billboards, and will bombard shoppers with 
public-address-system announcements. A special "preview video" highlighting the 
contest and the new NBC shows will play on television sets in the stores. DIANE

AMPLE TARGETS FOR THE NEW 'NOT NECESSARILY THE NEWS'

George Bush, the horseshoe President, clunks his wife Barbara in the head with 
an errant toss. . . . 
</P>
<P>
A promo for Fox Broadcasting features a murderous fugitive who was profiled on 
Fox's "America's Most Wanted," captured on "Cops," convicted on a new show 
"Trial" and is about to be electrocuted on another new Fox series, "Execution 
of the Week". . . . 
</P>
<P>
Fed up with scouring oil-caked rocks on the beaches of Alaska and its ongoing 
image problems, Exxon decides to kill two birds with one stone by giving away 
the blackened rocks as paperweights to its customers at gas stations. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Not Necessarily the News," Home Box Office's award-winning series of political 
and social satire, is back with a new cast, a regular weekly time slot and its 
tongue still planted ever-so-caustically in cheek. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning at 10:30 tonight, the latest incarnation of the long-running program 
will be taped on the day of broadcast, allowing the writers the opportunity to 
poke fun at the people in the headlines that very day. 
</P>
<P>
"We have always been frustrated that we had to tape and edit the show long 
before it aired," said John Moffitt, the show's executive producer. "And that 
meant either we included a topical piece that was stale by the time it aired or 
we missed something current. This will really help us to be more biting, to 
really get in there and be sharp with all our barbs." 
</P>
<P>
Though the original "Not Necessarily the News" had always been a darling of the 
critics and had won more ACE awards (cable's equivalent of the Emmy) than any 
cable series in history, the show had never been a huge popular success -- even 
by pay cable standards. HBO decided it needed some shaking up. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's inevitable that after six years a show gets a little stale," said 
Michael Fuchs, chairman of HBO. "And we felt that this was an important program 
that deserved more attention than it was getting. I think sometimes in pay 
television it's hard for a show to be as big a hit as it should be. We don't 
get the cover of TV Guide or the cover of People. 
</P>
<P>
"I do think people have to be told what's a hit in this country. (Bill) Cosby 
does a series and he's on every magazine and everyone says it's a hit and it 
becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. We don't get that kind of topspin from our 
series except at the very beginning." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's good that they've given us a regular weekly spot," said Matt 
Neuman, the show's producer and head writer, who has been with the program 
since it began in 1982. "Part of the problem was that people who liked the show 
never knew when it was on. But I don't think it was necessary to revamp the 
whole thing. It's like in baseball, they fire the manager when the owner can't 
think of anything better to do." 
</P>
<P>
Moffitt, a director from the early days of "Saturday Night Live" and the 
creator and producer of the ABC late-night series "Fridays," based "Not 
Necessarily the News" on "Not the Nine O'Clock News," a British series that 
used footage from the British Broadcasting Co. to lampoon the world's political 
leaders. Moffitt and his business partner, Pat Tourk Lee, pitched the program 
to ABC, but the network turned it down, so they went to HBO. 
</P>
<P>
But while Moffitt and Lee take seriously their role as the loyal opposition 
against the longtime Republican administration in Washington, the show has 
never been just an endless onslaught of political satire. Some of its best and 
best-loved bits have been its commercial parodies and fake interviews with 
famous people, in which a "Not Necessarily the News" actor asks his or her own 
questions to edited sound bites from a real news interview. In this way, an 
innocuous Marilyn Quayle interview can be twisted into a conversation about 
supposed sexual liaisons with half the politicians in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Though the new version of the show will resemble an actual newscast with two 
anchors sitting at a news desk, it will also retain most of these other 
elements. An upcoming episode, for example, will include a spoof of the movie 
trailer for the new film "Batman," featuring Batman and his new boy wonder, 
Rainman. 
</P>
<P>
The new program will also include reports and sketches from political and 
social satirists Harry Shearer, Merrill Markoe, Will Durst and Richard Rosen. 
Also making guest appearances will be former regular Lucy Webb, who has won the 
ACE award for best comedic actress four years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Anything and everything, the producers say, is fair game -- from Connie Chung 
and Maury Povich to Jim Wright and Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
Moffitt and Lee did veto a commercial parody a few years back that played on 
the shooting down of the Korean airliner over the Soviet Union. The idea was to 
do an ad for Samsonite luggage, showing an undamaged suitcase floating amid 
human limbs and the wreckage from the plane. 
</P>
<P>
"We wouldn't do that because we really weren't making any point," Lee said. 
"But as long as we can find some message, anything is up for grabs."

A young college student, raped by an acquaintance, says of her attacker, "He 
doesn't see himself as a rapist. He's kind of 'Joe Average.' " 
</P>
<P>
She is one of many victims who talk about their experiences in "Against Her 
Will" (tonight at 9 p.m. on the Lifetime cable channel), a documentary about 
campus rape, a crime that has reached epidemic proportions across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly McGillis hosts this sober, informative hour, quietly announcing that she 
herself is a rape survivor. Divided into five segments, the program, produced 
by Jorn Winther, begins by defining rape -- it is sex against a woman's will, 
no matter what the circumstances. It then defines the rapist: He is usually 
personable and friendly -- and he can be anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Next, we're told how sluggish official response continues to help men get away 
with the act and then we're shown new, on-campus rape education programs. The 
last segment offers a list of "do's and don'ts" for women, to help them avoid 
becoming victims. 
</P>
<P>
"Men have learned not to listen to a woman's reality," says a USC psychologist. 
He speaks of the need for men to develop empathy and stop "objectifying" women. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most vivid illustration of the need to change societal messages 
comes from informal, on-camera interviews with several pleasant-looking male 
students who earnestly explain that "women like men who are in control," that 
"they dress to attract a lot of men" and that a woman can expect rape "if she 
is drunk at a party." 
</P>
<P>
The program repeats Saturday at 9 p.m., June 3 and June 8, both at 1 p.m.

OWNERS WONDER IF KEMP WANTS TO REPLACE ROZELLE

<P>
The job is Jack Kemp's if he wants it, the owners of several National Football 
League clubs indicated privately here Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
There seems to be only one hitch: Does he want to be the NFL commissioner or 
continue as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in President Bush's 
cabinet? 
</P>
<P>
As the former congressman from Buffalo, N.Y., grapples with that question, the 
owners of most NFL clubs are here also discussing it. They also are sizing him 
up with the other candidates for the position that Pete Rozelle is vacating. 
</P>
<P>
The owners will not say flatly that they want Kemp because of the possibility 
that he doesn't want the job. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Kemp, formerly a quarterback for the Buffalo Bills in the 1960s, 
didn't return phone calls to those he knew were seeking his comments on the 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Kemp issued a statement through a department spokesman: "His plans are 
to fulfill his commitment to serve in the Bush Administration." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the six-owner committee researching Kemp and other candidates met at 
length Tuesday night in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
The co-chairmen, Wellington Mara of the New York Giants and Lamar Hunt of the 
Kansas City Chiefs, said they wouldn't discuss the findings before making their 
report to the convention today. 
</P>
<P>
A site for Super Bowl XXVI in 1992 also will be selected this afternoon. The 
game will be played in a northern domed stadium, probably at Indianapolis or 
Seattle. The other candidates are Minnesota and Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
NFL Notes 
</P>
<P>
The new international football league will begin play next April, its 
commissioner, Tex Schramm, said after meeting with an owners' committee 
Tuesday. Schramm's plans: Teams will be based in New York, London and 10 other 
cities, including six foreign cities. The West Coast franchise isn't likely to 
be in Los Angeles. The league will be owned by stockholders, including some NFL 
club owners, and the players will also be owned and paid by the league. The 
teams are to be franchised to local owners.

KENTUCKY GIVES UCLA OK TO TALK WITH MILLS

<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA received permission from the University of Kentucky Tuesday to talk with 
Chris Mills, the former Fairfax High School basketball player who last week was 
ruled ineligible to play at Kentucky in connection with sanctions levied 
against the school by the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Jim Harrick was unavailable for comment, but assistant coach Brad Holland 
indicated that UCLA would pursue both Mills and LeRon Ellis, who said Monday 
that he planned to transfer from Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
"When you talk about that caliber of player, any program like ours is going to 
be interested in them," Holland said of Mills, a 6-foot-7 swing man, and Ellis, 
a 6-11 center from Mater Dei High in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Mills' father, Claud, said last week that UCLA was his son's first choice. 
Ellis has not indicated what schools he is considering. 
</P>
<P>
Gary McKnight, who coached Ellis at Mater Dei, said the center is planning to 
visit St. John's, Nevada Las Vegas and Syracuse. JERRY CROWE

CITY 4-A BASEBALL PLAYOFFS CANCELED BECAUSE OF BOYCOTT BY COACHES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
City Section officials Tuesday canceled their 4-A Division high school baseball 
playoffs, scheduled to start today, because of a coaches' boycott stemming from 
the teachers' strike against the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-A Division playoffs will start today as scheduled, Commissioner Hal 
Harkness said. 
</P>
<P>
Harkness announced the cancellation after a poll of the 16 schools whose teams 
had qualified revealed that only six were willing to field teams without the 
coach of record. Harkness declined to name the schools. District rules dictate 
that the school official coaching a team must be a credentialed employee. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a recommendation by the Los Angeles City Coaches Assn. that teachers 
honoring picket lines continue to coach their teams, a group of 18 4-A coaches 
voted last week to boycott the season until the strike ends. 
</P>
<P>
Playoffs have continued in all other spring sports -- golf, gymnastics, 
softball, swimming, track and volleyball. JOHN LYNCH

NBC and Freedom Bowl officials have signed a multiyear agreement to televise 
the postseason football game as part of its New Year's weekend lineup. 
</P>
<P>
The game, played since 1984 in Anaheim Stadium, produced a National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. bowl-game record in its first year when Iowa's Chuck Long threw 
six touchdown passes, and again in 1986 when Gaston Green of UCLA rushed for 
266 yards.

In an attempt to capture a piece of the state budget windfall, San Diego Mayor 
Maureen O'Connor and the City Council declared a "state of emergency" over the 
city's recent spate of drug- and gang-related shootings and asked Gov. George 
Deukmejian to give the city $34 million to help quell the violence. Deukmejian 
press secretary Kevin Brett, questioning whether O'Connor's unusual gambit was 
a publicity stunt, said that such declarations are traditionally reserved for 
natural disasters and predicted that the governor would reject the request out 
of hand. O'Connor, flanked by City Manager John Lockwood and an impassioned 
Police Chief Bob Burgreen, insisted that their call for 1.3% of the state's 
new-found $2.5-billion surplus is a genuine plea for help. "This is not a 
frivolous publicity stunt," the mayor said. "We are very serious in San Diego 
that we have a problem and we would like our state government to help us."

A Soviet search ship photographed the hulk of a nuclear-powered submarine that 
sank off Norway on April 7 with the loss of 42 crew members and found no 
increase in radiation in the area, the Tass news agency said. The Soviet 
research ship Akademik Mstislav Keldysh arrived May 16 in the waters where the 
sub -- armed with nuclear-tipped torpedoes -- sank. It visually detected the 
wreck with the help of deep-sea exploration vehicles it carries and 
photographed it, Tass said.

The South Korean government deployed 10,000 riot police and arrested 300 people 
to block a planned rally by students demanding the expulsion of U.S. troops. No 
clashes were reported. Student groups had called for a week of protests in the 
capital of Seoul and other cities to demand withdrawal of the 43,000 U.S. 
troops based in South Korea under a mutual defense treaty. Radical leaders say 
the United States props up authoritarian rule in South Korea. Troops conducted 
spot checks on many streets, questioning and searching people and taking away 
suspects.

7.2 QUAKE SHAKES S. PACIFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A huge earthquake ruptured a stretch of seabed about 125 miles north of 
Macquarie Island, midway between Australia and Antarctica, officials reported. 
The Australian Seismological Center said the quake had a magnitude of 7.2. The 
U.S. Geological Survey, which said the temblor was the strongest anywhere in 
the world this year, put the reading at 8.2. The Australian center said a 
stretch of seabed from 30 to 60 miles long and up to two miles deep apparently 
had ruptured, with one geological plate sliding over another. Undersea 
earthquakes sometimes result in tidal waves, but there was no evidence one had 
occurred. The South Pacific island of Macquarie is uninhabited except for a 
research station.

SIRHAN AGAIN DENIED PAROLE

<TEXT>
<P>
Sirhan Sirhan, serving a life term for assassinating Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, 
was denied parole after a hearing in which he expressed remorse for the slaying 
and said 21 years in prison was "plenty of punishment." The state Board of 
Prison terms said Sirhan, 45, was unsuitable for parole and called Kennedy's 
murder one of the most shocking crimes in U.S. history. Sirhan told the 
three-member panel: "I feel very sad, very sorry, very remorseful that a human 
life was taken. After 21 years, I have become quite convinced that my act was 
very wrong. I wish from the bottom of my heart that this crime, this horrible 
event, never occurred." The board set a new parole hearing for next May and 
recommended that Sirhan continue in self-help therapy, accept a prison work 
assignment and undergo an in-depth psychiatric evaluation.

JAMES FLANIGAN: STABILITY DRAWS FOREIGN MONEY TO U.S. MARKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's encouraging the stock market? Although stock prices declined broadly 
Tuesday, the market has been very strong in the past week and a half, lifting 
the Dow Jones industrial average to new post-crash highs. And many experts see 
a basically rising market, with occasional short-term dips, continuing into 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
What's behind it? Lots of things, including Chinese students in Tian An Men 
Square demanding democracy and shouting the names of Jefferson and Lincoln. 
Their apparently successful challenge to established government is frightening 
some people, particularly in Asia, and causing them to look for safety by 
investing in U.S. stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Money is funny that way: Most people cheer Beijing students shouting Jefferson 
and Lincoln. But money people in Hong Kong and elsewhere often see unrest and 
so send cash to the safety of the politically stable United States -- perhaps 
not even making the connection that it is because of the democracy of Jefferson 
and Lincoln that the country is a politically stable place for money. 
</P>
<P>
But foreign buying isn't the only reason for the market's strength. 
</P>
<P>
The outlook for inflation is good. Prices of industrial commodities are 
falling, consumers are spending less and saving more -- U.S. personal savings 
rates are rising -- notes Charles Clough, investment strategist for Merrill 
Lynch &amp; Co. That means more domestic savings is available to finance 
government budget deficits, so less foreign capital will be needed -- and 
ultimately the Federal Reserve can ease up on interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
And individual investors have been returning to the stock market, showing 
enthusiasm for the first time since the October, 1987, crash. In a global 
market where all the talk is of institutions throwing around billions, the 
individual investor tends to get lost. But individual share owners are huge in 
number and powerful in effect -- without them the market is dull and lacks a 
deep reservoir of buyers and sellers, as it has for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1987, at the peak of the bull market when the Dow Jones average 
topped 2700, there were 53 million individual share owners, according to 
Sindlinger &amp; Co. of Wallingford, Pa., which keeps such figures. As of last 
November, their numbers had dwindled to 33 million, but since then they have 
come back slowly -- today there are 47 million individual share owners. And 
many have become active in the last few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We're having our busiest month since the crash," says Thomas Quick, vice 
president of Quick &amp; Reilly, the discount brokerage firm. Individual 
investors "have seen blue chip stocks going up four and five points and have 
come into the market," explains Quick. "After all, what's the downside risk?" 
</P>
<P>
Actually, there's plenty of risk. In the crash, even the biggest companies lost 
almost a third of their value. That led investors to quit the stock market as 
they had only once before in the postwar period, after the market's decline in 
1970. Otherwise the number of individual share owners in the United States has 
risen steadily from 6.5 million in 1952 -- just about the time a 
marketing-minded head of the New York Stock Exchange named G. Keith Funston 
began attracting investors with the slogan, "Own your own share of American 
business." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, but, with the market averages rising sharply, are individuals tempting 
fate by investing again? No, say the pros, today's conditions are different 
from the time of the crash. There's no speculation and new issues markets are 
quiet, notes Robert Farrell, market strategist of Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
And relative prices are much lower. At the crash, stock prices were close to 20 
times the average company's earnings -- a point reached only five times in more 
than 100 years of stock market action, according to "Wall Street Waltz," a book 
by San Francisco investment adviser Kenneth Fisher. Most of the time, the 
market's average price-earnings ratio is a little below 15, and stocks begin to 
look cheap at PE ratios of 13. Today, with corporate profits having grown, the 
market's average PE is 12. 
</P>
<P>
And there's cash in mutual funds and pension funds available for investment, 
says market analyst Elaine Garzarelli of Shearson Lehman Hutton. She sees 
inflation staying below 4.5% and the next two years being good for stocks. 
</P>
<P>
She is not alone. Nomura Securities, Japan's largest brokerage firm, recently 
told a meeting of its international representatives that U.S. equities are the 
buys right now -- the first time since the crash that Nomura has been bullish 
on the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
Which means more foreign investment. That trend will grow as more of the 
world's people are allowed to invest in U.S. stocks and bonds, says John 
Hennessy, vice chairman of CS First Boston, an international investment bank. 
As recently as 1979, explains Hennessy, government restrictions in most 
countries kept investments within national borders. But as such laws are 
relaxed, more people are free to invest their money wherever they wish -- with 
first choice, by far, the politically stable United States.

HIGH-TECH FIRMS, MIT JOIN FORCES TO ENSURE U.S. WILL ENJOY NEW TECHNOLOGY'S

Two of the nation's top high-technology companies and one of its premier 
research universities Tuesday announced the creation of a consortium intended 
to seize the lead in commercializing the new technology of superconductors. 
</P>
<P>
In a joint announcement, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, International 
Business Machines and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said the 
consortium, believed to be unique in this country, should serve as a model for 
other groups trying to take the lead in other new technologies. 
</P>
<P>
The United States now leads the world in basic research on superconductors, and 
the consortium is intended to assure that U.S. rather than Japanese firms have 
the advantage in marketing the products or processes that come out of the new 
science 10 or 20 years from now. 
</P>
<P>
Superconductors are ceramic materials that, when cooled to more than minus 200 
degrees Fahrenheit, suddenly let electricity pass through them with no 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
Since resistance is the greatest problem in storing and using electricity, 
creating unwanted heat and dissipating power, superconductors in theory will 
allow energy to be stored and transmitted with no loss of strength and more 
cheaply than at present. Fully realized, this could mean faster computers; 
extremely powerful batteries, magnets and electric motors, and cheaper 
household current. 
</P>
<P>
The new organization will be called the Consortium for Superconducting 
Electronics. The first four members are AT&amp;T, IBM, MIT and Lincoln 
Laboratories, a separate government-sponsored MIT lab. More companies, 
universities and government laboratories will be recruited later. 
</P>
<P>
The group formed on the recommendation of a presidential committee established 
by the White House Science Council, which said in January that such an approach 
would be necessary if the United States was to avoid continuing the pattern it 
followed in laser and videotape technologies. Both were created in the United 
States but commercially exploited by the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
"The notion behind it is the absolute sharing of information," said Ralph E. 
Gomory, IBM senior vice president for science and technology, "and the 
companies will give up control of the work to the consortium. That's what I 
think is exciting." Gomory chaired the president's committee and was a chief 
organizer of the consortium. 
</P>
<P>
Each participant in the consortium is expected to give up something and gain 
something in the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The companies and universities will put, overall, the equivalent of 25 
full-time professionals into the work and will relinquish control over them to 
managers named by the consortium. The managers will direct all the researchers 
as a single team. 
</P>
<P>
The companies thus gain what they have eagerly sought: help from top university 
researchers in developing commercial products. The universities and government 
labs in return get additional funds to add staff and students. Under a joint 
"intellectual property" agreement, they will also share with the labs any 
profit that might come from commercial success. 
</P>
<P>
The four initial participants are turning over an investment equivalent to $10 
million to the consortium's management. The leaders of the group -- Gomory of 
IBM, provost John Deutch of MIT and Saul Buchsbaum, an executive vice president 
of AT&amp;T -- will present their plan today to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
They hope to get up to $6 million over the next three years from the Pentagon's 
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

OBSESSION ADS WERE VOTED MOST MEMORABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Calvin Klein has come out smelling like a rose, again. At least his provocative 
print advertising campaign for Obsession perfume sure has. 
</P>
<P>
When 24,000 consumers were recently asked to name the most memorable print 
advertisements of the past year, more of them remembered Calvin Klein's 
sensuous ads than any others. It was the fourth year in a row that Calvin Klein 
-- which also advertises underwear and jeans -- was ranked No. 1 in the annual 
survey conducted by the New York research firm Video Storyboard Tests. 
</P>
<P>
The Obsession campaign has long walked the fine line between artistic nudity 
and pornography. Many of the ads show models nude or semi-nude, with portions 
of their bodies hidden. Both male and female nudes appear in the ads -- often 
in the same photograph. While some religious organizations have strongly 
objected to the ads -- forcing several publications to pull them -- the 
campaign has helped to make Calvin Klein one of the most familiar names in 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 2 ranking went to Revlon, for print ads that featured celebrities such 
as Liza Minelli and singer Debbie Gibson. The Marlboro man slipped slightly in 
the saddle, to the No. 3 spot. 
</P>
<P>
Calvin Klein finished far ahead of the rest of the pack. "Calvin Klein is one 
of the few companies whose print advertising is actually more memorable than 
its television advertising," said Dave Vadehra, president of Video Storyboard 
and editor of the newsletter Commercial Break, which published the survey 
results. "Keep in mind, Calvin Klein spends far less on print advertising than 
anyone else in the top 10." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Calvin Klein -- which designs its own ads -- spent a comparatively 
paltry $4.4 million last year on print advertising compared to second-place 
Revlon, which spent $49.8 million, and third-place Marlboro, which spent $88 
million, according to the New York research firm LNA/Media Records. 
</P>
<P>
So what does this say about the state of print advertising? "It says that sex 
still sells," said Candace Port, managing editor of the trade publication 
Inside Print. "There's a lot of talk out there about print ads getting back to 
more of a family style, but the titillating approach still works." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, fashion magnate Calvin Klein refuses to discuss his ads. He declined 
to comment through a company spokesman. "He feels that if he talks about our 
advertising it can lose its effectiveness," said Paul Wilmot, senior vice 
president of public relations at New York-based Calvin Klein Inc. "But I'll say 
one thing: Calvin is not a proponent of scientific research. He simply goes 
with what he likes." 
</P>
<P>
And what he likes, the public apparently remembers, too. In the written survey 
by Video Storyboard, one Tampa, Fla., respondent explained that he liked the 
Obsession campaign because "it is erotic and poetic at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Calvin Klein aside, all is not poetic for print advertising these days. 
Although $14.3 billion was spent on the medium last year, experts say that 
growth has slowed in recent years. In February, the car maker Nissan stunned 
print advertising executives when it announced that it was going to divert the 
money it had planned to spend on print advertising to television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
"Print is only worth using if you can segment your market," said Vadehra. 
"Television can give you 20 million households. To reach that many in print, 
you'd have a lot of waste, a lot of duplication, and you'd spend an incredible 
amount of money." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, some advertisers, such as cigarette makers, have little choice but 
to use print. After all, they can't advertise on TV or radio. And perhaps one 
of the most unusual print advertisements introduced in 1988 was the comic image 
that Camel cigarettes gave its trademark camel "Old Joe," on the brand's 75th 
anniversary. The company says that the cartoon-like "New Joe" was introduced to 
improve sales in its key market, men ages 21 to 34. New Joe -- often placed in 
swashbuckling situations, such as saving a woman from a sinking ship -- 
resembles the television character Alf. 
</P>
<P>
Some opponents of smoking have criticized the camel's clear appeal to young 
children, but R. J. Reynolds Tobacco insists that he is not for kids. "We took 
extra pains in test-marketing to make sure that he appealed to adults, not 
children," said Maura Payne, the company's manager of external communications. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Camel, four other print advertisers broke into the top 10 last year -- 
Revlon, Estee Lauder, DeBeer's diamonds and the fragrance Elizabeth Taylor's 
Passion. Vadehra said the Passion perfume prints ads are popular mostly because 
Elizabeth Taylor appears in them. One consumer in Schenectady, N. Y., in 
responding to the survey, said Elizabeth Taylor's looks alone are "worth the 
price of the perfume." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone faired as well as Liz. Guess Jeans, for example, which was ranked 
No. 5 in 1987, failed even to finish in the top 40 in the 1988 survey. A 
spokesman for Guess refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
And the Marlboro Man, who was the nation's top-ranked print advertising image 
for nearly 25 years, continues to slip slightly. Four years ago, Calvin Klein 
replaced the Marlboro Man in the top slot. And in 1988, he also fell behind the 
Revlon ad campaign. "I'd say it's an honor for any campaign to rank in the top 
three for this long," said Steve Weiss, a spokesman for Philip Morris U.S.A., 
the maker of Marlboro. "We expect to stay there well into the future." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the billions of advertising dollars spent by liquor manufacturers, no 
liquor campaign made the top 10 and only one made the top 50. Absolut, the

CARE ENTERPRISES CREDITORS SAY TOP OFFICIALS MISMANAGED FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHARLES TIGHE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Creditors of bankrupt Care Enterprises of Tustin have accused the company's top 
management of engaging in insider trading, manipulating earnings reports and 
generally profiting from corporate transactions at the expense of Care 
bondholders, shareholders and employees. 
</P>
<P>
Court documents filed by the creditors also allege that executives of the 
troubled nursing home chain entered into questionable business deals, took 
corporate jets on fishing trips in violation of company policy and stayed in 
$1,000 hotel suites at company expense. 
</P>
<P>
The court papers, filed Monday by a committee of Care creditors, ask the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles to oust Care's management and replace it with 
an independent trustee. 
</P>
<P>
The company is expected to file a formal response to the allegations before a 
scheduled June 16 hearing on the trustee request. Although the response is not 
yet ready, Care attorney Arnold Kupetz denied Tuesday that the company's 
management has acted improperly. 
</P>
<P>
Twin brothers Lee Roy and Dee Roy Bangerter, the company's principal owners and 
top officers, could not be reached Tuesday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Care filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code in March, 1987. Care has total debt of about $180 million. 
</P>
<P>
The creditors committee, which represents unsecured bondholders, has been 
seeking removal of Care's current managers since last year. But the court 
documents filed Monday represent the first detailed look at allegations of 
mismanagement raised by creditors of the company. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those allegations involve actions by the Bangerters. 
</P>
<P>
The creditors' court filing states that Lee Roy Bangerter, Care's chairman and 
chief executive, sold 200,000 shares of Care stock to the company's employee 
stock ownership plan on April 2, 1986, for that day's market price of $6.75 per 
share. 
</P>
<P>
One month later, according to court documents, Care reported that its 
first-quarter earnings had fallen by more than 50% from the previous year's 
$264,000. 
</P>
<P>
The creditors charge that Bangerter knew about the earnings decline when he 
sold the stock but failed to inform the head of the ESOP committee. They also 
allege that he did not tell the committee that his shares were classified as 
"restricted" under securities laws and could not be resold for a significant 
length of time. 
</P>
<P>
Care's stock closed at $6.50 per share on Friday, May 9, the day the earnings 
decline was announced publicly, and $7 on the following Monday. The price of 
Care stock began falling later in the year and was trading for about 50 cents a 
share when the company filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Care attorney Arnold Kupetz acknowledged Tuesday that Bangerter sold the shares 
to the ESOP, but he said the sale was approved by company attorneys. He said 
the executives administering the ESOP probably had as much information about 
the company's operations as Bangerter did. 
</P>
<P>
A second allegation contained in the creditors' court papers is that the 
company manipulated its reported earnings in an effort to improve the 
appearance of its financial performance in advance of a $51.8-million bond 
offering. 
</P>
<P>
The creditors said the company prematurely reported the sale of a convalescent 
care center during the first quarter of 1985. Care recorded a $150,000 profit 
from the planned sale, which was later scuttled. The recorded gain accounted 
for about 20% of first-quarter 1985 earnings. 
</P>
<P>
But the company had received only $60,000 of the $500,000 purchase price, the 
creditors allege, and the sale had not been completed at the end of the 
quarter. Under accounting rules, the profit should not have been recorded in 
the first quarter, court documents state.

ITALIAN FILM MAKER WILL HEAD OPERATION;

<P>
CANNON NAME GETS HOLLYWOOD SEQUEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL DELUGACH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cannon name will rise again in Hollywood movie production after a brief 
departure. It is being reborn as Cannon Productions, which will be headed by 
Ovidio Assonitis, an Italian maker of English and foreign-language horror 
films. 
</P>
<P>
This Cannon is being fashioned from a corporate subsidiary owned by Los 
Angeles-based Pathe Communications, which until early April was named Cannon 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
Another Italian, Giancarlo Parretti, rescued Cannon from a financial crisis in 
1987 and took control of the company last year from Menahem Golan and Yoram 
Globus. Golan departed in March to produce films on his own, while Globus 
remained with Parretti. 
</P>
<P>
The two Israeli cousins had bought Cannon Group in 1979 and operated it as a 
"mini-major" studio, making such films as "Runaway Train" and "Missing in 
Action." During their tenure it became a Wall Street darling and then withered 
into a near-bankrupt firm, accused by federal securities regulators of 
fraudulently misstating its financial statements. 
</P>
<P>
Cannon, along with Globus and two other individual defendants, settled the 
Securities and Exchange Commission's civil complaint in November, 1987, without 
admitting or denying the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement Tuesday said Assonitis has paid $500,000 for a 20.6% interest 
of 21st Century Distribution Corp., which has the right to use the Cannon 
Productions name and logo for 30 years. Parretti, Golan and Globus had bought 
80% of publicly traded 21st Century when it was in bankruptcy proceedings and 
sold it at cost to Cannon Group in February. 
</P>
<P>
With financing from unspecified "European sources," the new Cannon Productions 
will make up to 10 pictures a year for six years at an average budget of $3 
million each, according to the announcement. A Pathe division, Pathe Services, 
will have distribution rights to the pictures during the six-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Daily Variety on Tuesday quoted Assonitis as saying at the Cannes Film Festival 
that he will be chairman of Cannon Productions and that Pathe executive 
Christopher Pearce will be president and chief operating officer. The company 
will be headquartered in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Assonitis, 44, is said to have produced more than 36 films in his career and 
has made some of them with American actors. Among his films that have been 
shown in the United States are "Beyond the Door" and "The Curse." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, De Laurentiis Entertainment Group declined to comment Tuesday on 
another Variety report from Cannes that Parretti had made a new bid to buy DEG 
out of bankruptcy proceedings. Parretti had dropped out of the bidding earlier, 
and the company agreed to a reorganization plan under which it is to be 
acquired by Carolco Pictures. A U.S. bankruptcy judge in Los Angeles must 
approve the company's disposition. 
</P>
<P>
Parretti moved to Beverly Hills from Europe several months ago and hired Alan 
Ladd Jr. to make movies under the name Pathe Entertainment. Parretti has been 
seeking to buy properties in an attempt to build a U.S. film empire. 
</P>
<P>
However, he recently lost out in bidding for New World Entertainment, a Los 
Angeles-based television producer, and dropped out of the running for two 
smaller movie firms, Kings Road Entertainment and Peregrine Entertainment.

It's almost 1990, and most of us would agree by now that women and men are, 
well, different. And that's just the point that the publishers of Entrepreneur 
magazine want to make on June 20, when they launch their latest editorial 
effort: Entrepreneurial Woman. 
</P>
<P>
The 114-page June issue includes articles on the best cars for women's 
entrepreneurial life styles, the outlook for the infant-products industry and a 
woman record executive, as well as a health column. 
</P>
<P>
The new periodical is planned as an every-other-month companion to the 
successful Entrepreneur, an Irvine-based publication whose audited readership 
is 300,000 and about 25% female. The June issue of Entrepreneurial Woman is a 
prototype, with regular issues to follow in February. 
</P>
<P>
Rieva Lesonsky, editor of both magazines, concedes that basic issues are the 
same for male and female business owners. But she also talks a lot about 
"women's special needs" and said her latest creation will do the same. 
</P>
<P>
"Women face some unique problems in starting their own businesses," Lesonsky 
says. "Raising money is harder because of the attitude of bankers. And it's 
only recently that we've given women the approval to work, let alone own their 
own companies." 
</P>
<P>
Lesonsky is quick to rattle off a raft of horror stories gleaned mostly from 
letters written by Midwestern readers of Choices: For Entrepreneurial Women, a 
short-lived quarterly that Entrepreneur delivered in 1985 then abandoned in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
Choices did "fairly well," Lesonsky says, but was discontinued after three 
issues so the staff could concentrate on Entrepreneur. Choices magazine may 
have died, she says, but it left a legacy of letters that motivated editors to 
try another publication for businesswomen. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a letter from a woman who went to a bank with a very detailed business 
plan," she says. "The banker, in the Midwest, told her they were not in the 
habit of funding 'hobbies.' Another woman wrote that the bank told her they 
wanted her 17-year-old, under-age son to co-sign for her loan." 
</P>
<P>
So the need, Lesonsky says, is there for a magazine like Entrepreneurial Woman. 
But is there a market for the product? 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely," says Rick Boden, an economist with the Small Business 
Administration's Office of Advocacy. Not only is the market there, but it's 
growing. In 1977, the SBA counted 1.9 million woman-owned sole proprietorships 
operating in the United States. By 1986, the latest year for which statistics 
were available, the number had grown to 4.12 million. 
</P>
<P>
And women business owners are branching out, Boden says. In the early 1970s, 
such entrepreneurs were huddled mostly in the service and retail industries. 
Today, Boden says, their numbers are growing in such non-traditional industries 
as construction and manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
But Boden has a caveat for the publishers of Entrepreneurial Woman: This 
working woman's wave may be cresting soon. 
</P>
<P>
"We see a growth in women-owned business," Boden says. "But we don't know how 
long, however, this fairly rapid growth rate will continue. We think it will 
probably slow down soon after 1990." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the fact that the number of women business owners may peak, it's 
still growing now, says Judy Devin, spokeswoman for the National Assn. of Women 
Business Owners. And those women who help fuel the economy deserve to read 
about themselves and their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Devin, too, contends that women do business in a fashion far different from 
men. But, like Lesonsky, she is a bit hard pressed to point to specific 
disparities. 
</P>
<P>
"Women do business differently," she starts. The National Assn. of Women 
Business Owners is "doing studies on how women set up businesses, and we're 
finding that we're much more egalitarian, there's no hierarchy. We look for 
consensus management. We try to be more flexible in our workplace. A lot of 
women are raising families and running businesses." 
</P>
<P>
But what this different kind of business owner reads, Devin says, comes pretty 
much from the same list that her male counterpart uses. According to an 
association survey, women business owners read Inc., the Wall Street Journal, 
Fortune and Nation's Business.

INCREDIBLE OFFER FOR NWA, PAN AM; 
</P>
<P>
WOULD-BE INVESTOR HALTS TRADING WITH ANNOUNCEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A New York man on Tuesday raised corporate eyebrows and some Wall Street doubts 
by issuing a news release claiming that he leads a group that is planning to 
simultaneously acquire Pan Am Corp. and NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest 
Airlines, for a total of $4.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
New York Stock Exchange officials temporarily stopped trading on NWA and Pan Am 
stock when they received word of the statement. NYSE officials later raised 
questions about the seriousness of the statement and trading was resumed later 
in the day. NWA stock closed up $2.125 at $106 a share. Pan Am stock rose 37.5 
cents to $4.75. 
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued in New York, said Michael Sterns of Trans Global Holdings 
Inc. was in the final stages of creating an investor group that might bid up to 
$130 a share for NWA and up to $7 per share for Pan Am. Trans Global was 
identified as a privately held New York-based holding company. 
</P>
<P>
The statement said further information could be forthcoming by next week but 
did not indicate who would finance the plan. Stern, identified as chairman of 
Trans Global, declined to provide any background on himself, the company or its 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a hoax," he told the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest spokesman Alan Muncaster said Stern had requested financial 
information from Northwest but had not submitted any financial information of 
his own to the airline. "Let's wait and see if we get an offer before 
speculating on whether this is a hoax," Muncaster said. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am spokesman Jeff Kriendler, however, said Stern had shown previous 
interest in acquiring Pan Am but "never has been able to demonstrate any 
financial support, and in view of that history we would not view this proposal 
as being credible." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the NYSE, Richard Torrenzano, also said the proposed deal is 
questionable or bogus. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Bartlett, former undersecretary of the U.S. Commerce Department and a 
New York University law professor specializing in corporate takeovers, said 
legitimate corporate suitors normally reveal their financial backers and 
information on their financial stake in the target company. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest, which has been a takeover target since late March, has invited 
interested buyers to submit bids by May 30. Pan Am announced May 9 that it 
might submit an offer, but it was continuing to seek financing. 
</P>
<P>
Stern's statement said there would be no breakup of either airline if the 
acquisition is completed. 
</P>
<P>
The statement also said the Stern group of investors would pay about $29 
billion for 300 new aircraft and parts, bringing the total cost of the deal to 
$34 billion, making it "the largest corporate transaction ever."

DIRECTOR OF TIME RESIGNS; DOESN'T CARE FOR SHOW BIZ

Time Inc.'s decision to expand in Hollywood by merging with the entertainment 
giant Warner Communications Inc. apparently does not sit well with the Texas 
lumberman on Time's board. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Temple, former chairman of Time's divested Temple-Inland lumber and 
forestry subsidiary, is resigning from the board because the entertainment 
business is "not a type business I can be proud of," according to a Warner 
proxy statement released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not to say I feel it will not prove profitable," added Temple, who 
controls 3% of Time Inc. stock. His stake is the second largest; only Henry 
Luce III, heir of the Time founder, holds more shares. 
</P>
<P>
Temple, 69, who voted for the merger despite his reservations, could not be 
reached late Tuesday at his home in Diboll, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
He is one of three members of the current Time and Warner boards who have not 
been nominated to the 24-member board that will oversee Time Warner when the 
merger is completed. The others not nominated are Clifford J. Grum, president 
of Temple-Inland, and Henry C. Goodrich, former chairman of Sonat Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the proxy statement disclosed that Time may have to dispose of some 
cable systems to comply with government rules against owning a cable system and 
a television station in the same market. A Time spokesman said five Southern 
California systems could be affected because a major Warner shareholder, 
Chris-Craft Industries, owns KCOP-Channel 13. 
</P>
<P>
He identified those cable systems as American Cablevision of Orange, ATC 
Cablevision of San Marino Inc., ATC Cablevision of South Pasadena Inc., Canyon 
County, ATC Cablevision and Time's 50%-owned Paragon Cable system, which serves 
Hawthorne and Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer than 100,000 subscribers are served by those five systems, the spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Kathryn Harris in Los Angeles contributed to this story.

'DON'T DO IT,' INSIDER LEVINE TELLS STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who can better describe the dangers of insider trading than -- well, an inside 
trader? 
</P>
<P>
That certainly was the reasoning Tuesday when Dennis B. Levine, the investment 
banker whose 1986 arrest for insider trading led to convictions of speculator 
Ivan F. Boesky and others, spoke of his criminal travails to UCLA graduate 
business students. 
</P>
<P>
Levine's message: Don't do it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not worth it," Levine said of insider trading and other white-collar 
transgressions in an interview following his talk, which was closed to 
reporters. "And it's not just because of what happened to me. It's because of 
what happened to my family, the innocent victims." 
</P>
<P>
Levine's appearance was one of several speeches at colleges and universities he 
has given since he was released in last September after serving 18 months of a 
two-year sentence on four counts of securities fraud, tax evasion and perjury. 
Levine's talk to students of UCLA's John E. Anderson Graduate School of 
Business was his first at a West Coast institution. 
</P>
<P>
Levine said he hoped that describing his prison experience and the toll it took 
on his wife and two young children would deter ambitious business students from 
illegal or unethical practices. The former investment banker served the first 
few months of his sentence in a federal prison in Lewisburg, Pa., before being 
moved to a Manhattan halfway house. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the approximately 60 students in attendance said Levine described in 
his talk an emotional story of how he was unable to explain to his then 
5-year-old son why he did what he did. 
</P>
<P>
"If the students can really understand and feel what's it's like (through my 
experiences), then my message will be effective," Levine said in the interview. 
</P>
<P>
Several students said the message got through. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not worth going through what he had to go through for the amount of money 
you can make" through insider trading, said Henry Brandon, a second-year 
business student. 
</P>
<P>
"We had discussions in class about ethics, but I never really talked to anybody 
found guilty," said David Peters, another second-year student. "So having a 
real-life issue and a real-life person discussing it (was) a great 
opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, were not so impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"He operates on a functional level of morality where you don't do something 
because you don't want to get caught, not because it's wrong," said Julane 
Marx, a first-year business student. 
</P>
<P>
One student, David Strauss, objected to Levine's being invited in the first 
place. "He's a convicted felon and it's grossly inappropriate to be inviting 
someone like him out here under these circumstances," said Strauss, who read a 
letter protesting the event just before Levine's speech began. 
</P>
<P>
Levine, 36, was an executive in the mergers and acquisitions department at 
Drexel Burnham Lambert when he pleaded guilty in 1986 to making $12.6 million 
in illegal profits from insider trading.

HASBRO MAY BE TRYING TO PURCHASE COLECO

Hasbro Inc. officials refused to comment Tuesday on published reports that the 
world's biggest toy maker would buy most of Coleco Industries Inc. under a plan 
to be presented in bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
The Hartford Courant on Tuesday quoted sources close to Avon-based Coleco's 
10-month-old bankruptcy case as saying that details of the purchase were being 
negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Alperin, executive vice president of Hasbro Inc., said representatives of 
both companies were forbidden to speak publicly about the case under an order 
issued last month by U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York. 
</P>
<P>
A secretary for Coleco's chairman, Morton Handel, said he would be away from 
his office all day but would not say where he could be reached. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Hasbro, Coleco and Coleco's creditors are scheduled to 
discuss the plan today before the bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, expected to be announced today, would strengthen Hasbro's position in 
the toy business by adding to its product lines well-known Coleco items such as 
Cabbage Patch Kids and the board games Scrabble and Parcheesi. 
</P>
<P>
Coleco grew into one of the nation's largest toy makers over the past decade, 
propelled in large part by the popularity of its Cabbage Patch Kids dolls. 
Demand for the dolls dropped beginning in 1986 and Coleco was unsuccessful in 
introducing new products.

As many as seven people were reported killed and others were injured when 
security forces in Bulgaria, backed by tanks and other armored vehicles, opened 
fire during weekend protests by thousands of ethnic Turks in several cities, 
sources in Vienna and Sofia said. They reported that the confrontations were 
the most violent outbursts since a campaign in recent years by Bulgaria's 
Communist authorities to get ethnic Turks to adopt Bulgarian-sounding names, 
restrict their Muslim religious rites and bar the Turkish language in public. 
The Bulgarian news agency BTA acknowledged that four people had died.

Fears that the new immigration law may cause a farm labor shortage in 
California have failed to materialize in the San Joaquin Valley, according to 
the chairman of the Fresno Farm Bureau's labor committee. Grape grower Don Laub 
said "the work force looks real good," although he admitted that it is still 
too early to predict whether there will be enough workers when the harvest 
season reaches its peak in late summer. Many growers expressed concern last 
year that not enough undocumented workers would legalize their status under the 
amnesty provisions of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 to form an 
adequate labor pool. "That fear has failed, so far, to materialize," Laub said, 
"and it may never happen."

A blind man beaten by Hayward police officers who thought his folding white 
cane was a martial arts weapon has filed a $200,000 claim against the city. 
Harry Bruno, city risk manager, said the city will probably reject the claim 
filed by David St. John. "I couldn't see the city agreeing to pay those 
amounts," he said. St. John, 37, seeks half of the money for himself and the 
rest for an organization that helps the blind. "A lot of blind people are upset 
over what happened," he said. "I'm hoping that something good can come out of 
this." Under the law, St. John's claim must be rejected before he can sue. He 
was beaten with a baton after he resisted demands from officers to surrender 
his cane. He said the officers did not identify themselves, and he thought he 
was being mugged.

The 883-foot Overseas Juneau, a tanker carrying 17 million gallons of crude 
oil, hit a pier and demolished a 100-foot section of a concrete catwalk while 
trying to dock at the Chevron refinery at Richmond, narrowly missing a major 
crude oil pipeline. Chevron port superintendent Charlie Adam told the San 
Francisco Chronicle that "50 feet this way (and) it'd have been a total 
disaster." The incident, which occurred three weeks after the Exxon Valdez ran 
aground in Alaska's Prince William Sound, spilling nearly 11 million gallons of 
oil, is under investigation by the state Board of Pilot Commissioners and the 
Coast Guard. Maritime Overseas Corp. of New York, which operates the Overseas 
Juneau, declined comment.

2 FULLERTON SLAYINGS PROMPT NATIONWIDE ALERT OVER SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE EMMONS and LONN JOHNSTON, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fullerton police issued a nationwide alert Tuesday for a suspect they believe 
killed his former girlfriend and a man in her apartment. 
</P>
<P>
At first police feared that the suspect had kidnaped the woman's 4-year-old 
son. But the boy was found about 16 hours later in the care of his uncle, who 
had been baby-sitting the child since Sunday afternoon, said Sgt. Tony 
Hernandez of the Fullerton Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Police identified the suspect as Dan Van Nguyen, 35, who once lived with the 
dead woman and had been her business partner in an Orange County beauty parlor 
before he moved to San Antonio, Tex., last September. 
</P>
<P>
In San Antonio, a reporter said he had received telephone calls from a woman 
apparently related to Nguyen, who said that the suspect had telephoned her 
several times since the killing. In at least one subsequent call, Nguyen 
threatened to kill himself, said the reporter, Jerome Kurry of the San Antonio 
Express-News. 
</P>
<P>
Police identified the victims as Trinh Tuyet Duong, 28, who lived in Apartment 
5 at 3946 W. Franklin Ave., Fullerton, where the slayings occurred, and Lewis 
Long Vu, 34, of Bellflower, who neighbors said had moved into Duong's apartment 
about 2 weeks ago. The dead woman's son was identified as Nam Phuong Nguyen. 
Police said the child is not related to the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Police were called to the small apartment complex shortly after midnight by 
apartment manager Antoinette Aguilar, who reported hearing a shot and a woman's 
screams from Duong's apartment. When Aguilar telephoned at 12:19 a.m., more 
shots were being fired, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Another resident, Diane Gayton, 32, said the shots began about 40 minutes after 
Duong and a man returned to the apartment. Gayton said that after the first 
shots, she heard a woman scream "Oh, my God!" and then "Help!" 
</P>
<P>
Alexander Morales, 30, of La Mirada, who was visiting a tenant downstairs from 
Duong's apartment, said that before the shots he heard loud falling noises and 
a woman screaming, as if being beaten. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Aguilar saw a man flee the apartment and recognized him as the 
suspect, who had lived there with Duong previously. 
</P>
<P>
The fleeing man got into the car that Duong usually drove and sped off, police 
said. The car -- a gray, 4-door, 1984 Toyota Cressida with California license 
plate number 2 EQC 571 -- is registered to the suspect, police said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Kurry said he received a telephone call Tuesday morning at the 
Express-News from a woman with a Vietnamese accent who "asked me if I knew 
anything about a killing in Fullerton." 
</P>
<P>
He said that during the call and subsequent telephone conversations with the 
woman, who identified herself only as "Pearl," it became clear that she is a 
relative of the suspect and had received calls from him. 
</P>
<P>
Kurry said that according to Pearl, Nguyen had been upset about his breakup 
with Duong and about the failure of his business in San Antonio, a restaurant 
called King Wah. Pearl said the restaurant had closed its doors for good on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Monday afternoon, Pearl drove Nguyen to an airport for a flight to San 
Francisco, according to Kurry. She described Nguyen as "emotional" and said she 
transported him at his request, Kurry said. 
</P>
<P>
Early Tuesday morning, Nguyen called Pearl and said "I'm going to kill them," 
according to Kurry. The call came shortly after 2 a.m. San Antonio time, Kurry 
said, about the same time that shots were heard at Duong's Fullerton apartment. 
</P>
<P>
In subsequent calls to the Express-News, Pearl said Nguyen had called and 
talked to her husband, saying he was going to kill himself. Later Nguyen asked 
Pearl's husband whether he should return to San Antonio, Kurry said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Nguyen, a former Vietnamese air force pilot, immigrated to the 
United States in 1985. At that time he was married and had two children. His 
fluency in English landed him a job teaching the language to other immigrants. 
</P>
<P>

SUSPECT IDENTIFIES CHILDHOOD FRIEND AS ROBBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Former Harvard University student Jose Razo on Tuesday identified a childhood 
friend as the real Ski Mask Bandit accused of a string of holdups that Razo is 
charged with committing while home in Orange County on break. 
</P>
<P>
Razo's revelation, which came as he took the stand for the second day in an 
attempt to repudiate earlier confessions to the crimes, drew skepticism from 
the trial prosecutor, who said Razo was doing nothing more than "reaching out 
and naming a scapegoat." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Razo testified that a friend from his hometown of La Habra was the 
actual criminal, whom police had dubbed the Ski Mask Bandit. Razo refused to 
name the friend. 
</P>
<P>
But under pressure from Superior Court Judge Jean M. Rheinheimer on Tuesday, 
Razo relented and said the man is named Richard Longoria, is about 27 years old 
and lived on Ashley Circle in La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Ravinder Mehta, said in interviews outside 
of court that such a person exists and that investigators from the Orange 
County district attorney's office are trying to locate him. Mehta said that 
Longoria, if found, may be subpoenaed to testify in Razo's trial, which began 
May 5. 
</P>
<P>
Mehta emphasized that he does not think Longoria was the real bandit in the 
nationally publicized case. "Mr. Razo had to name someone, so he just found a 
scapegoat." 
</P>
<P>
Razo, 22, is the key witness in his own defense. He is charged with 10 armed 
robberies in Orange and Los Angeles counties between December, 1985, and June, 
1987, in which about $27,000 was taken. If convicted of all the counts, the 
former honor student and star football player from Anaheim's Servite High 
School could be sentenced to as much as 21 years in prison, according to Mehta. 
</P>
<P>
Razo told the jury in the Santa Ana courtroom Tuesday that he did not commit 
any of the robberies. He said that Longoria made all the holdups and then told 
him the exact details. Razo said that he was academically interested in the 
crimes because he was taking a course at Harvard in 1986-87 entitled "Crime and 
Human Nature." 
</P>
<P>
According to defense attorney John Barnett, Razo was gathering material in La 
Habra on why a disproportionate percentage of Latinos become criminals. 
</P>
<P>
"The barrio, in a sense, became his laboratory," Barnett said. The attorney 
also said Razo was mentally unstable from recent use of the drug PCP 
(phencyclidine, also known as "angel dust") when he confessed in June, 1987, to 
the robberies. 
</P>
<P>
In cross-examination by Mehta on Tuesday, Razo described details of armed 
robberies by the Ski Mask Bandit. Razo said he had learned the details from 
Longoria, whom he generally referred to only as "the robber." 
</P>
<P>
Mehta asked Razo when he first learned that Longoria was committing armed 
robberies. 
</P>
<P>
Razo said it was in December, 1985, when he was home from Harvard on Christmas 
break. Razo said he was in the back yard of his parents' home on Marian Street 
in La Habra when "this person jumped the fence into the back yard." Razo said 
the person was Longoria and said Longoria later told him that he had just held 
up the nearby Driftwood Dairy and escaped with $50. 
</P>
<P>
Razo testified: "He (the alleged bandit) appeared very nervous. He told me to 
shut up and to help him out." Razo said he then brought the man into his 
family's house. "He took a ski mask and gun out of his pocket and placed them 
behind a chair we have in the living room." 
</P>
<P>
Razo testified that he had been mowing his parents' yard when the alleged 
bandit unexpectedly came to visit. But under further questioning by Mehta, Razo 
conceded that the Driftwood Dairy robbery actually occurred after dark in the 
evening. Mehta said he doubted that Razo was mowing the yard in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you telling the truth?" Mehta asked Razo. "Are you making things up as we 
go along? Why tell us you were doing yard work if you don't remember it?" 
</P>
<P>
Razo, in response, said that he cannot recall some details of his dealings with 
"the robber." 
</P>
<P>
But Razo, under questioning, was able to give the prosecutor very specific 
details of the robberies, noting that he was only repeating information "the 
robber" had told him. 
</P>
<P>
This is how Razo, on the witness stand, described a 1987 holdup of a Carl's Jr. 
restaurant in Garden Grove, of which he is accused: 
</P>
<P>
"He (the robber) entered the store. He entered along with a customer and walked 
so that he was as least visible as possible past the customer into a restroom. 
After which the customer followed, came into the restroom. He (the robber) 
believed this man at the time to be an undercover police officer. 
</P>
<P>
"He became frightened and exited the restroom. He hid under a table near the 
salad bar. Waited there for a period. The customer left. After which he 
approached the female working in the restaurant at the time. He asked her if 
she were the manager. He told her to open the safe and asked for all the money. 
Told the employees to lay on the floor and exited the restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
A former altar boy and model student, Razo became a role model for Latino 
youths in La Habra, community leaders have said. He had just completed his 
sophomore year at Harvard when he was arrested in June, 1987. National news 
media have given wide attention to the case because of the unusual 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Razo on Monday testified that he had used PCP about 50 times in May and June of 
1987 and contended that the drug caused him to have strange thoughts, including 
the compunction to confess to crimes he did not commit. 
</P>
<P>
Mehta, however, said in interviews outside of court that Razo is simply groping 
for a defense. "Mr. Razo was the real robber," the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
Mehta is scheduled to continue cross-examining Razo when the trial resumes this 
morning.

<P>
MAN SPENDS 4 DAYS PINNED UNDER MATTRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 69-year-old Cypress man was in serious condition Tuesday, suffering from 
dehydration and pneumonia after being pinned under a mattress in his home for 4 
days, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Chester Rasmussen, a widower who lived alone, apparently fell out of bed and 
accidently pulled the mattress on top of himself while trying to get up, 
Cypress Police Lt. John Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers were called to the home in the 5300 block of Cumberland Drive on 
Monday by neighbors and a postal carrier who became concerned about Rasmussen's 
well-being when he did not pick up his mail for several days. 
</P>
<P>
Officers forced open the home's front door and found Rasmussen in the bedroom 
pinned between the mattress and a wall, Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
"He had tried to get up using the edge of the mattress as support, and it 
rolled on top of him," Schaefer said. "It appeared he just didn't have the 
strength to pull it off." 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer said Rasmussen was conscious but apparently in shock when officers 
found him. He had apparently been under the mattress since Thursday when he was 
last seen, Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen was taken by paramedics to Los Alamitos Medical Center, then 
transferred to the intensive-care unit at Long Beach Memorial Hospital, 
authorities said.

CHEAPER HOMES TIED TO CONCESSIONS TO BUILDERS; 
</P>
<P>
CONSULTANT ADVISES IRVINE THAT IT MUST OFFER INCENTIVES TO DEVELOPERS FOR 
LOWER-COST HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARCIDA DODSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Increasing the amount of affordable housing in Irvine is possible only if city 
officials are willing to give developers concessions that reduce the costs of 
construction, a consultant told City Council members Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Only with incentives -- such as increasing the density of apartments, waiving 
fees for parks and requiring fewer parking spaces -- can developers afford to 
build the lower-priced housing that Irvine officials say they want, consultant 
Claude Gruen said. 
</P>
<P>
"All we're saying is that mandating affordable housing is not free," said 
Gruen, who is president of a San Francisco economic and sociological research 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Housing Supply Lagging 
</P>
<P>
Irvine must also allow more housing to be built because the insufficient supply 
of houses and apartments is driving prices up, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons rents are so high is that you've got more demand for 
housing than you're allowing to be built," the consultant said. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine City Council is considering a proposal that would require developers 
to price 30% of new housing for low- and moderate-income households. The city 
now requires 10% of its housing to be built for households earning up to 
$56,000 a year. If approved, it will be the highest requirement in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Using a hypothetical 200-unit apartment complex, with 30% of its units set 
aside for low- to moderate-income households, the consultant presented varied 
incentives to reduce a developer's costs. 
</P>
<P>
If no incentives are given, the developer would lose $2.35 million on the 
complex, Gruen said. 
</P>
<P>
However, if park fees are waived, the developer would lose $2.08 million. 
Reducing the parking requirement alone would cut the loss to $2.2 million, and 
combining both incentives would reduce the loss to $1.92 million, according to 
his rounded calculations. 
</P>
<P>
Only by allowing the developer to build more units on the same property -- 
combined with the waived park fees and a reduced parking requirement -- would 
the developer come close to the break-even point, losing $127,000 on the 
project, Gruen said. 
</P>
<P>
The project becomes much more affordable if mortgage rates are dropped to 10% 
or 8%, but federal programs making low-interest loans available for low-cost 
housing have been discontinued, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Linkage' for Employers 
</P>
<P>
The city could also offset the cost of lower-cost housing through "linkage," 
that is, charging commercial and industrial builders a fee to help pay for 
housing employees drawn to the city, Gruen said. 
</P>
<P>
However, unless the city also offers incentives to the residential builders, 
those linkage fees would have to be priced prohibitively high, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Further, Gruen acknowledged that one incentive, the "density bonus" -- that is, 
allowing the builder to construct more units on the same acreage -- could 
backfire. Representatives of the Irvine Co. warned him that higher density can 
translate into lower rents if apartments are seen as less desirable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
There is an ever-growing gap between the number of jobs and housing units in 
Irvine, with its still-growing industrial and office developments, Gruen said. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,760 housing units are built each year, which is 4,065 too few for the 
new employees in the city. Even if 3,600 units are built each year, there will 
still be a 2,225 shortfall, he said. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Gruen said the council should not be discouraged by the data 
he presented. 
</P>
<P>
Council members "should be commended for getting the facts and figures" instead 
of blindly requiring more lower-cost housing "and pretending there is a free 
meal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is expected to vote on the proposed change regarding 
lower-cost housing next month. Councilwoman Sally Anne Sheridan asked Gruen to 
present the council with similar figures based on other requirements of less 
than 30%. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Irvine Co., the city's major housing builder, said he 
believes that the 30% figure is "quite large and excessive" and suggested that 
the city take a more flexible approach. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Michael J. LeBlanc, vice president of entitlement, said he 
prefers the council to adopt a plan that encourages lower-cost housing but 
"doesn't tie it to a specific number." 
</P>
<P>
LeBlanc called the consultant's report helpful in showing the council the 
hidden costs of lower-cost housing. 
</P>
<P>
Current constraints are contributing to higher prices, he said, "and I'm 
hopeful the council sees the necessity to take a closer look at its processes."

PICKETS AT FOUNTAIN VALLEY HOSPITAL SEEK RECOGNITION OF NURSES' UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some 70 nurses picketed peacefully outside Fountain Valley Regional Hospital 
and Medical Center Tuesday, demanding that hospital managers recognize their 
union. 
</P>
<P>
"They have refused to bargain with us," said registered nurse Kathy J. Sackman, 
president of the United Nurses Assns. of California, which represents 500 
nurses and 100 other employees at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
But hospital administrator George M. Rooth vowed that "the hospital, of course, 
will not give in" to tactics like picketing. 
</P>
<P>
Rooth contended that the union election, held in 1987, was invalid because 
"some persons who had not worked for the hospital for months voted." He said he 
would like an impartial third party, a federal court, to decide if the election 
was fair. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "We're not going to negotiate with a group that we don't agree is 
representative of a majority of our employees," Rooth said. He added that 
current management was "easily accessible" as well as "responsive" and he did 
not believe any hospital employee needed a union. 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, the Los Angeles regional office of the National Labor 
Relations Board has ruled against the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, the regional NLRB office decided that the nurses' union had 
narrowly won the election to represent hospital workers, 285 votes to 279. And 
on Feb. 1, the NLRB issued a formal complaint against the hospital, alleging 
that it had failed to meet and bargain in good faith with the nurses' union. 
</P>
<P>
NLRB regional attorney James J. McDermott said the complaint also charged that 
the hospital "unlawfully" changed wages in May, 1988, and moved some employees 
to a new method of payment on Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the complaint said, on Nov. 1 the hospital changed the date for 
employees' annual physicals and evaluations and implemented a two-tier wage 
system without bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the union is the bargaining representative, they can't change terms and 
conditions of employment without negotiating in good faith with the union 
before they do it," McDermott said. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint has been forwarded to the Washington headquarters of the NLRB, 
which is expected to call for briefs in June and then issue a ruling. If the 
full NLRB agrees with the complaint, the hospital must begin negotiations with 
the union or appeal in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
All day Tuesday, nurses in white uniforms picketed at hospital entrances with 
signs that said "Fountain Valley Hospital Is Unfair." They spoke briefly to 
incoming patients and handed out leaflets. The nurses picketed during their 
lunchtimes or 15-minute breaks and then returned to work. 
</P>
<P>
Even Rooth noted that the "ladies and gentlemen" on the picket line were 
"behaving like adults." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's job action constituted "informational picketing," an effort to elicit 
public sympathy for their position, but it was not a strike, said registered 
nurse Chris Majors, president of the nurses' local union and a Fountain Valley 
Hospital employee for 6 years. 
</P>
<P>
Majors said union members want to raise salaries, which start at about $14 an 
hour, but are mainly interested in gaining "a stronger voice" in hospital 
staffing policies. For instance, nurse-to-patient ratios in sub-intensive care 
recently were changed from four patients per nurse to as many as six, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Majors predicted the picketing would continue through Thursday, possibly 
longer.

SECOND RECENT VICTIM; 
</P>
<P>
BODY FOUND IN SURF NEAR CRYSTAL COVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The body of an unidentified man, described as 45 to 55 years of age and bearing 
a USMC tattoo, was discovered washed ashore near Crystal Cove State Park on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The body was found by a jogger around 5:45 a.m. in the surf about midway 
between Crystal Cove and Scotchman's Cove, said Sheriff's Lt. Robert Rivas. 
Authorities determined that the body had been in the water for several days. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are investigating the death as a possible drowning but are awaiting 
the results of an autopsy. Rivas described the man as Caucasian, about 6 feet 
in height, weighing more than 200 pounds, and with short black to grayish hair 
and a dark mustache. He was wearing tennis shoes, blue jeans and a blue 
T-shirt. The tattoo was on the man's upper left arm. 
</P>
<P>
Rivas said that no local drownings have been reported, but strong currents 
could have washed the body ashore from a wide area of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second body discovered in the area in several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's officials also are requesting the public's help in identifying a 
woman whose body was discovered just north of Crystal Cove State Park on May 
14. Preliminary autopsy results indicate that the woman died of strangulation, 
and authorities are investigating the death as a homicide, Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
The body was found alongside Coast Highway, just off the shoulder about 6 a.m., 
and Sheriff's Department officials said the body may have been thrown from a 
passing car. 
</P>
<P>
The woman is described as Caucasian, 25 to 35 years old, 5-foot-2, weighing 148 
pounds, with shoulder-length, bleached-blond hair with darker roots. She was 
wearing a white tank top, a short, red skirt and white tennis shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Four of her top front teeth were missing. Her body also bore indications of 
dental work and extractions, Rivas said. Additionally, the autopsy revealed 
that the woman had a curvature of the spine. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information is asked to contact the Sheriff's Department at (714) 
647-7000.

HON CO. BOWS TO NEIGHBORS IN SCALING BACK TRACT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bowing to protests from residents, Hon Development Co. is scaling back plans to 
build 112 condominiums on an ocean-view ridge in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
Hon Senior Vice President Robert Hezmalhalch said Tuesday that the Laguna Hills 
company has reached a verbal agreement with the county planning staff to revise 
development plans for 56 acres on the northwest corner of Crown Valley Parkway 
and Pacific Island Drive. 
</P>
<P>
He said he could not be specific yet about how severely the development plans 
will be trimmed but said the new plan may propose building substantially fewer 
condominiums or custom-built, detached homes. 
</P>
<P>
The revised plan will be submitted to the county Planning Department within 30 
days. 
</P>
<P>
The revisions, he said, are intended to reduce the amount of dirt to be hauled 
from the site during grading. Neighbors complained that the original plan, 
which would have involved removing 1.2 million cubic yards of dirt, would 
create noise and traffic congestion. The dirt would have been hauled in 80,000 
truckloads over 1 1/2 years on neighborhood roads to other home building sites, 
where it would have been used as construction fill. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Winter, county coastal community planning manager, said company and county 
officials had discussed the possibility of scaling back the project for about a 
week. He said the cut-down proposal was confirmed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
While plans for the proposed residential development are redrafted, Hezmalhalch 
said, the company will continue to seek county approval to begin grading 3 
acres planned for 50,000 square feet of commercial office space, including 
Hon's future corporate headquarters.

TWO YEARS AFTER THE HITTING BOOM, GAME GOES BUST; 
</P>
<P>
HAS A TORTOISE BALL REPLACED RABBIT OF 1987? STATISTICS FOR '89 SAY YES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As recently as two years ago, many people associated with the sport, primarily 
pitchers and former pitchers, contended they could detect a heartbeat in a 
baseball without the benefit of a stethoscope. 
</P>
<P>
Others, St. Louis Cardinal Manager Whitey Herzog among them, said they had 
conducted their own semi-scientific experiments and concluded the 1987 variety 
was infinitely livelier than its predecessor. The weight of circumstantial 
evidence was on their side. 
</P>
<P>
Home runs zoomed to record levels in both major leagues. Batting averages 
flourished. Baseball officials denied any knowledge of tampering and offered 
laboratory results as corroboration. Beleaguered pitchers scoffed at the tests 
and searched through their tool kits for an equalizer. 
</P>
<P>
The era of the so-called rabbit ball lasted one season. Suddenly, mysteriously, 
the life force seeped out of the spheroid in 1988. Either that or players 
unlearned everything they knew about hitting. Home run totals plunged 
dramatically. Batting averages slipped to their lowest levels of the decade. 
The pendulum swung, violently. 
</P>
<P>
After such a correction in the balance of the game, it was expected that 
offense would demonstrate minor gains in 1989. Instead, the market for hitters 
has continued to drop, particularly in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
One theory, perhaps harebrained, holds that, having removed the rabbit from the 
ball after the 1987 season, the doctors of baseball scheduled more surgery 
before this season to implant a tortoise. Or haven't you noticed how much 
slower the sport has become? 
</P>
<P>
Not only are balls not sailing over fences at the meager rate established a 
year ago, they aren't even squirting through the infield with the same 
frequency. The presence of the 1969 Mets at Shea Stadium during the past 
weekend underlined the National League's reduction in output. Those Mets batted 
.242 two decades ago. It remains the lowest average for a pennant winner in 
league history. 
</P>
<P>
The dubious record is in jeopardy. Consider that only four of the 12 National 
League clubs have bettered .242 in the first quarter of this season. At the 
start of play Monday, the division leaders were hitting .243 (Reds) and .231 
(Mets). The entire league was batting .24067. Not since 1908, the midst of the 
dead-ball era, has the National League finished a season with a lower composite 
mark (.23895). 
</P>
<P>
In all, nine National League teams are hitting below last year's standards. The 
San Diego Padres have dipped 14 points, the Chicago Cubs 19 points, the 
defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers 23 points (to a bewildering .225) and 
the once-mighty Mets 25 points. 
</P>
<P>
The only comparable season in recent history was 1968, when the rule of 
pitchers was so absolute -- Don Drysdale had a streak of 58 consecutive 
scoreless innings, Bob Gibson posted a 1.12 earned-run average and the All-Star 
Game was played to a 1-0 decision, the only run scoring without benefit of a 
hit -- that the mound was lowered and the strike zone was pinched as a direct 
result. 
</P>
<P>
Although the falloff in the American League, which has held the upper hand in 
offensive statistics since implementing the designated hitter in 1973, hasn't 
been nearly as precipitous, there has been a major power shortage. 
</P>
<P>
After a record 2,634 home runs in 1987 and 1,901 in 1988, the American League 
currently is on a pace to hit fewer than 1,650 in 1989. Eight of the 14 clubs 
are struggling with lower averages than a year ago. The composite is .25867, 
compared with .25929 in 1988 and .265 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Injuries to stars, notably Jose Canseco, Dave Winfield and George Brett, may 
explain some of the hitting deficiency, but then such standout pitchers as Ted 
Higuera, Frank Viola and Jack Morris have been disabled or ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
Injuries also have plagued National League teams, sidelining Andy Van Slyke, 
Andre Dawson, Willie McGee, Eric Davis and Kirk Gibson among others, but not to 
the extent indicated by early figures. 
</P>
<P>
From a .261 average in 1987, the composite average fell to .24826 in 1988 and 
now .24067. The projected number of home runs in 1989, after years of 1,824 and 
1,279, will fall below 1,200. 
</P>
<P>
So where have all the hitters gone? For some time now, one of the arguments 
against additional expansion in the majors was the thin crop of pitchers. 
Indeed, all clubs have made pitching a priority in their scouting. 
</P>
<P>
But that concern is not reflected in baseball's current state of affairs. Check 
out the California Angels. A year ago, the California staff had one of the 
worst ERAs in the game. With the addition of one veteran (Bert Blyleven) and 
one rookie (Jim Abbott), their 2.67 mark now ranks second only to the Dodgers' 
2.48. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, big-league clubs are desperate to add hitting. The top team average 
in the National League after Sunday's games belonged to St. Louis, at .258. 
Forty years ago, that mark would have exceeded the mark of only two National 
League clubs. Fifty years ago, it would have qualified as the lowest average in 
either league. 
</P>
<P>
Look at this from another vantage point. Because of their deep pitching and the 
absence of a serious challenger in the East, the Mets remain heavy favorites to 
capture a division title, if not to represent the National League in the World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
Yet their .231 average not only puts them well behind their 1969 predecessors, 
honored on Old-timers Day, but also threatens to place them in the select 
company of the 1906 Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
Those Sox set the all-time standard for the lowest average recorded by a league 
champion. They batted exactly .230, eighth in an eight-team league, and only 
two regulars finished above .260. For their efforts in winning a pennant and 
the World Series, in which they batted .198, they were immortalized as the 
"Hitless Wonders."

SPORTCLIMBING MAKES ASCENT IN U.S. DESPITE WALL OF FEARS 
</P>

Rock climbers are always looking for a good crack to exploit. Now they've found 
one that could split their sport right down the middle, maybe for the better. 
</P>
<P>
A new spectator game called sportclimbing made its East Coast debut here last 
weekend, with 106 competitors from as far away as California venturing to this 
Washington suburb to tackle a four-sided, 40-foot-high wall of plywood and 
bolted-on footholds at the Springstone '89 Sportclimbing Competition. 
</P>
<P>
The spectacle that resulted "is like a commercialization of our sport, so to 
speak," said Bob Horan of Boulder, Colo. "The companies love it," he said, 
citing the shoe, climbing-harness, hardware and rope manufacturers who turn up 
to sell gear as competitions such as Springstone spread across the country. The 
shows already are booming in Europe, where they originated, Horan said. 
</P>
<P>
But do traditional U.S. climbers, more accustomed to the rigorous challenges 
and soothing solitude of the mountains, love it, too? 
</P>
<P>
Not Madeleine Carter of Washington, a stalwart in the Potomac Appalachian Trail 
Club's mountaineering section, who wound up second in the women's recreational 
division here after her first assault on a man-made wall. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like spectator sports," she said. "The whole reason I climb is because 
it's an individual, noncompetitive sport. This is just the opposite." 
</P>
<P>
She entered Saturday's competition, along with 15 other women, only because "we 
felt there should be some women in it." But by the time she was 10 feet up the 
wall, "I was having fun," she acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
She and most others among the 400 to 500 on hand Saturday said what they found 
in a jammed parking lot definitely was not mountaineering, where the rewards 
are more aesthetic than athletic. It wasn't even rock-climbing. 
</P>
<P>
"This takes one small aspect of rock-climbing -- gymnastic ability -- and turns 
it into a competition and puts it on stage," said Dan Lewis of Washington. "I'm 
enjoying it, but I wouldn't trade" for the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
His stage on Saturday was a dark blue, home-made monolith of 4-by-4-foot 
plywood sheathing, its slick, vertical surfaces studded with concrete-colored 
holds of dinner-plate size and smaller, arrayed so as to make climbing to the 
top a feat of considerable skill. The routes were so hard that of the elite men 
only one made it to the top, winner John Bercaw of Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike mountaineering up a route of similar difficulty, there was no 
danger. Every climber was hooked to a safety rope from the time he made his 
first step, and when each fell, as almost all did, the descent was quickly 
arrested by a belayer below. 
</P>
<P>
No small comfort. "On a mountain," said Nancy Prichard of Collingswood, N.J., 
who was third in the elite women's category, "you need good judgment, a lot of 
common sense, safety training. Here, you can go out, you know you're not going 
to get hurt, you get a good workout and you can go into town afterwards and 
have a good dinner and a cold one. You know you're not going to end up on a 
ledge all night in a snowstorm." 
</P>
<P>
Sportclimbing came of age in the United States this spring, when a competition 
at Snowbird, Utah, made national network TV. French climbing superstar Patrick 
Edlinger claimed the $3,000 first prize there, and a new TV diversion was born. 
</P>
<P>
The College Park competition, first ever in the East on a man-made wall, was 
the brainstorm of a few PATC types including Stewart Pregnall, who defended the 
concept. 
</P>
<P>
"It provides the perfect outlet for a new direction for our sport," said 
Pregnall. He said setting up a competition for spectators in the wild is nearly 
impossible. Furthermore, "A lot of climbers are doing very unethical things (in 
the wilderness) in order to keep climbing harder and harder routes. They're 
chipping rocks (to make holds), gluing holds on, and it's all to get their 
names in the magazines" for conquering previously unclimbed routes. 
</P>
<P>
With sportclimbing, said Pregnall, you can set harder and harder routes without 
harming anything, and the best climbers can get the recognition they deserve, 
while at the same time demonstrating to others what they're doing. 
</P>
<P>
To many, sportclimbing on artificial walls is the future of rock-climbing, 
especially now that it's been approved as a demonstration sport for the 1992 
Olympics at Barcelona. Jesse Guthrie of Nederland, Colo., said he is aiming for 
the Olympics and will have to all but abandon climbing real stone in order to 
get there. "It's just totally different," he said. "To compete, you're going to 
have to train in the gym," he said, "and train hard."

MAKING A GIANTS CHANGE; 
</P>
<P>
KEVIN MITCHELL FINDS HAPPINESS IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Kevin Mitchell story is a purely heartwarming one -- at first glance. 
</P>
<P>
Kid from the school of hard knocks makes good, mostly because he has got an 
angel, San Francisco Giant Manager Roger Craig, on one shoulder and a saint, 
the grandmother who raised him, on the other. 
</P>
<P>
If only it had been that easy. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, undoubtedly the brightest thing to happen not only to the Giants this 
season, but also to the entire hitting fraternity, is by no means an overnight 
success. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, he is riding an astounding offensive wave, one that washed over the New 
York Mets Sunday with four hits. Included were home run No. 14 and RBI No. 42, 
both major league highs, key contributions to a 10-6 Giant victory. 
</P>
<P>
And everything he is doing looks frighteningly easy. But Mitchell has had to 
fight for this success. And he bears the look of a young man who has met up, 
face-to-face, with the harsher side of realism, on the field and off. 
</P>
<P>
First, Mitchell survived a childhood of gang activity in San Diego. Then came 
two trades. The first broke his heart, the second almost broke his spirit. 
</P>
<P>
The first deal to tear at him was engineered by the team he helped pummel this 
weekend. After the Mets won the 1986 championship with Mitchell as a valuable 
role player, he was traded to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what was going on," Mitchell said. "All I knew is that I wanted 
to play here and I tried my best. This was my second home." 
</P>
<P>
Being a Jack-of-all-trades, playing six positions, which Mitchell did, the Mets 
liked him. But they liked Kevin McReynolds even more. And the price to get him 
included giving San Diego a third baseman. San Diego passed on Howard Johnson 
and chose Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
What should have been a happy, albeit unsolicited, homecoming turned into a 
nightmare. Larry Bowa, then the manager of the Padres, turned out to be a lot 
like the Mets, either unwilling or unable to find a permanent slot for 
Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Mets, Bowa did not go out of his way to make Mitchell feel wanted. 
In one bitter memory, Mitchell recalls going 0 for 4 against Orel Hershiser and 
being told by Bowa he would never face the Dodgers' right-hander again. 
</P>
<P>
He did not until he was traded to the Giants and, in his first encounter 
against Hershiser, Mitchell rocketed an RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
The rocky relationship with San Diego ended almost as soon as it began. On July 
4, 1987, Mitchell was traded with pitchers Dave Dravecky and Craig Lefferts for 
Giants third baseman Chris Brown and pitchers Keith Comstock, Mark Davis and 
Mark Grant. 
</P>
<P>
"That trade was the hardest," Mitchell said. "I want to ask the Padres: Why did 
you trade for me and mess around with me? I was happy. I could have stayed with 
the Mets." 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, both moves were good, even though the painful detour hurt. 
Mitchell acknowledges he would still probably be a role player in New York. And 
the chain reaction took him to San Francisco, to Craig. "When I came over, 
Roger said, 'You're my third baseman and you're in the lineup every day,' " 
Mitchell said. "Roger's the type of manager who could be an angel you'd find in 
a church, to give you that kind of confidence." 
</P>
<P>
That confidence has shown itself in awesome fashion. Mitchell, in 42 games, is 
batting .317. Thirty-two of the cleanup hitter's 51 hits have been for extra 
bases. He has had 15 multihit games, 12 multiple-RBI games. He has driven in at 
least three runs five times. 
</P>
<P>
"When he walks up there, I expect him to get at least a double every time up," 
Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
Even when he is slumping, Craig says he hits the ball hard. Even when he's 
hurt, the 27-year-old left fielder seemingly cannot be stopped. He has not 
taken batting practice in a half-dozen games because of a stretched ligament in 
his right wrist. Yet he is 12 for 23 with three home runs in his last seven 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd probably be in last place without him," Craig said. "He's carried us. He 
and Will (Clark, the league's leading hitter) come to the ballpark every day 
ready to play and their attitude is rubbing off on other guys." 
</P>
<P>
That, in itself, is a heart-warmer. Because Mitchell's background made him an 
easy target for stereotypes. Granted, he's a tough kid -- he had to be, 
something people in baseball still have difficulty comprehending. Such as the 
time the Giants invited the chaplain from nearby San Quentin penitentiary to 
speak at chapel. 
</P>
<P>
"Four or five of Kevin's friends sent their hellos with the chaplain," Giants 
hitting instructor Dusty Baker said incredulously. "Before, I always thought, 
'nah, it could not be that bad.' " 
</P>
<P>
It was, but Mitchell survived. His grandmother, 65-year-old Josie Winfield, saw 
to it. And to this day, she is his guiding light. It was she who suspected his 
headaches and hitting woes last season were related to an eye injury caused by 
a Jay Tibbs pitch in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
She sent him to a specialist this winter. Mitchell now wears contacts. "The 
confidence in myself says this (hitting) is never going to stop," he said. "I 
get that confidence from my grandmother. I play for her, too." 
</P>
<P>
And he fights to prove what he is not. He knows that there were undercurrents 
that he might be a bad influence on Mets players such as Dwight Gooden and 
Darryl Strawberry. He knows the Padres had suspicions, too. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Padres) said playing in my hometown had hurt me, that my friends were a 
bad influence," Mitchell said. "Well, I'm just 500 miles away now, and my 
friends still come to see me." 
</P>
<P>
Baker finds those innuendoes the most incredulous of all. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a clean liver," Baker said. "A guy who came from where he did -- to me, 
he's a role model for all of America."

GREEN MAKES GOOD ON SECOND CHANCE TO HELP TUSTIN UPSET ARTESIA

Tustin High School's Shawn Green made the most of his second chance to make a 
winning impression. Green had a two-out RBI single in the eighth inning Tuesday 
to give the Tillers a 3-2 victory over top-seeded Artesia in a Southern Section 
3-A playoff game at Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth, Green came up with the bases loaded and the score tied, 2-2, but 
bounced out to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
In the seventh, Green, a left-handed hitter, bounced a two-out single over the 
head of third baseman Ray Valencia to score Ryan Relph. Relph opened the inning 
with a single just under the grove of second baseman Ed Castillo. After two 
outs, Relph went to second on a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Erik Lagafuaina then bounced one up the middle that shortstop Marguarito 
Castillo misplayed for an error, leaving runners at first and third and 
bringing Green to the plate. Green's winning hit came off reliever Joel Adamson 
(13-2). Green had also singled to left in his first two at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt really comfortable with him up at the plate," Tustin Coach Vince Brown 
said about Green. "He's a better hitter when he goes that way (toward left 
field). In batting practice he pulls everything, but in games he seems to go 
the other way a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Adamson, who had pitched Artesia to a 4-3 victory in the first round Friday, 
was the Suburban League player of the year. He replaced starter Raul Olivas in 
the sixth after Tustin had tied it, 2-2, on a bases-loaded walk to pinch-hitter 
Mike Gaston. 
</P>
<P>
Monte Jones (11-2) got the victory in relief for unseeded Tustin (20-8), which 
tied with Estancia for the Sea View League championship. 
</P>
<P>
Artesia (23-4) scored single runs in the first and fourth and Jones took over 
for starter Dan Baker to open the fifth. Jones allowed a single to Adamson in 
the seventh but no runs in the final four innings. He had five strikeouts and 
Baker had sixth. Tustin plays Palmdale Friday in the quarterfinal round Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In other 3-A games: 
</P>
<P>
Estancia 9, Corona 7 -- Rob Nye hit a three-run homer with two outs to cap a 
five-run seventh for visiting Estancia (21-6). Mark Hartley reached on an error 
to lead off the seventh and Lance Ely followed with a single. After a groundout 
advanced the runners, Clayton Nelson hit a sacrifice fly to center field to 
score Hartley. Corona shortstop Jason Clark then booted Gary Burrows' ground 
ball, allowing Ely to score. After a walk to Paul McDaniels, Bye hit his home 
run. Javier Hernandez had three hits and two RBIs for Corona (15-8-1). 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills 6, Elsinore 2 -- Chris Sheff homered and tripled for host Laguna 
Hills (24-4). Sheff homered in the first and had an RBI triple in the second. 
Bennett had three hits and an RBI for the Laguna Hills, which plays Kennedy in 
the quarterfinals Friday. Teammates Mike Helm and Jason Thompson had two hits 
and one RBI. Rob Milo (8-0) pitched six innings for the victory. Elsinore ends 
19-9. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy 6, Canyon Country Canyon 4 -- Pete Montera pitched a complete game and 
hit a home run to help Kennedy (22-5). Steve Rath hit a solo home run and Craig 
Roah had two hits, scored three runs, and stole a base for Kennedy.

IRVINE SLAMS TWO HOME RUNS, BEATS SADDLEBACK, 3-0

The Saddleback High School softball team had never seen its freshman pitcher, 
Desi Abrego, give up a home run -- until Tuesday. Then Irvine first baseman 
Cheryl Dunmeyer hit one over center fielder Claudia Rodriguez's head in the 
first inning. 
</P>
<P>
So Saddleback's outfielders moved back. 
</P>
<P>
But not far enough. 
</P>
<P>
In the third, Irvine pitcher Jennifer Brundage sent a towering fly ball over 
Rodriguez's head for another home run in the Vaqueros' 3-0 victory at 
Saddleback in the second round of the Southern Section 3-A softball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros (19-7-1) will play Saugus, a 2-0 winner over Culver City, in the 
quarterfinals Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"Jennifer's home run I think was the critical blow," Irvine Coach Phil Dunmeyer 
said. "They had already backed up after the first home run and she still got it 
past them." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's power at the plate and on the mound was more than Saddleback bargained 
for. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not used to someone tagging (Abrego) that hard," Saddleback Coach 
Yvonne Alonzo said. "I think everybody kind of let down a bit. To see that 
happen to her . . . the whole team kind of went, 'Whoa! Somebody can hit this 
girl.' " 
</P>
<P>
Abrego (19-5) struck out three, gave up five hits and a walk, and the 
Roadrunners committed three errors. Brundage (16-7) pitched a two-hitter, 
striking out 10. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a lot better than we expected," Alonzo said of Brundage. "She has a 
wicked curveball that was getting the kids inside and her riseball was working 
for her today." 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback had runners on base only three times and none advanced beyond second 
as Brundage got excellent support from her defense, which committed only one 
error. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback designated hitter Kim Carstens singled to left in the third with two 
outs, but Rodriguez flied out. Rodriguez singled to center in the sixth and 
stole second with two outs. She, too, was left on base when Leann Larriva 
struck out. 
</P>
<P>
In the seventh, shortstop Nikkanni Andrews reached when Irvine third baseman 
Sam Lutsch dropped a line drive for the Vaqueros' only error. But Irvine 
catcher Lisa Goodwin picked off Andrews at first, and Brundage struck out the 
next two batters to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine scored its final run in the bottom of the fifth. With two outs and 
Brooke Carpenter on first on a fielder's choice, Abrego walked pinch-hitter 
Jennie Matthews. Carrie Caudill then hit a ground ball to Andrews, whose throw 
to third was late, loading the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Erica Koch then singled to center, scoring Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
In other 3-A games: 
</P>
<P>
Montclair 3, El Toro 1 -- Carrie Fredricks had a two-run single with two outs 
in the sixth to give Montclair (23-4) a 2-1 lead at El Toro. Winning pitcher 
Martha Vargas allowed five hits and struck out four. Jennifer Jourdan (5-6) 
also pitched a five-hitter, striking out seven, but took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente 3, West Torrance 2 -- Tara Rouse had an RBI double with no outs in 
the fifth for San Clemente (13-12). Rouse (11-7) pitched a four-hitter, 
striking out 10, for the victory. She also hit a solo home run in the first.

<P>
Buena Park High School's badminton team earned its seventh Southern Section 
finals berth in nine years Tuesday by scoring a 14-5 victory over Alhambra in 
the 4-A semifinals at Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
The Coyotes (19-0) were ahead, 2-1, after mixed doubles play, then won all 
eight of their singles matches and all four of their girls' doubles matches to 
seal the victory. Alhambra is 16-2. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park (19-0), which won 3-A championships in 1982 and 1983 before moving 
to 4-A in 1984, will play Nogales in Thursday's 4-A final at Walnut High at 6 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Noy Sundara (35-1), Buena Park's top girls' player, was particularly impressive 
as she used a series of deftly placed shots to defeat Christine Chuang, 11-5, 
12-10, and Teresa Truong, 11-0, 11-2. She also teamed with Chulki Song, the 
Coyotes' leading boys' player, to defeat Johnson Liu and Chuang in mixed 
doubles play, 15-6, 3-15, 15-7. 
</P>
<P>
Song (33-1) also was impressive in singles play. In his first singles match, he 
fought off a strong challenge from Arcadia's Tom Kao to score a 15-9, 18-14 
victory. Later, he defeated James Chiang, 15-2, 15-1. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park also got two singles victories each from Tam Le and Ekachai 
Sriphakdee. Le defeated Chuang, 12-11, 11-4, and Truong, 11-6, 11-4, in girls' 
singles matches, while Sriphakdee defeated Kao, 15-10, 15-4, and Chiang, 15-9, 
15-10, in boys' singles play. 
</P>
<P>
Sriphakdee also teamed with Da Sundara, Noy's cousin, to defeat Chiang and Mang 
Lam in mixed doubles competition, 8-15, 17-16, 15-10. 
</P>
<P>
In girls' doubles play, sisters Da and Dewee Sundara defeated Diana Truong and 
Mang Lam, 15-13, 15-2, and Rosa Hu and Kim Chau, 15-8, 15-8, while Eva Phan and 
Sandy Chun defeated Truong and Lam, 15-11, 15-2, and Hu and Chau, 17-15, 15-7.

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTES; 
</P>
<P>
FORMER FAIRFAX PLAYER WILL JOIN TITANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
J.D. Green, a 6-foot-6 guard-forward who played on the Fairfax High School 
basketball team that included Sean Higgins and Chris Mills, said Tuesday he 
will transfer to Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Green graduated from Fairfax in 1987, and has played at Southern Methodist the 
past two seasons. He started six games last season and averaged six points and 
three rebounds a game for SMU, which posted a 13-16 record. He decided to leave 
SMU to play closer to home, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it was just a little bit too far away," Green said. "I was kind of 
homesick. I'd been there two years and it wasn't what I wanted it to be." 
</P>
<P>
Under National Collegiate Athletic Assn. transfer rules, Green will be required 
to sit out next season. He will become eligible for the 1990-91 season. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always thought J.D. was a fine player," Fullerton Coach John Sneed said. 
"He was heavily recruited off that Fairfax High team. We lose Cedric Ceballos 
and Mark Hill after next year, and J.D. should be a great wing player and 
scorer for us." 
</P>
<P>
Green said he chose Fullerton because he likes the Big West Conference, the 
Titans' running-game style and because he knows several Titan players. 
</P>
<P>
Three former Fullerton football players who were not taken in the professional 
draft have signed contracts with National Football League teams. The three are 
punter Jim Sirois (Houston Oilers), offensive lineman Matt Fitts (Minnesota 
Vikings) and cornerback James Howard (Cincinnati Bengals). 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback Tony Williams and receiver Wade Lockett have signed with Ottawa of 
the Canadian Football League. 
</P>
<P>
Rod Gatlin, former El Toro High quarterback, said he is leaving Fullerton and 
transferring to Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy said Gatlin was dropped from the team during the 
1988 season for failing to follow team study hall rules. Gatlin passed for 945 
yards in his senior season at El Toro, and had played sparingly as a receiver 
at Fullerton. ROBYN NORWOOD

K mart Sales Down: K mart Corp.'s May sales are falling behind the company's 
expectations, but the Troy, Mich.-based retailer said it still hopes to meet 
its 1989 sales targets. At a news conference following K mart's annual 
shareholders' meeting, Chairman Joseph Antonini said sales this month are 
behind K mart's goal of 3.5% growth. The soft May sales come on top of a 
disappointing first quarter in which K mart's net income fell 22% to $94.1 
million from $120.8 million in the same period last year.

INVESTOR ALAN PARSOW NOW OWNS 8.3% OF COMARCO, MAY SEEK PLACE ON BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Nebraska investor who specializes in underpriced stocks now owns 8.3% of 
Comarco Inc. in Anaheim and may try to place a representative on the company's 
board of directors, according to a filing Tuesday with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Parsow, a full-time investor who has made millions buying stock in 
companies he says are undervalued, has owned stock in Comarco for several 
years. He usually invests only in companies that he thinks are already 
well-managed, according to analysts. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to Alan this morning," said Harry Young, Comarco's president and CEO. 
"His intention is to make suggestions to management to try and increase our 
shareholder value and to try and do that in a friendly manner. There is nothing 
hostile in his intent or his actions." 
</P>
<P>
Parsow's purchases of an additional 14,000 shares of Comarco stock over the 
past few weeks represent only 0.3% of the 4.6 million shares of common stock 
outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Comarco is a defense contractor that supplies engineering and technical 
services to various branches of the military and to government agencies. The 
company also builds the solar-powered cellular telephones installed in 
emergency call boxes alongside some of Southern California's freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Comarco's performance has been rather dismal in recent years but analysts say 
the company is making a comeback. For the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 1989, 
Comarco reported revenue of $88.6 million, up nearly 17% from 1988. Net income 
was $6.1 million, contrasted with a loss of $12.9 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The company's stock has not enjoyed the same kind of recovery. While it traded 
for as much as $11.75 in January, 1987, Comarco common stock closed Monday at 
$2.88. News of Parsow's investment was not released until after the markets 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
Even though its annual revenue is almost $90 million, Comarco's total market 
capitalization -- the current value of its common stock outstanding -- is a 
paltry $13.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been surprised it's taken someone so long to recognize what Comarco is -- 
an incredibly cheap stock," said Robert Hanisee, an analyst with Seidler Amdec 
Securities in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Parsow could not be reached for comment. He is best known for his investment in 
New York's Irving Bank. The stock soared from $52 to almost $80 a share in 1987 
after the Bank of New York offered to buy a controlling interest in Irving. 
Fortune magazine estimated that the Parsow partnership's portfolio was worth 
$40 million at that time. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Parsow in January joined the board of directors of National 
Lampoon Inc., the humor magazine and film company. Along with actor Tim 
Matheson and television producer David Grodnik, Parsow owns about 20% of the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect that more than anything else, Mr. Parsow is looking at this as an 
investment," said Gerald Griffin, Comarco's chairman. "We are going to have to 
wait a while and see what happens next."

SPECULATION GROWING THAT FED MAY LOWER INTEREST RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The runaway dollar paused for breath Tuesday as the Bush Administration 
reaffirmed its pledge to keep exchange rates steady and speculation emerged 
that the Federal Reserve might soon start to lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
A day after the White House expressed concern that the surging dollar could 
damage U.S. trade prospects, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said 
Washington was committed to working closely with its allies on economic policy 
and exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important that the major industrial democracies of the world 
continue to work to coordinate their economic policies," Baker said. "It's 
really the coordination of those underlying economic policies that's going to 
make a difference in terms of exchange rate stability." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's chief economic adviser, Michael J. Boskin, also sought to end 
speculation that the Administration was willing to tolerate a stronger dollar, 
which reached a 29-month high against the West German mark this week. 
</P>
<P>
"The Administration has not changed its policy," Boskin told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Although a firmer dollar dampens inflationary pressure by making imports 
cheaper, Fed and Treasury officials are worried that progress made in the past 
two years toward closing the U.S. trade gap will grind to a halt if the dollar 
continues to "misbehave," as one senior central banker put it. 
</P>
<P>
Top Administration officials, including the President and Treasury Secretary 
Nicholas F. Brady, have been cajoling Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan to lower 
interest rates virtually since the day the President took office Jan. 20. 
</P>
<P>
But Greenspan resisted and continued to push rates higher until February to 
curb inflation. An Administration official said the seven-member Fed board of 
governors is now more willing to think about easing its tight grip on credit. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Fed's action in draining cash from the banking system this week 
and recent comments by Fed officials suggest that any relaxation in the period 
ahead will be cautious. 
</P>
<P>
"Inflation isn't dead," Fed governor H. Robert Heller said Tuesday. "Inflation 
is still a key factor to be considered in monetary policy-making. You don't 
want to declare victory all too soon," he told the National Economists Club. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doubt About Interest Rates 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to proceed in a prudent fashion," Heller said when asked whether it 
was time to ease monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow governor Wayne Angell, in an interview with the Washington Post 
published Friday, appeared to rule out any easing of interest rates to rein in 
the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the United States and other leading industrial countries should 
launch an aggressive policy to bring down the dollar, Angell said, "I can't 
imagine anything that would be more fraught with potential disaster for the 
world's financial system." 
</P>
<P>
David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, said he 
doubted that the Fed would loosen its grip on credit, especially after 
Tuesday's surprisingly large 2.9% rise in durable goods orders for April. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks that growth has slowed only modestly from last year's 3.9% pace, 
perhaps to the 2.5% to 3.0% range. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe in light of the durable goods orders that they'll want to ease 
unless the dollar skyrockets," Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York believes that 
the Fed has already begun to let interest rates drift lower to prevent the 
increasingly evident slowdown in consumer buying from killing the 6 1/2-year 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"There has to be a real fear on their part of overdoing it and dumping us into 
a recession," Slifer said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the federal funds rate, the overnight lending rate among banks that 
influences the cost of money throughout the economy, is likely to edge down by 
about five basis points, or hundredths of a percent, a week for the next month. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be a very slow, gradual move," Slifer said. 
</P>
<P>
Fed funds averaged 9.75% last week, down from 9.86% the week before and the 
first time in several months that it had dropped below 9.80%.

HAMMOND POSTS $1.1-MILLION LOSS, PLANS TO BUY BACK 13.5% OF STOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hammond Co., a Newport Beach mortgage banking firm, posted a $1.1-million 
loss for its 1989 fiscal year ended March 31, contrasted with a $907,416 profit 
for the previous fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Annual revenue fell 20% to $20.4 million from $25.5 million the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
For its fourth quarter, Hammond lost $885,684, contrasted with earnings of 
$297,491 in the year-earlier quarter. Quarterly revenue fell 33% to $4.1 
million from $6.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company attributed the loss to fewer new loans, lower interest income and a 
$450,000 write-off related to its failed bid last fall to buy Mission Savings 
&amp; Loan in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the company said it plans to make a tender offer in the next few 
weeks for 13.5% of its stock, paying shareholders between $4 and $5 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Reducing the total number of shares outstanding is a well-established method 
for a company to bolster its stock price when it believes the shares are 
undervalued. 
</P>
<P>
The exact figure Hammond will pay for the shares is unknown because the company 
is conducting a so-called Dutch auction, in which shareholders offer their 
stock at prices within the range set by the company. The company then 
accumulates the stock, begining with shares tendered at the lowest bids and 
working up the ladder until it reaches its target number of shares. But it pays 
all shareholders the price per share it took to acquire the last share needed. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas T. Hammond, the company's chairman, owns 32% of the stock and is 
required to sell to the company the same percentage of his shares as the public 
shareholders sell.

SLICK MOMENTS ASIDE, THE PASSION STILL COMES THROUGH WHEN THE 'FIRST LADY' 
SINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What has to be surprising at this stage of Tammy Wynette's career is not that 
the singer's shows are often slick and pat but that just as often a genuine 
life and passion still comes through in her vocals. 
</P>
<P>
If anyone has a right to be burnt out, it is she. Wynette came to her reign as 
the "First Lady of Country Music" only after a life of poverty and hardship. 
Since her first success in 1966, Wynette has churned out 51 albums -- compared 
with, say, Bruce Springsteen, who in a career only 7 years shorter has waxed a 
mere nine LPs. During that time, she has survived producer Billy Sherrill's 
mulchy arrangements, a bottle-torn marriage with George Jones and a 
traumatizing kidnap in 1979, all on top of a full-tilt recording and touring 
schedule.

Portions of her late show at the Crazy Horse Steak House in Santa Ana on Monday 
did have the sheen of a rote Vegas revue, and that city must be having a 
shortage of spangles and sequins after the quantity expended on Wynette's three 
costume changes. But some songs also rang so true it hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by a hot seven-piece band and two backup vocalists, Wynette came on 
stage in a backless blue metal-flake dress and launched into a lackluster "My 
Man (Understands)." She dispatched a medley of her '60s hits, including 
"Apartment 9," "I Don't Want to Play House," "Your Good Girl's Gonna Go Bad," 
"D-I-V-O-R-C-E," and "Singing My Song," so slickly that they could have been 
coated in Crisco. 
</P>
<P>
But while much of her stage patter sounded like a worn script, when Wynette 
announced that a song was special to her, she clearly meant it. When she 
arrived at the first of these, "Til I Can Make It on My Own," the very air in 
the club seemed to change, becoming a charged conduit for the tremendous 
emotion pouring out of the slight singer. 
</P>
<P>
At such times, all the tugging elements that go into Wynette's best lyrics are 
also implicit in her voice: a painful vulnerability backed by spunk and grit, 
compassion and outrage, an independence and a plea that independence won't be 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
Though not noted for feminist manifestos, Wynette's songs express a great 
resilience, expressing an ability to go head-to-head with a man anytime, as 
early as on 1967's "Your Good Girl's Gonna Go Bad." Even that anthem to 
spousely fealty, "Stand by Your Man," posits that it is the woman's part to be 
strong because: "After all, he's just a man." Though she has penned some of the 
most enduring songs in country, when she's caught up in a song, Wynette could 
be singing vowel sounds and still communicate the complex state of womankind. 
</P>
<P>
All Wynette had to say about her voice during Monday's show was, "I may not be 
the best, but I damn sure am the loudest." 
</P>
<P>
That may have been the only quality to come through on several songs. A gospel 
medley was nearly as pat as her '60s package, and the four selections from her 
new "Next To You" album also gave her voice little to hold on to. 
</P>
<P>
That expressive magic did come to the fore again, though, on "When the Grass 
Grows Over Me" (a song penned for ex-husband Jones), on the timeless "Stand by 
Your Man," and on the encore, "Beneath a Painted Sky," a ballad yearning for 
the innocence and surety of childhood.

CINEMA CHAINS HIKE TICKET TARIFF; 
</P>
<P>
PRICE BOOST COMES JUST AS HOLLYWOOD BEGINS RELEASING SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER FILMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Several county movie theaters have raised prices, just days before the kickoff 
of what Hollywood predicts will be a summer of blockbuster films, but admission 
remains below the $7 ticket announced Monday by Mann Theaters in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Mann, which bumped prices today from $6.50 to $7 at Mann's Chinese in Hollywood 
and four other theaters in Westwood, last week increased admission from $6 to 
$6.50 at four Mann screens at Brea Plaza, according to Bob Miller, assistant to 
the chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Both the AMC chain, which operates 24 screens in Orange County, and Century 
Theatres of San Francisco, which operates the Cinedome 8 in Orange, also raised 
prices last week. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County-based Edwards Cinemas -- by far the county's largest movie 
exhibitor, with more than 80 screens here -- is raising general admission from 
$5.50 to $6 at its Newport Center Theaters, starting today. 
</P>
<P>
But Edwards' increases are not chainwide, according to James Edwards Sr., the 
company's board chairman. Two of his other theaters will be increasing 
admission prices from $5.50 to $6, but just for the run of "Indiana Jones and 
the Last Crusade," he said. Some Edwards theaters will be showing the same 
feature for $5.50. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had any recent (chainwide) increases, and we're holding the line," 
Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," the first in a wave of major summer films 
that also includes "Ghostbusters II," "Star Trek V" and "Batman," opens 
nationwide today. 
</P>
<P>
AMC's adult evening admission went to $6.50 at the theaters at MainPlace/Santa 
Ana and to $6 at the Mall of Orange. Mark McDonald, an AMC spokesman, declined 
to disclose previous admission prices or the amount of the increases. All seats 
at the chain's Fashion Square screens in La Habra are $1.50. 
</P>
<P>
Century Theatres' evening adult admission went from $6 to $6.25 Friday at the 
Cinedome, while evening admission for juniors -- ages 13 to 17 -- went from $5 
to $5.25, according to Jack Myhill, the company's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said, evening prices at the company's City shopping center theaters 
in Orange dropped from $1.99 to 99 cents, and prices at the Stadium 6 Drive-Ins 
in Orange have remained the same. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for United Artists Cinemas, which has 27 screens in the county, 
said the company has no plans to raise prices. 
</P>
<P>
The last major price increase in county movie houses was in the fall of 1987, 
when AMC opened its upscale MainPlace complex and a handful of theaters hit the 
$6 ticket mark for the first time in the county.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: ACLU TALKS ABOUT THE PAIN, THEN GOES LIMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Few would dispute that the local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union 
has been a leader in rallying public concern over police brutality. 
</P>
<P>
Love it or hate it, you know where the ACLU stands. In September, the group 
even established a 24-hour telephone hot line for citizens to report brutality 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
But now the ACLU has gone strangely silent about an alleged case of brutality 
involving the way police handled dozens of demonstrators who refused an order 
to walk to the paddy wagon. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is a martial-arts weapon called a nunchaku, which was used to arrest 
anti-abortion protesters at two demonstrations last month outside San Diego 
medical clinics. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU had monitors at both demonstrations. The ACLU in Los Angeles had 
obtained a court order prohibiting Project Rescue protesters from blocking the 
clinics' entrances. 
</P>
<P>
When a news story implied that the ACLU therefore approved of nunchakus, legal 
director Betty Wheeler announced that the group had no position on "pain 
compliance" and was reviewing the question of how much pain can be inflicted on 
people not actively resisting. 
</P>
<P>
ACLU members talked to San Diego Police Chief Bob Burgreen, who said that 
nunchakus were used only when protesters refused to cooperate. Cops could hurt 
their backs by carrying uncooperative arrestees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A nunchaku consists of two pieces of 12-inch plastic connected by 4 inches of 
braided nylon cord. Even a defiant suspect quickly complies when a nunchaku is 
applied to his wrist or arm and given a twist. 
</P>
<P>
A private demonstration of nunchakus was arranged so Wheeler could feel the 
excruciating pinch. The ACLU's Police Practices Committee debated the problem 
at two meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Michael Crowley said the membership was split nearly evenly 
between those who felt the ACLU should always oppose excessive police force and 
those who felt a controlled use of nunchakus is acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
The meetings, he said, erupted into "rancorous debate back and forth, with 
people losing their tempers. I spent most of my time trying to keep the meeting 
under control." 
</P>
<P>
Project Rescue activist Connie Youngkin says the ACLU is silent because the 
nunchakus were used "to clear away people the ACLU wanted cleared away." 
</P>
<P>
"If they were used on a rapist or a bank robber, the ACLU would immediately cry 
foul," Youngkin said. "But they were used on law-abiding citizens who only 
wanted to stop the slaughter of innocent babies. The ACLU doesn't care how 
brutally we're treated." 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler and Crowley say that isn't so. They insist that the fact the nunchakus 
were used on anti-abortion demonstrators is irrelevant to the ACLU's internal 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
"It pains me that we can't come to a consensus about it," Crowley said. He said 
he could not predict when, if ever, the group will reach a decision. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mitigated Murals 
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake: Chairman Mao is not necessarily endorsed by San Diego State 
University. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy over dormitory murals at SDSU is headed toward a compromise. 
The Young Americans for Freedom had objected to wall murals of Mao, Castro, 
Khrushchev, Brezhnev and two Soviet generals. 
</P>
<P>
The administration will install ideological disclaimers near the murals saying 
that the historical figures are open to differing evaluations and that no one 
is trying to indoctrinate the students. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Dog Could Do Worse 
</P>
<P>
Joan Kroc has dropped efforts to locate the owner of a lost dog she found last 
November outside a Rancho Santa Fe restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
No more reward, no more newspaper ads, no more trips to an Escondido woman who 
claims she talks to animals. Boots is now an official member of the Kroc 
family. 
</P>
<P>
Boots knows a good thing when she sees it. "The dog seems very happy in her new 
home," said a Kroc spokeswoman.

<P>
A Santa Ana man was killed Tuesday night in an accident at an intersection in 
Irvine, police said, and a passenger in the van remains hospitalized today. 
</P>
<P>
The name of the 45-year-old man who died was not immediately released pending 
notification of his relatives. Irvine police said the accident happened at 10 
p.m. Tuesday when the driver of the van ran a red light and broadsided a car. 
The van flipped over at MacArthur Boulevard and Michelson Drive. The injured 
passenger was identified as Jose Velasquez, 24, of Santa Ana. He was taken to 
Western Medical Center of Santa Ana with minor head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said the driver of the car that was hit by the van, Israel 
Lopez, 22, of Santa Ana, escaped injury.

AETNA RESUMES SELLING NEW POLICIES IN CALIF.;

AETNA AGAIN SELLS AUTO, HOME, LIABILITY POLICIES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, the ninth largest seller of property and casualty 
insurance in California, announced today that it is resuming sales to new 
customers of all auto, homeowners and commercial liability policies, ending a 
two-week moratorium while it evaluated the state Supreme Court decision 
upholding most of Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
A company spokesman, Jason Wright, said Aetna had concluded from statements 
made May 11 by state Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie that the state 
intends to allow the insurance industry a fair rate of return in California, 
for each line of insurance, in accord with what he said was the tenor of the 
high court's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Our halt in new sales was temporary, while we awaited a substantive statement 
on how the state intended to operate," said Wright from Aetna headquarters in 
Hartford, Conn. "We're more comfortable now." 
</P>
<P>
He said the company is particularly pleased that California will allow a profit 
on each line of insurance in deciding whether to exempt each company from the 
20% rate rollbacks from 1987 levels called for in Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
Aetna will file for an exemption and for continuation of "pretty much" the 
rates it charges now, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
A number of insurance companies have expressed satisfaction at Gillespie's 
decision to allow a profit for each line of insurance held, while a number of 
consumer groups have criticized the decision on grounds that the industry had 
traditionally been willing to sell some lines at a loss in a move to lead 
customers to more profitable lines. 
</P>
<P>
Aetna last year sold $103 million of private passenger auto insurance in 
California.

Gov. George Deukmejian signed two bills today making California the first state 
in the nation to ban the sale of military-style assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican governor's signature ended a bitter fight ignited by the killing 
of five children at a Stockton schoolyard Jan. 17 by Patrick Purdy, a suicidal 
drifter armed with a Chinese-made AK-47. 
</P>
<P>
"These bills are not going to bring back the life of the five beautiful young 
children who died so tragically on the school ground in Stockton," Deukmejian 
said at a Capitol bill-signing news conference. "But we do hope and pray that 
these measures . . . will help our brave and courageous law enforcement 
community in fighting violent crime and saving innocent lives." 
</P>
<P>
Enactment of the bills today was a major defeat for the powerful National Rifle 
Assn., which organized a campaign of letter-writing and phone calls to 
legislators by its more than 500,000 California members. 
</P>
<P>
The NRA has vowed to continue its fight with a lawsuit challenging the 
constitutionality of the ban.

EX-VIETNAMESE ARMY OFFICER COMMITS SUICIDE IN SAN ANTONIO AFTER AGREEING TO 
SURRENDER TO POLICE

A man wanted for double murder in the slayings of his former girlfriend and a 
man in Fullerton shot and killed himself today in the driveway of a friend's 
house in San Antonio, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Van Nguyen, 35, a former second lieutenant in the South Vietnamese air 
force, died instantly after putting a .38-caliber pistol to his right temple 
and pulling the trigger shortly before 4:30 a.m. PDT, said San Antonio Police 
Detective Anton Michalec. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen was wanted by Fullerton police in the deaths of his former girlfriend, 
Trinh Tuyet Duong, 28, and Lewis Long Vu, 34, of Bellflower. They were found in 
Duong's apartment early Tuesday on West Franklin Avenue in Fullerton, both of 
them dead from multiple gunshot wounds. (Story, Part II, Page 1.) 
</P>
<P>
Michalec said Nguyen apparently drove to San Antonio in his car following the 
slayings and went straight to the house of Hieu and Pearl Nguyen, who are not 
related to the suspect but were described as his best friends. 
</P>
<P>
According to Michalec, the suspect admitted that he had killed Duong and Vu. 
The couple managed to talk Nguyen into surrendering to San Antonio police, 
Michalec said. 
</P>
<P>
"He agreed to this and said he was going to turn himself in," Michalec said. 
"He said he was going to get his clothes out of the car, take a shower and wait 
for me. The next thing they know they heard a shot, and he had shot himself." 
</P>
<P>
Michalec said Nguyen was apparently deeply depressed that a restaurant he had 
invested in with the San Antonio couple had gone out of business and that his 
two-year relationship with Duong had also failed. 
</P>
<P>
"He told Hieu that this was the hardest year of his life," the detective said. 
"He was broke, and he lost his girlfriend. There is no simple explanation for 
it, other than a slow mental decline. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a sad end to a story that should not have happened. There is no easy way 
to explain something like this."

A 110-pound bomb went off in the trunk of the car as three bomb disposal

away. Four other policemen, a fireman and four civilians were injured in the 
attack. Officials blamed the ETA (Basque Homeland and Freedom) guerrillas 
fighting for Basque independence for the bomb.

Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, whose affair with an airline stewardess has 
hurt his party in the opinion polls, could marry his girlfriend before next 
month's elections, lawyers said today. 
</P>
<P>
Papandreou, 70, filed a new petition for divorce Tuesday and his American wife, 
Margaret, appeared to agree unconditionally to end their 39-year marriage by 
mutual consent. "I will bring no obstacles in the divorce. The sooner this case 
ends the better," she told reporters after her husband's petition was filed in 
an Athens court. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers said that if Mrs. Papandreou, who has made similar statements before, 
drops her objections the prime minister could marry Dimitra Liani, 34, before 
elections June 18.

Gene Gotti, younger brother of Gambino crime family boss John Gotti, and fellow 
crime soldier John Carneglia were free on bail today after 11 jurors convicted 
them of racketeering and heroin trafficking charges. 
</P>
<P>
The convictions Tuesday night ended seven days of deliberations and the 
longest-running criminal case in the federal court system, stemming from an 
indictment handed up in August, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The anonymous panel announced its verdict in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn 
just four hours after Judge John Bartels dismissed a juror who said he believed 
that he had been threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Two previous trials in the last 18 months ended in mistrials, one because of 
possible jury tampering. 
</P>
<P>
The panel found Gotti, 42, and Carneglia, 44, guilty of all charges against 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Both were convicted of racketeering, possession with intent to distribute 
heroin and conspiracy with intent to distribute heroin. Carneglia also was 
convicted of interstate travel to further the commission of a crime. 
</P>
<P>
Each could be sentenced to up to 50 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Bartels rejected a request by U.S. Atty. Robert LaRusso to jail the defendants 
immediately, allowing them to remain free on bail.

The United States is leading Japan in the worldwide race to bring new 
genetically engineered drugs into the marketplace, the Pharmaceutical 
Manufacturers Assn. said today. 
</P>
<P>
But America could lose its edge if the government refuses to hire more 
reviewers at the Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Patent Office, or if 
Congress fails to vote a pay raise for government scientists, the association 
added. 
</P>
<P>
"Five years ago there were predictions that Japan would overtake us in 
biotechnology by the end of the decade. That has not happened," PMA President 
Gerald Mossinghoff said. 
</P>
<P>
But "we cannot get medicines to doctors and patients as quickly as good science 
permits -- let alone remain competitive with industries in other countries -- 
unless we deal with the widening gap between pay in government and the private 
sector for critical review positions, both in FDA and the Patent Office," he 
said.

Spurred by brisk domestic demand, Japan's production of motor vehicles in April 
hit a monthly record of 1,091,977 units, up 1.4% over a year ago, the Japan 
Automobile Manufacturers' Assn. reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The association said domestic sales grew 6.2% to 569,797 units, a record for 
any April. Exports decreased about 10% because of sluggish demand overseas, 
coupled with the yen's appreciation, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
Introduction in April of a lower sales tax, replacing the higher commodity 
levy, was responsible for brisk sales, association officials said. The uniform 
6% tax on car sales replaced the commodity tax, which had ranged from 18.5% to 
23%.

QUIET DOW REBOUNDS 5.86 IN 'UNEVENTFUL' TRADING

<P>
Stock prices closed slightly higher in moderate, uneventful trading today; 
there was little news to spur investors. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.86 points to close at 2,483.87. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a margin of 6 to 5 on the New York 
Stock Exchange, with 768 issues up, 640 down and 538 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 178.60 million shares, against 187.69 million in 
Tuesday's session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 0.35 to 177.96. 
</P>
<P>
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index finished at 351.00, up 
0.04. 
</P>
<P>
The market opened lower behind weakening bond prices after the Bank of England 
said it would raise its base lending rate from 13% to 14%. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks began to firm slightly after midday, taking a cue from rising bond 
prices, then moved narrowly for the rest of the session. 
</P>
<P>
"The market was pretty uneventful overall," said Eugene Peroni, technical 
analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the market spent most of the day in a consolidation phase, with 
some investors taking profits amid mostly even-keeled buying and selling. 
</P>
<P>
"After the 5% rally of the last couple of weeks, it's natural for the market to 
pause for rest and relaxation," said Dennis Jarrett, technical analyst with 
Kidder, Peabody Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Despite concern on Tuesday that the dollar was rising too fast against Japanese 
and European currencies, many analysts said the market continued to view the 
strengthening U.S. dollar as positive. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar advanced against the Japanese yen as well as against major European 
currencies. 
</P>
<P>
The stocks of potential takeover targets, including Avon, were active. Oil 
stocks and steel and high-tech issues also showed broad-based gains. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bond Prices Fall 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices continued to fall in quiet early trading today, pushing interest 
rates higher. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond, which slipped $2.50 per $1,000 face 
amount on Tuesday, declined by that amount by midday. Its yield, which moves 
inversely to its price, rose to 8.64% from 8.61% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Short-term rates were also higher. 
</P>
<P>
Traders blamed today's decline in bond prices largely on Britain's decision to 
increase interest rates.

BRITAIN HIKES INTEREST TO 14% TO BOLSTER POUND

<P>
Britain raised its interest rates today to defend the battered pound in a move 
that market analysts said could forestall any reduction in U.S. rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Bank of England, the central bank, sought to protect the pound against a 
surging dollar and crack down on one of the highest inflation rates in West 
Europe by lifting its money-market lending rate by 1 percentage point to 14%. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks quickly fell in line with similar rises in their base lending 
rates to 14%. 
</P>
<P>
"The pressures were such that they didn't have much choice," said economist 
Peter Fellner of stockbrokers James Capel, after the government's 10th rates 
rise in a year. 
</P>
<P>
Bond market traders in the United States said the move, if followed by other 
countries, would help reduce pressure on the high-flying dollar and could stop 
any reduction in U.S. rates. 
</P>
<P>
Due partly to the unwanted strength of the dollar, some economists have 
predicted that the Federal Reserve will loosen its yearlong tight grasp on 
rates. A high dollar makes U.S. goods more expensive abroad, making it more 
difficult for the United States to reduce its huge trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Higher rates abroad would serve the same purpose, without increasing U.S. 
inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
British currency and share markets were jittery after the increase, which 
followed a bout of pound-selling on the foreign exchanges because of gloom over 
Britain's 8% annual inflation rate and the dollar's resiliency against repeated 
central bank intervention. 
</P>
<P>
Industrialists warned that output could suffer, while the opposition Labor 
Party said the Thatcher government clearly cannot handle the economy and 
inflation, now at a seven-year high. 
</P>
<P>
"High interest rates run the risk of recession and they make life harder for 
British people and British industry," said Labor spokesman John Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told a meeting of Conservative supporters: "We 
need a period of high interest rates to bring inflation down. And while the 
effects can be uncomfortable, the effects of continued high inflation can be 
much worse."

Facsimile machines need protection from "fax attacks" by junk fax, or 
unsolicited advertisements, witnesses at a House hearing said today. 
</P>
<P>
"With the growth of fax machine numbers has come junk fax, the electronic 
equivalent of junk mail," House telecommunications and finance subcommittee 
chairman Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) said. 
</P>
<P>
He said more than 2 million fax machines are now in American offices, with more 
added each day. 
</P>
<P>
"The fax machine, used properly, can be a boon to business efficiency. 
Unfortunately, the same equipment can also be used to inundate the owners of 
fax machines with voluminous and unsolicited material," John Glynn of the 
Maryland Office of People's Counsel said. 
</P>
<P>
Glynn said the person or business getting an ad by fax has to pay for receiving 
it and for the paper to print it on. 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee is considering legislation that would make it unlawful to send 
unsolicited ads to fax users who notify telephone companies that they do not 
want such ads.

PHIL ESPOSITO IS FIRED BY NEW YORK RANGERS

Phil Esposito was fired today as coach, general manager and vice president of 
the New York Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
Esposito took over as coach with two games left last season when, as general 
manager, he fired Michel Bergeron. 
</P>
<P>
In making the announcement, John Diller, executive vice president of Madison 
Square Garden Sports Group, which owns the NHL team, said, "We announced at the 
end of the season that we would undertake a thorough assessment of the entire 
Ranger organization." 
</P>
<P>
". . . It is our belief that new hockey leadership is necessary at this time in 
order to achieve the goals we have set for this franchise. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision with respect to Phil, who has completed his third season as 
Rangers general manager, was not an easy one. He has made many contributions to 
the franchise both as a player and as a general manager." 
</P>
<P>
After firing Bergeron on April 1 and coaching the Rangers through the last two 
regular-season games, Esposito was behind the bench for four games of a playoff 
against Pittsburgh. The Rangers lost all six of those games. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vote of Confidence 
</P>
<P>
After the sweep by the Penguins, the 47-year-old Esposito was given a vote of 
confidence by the Rangers' hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
Esposito, who completed his 18-year NHL playing career with the Rangers in the 
1980-81 season, first coached the team during the 1986-87 campaign. After 
replacing Ted Sator, Esposito compiled a 24-19 regular-season record before the 
Rangers were beaten in the first round on the playoffs by Philadelphia, four 
games to two. 
</P>
<P>
Diller said that no one had yet been selected to replace Esposito as coach or 
general manager.

PAUL JASPERSON, FIRST TO TEST LAW IN W. HOLLYWOOD BARRING AIDS BIAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Jasperson, an AIDS victim who two years ago sued a West Hollywood nail 
salon that refused him a pedicure, died last week, his attorney said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Allred said her client was 37 and died May 15 in Los Angeles after 
battling acquired immune deficiency syndrome for several years. 
</P>
<P>
Jasperson had filed suit against Jessica's Nail Salon in January, 1987, 
charging violation of a West Hollywood ordinance that prohibits discrimination 
against AIDS victims. Jasperson's case, Allred said, was the first legal test 
of the ordinance in a civil case. Although a court found that the nail salon 
did refuse the pedicure, it refused to issue an injunction barring the business 
from discriminating. 
</P>
<P>
The civil action, which has drawn support from the cities of West Hollywood, 
Los Angeles, Santa Monica and the American Civil Liberties Union, is being 
appealed. A settlement in a separate discrimination action filed by West 
Hollywood was reached in March. 
</P>
<P>
Allred called Jasperson "one of the most courageous people I have ever known" 
who proceeded with the lawsuit "at great risk to his own health . . . in order 
to help to win rights for others." She vowed to pursue the appeal despite his 
death. 
</P>
<P>
Jasperson was a native of Minneapolis who came to West Hollywood in 1975, where 
he became a hair stylist and activist for gay causes. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his parents and two brothers. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service will be held Saturday at 1:30 at the Old North Church, 
Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills.

LYN MURRAY; WROTE SCORES FOR FILMS, TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lyn Murray, a prolific writer of scores for radio, films and television who 
began his Broadway career as choral arranger for Irving Berlin's "This Is the 
Army," died Saturday of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The Emmy Award-winning composer and conductor (for "Miraculous Machines," a 
1986 National Geographic Special), was 79 and died at Cedars-Sinai Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Murray, who attended the Juilliard School and studied with Joseph Schillinger, 
began as a staff conductor, composer and arranger for Philadelphia radio 
stations before joining the CBS network in 1934. That proved to be a 13-year 
relationship in which he did music for such dramatic radio shows as "The 
Adventures of Ellery Queen," "Radio Readers Digest," "March of Time," "The Ford 
Theater" and "26 by (Norman) Corwin." 
</P>
<P>
During the 1930s, '40s and '50s his Lyn Murray Singers were featured on the 
"Hit Parade" show. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Berlin's tribute to soldiering, Murray's other Broadway credits include 
the choral music for "Panama Hattie," "Let's Face It" and "Finian's Rainbow." 
</P>
<P>
His film scores include "The Prowler," "Son of Paleface," "Here Come the 
Girls," "The Bridges at Toko Ri" and "To Catch a Thief." His music was heard on 
such television series as "General Electric Theatre," "Alfred Hitchcock," "Mr. 
Novak," "Dr. Kildare" and many documentaries, particularly "Carl Sandburg's 
Lincoln."

Concert pianist Steven de Groote, a Van Cliburn contest gold medal winner in 
1977, has died in a Johannesburg clinic of tuberculosis of the liver, the 
hospital said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
De Groote was 36 and died Monday at Brenthurst Clinic about 10 hours after 
being transferred to the intensive care unit, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the South African was admitted to the clinic May 8 suffering 
from severe abdominal pains. 
</P>
<P>
De Groote had recorded and played international concerts extensively since 
winning the prestigious Van Cliburn piano competition in Fort Worth in 1977. He 
was named artist-in-residence at Texas Christian University, which plays host 
to the preliminary rounds of the quadrennial competition. 
</P>
<P>
He had returned to his homeland to visit his family and to perform shortly 
before his hospitalization. Concerts last week with the South Africa National 
Symphony Orchestra had to be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
Formerly an associate professor of music at Arizona State University, De Groote 
left South Africa to study in Brussels and with Rudolph Serkin at the Curtis 
Institute of Music in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
De Groote's performing and teaching career was interrupted in 1985 by a 
near-fatal plane crash in Arizona that left him in a body cast for 10 months. 
He gradually resumed his career in the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his father, who conducts the Cape Town University Symphony in 
South Africa, and three brothers, who are also professional musicians.

QUAYLE BOOED BY WEST POINT CADETS; 
</P>
<P>
MENTION OF HIS DUTY IN INDIANA GUARD SETS OFF STUDENTS

<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle, dogged during last year's campaign by suggestions 
that he was a draft dodger, was booed by West Point cadets today as he was 
introduced as commencement speaker. 
</P>
<P>
Ignoring the less-than-hearty welcome and a steady downpour, Quayle praised the 
nation's new second lieutenants -- including 112 women, 156 minority members 
and four foreign students -- who were presented with degrees and officer's bars 
at the U.S. Military Academy's 191st commencement ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
"You are the guardians of peace. While working for peace, we must keep our 
defense strong," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The boos and hisses arose from the corps of cadets, West Point's 
undergraduates, when the vice president was introduced with a mention of his 
Vietnam-era service in the Indiana National Guard. Quayle, 42, did not react. 
</P>
<P>
Questions were raised during last year's presidential campaign about whether 
Quayle's family, influential in newspaper publishing and Indiana political 
circles, pulled strings to get him into the Guard to dodge the draft. 
</P>
<P>
In his commencement address, Quayle praised the graduates who had earned 
academic honors and noted that he had never made the dean's list while in 
college. 
</P>
<P>
He told the cadets -- resplendent in dress gray uniforms, purple sashes and 
white hats -- that "devotion to the profession of the military and to the 
well-being of soldiers is a legacy of West Point and of those leaders in the 
long, gray line that preceded you. 
</P>
<P>
"It is their achievement and their sacrifice that you must never fail to honor, 
and whatever the circumstances, always remember to be proud, very, very proud. 
. . . There is no more noble calling than serving your country." 
</P>
<P>
Quayle drew applause when he announced that former President Ronald Reagan, who 
in 1987 reviewed the corps and granted "amnesty" for all demerits, will receive 
the academy's Thayer Award, which goes to the American who best fulfills West 
Point's motto, "Duty, Honor, Country."

CHINA TROOPS SHOW SUPPORT FOR PREMIER;

OPPOSITION EMERGES IN POLITBURO AS POWER STRUGGLE ESCALATES

<P>
The struggle for China heated up today with official reports of widespread 
military support for Premier Li Peng, whose attempt to crush the pro-democracy 
movement has led to mass demonstrations demanding his ouster. 
</P>
<P>
But the conservative Li faced new opposition within the policy-making Politburo 
Standing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said a Politburo meeting will be called Thursday 
or Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, China informed Western television stations that it was cutting off 
satellite transmissions as of midnight (8 a.m. PDT), ending their ability to 
broadcast from China. 
</P>
<P>
Li declared martial law in Beijing on Saturday, ordering troops to restore 
order in the city, where more than 1 million people have rallied in support of 
a student campaign for a freer China and an end to official corruption. 
</P>
<P>
The student protests have galvanized the nation, inspiring the largest 
spontaneous movement in Communist China's 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sit-In's 12th Day 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers were deployed on Beijing's outskirts today but did not move on tens of 
thousands of student protesters, now on their 12th day of a sit-in at central 
Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, throngs of city residents erected street barricades to 
prevent an army advance, stalling convoys. Hundreds of thousands of protesters 
also took to the streets in dozens of other cities. All reportedly called for 
Li's ouster. 
</P>
<P>
Subway and bus service resumed in Beijing, and traffic appeared near normal 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Although the army's inability to enforce martial law has called into doubt its 
willingness to follow Li's orders, the official New China News Agency said six 
of seven military regions support the decision to call troops to Beijing. Only 
the Beijing military command was not mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
Liberation Army Daily, the military newspaper, today published a letter from 
army headquarters urging soldiers sent to enforce martial law to "fully 
understand the nature of this struggle." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hard Struggle' 
</P>
<P>
The letter said, "The turmoil created by an extremely small number of people 
still has not been quelled. If their scheme succeeds, then the 10 years of hard 
struggle for reform and the work of establishing of modernizing socialism will 
be destroyed in a moment." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, however, more than 100 senior army officers signed a letter seeking 
an end to martial law, suggesting a deep split in the military. 
</P>
<P>
Two government sources said today that Hu Qili, one of five members in the 
policy-making Politburo Standing Committee, had thrown his support to the 
relatively liberal Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, who is battling Li. 
</P>
<P>
Hu is in charge of the state-run press. On Tuesday, some official reports 
criticized Li's attempts to carry out martial law. 
</P>
<P>
Reports have circulated that Zhao -- who had urged conciliation with the 
students -- had offered to resign rather than order troops into Beijing.

ISRAELIS ROUST ARABS IN GET-TOUGH SHOW

In a pre-dawn raid today, Israeli soldiers pounded on doors in this West Bank 
village and took 24 Palestinian suspects away in blindfolds and handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to show the local citizens that we are in control," said 2nd Lt. 
Uziyah, 22, a red-bereted paratrooper. 
</P>
<P>
An American aid worker said soldiers kicked and slapped some detainees. 
</P>
<P>
The raids were aimed partly at West Bank villages that have declared themselves 
"liberated" Palestinian enclaves. More than 30 have been raided since Sunday 
and scores of Palestinians detained in the crackdown to arrest organizers of 
the uprising. 
</P>
<P>
"We shake them up with such raids. . . . They say, 'Hey, the Israelis are here, 
and we can't do anything, not even throw a stone,' " said Uziyah, whose full 
name could not be used under army regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the occupied West Bank, soldiers patrolling Bethlehem on foot said 
they were shot at today, but no one was hit. It was the second gun attack on 
Israeli forces in Bethlehem in two days. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a military court in Nablus sentenced five Palestinians to jail in 
connection with a 1988 riot in which a Jewish guard accidentally shot and 
killed a 15-year-old Israeli girl. 
</P>
<P>
It was an emotional issue involving hikers from a Jewish settlement, which 
first claimed that the girl, Tirza Porat, was stoned to death by villagers at 
Beita on the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Israelis shot and killed two Palestinians during the April 6, 1988, incident, 
which began with villagers throwing stones at the hikers. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants confessed and were convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Haled Hassin Abed Benishams, 19, was sentenced to four years in jail for 
forcing the hikers into a violent situation and attempting to stab the guard. 
His three companions were sentenced to terms of 18 months to two years for 
throwing stones and threatening the hikers. 
</P>
<P>
In the Israeli town of Petah Tikvah, municipal officials said they plan to 
build shacks for Arab laborers on the outskirts to discourage them from 
entering the city. 
</P>
<P>
The Petah Tikvah proposal is the latest in a series of restrictions against 
Palestinian laborers in Israeli towns. Also in recent weeks, Israelis have 
begun stoning Arab workers, killing one and injuring scores.

FRENCH WAR CRIMINAL ARRESTED AT MONASTERY

<P>
France's most wanted war criminal, Paul Touvier, was arrested today after 45 
years on the run, and church sources said the building where he was seized 
belonged to excommunicated traditionalist Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre. 
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said Touvier, leader of the militia that collaborated with 
Nazi Germany in the southeastern French city of Lyon during World War II, was 
arrested on the grounds of a monastery near the southern city of Nice. 
</P>
<P>
French radio said Touvier, 74, had been sheltered by French religious 
authorities since the end of the war. He was flown to Paris immediately after 
his arrest for interrogation by an investigating magistrate. 
</P>
<P>
Senior sources in France's Roman Catholic Church later told Reuters that the 
priory where Touvier was arrested belonged to Lefebvre. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said the municipality of Nice had given the Priory of 
Saint-Francois in central Nice to the Saint Pius X Fraternity, Lefebvre's 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
Touvier headed the militia that helped occupying German forces track down 
resistance fighters. He is believed to have worked closely with Gestapo chief 
Klaus Barbie, jailed for life in France in 1987 for war crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Touvier was twice sentenced to death in absentia but finally pardoned by the 
late President Georges Pompidou in 1972, although resistance movements later 
brought charges against him of crimes against humanity. 
</P>
<P>
A French newspaper carried the announcement of his death in 1984, but police 
always suspected that Touvier was still alive. 
</P>
<P>
Touvier joined the Vichy regime that collaborated with Nazi Germany during the 
war, and was quickly promoted to head the police force of Lyon, a center of the 
French resistance. 
</P>
<P>
Historian Henri Amouroux told French radio: "The resistance movement accuses 
the church and its hierarchy of protecting Touvier, and I believe that is true. 
</P>
<P>
"Touvier's trial will reawaken many painful moments from the war and also drag 
the church into having to give an embarrassing explanation of why it protected 
him," Amouroux added.
