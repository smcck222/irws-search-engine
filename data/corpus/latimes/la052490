Former American University President Richard E. Berendzen pleaded guilty to two 
misdemeanor charges of making obscene telephone calls from his office. 
</P>
<P>
His lawyer told a Fairfax, Va., court the educator deeply regretted his 
actions. His psychiatrist released a statement that said the 51-year-old 
Berendzen had been sexually abused as a youngster. Fairfax County Judge J. 
Conrad Waters Jr. sentenced Berendzen to 30 days in jail on each charge. He 
suspended all of the jail time, provided the educator stays out of trouble for 
one year and continues treatment.

<P>
Cmdr. John Cochrane -- commanding officer of the destroyer Kinkaid that crashed 
into a merchant ship in the Strait of Malacca of the Malay Peninsula, killing a 
sailor and injuring 17 others -- was found not guilty of criminal negligence. 
</P>
<P>
Cochrane, the first Navy skipper to face a courts-martial for a collision in 
more than a decade, was acquitted after the eight-day proceeding because the 
Navy prosecutor failed to prove "beyond a reasonable doubt" that the San 
Diego-based officer was criminally liable for what occurred aboard his ship 
last November, said Capt. Richard Reed, a South West Judicial Circuit military 
judge. "Obviously, I feel a great deal of relief," said Cochrane, 44. "I was 
exonerated, which shows military justice works. . . ."

Four suspects arrested in the murders of four people found in a dilapidated 
duplex containing drug paraphernalia are members of a white supremacist group, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"The common thread we're finding is they all belonged to what appears to be a 
self-proclaimed white supremacist-type group," Stanislaus County Sheriff's Lt. 
Richard Breshears said. "There doesn't appear to be any racial overtones in 
this (the four victims were white). The motive is really up in the air a 
little." Some of the victims reportedly knew the suspects and apparently were 
specific targets in the slayings, Breshears said. The others might have been 
"at the wrong place at the wrong time," he said.

Gov. George Deukmejian said more than enough voter signatures have been 
collected to qualify his prison labor initiative for the November ballot. In 
part, the proposal would amend the state Constitution to enable convict 
volunteers to work at private enterprise jobs to help pay their board and room 
and make restitution to victims. Organized labor is opposed, contending that 
the measure would provide employers with a "captive labor" force that would 
unfairly compete with free workers for jobs.

AND THE NEXT WORLD CUP CHAMPION WILL BE ARGENTINA, NO . . . BRAZIL, NO . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Italian players have been told to stop smoking, eat lots of pasta and 
abstain from sex. They are allowed the occasional glass of wine, however. 
</P>
<P>
The Brazilians have been told they can bring their wives or girlfriends with 
them and are free to enjoy themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The Germans have been promised $75,000 apiece if they win; the English have 
been promised even more. 
</P>
<P>
The wizards, clairvoyants, astrologers and assorted other seers have consulted 
their charts and crystal balls and have pronounced Argentina the winner. And 
Italy. And Brazil. Clairvoyants like to cover all the bases. 
</P>
<P>
From all of this activity, one thing is clear: It's World Cup time once again. 
</P>
<P>
The opening match of soccer's quadrennial world championship is just two weeks 
away, but soccer fans around the globe have been debating the merits of the 24 
contenders for months. 
</P>
<P>
Will Italy, the host nation and a three-time World Cup winner, be able to reach 
the championship game in Rome on July 8 and capture the title in front of its 
own exuberant fans? 
</P>
<P>
Will Argentina, the defending champion after its victory in Mexico four years 
ago, once again be able to parlay the unique talents of Diego Armando Maradona 
into a third world championship? 
</P>
<P>
Can Brazil, the reigning South American champion and unquestionably the most 
entertaining and popular finalist, recapture the glory of 1970, when it won its 
third World Cup? 
</P>
<P>
Can the Netherlands, the current European champion with stars such as Ruud 
Gullit, Marco Van Basten and Frank Rijkaard in its lineup, finally win the 
trophy that eluded it in the finals of 1974 and 1978? 
</P>
<P>
Or is this West Germany's year? The Germans were runners-up in Spain in 1982, 
and again in Mexico in 1986. Perhaps it is their turn? 
</P>
<P>
These and other questions abound as Italy prepares to stage one of the sporting 
world's great spectacles. There will be a total of 24 teams in 52 matches in 30 
days spread over a dozen Italian cities, beginning in Milan on June 8, when 
Argentina plays Cameroon. Two months before the opener, 2.25-million tickets, 
or 88% of those available, had been sold. In the Los Angeles area, Channel 34 
will televise a majority of the matches. 
</P>
<P>
Among the serious contenders, there are perhaps six nations that have a 
legitimate chance at emerging the winner. In no particular order, they are 
Italy, Argentina, West Germany, Brazil, the Netherlands and England. 
</P>
<P>
Since the first World Cup in Uruguay in 1930, only six countries have won the 
world championship. Uruguay has done so twice, in 1930 and 1950, but its young 
team is considered a longshot at best this time around. 
</P>
<P>
Italy (1934, 1938 and 1982) and Brazil (1958, 1962 and 1970) have each won the 
World Cup three times and both are likely semifinalists this year. Argentina 
(1978 and 1986) and West Germany (1954 and 1974) are two-time winners and they, 
too, are likely to reach the final four in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves the English (winners in 1966) and the Dutch. 
</P>
<P>
England, knocked out by Argentina in the quarterfinals in Mexico four years 
ago, is enjoying a run of success and its star forward, Gary Lineker, is 
rounding into form. Lineker was the tournament's leading goal scorer in 1986, 
but he alone cannot carry the English to victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Dutch have ample talent, but star playmaker Gullit has only recently begun 
training again after a lengthy recuperation following an injury. The 
Netherlands might have peaked when it beat the Soviet Union in 1988 to win the 
European championship. 
</P>
<P>
But if all proceeds according to logic, Italy and Brazil should meet in one 
semifinal in Naples while West Germany and Argentina square off in the other in 
Turin. 
</P>
<P>
The Italians have the huge advantage of playing at home. In the 13 previous 
World Cup tournaments, the home team has won on five occasions. Coach Azeglio 
Vicini has a strong squad of players, including stars Franco Baresi and 
Gianluca Viali, but Italy has had difficulty scoring goals lately. Perhaps a 
new striker will emerge in the World Cup the way Paolo Rossi did in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
If not, the Italians could be embarrassed once they breeze through their weak 
first-round opponents, which include the United States. 
</P>
<P>
No country has won back-to-back World Cup victories since Brazil did so in 
1958-1962, which means that Argentina faces an uphill battle. Also acting 
against Argentina's favor is that only one South American country -- Brazil in 
Sweden in 1958 -- has won the World Cup when it was played in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Countering this, Argentine Coach Carlos Bilardo has Maradona, the world's best 
player in the 1980s, but perhaps now feeling the effect of years of brutal 
tackles and vicious fouls. Maradona's finest hour might have been in Mexico, 
where he lofted the World Cup trophy on high. 
</P>
<P>
The West Germans, under Coach Franz Beckenbauer, bear very close 
watching.Runners-up in the last two tournaments, they have the strength of will 
to make sure they don't fall at the final hurdle for a third time. 
</P>
<P>
Beckenbauer, whose astonishing personal record includes playing on the losing 
West German team in the final of 1966, captaining the winning team in 1974, and 
coaching the runner-up team in 1986, has rising stars in midfielder Thomas 
Hassler and striker Karlheinz Riedle to go with an experienced, veteran lineup. 
The Germans will be tough to beat. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves Brazil, a sentimental favorite ever since Pele first graced the 
World Cup scene as a teen-ager in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
The Brazilians were magnificent in winning the South American championship last 
year, playing skillful attacking soccer and yet defending with equal tenacity 
and power. The team has a galaxy of stars: Romario, (coming off an injury), 
Bebeto, Dunga, Careca, Alemao, Branco. The list is nearly endless. 
</P>
<P>
A championship final featuring the Brazilians and the Dutch would be a classic. 
Any final featuring the Brazilians would be worth watching.

COURT-MARTIAL ACQUITS SKIPPER OF THE KINKAID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cmdr. John Cochrane, commanding officer of the destroyer Kinkaid, which crashed 
into a merchant ship by the Strait of Malacca, was found not guilty of criminal 
negligence Wednesday in a court-martial decision. 
</P>
<P>
Cochrane was acquitted because the Navy prosecutor failed to prove "beyond a 
reasonable doubt" that the San Diego officer was criminally liable for what 
occurred aboard his ship early one morning last November, said Capt. Richard 
Reed, a South West Judicial Circuit military judge. 
</P>
<P>
Cochrane was the first Navy skipper to face a court-martial for a collision in 
more than a decade. He was charged with dereliction of duty and negligently 
endangering his vessel. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I feel a great deal of relief," said Cochrane, 44, a Navy veteran 
of nearly 21 years. "I was exonerated, which shows military justice works as it 
is supposed to." 
</P>
<P>
The Kinkaid, on the wrong side of one of the world's busiest shipping straits, 
crashed into a Panamanian vessel -- killing the Navy navigator, Lt. Sean 
McPhee, 24, and injuring 17 sailors. "We never held the captain responsible for 
the accident," the navigator's mother, Anne McPhee, said in a telephone 
interview from Santa Rosa. "Sean always liked the captain. This was an 
accident. Sean could have been killed on the Los Angeles freeway. Things 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
Reed, before announcing his verdict, pointed out a distinction between criminal 
liability and accountability. 
</P>
<P>
"Since criminal liability, if any, is based on negligence, I have focused my 
attention during this trial on whether or not the conduct of this commanding 
officer, Cmdr. Cochrane, was reasonable in light of his rank, experience and 
customs of the service, safety, and protection of" vessels and crew at sea, 
Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
A key issue, Reed said, was what Cochrane knew and what he should have known 
about the location and running of his vessel. And Reed concluded that 
Cochrane's actions were "reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
After the verdict was announced, a somber yet happy Cochrane turned and 
embraced his wife Suzanne, who sat through each day of the court-martial. 
</P>
<P>
"I did feel bitter for a time," said Suzanne, teary-eyed. "But with two words 
-- not guilty -- all that disappeared. And now I am overjoyed." 
</P>
<P>
Cochrane said he is uncertain about his future. Repeating that he harbors no 
ill feeling toward the Navy for instigating court-martial proceedings against 
him, Cochrane said: "I am not bitter. I love the U.S. Navy." 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Tom Courtney, one of Cochrane's attorneys, said the Navy had assigned 
accountability to Cochrane for the accident by stripping him of his command 
last fall. Had he been found guilty, Cochrane would have faced a maximum 
penalty of two years in the brig, dismissal from the Navy, and forfeiture of 
all future pay -- including his pension. 
</P>
<P>
In closing arguments Wednesday, the Navy prosecutor and defense attorneys 
debated who was ultimately responsible for the crash of the Kinkaid. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Cmdr. Leroy Dickens, the prosecutor, touted the long-held Navy doctrine 
that a captain is accountable for his ship and crew, and said Cochrane's poor 
leadership and inadequate training of his crew led to the crash. 
</P>
<P>
During the eight-day proceeding, Dickens called more than 20 witnesses who 
testified that the ship's crew members had little idea where they were before 
the vessel crashed; some men on watch were ill-qualified; only three of the 
ship's 13 binoculars were fully functioning, and the combat information center 
had six instead of 12 sailors manning it. 
</P>
<P>
But defense attorneys maintained that a captain must rely on his crew in 
running his ship. And, should his men ignore crucial orders, such as informing 
the skipper of close-passing ships, then the captain cannot be held criminally 
negligent. 
</P>
<P>
Saying that Cochrane did not shirk his responsibility for the Kinkaid, Smith 
said the skipper could not be criminally liable for events occurring that he 
knew nothing about. 
</P>
<P>
"He trusted his officers to do their duty and to obey his orders," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred because the duty officer failed to obey orders to contact 
the sleeping Cochrane when he sighted lights, became confused about his 
location or spotted close-passing ships, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The duty officer's failure, however, was compounded by the error of the 
navigator, who miscalculated the Kinkaid's position and time that it would 
enter the Strait of Malacca, said Smith. The failures of the navigator, whom 
Cochrane considered one of his best officers, and the duty officer were 
"monumental, unpredictable, and inexplicable," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
"A commanding officer cannot do everything. He trains. He monitors. He leads," 
Smith said. "Ultimately, he must rely on officers and men to do their jobs." 
</P>
<P>
After more than a week of testimony, much of which painted the Kinkaid and its 
crew as a Navy version of Keystone Cops, the decision to acquit Cochrane seemed 
to surprise few military experts but shocked many local officers. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision doesn't change the standards of accountability one whit," said 
Cmdr. Danny Barrett, a senior prosecutor who observed the proceedings. "In this 
case, the facts did not justify criminal liability." 
</P>
<P>
Cochrane testified Tuesday that he suffered a memory loss after the collision 
and provided an erroneous account of the accident to an investigating admiral. 
Cochrane testified he had forgotten that the ship's navigator had told him they 
would reach the strait at 10 a.m. -- not 5 a.m., as he had told investigators. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of this conversation with the navigator, Cochrane said, he had not 
ordered the appropriate procedures for entering the straits. 
</P>
<P>
A neuropsychologist -- Lt. Cmdr. David Spaulding -- testified that Cochrane's 
memory lapse could be attributed to the post-traumatic stress he had suffered 
in the month after the collision. 
</P>
<P>
"I sure as heck wouldn't want to work for him in a pressure or battle 
situation," said one senior enlisted man, who asked that his name not be used. 
"Post-traumatic stress syndrome? Give me a break. The only thing Cochrane 
didn't claim was that he did this to impress Jodi Foster." 
</P>
<P>
Still others, however, said the decision reflected careful, deliberate military 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
"It all boils down to whether you believe Cochrane -- and I do," said retired 
Adm. Lee Baggett, a former commander-in-chief of the Atlantic Forces and 
supreme allied commander of the Atlantic Fleet. Baggett once worked with 
Cochrane and testified on his behalf, saying that his actions aboard the 
Kinkaid were "reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
"The point here," Baggett said, "is that command responsibility does not 
necessarily extend to criminal responsibility."

only one alternative for the city to avoid a $2.8-million deficit: reduction of 
city services and massive layoffs across the board. 
</P>
<P>
The $61.7-million budget for 1990-91, which is scheduled for final 
consideration and adoption by the City Council at the end of June, held few 
surprises for city officials. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing here that we didn't already know," City Manager David Mora 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For months, city officials have projected a deficit primarily due to several 
unexpected expenditures, including a $690,000 increase in the cost of the 
workers compensation program and $460,000 to remove asbestos from city 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The two-inch-thick budget released Wednesday, however, makes it clear that 
unless alternative revenues are identified the city will have to impose severe 
budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"The city must, therefore, either begin to permanently phase out currently 
existing service levels . . . or identify and secure new permanent general fund 
resources," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard could retain police, fire, street, park and other city services at their 
current level if voters approve a proposed 5% utility tax increase on the June 
5 ballot. The measure, which the council placed on the ballot to solve the 
city's financial woes, would bring in $5 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
"Without the additional revenue proposed by the utility users' tax, the service 
reductions required this year will not only have to continue, but additional 
reductions will also be required," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid any unpleasant surprises, Mora has said, the budget was drafted under 
the assumption that the tax will not pass. If the tax is approved, the council 
will be able to adjust the budget and retain current service levels. 
</P>
<P>
For the last four years, the city has dipped into its reserve funds to balance 
the budget. But this year, the City Council has said it will not touch the 
reserves, which have dropped to about $4 million from $9 million in the past 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
The reserves were tapped to compensate for a decline in revenues such as drunk 
driving fines, which were diverted to the county in 1987, the early elimination 
of a previous utility tax and reduced franchise taxes paid by Southern 
California Gas Co. 
</P>
<P>
The decision on how to reduce services next year and which positions to cut 
lies with the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be interesting to see what will happen if the tax doesn't pass," said 
Bill Lewis, president of the Oxnard Peace Officers Assn., which is campaigning 
door-to-door to persuade voters to approve the tax. "I'm just glad you and I 
aren't on the City Council." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the utility tax blame the city's financial woes on fiscal 
mismanagement. They predict that a management audit to be completed at the end 
of this month will show how the city has misused its funds. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters say that unless the tax is approved, the city's police and fire 
services would suffer drastic cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The budget report agrees. It includes nine pages of budget cutting options 
totaling $3,649,539 and recommends eliminating 80 full-time jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The largest budget cut included in the list of options would be to the Police 
Department. One of the options includes eliminating 27 positions in the 
department, including a six-officer motorcycle traffic unit, a nine-officer 
field tactical team and one victim assistance specialist. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Nao Takasugi and Councilwoman Ann Johs were out of town Wednesday. 
Council members Manuel Lopez, Dorothy Maron and Geraldine (Gerry) Furr could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The report says revenues from property and sales taxes have increased 
substantially because of a sound national economy and a strong city development 
program. But despite an increase of more than $6 million over last year, the 
city's revenues are insufficient to meet the expected expenditures, the report 
says.

ELECTIONS ASSEMBLY; 
</P>
<P>
WRIGHT USES MAILINGS TO ANSWER BRALY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seeking to deflect potentially wounding charges that she tried to fix her 
daughter's traffic tickets, Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) has 
mailed brochures to local Republicans attacking her GOP primary opponent, Hunt 
Braly, for "shamelessly exploiting a sad family tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
But Wright's pamphlets, mailed this week to more than 40,000 Republicans in the 
37th Assembly District, refrain from any direct mention of the tickets or 
Wright's efforts on behalf of her daughter, who faced jail or loss of her 
license after accumulating 28 citations -- 24 for speeding -- since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The brochures mark the conservative assemblywoman's first public response to 
Braly's repeated charges that she misused her official position by intervening 
with police, judges and state Department of Motor Vehicle officials in an 
effort to help her daughter, Victoria. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury concluded last year after a 
10-week investigation that Wright engaged in a "clear pattern of attempting to 
obtain special treatment" for her daughter and herself from law enforcement 
officials. He said, however, that Wright committed no prosecutable offenses. 
</P>
<P>
In her brochure, Wright, who is facing her toughest primary fight since her 
1980 election, attempts to portray the intervention as a private family matter. 
</P>
<P>
"Politician Braly has shamelessly exploited a sad family tragedy to satisfy his 
own selfish, insensitive political ambitions," the brochure states. "Abandoning 
any regard for the hurt he causes, he has pressed his sensationalist crusade to 
invade our Assemblywoman's family privacy." 
</P>
<P>
Braly said he has "all the sympathy in the world" for Wright's family troubles, 
but they aren't the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is that Cathie Wright doesn't think there's anything wrong with 
going to the home of a judge on a pending legal matter with the other side not 
present," he said. "That is wrong, unethical and improper and her failure to 
understand that is a legitimate campaign issue." 
</P>
<P>
Wright has said that her actions on behalf of her daughter were not unethical 
because she gained nothing material from them. 
</P>
<P>
The five-term assemblywoman's mailer follows two recent brochures by Braly 
challenging Wright's ethics. In one, Braly quoted a poll of members of the 
Legislature, their staffs, capital reporters and lobbyists conducted by 
California Journal, a magazine that reports on state government. The poll 
ranked her 73rd among 79 Assembly members in terms of integrity and 75th in 
overall ability. 
</P>
<P>
Wright characterized Braly's mailer as a "new low for decency" and accused 
Braly of being "opportunistic, exploitive and contemptuous toward normal 
standards of decency and the truth." 
</P>
<P>
She also charged that Braly, 35, engaged in a series of unethical actions, 
including violation of a campaign promise to take a leave of absence from his 
$52,848-a-year job as top aide to state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita) during 
his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"But after many months as a political candidate, Braly didn't take a leave of 
absence until April 15," the brochure contends. "Before then, he still drew a 
taxpayer-paid payroll check." 
</P>
<P>
Braly responded that he went on leave March 5 when he officially declared 
himself a candidate. He took six weeks of paid vacation after that and has 
since gone off the state payroll, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, 61, also said Braly "wants you to believe that he is a longtime 
resident" of the 37th Assembly District -- which includes portions of Los 
Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties -- although he moved into it "only 
months ago." Wright's brochure said he lives in a Santa Clarita condominium 
owned by a "tax-dodging investment firm." 
</P>
<P>
Asked to elaborate, Wright campaign manager Mark Thompson said the firm is a 
corporation owned jointly by Braly, his brother and sister. Thompson said the 
arrangement results in lower taxes for Hunt Braly, a lawyer, because he can 
write off professional services such as legal fees to the corporation. 
</P>
<P>
But Braly said that the firm is a general partnership and that he still pays 
full property and other taxes on the condominium, which he moved into last May. 
He said he performs no professional services for the partnership, and its tax 
returns are prepared by an outside accountant.

TEACHER LIFTS SELF-ESTEEM ALONG WITH SPIRITS BY LAUGHING AT LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your belly aches, your cheeks are red, you are short of breath and just can't 
stop yourself. The man laughs. He rubs his belly, a chubby finger points at 
several words printed on a sheet of paper. You must do as the words command. 
When it's over, he gives you a "high-five" and proclaims: "You've got a good 
laugh!" 
</P>
<P>
You have just finished a laugh drill created by Bob Moss, a UC San Diego 
physical education teacher, lecturer, laugh guru and purveyor of enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
The drill is an a exercise in laughing in several distinct ways. You know: 
har-har, ha-ha, yuk-yuk, ho-ho. . . . And it is one of the techniques Moss uses 
to build self-esteem among students in his classes and at the private seminars 
he frequently hosts. 
</P>
<P>
"Laughter is a creative process," Moss said. "I use it to help students gain 
more confidence. . . . Beginning students cannot always hit a ball, but 
everybody can laugh," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moss, 50, is the kind of man who can easily inspire laughter. He is 6-feet, 
2-inches tall and his weight is "classified." He wears fluorescent pink-frame 
sunglasses and a sweat shirt that stretches over his rotund frame. The sweat 
shirt is imprinted with his motto: "Hubba Jubba 2-U. . . . Enthusiasm, Catch 
It!" 
</P>
<P>
Laughter is serious business, you see. By learning to laugh, students relax, 
learn faster and easier. Improvement builds enthusiasm, which leads to even 
more learning, which leads to high self-esteem, which can lead to -- anything, 
said Moss, who teaches tennis and softball at UCSD. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lifestyle. So regardless of the situation -- a classroom, a speech, on 
the job -- the idea is for them to become more confident," Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
Moss also officiates at high school games and in an informal survey by The 
Times in February he was named as the Biggest Clown by high school basketball 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not all a barrel of laughs, Moss has also made a "mirror box" so that 
his students, particularly those in his tennis class, can actually see 
themselves as they are learning the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Many times people know they fail, but they can't see why they failed. . . . 
The mirrors help them see the mistakes their bodies are making," Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
Another technique Moss uses to get students involved in their sport is a game 
known as "My Name and Claim to Fame," said Emily Ford, a rower and one of Moss' 
independent studies students. 
</P>
<P>
Ford and the other rowers on UCSD's novice women's rowing team played the game 
to prepare themselves for last Saturday's Pacific Coast Rowing Championship. 
(The rowing team finished 6th out of a field of 19.) 
</P>
<P>
"We said our names and then yelled out what our greatest contribution to the 
team in the past year was," Ford said. "We also used a song to energize the 
team. We're all excited now." 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Millenbah, chairman of the Physical Education Department at UCSD, said 
Moss' laughter drills, mirror box, and overall enthusiasm about life help 
students relax so they can concentrate on the tasks at hand. 
</P>
<P>
"Laughter won't hit the tennis ball," Millenbah said. "But he tries to make all 
our students relax and have confidence so they won't be afraid to participate. 
He's a huge guy, but he's also very gentle and caring." 
</P>
<P>
Outside of the sports arena, Moss uses his games, his laughter and other tools 
to inspire positive feelings among the groups he frequently addresses. 
</P>
<P>
One of those was a group of about 20 teen-age girls he met earlier this month, 
students at Sierra Vista High School. The girls are part of the court school 
program and are serving sentences ranging from four months to one year. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a real test of my own confidence," Moss said. "These girls were 
looking at me and saying 'What's this big guy gonna do for me?' " 
</P>
<P>
What he did for the girls was enable them to laugh at themselves more readily, 
said Cherry Stockton, their teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"You never know what kind of long-term effect you have on the girls," Stockton 
said. "I can't say he had a great effect on them because a lot of the changes 
we see in the girls come in small increments." But now, Stockton said, when the 
girls say their names, they seem to say the words with more pride in 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Following Moss' visit, another visitor came to speak to the class, Stockton 
said. "One of the girls walked up to him, shook his hand and introduced 
herself. I knew that was because of Bob's visit. In the past she wasn't very 
confident, but (Moss) gave a bolster to her confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Before leaving, Moss took an instant picture of each girl in what he calls the 
"tah-dum" position, arms outstretched with a big smile. 
</P>
<P>
Moss claims to have taken more than 70,000 pictures of people in that position, 
which he then gives them. He hopes the happy pictures will become part of their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
But Moss' life hasn't always been a bucket of cheer. He began teaching at UCSD 
in 1971 after the disappointment of not making it as a major league umpire. 
Although he had umpired in the minor leagues for three years, and before that 
had officiated at high school games, Moss never received a call from the big 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Moss had dreamed of being the next Emmett Ashford, the first black umpire in 
the major league. But he thinks his outlandish personal style cost him an offer 
to join the majors. 
</P>
<P>
"But, out of negatives, there come positives," Moss said. "If I had become a 
major league umpire, that's all I would have been." Not making it to the major 
leagues gave Moss the chance to teach and to encourage people to be excellent, 
he said.

WOMAN ARRESTED IN DEATH OF ROOMMATE

<P>
A 24-year-old Ventura woman has been arrested on suspicion of voluntary 
manslaughter in the death of her 27-year-old roommate, who allegedly was pushed 
down a flight of stairs. 
</P>
<P>
Valerie Jean Rhodehamel, 24, was being held in lieu of $10,000 bail at the Main 
Jail in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura Police Sgt. Roger Nustad said Rhodehamel and the victim, Mary Elizabeth 
Feeney, had been feuding all day Sunday over Feeney's former boyfriend, who was 
visiting their apartment at 239 Ramona St. 
</P>
<P>
About 9:45 p.m., Rhodehamel tried to prevent Feeney from going downstairs to 
join the man and four other friends, Nustad said. He said a witness told police 
that Rhodehamel apparently changed her mind and pushed Feeney. 
</P>
<P>
Feeney fell about nine feet down the stairs, striking her head and cracking her 
skull, Nustad said. She was taken to the Ventura County Medical Center, where 
she died at 8:15 p.m. Monday said a spokeswoman for the Ventura County 
coroner's office. CAROL WATSON

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: BUENA HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS HONOR STAFF

<P>
The tables were turned Wednesday morning at Buena High School in Ventura as 
members of the student body served up breakfast and awards to the school staff 
during the annual Staff Appreciation Breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100 school employees from custodian to principal shuffled through the 
line in the school cafeteria, waiting for students to dish up scrambled eggs 
and ham. 
</P>
<P>
The students handed out awards to various teachers, and named English and 
journalism teacher Robert Pease teacher of the year. Pease also coaches the 
school's team for the Knowledge Bowl, an annual academic competition among 
county high schools. 
</P>
<P>
The breakfast is an end-of-the-year tradition, said Diane Harriman, English 
teacher and director of student activities. "We have such a great staff, and 
they are generally supportive of student activities," she said. "And this bunch 
of kids is so neat." 
</P>
<P>
Student body President Jon Kirby, 17, said the breakfast is a way for students 
to show appreciation to teachers and staff. 
</P>
<P>
"It's neat because they don't often get honored," he said. "They're more than 
just teachers; they're educators and friends. They don't just come to work and 
then go home, and they don't get paid outstanding amounts of money to do this." 
</P>
<P>
The students organized the event, arriving at school early to prepare the food 
and decorate the cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel lucky this is my home school," Assistant Principal Judy Bysshe said. 
"Throughout the year they are tremendous kids." KAREN McKEAN

AL MARTINEZ: GLOW LITTLE GLOW WORM

<TEXT>
<P>
I was walking down one of the aisles of the L.A. Convention Center the other 
day when a woman thrust something into my hand and said, "Constipation 
problems?" 
</P>
<P>
I can't recall ever having been asked that in public by a stranger, and it took 
me by surprise. Even my best friends don't ask if I have constipation problems. 
</P>
<P>
"No," I said, leaning into her face, "how about you?" 
</P>
<P>
Before she could answer, my wife stepped between us and said pleasantly, "So 
good of you to ask, we'll just be on our way. Come, dear." 
</P>
<P>
"Wait," I said, as Cinelli led me off, "we were discussing our constipation 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
"I know what you were discussing," she said, "and I want you to leave people 
alone. Take notes but don't talk to anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Then she added, "I swear to God, Martinez, if you didn't have a column you'd be 
standing on a street corner somewhere swearing at passing motorists." 
</P>
<P>
We were at the Time of Your Life Expo, which consisted of several hundred 
exhibits aimed at those over 50, into which category I, alas, fall. 
</P>
<P>
The Expo lasted three days and was attended by 46,000 old people with 
constipation problems. The packet handed me was a sample package of a 
bulk-forming laxative. 
</P>
<P>
It was one of many samples distributed. Everything from balloons to sewing 
kits. Old ladies snapped them up like anteaters at a termite hill, while a 
piano played "Glow Little Glow Worm." 
</P>
<P>
Man, I hate that song. 
</P>
<P>
I have mixed feelings about getting old. I was devastated the first time a 
movie theater ticket-taker gave me a senior citizens rate without asking. On 
the other hand, it saved me $3, so I took it. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't have a lot of enthusiasm for anything old," I said to Cinelli as 
we checked out the exhibits at the Time of Your Life Expo. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't worry about it," she said. "You've never had a lot of enthusiasm 
for anything. I can't ever remember seeing you happy." 
</P>
<P>
An exhibitor asked if I would like to be tested for dry mouth. Cinelli answered 
for me. 
</P>
<P>
"No thank you," she said, "his mouth seems sufficiently wet." Then she said to 
me, "See how easy it is to be polite, Little Glow Worm?" 
</P>
<P>
We took a pamphlet that said dry mouth is the hidden cause of gum disease. Dry 
eyes, I learned later, is also a problem of aging. 
</P>
<P>
As you get older, your juices go. It's part of a withering-away process, like 
buckeye trees dying on a hillside. 
</P>
<P>
I counted 21 free, quick-hit medical tests at the Old Dog Expo. I could have 
been screened for stress, cholesterol, glaucoma, cataracts, diabetes, body fat, 
bad posture and fatal baldness, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
"If there were a test for attitudes," Cinelli said, "you'd fail." 
</P>
<P>
A man handed me a booklet of recipes at a Rice For Life exhibit. No doubt for 
those whose sense of taste had been irreparably damaged by dry mouth. Treat 
yourself to a "Souper Rice Supper," it said. Like hell. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll take it," Cinelli said. "He hates rice, soup, sunny days, puppy dogs and 
'Glow Little Glow Worm.' " 
</P>
<P>
There were about 1 million people over 65 living in L.A. County in 1989. That's 
a 10% increase over the preceding year. We are either living longer or 
octogenarians are being shipped in from Miami Beach. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, everyone wants to cash in on what is perceived to be a new and 
growing market. We're talking leisure toys and life-monitoring systems here, 
not running shoes and weights. 
</P>
<P>
Buy a spa, geezer. Buy a vibrating chair, a muscle massager, a pulse regulator, 
a security system, a motor home, a bike, a burial plot, a stun gun and a blood 
pressure kit. Buy a ticket to heaven. 
</P>
<P>
Even Reader's Digest, friend of the emotionally limited, offers a large-type 
edition for those with sight problems. 
</P>
<P>
Now, for instance, you can read "God Bless Irving Berlin," "A Christmas 
Miracle" and "The Dog Who Knew Better" without undue strain on either the eyes 
or the brain. 
</P>
<P>
The Time of Your Life Expo also offered seminars on chair dancing for 
cardiovascular fitness, and Ukranian egg dyeing for those with impaired 
imaginations. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, we were entertained by the Dancin' Grannies, the Huff 'N' Puffs 
and the Pepper Steppers. Really? Yup. 
</P>
<P>
"Terminal cuteness is also a disease of aging," I said to Cinelli. "Maybe I'll 
organize the Writing Whipper Snappers." 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we'll just leave this place and buy you a martini and some pasta so I 
can tolerate you long enough to remember I married you for better or for 
worse."

MEXICAN ENVOY ASKS PROBE OF SLAYING

The death of a young Mexican man at the hands of a San Diego police officer has 
prompted the Mexican government to call for a state investigation into the 
shooting, consul officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Documents found on the dead man helped to identify the victim as Jose Eleazar 
Lopez Ballardo. Consul officials said he was from a small town near Culiacan in 
the Mexican state of Sinaloa. Lopez's family told authorities in Sinaloa that 
the 24-year-old man had emigrated to the United States several years ago, and 
that he was a construction worker, said Lisette Atala, a spokeswoman for the 
Mexican consul in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"The family said he was a good son who sent money home to his family," Atala 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A deputy county coroner said late Wednesday that the coroner's office had not 
received any information from the Mexican Consulate and that the victim was 
still being listed as a "John Doe." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez was shot and killed by Police Officer Thomas K. O'Connell in the 
southbound lanes of Interstate 5, reportedly after he swung a cementing trowel 
at O'Connell. O'Connell had gone to the aid of two California Highway Patrol 
officers as they tried to remove the man from the freeway. The shooting 
occurred just south of the on-ramp to California 52 during the morning rush 
hour. A deputy county coroner said Lopez died of multiple gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Lopez ignored repeated orders to drop the trowel and suddenly 
lunged at the officer with the tool in his hand. O'Connell fired a few shots 
from his 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol, but police said the man kept coming 
at the officer, so he fired more rounds. Lopez was pronounced dead at the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
Nicolas Escalante Barrett, the Mexican consul in Sacramento said he was 
preparing letters to present to the U. S. attorney general and Gov. George 
Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Escalante said the numerous violent incidents involving Mexican citizens in San 
Diego and the border area are cause for concern by the Mexican government. "We 
hope there will be a thorough investigation. . . . We are asking them to look 
at the cause to see if there was any violation of rights," Escalante said. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Cohen, a spokesman for the San Diego Police Department, said he had not 
received any communication from the Mexican Consulate. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be presenting the case without any recommendation to the district 
attorney and the district attorney will make the determination. Just because 
this is a Mexican citizen . . . our standard of investigation will not change. 
We are sensitive to the concerns of everyone in the community." 
</P>
<P>
In 1989 the district attorney's office reviewed 24 cases involving use of force 
by the San Diego Police Department.

<P>
Port Hueneme police on Wednesday arrested a 21-year-old man suspected of 
burglarizing as many as 20 houses in the city's south area over the past two 
weeks, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
John Charles Jacobson of Port Hueneme was being held on six counts of burglary 
after he was arrested while trying to crawl out the back window of his house in 
the 100 block of East C Street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Dale Harbin, who investigates burglary cases for the Port Hueneme 
Police Department, recognized Jacobson from a description given by a woman who 
saw the suspect burglarizing her house, Police Sgt. Dennis Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobson's fingerprints matched those found in six houses that had been 
burglarized of videocassette recorders, jewelry and money, Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
Police obtained a warrant and searched Jacobson's house but did not find any of 
the stolen goods, Fitzgerald said. They believe Jacobson sold the goods 
immediately after stealing them, Fitzgerald said. CAROL WATSON

'HOME CASINO' UNMASKED IN MANHATTAN BEACH RAID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD FARIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Billy Ray Meacham moved into the attractive, baby-blue house on Rowell 
Avenue in Manhattan Beach around April 1, the neighbors thought he was a nice, 
friendly guy. 
</P>
<P>
He told some of them that he and the other men who would be living in the 
leased house were constructing ramps for the Century Freeway and wanted to be 
close to the job. 
</P>
<P>
"We hoped they'd be nice people," said one neighbor, who asked for anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
But when 24 officers from three police agencies raided the house at 3 a.m. last 
Saturday, they didn't find slumbering workmen. Instead, police say, they walked 
into a home-style gambling casino offering poker, blackjack, craps and pool to 
a thirtyish, working-class crowd. Drinks reportedly were sold from a fully 
stocked bar. 
</P>
<P>
Manhattan Beach Police Sgt. Dale Reissig, one of the first officers to enter 
the spacious house, said the raid shocked the 38 people inside who were 
gambling, drinking and nibbling sandwiches against a subdued background of 
stereo music. "There were no happy campers in the bunch" after police arrived, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested four people who were allegedly conducting the operation on 
gambling charges. A fifth person was arrested on suspicion of cocaine 
possession but was not charged, authorities said. The customers were 
interviewed, photographed and released. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery also startled residents of the hilly neighborhood of expensive, 
well-landscaped homes -- including those who had wondered about the parked cars 
and late-night foot traffic to and from the house. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office filed misdemeanor gambling 
charges Tuesday against Meacham, 52, of San Juan Capistrano; William Moritz, 
53, of Los Angeles, the other purported operator of the games; Nanci Nowicki, 
29, of Torrance, an alleged dealer, and Roxane Elliott, 28, of Hawthorne, who 
was allegedly tending bar. Meacham and Moritz were also charged with permitting 
gambling in the house. 
</P>
<P>
According to the clerk of the South Bay Municipal Court in Torrance, Meacham, 
Moritz and Nowicki are free on their own recognizance and will be arraigned 
June 7. Elliott is in custody awaiting a bail hearing, and arraignment has not 
been set. 
</P>
<P>
Reissig said the raid by Manhattan Beach and Torrance police and the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department climaxed a monthlong investigation that 
began with citizen complaints and anonymous tips and included sending 
undercover officers into the house. He said it was the first home casino broken 
up in the city in "eight or nine years." 
</P>
<P>
Reissig said the alleged gaming operation, which went undetected for three 
weeks before the complaints began, tried to appear like "just another party in 
the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Gambling was allegedly conducted Friday and Saturday nights between midnight 
and dawn, becoming busiest after bars closed at 2 a.m. Crowds typically ranged 
from 20 to 35 people. 
</P>
<P>
Customers were solicited by word of mouth in Lennox and Torrance bars, Reissig 
said, and the casino even had a business card advertising unspecified 
after-hours games and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Reissig said there was "no evidence of heavy betting," judging by the $1, $5 
and $10 chips and the confiscation of only $1,000 in cash at the time of the 
raid. "This was a bar crowd, regular folks, working people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the gaming equipment was homemade, police said. The house -- which 
included a converted garage, a swimming pool and a pool house -- was decorated 
with liquor ads, a framed exotic car poster and pictures of women in bikinis. 
Police seized the gaming equipment and a semiautomatic pistol. 
</P>
<P>
Reissig said police were called after neighbors became suspicious when the 
"party" went on weekend after weekend. One resident, who requested anonymity, 
said the local Neighborhood Watch leader lives next door to the alleged casino 
and was angered because noise from the house kept her awake. 
</P>
<P>
The resident said some neighbors thought prostitution was being conducted in 
the house. On Mother's Day, starting at 3 a.m., she said, she counted 35 to 50 
people going to and from the house over a 3 1/2-hour period, including a man 
and a woman who "stood on the walk making out." Parking spilled over into a 
four-block area, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were idiots to do this," she said of the purported gamblers. "People in 
Manhattan Beach are not low-class bimbos. We are aware." 
</P>
<P>
Reissig said the property owner was not involved in the alleged gambling 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
Nahid Bani-Hashemi, a Long Beach resident who with her husband owns the Rowell 
Avenue house, said a reporter's call was the first knowledge she had of the 
alleged gambling operation. She said that on March 26, she leased the house for 
a year at $2,250 a month to Meacham and another man whose name she could not 
recall. "They said they were freeway construction people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
If some people in the neighborhood were suspicious of goings-on at the house, 
many others were not. Les Dergan, who lives around the corner, said his wife 
made a $500,000 offer to buy the Rowell Avenue house before it was rented in 
March. "I assumed musicians lived there," he said.

REDONDO OKS PLANS TO IMPROVE TRAFFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to ease chronic congestion in the 40-year-old streets of Redondo 
Beach, the City Council on Tuesday gave preliminary approval to nearly two 
dozen suggestions for improving the street's major arteries. 
</P>
<P>
The list of improvements, drawn up by a residents' traffic committee with the 
aid of a traffic engineering consultant, ranges from widening Aviation 
Boulevard to installing a long-awaited left-turn signal at Inglewood Avenue and 
Manhattan Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Each was aimed at easing the traffic flow along streets that in recent years 
have been forced to carry many times more vehicles than they were originally 
designed to hold. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations capped the first part of an extensive hearing called by the 
council to address the city's growing traffic problems. Because the agenda was 
too long to be completed Tuesday night, the hearing was continued to next 
Tuesday, when the council will discuss traffic that cuts through North Redondo 
on residential streets to avoid congestion on main roads. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be at 6:30 p.m. at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
City officials noted that all the suggested projects will require further study 
and formal adoption in the city's General Plan, and some will take as long as 
10 years implement. 
</P>
<P>
"No decisions are being made at this point. We're just looking at 
alternatives," said Mayor Brad Parton. 
</P>
<P>
However, Parton added, the list would be a first step in addressing the 
commuter gridlock that has particularly plagued the North Redondo Beach 
neighborhoods on the outskirts of the area's major office parks. 
</P>
<P>
Among the ideas that the council quashed outright was a proposal to remove the 
dips on Inglewood Avenue. Proponents who regularly drive that route claimed it 
would cut wear and tear on cars and ease gridlock on the thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
But City Traffic Engineer Ken Montgomery said the dips, which drain off 
rainwater, also help discourage speeding. Although the project "sounds simple, 
it would require an extensive storm drain system" that would be expensive for 
the city to install, he said. 
</P>
<P>
More feasible, the council decided, were proposals to: 
</P>
<P>
* Redesign traffic signals at Aviation Boulevard and Grant Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
* Widen Aviation between Space Park Drive and Marine Avenue and add a 
northbound right-turn lane to Aviation south of Artesia Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
* Install dual left-turn lanes on westbound Artesia approaching Aviation and on 
both sides of Artesia at Inglewood Avenue and new right-turn lanes at Artesia 
and Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
* Prohibit left turns from Manhattan Beach Boulevard onto Green Lane during the 
morning rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
* Widen Manhattan Beach Boulevard between Aviation and Freeman Boulevards and 
widen the westbound right-turn lane at the Manhattan Beach-Freeman 
intersection. 
</P>
<P>
* Improve the intersection of Manhattan Beach Boulevard and Inglewood Avenue by 
installing a left-turn signal on Inglewood Avenue, widening the east side of 
Inglewood Avenue between that intersection and the San Diego Freeway, banning 
parking on the west side of Inglewood from that intersection to Grant Avenue, 
improving the Inglewood median from that intersection to Mathews Avenue, and 
extending the left-turn lane at eastbound Manhattan Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
* Widen Inglewood Avenue northbound from Vanderbilt Lane to Artesia, and ban 
parking on the east side of Inglewood from Artesia to 171st Street. 
</P>
<P>
* Ban left turns at 182nd Street and southbound Inglewood Avenue during the 
afternoon rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
* Extend the left-turn lanes on eastbound 190th Street west of Hawthorne 
Boulevard and install a dual left-turn lane at westbound 190th Street at Anza 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
* Improve traffic light synchronization citywide.

TRYING TO PUT A PRINCESS BACK ON AN EVEN KEEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
As he surveyed the long, rusty hull of the once-majestic Princess Louise, naval 
architect Alfonso M. Sotres offered a landlubber's explanation for both the 
ship's demise and its troublesome salvaging in shallow waters off San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very old ship," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 1921 cruise ship, which mysteriously sank in minutes last Oct. 30, has 
rested on its side for months in a Terminal Island Shipyard. And as its $1 
million salvaging effort continued late into the evening Wednesday, no one was 
making any promises about when, or if, the 330-foot former floating restaurant 
will be righted. 
</P>
<P>
Salvage crews have been on the job for more than two months and are still 
mindful of past failures to raise the vessel. Early this month, for example, 
they confidently predicted they were within hours of raising the ship only to 
see their plans dashed by miscalculations. So now, no one is talking about 
deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still working. Everything is going well. But we don't know when it will 
happen," said Sotres, the slight, soft-spoken director of the salvaging effort. 
</P>
<P>
Although huge cranes and broad-shouldered workmen stood at the ready, the 
salvaging of the 2,400-ton vessel has still hinged on brains, not brawn, on 
specialized computer models, rather than heave-hos. 
</P>
<P>
"We ran about 100 different models on the computer before we found one that 
should work," said Sotres, who is directing the salvage effort by Trinav 
Shipping Ltd. of Vancouver, Canada. Vancouver is the ship's original home port. 
The salvage operation is being paid for by Southwest Marine, until insurance 
claims are settled. 
</P>
<P>
Several weeks ago, a simple plan to raise the vessel failed, despite the 
computer's analysis, when salvage crews overestimated the ship's seaworthiness. 
That plan called for patching the ship's hull, pumping it free of seawater, and 
relying on the vessel's own buoyancy to eventually bring it upright. 
</P>
<P>
But years of remodeling the ship's ornate interior left its compartments too 
large and too riddled with holes for the plan to work. "The compartments had to 
be watertight and airtight. They were neither," said Sotres. "It was just one 
big compartment underneath with all sorts of windows and staircases." 
</P>
<P>
When that plan failed, Sotres returned to the computer and developed the 
salvaging plan that may finally succeed in raising the vessel at Terminal 241 
of Southwest Marine Inc.'s shipyard. 
</P>
<P>
Using divers to thread the ship's hull with 46 carefully placed steel cables, 
salvage crews secured the vessel to an adjacent barge. Then, using 
high-pressure water pumps to empty both the barge and ship's ballast tanks of 
seawater, crews gradually increased the tension on the cables and simply waited 
for the tides to slowly raise both the barge and vessel. 
</P>
<P>
The process, beginning at 2:20 p.m. on Tuesday, was originally expected to 
right the ship by high tide that evening. But as darkness fell Tuesday, the 
Princess Louise was still sitting on its side, its alignment far from the 
35-degree angle that Sotres calculated would be necessary for the vessel to 
right itself. 
</P>
<P>
About 6:30 a.m. Wednesday, divers returned to the shallow waters of Berth 241 
to secure the cables, and the salvage effort began anew. With glacial progress, 
the ship continued to right itself on Wednesday as anxious crews prepared for 
another long evening. 
</P>
<P>
When and if the ship is again floating upright, plans call for it to be patched 
for towing to waters a mile off the Palos Verdes Peninsula. There, just north 
of the PointVicente lighthouse, salvage crews will sink the vessel so it can be 
used as an artificial reef for fishing and diving. 
</P>
<P>
Patching the vessel, according to Sotres, should take no longer than two days, 
but he is careful to add that earlier deadlines also have come and gone without 
success. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the vessel is ready for towing on Friday, state Fish and Game 
officials, who will take charge of the vessel once it is sunk, said they do not 
want the ship out to sea before next week. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, state officials said, they plan to meet in San Diego with the U.S. 
Navy's SEAL divers. "We're consulting with them to get their assistance in 
opening up the hull of the ship to make it safer for divers. As it is, it needs 
more holes for divers. And we'd like the SEALs to show us how that can be 
done," said Kimberly McKee, a marine biologist with the state Fish and Game 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
The vessel's final voyage, McKee said, also will not take place this weekend. 
"We've already made it clear we do not want it towed this or any other weekend 
when the harbor is crowded with boaters," she said.

MEYER, THE 'MAYOR OF THE VALLEY,' HEADS DOWNTOWN; 
</P>
<P>
CITY HALL: BRADLEY'S LIAISON BECAME AN INSTITUTION DURING HER 17 YEARS IN THE 
JOB. RICHARD ALARCON WILL REPLACE HER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Doris (Dodo) Meyer will be replaced as Mayor Tom Bradley's longtime liaison to 
the San Fernando Valley as part of a shake-up intended to "bring in new blood 
and new energy," said Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer, 65, will be replaced June 1 in the post she has held for 17 years by 
Richard Alarcon, 36, a lifelong Valley resident who called his appointment a 
"symbolic statement that we're not trying to preserve today, but we are looking 
toward tomorrow." Alarcon said Wednesday that he intends to use the position to 
give the Valley's growing ethnic groups fresh access to City Hall. The change 
was announced Tuesday while Bradley was in the Far East on a trade development 
trip. Also announced were changes of liaisons who served as Bradley's primary 
contacts with constituents in Hollywood, South-Central and West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Fabiani downplayed the significance of Alarcon's Latino background but conceded 
"it adds to the mayor's reach. It'll enable him to deal with changes in the 
Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Meyer, who moved from Encino to Santa Monica several years ago, became a 
virtual institution during her tenure and was often referred to as the Mayor of 
the Valley. Her new assignment will be to work on special projects as part of 
the mayor's downtown staff. Among other Valley projects she said she expects to 
continue to pursue will be developing the ArtsPark in the Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer said she was pleased with her new assignment. "It's a new opportunity. 
You can get stale after 17 years even if you are the Mayor of the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, I will be a voice downtown yelling for the Valley. I see the 
changes as advantageous to the Valley. Now it has two voices in the mayor's 
office: Richard in the Valley and me downtown." 
</P>
<P>
Alarcon has been a mid-level analyst in the mayor's Office of Criminal Justice 
Planning for the past three years, working on gangs and graffiti problems. His 
current pay is about $42,000, he said. Alarcon said his new salary had not been 
worked out and that he had "not been fully briefed" by the mayor's office about 
what he would be doing in the new job. Meyer was earning $56,104. 
</P>
<P>
In his new post, Alarcon said he sees a chance to empower minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm talking about access," Alarcon said during an interview Tuesday. "Groups 
complain about it, and some rightfully so, and I want to change that. Certainly 
ethnic groups are among those complaining." 
</P>
<P>
Alarcon said he was unfamiliar with the land-use matters that are the 
meat-and-potato issues of the Valley's western and hillside communities. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not my forte, but if I'm going to be effective I must be brought up to 
speed on these issues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fabiani said Alarcon will be "the mayor's eyes and ears in the Valley. The 
biggest qualification for the job is to be able to get out of the office and 
get in touch with people and let the mayor know what's happening," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Hal Bernson said he will miss Meyer but had little to say about 
Alarcon, whom he battled with in recent years over Bernson's efforts to clean 
up a decrepit complex of apartments in the Bryant-Vanalden area of Northridge 
inhabited by Latino immigrants. At the time, Alarcon was president of the 
Valley chapter of the Mexican American Political Assn., a group critical of 
Bernson's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the mayor's trying to change his image and that's the point of all 
this," Bernson said. "It looks like they've picked a Hispanic because of the 
changing population base." 
</P>
<P>
Aides in other Valley-based council offices said they were surprised by Meyer's 
departure. "She was the Valley," said one aide. 
</P>
<P>
Alarcon lives in Sepulveda with his wife, Corine, an insurance agent. He has 
four children. He has been a city employee for eight years. He worked in the 
mayor's office briefly in the early 1980s, was an analyst in the personnel 
department and moved back to the mayor's Office of Criminal Justice Planning. 
In 1989, he took a leave from his City Hall duties to coordinate the mayor's 
reelection campaign in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In the other job shifts announced by the mayor, South-Central coordinator Tavis 
Smiley will be replaced by Gary Boze, 30. Lily Lee, 25, will succeed Hollywood 
coordinator Lloyd Raikes. West Los Angeles coordinator Valerie Fields will be 
replaced by Bradley deputy press secretary Lydia Shane, 32.

ELECTIONS 37TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT; 
</P>
<P>
WRIGHT RESPONDS TO BRALY'S ATTACKS WITH MAILINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Seeking to deflect potentially wounding charges that she tried to fix her 
daughter's traffic tickets, Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) has 
mailed brochures to local Republicans attacking her GOP primary opponent, Hunt 
Braly, for "shamelessly exploiting a sad family tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
But Wright's pamphlets, mailed this week to more than 40,000 Republicans in the 
37th Assembly District, refrain from any direct mention of the tickets or 
Wright's efforts on behalf of her daughter, who faced jail or loss of her 
license after accumulating 28 citations -- 24 for speeding -- since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The brochures mark the conservative assemblywoman's first public response to 
Braly's repeated charges that she misused her official position by intervening 
with police, judges and state motor vehicle officials in an effort to help her 
daughter, Victoria. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury concluded last year after a 
10-week investigation that Wright engaged in a "clear pattern of attempting to 
obtain special treatment" for her daughter and herself from law enforcement 
officials. He said, however, that Wright committed no prosecutable offenses. 
</P>
<P>
In her brochure, Wright, who is facing her toughest primary fight since her 
1980 election, attempts to portray the intervention as a private family matter. 
</P>
<P>
"Politician Braly has shamelessly exploited a sad family tragedy to satisfy his 
own selfish, insensitive political ambitions," the brochure states. "Abandoning 
any regard for the hurt he causes, he has pressed his sensationalist crusade to 
invade our Assemblywoman's family privacy." 
</P>
<P>
Braly said he has "all the sympathy in the world" for Wright's family troubles, 
but they aren't the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is that Cathie Wright doesn't think there's anything wrong with 
going to the home of a judge on a pending legal matter with the other side not 
present," he said. "That is wrong, unethical and improper and her failure to 
understand that is a legitimate campaign issue." 
</P>
<P>
Wright has said that her actions on behalf of her daughter were not unethical 
because she gained nothing material from them. 
</P>
<P>
The five-term assemblywoman's mailer follows two recent brochures by Braly 
challenging Wright's ethics. In one, Braly quoted a poll of members of the 
Legislature, their staffs, capital reporters and lobbyists conducted by 
California Journal, a magazine that reports on state government. The poll 
ranked her 73rd among 79 Assembly members in terms of integrity and 75th in 
overall ability. 
</P>
<P>
Wright characterized Braly's mailer as a "new low for decency" and accused 
Braly of being "opportunistic, exploitive and contemptuous toward normal 
standards of decency and the truth." 
</P>
<P>
She also charged that Braly, 35, engaged in a series of unethical actions, 
including violation of a campaign promise to take a leave of absence from his 
$52,848-a-year job as top aide to state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita) during 
his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"But after many months as a political candidate, Braly didn't take a leave of 
absence until April 15," the brochure contends. "Before then, he still drew a 
taxpayer-paid payroll check." 
</P>
<P>
Braly responded that he went on leave March 5 when he officially declared 
himself a candidate. He took six weeks of paid vacation after that and has 
since gone off the state payroll, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, 61, also said Braly "wants you to believe that he is a longtime 
resident" of the 37th Assembly District -- which includes portions of Los 
Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties -- although he moved into it "only 
months ago." Wright's brochure said he lives in a Santa Clarita condominium 
owned by a "tax-dodging investment firm." 
</P>
<P>
Asked to elaborate, Wright campaign manager Mark Thompson said the firm is a 
corporation owned jointly by Braly, his brother and sister. Thompson said the 
arrangement results in lower taxes for Hunt Braly, a lawyer, because he can 
write off professional services such as legal fees to the corporation. 
</P>
<P>
But Braly said that the firm is a general partnership and that he still pays 
full property and other taxes on the condominium, which he moved into last May. 
He said he performs no professional services for the partnership, and its tax 
returns are prepared by an outside accountant.

SANTA CLARITA COUNCIL BACKS CONSTRUCTION OF 281 HOUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Clarita City Council, setting aside objections from homeowners who 
said a proposed development could trigger landslides or other geologic 
problems, has cleared the way for a developer to build 281 houses in Canyon 
Country. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said the project by Weston Development was well-designed and 
that grading for the development would actually protect nearby neighborhoods 
from landslides. "They're making your land safer," Mayor Jo Anne Darcy told a 
small group of protesters at a public hearing Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
But Karen Holder and other protesters insisted that unstable soil near the 
proposed site is already causing homes to settle and crack on Foxlane Drive and 
other streets. They said they feared that the Weston development would further 
undermine the foundations of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
The 80-acre site, north of Whites Canyon Road and Nadal Street, is an 
unincorporated area that Weston has asked to be annexed into the city. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4 to 1, with Councilwoman Jan Heidt dissenting, to approve a 
zoning change for the property on the assumption that it would eventually 
become part of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Heidt said an environmental impact report should have been prepared for the 
project because of its size. City planners, however, concluded that such a 
review was unnecessary because it would not have a significant impact on the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
In return for city approval, the developer would donate 32 acres of land near 
Canyon High School for a municipal park and contribute $700,000 toward the 
park's construction. The park would be south of the development. 
</P>
<P>
Weston officials also agreed to pay $1.5 million in road and bridge 
construction fees -- twice the amount required by law -- and to pay a local tax 
of about $6,000 a unit to help build schools in the rapidly growing Santa 
Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The tax, approved by voters in 1987, was declared unconstitutional two years 
later by a state appellate court, but Weston agreed to pay the tax anyway, 
company President John A. Ashkar said. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said the parkland donations, school fees, and funds for roads 
and bridges would benefit the entire community. 
</P>
<P>
Protesters told the council that concessions from the developer did not 
outweigh the risks to their property. "Don't let the developers buy the city 
with offers of money and land," Dennis Dayton said. 
</P>
<P>
The opponents also said that the potential environmental problems of the 
development were not adequately studied, that the project would clog streets 
with unwanted traffic and that Weston refused to modify its plans to alleviate 
the homeowners' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
The council ordered Weston to post a bond to guarantee that the company would 
repair any homes damaged by geologic problems caused by the development.

TORRANCE UPHOLDS OFFICER'S DISMISSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET RAE-DUPREE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Torrance City Council members voted unanimously Tuesday to approve firing the 
last of three police officers accused of lying to cover up a 1988 accidental 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to uphold the dismissal of former Police Officer Mark Holden was 
announced by Mayor Katy Geissert without elaboration after a one-hour closed 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Holden and two colleagues were fired in December, 1988, after a Police 
Department investigation into the shooting of construction worker Patrick 
Coyle, who was partially paralyzed as a result of the May 9, 1988, incident. 
</P>
<P>
Holden and the other two officers -- Timothy Thornton and Timothy Pappas -- had 
previously appealed their dismissals to the city's Civil Service Commission. 
The commission unanimously upheld the department's decision in all three cases. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Scott Furstman said Holden likely will file suit against the city as a 
result of Tuesday night's decision. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his dismissal from the department, Holden also faces a criminal 
trial next month on one count of conspiracy to falsely charge another with a 
crime and one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice. 
</P>
<P>
Pappas pleaded no contest to two misdemeanor counts late last year. Thornton 
was granted immunity in return for his agreement to testify. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation into the shooting initially was closed shortly after the 
incident when the three officers told investigators that Coyle was shot as he 
made a sudden motion toward a wrench tucked into his waistband. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators reopened the case several months later when Thornton told his 
superiors that Pappas fired the shot into Coyle's face accidentally -- several 
moments after Coyle had placed the wrench on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
Furstman said that Holden, who arrived on the scene after Pappas had ordered 
Coyle to place the wrench on the sidewalk, never knew that the wrench already 
was on the ground when Coyle was shot. 
</P>
<P>
"He thought that (the wrench) was on Coyle's person and that Coyle was reaching 
for it" when Pappas pulled the trigger, Furstman said. "It was an absolutely 
reasonable assumption to make. . . . At no time did Thornton and Pappas ever 
tell Holden that the wrench was on the ground before the shooting. At no time 
did Holden lie." 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Kenneth Nelson declined to discuss the case.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VOLUNTARY WATER CONSERVATION URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As part of an effort to stem a growing water shortage in Southern California, 
the Inglewood City Council Tuesday urged residents to begin voluntary 
conservation measures. 
</P>
<P>
The council passed a resolution discouraging residents from hosing off paved 
areas, using decorative fountains that do not recirculate water, or watering 
lawns between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. The city's resolution also said restaurants 
should not serve water unless requested, and residents should wash their cars 
with buckets of water or with hoses that have shut-off devices. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood's water use has stayed roughly constant over the past five years, 
city officials said. They are hoping voluntary restrictions will cut water use 
by 10% in the next year.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BUSINESSMEN CRITICIZE L.A. AGENCIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A dozen east Wilmington businessmen joined together this week in demanding that 
Los Angeles city departments do more to rid their neighborhood of crime, 
garbage and vagrants. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very disappointed with the service we're receiving from all branches of 
government. 
</P>
<P>
And I think all of us are disgusted that businessmen are so much better off 
being just down the road in Long Beach than here in Wilmington," businessman 
Manuel Louis told officials of the Port of Los Angeles, the Police Department 
and a representative of harbor-area Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores. 
</P>
<P>
The one-hour meeting, held Monday in the offices of Stoll Engine Co. on East 
Anaheim Street, followed weeks of individual complaints by businessmen that 
their properties were suffering from ever-increasing crime and a continuing 
deterioration of nearby streets. 
</P>
<P>
The blighted area, nicknamed the Third World by local activists, is just east 
of the Dominguez Channel and north of Anaheim Street. 
</P>
<P>
Businessmen said port officials should do more to upgrade port-owned properties 
in the area. Several businessmen also charged that the port had purposely 
ignored problems plaguing local businesses, hoping to acquire more property 
from businessmen who would be willing to sell at any price. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel there is actually a scheme here," said Gary F. Duthie, president of 
Duthie Electric Service Corp. 
</P>
<P>
But the port's representatives vigorously denied Duthie's claim and other 
criticisms of the port's commitment to the area. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is the properties we've acquired are in far better shape than when we 
took them over," said Louis Arreola of the port's property management 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they are willing to look into the businessmen's complaints and 
to meet with them again in two weeks.

LEAK LEADS LANDLORD TO INDOOR MARIJUANA FOREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Glendale landlord broke into one of his apartments this week, expecting to 
find a leaky pipe. Instead, he found a miniature marijuana forest, authorities 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The greenery was growing in a homemade greenhouse, complete with high-voltage 
lighting and a hydroponic feeding system, Glendale police said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the discovery, officers arrested the tenant, Charles Hemplemen, 
38, an X-ray repair technician, when he arrived home from work. He was 
scheduled to be arraigned today on charges of cultivation and possession of 
marijuana for sale, said Sgt. Matt Wojnarowski. 
</P>
<P>
According to police reports, Alan Brimmer, 55, who owns an apartment complex in 
the 1000 block of Linden Avenue, was searching Tuesday afternoon for the source 
of water dripping into a carport. Fearing an indoor flood, Brimmer tried to 
enter an apartment above the carport, but discovered the lock had been changed. 
</P>
<P>
The landlord tried to contact the tenant at his workplace, but learned the man 
no longer worked there. Brimmer climbed through the tenant's bedroom window, 
pushed aside a reflective window covering, spotted the illegal growing system 
and called police, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Narcotics investigators found 147 marijuana plants growing in a soil-free 
hydroponic system running through one of the two bedrooms, a bathroom and 
closet. The system was held together by wood framing, and it used 500 feet of 
plastic tubing to carry water to the plants, reflective sheets to hold the 
light in and carbon dioxide to mature the plants at a low height, according to 
the police report. 
</P>
<P>
In the kitchen, officers found a distillation system for producing a 
concentrated intoxicant, hash oil, from the plants, police said. Firefighters 
were summoned to remove hazardous chemicals. Hemplemen was being held Wednesday 
at Glendale City Jail in lieu of $2,500 bail.

MARTINEZ'S 'LOVE IN THE LIGHT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Al Martinez came on the scene, I surmised another person who will give 
dialogue and anecdotes about "the good old days" of Los Angeles. While amusing 
and factual, The Times was not torn apart to get to Page 2 of the Metro section 
to read his column. 
</P>
<P>
With reading his column "Love in the Light" (May 15), concerning Paul Monette 
and his book "Borrowed Time," this man became a talisman. The strength to open 
himself up and look around and ask, "This picture of life around me, is it what 
I want to see, if not, where change can be made?" 
</P>
<P>
From my bed here in the AIDS ward of the Los Angeles County/USC Medical Center, 
I salute you, Mr. Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, with the willingness, compassion and understanding of humans like 
you, the prejudice, misunderstanding and indifference toward persons with AIDS 
and gay people as a whole will be slackened enough so that there won't be any 
"gay brother" or "straight brother," just "brother."

He has reached new heights of compassion with this insightful piece. May his

As a gay man who is HIV, I am grateful to have escaped this scourge. I have

As a volunteer at Project Angel Food where we are feeding upwards of 80

CONTROVERSY OVER BART SIMPSON: 'UNDERACHIEVER AND PROUD OF IT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Where I Live 
</P>
<P>
The story I'm about to tell takes place in Compton. Where I live the grass 
don't grow in the neighbors don't come out there house. 
</P>
<P>
 From a gangster point of view this is home sweet home, from my point of view 
it's hard to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day is a new nightmare, every nite is the same routine. In order to walk 
in my shoes you have to have a strong heart, if not than less than a week you 
have a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 I take my chances so I walk to the liquor store hoping and praying that no one 
will drive by and kill me. 
</P>
<P>
 I commend you on your response to the ban Bart Simpson campaign. This issue 
has been carried entirely too far. It seems to me that forbidding the wearing 
of T-shirts with "Underachiever and proud of it" is far less of a concern than 
some of the other problems facing schools. 
</P>
<P>
While Bart expresses ideas and attitudes that are not particularly 
complimentary of parents, teachers and nuclear weapons, he also allows the 
public a way to vent some frustrations. Bart is not meant to be an ideal for 
kids; he is only a cartoon character who is outspoken sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
If there is such a problem with Bart in the minds of some parents and teachers, 
why not think about some of the other role models that are out there? Role 
models such as athletic superstars who swear continually, abuse drugs and 
alcohol and gamble. Or rock stars who use lewd lyrics and gestures. When you 
think of the alternatives, Bart sounds pretty good.

BALLOT MEASURES

<P>
I just read my sample ballot. It indicates there is no money for schools, no 
money for prisons, no money for roads, no money for the infrastructure, no 
money for pollution control and no money for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Billions are paid in taxes. Where is the money going? Certainly not to solve 
these problems.

CONTROVERSY OVER BART SIMPSON: 'UNDERACHIEVER AND PROUD OF IT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a teacher in an alternative high school diploma program for high-risk young 
people (dropouts and potential dropouts), I think Bart is one of the best 
things that has come along. The main reasons are this: 
</P>
<P>
1. 
</P>
<P>
There is less graffiti writing and more Bart doodling! One constant part of 
working in programs like this is keeping the classroom graffiti free. 
</P>
<P>
2. All ethnic groups relate to Bart. It is important to have images that all 
students can relate to -- especially in terms of color, race and creed. Believe 
it or not, Bart being a cartoon character is more powerful than Bill Cosby in 
that whites, Latinos, Asians, Samoans -- all young males seem to relate to the 
character. 
</P>
<P>
3. We, the adults in their lives, need to have clues on the "culture" of being 
young -- especially since so many of us have forgotten it. 
</P>
<P>
High school students must dream, daydream, doodle, be understood, have 
something that connects them to each other over race lines and to us over age 
lines. Seeing students come to class in clean, brightly colored Bart T-shirts 
and doodling with Bart cartoons is wonderful! 
</P>
<P>
The following is the writing of one 16-year-old black male in my class (a rough 
draft -- please look at the content). This young man is a particular fan of 
Bart.

CONTROVERSY OVER BART SIMPSON: 'UNDERACHIEVER AND PROUD OF IT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I commend you on your response to the ban Bart Simpson campaign. This issue has 
been carried entirely too far. It seems to me that forbidding the wearing of 
T-shirts with "Underachiever and proud of it" is far less of a concern than 
some of the other problems facing schools. 
</P>
<P>
While Bart expresses ideas and attitudes that are not particularly 
complimentary of parents, teachers and nuclear weapons, he also allows the 
public a way to vent some frustrations. Bart is not meant to be an ideal for 
kids; he is only a cartoon character who is outspoken sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
If there is such a problem with Bart in the minds of some parents and teachers, 
why not think about some of the other role models that are out there? Role 
models such as athletic superstars who swear continually, abuse drugs and 
alcohol and gamble. Or rock stars who use lewd lyrics and gestures. When you 
think of the alternatives, Bart sounds pretty good.

WHAT ARE THE CONTRAS UP TO NOW?; 
</P>
<P>
A DECISION NOT TO DEMOBILIZE HAS WASHINGTON'S PRINTS ALL OVER IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEXANDER COCKBURN, Alexander Cockburn is a columnist for The Nation and 
other publications. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Contra leaders in Nicaragua are now claiming that it was the recent strike 
by Sandinista civil service employees that caused them to halt the 
demobilization and keep at least 10,000 Contras under arms. Government workers 
rebelled against incoming President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's savage 
austerity measure to crush the public service sector unions and there is even 
some evidence that the Sandinista leadership, palavering with Chamorro, was 
taken aback by the militancy of the workers. 
</P>
<P>
But anyone believing that until the strike the Contras were prepared to lay 
down their arms is misreading the brutal political hand that the United States 
is continuing to play out in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
The benign interpretation of current White House policy is that the United 
Nicaraguan Opposition's electoral victory of Feb. 25 closed the books on U.S. 
sponsorship of the Contras. All that remained was the arrangement of a brisk 
schedule for their demobilization and re-entry into civilian society. Operating 
within these rosy assumptions, the American press reported last week the solemn 
assertions of government officials that $30 million of the funds President Bush 
is seeking for Nicaragua should be earmarked for the Contras. Otherwise, they 
might break out of their camps to "forage" for themselves and their families. 
</P>
<P>
The premise here is that U.S. policy is essentially one of encouraging 
"reconciliation" in Nicaragua, with the Sandinista army remaining in place but 
gradually dwindling in size. 
</P>
<P>
There is as little reason to believe this premise as there was in trusting that 
President Reagan would respect the Boland Amendment of 1984 (which cut off 
military aid to the Contras) or that Bush would honor the bipartisan accord of 
April, 1989 (which promised that in return for humanitarian aid, there would be 
no further Contra attacks). 
</P>
<P>
What the Nicaraguan election in fact prompted was a U.S.-backed Contra 
invasion. More than 10,000 armed Contras crossed back into Nicaragua from 
Honduras in the aftermath of the Chamorro government's victory. But the 
mainstream American press has been almost entirely silent about what these 
Contras have been up to. Less tactful observers, like the courageous members of 
Witness for Peace, have been sending north a stream of detailed reports of 
Contra outrages: the terrorizing and kidnaping of peasants, burning of 
agricultural cooperatives, destruction of equipment and supplies. To take just 
one example: On April 28, more than 600 Contras devastated the co-op at 
Mancotal, destroying and stealing everything in their path and vowing that the 
land would be returned to its former owners. 
</P>
<P>
These reports also stress that the marauding Contras are freshly uniformed and 
armed. So who armed them? The lack of curiosity on this important matter is 
extraordinary and the answer is obvious. 
</P>
<P>
The Contras have not laid down their arms to any substantive degree, and the 
United States is making no effort to pressure them to do so. On Monday, an 
Irish army officer just back from the United Nations force in Nicaragua said 
that in the security zone on the border with Honduras, only 19 Contras out of 
more that 4,500 had disarmed before he went on leave. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. claim that the Contras need another $30 million to prevent them from 
having to "forage" -- that is, terrorize co-ops -- is not credible. As with the 
humanitarian aid last year, the money is required to keep them in place as an 
armed force. 
</P>
<P>
It is an absolute constant of U.S. policy in the Americas that Washington 
abhors any military force not under its control or patronage. Realistic 
analysis suggests that so long as a Sandinista army remains, the United States 
will make sure the Contras are not demobilized. Washington's aim is not for a 
democracy in which the Sandinistas might return to power in 1996 or "rule from 
below" before that time, but for the re-establishment of the old National 
Guard. The policy is not reconciliation but the systematic destruction of the 
Sandinistas as a decisive force in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Money for the Contras and U.S. pressure that they stay assembled in a 
designated enclave play the same role as money for the government -- i.e. the 
armed forces -- of El Salvador: extirpation of the possibility of reform. And 
if President Chamorro is not sufficiently resolute in playing her part? Who is 
not to say that we will not see someone like Vice President Virgilio Godoy, 
buttressed by the Contra force, calling for U.S. help in countering the 
Sandinista threat to a "fledgling democracy"?

A VETO IS THE CHOICE OF REASON; 
</P>
<P>
THE 1990 CIVIL RIGHTS BILL SHOULD BE CALLED THE CHARTER FOR INSTITUTIONALIZED 
RACISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM F. BUCKLEY JR., William F. Buckley Jr. is a syndicated columnist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten days ago, on a social occasion, I asked Ronald Reagan how he accounted for 
the higher popularity among blacks of George Bush, given that both Reagan and 
Bush have fought discrimination for years. He clutched into his reminiscent 
mode and recounted that in his boyhood, in Illinois, the gravest crime was any 
gesture of racial discrimination; and that as governor of California, he had 
appointed more blacks to public office than "all governors of California before 
me, cumulatively." 
</P>
<P>
So I repeated the question: How did he account for the relative popularity of 
George Bush? 
</P>
<P>
His answer: "He replaced me." 
</P>
<P>
This amused me, and I tucked it away in the memory as a non-answer to a 
question probably unanswerable. And then this week I saw an account of Vernon 
Jordan's speech at the commencement exercises of George Mason University, in 
Fairfax, Va., where he threatened Bush with the loss of what black support he 
has if he vetoes the pending 1990 civil-rights bill. The Washington Post 
reported: "Jordan, addressing 3,700 graduates at the university's Patriot 
Center, drew applause and laughter when he said, 'My friend the President and 
his advisers should not be complacent about polls showing high approval ratings 
among blacks because George Bush is benefiting from simply not being Ronald 
Reagan.' " 
</P>
<P>
Reagan, in his own way, so often uncanny, had not exactly explained why his 
popularity among blacks hovered in the vicinity of 10%, but did explain why his 
successor's hovers at about 56%. 
</P>
<P>
The plot, unhappily, thickens. It is widely predicted that President Bush will 
not veto the pending civil-rights bill, having extracted from Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy (D-Mass.), its principal sponsor, a couple of cosmetic accommodations. 
The bill should be called the 1990 Charter for Institutionalized Racism in 
America. That, quite simply, is what it is. 
</P>
<P>
The bill wanders about a great deal, seeking to overturn several Supreme Court 
rulings that have sought to reorient civil-rights law in the direction in which 
it was launched in 1964. What Vernon Jordan and Sen. Kennedy are primarily 
concerned about is the Supreme Court decision that held that to plead a 
violation of your civil rights by simply adducing a statistical disparity 
against ethnic representation in that community isn't enough to put the onus on 
the employer. The Supreme Court said, in effect, that if John Doe wants to sue 
Harry Smith for firing him, or for failing to hire him, then he has to prove 
that Harry Smith was racially motivated in this decision. 
</P>
<P>
What had been happening before the Supreme Court's reversal were lawsuits in 
which employers were presumptively guilty of racial (or sexist) prejudice, 
never mind the circumstances. The modus operandi, under the new law, would ask 
for nothing much more than the statistical disparity from which would follow 
the presumption of the employer's guilt of practicing discrimination. Thus if 
the community is 15% black, and the fire department is only 10% black, the fire 
department becomes guilty of a violation of the civil-rights law, except under 
extraordinary circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
It is the dream bill of the racial quota system. An employer would face the 
following choice: Hire with strict reference to ethnic residential patterns, or 
face a lawsuit, a jury trial, lawyers' fees conceivably in excess of years of 
your income. Meanwhile, the plaintiff becomes the employer of last resort of 
the legal community. Every minority member not hired or fired is at liberty to 
call that telephone number, and an eager lawyer will file suit for a million 
dollars on a contingency basis. 
</P>
<P>
And: "Even though their profession profits monetarily from increased government 
regulations," writes Susan Mandel in National Review, "35 top 
industrial-psychology professors sent senators a letter in March on the subject 
of the test that makes 'business necessity' the only justification for job 
qualifications that contribute to racial imbalance. They called the test 'a 
technically infeasible, subjective standard which the psychological profession 
and employers cannot meet or even define.' " 
</P>
<P>
Leaving us with? The most important challenge to right reason by George Bush. 
He will, or will not, veto the institutionalization of racism in America.

WATER AS WEALTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Margaret Mason, a Santa Barbara resident, talked to The Times about water 
restrictions adopted by her city because of the drought. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city doesn't accept . . . state water because we don't want rapid 
development. I support that. Some communities have no planning -- and they have 
overcrowded conditions. 
</P>
<P>
That's the kind of environment I rejected when I moved here from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
I'm aligned with the slow-growthers, but I have mixed feelings. Santa Barbara 
is the only community in California that bans lawn watering. If you stay within 
the overall (water-use) limits, you should be allowed to water your lawn. 
</P>
<P>
I think politicians imposed the ban so they could claim they were taking direct 
action. We're supposed to look around and see brown lawns and feel good because 
they're doing something. 
</P>
<P>
 If the drought continues, differences between the haves and have-nots will be 
heightened because some people are actually paying to have companies bring in 
water from outside sources. They buy it to water their lawns because they can 
afford to sustain an aesthetic environment. That's causing something of an 
uproar.

MUST DEMONSTRATORS BE SHOT?; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: INTERNATIONAL GUIDELINES ARE BEING DRAWN TO HELP AUTHORITIES CONTROL 
OUTBREAKS OF DOMESTIC POLITICAL VIOLENCE WITHOUT EXCESSIVE FORCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID J. SCHEFFER, David J. Scheffer, a lawyer, is a senior associate at the 
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
One year ago, the Tian An Men massacre offered the most brutal evidence of how 
incompetent and clumsy one government could be when confronted with a mass 
political demonstration. But the Chinese have not been alone in their bloody 
crowd-control tactics. In the past 18 months, government troops and police also 
used lethal force against civilian protesters in Soviet Georgia, 
Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Romania, the West Bank, Soviet Azerbaijan, 
Kashmir, the Serbian province of Kosovo, Soviet Tadzhikistan, Haiti, South 
Africa, Nepal and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
While international law has been invoked in conflicts between nations, it is 
woefully inadequate at restraining governments under siege from opening fire on 
their own citizens. Finally, some international guidelines are being drawn. 
</P>
<P>
A special congress of the United Nations will be convened this summer in Havana 
to approve some basic international principles on the use of force and firearms 
by law-enforcement officials. The principles should guide governments in the 
drafting of laws and, at a minimum, influence state authorities to follow more 
civilized rules of conduct. 
</P>
<P>
In some of these conflicts, especially where ethnic and nationalist issues 
dominate, the protesters also have used weapons. The hard cases, where peaceful 
demonstrators mix with armed protesters, present excruciating dilemmas for 
law-enforcement officials, many of whom have little training in crowd control 
or urban guerrilla warfare. 
</P>
<P>
For example, combat-trained Soviet troops sent to Azerbaijan had to fight a 
guerrilla war with local militia and contain unarmed civilian protesters. Where 
there are orders to shoot on sight, as the Indian army received in Kashmir, 
then the line can be easily crossed from crowd control to indiscriminate 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
The obvious atrocities, such as the government-ordered massacre in Beijing, beg 
for unequivocal condemnation under international law. But archaic claims that 
domestic order is the internal affair of a sovereign nation have stymied 
efforts to regulate, or even condemn, such use of force. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights endorse the right to participate in 
lawful and peaceful assemblies, there is scant international law to guide 
officials on crowd-control methods so as to minimize the use of armed force 
against political demonstrators and even armed protesters. 
</P>
<P>
There is a hefty, albeit controversial, code of conduct by which to judge 
conflicts between nations. And Protocol II of the 1949 Geneva Convention 
protects the rights of combatants and civilians engulfed in traditional civil 
wars, but not those who are caught up in internal disturbances. The Genocide 
Convention and the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 remain only partial fixes. 
</P>
<P>
Among the new U.N. guidelines would be a restraint on the use of firearms 
except in self-defense or in the defense of others where there is an immediate 
threat of death or serious injury. When confronting unlawful but nonviolent 
assemblies, police and army troops would have to avoid the use of force or, 
where that becomes impracticable, could use only minimum force to break up the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
In dispersing violent assemblies, law- enforcement officials could use firearms 
for defensive purposes only when less dangerous means fail. Violent 
demonstrators would be entitled to receive a clear warning of the intent to 
open fire and then given enough time to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
The basic principles also encourage governments to develop a broad range of 
crowd-control methods and to obtain non-lethal incapacitating weapons to 
minimize deaths and injuries. European countries may push in Havana for a 
prohibition on the use of firearms against children and, to the extent 
possible, juveniles and women. Exceptional circumstances, such as internal 
political instability or any other public emergency, could not be invoked to 
depart from any of the basic principles. 
</P>
<P>
The influence of these non-binding principles on law-making bodies should not 
be underestimated. These principles on use of force should prove popular with 
representative governments, especially those emerging in Eastern Europe and the 
Soviet Union. Regional governments rarely have the opportunity to implement 
principles of international law in their local codes. 
</P>
<P>
But the Bush Administration appears unlikely to participate in the conference 
because of Cuba's deplorable human-rights record. Despite the ironic notion 
that such worthwhile principles will be debated and approved in uniquely 
repressive surroundings, the Administration will be abdicating the moral high 
ground if it stays home. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and all democratic governments should be present in Havana to 
legislate the very principles that some day could help save the lives of people 
demonstrating for their freedom, especially in Cuba.

CAMARENA CASE WITNESS TESTIFIES ABOUT SEEING REMAINS OF HUSBAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The widow of an American writer killed by drug traffickers in Mexico in 1985 
tearfully described examining her dead husband's body at the Guadalajara morgue 
in wrenching testimony Wednesday at the trial of four men charged in the murder 
of DEA Agent Enrique Camarena. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Evelyn Walker, now a Texas schoolteacher, described in Los Angeles federal 
court how she was told that the remains of her husband, John Walker, were at 
the morgue in June, 1985, after she had spent months trying to find him. 
</P>
<P>
She said the State Department called her St. Paul, Minn., home on Feb. 14, 
1985, to tell her that Walker, a free-lance writer, had disappeared from 
Guadalajara. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the writer and his friend, Alberto Radelat, a medical student, were 
already dead. They had been beaten to death by narcotics traffickers after they 
apparently stumbled into a party of the Guadalajara drug cartel at the city's 
La Langosta restaurant on Jan. 30, 1985, and were mistaken for DEA agents. 
Their remains were discovered in a local park on June 19, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Walker said she went to the morgue with Radelat's father. She said she 
knew one of two bodies lying on tables was that of her husband as soon as she 
saw it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was only a skeleton, but not just a skeleton," she testified, trying to 
contain her tears. "There were parts of his body still on him -- one of his 
eyes, his overlip . . . his mustache. It was John. It was, unmistakably, John." 
</P>
<P>
Only one of the four men on trial in the Camarena case, Javier Vasquez Velasco, 
is accused of the Walker and Radelat murders, which occurred only eight days 
before the abduction and slaying of the agent in Guadalajara. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez is being tried with the other three defendants, over the objections of 
his defense lawyer, because U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie determined that 
there were significant connections between the killings. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of the trial, federal prosecutor John Carlton said Guadalajara 
narcotics traffickers committed a series of retaliatory acts against the DEA 
because they were angry about major raids in 1984 that had cost the traffickers 
$5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The murders of Walker and Radelat were described as being among those 
retaliatory acts. 
</P>
<P>
Another of those acts, according to prosecutors, was an attempt by drug 
traffickers to kill a Guadalajara attorney, Cesar Garcia Bueno, after they 
learned he was providing information to Camarena. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying Wednesday from a wheelchair, Garcia described how a gunman entered a 
Guadalajara restaurant, shot him in the back, and said, "you're dying, because 
you are a snitch." 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, the prosecution ran into some difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
In one potentially significant development, Thomas Gomez, a DEA agent who was 
sent to Guadalajara on special assignment in the fall of 1984, said that he had 
been in the Mexican city from mid-October to mid-November of that year and had 
not seen Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, one of the men he was assigned to check 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Matta is one of the four defendants in the case. The government has accused 
Matta, a convicted Honduran drug lord, of being one of the plotters of 
Camarena's kidnaping and murder and allege that he took part in meetings to 
plan the assassination in October, 1984, in Guadalajara. 
</P>
<P>
Outside court, Matta's defense lawyer, Martin R. Stolar, said he thought 
Gomez's statement was "very significant" because it raised questions about the 
government's charges against Matta. 
</P>
<P>
At mid-afternoon, another key government witness, Enrique Placentia Aguilar, a 
former member of the Guadalajara police SWAT team, said he was present at a 
December, 1984, meeting during which Camarena's photo was passed around among a 
number of drug traffickers -- including Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, Rafael Caro 
Quintero and others linked to the Camarena killing. 
</P>
<P>
Placentia said that defendant Vasquez was among those who were at the meeting. 
However, he was unable to identify him in court Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Later, outside the presence of the jury, Assistant U.S. Atty. Manuel Medrano, 
one of the prosecutors, said that Placentia had identified Vasquez recently 
when he was shown a photocopy of his photo. 
</P>
<P>
Placentia's forgetfulness was potentially harmful to the prosecution. He 
allegedly was an eyewitness to the Walker killing at the restaurant and was to 
have testified that Vasquez was present. 
</P>
<P>
The final witness of the day was Hector Cervantes Santos, another former 
Mexican law enforcement officer, who served for several years as a bodyguard to 
a Mexican attorney, Javier Barba Hernandez, who was closely allied with drug 
traffickers. Barba was killed in a 1986 shoot-out with Mexican police, amid 
rumors that high government officials were concerned that he might be 
questioned about the Camarena killing. 
</P>
<P>
According to the prosecution's case, some of the key meetings to plan 
Camarena's abduction and killing were held at Barba's house in late 1984. Late 
Wednesday, Cervantes, now a paid U.S. government informant, said he was present 
at a September, 1984, baptism for Barba's son. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes said that defendant Ruben Zuno Arce was also present at the baptism, 
along with several major drug traffickers; Javier Garcia Paniagua, now the 
Mexico City police chief and formerly the head of Mexico's leading political 
party, the PRI, and defendant Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
The witness identified both Zuno and Vasquez in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes said that during the baptism party a small meeting was held at 
Barba's house in which a drug trafficker and Zuno discussed a DEA agent who was 
causing them trouble. Cervantes quoted Zuno as saying that the agent "should be 
picked up." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors did not ask the witness to name the agent during Wednesday's 
testimony.

STUDY SAYS ANTI-BIAS PLANS FAIL TO AID STUDENTS; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOLS: THE L.A. DISTRICT IS CRITICIZED FOR FAILING TO IMPROVE OPPORTUNITIES 
FOR PUPILS, ESPECIALLY BLACKS AND LATINOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite more than a dozen years of court-ordered attempts to alleviate the harm 
of racial segregation, the Los Angeles Unified School District has failed to 
improve achievement and opportunities for many of its students -- especially 
blacks and Latinos, according to a district report. 
</P>
<P>
Youngsters who must take long school bus rides to other communities because of 
overcrowding in their neighborhood schools have suffered the most -- sometimes 
scoring only half as high on achievement tests as their classmates who live 
close to campus. 
</P>
<P>
"Many students are still shackled by the harms of racial isolation -- low 
academic achievement and limited post-secondary opportunities. Black and 
Hispanic students are especially afflicted by these harms," the district's 
annual integration report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Although the district annually scrutinizes its various programs aimed at 
mitigating the effects of racial segregation, Monday's special Board of 
Education hearing marked the first time it has aired the findings in public. 
</P>
<P>
Board members, preparing to make decisions on next year's integration budget, 
took no action on the report, but they discussed it for several hours. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Jackie Goldberg -- who has pushed for public hearings on the 
integration report since her election seven years ago -- said she was "dismayed 
but not surprised" by the findings. 
</P>
<P>
"We have made some progress in some important areas," Goldberg said, "but one 
of the major important harms of segregation is low achievement. And we have not 
done nearly enough to close the gap between kids from middle-income families 
and those from low-income families. And in Los Angeles, there is a lot of 
correlation between race and income level." 
</P>
<P>
The report studied students in 229 schools participating in various 
desegregation programs in grades four. five, seven, eight, 10, 11 and 12 last 
school year. It looked at a variety of factors -- including standardized test 
scores, parental involvement, ethnic background, whether students attended 
schools with minority enrollments of 70% or more, whether they were bused, 
their post-graduation plans, the attitudes of their teachers and 
administrators, and the students' self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
The study also compared how various groups did in different school settings and 
found that students in the district's popular "magnet" program of specialized 
schools fared the best. That is not surprising because the poorest students 
rarely apply for the magnet programs. 
</P>
<P>
The district buses nearly 25,000 students daily from crowded neighborhood 
schools -- many in low-income areas with big influxes of recent immigrants -- 
to less congested campuses, often in suburban, middle-class communities. Those 
students often fare poorly, the report showed. 
</P>
<P>
For example, fourth-grade reading scores on the Comprehensive Test of Basic 
Skills showed that the bused students earned a mean percentile score of 28, 
while students who lived near the school scored 58. In math, the bused students 
scored 32; the neighborhood youngsters, 66. 
</P>
<P>
The report also found that bused students had many disadvantages, ranging from 
late arrival of records from their home area schools to not enough bilingual 
teachers at their new schools. 
</P>
<P>
Reading vocabulary scores for all grades taking the same test varied markedly 
by ethnic group. Thirty-eight percent of American Indians scored in the "very 
low" range, as did 28% of Asians, 48% of blacks, and 55% of Latinos. Only 17% 
of whites scored in the lowest range. The test-takers included students with 
limited English skills. 
</P>
<P>
The report also found that black students at lower-achieving schools had the 
lowest expectations for their own achievement. 
</P>
<P>
One of the bright spots in the report were positive findings in schools with 
parent participation projects and in low-income schools that offered 
language-arts-oriented preschool programs to 4-year-olds. Those students went 
on to do significantly better in elementary school than their counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
The district spent $354 million on desegregation programs this year, with the 
bulk of the funds paying for bus transportation and reducing class sizes, all 
part of the integration plan worked out with the courts over several years. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg said the report and Monday's hearing were aimed at helping the 
financially troubled district figure out the best return on its desegregation 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
"For those things that are not working, we must make changes," she said. "It is 
not enough any longer to just wring our hands and say we are dismayed. We have 
to try some new things. There is no guarantee the new things will work, but we 
have got to try."

Overview 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalist Glenn Bailey is attempting to wrest control of the heavily 
Democratic 40th State Assembly District from Assemblyman Tom Bane, a powerful 
player in the state Legislature. Bailey has raised less than $1,000, stressing 
his fresh outlook and environmental qualifications in a grass-roots campaign. 
Bane has a huge campaign finance reserve, estimated at close to $1 million, and 
solid name recognition among voters built up over eight consecutive terms. 
However, Bane may suffer repercussions from recent controversies surrounding 
grants made to one of his contributors by Bane's wife, as chairwoman of the 
state Lupus Appropriations Board. 
</P>
<P>
Contenders 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Bailey, 34, of Encino, has been a regional coordinator for statewide 
wildlife and environmental ballot initiatives for the past three years. He also 
works as an administrative assistant for summer school programs and reading 
clinics at Cal State Northridge. Raised in the San Fernando Valley, he received 
an associate degree in life and earth sciences from Pierce College, and 
attended CSUN, majoring in political science. He previously was elected to the 
Northwestern Los Angeles Resource Conservancy District board, and in 1988 ran 
unsuccessfully for the Board of Supervisors seat held by Mike Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Bane, 76, of Tarzana is in his 10th term in the Assembly, where, as a close 
ally of Speaker Willie Brown, he serves as chairman of the influential Rules 
Committee. He was first elected in 1958, ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 
1962 and returned to the Assembly in 1974. Bane graduated from Burbank High 
School, and attended Los Angeles Community College for two years. He also 
attended night school at Southwestern Law School and USC. A former national 
trade association manager, Bane served as a commissioner on the Los Angeles 
City Employees Retirement Board and the L.A. City-County Government 
Consolidation Study committee. His wife's name is Marlene, and he has one son 
and two grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Helen R. Gabriel, a Republican, and John Vernon, a Libertarian, are unopposed 
in their primaries. Their names will appear on the general election ballot in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
Questionnaire 
</P>
<P>
Questionnaires were distributed to candidates and were returned this month. 
Answers have been edited to fit the available space. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Under recently introduced legislation, state sales taxes would be raised by 
a quarter-cent for 10 years to help finance school construction. Do you favor 
an increase in sales taxes to underwrite new school construction? 
</P>
<P>
Bailey: No. Sales taxes disproportionately burden working people. We should 
continue using bond financing for school construction. 
</P>
<P>
Bane: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. A measure on the June ballot would raise taxes on gasoline sales by 9 cents 
a gallon to finance highway projects. Do you support the concept of higher gas 
taxes to underwrite road construction? 
</P>
<P>
Bailey: No. I support higher gasoline taxes to promote fuel conservation and 
rapid transit, but not to build new highways. 
</P>
<P>
Bane: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support a woman's unrestricted right to an abortion within the first 
three months of pregnancy? 
</P>
<P>
Bailey: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Bane: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support capital punishment? 
</P>
<P>
Bailey: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Bane: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support the idea of breaking up the Los Angeles Unified School 
District into smaller districts? 
</P>
<P>
Bailey: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Bane: Left unanswered. Said this still requires further study and cost 
projections. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Under current law, the state Legislature is responsible for redrawing state 
legislative and congressional district boundaries. Do you believe this system 
should be changed? 
</P>
<P>
Bailey: No. But districts should be compact, should not divide communities, and 
should not be gerrymandered. 
</P>
<P>
Bane: Yes. Although I would agree to a nonpartisan alternate method of 
redistricting, I do not believe Propositions 118 and 119 are viable solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support the so-called "Big Green" ballot initiative, which would 
eliminate ozone-depleting chemicals by the year 2000, phase out pesticides 
known to cause cancer and require that trees be planted in all new 
developments? 
</P>
<P>
Bailey: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Bane: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you think the state should require private employers to subsidize 
day-care services for employees who request them? 
</P>
<P>
Bailey: Yes. Day-care centers should be required in all new large commercial 
and industrial projects. 
</P>
<P>
Bane: Yes. The state should not mandate. However, employers of large numbers of 
employees would probably have access to higher caliber employees and greater 
productivity by offering day care. Every other country provides such service. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support the state's efforts to build prisons in Lancaster and East 
Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
Bailey: No. Neither prisons nor dumps belong in residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
Bane: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 112 on the June ballot would ban speaking fees and limit gifts 
to state legislators while creating a commission that could pave the way for 
higher legislative salaries. Do you support this ballot initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Bailey: No. Ethics reform should not be tied to salary increases. Proposition 
112, placed on the ballot by the legislators, would financially reward them for 
being corrupt. 
</P>
<P>
Bane: Yes. I support the ban on honoraria and a limit on gifts. I would have 
preferred a ceiling on salaries. I support a citizens commission to determine 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support Gov. Deukmejian's proposed constitutional changes that would 
require state prison inmates to work in privately sponsored industries to pay 
for their incarceration? 
</P>
<P>
Bailey: Yes, provided that prevailing wages are paid, and these monies go to 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
Bane: No. I do support prisoners working within the prisons to feed, clothe and 
support themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you believe our present system of criminal prosecution, interdiction of 
supplies and imprisonment of users and dealers will ever significantly reduce 
the level of drug use in the United States? 
</P>
<P>
If no, what should be done? 
</P>
<P>
Bailey: No. Take the profit out of the drug business by reducing demand through 
peer pressure and significant economic investment in depressed areas. 
</P>
<P>
Bane: No. Tougher penalties for providers. Federal government should give a 
higher priority to border protection and prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Would you consider the possibility of decriminalizing the use of drugs? 
</P>
<P>
Bailey: Yes, but not the sale of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Bane: No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support raising sales or other taxes to finance anti-drug law 
enforcement efforts and/or anti-drug education programs? 
</P>
<P>
If yes, by how much? 
</P>
<P>
Bailey: Yes. Raise taxes on legalized drugs -- tobacco and alcohol -- as is 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Bane: No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support full or partial public funding of political campaigns? 
</P>
<P>
Bailey: Yes. The Legislature is a puppet of the special interests that finance 
their campaigns. Corporate and PAC monies should be outlawed. Since the last 
election, the incumbent in this race has received $1 million in special 
interest campaign contributions, almost none of which was from this district. 
</P>
<P>
Bane: No. No explanation given. 
</P>
<P>
Q. A ballot initiative now in circulation would prohibit foreign individuals 
and corporations from owning land in California. Do you support this? 
</P>
<P>
Bailey: No answer checked. Said he would support a 49% foreign ownership limit 
of any property in California. 
</P>
<P>
Bane: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Rising property values in the Santa Monica Mountains have made it more 
difficult for state and federal parks agencies to buy land for public use. Land 
prices have escalated in part because local officials have allowed developers 
to build more houses than provided for under zoning laws. To keep property 
prices more affordable to parks agencies, should governments in Los Angeles and 
Ventura counties refuse such so-called "upzoning"? 
</P>
<P>
Bailey: Yes. Another example of the influence of campaign contributions from 
developers. The general plan should be the maximum density allowed, rather than 
the base. 
</P>
<P>
Bane: Yes. No explanation given. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are you willing to publicly release your tax returns and those of your 
spouse before the election? 
</P>
<P>
Bailey: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Bane: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. A development project called Porter Ranch would create 3,395 residential 
units and nearly 6 million square feet of commercial office space in the 
Chatsworth hills. Opponents say it is too big. Proponents say it represents 
orderly growth. Do you support the project at this size? 
</P>
<P>
Bailey: No. Century City North does not belong in our foothills. 
</P>
<P>
Bane: No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support limits on the number of terms state legislators can serve? 
</P>
<P>
If yes, how long should they be? 
</P>
<P>
Bailey: Yes. Eight years: two terms for senators, four terms for assembly 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Bane: No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. A ballot initiative now in circulation would prohibit the spraying of 
pesticides on private property without the written consent of the owner. Do you 
support this measure? 
</P>
<P>
Bailey: Yes. I am circulating the petition. 
</P>
<P>
Bane: Yes.

CONWAY SOUNDS OFF, HELPS MATER DEI EDGE SIMI VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hitless in her first five appearances Wednesday, Mater Dei High's Theresa 
Conway punctuated each at-bat by slamming her helmet against her team's bench 
in frustration. 
</P>
<P>
Helmet on wood was not the resounding thud that silenced Simi Valley fans in 
the 10th inning of a Southern Section 5-A Division softball quarterfinal, 
however. It was the crack of a Conway single that drove in the winning run and 
lifted Mater Dei to a 3-2 victory over Simi Valley at Rancho Simi Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't really made my contribution," said Conway, a senior who extended her 
hitting streak to seven games. "I had to go out with a bang, if anything." 
</P>
<P>
The two-out hit, which drove in Tina Fuata, negated a dramatic seventh-inning 
comeback by Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
With the Pioneers trailing, 2-0, Amy Hood led off by reaching base on an error. 
After Erika Rustan grounded out, Beth Naples singled up the middle. Amy Powell 
then grounded out, advancing Naples to second while Hood remained at third. 
Gina Skinner followed with a double down the third-base line, forging a 2-2 
tie. The rally ended when Taina Tande popped out. 
</P>
<P>
Consecutive singles to lead off the eighth put Simi Valley runners at first and 
second but Mater Dei pitcher Jennifer Clark retired the next three batters. The 
Pioneers had another chance in the ninth, but Naples was thrown out at second 
after trying to take an extra base. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley Coach Suzanne Manlet said the Pioneers showed their inexperience. 
Two freshmen and five sophomores start for Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We win and lose as a team," said Manlet, whose team committed six errors. 
"It's just going to take a little experience to get over the bumps." 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei, seeded fourth in the 5-A, was in a position in the early innings to 
deliver a few more bumps. The Monarchs scored a run in the first but left the 
bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
They stranded a runner at second in the next inning and, in the third, failed 
to score despite again loading the bases. 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth, Mater Dei's Amy Moeller followed consecutive strikeouts with a 
triple. Amy Godwin hit a hard grounder to short that was bobbled by Tande. 
Moeller scored on the error, increasing the Monarchs' lead to 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei Coach Cathy Quesnell was frustrated by the sporadic offense against 
starting pitcher Michelle Castanguay (10-4), who was replaced by Heather 
Santiago in the fourth after an erratic performance. 
</P>
<P>
Quesnell expected the hard-throwing Santiago to start. Two months ago, Mater 
Dei beat Santiago, 2-1, in an eight-inning game in the Canyon tournament that 
was decided by a tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
"That threw me for a loop. It was a shock," Quesnell said of the decision to 
start Castanguay, noting that Mater Dei batters were caught off guard by the 
softer pitches. "We struggle with slow pitchers. As soon as a fast pitcher 
comes up, that's what they're used to." 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley finished with eight hits, Mater Dei had seven. 
</P>
<P>
Clark (15-1), a freshman, earned the victory. Three times -- including in the 
10th inning -- she retired the side in order. 
</P>
<P>
"She's really composed," Quesnell said. "But you can see worry across her 
forehead. She's grown up at least four years on the mound."

HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
MIDWAY BAPTIST WINS, REACHES 1-A SEMIFINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Smith struck out seven in four innings to raise his season total to 116 
in 68 innings as Midway Baptist beat La Jolla Country Day, 8-5, in the 
quarterfinals of the San Diego Section 1-A baseball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Midway Baptist (20-3), seeded No. 1, twice came through with big hits -- Jeff 
Moore drove in two runs with a two-out single in the first, and Chris Mulkey 
knocked in two runs with a two-out triple in the third. 
</P>
<P>
David Eichenlaub hit an inside-the-park home run for Midway Baptist in the 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth, La Jolla Country Day (9-15-1) loaded the bases for Damian 
Campbell, who hit a shot into right center on which right fielder Craig Foster 
made an airborne diving catch to keep the Torres from tying. 
</P>
<P>
In other 1-A quarterfinals: 
</P>
<P>
Holtville 5, Bishop's 1 -- Holtville advances to the Friday's semifinals, in 
which it will play Midway Baptist at Mar Vista at 3:30 p.m. Bishop's finished 
at 10-9-1. 
</P>
<P>
Julian 12, Borrego Springs 5 -- John Hockin, who has batted only three times in 
Julian's past eight games, pinch hit in the fifth inning with two out, a man on 
and Julian (15-8) up by one. He came through with a home run for what turned 
out to be the game-winning hit. 
</P>
<P>
Borrego Springs finished 8-10-1. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial 10, Mountain Empire 6 -- Imperial (12-6-3), seeded No. 3, goes on to

3-A Semifinals 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel 10, Mira Mesa 8 -- Mt. Carmel's No. 2 singles player, George Lobb, 
provided the margin of victory with two close victories. He first won a 7-3 
tiebreaker after ending a set with Ryan Connors at 6-6. Later he fell behind Ed 
Hendrickson, 4-3, before coming back for a 7-5 victory. 
</P>
<P>

EL CAMINO'S NEDJAR WINS ALL-AROUND TITLE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
On a visit to the University of Pennsylvania last Thanksgiving, El Camino 
gymnast Mona Nedjar was given some advice she hasn't forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
"They said don't compare yourself to everyone else, because everyone is just as 
smart, is just as active, is just as successful and just as pretty as you are," 
Nedjar said. "You have to do things for yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Nedjar, 18, chose not to watch other routines, didn't worry about scores -- not 
even her own -- and took one event at a time. The strategy earned her the 
optional all-around title at the San Diego Section individual championships 
Wednesday at Santana. 
</P>
<P>
Nedjar's score of 37.05 was a personal best and bettered the 36.65 by Torrey 
Pines' Julie Kawasaki, who also was second last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never really won anything big like this," Nedjar said. "That's why this 
meet was so important." 
</P>
<P>
Nedjar's first season of high school gymnastics almost didn't happen. After a 
two-month bout of illness that started with strep throat and ended with chicken 
pox, Nedjar quit her club team, West Coast Gymnastics, in December. 
</P>
<P>
"I had lost so much weight and muscle there was no way I would have been ready 
for my club season," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She joined the dance club and considered running track as a way to stay in 
shape, but she went out for gymnastics when El Camino when Anne Allen, last 
year's coach and Nedjar's dance club adviser, decided to stay on instead of 
resigning when a replacement could not be found. 
</P>
<P>
"I really liked her," she said. "Also, the gymnastics team hadn't won league in 
10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines finished one-two in the compulsory all-around, with Lauren Gist 
(36.75) finishing ahead of Lellie Hose (35.90). 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines won the team title with 214.40 points, well ahead of Santana 
(205.95). 
</P>
<P>
Nedjar took first on floor exercise and balance beam and third on vault and 
uneven bars. Kawasaki won bars, but it was the fourth on the beam, usually her 
strongest event, that hurt her chances to win all-around the most. She fell 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
"I usually don't fall," said Kawasaki, a member of Mira Mesa Gymnastics Center 
and bound for UC Davis. "I got first on beam at (U.S. Gymnastics Federation) 
regionals. It's disappointing because this was my last chance to win. It's been 
a goal of mine for four years, but it (had been) untouchable with Tasha." 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines' Tasha Taylor, two-time defending all-around champion, didn't 
compete. She is preparing for the Level 9 USGF nationals in Seattle this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The floor exercise was the closest event, with Nedjar's routine winning by .5 
over Fallbrook's Paige Peterman.

THE SENSITIVE ISSUE OF BRESLIN'S REMARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone who knows Jimmy Breslin's history knows Ji-Yeon Yuh was born into a 
better world because of the eloquent integrity Breslin shoved down our throats 
when times were tougher. 
</P>
<P>
When Yuh faces off with Breslin, she confronts a friend with her back to her 
enemies. 
</P>
<P>
She and the cause of women and minorities are subtly hurt daily by the hate, 
incompetence, insensitivity and/or lies of some syndicated columnists; those 
writers do a lot of harm without the use of any ethnic slurs or sexist remarks. 
And they are enjoying a big gloat now because a guy who really cares is having 
his troubles. 
</P>
<P>
True, Breslin needs to watch his mouth, but that big mouth hurt only her 
feelings and that's between him and her. The editors' lack of guts to stand 
behind him, at least out of respect for his monumental contribution to a better 
world, hurt his feelings. Let's try to get substance back in focus.

READER CITES EVIL OF MILLS COLLEGE PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Observing the behavior of Mills College students ("Quiet Riot," May 16) fills 
me with despair and disgust. Despair when I think of those thousands of brave 
and caring women around the world who regularly put their lives on the line in 
the battle for freedom and also who regularly fight against overwhelming odds 
such cruel social ills as rampant hunger, lack of medical care, and 
overwhelming poverty. 
</P>
<P>
The real evil here is the scandalous cost of higher education in the United 
States -- $21,000 a year for tuition, board, and room is too high to pay to any 
institution. If we really cared about young people in this country, college and 
university educations would be wholly subsidized and made available to women 
and men on the basis of merit.

THE SENSITIVE ISSUE OF BRESLIN'S REMARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While finding Breslin's remarks offensive, I think I'm equally offended by 
those that defend him. I'm referring to his editors. They are quoted as saying, 
he was "guilty of atrocious judgment, but was neither racist nor sexist." 
</P>
<P>
What do these editors think racist and sexist means? 
</P>
<P>
(Editor) Don Forst remarked in reference to the reaction of employees, "They 
(the protesting reporters) had come to the aid station seeking morphine for the 
wound they felt had been inflicted on them, and we were saying the wound wasn't 
that serious or grievous. In our view it required aspirin." It is not 
appropriate for Forst to define others' reality. This is a judgment on his 
part, one he is not qualified to make. It also implies that people don't know 
their own reality. How patronizing. How unnecessary. How typical. 
</P>
<P>
Words spoken in haste reflect more than a moment of bad temper. Words spoken in 
haste, as well as words that are well chosen, influence and reinforce lifelong 
attitudes. We need to see words as a reflection of our values and beliefs and 
be responsible for them. 
</P>
<P>
And we need to be honest in examining them. Words are powerful and when used to 
express sexist and racist ideas remind women and people of color of a whole 
history of personal and societal exploitation, oppression, powerlessness and 
pain.

AN EXPLORATION OF HISTORY AND OF THE HUMAN SOUL; 
</P>
<P>
THE PRINCESS AND THE DRAGON BY ROBERTO PAZZI TRANSLATED FROM ITALIAN BY M.J. 
FITZGERALD ALFRED A. KNOPF $18.95, 160 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER, TIMES BOOK CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fall of the Romanov dynasty, and the death of Czar Nicholas II and his 
family in the Bolshevik Revolution, have given Roberto Pazzi a vantage point 
for his sustained exploration of history and the human soul. For this subtle 
and poetic Italian novelist, the two are intricately joined. History expresses 
our conscious and unconscious lives, and shapes them. 
</P>
<P>
Pazzi's history has a pliability of a dream; and both "Searching for the 
Emperor," published here last year, and his new "The Princess and the Dragon" 
move on the dreams and illusions of marginal, half-invented historical figures. 
Beyond dreamer and dream is something that moves both and that we never see. 
Pazzi is partly a religious writer, and perhaps this explains why he chooses 
the Romanovs for his fictions. 
</P>
<P>
To his subjects, the czar was the promise that God would be with them. 
Possessing no extraordinary vision or talents, the Romanovs had to be the 
narrow and not especially well-made containment vessel for two mighty and 
unmanageable forces: God and the Russian people. 
</P>
<P>
The dream machine in "Searching for the Emperor" was a White Russian regiment 
that wandered for years in Siberia, imagining that it was on the way to save an 
emperor still in power. In the new book, it is Nicholas' brother, George, an 
invalid prince confined on an estate by the Black Sea. Nicholas, ruling in St. 
Petersburg, wears the Romanov power, but George wears its divine authority. 
Divine authority proclaims that the dynasty is ill. In 1899, in the gardens of 
Livadia, George is prophet and pioneer of that illness. He is there to sleep -- 
the book ends with his final sleep -- before the dynasty does; to dream its 
past and future; and to be the prisoner waiting for death that Nicholas would 
become 20 years later. 
</P>
<P>
Pazzi, who writes with a delicacy that is sweet and pungent by turns, describes 
the waking moments of a prince whose sensibility was so fine that Pope Leo XIII 
declared that he was more fit to be a Pope than a king. Half free, half not -- 
Prince Ourousov, his chamberlain, is a spy for Nicholas -- he moves uneasily 
against the burden of being royal. 
</P>
<P>
Getting dressed -- putting on royalty -- is agony. In St. Petersburg, Nicholas 
wears his uniforms as a sign "of everything that was sacred in that immense and 
savage land." In Livadia, George's narrow wrists tremble against the cuffs of 
his dressing gown. "To dress for others seemed to him among the most real 
causes of his disease; he was aware that his waking led to an inevitable, 
perfectly rehearsed series of actions on the part of a dozen or so people in 
some wing of the palace." 
</P>
<P>
He plans, futilely, to escape to France where his cousin, Helen, is living. 
Their love is frowned upon by the czar; Helen is vital, alive, rebellious and 
free of history. Once, at a time when they were together, Helen watched his 
restless sleeping and reflected: "My love, what an effort History is for you." 
</P>
<P>
George's dreams of escape have him practice to pack everything he values in a 
single suitcase. History is not portable, though. His responsibilities as 
dreamer are too heavy for personal happiness. He moves to another estate in the 
mountains of Georgia. There, he begins the long series of visions that form the 
second half of the book. 
</P>
<P>
In company with Ourousov, he becomes a world and time traveler. He visits 
broken dynasties: Napoleon in St. Helena, Louis XVI at his beheading, the court 
of a Chinese emperor who has run off to find a fabled valley -- it is in 
Georgia, according to legend -- where death cannot find him. He moves forward 
to 1938 and tries to obtain his death certificate from an agitated Soviet 
bureaucrat. 
</P>
<P>
The slyly sinister figure of Ourousov swells to monstrous proportions. Someone 
calls him "the Creature" at one point. At another, an old cardinal recognizes 
him and recoils. If George is the dreamer of history, Ourousov is perhaps 
history itself. Visiting the dying Empress Catherine, he informs her that his 
creatures will eventually rule. In the Georgia mountains, he produces two 
monstrous shapes and introduces them to George. They are, or will be, Stalin 
and Brezhnev. 
</P>
<P>
Like "Searching for the Emperor," "The Princess and the Dragon" balances 
suggestiveness and a breathtaking symbolic grace upon a knife-edge of 
obscurity. In this case, the obscurity prevails more often, and the essentially 
static setting -- in contrast to the entranced wandering of the Siberian 
regiment -- makes us more aware of it. Here, the wandering tends to be 
reflection rather than reflection in action. The result can be arid even as it 
stretches and astonishes us.

Sexy "sex, lies, and videotape" leaped into the Top Five -- from No. 11 -- of 
the Billboard magazine rental chart after just three weeks on the chart. Though 
it started as an inexpensive, art-house movie, the critical raves and public 
interest in its seamy subject matter turned it into a money-maker ($24.6 
million gross). 
</P>
<P>
This is one of the rare films to make it to the Top Five without a big-name 
star -- though James Spader and Andie MacDowell, relative unknowns when this 
movie came out last year -- have become fairly popular since then. "The Little 
Mermaid" entered the chart at a relatively low No. 29 but could float into the 
Top 10 next week. Another potential rental hit, the Eddie Murphy comedy "Harlem 
Nights," also debuted low, No. 39, but could jump into the upper echelons next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
* Will people rent a Christmas movie in May? Apparently -- if it's part of 
Chevy Chase's wacky National Lampoon "Vacation" series. It debuted at No. 12 on 
the chart and may spring into the Top Five next week.

MiXed Signals: A Christian Broadcasting Network engineer in Norfolk, Va., 
pleaded innocent Wednesday to charges of using CBN equipment to send religious 
messages over the Playboy Channel and another cable operation. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Haynie is charged with satellite piracy in a six-count federal 
indictment. He is alleged to have substituted unauthorized messages over the 
channels in September, 1987. The messages stated: "Thus sayeth the Lord thy 
God. Remember the Sabath and keep it holy. Repent, the kingdom of God is at 
hand!" The evangelical warnings pre-empted a soft-porn movie on the Playboy 
Channel. GREG BRAXTON

'Hour Of Power' Outage?: The Rev. Robert H. Schuller says he will pull the plug 
on his "Hour of Power" worldwide TV ministry if viewers don't send in $3.2 
million to cover its debts. 
</P>
<P>
"What I said is not an exaggeration. We are that close to terminating the 
television ministries. . . . There's no money in the bank," Schuller said. He 
will warn viewers of the possible cancellation and launch a five-week 
fund-raising drive on Sunday's program. He blamed his financial problems on the 
rising costs of purchasing airtime. It costs $14 million annually to broadcast 
the show. GREG BRAXTON

WEST HOLLYWOOD'S GLOBE PLAYHOUSE PUTS BARD ON HOLD; 
</P>
<P>
THEATER: THIS STEADY SOURCE OF SHAKESPEARE IS SHUTTING DOWN PRODUCTION UNTIL IT 
RAISES $500,000. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Unless it raises $500,000, the Shakespeare Society of America won't produce 
Shakespeare again at the Globe Playhouse in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the society has been Los Angeles' -- perhaps even the world's -- 
steadiest source of Shakespeare stagings. The productions were never lavish. 
But the group staged all 37 plays in the standard Shakespeare canon, plus "The 
Two Noble Kinsmen," between 1975 and 1979 -- and then staged the 37 again 
between 1979 and 1985. Since 1985, the group has expanded its programming to 
include 12 of the "apocryphal" Shakespeare plays, ending with "The Merry Devil 
of Edmonton" last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Since "Edmonton" closed, however, the 99-seat Globe has been occupied solely by 
rental productions. What's happening? 
</P>
<P>
"We're on a hiatus while we're raising money," said Thad Taylor, the president 
and founder of the society and builder of the Globe. He expects to have a grant 
application package ready by the end of the month for perusal by corporations, 
foundations and government endowments. And he won't re-open until he has 
$500,000 "in the bank" -- enough, he said, to pay for a season of 6 to 8 plays 
that would run for 6 to 8 weeks each. 
</P>
<P>
It's a story of diminishing income and rising costs. Taylor, 65, personally 
financed nearly all of the society's previous work, he said. But he retired 
from an electrical engineering career in 1972 in order to produce Shakespeare 
full-time, and he said he hasn't had any substantial new income since an 
inheritance in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the cost of a single production has risen from $12,000-$15,000 in 
the last years of Equity Waiver (which ended in Oct. 1988) to $20,000-$25,000 
under Equity's 99-Seat Theater Plan, which requires the society to pay each 
actor minimal amounts per performance. And Taylor wants to go far beyond the 
union requirements; he wants to pay at least $125 a week to each actor. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been doing this for 25 years," he said. "It's time to step up the ladder. 
I want to pay everyone for their professionalism." That includes $10,000 to 
promote and advertise each production -- something he always managed without, 
in the past. Under his new policy, the cost of a single production would be 
$45,000-$55,000. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor especially hopes "the (entertainment) industry people in town who have 
cast their shows out of here" will remember his efforts and respond to his 
fund-raising campaign. His target for a re-opening is within the next year. 
</P>
<P>
NAACP NOMINEES: Three notable shows were absent from the list of nominees, 
announced Wednesday, for the theater awards of the Beverly Hills/Hollywood 
branch of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People. 
</P>
<P>
The awards cover shows that opened in the Los Angeles area between Aug. 1, 1988 
and Dec. 30, 1989. Garnering the most nominations were Long Beach Civic Light 
Opera's "Sophisticated Ladies" (13) on the Equity level, and Inner City 
Cultural Center's "Shadow Box" (9) in the category of "99 Seat Theater Plan and 
Special Shows." 
</P>
<P>
"Fences," "Joe Turner's Come and Gone" and "Eden" -- probably the most 
prominent plays on African-American themes presented during that period -- 
received no nominations. 
</P>
<P>
The 12 members of the NAACP panel of judges were not given tickets to those 
productions, explained committee chairperson Patricia Bell. 
</P>
<P>
Both "Joe" and "Eden" were Los Angeles Theatre Center productions -- yet 
another LATC show, "Three Ways Home," netted four nominations. "A budget 
crunch" in between the opening of "Three Ways" in February and the opening of 
"Joe" and "Eden" in April and May was the reason LATC cited for changing its 
policy, said Bell. But an LATC spokeswoman said "it was a matter of 
availability of house seats instead of budget cutbacks. We didn't have as many 
house seats as they needed." 
</P>
<P>
The awards will be presented June 25 at the Los Angeles Hilton Hotel, including 
special awards to Ted Lange, Helen Martin, Esther Rolle and Robert Guillaume. 
</P>
<P>
SUCH A DEAL: All tickets to Los Angeles Theatre Center productions will cost 
$10 during the holiday weekend, beginning tonight. That includes six regular 
performances of "The Illusion" and six of "Strong-Man's Weak Child," as well as 
three previews of Derek Walcott's "Viva Detroit." Normal ticket prices are $17 
for previews and $22-$26 for regular performances. 
</P>
<P>
VIVA THE NEW CAST: Speaking of "Detroit," the entire cast has changed from the 
originally announced Danny Glover, Carl Lumbly and Deirdre O'Connell. Replacing 
them are Robert Gossett, Moses Gunn and Gates McFadden. 
</P>
<P>
Glover bowed out because of conflicts with the filming of "Predator 2" and 
"Rage in Harlem." As for Lumbly, "Carl and Danny are old friends, and Carl was 
doing (the play) in order to do it with Danny," said Lumbly's agent Susan 
Schwarz. And O'Connell got a job in a feature film, "Souvenirs," with John 
Cougar Mellencamp. 
</P>
<P>
While Glover and Lumbly were planning on alternating roles, Gossett and Gunn 
will not. 
</P>
<P>
Lumbly won't be off local stages for long. He'll appear as one of "Miss Evers' 
Boys" in David Feldshuh's play of that name, July 19-Sept. 2, at the Mark Taper 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
BUS STOPPERS: It'll be Lea Thompson in "the Marilyn Monroe role" in William 
Inge's "Bus Stop" at Pasadena Playhouse, opening July 6. Daniel Reichert, 
currently in "Burn This" in San Francisco, will play Bo. 
</P>
<P>
PADUA HILLS SEASON: The application deadline for the writers' workshop half of 
the Padua Hills Playwrights' Workshop/Festival, which returns to Cal State 
Northridge June 25, has been extended until June 8. Information: (213) 
913-2636. 
</P>
<P>
The festival of plays, July 19-Aug. 12, will include a Thursday-Friday series 
with Kelly Stuart's "Ball and Chain," Martin Epstein's "Our Witness," John 
Steppling's "Storyland" and Susan Champagne's "Bondage," plus a Saturday-Sunday 
series with Roxanne Rogers' "Book of Dreams," Murray Mednick's "Shatter 'n 
Wade," Alan Bolt's "Salsa Opera" and Leon Martell's "Bricktime Stories." 
</P>
<P>
A Padua Hills benefit will be held June 30 at the Northridge campus.

Bluebeard had a reputation for marrying women and killing them. But, in the 
revisionist performance piece, "Bluebeard's Hassle: The Writhes of the Wives" 
at Sushi Performance Gallery, creator and performer Pat Oleszko tells a 
different story.

<P>
What if the wives didn't die, but just divorced Bluebeard and left his dark, 
dank castle to fulfill their own dreams?

A Guggenheim fellow with featured roles in "Bette Midler's Mondo Beyond" and 
"Crossing Delancey," Oleszko tells what really happened to the Free Little Pig, 
Oldilocks and the Three Bozos and So Wide and the Seventh Thwart, as Sushi's 
eighth annual Neofest continues today through Sunday at 852 8th Ave., San

KID BEAT: 'PRINCE'S' GOOD-NATURED MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The breezy, hurdy-gurdy hustle and bustle of the Santa Monica Pier is the 
offbeat, but appealing site of the lively "The Prince Who Wouldn't Talk," by 
James Brock, at the Waterfront Stage. 
</P>
<P>
The pleasantly shabby theater, redolent of cotton candy and popcorn, becomes 
home to a comical king and queen, three eccentric wizards, a sulky prince and a 
fair young maiden. 
</P>
<P>
It's a Story Theater-style fairy-tale with a message: if parents want their 
children to talk to them, they must learn to listen. 
</P>
<P>
The Prince (Anthony Mazzola) is tired of being talked over, ignored and cut 
off, so he has decided to say nothing at all -- ever. The tactic gets the 
attention of his parents, the King (MOYNi) and Queen (Dell Phinium), but they 
don't realize they're the problem -- they call in the wizards (Lawrence Levy, 
Joseph Sestay and John Blevins) to find out what's wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The wizards pronounce their misdiagnoses and institute various treatments, 
succeeding in getting the prince to honk like a horn, sing a lullaby that puts 
his parents instantly to sleep, and to just say "yes," causing the King to 
wonder how he'll be able to tell his son from the rest of his court. It's up to 
a fair young maiden (Katherine Burke) to set things straight. 
</P>
<P>
On the minimal set, director Frederique Michel keeps the action moving and the 
professional cast, including narrator C. Duncombe, is good-natured and 
energetic, with MOYNi's hearty King serving as its comic linchpin. It's a 
mostly light, amusing debut for the Waterfront Stage's new children's matinee 
series, weakened slightly by sketchy audience interaction -- the cast doesn't 
seem altogether comfortable with it. 
</P>
<P>
 At 250 Santa Monica Pier, Saturdays and Sundays, 2:30 p.m., through June 9. 
$5; (213) 393-6672.

Mickey Kanolzer is worried. Wolfgang Puck's childhood friend has munched his 
way through Spago's kitchen. He has managed Chinois on Main since the day it 
opened, watching elegant trays of sauteed foie gras and curried lobster as they 
are devoured by the rich and the famous. He has popped the corks on more 
bottles of Champagne than he cares to remember. He has eaten in the great 
restaurants of the world. Now, however, he's afraid he is going to get fat. 
</P>
<P>
"I love this food," he says, patting his growing belly. "And this beer . . . ." 
He takes a swig from an enormous mug and wipes the foam off his top lip. "This 
place . . ., " he says. Words momentarily fail him. ". . . It's going to be 
great!" 
</P>
<P>
It is Wolfgang Puck's enormous new Eureka Restaurant and Brewing Company, due 
to open any day on an unprepossessing lot behind a dress manufacturing plant in 
West L.A. The man who made fine food fun is now moving in a new direction. When 
he opened Spago, Puck took the starch out of elegant eating and turned the fine 
dining experience into a party. Now he's got his eye on everyday eating. Dinner 
time may never be the same. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Berger describes Eureka's beers, brewing techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Eureka, some three years in the planning, is a vast building. In the back, a 
pristine industrial space holds huge, gleaming, slightly menacing tanks of 
lager that lie in wait for the unwary. "Don't touch that!" shouts Kanolzer as 
somebody steps up to a spigot and begins to give it a spin. "It could explode 
on you." He runs off to find one of the experts who knows how to draw a tankard 
of beer. Kanolzer smiles expectantly as the amber liquid comes bubbling out of 
the vat; it is a gutsy, slightly sweet brew that tastes nothing like the wine 
Puck's food is accustomed to being served with. 
</P>
<P>
Tankard in hand, Kanolzer strolls toward the front of the building where Puck's 
wife, Barbara Lazaroff, is carving a metallic fantasy of a restaurant out of 
raw space. Etched glass bricks create walls and copper tubes snake across the 
bar. It's a breathlessly macho new take on upscale industrial that Lazaroff 
describes as "a great-looking guy on a Harley wearing a jacket with studs." 
</P>
<P>
Lazaroff points to a bar stool. "Sit," she commands. The seats don't look all 
that inviting; in fact they look like back breakers. But they curve to your 
spine, caress your legs; in spite of the way they look you find that you never 
want to get up. "Hand-carved," she says triumphantly, and goes off to inspect 
the bathrooms, where artist Mike Payne is installing tiles that create 
something of a Chaplinesque "Modern Times" look. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Puck is wandering nonchalantly around the kitchen, sticking little 
bits of this and that into his mouth and acting as if he had nothing to do with 
all of this. He is maddeningly vague about the menu. "I'll think about it next 
week," he says. "That's part of the fun. If we had known already what we would 
serve, what would have been the point in building this place?" 
</P>
<P>
"Tell her about Grandma Puck's cheese ravioli," urges Kanolzer. Puck relents; 
clearly he is more organized than he is willing to admit. "They'll be on the 
menu," he says. "But they're not like Italian ravioli. The dough is flour, not 
semolina. Inside it's cheese and potato, and there's brown butter on the top. 
It's a dish that comes from the town that we're from. It's not even an Austrian 
dish; it's a Carinthian regional specialty. And we'll have a couple of my 
mother's dishes too." 
</P>
<P>
So this beer food will be Austrian? Puck shrugs. "I imported a sausage maker 
from Munich . . .," he says. But it turns out that what he ended up making were 
anything but ordinary sausages. "At first," says head chef Jody Denton, "the 
sausage maker thought we were crazy when we wanted to put all these dates and 
chipotles into the sausage. Now he's so excited he wants to take the ideas 
home." 
</P>
<P>
Dates and chipotles in the sausage? This is Puck's idea of beer food? Puck 
nods. "We're playing around in the kitchen." He adds, "In Austria when we go 
out for a drink we have wine. When we eat, we drink beer. And you know, they 
drink beer all over the world. So when I thought about what to cook, I thought 
about what they eat with the beer. Thai, Mexican, Austrian . . . it's hard to 
think how the whole thing fits together. But there's no sense spending $1.5 
million on a restaurant and then just serving hamburgers." 
</P>
<P>
Sous-chef Kevin Ripley puts it a bit more succinctly. "We're trying to step 
away from trattoria food and lean toward soul food," he says. "We wanted things 
to be full-bodied, full-flavored." 
</P>
<P>
Mostly what you sense is that this is food that the chefs are emotionally 
involved with. Their eyes glow when they talk about the food that they just ate 
for lunch. They are eager to discuss the duck chili (which is, in fact, 
fabulous) and the Moroccan lamb sausages. And when pastry chef Melinda Bugarin 
discusses the desserts she says that they are "super-homey, American, and 
things that remind Wolf of his childhood." As she crimps pie shells in one part 
of the kitchen, a chef in another pulls lobster from its shell and mixes the 
meat with chiles for a sort of Thai lobster dim sum. Meanwhile Puck is staring 
into a huge caldron of simmering oxtails. "Take out the bone," he says to a 
cook; "stuff the tails with bread dumplings and continue to cook them. They'll 
be good." 
</P>
<P>
What else is on the menu? Plenty. The restaurant, which will be open seven days 
a week for both lunch and dinner, seats 180 people. Prices, Puck says, will be 
about half those of Spago. There will be pizza. Lots of sausage. Ribs. Homemade 
mozzarella. "A hamburger for lunch," says Puck, "and sometimes a hot dog. Why 
not?" 
</P>
<P>
He looks around the kitchen and smiles. "At Spago we buy more white truffles 
than any other restaurant in Los Angeles. Even the Italian ones. But this is 
different." Over his shoulder Kanolzer smiles. Sausages dance in his eyes; he 
loves the difference. He is probably going to get fat. But he is going to be 
very happy while he does it. 
</P>
<P>
 Eureka is at 1845 S. Bundy in West Los Angeles. (213) 447-8000. It is slated 
to open next week.

MOVABLE FEASTS: A POWER LUNCH TO GO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There I was, thinking the Power Lunch had been conquered by the Power 
Breakfast, and pining for the days of roast alligator washed down with Vittel 
at the Four Seasons in New York. Then I got a press release announcing that 
"The Ultimate Power Lunch" -- the " 'Tray Chic' Executive Lunch" -- is alive 
and well and waiting to be consumed in the City of Industry. 
</P>
<P>
Wait, there's more. Not only can you get a "U.P.L." at Frere Jacques, you can 
order it by the Ultimate Power Communications Device, FAX. And if you select 
the $9.95 three-course lunch (a la carte is available too), you get to play . . 
. bingo. Or hardball too, I'm sure. 
</P>
<P>
Frere Jacques turned out to be a French-Continental restaurant in a comfortable 
old converted roadhouse, but I resolutely stayed in the bar and ordered my 
Power Food to go. Here's how it works: The appetizers are lettered, the entrees 
are numbered, and you mix and match. I put my money on "C10," the peppery, 
moist, pistachio-studded terrine de pate Frere Jacques and the smoked Nova 
Scotia salmon sandwich with creamy salmon, sweet light pumpernickel and a 
shower of onions and capers. 
</P>
<P>
Seafood crepes, quiche and two chicken dishes are the hot lunch meals. Except 
for an order of split pea soup with ham, which was rich, smoky and dense, I 
stayed with the cold offerings. Other than "C10," I regret to say, everything I 
sampled was less than executive material. 
</P>
<P>
Duckling liver mousse au Porto was one strong, grainy, livery note. Conversely, 
the "fresh tarragon dressing" on the plain green Salad Maison was milky and 
weak. Monte Carlo Salad was a hodgepodge of lettuce, green and red peppers, 
visible but flavorless squid and a strong vinegar tang. "La Salade Laurie," a 
generous mixture of chicken, crisp walnuts and diced apples was all mucked up 
with too much dressing, too many unannounced onions and none of the advertised 
string beans. 
</P>
<P>
Dessert was the saving grace. There was a moist cheesecake with an intelligent 
raspberry-Cognac sauce and a delightful homemade pear and custard tarte. 
</P>
<P>
The press release said that "selected choices" from the regular dinner menu 
could be ordered for take-out "simply by calling in advance." While it turned 
out to be an unusual request -- most of their take-out orders are at lunch -- 
Jacques himself guided me through the menu, noting the entrees he thought would 
travel well. But there was no way to pack the bouillabaisse, he said. What if I 
bring my own bowl? Then fine. (When, whoops, I forgot the bowl, he graciously 
had it packed in several soup containers.) 
</P>
<P>
On the plus side, portions are very generous, ingredients fresh and prices 
reasonable. Roasted duckling, which did travel well, was moist, not at all 
fatty, and crowned with gently sauteed apples. A tender slab of calamari steak 
came with a light, robustly flavored garlic, black olive and basil sauce. The 
garlic toasts that accompanied a salty fish soup were absolutely swell. 
</P>
<P>
But one of my dining companions hit the nail on the head when he innocently 
asked "Is this supposed to be French?" No. You'd never mistake this soulless 
assemblage of pork chop, chicken, good fennel sausage and white beans in an 
excessively sweet sauce (I thought of Boston beans), for a passionate, 
stock-infused cassoulet. And though the bouillabaisse contained big lovely 
pieces of salmon and a profusion of tender crab claws, the broth, thin and 
terribly salty, made Marseilles seem very far away. 
</P>
<P>
There is something compelling about an old road house turned French-Continental 
restaurant, set as it is in this industrial no-man's land. The low lights are 
cozy, the staff is warm. There's even a signed picture of Gina Lollobrigida on 
the wall. It's a perfect period movie-set place. 
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere is great. But unfortunately, when you order take-out you don't 
get to take the atmosphere with you. Come to think of it, when you order 
take-out a power lunch pretty much loses its point. 
</P>
<P>

ASPARAGUS BEARS THE FRESH FLAVOR OF SPRING; 
</P>
<P>
LEGUMES: VERSATILE VEGETABLE REMAINS IN SEASON TILL SUMMER AND SUPPLIES ARE 
GOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Feast.

<TEXT>
<P>
When we think of seasonal spring vegetables several come to mind -- peas, fava 
beans, artichokes, the first tender salad greens, emerging shoots of herbs, and 
green garlic, the bulbs not yet formed. 
</P>
<P>
But the vegetable I most associate with spring is asparagus. We use garlic at 
all times of year, frozen peas taste fine, herbs don't really come on strong 
until summer, artichokes are more or less available year-round and fava beans 
are a bit esoteric as vegetables go. 
</P>
<P>
Asparagus, though, covers the full extent of the spring season. The precise 
month it emerges in our region of the country may vary from the end of winter 
to the beginning of summer, but both ends of the market season are usually 
extended with imports, giving us a generous supply that begins in February and 
continues through June. 
</P>
<P>
Asparagus is the first green vegetable to appear that gives relief from winter 
produce, and its fresh green taste is really welcome. This is the time of year 
I like to eat it very simply, blanched and served with sweet butter and maybe a 
squeeze of lemon juice, so that its own singular taste can be enjoyed without 
interference from other strong flavors. 
</P>
<P>
As the season moves on and the price of asparagus begins to drop, I begin to 
feel easier about exploring its other possibilities. Asparagus lends itself to 
all types of cooking. Though excellent blanched, it can be baked, served cold 
as a salad, stewed with other vegetables to make a soup or ragout, grilled over 
coals, cooked in risotto, baked in a tart or folded into an omelet. 
</P>
<P>
It is a very versatile vegetable that adapts comfortably to the different 
flavors of herbs and oils, such as olive, peanut, sesame and walnut oils. All 
are good with asparagus and each one makes a very different tasting kind of 
dish. 
</P>
<P>
Quite a lot has been made about the proper way to cook asparagus; there are 
special pans designed that allow the tougher stem ends to be submerged in the 
boiling water while the tender tips are merely steamed. 
</P>
<P>
I've always found that asparagus cooks quite well in either a large kettle or a 
skillet of boiling water, and I don't worry about the tough ends. I do what I 
can beforehand -- breaking off the fibrous ends and peeling the thicker stalks. 
</P>
<P>
In a restaurant situation, I find it useful to tie individual servings into 
bundles and blanch them. When they are done, I snip the string, leaving the 
asparagus lined up with the tips pointing in the same direction. At home, I 
don't bother with the string. I think the asparagus cooks better when loose, 
and the time it takes to arrange it allows it to cool to a better temperature 
for eating. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanched asparagus can either be dressed while warm and served with a covering 
of thin shavings of Parmesan cheese or cooked beforehand and later broiled with 
butter and cheese. The heat of the asparagus will soften the cheese and bring 
out its wonderful flavor. 
</P>
<P>
ASPARAGUS WITH BROWN BUTTER AND PARMESAN CHEESE 
</P>
<P>
2 pounds thick or thin asparagus 
</P>
<P>
4 to 5 tablespoons butter 
</P>
<P>
Boiling salted water 
</P>
<P>
Parmesan cheese, preferably Parmigiano Reggiano, thinly shaved 
</P>
<P>
Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
Snap off tough ends of asparagus and trim stalks neatly. Peel stalks, if thick. 
</P>
<P>
Melt butter in small pan or skillet over low heat. Cook until it begins to 
color and take on nutty aroma. Skim off foam and discard. 
</P>
<P>
Add asparagus to several quarts boiling salted water. Cook until bright green, 
tender but still firm, about 3 minutes for thin asparagus and about 5 minutes 
for thick. Remove asparagus from water and drain quickly on clean towel. 
</P>
<P>
Arrange on platter. Drizzle melted butter over top and scatter with shavings of 
Parmesan cheese. Dust lightly with pepper and serve. Makes 4 to 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: If preparing ahead of time, either keep asparagus slightly underdone or 
rinse under cold water to stop cooking. When ready to eat, drizzle butter and 
shaved cheese over top. Place dish few inches under broiler and heat until 
cheese is melted and lightly colored and asparagus is warm. Sprinkle lightly 
with pepper and serve. 
</P>
<P>
 It may seem unusual to grill asparagus, but it's very good this way. If 
possible, use thick asparagus. The stalks need to cook very slowly over a 
medium-low charcoal fire in order to be thoroughly cooked. The sauce of 
hard-cooked eggs mixed with olive oil, vinegar, shallots and capers has a rich 
velvety texture but isn't as rich as mayonnaise. This is a delicious dish that 
would make a special first course for an outdoor spring meal. 
</P>
<P>
GRILLED ASPARAGUS WITH EGG AND CAPER SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
2 pounds thick asparagus 
</P>
<P>
Boiling salted water 
</P>
<P>
Light olive oil 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Few handfuls red mustard leaves, optional 
</P>
<P>
Sauce 
</P>
<P>
Break off tough ends of asparagus and trim ends even with knife. Parboil in 
boiling salted water about 1 minute. Rinse to stop cooking and drain. Brush 
stalks lightly with olive oil. Season to taste with salt. 
</P>
<P>
Grill over slow fire, turning asparagus to cook evenly on all sides. (To test 
for doneness, pierce stalks with sharp point of knife -- they should be firm 
but knife should penetrate easily.) 
</P>
<P>
Arrange grilled asparagus on platter or individual plates lined with red 
mustard leaves. Ladle Sauce over all and serve. Makes 4 to 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Sauce 
</P>
<P>
2 hard-cooked eggs 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 
</P>
<P>
2 to 3 tablespoons tarragon or Champagne vinegar 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons capers, rinsed 
</P>
<P>
1 large shallot, finely diced 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
Finely chopped chervil or parsley 
</P>
<P>
Separate egg whites from yolks and chop finely. Combine eggs, oil, vinegar, 
capers and shallot in bowl. Season to taste with salt, pepper and chervil. Toss 
gently. Yolks and oil will gradually emulsify to give sauce body. 
</P>
<P>
 Pink-colored onions and fine slivers of orange peel in the green sauce look 
and taste like spring. Since the pickled onions take only a minute or two to 
prepare, start with them if you haven't any on hand. They will have colored by 
the time you're ready for them. 
</P>
<P>
 This salad also makes a beautiful opening to a meal, or combined with some 
dressed greens and perhaps some hard-cooked eggs it might be offered as a meal 
in itself. The sauce can be made ahead of time, the orange juice and vinegar 
added at the very end so that the greens remain bright and snappy. This sauce 
is also good over grilled asparagus. 
</P>
<P>
ASPARAGUS SALAD WITH GREEN SAUCE AND PICKLED ONIONS 
</P>
<P>
2 pounds thick or thin asparagus 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Green Sauce 
</P>
<P>
Reserved orange slivers from Green Sauce 
</P>
<P>
Pickled Red Onion Rings 
</P>
<P>
Chive blossoms, optional 
</P>
<P>
Trim asparagus by snapping off tough ends. If asparagus is thick, peel stalks. 
Bring several quarts water to boil, add salt to taste and asparagus and cook 
until bright green, tender, but still little firm, about 3 minutes for thin 
asparagus or 5 minutes for thick. Rinse asparagus briefly in cool water, then 
place stalks on towel to drain. 
</P>
<P>
Arrange asparagus on platter or individual serving plates. Ladle Green Sauce 
over and garnish with reserved slivers of orange zest and Pickled Red Onion 
Rings. Scatter few chive blossoms over all. Makes 4 first-course, 2 or 3 
main-course servings. 
</P>
<P>
Variation: Make salad with scented sesame or peanut oil, or with mixture of 
walnut and olive oils. These flavors all go well with asparagus and harmonize 
with orange. 
</P>
<P>
Green Sauce 
</P>
<P>
1 orange 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup chopped parsley, chervil or cilantro 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon capers, rinsed 
</P>
<P>
Several tablespoons drained and finely diced Pickled Red Onion Rings 
</P>
<P>
4 to 5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon mustard 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon fresh orange juice 
</P>
<P>
White wine or champagne vinegar 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
Peel off zest from orange into long wide band. Cut into fine slivers and blanch 
10 seconds. Reserve half for asparagus garnish. Place remaining half orange 
slivers in bowl and combine with parsley, capers and Pickled Red Onion Rings. 
Stir in oil, mustard, orange juice and vinegar. Season to taste with salt and 
pepper. 
</P>
<P>
 These pretty pink onions enliven salads of all kinds, sandwiches, cold pasta, 
rice dishes and eggs. They're also great served alongside whatever else is on 
the table. They'll keep well, refrigerated, a week or longer. 
</P>
<P>
Pickled Red Onion Rings 
</P>
<P>
1 pound red onions 
</P>
<P>
About 1 quart boiling water 
</P>
<P>
1 cup white wine vinegar 
</P>
<P>
1 cup cold water 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon sugar 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
2 bay leaves 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon mixed peppercorns, slightly crushed 
</P>
<P>
Few fresh marjoram or thyme sprigs, crushed, or few dashes dried 
</P>
<P>
Slice red onions into thin rounds. Separate into rings and place in colander. 
Pour boiling water over. Drain and place in bowl. Add wine vinegar, cold water, 
sugar, salt, bay leaves, peppercorns and marjoram. Cover and refrigerate. Color 
will begin to infuse in about 15 minutes. Drain few rings and finely dice 
several tablespoons for Green Sauce. Reserve remaining for asparagus garnish. 
Makes 2 cups. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of such a simple dish depends entirely on the quality of the 
ingredients, particularly the oil, which should be one of those peanut oils 
that has the heady fragrance of freshly roasted peanuts. They are equivalent in 
style to the best olive oils. For variety, try using cilantro instead of 
parsley and garnish the asparagus with toasted black sesame seeds. 
</P>
<P>
ASPARAGUS WITH PEA- NUT OIL, SHALLOTS AND PARSLEY 
</P>
<P>
2 pounds asparagus 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
2 to 3 teaspoons peanut oil or to taste 
</P>
<P>
2 small shallots, finely diced 
</P>
<P>
Finely chopped parsley, preferably Italian 
</P>
<P>
Snap off tough ends of asparagus at point where they naturally break and trim 
broken parts with knife. If asparagus is very thick, peel lower ends. 
</P>
<P>
Bring large kettle of water to boil, add salt to taste and asparagus. Cook 
until asparagus is bright green, tender but slightly firm, about 5 minutes, 
depending on thickness of vegetable. 
</P>
<P>
Remove asparagus from water and place on clean towel to drain briefly. In large 
bowl combine asparagus with oil, shallots and parsley. Toss until mixed. 
Arrange on platter and serve. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 This soup makes the most of new spring vegetables and herbs when they are 
still a little scarce and not yet old hat. A couple of handfuls of sorrel, 
melted with leeks, tastes wonderful with the rest of the vegetables, though it 
will give the soup a slightly dingy, army-green color. 
</P>
<P>
 To bring out the flavors of the vegetables, use the trimmings (leek greens, 
asparagus stems and pea pods) to make a simple stock. It is cooked only 20 
minutes so that the fresh taste of the vegetables is retained. If using frozen 
peas, use some in the stock in place of the pea pods. 
</P>
<P>
ASPARAGUS AND PEA SOUP 
</P>
<P>
1 pound thin asparagus, trimmed 
</P>
<P>
4 small leeks, white parts only (about 8 ounces when trimmed) 
</P>
<P>
1 pound fresh sweet pea pods 
</P>
<P>
1 quart water 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
5 sprigs parsley 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>
2 handfuls sorrel leaves, stems removed, leaves sliced, optional 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons flour 
</P>
<P>
2 cups milk 
</P>
<P>
1/2 to 1 cup half and half or whipping cream, optional 
</P>
<P>
Garnish: several fresh basil or sorrel leaves, finely sliced; thinly sliced 
rounds of chives and blossoms; or chopped chervil 
</P>
<P>
Slice top third of asparagus stalks diagonally, leaving tips whole. (If using 
thicker asparagus, cut tips in half, lengthwise.) Set aside. Coarsely chop 
remaining two-thirds of stalks for stock. Select 3 or 4 inches of most tender 
part of leek greens, rinse well and chop coarsely. Discard remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Bring water to boil and add salt to taste. Blanch asparagus tips and sliced 
stems until nearly tender, rinse in cold water and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Select couple of handfuls of best-looking pea pods, chop and reserve. Shuck 
remaining pods and blanch peas in same boiling water (reserve shucked pods). 
Rinse in cold water and set aside. (If peas are very small and tender, they 
don't have to be blanched. Or use 1 1/2 cups frozen green peas). 
</P>
<P>
Using same vegetable water, add asparagus stems, leek greens, shucked pea pods 
and parsley sprigs. (If using frozen peas, add 1/3 cup of them as well.) Reduce 
heat and simmer 20 minutes, then strain out vegetables and discard. Set stock 
aside. 
</P>
<P>
Thinly slice white part of leeks and rinse well. Melt butter in saucepan. Add 
leeks along with any water clinging to them and 1/2 teaspoon salt. If using 
sorrel, add now. Cook gently until leeks and sorrel have begun to soften, about 
10 minutes, then stir in flour. Mix well, then whisk in strained stock. Bring 
to boil, then simmer 20 minutes, stirring occasionally to make sure flour 
doesn't stick to bottom. Puree soup in blender until smooth. 
</P>
<P>
Transfer mixture to sauceppan. Add milk and partially cooked asparagus and peas 
(or remaining 1 cup frozen peas). Cook just until soup is at serving 
temperature. Adjust seasonings to taste. If necessary, thin soup with 
additional stock or water, or stir in half and half to enrich. Season to taste 
with pepper. Serve with fresh herbs scattered over top. Makes about 6 cups.

CAPSAICIN: THE INCENDIARY INGREDIENT IN HOT PEPPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

What makes a hot pepper hot? 
</P>
<P>
The incendiary ingredient, called capsaicin, is a powerful organic chemical 
that torches the tongue and irritates nerve endings in the mouth and nose. 
</P>
<P>
Capsaicin is highly concentrated in a pepper's central membrane, which holds 
the seeds. Despite a burning taste, hot peppers can help cool the body by 
fostering perspiration. 
</P>
<P>
The family of capsicum peppers is usually divided into sweet (bell) and hot 
(such as cayenne, chili or Tabasco). These are not to be confused with black or 
white pepper, which are condiments obtained from the dried fruits of East 
Indian vine plants. The peppers are close relatives of the eggplant, Irish 
potato and tomato. Archeologists have found evidence of capsicum pepper seeds 
at Tehuacan, Mexico, dated before 5000 B.C. 
</P>
<P>
Although hot peppers can reduce even the most avid pepper enthusiast to a 
wheezing, eye-watering mess, they generally cause no harm to the stomach, 
according to Arnold G. Levy, a Silver Spring, Md., gastroenterologist. 
</P>
<P>
The exceptions are red chili peppers and spicy Indian curry. Curry powder is 
prepared from turmeric and other spices such as coriander, cumin and cayenne 
pepper. "We have scientifically documented that these two foods can cause 
gastritis, but we don't know why," says Levy. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts speculate that capsaicin stimulates production of acid in the 
stomach and therefore causes indigestion. Of course, too much of anything can 
be harmful. Capsaicin is a chemical irritant to the body in extremely high 
doses, says Antone R. Opekun, a physician's assistant at Baylor College of 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Whether hot peppers are whole or ground up in sauces, Americans enjoy their 
piquancy. From 1984 to 1988, Americans consumed about 155 million pounds of hot 
spices, which include hot peppers, according to the American Spice Trade Assn.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: LA FONDA: AS COLOMBIAN AS APPLE POP 
</P>

Restaurant surrealism is strange and wonderful, and extremely hard to find. The 
Hollywood pizzeria that looks like it came out of the seduction scene in "Lady 
and the Tramp" is definitely surreal. The Pico pupuseria half taken up by a 
plaster-cat-encrusted religious shrine probably qualifies, and so does the 
stevedores' bar in San Pedro where the waitresses wear frilly lingerie. You 
can't plan it, even if you're a famous architect -- Noa Noa and Kate Mantilini 
are just places to eat, no matter how much they cost. 
</P>
<P>
La Fonda Antioquena is a clean, well-lighted place on the seedy end of Melrose, 
an oasis of track-lighting and pink tablecloths among bodegas and Thai video 
stores. The restaurant specializes in the cooking of the Colombian state of 
Antioquia -- you may have heard of its capital, Medellin, in a context totally 
unrelated to food. 
</P>
<P>
Large, eerie oil paintings on the walls present one Colombian artist's oddly 
paranoiac view of Colombian capitalism. (Dining among all these paintings of 
grotesquely distended businessmen is an unsettling experience, somehow 
appropriate for a supper apres-Twin Peaks.) The customers tend to be either 
well-dressed Colombian couples or unreconstructed Anglo counterculture types. 
And Colombians steam steaks, which might be surreal enough all by itself. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant used to be located in a storefront that it shared with a bird 
shop. Some afternoons you could barely hear the tango music for the tweets and 
squawks. Before that, it occupied the plant-cloaked converted gas station on 
Virgil that later became a Salvadoran diner named Mr. Cafe, and then Cha Cha 
Cha. I loved the food at La Fonda, but I rarely went into the place . . . the 
chalkboard menu was written in idiomatic Colombian Spanish, and nobody there 
ever seemed to be able to tell me what to expect if I ordered bandeja or Ave 
Maria bues. (Too often I ordered meals that turned out to be composed of all 
innards, or of six variations on the thick Colombian corn cake called arepa.) 
</P>
<P>
Plus, it was about a third more expensive than other ethnic restaurants. I 
usually ordered the terrific grilled sausage called morcilla, kind of a sweetly 
spiced Spanish boudin, because I knew what it was and I hadn't found anything 
like it in L.A. But though the restaurant was literally around the corner from 
my apartment, it somehow made me feel like an Ugly American tourist imposing on 
the locals of a foreign city. 
</P>
<P>
Now, suddenly, La Fonda is on Melrose and everybody here speaks perfect 
English, cheerfully so. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't finish your dinner, no TV for you," the waiter said, pointing at 
a half-eaten bowl of the Colombian tripe stew called mondongo. 
</P>
<P>
"But I ate all of the tripe," my friend said. 
</P>
<P>
The waiter shuddered. "Brrrr," he said, "I won't eat that. It comes from the 
inside of a cow." 
</P>
<P>
The waiter, a lumbering man, wears a huge sword in a scabbard on one hip, an 
embroidered purse on the other, as if he'd taken a wrong turn and landed there 
instead of the medieval theme restaurant down the street. When you come in and 
sit down, he lugs over the man-sized menu slate, to which he gestures like a 
first-grade teacher leading a phonics drill. If he likes you, he might persuade 
you to order his favorite Colombian soda pop, Manzana, which tastes a little 
like fresh apples. If you don't understand something, he'll pull out a Xeroxed 
crib sheet explaining that saucocho is oxtail stew, and that bandeja is a 
traditional Colombian cowboy's platter of broiled steak, rice and arepa, topped 
with a fried egg and a leathery strip of fried pig's hide, which the crib sheet 
calls "bacon (Colombian Style)." He'll insist that you order the small fried 
turnovers, empanadas. 
</P>
<P>
And you should: greaseless and crisp-crusted, corny and stuffed with a creamy 
forcemeat, they come with a dip of cool, Colombian salsa that seems to be 
mostly chopped scallion tops, chiles and salt. Empanadas are all the appetizer 
La Fonda needs (or seems to have on a regular basis, for that matter), superior 
to both the wonderful version at Cafe Mambo and to those served at the numerous 
Argentine Westside empanadarias 
</P>
<P>
If you think of the meat as kind of a pot roast, the steaming of steaks might 
seem less barbaric, and the carne sudada here is good, a cumin-scented eye of 
round stained yellow with achiote and topped with stewed tomatoes and onions. 
Sobrebarriga is more or less the same thing done with brisket; lengua in salsa 
-- rich, salty, with the gelatinous intensity of long-cooked meat -- is the 
best variant, made with beef tongue. 
</P>
<P>
If you prefer meat grilled, you might consider Ave Maria bues, which comes with 
just about everything else: a thin, plate-size marinated steak, tasting 
strongly of the grill; a dense, spicy chorizo sausage; a dinner salad with a 
strong vinaigrette; a thick, smoky pinto bean stew (awesome!); fried plantains; 
rice; arepa, and the inevitable strip of pigskin. The crib sheet translates 
this surreally large mass of food as the "holy cow" plate. Dali would have 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
 La Fonda Antioquena, 4903 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles; (213) 962-2853. Open 
daily, 10 a.m.-10 p.m. Beer and wine. Parking in rear. American Express 
accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $15-$25.

CHANGE OF PRESCRIPTION IN ORDER FOR MEALTIMES; 
</P>
<P>
TRENDS: HOSPITAL FARE USED TO BE BASIC BLAND. BUT MANY HOSPITALS ARE NOW 
RESPONDING TO PATIENTS' COMPLAINTS AND PREPARING MORE APPETIZING MEALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Hospital food was long the culinary cellar of America, always maligned, ever 
dreary and gastronomically as flat as stale ginger ale. The miracle was that 
the genre transcended regions: It was invariably mealy, cold and stodgy 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the style, if not all the content, has changed drastically. Your 
friendly local general hospital is likely to offer you a radiant little plastic 
platter adorned with more than a few flourishes. 
</P>
<P>
Along with it will be a respectably complex series of menu options, including 
dinner wines (your doctor permitting). Hospital gourmet, if that is what it is, 
has arrived. 
</P>
<P>
I recently had an extended chance to sample the new look in bedside fare. On 
the morning after a serious session in the operating room, I was offered a fine 
and juicy pork tenderloin for lunch without even asking for it, plus golden 
roast potatoes and gravy. Great. One option was a glass of wine with dinner. 
</P>
<P>
What has prompted this sudden civilizing of the often-scorned dietetic world? 
</P>
<P>
Richard Carpe, a hospital consultant, thinks the new culinary trend is natural. 
"Food is one of the biggest single areas of complaints that patients have," he 
says. "When you are hospitalized, the one thing you look forward to is a meal." 
</P>
<P>
The gourmet trend is a "response to patients' higher expectations," says 
Richard Gluch, associate director of nutrition for the Johns Hopkins Hospital 
in Baltimore. "We have a wide range of patients from around the world and we 
try to enhance the quality of their stay," he adds. The program began more than 
10 years ago and now offers special meals for visiting family members or guests 
and meals that can be ordered for a friend who is a patient. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the U.S. public has begun to associate good, fresh food with good 
health and a reasonable diet also helps. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, there is no built-in conflict between fine dining and a healthy 
convalescent diet -- and perhaps the reverse may be true. Elegant melons, for 
instance, are rated among the most nutritious of all fruits. Fresh strawberries 
are low-cal bombs of essential Vitamin C. And daily food preparation itself 
means that kitchens will tend to lean on fresh rather than processed or 
packaged types of offerings, with their chemical and non-natural features. 
</P>
<P>
Who chooses the deluxe meals, most of which, but not all, involve a premium 
charge over trays provided in a routine room stay? Pat Messick, director of 
nutrition services at Baltimore's Union Memorial hospital, says, "new mothers 
celebrating a birth, less critical cases, a broken leg, or someone who feels 
fine but can't get around much are the kind of patients that enjoy the 
hospital's gourmet offering." 
</P>
<P>
At Union Memorial the options are built around three entrees of classic sort: a 
stuffed fillet of sole, a chicken Wellington and a Delmonico steak. "The steak 
is the most popular," says the nutrition director. Sherry or other wine will be 
served, with written permission from the doctor. There's no particular reason 
why the wine is or is not offered on such menus. "But it is an appetite 
enhancer," says Messick, "and it's a way of making an institutional setting a 
little more warm and personal." 
</P>
<P>
At Baltimore's Franklin Square hospital, young mothers get prime rib, or a 
boned, stuffed chicken breast with potatoes au gratin, salad and fresh 
broccoli. Cheesecake or chocolate cake are the dessert options. At the same 
institution, even the regular menu reveals a gourmet touch featuring such items 
as cod with toasted almonds, herb and cheese quiches, croissants and beef 
stroganoff and sirloin tips simmered in a mushroom-Burgundy sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Buttery chicken Kiev, beef tenderloins, crab and shrimp stuffed snapper, 
rissole potatoes and wines or beer are among the offerings at Greater Baltimore 
Medical Center in a gourmet meal option that costs $15. 
</P>
<P>
A new Johns Hopkins menu in preparation will star a fruit cup or salad, filet 
mignon, lamb chops, broiled or baked flounder and chicken cordon bleu with 
Black Forest tortes and a Vienna-style walnut layer cake among the desserts. 
The tab is $15, a price that probably few restaurants could match for the same 
dishes. Hopkins even has a snack-style menu for two, an accommodation to 
visitors, spouses and parents. Six options range in price from $5 (for a 
vegetable plate and dip) to $8 (for fruit and cheese or antipasto or wine). 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the hospital good-food trend has proliferated into a good many 
trimmings that would have been unheard of in the old days. A check of published 
reports from across the country shows that some institutions give a free 
take-home dinner to new parents fresh from the OB ward. Boston's Norwood 
hospital freezes the offerings in oven-proof containers, meals starring beef 
Wellington, stuffed chicken breast or baked stuffed shrimp. The farewell dinner 
packs also come with a split of either Champagne or sparkling cider. 
</P>
<P>
The send-'em-home-happy trend has also caught on in Cincinnati, where four 
hospitals sell frozen dinners to discharged patients, outpatients and staff. 
Chicken Dijon, seafood Newburg and lasagna are among the popular items. "Food 
in hospitals hasn't always gotten a fair shake," says Ohio dietitian Rohn 
Vickers. 
</P>
<P>
Not only professional dietitians, but chefs and gourmets, have joined in the 
upgrading trend. Fancy Los Angeles restaurants have been preparing carryout 
meals for hospital cases who are customers who want their favorite special at 
bedside. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, D.C., restaurants and hotels have catered gourmet meals in rooms 
and cafeterias periodically for relatively long-staying patients at the 
National Rehabilitation Hospital. The Willard hotel and the Occidental 
restaurant are among nationally known diners that joined the program. Roanoke's 
Community Hospital in Virginia has called in the executive chef of the Hotel 
Roanoke to counsel on adding hotel-style glamour to menus, including the 
hotel's famed peanut soup and spoonbread. 
</P>
<P>
Chefs are increasingly attracted to hospitals as career sites, say observers of 
the field, because of benefit packages and stability. The American Culinary 
Federation has noted the increased interest from culinary professionals in 
hospital jobs. Shorter work weeks and better benefit packages than those 
offered in cruise lines, restaurants and hotels are two of the lures. It may 
improve the balance sheet, too, if a pro is handling things. In one California 
hospital, where the kitchen was gourmandized, annual cafeteria revenues jumped 
from $400,000 to $1 million a year, according to Donald C. Miller, food service 
director for Tri City Hospital Center of Oceanside, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the ultimate in hospital gourmet developments was left to the great 
state of Texas. You simply move the gourmet restaurant into the hospital. Such 
was the case at Texas Medical Center's Methodist Hospital, Houston, where a 
full-scale eatery ("Chez Eddy") was created on the spot. There talented chefs 
concoct luscious meals using American Heart Assn. guidelines, with imaginative 
dishes like peppered salmon and Thai chicken seasoned with ginger, coriander 
and sesame seeds. One Chez Eddy triumph was in creating a sauce soubise without 
cream, using a reduction of cooked rice and onions, with nonfat milk. 
</P>
<P>
The new eatery is so integral a part of Methodist that it is housed between the 
departments of diagnostic cardiology and ambulatory surgery.

ABOUT WINE: NEW WINE EVOKES FRENCH SPIRIT 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The best sparkling wine in the world is unquestionably from Champagne. Although 
the best table wines of California can compete with the best wines made 
anywhere, the best sparkling wine of California is a cut below the French 
standard. And even that is made almost exclusively by French-influenced firms 
that have invested here. 
</P>
<P>
The latest such Gallic effort, housed in a spectacular replica of an 18th 
Century French chateau, is Domaine Carneros, owned by the house of Champagne 
Taittinger of Reims. The first sparkling wine made by this new property 
(founded 1987) is a superb evocation of the French spirit in a California mode. 
</P>
<P>
The woman behind the bubbles, Eileen Crane, left a career in nutrition 
education to make sparkling wine. In her third venture, Crane has fashioned a 
wine that exhibits the character of the grapes of the estate. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to make delicate wine, but it should be luscious on its own," said 
Crane. "And it's been difficult in California, in the past, to make a very 
delicate wine because the grapes in so many areas ripen so quickly." 
</P>
<P>
In her former positions making wine at Domaine Chandon and Gloria Ferrer, Crane 
used grapes from a wide number of regions. But she long felt the grapes growing 
in the cool Carneros region, at the southern end of the Napa Valley, were 
better suited for the delicate style of wine she wanted to make. 
</P>
<P>
When she became managing director here, the only grapes she would use were 
grown on the estate. She says, "I see Carneros as a 'Champagne' region." 
</P>
<P>
The word Champagne refers to a region of France and the wine made there; the 
French detest the use of the word when referring to sparkling wine made 
anywhere else. In Europe, it's illegal in most areas to use the term on a 
bottle for anything with bubbles that isn't made in Champagne. Crane, however, 
discusses her wine in terms of Champagne in order to point up the parallels and 
divergences. 
</P>
<P>
The first wine of the property is an excellent example of blending. The aroma 
of the wine gives the complex, berryish components of the Pinot Noir that makes 
up 60% of its blend. The remainder, Chardonnay, gives the wine a rich, textured 
mouthfeel. A creaminess finishes off the package. 
</P>
<P>
Only a small amount was made, and the wine is sold only at the winery ($18 a 
bottle). After the winery's grand opening (scheduled for September), the first 
general release of the wine will be offered. 
</P>
<P>
Making great sparkling wine requires attention to endless details. Crane is a 
perfectionist. She uses a special machine that removes the sediment from the 
wine, adds a dollop of sweetness, and corks the bottle all within seconds. At 
other champagneries, the process takes a minute or two. Does the saved time 
have a significant effect in keeping the wine fresh? Crane isn't sure, but she 
says it certainly can't hurt the wine and may make it more consistent. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors can see this commitment to quality by taking an excellent 
above-the-action tour of the facility. The tasting room is unlike many 
hereabouts, too. In place of rustic hand-made signs and jelly jar glassware, 
this is a civilized room filled with music and art. The interior decor, all 
made by local artisans, reminds you of upscale living. Guests sink into brass 
chairs with deep cushions and sip glasses -- at $3.50 each -- of the latest 
sparkler. 
</P>
<P>
Crane and hospitality director Carol Colesworthy say they are looking to create 
a warm hospitable environment for guests in the sit down tasting room. The 
whole idea is to give the traveler a respite from traffic, train whistles and 
tension. About $7 million was spent on the edifice, with wine making always the 
prime consideration. Crane promises that the wine will go beyond being 
technically good. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not looking for an intellectual experience," she says. "The most important 
thing is, the wine has to be a sensual experience." 
</P>
<P>
Others have found that Carneros lends itself to making this seductive wine. 
Looking north from a patio at Domaine Carneros, you face the Winery Lake 
Vineyard where Greg Fowler fashions Mumm Napa Valley's exceptional Winery Lake 
Cuvee sparkling wine. 
</P>
<P>
Up the mountain, in a crevice in the rolling hills, you can spot the low-lying 
edifice, still uncompleted, that will be the sparkling wine facility of 
Codorniu of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Down the road is the rambling acreage of Domaine Chandon, one of the largest 
producers of bottle-fermented sparkling wine in the country (more than a half 
million cases). And on down the road is the acreage of Spanish-owned Gloria 
Ferrer. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, real estate people say there have been more recent inquiries about 
the Carneros from folks looking to make sparkling wine. 
</P>
<P>
Most have French assistance. Guy Devaux assists Fowler at Mumm Napa Valley 
(G.H. Mumm et Cie's project). Dawnine Dyer has French assistance at Domaine 
Chandon from Edmond Maudier, Moet's chef de caves. At Maison Deutz in Arroyo 
Grande, Christian Roguenant is cuvee master. At Roederer's U.S. winery in 
Anderson Valley of Mendocino County, Michel Salgue has come over to make the 
wine. 
</P>
<P>
And at Barry and Audrey Sterling's Iron Horse in Sonoma County, which has made 
marvelous sparkling wines during the last few years, Raphael Brisbois is now 
the wine maker for the sparkling wines, replacing Claude Thibaut, who gave life 
to the project. 
</P>
<P>
The only French-connected Champagne house here that has essentially been run 
without much French influence is Piper-Sonoma; Chris Markell has been in charge 
from the 1980 start. But even Markell has contact with Piper-Heidsieck's Michel 
LaCroix. 
</P>
<P>
A number of U.S. wine makers unconnected to the French have made great strides 
with sparkling wine in the last few years, notably Fowler followed by Alan 
Tenscher at Schramsberg in the Napa Valley; Pete Downs at Chateau St. Jean in 
Sonoma County; Curt Lorenzi at Jepson in Mendocino County, and Harold Osborne, 
an independent wine maker in California's central coast, who made the first 
Maison Deutz wine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wine of the Week 
</P>
<P>
1989 J. Pedroncelli Dry Chenin Blanc ($5) -- A new wine for this family-run 
winery, and a winner. The spice and melon character are beautiful, and the 
mid-palate is rewardingly full-flavored without the wine being too soft or 
clumsy. In fact, it's a superb dinner companion, matched with seafood or 
lighter chicken dishes. Pedroncelli, founded in 1904, is one of those marvelous 
old-line wineries that are easy to forget. But the wines from this Sonoma 
County property are almost always great values.

Ratatouille is ideal for the undisciplined cook, since it doesn't involve 
adhering to a formula. By definition, the dish calls for eggplant, zucchini, 
tomatoes, peppers and olive oil, but proportions and seasoning are a matter of 
whim. What's more, the dish can be sauteed, stewed or even baked in a terrine, 
as follows, then sliced and served warm with soup or salad, or chilled, in a 
sandwich.

REPEAT PARKING OFFENDERS GET BACK IN TOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glendale police are turning to tow trucks in a new crackdown on motorists who 
let unpaid parking tickets pile up. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, launched May 10 and carried out intermittently since then, 
officers have impounded vehicles with five or more unpaid parking tickets. By 
the end of last week, officers had towed 55 vehicles, collecting fines on about 
500 tickets when the owners claimed the vehicles, said Sgt. Donald MacNeil, a 
police traffic administration supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
MacNeil said officers used a computer to identify scofflaws -- drivers who 
repeatedly violate parking rules -- then sent a special team to find the 
offenders' vehicles and arrange a tow. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a research-based, computer-aided task force," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The crackdown is expected to continue over the next three to six months, as 
officers whittle down their list of scofflaws. 
</P>
<P>
Parking problems, aggravated by the city's population boom, have become a key 
complaint of Glendale residents. 
</P>
<P>
City officials spent more than a year debating a proposal to restrict overnight 
parking as one way to relieve curbside congestion. In the wake of strong 
community opposition, the Glendale City Council last month abandoned the 
overnight parking ban but urged increased enforcement of existing laws. 
</P>
<P>
"We have seen that as sort of a mission or goal statement for the traffic 
division," MacNeil said. 
</P>
<P>
The city's 11 traffic enforcement officers ticket motorists who ignore 
street-sweeping signs, fail to pay parking meters or stay too long in a space 
with a parking time limit. Violations occur in both residential and commercial 
areas, MacNeil said. 
</P>
<P>
The new crackdown is aimed at drivers who simply toss their tickets on the 
floor or stuff them into the glove box. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Motor Vehicles will not allow motorists to renew their 
car's registration until all parking tickets are paid. If the tickets remain 
unpaid, police may summon a tow truck because the vehicle lacks current 
registration. 
</P>
<P>
But MacNeil said the system is flawed because unpaid tickets take many months 
to work their way through the courts and state vehicle offices before a 
registration renewal is blocked. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale police opted to use a state law that allows them to tow a vehicle 
immediately if it has collected five or more tickets over at least five days. 
Officers reviewed computer lists of repeat offenders and pinpointed the 
neighborhoods where the violations most often occurred. 
</P>
<P>
During early morning hours, members of the task force converged on these areas 
to find the offenders' cars and called for tow trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Some motorists had to dig deep into their wallets to get their cars back. For 
most overdue Glendale parking tickets, the charge is $42 -- double the normal 
fee. Fines for parking in a handicapped space are significantly higher. 
</P>
<P>
The owner also must pay a $56 towing fee, plus $9.50 per day for storage if the 
vehicle is not claimed within two hours. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those who have been towed in the new crackdown have paid the penalties 
without much protest, said Carvel Gay, owner of one of the three Glendale firms 
that have police towing contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of them seem to think that they finally got caught," Gay said. 
"They licked their wounds and said they were hopeful it won't happen again."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS ASSEMBLY DISTRICT 52; 
</P>
<P>
GOP PRIMARY REMAINS UP FOR GRABS; 
</P>
<P>
EVEN FRANK HILL, WHO GAVE UP THE SEAT WHEN HE WON ELECTION TO THE STATE SENATE, 
SAYS A WIN BY ANY OF FOUR OR FIVE CANDIDATES WOULD NOT SURPRISE HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The election to choose a successor to Frank Hill in the 52nd Assembly District 
has turned into a wide-open race in which eight Republican candidates are 
scrambling for a winning strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Two candidates call themselves the most conservative. One candidate is running 
as an environmentalist. Another has seized the ethics issue by refusing 
campaign contributions. And one is pitching an appeal to Asians and women. 
</P>
<P>
The June 5 primary has even featured a couple of candidates challenging their 
foes to take drug and AIDS tests. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, a Whittier Republican who gave up the Assembly seat in March when he won 
election to the state Senate, said the contest is so even that he would not be 
surprised by a win by any of four or five of the candidates. Hill said he told 
candidates when the campaign began that if anyone could pull away from the 
field, he would consider offering his help "to go the last 20 yards." 
</P>
<P>
But, Hill said, no one has emerged as a clear leader, so he will not endorse. 
</P>
<P>
Political experts estimate that as few as 12,000 votes will be enough to win a 
Republican primary split so many ways. There are 78,000 registered Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
The district stretches from La Mirada and Whittier across the Puente Hills to 
include Hacienda Heights, Rowland Heights, Diamond Bar, Walnut and part of West 
Covina. Republicans outnumber Democrats, 48% to 43%, making the Republican 
nominee a favorite to win the seat in November. 
</P>
<P>
The only Democrat on the ballot, Diamond Bar marketing consultant Gary Neely, 
is preparing a vigorous campaign. 
</P>
<P>
When the contest began, Wayne Grisham, who has served in Congress and the 
Assembly, was acknowledged as the most widely known candidate. But he entered 
the race carrying the stigma of losses in his last two election tries. Never 
regarded as an aggressive campaigner, Grisham has been even more subdued this 
time, running such a low-key campaign that opponents say he has lost his early 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth R. Manning, a member of the Hacienda La Puente Unified School District 
board, has the most endorsements from party leaders, and some opponents see him 
as the candidate to beat. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond Bar Councilman Paul Horcher is the only other current elected 
officeholder in the race. Others mounting strong efforts are Wil Baca, a civil 
engineer and businessman known for his work on environmental issues; Tony 
Russo, a young political aide who has helped run election campaigns for Hill 
and Grisham, and Phil Mautino, who has been active in civic affairs in the 
Republican stronghold of Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
Less visible campaigns are being run by Jim Baker, a board member of the 
Hacienda Heights Improvement Assn., who has declined campaign contributions, 
and Jack Dortignac, a West Covina construction foreman making his first bid for 
public office. 
</P>
<P>
In a move that other candidates called silly, Russo challenged all candidates a 
few weeks ago to take drug tests. He released the results of his own tests, 
which declared that the only medications he had taken in the previous 30 days 
were "vitamins, coffee and diet soda" and that he was drug-free. 
</P>
<P>
Russo said Grisham was the only candidate who accepted the challenge by taking 
a drug test. Horcher has said he would take the test if Russo would pay for it, 
but Russo has not complied. 
</P>
<P>
In response to Russo's challenge, Manning said that perhaps candidates should 
also take tests to screen for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Manning said 
he made the remark because candidates are out in the community "shaking hands 
and kissing babies." 
</P>
<P>
Horcher said that Manning's remark was a "very cruel and insensitive thing to 
say" and that it reflected a lack of compassion for people with AIDS and a lack 
of knowledge about the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Russo has also assailed Manning for his comments. Russo said drug tests are 
relevant because drug use can impair job performance, but he fails to see how a 
test for AIDS would have any significance. 
</P>
<P>
In trying to break out of the pack, each candidate has targeted his appeal in a 
way that invites labels. 
</P>
<P>
Baca, 49, is clearly the environmentalist. He has been endorsed by the Sierra 
Club, the California League of Conservation Voters and Californians Against 
Waste. In the past, Baca has used his tenacity and engineering expertise to 
lead fights against expansion of the Puente Hills landfill and construction of 
trash incinerators and to promote recycling statewide. 
</P>
<P>
He grew up in New Mexico and came to California in 1962 with a new bachelor's 
degree in engineering. Baca worked for several aerospace companies before 
starting his own consulting business. Although he continues to do engineering 
work, much of his income today comes from marketing products from his family's 
chili business in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents have labeled Baca a single-issue candidate whose emphasis on the 
environment is too extreme for most Republicans. Manning said Baca is "without 
a doubt the most fanatic environmentalist. He is willing to sacrifice anything 
and everything for the environment." 
</P>
<P>
Baca said when he stresses the environment, he is not talking about protecting 
the spotted owl or the desert tortoise but about improving the quality of life 
in a district that has the "world's worst air," four dumps, contaminated ground 
water, traffic congestion and overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, 61, a mortgage loan representative who lives in Hacienda Heights, 
announced at the start of his campaign that he would not accept donations 
because "the people are fed up with money politics." 
</P>
<P>
As a board member and committee chairman for the Hacienda Heights Improvement 
Assn., Baker has led efforts to deal with blight and gangs. His other concerns 
include limits on immigration and controls on spending. 
</P>
<P>
Dortignac, 33, is stressing his concern about family issues. He has seven 
children ranging from infancy to 10 years old. 
</P>
<P>
He said he wants to strengthen parental rights so that children cannot be taken 
out of homes based on anonymous allegations of child abuse. He also wants to 
work against pornography, which he says is destructive to family life. He is a 
strong opponent of abortion and would seek to permit it only in cases in which 
the mother's life is at stake. He opposes abortion in cases of rape or incest. 
</P>
<P>
Grisham, 67, is attempting a political comeback. He served briefly as director 
of the Peace Corps in Kenya, then moved to Norwalk and ran for an Assembly 
seat, which he won in 1984 and again in 1986. Then, he tried to move up to the 
state Senate but lost a special election in 1987. He was defeated for 
reelection to the Assembly in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Grisham has returned to the real estate business in La Mirada, his 
longtime home. He has plastered the district with signs saying "Wayne Grisham 
Is Back," but he has missed candidate forums and said he plans to spend just 
$25,000 to $30,000 on his campaign, which is considerably less than Russo, 
Horcher, Mautino and Manning say they have budgeted. 
</P>
<P>
Grisham said he is counting on voters remembering his past political service. 
"I know what needs to be done," he said. "Voters were happy with the job I 
did." 
</P>
<P>
Mautino, 50, a lawyer whose law office is in Whittier, is stressing his 
experience. "I've had a slice of life," he said. "I've been president of a 
YMCA, president of a bar association, founded the historical society in 
Whittier, been on the board of a hospital, moderator of a church with 700 
members. That is what I put on the table, my community involvement." 
</P>
<P>
Mautino grew up in West Los Angeles, where his father was a motion picture 
cameraman. He holds a master's degree in business administration from UCLA and 
a law degree from USC. He came to Whittier in 1967 as a law clerk for Keith 
Miller, who was then a Whittier councilman, and two years later became Miller's 
law partner. 
</P>
<P>
He has put $43,000 of his own money into his campaign and said he is prepared 
to spend "as much money as it takes." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many Republicans, he favors public financing of campaigns: "We're going 
to have to have public financing unless you want just wealthy people in the 
legislature. The costs are just incredibly high." 
</P>
<P>
Mautino is the only candidate identified with Whittier, which has the 
district's largest Republican registration. But other candidates who have been 
campaigning door to door in Whittier point out that Mautino does not live there 
but in neighboring La Habra Heights. 
</P>
<P>
Horcher, 38, is stressing his experience as an officeholder. He was elected 
twice to the Diamond Bar Municipal Advisory Council and was elected to the City 
Council when Diamond Bar incorporated last year. Horcher practices law in 
Hacienda Heights. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has put $100,000 of his own money into his campaign and expects to 
spend twice that amount. He has hired Harvey Englander, an experienced 
political consultant, to manage the effort. 
</P>
<P>
Horcher has proposed that the state require welfare recipients to take drug 
tests. Those who tested positive would not be denied aid but would be channeled 
into drug treatment programs so tax dollars would not be used to buy drugs, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Horcher is targeting his campaign at women and Asians. His wife emigrated from 
Vietnam in 1975, and Horcher has many business and personal contacts in the 
Asian community, which represents a potential of about 4,500 votes in the 
Republican primary. Horcher and Baca have emphasized their support of abortion 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
Horcher has the advantage of being the only candidate from one of the larger 
cities in the district, Diamond Bar, but he is a controversial figure there. 
His colleagues on the council removed him as mayor pro tem in February in a 
political dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Manning, 37, is running a campaign that stresses his service to the community 
and to the Republican Party and his 11 years on the school board. He said he 
regards himself as the conservative candidate, citing as credentials his 
endorsement by the California Republican Assembly, the Young Americans for 
Freedom and such lawmakers as Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) and 
Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach). 
</P>
<P>
Manning said he has been working in politics since 1960, when as an 8-year-old 
he helped his father, Travis (Tag) Manning, run for the Assembly. Tag Manning 
is now running his son's campaign, and their political consultant is a longtime 
friend, Stu Spencer, who was a political adviser to President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Manning said his experience on the school board will be especially helpful in 
Sacramento. "Conservatives need to take control of the development of policy in 
education," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His top priority, he said, would be to equalize funding among school districts, 
which has been skewed since the passage of Proposition 13 severely limited 
property taxes in 1978. The Hacienda La Puente district, for example, receives 
$800 less per pupil than some other districts because of a state funding 
formula designed to compensate schools for the revenue they lost under 
Proposition 13, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Russo, 27, is the youngest candidate. His opponents contend that he lacks 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
"The obvious attack against me is that I am 27 years old and I look 19," Russo 
said. "But the fact is that I've probably done more in public service than any 
of the other candidates. I've worked for three Republican legislators. I've 
been to Washington. I've worked in Sacramento. . . . I know that I can go to 
Sacramento and start doing more good for the district than anyone else, simply 
because I know how Sacramento works." 
</P>
<P>
Russo said his interest in politics began during his junior year at La Mirada 
High School, when he was selected to work as a congressional page for six 
months. He went on to earn degrees in political science, public affairs and 
public administration at USC, worked for Hill in a fellowship program and later 
served as chief of staff to Grisham and Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden 
Grove). 
</P>
<P>
He worked on Hill's Senate campaign from November to March and then began his 
own race for the Assembly.

LOCAL ELECTIONS BALLOT MEASURE; 
</P>
<P>
PROP. F WOULD DOUBLE COUNCIL SALARIES, STRENGTHEN VETO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Vice Mayor Wallace Edgerton's advice to voters on Proposition F is simple: If 
you believe that the only thing the June 5 ballot measure will accomplish is to 
double City Council members' salaries, vote no. 
</P>
<P>
Edgerton is hoping, however, that voters will see more to Proposition F than a 
simple salary increase and vote yes. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would double the salaries of Edgerton and his colleagues from 
$17,739 to $35,478, costing the city an added $253,000 annually. The measure 
also would strengthen the mayor's power by requiring six of the nine council 
votes, instead of five, to override a veto. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents say increasing the council's pay would open the political system to 
more candidates, especially minorities, who would otherwise not be able to 
afford the time commitment a council seat requires. The nine-member council has 
one black councilman, Clarence Smith, and is losing its only woman, Jan Hall, 
whose term expires in July. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you open up the system, you get better candidates because the pay is 
better," Edgerton said. "And you get the incumbents rising to a better level of 
performance because of increased competition." 
</P>
<P>
Proponents also argue that council members should be compensated for the 
demands and responsibilities running the city places on them. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Long Beach Area Citizens Involved, which opposes the measure, said 
they have no problem with the idea of increasing council salaries. They oppose 
Proposition F because it does not go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
"We favor full-time pay for full-time work," said Alan Lowenthal, president of 
the group. The proposed Charter amendment is weak, he said, because it does not 
forbid outside full-time employment. Most of the council members have full-time 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Lowenthal's group also opposes Proposition F because it will strengthen the 
mayor's veto "at the expense of the council." The measure would require a 
two-thirds vote of the council to override a veto. 
</P>
<P>
Under existing law, if the council adopts an ordinance on a 5-4 vote and the 
mayor vetoes it, a simple majority of five votes is required to override the 
veto. But if two-thirds of the nine council votes are required to overcome a 
veto, the minority on the council could determine an issue, Lowenthal pointed 
out. 
</P>
<P>
"Long Beach history shows that good legislation is frequently enacted on 5-4 
votes. To obtain the sixth vote to override a veto may be difficult, if not 
impossible," Lowenthal wrote in his ballot argument. 
</P>
<P>
But supporters argue that the stronger veto would encourage the mayor to take 
positions on issues and be more accountable. The existing veto power "has no 
practical effect since the same number of votes that passed a measure can 
override the mayor's veto power," a Charter Amendment Task Force wrote in its 
final report to the council last January. 
</P>
<P>
The task force was created to evaluate how the full-time mayoral position 
voters created in 1986 is working and whether it should be revised. The task 
force considered giving the mayor a vote on the council, but it opted instead 
to endorse strengthening the mayor's veto power. 
</P>
<P>
Several city officials who support Proposition F concede that the measure will 
have a tough time getting voter approval, particularly since it is on the 
ballot with another measure asking voters to create a new property tax to pay 
for more police. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a particularly favorable time," said longtime Councilman Tom Clark, a 
mayoral candidate.

<P>
Two Democrats are vying in the June 5 primary for the opportunity to challenge 
entrenched Republican Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead of Glendale in the November 
election. 
</P>
<P>
David Bayer, 46, of Burbank and Thomas G. Vournas, 66, of Altadena are both 
educators and neophyte candidates who want to square off with the well-financed 
career politician who has represented the GOP-dominated congressional district 
for 18 years. Moorhead was an attorney and a state assemblyman before he went 
to Washington in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
The challengers, one of whom will appear on the November ballot along with two 
minor party candidates, contend that Moorhead has lost touch with his 22nd 
Congressional District. 
</P>

The odds of unseating Moorhead, the dean of California's 18-member GOP caucus 
in Congress, are so heavily weighted against challengers that at times no 
Democrats have even entered the race. Moorhead typically has won reelection by 
70% or more of the voters. 
</P>
<P>
The sprawling district of nearly 300,000 registered voters stretches through 
north Los Angeles County from portions of the San Gabriel Valley through 
Glendale, La Canada Flintridge and La Crescenta to Canyon Country, Acton, Agua 
Dulce and parts of Pasadena, Burbank and Palmdale. More than 55% of the 
registered voters in the district are Republicans; about 35% are Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Bayer, director of adult education for the Burbank Unified School District, has 
the endorsement of the California Democratic Party and its local chapters. 
Bayer said he is conducting a grass-roots campaign before area groups and on 
campuses to emphasize his advocacy of abortion rights, family planning, a 
national health program and aggressive measures to clean the air and protect 
the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Bayer has raised less than $10,000 in his primary campaign, but said if he wins 
the primary he will try to raise up to $100,000 to challenge Moorhead in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
Vournas, a native of Los Angeles who has taught in public schools for 40 years, 
said he has long campaigned for Democratic candidates in local, state and 
national elections. But he said he decided to run for office himself this year 
because of his growing frustration "over the serious problems that the U.S. 
faces that are not being dealt with or even recognized." A self-described 
liberal, Vournas calls for better education, health care and living conditions 
for poor children and workers. 
</P>
<P>
Vournas said his campaign "is very limited, with just friends and family doing 
the labor and pounding the beat." He said he has no special financial or group 
backing. 
</P>
<P>
Also appearing on the November ballot will be Libertarian William H. Wilson, 
49, of Pasadena, a compensation analyst who represented the Libertarian Party 
as a candidate in 1988 in the 55th Assembly District. 
</P>
<P>
Running under the Peace and Freedom Party banner is Jan B. Tucker, 35, a 
private investigator and frequent candidate who has run for a variety of 
offices since 1974, including lieutenant governor in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker was among a group of demonstrators who protested Moorhead's stance on 
abortion -- which he opposes even in cases of rape and incest -- at a rally in 
front of Glendale High School last year. Tucker is recommended for endorsement 
by the California chapter of the Political Action Committee of the National 
Organization for Women. 
</P>
<P>
All of the candidates said their goal is to undermine the apparent solid 
support behind Moorhead, 68, who has treaded through a career in office with a 
relatively low profile. Moorhead typically shuns the spotlight and busies 
himself with technical issues such as patent protection, hydroelectric power 
and telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
In his usual genial manner, Moorhead in the past has declined to debate 
challengers, saying he saw no reason to do so. With more than $700,000 in 
campaign reserves, Moorhead's supporters once again are predicting an easy 
reelection victory.

SUPERVISORS ACCEPT LAND FOR SEWER PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County supervisors voted this week to accept a gift of six acres in 
Malibu as the likely site of a sewer treatment facility, even though sisters 
Sylvia R. A. Neville and Rhoda-May Dallas were said to have tried at the last 
minute to withdraw their offer to donate the land. 
</P>
<P>
"After some discussions involving the county, their thinking was to pull back 
completely," said attorney Thomas K. Houston, referring to an apparent change 
of heart by the sisters, who control the Adamson Cos., a major Malibu 
landowner. 
</P>
<P>
Houston, an Adamson attorney, said that when county officials were informed 
that Neville and Dallas had changed their minds, "they said that if that were 
the case, they would just go ahead and condemn (the property) anyway." 
</P>
<P>
In voting Tuesday to accept the gift, the supervisors approved a plan to 
acquire the six acres next to Pepperdine University by condemnation, if 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a private deal with the county, Neville and Dallas had agreed to 
surrender the property in exchange for the county's helping to expedite 
approval of a 300-room, $65-million hotel the sisters want to build in Malibu. 
The hotel depends on the sewer being built. 
</P>
<P>
But Houston indicated that Neville and Dallas, the firm's general partners, 
were disturbed by "recent rumblings from the county" that officials might not 
be able to help the company with the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Houston said there was never any explicit agreement with the county. 
</P>
<P>
"All we expected was that the county might be able to help us out with some 
permits. But the recent rumblings from the county are that maybe they're not 
even going to be in a position to do that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the arrangement have accused the county of pushing the deal with the 
Adamson Cos. for the sake of expediency, despite claims that the parcel is too 
close to residential development, and too close to an earthquake fault to be 
considered safe. 
</P>
<P>
County officials, eager to get a sewer system under way before a new Malibu 
government has the chance to block it, have acknowledged that they have no 
ready backup site for the sewer plant if their plans for the property hit a 
snag. 
</P>
<P>
Malibu voters will decide June 5 whether the community becomes a city, and 
approval is widely expected. They will also pick a five-member City Council 
that, depending on its makeup, may be far less enthusiastic than the county 
about sewers, hotels and development in general. 
</P>
<P>
The county has for months expressed interest in acquiring the six acres as the 
site for the sewer plant, which is to be the centerpiece of a proposed 
$43-million sewer system the county wants to build in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
But the site has been a lightning rod for controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of nearby Malibu Country Estates, a subdivision of million-dollar 
homes, complain that if the plant is built under their noses, it will hurt 
their property values. They have threatened to file a lawsuit to block it. 
</P>
<P>
The property also is the subject of a dispute between Neville and Dallas, the 
sisters of the late real estate scion Merritt Adamson, and his widow, Sharon 
Adamson, who claims a one-third interest in the parcel. She contends that the 
sisters had no right to give it away. The squabble is part of a much larger 
court battle over the disposition of the family's $75-million fortune, which is 
expected to go to trial this summer. 
</P>
<P>
As disclosed by The Times last week, Neville and Dallas offered to give away 
the land for the sewer plant and said they would try to get Sharon Adamson's 
cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to get Adamson to relinquish her purported interest in the property, the 
sisters decided to give the land to the county anyway, and agreed not to object 
if the county found it necessary to acquire the property by condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
County officials have acknowledged an arrangement with the sisters, but insist 
that they never agreed to an exchange of favors in order to get hold of the six 
acres. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no quid pro quo," County Counsel DeWitt Clinton said Tuesday, in 
response to a question from Supervisor Ed Edelman. "If there were, that would 
be illegal, and we wouldn't have been involved in it." 
</P>
<P>
Edelman said he wanted "to make it clear that my vote (to accept the gift) in 
no way indicates my support for any arrangement involving a hotel the Adamsons 
want to build." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Pete Schabarum expressed a similar view. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were the Adamsons, and I believed offering this property would result in 
the county's performing some kind of favor, I would have to be extremely 
naive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In her lawsuit against the sisters, Sharon Adamson contends that the parcel was 
among about $15 million in assets shared in common by her husband and his two 
sisters, rather than by the family company, and that the Adamson Cos. had no 
right to deal the property away. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Adamson's attorney has called the sisters' arrangement with the county 
idiotic, saying that they were attempting to give away a valuable piece of real 
estate "without . . . receiving so much as a snicker." 
</P>
<P>
Although the supervisors voted to accept the gift, they have not formally 
approved the placement of the sewer plant there. Under the agreement with the 
company, the county has until July 1 to designate the sewer site or the offer 
becomes void. 
</P>
<P>
Neither did the supervisors approve a redistribution of the tax assessment 
district for the sewer system on Tuesday, as had been expected. By law, four of 
the five supervisors must approve the tax assessment, and, with Supervisor Mike 
Antonovich absent, Edelman indicated he wanted more time to study the matter. 
</P>
<P>
A revised assessment became necessary after the California Coastal Commission 
last November voted to reduce the capacity of the sewer system devoted to 
commercial users. Slow-growth advocates had complained that the larger system 
envisioned by the county would foster too much development in the civic center 
area. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, would-be residential users now complain that they are being asked 
to pay up to 37% more than under the original sewer district, and have pressed 
the county to justify its data in increasing their rates.

AIR BOARD SEES UCLA GROWTH PLAN AS FLAWED; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: AQMD LETTER SAYS PROPOSED EXPANSION WOULD CAUSE MORE AIR POLLUTION 
THAN THE UNIVERSITY'S ENVIRONMENTAL REPORT ESTIMATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District has told UCLA that its 
controversial long-range growth plans would result in significant air pollution 
that is not adequately addressed in the university's environmental impact 
report. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter dated May 15, the district questions UCLA's contention that adding 
more than 4 million square feet of development could reduce traffic rather than 
add to it, as Westwood residents fear. The letter asks the university for 
"further clarification of the existing transportation system's ability to 
accommodate large increases in vehicular traffic." 
</P>
<P>
Intersections on Wilshire Boulevard in Westwood are repeatedly named among the 
city's most crowded. 
</P>
<P>
Even if spread out over 15 years, the UCLA construction would interfere with 
the district's ability to meet federal air quality standards, said the letter, 
signed by AQMD Planning Manager Jack Broadbent for Planning Director Barry 
Wallerstein. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Environmental Planning Officer Mark Horne said the district staff had 
"bashed" the university's development plan without understanding it. UCLA 
proposes to cut traffic with an expanded ride-sharing program and other 
measures, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Horne said this was the first time in 10 years that the AQMD had made any 
substantive comment on one of the university's environmental impact reports. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD is the latest agency to express concern about the ambitious 
development plan unveiled by UCLA this spring. If all the proposed projects 
were built, the square footage of campus buildings would increase by one third. 
The plan includes 2,700 housing units for graduate students and faculty on "Lot 
32" -- a parking lot between Gayley Avenue and the San Diego Freeway -- and a 
new hospital. 
</P>
<P>
While the AQMD does not have the power to approve or reject the long-range 
plan, it does have to issue a permit for a related project: a new power plant 
called a chiller-cogenerator that would produce electricity and steam while 
chilling water for campus air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
The primary fuels for the plant would be natural and landfill gas. A 120-foot 
exhaust stack would be needed to dilute emissions before they are released into 
the air. The plant would be at the south end of the campus on Westwood Plaza, 
near the UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA representatives said the new plant will be energy-efficient and cut 
utility bills. They said the tall smokestack is necessary because of hills and 
tall buildings nearby. 
</P>
<P>
In Kern County, growers and environmentalists, worried about public health and 
declining crop yields, asked the state Air Resources Board last year to impose 
a moratorium on any new power-producing cogeneration plants in the San Joaquin 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
At a sparsely attended public hearing on the UCLA power plant proposal Tuesday 
night, Westwood residents complained that the plant would make possible the 
growth envisioned in the university's expansion plan. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Lake, president of Friends of Westwood, said the plant would be capable 
of providing four times the energy consumed by the campus in 1983. She said its 
construction would also create "a major new stationary source for air 
pollution" in the middle of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Westwood resident Wolfgang Veith said the city of Los Angeles "would never 
think of putting a power generator in Westwood. Never." 
</P>
<P>
In its environmental impact report, UCLA conceded that the plant would 
significantly affect traffic, produce solid waste and waste water, increase 
water consumption and worsen air quality. But it called those effects 
"unavoidable." 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD's Broadbent testified briefly at the hearing but said his staff had 
not completed a study of the proposed power plant's impact. 
</P>
<P>
Because the AQMD's remarks on the long-range development plan were received 
after the public-comment period for the plan had ended, UCLA does not have to 
address them in its final environmental impact report. Horne said he is 
undecided about how to respond to them. 
</P>
<P>
If the UCLA chiller-cogeneration plant wins approval, it will be structured as 
a joint venture with a private firm, Parsons Municipal Services Inc., which 
would build and run the plant. Public funds would finance the construction, 
Horne said. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA has already scrapped one project on its wish list. Under pressure from 
homeowners and elected officials, UCLA Chancellor Charles Young said last week 
that he was dropping a plan to put a 300-room conference center at the south 
end of the campus, which juts down to Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The conference center was particularly offensive to its opponents, including 
City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, because it would bring overnight guests to 
Westwood Village, which is already inundated with people and cars. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky also called on UCLA to submit its plans for city approval, since 
they so clearly affect the surrounding community. 
</P>
<P>
As a state agency, UCLA is not subject to local land-use guidelines, but the 
area's elected officials have persuaded the university to let the city monitor 
the effects of its development on traffic.

A MAGNET FOR TROUBLE; 
</P>
<P>
HOMELESS: AS THE TRANSIENT POPULATION IN SANTA MONICA EXPANDS, SO DOES THE 
VIOLENCE. AND THESE DAYS, THE BACKLASH TOO IS MUSHROOMING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The image of a transient man choking the life out of a teen-age girl in the 
surf off Santa Monica is one that lifeguard Arthur C. Verge III will never 
forget. The 1982 incident, he said, starkly illustrated that his lifelong home 
was fast becoming a magnet of sorts for some dangerous elements. 
</P>
<P>
From his perch on the county lifeguard towers that dot the beach, Verge, 34, 
has spent much of his adult life observing Santa Monica's relationship with 
transients, and says it has gone from bad to worse to intolerable. 
</P>
<P>
"In 17 years of this, you see a lot," Verge, now a part-timer, said recently. 
"I wish I could say things are getting better, but they have continued to 
deteriorate. . . . It's becoming Dodge City down here." 
</P>
<P>
Verge's mother was attacked by a transient three years ago in a local church. 
Last year, a mentally ill homeless man stabbed social worker Robbyn Panitch to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, there have been a barrage of incidents, including the arrest of 
one transient on charges of arson in connection with a series of fires, and 
another charged with an attempted armed holdup of a Santa Monica bank. While 
shopping March 4, an 89-year-old woman was stabbed and robbed by a transient. 
</P>
<P>
Then, last Friday, what some have called the ultimate irony occurred: Santa 
Monica City Atty. Robert M. Myers, widely criticized for his reluctance to 
prosecute transients, was himself attacked and slightly injured during a 
scuffle with a man who was attacking Myers' chief prosecuting deputy, Jerry 
Gordon. Myers said the man appeared to be mentally ill. It has not been 
determined whether he was a transient, and he has not been caught. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope they are all right," Verge said of Myers and Gordon. "But it does seem 
like a case of them getting their just deserts." 
</P>
<P>
Critics of Myers immediately issued a press release saying the attack was 
"proof of his failed policies towards transients in the community," and 
evidence that Santa Monica's officially tolerant attitude has made the liberal 
community a magnet for predatory vagrants and troublemakers. 
</P>
<P>
Even supporters of Myers said the attack underscored what has become a dominant 
concern not just in Santa Monica but other Westside communities as well: What 
to do with a homeless population that seems to be expanding, increasingly 
desperate and, many would argue, more aggressive and violent? 
</P>
<P>
In the past, most Westside residents considered the transients who gathered at 
parks and street corners merely nuisances who would loiter, pester passers-by 
for change and occasionally shout an obscenity or two, or relieve themselves in 
the bushes. But in a recent survey conducted by the citizens' group Concerned 
Homeowners of Santa Monica, a whopping 75% of the 1,000 city homeowners who 
responded said their biggest concern was not overdevelopment, pollution, or 
traffic, but the homeless. Many said they no longer felt safe walking their own 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
Other Westside communities are grappling with similar problems, and some have 
responded by cracking down in response to complaints. 
</P>
<P>
West Hollywood, which budgets $2 million a year for social service programs and 
is considered one of the most tolerant cities in Los Angeles County, early this 
year banished the community's free-meal program from a public park and 
prohibited sleeping there. Beverly Hills pays for homeless services outside its 
city line, and Venice outlawed sleeping on the beach three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In Venice, "Clearly, we still have a number of homeless people at the beach. 
There are some people who are concerned," said Los Angeles City Councilwoman 
Ruth Galanter, who represents the seaside area. And Malibu, some say, has been 
quietly directing its transients south to Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood residents are shooing transients off their streets, saying, "Hey, we 
don't want you here," Los Angeles police Officer Carlos Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica residents have reacted so strongly, they say, because the city's 
policies and programs have exacerbated the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica police say one-third of their annual budget and police time is 
spent on transient-related incidents and arrests. The number of transients 
arrested on felony charges has at least doubled in the last four years, and 
assaults by transients are up sharply, they said. 
</P>
<P>
What is even more troubling, local residents and police say, is that for every 
highly publicized attack, there are innumerable smaller attacks and acts of 
violence and intimidation. City convention and tourism promoter Beverly Moore 
said such reports are starting to hurt business. 
</P>
<P>
Tour groups and conventions are heading elsewhere rather than risk 
confrontations with aggressive transients, Moore said at a recent public 
meeting. She estimated that the city was losing about 5% of its tourism revenue 
this year as a result. 
</P>
<P>
A recent poll of Santa Monica tourists and conventioners found that 40% 
reported having "disturbing, frightening experiences," Moore said. "This past 
summer was absolutely the worst. We are very worried about this summer." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica officials estimate that there are 40,000 transients in Los Angeles 
County, of which 4,000 are generally found on the Westside, and about 1,200 of 
them in Santa Monica. Many gather among the swaying palm trees in Palisades 
Park while others frequent street corners and alleys. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Myers has become a lightning rod for criticism because of his 
publicly stated refusal to prosecute transients for some minor nonviolent 
crimes such as public inebriation and sleeping in parks. Myers, who did not 
return repeated phone calls requesting comment, has said that such prosecutions 
would only clog an already overburdened judicial system and that intervention 
by social agencies is a better way to help the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica resident Leslie Dutton, who has organized a petition drive aimed 
at replacing Myers, says the city attorney's lenient attitude -- shared, Dutton 
says, by the majority of City Council members -- "has led to a decay of this 
community" and has created an unsafe environment, particularly for the elderly 
and children. 
</P>
<P>
Dutton's group, Santa Monicans for the Citizens Protection Act, is seeking to 
place an initiative on the November ballot to make the city attorney post 
elective instead of appointive. Group members have collected 2,000 signatures, 
but need 8,288 by June 11 to qualify the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Myers, appointed in 1981, has drawn praise from some social service workers and 
activists who work with the homeless for his compassionate approach. Some 
police and city administrators concede that the problem is too large and 
complex to blame one man, particularly because it is the county-level district 
attorney's job to prosecute major crimes, and the task of judges to decide 
wether to impose harsh or lenient sentences. 
</P>
<P>
Effective or not, Myers is a committed social activist who takes a personal 
interest in helping the homeless. He spends many Saturday mornings handing out 
sandwiches to transients who file in lines past City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, the homeless are hardly a new political issue in Santa Monica. In 
1984, for example, challenger Herb Katz won election to the City Council on a 
platform that included a call for a crackdown on the homeless. A year later, 
two councilmen called for Myers' ouster for declining to prosecute some 
transients for nonviolent misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
Some say Myers is not the only scapegoat in the current controversy; that the 
homeless themselves are being used as political pawns. 
</P>
<P>
County health officials estimate that one-third of the transients suffer from 
diagnosable mental illnesses. Vivian Rothstein, executive director of the Ocean 
Park Community Center, which runs five different shelter programs, said the 
mentally ill and other truly needy homeless are being lumped with drifters, 
drug addicts and career criminals into a "convenient package" that society can 
hold responsible for all of its ills. 
</P>
<P>
"On the street, things are much more complicated," Rothstein said. "I think it 
is getting meaner on the streets. People have been out there much longer, and 
they are much more desperate." 
</P>
<P>
The homeless are more often than not the victims of crime. Since 1988, police 
say seven transients were murdered in Santa Monica. Eigth other transients were 
arrested as suspects in those and other attacks. 
</P>
<P>
At a public forum late last month organized by the Concerned Homeowners group 
to discuss the transients, hundreds of angry residents interrogated city 
prosecutor Gordon, three City Council members, and representatives of the city 
police department, human services agency and tourism promotion office. The 
officials said they are hamstrung by societal problems such as jail 
overcrowding, a lack of affordable housing, and inadequate programs for the 
mentally ill and those with alcohol and drug problems. 
</P>
<P>
Few of the officials won much applause that day, except Councilman William 
Jennings, when he said: "What did Santa Monica do to become the homeless 
capital of the nation? We can't afford to become the Skid Row of America!" 
</P>
<P>
While the debate rages and officials search for answers, Santa Monica has for 
the most part resisted pressure to cut back its services to transients, and 
spends as much as $1.5 million a year on the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Although a noontime feeding program in Ocean Park was cut back by more than 100 
meals a day because of neighborhood complaints, after a six-month study, the 
City Council in late January approved what amounted to a $41,000 stopgap 
appropriation to deal with some aspects of the homeless issue. 
</P>
<P>
Among the provisions: hotel vouchers for the disabled homeless, policing of 
liquor stores and the establishment of an advisory group of homeless people. 
And last August, at the urging of Mayor Dennis Zane, the city authorized 
spending $30,000 to retain a consultant to organize local governments' support 
for action at state and federal levels.

Emergency water-rationing measures received unanimous final approval by the 
City Council on Tuesday night. Responding to California's drought, the council 
enacted the measures that limit lawn watering to twice a week and prohibit 
residents from filling pools unless they are new or in need of repair. 
</P>
<P>
The measures, now in effect, add to the city's list of water measures approved 
last year. Those measures include a ban on lawn watering between 10 a.m and 4 
p.m. and the use of running water to wash cars. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency ordinance also outlaws the hosing down of driveways and sidewalks 
and requires restaurants to display placards on tables that state water will be 
served only upon request. The ordinance will be in effect until the council 
determines that there is no longer a water crisis. Violators could face a $20 
or 20% surcharge on their water bills, whichever is more, and a $100 fine. The 
council also hopes residents will voluntarily reduce water use by 10%. To meet 
that goal, the city has distributed low-flow shower heads and faucet aerators 
and has offered to inspect lawns and irrigation systems for water-use 
efficiency.

AROUND THE FOOTHILLS: 'YOU'RE ONE OF THE LEGENDS . . . ONE OF THE LEGENDS OF 
SALSA, MAN.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sure it was a setup. The Master Blaster doesn't hang out at the clubs anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years after retiring his celebrity persona as the DJ of Rhythm and Blues 
on L.A.'s KGFJ Radio, the Master Blaster wears suits and pursues corporate 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
As executive producer of his own company, For Members Only, Tom Reed worries 
about things such as scheduling interviews, landing air time and submitting his 
work for awards. 
</P>
<P>
His work is documentary video of a type not often seen on network television. 
Reed focuses his camera on thin slices of Los Angeles history that are 
overlooked by the mass media. His subject is Afro-American culture with an 
emphasis on music. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to be on NBC to make a contribution to your craft," he told me 
once, philosophically, sitting in his living room and studio in a large 
apartment complex south of Los Feliz Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
His latest effort, "Salsa L.A. Style," tells the story of the Mexican-American 
musicians who brought the Afro-Latin sounds of the Caribbean to Los Angeles 40 
years ago. It will air next Wednesday on Sammons Communications cable, Channel 
34, at 9 p.m. The broadcast seemed a good reason to renew an acquaintance and 
also give Reed a little ink. 
</P>
<P>
The story would need some atmosphere, though, and Reed was ready to provide. 
</P>
<P>
He said he'd be at Pedro's, a club in his Los Feliz neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Pedro's was an Italian restaurant on Vermont where the 
proprietor sang popular tunes. It's a beautiful place, really, if you look 
carefully. It's Mississippi Steamboat style, with fluted wooden pilasters 
spanned by leafy arches, under each a lighted oil portrait of a vaguely 
Victorian person. The bar is backed in real mahogany paneling. 
</P>
<P>
Now it's become a salsa club. The guy playing Monday night was Johnny Martinez, 
one of the stars of Reed's "Salsa L.A. Style." 
</P>
<P>
Reed's idea of a publicity stunt was to let the man who makes the music do the 
talking. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, who arrived early for the interview, was at no loss for words. He 
wore a navy blue gabardine suit, an open turquoise shirt and a black canvas 
fedora with a white band. Reed introduced him in the voice of the Master 
Blaster. 
</P>
<P>
"He is the premier, the GIANT salsa music player in this city! Thirty years of 
salsa excellence!" 
</P>
<P>
Martinez returned a warm smile under a sliver of gray mustache. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been working for 33 years in Los Angeles without a week off," he boasted. 
"Every two years or so, I get a three-day break." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez wove his own story with the story of salsa in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
He studied at the Chicago Conservatory of Music and almost got sidetracked in 
the be-bop clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"I was learning modern progression," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
Then a chance gig with a Latin band playing at the Glass Hat changed his life. 
</P>
<P>
"A good jazz gig would pay me 15 bucks." he said. "My first Latin gig, 45 
stones. I immediately knew Latin was going to be my bag." 
</P>
<P>
After serving in World War II, Martinez said, he came to Los Angeles where 
Latin music counted 36 clubs between La Cienega Boulevard and Vermont Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"They were all packed. Then the Twist ran us out. Before you knew it, the 
owners said, 'Let's do the Twist.' " 
</P>
<P>
"We had 40 great Latin bands. Then, all of a sudden, I found myself alone. 
There was still room for one Latin band in this city and that was me." 
</P>
<P>
"You're one of the legends," Reed interjected. "One of the legends of salsa, 
man." 
</P>
<P>
"They call me the legend," Martinez mimicked. "They call me the old geezer, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 9, Martinez joined his 10-piece band on stage. The music started 
and people danced. 
</P>
<P>
Between songs, Reed told how salsa came into his life. He was stationed in 
Havana with the Navy in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw Machito and his group," Reed said. "That was all it took. R&amp;B was my 
music, but I liked the sound of Latin salsa." 
</P>
<P>
Reed said he first saw Martinez in 1958 at Virginia's. The club is gone now. 
But its story lives on as one small piece of "Salsa L.A. Style." 
</P>
<P>
Like an evening with the Master Blaster, Reed's documentary is a wild ride. 
Sometimes the narrative thread becomes a tangle, racing through the names of 
dozens of groups and back and forth from Machito and Tito Puente in the clubs 
of New York to Eddie Cano and the birth of salsa at the Hollywood Palladium. 
Sometimes the narrator falls back into the Master Blaster voice, interjecting 
comments in sentences without verbs. Sometimes, in inconclusive repartee, the 
Mexican-American musicians bristle at Reed's premise that salsa is an 
Afro-Latin form. 
</P>
<P>
That's Reed's style, direct, rough at the edges perhaps, but always probing 
where others forget to look. 
</P>
<P>
Its greatest aggravation may be the abruptness with which Reed ends the 
signature cuts of the groups in the film. You don't want the music to go away. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that apparently, it's still around and may be coming back. 
Johnny Martinez has a pretty good gig tonight. It's at the Excess Club in 
Glendale. Be there or be square.

<P>
APARTMENT LAW MODIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a modification of its crackdown on illegal additions and bootleg apartments, 
the City Council decided this week that violators who turn themselves in during 
the three-month amnesty period may delay correcting the violation until their 
property is sold or transferred. 
</P>
<P>
The council in February adopted a program to enforce various city codes in an 
effort to combat an increasing number of bootleg units, such as converted 
garages. 
</P>
<P>
Residents were given a 90-day amnesty period, until June 30, to report their 
violations. They were not fined and were given three years to bring their 
property into compliance. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, however, the council heard testimony from more than a dozen property 
owners who complained that the crackdown was forcing them to pay for code 
violations they did not know about when they bought their properties. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Eleanor Egan told the council that it could not enact a "grandfather 
clause" to pardon past offenses without allowing present homeowners the same 
leeway to violate the codes. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4 to 1 to extend the original amnesty period by three months 
and to postpone enforcement until the property is sold if violators report 
themselves. In such cases, city officials said, homeowners would be able to 
continue renting the bootleg apartments, provided there are no health or safety 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners who do not turn themselves in during the amnesty period will be 
given a year to bring their properties into conformance. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Jim Boulgarides, who said he favors stricter enforcement, voted 
against the motion.

REMOVAL OF INOPERATIVE VEHICLES GEARS UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you live in Pico Rivera and your car doesn't move, the city will move it for 
you -- to the junkyard. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, weary of seeing dead clunkers on streets and in yards, has 
directed city workers to step up enforcement of a law banning visible 
inoperative vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
So far the effort has covered about one-fourth of the city. Even so, the 
Planning Department has cited 200 vehicles per month since January. Through 
mid-April, more than 250 vehicles have been garaged or removed by owners, or 
towed by the city. The vehicle and property owners are liable for the towing 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
There were 10 inoperative vehicles at one residence alone, said Dave Caretto, 
assistant city manager. The city has received voluntary compliance with the law 
with 90% of the cited vehicles. Caretto said the goal is to make neighborhoods 
more attractive and to maintain property values. "The difference is already 
starting to show in the community," he said.

PUPILS TO BE MOVED FROM 3 CROWDED SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Paramount Unified School District Board of Education has unanimously 
approved a plan to move an estimated 700 elementary pupils from their 
neighborhood schools to a renovated facility to relieve overcrowded conditions 
in the 12,500-student system. 
</P>
<P>
The five-member board made its decision Tuesday after three public hearings in 
which numerous parents voiced objections. 
</P>
<P>
Parents said they were most fearful of their children crossing busy streets and 
traffic from the nearby Century Freeway, now under construction. Many of the 
objections came from parents living in the Hollydale area. Although nearly 300 
children were scheduled to be transferred from that area, the board compromised 
and allowed 61 pupils to remain at Hollydale. 
</P>
<P>
Children will be transferred starting in September from three of the most 
crowded elementary campuses, Hollydale, Roosevelt and Lincoln, to Wirtz 
Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
Wirtz has been used as an annex for Paramount High School. Students who have 
been using the annex will return to the high school campus in September after 
classroom construction is completed.

SANTA MONICA RENT PLAN SENT TO BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Monica Mayor Dennis Zane's proposed ballot measure to ease the city's 
rent-control law was sent by the City Council this week to the Rent Control 
Board for its recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Zane's proposal, aimed at stemming the city's rental housing losses, is 
designed to make the rental business more profitable and encourage landlords to 
keep their units on the market. It stops short of the full decontrol of rents 
when units are voluntarily vacated, a change that many landlords insist is 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would allow rents on vacant one-bedroom units to rise to between 
$475 and $525 a month. On two-bedroom units, rents could rise to between $600 
and $675 a month. City officials said the current average rent of units being 
removed from the market is $355 a month. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of units where rents already are at or above the proposed maximums, 
landlords would be permitted to raise the rent by 10% to 20% every two to four 
years. In exchange for being allowed to increase rents, however, landlords 
would have to agree to keep their rental units on the market for at least 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Zane said his proposal represents an effort to find a balance between what he 
calls the "twin terrors" of the state Ellis Act, which establishes procedures 
under which landlords can evict tenants and quit the rental business, and a 
proposed initiative backed by landlords that would end rent control for units 
that are voluntarily vacated. 
</P>
<P>
Landlords, long critical of the city's tough rent-control policies, have used 
the Ellis Act to remove 1,000 units from the city's rental market since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
A competing ballot proposal by Councilman Herb Katz will also go to the rent 
board for recommendations. It calls for an end to rent controls upon voluntary 
vacancies with a catch -- landlords who charge $1,000 a month or more for rent 
would be required to donate 20% of the rent to a city fund for low- and 
middle-income residents.

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COLLEGE TO ELIMINATE PERSONNEL POSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale College Board of Trustees voted unanimously Monday to abolish the 
position of director of classified personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was a result of an April vote by the college's classified 
employees to terminate the merit system in which a three-member independent 
commission appointed the personnel director, who acted as a liaison between the 
classified employees and the commission. The commission oversaw hiring, firing 
and promotion of the college's 243 classified workers. The merit system had 
been in effect since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Personnel matters will be handled by the Board of Trustees after the 
$66,000-a-year position is terminated June 30.

<P>
Glendale College officials Monday unveiled a draft $56-million balanced budget 
for 1990-91, up 14% from the present year. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Black, college director of accounting, told the Board of Trustees that the 
increase consisted mainly of about $1 million to pay a 6.2% salary hike and a 
$6-million increase in capital expenditures for campus renovation. 
</P>
<P>
Campus construction was projected at $16.3 million, including $3.9 million for 
a permanent adult community training facility, $1.9 million to renovate the 
administration building, $3 million to reconfigure the auditorium, $3.2 million 
to upgrade the technical education buildings and $1.4 million to build an 
emergency access road across campus. 
</P>
<P>
The board is scheduled to adopt the preliminary budget June 18 and will hold a 
public hearing before adopting the final budget Aug. 27.

FARMHOUSE WILL BE A HOME FOR THE HOMELESS; 
</P>
<P>
POOR: GLENDALE CONTRIBUTES GRANT MONEY TO THE SALVATION ARMY TO SET UP THE 
CITY'S FIRST SHELTER FOR HOMELESS FAMILIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale City Council allocated $200,000 in federal grant money Tuesday 
toward purchase of a quaint farmhouse that will serve as the first shelter for 
homeless families in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
The funds were approved on a 4-0 vote, with Councilman Jerold Milner absent. 
Officials said the farmhouse will serve as a short-term home for small families 
that are temporarily down on their luck. 
</P>
<P>
It will not be used to house single transients or victims of drug and alcohol 
addiction, who will continue to be referred to local motels or to shelters 
outside the city, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds were allocated by the council to the Glendale Salvation Army 
to pay part of the $460,000 purchase price of a 94-year-old, two-story house at 
609 Chester St. The Salvation Army will pay the balance from its own funds, 
with the sale to be completed June 26. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Ken Hodder of the Salvation Army told council members Tuesday that the 
agreement is "the culmination of more than two years of blood, sweat, tears and 
prayers" in their search for a shelter for the growing number of homeless 
families in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
The charity last year provided housing, food, clothing and other assistance to 
more than 13,500 needy people, about 70% of whom were displaced families, 
usually from Glendale, Hodder said in an earlier interview. 
</P>
<P>
The Chester Street house, called the Booth House, is located just south of the 
Ventura Freeway and east of San Fernando Road in a quiet neighborhood of mixed 
older family homes, duplexes and apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
It will be used to shelter families without charge for up to six months while 
they work to save enough money to rent private housing elsewhere, said Madalyn 
Blake, director of community development and housing. 
</P>
<P>
The Victorian-style house, built in 1896, has seven bedrooms, two living rooms, 
two dining rooms and four baths. No more than four small families will be 
housed at a time, using five of the bedrooms. The total number of occupants 
will be about 16, including an on-site supervisor for the Salvation Army, Blake 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors had expressed concerns about the proposed shelter's location in a 
residential area, but last week Salvation Army and city officials met with them 
to allay their fears. Because the shelter's residents would be limited to a 
small number of working families, officials said it would pose no problems for 
the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The house was to have become the city's first bed-and-breakfast inn under an 
ordinance adopted last year. However, the current owners, Martha Skinner and 
her husband, Richard Sanchez, who renovated the farmhouse after they purchased 
it 1 1/2 years ago, said a job relocation is forcing them to move. 
</P>
<P>
Hodder said the Salvation Army has applied for a $450,000 federal grant to 
operate the shelter for the next five years. The program is scheduled to begin 
Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The funds allocated for the shelter Tuesday are part of the city's share of 
$1.7 million in annual federal block grant money for the current fiscal year, 
used to provide public social services and to improve community facilities, 
housing and neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
In separate action Tuesday, the council also allocated the city's $1.7 million 
in block grant funds for the next fiscal year beginning July 1.

AQUATICS CLUB HAS IMPRESSIVE LIST OF CHAMPION SWIMMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Helen Salcedo is one of several outstanding swimmers at the Bellflower Aquatics 
Club, whose pool is in Thompson Park at 14001 S. Bellflower Blvd. The purpose 
of the club, Coach Don Watkinds said, is to give members the "opportunity to go 
as far as they want to in swimming." 
</P>
<P>
There are 60 youngsters in the club who train under Watkinds, who has been 
coaching for 24 years, and Lionel Hughes, who formerly coached the Lynwood Aqua 
Knights. 
</P>
<P>
Among the club's other top swimmers are: 
</P>
<P>
* Brian Jacobson, a junior at Downey High School, who holds the Southern 
California record in the 50-yard and 100-yard freestyle for boys ages 13 to 14 
and boys 15 to 16. He is on the National Junior Team and competed earlier this 
year in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
* Beth Bredice, a senior at Paramount High, who was that school's athlete of 
the year as a junior. In CIF, she finished fourth in the 100 freestyle and 
fourth in the 100 individual medley. She has been offered a scholarship to San 
Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
* Tom Salcedo, Helen's brother, a junior at Bell High, who won the 200 
individual medley and the 100 breast stroke (59:02 seconds) in the CIF city 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
* Yvette Tristan, a junior at Warren High in Downey, who has won the 100 
butterfly at CIF two consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
* Michelle Brassard, Karen Teitsworth, Sharon Teitsworth and Rebecca Stephens 
of Bellflower High, who have won the CIF medley relay two consecutive years.

BELL SWIMMER TRIMS TIME IN HOPE OF SPOT ON U.S. TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an atmosphere of chlorine and liniment so familiar to her, Helen Salcedo, 
afreshman at Bell High School and a top national swimmer, waited to compete in 
the CIF City Section meet at Belmont Plaza Olympic Pool in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Out of the turquoise water, Salcedo blended in with the other swimmers, who, 
wrapped in sweat suits or towels, socialized on the bleachers or by the snack 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
Before taking practice laps for the 100-yard breast stroke event last week, the 
14-year-old talked about what she likes most about her sport. 
</P>
<P>
"Finishing a race and knowing you did your best," she said. "When everybody in 
the building is clapping, the feeling sends shivers up and down your spine." 
</P>
<P>
Salcedo, who won her first meet when she was 6, has impressive credentials. In 
March she won the 200-yard breast stroke at the Junior Nationals in Iowa City 
with a time of 2:20.96, only 11 seconds slower than the national senior women's 
record. 
</P>
<P>
She has been lowering her times dramatically. Two winters ago, she swam the 
200-yard breast stroke in over three minutes. But last summer at the Junior 
Nationals in Austin, Tex., she swam the long-course 200-meter breast stroke in 
2:48.99. Although she did not place, the time was a personal best. 
</P>
<P>
She hopes to make the National Junior Team, a 12-boy, 12-girl group that will 
train in the fall at Colorado Springs and compete next January in Europe. That, 
said Don Watkinds, her coach at the Bellflower Aquatic Club, requires a 
200-meter breast stroke time of about 2:38. 
</P>
<P>
"If she would jump in the pool now and swim 200 meters under 2:38 it wouldn't 
surprise me," Watkinds said. 
</P>
<P>
Salcedo, who learned to swim at the South Gate YMCA, was a unique addition to 
the Bell High team: the first girl to come in with experience, according to 
Bell Coach Frosty Golembeske. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the kids don't know how to swim at all when they get here, or maybe 
just a survival stroke," said Golembeske, who coaches in an area not known for 
its number of back-yard pools. 
</P>
<P>
Golembeske wore a T-shirt that proclaimed Bell the "Team of the Decade." 
</P>
<P>
In the last nine years, Golembeske's teams have not lost a meet in the 
Northeastern League, which also consists of South Gate, Huntington Park, 
Garfield, Roosevelt and Eagle Rock high schools. He admitted, though, that the 
Bell Eagles were not in the class of perennial power Palisades High. (Palisades 
won the CIF meet and Bell finished fourth.) 
</P>
<P>
"We just put a lot of time and work in it, and try to stay on top of the new 
techniques," he said. "And a lot of it stems from desire and tradition." 
</P>
<P>
Salcedo, who did not lose an event this season, said she was apprehensive when 
she joined the Bell team. "At first I was nervous because I thought they would 
think, 'This girl is much better than we are,' and wouldn't accept me. But they 
were friendly." 
</P>
<P>
"They realized that she's there to help us," said Golembeske, who believes that 
Salcedo will be an All-American this year. "She works hard and has a good 
attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Why is Salcedo, who also does well in freestyle and butterfly events, most 
proficient at the breast stroke? 
</P>
<P>
"The strongest part of the stroke is the kick, and I have strong legs," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Watkinds said, "It has a lot to do with ankle and knee flexibility, and the 
power they can generate." 
</P>
<P>
She practices from 4 to 7 p.m. five days a week, but not with her teammates in 
the Bell pool. She and her brother, Tommy, a Bell High junior, go to the 
Bellflower Aquatic Club in Thompson Park for more advanced training under 
Watkinds. 
</P>
<P>
The club swimmers first work on weight machines and do sit-ups and pull-ups, 
then endure intense sessions in the water. 
</P>
<P>
When not swimming or doing homework, Salcedo says she enjoys listening to 
"mellow" rock music. 
</P>
<P>
"She just listens to her radio in her room or helps mom around the house," 
Tommy said. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a purple cap, Salcedo lay on her stomach on a table beneath the 
bleachers a few minutes before the 100-meter breast stroke finals. Watkinds 
vigorously kneaded and twisted her ankles, and stretched her muscular legs. 
</P>
<P>
"I make sure she's loose," he said. "And this increases her circulation." 
</P>
<P>
Then the two went through a visualization of the race. He leaned over, close to 
her ear, and said, "You're driving forward . . . snap those legs . . . you're 
making your move . . . accelerate!" 
</P>
<P>
He checked his stopwatch and went on: "You're driving into the wall . . . hit 
the wall right . . . you're hitting the wall . . . now, everything you've got." 
</P>
<P>
He then applied a light green cream that he said was a mixture of mineral oil, 
wintergreen, alcohol, lanolin and witch hazel. "She likes it hot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then a goggled Salcedo took her mark and the race began. 
</P>
<P>
"Come on, Helen. Let's go, Helen," shouted her teammates, standing on the deck. 
</P>
<P>
Salcedo won easily with a time of 1:06.22. 
</P>
<P>
Looking unsatisfied, she returned to her teammates and said, "I felt pretty 
good, I was hoping for a better time." 
</P>
<P>
Still, she set a city record. And heard the applause at the finish.

CITY VOLLEYBALL TITLE ELUDES VERDUGO HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Verdugo Hills boys' volleyball team could not have chosen a worse time to 
have its worst match of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Dons' hopes for an unbeaten season ended last Friday at Pepperdine's 
Firestone Fieldhouse when they lost to Monroe, 15-3, 15-9, 15-12, in the City 
Section 3-A Division championship match. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids knew that if we didn't serve well, we were going to have problems 
because Monroe doesn't make mistakes," Verdugo Hills Coach Dino Stirpe said. 
"Monroe played their best match of the season and we played our worst." 
</P>
<P>
Verdugo Hills, which finished 17-1, has a strong nucleus returning next season, 
including All-Northern League selections Kheng Lim and Soi Hoang. 
</P>
<P>
Tracking a title: The Occidental College men's and women's track teams are 
competing this week in the NCAA Division III national championships at North 
Central College at Naperville, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental, which has not won a national team title, has 19 athletes competing 
in 23 events, the second-largest contingent the school has ever sent to the 
nationals. 
</P>
<P>
"The men's field is so balanced throughout, we could be anywhere in the top 
20," Occidental Coach Bill Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
The Occidental women, who have finished in the top five in five of Harvey's 11 
years as coach, will face strong competition from several schools, including UC 
Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"It is by far the best team we've had," Harvey said. "But we've run into a 
bunch of other teams that are in the same position." 
</P>
<P>
Signed, sealed, delivered: Matt Whisenant, who graduated from La Canada High 
and played this season at Glendale College, has signed a contract with the 
Philadelphia Phillies and will report to the organization's Rookie League 
affiliate at Martinsville, Va. on June 18. 
</P>
<P>
Whisenant, a 6-foot-3, 200-pound left-hander, was selected by the Phillies in 
the 15th round of free-agent draft last June. 
</P>
<P>
He was 3-5 with a 5.00 earned-run average and also batted .322 for Glendale, 
which finished 12-27. 
</P>
<P>
Club life: Dan Jennings of St. Francis High won the Southern Section individual 
golf title on Monday, shooting a 3-under-par 69 at the Mission Hills Golf 
Course. 
</P>
<P>
Jennings, a senior, advances to the Southern California Golf Assn.'s Southern 
California finals June 11 at El Caballero Country Club in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
Leaps and bounds: Marji Gilles became the first Glendale College woman to win a 
state title in 10 years when she leaped 37 feet 3 1/3 inches in the triple jump 
at last weekend's state track and field championships at Santa Barbara City 
College. 
</P>
<P>
Gilles made her winning jump only hours after finishing the heptathlon, in 
which she scored 4,033 points to finish in a tie for fifth place. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so tired after the heptathlon that the win in the triple was totally 
unexpected," said Gilles, who has a best of 39-4 3/4. "I didn't jump 
particularly well, but this is great. It totally makes up for all those times 
that I ever finished second or third." 
</P>
<P>
Among other Glendale competitors: 
</P>
<P>
Dave Swanson, a transfer from Cal State Northridge who placed sixth in the high 
jump at the 1988 NCAA Division II meet, cleared 7-0 1/4 to tie Gio Spratling of 
Hartnell. Spratling won the title in a jump-off. 
</P>
<P>
Marty Beck suffered his first loss of the season in the 400-meter intermediate 
hurdles (51.22), placing second to Larry Sanders of Taft (51.06). Sanders hit 
the last hurdle but was able to hold off the late-charging Beck, who fell at 
the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Provenzano led for the first 600 meters in the 800, but faded to finish 
ninth in 1:58.5. 
</P>
<P>
On the fast track: Eliazar Herrera and Creighton Harris of Hoover High and 
Edward Baktanian of Flintridge Prep qualified for Friday's Southern Section 
Master's meet with outstanding performances in the Southern Section finals at 
Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera ran a personal-best 9:06:43 in the 4-A 3,200 meters to qualify behind 
Camarillo's Abe Valdez, who finished in 9:03:05. 
</P>
<P>
Harris clocked a 4:17.02 for second place in the 1,600 while Baktanian leaped 
21-1 to take fourth in the 1-A long jump. 
</P>
<P>
All-American: Cal State Northridge outfielder Lisa Erickson was named to the 
NCAA Division II All-American team for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson, who played at Crescenta Valley High, batted .380 with 16 runs batted 
in and 45 stolen bases for the Lady Matadors, who finished second to Cal State 
Bakersfield at the Division II championships last week. 
</P>
<P>
Two-time titlist: Wendy Cohen of Crescenta Valley High captured her second 
consecutive Southern Section individual gymnastics title last weekend at 
Westlake High. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen, a junior, compiled an overall score of 37.25 to win the competition. 
Cohen won the vault, finished second in floor exercise, third in the uneven 
bars and fourth on the balance beam. 
</P>
<P>
Raising a racquet: Tom Zelanovic of La Canada High will become the first player 
from the school to compete for a Southern Section individual title when he 
plays Brett Dent of Diamond Bar on Friday in the round of 16 at Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Zelanovic advanced to the tournament by defeating Howard Kim of Pasadena Poly 
and Eric Lin of Anaheim Canyon last Saturday at Diamond Bar High.

HOUSE PASSES MAJOR CHANGES TO CLEAN AIR ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The House overwhelmingly passed a major revision of the Clean Air Act late 
Wednesday that includes a precedent-setting pilot program to mandate the sale 
of clean-fueled cars in California. 
</P>
<P>
Tougher than a version already approved by the Senate, the House bill was 
adopted by a vote of 401 to 21. Lawmakers brushed aside the threat of a White 
House veto to include a provision granting extra unemployment insurance to 
workers who lose their jobs as a result of the bill's stricter clean air 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
A number of other strengthening amendments, including a provision sought by 
California members to tighten regulations on offshore pollution sources such as 
oil platforms, also were adopted by overwhelming votes. The votes came after 
House negotiators forged the last of several key compromises to avert what 
might otherwise have been long and acrimonious floor fights. 
</P>
<P>
The first revision of the nation's clean air laws in 13 years, the omnibus 
legislation would tighten limits on automobile emissions to free all American 
cities of smog within 20 years and impose technological controls on factories 
to reduce the risk of cancer from the chemicals they release. It also, for the 
first time, would strictly regulate emissions from coal-burning power plants 
that cause acid rain. 
</P>
<P>
The bill must still be reconciled with the version passed April 3 by the 
Senate, 89 to 11. But the House's historic action on Wednesday all but assured 
that, after more than a decade of legislative stalemate, new clean air 
legislation will become law this year. 
</P>
<P>
"The House has listened to the will of the people rather than the special 
interests. The House bill is better than the Senate's," said Daniel Weiss, a 
lobbyist for the Sierra Club. "Now we've got the makings of a masterpiece in 
conference, but it will all depend on whether we can put the right pieces 
together," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Senate bill, the House measure is largely the product of a series of 
hard-won, complex compromises bridging decade-old divisions among 
environmental, economic and regional interests. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Senate bill, however, the House version contains stronger provisions 
on clean-fueled cars, stationary sources of smog and offshore oil pollution. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a good, strong bill . . . a bill with teeth that will force a real 
reduction in the pollution that hurts people's health and damages the 
environment," said Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles). He, along with Rep. 
John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), was the principal architect of the agreements that 
finally allowed the bill to coast through the floor without serious opposition. 
</P>
<P>
The most difficult of these agreements were negotiated well before the bill 
came to the floor, in closed committee rooms where Waxman and Dingell, longtime 
adversaries in the clean air debate, hammered out compromises on automobile 
tailpipe emissions, smog control and measures to spread the cost of acid rain 
controls. 
</P>
<P>
Clean fuels -- the one major area that remained in dispute and seemed certain 
to provoke a showdown between industry supporters and clean air advocates -- 
was resolved only moments before it came up for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
A proposal by Waxman and Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands) would have mandated the 
nationwide sale of 1 million cars built to run on non-gasoline fuels. Under the 
compromise, that plan was dropped in favor of a five-year pilot program for 
California, which already has plans to use clean-fueled vehicles as part of its 
clean air efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The new vehicles would be phased into the California market starting with 
150,000 cars in model year 1994. That number would increase to 300,000 cars in 
1997, with the aim of getting 1 million clean-fueled cars onto California 
freeways by the year 1998. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the compromise would require only that fleet vehicles and mass 
transit buses in the country's 31 smoggiest cities be included in the 
clean-fuels program. But other states could opt into the program for private 
vehicles in 1999 if the Environmental Protection Agency judges the California 
pilot project a success. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a historic day for the people of Southern California," Lewis said. 
"Once again California is leading the national clean air debate." 
</P>
<P>
The only California congressman to vote against the legislation was Rep. 
William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton). Not voting was Rep. Bill Thomas 
(R-Bakersfield). 
</P>
<P>
Another House-passed amendment important to California was one that would put 
coastal pollution sources under EPA's jurisdiction and apply stricter onshore 
pollution standards to offshore sources. Offered by Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa 
Monica), it was adopted after the negotiators defused what would otherwise have 
been considerable opposition by agreeing to exempt Texas, Louisiana and Alabama 
from its jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
Dismissing a White House veto threat, the House also included in the bill a 
five-year, $250-million unemployment assistance package to help some of the 
thousands of workers who could lose their jobs as a result of the impact that 
tougher clean air regulations are expected to have on the coal mining, steel 
and chemical industries. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has threatened to veto the bill over any provision that 
raises the total yearly cost to business, government and individuals above $21 
billion. The Administration says the real cost of the unemployment package 
offered by Rep. Robert E. Wise Jr. (D-W.Va.) could add billions of dollars per 
year to the price of the legislation because it would create an open-ended 
liability for the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
But proponents of the amendment, which was overwhelmingly adopted by a vote of 
274 to 146, dismissed those estimates as exaggerated.

The Soviet government, seeking a popular mandate to transform the country's 
socialist economy into one based on market forces, announced plans Wednesday 
for an unprecedented national referendum on sweeping reforms that it 
acknowledges will double or triple many consumer prices and could put tens of 
millions of people out of work. 
</P>
<P>
Yuri D. Maslyukov, the first deputy prime minister, said that the government 
feels it cannot proceed with such major changes in the economic system without 
firm national support because of the fierce criticism the leaders have already 
encountered for breaking with socialism and for the harsh impact on most Soviet 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
"A transition as steep as this one is impossible without a national accord," 
Maslyukov told a press conference, arguing that the government sees no way 
other than a market economy to bring the country out of its deepening crisis. 
"If the government's plan is not accepted, then the government should resign." 
</P>
<P>
Voter approval of the program is far from certain, and the referendum, the 
first in Soviet history, is probably the boldest political gamble that 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has taken in his five years as the country's 
leader. Some of Gorbachev's most fundamental reforms of the Soviet system will 
be at stake in the vote, and if the proposal is defeated, his authority will be 
badly impaired. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, so controversial has the program become that Gorbachev, who has never 
faced the nation's electorate, clearly wants the mandate to proceed with the 
reforms despite opposition from Communist Party conservatives and the 
misgivings of ordinary workers. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, speaking to members of the Congress of People's Deputies of Russia, 
described the reform program as "a major turn . . . equal to the October 
Revolution" which brought the Bolsheviks to power in 1917. 
</P>
<P>
If the present government fails to win a clear mandate, Maslyukov speculated 
that, as in Poland last year, there could be "the convocation of a round-table 
conference of various political forces," including the emerging opposition 
parties, to work out a strategy that could command popular support. 
</P>
<P>
Radical reformers have been pressing for such talks to discuss not only present 
policies but new structures for making political and economic decisions. 
</P>
<P>
But Gennady Yanayev, the chairman of the Central Council of Trade Unions, 
expressed strong doubts about how effective a referendum on a transition to a 
market economy would be. 
</P>
<P>
"People discuss the market without even knowing what it is," Yanayev said. "We 
know more about space research than we do about market research. A lot of 
explanation is needed." 
</P>
<P>
Leonid I. Abalkin, the vice prime minister in charge of economic reform, 
contended that without a national consensus, as demonstrated by a victory in 
the planned referendum, the reforms could not proceed, the economic crisis 
would worsen and perestroika, Gorbachev's overall reform program, would fail. 
</P>
<P>
"We should not wait for a social explosion -- we should ensure that no 
explosion takes place . . ., " Abalkin said at the government's press 
conference. "If we had done this two or three years ago, it would have been far 
simpler. If we wait longer, we will have to pay a greater price. . . . Either 
we take this difficult choice or we load it onto the shoulders of our 
children." 
</P>
<P>
Nikolai Y. Petrakov, Gorbachev's top economic adviser, told a Soviet-American 
trade conference Wednesday that he thinks it is a blunder to defer the start of 
the plan, including the major price increases, for seven months until Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Petrakov said that announcing price increases so far in advance could cause 
consumers to buy everything now and prompt businesses to hold back as much as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
"This will create a panic, an economic panic," he said. "I think that we should 
not lose these seven months." 
</P>
<P>
The government plans, in fact, to raise some food prices July 1, starting with 
a threefold increase in bread prices, and to undertake many of the other 
changes, some of them by decree, before the referendum. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't wait," Maslyukov explained, noting that much time had already been 
lost in debating the reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Although no date has been set for the referendum and there is no existing law 
on holding a national referendum, it could come soon after the Communist Party 
congress in July or in early autumn after the vacation season. New laws will 
also be needed to put the economic reform program into effect, and the Supreme 
Soviet, the national legislature, is scheduled to reconvene in September to 
enact the measures. 
</P>
<P>
The government's program, approved Tuesday by the Presidential Council, the 
country's top policy-making body, is to be outlined in full today by Prime 
Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov as virtually the last chance to save the failing 
economy short of truly drastic measures. 
</P>
<P>
At its core, the program calls for the transformation of the centrally planned 
Soviet economy, based on state ownership, to a "regulated market economy" 
governed by supply and demand, increasingly but not totally privatized, more 
and more managed by entrepreneurs but overseen and regulated by the government. 
</P>
<P>
Among the elements outlined by Maslyukov were the dismemberment of the Soviet 
Union's vast infrastructure of industrial ministries, an immediate end to the 
monopolies enjoyed by many Soviet enterprises, freeing of the State Bank from 
governmental control and step-by-step measures to make Soviet currency, the 
ruble, convertible. 
</P>
<P>
Central planning would no longer focus on production quotas, Maslyukov said, 
but become mostly indirect and indicate general goals in the way that West 
Germany does in its planning. 
</P>
<P>
The first two years of the reforms, 1991 and 1992, will be the most difficult, 
he continued, with living standards likely to drop 5% to 6% a year because of 
the higher prices and likely increase in unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
The program envisions price increases of varying amounts throughout the Soviet 
economy -- energy prices would rise an average of 82%, food prices about 200%, 
consumer goods 43% -- in order to cover actual production costs and to reduce 
or eliminate the extensive subsidies. Many of the prices have remained 
unchanged for decades -- food, for example, since 1954. 
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for increased pay to compensate for the higher food prices, but 
it is still uncertain whether the compensation will be full or partial and 
whether it will come with the increases or lag behind. Eventually wages are 
expected to rise in accord with a consumer price index. 
</P>
<P>
The program also calls for the sale of some state enterprises to individuals 
and cooperatives, the leasing of other enterprises to their managers or workers 
to run on a profit-or-loss basis and the sale of shares in 220,000 industrial 
enterprises, about 70% of the country's total, as the first step toward 
privatizing them. An equities market would be set up to handle the buying and 
selling of shares. 
</P>
<P>
Massive unemployment could result from the changes, Soviet officials 
acknowledge, as unprofitable firms are closed -- about 30% of Soviet 
enterprises lose money and a similar number are marginal -- and unneeded 
workers are laid off at firms that are privatized. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 40 million people, about a quarter of the Soviet labor force, might 
have to find new jobs, Abalkin said, as the economy is restructured. Actual 
unemployment, which now is estimated at 2 million, could increase to 6 million 
or 8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Yanayev said that trade unions had demanded, as a condition for their support 
of the reforms, a government pledge to honor the constitutional guarantee of 
work for all by offering a job to anyone able and willing to work. They have 
also insisted on full compensation for any increase in the prices of food and 
consumer goods, he said, and salaries will be adjusted for the initial 
increases and then linked to a consumer price index. 
</P>
<P>
The program calls for the creation of a social security system to protect the 
low-paid, including pensioners, single-parent families, teachers, physicians 
and government employees.

BUSH'S SON DEFENDS ROLE AT S&amp;L, EXPLAINS LOAN TIES

Neil Bush, son of the President and a former savings and loan association 
director, told a congressional committee on Wednesday that he received a 
$100,000 loan "that was never meant to be repaid" from a millionaire customer 
of the association. 
</P>
<P>
The millionaire developer, Kenneth M. Good, invested the money for Bush in 
1984, a year before Bush joined the Silverado Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Assn. 
board. In 1986, Bush actively sought approval of a $900,000 line of credit for 
Good from Silverado. 
</P>
<P>
Good invested the $100,000 on his behalf in a speculative commodities scheme, 
Bush said. He was scheduled to share in any profits, but had no liability if 
the investment failed, he said. The investment later went sour, and Good 
formally canceled the loan in January. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds a little fishy," Bush told the House Banking Committee, explaining 
why he never mentioned the loan on a conflict-of-interest form required of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
"As a practical matter, the loan was forgiven the day the money was lost," said 
Bush, who was a director of Silverado. "The money was never meant to be repaid 
if there wasn't a success." 
</P>
<P>
Good also was Bush's business partner, providing capital for Bush's oil 
exploration firm. 
</P>
<P>
Bush told the committee Wednesday that he had never had any conflicts of 
interest while serving as a director of Silverado Savings, as regulators have 
charged in an administrative complaint. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the regulators' complaints are "frivolous. The fact they're being 
pursued is baffling to me." 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the $100,000 risk-free investment for Bush, Rep. Thomas R. Carper 
(D-Del.) asked, "Why is that not a conflict?" 
</P>
<P>
"It just isn't," responded Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The President's son blamed a depression in Colorado real estate for the 1988 
collapse of the Denver-based thrift. Taxpayers will ultimately pay an estimated 
$1 billion to dispose of the assets of Silverado and pay off depositors, whose 
accounts were federally insured up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators testified Tuesday that Bush voted to approve $106 million in 
loans from the S&amp;L to one of his business partners, Bill Walters. Bush 
failed to mention his relationship with Walters on thrift disclosure forms. 
Walters defaulted on the loans. 
</P>
<P>
Bush strongly denied that he acted improperly. "There was no conflict of 
interest in my voting on Bill Walters' matters," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have any interest, financial or otherwise, in any of Bill Walters' 
businesses," Bush added. "He was a partner in my business, but I wasn't a 
partner in any of his businesses." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why Good gave him a $100,000 risk-free investment, Bush answered that 
Good was wealthy and wanted to give him an opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Office of Thrift Supervision in January filed an administrative 
complaint against Bush, charging him with violating conflict-of-interest 
regulations for not disclosing the investment loan or his business partnership 
with Good and Walters. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is now before an administrative law judge. The head of the OTS, T. 
Timothy Ryan Jr., will ultimately decide whether to issue a "cease and desist" 
order barring the President's son from conflicts if he ever again works for a 
federally regulated financial institution. The issue could be referred to the 
Justice Department for further action. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the one who's in the hot seat," Ryan said Wednesday, when asked at a press 
conference about what action he might take in the Neil Bush case. 
</P>
<P>
Two major customers of Silverado, Walters and Good, were investors in JNB, an 
oil exploration company run by Bush. Walters contributed $150,000 in 1983 as a 
limited partner, and Good later invested $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I contributed sweat," Bush said. "I was out there working every day. I 
generated the deals." 
</P>
<P>
Bush appeared voluntarily at the Banking Committee hearing, which was examining 
the role of directors in contributing to the collapse of the institution. The 
committee voted Wednesday to subpoena Good, Walters, two former regulators who 
handled the case and Silverado's former chairman, vice chairmen and two 
directors. Joining Bush in voluntary testimony Wednesday were other former 
outside directors -- those who didn't have jobs at the company. 
</P>
<P>
"We did what was right in helping manage Silverado as a board of directors," 
Bush said. "I didn't lead the charge," he said, discussing Silverado loans to 
Walters. "The entire board reviewed those deals." 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the S&amp;L crisis, Bush added, "To finger-point and look for 
crooks where there are none is not a good service to this country." 
</P>
<P>
Committee members divided along partisan lines in their questioning of Bush. 
Democrats said Bush and the other directors must share the burden of the 
S&amp;L's failure. Republicans said the President's son bore no personal 
culpability. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no suggestion by anyone of any criminal conduct by any witnesses, 
including Mr. Bush," said Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa), a committee member. 
</P>
<P>
"Every member of the Silverado board must share responsibility for the 
mismanagement, the insider dealing, the self-financing schemes, the poor loans 
and the ultimate demise of the institution," said Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez 
(D-Tex.), the committee chairman.

EQUITY REFUGEES FROM THE RAT RACE ARE SELLING OUT AND BUYING HOMES IN SMALLER 
CITIES. MANY ARE AVOIDING MORTGAGES BY PAYING IN CASH.

Richard Eisman has three children in college, is without a regular job and 
lives in an isolated part of central Oregon, far from his roots in Los Angeles. 
But do not weep for him. He's living like a prince. 
</P>
<P>
His pockets full of cash from last year's sale of his home in the western San 
Fernando Valley, Eisman has bought a home in a tourist town named Bend that has 
lots of room and "a view that will knock your socks off." 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the flip side of the housing affordability problem. 
</P>
<P>
While the vast majority of Californians borrow heavily to finance their homes 
-- or cannot afford one at all -- a select and burgeoning group of property 
owners from California have so much money these days from sales of their 
previous homes that big down payments are no obstacle and all-cash purchases 
have become common. 
</P>
<P>
One home buyer in 12 paid cash for an existing home in California last year, 
compared with one in 27 in 1984, according to surveys by the California Assn. 
of Realtors, a real estate sales trade group. 
</P>
<P>
This new breed of cash-flush buyers, dubbed "equity refugees," are the lucky 
ones who reaped major windfalls in California's urban real estate boom of the 
late 1980s. They are now fleeing greater Los Angeles and San Francisco by the 
thousands for more bucolic surroundings in the West. 
</P>
<P>
They include youngish urban emigres, like Eisman, who are stampeding into small 
towns in Oregon and semirural California, where they can buy a home but don't 
have to worry about finding a full-time job right away. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the people here don't have to worry too much about working," said 
Frank C. Ruegg, a real estate broker in Bend. 
</P>
<P>
They also include large numbers of "empty nesters" who are moving by the 
thousands to burgeoning retirement communities in places like Las Vegas and San 
Diego. They live comfortably there on modest incomes with low or no monthly 
mortgage payments. 
</P>
<P>
The new money has breathed life into real estate markets in out-of-the-way 
places such as Redding, Calif., Ashland, Ore., and Bend, but it has also 
disrupted the local populace and sparked resentment among earlier arrivals. 
</P>
<P>
Consider Michael McRae, a free-lance writer who moved from Mill Valley near San 
Francisco to Ashland nearly two years ago so he and his wife could afford their 
first home. Now, McRae said, his property taxes are likely to swell 
dramatically because property values in Ashland are rising so fast. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm unhappy (about it)," he said, referring to the continuing stream of new 
arrivals from California. "I did not come up here to make a real estate 
investment." 
</P>
<P>
When McRae left California in 1988, the state was in the grip of its second 
round of blistering real estate inflation in two decades. The first occurred in 
the mid-to-late 1970s, followed by an equally furious price run-up that began 
in 1986 and ended in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s alone, median home values more than doubled in the state's major 
urban areas. A typical home in the Los Angeles area that sold for $101,000 in 
1980 is selling for more than $210,000 today. In San Francisco, the 
median-priced home that sold for $108,000 in March, 1980, sold for $262,000 in 
March, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The inflation has catapulted otherwise middle-class homeowners into entire new 
categories of wealth and status. About one in every three people who sold their 
homes in the Los Angeles area last year made more than $200,000 on the sale, 
according to a California Assn. of Realtors survey. 
</P>
<P>
M.G. and Dee Wildrick, both 69, recently bought a house in an upscale 
retirement community in Oceanside known as Leisure Village Ocean Hills for 
$252,000 -- an amount they paid in cash even though neither had high-income 
jobs when they worked. (She was an office worker and he worked for the post 
office.) 
</P>
<P>
Most of their wealth came from selling their home in Burbank -- bought 36 years 
ago for $16,200 -- for $287,000. Today, the couple is living virtually 
debt-free on an annual income of about $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything we have is paid for," Mr. Wildrick said proudly. "Our house, our 
motor home, our car." 
</P>
<P>
The price rises have driven even deeper wedges between the state's haves and 
have-nots, often within the same family. Parents often find they have more home 
equity than they ever imagined, while their children are struggling to buy 
their first home. Today, fewer than one family in five can afford California's 
typically priced home of about $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Though recent statistics show that California's total population is still 
growing, the same numbers indicate that more are leaving the Golden State as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
More than 300,000 people moved out of the state last year, about 6% more than 
in 1988, according to the state's Department of Finance, which tracks the 
figures through driver's license address changes. The most popular destinations 
included Washington, Nevada, Arizona and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
The outflow has Bend -- a tranquil resort town only a few years ago -- in the 
grip of a real estate and construction boom that is driving up rents and 
property values as much as 2% a month and putting a severe squeeze on the 
paychecks of local residents. 
</P>
<P>
The outward migration is also having tsunami-sized ripple effects on California 
towns like Redding, about 120 miles south of the Oregon border. Local real 
estate brokers say equity refugees have flooded the area in recent times. 
</P>
<P>
About one in five homes in Redding and surrounding Shasta County were paid for 
in cash during the first eight months of last year, according to figures from 
TRW Real Estate Information Services in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"We hear that in certain subdivisions in excess of 50% (of the buyers) are 
paying cash," said Redding real estate broker Richard Downs. 
</P>
<P>
Paying cash for a home has both advantages and disadvantages, and the final 
decision is usually a blend of emotion and economics that varies according to 
the wealth and age of the buyers, financial experts say. 
</P>
<P>
All-cash buys are not that attractive to wealthy younger buyers, who want the 
generous tax breaks afforded by interest expenses on home loans and do not want 
their money tied up in a single piece of real estate. It might be invested more 
profitably elsewhere, and there is always the danger that an earthquake or real 
estate price collapse could seriously undermine the home's value. 
</P>
<P>
All-cash purchases are a very attractive option, however, for 
security-conscious retirees living on fixed incomes who don't want to worry 
about monthly mortgage payments. Because they are usually living on lower 
incomes, retirees don't usually covet the tax deductions either. 
</P>
<P>
"What it comes down to is that people make decisions on what is going to make 
them sleep at night," according to Jan Nottingham, a financial planner in Los 
Angeles for IDS Financial Services, a subsidiary of American Express. 
</P>
<P>
Paying cash for a house is particularly common with retirees who remain haunted 
by memories of the Depression, when families lost their homes in the aftermath 
of the 1929 stock market crash. 
</P>
<P>
That financial catastrophe 61 years ago is one reason why retired Redondo Beach 
physician Edward O. Mitchell and his wife, Barbara, decided to pay cash for a 
$432,000 home in Leisure Village Ocean Hills. Dr. Mitchell's father lost the 
family home in Indianapolis after suffering heavy losses in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
"We both went through the Depression and we don't want any house payments," 
said Dr. Mitchell, who turns 70 next year. 
</P>
<P>
People like the Mitchells, though, often pay stiff taxes on profits from 
property-value increases when they buy less-expensive retirement homes. This is 
common with empty nesters who "trade down" in the market because their children 
have grown and they no longer need large homes. 
</P>
<P>
Though homeowners 55 or older are entitled to a one-time exclusion from tax of 
up to $125,000 of profits from property appreciation, taxes can still be 
fearsome because home values have risen so dramatically. The Mitchells had to 
pay taxes of nearly $215,000 on property appreciation of more than $1 million 
on the Palos Verdes home they bought in 1971 for $100,000 and sold 18 years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
It is generally a younger breed of buyer who is moving to towns like Bend, and 
they're typically seeking relief from the congestion of a San Jose or an Orange 
County. They often have lots of money to buy a home, but no full-time job. 
</P>
<P>
Situated on the eastern edge of the Cascade mountains, Bend is a town of 50,000 
and growing fast because real estate investors view property values there as 
big bargains. Bend bills itself as an undiscovered fishing and skiing 
playground that has a dry sunny climate and dramatic mountain landscape. 
</P>
<P>
One real estate developer from Orange County, David Madrigal, has acquired a 
dozen single-family homes in Bend now occupied by renters. "The real estate 
values are just playing catch-up now," he said. "They're so far behind 
California." 
</P>
<P>
Locals worry that Bend's most precious attractions -- clean air, lovely 
surroundings and gentle lifestyle -- are being compromised by the growth surge. 
The air is getting dirtier and traffic on summer holiday weekends is virtual 
gridlock, choked with cars, campers and logging trucks, locals point out. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at risk of jeopardizing the very reason why people from Los Angeles come 
here," said Gregory Cushman, publisher of the Bend Bulletin newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
To the new arrivals, though, Bend is Paradise Found and a stark contrast to 
life in urban California. 
</P>
<P>
"They're tired of the rat race," said real estate broker Ruegg, himself an 
urban dropout who moved from Contra Costa County near San Francisco seven years 
ago. "They're looking for a way out, and they can afford it." 
</P>
<P>
When Eisman and his wife, Ellen, left Los Angeles behind, they bid adieu to his 
insurance business in Woodland Hills and her practice as a psychologist. 
Neither had a job when they arrived in Bend last year. 
</P>
<P>
What they did have, however, were proceeds from the sale of their $644,000 home 
in Calabasas, which helped Eisman assume the role of real estate investor. So 
far, he bought a spacious $280,000 home with a large down payment and financed 
five other investment properties as well. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, his wife is working again and Eisman is doing insurance 
consulting work.

VAN DE KAMP TURNS TO SCHOOLCHILDREN IN EFFORT TO WARM UP HIS PUBLIC IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Behind in the polls and presumed to be behind in money raising, there was but 
one thing for John Van de Kamp to do Wednesday: try to out-shine the more 
telegenic Dianne Feinstein with a little pizzazz of his own. 
</P>
<P>
So it was that Van de Kamp found himself surrounded by clamoring children at a 
Santa Monica elementary school, sharing a meal of fried chicken and chocolate 
milk on an undersized bench while they peppered him with questions. 
</P>
<P>
A brief crisis surfaced almost immediately, when the attorney general was told 
he looked just like Jack Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
"You mean the Joker?" Van de Kamp said, gulping. "Did you like the Joker?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes!" the children, obviously acquainted with "Batman," thundered back. 
</P>
<P>
It was probably the only time in Van de Kamp's gubernatorial campaign that 
someone listening to him would proclaim -- breathlessly, as a 10-year-old girl 
did -- that "he is so radical." 
</P>
<P>
But the event was symbolic of Van de Kamp's dual requisite in the final two 
weeks of the primary campaign. 
</P>
<P>
First, to compete with what Van de Kamp acknowledges is a sense of warmth and 
empathy that Feinstein exudes, he must graft onto his somewhat dour public 
image a personality that can attract voters emotionally. Thus, frolicking with 
the schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he has to raise enough questions about Feinstein's capability 
to be governor that he speaks to pragmatists and fiscal worriers as well. Thus, 
Van de Kamp spent the morning and part of his school visit raising direct and 
not-so-direct questions about Feinstein's mastery of complex budget matters. 
</P>
<P>
Left until Election Day was the answer to the essential question: Can you 
persuade voters you're a nice, warm guy -- and simultaneously go on the attack? 
</P>
<P>
The results are crucial for a campaign that has had little objective good news 
lately. For weeks now, public opinion polls have trumpeted Feinstein's surge in 
popularity compared to Van de Kamp. The two recent televised debates, which Van 
de Kamp had hoped would boost him into orbit, appear at this point not to have 
markedly changed the campaign's dynamic. Another survey released Wednesday, the 
Teichner Poll, had Feinstein a stunning 17 percentage points above Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, Van de Kamp dismisses public polls as "all over the lot" and 
says his personal instinct is that the race remains close. But he describes 
himself as the "underdog" -- and the perception that he is falling behind has 
added new stress to the pressure-cooker of a nearing primary. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, Van de Kamp, 54, has expressed frustration with how little 
voters seem to know of him, and with the difficulty in changing his personality 
to fit the demands of a state whose politics are dominated by television. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't make myself into a Warren Beatty or a Marlon Brando," he said 
recently. "You can't change yourself. 
</P>
<P>
"I must say," he added, "you would think that after some 30 years in public 
life people would get a better sense of you." 
</P>
<P>
In person, Van de Kamp does come across more warmly than he does on television, 
where he appears to be what he is -- a lawyer -- and his dry sense of humor 
usually vanishes. But Van de Kamp's campaign has done little to change his 
image by the typical routes used by candidates in similar straits -- having him 
regularly campaign among voters, for example, or visit schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's visit to Grant Elementary School in Santa Monica marked a 
departure, and one he seemed to relish. As television cameras whirred, children 
rallied around him as if he was the Joker. A young girl shyly came around 
behind him and offered a smile. A classmate, a more boisterous boy, added a 
high-five. The questions came pell-mell. 
</P>
<P>
"If you get to be governor, what are you going to do about gangs?" asked one 
child, giving Van de Kamp a chance to tout his anti-crime initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"What are you going to do about pollution?" asked another. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you going to give better shelters for the homeless people," interrupted 
one fifth-grade girl. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, absolutely," the attorney general replied with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp acknowledged Wednesday that his opponent, the former San Francisco 
mayor, has an advantage in the charisma department. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a woman, she's telegenic. I think she speaks well, conveys warmth," he 
told reporters at a breakfast meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I tend to go to the side of substance," he added. ". . . I submit to you that 
by and large she has run on style." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's campaign, of course, disagrees, and polls would seem to suggest 
that whatever Feinstein is delivering, voters approve. For that reason, Van de 
Kamp has steadily been drumming on the question of Feinstein's fitness for 
office. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, for example, he repeated his criticism of Feinstein's statement 
that everything -- including cost-of-living adjustments for the elderly, blind 
and disabled -- would be on the table when it came to negotiating a solution to 
the state's $3.6-billion budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about children that have been abused; you're talking about 
welfare mothers and their children," he said. "That's what the COLAs 
(cost-of-living adjustments) are all about. They're not numbers." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp has laid out specific budget cuts and tax increases that he said 
would deal with the deficit, and has repeatedly challenged Feinstein, 56, to do 
the same. She has declined. Asked Wednesday whether he was questioning 
Feinstein's ability to understand the state budget, Van de Kamp replied: "Yes, 
I am." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's campaign issued a terse retort. 
</P>
<P>
"In order for a charge like that to be effective, it has to have some basis in 
fact," said Dee Dee Myers, Feinstein's press secretary. "He's clearly grabbing 
for straws in the final days of this campaign."

JUMPING THE GUN ON MEDI-CAL; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH CARE: THE PROGRAM'S CASH RESERVES ARE RAPIDLY DWINDLING. SOME NURSING 
HOMES ARE BILLING IT EARLY IN CASE THE MONEY RUNS OUT SOONER THAN PROJECTED. 
</P>

<P>
Some nursing homes are billing the state's Medi-Cal program early for money 
they normally would receive June 15 in order to tap into the public health 
insurance program's rapidly dwindling cash reserves, which may exhaust the 
money sooner than projected, Medi-Cal and nursing home industry officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, intense lobbying by health-care providers has added momentum to a 
bill that would appropriate additional money to state programs that are running 
out, including Medi-Cal. The so-called deficiency bill has been stalled in the 
Assembly, having failed twice to win enough votes for passage. But Judi Smith, 
a consultant to the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, whose chairman, John 
Vasconcellos (D-San Jose), is sponsor of the bill, said the pleas of nursing 
home operators have helped put the bill up for reconsideration Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Medi-Cal officials estimated last week that they had only enough money to meet 
obligations through the month of May, and would not be able to make four 
scheduled payments in June. The $7.5-billion program pays hospitals, doctors, 
nursing homes and medical suppliers to meet the health needs of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Medi-Cal officials authorized $116 million in payments for bills due 
in the third week of May and calculated the program has enough money to meet 
the month's final payment, estimated at about $108 million. 
</P>
<P>
But news of the June shortfall has spurred nursing homes to submit bills for 
incurred expenses they normally would bill several weeks from now, according to 
Ben Thomas, supervisor of Medi-Cal payments for the California Department of 
Health Services. That could swell next week's payment beyond what Medi-Cal can 
cover, forcing the program to make the final May payment according to a 
two-tiered priority schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals and nursing homes will get their money first. Doctors, clinics, 
laboratories, medical equipment vendors, ambulance companies and others in the 
program will be paid only if there is enough money for everyone in this second 
category, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hospitals and nursing homes, by the nature of what they do, have to provide 
24-hour care and food and utility services. So they will get priority," Thomas 
said. Medi-Cal participants hope for quick passage of the deficiency bill, 
which would infuse an estimated $168 million into the program. Though the 
scheduled reconsideration Friday allows for some optimism, many observers are 
pessimistic that the bill can overcome remaining hurdles in time. The bill must 
take effect by June 5 for Medi-Cal to make its first payment of the month. Last 
year's deficiency bill did not pass until September. 
</P>
<P>
Some nursing home operators traveled to Sacramento on Monday and Tuesday to 
push their representatives for action on the bill. Blaine Hendrickson, owner of 
four nursing homes in Orange, Los Angeles and Riverside counties, was one of 
them. He returned home to Orange County, discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
"The understanding we got is that the deficiency bill is very tied up this year 
because of controversial programs such as abortion funding attached to it, and 
also because the governor is reluctant to end the year with a deficit," said 
Hendrickson, whose company, Sun Mar Management Services of Orange, operates the 
nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian last week said the state is $3.6 billion short of what 
it needs to meet expenses and legal obligations in the 1990-1991 fiscal year 
beginning July 1, and projects a surplus of $86 million in the current year, 
not enough to fund the deficiency bill. 
</P>
<P>
Hendrickson has a page of sums and subtractions that detail the projected 
Medi-Cal shortfall's consequences for his business. Sun Mar leases and operates 
Del Mar Convalescent Hospital in Rosemead, Sunset Manor Convalescent Hospital 
in El Monte, Sun Mar Nursing Center in Anaheim and Laurel Convalescent Hospital 
in Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 318 total beds in the four facilities, 75% to 80% are occupied by 
Medi-Cal patients. In dollars, the program accounts for 65% of Sun Mar's total 
operating revenues, Hendrickson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Typically, we would have gotten company-wide a check for $293,000 from 
Medi-Cal on June 15," Hendrickson said. "Now we don't expect to, yet we have 
certain obligations we have to pay irrespective of whether we get Medi-Cal 
money or not. We have payroll, utilities, food for patients and rent. These are 
absolutes." 
</P>
<P>
He broke out the numbers for Del Mar Convalescent Home, a 59-bed facility with 
85% of the patients dependent upon Medi-Cal: 
</P>
<P>
The facility has monthly revenues of $114,000, of which $77,000 comes from 
Medi-Cal and the remaining $37,000 from private insurers, patient fees and 
Medicare, the federal health insurance program for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Monthly expenses include payroll of $28,000 due June 10 and again on June 25, 
plus fixed expenses for rent, utilities and food of about $18,500. These totals 
exclude the amounts due medical supply and equipment vendors. 
</P>
<P>
So Hendrickson calculates that he will have $37,000 in revenues to meet a 
minimum of $46,500 in expenses by June 10. He already has started talking to 
banks about extending him credit to cover the June 10 revenue gap, as well as 
providing an additional $28,000 for paychecks due Del Mar's 45 full- and 
part-time workers on June 25. 
</P>
<P>
"But they are not anxious to lend us the money when we can't say when we are 
going to get paid," Hendrickson said. 
</P>
<P>
He is also writing vendors to ask for credit. And he is one of the nursing home 
operators who on Tuesday billed Medi-Cal for a portion of the money due June 15 
in hopes of getting paid before the program's coffers run dry. 
</P>
<P>
"We got about $35,000 of bills into the computer system," Hendrickson said.

GRAND JURY LEAK BY SMITH AIDE ALLEGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New allegations that the state attorney general campaign of San Francisco Dist. 
Atty. Arlo Smith manipulated a high-profile investigation for political ends 
have surfaced in court documents filed this week. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Smith's campaign manager, Marc Dann, is accused in one of the sworn 
affidavits of having disclosed secret grand jury information to political 
campaign consultant Richard Schlackman, one of five men eventually indicted by 
a San Francisco grand jury for campaign financing violations in connection with 
a referendum to build a new stadium for the Giants baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
The sworn affidavit, filed by Schlackman, states that on one occasion, Dann 
"told me what had transpired in the grand jury proceedings that day." Ballpark 
foe Schlackman also swore that Dann told him that the stadium investigation was 
being pursued "because of the extraordinary publicity it was generating. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
A hearing has been scheduled for next Thursday in San Francisco in which a 
Municipal Court judge will consider defense motions to have the case thrown out 
because of alleged prosecutorial misconduct. The judge has rejected similar 
defense motions in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the campaign of Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner -- Smith's foe in 
the June Democratic primary -- called on Smith Wednesday to file misdemeanor 
charges against Dann for the alleged leak of grand jury information. 
</P>
<P>
"A possible crime has been brought to the attention of the district attorney's 
office that has been committed by his campaign manager," said Reiner's campaign 
manager, Sam Singer. "We want to know if he's going to do the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
The allegations come in the wake of Reiner's campaign being buffeted this week 
by charges that the Los Angeles prosecutor attempted to further his own 
political ends by leaking information to the media in the case of Erik and Lyle 
Menendez, who are accused of murdering their parents in their Beverly Hills 
mansion. Reiner also was blasted this week by the judge in the McMartin 
Pre-School molestation case for having a member of the district attorney's 
staff contact the jurist while he was on an out-of-town trip last week. 
</P>
<P>
Smith could not be reached for comment on the "Ballpark 5" case Wednesday. Dann 
called the charges contained in the affidavits "unadulterated lie(s)." 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what went on in the grand jury, not that I would have told him 
if I did," said Dann of Schlackman, a political consultant who is a distant 
relative of Smith's and who once served on the Smith campaign staff. "These are 
affidavits that have no other purpose than to create bad press for me." 
</P>
<P>
The defense charges that the ballpark indictments amount to selective 
prosecution because Smith does not usually investigate misdemeanor election 
offenses. Court documents reveal that last December, a month after the ballpark 
referendum was defeated, Dann contacted Smith's chief deputy to urge that the 
investigation be accelerated.

MEXICO ASKS U.S. TO EXTRADITE DOCTOR IN CAMARENA CASE; 
</P>
<P>
DRUG MURDER: BUT THERE APPEARS TO BE LITTLE POSSIBILITY THAT THE SUSPECT, WHO 
WAS ABDUCTED AND SHIPPED TO THE UNITED STATES, WILL BE RETURNED.

<P>
The Mexican government on Wednesday requested the extradition of a Guadalajara 
doctor who was abducted last month and spirited to the United States to stand 
trial in the 1985 torture-murder of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena. 
</P>
<P>
In a bulletin issued by the Foreign Ministry, the government said it was asking 
for the return of Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain "so that he may be investigated 
by the competent Mexican authorities regarding his very possible participation 
in crimes, the investigation and prosecution of which corresponds to Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez is accused of having administered drugs to revive Camarena during his 
torture and interrogation by drug traffickers trying to find out what he knew 
about official Mexican corruption. 
</P>
<P>
No one was immediately available for comment in the U.S. attorney's office in 
Los Angeles, where Alvarez is to stand trial in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
But all of the legal documents filed by prosecutors and statements by U.S. 
Atty. Gen. Richard Thornburgh indicate there is little possibility that the 
United States would agree to the extradition. 
</P>
<P>
The two countries have an extradition treaty, but it is rarely invoked. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing on whether Alvarez should stand trial is scheduled in Los Angeles on 
Friday before U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie, who is presiding at the 
trial of four defendants in the Camarena case. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor's lawyers have argued that charges should be dismissed because of 
"outrageous government misconduct" stemming from his abduction. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez was picked up in Guadalajara by armed men dressed in civilian clothes 
on April 2 and flown to El Paso, Tex., where Los Angeles-based Drug Enforcement 
Administration agents were waiting to arrest him. 
</P>
<P>
A DEA operative in Los Angeles subsequently admitted to arranging the abduction 
for the agency, although he claimed to have done so after the Mexican 
government reneged on a deal to swap the doctor for a Mexican fugitive being 
held in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The operative, Antonio Garate Bustamante, asserted that the clandestine 
kidnaping effort, dubbed "Wild Geese," was approved by DEA Agent Hector 
Berellez, who heads Operation Leyenda, the DEA unit investigating Camarena's 
kidnaping and murder. 
</P>
<P>
The slaying has soured relations between Mexican and U.S. law enforcement 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh denied anything untoward or any official involvement in the 
abduction of the doctor. U.S. attorneys have alleged that the Mexican attorney 
general may have had prior knowledge of the operation. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican Atty. Gen. Enrique Alvarez del Castillo adamantly denied any swap deal 
or government authorization of the kidnaping of Alvarez. He has blamed the 
abduction on Garate. 
</P>
<P>
Six people, including two state police officers and a former federal judicial 
police commander who allegedly carried out the abduction for Garate, have been 
arrested in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
In the bulletin Wednesday, the government said it had requested Alvarez's 
extradition through the Mexican Embassy in Washington. It said the government 
soon would seek the extradition of Garate, as well. The government has issued a 
warrant for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government reopened its investigation into the Camarena case last 
week in an apparent move to handle any new information that might come out of 
trials in Los Angeles.

NUCLEAR WARHEAD SAFETY PROBLEMS CITED; 
</P>
<P>
ARMS: ONE MISSILE WILL 'PROBABLY' BE RETIRED FROM ALERT STATUS. A NAVY WEAPON 
ALSO IS QUESTIONED.

<P>
Energy Department officials acknowledged Wednesday that several types of 
nuclear warheads in the U.S. arsenal have been plagued by safety problems that 
could cause them to burst open and scatter radioactive cancer-causing debris 
over a wide area. 
</P>
<P>
The officials told the Senate Armed Services Committee that all the weapons are 
now safe, but that conclusion was undercut by testimony from the directors of 
the three national U.S. laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Energy Department's most senior nuclear weapons official conceded 
that one of the troubled weapons, an air-launched missile widely deployed in 
the United States and Europe, will "probably" be retired from alert status in 
the wake of discoveries that the warhead could break apart if caught in an 
aircraft fire. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the direction in which we're going," said John C. Tuck, the Energy 
Department's undersecretary for defense programs. He added that the possibility 
of removing the Short-Range Attack Missile is being reviewed by Defense and 
Energy department officials. 
</P>
<P>
The safety lapses in the nuclear warheads almost certainly would not result in 
a nuclear detonation, although scientists would not rule out such a theoretical 
possibility. More likely, they said, the problems could cause weapons that were 
dropped, burned or hit in the wrong place to spew radioactive dust over a large 
area. 
</P>
<P>
In their testimony, the directors of the national laboratories warned that the 
nuclear warhead of the Short-Range Attack Missile is not safe and should be 
taken off those B-52, B-1 and FB-111 bombers that are on alert for short-notice 
missions. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally would like to see the exposure (of the bomber missiles) reduced 
at this time," said Albert Narath, president of Sandia National Laboratories. 
John Nuckolls, director of the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories, and Siegfried 
Hecker, director of the Los Alamos National Laboratories, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Nuckolls told reporters later that the odds of an accident involving the 
missiles are much less than one in 100. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other weapons questioned on safety grounds was the W-88 warhead, the 
nuclear tip of missiles carried aboard the Navy's Trident submarines. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post, which first reported the nuclear dangers in its Wednesday 
editions, said that Energy Department investigators found that if the 
propellant of the missiles carried aboard Trident submarines caught fire, the 
W-88 warhead could spread nuclear debris or even detonate. If such an accident 
occurred during the loading of such missiles at Trident bases in Bangor, Wash., 
or King's Bay, Ga., nearby population centers could be devastated, they 
reportedly concluded. 
</P>
<P>
But Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, speaking at a press conference in 
Brussels, said Wednesday that the W-88 "has been found and still is found a 
safe weapon when properly and safely deployed," adding that it "does meet all 
the current nuclear explosive safety standards." 
</P>
<P>
Tuck added that nuclear weapons safety "receives high-priority attention" in 
the Energy Department, which oversees the production of nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, a retired admiral, also testified before the 
panel, but in closed session only. 
</P>
<P>
Tuck said that after the problems were discovered, starting in 1988, the Energy 
and Defense departments established a permanent safety committee to ensure that 
lapses are identified and addressed. 
</P>
<P>
The most politically sensitive safety lapse was discovered in early 1988 in the 
W-79 nuclear artillery shell. The Post reported Wednesday that Energy 
Department investigators discovered that the warheads could burst open if hit 
forcefully in a sensitive spot.

PANAMA, NICARAGUA AID TO COST SALVADOR; 
</P>
<P>
CENTRAL AMERICA: BAKER STRIKES A DEAL WITH KEY LAWMAKER. IT WILL PENALIZE THE 
SALVADORAN REGIME FOR HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES.

Secretary of State James A. Baker III struck a deal Wednesday with a key 
lawmaker that signals a sharp future cutback in military aid to El Salvador and 
assures rapid delivery of $720 million in aid to help restore the ravaged 
economies of Panama and Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Joe Moakley (D-Mass.) said Baker promised to negotiate in good faith on 
legislation to slash aid to El Salvador as a protest of human rights abuses by 
government troops during a 10-year-old civil war with leftist rebels. 
</P>
<P>
The Salvadoran aid reduction will be attached to next year's foreign aid 
appropriations bill, scheduled for House consideration in late June, Moakley 
told reporters after his telephone conversation with the secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
In return, Moakley and House Democratic leaders agreed to clear for passage, 
probably today, an emergency appropriations bill that earmarks $420 million for 
Panama's reform government and $300 million for Nicaragua's new non-Communist 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
Both countries were devastated by U.S. sanctions during the reigns of Gen. 
Manuel A. Noriega in Panama and Sandinista President Daniel Ortega in 
Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
"No one wants to be responsible for what happens in Nicaragua or Panama in the 
next few weeks," said Moakley, who could have sought to stall the Central 
American aid through his clout as chairman of the House Rules Committee, which 
serves as traffic cop for legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) insisted on approving the aid bill, as 
President Bush had asked, before Congress leaves for a two-week Memorial Day 
recess. And Moakley agreed that the House did not want to turn its back on 
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the new Nicaraguan president who recently declared 
that her nation is bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
Moakley's negotiating position with Baker was bolstered by a surprisingly 
strong 250-to-163 vote in the House on Tuesday night to cut El Salvador's 
military aid from $85 million to $42.5 million this year and next year. 
</P>
<P>
The action signaled Congress' growing dissatisfaction with a decade of reports 
of death squad activity by El Salvador's armed forces, capped by the slayings 
last year of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
While the vote was described as symbolic because the underlying foreign aid 
authorization bill later was defeated, Moakley disputed the term. 
</P>
<P>
"That was not a throwaway vote -- it's etched," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Foley, meanwhile, termed it a "watershed vote," reflecting a tougher attitude 
by the House toward atrocities in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the military aid cut amendment, chiefly sponsored by Moakley, said 
it would undercut the Salvadoran regime's negotiating position at peace talks 
with the left-wing guerrillas and undermine reform efforts by President Alfredo 
Cristiani. 
</P>
<P>
But supporters noted that the amendment would have allowed Bush to restore the 
aid if the guerrillas launch another offensive or receive more arms from 
abroad. Bush also could restore the aid if the Administration determines the 
rebels are not bargaining in good faith at peace talks sponsored by the United 
Nations. The two sides, meeting in Caracas, Venezuela, approved an agenda and a 
six-month period to complete the talks, a U.N. spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment also would require a cut-off of aid if Cristiani is deposed by a 
coup or if his government does not thoroughly investigate the Jesuits' murders. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency appropriations bill, which passed the House early in April, was 
expanded in the Senate to include unrelated domestic spending and now totals 
$3.4 billion.

ROH STARTS TOKYO VISIT STIRRING EMOTIONS ON BOTH SIDES;

JAPAN: THE SOUTH KOREAN LEADER IS TO DISCUSS ECONOMIC TIES AND OTHER QUESTIONS.

<P>
South Korean President Roh Tae Woo arrived here today for a controversial state 
visit that is arousing intense emotions in both Japan and South Korea over the 
bitter historical legacy shared by the Asian neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Roh set the tone of his three-day visit on May 14 when he told Japanese 
reporters in Seoul that he hopes Emperor Akihito will make a clear-cut apology 
to South Koreans for Japan's 1910-1945 colonization of the Korean Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Irritated Japanese officials at first publicly rejected the demand, saying the 
constitution forbids the emperor from playing a "political role." But on 
Wednesday, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu reportedly sent an envoy to Seoul to 
discuss the text of an apology statement being drafted for delivery by Akihito 
during an imperial banquet in Roh's honor tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Anger over Japanese colonial brutality runs deep in Korea, and demands for an 
unequivocal apology from Akihito have been raised in recent street 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Protests culminated Wednesday with a 33-year-old videotape dealer, Kim Kuk Bin, 
stabbing himself in the abdomen before the Japanese Embassy in Seoul as he 
shouted: "Apologize, Akihito!" 
</P>
<P>
Kim was rushed by police to a nearby hospital, where he told a news conference 
he was no longer able to endure Japan's "lukewarm" attitude about the apology, 
the Associated Press reported from Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
A series of minor acts of sabotage in Japan, meanwhile, have been blamed on 
right-wing and left-wing radicals opposing Roh's visit, and security has been 
extremely tight in Tokyo since the beginning of the week; police have deployed 
20,000 more officers. 
</P>
<P>
Roh, the second South Korean president ever to visit Japan, originally planned 
to come in late 1988 but postponed the trip because of the illness of Emperor 
Hirohito, Akihito's father. 
</P>
<P>
Hirohito, known as Emperor Showa since his death in January, 1989, met former 
President Chun Doo Hwan in 1984 and made a vaguely worded expression of regret 
that many South Koreans now feel was insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
"It is indeed regrettable that there was an unfortunate past between us for a 
period in this century," Hirohito told Chun, "and I believe that it should not 
be repeated." 
</P>
<P>
The South Korean side has maintained that an imperial apology can be 
satisfactory only when it clarifies which country was the aggressor and which 
the victim, laying to rest forever suspicions that Japan has no remorse for its 
behavior. Only when the matter is clarified can the two countries build 
positive relations, said Lee Hong Koo, a special adviser to Roh. 
</P>
<P>
"Collectively speaking, Koreans are not really sure of the depth of sincerity 
on the part of the Japanese," Lee said during a recent visit to Tokyo. "Some 
Koreans feel that the Japanese think what went wrong was that they lost the 
war." 
</P>
<P>
Kyodo News Service, in a dispatch Wednesday, quoted a senior Japanese Foreign 
Ministry official as saying that Kaifu's Cabinet is drafting a speech for 
Akihito that should "satisfy the expectations of the Korean people." 
</P>
<P>
Besides his audience and banquet with the emperor tonight, Roh is scheduled to 
hold two rounds of talks with Kaifu and to address the Japanese Parliament on 
Friday. The two leaders are expected to discuss economic ties and the sticky 
question of technology transfers, as well as humanitarian questions concerning 
Japan's large Korean minority. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 700,000 Koreans are registered as permanent residents in Japan, many of 
them second-generation descendants of laborers brought here, sometimes 
forcibly, during the colonial period. Discrimination in education, employment 
and marriage is a serious problem for those who refuse to adopt Japanese names 
and fully assimilate. 
</P>
<P>
One of the preconditions for Roh's visit was an agreement on the legal status 
of so-called "third generation" Korean residents, offspring of Koreans who were 
born in Japan since 1971. At last count, there were four infants in this 
category, and they had no right to permanent residency because they were not 
covered in immigration protocols adopted when the two nations normalized 
relations in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiators agreed April 30 that third-generation Koreans would not only have 
the right to residency, they would also be exempt from the alien fingerprinting 
requirements that critics say has come to symbolize discrimination against the 
Korean minority. 
</P>
<P>
South Korea is still seeking compensation for Korean victims of the atomic 
bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. These people have been denied the same 
government health benefits and pensions received by Japanese victims. Also, 
Japanese humanitarian assistance is being sought for Korean laborers left 
behind on Soviet Sakhalin, which was part of Tokyo's empire until the end of 
the war. 
</P>
<P>
Taizo Watanabe, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, said Japan has been 
consistent over the years in having "very deep" feelings of apology toward 
Korea.

ROMANIA PARTY'S MONOPOLY ON POWER MAY IRRITATE EMOTIONAL, SOCIAL WOUNDS; 
</P>
<P>
DEMOCRATIZATION: THE NATIONAL SALVATION FRONT'S COMMANDING POSITION FEEDS FEARS 
OF A REBIRTH OF COMMUNISM.

<P>
The National Salvation Front's control of the presidency and both houses of 
Parliament gives the party spawned by last December's revolution a virtual 
monopoly on power that may irritate Romania's emotional and social wounds. 
</P>
<P>
The front's commanding position after an election marred by domination, deceit 
and excess feeds the fear of those who see the loosely organized political 
force as a haven for ex-Communists seeking to re-impose one-party rule. 
</P>
<P>
Romanians had 88 parties to choose from when they cast their ballots Sunday, 
yet all but the front polled far less than 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Newly elected President Ion Iliescu, at a press conference with foreign 
journalists, gave little indication that the victorious front is in the mood 
for modesty and conciliation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very sad when someone doesn't know how to lose," Iliescu responded when 
asked about widespread allegations that the front stacked the election deck in 
its own favor. "The opposition doesn't want to accept the result only because 
it is not in its favor." 
</P>
<P>
With no effective opposition to give voice to their concerns, Romanians who are 
worried that too much of the old regime has sur vived the bloody revolution 
that toppled Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu may again resort to violence 
to express their dissent. 
</P>
<P>
However, the front has cast its resounding victory as an indication of popular 
desire for order and tranquillity after 50 years of tyranny and a campaign that 
served more to instigate than to inform. 
</P>
<P>
Iliescu's opponents tried to delay the election, a strategy that backfired in a 
nation weary of provisional government and the political uncertainties delaying 
foreign investment and economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old Iliescu, who served as interim head of state after the 
revolution, said he is open to negotiation with defeated rivals who would like 
to play a role in a coalition government. But he berated his presidential 
challengers, the Liberals' Radu Campeanu and millionaire emigre Ion Ratiu of 
the National Peasants Party, for running campaigns based on "attacks and 
instigation to violence." 
</P>
<P>
Silviu Brucan, a Communist diplomat-turned-dissident under Ceausescu and now 
the ideological conscience of the front, said he is "very seriously concerned 
about the magnitude of the electoral victory of the front." In a two-hour 
interview, he expressed grave worry about the front's tendency to be more 
enchanted by its preordained landslide than sobered by the threat it poses for 
Romania's fragile political health. 
</P>
<P>
Quoting Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, Brucan said he fears the front risks 
succumbing to "dizziness after success." It would be better served to develop 
internal factions within the party and to encourage outside pressure groups as 
checks on its authority, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think my friend Iliescu should now avoid being surrounded by yes-men and 
sycophants who are trying to force their way to the center of power," he 
warned. 
</P>
<P>
Iliescu and the front are burdened with having to build a government that will 
carry out policies it has not yet clearly defined. Because the front initially 
said it would not seek elected offices, its members decided during a national 
gathering in January against setting up a formal party structure and forging an 
ideological identity. 
</P>
<P>
But the front proved relatively effective in restoring the machinery of 
government after the revolution, procuring food for the shops and electricity 
to run factories and heat homes, which bodes well for its ability to overcome 
the lack of political organization. 
</P>
<P>
The Parliament is required by the constitution to convene within 20 days of the 
election, at which time Iliescu will name a prime minister and Cabinet. Iliescu 
said at the press conference that interim Prime Minister Petre Roman, a 
charismatic 40-year-old technocrat, will be his choice for this post. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the front must mend fences with the opposition parties it so 
roundly defeated, which foreign observers and domestic rivals contend was the 
result of front control of the mass media and state resources during the first 
multi-party campaign in half a century. 
</P>
<P>
The Peasants Party has categorically rejected any role in a coalition, but 
front officials such as Brucan have said the leadership would gain from Liberal 
membership in the Cabinet, possibly a ministerial seat for Campeanu. The front 
has also indicated interest in working with representatives of the Hungarian 
minority of 2 million, with environmentalists and with independent groups that 
would strengthen the front's links with professionals and specialists who will 
be the essential players in reshaping Romania's economy. 
</P>
<P>
The front's attitude toward dissent will likely be the first test of its 
commitment to democratic ideals. Iliescu was asked Wednesday whether he stands 
by a promise made last week that he would not use violence against the student 
demonstrators who have occupied University Square since April 22. 
</P>
<P>
He said no force will be used against the demonstrators, then added, "I hope." 
</P>
<P>
A further check on the front's dominance of Romanian politics could come from 
abroad if Western governments attempt to tie financial aid for recovery to 
progress in developing pluralism. 
</P>
<P>
The new government wants joint-venture investments and most-favored-nation 
trade status from Washington, as well as stronger trade ties with other 
nations.

PASSENGER DRAGGED FROM SEAT AS COMMUTER JET WINDOW BLOWS OUT

A window of a commuter jet with 18 people aboard blew out at 14,000 feet 
Wednesday, dragging a man from his seat as other passengers clung to him and 
forcing the pilot to make a quick descent and emergency landing. 
</P>
<P>
The man, identified as Gayle Sears of Portland, Ore., suffered minor cuts and 
bruises and was treated for possible shock before his release from Highline 
Community Hospital near Sea-Tac Airport, Horizon Air spokesman Nancy Hamilton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sears was buckled into his seat in the second row on the right side of 
the plane, the sudden decompression dragged him toward the window as other 
passengers grabbed him, passengers told officials. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the window blew out as the Fairchild Metro 3 jet passed over 
Olympia on a flight from Portland to Seattle. The window popped out cleanly and 
reportedly did not break. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no indication that the window had been struck," Hamilton said. "We 
consider this to be an isolated incident." 
</P>
<P>
Horizon Air ordered inspections on all 33 of the Fairchild planes in its fleet 
as the aircraft make their next landings at airports with maintenance centers, 
Hamilton said.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / INSURANCE COMMISSIONER; 
</P>
<P>
ZELMAN, GARAMENDI UNVEIL CAMPAIGN ADVERTISING PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Democratic insurance commissioner candidate Walter Zelman has unveiled a 
television advertisement portraying him as the only major candidate who is 
taking no special interest money in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Zelman, former director of California Common Cause, says in his 30-second 
television commercial that his lack of special interest financial support means 
that "my campaign can't afford a major television ad campaign." 
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes to be able to buy up to $40,000 in air time before the June 5 
primary. This compares with reported television commitments by other Democratic 
candidates thus far exceeding $700,000 for state Sen. John Garamendi (D-Walnut 
Grove), and close to $600,000 for State Board of Equalization Chairman Conway 
Collis and TV commentator Bill Press. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was revealed that Garamendi has obtained, for an undisclosed 
price, the services of the Berman &amp; D'Agostino campaign firm. The firm, 
which has a reputation for shrewd and often controversial campaigning, calls 
itself BAD Campaigns and is the campaign arm of the powerful political machine 
headed by Reps. Howard Berman and Henry Waxman, Democratic congressmen from Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Revels Cayton, Garamendi's campaign manager, said, "We've hired BAD to produce 
a television spot for us and that's being completed in time for Memorial Day, 
and we're going to be on their slates." 
</P>
<P>
Cayton added that, "I'm not sure, no one is precisely sure, how much mail will 
be going out in our behalf." But managers in at least three other campaigns 
said they had been told that Berman and D'Agostino will send out at least three 
pieces of mail on Garamendi's behalf to households throughout California 
containing at least two Democrats who had previously shown a high propensity to 
vote. They estimated that mail alone could cost Garamendi $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
Press, who has either led or closely trailed Garamendi in a number of polls, 
commented that "not even the talents of Michael Berman (one of the partners in 
the firm) can sell California voters a professional politician who did not 
support Proposition 103." 
</P>
<P>
But obtaining the services of the Berman firm has long been seen as a vital 
prerequisite for a Garamendi primary victory. 
</P>
<P>
The senator, who has run unsuccessfully twice before for statewide office, 
carried a large majority of the state's 58 counties in 1986 in his race for 
state controller against Gray Davis, but his weak spot was the Los Angeles 
metropolitan area. That is the area where the Berman political machine is 
strongest. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi, criticized by Zelman for taking campaign contributions from many 
political action committees, does not get contributions from the trial lawyers, 
who are mainly backing Press, and has returned most contributions from the 
insurance industry. But he is collecting heavily from medical practitioners and 
other powerful Sacramento lobbies, while vowing to defend consumer interests. 
</P>

Zelman has a 30-second commercial that tries to get across the point that he is 
the only major candidate in the race who is independent of the special 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
At a maximum, Zelman says he will be able to afford only $40,000 worth of air 
time, not much by statewide campaign standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Elements of the ad, with an analysis by Times staff writer Kenneth Reich: 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "Not many people will see this ad because I don't take special interest 
money," an unsmiling Zelman declares. "I don't take money from the insurance 
industry. I don't take money from trial lawyer associations, and I don't take 
money from political action committees. And I'm the only major candidate who 
can say that." He concludes, "If you want to elect a fund raiser, vote for the 
guy with the most commercials. If you want to elect a consumer leader, vote for 
me. . . . I'm the one without the special interest money." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: This ad is franker than most, and its main elements are correct. Of 
the candidates in the top two or three positions in the polls on both the 
Democratic and Republican sides, Zelman is the only one to bar taking money 
from all three powerful interest groups. One phrase, however, "trial lawyer 
associations," is carefully worded. Zelman does take money from individual 
trial lawyers, and this is potentially a sizable loophole in his purist 
position. Zelman, however, has supported no-fault auto insurance, so few trial 
lawyers are contributing to his campaign. The phrase "major candidate" is, of 
course, subjective, because some candidates may or may not be considered 
"major." Democrat Ray Bourhis, for example, also does not take money from the 
three interests. "The guy with the most commercials" is an apparent gibe at one 
of two Democrats, state Sen. John Garamendi or television commentator Bill 
Press, both of whom have made major television buys. Garamendi has raised 
considerable money from political action committees and Press considerable 
money from trial lawyers. Zelman, whose campaign is nearly broke, doesn't take 
from either.

DISSENTER ON 'STAR WARS' LEAVES LIVERMORE LAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A nuclear weapons scientist who publicly questioned the feasibility of a key 
part of the Star Wars program is leaving Lawrence Livermore National 
Laboratory, where he once did battle with one of the legendary names in nuclear 
physics, Edward Teller. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Woodruff, 49, former director of Livermore's nuclear weapons program, 
announced Wednesday that he is moving to the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 
New Mexico, where he will become a senior adviser in the arms control and 
verification program. 
</P>
<P>
Woodruff stepped down as leader of Livermore's weapons program in 1985 after a 
bitter dispute with Teller -- "father of the H-bomb" -- and Teller's protege, 
Lowell Wood. He accused the two scientists of being "overly optimistic" and 
misleading then-President Reagan about the feasibility of using space-borne 
lasers to zap enemy missiles. 
</P>
<P>
After the dispute became public, Woodruff, a highly respected researcher who 
has spent 21 years at the laboratory, found himself left with little to do. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Woodruff acknowledged in a telephone interview that "of course 
(the dispute) had something to do" with his decision to switch to Livermore's 
rival institution at Los Alamos. Both laboratories are are managed by the 
University of California for the U.S. Department of Energy . 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm very happy with the decision," he said. "I respect the people at this 
lab but I think it's time to move on. I'm delighted with this opportunity. 
We're putting the controversy behind us." 
</P>
<P>
The move came as no surprise. Woodruff put his home up for sale in the San 
Francisco Bay Area community of Livermore a couple of years ago, explaining 
that he feared his position there might become "untenable." 
</P>
<P>
His fight with Teller, who now is an associate director emeritus at Livermore, 
grew out of a disagreement over the "Super Excalibur" project, an orbiting 
X-ray laser that -- theoretically -- would concentrate beams of light from a 
nuclear explosion so intensely that they would destroy missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Teller, a Reagan confidant, pushed the program in Washington, arguing that 
Excalibur could be a crucial part of a nuclear shield that would protect this 
nation from an intercontinental attack by the Soviet Union. Reagan bought the 
concept and the Strategic Defense Initiative, popularly known as "Star Wars," 
was born. 
</P>
<P>
But Woodruff thought Teller and others at Livermore had vastly oversold the 
program, and he said later he was denied the opportunity to make his views 
known to the President. The debate finally reached the public arena and 
Woodruff found himself criticized by everyone from the secretary of energy on 
down. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was given a routine job with little to do, and finally he filed a 
complaint with the University of California, charging that he was being 
punished for criticizing the laser program and Teller. The university upheld 
the complaint and ordered to lab to give him a better job. 
</P>
<P>
He became head of the lab's effort to develop techniques for verifying 
compliance with nuclear arms treaties. He said Wednesday he will continue that 
work in his new home in New Mexico.

BROWN DENIES MAKING 'KITCHEN' REMARK 
</P>

<P>
The Capitol's latest mystery isn't a "whodunit" but a "did-he-say-it." 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown is hopping mad, and he's turning up the heat on 
those who allege he suggested that the League of Women Voters should "stay in 
the kitchen where it belongs." 
</P>
<P>
The angry San Francisco Democrat has accused a reporter of calling him a liar 
and publicly threatened to fire an aide who inadvertently helped fan the 
flames. 
</P>
<P>
The object of Brown's ire was a second-hand report in a political newsletter 
alleging that he made the "kitchen" comment in March at a conference of 300 
women in Ontario. Brown supposedly uttered the sexist slur because he was 
peeved at the League of Women Voters for backing Proposition 119, which would 
take the power to draw political district lines away from the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Like a snowball rolling downhill, the story grew as it was repeated by 
political columnists and newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times, until 
Brown sought Tuesday to bury the matter. Denying that he ever made the comment, 
Brown delivered a tongue-lashing to the reporter who started it all and to the 
press in general. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the real tragedies of your business that sometimes you chase a 
story without asking anybody, including the person who allegedly said it, 
whether or not they said anything of that nature," Brown told reporters. "Many 
times for your own purposes, you'll print, 'When asked if they said it, they 
denied it.' " 
</P>
<P>
When Bud Lembke, publisher of the newsletter Political Pulse, told Brown he was 
the one who first reported the comment, the Speaker turned on him. 
</P>
<P>
"You're calling me a liar," Brown said. "You made a mistake and you refuse to 
acknowledge your mistake if you wrote that stupid column." 
</P>
<P>
Lembke reminded Brown that his own press aide, Charles Dalldorf, had confirmed 
the account. In his April 13 newsletter, Lembke quoted Dalldorf as saying that 
Brown meant that the league's members "should stay in the kitchen because, 
basically, they have the luxury since they are generally all white and 
well-to-do." 
</P>
<P>
Brown, referring to Dalldorf's use of the word "kitchen," said: "He will get 
fired if in fact he used that term with you." 
</P>
<P>
The Speaker summoned his aide to the press conference and afterward, in front 
of his boss and a throng of reporters, Dalldorf confessed that Lembke had 
quoted him accurately. But Dalldorf said he had "postulated" what Brown might 
have meant without speaking to the lawmaker directly. Dalldorf remained on the 
staff Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In a May 11 letter to the Sacramento Bee, Brown admitted using the word kitchen 
but said his quote had been mangled: "Where was the league, I asked, when the 
Proposition 119 endorsement was under consideration? Was it in the kitchen or 
elsewhere?" 
</P>
<P>
Several newspaper reporters covered the event, but none mentioned the comment 
in their stories. They since have said that they don't remember it. Democratic 
Assemblyman Gerald Eaves of Rialto, who sponsored the conference, confirmed 
Brown's account. 
</P>
<P>
But Sandy Hester of Claremont, who also was there, insists that Brown made the 
remark. Hester is a lifelong Democrat, a former party official and the 1988 
Democratic nominee in the 25th Senate district. 
</P>
<P>
"If Brown doesn't want things repeated, he shouldn't say them," Hester said 
Wednesday.

DRUG FIGHTS ANEMIA IN PATIENTS ON AZT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT STEINBROOK, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A genetically engineered drug decreases the blood transfusion requirements of 
some AIDS patients taking the widely used AIDS drug AZT, according to a small 
study published in today's New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
The drug, recombinant human erythropoietin, stimulates the production of 
oxygen-carrying red blood cells. It is already available to AIDS patients under 
a U.S. Food and Drug Administration expanded-access program and may be approved 
for prescription sales later this year. 
</P>
<P>
AZT therapy is increasingly recommended for AIDS patients and those with 
pre-AIDS conditions as a means of controlling the human immunodeficiency virus, 
which causes the disease. 
</P>
<P>
But many patients need to receive blood transfusions or modify their use of the 
drug because they develop low red blood cell counts, or anemia. A drug that 
decreases the frequency of AZT-related anemia by stimulating the bone marrow to 
produce more red blood cells would ease the demand for blood transfusions and 
allow more patients to benefit from AZT. 
</P>
<P>
Erythropoietin is cloned from a hormone of the same name that is normally 
present in the body. The researchers found that the AIDS patients with small 
amounts of erythropoietin in their blood were likely to respond to 
thrice-weekly injections of the drug while patients with higher concentrations 
were not. About three-quarters of AIDS patients have low erythropoietin levels, 
according to Dr. Steven Miles, a senior AIDS investigator at the UCLA Medical 
Center and one of the authors of the study. 
</P>
<P>
"The drug works," Miles said. "It is very effective as an adjunct to specific 
therapy for AIDS. Patients may still have the virus and all the complications 
related to that but this is one less problem they have to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
Miles said ongoing research suggests that advances in AIDS care have increased 
the potential effectiveness of erythropoietin. Patients are typically treated 
with lower doses of AZT, or zidovudine, than were used in the study. As a 
result, anemia is less likely to occur and is easier to reverse. In addition, 
some AIDS patients can be switched to other drugs that do not cause anemia, 
such as the experimental drug DDI. 
</P>
<P>
Erythropoietin, marketed under the brand name Epogen by Amgen Inc. in Thousand 
Oaks, has been successfully used to treat the anemia associated with chronic 
kidney disease. But the drug is also used by athletes to enhance performance, a 
practice that researchers believe can be dangerous, even fatal. An excessive 
number of red blood cells can cause the blood of otherwise healthy people to 
thicken, creating a risk of strokes and heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
The study was funded by the Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp. of Raritan, N.J., which 
has approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to develop 
erythropoietin as an AIDS-related therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Ortho has not yet said how much its erythropoietin will cost. But if Ortho's 
charges for a vial of medication are similar to Amgen's, a year's supply for an 
AIDS patient will cost about $4,000, Miles said. 
</P>
<P>
For reasons that are not well understood, AIDS patients taking AZT have widely 
varying concentrations of erythropoietin in their bloodstreams. 
</P>
<P>
During the three-month study, 29 patients received erythropoietin injections 
and 34 received placebo injections. 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the study, the AIDS patients with low erythropoietin levels 
required an average of about 1.5 units of blood a month. At the end of the 
study, those receiving erythropoietin required an average of 0.84 units of 
blood a month, while those receiving the placebo required an average of 2.74 
units of blood a month. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, at the beginning of the study the AIDS patients with high 
erythropoietin levels required an average of about 3.2 units of blood a month. 
At the end of the study, those receiving erythropoietin required an average of 
3.5 units of blood a month, while those receiving the placebo required 2.78 
units of blood a month. These differences were not statistically significant.

The City Council soundly rejected a mandatory water conservation measure and 
instead opted for a voluntary system designed to cut water use. The council 
voted to create a voluntary conservation program calling on residential, 
business and industrial users to cut their water use by at least 10% during the 
next two months. Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who introduced the voluntary program, 
pledged to seek mandatory conservation measures in 60 days if the voluntary 
effort fails to generate the 10% cut needed to offset drought conditions.

HELP FOR VENTURA RESCUE WORKERS URGED; 
</P>
<P>
PROPOSAL: PROGRAM WOULD AID EMERGENCY SERVICES PERSONNEL WHO HAVE SUFFERED 
PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA IN THEIR WORK.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No matter how hard she tries, Julie Bridges cannot forget the train accident 
that dismembered a Simi Valley man three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges, a Ventura County paramedic in 1987, combed the railroad tracks 
searching for the bloodied parts of his torn body -- first one leg, then the 
other, next the torso and finally the man's head. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't close my eyes that night because I kept seeing body parts," said 
Bridges, who is now the assistant administrator for the Ventura County 
Emergency Medical Services Division. "I keep remembering it, and I suppose I'll 
have a long-term problem with it." 
</P>
<P>
Bridges is one of many emergency services workers -- such as paramedics, 
firefighters and police officers -- who have suffered psychological trauma that 
lingers long after witnessing particularly gruesome accidents or troubling 
death scenes. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as part of her duties, Bridges is coordinating with agencies throughout 
Ventura County to set up a program that would be open to more than 1,700 rescue 
workers. The teams would be on hand to counsel workers immediately after 
disturbing events so they are not debilitated by them. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal for a Critical Incident Stress Debriefing Program, which would 
make teams of psychologists and peer-counselors available to treat emergency 
workers 24 hours a day, is scheduled to come before the county Board of 
Supervisors in the next two months, Bridges said. 
</P>
<P>
Some counseling is available to various agencies in the county, but Bridges and 
others believe that a critical trauma debriefing team could make help more 
widely available. 
</P>
<P>
Such teams are commonplace in the wake of nearly every major disaster, arriving 
on the scenes of earthquakes and hurricanes to counsel emergency services 
workers. And they are becoming increasingly prevalent in local fire and police 
departments, with more than 125 communities in the United States running their 
own teams, according to the Critical Incident Stress Debriefing Foundation in 
Ellicot City, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Critical Incident Stress Debriefing is a relatively new psychological specialty 
designed to treat workers who have been exposed to incidents deemed unusually 
traumatic -- such as deaths of children, major disasters such as air crashes, 
accidents in which more than three people are killed, prolonged rescue 
situations and deaths or suicides of co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the majority of emergency services workers need some kind of help 
like this," said Jeffrey Mitchell, co-founder of the Critical Incident 
Debriefing Foundation and associate professor of emergency health services at 
the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. "Most have experienced at least 
some of the stress symptoms at some point in their careers." 
</P>
<P>
If not treated immediately, the short-term problems could fester and develop 
into long-term behavior disorders, Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
The police officers, firefighters and paramedics who witness such events might 
seek solace in alcohol or drugs. Some will avoid their friends and families. 
Their health might suffer as they develop problems sleeping, eating and 
relaxing, Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell coaches psychologists across the country on how to counsel the workers 
who often are mired in the belief that they do not need help because they are 
the helpers. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Mitchell said, the machismo associated with law enforcement and rescue 
professions frequently precludes admitting emotional problems. 
</P>
<P>
But the problems -- and need for help -- are definitely present, according to 
county emergency service workers. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters say they are haunted by the taste and smell of some accident 
scenes three weeks later. Police officers remember how their guts wrenched the 
first time they saw a dead body. And paramedics recount stories of 
conversations with people who keeled over dead in mid-sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I start recounting all the fatalities I've been on," said one county 
firefighter, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
The man said he is still disturbed by a Casitas Springs fire that killed an 
elderly woman in a mobile home in April, charring her body beyond recognition. 
</P>
<P>
"It's depressing to see human life destroyed like that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Fire Department has two chaplains on call who respond to 
fires and provide some counseling for firefighters and witnesses. But some 
firefighters believe that the chaplains do not have the expertise to deal with 
their psychological needs. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Kraetsch, president of the Ventura County Professional Firefighters, a 
labor organization that represents the county's 375 firefighters, said that 
additional psychological services are imperative. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the county has a moral obligation to provide them to us," Kraetsch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Arvid Wells of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department said the program 
would be well received by the 143 volunteers he commands on the sheriff's 
search-and-rescue team. 
</P>
<P>
The volunteers are shocked when they first retrieve a decaying body. They must 
be made to realize, he said, that it is normal to feel upset -- and even 
physically ill -- when first seeing a dead body. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally people are realizing the fact that rescue workers see more death and 
destruction than other people," Wells said. "The days of the macho, 'I can view 
anything and do any job,' are over." 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the Ventura program was sparked when 17 Ventura County 
firefighters became distressed after they were overcome by fumes during a fire 
at a chemical manufacturing plant in Saticoy on April 10, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The men were taken to local hospitals for treatment after being exposed to the 
poisonous gases at Pacific Intermediates. 
</P>
<P>
But no psychological counseling was provided for the men, who were worried 
about what future effects the exposure would have on them, Bridges said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a feeling of general panic that they didn't feel they were getting 
the support that they needed," Bridges said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Ventura program would provide support for county emergency 
services workers facing such incidents. The county also may try to contract 
with private ambulance and police departments countywide, Bridges said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura program would be made up of three- or four-member teams of mental 
health professionals and peer counselors. Depending on the circumstances of a 
case, the team would head out to talk to the workers at scenes of incidents or 
arrange for a more formal therapy session up to a week later, Bridges said. 
</P>
<P>
Start-up costs for the program, which Bridges hopes to see in effect by 
November, would be about $15,000. That money would pay for the training and 
salary of a part-time program coordinator, computer and telephone costs and 
materials for team uniforms or identification, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges said she hopes to negotiate with private hospitals to put up another 
$5,000 to train the psychologists and peer counselors. 
</P>
<P>
Already, 20 psychologists have applied to volunteer their time to the program. 
Also, Bridges said, she hopes clergy will go through the training and help in 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
Other agencies involved in developing the program include the county Sheriff's 
Department, Fire Department, Emergency Services department, coroner's office, 
Mental Health Services department and St. John's Regional Medical Center in 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Fire Department now relies on two chaplains to provide 
counseling at fire scenes. The Ventura County Sheriff's Department has its own 
psychologist with an office at department headquarters in Ventura. The 
psychologist is on call 24 hours a day. And county employees can see 
psychologists through the county's Employee Assistance Program. 
</P>
<P>
The five police departments in the county each contract with psychologists for 
emergency services as well. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges, however, said the Critical Incident Debriefing team would give workers 
an option about whom to see. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the five county supervisors contacted said they support the idea, but 
Supervisor Madge Schaefer said she believes that such a program was needed only 
for the county Fire Department. She said other county agencies already are 
adequately served. 
</P>
<P>
Similar programs in Los Angeles and Orange counties have helped workers through 
trying times. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Fire Department, with 2,300 firefighters, was the first 
California agency to implement its own Crisis Incident Stress Debriefing 
Program, program coordinator Marguarite Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
The team was started in an effort to cut down on people retiring because of 
stress-related ailments, Jordan said. It is now mandatory for firefighters 
exposed to any incident deemed traumatic to undergo counseling with team 
psychologists, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
The team first swung into action during the 1986 Cerritos air disaster, when 
firefighters and emergency workers went to rescue victims and found only 
mangled bodies. 
</P>
<P>
The team provided on-site counseling. As a result, Jordan said, no one in the 
Fire Department took early retirements or filed stress claims citing the 
disaster, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, the program was kicked off in 1985 and is run by the Red 
Cross. Workers there term it "emotional first aid," Donna Gamble of the Red 
Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
"It eases us back into normal life," she said. "It gets us over our period of 
adjustment much quicker."

ARPINO WILL RETURN TO JOFFREY BALLET POSITION; 
</P>
<P>
DANCE: ARTISTIC DIRECTOR'S DECISION APPARENTLY ENDS POWER STRUGGLE OVER 
MANAGEMENT OF COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gerald Arpino, who resigned May 1 as artistic director of the Joffrey Ballet, 
the company he co-founded 34 years ago, has agreed to return to the post, 
apparently ending a power struggle over management of the organization, it was 
announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement, which came in a joint press release from the Joffrey's Los 
Angeles and New York offices, said a special committee of the Joffrey's 
managing board of directors and Arpino have an agreement "in principle, which 
resolves all outstanding issues." 
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that Arpino will "continue" as artistic director. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement with the 62-year-old director will be presented to the full board 
in both cities today. Arpino is in Los Angeles for the completion of the 
Joffrey's current season at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on Sunday, but was 
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Arpino also will license his ballets and those of the late 
Robert Joffrey to the company. Joffrey and Arpino were the company's 
co-founders. Shortly after his resignation, Arpino's lawyer prohibited the 
company from performing Arpino's and Joffrey's works, claiming the ballets are 
Arpino's property. The agreement appears to indicate the company will not 
challenge Arpino's legal claim to the works. 
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted that the special committee and I have been able to work out 
these issues successfully," Arpino said in the statement. "The Joffrey Ballet 
has been my life for 35 years, and I look forward with renewed enthusiasm and 
commitment to continuing with this wonderful company and the magnificent 
dancers, of whom I am so proud." 
</P>
<P>
He added that "during these last weeks" he has been "very encouraged by the 
faith and caring that were forthcoming from our home cities of New York and Los 
Angeles, and from our friends around the world." 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of Arpino's resignation and the temporary withdrawal of his works, 
several members of the dance company's board resigned, including co-chairmen 
David Murdock and Anthony Bliss and executive director Penelope Curry. Murdock, 
the Los Angeles multimillionaire who helped bring the Joffrey here in 1983, was 
a chief benefactor of the company. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Brian, a managing director of the Joffrey's board in Los Angeles, said: 
"We are very pleased with the outcome of these discussions and are looking 
forward to a renewed relationship with Gerald Arpino." 
</P>
<P>
The company continues to face considerable financial uncertainty. The Joffrey 
remains nearly $2 million in debt, including $800,000 in back payroll taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Joffrey's continued presence at the Music Center is uncertain. The 
Joffrey's current contract expires June 30 and must be renewed by the Music 
Center's board of governors. The company also performs a season at New York 
City Center. 
</P>
<P>
Esther Wachtell, president of the Music Center, said she has "no idea" what a 
Joffrey settlement with Arpino might mean. "The Music Center's position remains 
the same," she noted. "When the Joffrey Ballet board settles the issues with 
Gerald Arpino, then they will bring their plan forward to the Music Center 
board of governors and we will discuss it." 
</P>
<P>
She could not say when that will be. 
</P>
<P>
Wachtell revealed that besides the $1 million which the Music Center Unified 
Fund gave the Joffrey for the 1989-90 fiscal year, there was a loan for 
$650,000. Jim Black, the Music Center's executive vice president, said that the 
Music Center also raised another $350,000 for the ballet from private donors. 
</P>
<P>
The Music Center has budgeted more than $1 million to the Joffrey for 
appearances in the fiscal year that begins July 1. "We have put into the budget 
a specific amount of money," Wachtell said, but they're still waiting on the 
Joffrey's plans "before we make that commitment to them."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RALLY MARKS ANNIVERSARY OF END OF SIX-DAY 
WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City officials and supporters of Israel attended a rally in front of City Hall 
in downtown Los Angeles Wednesday to mark the 23rd anniversary of the end of 
The Six-Day War that united Israel's capital, Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley's office proclaimed May 23 "Jerusalem Day," corresponding to 
the Hebrew calendar date on which the war between Israel and Jordan for control 
of the city ended. 
</P>
<P>
Elementary school students from Temple Beth Am's Pressman Academy in West Los 
Angeles sang popular Israeli songs as several city officials listened. 
</P>
<P>
The rally was sponsored by the Jewish Federation Council of Los Angeles, which 
organizes a social service exchange program between Los Angeles and Jerusalem. 
Israeli Consulate General in Los Angeles Ran Ronen read from a letter prepared 
for the ceremony by the mayor of Jerusalem, Teddy Kolleck, urging better 
understanding and mutual respect between various ethnic groups.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 1 KILLED, 7 HURT AS CAR CROSSES CENTER 
DIVIDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One man was killed and seven other people injured early Wednesday when a 
speeding car crashed through the center divider on the Ventura Freeway in 
Glendale and collided with two oncoming cars, the California Highway Patrol 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The 12:25 a.m. accident, which caused four people to be ejected from one car, 
closed three eastbound lanes of the freeway east of the San Fernando Road exit 
for three hours. 
</P>
<P>
CHP Officer Dean Gustafson said the accident occurred when a speeding Honda 
Prelude carrying five people went out of control and "went right through" the 
center divider. 
</P>
<P>
The Honda continued west in the eastbound lanes and struck a Hyundai and a 
Jaguar. Four people in the Honda were ejected, including Sarkis Shirinyan, 19, 
of Hollywood, who was killed. CHP investigators have been unable to determine 
who was driving the car or why it went out of control.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EDUCATOR APOLOGIZES FOR DESCRIPTION OF 
ASIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The superintendent of the Las Virgenes Unified School District, whose reference 
to "slant-eyed" Chinese during a recent public appearance prompted an inquiry 
by the Japanese American Citizens League, apologized Tuesday night at a Board 
of Education meeting. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief prepared statement, Superintendent Albert D. Marley apologized for 
using the term during a March 21 presentation of slides, taken on a trip to 
China, in which he compared "slant-eyed" Chinese to the "round-eyed" Caucasians 
in his tour group. 
</P>
<P>
He also apologized for offending a Japanese-American attorney, Lyn K. Philipps, 
who attended his presentation before the Optimist Club of Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
Marley did not elaborate at the board meeting and refused to comment on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The superintendent's initial failure to apologize after Philipps wrote him of 
her concern prompted the San Fernando Valley chapter of the Japanese American 
Citizens League to pursue her complaint.

DWP CHIEF'S $2,800 CHARTER FLIGHT ATTACKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Controller Rick Tuttle said Wednesday that he is preparing to blast 
Department of Water and Power General Manager Norm Nichols for spending $2,800 
in city funds on a charter flight to Sacramento when less expensive commercial 
flights were available. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle, who has previously squared off with the DWP chief over expense account 
charges, has scheduled a press conference for this morning at which he said he 
will "criticize" Nichols' expenditure for the trip he made last month. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Tuttle has refused to pay for high-priced lunches and other 
expenditures by Nichols and other DWP officials, leaving them to pick up the 
tabs themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols could not be reached for comment. But in a statement, the DWP said, "On 
April 24, 1990, DWP General Manager Norm Nichols utilized charter air services 
to Sacramento in order to meet with the chairman of the California Energy 
Commission. . . . Due to the press of business in both Sacramento and Los 
Angeles on that day, it was necessary for (Nichols) to utilize charter air 
services to meet the department's business commitments." 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Tuttle's office, however, said routine flight arrangements could 
have been made at a much cheaper price. U.S. Air, for instance, charges from 
$156 to $456 round trip between Los Angeles and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear whether Nichols was joined by any other DWP officials on the 
flight. And it was not clear what type of aircraft was chartered. 
</P>
<P>
The city controller, one of only three officials elected citywide, has 
historically overseen an office concerned more with ledgers and balance sheets 
than with public sparring with other city officials. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent years, former City Controller Ira Reiner turned the obscure 
office into a high-visibility position by rejecting expense accounts and other 
excessive charges submitted for payment by the Harbor Department. Reiner and 
his successor, James K. Hahn, both used their position as city controller as a 
steppingstone to higher office. Reiner is now district attorney running for 
state attorney general. Hahn is city attorney.

MENTALLY ILL CHILDREN FIND HELP IN PETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
CAMARILLO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a classroom at Camarillo State Hospital, an 11-year-old boy with sad, dark 
eyes sat in a corner, quietly petting his friend Echo, a golden retriever. 
</P>
<P>
"Echo takes away my sad feelings," said the boy, who is confined to a ward for 
mentally ill children. "And I've learned that animals have more feelings than I 
thought." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers and psychologists at the hospital, which has about 1,200 
developmentally disabled and mentally ill patients, say they are using animals 
more and more in therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is no structured pet therapy program at Camarillo, the idea of 
allowing patients time to cuddle animals is quickly catching on. About half a 
dozen teachers and psychologists bring their pets to work every day, a practice 
encouraged by hospital officials. A few other employees have adopted cats that 
have wandered onto the spacious grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something they can cuddle and love," said Dee Press, a special education 
teacher who owns Echo. "A lot of the kids we have here have been abused 
mentally and physically. An animal is non-threatening." 
</P>
<P>
Employees stay close by when patients are with the animals. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very careful not to leave them alone. Some of the patients would kill 
the animals," said Jerry Scheurn, coordinator of volunteer services at the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
But no abuse has occurred, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Press, who teaches children 8 through 13, said she is delighted with how her 
students react to her dog. She has been bringing Echo since the 7-year-old 
retriever was a puppy, she said, and she is always impressed with her students' 
reactions. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had kids who don't talk very much," Press said. "But sometimes when the 
kids are sad they will ask to spend a little time with Echo." 
</P>
<P>
Once a young boy was visibly upset when he came to class, but he refused to 
discuss his troubles. When Press allowed the child to pet Echo, the boy started 
to hug the dog and cry. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Why don't you tell Echo what's wrong?' " Press said. The boy quietly 
explained that he was afraid his mother would forget to visit him at the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo hospital is not alone in using animals during psychiatric treatment. 
It is becoming a common practice in hospitals throughout the state, and 
Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena even has a team of trained therapy 
dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Westwood therapist Janet Ruckert describes "petcology" -- the value of using 
pets to help people overcome their anxieties -- in her book titled, "The 
Four-Footed Therapist." 
</P>
<P>
According to Ruckert, animals are natural therapists. By being warm and 
sympathetic listeners, they allow a patient to express deep emotions and needs. 
</P>
<P>
The Camarillo hospital has a petting zoo with a goat and rabbits, but the 
children visit them sporadically. Therapists say patients relate better to cats 
and dogs because they usually are more affectionate. 
</P>
<P>
Connie Westphal, a special education teacher at the hospital, said her students 
get upset if she doesn't bring her dog Frankie, a dachshund, to class. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to know where he is," Westphal said. "They seemed to have bonded 
with him." 
</P>
<P>
A white and gray cat, often found under a tree outside the children's ward, 
constantly receives attention. 
</P>
<P>
"She does stuff that's neat," said a blond 11-year-old boy, scratching the cat 
behind the ears. "She rolls around in the grass and she catches mice. But the 
kids like her because she respects us. That's important."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VENDOR ARRESTED IN SALE OF BOOTLEG TAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Carson man was arrested Wednesday at the Lancaster Flea Market for allegedly 
selling pirated musical recordings and about 5,000 tape cassettes were 
confiscated, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Cletus Anderson, 49, was arrested after detectives made a routine walk through 
the flea market at 155 E. Avenue I, Detective Bill Higgins said. 
</P>
<P>
Higgins said that while posing as a customer and examining the tapes, he 
noticed that although they appeared to be professionally packaged, the covers 
contained no recording company names or photos of the artists. The tapes, 
featuring singers such as Prince, Luther Vandross and Quincy Jones, were being 
sold three for $10, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Higgins returned to his office and called an investigator for the Recording 
Industry Assn. of America, who listened to a description of the tapes and said

Higgins said Anderson was arrested on suspicion of selling tapes that do not

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHURCH TO GIVE $500,000 TO NEHEMIAH WEST 
PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rev. Frederick H. Borsch, bishop of the Los Angeles diocese of the 
Episcopal Church, on Tuesday announced a pledge of more than $500,000 in loans 
by the church to help construct Nehemiah West, a townhouse-style development of 
316 low-priced homes in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Borsch said the five-year, no-interest loan is one of several he expects to be 
made by Los Angeles-area churches to the project's nonprofit developers. 
</P>
<P>
The developers hope that Nehemiah West will help turn around one of the city's 
most rundown neighborhoods. The church also will give the project developers 
$2,000 a month in support funds. 
</P>
<P>
"One would like to believe the church has always been involved," in affordable 
housing, Borsch said. "What is needed oftentimes is seed money and the people 
to get these projects off the ground."

AFTER 22-POINT RALLY, IT'S 2-0 IN PORTER-LAND; 
</P>
<P>
NBA PLAYOFFS: TRAIL BLAZERS CHARGE TO 108-107 VICTORY AS GUARD SCORES 23 OF HIS 
28 IN SECOND HALF.

<P>
Always the optimist, Portland Trail Blazer guard Terry Porter said he knew his 
game-winning shot was going in, just as he was certain his team would come back 
from an 18-point halftime deficit to beat the Phoenix Suns in Game 2 of the 
Western Conference finals. Easy for him to say now, after the Trail Blazers 
pulled off one of the NBA's most astonishing feats with a 108-107 victory 
before 12,884 at the Coliseum to take a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I always know it's going in," Porter said of his 14-foot jump shot 
with 12 seconds left. "I just wanted to get a clean shot." 
</P>
<P>
2 After a miserable first half, in which the Trail Blazers trailed by as many 
as 22 points, it looked as if they had no shot of maintaining home-court 
advantage. They quickly fell behind the Suns and even got so out of it that 
they were assessed a technical foul for having only four players on the court. 
What's more, a team photographer was was ejected from the game for arguing with 
referee Jess Kersey. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only that," guard Clyde Drexler cracked, "but our locker room was locked 
when we got back there." 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers might have been disorganized at that point but not, as it 
turned out, distraught. 
</P>
<P>
"All we wanted to do was play better in the second half," Porter said. "I 
figured if we could steadily get that lead down, we'd have a chance. When we 
cut it to nine points going into the (fourth quarter), I knew we had a good 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
Porter made it possible. He scored 23 of his 28 points in the second half. He 
made four of the Trail Blazers' five three-point shots, including two in the 
last 5:38. Porter's three-pointer with 28 seconds left tied it, 106-106, and he 
swished a jumper off a fractured pick-and-roll play with 12 seconds left for 
the game winner. 
</P>
<P>
"We could have folded our tent, but we didn't," Portland Coach Rick Adelman 
said. "That's the way it's been all season for us. Terry Porter has been our 
game winner all along, and he did it again tonight. I just can't think of 
another win as satisfying as this." 
</P>
<P>
It was not the biggest second-half comeback in NBA playoff history, but it was 
close. In 1948, Baltimore recovered from a 21-point halftime deficit to beat 
Philadelphia by three points. Four other times in playoff history teams have 
rebounded from 18-point halftime deficits. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on one's perspective, this was either one of the greatest comebacks 
in Trail Blazer history or one of the most ignominious fold jobs the Suns have 
ever experience. Maybe it was both. 
</P>
<P>
But don't mention tortillas and folding around the Suns. They gave credit to 
Portland for taking the lead. They say they did not give it away. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had everything happen to me in the NBA," Sun Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons 
said. "It's not going to break my heart and it's not the end of the world. I'm 
sure we'll come back and play extremely hard. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't stop them. That's the story. It was a great comeback, and they 
earned it. But this is a long series." 
</P>
<P>
The Suns, after taking a 59-41 halftime lead, looked as though they didn't know 
what hit them. 
</P>
<P>
With 35 seconds left in the half, Portland was assessed a technical foul by 
Kersey. It seemed center Kevin Duckworth left the court during a stoppage of 
play. No Trail Blazer replaced him. So the Trail Blazers were called for having 
only four players on the court. To that point, even five Portland players could 
not stop the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the second half, the newly resolute Trail Blazers scored 41 points in 
the third quarter to cut the Suns' lead to 91-82. From that point, the Trail 
Blazers clearly were in control, while the Suns were simply trying to keep from 
losing. 
</P>
<P>
It took nearly all game, but the Trail Blazers finally caught the Suns when 
Porter sank his three-point shot with 28 seconds to play. The Suns called two 
timeouts to set up their next possession, and it appeared the Trail Blazers 
made a mistake by fouling Kevin Johnson on the inbounds play. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson, shooting 82% from the free throw line in the playoffs, made only 
one of two shots, giving the Suns a 107-106 lead. More important, it gave the 
Trail Blazers the ball with 27 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers, wisely, put the ball in Porter's hands. He feigned a drive 
on the right wing, then headed toward the free-throw line. Freeing himself from 
Kevin Johnson's shadow, Porter pulled up for a jump shot from about 14 feet. He 
swished the shot for a 108-107 lead with 12 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix called its last timeout, then put the ball in Kevin Johnson's hands. 
Johnson brought it up, then passed to Eddie Johnson in the corner. Johnson, 
heavily guarded, attempted a high-arching jumper with two seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
He missed, and the Trial Blazers had completed the stunning comeback. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the greatest thing that's happened in my career," said Trail Blazer 
forward Jerome Kersey, who had 16 of his 29 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Porter did not say it, but it undoubtedly was his best effort in such an 
important game. 
</P>
<P>
Drexler scored 16 of his 20 points in the second half and added nine rebounds, 
six assists and six steals. 
</P>
<P>
"At halftime, we felt we were still in it," said Duckworth, who had 11 points 
and seven rebounds. "We just needed to make some shots and play good defense. 
That's the story."

<P>
DODGERS: LOS ANGELES COMES BACK FROM 3-0 DEFICIT IN THE EIGHTH INNING WHEN HE 
HITS A THREE-RUN HOME RUN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dodgers, hoping to become Road Scholars sometime soon, returned to class 
Wednesday afternoon in the little old schoolhouse at Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
They had earned a master's in misery on their last trip, returning to Dodger 
Stadium with a 1-7 report card that could have been worse if a game in New York 
had not been rained out. 
</P>
<P>
So they decided that a new attitude was needed: Learn to think only positively, 
Psychology 101. 
</P>
<P>
Given a chance to put that lesson to a test immediately, the Dodgers overcame a 
three-run deficit against a pitcher seemingly in control and rallied to beat 
the Chicago Cubs, 4-3, in the opener of an eight-game trip. Kal Daniels' 
three-run home run provided a victory for pitcher Tim Belcher. 
</P>
<P>
Said Mickey Hatcher: "I know that on the last trip, we had the feeling that 
something bad was going to happen every time we went on the field. We have to 
take the negative and turn it into positive." 
</P>
<P>
Is a 3-0 deficit in the eighth inning negative enough? That's where the Dodgers 
stood against Mike Harkey, the former Cal State Fullerton star who in one 
stretch retired 12 consecutive batters, only three of whom managed to get the 
ball out of the infield. 
</P>
<P>
Harkey had given up a single to Chris Gwynn in the first inning, a single to 
Mike Scioscia in the second, a walk, and a double by Lenny Harris -- that being 
the only time a Dodger advanced as far as second base. When the eighth came, 
Harkey wasn't exactly getting bombed. Dissected is more like it. 
</P>
<P>
After Alfredo Griffin opened the inning with a groundout, Hatcher, 
pinch-hitting for Belcher, singled. Harris followed with an infield hit, 
actually a squibber down the line that third baseman Luis Salazar held, 
thinking the ball was foul and not realizing his mistake until Harris had 
reached first base. Stan Javier added a sinking line drive to left field that 
Doug Dascenzo trapped for a single, Hatcher scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Harkey got Eddie Murray to hit back to the box, but Harkey was done. Cub 
Manager Don Zimmer brought in Paul Assenmacher, who was sent out almost as 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Assenmacher's first assignment was Daniels, whose three-run blast to 
left-center was his fourth homer in nine games. 
</P>
<P>
Next up was Scioscia, who singled to right field. Zimmer replaced Assenmacher 
with Bill Long, who gave up another hit to Mike Sharperson, then ended the 
Dodger rally by striking out Juan Samuel. 
</P>
<P>
Belcher helped the Dodgers get that far with a solid outing of his own. He 
served up a first-inning solo home run to Dave Clark, but had only one bad 
inning, the sixth, before being lifted for the pinch-hitter after seven 
innings. Still, Domingo Ramos' two-run single had been enough to send out 
Belcher, trailing, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
There was a positive aspect to this, though. Normally a power pitcher who uses 
90% to 95% fastballs, Belcher has been teaching himself the art of finesse 
pitching. It's not by choice: The good hard stuff has abandoned him since his 
May 1 outing against Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Until it comes back -- he doesn't consider it an if proposition -- Belcher has 
learned to depend more on his curve or slider or split-finger change. The last 
two starts, both victories, it has been 75% to 80% fastballs. 
</P>
<P>
"For a power pitcher, who goes out there relying on his fastball, to not have 
it is like going out there naked," said Belcher, who blames the shortened 
spring training and throwing too many innings too soon into the season. 
</P>
<P>
"But the fact is, I'm still keeping my team in games and getting some wins 
without the real good fastball. So that's still encouraging." 
</P>
<P>
With the victory, he improved to 4-3. The six-hit inning that gave the Dodgers 
the lead came before his reliever, Pat Perry, became the pitcher of record. 
</P>
<P>
"You get the hook, and get a win with one swing," Belcher said, referring to 
Daniels' home run. "I think that's the first time I've ever gotten a win in the 
clubhouse in the major leagues." 
</P>
<P>
Perry, just off the disabled list after shoulder surgery, was joined by Jay 
Howell and Mike Hartley in protecting the 4-3 lead into the ninth, although 
Hartley left after surrendering a walk to Salazar and a single to Ramos. From 
there, Don Aase got the final three outs and his third save when Marvell Wynne 
ended the game by grounding out to Sharperson at first base. 
</P>
<P>
And school was out. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
For the first time this season, Hubie Brooks did not start, after the Dodgers 
announced that he was bothered by shin splints in his right leg. Chris Gwynn 
opened in right field. First baseman Eddie Murray, who injured his left 
hamstring in New York during the last trip and apparently aggravated it during 
Tuesday's loss to the Mets at Dodger Stadium, appeared as a pinch-hitter in the 
eighth inning. In Murray's absence, Mike Sharperson got his first career start 
at first base. . . . Pitcher John Wetteland, who has the flu, stayed at the 
team's hotel. He had missed his scheduled start Tuesday because of the illness 
but pitched an inning of relief. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago's Domingo Ramos, who came in batting .195, went four for four with two 
runs batted in. "Was that Domingo Ramos?" Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda asked 
later. "I thought that was Lou Boudreau." . . . Mike Harkey tied a National 
League record by becoming the third pitcher to record three putouts in an 
inning. The two others, Rick Reuschel in 1985 and Ed Lynch in '86, also did it 
while with the Cubs. Harkey's turn came in the fourth inning, all on grounders 
to first base, with Mark Grace getting the assists. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda, on Tim Belcher's quest to regain his fastball: "He threw some balls 
good today that shows he's coming back -- not with a great deal of consistency 
-- but he showed some of the fastball like last year. It'll be back." . . . 
Fernando Valenzuela (3-3) will pitch for the Dodgers today against Les 
Lancaster (3-1) in the closer of the two-game set.

ANGELS: NINTH-INNING COMEBACK IS CULMINATED BY HIS TWO-OUT SINGLE, SCORING RAY 
FOR 5-4 VICTORY OVER TORONTO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Before Wednesday, the Angels had trailed after the seventh inning 23 times this 
season. And 23 times they had lost. 
</P>
<P>
This time, they were down, 4-1, in the ninth inning at Anaheim Stadium, but 
they came up with four runs, capped by Lance Parrish's single to left that 
drove in Johnny Ray for a 5-4 Angel victory. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto Blue Jay starter Dave Stieb had pitched 4 2/3 innings of no-hit ball 
and given up only three hits over seven innings, but it went for naught after 
the ninth, when the Angel offense, near silent to that point, went to work. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Polonia led off to with a single to center, only the Angels' fourth hit of 
the game. Max Venable struck out, but Devon White walked, putting runners on 
first and second for Wally Joyner, who in the seventh inning had hit a solo 
home run to cut the deficit to 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner, who has hit in 16 of his last 17 games, sent reliever Duane Ward's 
first pitch to him into left field for a double, driving in Polonia and White 
and cutting the lead to 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
After Chili Davis lined out to left, that brought up Ray, who had broken up 
Stieb's no-hitter in the fifth. Ray's double down the first-base line drove in 
Joyner, tying the score. 
</P>
<P>
Donnie Hill walked, and the Blue Jays brought on Jim Acker, who gave up the hit 
to Parrish, who entered the game as a pinch-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Bailes (1-0) was the winning pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Stieb's work week was a far cry from Jim Abbott's. 
</P>
<P>
Stieb pitched against the Angels last Friday, and lasted 3 1/3 innings. Abbott 
pitched in that game, too, went 6 2/3 innings and got the victory. 
</P>
<P>
But Abbott was making an emergency start that day, and had pitched two days 
earlier. Abbott was making his third start in eight days. Stieb had hardly 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
Stieb did not allow a hit until there were two outs in the fifth, when Ray 
lined a full-count pitch to left field. 
</P>
<P>
Stieb still had the shutout until the seventh inning. But with one out, Joyner 
drove a ball to right-center, sending Mookie Wilson leaping above the fence at 
the 386-foot mark, but to no avail. The homer was Joyner's second in as many 
games, and gave him six in 41 games this season -- a mark he didn't reach until 
July 30 of last season, in his 101st game. Joyner has hit in 16 of his past 17 
games, and raised his batting average from .222 on May 5 to .301. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott, pressed into service last Friday after scheduled starter Chuck Finley 
sprained an ankle on his way to a restaurant, said that outing helped him 
recover from a poor one two days earlier in which he lasted only 1 1/3 innings, 
allowing eight runs, seven of them earned. 
</P>
<P>
But with the solace of his performance Friday, he had a good outing to tide him 
over until his next start. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays got to Abbott for a run in the first inning on double by Kelly 
Gruber and a single by George Bell. 
</P>
<P>
After giving up the run in the first inning, Abbott cruised through the next 
three, giving up only two singles, to Manny Lee and Pat Borders. 
</P>
<P>
He opened the fifth by giving up singles to Lee and Junior Felix. Tony 
Fernandez bunted to the right side of the infield, but first baseman Wally 
Joyner, playing in, fielded it and threw sharply to third to get Lee. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott got Mookie Wilson to knock the ball back to the mound, and he fielded it 
cleanly. But Abbott hesitated, looking to third. By the time he threw to first, 
Wilson was safe, loading the bases for Kelly Gruber, who is batting .311 with 
12 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
That didn't seem to bode well for Abbott. Two of Gruber's homer had come in his 
past 14 at-bats. On the other hand, none had come on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Gruber delivered only a single to left, but it was plenty to drive in Felix and 
Fernandez and send Wilson to third. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays made the lead 4-0 when Wilson scored run on George Bell's ground 
out, which required a diving stop by third baseman Donnie Hill to get the 
second out. Fred McGriff flied out to left to end the inning, but the damage 
was done -- three runs on four hits. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Third baseman Jack Howell was placed on the 15-day disabled list retroactive to 
Tuesday, becoming the seventh player the Angels have on the list, including 
four infielders. Howell, who sprained his left knee Monday on a defensive play 
at third, underwent a Magnetic Resonance Imaging test that showed no cartilage 
damage, and trainer Ned Bergert said the team is "very optimistic" he will be 
able to play in 15 days. Donnie Hill started at third. Until the Angels make a 
roster move -- probably by recalling infielder Rick Schu from Edmonton -- the 
backup third baseman is left-handed first baseman Wally Joyner, Manager Doug 
Rader said. Joyner has taken grounders at third, as have others, including 
outfielders Dante Bichette and Chili Davis. Rader said Joyner "was fine." Asked 
if any of the outfielders could play third, he said, "As soon as they start 
taking up residence on Fantasy Island." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Winfield returned to Anaheim Stadium for the first time as an Angel, but 
did not start. Winfield pinch-hit in his first game with the team last 
Thursday, and had started each of the past five, during which time the Angels 
were 4-1. "Winnie is on the bench because what he's trying to do right now is 
play himself into shape, and that's very difficult to do during the season," 
Rader said. "He's really been busting it since he's been here. He hadn't been 
playing full time with the Yankees. This is different. He needed to get away 
for a day. He'll be in there tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Infielder Kent Anderson (sprained right shoulder) was transferred from the 
15-day disabled list to the 21-day list. Catcher Bill Schroeder (post-surgical 
elbow rehabilitation) was transferred from the 21-day list to the 30-day list, 
and Rader said he probably will be given a rehabilitation assignment soon.

MORNING BRIEFING: THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE AIR WHEN KNICKS PLAYED AT GARDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARLEY TINKHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Harlem Globetrotters do tricks with the ball by underinflating it, but you 
can't do that in the NBA. Or can you? 
</P>
<P>
Chicago Bull Coach Phil Jackson, who played on those great New York Knick teams 
with Willis Reed, Walt Frazier, et al, told the Chicago Tribune: "We used to 
deflate the ball because we were a short team and didn't want long rebounds. It 
also helped our offense because we liked to pass the ball, and other teams 
couldn't run on us as well because the ball wouldn't come up as fast when they 
dribbled." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said the Miami Heat tried the same thing this season to slow down his 
fast-breaking Bulls. "The balls were so soft, you could stick your thumb in 
them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Heat didn't get away with it. 
</P>
<P>
"I always carry an air-pressure gauge with me," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
Add tricks: Bull assistant coach John Bach said the Lakers overinflate their 
balls because Magic Johnson likes a high dribble. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Phil checked them and found the basketballs at something like 15 or 17 
pounds," Bach said. 
</P>
<P>
Regulation is 7 1/2 to 8 1/2 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
More tricks: The Boston Celtics, once a fast-breaking team, used to have their 
nets shortened so the ball would drop through quickly, giving them a faster 
start on the break. 
</P>
<P>
"They still don't have standard cords around the league, and they should have," 
Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What do coaches Jackson and Bill Fitch of the New Jersey Nets have 
in common? 
</P>
<P>
High praise: Everybody knows shortstop Barry Larkin of the Cincinnati Reds can 
hit, but how well does he play defense? 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia coach Larry Bowa, a former all-star shortstop, told the 
Philadelphia Inquirer: "I'll tell you what, Larkin could win a Gold Glove. 
Ozzie Smith gets a lot of it on reputation now. Ozzie gets all the attention. 
But if you're looking at the whole picture, Larkin's a better player. There's 
nothing, really, that he can't do." 
</P>
<P>
He can even do Ozzie's favorite stunt, the running front flip. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been doing it since I was a kid," Larkin said. 
</P>
<P>
Ring hazard: Rocky Graziano, who died Tuesday, liked to tell about the time he 
put Sugar Ray Robinson on the deck. "He tripped over me while I was lying on 
the canvas," Graziano said. 
</P>
<P>
How-times-have-changed-Dept.: From Minnie Minoso, 67, former Chicago White Sox 
outfielder: "I get $1,000 for every old-timers' game. By playing seven times a 
year, I make as much playing baseball now as I did in 1951 as a rookie." 
</P>
<P>
Fashion note: From Jan Hubbard of Newsday: "The Denver Nuggets have a new dress 
policy that requires ties and shirts. Since it was inaugurated, Doug Moe has 
not been to the office." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Fitch was Jackson's coach at the University of North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Pat Bradley, on the doggedness of LPGA golfer Dottie Mochrie: "A lot 
of players talk to their golf ball. Some even yell at it. But Dottie actually 
thinks it's supposed to listen to her." HARLEY TINKHAM

<P>
Tim Wallach and Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd are two players the San Diego Padres are 
glad they won't be seeing again until August. 
</P>
<P>
The hot-hitting Wallach hit his 10th home run and Boyd pitched a five-hitter 
Wednesday night at Montreal to lead the Expos to a 4-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
In his last three games against the Padres, Wallach, who has regained his home 
run stroke after a two-year drought, is nine for 14. He has hit four home runs, 
three of them three-run homers, and has driven in 13 runs. 
</P>
<P>
Wallach, after hitting 26 home runs in 1987, hit only 25 total in 1988 and 
1989. He has hit eight in the last 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd (3-2) shut out the Padres for the second time in a row. He has given up 
only two earned runs in 29 innings. He struck out eight batters and didn't walk 
any. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 7, Pittsburgh 3 -- Alex Trevino hit a two-run home run to break a 3-3 
tie at Houston and cut the Pirates' lead in the East to one game over 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
It was Trevino's first home run of the season. The Astros scored two more runs 
in the inning to hand the Pirates their seventh loss in the last 11 games. The 
Astros stole eight bases. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 6, St. Louis 1 -- The Giants, 5-16 at home, showed how happy they 
were to escape Candlestick Park by routing the Cardinals in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Knepper, who had a 6.05 earned-run average, held the Cardinals to seven 
hits in 6 2/3 innings. He also doubled in a run. Will Clark hit his eighth 
homer. DAN HAFNER

<P>
Charlie (King Kong) Keller, who played 13 years in the major leagues, mainly 
with the New York Yankees, and later became a successful horse breeder, died 
Wednesday. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
Keller died of cancer at his Yankee Land Farm, said Don Thompson, funeral 
director. 
</P>
<P>
Keller, a left-handed hitting outfielder, hit .334 in 1939, his rookie season 
with the Yankees. He played 10 years with the Yankees before being released 
after the 1949 season. 
</P>
<P>
Keller went to Detroit for two seasons, returned briefly to the Yankees in 1952 
and retired with a .286 average and 189 homers in 1,170 games. 
</P>
<P>
Keller also hit .306 in four World Series with the Yankees and was a member of 
New York's world championship teams in 1939, 1941 and 1943. 
</P>
<P>
After Keller retired from baseball, he became a successful breeder of trotters 
at his farm in western Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
His brother, Hal, a catcher, also played parts of three seasons in the major 
leagues with the Washington Senators. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

YANKEES HIT 6 HOMERS AS LEARY STOPS TWINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tim Leary has been the New York Yankees' most effective pitcher this season. 
But usually, the Yankee batters give him almost no support. 
</P>
<P>
In a throwback to the days of the Bronx Bombers, the Yankees hit six home runs 
and gave the hard-working right-hander enough runs for three victories 
Wednesday night at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
"I really enjoyed watching those balls sailing over the fence and knowing they 
were making it easier for me," Leary said. 
</P>
<P>
In a game marred by a bench-clearing incident, Leary gave up just four hits and 
struck out 11 in pitching the Yankees to a 12-0 victory over the Minnesota 
Twins. 
</P>
<P>
Leary's record is only 3-4, but this was the seventh time Leary held the 
opposition to three runs or fewer. It was his first shutout since 1988 with the 
Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Although the near-brawl came in the fourth inning when Tim Drummond (0-1) 
almost hit Mel Hall in the head with a pitch, it started in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
After hitting a tremendous home run into the upper deck, some 440 feet away, 
Hall took about a minute to trot around the bases. Drummond didn't forget. The 
dugouts emptied, but it was a battle of words only. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees hit only 22 home runs in their first 36 games. But Steve Balboni 
hit two home runs, Deion Sanders hit a three-run shot and Roberto Kelly and 
Jesse Barfield also hit homers in support of Leary. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 5, Texas 1 -- Cecil Fielder hit his major league-leading 17th home run, 
a two-run shot in the third inning at Detroit, and the Tigers won for the 
eighth time in nine games. 
</P>
<P>
Brian DuBois (2-2), struck out seven and gave up seven hits in 6 2/3 innings to 
get the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Jeffcoat (0-1), starting in place of injured Nolan Ryan, hit Lloyd Moseby 
with two out in the third and Fielder followed with his homer to center field. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 12, Milwaukee 5 -- Dave Henderson hit two home runs and Rickey 
Henderson added a three-run shot as the Athletics trounced the Brewers at 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
The A's chased Bill Wegman (2-1), who shut them out last week in Milwaukee, 
with eight runs in the first 2 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Moore (4-3) pitched seven innings to get the victory for Oakland, which 
has snapped a slump with four victories in five games. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 4, Boston 1 -- Bret Saberhagen is back in his best form. He 
followed up Friday's two-hitter against New York with this seven-hitter at 
Boston. He struck out five and didn't walk a batter, improving his record to 
3-3. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Jeltz, an .067 hitter, broke a 1-1 tie with a run-scoring single in the 
seventh and Willie Wilson singled in two more runs. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 6, Baltimore 3 -- Dan Pasqua, in the starting lineup for only the 13th 
time this season, showed his appreciation with a three-run home run in the 
first inning at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Pasqua also hit a solo home run in the seventh to help Eric King win his third 
without defeat. King gave up only two hits in six innings, but one was a 
three-run home run by Joe Orsulak, his third in two games. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 4, Cleveland 1 -- Ken Griffey Jr. doubled home two runs in a three-run 
first inning and Alvin Davis homered as the Mariners downed the Indians at 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Erik Hanson (4-3) held Cleveland to five hits in eight innings while walking 
none and striking out nine. Mike Schooler pitched the ninth for his 12th save.

PLAYER PUNCHES MACLEAN; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: UCLA FORWARD SUFFERS BROKEN CHEEKBONE IN FIGHT WITH COLORADO'S 
VANDIVER AT GOODWILL GAMES TRYOUTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA forward Don MacLean's tryout for the U.S. basketball team at the Goodwill 
Games ended with a punch by Colorado center Shaun Vandiver that broke MacLean's 
cheekbone in three places. 
</P>
<P>
The injury forced MacLean to return home early. Vandiver was dismissed from the 
tryouts at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo., by the USA 
Basketball executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
The fight occurred Sunday night after a scrimmage. According to a coach who 
asked that his name not be used, the 6-foot-10, 224-pound MacLean and the 6-9, 
240-pound Vandiver were bumping each other around when MacLean caught Vandiver 
with an elbow in the face. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it was a malicious thing," the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a physical game, and we were going at each other pretty good," MacLean 
said Wednesday from Los Angeles. "I did hit him with an elbow. I guess he 
thought it was intentional, and he carried it on after the game." 
</P>
<P>
A timeout was called at that point, and there were no further hostilities in 
the scrimmage. The players showered and dressed, but then Vandiver confronted 
MacLean and punched him in the face, knocking him down. 
</P>
<P>
MacLean was taken to the trainer's room, where Vandiver reportedly tried to go 
in after him. 
</P>
<P>
"The game wasn't anything out of the ordinary," said MacLean, who is expected 
to be out two to three weeks. "Usually, if someone gets hit with an elbow or 
something, they'll try to get back at you, but 90% of the time, that kind of 
thing stays on the court." 
</P>
<P>
MacLean was subsequently examined by a doctor who refused to clear him for the 
final day of tryouts. 
</P>
<P>
At UCLA, MacLean has had a history of talking to opponents, which has made him 
one of the Pacific 10's most controversial players. Although the coach said he 
didn't see any untoward behavior on MacLean's part in the camp, it seems 
doubtful that he will make the team for the Goodwill Games July 20-Aug. 5 in 
Seattle.

An NCAA committee has proposed a revenue-sharing plan for distributing some of 
the $1 billion CBS will pay over the next seven years for rights to the 
basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Two sets of criteria would be used under the formula. The first would be the 
number of sports sponsored by an institution, the number of times it has 
participated in an NCAA championship the past three years and the number of 
scholarships it awarded. 
</P>
<P>
The second guideline was the number of times the school had been in the 
basketball tournament the past six years.

A baseball card expert in Pittsfield, Me., raised doubts about the authenticity 
of a Honus Wagner baseball card that turned up there, saying it looks too thin 
and too bright to be real. 
</P>
<P>
An authentic card in good condition featuring the Hall of Fame shortstop from 
the early 1900s could be worth $10,000 to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Arlo Quint, 12, said he had unearthed the Wagner card and three others while 
digging for worms in his back yard. The cards were in an old tooth powder can. 
</P>
<P>
The Wagner card surfaced about a month after a boy in Stockton Springs, about 
30 miles away, found a Honus Wagner card under similar circumstances.

11 BUICKS WILL HAVE A RACE OF THEIR OWN IN INDY 500 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
INDIANAPOLIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the 10 Chevrolet-powered cars battle among themselves up front Sunday in 
the 74th annual Indianapolis 500, there will be several "best in class" 
struggles going on farther back in the pack. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, there are more Buicks, 11, than any engine in the race. Equally 
surprising, not one of them is in a 1990 model chassis. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Lewis, campaigning a 1988 Penske-Buick for Frank Arciero, is the fastest 
Buick qualifier with a 218.412-m.p.h. run that put him in the fourth row. He is 
also the fastest qualifier in an older-model car, with any make engine. 
</P>
<P>
Arciero, an Orange County construction magnate and winery owner, has 
established a reputation for bringing young drivers to Indianapolis Motor 
Speedway to give them their first chance at the 500. Among them have been Al 
Unser in 1965, Pete Halsmer in 1982, Randy Lanier in 1986, Fabrizio Barbazza in 
1987 and Didier Theys last year. 
</P>
<P>
Lanier and Barbazza were each an Indy 500 rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
So it was a surprise when Arciero tabbed Lewis, 44, a veteran of three 500s and 
20 years in racing, and Rich Vogler, 39, to drive his cars this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We hadn't been having much luck here, and neither had Lewis, so I thought 
maybe if we got together, it might give us both a new lease on life," Arciero 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis responded with the fastest four laps of his career, but Vogler crashed 
twice and failed to make the race. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, the Buicks are fantastic," Lewis said as he watched team Manager Dennis 
McCormick direct the changing of an engine for today's final testing. "Anywhere 
else, its unfair to run with the rules the way they are. Here, we get 10 more 
inches (of manifold boost), and that is about 120 more horsepower. 
</P>
<P>
"The Buick engine is a little heavier than the Chevy, and the center of gravity 
is higher, which makes it more difficult to get the chassis working. The key to 
running Indy is to go flat-out through the short chutes. If you can't run fast 
through them, it doesn't matter how much horsepower you have." 
</P>
<P>
The Indy 500 is run under United States Auto Club rules, but the rest of the 
Indy car season is under Championship Auto Racing Teams rules. The only 
significant difference is in the amount of manifold boost permitted the Buick 
V6 stock-block engine against the V8s. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal is still to come here with a new car and a competitive engine," Lewis 
said, "but in the meantime, I think running a Buick for Frank Arciero is the 
best alternative. I still see flashes of the way I drove when I was racing 
Formula Threes in Europe 20 years ago and won races against drivers like (world 
Formula One champions) James Hunt and Alan Jones. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I used to have it. Now I want to show that I still have it." 
</P>
<P>
Other Buicks will be raced Sunday by Tony and Gary Bettenhausen, Kevin Cogan, 
Theys, Tom Sneva, Stan Fox, Jim Crawford, Billy Vukovich III, John Paul Jr. and 
Rocky Moran. 
</P>
<P>
Dominic Dobson, driving a 1990 Lola-Cosworth for Bruce Leven, a Seattle 
businessman, is the fastest of the Cosworth-powered drivers. He qualified at 
219.230 m.p.h., with one lap at 220.162. 
</P>
<P>
"I only did one lap at 220, but it does make you feel as though you've moved 
into a new league," Dobson said. "At that speed, the short chutes tend to 
disappear. You have two long straightaways connected by two long U-turns. It 
felt like I surpassed a barrier, like when I hit 210 in 1988. It would be 
interesting to go 225. I think the short chutes would even be shorter." 
</P>
<P>
Dobson is one of two drivers used by the British-based factory in developing 
the Cosworth DFS short-stroke Indy engine. Scott Brayton, of Dick Simon's team, 
is the other. 
</P>
<P>
"The DFS has more r.p.m.'s and more power at the higher end, but the Chevys 
come off the corners quicker," Dobson said. "Cosworth is working on a brand-new 
1991 engine with no derivative from the current models. They are working with a 
clean sheet of paper. That's what Chevy did a few years ago, and it worked. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to will the Cosworth in front of the Chevys on Sunday, but I must 
be realistic. We hope for attrition, to have a better race setup, to be able to 
concentrate on a good driveable car, one that's as good for the second half of 
the race as the first half. We also need good pit stops. 
</P>
<P>
"Can we win? That's theoretical. We must concentrate on doing the best job we 
can. We want the engine running perfectly. We want the chassis where it should 
be. We want to have good communication. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll take what we can get, as long as we do the best we can, we'll be 
satisfied. We wouldn't be happy finishing second and thinking we didn't do a 
good job." 
</P>
<P>
Cosworth engines will also be in cars driven by Brayton, Tero Palmroth, Pancho 
Carter and Dean Hall. 
</P>
<P>
There will also be three Judd engines for Raul Boesel, Geoff Brabham and Scott 
Goodyear; two Porsches, for John Andretti and Teo Fabi, and two Alfa Romeos for 
Roberto Guerrero and Al Unser. 
</P>
<P>
Up front, however, in the first three rows, the fastest nine cars are all

(25.00), and Jackie Foreman of Locke, who led the 100- and 300-meter low 
hurdles qualifiers in 14.3 and 45.26 respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey is the defending boys' champion and is expected to be challenged by 
Washington, which has three finalists in the 100 and 200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the top boys' performers: Donovan Burks of Washington, the top 
qualifier in the 100 (10.71) and 200 meters (21.59); John Floyd of Locke 
(47.39) and Lamont Warren of Dorsey (48.28) in the 400 meters, and Washington's 
400-meter relay team, which ran 40.07 in last week's semifinals.

AUSTRALIAN IS NAMED NEW ANNOUNCER AT HOLLYPARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unsuccessful in its attempts to land Trevor Denman, Hollywood Park circled the 
globe to find its new track announcer. 
</P>
<P>
Don Alexander, who replaced Milo Perrins -- who took over from Bine Masters, 
who replaced Jim Byers -- is out and Australian Michael Wrona is in. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Park management, which never hid its desire to find another 
race-caller, wanted John Tapp, Wrona's mentor and the dean of Australian 
announcers. 
</P>
<P>
However, he didn't want to come to the United States, so he recommended Wrona. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander will remain at Hollywood Park through the Memorial Day program and he 
will call the "bulk of the races" until he departs. Beginning next Wednesday, 
Wrona, 24, will be on his own. 
</P>
<P>
How Wrona will be accepted here remains to be seen. There will be the 
inevitable comparisons to Denman, whom Santa Anita wouldn't permit to work at 
Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander, who worked as a patrol judge at Hollywood Park before he replaced 
Perrins last year, has been offered a job in the racing office. Before he 
called the final race Wednesday, he said he had accepted the spot, but his 
duties have yet to be determined. BOB MIESZERSKI

CEMAN PROVES VOLLEYBALL IS A THINKING MAN'S GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART MATTHEWS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When you think of a typical high school volleyball player, Canyon Ceman fits 
the image perfectly. He is 6-4, blond and handsome. 
</P>
<P>
But Ceman is much more than a typical volleyball player. He can discuss 
electrochemistry as freely as he can spike or set a volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, his academic reputation is even more impressive than his volleyball 
skill. 
</P>
<P>
Ceman, 17, has never had a grade lower than an A in his 12 years of public 
education. 
</P>
<P>
He is the senior setter for Mira Costa High's volleyball team. The Mustangs, 
unbeaten in 21 matches, are the top-ranked team in USA Today's Top 25 poll. 
</P>
<P>
Five of Mira Costa's six starters, including Ceman, are taller than 6-3. But it 
isn't hard to find the brains behind all that brawn. 
</P>
<P>
"Volleyball is at least 50% a mental sport," Mira Costa Coach Mike Cook said. 
"You could have a team of physical giants, but if they weren't tough upstairs, 
you wouldn't have a good team." 
</P>
<P>
In volleyball, Ceman's name is mentioned with Aaron Boone of Huntington Beach 
Edison and Lloy Ball of Ft. Wayne, Ind., as the top prep setters in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, Ceman will anchor Mira Costa's quest for a perfect season when 
the Mustangs (21-0) meet Edison (17-1) for the Southern Section 4-A Division 
championship at 7:30 at Marina High in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, Ceman helped his team to a 15-4, 15-2, 15-9 victory over San 
Marcos of Santa Barbara at Redondo High. 
</P>
<P>
Ceman, who also played basketball for Mira Costa, has found the perfect college 
match for his scholar-athlete skills. Next year, he'll attend Stanford -- a 
powerhouse in both volleyball and academics -- on a partial athletic 
scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Ceman received a letter from Bill Neville, the U.S. national 
volleyball team coach. Neville invited Ceman to a two-week tryout and training 
session this summer at the USA Volleyball National Team Center in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Within a span of weeks, several of Ceman's long-term goals are falling into 
place. 
</P>
<P>
One goal is to play for the national team in either the 1992 Barcelona Olympics 
or the 1996 Olympic Games in Athens. Neville's letter is a step in that 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
Another goal was to graduate from high school with a 4.0 grade-point average 
(actually higher because most of Ceman's classes have been honors classes). On 
June 21 -- his birthday -- Ceman will be a valedictorian when Mira Costa's 
Class of '90 graduates. 
</P>
<P>
Another goal is an undefeated season for Mira Costa, a team that had the marks 
of greatness before the season started. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided we wanted to be the best high school volleyball team that ever 
played," Ceman said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the Mustangs have lived up to their billing. The team has lost only two 
games, both of those coming in a five-game Mira Costa victory at Edison in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
Cook expects the rematch to be equally tough. Edison is the second-ranked team 
in the 4-A behind Mira Costa. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll play with more intensity from beginning to end this time around," Cook 
said. "A lot of that comes from respect. The first time we played, we thought 
Edison would roll over after we won the first two games. And that's not the way 
it happened." 
</P>
<P>
At the center of Saturday's action will be Ceman, who has the physique of an 
outside hitter, but the all-around court skills of a setter. 
</P>
<P>
He's an accomplished beach player, which helps explain his versatility. 
</P>
<P>
When Ceman returned from the Olympic Festival in Norman, Okla., last summer, 
where he had been the setter on the gold medal West team, he headed straight 
for the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Ceman and David Swatik -- a 6-4 outside hitter for Mira Costa -- teamed up to 
play several two-man amateur tournaments, winning one in Playa del Rey to earn 
their "AA" ratings by the California Beach Volleyball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
A "AAA" rating is only one step away from professional beach volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
"When you play on the beach, you have to be able to do it all -- dig, set, 
serve, spike and block," Ceman said. 
</P>
<P>
In Mira Costa's scheme, however, Ceman isn't the one pounding the ball to the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
"Canyon can hammer, but we've taken his hammer away," said Cook, who moved 
Ceman into strictly a setter's role midway through the season. "So Canyon isn't 
running up the glory stats, but he's probably most proud of the fact that we're 
21-0." 
</P>
<P>
Ceman uses his powerful legs -- he jokes that his left leg is longer than his 
right from using it to take off for slam dunks on the basketball court -- to 
pop accurate sets. Ceman can deliver a volleyball on target up to 35 feet away 
-- nearly all the way across the court. 
</P>
<P>
"People think that setting is all in the hands," Cook said. "But correct 
setting is total body movement. Those huge, strong legs make it easy for Canyon 
to set the ball long distances. Referees often tell me they're astounded with 
how far he can set the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Ceman is also an intelligent setter. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't see him doing too many dumb things," Cook said. "He doesn't set into 
two-man blocks, for instance. He has a knack for isolating his hitters 
one-on-one." 
</P>
<P>
He also has a knack for winning in all facets of life. 
</P>
<P>
Ceman was part of the four-man team that recently won Mira Costa's annual 
"Scholar Quiz," a instant-recall trivia competition based on the old College 
Bowl television show. 
</P>
<P>
Ceman's group beat out 64 other four-person teams for the title and first 
prize: a $100 savings bond to each member of the team. 
</P>
<P>
Ceman, who specialized in math and science questions for his quartet, still has 
his savings bond from his team's victory in that same competition last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm waiting for the bond to mature," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ceman, who hasn't missed a day of school at Mira Costa, has already passed 
advanced-placement examinations in European history, American history, and 
Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, he took four more advanced placement exams in economics, calculus, 
English and chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
If successful in all four tests -- a score of 3 on a 5-point scale is passing 
-- Ceman will have more than a year's worth of college credits when he begins 
work at Stanford as an economics major. 
</P>
<P>
He would use his head start for either a double major or a master's degree in 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
Ceman said the closest he came to getting a B was in honors physics last year. 
But he managed an A for earning the classes' highest average on lab 
assignments. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his obvious gifts, Ceman is a serious, polite and down-to-earth young 
man. His mother, Sandra Ceman, an administrator for the city of Redondo Beach, 
said the family "hasn't had to make the doors any wider for his head yet." 
</P>
<P>
The parents have pointed, rather than pushed Canyon in his current direction. 
His father, George, is a engineering manager for TRW. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's something out there that Canyon can't do, it hasn't been put in 
front of him yet," George Ceman said. "Obviously, I'm proud of him, but I 
always remind him that there are bigger and better challenges out there and not 
to get too comfortable. But he always seems to bend to the task." 
</P>
<P>
Not everything has come easily to young Ceman. His father recalls that Canyon 
is a bit shy around girls and, for a while, he had trouble learning to drive a 
stick shift. 
</P>
<P>
There's another Achilles' heel, Sandra Ceman pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't seem to be able to push the buttons on the washing machine too 
well," she said. "It's not that he doesn't know how, though. Sometimes I think 
he'd rather watch me do it."

MCGUIRE SHUTS DOWN BIRMINGHAM IN STYLE, 6-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

Players dragged the field happily, rock music blared over the loudspeakers and 
general merriment reigned at El Camino Real High on a bright, breezy Wednesday 
afternoon. And why not? The host Conquistadores were celebrating a 6-0 
whitewash of Birmingham in the City Section 4-A Division baseball 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
But any backslapping for catcher Bobby Kim, whose two-run home run in the first 
inning provided the only necessary offense, had better be just that: 
backslapping. 
</P>
<P>
Don't slap his hand until Friday at least, when El Camino Real (20-2-1) will 
meet San Fernando, a 7-3 winner over Kennedy, in the semifinals. Don't bruise 
the tender paw that was on the receiving end of smoke-throwing left-hander Ryan 
McGuire's seventh inning of terror. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he was going to break my hand," Kim said, only half-jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
Three outs from closing his three-hit shutout, McGuire (7-1) accelerated 
Birmingham's demise. He fanned Mike Malkin on three pitches, sat down Ruben 
Flores on four, and, with two hard strikes on Mike Belasco, induced an 
opposite-field bloop to end his performance with authority. 
</P>
<P>
All heat-seeking missiles. 
</P>
<P>
The display delighted the 400 in attendance and fairly burned Birmingham 
(19-7-1), which didn't quite know what had hit it. 
</P>
<P>
"We were trying to hit his fastballs," said Birmingham Coach Wayne Sink, who 
coached his last game after 26 years at the school. "But he just literally blew 
it by us. . . . He's the hardest thrower we've seen all year." 
</P>
<P>
Kim concurred. 
</P>
<P>
"Those were the fastest balls I've caught all year," Kim said. "I was giving 
him the breaking ball and he was shaking me off. He was just pumping gas." 
</P>
<P>
That McGuire, who finished his third shutout with six strikeouts, would even 
start was in question up until Tuesday. It seems El Camino Real Coach Mike Maio 
was leaning toward 6-foot-4 Pat Treend, he of the 11-0 record. But according to 
McGuire, he and Treend ganged up on the coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach wanted to pitch Pat," McGuire said. "But we had a discussion. He had all 
his stats and numbers out. He's got more numbers and stats than the Elias 
Baseball Bureau. He knows stuff about me that I don't know about me. He's like 
Rain Man. 
</P>
<P>
"But Pat and myself, we tend to go on how we feel." 
</P>
<P>
McGuire had room to breathe after Kim's 380-foot-plus blast to straightaway 
center field off left-hander Jason Mansfield (5-5). El Camino Real pushed 
across a run in the second on Jeff Marks' fielder's choice with the bases full 
and added two more in the fourth on Marks' two-run single. A sacrifice fly by 
Josh Massey in the fifth closed out the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
In lobbying for McGuire, wasn't Treend forfeiting center stage? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, no," McGuire said with a grin. "He gets the glory. He gets to pitch on 
Friday."

SAN FERNANDO BURIES DEFENDING TITLIST KENNEDY, 7-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Fernando High baseball Coach Steve Marden has been through this playoff 
business about a million times. Consequently, he has developed his own 
terminology, partly to coerce, partly to scare his team. 
</P>
<P>
After all, if a club shows up with its head in the sand at this stage of the 
season, the other team might just kick dirt all over the rest of it. 
</P>
<P>
Marden, then, is part caretaker, part undertaker. For instance, he refers to 
the single-elimination format as "sudden death." And if that doesn't send a 
chill up his team's collective spine, there's always the creaky, cobweb-filled 
pine box in his office. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an empty box inside the office," Marden said with a grin, "just 
waiting to be filled up with uniforms." 
</P>
<P>
A tad grim? Perhaps, but San Fernando was indeed the reaper Wednesday, taking 
advantage of 11 walks to defeat visiting Kennedy, 7-3, in a City Section 4-A 
Division quarterfinal game. San Fernando (18-6-2) will play El Camino Real in 
the semifinals Friday. 
</P>
<P>
From the outset, Marden ordered his team to sit back on Kennedy starter Denny 
Sharp (8-5), who had pitched a complete game four days earlier. The tactic paid 
off; Sharp walked four batters in the second inning, two of whom forced in runs 
to help hand San Fernando a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 4-1, defending champion Kennedy (17-10) rallied for two unearned runs 
in the fifth off left-hander Canto Franco. Ben Guzman led off with an infield 
nubber and moved to second on Billy Ramirez's walk. With two out, Franco (9-0) 
hit Troy Bourne in the foot, loading the bases for Garret Anderson, who had 
doubled and scored Kennedy's first run in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson delivered, drilling an 0-2 curve off the glove of a leaping David 
Rojas at second to bring Kennedy to within 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
On came reliever John Najar, who had as much smoke on his fastball as he had 
coming from his ears. Najar had come to the plate three times -- twice with the 
bases loaded -- and stranded seven runners. In the bottom of the fifth, he 
would fan for the second time with the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
Time for atonement. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to make up for that," Najar said. "That was embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
With runners at first and third, Najar retired Lazaro Campos on a grounder to 
short to maintain the one-run lead. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando added two runs in the fifth on a pair of bases-loaded walks and 
another in the sixth on a run-scoring single by sophomore shortstop Luis 
Rodriguez, but Kennedy mounted one last rally in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Pinch-hitter John Davis led off with a double and moved to third on a single by 
Jason Rosen. Najar then retired Bourne on a ground out, bringing up Anderson -- 
who has signed to play at Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
Najar struck out Anderson on three pitches, the last a wicked slider. Najar 
walked Campos to load the bases before striking out Palmer Drain -- the 
potential tying run -- to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
Call it a stake through the heart. 
</P>
<P>
"John didn't do the job with the stick," Marden said. "So I guess he realized 
he had to do it with his arm."

The City Section might have satisfied most of its football coaches when it 
agreed to maintain two divisions for the football playoffs next fall, but the 
ruling could create a monster headache for Commissioner Hal Harkness. 
</P>
<P>
The decision reached at Monday's Interscholastic Athletics Committee meeting 
calls for a 12-team 4-A Division and a 37-team 3-A Division. All 12 4-A teams 
will qualify for the playoffs and 16 3-A teams will form a second bracket. 
</P>
<P>
The 4-A Division will consist of the eight teams in the Northwest Valley 
Conference plus Pacific League members Banning, Carson, Crenshaw and Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
The Metro League of Fairfax, Hamilton, Manual Arts and Palisades, which 
competed in the 4-A Division last year, has been added to the other eight 3-A 
leagues, creating a logjam in the lower bracket. Nine first-place teams will 
gain playoff berths, but there is room for only seven second-place finishers; 
time constraints limit the City to a four-round tournament, allowing for a 
maximum 16 teams. 
</P>
<P>
That means the City must decide which two second-place teams stay home. 
Harkness can think of better ways to spend an evening than making that call. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard enough just seeding a bracket and that's really getting 
frustrating," he said. "Seeding is imperfect at best." 
</P>
<P>
Add football: IAC approved the plan after nearly two hours of discussion that 
included a report from Monroe Coach Dave Lertzman, who polled the City's 49 
football coaches. His survey showed that 29 coaches favored two divisions, 11 
supported a one-division format and nine were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
The one-division plan had the support of Dorsey football Coach Paul Knox, an 
IAC member and president of the Los Angeles Coaches Assn. He argued that a 
12-team division is too small to conduct a meaningful playoff and prevents the 
4-A teams from seeing new teams in the playoffs. Dorsey, for example, will play 
two of its three nonleague games in 1990 against possible playoff foes Granada 
Hills and San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed but I'm not too surprised," he said. "I just hope we don't 
get stuck with a 12-team division forever. With no new teams, the playoffs 
aren't exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Lertzman, the author of the current conference format, expressed relief that 
the two-division system was saved. As an example of the benefits, he cited the 
Monroe boys' volleyball team that won the City 3-A title last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We had 300 people there cheering like crazy and they didn't care that it was 
3-A," he said. "All they knew was that they were playing for a City title. Our 
kids are walking around school knowing they are City champions. That's brought 
a lot of pride to our school. I think it makes more sense educationally to have 
the two divisions." 
</P>
<P>
Fast company: It would be understandable if Marion Jones had felt slightly out 
of place when she stepped into the starting blocks for the women's 100 meters 
at last Sunday's Jack in the Box Invitational at UCLA. The 14-year-old Rio Mesa 
High freshman toed the starting line with such track stars as Michelle Finn, a 
former collegiate champion, and 1986 World Junior champion Tina Iheagwan. 
</P>
<P>
But don't expect any apologies from Jones. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going into the race to win," said Jones, who just two days earlier had 
won the 100 and 200 to lead the Spartans to the Southern Section 3-A Division 
team title. "I'm never going into any race thinking I'll be happy with second 
or third." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Jones appeared quite satisfied after finishing fourth in 11.67 
seconds, .01 seconds off her personal best. Finn won in 11.41. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll take it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones went into Sunday's meet aiming at Michele Glover's national age-group 
record of 11.63 and Brenda Wilson's freshman class record of 11.60. She will 
get her next shot at that record Friday in the Southern Section Masters Meet 
when she will face national leader Inger Miller of Pasadena Muir. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal is to beat Inger Miller and if I beat her, I'm sure it'll be faster 
than 11.60," Jones said.

WEIL WEARS OUT TORRANCE TO BOOST HART INTO QUARTERFINALS, 3-0

<P>
In case anyone has doubts, the tireless right arm of Hart High pitcher Kym Weil 
still has plenty of innings left in it. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, Weil donned her trademark black headband and white hair ribbon, then 
blew seven innings worth of fastballs past host Torrance in pitching Hart to a 
3-0 victory in the second round of the Southern Section 4-A Division softball 
playoffs at Charles Wilson Park in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Weil struck out 16 and gave up only four infield singles, improving her season 
record to 26-2. 
</P>
<P>
She also added to her Southern Section record for career victories, which 
stands at 87. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Hart (27-3) will face Pacifica, a 4-3 winner over Hacienda Heights 
Wilson in nine innings, in Friday's quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
"The pressure builds every game," Weil said. "Every round we play, the teams we 
face get better. But I tend to pitch better under pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Weil pitched a no-hitter last week against Rio Mesa to lift Hart into the 
second round, and, Wednesday she lowered her earned-run average to 0.31, 
striking out every Torrance batter except leadoff hitter Jenny Yokoyama. 
</P>
<P>
Hart got all the runs it needed in the third. Torrance pitcher Jamie Sibley 
walked the first two batters and Nicole White followed with an infield hit to 
load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Yokoyama, Torrance's shortstop, made a throwing error on the next play that 
allowed two runs to score. 
</P>
<P>
Hart added an insurance run in the fourth when shortstop Krissy Carpenter drove 
home Casey O'Brien with a double down the left-field line. 
</P>
<P>
"We hit the ball hard all game, but mostly it went right at them," Hart Coach 
Al Weil said. "So we went to other things, like bunting, to put the ball in 
play." STUART MATTHEWS

OAKMONT'S BUDKE LEADS CITY GOLF BY TWO STROKES 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mary Budke of Oakmont Country Club has a two-stroke lead entering the final 
round today in the Los Angeles City Women's Golf Championships at Rancho Park 
Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
After shooting a 75 Tuesday in the opening round to tie with Claudine Rubin of 
Woodland Hills Country Club, Budke had two birdies en route to a 74 Wednesday 
for a three-over-par 149. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin fell behind Budke Wednesday when she double-bogied the first hole, and 
made only one birdie the rest of the way to finish at 76 for a 151. 
</P>
<P>
Heidi Voorhees, a 17-year-old from Notre Dame High of Sherman Oaks, is in third 
place, six strokes off the lead. She shot rounds of 80-75. 
</P>
<P>
Eight strokes behind is Linda Pearson of La Canada. Pearson made tournament 
history Tuesday when she became the first left-hander to score a hole in one, 
which she did with a three-iron on No. 16, a 158-yard par three. 
</P>
<P>
Terri Melansan of Rancho Park, the defending champion, tied with Budke for the 
low score Wednesday with a 74, but she shot an 85 in the opening round.

Play begins today at 9 a.m. MARYANN HUDSON

BANK OF CHINA OPENS IN HONG KONG SKYSCRAPER

<P>
The Beijing-owned Bank of China has opened for business in Hong Kong in a 
70-story prism-shaped skyscraper that dominates the city's skyline and that has 
sparked superstitious worries among residents. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,289-foot-tall skyscraper was designed by Chinese-American architect I. M. 
Pei and is the tallest building in the British colony, which is due to be 
handed back to the communist mainland in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
But the building's four right-angled triangular prisms, placed together to form 
a long, thin square column topped by twin antennas, have been condemned by many 
of the territory's superstitious residents. 
</P>
<P>
Scholars of Fung Shui -- the study of wind and water -- have said the 
building's prism design is a sure sign of bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
The sharp edges on the interlocking triangles that make up the sides of the 
building have been likened to daggers. The twin antennas that top the tower 
have been compared to empty chopsticks.

A BALLOON'S EYE VIEW OF RABBITS AND ROLLING HILLS; 
</P>
<P>
SOARING: SIX COMPANIES LAUNCH FROM MOORPARK OR LANCASTER, WHERE OPEN SPACES ARE 
IDEAL FOR ROAMING THE SKIES AND SKIMMING THE TERRAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By R. DANIEL FOSTER, Foster is a regular contributor to Valley View.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the mid-1970s, the popularity of hot-air ballooning soared, and several San 
Fernando Valley-based companies emerged to market the sport that was first 
developed in the 1700s. A decade later, ballooning had gone out of fashion, but 
now it's back in vogue as people search for the perfect present. 
</P>
<P>
"A huge part of the business comes from people who want to give an unusual 
gift," said Bruce Williams, pilot for Calabasas-based Balloon Adventures. 
"We're seeing a steady growth in popularity now." 
</P>
<P>
Half a dozen balloon companies are currently based throughout the San Fernando 
Valley, but most launch from Moorpark or Lancaster, where open spaces are ideal 
for roaming the skies. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Moorpark provides a blanket of rolling hills and fruit orchards to 
sail over, but views of rooftops are increasing because of sprawling housing 
developments. Lancaster features plenty of open land, good visibility, a 
mountainous backdrop and packs of desert jack rabbits to chase as balloons skim 
the terrain. 
</P>
<P>
The first manned hot-air balloon sailed 5 1/2 miles over Paris in 1783. 
Hydrogen and helium were used for buoyancy in some early balloons, but propane 
burners were introduced when the sport was revived following World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Here's what to expect from a modern balloon ride: 
</P>
<P>
Balloons usually set sail at sunrise to take advantage of optimum wind 
conditions. Wear warm, layered clothing that can be shed while under way, since 
a balloon's propane heater sheds a portion of heat on passengers. Dress for 
adventure -- you may launch from a fertile cow pasture and, after an hour 
floating two to 10 miles and ascending to 3,000 feet, may land in a cornfield. 
Flights occasionally are canceled because of gusty winds. Most companies can 
accommodate two to six passengers per trip. Individuals are mailed detailed 
launch site directions before takeoff. A light meal, served with champagne, is 
a tradition which follows most flights. 
</P>
<P>
* L.A. Balloon Port offers two daily flights, departing 45 minutes before 
sunrise and an hour after sunrise. Pre-sunrise flights are $150 per person and 
post-sunrise flights are $135 per person. The one-hour excursion includes a 
champagne brunch. "People can see the lights of the Valley and watch the sun 
come up over the San Gabriel Mountains," said owner David Mair, ho began his 
business 14 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers meet at a restored 1939 farmhouse, now converted to the company's 
headquarters at Quartz Hill, near Lancaster. Champagne is served during the 
flight and the brunch, featuring homemade breads, is served at the headquarters 
following the flight at 42222 50th St. West, Quartz Hill, 93536. (800) 
227-2363. 
</P>
<P>
* Oz Airline Hot-Air Balloon Adventures flies out of the Tierra Rejada Valley, 
near Moorpark. Prices for one-hour sunrise flights, offered daily, are $150 per 
person or $250 per couple. Sunset flights, $175 per person, are occasionally 
offered, weather permitting. Sunrise flights include a champagne brunch served 
in a greenhouse adjacent to the launch site near Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see lots of Christmas tree farms up there, vegetable stands and acres 
of strawberry fields," said owner Bruce Brinkerhoff. "We once flew low over a 
strawberry field and pickers threw strawberries up into our basket. We caught 
them and waved back." (818) 848-0733. (213) GOING-UP. 
</P>
<P>
* High Adventures offers three sunrise flights out of Lancaster and Moorpark 
each Saturday and Sunday. Half-hour flights are $75 per person, 45-minute 
flights are $100 per person and one-hour excursions are $125 per person. 
Flights are occasionally offered on weekdays. 
</P>
<P>
Prices include a champagne brunch with juice, bagels, cheese and summer sausage 
served at the launch site. "On a clear day, you can see the Channel Islands if 
you're high enough," says owner Iain Kite. "There's lots of rolling hills, 
horse ranches and fields. May and June are great months to go ballooning 
because the hills are still green." (818) 891-8864. 
</P>
<P>
* Piuma Aircraft flies out of Moorpark, Lancaster, Camarillo and Perris Valley 
in Riverside County. One-hour sunrise flights, offered daily, are $120 a 
person, although group and advance-reservation discount rates are available. 
Flights departing one hour before sunset leave from Camarillo daily, and cost 
$170. 
</P>
<P>
After sunrise flights, a complimentary champagne brunch is offered at the 
launch site. "Ballooning is a 200-year-old sport, and the food and drink have 
always been a part of the adventure," said owner Marilyn Keown, who began her 
business 12 years ago. (818) 888-0576. 
</P>
<P>
* Adventure Flights launches balloons each daybreak from a field in Moorpark. 
Sunset flights, priced at $160 for one hour, also are offered out of Del Mar. 
Half-hour to 45-minute sunrise flights cost $65 per person and one- to 1 
1/2-hour flights are $115 per person. 
</P>
<P>
Prices include a continental breakfast before the ride and a champagne brunch 
following the excursion back at the launch site. "We give passengers an 
'ascension' certificate and a balloon pin too," said Jim Bilbrey, owner of the 
15-year-old enterprise. (213) 651-5311. 
</P>
<P>
* Balloon Adventures offers one-hour sunrise and sunset flights daily out of 
Moorpark, Camarillo and Lancaster. Prices, which include champagne following 
the flight, range from $80 to $170, depending on the day and time desired. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Bruce Williams said the champagne tradition started as a peace offering 
to farmers when balloons first began landing in their fields 200 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We still get mad farmers who don't like us landing in their fields, and the 
champagne still works," said Williams, who began his business 13 years ago. 
"Six months ago we landed behind a construction site. We asked the workers to 
open up some locked gates so we could get the balloon, but they said 'Too bad, 
you should have thought of that before you landed.' They weren't interested in 
our champagne, but they did open up the gates when they saw how much beer we 
had." (800) 843-7433.

NATIVE PLANTS AND SHRUBS LOWER THE WATER BILL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
By using a combination of drought-tolerant native and non-native plants in the 
garden, you can conserve water and still enjoy an array of color, texture, 
shapes and scents unique to the region. 
</P>
<P>
Summer is the time to plan, not plant. 
</P>
<P>
Fall is the best time to plant native plants; the air is cool and the soil is 
still warm. During the first year, more frequent watering is needed, but once 
established, these plants are summer teetotalers and thrive year in and year 
out. 
</P>
<P>
A starter list of some popular drought-tolerant, flowering native shrubs 
well-suited to the San Fernando Valley's semi-arid terrain: 
</P>
<P>
* Manzanita: Attractive for its smooth, shiny elliptic green leaves and 
red-brown stems. Grows to 6 feet or more on hilly landscapes. Mid-winter/early 
spring yield spectacular small, waxy white flowers. 
</P>
<P>
* California lilac: Large, spreading shrub with stiff, shiny branchlets and 
small green leaves covered in early spring with clusters of white to pale-blue 
blossoms. 
</P>
<P>
* Buckwheat: Native to chaparral. Grows up to 8 feet in height, depending on 
species. Clouds of pale yellow, pink, white or red flowers bloom into summer. 
</P>
<P>
* Nevin's barberry: Saved from extinction in the wilds of the Valley by the 
Theodore Payne Foundation. Native dense shrub valuable for distinct bluish 
foliage and yellow flowers followed by reddish berries in late summer. Arching 
branches that reach to the ground are useful as a hedge and bird sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
* Currant: Small, pinkish spring flowers. Tolerates drought, but loves oak tree 
shade. Currants are edible in syrups and pies if sweetened.FRANN BART

The New School for Social Research in New York City filed suit against the 
National Endowment for the Arts Wednesday -- arguing that a requirement that 
NEA grant recipients pledge not to produce obscene work is an illegal restraint 
of artistic free expression. 
</P>
<P>
In filing the action in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the New School -- 
which in recent weeks has retained the prominent New York First Amendment 
expert Floyd Abrams as an adviser -- has introduced a new dimension into the 
political controversy over the NEA's artistic independence.

The New School filed the lawsuit after concluding, its president said, that 
accepting a $45,000 grant from the NEA to redesign a courtyard at its Greenwich 
Village campus would require it to pledge to obey disputed anti-obscenity 
language in the NEA's 1990 appropriation bill. The NEA's own general counsel, 
Julie Davis, has said unequivocally that, in her opinion, the language in the 
bill is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, which was assigned to Dist. Court Judge Louis Stanton, seeks a 
declaratory judgment -- a finding that a law is unconstitutional before anyone 
has actually been charged with violating it -- and an injunction against an NEA 
requirement that grantees receiving 1990 funds sign a form acknowledging that 
they will comply with the pornography restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law in question, the NEA is precluded from providing money to support 
art the endowment judges to be "obscene, including but not limited to 
depictions of sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the sexual exploitation of children 
or individuals engaged in sex acts" when the art in question lacks "serious 
literary, artistic, political or scientific value." 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the NEA's transformation of an already unconstitutional instruction 
given to it by the Congress into an oath required of all grant recipients 
greatly amplifies the chilling effect of the underlying law," said a statement 
released by the New School. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Fanton, an American history scholar who is the New School's president, 
conceded that, at first flush, the decision to sue over the grant for a design 
project may seem an unlikely forum in which to raise a constitutional challenge 
against an already beleaguered federal agency. (The project is slated to engage 
internationally known sculptor Martin Puryear, and architect Michael Van 
Valkenburgh.) 
</P>
<P>
But in an interview, Fanton said the New School had decided to take on the NEA 
largely based on his own reading of 20th-Century American history, which led 
him to conclude that political chemistry may be developing in the country today 
that is ideologically similar to the early stages of the McCarthy era of the 
1950s and the Red Scare after World War I. 
</P>
<P>
"I see the stakes here as much higher than the grant or the NEA," Fanton said. 
"It seems to me that there are times in American history when the society seems 
less strong (than at others) on First Amendment rights. 
</P>
<P>
"We tend to be prepared to qualify the First Amendment when we are having 
confidence problems as a nation. I see some early warning signs. You may think 
of McCarthyism as a phenomenon of the 1950s, but it owes its origins to the 
1940s. (Developments like) McCarthyism do not just happen, full blown, out of 
nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
The decision to sue the NEA came after nearly a month of correspondence between 
the New School and NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer in which the New School 
raised a series of broad objections to the obscenity language. 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer has repeatedly said in public appearances, interviews and private 
conversations that the wording is unnecessary and superfluous. He has actively 
sought to persuade congressmen and senators to abandon it in future legislation 
bearing on the arts agency. 
</P>
<P>
The filing of the court action Wednesday afternoon puts the arts endowment in 
the curious position of being the key defendant in a lawsuit in which its own 
top officials have said they agree with the legal position taken by the party 
suing them. The New School, a respected, progressive university, operates 
instructional divisions in the liberal arts, social sciences, art and music -- 
most in New York City, but including the Otis/Parsons Art Institute in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In one letter to Frohnmayer, Fanton asked whether the legal effect of signing 
the anti-obscenity pledge could cause the New School to be subject to 
disciplinary action if ever an art exhibit shown in the courtyard contains work 
that is judged to be obscene. 
</P>
<P>
Fanton noted that the wording in the NEA funding bill -- a mixture of passages 
from a landmark 1974 U.S. Supreme Court decision, and wording proposed to rein 
in the NEA by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) -- may conflict with existing New 
School policies guaranteeing academic freedom. The wording, Fanton argued, puts 
academic institutions in a difficult position. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe it would be a sad outcome of the NEA obscenity condition if some of 
this nation's best arts institutions and individual artists severed 
relationships with the National Endowment for the Arts," Fanton wrote 
Frohnmayer on April 27. "And yet the present dilemma threatens just such a 
result." 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer declined to comment on the New School litigation and the arts 
endowment declined to say immediately how it would respond to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The NEA's Davis and other lawyers contend the NEA funding law is 
unconstitutional because the obscenity language is vague and constitutes an 
unlawful prior restraint on creation of artwork. Lawyers have also asserted the 
wording transfers judgment of what is obscene to a federal agency -- the NEA -- 
when the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that such decisions can only be made 
by local communities. 
</P>
<P>
The suit by the New School was the second piece of litigation to come into play 
in the NEA controversy this week. On Monday, New York City artist David 
Wojnarowicz sued the American Family Assn. and its director, the Rev. Donald 
Wildmon, for copyright violation and defamation of character over Wildmon's 
distribution of severely cropped versions of Wojnarowicz images, which Wildmon 
characterized as obscene and offensive. 
</P>
<P>
In a May 2 letter to Fanton, the NEA chairman -- a former Portland, Ore., trial 
lawyer -- said of the controversial law: "I am obligated to uphold it until 
such time as it is withdrawn, deemed unconstitutional or otherwise modified." 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot tell you how to proceed either in a legal forum or otherwise," 
Frohnmayer said. But "we too have severe questions about the constitutionality 
of this law. I share . . . your concern about the effect of this law; about 
increasing constrictions on the ability of artists to speak freely through 
their art, and about an increasingly intolerant, but vocal part of our 
society." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was filed despite a Tuesday night phone call from NEA counsel Davis 
to New School lawyer Abrams, in which she tried to persuade him to drop the 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to file the lawsuit came after weeks of consideration at the New 
School to reject the NEA money outright, a tactic already embraced by at least 
two artists -- New York theater producer Joseph Papp and Venice choreographer 
Ferne Ackerman. 
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with the decision said the choice to sue to effect 
constitutional invalidation of the NEA obscenity statute came after New School 
officials decided the situation required action with more far-reaching 
implications than simply turning down the money. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear what direct effect the New School lawsuit would have on 
pending bills to renew the NEA for another five years and provide funds for it 
in 1991. Even if the New School petition is successful in getting an injunction 
against enforcement of the law, key congressmen said the legal battle would 
likely have little bearing on decisions in Congress on the NEA in the next few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I would guess most members (of Congress) would say, 'Let the Supreme Court 
decide it,' " said Rep. Sidney Yates (D-Ill.), a key NEA supporter. "It (the 
legal dispute between the NEA and the New School) wouldn't be controlling."

<P>
A press officer for Poland's new Solidarity-led government had just finished 
giving his first briefing to the news media last year when several local 
reporters followed him back to his office. 
</P>
<P>
"What are we supposed to write? What were the most important points?" they 
asked the official, who was shocked to encounter such a subservient press 
corps. 
</P>
<P>
While the Communist lock on political power in Poland has ended, the 
journalistic practices associated with the regime have not. Just as reporters 
once repeated the Communist Party line without question, many are prepared to 
give the new government the same type of uncritical coverage, says Polish 
journalist Robert Bogdanski, who recounted the story of the press briefing. 
</P>
<P>
To help stimulate change in the Polish news media, the BBC has launched a 
program designed to introduce broadcasters from that country to the techniques 
and philosophies behind news coverage in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Bogdanski, an art history graduate who wound up working as an underground 
reporter in 1984, is among the participants who have been brought to the U.K. 
to see how broadcasters work here. 
</P>
<P>
The program, part of the $83-million "know-how" fund that the British 
government created to help Poland make the transition to democracy, will bring 
36 Polish broadcasters, in groups of six, to Britain. Each group will spend six 
weeks observing the BBC's radio and TV operations, as well as the operations of 
other broadcast companies. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the course, the visiting journalists also will produce stories for 
the BBC World Service that will be broadcast back to Poland. 
</P>
<P>
The program is intended to give participants a "warts and all" view of the role 
of the media in a democratic society, says Gwyneth Henderson, head of BBC World 
Service training, who designed the program. She emphasizes that it is not a 
training program, but merely an opportunity for the Poles to see how things are 
done differently elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"We are showing them what we do and telling them why we do it," says Gienek 
Smolar, head of the BBC World Service's Polish section. 
</P>
<P>
Smolar and Henderson made two trips to Poland to choose journalists for the 
program. They were looking for broadcast reporters who hadn't been completely 
immersed in the ways of the previous regime. "We wanted young journalists with 
open eyes and ears," says Smolar. "The energetic ones. Editors of the future." 
</P>
<P>
The Poles, for their part, seem to be generally impressed by the British way of 
gathering and presenting the news -- with some exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, it can get a little boring," says program participant Aleksandra 
Zieleniewska, a longtime underground reporter who is working to establish an 
independent radio station in Krakow. 
</P>
<P>
She thinks Britain's TV news shows get too bogged down in providing needless 
background when they should jump into their stories. "I'm not so interested in 
hearing the basic history of the Earth," she says. "I like (stories) shorter 
and quicker." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson says she is not surprised to hear that the Poles might think British 
news stories are too long. She says that Polish TV news programs spew out items 
in rapid-fire succession. "If you saw their television news," says the BBC 
executive, "you'd see they could not actually be explaining anything." 
</P>
<P>
The difference in news presentation styles might be chalked up at least 
partially to the difference in the political climates of Britain and Poland. 
</P>
<P>
"They are so sure of reality here," says Zieleniewska. "Of today, of tomorrow. 
The air of stability is everywhere. Of course in Poland, everything changes 
each week." 
</P>
<P>
The Polish journalists also are fascinated by the fact that reporters here 
generally do not include their own opinions about a story within their reports. 
</P>
<P>
There is no recent history of nonpartisan reporting in Poland, says Smolar, 
head of the Polish section, adding that, "It's very difficult to change." 
Consequently, he says, many news reporters there still begin their stories " 'I 
think,' or 'In the interest of Poland,' or 'Solidarity wants.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Journalists at the BBC do not present their own views," says Jolanta 
Fajkowska, a news anchor on Polish television. 
</P>
<P>
"The main rule is, they have no views," adds Zieleniewska. "It's a wonderful 
idea not to present your own ideas in the reports." 
</P>
<P>
While the Polish journalists appreciate the notion of balancing stories with 
opposing viewpoints, they say they've seen BBC reporters go to ridiculous 
lengths to find someone with a differing opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Bogdanski, who describes British broadcast news as "brilliant," has nonetheless 
come to the conclusion that the reporting is not as "objective" as it's cracked 
up to be. That's because, he says, the topics of stories that are presented and 
the amount of time spent on them are based on subjective decisions. 
</P>
<P>
He was surprised to find that the coverage of Western hostages in the Middle 
East gets as much attention as Lithuania's bid for independence. And he is 
amazed at the amount of time devoted to the doings of African National Congress 
leader Nelson Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the West is a little bit ashamed about what's going on in South Africa," 
he surmises. 
</P>
<P>
Although the type of journalism practiced in Poland is a far cry from the kind 
the British and Americans pride themselves on, Bogdanski believes his country's 
system of news dissemination will be comparable soon. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we will have normal journalism sooner than anybody expected," he says. 
"By normal, I mean when journalists explain to the public what is going on 
without adding their opinions. Now we have some kind of semi-journalism."

'WOMEN'S WORK': NEW ROLE MODELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It sure is a man's world -- when it comes to performance art in Los Angeles. 
Even at Highways, where that venue's first year has been dominated by male 
performers -- until now. 
</P>
<P>
"Women's Work," a festival of dance and performance, opens tonight and runs 
through June 18. 
</P>
<P>
Festival organizers say that the event is not a deliberate attempt to counter 
Highways' first year of mostly male programming, but the festival could help 
re-establish Los Angeles as a center for feminist art -- a distinction held by 
the city's art community a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Fiorentino of Argentina, whose appearances are also part of Festival 
Latino LA, opens "Women's Work" with "Piedras y Huevos" ("Stones and Eggs"), 
tonight through Sunday. The festival features solo works over the next four 
weeks, including choreographers Nina Wise of San Francisco and Suchi Branfman 
of New York, and performers Linda Carmella Sibio and Meri Nana-Ama Danquah of 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
It is, admits Highways co-director Linda Frye Burnham, a change. "It just 
happened that we had a lot of gay male work in quick succession," she says of 
the venue's programming. 
</P>
<P>
"It happened because Tim (Miller, Highways co-director with Burnham) is an 
activist in that community and he's aware of what's being done." 
</P>
<P>
Not only are there "a lot of gay male performance artists in L.A." says 
Burnham, but "you get the richest programming out of the population that's 
doing the work." 
</P>
<P>
Says Danquah, a poet-dancer born in Ghana, "I think we're watching history. 
It's not just men, it's gay men and it's their time. It doesn't boil down to a 
battle of the sexes: they're fighting for their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Sibio is disgruntled. "There are a lot of women artists, but they're 
expected to work three times as hard before they get any attention," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"The art world is still totally dominated by men," Sibio continues. "A lot of 
focus is being given to minority artists, but in the art world, women are still 
minorities and that's been overlooked." 
</P>
<P>
While "Women's Work" is not, according to Burnham, intended to make up for that 
imbalance, she acknowledges that she and Miller "instinctively wanted to look 
elsewhere for a while." 
</P>
<P>
That is easier said than done, though. "We're most interested in local work," 
says Burnham. "But we're just not getting approached by that many women." 
</P>
<P>
Which is a particularly odd state of affairs, given that Los Angeles was the 
center of feminist art in the late '70s -- a development that drew Burnham here 
in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a housewife in Orange County," she confesses. "I came to the art world 
because of feminist performance art. 
</P>
<P>
"There was this huge burst of (feminist) work going on and the Women's Building 
was being established." 
</P>
<P>
It was eye-opening for Burnham, who went on to found High Performance magazine. 
"The reason that all this seemed important was that I was discovering who I was 
and this work was addressing that directly," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately though, that level of activity lasted only a short while. "I 
don't know what happened to feminism," says Burnham. "The performance artists 
went through this horrible, wrenching change in the early '80s where suddenly 
the spotlight discovered performance art and people threw themselves into 
projects that were way too big." 
</P>
<P>
"The press didn't understand what they were doing and the artists ended up 
going way into debt," Burnham recalls. "The whole experience seemed to be 
pretty damaging and a lot of those women lost interest in performance." 
</P>
<P>
The list of ex-L.A. performers reads like a Who's Who of feminist art. "Terry 
Wolverton was the director of the Women's Building and now she calls herself a 
'recovering performance artist.' Cheri Gaulke and Nancy Buchanan have turned to 
video. 
</P>
<P>
"Suzanne Lacy had to leave town to seek better funding for her large-scale 
work. Leslie Labowitz had been literally in the street fighting sexism and 
violence and she got completely burned out on activist work and became a sprout 
farmer." 
</P>
<P>
Partly because of these losses, Burnham feels things may never be the same. 
"When the scene fragments with everybody leaving town, it robs the community of 
energy," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a point in the '70s where young women were dropping everything and 
coming to L.A. to study feminist work. Those women that came here then are 
still around, but the younger women aren't coming." 
</P>
<P>
The young men, however, are having a field day. "People who came to Highways as 
volunteers when we first opened a year ago are now starting to write their 
first performance pieces -- because of the examples they have," says Burnham. 
</P>
<P>
"People like Tim (Miller), John Goss, John Fleck, Alan Pulner are role models. 
You have role models and a scene develops. In New York you have the WOW Cafe, 
Holly Hughes and Split Britches. But we just don't have any strong feminist 
role models here right now. All the feminists I know are really tired."

HAZY 'SKYLINE' AT ODYSSEY;

<P>
DRAMA: THE INTENT OF THIS SAGA OF JOE HILL IS UNCLEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joe Hill must have been more stageworthy than he seems in Thomas Babe's "Salt 
Lake City Skyline," at the Odyssey. 
</P>
<P>
The legendary labor organizer and songwriter was executed by a Utah firing 
squad in 1915, convicted of the murder of a Salt Lake City grocer and his son. 
The evidence was flimsy -- primarily consisting of an unexplained gunshot wound 
to Hill on the same night as the murder. 
</P>
<P>
Hill refused to say what happened to him that night. According to Babe's 
account, a jealous husband found Hill in bed with his high-toned wife and fired 
away. 
</P>
<P>
So far, so interesting. But we don't see the husband or the incident. The play 
is set almost completely inside the courtroom, structured around Hill's trial 
in the first act, and his sentencing and execution in the second act. 
</P>
<P>
In between the trial scenes, we see Hill talking with the lady in question and 
her son -- a devoted Hill groupie. Not much is done, in the script or with Bob 
Heller's lights or any other way, to indicate where these conversations take 
place -- in the imagination, the courtroom (which would seem impossible), the 
prison, wherever. These scenes fit awkwardly into the rest of the play. 
</P>
<P>
The lady offers to testify on Hill's behalf, but Hill refuses. He'd rather be a 
gentleman and a martyr. One of his old cohorts from the Wobblies visits him and 
points out the value of martyrdom. Hill has a few doubts, but he doesn't let 
them come between him and the firing squad. 
</P>
<P>
"Salt Lake" isn't supposed to be realistic, but neither does it take off into 
engaging fantasy. At first, the action is interrupted by jaunty choruses of 
labor ditties, sung and semi-danced by everyone on stage -- including judge, 
jury, prosecutor, as well as Hill. But this technique is used less and less -- 
until finally we wonder what was the point of doing it at all. 
</P>
<P>
You could say the same for the entire play. Despite a glory-hallelujah ending, 
this is not an inspirational ode to Hill and his cause. A few slides at the 
beginning depict turn-of-the-century poverty, and later Hill (acting as his own 
attorney) effectively questions a mine manager about his exploitation of the 
workers, but otherwise the social context is given short shrift. For a play 
that's named after a city, it's odd that we don't get any feeling of place, or 
of why Hill was in Salt Lake City in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe this is supposed to be a psychological study? Yet, details about Hill's 
past are sparse. The trial itself would be much more urgent if we could break 
out of the courtroom to scenes from Hill's life -- as an immigrant, as a 
worker, as an agitator, even as a clandestine lover. 
</P>
<P>
As Hill, John Diehl wears a little grin that comes off as smug more than 
charming. There are occasional sexual sparks between him and Callan White, as 
his mysterious lover. F. William Parker delivers a few wry moments as the 
terminally ill judge. J. Michael Alexander's musical direction adds mild 
flavoring. 
</P>
<P>
Directed by Frank Condon, "Salt Lake City Skyline" is more reminiscent of his 
earlier Odyssey stagings -- historical inquisitions like "Chicago Conspiracy 
Trial" and "McCarthy" than of the previous work of playwright Thomas Babe 
("Demon Wine," "Fathers and Sons," "A Prayer for My Daughter"). But it doesn't 
have the edge of most of Condon's productions.

COMMUNITY PROFILE / ELFIN FOREST: NO MADDING CROWD -- YET;

<P>
On Harmony Grove Road in Escondido, past the cows lounging languidly in open 
meadows, and beyond the rock quarries, lies a tiny community called Elfin 
Forest. Yosemite it's not, but, with the squirrels darting across the road, the 
coastal chaparral ground cover and the patches of tall skinny trees covering 
the rolling hillside, Elfin Forest is aptly named. 
</P>
<P>
A quick blink of the eye and the rural community could easily be bypassed on 
the narrow road that also leads to the San Marcos landfill. But, within its 12 
square miles -- situated west of Escondido, east of Carlsbad, north of Rancho 
Santa Fe and south of San Marcos -- Elfin Forest does have most of the usual 
trappings of civilized life, including a grocery store, a volunteer fire 
company, a spiritual retreat and, of course, the obligatory llama crossing. 
</P>
<P>
What Elfin Forest doesn't have could fill a book. There are no sidewalks, no 
traffic signals, no cable television, and, until last year, no regular San 
Diego newspaper delivery. The only thing that glaringly smacks of urban life is 
a pay telephone near the Elfin Forest Grocery, which bills itself as the 
smallest store in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The inhabitants of Elfin Forest -- mostly retired or moderate- to upper-income 
business people, doctors and lawyers who live on a minimum of 2.5 acres -- 
don't seem to mind. Their attitude towards the conveniences of urban life is 
succinctly expressed by their Town Council letterhead that reads, "Dedicated to 
a Continuing Rural Atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 500 citizens obey a tacit law to turn off all outdoor lights after 
11 p.m. This way, there is nothing to detract from the brilliant twinkle of the 
stars against a black midnight sky. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the few places where you can still see the stars without going to 
the deserts or the mountains," said Bill Barker, the 54-year-old fire chief for 
the Elfin Forest-Harmony Grove Volunteer Fire Co. 
</P>
<P>
Crime is practically non-existent in this community. A rash of daytime 
burglaries a couple years ago prompted the citizens of Elfin Forest to 
reinstitute a Neighborhood Watch program, and it has been working well ever 
since, Barker said. 
</P>
<P>
The rural serenity is ideal for the Questhaven Retreat, a nondenominational 
spiritual retreat that occupies 640 acres in the northern valley of Elfin 
Forest. Each year, hundreds of visitors from around the world come to 
Questhaven to commune with nature and study the teachings of the Rev. Flower 
Newhouse, which deal with the angelic kingdom and the role of angels in human 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Newhouse founded Questhaven in 1940 when she bought the land and is still 
director of the retreat. Christward Ministry, a nondenominational group, now 
owns Questhaven and holds services for the locals every Sunday in a church on 
the property. 
</P>
<P>
Another important community institution is the Elfin Forest-Harmony Grove 
Volunteer Fire Co. Formed in 1972, it now has 28 volunteer firefighters who 
wear beepers and are on call 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Barker said 14 fires in 1989 blackened more than 2,000 acres of Elfin 
Forest. The fire risk in is exceptionally high because of the number of trees 
and the dense coastal chaparral everywhere, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The community's history starts with Elfin Forest Vacation Ranch. Now a mobile 
home park for 62 people, the ranch once was a park owned by San Diego dentist 
Harvey Urban, who in 1958 charged people $2 a night to camp there. He also 
dammed Escondido Creek to create Elfin Forest Lake, which was destroyed in 1979 
by heavy rains. 
</P>
<P>
Originally called Tooth Acres, after Urban's profession, the camp derived its 
present name from the 1923 book by Francis Marion Fultz titled, "The Elfin 
Forest of California." In the book on Southern California flora and fauna, 
Fultz described many backcountry areas as appearing to be an "elfin forest." 
</P>
<P>
Urban's children adopted the name for the campgrounds, and soon after, the 
whole community followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
But the area's residents now are fighting to make sure the name remains 
descriptive of their town. There is a constant battle to keep the nearby San 
Marcos landfill from expanding, and now residents are fighting annexation by 
the city of San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
The citizens of Elfin Forest have to be political or get mowed down, said Nona 
Barker, an Elfin Forest resident and owner of Llama Luggage, a business that 
designs backpacks and outdoor gear for the animals. 
</P>
<P>
There is a sign posted on a road in front of Barker's three-acre property that 
proclaims, "Llama Crossing." It calls attention to the seven llamas Barker owns 
that sometimes cross the road on their way to a community parade at Elfin 
Forest Vacation Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Barker (no relation to Bill, the fire chief) believes that the residents are 
going to have to prepare for even harder battles than the landfill expansion or 
the trash-to-energy plant. 
</P>
<P>
"We just got a letter in the mail from the city of San Marcos saying they want 
to annex into Elfin Forest," Barker said. "Ninety percent of us don't want to 
be annexed, we like being part of the county, but they don't care." 
</P>
<P>
Monthly Town Council meetings at the fire station are always well attended and 
often heated, especially when the topic is proposed housing developments or a 
trash incineration plant, said Patricia Mack Newton.

<P>
PALA NUN DARES HER STUDENTS TO DREAM; 
</P>
<P>
SHE KNOWS HERSELF IT CHANGES LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
She was an Indian girl, growing up on the Pala reservation in North County, a 
lanky teen-ager who was like brown lightning on the soccer field, a budding 
Pele in a pair of old shorts. She was just that graceful. 
</P>
<P>
The classroom was a different game altogether -- a place where she sometimes 
struggled with even simple concepts. But to her, it didn't matter. Book 
knowledge, she said, was a tool for the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
She was an Indian. There was no need to leave the reservation. She'd get a job 
as a grocery store checker, just like others had done before her. She would get 
by. 
</P>
<P>
Well, that may have been good enough for the girl, still a student at the 
school, but not for Sister Mary Yarger. The principal of the Mission San 
Antonio de Pala school has seen too many such youngsters blinded to their 
potential. And she knows the reason why. 
</P>
<P>
Yarger herself is a Luiseno Indian who grew up on the Pala reservation and 
attended the same mission school for children between kindergarten and the 
eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
For Yarger, who last fall became principal of what officials call the last 
missionary-run Indian school in California, helping students realize their 
dreams is a daily passion. 
</P>
<P>
She not only knows the culture, she knows the people -- the mothers and fathers 
and grandparents -- and she knows them by their first names. Much of her family 
still lives on the reservation, which is on California 76, about 6 miles east 
of Interstate 15. 
</P>
<P>
She also knows what it meant to her to have parents who encouraged her to get 
an education, go to college, see what the world beyond the reservation had to 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw what this girl was trying to do -- she would just sit there in school 
and say, 'I don't have to do anything in life,' " said the 40-year-old nun, a 
member of the Sisters of the Precious Blood order. "And I wasn't going to allow 
that." 
</P>
<P>
So Yarger engaged the student in frequent after-school talks. And she made 
regular visits to counsel the elderly grandmother who was raising the girl -- 
conversations that focused not only on the importance of being Indian, but on 
opening a child's eyes to new opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Now, while the girl still struggles with her class work, her goal is to finish 
high school. It's a good start, Yarger says -- the rest will come later. 
</P>
<P>
"We got her to believe that she could do something," she said. "We got her to 
admit that she had dreams." 
</P>
<P>
Yarger doesn't understand why the next famous astronomer, astronaut or highly 
regarded physician can't be a child from the mission school. Indians, she says, 
don't always have to become secretaries or general construction workers. 
</P>
<P>
This from a woman who left the reservation to earn a bachelor's degree in 
education and a master's in physical education, who saw the outside world and 
decided to return home to help her people, an Indian who knows her roots. 
</P>
<P>
In a world where minority students often fail to reinvest in their culture, 
Yarger has given an entire career to her people. 
</P>
<P>
After years of teaching science in other Catholic schools, she returned to the 
Pala school three years ago to help begin an athletic program there. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, she became the second Indian to ever run the 33-year-old school, a 
group of adobe and red-tile roof buildings that are part of the 174-year-old 
Mission San Antonio de Pala. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, her life has become a focused struggle not only to help keep the 
school financially afloat but to help teach Indian children the meaning of 
being Indian, salvaging the frayed threads of their culture that she says have 
been neglected for more than a generation. 
</P>
<P>
Her message to students is simple: You'll never know what you can become until 
you try. And if you believe in who you are, you can achieve anything you want, 
no matter who tells you it's not worthwhile. But success comes hard, she tells 
her students; you've got to work for it. 
</P>
<P>
To the boy who wants to become a professional football player, she explains 
that he must go to college. And to get to college, he must first finish high 
school. To do that, she warns, he must keep his grades up. 
</P>
<P>
To the sixth-grader who wants to be an astronomer, she advises that looking up 
into the sky isn't enough -- he must take math and science courses. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something he never thought of," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Too many young people become too comfortable on the reservation," she says. 
"It's a very closed society with uncles and aunts and grandparents living 
sometimes a few houses away. It's very easy for children to just dig in. 
</P>
<P>
"My job is to teach kids not to just look and see where their parents have gone 
with their lives but to explore the opportunities of a new generation -- things 
their parents never even thought about." 
</P>
<P>
Yarger is one of a new generation of mentors for Indian children, educators 
say. She is someone who is trying to come to grips with problems that still 
plague many of the about 4,000 Native Americans living in North County on any 
one of eight reservations -- the Pala, Rincon, La Jolla, San Pasqual, Pauma, 
Mesa Grande, Los Coyotes and Santa Ysabel. 
</P>
<P>
"She is proof that the Indian experience has come full circle," said Sister 
Eucharista Marie Mitchell, pastoral minister for the mission. "She's a role 
model. She has a personal touch that forms a bond with these children an 
outsider could never quite achieve." 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Dixon, a Luiseno Indian who attended grade school with Yarger and is 
now chairwoman of the American Indian Studies department at Palomar College, 
says Yarger provides just the dose of reality that many schoolchildren need. 
</P>
<P>
"She can see through the smoke screen kids throw at you, saying 'I'm just an 
Indian, I don't know.' She can tell them 'Hey, remember, I grew up here, too. I 
lived three doors down from your father.' " 
</P>
<P>
For Yarger and a handful of other nuns who run the mission school, the job 
isn't just motivating students, but trying to keep the nine classrooms open for 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the cost of educating each student was about $1,800. Since annual 
tuition is only $600, the sisters must find other ways to find money not only 
to buy books, but maintain an athletic program, fill the gopher holes that 
riddle the football field and keep the termites from eating through the wooden 
beams that arch over each classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the girls at the school -- which has an enrollment of 167 students -- 
still wear the same hand-me-down green-plaid uniforms Yarger and others wore in 
the 1950s. There is no money to buy new ones, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Being an Indian principal of this school is both good and bad," she said. 
"Sure, I have an insider's view of the problems here, but even with knowing 
people so closely, there's only so many times I can go back to the well, asking 
them for money for the school." 
</P>
<P>
The school doesn't require needy families to pay the tuition each year; they 
give what they can. The lack of funds has put the mission school administrators 
in some dire monetary straits. 
</P>
<P>
The school has sponsored several fund-raising efforts, including a million-coin 
drive to buy a new school bus and hire an additional driver. One of the mission 
school's two buses is a 17-year-old vehicle that the school purchased with 
Green Stamps. 
</P>
<P>
Students have circulated jars around the reservation, asking for donations and 
some have given their own change. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not prejudiced, I'll take pennies," Yarger said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the children have collected 19,000 coins. "That's only 2% of a million 
but don't tell the kids," she said. "They think we're doing great." 
</P>
<P>
Even a million pennies, she acknowledges, would only be $10,000. "Frankly, I 
don't even know what a new bus would cost. I'm afraid to look. But I'm sure 
that $10,000 wouldn't buy much these days." 
</P>
<P>
But things have come a long way since Yarger returned to the school in 1986 to 
begin building an athletic program. Back then, there were only a few team 
sports and the only event the school competed in regularly was an annual track 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
She started several programs, including football and soccer teams, as well as 
boys' and girls' basketball. Since most of the parents had to leave the 
reservation to find work, transportation to and from games was a major problem. 
</P>
<P>
So Yarger borrowed an old van from a friend. She even coached many of the teams 
-- until her energy inspired others in the community to come forward to help. 
</P>
<P>
"One night, this older man who was home from his job on medical leave, came to 
one of our girls' soccer games," she recalled. "We were getting beat but good. 
He just stood there laughing. 
</P>
<P>
"The next night, he came to a girls' basketball game and laughed some more. I 
told him 'Okay, if you know how to coach so well, you coach.' " The man soon 
began helping out with several teams, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as principal, Yarger has other worries. One of her chief responsibilities 
is making sure students get enough encouragement and guidance, not only at 
school, but at home. 
</P>
<P>
To do that, she visits them at their houses, trying to find out which person -- 
whether it is the mother, father, an uncle or grandfather -- can serve as their 
mentor and encourage them to keep up with their work. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to find out who in their family is going to do them the most good," she 
said, "and it's usually a different member from each family. But grandparents 
are usually the best. Around the reservation, there's still a lot of respect 
for grandparents." 
</P>
<P>
Yarger says that grandparents often have the most tangible connection with 
their fleeting Indian culture. 
</P>
<P>
"During World War II, everyone wanted to be known as an American and nothing 
else," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the Indian culture was lost as young people fled the reservation. 
They were foot-loose and fancy-free and didn't want to learn. Now they're older 
and many have come back to find they don't have any culture left -- for them or 
their kids." 
</P>
<P>
Yarger herself is an example of that lost Indian generation. She cannot speak 
her native Luiseno language and has lost many of the other customs. She knows 
part of the Indian culture within her has died. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't brought up within the Indian tradition," she said. "My father was an 
Indian and he was proud of that. What I carry with me are the strong feelings 
that were passed down through my father's family, that's what I hold dear." 
</P>
<P>
Now her job, she says, is to pass that pride on to her students. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of kids know they're Indian but they don't know what that means," she 
said. "Teachers have asked kids 'What kind of Indian are you?' and they'll 
respond 'I don't know, I'm Indian.' Well, that just won't do." 
</P>
<P>
The middle school, with more than 65% of its students Indians, tries to give 
students a clear picture of their Indian identities before they become lost in 
the larger high school scene in nearby Fallbrook or Temecula. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to understand the way the American Indian does things, the way its 
young people think," she said. "We know that the Indian isn't a competitive 
person so we take a lot of that stressful competition out of the classroom 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, we never pit the boys against the girls. We want kids to achieve 
their personal best and not feel like they have to beat everyone else in the 
classroom." 
</P>
<P>
While there is much literature on certain Indian tribes such as the Apache and 
Navajo, little published research exists on most of the tribes that inhabit the 
Pala reservation in North County and others like it -- groups such as the 
Lupeno, Diegueno, Pomo and Modoc. 
</P>
<P>
So Yarger plans to invite several reservation veterans into the classroom to 
speak about their culture not only to the students, but to the staff of 10 
non-Indian teachers as well.

MILITARY RODEO LURES RIDERS OF DIFFERENT STRIPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dan Montano knows the feel of a bull's hoofs on his back, the sharp jab of a 
bull's horn under his chin. 
</P>
<P>
He knows these things, but still he wants to ride the bulls. 
</P>
<P>
Why would anyone want to straddle 2,000 pounds of bucking, snorting, 
uncontained fury, only to be tossed around like a rag doll and dumped in the 
dirt. 
</P>
<P>
Montano, a stable foreman at Camp Pendleton and a professional rodeo rider, 
understands the lure of the rodeo. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a challenge every time you get on the bull," Montano said. "I want to 
prove myself. 
</P>
<P>
"You're out there in the middle of the arena, with all of these people 
cheering. It makes you feel great." 
</P>
<P>
That feeling is what draws cowboys -- both the authentic and the urban variety 
-- to the Camp Pendleton Rodeo, which takes place at the Marine Corps base June 
1-3. 
</P>
<P>
Now in its 43rd year, the Camp Pendleton Rodeo is the oldest and largest 
military rodeo, attracting more than 130 contestants from all branches of the 
armed services, stationed around the world. Any active military personnel, 
retirees or their dependents can enter. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have the bravado to get up there, you can ride. And Marines have a lot 
of bravado," said Paul Jones, spokesman for Camp Pendleton's morale, welfare 
and recreation division. 
</P>
<P>
Jody Huston, a gunnery sergeant with the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San 
Diego, has the bravado. He's the all-around champion of last year's Camp 
Pendleton Rodeo, and he's been in constant training to defend the title. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been riding rodeos since I was 15," he says. 
</P>
<P>
A third-generation cowboy raised on a ranch in Montana, Huston spends almost 
every weekend riding in rodeos around the country. During the week, he runs 20 
miles, works out at a gym and practices aerobics to maintain the strength to 
ride. For him, the rodeo holds a fatal attraction. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a combination of fear, or caution, and the drive to achieve a goal. And 
that goal is to master the animal," he said. "It's like being on the edge. As 
soon as that animal busts out of the chute, your subconscious takes over. I 
find it's best if I just react to the animal and not think about what I'm 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing rational about the call of the rodeo. Last October, during the 
Military World Finals Rodeo in San Antonio, Tex., a bull threw Huston and 
kicked him in the face, requiring 26 stitches above his right eye. He got out 
of the hospital at 2 a.m., and by morning a bandaged Huston was back in the 
arena. He went on to become the all-around military world champion. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the ultimate rush," Huston says. "You're putting your life on the 
line." 
</P>
<P>
Rodeo rules are simple. 
</P>
<P>
One week before the event, cowboys sign up for their choice of "rough stock," 
either bucking horses or bulls. They enter a drawing to see which particular 
animal they'll ride. 
</P>
<P>
Once they climb onto their bull or horse and nod toward the officials, the 
contest begins. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to stay on the animal eight seconds. That can be a lifetime," said 
Joe Curley, recreation director for base's morale, welfare and recreation 
division. 
</P>
<P>
During those tumultuous eight seconds, the cowboys are judged on how well they 
ride. The riders can use only one hand to hold onto the animal. If their free 
hand touches the horse or bull, they're out. 
</P>
<P>
With the first jump out of the chute, those riding the bucking horses must 
"cover the horse" by placing their boots toward the front part of the animal or 
they are disqualified. A good rider will put his feet up front after every 
buck, Curley says. Putting the feet toward the back allows the rider to feel 
more of the horse's movements, making it easier to stay on. 
</P>
<P>
Bull riders just have to hang on, but they don't have it any easier. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just being whipped," Curley says. "The smallest bulls weigh about 
1,500 pounds, and they get all four feet off the ground. They're amazingly 
agile animals. They can twist and turn in all directions." 
</P>
<P>
Judges also score the animal on how well it bucks. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's a good bull, it will buck real hard and spin," Montano says. "You 
don't have time to think, you just react." 
</P>
<P>
A cowboy and his animal can score up to 50 points each. Whoever has the best 
combined score of a possible 100 points wins. 
</P>
<P>
"Some guys are real good riders. Some have seen it on TV and want to try it 
out," says Montano, who has ridden in the Pendleton rodeo twice. "It's more 
balance than strength. You have to go with the flow of the bull." 
</P>
<P>
Champions in each category -- bull, saddle bronc (horse with a saddle) and 
bareback -- receive a cash award of as much as $2,000, depending on the number 
of entries. Entry fees are $45 each. 
</P>
<P>
"All you have to do is stay on, and you can make money," Montano says. 
</P>
<P>
Getting off the animal is tougher. Once the eight seconds are up, a horn sounds 
and the cowboy can bail out. If he's riding a bull, he's usually thrown off. 
</P>
<P>
"It blows my mind. The cowboy gets thrown and you think he's dead," Curley 
says. "But he just jumps up and brushes off the dust. How they do it, I don't 
know." 
</P>
<P>
A rodeo clown distracts the bull while the cowboy picks himself up off the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of cowboys who get thrown might be dazed or a little slow getting up," 
Curley said. "The clown will save the cowboy if he gets in trouble. He does 
what he can to get the bull away from the cowboy." 
</P>
<P>
If the cowboy rides a horse, he sometimes has the luxury of waiting for a 
pickup man to ride up by his side so he can jump from his bucking animal to the 
other horse. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been injuries," Curley said. "We've had everything from twisted 
backs to broken arms. It is a dangerous sport." 
</P>
<P>
Montano knows of the danger firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
"I was riding a bull in a rodeo in Compton and got hooked on the chin. The bull 
threw his head back. It felt like someone had punched me. He chipped a couple 
of my teeth. 
</P>
<P>
"At another rodeo in Lakeside, a bull walked on my back." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Montano wants to join the professional rodeo circuit and work full time 
riding the bulls. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're good enough, you don't have to work other jobs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He knows that, if he hangs on to the animal long enough, he'll get the prize, 
although to date, he has made only about $1,000 from riding. A good rodeo 
rider, he says, can work the rodeos until he's 30. Montano is 23. 
</P>
<P>
He rode his first bull at age 17. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time you get on a bull, you either hate it or love it. I love it. 
It's not just the money -- it's the rodeo life," he said. "You can travel to 
different places and meet different people. 
</P>
<P>
"It's life on the edge." 
</P>
<P>
Camp Pendleton held its first rodeo in 1948, but the event on the site has its 
origins in the Spanish dons and ranchos that once dotted the land. 
</P>
<P>
Huge herds of cattle wandered the hills of what was then called Rancho Santa 
Margarita y Las Flores, a 200,000-acre ranch owned and operated by an 
Englishman named John Forster from 1864 to 1882. Forster had paid off the 
gambling debts of the former owner, Pio Pico, in return for the deed to the 
ranch.

In the spring, rodeos were held to sort the cattle and brand the calves. The 
area remained a working ranch until 1942, when it was transformed into a Marine 
Corps base. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of Marines are cowboys. Many come from Wyoming, Montana and Colorado, 
and they've been involved in rodeo since childhood," Jones says. 
</P>
<P>
But the rodeo does not attract people the way it did during the '60s, when a 
single event would attract major television stars such as Andy Griffith and Jim 
Nabors. 
</P>
<P>
"There used to be a lot more government money available. Back then, the rodeo 
was free," Jones says. "The Pendleton rodeo is still well known, but attendance 
has dropped. We're trying to get it back to the way it had been." 
</P>
<P>
Organizers worry that the rodeo, where cowboys like Montano can prove 
themselves in the ring, will vanish the way of sprawling ranchos and open 
space. 
</P>
<P>
"With the big influx of people, the farmlands are now all homes. I wonder how 
many cowboys can have that rodeo lifestyle," Curley says. "It's a piece of 
America we're slowly but surely doing away with here." 
</P>

EXHIBIT SHOWS MERGER OF FINE AND FUNCTIONAL ART FORMS 
</P>

<P>
"Better living through art" went the rallying cry of the Arts and Crafts 
Movement in turn-of-the-century England and the United States. The Industrial 
Age had arrived, and the craftsman, once a free agent with taste and skill, had 
been reduced to a "machine without will." 
</P>
<P>
Quality and individuality had vanished from the work process. Adherents of the 
Arts and Crafts Movement lamented the change, mingling morals with aesthetics 
in their campaign to revive the value of hand-crafted products. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not pleading for the production of a little more beauty in the world," 
William Morris, artist and leader of the British Arts and Crafts Movement, told 
an audience in 1901. "It is the lives of human beings that I am pleading for . 
. . the reasons for living." 
</P>
<P>
A home furnished with objects of beauty, hand-tooled with pride, answered human 
needs, Morris and others reasoned. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Freeland, a Rancho Santa Fe resident, couldn't agree more. His 
collection of lamps, vases, dishes and other domestic accessories fashioned of 
glass during the Arts and Crafts era makes up part of the current exhibition, 
"Tiffany, Steuben, Music Boxes, Circa 1900," presented by the Felicita 
Foundation for the Arts at the Mathes Cultural Center in Escondido (247 S. 
Kalmia). 
</P>
<P>
"These are practical pieces, and are used on a daily basis," Freeland said. 
"But, when you look at them, you'll smile. Your breath will be taken away." 
</P>
<P>
The "vibrant joy of living" Freeland experiences when surrounded by his 
collection is exactly what proponents of the Arts and Crafts Movement had in 
mind when they urged a merging of the fine and functional arts. From furniture, 
rugs, lighting fixtures, vases and bowls to the houses containing them, 
products of the Arts and Crafts Movement elevated practical objects to the 
level of art and, at the same time, brought art down to an accessible, human 
scale. 
</P>
<P>
The stark installation of the current show does little to evoke the objects' 
intended domestic setting, but the work dazzles in any context. Vases, bowls 
and candlestick holders by both Steuben Glass Works and Tiffany Studios tend 
toward opulent textures and simple forms. Steuben's "Futuristic" candlestick 
holders, for instance, are of a basic, elegant design; their iridescent blue 
sheen, however, lifts them into the realm of the sublime. 
</P>
<P>
Lamps designed by Lewis Comfort Tiffany adopt organic motifs. Both shade and 
sinuous, vine-draped base assume a plant-like fluidity and grace in the "Pansy 
Lamp," while the "Three Light Lily Lamps" suggest the limpid beauty of 
drooping, downward-turned blossoms. 
</P>
<P>
Nature inspired the artisans of the Arts and Crafts Movement on both sides of 
the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
"All most lovely forms and thoughts are directly taken from natural objects," 
wrote John Ruskin, British champion of the movement. Later in the same essay, 
he asked, "Must not beauty, then, be sought for in the form which we associate 
with our everyday life?" 
</P>
<P>
The stylized curves of European Art Nouveau designs and Oriental art's 
abstraction of organic forms were also highly influential on 
turn-of-the-century arts and crafts. Freeland's collection of art glass 
evolved, somewhat haphazardly, as he tells it, from his initial interest in 
Oriental art. Intrigued by the cloisonne and china his mother had purchased on 
a far eastern trip in her youth, he began to acquire related works of his own 
in the 1960s. When he ran out of room on the floor and walls, he turned to 
glass, starting his collection with a small, gold-lustered Steuben dish. 
</P>
<P>
The late John D. Lyon of Los Angeles began purchasing music boxes as early as 
1953, but stopped only 10 years later because of their dramatic increase in 
price. His collection now resides with his brother in Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
As docents wind and operate the eight cylinder music boxes here, dating roughly 
from 1850 to 1890, rich, harmonic sound fills the spare gallery space. Most of 
these early home entertainment systems are large, and encased in decorative, 
inlaid wood boxes, but one can be held in the palm of the hand. 
</P>
<P>
The "Oval Clock Enameled Porcelain Silver Gilt Bird Box" opens with the slide 
of a small lever, revealing a miniature bird whose moving beak emits a 
convincing, melodic song. Names of several other boxes, such as the "Ideal 
Sublime Harmonie Piccolo," prove as amusing as the instruments themselves.

RAID SHOWS SERIOUSNESS OF PARTS PROBE AT NORTHROP; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: FEDERAL AGENTS SEIZED PARTS RIGHT OFF THE F/A-18 ASSEMBLY LINE. BUT 
THE NAVY SAYS THE PLANES ARE SAFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a squad of federal agents stormed the Northrop F/A-18 plant in El Segundo 
on Tuesday, they went straight for the assembly line, removing allegedly 
defective parts from the jet fighters while the planes were being produced. 
</P>
<P>
The extraordinary raid -- possibly the first time that law enforcement officers 
have confiscated evidence directly from an aircraft production line -- 
reflected the seriousness of the allegations that the F/A-18s contained flawed 
components. 
</P>
<P>
The critical parts in question include metal and plastic tubing in the 
aircraft's hydraulic, fuel and pressurization systems, according to sources 
close to the investigation. The tubing allegedly failed to meet strict military 
specifications, though Navy officials said Wednesday that they do not believe 
existing F/A-18s are unsafe to fly. 
</P>
<P>
The tubing is supposed to be precisely formed and shaped, but the tubes 
supplied to the F/A-18 line often failed to fit, investigators said. In some 
cases, the tubing was bent or otherwise forced into position, leading to 
concern that it might not withstand internal pressures during operation. 
</P>
<P>
"The Naval Air Systems Command has made a thorough review of the system and has 
determined there is no safety-of-flight issue," insisted Navy spokesman Lt. 
Dave Wray. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the hydraulic system, which operates at the highest pressures of 
the three systems, has two backup systems in the event of failure. Northrop 
formed and installed the backup tubing as well, but officials said it is 
unlikely that all three could fail. 
</P>
<P>
"Our big concern is whether this tubing is going to hold when a pilot pulls a 
big left-hand turn" at five times the force of gravity, said a federal agent 
who asked not to be named. "If all three systems fail, God doesn't want you to 
live anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Navy officials were continuing to study the matter. So far, the 
F/A-18s in the Navy fleet are being flown as usual, Wray said. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop is continuing normal production, said company spokesman Tony Cantafio. 
Another spokesman, Ron Owens, said the company is not commenting beyond an 
earlier statement that it is "working with the government to understand the 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
Northrop produces the aft and center fuselage sections of the F/A-18, 
representing about 40% of the content of the aircraft. McDonnell Douglas 
assembles the aircraft in St. Louis. Last year, Northrop delivered 101 F/A-18 
fuselages, and plans to deliver 94 this year. It is the company's largest 
program after the B-2 Stealth bomber. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations were originally made by Northrop employees, who have filed a 
case under the federal False Claims Act, which allows individuals to sue on 
behalf of the government and share in any damages. The individuals are 
represented by Claremont attorney Herbert Hafif, who said he could not identify 
them "in order to preclude the threat of retaliation." 
</P>
<P>
An internal "fact paper" from the Naval Investigative Command said the probe 
"concerns allegations of product substitution, false certifications and 
possible cost mischarging." 
</P>
<P>
"Product substitution" refers to allegedly defective tubing. "False 
certifications" refers to whether Northrop tried to cover up the tubing 
problems with falsified testing and improper certifications to the government. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the certification process is faulty for meeting mil specs (military 
specifications)," the source said. "Our argument is, they ran the tubing 
through, it didn't meet the specs, so they fudged with the computer to show 
that it met them." 
</P>
<P>
The "possible cost mischarging" allegation is based on the supposition that if 
Northrop supplied defective parts, then the government did not get what it paid 
for and was overcharged as a result. 
</P>
<P>
Federal agents reported that Northrop officials had not been cooperative with 
the investigators, but Cantafio rebutted that assertion. 
</P>
<P>
The federal agents complained that Northrop officials brought a team of company 
lawyers to each plant and ordered employees not to talk to the federal agents 
and refused to allow employees to assist the agents in selecting the right 
documents and computer material. 
</P>
<P>
"They basically said, 'You boys figure it out,' " according to the source. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the agents are reported to have seized a huge amount of 
documentation and computer tapes, since they were not sure exactly what they 
were looking for. Rather than select documents from a drawer, they simply took 
the entire drawer. 
</P>
<P>
But Cantafio said that calling in lawyers hardly represents a non-cooperative 
response. "If you got a search warrant, what is the first thing you would do? 
You'd call your lawyer," he said.

WHY S&amp;L PIT GETS DEEPER; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: THE BAILOUT COST KEEPS RISING BECAUSE OF A SOFT REAL ESTATE MARKET, 
MORE BAD LOANS THAN ANYONE REALIZED AND, SIMPLY, THE WAY THE FIGURES ARE 
CALCULATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Why are estimates of the taxpayers' cost to mop up the nation's savings and 
loan mess still rising at an alarming rate? 
</P>
<P>
The simple answer is that the thrift industry is in much worse shape than 
anyone thought last August when President Bush signed the S&amp;L bailout bill. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a patient walking into a hospital who looks sick. Until you get him 
under the CAT scanner, you don't know that he's dying," Deputy Treasury 
Secretary John E. Robson said at a thrift seminar this week in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Some thrifts, such as Great American Bank in San Diego and Columbia Savings 
&amp; Loan in Beverly Hills, appeared to be survivors last year. But those 
seemingly healthy thrifts have since suffered massive losses stemming from 
troubled real estate loans in the case of Great American, or huge junk bond 
losses in the case of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
Now both are in danger of being taken over by regulators. Indeed, some 200 or 
more institutions nationwide that no one figured last year to fail may have to 
be taken over. Worse-than-expected real estate conditions are one reason; 
another is new federal capital standards -- requiring financial resources to 
cushion against losses -- that many of these thrifts will be unable to meet. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, troubled institutions are a bigger mess than anyone thought. 
Regulators have made new discoveries of loans at thrifts that will never be 
paid back, or found that real estate they own isn't as valuable as previously 
thought. 
</P>
<P>
"It was such a deep hole that people couldn't see the bottom of it," said James 
Barth, an Auburn University professor and former chief economist with the 
federal Office of Thrift Supervision, which regulates thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
Interest among potential buyers of problem S&amp;Ls is waning, in part because 
there is a glut of thrifts for sale and generous tax benefits are no longer 
provided to buyers. And a severe softening in some real estate markets has made 
all of the problems much worse. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady acknowledged in Senate 
Banking Committee testimony that the Bush Administration badly underestimated 
the problem, saying that the cleanup costs could rise to between $90 billion 
and $130 billion in today's dollars, compared to $73 billion before. 
</P>
<P>
Brady's statements represent the first time the Administration's estimates 
approached those of private analysts and officials from the General Accounting 
Office. Several officials said they found it encouraging because the bitter 
debate over the bailout cost has tied up valuable time needed to move ahead in 
solving the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We are encouraged that they have got a number out there that looks relatively 
realistic," said Richard L. Fogel, assistant comptroller general in the General 
Accounting Office, an arm of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Brady's estimate does not include additional costs stemming from long-term 
commitments the government gave buyers of sick thrifts in 1988. Those 
transactions are being audited, and a better estimate of the costs is expected 
to be known later this year. 
</P>
<P>
So how much will it all cost? That depends on how you measure it. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, for example, Fogel shocked the nation when he testified that the 
cost could range from $325 billion to as much as $500 billion. Yet others have 
been saying $130 billion or so. 
</P>
<P>
The confusion can be explained because some estimates calculate the "present 
value" of the cost while others calculate the eventual cost of over 30 to 40 
years. It is about like comparing the purchase price of your home to the total 
you will pay in principal and interest over the life of your mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
The present-value cost, which experts estimate ranges from $90 billion to $160 
billion, reflects what it would cost the government to solve the problem by 
writing a check today to close the troubled thrifts and pay off depositors. 
</P>
<P>
The highest cost estimates, such as Fogel's $325 billion to $500 billion, are 
what it will cost over 30 to 40 years, taking into account the cost of 
borrowing and paying off the principal and interest. 
</P>
<P>
The best analogy is that a family borrowing $200,000 today to buy a home 
actually ends up paying back $600,000 in principal and interest over the life 
of the loan, assuming they have a 30-year mortgage at a 10% interest rate. 
Likewise, the government's bill of $90 billion to $160 billion will rise to 
between $325 billion and $500 billion because it is borrowing the money and 
taking 30 to 40 years to pay it off. 
</P>
<P>
WHAT THE S&amp;L CLEANUP ESTIMATES MEAN 
</P>
<P>
Type of Estimate: Amount. What it means 
</P>
<P>
Present value: $90 billion to $160 billion. The cost if the government had to 
write a check today to close troubled thrifts and pay off depositors. 
</P>
<P>
Cash estimate: $325 billion to $500 billion. The cost of borrowing to clean up 
the thriftmess and paying off the principal and interest over 30 to 40 years as 
the goverment plans to do. Higher estimate takes into account such developments 
as a recession and some unexpected thrift failures.

Memory Chip Glut Predicted: Japanese producers have been boosting production of 
DRAMs, or dynamic random-access memory chips, leading to a possible oversupply 
later this year rather than the shortage that had been widely anticipated, said 
analyst David Angel of the market research firm of Dataquest in San Jose. DRAMs 
are common silicon chips that are used widely in computers and cost about $7 to 
$8 apiece. Prices for 1-megabit DRAMs peaked in 1989 at about $17 during a 
worldwide shortage.

Florida May Target Fresh Fruit Market: The Florida Department of Citrus is 
considering spending $5.7 million on a national advertising campaign to 
persuade shoppers that Florida oranges are equal to their California 
counterparts. The advertising campaign in 1990 and 1991 would be aimed at 
cutting into the California navel orange market, which produces more than 75% 
of all fresh oranges eaten in the U.S. About 95% of Florida's oranges are 
squeezed into juice.

COKE GIVING TIPS ON TABS THAT DON'T WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA DARNELL WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Coca-Cola Co. learned once before when it came up with a bright idea for 
marketing, things don't always work exactly as planned. 
</P>
<P>
It recently put prizes -- including cash -- in some Coca-Cola Classic cans as a 
$100-million summer promotion for the brand, a name the company made up in 1985 
after a brief and disastrous marketing brainstorm to substitute the 
longstanding Coke formula for something new. However, in some instances, the 
prizes have failed to pop up as designed when customers pull the tab and some 
thirsty people have found themselves gulping down a mouth full of chlorinated 
water. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the Atlanta-based soft-drink giant found itself Wednesday explaining in 
full-page newspaper ads how the darn things are supposed to work. "As you may 
already know, any can of Coca-Cola Classic could be a MagiCan. Although 
MagiCans don't have Coca-Cola Classic in them, you can't tell them apart from 
the real cans. So we'd like to help you recognize a MagicCan when you find 
one," read the ad that appeared in 50 papers, including The Times. 
</P>
<P>
If it is a "MagiCan," the company said, the prize should pop up immediately 
when the customer pulls the tab. In a "small number of instances," the prize 
mechanism may jam, the ad said. "But by simply tapping the prize 'stem,' it 
should pop up," the ad said. If "something is jiggling inside the can, the 
prize mechanism has become detached," the ad said, although that is not 
supposed to happen. When it doubt, look in the can, the ad said. "If you see 
anything other than Coca-Cola Classic, it's a winner." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the cans contain a rolled up $1 bill, but they also have coupons for 
prizes, including one for a trip to the 1991 Super Bowl. Some have bills in 
denominations as high as $500, said Coke spokesman Randy Donaldson. The 
"MagiCans" contain chlorinated water so that they will be indistinguishable 
from cans filled with Coke. The water is not supposed to come out even if 
someone tries to drink it, but there have been leaks and other failures, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
The ad advised people not to try to drink from "MagiCans" -- although the water 
is harmless -- and included a toll-free number to report problems. 
</P>
<P>
"To put this in context, we've had a very small number of complaints. At the 
same time, people around the country have won about 60,000 prizes," Donaldson 
said. The Coca-Cola U.S.A. promotion, which ends Aug. 15, is "unique," he said. 
"It's never been done before," said a jovial Donaldson in apparent delight that 
a deluge of media attention would boost further the promotion.

PIC 'N' SAVE OFFERS NEW CONCESSIONS TO SUITOR; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: GIRARD PARTNERS REJECTS AN OFFER TO PICK TWO DIRECTORS FOR THE BOARD 
AND TWO MEMBERS FOR A BUYOUT COMMITTEE. 
</P>

Pic 'N' Save offered new concessions late Wednesday to Girard Partners, the 
investment group threatening to seize control of the retailing company. But 
Girard rejected the proposals and vowed to continue its fight. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez-based Pic 'N' Save announced that it set up a special committee of 
three outside directors to oversee its efforts to find a buyer. Pic 'N' Save 
also said it would let Girard add two members to that committee and two 
directors to the company's seven-member board if the investment group does not 
make a buyout offer. 
</P>
<P>
A Pic 'N' Save spokesman said the moves were prompted by questions Girard 
raised about the "sincerity" of the company's efforts to sell itself. Now, he 
said, "the company is saying, 'here's an opportunity to participate.' " 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the members of the special committee -- Bruce Karatz, David 
Amsterdam and John T. Gurash -- are top executives of companies with no ties 
with Pic 'N' Save who "have no incentive to do anything other than conduct a 
full and fair auction." 
</P>
<P>
Karatz is president and chief executive of Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Corp. 
Amsterdam is president of Amsted Corp. Gurash is chairman of CertainTeed Corp. 
and former chairman of INA Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Pic 'N' Save, as it has previously, sought to raise doubts about whether Girard 
genuinely wants to buy the company or if it simply wants to profit by launching 
a takeover fight. For its part, Girard continued to question whether Pic 'N' 
Save will make a full-fledged effort to sell itself. 
</P>
<P>
Girard, which disclosed in April that it acquired 6.7% of Pic 'N' Save's stock, 
says it is seeking to take control of the retailer's board so it can buy the 
company itself or auction it to the highest bidder. It is trying to gain a 
majority on Pic 'N' Save's board either through a proxy fight at the company's 
annual meeting on June 20 or by winning shareholders' consent before then for a 
reconstituted five-member board. 
</P>
<P>
Girard has faulted the rapidly expanding retailer for its declining earnings 
and sluggish stock price over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
To blunt the takeover threat, Pic 'N' Save announced last Friday that it would 
talk to prospective buyers. At the same time, the company expressed doubts that 
anyone would be able to pay a fair price for the company because of the lack of 
financing available for a retailing industry takeover. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, La Jolla financier David H. Batchelder, the head of 
Girard Partners, cited the doubts expressed by Pic 'N' Save. He then added: 
"Girard Partners will not legitimize the company's half-hearted bidding process 
by participating as a bidder or as minority directors. 
</P>
<P>
"The shareholders of Pic 'N' Save will decide which board, the incumbent board 
or Girard's nominees, they want to represent their interests as owners of the 
company." 
</P>
<P>
Pic 'N' Save initially placed a long list of restrictions on bidders that are 
granted access to its confidential financial information but offered earlier 
this week to ease those restrictions. The company said Wednesday that it 
remained willing to negotiate the terms of its proposed bidding process. 
</P>
<P>
William D. Tichy, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said the newly 
announced concessions appeared to be only minor improvements over Pic 'N' 
Save's previous offer. He said the announcement mainly was intended "to 
convince shareholders that the management team currently in place is exploring 
all avenues" to boost the price of the stock. 
</P>
<P>
Tichy said he doubted whether Pic 'N' Save could make any further concessions, 
short of ceding control to Girard, that would persuade Batchelder to drop his 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
Batchelder "seems pretty adamant on seeing this thing through," Tichy said. 
"He's not going to stop in midstream." 
</P>
<P>
Pic 'N' Save's stock climbed 50 cents a share to $13.125 in over-the-counter 
trading Wednesday. The latest announcements came several hours after the stock 
market closed.

JACK SMITH: TEA FOR TWO SURE BEATS ANOTHER MAUSOLEUM VISIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the morning after our visit to Abu Simbel, we were scheduled to visit a 
botanical garden and the Aga Khan's mausoleum. 
</P>
<P>
I decided to pass. I am not botanically minded, and I was tiring of mausoleums. 
My wife went. 
</P>
<P>
Since our boat was docked in Aswan, I decided to explore the town -- as it 
turned out, a serendipitous choice. 
</P>
<P>
I had walked only a block or two along the river before I came to a dirty ocher 
two-story building with two barred windows and a door guarded by two uniformed 
men with assault rifles. I guessed it was a police station. They are much the 
same worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
I walked in, unmolested. Inside there was one long hallway crossed by another. 
People sat on benches along the hallways. They looked bored, anxious or 
despondent. One woman in the long, loose black outer garment worn by most 
Muslim women was nursing a baby. In the hallways, much business was being done. 
Men in business suits with long, black scarfs tufted with white at their ends 
were talking to humbler people. The men with the scarfs were obviously lawyers. 
I was in a courthouse. It was L.A. Law Aswan. 
</P>
<P>
I walked down the main hall and looked into a room that appeared to be a court. 
I walked in and sat on one of the benches. There was the usual rail, with a 
judge's bench beyond it. On one wall there was a barred cell, about four by 12 
feet. Several people sat on benches behind me. In the front row were three 
women in black garments with white-tufted scarfs. I was surprised to find 
Muslim women could be lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
One of them turned and smiled at me. "Is this a courtroom?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
She grinned. "In half an hour," she said, her English surprisingly good. 
</P>
<P>
I decided to wait. Gradually the benches filled up with the friends and 
relatives of the defendants. An officer brought in a handcuffed man and locked 
him in the cell. A woman with a small girl in her arms walked over to the bars 
and held the girl up. The prisoner stood and kissed her through the bars. 
</P>
<P>
A man I took to be a clerk came in and sat at a table beside the bench, 
riffling papers. An older man in a yellow robe came in. Obviously the bailiff. 
He looked sternly at the spectators. Finally, he gave an order in Arabic and 
everyone stood. Including me. 
</P>
<P>
A door opened and a young man walked in. He was rather good looking. Blue 
business suit, shirt, necktie, plastic-rimmed glasses. He took the bench 
quickly and began the proceedings, going through a pile of loose papers handed 
to him by the clerk. 
</P>
<P>
One by one the lawyers came forward. Oddly, the three women were last. I 
assumed that it was simply an arraignment court, that the judge was merely 
assigning dates for later trial. 
</P>
<P>
Finally he was finished and the court began to empty. I tarried, wanting to say 
goodby to the woman lawyer I had talked to. Then I noticed the bailiff was 
beckoning me. Come forward, he seemed to mean. I wondered if I had violated 
some protocol. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, I went forward, and the bailiff directed me to the bench. I stood 
before the judge, not knowing what I might be accused of. 
</P>
<P>
"What is your nationality?" the judge asked. 
</P>
<P>
"American," I said. 
</P>
<P>
That seemed to interest him. "Do you speak French?" he asked. I knew I was 
finished. I have no French. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had studied law in France. I told him my wife was French, but 
unfortunately she was visiting a tomb. I don't think he understood me. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like for you to have tea with me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
I was delighted. The judge stood to return to his chambers. He spoke to his 
bailiff, who led me through the corridor and through a door into a room in 
which the judge was seated at a small table. His clerk sat beside him. They 
were working. 
</P>
<P>
In a moment the bailiff brought me a glass of hot tea. The judge asked me where 
I was staying. I told him I was on the Queen Nabila I. He said he would like to 
visit me that evening. I said regretfully that we were sailing at midday for 
Luxor. He seemed disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
He asked me for my card. I gave him my name and address and asked for his. His 
name was Mohammad Mohammad. That virtually ended our conversation. I thanked 
him for his hospitality and withdrew. 
</P>
<P>
When my wife came back from the Aga Khan's tomb, she said: "Well, what did you 
do with your morning?" 
</P>
<P>
I said: "I went to court."

SHE REFUSES TO REMAIN A VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANNE KLEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER Dianne Klein is a columnist for The Times 
in the Orange County edition. Her column appears there Wednesdays, Fridays and 
Sundays.

<TEXT>
<P>
This is a story of violence, terror, humiliation and finally, inner strength. 
It is about rape. 
</P>
<P>
Some of you may want to stop here. The brutality of this crime jars and spreads 
pain. It is explicit and raw. 
</P>
<P>
A stranger raped Sher Fuller-Hookano, in her own house, on her own bed, in 
March. He has not been caught. The police believe this man will attack again; 
rapists usually do. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing a rape victim's name in print may surprise you, even offend. The media 
rarely name victims of sexual assault. Rape victims, the reasoning goes, don't 
need a social stigma to compound their pain. 
</P>
<P>
But Sher Fuller-Hookano wants to speak out, by name. She wants details known. 
She wants to make people uncomfortable, to show them what what rape truly is. 
She has done nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Many people still don't get it. They think rape is about sex when really it is 
about violence and domination and rage. Some even make jokes -- while victims 
feel dirtied, powerless, and somehow to blame. 
</P>
<P>
Sher hopes to punch a hole in the aura of shame and guilt by speaking out. She 
wants to warn other women. She wants her attacker caught. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a rape victim," she says. "But I don't want to stay a rape victim." 
</P>
<P>
Still, our conversations are laced with Sher's grief. Never are they without 
her tears. At times, she surrenders to the sobs. I can only wait. 
</P>
<P>
Sher Fuller-Hookano had lived in a rented beach cottage in northern Laguna 
Beach for almost nine years. She married last year, but after about 10 months, 
her husband moved out. 
</P>
<P>
They still kept in touch, however, seeing each other often as friends. As late 
as March, there were hopes that their marriage might yet work out. 
</P>
<P>
At 45, Sher is independent and self-assured. She recently left her job as an 
executive assistant, confident she would have little trouble finding something 
else. 
</P>
<P>
Sher loves to walk, and in Laguna, she would stroll down to the beach, through 
Heisler Park or just take in the local sights. Often she would go out alone at 
night, to dinner or a movie, or simply to feel the brace of the cool Pacific 
air. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to feel real safe there," she says. "I used to sleep with the windows 
open. I never dreamed that anything would happen to me." 
</P>
<P>
And it didn't for many years. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the early morning hours of March 18, Sher returned home from a St. 
Patrick's Day party at a friend's house in Costa Mesa. She was tired -- it was 
4 a.m. -- and she was ready for sleep. She was just about to get into bed, when 
she noticed dust by her bedside table. A screen had been removed. She'd been 
robbed. 
</P>
<P>
Sher wasn't too concerned about the loss -- some jewelry, a new flashlight and 
her spare key were missing -- but the next day, she made sure to change the 
lock that fit the stolen key. She mentioned the burglary to her next-door 
neighbor and told him that maybe he, too, should be more careful with his 
things. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Sher wasn't overly worried. She didn't even bother telling the police. 
She figured the chances of recovering her property were, at best, slim to none. 
</P>
<P>
Monday evening is Sher's time for television. She usually stays home, to watch 
"Murphy Brown," then follows that with another favorite, "Designing Women." On 
March 19, her routine complete, she lay down to sleep after watching the 11 
p.m. news. 
</P>
<P>
It was chilly. The sweat pants and T-shirt that she was wearing made her feel 
warm in her bed. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 minutes later, already fast asleep, Sher heard a noise. It jolted her 
awake. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I thought it sounded like the whole back of the house was coming 
off," she says. "Then I realized that it was someone trying to break in. In 
this millisecond, when all this is happening, I thought that I didn't have 
enough time to get to the front door and the phone was in the kitchen. I didn't 
have time to call 911." 
</P>
<P>
Then, in an instant, Sher's fear gave way to an indignant rage. 
</P>
<P>
"I got so furious, so angry, that somebody was breaking into my house. I 
thought it must be a transient. It sounded like he was kicking in the door. I 
thought he was probably mad that his key didn't fit. 
</P>
<P>
"So instead of trying to get out of the house, I got up and went through the 
bathroom, toward the back porch, to confront him. I was screaming, 'Get out of 
my house!' . . . Then I saw him, just standing there. The SOB was in my house. 
I was screaming at him, telling him to get out. Then he hit me with his fist 
and said, 'Shut the f--- up or I'll kill you.' Then he reached around the 
corner and switched off the bathroom light. He knew where it was." 
</P>
<P>
It was then, Sher says, that raw terror blocked out everything else. 
</P>
<P>
"I got really scared. I thought he had seen my pictures, my passport, the 
pictures on the mantle of me with my family. He wasn't coming back to rob me. 
He was coming back for me. Not for anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Sher began to fight, screaming and crying and hitting the intruder with all her 
strength, but soon he grabbed her by the throat. He threatened her, swearing, 
his anger on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
Because the rooms were dark, her description of her attacker is vague. He was 
young, perhaps in his 20s, slender, but with a muscular build. His dark hair 
was cropped close to his scalp. He may have had a mustache, and probably stood 
at least 6 feet tall. Sher is 5-feet-10. 
</P>
<P>
The man's strength, however, was overpowering. While ordering Sher to keep 
quiet if she valued her life, he hit her, again and again. He pushed her 
through the bathroom into her bedroom. He was tearing at her clothes. 
</P>
<P>
There seemed to be blood everywhere, she recalls. It was on the floor, the 
walls and now, on the bed. Sher wondered if he had cut her. She felt numb. 
</P>
<P>
"He was holding my head down, on the side, and the bedspread was cutting off my 
breath. I pleaded with him to please let me up. I told him that I couldn't 
breathe. I was so scared. Finally, he said he would, if I would do as he said. 
I told him I would. I knew I was going to die." 
</P>
<P>
It was then, Sher says, between gut wrenching sobs, that she seemed to leave 
her body. It was as if her spirit, floating above her bed, was watching the 
horror going on below. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept trying to see his face even though he told me not to, if I didn't want 
to die. I thought, 'I'm going to die anyway. I want to know who this bastard 
is. I want to see who is going to kill me.' " 
</P>
<P>
With her body gone limp, Sher could feel her attacker ripping off her clothes. 
One of his hands seemed to be always at her throat. 
</P>
<P>
The man took off his shorts and pulled his tank top over his head, leaving it 
draped across his shoulders. He got on top of her and tried to kiss her on her 
mouth. Then he entered her with such violence that it hurt. 
</P>
<P>
He commanded her to touch him and to perform oral sex. Sher did as she was 
told, under threat of death. The man entered her, five times, after ordering 
her into different positions. 
</P>
<P>
"Then he told me to turn over on my stomach," Sher says. "I thought, 'Now he is 
going to kill me.' I had pillows over my head. He told me not to look at him 
and I heard him moving around in my house. I just lay there. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard him in the kitchen. I thought maybe I'm going to get a knife in the 
shoulder blades. I was petrified. I was just waiting. . . . Then, after a 
while, I heard the close of the back gate. I knew it was him leaving. I ran to 
the closet and grabbed a robe and ran to a neighbor's." 
</P>
<P>
The rape lasted about 10 minutes, by the clock. It still isn't over in Sher's 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
"You are changed," she tells me. "It's like my other life is gone. I'll never 
be the same." 
</P>
<P>
The physical marks from Sher's attack are gone, her bruises faded. The blood 
that had covered her body, and her house, was not her own. Police speculate 
that Sher must have broken her assailant's nose. 
</P>
<P>
But rape is a crime that never ends with the act of physical violence. Two 
months after the attack, it is tearing at Sher's relationships, dredging up 
fear and shame; it has carved scars deep in her soul. 
</P>
<P>
Sher's assailant, statistics show, will probably strike again. Someone else's 
soul will be etched by his wrath. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Watson, who is 23 years old, was the neighbor to whom Sher turned when she 
ran from her house, in her pink bathrobe, moments after being raped. 
</P>
<P>
Even if she had wanted to, Sher could not have phoned the police from her home. 
The rapist pulled her only telephone from the wall, and stole her purse, too. 
</P>
<P>
"At about 12:20 that night, I heard this terrible pounding on my front door," 
Roy says. "There was Sher, just bawling her eyes out. Her blond hair was brick 
red from all the blood. She was bruised. I assumed what had happened, but I 
didn't really know. This is not something that you prepare for." 
</P>
<P>
After Roy called 911, and Sher was taken by ambulance to South Coast Medical 
Center, other officers arrived at Roy's home. Two fire engines came moments 
after that. 
</P>
<P>
Roy told police what he knew, but he really hadn't a clue. Not even the 
neighbors' black Labrador retriever had made a sound from next door. 
</P>
<P>
"This one cop, he was very young, maybe 19, who stayed behind, says to me, 'If 
the neighbors come asking you what happened, just say that she was robbed,' " 
Roy recalls. "He said, 'We don't want to upset anybody or start a panic.' I 
acted like I agreed with him. . . . I didn't go advertise it, of course. . . . 
Some people become very ashamed of something like this. I was trying to respect 
her privacy." 
</P>
<P>
But Sher's privacy was shattered when her rapist broke into her home. When Roy 
told her what the officer had said, Sher was annoyed. She told him to tell the 
truth to all who asked. She wants everyone, and especially the neighbors, to be 
warned. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach Police Chief Neil Purcell said he agrees. Those in the 
neighborhood should know what had occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I was violated in the most horrible way possible," Sher says, her voice 
broken by tears. "But I still want to fight back. I refuse to be a victim. If I 
don't, it will mean that he has won." 
</P>
<P>
Many who are close to Sher cannot fathom this. They are confused, repulsed and 
find they do not know how to act. The men in her life, especially, cannot put 
their horror into words. Sher says she feels shunned. 
</P>
<P>
Marlene Phillips, a marriage, family and child counselor whom Sher has been 
seeing once a week since the rape, isn't surprised. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of men are very uncomfortable talking about rape," she says. "They might 
see the woman as having been dirtied, that it was her fault. The feelings might 
not be as overt as that, but it's there, that they are damaged goods. . . . If 
someone hits you over the head and steals your purse, it's a random act of 
violence. If someone rapes you, then it's because you are a slut or wearing 
seductive clothes or you shouldn't have been there. It becomes the woman's 
fault." 
</P>
<P>
But Phillips says that victims, too, often share those feelings of having done 
something wrong. And convincing them otherwise can take time. 
</P>
<P>
"I think part of that is a need to feel some control," she says. "If you tell 
yourself that you were at fault then you can see that next time, you'll avoid 
certain situations; you will be back in control. But most of the time, and 
certainly in a stranger rape such as this one, it is just one of those things. 
. . . Beyond certain obvious precautions, there is really not a lot you can do 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
Lessening the trauma of rape means talking about it as well. It is a slow 
process and it hurts. Rape is still an unspeakable crime. Child abuse was like 
that a few years back. But now people are talking about that crime. Now they 
are fighting back. 
</P>
<P>
"This is so important to talk about," Phillips says. "Pushing it away only lets 
it fester someplace else. . . . I think that what Sher is doing is very brave 
and I commend her. It is important that people recognize that these people are 
victims, that they have done nothing to invite this crime. Rape is so cruel and 
vicious. It preys on a lot of levels. The public at large sees you as guilty, 
as involved in the attack, so you don't get a lot of sympathy." 
</P>
<P>
Detective Ron Sapp, who is handling Sher's case for the Laguna police, says he 
is surprised Sher has come forward, but adds that maybe the publicity will 
help. He has no suspects. Perhaps if Sher's attacker rapes again, he says, the 
next victim can get a better identification. 
</P>
<P>
Although there was another rape in Laguna exactly two weeks after the attack on 
Sher, police report an average of fewer than 10 rapes a year in the last 
decade. "We are kind of a sleepy little community," Sapp says. "It is really 
not a problem here." 
</P>
<P>
The second rape, also unsolved, was committed by a man with apparently similar 
characteristics, but Sapp says he has ruled out any connection. One suspect was 
slim, he says, the other weighed more than 200 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
I first met Sher at her new home, a place one can only enter after using secret 
electronic codes. Her new phone number is unlisted and an answering machine 
screens her calls. She still hadn't hung her pictures on the walls. 
</P>
<P>
No longer does she walk alone at night. If she travels alone after dusk, it is 
by car, directly to the house of a friend. 
</P>
<P>
The only time that Sher has been back to her Laguna home was with a friend, 
whom she stayed with for three weeks after the attack, and then only to 
retrieve her clothes. Caked blood seemed to be at every turn. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like walking into a nightmare," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Sher and I keep talking, about her fears and her loneliness, about trauma that 
perhaps only time can heal. The sessions with Phillips, recommended by the Rape 
Crisis Hotline volunteer who stayed with Sher at the hospital, seem to be of 
help. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what is so bizarre about something like this happening to you," Sher 
says, her voice trailing off, "I have always been an independent person, taking 
care of myself. Now, with this, it's like a chink in my armor. All the bad 
things, the things that I've just pushed down inside, things that I didn't even 
know were there, all of that keeps coming out. It's like the straw that broke 
the camel's back. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be treated as a leper," she goes on, tears of desperation 
streaking her cheeks. "Before, I was always busy, doing things, seeing people. 
But now I see that I'm all alone. That's the reality that's slapped me in the 
face. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"You know . . . I used to be a bleeding-heart liberal. But if I had a gun and 
they brought that man before me, I could blow his head off with no problem." 
</P>
<P>
But no, Sher says, she does not own a gun and she doesn't plan to get one. 
</P>
<P>
She wants to get on with her life, to put this ugliness away. But she will 
never forget it. 
</P>
<P>
Nor should we.

<TEXT>
<P>
At 48, Yves Beauchemin has nurtured a low-grade anxiety over what he regards as 
the ongoing pillage of his native province, Quebec. Coupled with a well-honed 
appreciation for the occasional absurdity of French life in an 
English-dominated continent, this has helped him become his province's 
best-known living novelist. 
</P>
<P>
Beauchemin is a rarity in French Canada: a writer of such distinct narrative 
power and universal appeal that his books are read around the world. "The 
Oxford Companion to Canadian Literature" has called him "one of the most gifted 
storytellers to emerge in recent years in French-language literature." 
</P>
<P>
In France, where the natives are always finicky about accepting non-native 
writers, few have taken issue with this characterization. Beauchemin's second 
novel, published in 1981 as "Le Matou," sold more than 750,000 copies as a 
French book-of-the month-club offering. 
</P>
<P>
"Le Matou" is the Faustian tale of a young man, Florent Boisonneault, who falls 
prey to a Mephistophelean figure, Egon Ratablavasky. The old man persuades him 
to buy out a popular Montreal restaurant. Florent soon realizes that he has 
been duped. Worse, he learns that the entire city, including his Anglo partner, 
appears to have fallen under the evil Ratablavasky's influence. 
</P>
<P>
Ranking French critic Bernard Pivot called "Le Matou" "a revelation." The book 
later won that country's prestigious Prix du Roman de L'Ete. "Le Matou" has 
since sold 1.2 million copies, in various French editions, throughout the 
French-speaking world. It was adapted in 1985 as a six-part TV miniseries as a 
joint French and Quebecois production. 
</P>
<P>
In the U.S., which has little or no historical affinity for Quebecois 
literature, "Le Matou" was published five years later by Henry Holt &amp; Co. 
in translation as "The Alley Cat." Warmly received by American critics, it sold 
a respectable 40,000 copies in hardcover (a quarter of these sales in English 
Canada), and has since been translated into 15 languages, including Finnish, 
Romanian and, most recently, Hebrew. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Beauchemin has published a new novel -- the nearly 700-page-long and 
still-to-be-translated "Juliette Pomerleau" -- fans in both French and English 
Canada are betting that he will reach an even wider readership. "Juliette 
Pomerleau," published in March by Quebec-Amerique, sold more than 50,000 copies 
during its first month, and sales have remained steady since. 
</P>
<P>
Critics in Quebec have written that the book, which he defines as "sort of a 
detective novel without a detective or, for that matter, a crime," confirms 
Beauchemin's position as French Canada's master storyteller. One of them 
characterized the book as "another Titanic -- only this one floats." 
</P>
<P>
Like the characters who populate his picaresque novels, Yves Beauchemin has not 
succumbed passively to the inequities and insularity of life in what some have 
described as "Fortress Quebec." There is a sense in his books of the new 
Quebec: a secular would-be republic eager to embrace the capitalism and 
materialism rampant on the continent even as it remains wary of the inexorably 
seductive pull of the English language that dominates it. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in his novels, which have been called Dickensian in their sense of place 
and Balzacian in their depth of character, people are also always making off 
with whatever bits and pieces of Quebec that are not bolted to the ground. In 
"The Alley Cat," for instance, Beauchemin's alter ego witnesses the removal of 
a clock from an historic Gothic church. It is to be installed, he learns, in a 
Connecticut amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
"Those Americans," complains a woman onlooker, "they are bloody powerful, eh?" 
</P>
<P>
This perhaps reflects his vision of Americans in Quebec, where Beauchemin has 
lived his entire life. 
</P>
<P>
As a child growing up in Clova, a northern Quebec lumber town owned by a New 
York paper company, Beauchemin witnessed the decimation of the province's 
once-plush woodlands. In his view, Canada was a colony of the U.S., and Quebec, 
a colony of Canada. Now, the English in both countries appear intent -- or so 
it seems from where he stands -- upon decimating the province's cultural and 
linguistic viability as well. 
</P>
<P>
As Beauchemin, an avowed independiste, or separatist, sees it, English Canada 
has systematically sapped Quebec of its sovereign potential. Even the federal 
policy of bilingualism, which was adopted during the 1960s to assure the 
equality of French and English as official languages throughout Canada, 
remains, for many Quebecois, a no-win proposition. 
</P>
<P>
"I am profoundly convinced," Beauchemin told the Montreal Gazette, "that Quebec 
cannot reach its full potential without attaining independence. That doesn't 
mean I wish all the Anglophones would go to hell." Without independence, 
Beauchemin and others fear Quebec will ultimately disappear linguistically and 
culturally into English North America. "We are," he once said of French Quebec, 
"like a cube of sugar beside a gallon of coffee." 
</P>
<P>
Beauchemin was born in Noranda, a northern mining town near the Ontario border, 
where his grandfather published a newspaper, Le Frontiere. When he was 5, he 
moved with his family to Clova, near Abitibi, 200 miles away, where his father 
worked as a field inspector for the New York-based International Paper Co. 
</P>
<P>
"For a kid," he said, "it was a wonderful place, just tremendous. There were no 
police, no mayor, only the most minimal degree of social organization, and 
there was a lot of space." 
</P>
<P>
If one could endure the seclusion -- the town was fed by a single railway line, 
and medical emergencies necessitated calling in an airplane -- Clova was not 
the worst place for an adult to be, either, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly there was little of the privation and price gouging one might 
otherwise expect from a company town. The company, said Beauchemin, had a hard 
time getting people to work so far away from the most rudimentary urban 
centers. As a result, there were perks. Beauchemin lived with his brothers and 
sisters in a large two-story house rented, he recalls, for $15 a month. Milk 
was free and meat was cheap, 10 cents a pound for any cut. 
</P>
<P>
Unusual for Quebec in those days, Clova was also lingually integrated. French 
and English children studied together in the same school house. It was there 
that Beauchemin learned the English that has stayed with him, however 
haltingly, to this day. 
</P>
<P>
"We lived harmoniously," he recalled, "because everybody accepted the rules of 
the game. The office jobs went to the English, the physical jobs to the French. 
It couldn't have been otherwise, of course -- French people weren't educated 
enough to hold the other jobs. Until 1960 we didn't even have a ministry of 
education in Quebec." 
</P>
<P>
Beauchemin became a voracious reader at an early age. Problems with his left 
eye made him unfit, he said, to play hockey and baseball with the other boys. 
"I wore glasses, and of course the boys called me sissy. I never learned to do 
sports well but I did learn to fight." 
</P>
<P>
His mother had kept her childhood library, and Beauchemin subsisted on French 
imports, packages from his grandfather's substantial library in Abitibi, and 
English-language comic books consumed by his Anglo schoolmates. 
</P>
<P>
In 1953, Beauchemin left Clova to attend high school in Joliette, a small 
French town about 60 kilometers northeast of Montreal. He lived in a dormitory, 
but his first year of regimentation was difficult. Eventually, however, 
Beauchemin became enamored of the city, of what he has called the "Balzac 
effect," the richness and diversity of urban living. 
</P>
<P>
As a boy, Beauchemin had tried his hand at a novel set in Venice. This quickly 
proved to be beyond his capacities -- he gave it up after four pages. But he 
returned to the craft of writing at 19, completing a novel influenced by 
19th-Century Russian literature. It wasn't terribly accomplished, and has never 
been published, but Beauchemin continues to regard it as an important landmark. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the characteristics of a real writer," he says, "is that they finish 
what they start." 
</P>
<P>
There followed a series of perhaps 50 humorous stories and vignettes cast in 
the manner of Mark Twain and Stephen Leacock. An astute sense of the comic 
remains one of Beauchemin's trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
At 21, Beauchemin entered the University of Montreal, where he obtained a 
three-year degree in French and art history. Quebec had just gone through its 
so-called Quiet Revolution, attended by major educational and social reforms 
and a lessening of the power of the Catholic Church over Quebecois institutions 
and political affairs. While in Montreal, however, he became politicized by the 
realization that although the majority of people living there were French, the 
language of business and power remained English. 
</P>
<P>
After graduating, Beauchemin taught literature at the College Garneau and at 
Universite Laval. During this time, he continued churning out short stories and 
articles, which were published in a variety of local magazines and newspapers. 
Beauchemin ultimately forsook academe, saying that he did not wish to spend his 
days "measuring (Quebec novelist) Gabrielle Roy's soul with a ruler." 
</P>
<P>
He worked in Montreal at a branch of the book publisher Holt, Rinehart &amp; 
Winston, where he became the editor in charge of drama and history. While 
working as a researcher at Radio-Quebec, which he joined in 1969, Beauchemin 
continued to improve his craft. "I loved that job because it was nourishing for 
a novelist. I was always learning something new." 
</P>
<P>
Beauchemin says the great Russian novels of the 19th Century, among others, 
inspire his writing. He cites Nikolai Gogol and Charles Dickens as important 
sources for "Le Matou," as well as such 20th-Century Americans as John 
Steinbeck, J. D. Salinger and Ernest Hemingway. "I found in all of them a sense 
of place, of time, and a concrete, pragmatic way of dealing with a story." 
</P>
<P>
"What Quebecois readers want is a good story. That's all. If you can't write a 
good story, they won't read it. 
</P>
<P>
His job, according to critic Francine Pelletier, writing in the Montreal 
Gazette, is "to translate what we like to call here le Quebec profond -- the 
heart and soul of Quebec."

Question: My children take peanut butter sandwiches to school every day. They 
enjoy them, I've been told that peanut butter is nutritious, and the sandwiches 
take very little time to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
But I've noticed that there's usually a little bit of oil at the top of the 
jar, and I'm becoming concerned that my children are getting too much 
cholesterol. Would you please let me know how much cholesterol there is in 
peanut butter, compared, for example, with a frankfurter? Which would be better 
for them to have? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: One frankfurter provides about 34 milligrams of cholesterol. Peanut 
butter is not an animal product, and therefore does not contain any 
cholesterol. On all counts, a peanut butter sandwich, particularly if prepared 
with whole wheat bread, would be much more nutritious than a frankfurter.

MAGAZINES: EASTERN EUROPEAN UPHEAVAL BRINGS FOCUS ON CASTRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most politically progressive journals were quick to embrace the changes 
sweeping Eastern Europe in the age of glasnost and perestroika. Closer to home, 
though, Cuba has proven more problematic. 
</P>
<P>
Mother Jones may have been the first left-wing publication to suggest that 
Cuban leader Fidel Castro has overstayed his political welcome. A series of 
articles in the June Progressive is a bit more equivocal. 
</P>
<P>
A piece by Saul Landau of the Institute for Policy Studies, while making valid 
points about America's inadvertent complicity in forcing Castro's hand, reads 
like an apologia for the dictator. 
</P>
<P>
But William Steif's more balanced article, "Grumbling and Graffiti," points out 
something often overlooked by the U.S. press: Despite his Draconian ways, 
Castro still has strong support in some areas and it is bolstered each time the 
United States does something, which to Cubans, smacks of "Yanqui imperialism" 
-- such as last year's invasion of Panama. 
</P>
<P>
As one pro-Castro demonstrator told Steif, "The Yanquis don't approach us as 
peers, don't approach us as gentlemen." 
</P>
<P>
Other Cubans, he reports, worry about right-wing exiles in Florida, who openly 
plan to go back when Castro dies or is deposed to reclaim property that Castro 
nationalized. Those holdings would include "dozens of dilapidated mansions in 
the once-upscale Miramar district," Steif writes, adding, "The hundreds of 
families who live crowded in those mansions and hang their laundry to dry from 
the mansion windows are offended by the idea of the rich returning there." 
</P>
<P>

REQUIRED READING 
</P>
<P>
* At least since Paradise Lost, bad guys have explained their evil deeds by 
saying "The devil made me do it." Lately, though, some cops also have been laid 
blame for certain crimes on Lucifer. The Spring issue of The Skeptical Inquirer 
investigates investigators of alleged Satanic cults and finds that most of 
these self-styled experts -- popular speakers on the law enforcement conference 
circuit these days -- often depend more on fundamentalist Christian dogma and 
newspaper clippings than rational detective work. A second piece tracks the 
peculiar phenomenon of "Satanic cult rumor panics," which have swept parts of 
the country since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
* Things happen fast these days and there's seldom time to step back and ponder 
world events -- not in an economic or geopolitical or artistic sense, but in a 
more deeply philosophical sense. In a speech reprinted in the June Smart, 
author Kurt Vonnegut wonders why countries on occasion blast civilian targets 
into oblivion. Vonnegut, who as a prisoner of war survived the Allied 
firebombing of Dresden 45 years ago, doesn't offer a satisfactory answer. But 
his wise observations on bombings from Hiroshima to Libya are worth slowing 
down long enough to consider. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SHREDDER FODDER 
</P>
<P>
* This spring, Life magazine launches its latest single-advertiser "Special 
Issue," this one on "The World of Children." The advertiser in this case is 
McDonald's, but the McAdvertisements and McPhoto-essays run together, creating 
a gooier mess than a preschool class dribbling McMilkshakes. 
</P>
<P>
* When will the once-great Esquire face truth in advertising laws and change 
its subtitle to: "How to be a New Age Yuppie, circa 1983?" The current issue 
dissects "The Secret Life of the American Wife," but this shotgun wedding 
between a bad idea and a desperate publication should have been annulled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MAGAZINE VS. MAGAZINE 
</P>
<P>
* As the June WigWag sees things, "People magazine's exclusive coverage of Ryan 
White's death was inconceivably sad -- sad in countless ways." The WigWag 
editorial recounts People's seven-step coverage. For instance, No. 2: When 
(Elton John) saw Ryan, lying unconscious, he was taken aback ("At first John is 
simply overcome, unable to speak.") But he managed to pull himself together and 
comfort Ryan's mother ("The superstar and the Kokomo factory worker hug and 
stare. Only the thunk-thunk of the ventilator and the beep-beep of the heart 
monitor fill the silence" and Ryan, too. Finally, Elton finds the words for 
this moment. . . . 'Ryan,' he says softly, leaning close to the blank face. 
'Michael Jackson called to see how you were.' ") 
</P>
<P>
* In deciding to parody Vanity Fair, the June National Lampoon set its sights 
on an easy target. But the only bulls-eye in the hit-and-miss skewering that 
Lampoon delivers is a not-so-subtle "Editor's Letter" from one "Teena Brown": 
"Not many magazines possess the resources, or the commitment to substance, to 
run 600,000-word profiles of rich people," this spoof of Brown writes. "But 
when it comes to the superficial, V.F. digs deeper. The success we've enjoyed 
demonstrates that we deliver what our readers really want. . . . In truth, 
today's magazine readers like ads." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEW ON NEWSSTANDS 
</P>
<P>
There are magazines devoted exclusively to oceans, to rivers, to islands. 
Summit, The Mountain Journal, premieres this spring, devoted exclusively to 
"the home of the gods -- that elevated world where your eyes see farther, your 
heart pulses faster, your soul soars higher." 
</P>
<P>
More than just another outlet for mountaineers' braggadocio and mystical 
mumblings, this well-produced Fleetwood, Pa., publication -- at least the first 
issue -- offers enough fine photography and prose to engage even dedicated 
flat-landers.

ERMA BOMBECK: LIFE IS AN ADVENTURE IN GOOD TASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A "thirtysomething" reader posed an interesting question. "Why is it when 
speaking with an 'older' person about a trip or a vacation they've been on, I 
get an answer like this? 
</P>
<P>
"Me: 'You were at Yellowstone last summer. How was it?' 
</P>
<P>
"Them: 'Oh, it was wonderful! We had the best spaghetti I've ever tasted just 
outside of Jackson Hole at a little restaurant. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
The young woman observed that about 75% of the conversation with older people 
is about food . . . where it is, how much it cost, how it tasted. She wondered 
if it was because they grew up in the Great Depression, when food was scarce 
and they had to eat the same thing all the time. 
</P>
<P>
I think that's part of it. When I was attending college, my mother's letters 
read like a menu. She began with breakfast and outlined everything she had to 
eat for the entire week. Our phone conversations were always about the same 
thing: food. "What are you having for dinner? I'm heating up the leftover ham 
and frying some potatoes and having a little corn on the cob." 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, she and my dad took a cruise to Alaska. They took 125 slides; 
only six had people in them. (Two of them were pastry chefs.) The other 
pictures were of carved bits of ice, cheese displays, baskets of bread and 
flaming desserts. 
</P>
<P>
I blamed the Depression years for having to "clean up" everything on my plate 
and eat up the black bananas before I could start on the yellow ones. We were 
told the "heels" of bread made your hair curly and starving Armenians were 
waiting in line for those stinking Brussels sprouts. Mom would spend a fortune 
on glass jars and lids to can a bag of "free" apples. 
</P>
<P>
My other theory is that after a certain age, food is one of the few vices left 
that you can enjoy. The kids are gone and have their own lives. Your job is a 
memory. Physical activities are a real effort. A new car no longer gives you 
the kick it once did. Food is one of the few fantasies you can lust after and 
turn into reality. If you live long enough, food even replaces sex. 
</P>
<P>
Our young friend said the weird part of her findings was that a couple of weeks 
ago, a contemporary of hers went to a Paul McCartney concert, and when asked 
how she liked it, said, "Oh, it was great. You should have seen all the food we 
had before the concert -- honey-baked ham, roast turkey, munchies. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
I told my reader that her friend was older than she thinks.

KINKAJOUS' TALE HAS MANY TWISTS EVOLVING FROM OWNERSHIP BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When four missing kinkajous -- cuddly, long-tailed members of the raccoon 
family -- were returned to UC Irvine Wednesday by order of a Texas court, it 
was only the latest chapter in a months-long saga involving animal rights 
activists, a Ph.D. candidate and the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
The tale is a complicated one with many twists. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to ordering the animals returned to UCI, U.S. District Judge 
Charles Gonzalez in San Antonio last week granted visitation rights to animal 
rights activists and temporarily halted experiments on the animals. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez's temporary restraining order was a result of a lawsuit that Primarily 
Primates Inc., an animal center in San Antonio, filed against Ph.D. candidate 
Cary Chevalier, charging that the UCI researcher had abandoned the kinkajous 
and was therefore not their rightful owner. A full hearing on the case is 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
Chevalier and an attorney UCI hired to defend him say the animals were stolen 
from him by groups opposed to the use of animals in scientific research. 
</P>
<P>
By hiring a lawyer to represent Chevalier, UCI probably has become one of the 
first institutions to stand up to animal rights activists who are becoming more 
vocal in their protests, lawyers for the university said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is UCI's intent to get a message to the animal rights activists that if 
they are going to obtain custody of animals, they do so properly, legally and 
without victimization of those people whose animals they have taken without the 
right and legal authority to do so," said Dr. Paul Sypherd, UCI's vice 
chancellor of research and graduate studies. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to do anything illegal," said Wally Swenn, director of the San 
Antonio center. "We're not stealing animals. There's a lot of sneaky things 
going on, and it's not right, and it's not fair to the animals. 
</P>
<P>
"I just find UCI just being totally wrong here. They're taking it as an attack 
on their biomedical practices, and that's not it." 
</P>
<P>
Chevalier, a doctoral student in biology, has spent the last two years studying 
the effects of changing climate on kinkajous, which are native to the tropical 
rain forests of Mexico and South America. His research was part of a broad 
field of study on how wildlife adapts to changes in the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Among the experiments he has performed are ones that subjected the animals to 
temperatures ranging from 32 to 113 degrees. Chevalier said the kinkajous, 
which are like pets to him, are not being harmed by the research. His 
experiments, which are closely monitored, could ultimately ensure the survival 
of their species, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Chevalier took a sabbatical to both write his dissertation and take 
a job with the Arizona Game and Fish Department. He had to find a temporary 
home for the kinkajous as he waited to obtain the necessary permits to keep the 
animals with him in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
By inquiring about in the network of animal care services, Chevalier was told 
about the Animal Rehabilitation Center of Midlothian, Tex. He sent his 
kinkajous there last May, checking on them periodically. 
</P>
<P>
In October, Chevalier said, Karen Wakeland, director of the center, called him 
in Arizona to say that the animals had escaped. Alarmed, Chevalier sent flyers 
to various state and local agencies about the missing animals. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks later, Chevalier said, a sheriff's deputy from Ellis County in 
northern Texas who had seen the flyers told him that Wakeland had hired him to 
transport the kinkajous to Primarily Primates, an animal center in San Antonio.

APPEAL ARGUED IN POSTPARTUM PSYCHOSIS CASE; 
</P>
<P>

MASSIP'S MURDER CONVICTION IN SON'S DEATH BUT DOUBT THAT THEY HAVE THE 
AUTHORITY TO REVERSE IT.

<P>
An Orange County prosecutor, seeking to overturn a judge's stunning 1988 
acquittal of an Anaheim housewife who ran over her infant son with the family 
car, told an appellate court Wednesday that judges cannot be allowed to run 
rampant over the law. 
</P>
<P>
Members of a three-justice appellate panel that heard oral arguments in the 
case of Sheryl Lynn Massip agreed that the judge may have abused his powers 
when he threw out a jury's second-degree murder verdict on the grounds that she 
had been suffering from postpartum psychosis at the time of the 1987 killing. 
</P>
<P>
But the justices on the 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana indicated 
that in trying to correct any possible mistakes, their hands may be tied -- 
both by statutes that limit their own authority and by the district attorney's 
failure to file appellate papers on time. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't the problem with this case that the trial court erred, but there's 
nothing we can do about it?" Justice Sheila P. Sonenshine asked at the very 
outset of the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"My reading of it," she added, "was that the trial court was wrong, but I'm not 
quite sure what we can do about it." 
</P>
<P>
The appellate court may decide the case within 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
Massip's attorney, Milton C. Grimes, countered that his client's acquittal was 
a fair and justifiable one that should be upheld by the court. He argued that 
to send Massip into confinement now, in the midst of her therapy, would 
essentially be a form of "harassment." 
</P>
<P>
Watching the candid and often vigorous courtroom exchange was Massip herself. 
Now 26, she has remarried and is working in Orange County as a hair stylist. 
She also is attending regular psychiatric therapy sessions to overcome 
occasional bouts with depression. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even understand really what's going on. The legalities -- it's all 
very complex to me," she said. "I would just like for it to all be over." 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging she could face incarceration if the appellate decision goes 
against her, Massip said: "I just don't know what to expect. It's sort of an 
in-limbo situation. . . . I just have a lot of faith in the Lord." 
</P>
<P>
It was 17 months ago that Massip, clutching a Bible, walked out a free woman 
from the Santa Ana courtroom of Superior Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald. 
Minutes earlier, the judge had stunned a packed court by refusing to recognize 
a jury's murder verdict and ruling instead that Massip was temporarily insane 
at the time she killed her son, suffering from a rare psychotic disorder that 
is an extreme form of the far more common "baby blues." 
</P>
<P>
Massip's emotional trial, featuring testimony from the embittered father who 
served the defendant with divorce papers while she sat in jail, showed she had 
first tried to throw her son into oncoming traffic, then hit him over the head 
with a blunt object and finally ran over him in the family Volvo in 1987, 
killing him. 
</P>
<P>
After acquitting Massip on grounds of insanity, Fitzgerald later ruled that 
Massip would not have to serve the six-month confinement in a state psychiatric 
ward that is customary for defendants acquitted by reason of insanity. Instead, 
he ordered her to report as an outpatient to county mental health facilities 
for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
In oral arguments before the appellate court Wednesday and in the legal briefs 
that preceded the hearing, Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas J. Borris argued that 
Fitzgerald erred not once, but twice, in overstepping his authority: first by 
illegitimately setting aside the jury's verdict and then again by foregoing the 
standard six-month psychiatric incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by the justices, Borris conceded that state statutes severely 
restrict a district attorney's ability to appeal an acquittal -- as well as an 
appellate court's prerogative to change such a decision. And he also apologized 
for his office's failure to file a writ with the court within the standard 60 
days following the acquittal -- an oversight that the justices said is often 
enough to get an appeal thrown out of court. 
</P>
<P>
Predicting the worst, Borris asserted that "in the long run, because of 
incompetence of counsel (by the district attorney's office), society is going 
to have to suffer." 
</P>
<P>
Arguing that the justices do have the power to overturn the acquittal, he said, 
"we can't let this (acquittal) stand as a precedent."

CLASSROOM, DIPLOMA SEPARATED BY 48 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nineteen-year-old Mitsuko Yasukochi Funakoshi was just two months shy of 
graduation in the spring of 1942, full of hope and ambition, when her world was 
torn in two. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-Japanese hysteria was still strong after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and 
the U.S. government ordered all people of Japanese ancestry to leave the West 
Coast. The young community college student was forced to abandon her textbooks 
and leave California with her family, prosperous Norwalk grocers who could take 
only what they could carry. 
</P>
<P>
Now, 48 years later, the 66-year-old secretary who commutes daily from 
Oceanside to Los Angeles City Hall, is about to see her dream of a college 
diploma come true. Next week, Fullerton College will award Funakoshi an 
associate of arts degree for her 3 1/2 semesters of work that ended abruptly 
that April, when she and 110,000 others of Japanese descent were forced to 
leave their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing makes my life more complete," said Funakoshi, an executive secretary 
in Los Angeles City Controller Rick Tuttle's office. "I feel a little like Rip 
Van Winkle . . . coming back to Fullerton (College) after all these years." 
</P>
<P>
She is just one of more than 17,000 students reaping the reward of their labors 
this spring in graduation ceremonies at more than a dozen Orange County 
colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton will honor about 5,800 students, its largest graduating 
class in history, this weekend at the university's 31st annual commencement 
exercises. Retiring CSUF President Jewel Plummer Cobb will be the keynote 
speaker as diplomas are awarded in eight separate ceremonies beginning Saturday 
at 9 a.m. and continuing at noon Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Also Sunday, Chapman College's 589 bachelor's and master's degree candidates 
will cap their years of effort with a speech by Warsaw University rector 
Andrzej K. Wroblewski. The invocation will be given by Crystal Cathedral's 
founding pastor, the Rev. Robert H. Schuller, whose daughter, Gretchen Penner, 
is one of the graduating seniors. 
</P>
<P>
And on June 16, UC Irvine Chancellor Jack Peltason will address the 
university's 25th anniversary class. The 4,486 bachelor's and graduate degree 
candidates will be honored in three separate ceremonies on the greensward of 
Aldrich Park. 
</P>
<P>
Christ College Irvine, a small liberal arts college in Irvine, kicked off this 
year's round of commencement exercises on May 19 at the Turtle Rock campus. 
Rancho Santiago College in Santa Ana was the first of eight Orange County 
community colleges to hold graduation ceremonies Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Funakoshi, once a business and arts major, will join 1,100 other graduates at 
Fullerton College's commencement June 1. About 76,000 men and women have been 
awarded degrees since the college was founded in 1913. But none has waited as 
long as she, school officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Now the self-effacing woman, known to family and friends as "Mitsie," will be 
delivering a short speech to the Class of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
She plans to tell the graduates what happened to her family and the lives of 
110,000 people of Japanese ancestry who were uprooted when President Franklin 
D. Roosevelt ordered them out of California, Oregon and Washington in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
She and her parents were lucky because they had friends in Colorado who 
welcomed them. Others were forced into bleak "relocation camps," where most 
lived until 1945. 
</P>
<P>
"We of different cultures need to work together, to help each other, and 
hopefully nothing like this will ever happen again," Funakoshi wrote in the 
short speech that she will deliver to fellow graduates. 
</P>
<P>
The first inkling of what was to come, Funakoshi said, were the curfews 
requiring Japanese-Americans to be indoors by 10 p.m. Then in April, her family 
hastily packed all they could carry in a truck and moved to Ft. Lupton, Colo., 
well away from the coastal military zone established by the government. 
</P>
<P>
"We just had to get rid of everything, even my school materials. My family 
said, 'We'll probably never come back again, so you won't need this stuff.' We 
just threw it away," she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
In Colorado, for the first time in her life, the girl worked in the fields 
alongside her mother, father and brothers picking sugar beets and Spanish 
onions. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a really strange feeling," she said. "But here we were, American 
citizens (who) didn't know any other country and we were being treated like 
enemies." 
</P>
<P>
Even as she labored at "some of the hardest, most backbreaking work I'd ever 
done," Funakoshi said, she thought about finishing school. She wrote to her 
college adviser, who sent her an open-book test to win credit for an associate 
of arts degree. 
</P>
<P>
But the books she needed had been thrown away in California. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, maybe I'll go to the library, go into Denver," she recalled. She 
gave up when she couldn't find the books. 
</P>
<P>
Years passed. She married, moved back to California, had a son and a daughter, 
and enjoyed a comfortable life with her husband, a furniture maker and 
garage-door installer. But the elusive diploma was never far from her mind. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, she mentioned the diploma while talking with the city controller. 
Tuttle's response: Why not write to the college president? Funakoshi told him 
she thought it would be of little use but he insisted, "No, write the letter." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, after Funakoshi had given up hearing from the college, she 
found a letter from college President Philip W. Borst. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing her grades of mostly A's and Bs, Borst concluded that had 
Funakoshi not been forced to leave in 1942, she undoubtedly would have 
graduated with her class that June. He invited her to attend commencement 
exercises, late but most welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Is she bitter about what she missed? 
</P>
<P>
"If this hadn't happened, you know, I probably would have gotten my degree and 
done something else with my life," Funakoshi, 66, said. "I know it was very 
hard for my parents . . . but you know, I've got a very positive attitude. 
These things have happened and I've gotten stronger. You've got to keep going. 
You can't be bitter about things."

AIRPORT PARKING GARAGE SEEMS TERMINALLY FULL; 
</P>
<P>
CONGESTION: ONLY THE LUCKY AND EARLY BIRDS MANAGE TO FIND A SLOT AT JOHN WAYNE 
MULTILEVEL GARAGE. SURROUNDING CONSTRUCTION HASSLES HAVEN'T HELPED MATTERS.

<P>
Steve Palmer simply wanted to jump on a jet Wednesday for a quick, one-day 
business trip to Las Vegas, but he ran into turbulence before he even got out 
of his Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
As Palmer pulled up to the parking structure at John Wayne Airport, he fixed 
his gaze on the sort of sign that sparks trepidation in the most steely of 
travelers: "Garage Parking Full." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer rolled down a window and an attendant handed him a map showing a 
roundabout route to the airport's long-term parking lots, located on the far 
side of the San Diego Freeway. This was going to be one of those days, he 
thought. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this parking situation is a mess," Palmer said before roaring off to 
find a safe haven for his car. "This is a total disruption." 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the parking follies at Orange County's John Wayne Airport. As it has 
been for several years, the task of gleaning a parking slot at the local 
airport can be a daunting pursuit. And with the summer tourist season set to 
begin in earnest with the upcoming Memorial Day weekend, the monumental 
motoring mess at John Wayne promises only to get worse. 
</P>
<P>
Matters haven't been helped any by the high-level tussle over construction 
delays plaguing the long-awaited passenger terminal on the airport's northern 
side. When completed, the new terminal will include enough parking stalls to 
quadruple the present capacity. But a variety of snafus have delayed the grand 
opening, originally scheduled for April, until late September. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people here would agree the present parking situation is not perfect," 
acknowledged Courtney Wiercioch, special projects chief at John Wayne Airport. 
"We're in the middle of a construction project. I think we all expected there 
would be some inconvenience during the process. We would hope that people would 
bear with us." 
</P>
<P>
Bear with it they must. Under the existing setup, motorists must vie for one of 
the 1,600 parking spaces available in the lone parking structure within walking 
distance of the airport. Far more plentiful parking is available in two 
long-term lots north of the freeway, but passengers must board a shuttle bus to 
get to their appointed airline. 
</P>
<P>
Wiercioch and other airport officials recommend that anyone planning to park 
for more than a few hours take time to drive to the long-term lots and ride the 
shuttle to the airport, a five-minute trip during light traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Another tip is to hunt for a spot in a surface lot on the south side of the 
existing terminal. The lot features coin-operated meters, and is often 
overlooked by motorists dashing along the airport's loop road. 
</P>
<P>
With summer fast approaching, however, that sort of oasis will likely disappear 
during all but the slowest hours of the day. Memorial Day weekend is just the 
start. Last year, more than 45,000 passengers flooded the boarding gates during 
the holiday, but the weekend total jumped to an average of about 56,000 during 
the three subsequent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Even on Wednesday, an otherwise slow day, the airport's main parking structure 
was full by 10 a.m., forcing authorities to post a sign warning motorists to 
look elsewhere. Parking attendants advised drivers of the various options and 
handed them maps to the long-term lots. 
</P>
<P>
Some motorists rolled their eyes and accepted their fate. Others stomped on the 
accelerator and shouted curses. 
</P>
<P>
"They're really upset," noted parking attendant Norma Mota as she handed out 
maps to motorists. "They want to park close to the airport. Some really cuss us 
out." 
</P>
<P>
The parking problem at the structure is nothing unusual, she said. It is full 
most days by the late morning and typically stays that way until mid-afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Just getting to the parking lot or terminal can become a taxing journey. The 
airport now has only one main entrance off MacArthur Boulevard, and the cars 
queue up during busy hours for hundreds of yards as motorists jockey for 
position to drop off passengers. Completion of the new terminal will usher in 
the use of new ramps leading from the San Diego Freeway directly into the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
Even the parking structure can become gripped by gridlock. One woman recently 
reported being stuck in traffic inside the four-level structure for almost a 
half hour after returning on a Friday evening flight. 
</P>
<P>
Mike and Lois Demianew thought they might spend a half hour Wednesday morning 
just looking for a parking space. The retired Anaheim couple, there to drop off 
her sister for a flight back to Seattle, hurried into the parking structure 
just minutes before attendants decided to close it down to additional traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The husband wheeled his Cadillac around one level, then the next, then the 
next, all to no avail. Finally the car lumbered into the open sunlight of the 
top deck. After trundling around the perimeter of the lot, the couple spotted 
one of the last parking stalls left unoccupied. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to use a half tank of gas going around here," Mike said in 
frustration. "This is terrible." 
</P>
<P>
Lois nodded in agreement. "If the new airport ever opens up, it will be nice," 
she said. "But right now, this is a mess."

MEEHAN TO RETIRE AS CHIEF OF POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Police Chief Ronald D. Meehan announced his retirement Wednesday after serving 
almost 30 years with the La Habra Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just going on to other things," said Meehan, 54. 
</P>
<P>
"After close to 30 years, it's time for me to go. I'm looking forward to a new 
career." 
</P>
<P>
He hasn't quite decided yet what that career will be, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meehan will officially retire July 13, but he has agreed to remain in the 
chief's job during the city's search for a replacement, City Manager Lee Risner 
said. Meehan will also be asked to stay on a few additional months as a 
consultant on non-police matters. 
</P>
<P>
"I have some things coming up and I think I'd like to use his expertise for a 
while," Risner said. "It fits his schedule and it certainly fits ours." 
</P>
<P>
Risner has worked with Meehan for about 20 years and appointed him police chief 
in 1975 when Meehan was a captain. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm losing a longtime, close associate," Risner said. 
</P>
<P>
Meehan, a Placentia resident, joined the La Habra department in 1960 as a 
patrol officer and once served as the department's vice officer, patrolling 
local bars. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave him a budget of $10 a month and told him not to spend it all in one 
place," Risner said. 
</P>
<P>
Of "all the things that have happened during my tenure," Meehan said, "the one 
that is closest to my heart is the implementation of the (school-based, 
anti-drug) DARE program. It has the potential for having the greatest impact in 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
Risner said the city has "made it plain we'll appoint the person most qualified 
for the job" to replace Meehan, "although the last three chiefs were named from 
within the department." TOM McQUEENEY

TILE EXPOSITION'S BID TO USE HALL DENIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge on Wednesday denied a tile exposition's request to use a nearly 
completed Anaheim Convention Center exhibit hall for a June show. 
</P>
<P>
International Tile Exposition, which recently sued Anaheim over construction 
delays at the center, wanted permission to set up structures in the unfinished 
exhibit hall rather than split the exhibit between two areas. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Guilford, an attorney for ITE, said the show's coordinators plan to 
continue the suit against the city for damages resulting from the unusable 
hall. The city maintains that the building will not be ready for use, and it 
foresees no out-of-court settlement in the case, said Lou Anne Merritt-Mc Lean, 
an assistant city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion of the convention center was to have been completed in February 
but is now slated for July.

RECYCLING CENTER ON POLLUTED SITE URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As part of an effort to develop 40 acres of city-owned land partly contaminated 
with high levels of methane, Mayor Thomas J. Mays on Wednesday unveiled a 
proposal for a mobile recycling center on the site. 
</P>
<P>
Mays is championing an offer made this week by a Chino-based firm to establish 
a facility -- at no cost to the city -- to reuse wood and concrete waste from 
redevelopment projects, tree trimming and other work. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona Valley Environmental Inc. would use part of its income from reselling 
the materials to pay the estimated $4-million cost of setting up the center and 
all future operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
The city would also receive a percentage of the firm's revenues, which Mays 
said would probably average about $400,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
The recycling center would incorporate the wood shredder and concrete crusher 
the firm is now using in clearing the abandoned Ocean View Mushroom Farm next 
to the methane-plagued site. The proposed facility, which city staff officials 
are studying, would use five acres of a 17.6-acre parcel, a former Orange 
County dump site extending along Talbert Avenue from Golden West Avenue to 
Gothard Avenue, which a city-hired consultant reported last month is highly 
contaminated with methane gas. 
</P>
<P>
That discovery jeopardized city plans to build a golf course there and relocate 
nearby mobile home residents to the site, since state law prohibits the 
construction of new residences within 600 feet of a methane-contaminated site. 
</P>
<P>
Mitigating the problem would cost nearly $7 million, according to the report. 
But for a recycling facility, the methane dilemma could be solved for about 
$1.2 million, the study said. JOHN PENNER

LOS ALAMITOS SUES CYPRESS OVER PROJECT

<P>
Los Alamitos sued the city of Cypress on Wednesday over a report that concluded 
that a proposed business park on the border of the two cities would have little 
impact on Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
The developer of the 75-acre business park project, Cypress Development 
Partnership, was named as a co-defendant in the lawsuit filed in Orange County 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
No hearing date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
The development -- dubbed the Cypress Business and Professional Center and next 
to the Los Alamitos Race Track -- in part abuts Katella Avenue, a major 
thoroughfare through Los Alamitos that would be the development's most direct 
link to a nearby freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos wants Cypress and the project developer to pay for street 
maintenance and improvements along Katella Avenue because of the development's 
impact, Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos City Atty. Thomas W. Allen said an environmental impact report 
prepared for the city of Cypress did not adequately address the impact the 
development would have on his city. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of the traffic that goes to the race track now passes through Los 
Alamitos," he said. "And it is probable that the majority of the traffic going 
to the business park would also pass along Katella to I-605 (San Gabriel River 
Freeway)." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit does not specify how much money Los Alamitos wants. However, 
Cypress Mayor Cecilia L. Age said Los Alamitos asked for $2.8 million from 
Cypress.KATHIE BOZANICH and LYNDA NATALI

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ZONING PROPOSAL TO GET MORE STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a public hearing on zoning proposals that could change the character of 
two historic Old Towne neighborhoods, the Planning Commission voted unanimously 
to further study the issue and tour the areas. 
</P>
<P>
Despite land-use studies and four public workshops this spring, plus 
discussions on the future of the Cypress Street and Santa Fe Railroad Depot 
neighborhoods, the commissioners agreed that further study is needed before 
they can make a recommendation to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
City officials want to rezone the Cypress Street area to make it consistent 
with the Orange General Plan. Part of the six-block area of mostly 
single-family homes is now zoned to allow four or more units per lot, but is 
designated for three units per lot in the General Plan. The commission is 
considering proposals that will allow two, three and four units per lot. 
</P>
<P>
The commission is also considering plans to change the Railroad Depot area from 
a light industrial to a residential and limited-business district. Another 
public hearing is scheduled June 18.MARY HELEN BERG

STATE PLANS TO STEP UP UCI MEDI-CAL INQUIRY; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH CARE: ALLEGATIONS THAT SOME PATIENTS MUST WAIT FOR MONTHS FOR ELECTIVE 
SURGERY WILL BE PURSUED OVER THE NEXT TWO WEEKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
State health officials decided Wednesday to broaden an inquiry into claims that 
UCI Medical Center discriminates against Medi-Cal patients by delaying their 
elective surgeries for up to six months. 
</P>
<P>
Sally Lee, chief of Medi-Cal operations, said the medical center's executive 
director, Mary Piccione, pledged during a two-hour meeting in Sacramento that 
"they do not discriminate." 
</P>
<P>
But determined to resolve the question for good, Lee said that doctors and 
nurses on her staff will spend the next two weeks pulling records and studying 
a wide sample of cases from every clinic that sends private and Medi-Cal 
patients to UCI operating rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this spring, one of Lee's doctors inspected files of 21 Medi-Cal 
orthopedic surgery cases from last November to January and determined that 
those operations had been delayed from two to six months. Meanwhile, Lee and 
several UCI doctors have said, patients with private insurance who also needed 
hip replacements or similar surgeries were operated on within a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Some UCI doctors also claim that Medi-Cal patients face long waits for any kind 
of surgery, not just orthopedic procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Lee so far has only documented a problem in orthopedics. And, she conceded this 
week, her earlier study was not random but rather "a sample of only problem 
cases." So now, she said, her staff will take a broader sample. 
</P>
<P>
If a policy of discrimination is confirmed, Lee has threatened to take the 
issue before the UC Board of Regents, ask legislative committees to 
investigate, or cancel the hospital's Medi-Cal contract. The latter action is 
unlikely, however, since the medical center in Orange handles 60% of the 
county's Medi-Cal patients. 
</P>
<P>
Piccione and UC attorney John Lundberg, who accompanied her to the meeting in 
Sacramento, could not be reached for comment late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the Special 
Committee on Medi-Cal Oversight, expressed concern about the claims of 
discrimination at UCI's hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"The practice of treating county indigent and Medi-Cal patients in a separate 
and less-accommodating manner than those who are insured is an outrageous and 
indefensible practice," he said. "They shouldn't tag people Medi-Cal at the 
front door and give them second-class care. . . . If you can't get your 
procedures done and wait months with chronic pain, you're being given 
substandard care." 
</P>
<P>
Margolin said he will be looking into the matter further and may hold a special 
hearing into the medical center's conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the decision to broaden the inquiry at UCI, Lee described her meeting 
with Piccione as amicable. 
</P>
<P>
She said they reached agreement on the Medi-Cal reimbursement rate for UCI's 
proposed birthing center for low-risk deliveries. She added that she had 
expected to spend six months working out details but now expects a contract to 
be signed within a month. 
</P>
<P>
Further, Lee said, she and Piccione discussed the Medi-Cal system in Orange 
County -- how more doctors and hospitals are needed to care for the poor and 
how the county should provide "general primary care" clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the meeting, Lee said, Piccione "was not confrontational. She looked 
kind of tired. She feels constantly badgered. Criticism is cheap. Ideas are not 
and everybody is first to criticize."

CABLE TV COMPANIES SUE COUNTY ASSESSOR OVER INCREASES IN TAXES; 
</P>
<P>
ASSESSMENTS: JACOBS IS ACCUSED OF A 'VENDETTA' THAT WILL BOOST CUSTOMER PRICES 
AND COST TAXPAYERS. THE ASSESSOR SAYS HE'S FOLLOWING THE LEAD OF OTHER 
COUNTIES.

<P>
Seeking at least $13 million in damages, 10 Orange County cable TV operators 
sued Assessor Bradley L. Jacobs Wednesday, accusing him of waging a "vendetta" 
against them by charging illegally high taxes that will boost customer prices 
and cost taxpayers millions more in legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
Cable representatives warned that the suit, filed in Orange County Superior 
Court, could drag on for six years and end up forcing the county to pay $50 
million to $75 million in damages, costs and backtaxes. 
</P>
<P>
Through Deputy Assessor Ron Cooper, Jacobs declined comment on the suit. But 
Jacobs, who is running for reelection in June, defended his assessments in a 
campaign statement earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to see that no one gets special treatment just because they have a 
lot of money to throw around," Jacobs said, in a reference to a massive media 
blitz that the cable industry has undertaken to drum up public opposition to 
the taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs has said he is only following the lead of several other California 
counties that have initiated similar assessment methods to more accurately 
reflect the soaring value of cable properties. But the companies say no other 
assessor has done it as aggressively as Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
While expressing confidence in their case at a news conference Wednesday, cable 
representatives have continued a behind-the-scenes effort to enlist the Board 
of Supervisors in an arm-twisting campaign against Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Roger R. Stanton confirmed in an interview that industry 
representatives met with him for an hour last Friday, urging that the board 
deny Jacobs the legal fees necessary to defend against the suit. The 
representatives met with the other four supervisors in a series of private 
meetings earlier this month. (Although the assessor is an independent 
constitutional officer, the supervisors approve his budget.) 
</P>
<P>
Cable spokesman John Gibbs described the lobbying effort as "simply pragmatic" 
and said it had nothing to do with the strength of the industry's case. The 10 
companies allege that their tax bills climbed from a total of $2.5 million last 
year to $13.5 million this year because of a new -- and unconstitutional -- 
method of assessing their properties. 
</P>
<P>
"We will prevail . . . , " Gibbs said, but added, "I think if they hire a law 
firm and pay them a million or more we will be doing this for at least six more 
years. We'll be litigating this forever." 
</P>
<P>
Stanton said he told cable representatives during their private meeting that it 
would be "absurd" to deny legal fees to Jacobs after paying to defend numerous 
lawsuits against other elected officials, such as Sheriff Brad Gates. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the sudden we don't do it with Jacobs? Do you have any idea how that 
would look?" Stanton said he told them. "As a citizen I would be outraged that 
the board is favoring one industry." 
</P>
<P>
As for the industry's public relations campaign, which has consisted of 
full-page newspaper ads and thousands of mailers urging residents to complain 
to the supervisors, Stanton dismissed it as "nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
At issue in the legal battle is a method of computing the tax value of a cable 
company's property, including buildings, equipment, cable lines and public 
rights of way granted by the county to lay those lines. 
</P>
<P>
Under Jacob's new assessment method, the county now also considers how a cable 
company's value is enhanced by its exclusive franchise to provide service to an 
area. 
</P>
<P>
The county contends that, mostly because of that franchise, the cable companies 
have tripled or quadrupled in market value since the late 1970s, as reflected 
in the selling prices of companies that have changed ownership in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The industry contends that company values have soared largely because of 
intangibles, such as business enterprise and community goodwill engendered by 
good service.

HIGHEST TIDES OF YEAR TO HIT COUNTY BEACHES THIS WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The highest tides of the year will wash ashore on Orange County beaches this 
week, but because of mild surf and weather conditions no serious damage is 
expected and only minor precautions are being taken, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Lifeguards said they will patrol the beaches and monitor the surf but will not 
set up sandbags or retaining walls to impede the encroaching tide. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach has closed storm drains on Balboa Peninsula to prevent backwash 
from flowing into the bay, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Some flooding might occur in Sunset Beach and Balboa Peninsula, but the damage 
is expected to be minimal. "We're not too worried about these tides," 
Huntington Beach Lifeguard Mike Bartlett said. 
</P>
<P>
Two forces are coming together to cause the unusually high "spring tides," said 
meteorologist Coralie Cushny of WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for 
The Times. First, there is a new moon which naturally draws the water level 
higher, and second, the moon is nearest to the Earth in its rotation of the 
Earth -- a phenomenon called perigee, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In Newport Beach the predicted high tides are: 
</P>
<P>
Today, 9:31 p.m., 6.8 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, 10:17 p.m., 6.9 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, 11:09 p.m., 6.2 feet. 
</P>
<P>
In San Clemente the predicted high tides are: 
</P>
<P>
Today, 9:29 p.m., 6.9 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, 10:16 p.m., 6.7 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, 11:06 p.m., 6.3 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The previous highest tides occurred Jan 10., when the earth was at perihelion, 
the point nearest the sun in its orbit. Tide was 6.7 feet in Newport Beach and 
6.8 in San Clemente. Figures for Huntington Beach were unavailable.

RAM DEFENSIVE SHUFFLE HINGES ON HUMPHERY; 
</P>
<P>
NFL: IF THE FORMER NEW YORK JET CAN HANDLE THE CORNER, JERRY GRAY WILL BE MOVED 
TO FREE SAFETY.

<TEXT>
<P>
In case you have a shorter memory than Fritz Shurmur, the Rams were dead last 
in the NFL in pass defense last season. Shurmur, the Rams' defensive 
coordinator, had to watch as one of the league's best passing offenses shot 
holes in his secondary during practice all week, then had to bear much of the 
same Sunday before facing the onslaught of instant replays in the film room. 
</P>
<P>
Shurmur is hardly the only one in the Ram organization who's determined there 
won't be a repeat performance in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The grand scheme hinges on moving cornerback Jerry Gray to free safety, where 
he will be free to wreak havoc at will, like San Francisco 49er Ronnie Lott. 
The Rams are confident Gray can do the job, the question is whether or not they 
can afford to move him out of the cornerback spot. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Humphery, the veteran cornerback the Rams acquired from the New York Jets 
on the first day of the draft for a fifth-round choice, says not to worry. He 
says he can help increase the efficiency of the Rams' zone defense and ease his 
new coaches into a comfort zone at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Heck, he's already making an impact. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Coach John Robinson: "We're very pleased with what we've seen so far." 
</P>
<P>
Said Shurmur: "We are absolutely elated with the way he's performing." 
</P>
<P>
Humphery may have been inexpensive, but this was not a capricious, 
Let's-Make-a-Deal move by the Rams. They spent more time in the film room than 
a movie mogul. 
</P>
<P>
After the trade, Dick Steinberg, the Jets' new general manager, said Humphery 
was a player who had peaked. But the Rams scoffed at that; they figured they 
knew a lot more about Humphery than a GM who'd been on the job for three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to be certain when we made the call to try and get him that we knew 
what we were getting," Shurmur said. "And we haven't been a bit disappointed. I 
observe him out there and see the vast strides he's made in learning our system 
already, and I can't find any area in which we're disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"We finished the season with a hole. LeRoy (Irvin) was leaving and we had some 
young corners who had to develop quickly. We were uncertain. We were looking 
for a guy who knew how to play corner, a player for our young guys to look at 
and see how it's done." 
</P>
<P>
Humphery played a lot of bump-and-run, man-to-man defense in New York and is 
having to adjust to the Rams' zone-oriented defense. Shurmur says it's much 
easier to make the transition from man to zone than the other way around, but 
Humphery isn't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I think it's harder to go from man-to-man to zone," he said. "Now, 
you're playing an area instead of a person. You have to get to an area and know 
how to protect that area instead of just following a man anywhere he goes. But 
I think it's a pretty small transition. It's not a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson says the Rams might be willing to meet Humphery halfway, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"He's working on learning right now," Robinson said, "but we will adapt our 
style to fit his a little, too, I'm sure." 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Humphery just wants to prove he belongs. In the fall, however, 
he'll be trying to send a message back East. 
</P>
<P>
"First, I just want to make sure the coaches are comfortable with putting me at 
left corner and show the guys on this team that I deserve to be a part of it," 
Humphery said. "But there is another challenge that I welcome. I want to come 
out here and prove to some people out in New York that I can still play." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, of course, are counting on it. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Rick Johnson, signed by the Rams Wednesday, admits that he's "an 
absolute longshot" to hang on with the team, but said he was going to stay in 
the L.A. area and retire from football to pursue an acting career, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had three movie roles and a spot on 'Dallas,' and I wasn't going to go 
back to Canada," said Johnson, who played the past five seasons in the Canadian 
Football League after spending two years in the USFL. 
</P>
<P>
He also said his acting career had taught him a lesson about persevering in the 
face of overwhelming odds. 
</P>
<P>
"The deck is stacked, but I won't let it get me down," Johnson said. "And I 
have a little extra incentive here, too. Chuck Long and I went to the same high 
school (Wheaton North in Chicago) and every time I go back there, all I hear 
about is Chuck Long, Chuck Long. They even have a Chuck Long Day at the high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the first guy from that school to make it to the pros, even if it was 
only the USFL. Chuck graduated two years after me." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson figures to lose out to Long and/or Mark Herrmann in the battle for the 
job as Jim Everett's understudy, but maybe his role as Roger the masseur in 
"Dallas" will be revived. 
</P>
<P>
The only J.R. around Rams Camp, of course, is John Robinson, and it didn't take 
Johnson much time to find out who's the leading man in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to list his strengths as a quarterback, Johnson said, "I have a quick 
release and I used to think I had a strong arm . . . until I saw Jim Everett 
throw today."

BLUE JAYS: JOHN OLERUD, WHO RECOVERED FROM BRAIN SURGERY, SEEMS UNFAZED BY HIS 
JUMP FROM COLLEGE BALL TO THE MAJORS.

<P>
The pressure suddenly thrust upon a 21-year-old making the jump from college 
baseball to the major leagues can be formidable, but John Olerud, Toronto Blue 
Jays rookie, seems unfazed by it all. 
</P>
<P>
When you've sat in an operating room wondering if you'll survive surgery to 
remove a brain aneurysm, contemplating whether you'll live to see another 
fastball down the heart of the plate, what's a little transition from 
All-American to the American League? 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of pressure, and you want to do well so you can stay here," says 
Olerud, the Blue Jays' part-time designated hitter and backup first baseman. 
"But at the same time, you have to realize it's not the end of the world if 
things don't work out." 
</P>
<P>
Olerud came dangerously close to the end of his world on Jan. 11, 1989. Jogging 
with a teammate in Washington State's Hollinberry Fieldhouse, Olerud collapsed, 
the victim of a brain seizure. 
</P>
<P>
He was diagnosed as having a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which caused bleeding 
into the spinal column. In simple terms, Olerud called it "a leak in my head 
that kind of patched itself up." 
</P>
<P>
Olerud remained in a hospital for about two weeks after the seizure. He lost 15 
pounds but felt good and was back in class by the end of January. Olerud, 
Baseball America's NCAA Player of the Year in 1988, suffered no brain damage 
and wasn't expecting to miss any of the 1989 season. 
</P>
<P>
"He beat the odds tremendously," Dr. Scott Carlson, a Spokane, Wash., 
neurologist, said at the time. "He's probably not going to have any problems at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
Carlson was wrong. About a month later, doctors discovered an aneurysm at the 
base of Olerud's brain, placing him in a life-threatening situation. He 
underwent surgery to remove it Feb. 27, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Two months later, Olerud joined the Washington State baseball team for his 
junior season. 
</P>
<P>
A little more than six months later, Olerud was in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel lucky to have made it through all that," said Olerud, a 6-foot-5, 
205-pound left-hander who also was an outstanding pitcher in college. "When I 
first had the hemorrhage, I made it through, and after they found the aneurysm, 
surgery was successful. When I look back on it, I'm a little more appreciative 
of things." 
</P>
<P>
Olerud, who likely will be in the lineup tonight when Toronto concludes its 
two-game series against the Angels, says he hasn't felt any ill effects from 
his brain problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I made it through surgery, I could see clearly and move everything all 
right," he said. "I figured playing again was just a matter of getting my 
strength back. It wasn't like knee surgery or arm surgery, where you wonder if 
you'll run or throw the same. All the problems were in my head." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors told Olerud he could run and throw and take batting practice as soon as 
he felt up to it. 
</P>
<P>
Olerud didn't waste any time, beginning a training regimen one month after the 
surgery. He joined the baseball team April 15 and played 27 games, batting .359 
with five home runs and 30 runs batted in. As a pitcher, he went 3-2 with a 
6.68 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
Olerud, projected as a first-round pick going into his junior year, wasn't 
nearly the player he was as a sophomore, when he set Washington State records 
for batting average (.464), hits (108), home runs (23), pitching victories (15) 
and strikeouts (113). 
</P>
<P>
So he informed scouts that he would be staying in college for his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
"My intentions were to go back to school, get my strength back and show people 
that I was the same player they saw in 1988," Olerud said. "I told them that 
first-round (bonus) money wasn't going to be enough to get me." 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays still took a chance on Olerud, picking him on the third round of 
the June draft. Olerud, though, wasn't interested, and went to Alaska to play 
summer ball. 
</P>
<P>
But by late August, Toronto had increased its package to include a signing 
bonus reported to be in excess of $250,000 and an $800,000 contract through the 
1991 season -- $300,000 more a year than the major league minimum salary. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the Blue Jays were in the middle of a pennant race, and 
front-office officials assured Olerud he would report directly to Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
"They made me an offer that was too good to pass up," Olerud said. "I had an 
opportunity to be in a pennant race, and that's something a lot of great 
players never experience." 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 3, Olerud became the 15th player since the start of the amateur free 
agent draft in 1965 to make his debut in the major leagues, and he singled 
against the Minnesota Twins. He appeared in six games last September, getting 
three hits in eight at-bats for a .375 average. He was not eligible for 
Toronto's American League Championship Series against the Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Olerud is platooning with Glenallen Hill at designated hitter and 
backing up Fred McGriff at first base. Olerud has played in 33 games, batting 
.250 with four home runs and 13 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
His strikeout total (21 in 100 at-bats) has been high, but Olerud has still 
impressed his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"He has unbelievable ability," Toronto catcher Pat Borders said. "It makes me 
mad, because I work so hard and I could never have a swing as nice as his. He 
reminds you of Wade Boggs -- he has a super eye and a great swing. Everything 
is so compact, it's hard to make him look bad on any pitch." 
</P>
<P>
Borders also is impressed with the way Olerud has handled all of the media 
attention and the pressure of being a rookie in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing fazes him," Borders said. "He's still the same person he was when he 
got here. He's very shy and not cocky about his ability. His head is screwed on 
straight." 
</P>
<P>
Every once in a while, there are thoughts of that fateful January day in 1989, 
when he lay sprawled on the Hollinberry Fieldhouse track. But Olerud doesn't 
let those memories consume him. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes when I'm working out or running on the back roads, I wonder if I'm 
going to collapse like I did before," Olerud said. "But I don't think about 
that everyday. Just occasionally."

THRASHER'S CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT CAPS A SENIOR YEAR OF IMPROVEMENT

<P>
In the span of several hours Friday night, Susannah Thrasher won a Southern 
Section track title, taking six seconds off her career-best time in the 
process, and was named queen of her senior prom at Villa Park High School. 
</P>
<P>
A magical evening, to be sure. 
</P>
<P>
Thrasher had not expected to be named prom queen, but the track title -- the 
3-A 1,600 meters -- was a bit less surprising, considering it was something 
Thrasher had been working toward for the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
"Just thinking about it now I'm still surprised I could even get that," 
Thrasher said Tuesday of her victory. "I didn't consider myself able to do 
that, but as the weeks went on, I started thinking, well, maybe I do have a 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
Thrasher's chances of winning the 1,600 title in the Southern Section Masters 
meet Friday at Cerritos College are slim; she has the sixth-fastest time of the 
nine entrants. More realistically, Thrasher hopes to finish among the top five, 
which would qualify her for the state meet, June 1-2 at Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
Among those entered in the Masters 1,600 are Edison sophomore Shelley Taylor, 
who won the 4-A title in 4 minutes 59.17 seconds; Agoura's Deena Drossin, the 
1-A winner in 4:58.73, and South Hills' Karen Hecox, the 2-A champ (4:52.38) 
and race favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Thrasher -- her name was listed as "Thrashed" in the Southern Section meet 
program -- won the 3-A race in 5:02.10. Her previous best was 5:08.07. 
</P>
<P>
"I went out hard in the beginning. I wanted to get a decent time to qualify for 
Masters," she said. "(Mater Dei's Kelly) Flathers was with me, right on my tail 
with a gun lap to go. . . . I started my kick (but) eventually I didn't hear 
her." 
</P>
<P>
Even though Thrasher has not broken five minutes for the mile, she is pleased 
with her accomplishments during her senior year. During the previous two years, 
she was a good -- but never a great -- high school runner. 
</P>
<P>
During cross-country last fall, Thrasher was undefeated in the Century League 
and finished a surprising sixth at the state championships. 
</P>
<P>
In April, she finished fifth in the 1,600 at the prestigious Arcadia 
Invitational. Her time of 5:08.07 -- she hadn't run faster than 5:20 as a 
junior -- was an indication of her improvement. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, Thrasher will be competing for UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just really enjoyed the competition this year. It's fun for me," Thrasher 
said. "I get nervous for the big (invitational) meets, but for something like 
Arcadia I wasn't. It's just an honor to be there." 
</P>
<P>
Masters notes 
</P>
<P>
The meet starts with the field events at 5:30 p.m. The first running event, the 
girls' 400-meter relay, starts at 7. The final event, the boys' 1,600 relay, is 
scheduled for 9:10. . . . One of the county's best showdowns will be in the 
boys' 100 and 200 with San Clemente's Tim Martin and Los Alamitos' Erik 
Mitchell. The last time the two met was in the 100 final at the Orange County 
Championships March 24. Mitchell beat Martin, 10.71 to 10.93 in that meet. . . 
. Also, in the girls' 1,600 relay, Esperanza (3:55.36), Woodbridge (3:56.34) 
and Mission Viejo (3:57.47) will continue their traditional county battle. . . 
. Edison's Shelley Taylor, who won the 4-A 800 and 1,600 last week, has dropped 
out of the 800 to concentrate on the 1,600. . . . Other top county boys' 
entrants include Magnolia's Phouphet Singbandith (long jump, triple jump), 
Esperanza's Roshawn Sims (400), El Modena's Mike Terry (800), Saddleback's 
Robby Price (3,200), El Toro's Dave Fair (300 hurdles), Esperanza's Mark Parlin 
(shotput), University's Af Haghighi and Loara's Albert Avila (discus), and 
Capistrano Valley's Tyson Jacobsen (pole vault). . . . Other top county girls 
include Woodbridge's Kaci Keffer (400, 300 hurdles), La Quinta freshman Elinor 
Tolson (both hurdles), Katella's Martha Pinto (3,200) and Donna Mills (800), 
Estancia's Debbie Hargrove (discus), and Mission Viejo's Allison Axtell (long 
jump), Lisa Fager and Tammy Graham (triple jump) and Kristin Dunn (shotput).

KENNEDY'S LONGEWAY GETS LOTS OF ASSISTANCE

Cheryl Longeway struggled, but the Kennedy High School pitcher got plenty of 
support in the field and at the plate in a 6-1 victory over Valencia in the 
second round of the Southern Section 4-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy (23-3-1) will meet Villa Park (15-10-1), a 1-0 winner in 11 innings 
over Rolling Hills Tuesday, in the quarterfinals Friday at a site to be 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
Longeway (19-3-1) struck out only two batters, gave up three hits, threw two 
wild pitches and walked one. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia (18-9) continually put the ball in play, but the Kennedy defense was 
flawless. 
</P>
<P>
On offense, the Fighting Irish teed off on Valencia'sNatasha Dumoski for nine 
hits, including five in a five-run fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that today was a good day to show how good our team was," Kennedy Coach 
Sue Hall said. "The team backed Cheryl up real well. A couple of girls dove and 
stole a couple of hits. A few girls got hits who haven't been getting hits 
lately and it was a total team effort. It wasn't 'Rely on Cheryl.' " 
</P>
<P>
A good thing, because Longeway struggled. 
</P>
<P>
"She was throwing something that was coming in low on the ground," Hall said. 
"I was asking her if she was trying to bowl a strike." 
</P>
<P>
It was Longeway's wild pitches that brought home Valencia's only run, in the 
bottom of the fourth. Stephanie Ritchey singled, advanced to second on a wild 
pitch, took third on Roseanna Garcia's ground out to short, then came home an 
out later on Longeway's second wild pitch of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get into a (runner-at-third) situation like that you kind of pump 
up," Longeway said. "I wanted to emphasize the pitches (that were) working and 
it didn't come out that way. My rise ball sometimes curves out instead of up 
and that is pretty much what happened when I tried to over-emphasize the rise." 
</P>
<P>
Longeway, who led Kennedy to the section title two years ago as a freshman, had 
no explanation for her current problem. She was adamant that it was not a tired 
pitching arm. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what's wrong with me," Longeway said. "Maybe my nerves are 
getting to me or something. My arm feels fine. I'm just pitching slow." 
</P>
<P>
Hall was unfazed. "She is not throwing like she can, but I'm not worried," Hall 
said. "She buckles down when she has to . . . If we're going to lose, we're 
going to lose as a team, not because of Cheryl." 
</P>
<P>
Longeway helped herself at the plate with two walks, two singles, a run scored 
and an RBI. Kennedy's Andrina Hustead also had two hits and scored a run in the 
third with the help of two Valencia errors. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia's Stephanie McDiarmid had a triple in the bottom of the sixth, but was 
stranded. 
</P>
<P>
"They made the contact, and we couldn't get any offense generated to make the 
big play for ourselves," Valencia Coach Debbie Fassel said. "I told the kids 
they had nothing to be ashamed of. We just couldn't get any hitting going. I 
would have liked to have had that triple with some runners on." 
</P>
<P>
In other 4-A games: 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove 9, San Marcos 1 -- Stephanie Smith pitched a four-hitter and had 
three hits, three RBIs and scored twice to lead Garden Grove (23-4-1). Celeste 
Gordon had two hits and scored, Michelle Cash had two hits and two RBIs and 
Becky Eggers had two hits, a run scored and an RBI for the Argonauts. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna 1, Glendale 0 -- Savanna was outhit, 4-2, but scored in the second to 
win at Glendale. Jackie Boxley hit a sacrifice fly and Leigh Sager pitched her 
seventh shutout for Savanna.

BUENA PARK'S WYMAN SAVES BEST FOR LAST

<P>
Denise Wyman doesn't mind being near the bottom of the Buena Park High School 
softball team's lineup. She says batting eighth helps her get a feel for the 
opposing pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, Wyman watched as Crescenta Valley pitcher Becki Mixon frustrated 
Buena Park batters for six innings of a Southern Section 4-A second-round 
playoff game. Wyman's single in the third inning was Buena Park's first hit. 
</P>
<P>
In the bottom of the seventh, Wyman got the Coyotes' last hit, a bases-loaded 
single that gave Buena Park a 1-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park (18-3-1) advances to the quarterfinals Friday against Charter Oak 
(19-4), a 5-4 winner Wednesday over Buena. 
</P>
<P>
"(Wyman) has been inconsistent -- that's why she's down there," Buena Park 
Coach Brenda Sapp said. "But I know she can hit. Her batting average isn't as 
high as it should be, but she's gotten some key hits for us." 
</P>
<P>
But none as important as Wyman's hit in the seventh Wednesday. Mixon, who 
finished the season 24-3, walked Kari Escobedo to open the inning. Robin Thorn 
followed with a ground ball to second baseman Alysia Kline, whose throw to 
second was too late to get Escobedo. 
</P>
<P>
Tara Glenn bunted the runners to second and third, and Christina Urban was 
intentionally walked. Wyman followed with her game-winning hit, a line drive to 
right-center field. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park pitcher Shannon Akau struck out five of the first eight Crescenta 
Valley batters before giving up her first hit of the game in the third inning, 
when Kline bunted safely with two outs. Akau, who struck out nine and didn't 
walk a batter, allowed only four singles -- all with two out -- in raising her 
record to 17-3. No Crescenta Valley runner made it to second base. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want to be on a team that had to hit against Shannon," Wyman said. 
"We hit against her in practice but in a game it's something else."

ARGYROS NAMED TO SEAT ON FEDERAL HOME LOAN CORP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prominent Orange County developer George L. Argyros was named by the White 
House Wednesday to the board of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Argyros, 53, was one of three prominent Republicans appointed to new seats on 
the board of Freddie Mac, as the mortgage corporation is called. 
</P>
<P>
President and chief executive of Arnel Development Co., Argyros is one of the 
county's largest developers of apartments. 
</P>
<P>
A resident of Newport Beach's Harbor Island, Argyros is regarded as a canny 
developer and investor. Forbes magazine lists him as the nation's 386th richest 
person, with a fortune estimated at $290 million. 
</P>
<P>
With William Lyon, another prominent Republican and Orange County home builder, 
Argyros owned the former AirCal, a small airline that was sold to American 
Airlines in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
He also owned the Seattle Mariners major league baseball team until last year, 
when he sold it for $76 million, or nearly six times what he paid for it eight 
years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Argyros could not be reached for comment on the appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Freddie Mac was created by Congress to replenish the pool of capital available 
for home loans. The quasi-government corporation buys mortgage loans from 
lenders, packages them, guarantees them and then sells them to investors. The 
lenders use the proceeds of the sales to make more loans. Since it was created 
in 1970, Freddie Mac says it has helped finance one in eight homes purchased in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Freddie Mac, based in Reston, Va., is owned by stockholders. The board of 
directors performs the same functions as the board of a private corporation, 
setting policy and overseeing management. 
</P>
<P>
Freddie Mac shared a board of directors with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board 
until last year, when Congress abolished the bank board in the wake of the 
savings and loan debacle. The legislation gave Freddie Mac a new 18-member 
board. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen directors were elected by stockholders at the corporation's annual 
meeting in February. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law, the President appoints the remaining five. After Wednesday's 
appointments, two seats on the board remain unfilled. The terms run until the 
next annual meeting in spring, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Also named to the board Wednesday were: Thomas Ludlow Ashley, a former Ohio 
congressman and president of the Assn. of Bank Holding Companies in Washington, 
and Woodward Kingman, also of Washington, now an investment management 
consultant and formerly the first president of Ginnie Mae, the Government 
National Mortgage Assn.

SMOKENDERS HEADQUARTERS MOVED TO ARIZ.

<TEXT>
<P>
Smokenders, a company that organizes seminars for smokers trying to kick the 
habit, has moved its corporate headquarters to Phoenix because its new chief 
executive has chosen to live there. 
</P>
<P>
James A. De Sanctis, who led a group of investors who acquired Smokenders in 
March from Comprehensive Care Corp., a Newport Beach-based health-care 
management firm, said the move to Phoenix is "a dream come true." 
</P>
<P>
De Sanctis, Smokenders' chief executive and president, said in a statement 
Wednesday that he "fell in love" with Phoenix during a business trip there in 
the early 1980s and has "wanted to live and work here ever since." 
</P>
<P>
Five executives will move to Phoenix, and the company will hire another five 
people there. The company will also expand its field seminar staff, bringing 
its headquarters staff to about 20 people, said Arnie Willcuts, vice president 
of operations. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which had $2 million in sales last year, employs about 300 people 
who stage stop-smoking seminars for corporations throughout the United States 
and some foreign countries. The firm claims more than 600,000 seminar graduates 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Willcuts said the company's office space in Phoenix will be less expensive than 
in Newport Beach, but he said the primary reason for the move was De Sanctis' 
personal preference. 
</P>
<P>
Before buying Smokenders, De Sanctis was chief operating officer of Senior 
Service Corp., a specialty health-care company in Wilton, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, De Sanctis was chairman of Children's Discovery Centers of America, a 
national child-care chain in San Rafael. He also served as president of the 
Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics speed-reading program.

LEVERAGED BUYOUT OF JERRICO INC. SUCCEEDS IN A SEA OF INDUSTRY FAILURES; 
</P>

INVESTMENT: WHEN TWO GROUPS BOUGHT THE PARENT COMPANY OF LONG JOHN SILVER'S, 
THEY FOLLOWED A PROVEN RECIPE: BUY SOUND COMPANIES AND EXPLOIT THEIR

<P>
Decked out in a light-blue shirt and navy pants, Leonard Harlan, financier, was 
a regular member of the fast-food crew. 
</P>
<P>
He cut fish, prepared salads, did some frying and assisted at the front counter 
during a six-hour shift at a Long John Silver's Seafood Shoppe in south 
Lexington. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't a regular workday for Harlan. As president of one of the 
investment firms that took the fast-food company private last September, Harlan 
was working in the trenches as part of the company's plan for keeping in touch 
with the troops. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm impressed with the way the team operates," said Harlan, 53, who wore a 
Seaman Apprentice name tag with "Len" printed on it. "It gives me an 
appreciation into what you do in one of these shops." 
</P>
<P>
Castle Harlan Inc. is one of two New York investment firms involved in the 
management-led leveraged buyout of Jerrico Inc., the parent company of Long 
John Silver's. The other owner is DJS-Inverness &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to other takeovers that have succumbed to heavy debts, 
Lexington-based Jerrico has thrived since its $620-million buyout. 
</P>
<P>
"We take fundamentally sound companies and expand from that base," said Harlan, 
who added that operating cash flow is up 20% over last year. "Our philosophy is 
we build companies. We get the energy released inside the company. We take the 
lid off." 
</P>
<P>
Harlan Castle also owns Peasant Restaurants of Atlanta and Morton's of Chicago, 
Ethan Allen furniture company, Delaware Management Co., a money-management 
firm; and Reagan Outdoor, a billboard company. 
</P>
<P>
Jerrico has streamlined operations, reducing costs by $16 million in corporate 
administration and $14 million at the restaurants since the buyout. It also 
eliminated about 200 regional and corporate jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't look for the quick buck," said Jerrico President John E. Tobe, who 
also worked a shift at a Long John Silver's in Atlanta. "We had long-term 
planning. I think that's what made this LBO a success." 
</P>
<P>
Leveraged buyouts work best when operations are trimmed to the best performers 
and other assets are sold off to cover financing costs. In Jerrico's case, the 
company recently announced agreements to sell two restaurant chains, Jerry's to 
Great American Restaurants, Inc. of Atlanta and Fazoli's to Seed Restaurant 
Group Inc., a Japanese-owned firm. The prices were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Jerrico also owns two family-style Italian restaurants called Florenz, which it 
plans to sell. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to focus solely on Long John Silver's," said Tobe, who has been with 
Jerrico for 16 years, the past six as president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
Long John Silver's has about 62% of the $1.2-billion quick-service seafood 
restaurant business. Jerrico owns about two-thirds of the 1,500 restaurants, 
and the rest are franchised. 
</P>
<P>
The chain operates in 35 states, the District of Columbia, Canada and 
Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
Since the buyout, there has been an aggressive management campaign to give Long 
John Silver's a more contemporary image. 
</P>
<P>
Television ads began Feb. 26 to promote the restaurants as "Makin' a Splash" 
with its seafood products. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a theme that employed the upbeat nature of the business," said Harlan. 
"We are an upbeat business." 
</P>
<P>
The restaurants are being remodeled, giving the buildings fresh appearances 
with bright yellow on dark-blue paint and large cupolas with beacons to attract 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
"The buildings were historically gray like (Kentucky) state police cruisers," 
said Tobe. "State police cruisers are gray so they can go unnoticed. Our 
buildings ended up doing the same. We want to have the units pop out at you." 
</P>
<P>
The menu has been expanded to include baked and broiled seafood for the 
health-conscious consumer and finger foods. Several items will be introduced 
for a limited time this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The company also plans to increase the percentage of its restaurants with 
drive-through service from the current 35% to 65%; install large, bright menu 
boards and improve plates and packaging. 
</P>
<P>
"The company went from very traditional, very methodical to one, overnight, of 
innovation," said Bill Mahony, executive vice president, operations. 
</P>
<P>
Jerrico recently sold four Long John Silver's in Phoenix to American Seafood 
Partners, one of its largest franchisees. The agreement also calls for the 
buyer to develop 16 new franchised units in the Phoenix area within the next 
three years, and another 16 in markets yet to be chosen. 
</P>
<P>
The company also is looking to add 200 franchised units within five years in 
established markets and expand into the Northeast and Northwest, where it has 
almost no presence, Tobe said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're aggressively going after new franchisees," he said. "We also hope 
company employees can become franchisees." 
</P>
<P>
The company recently offered stock appreciation rights to 3,000 employees, 
starting with assistant managers, which will let them benefit from the 
appreciation of the value of Jerrico's stock, now held by senior managers and 
investors in the buyout. 
</P>
<P>
"The company is theirs," said Harlan. "We want an entrepreneurial spirit. We 
want to produce independent thought." 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, before the buyout, Jerrico had a different focus in remembering the 
20th year of Long John Silver's. 
</P>
<P>
"On the 20th anniversary, we celebrated our age," said Anthony M. Lavely, 
executive vice president for marketing. "Now, eight months later, we're 
celebrating our future, our youth and our desire to do new things."

2 CAJUN, ZYDECO PROS KEEP MUSIC PURE, TRADITIONAL; 
</P>
<P>
FESTIVAL: PURISTS WILL PERFORM THE MUSIC OF THEIR LOUISIANA HOMELAND IN LONG 
BEACH THIS WEEKEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To Cajun and zydeco music veterans D.L. Menard and John Delafose, there's 
nothing wrong with younger performers who mix elements of traditional Louisiana 
music with rock, blues and modern-day country to reach a wider audience. 
</P>
<P>
But for themselves, the music of their homeland is like air itself: the purer 
the better. 
</P>
<P>
In Menard's case, that means that as a guitarist, even though he has the 
technical proficiency to toss off juicy jazz and blues licks, he mostly eschews 
the fancy stuff in favor of basic three-chord strumming behind his old-timey 
two-steps and waltzes. 
</P>
<P>
For Delafose, it means still singing the bulk of his zesty zydeco songs in the 
traditional Cajun French, instead of abandoning his native tongue to lure 
English-speaking audiences. 
</P>
<P>
And what that means to those who catch Menard and Delafose this weekend, at the 
fourth annual Southern California Cajun and Zydeco Festival in Long Beach, is 
that they'll be hearing rural Louisiana music pretty much the way it has 
sounded for decades throughout Cajun country. (In addition to Saturday and 
Sunday performances by Menard's Louisiana Aces and Delafose's family-dominated 
Eunice Playboys, this year's lineup includes two other Louisiana acts -- 
relative newcomer Nathan (Williams) &amp; the Zydeco Cha-Chas and accordionist 
Bruce Daigrepont's Cajun Band -- plus three California-based groups. There also 
will be dance workshops and Cajun and Creole cooking available at booths set up 
by local restaurateurs.) 
</P>
<P>
Ask Menard and he'll be at the front of the line defending such crossover acts 
as Beausoleil, Zachary Richard and Wayne Toups, who have gained ground in rock 
circles. 
</P>
<P>
"You play music the way you feel it," Menard, 58, said by phone last week from 
his one-man chair factory in Erath, La., where he turns out custom wood 
straight-backs and rockers when he isn't on tour. Road trips have taken him 
around the United States several times as well as to Europe, Central and South 
America and the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't bother me if Wayne Toups jumps up and down on stage and does a 
split -- I'm all for it, if that's the way he likes it. I feel like doing it 
real straight -- that's the way I'm comfortable with it and that's the way I'll 
keep on doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Much in Menard's outlook can be traced back to a chance 10-minute chat with his 
idol Hank Williams nearly 40 years ago, though he still talks about it as if it 
happened last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Hank Williams told me this one time -- he said: 'All music is good if it is 
your music,' " said Menard, who has been dubbed the "Cajun Hank Williams" for 
plaintive vocals that sound, when he sings in English, eerily like those of the 
country-music giant. 
</P>
<P>
It's a moniker he accepts politely, but with a blush. "It don't bother me. If 
people see me that way, I'm grateful," he said in the distinctly syncopated 
Cajun accent. "But there was only one Hank Williams and nobody is gonna touch 
his shoes." 
</P>
<P>
Menard's Louisiana Aces band currently includes his longtime, champion 
fiddle-playing cohort Ken Smith and accordionist Eddie LeJeune, the son of 
Cajun music great Iry LeJeune. In a warm-up for this weekend's festival, Menard 
and his group will play a Cajun dance Friday at the War Memorial Hall in South 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
John Delafose is often mentioned along with Boozoo Chavis, Rockin' Dopsie and 
Buckwheat Zydeco's Stanley (Buckwheat) Dural as a leading contender for the 
"King of Zydeco" crown left in 1987 by the death of Clifton Chenier. 
</P>
<P>
But Delafose isn't particularly worried about when, or if, that crown will be 
passed. Chenier is pretty much credited with inventing zydeco, the rollicking, 
rhythm-and-blues infused strain of Cajun music, and Delafose, 51, notes that 
"in Clifton's time, it was only Clifton for a while. But there are so many 
(zydeco) bands around now, it's hard to have a single person as the people's 
choice." 
</P>
<P>
"Now," the accordionist added with a chuckle, over the phone from his home in 
Eunice, La., about 40 miles northwest of Lafayette, "Rockin' Dopsie has got 
himself a crown and says he's the king. But I think that should be appointed by 
the people. Anyway, it's all right if I'm not the king -- as long as I get the 
most gigs." 
</P>
<P>
If Delafose has a concern, it's that too many bands may stray from the musical 
source point. But his family is doing its part: Son Geno, who plays drums for 
the Eunice Playboys, also plays accordion and speaks Cajun French, "so he's 
gonna have a good zydeco band of his own one day." Another of Delafose's sons, 
Tony, is the Playboys' bass player. 
</P>
<P>
Some advocates hoped that "The Big Easy" film in 1987, with its Cajun and 
zydeco-rich soundtrack, would catapult Louisiana music to the national 
forefront the way "Urban Cowboy" did for country music in the early '80s. 
Menard and Delafose don't fret much that it didn't work out that way. 
</P>
<P>
"In some ways maybe people were disappointed, but it's still growing," said 
Delafose, who also plays tonight at Patout's Cajun restaurant in Westwood and 
Friday at Verbum Dei High School in Compton, which not coincidentally was 
Clifton Chenier's favorite Southland concert stop. 
</P>
<P>
"People come to (the annual New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage) festival from all 
different areas," Delafose said. "Now there's other (Cajun-zydeco) festivals in 
California, Texas, San Francisco, Rhode Island. People will go to a festival 
and like it, then go home and spread it out." 
</P>
<P>
In that respect, both men line up squarely in the corner of Southland 
Cajun-Zydeco Festival organizer Franklin Zawacki, who organizes the Southern 
California festival out of his brother's house in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"I prefer the way it's going now," said Zawacki, a music lover who's more 
likely to be found in front of the bandstand dancing Cajun style than 
sequestered backstage in an office tallying gate receipts. "I'd rather have 
people come to the music, like it and then love it, rather than wear it in a 
hip fashion for a while and then lose interest next season." 
</P>

O.C. BUSINESSMAN'S BAND: AN EVERYMAN'S CHANCE TO PLAY;

<P>
MUSIC: AFTER A PERFORMANCE ON RADIO, THE AMATEUR GROUP IS SUDDENLY IN DEMAND.

Not long ago, the Orange County Businessman's Band was just another group of 
struggling amateur musicians. During a series of mishaps, their borrowed 
uniforms were stolen and they lost the minimal funding they were receiving 
through a local college's community services program. Membership fluctuated 
like the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
But after performing the "William Tell" Overture on KLOS-FM's popular Mark and 
Brian morning show in March, the 30-member band is finally getting into the 
limelight. 
</P>
<P>
After a live performance at the KLOS studio in Los Angeles, they continued on 
location with their hosts, who boarded an RTD bus traveling up La Cienega 
Boulevard. They played the overture again while Mark and Brian interviewed 
startled passengers about their sex lives. 
</P>
<P>
Then they sped off in the Mark and Brian Mobile to an impromptu appearance on 
the "AM Los Angeles" television show. 
</P>
<P>
The group's director, Doug Thompson, is still getting calls from friends who 
heard the broadcasts and the band has gained several new members as a result. 
</P>
<P>
Now they're a hot act on the local circuit. They'll appear at the Costa Mesa 
Lions Club Fish Fry in June, at the Orange County Fair on July 20 and are 
booked to play at the opening of the Thomas F. Riley Terminal at the Orange 
County Airport. "But now no one knows exactly when it's going to be finished," 
said Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
The group is the latest incarnation of a band formed by Thompson more than 10 
years ago. Its name has changed at least six times over the years, but its 
purpose has always been the same. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing music is a great stress reliever. I wanted to provide a way for people 
to unwind after work and keep their musical skills sharp," said Thompson, a 
customer service representative at Garden Grove Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people put years into learning to play an instrument, only to set it 
aside when they leave school and go to work," said Thompson. "The old trombone 
just sits in the garage gathering dust," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The group is not just for male members of the pinstripe set. It includes a 
cross-section of male and female professionals at various career stages. Some 
drive from as far as Rancho Santa Margarita to attend the group's raucous 
practices on Thursday nights at the Costa Mesa High School band room. 
</P>
<P>
"Some guys go bowling. But I'd rather play music," said Fabien Durache, a 
designer at Kennard, Herbage &amp; Associates architectural firm in Santa Ana. 
"It's relaxing and it takes me back to my high school days," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Durache spent many hours in the same band room as a student at Costa 
Mesa High. "The band instructor used to throw his baton at us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His former instructor is now teaching karate, but a sign on his old office sums 
up the reason Durache is still around. It reads: "Without Music, Life Would Be 
a Mistake."

PLUMBER STARTS RECORD LABEL TO SHAKE THINGS UP;

MUSIC: A CHULA VISTA MAN HAS FOUND A LABOR OF LOVE -- PRODUCING SONGS BY 
ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT GROUPS.

<P>
Bob Barley is probably the only plumber in the world who also happens to run 
his own record company. 
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, Barley's Vinyl Communications label, with headquarters 
in Chula Vista, has released 15 records by eight so-called alternative bands 
from San Diego, San Francisco, New York, Florida and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Despite international distribution and airplay, Vinyl Communications is hardly 
in the same league as CBS or Warner Bros. It's a labor of love, Barley said -- 
which is why he's still fixing leaky toilets and plugged-up sinks for a living. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no money in it. We're part of a real underground network that's got 
nothing to do with the real business end of the music industry; these are all 
fans and people who like a different style of music than the commercial 
mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. Vinyl Communications focuses on cacophonous punk-metal bands with 
socially conscious, decidedly anti-Establishment lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
"You won't hear any sappy love songs on this label," said Barley, 25. "It's a 
reflection of my personal tastes, my personal thoughts about what music should 
be. 
</P>
<P>
"Music is a very powerful medium, and you can either put people to sleep or 
shake them up a little bit. Pop music, and pop culture in general, is geared 
very much toward people sitting back and consuming and not taking part in 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
"What our bands are trying to do, on the other hand, is get people to think, 
get them to interact, and expand their minds beyond what they learn in 
state-run schools, which are basically training grounds for people to get 
low-paying jobs and make somebody else rich." 
</P>
<P>
Vinyl Communications was founded in October, 1986, when Barley decided to take 
his own band, Neighborhood Watch, into the studio to cut a three-song, 
seven-inch extended-play (EP) record. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we had something to say, and rather than trying to play the 
music-industry game, which we wouldn't have fit into anyway, we just went ahead 
and released it ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
The EP was distributed to local record stores and marketed, worldwide, through 
mail-order ads in underground fanzines. The initial press run of 1,600 quickly 
sold out, and Barley began toying with the idea of releasing records by other 
bands as well. 
</P>
<P>
The first was A.P.P.L.E., from New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I read an interview with them in a magazine called Maximum Rock 'n' Roll, and 
I really liked what they had to say," Barley said. "They were very political 
and very up front about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I wrote to them and sent them one of our records, and they wrote me back, 
saying they were very interested in doing vinyl, but couldn't afford it. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them that if our record sold well enough so that we got our money back, 
we'd consider putting out their record also." 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1987, A.P.P.L.E. made its recording debut on Vinyl Communications 
with "A Sensitive Fascist Is Very Rare," a four-song EP with a picture of 
Ronald Reagan on the cover. 
</P>
<P>
"The record sold more than 4,000 copies, primarily through mail-order, and 
that's what got the whole setup going," Barley said. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point, we realized, 'Hey, we can do this,' so we decided to turn Vinyl 
Communications into a full-fledged label. Our plans were to get music out that 
the mainstream labels or even the bigger independents wouldn't touch, just 
because of its political content or its lack of musical accessibility." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Vinyl Communications has grown, slowly but surely. 
</P>
<P>
The label has subsequently released a dozen more records, including EPs by 
Amenity, from Chula Vista, and Cringer, from Hawaii, and full-length albums by 
Neighborhood Watch, A.P.P.L.E., and San Francisco's Brain Rust. 
</P>
<P>
Master tapes are either submitted by the bands or produced in-house at Vinyl 
Communications' Chula Vista recording studio. Records are pressed by Bill Smith 
Custom Records in El Segundo and marketed internationally via mail-order ads in 
fanzines and a growing network of independent record distributors. 
</P>
<P>
"We usually press between 1,000 and 2,000 copies of each release," Barley said. 
"And we generally sell out, particularly since we signed a new distribution 
deal four months ago with Mordam Records of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"They deal directly with about 100 record stores all over the world, and they 
also service something like 70 other distributors. They're currently getting, 
and selling, the lion's share of our records." 
</P>
<P>
Barley said the demand for Vinyl Communications product is growing primarily 
because of regular airplay on alternative and college radio stations throughout 
the United States as well as on Britain's BBC, France's Radio Gironde, 
Germany's Radio Berlin (with an estimated 4 million listeners), Canada's CITR 
and CJIV, and Mexico's Estereo Frontero. 
</P>
<P>
"The label has built up a fair reputation for having quality releases," Barley 
said. "Our records have gotten favorable reviews in magazines and fanzines all 
over the world; I just saw one from a fanzine in Switzerland in which the 
reviewer called our label one of the best in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how we get airplay, and that's how we sell records." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's a constant financial struggle. The primary reason Barley rejects 
most of the five to 10 demonstration tapes he receives each month, he said, 
isn't because he doesn't like them, but because he's temporarily low on funds. 
</P>
<P>
"We recently got a great tape from a band from Finland," he said, "but 
financial difficulties prevented us from releasing it, and they ended up 
putting it out themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to put out more stuff, but it's hard coming up with the money. At 
best, it's a break-even situation, and whatever money we make goes right back 
into the business. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, I'd like to see us generate enough income to become 
self-sustaining, continue to grow and release more product, and maybe start 
paying the bands and some of the people who work with the label. 
</P>
<P>
"After all, you can't eat good reviews."

WISDOM OF NIGHT SOIL MAN'S LYRICS SPIN ON CENTER STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS K. ARNOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The latest release by the Vinyl Communications label is "Garden of Delights," 
the debut album by San Diego's own Night Soil Man. 
</P>
<P>
And, as is true of most bands on the Vinyl Communications roster, the lyrics 
command center stage -- with singer-songwriter-guitarist Rosebud's words of 
wisdom elevating the quartet above generic punk-metal status. 
</P>
<P>
Her lyrics address a range of social issues. 
</P>
<P>
On "Rape the Mother," she warns of impending ecological doom: 
</P>
<P>
"The children of the earth would bring the Mother to her knees/And strip her of 
her beauty, throw her naked body into poisoned seas/Run wild/While tearing down 
her mountain breasts to suckle dry the golden milky source/And spread apart her 
valleys wider till she splits asunder from her very core. . . ./Yes, long 
before the reigning forests turn to deserts and then the deserts are no more/So 
many moons before the last lion roars its solitary roar/Rape the Mother/Rape 
her good/Run wild, run free. . . ./Mama gonna have the last laugh, look out." 
</P>
<P>
"I write from experience," Rosebud said. "When I look around me, I see old 
people being treated worse than pet poodles; I've gone to college, I've been 
raped, but I've also been loved. And if you're alive, if you're aware and 
intelligent, and if you have feelings, I don't see how you can write 'Baby, oh 
baby, it feels like the first time' 20,000 ways. 
</P>
<P>
"That's self-serving pap. We're not preaching, we just have more questions. 
When we play, we play from our guts, four people experiencing life and 
learning. If you're not learning, you're not growing, and if you're not 
growing, you're dying." 
</P>
<P>
Night Soil Man's lyrics might be construed as unduly negative -- an assessment 
with which Rosebud disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not negative," she said. "A lot of what we write is a celebration of 
life, but as soon as you're born, you're on the dying side of life. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not negative, that's just how it is. Everyone is fighting a hard 
struggle, but most music glosses over the truth and proposes soft lies without 
challenging us to break away from our armchairs." 
</P>
<P>
Night Soil Man played its first gig on Halloween night, 1987, at a house party 
in Ocean Beach. The band has since become a semi-regular at original-music 
nightclubs like the Spirit in Bay Park and Rio's in Loma Portal. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from Rosebud, the other members of the band are E. Raymond S., guitar; 
Mike Soil, bass; and Mark Trombino, drums. THOMAS K. ARNOLD

'STANDARD' A SKILLFUL BALANCE OF GENRE, TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let's admit it at the outset: "Eastern Standard," a provocative entertainment 
at the Coast Playhouse, is about a bunch of yuppies. 
</P>
<P>
Some people simply don't want to hear about yuppie soul-searching, when there 
are so many more pressing problems on the planet. These people will have a 
built-in prejudice against this play. 
</P>
<P>
Not that other problems are ignored by Richard Greenberg, the playwright. One 
of the characters has AIDS. Another is on the margins of an insider trading 
scandal. And the young and the restless in this play are confronted with a 
homeless schizophrenic who temporarily enters their lives and provides a prod 
for the action. 
</P>
<P>
They're not talking about what color the new Miata should be. 
</P>
<P>
It's the overall context that may annoy confirmed yuppie-haters. "Eastern 
Standard" is a contemporary model of the sort of play that Philip Barry wrote 
60 years ago: a witty comedy that addresses social issues obliquely -- through 
the unrest within a group of well-educated and well-connected young adults. The 
ending is relatively happy -- for the yuppies if not for the schizophrenic. 
</P>
<P>
"Eastern Standard" doesn't take its issues as seriously as some may wish. But 
Greenberg does take his characters seriously. He refuses to dismiss them as 
caricatures. 
</P>
<P>
We laugh at their banter, though occasionally it sounds too studied. We also 
see their frailties and hypocrisies. And their possible evolution into more 
humane people is surprisingly heartening. Without resorting to heavy-handed 
psychoanalysis that would violate the standards of the genre, Greenberg digs 
surprisingly deep below the shallow surfaces of these people. 
</P>
<P>
This balancing of a light genre with dark times, of flip remarks with suddenly 
felt pain, is a delicate act. But Johnathon Pape's staging carries it off as 
well as Greenberg's script. 
</P>
<P>
The first act is set in a trendy restaurant at lunchtime, immaculately designed 
by Todd K. Little. But despite the cool look, which extends to the costume 
design by Roger Meunier and Douglas Kimble, something's amiss at each of three 
adjacent tables. 
</P>
<P>
At the first, architect Stephen (Richard Waterhouse) confides to his gay 
college chum, up-and-coming artist Drew (Andrew Kreiss), that he swallowed a 
bottle of pills last night. Stephen couldn't abide his soulless job or his 
loveless life any more. He vomited up the drugs, but he's still fretting. 
</P>
<P>
Financial consultant Phoebe (Lorna Patterson) arrives at the next table, soon 
followed by her brother Peter (Gordon Thomson), a gay TV executive. The 
revelations here are even grimmer. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly homeless May (Lynn Milgrim), at a third table, hurls a Perrier bottle 
in the direction of the yuppies, uniting their fates more than they realize. 
Then we see what prompted her to throw the bottle, as we return to the 
preceding conversation between May and would -- be actress Ellen, (Christie 
Mellor) who's waiting on the tables. 
</P>
<P>
In the second act, a month has passed and the four yuppies -- now two couples 
-- adjourn to Stephen's beach house. Stephen has the cockeyed idea to invite 
Ellen, with whom he has struck up a friendship. And Ellen has the crazy idea to 
invite bag lady May, with whom she has struck up a friendship. 
</P>
<P>
May arrives and fits in remarkably well -- until push comes to shove. But then 
May is a veteran at adapting to changing circumstances. The other characters 
have to do some adapting too, to May and to each other, and it's a shock to 
their more cushioned personalities. 
</P>
<P>
As the host and nominal hub of this group, Waterhouse is a touchingly mixed-up 
guy, who makes fun of his own whining. Occasionally Greenberg's more byzantine 
turns of phrase sound a little forced in Waterhouse's mouth; but then who 
wouldn't have a problem making "dumbstruck as ever by the tortuous path of 
bureaucratic concessions" sound natural? Note how Waterhouse's thick shock of 
hair looks like it has been through the wringer by the final scene -- a perfect 
little detail. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson "looks as if she breakfasts on ticker tape," to quote Drew, and the 
arrogance never quite melts, though her concern for her brother is palpable. As 
for Drew, when he stops wisecracking, he starts gushing out his romantic 
feelings; the two impulses don't always sound as if they could co-exist. But 
Kreiss' limber tongue is up to the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Thomson broods beautifully, Mellor is a winning ditz, and Milgrim makes the 
unlikeliest transformation believable enough, for the purposes of the genre. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8325 Santa Monica Blvd., West Hollywood, Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 
p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m., ends July 8. $20-$25; (213) 650-8507.

CANDYE KANE LIKES HER COUNTRY OLD-TIME, TWANGY; 
</P>
<P>
TRADITIONAL: PEOPLE WHO SAY THEY HATE COUNTRY REALLY HATE THE NEW STUFF, THE 
SINGER SAYS, NOT THOSE OLD RAW, EMOTIONAL ORIGINALS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Candye Kane firmly believes that country music -- traditional country music, 
that is -- has universal appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem with country is that everyone lumps it all together, the modern 
with the traditional," said the 28-year-old singer-songwriter, who, since 
moving to Encinitas four years ago, has been perpetuating old-time twang in 
nightclubs all over San Diego County, either on her own or with her backup 
trio, the Jolly Ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why you have people saying they hate country, but they really don't 
know. What they really hate is the modern stuff, which is just all so polished 
up," Kane said. 
</P>
<P>
"The old twangy stuff, on the other hand, has integrity. It's raw and 
emotional, and it's something everyone can relate to." 
</P>
<P>
Judging from the audience last Sunday night at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana 
Beach, where Kane and her band played their customary set of traditional 
country classics -- including Patsy Cline's "Crazy," Ray Price's "Heartaches by 
the Number" and Ernest Tubbs' "Walking the Floor Over You" -- she's right. 
</P>
<P>
Out on the dance floor, a white-haired couple in matching cowboy boots did the 
two-step alongside a pair of kids in T-shirts and surfer shorts. 
</P>
<P>
In the stands, a John Wayne type wearing a straw Stetson, his eyes glued to the 
stage, was tapping his feet. So was a long-haired guy in a baseball cap who 
before the show had been scanning the rock-concert ads in the Sunday paper. 
</P>
<P>
"I think traditional country music is like the white man's form of the blues," 
Kane said. "I have this image of hillbillies sitting on their back porches, 
writing real songs from their hearts -- just like black blues artists, but from 
a different perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"And again, just like the blues, once you hear it, you're hooked." 
</P>
<P>
There's a music industry adage that says it's not the singer, it's the song. 
But, in Kane's case, it's both. Her audiences might be swayed by her 
repertoire, but they're ultimately seduced by her voice, as sweet and pure and 
crystal-clear as that of Kitty Wells, the late Cline, Loretta Lynn and other 
past queens of country music. 
</P>
<P>
Kane, who was born and raised in a rough-and-tumble neighborhood in East Los 
Angeles, said she discovered the seductive power of her voice at an early age. 
</P>
<P>
"I was one of the only white kids in my school, and I was always getting beat 
up because I was a minority," she recalled. "So I started learning how to sing 
oldies because that's what all the gangs and cholos listened to, and by singing 
songs like 'Earth Angel' and 'Angel Baby' to these kids," and that's when she 
stopped getting beaten up." 
</P>
<P>
When she was 14, Kane said, she appeared on the nationally televised "The 
Original Amateur Hour"; a year later, she encored on "The Gong Show," placing 
second to "some clown jugglers." 
</P>
<P>
By the time she dropped out of high school in 1979, Kane said, she had switched 
from singing oldies a cappella to singing traditional country with an acoustic 
"hillbilly" band. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the music I grew up with," Kane said. "I listened to my mom's records, 
mostly sound tracks, and the one I liked best was 'Oklahoma!' She also had a 
lot of Patsy Cline records, and Patsy quickly became one of my biggest idols." 
</P>
<P>
For the next seven years, Kane plied the L.A. club circuit, singing covers as 
well as originals. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been writing poetry since I was 12," she said. "And, when I formed my 
first band, I started using some of the poems I had written to write songs." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until she moved south to San Diego in 1986 -- at the behest of 
Paladins bassist Thomas Yearsley, whom she later married -- that Kane began 
getting some breaks. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, she cut a demonstration tape for CBS Records. The sessions were 
financed by the label and produced by Val Garay, who has also produced albums 
by Linda Ronstadt, James Taylor, the Motels and Dwight Twilley. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, "Please Tell Me a Lie," one of her originals, wound up on "A Town 
South of Bakersfield, Part II," a compilation album of songs by up-and-coming 
Los Angeles-area country artists. ("Part I" contributors included Dwight 
Yoakam.) 
</P>
<P>
Next month, Kane is off to Nashville for a songwriters showcase at the Bluebird 
Cafe, along with fellow locals Robert Savery and Jack Tempchin, who wrote many 
hits for the Eagles and Glenn Frey. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bluebird is where all the songwriters and music publishers and people 
looking for songs congregate and find each other," Kane said. "Robert and Jack 
and I have a night all to ourselves, and we're just going to swap songs and 
hope something happens." 
</P>
<P>
Kane also recently began moonlighting as a jazz singer. Starting this Friday, 
she'll be at the Marie Callendar's restaurant in Encinitas every Friday evening 
from 4 to 7, singing torch songs such as "Stormy Weather" and "I'm Confessin' " 
in an acoustic jazz trio. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something I've always wanted to do," Kane said. "Kay Starr, she's my 
other big idol, her and Patsy Cline, and every once in a while I'll go into 
some piano bar, anonymously, and just sit in and sing. 
</P>
<P>
"After all, the old jazz is another pure form of American music, just like 
traditional country." 
</P>
<P>
 Candye Kane will be debuting her jazz trio Friday at Marie Callendar's 
restaurant in Encinitas and singing traditional country with the Jolly Ranchers 
on June 8 at the Del Mar Horse Show and June 13 and 23 at the Casbah in 
Middletown.

A MAJOR GOAL: 'PROUD TO BE A BLACK AFRICAN-AMERICAN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I recently read an article on black people of Orange County (May 10). I was 
shocked to read some of the statements said about black people. 
</P>
<P>
I feel it was misleading information to make black people even less desirable 
in white society. 
</P>
<P>
All of your statements were from black people, (who) are confused in their way 
of thinking. I am a young black man who lives and worked in Orange County. I am 
well-educated and live in a middle-class neighborhood, so I feel I have some 
true opinion about the situation in Orange County and how black people feel 
(about) Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Saunders said he does not relate or speak the same language as other black 
people who resided outside of Orange County. This young man is a prime example 
of being brainwashed from the white society and his parents have (played) a big 
part in his way of thinking. It does not matter where you live. As long as you 
have an open mind, you can relate to anyone, if you really want to. 
</P>
<P>
Black people must learn to work together as a whole rather than worrying about 
less-important things such as who's going to take their daughters to the high 
school prom. Black people must be able to say, "I am proud to be a black 
African-American."

FREE TAPED BOOKS OFFERED AT LIBRARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was interesting to read Dennis McLellan's article on the Rental Book Tape 
business (May 12). 
</P>
<P>
But I was saddened to note the omissions of coverage of free taped books in 
public libraries throughout the country serving hundreds of thousands of 
readers. 
</P>
<P>
Also, how about the Library of Congress program for free taped books and 
periodicals, free play machines, and free postage both ways for a million 
housebound readers? 
</P>
<P>
Why not construct an article reviving up free readership and some counteraction 
to imbibing superficial TV time-wasting?

ARGUING THE CASE AGAINST ATTORNEYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article on handling your own legal affairs (May 11) was most interesting 
because I believe the public has been intimidated into thinking anything 
requiring court action must have the high-priced services of a lawyer, and (the 
public) is spending billions on something they could do just as well 
themselves, and at a fraction of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
Also, they would bring to their own case a genuine personal interest and 
concern that few lawyers really do. 
</P>
<P>
Surveys have shown that it is a rare altruist who enters that "noble" 
profession to further the interests of justice; most admit they are in it for 
the money and status and little else. 
</P>
<P>
My own experience with three lawyers in a divorce case made it quite clear why 
they insist on that big retainer up front and why they are rated along with 
used-car dealers at the bottom of public trust. 
</P>
<P>
I fully agree with the man in the story who said, "A lot of people are being 
taken over the coals by lawyers." The fact is that anyone who has the time and 
is able to read can find plenty of do-it-yourself books on legal procedures in 
the library with full instructions on how it should be done. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't surprising when a public-interest official stated that "judges are 
incredibly hostile and impatient with pro se litigants." Remember, judges are 
lawyers and former lawyers, and they would instinctively resent anyone who has 
the temerity to intrude on a golden trough that has enriched thousands of them 
and their brethren. 
</P>
<P>
Most politicians are former lawyers, and the flood of accusations we have heard 
lately about the honesty and ethics of politicians leaves nothing more to be 
said.

ASK THE VET: THE LITTLE EXTRAS EASE A CAT'S LONG RIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. GLENN ERICSON, Ericson, a practicing Orange County veterinarian, is 
immediate past president of the Southern California Veterinary Medical Assn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: In about six weeks, we will be moving to Northern California and I am unsure 
about how, exactly, to move my two cats. It will be an eight- or nine-hour 
drive and I'm planning on putting them each in their own carrier, as they do 
not get along well enough to be confined together. How big should their 
carriers be? Should I provide food or water during the trip? What about their 
litter box needs? Should they be tranquilized? If so, to what extent? 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Helin, Brea 
</P>
<P>
A: On a drive of that length, it would be wise to put your cats in carriers 
that will allow them some room to move around yet not take up too much space in 
the car. Once you are under way, the cats will probably settle down and sleep 
most of the way. If they are not used to traveling in a car, you might want to 
wait to feed them midway in the trip rather than at the beginning, allowing 
them to adjust to the motion and the confinement. 
</P>
<P>
Do allow them to have some water before the trip starts and offer them water at 
each stop. During any stops, you might put a small cardboard litter box in the 
cages, giving them a chance to use them. Then discard the boxes in the trash. 
This way you won't have to worry about them spilling their litter all over the 
car or their carriers. 
</P>
<P>
Make sure there is a towel or small blanket on the bottom of the carriers, 
giving them a place to hide or rest in comfort. 
</P>
<P>
Unless your cats get extremely agitated by traveling, it won't be necessary to 
sedate them. They will probably raise a fuss at the start but then settle down. 
If you decide that sedatives are necessary, have your cats checked by your 
veterinarian and decide what dosages will be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
A local pet supply house or pet shop should be able to supply you with proper 
cat carriers. I would highly recommend the sturdy plastic airline carriers as 
they are well ventilated, supply protection in case of an accident and come in 
various sizes. Make sure that you have a copy of your cats' vaccinations and 
medical records so that your new veterinarian will be able to continue any 
treatments that may be necessary and supply him with good background 
information on your pets. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My cat has started losing hair on her belly and rear legs. She seems to 
groom herself constantly because she must be itchy. She does have some fleas 
and does chew at them but we have been using a flea spray to try to keep them 
under control. Is there anything else that I can do for her to let her hair 
coat grow back? 
</P>
<P>
T. Pressman, La Habra 
</P>
<P>
A: Your cat is probably allergic to fleas and has developed a dermatitis 
because of it. The best treatment would be flea control of the home 
environment. Flea sprays will help reduce the fleas that are on her at the 
time, but make sure that her skin doesn't react to the spray itself. You should 
also have your veterinarian check her for other possible causes of hair loss, 
such as ringworm, skin parasites, or hormonal imbalances. Your vet may want to 
start her on an anti-inflammatory medication to stop her excess licking and 
chewing which will allow the hair coat to return.

COMPUTER FILE: FRESH AIR THROUGH WINDOWS 3.0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE J. MAGID, LAWRENCE J. MAGID is a Silicon Valley-based computer 
analyst and writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Microsoft's Windows 3.0, unveiled Tuesday, may turn out to be the most 
significant development in the nine-year history of IBM and compatible personal 
computers. The software, which works with the MS-DOS operating system, makes it 
possible for millions of those machines to use an attractive graphical 
interface similar to that on the Apple Macintosh. 
</P>
<P>
Windows 3.0, with a suggested list price of $149, is neither a program nor an 
operating system. It is an operating environment. As such, it governs the look 
of the screen, the way users interact with programs and even the way programs 
operate. It runs under the regular MS-DOS operating system on any IBM 
compatible with an Intel 286, 386 or 486 central processing unit. Machines must 
also have a hard disk, a graphic display and at least 1 megabyte of memory. 
Although Windows will work with regular MS-DOS programs, it works best when 
used with software designed especially for Windows. 
</P>
<P>
Windows 3.0 has four primary advantages over regular MS-DOS. First, all 
programs written for Windows have a similar look and feel. Once you learn how 
to use one Windows program, you have a head start on the others. Second, the 
graphical environment assures that programs operate in a "what you see is what 
you get" mode so that what you see on the screen looks like what you'll get on 
paper. Third, Windows, as does the Mac, makes it easy to transfer data from one 
program to another. It's as simple as highlighting the information with the 
mouse, copying it to the clipboard and pasting it in another program. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Windows 3.0 is a multi-tasking operating environment. That means it's 
possible to load several programs into the computer's memory and switch between 
them with a single command or mouse movement. You can even have several 
programs share the screen, each in its own window. As I write this article, I 
am simultaneously transmitting data to another computer. What's more, my 
spreadsheet and drawing programs are in memory so that I can switch to them in 
less than a second without having to stop what I'm doing. 
</P>
<P>
Windows 3.0 can take advantage of up to 16 megabytes of memory. Regular MS-DOS 
programs can use only 640K. I'm not suggesting you buy that much memory for 
your system, but the more memory you have, the more programs you can run at one 
time. Extra memory also increases performance in some situations. 
</P>
<P>
Users whose machines are equipped with an Intel 386 or 486 CPU will be able to 
use Windows to run several DOS or Windows applications in the background, with 
each program behaving as if it's running in its own dedicated PC. It's also 
possible for 386 users to allocate part of their hard disk to simulate random 
access memory. This so-called virtual memory allows the 386 to continue to run 
programs even after you've run out of regular memory. 
</P>
<P>
I doubt if anyone but a software reviewer would do this, but as a test, I used 
Windows on an 8-megabyte 386 to run WordPerfect, WordStar, Microsoft Word, 
Lotus 1-2-3, Prodigy, Quattro, Word for Windows, Excel, Microphone II and 
several other Windows and non-Windows programs -- all at the same time. Each 
behaved perfectly. The only program I couldn't run was the one that controls my 
compact disc drive. Ironically, that software was developed by Microsoft -- the 
same company that developed Windows. 
</P>
<P>
You can't run Windows 3.0 on a PC or PC/XT equipped with an Intel 8088 or 8086 
CPU. However, most of those machines can be modified with faster CPUs. 
</P>
<P>
If you buy Windows you should also count on buying new Windows-compatible 
software. It's possible to use your old software, but the programs will look 
and operate just like they always have. They will not offer Windows' graphical 
user interface, although you will be able to use Windows to copy and paste 
information between regular DOS programs or between DOS and Windows programs. 
Some programs written to run under previous versions of Windows must be 
modified before they can run properly with the new version. 
</P>
<P>
Windows 3.0 comes with several free programs to get you started, including a 
basic word-processing program, a calculator, a couple of games, a reasonably 
good communications program and a personal organizer, called Daybook. Daybook 
includes a place for your schedule, address book and "to do" list. 
</P>
<P>
Early versions of Windows were criticized as being slow and ugly. What's more, 
there has been a dearth of software. The new Windows is a lot faster and a lot 
prettier. I've been using a prerelease copy for about a month and I'm extremely 
impressed with its features, performance and reliability. I didn't get out my 
stop watch to perform any timing tests, but its performance on my 386-based PC 
seems at least as good as what I'm getting on a similarly equipped Macintosh 
IIci -- a machine with a street price that's more than twice the cost of my PC. 
I was pleasantly surprised at how well Windows performed on a minimal 
configuration when I tested it on a machine with a 286 CPU and 1 megabyte of 
random-access memory. If you shop around you can find such machines, equipped 
with a hard disk and a high-resolution color monitor, for about $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Microsoft and other software companies are rushing to provide software to run 
under Windows. Microsoft has already released Windows versions of its 
spreadsheet (Excel) and word processing (Word) software. Software Ventures has 
announced a forthcoming version of its Microphone Communications software, and 
WordPerfect Corp. is working on a Windows version of its best-selling word 
processing program. hDC Computer Corp. of Redmond, Wash., has released some 
very good utilities programs for Windows, including one that makes it easier to 
locate and run programs. Asymetrix, of Bellevue, Wash., has already released 
ToolBook, a software development tool that is somewhat similar to Apple's 
HyperCard language. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to add value to its systems and simplify the lives of its dealers 
and customers, Zenith Data Systems is loading Windows 3.0 along with ToolBox 
and DOS 4.0 on the hard disks of all its 286 and 386 desktop machines. Zenith 
is also including a mouse as standard equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Zenith, along with Microsoft, commissioned a study that concluded that 
graphical user interfaces such as Windows and Macintosh cause users to work 
faster and better and achieve higher productivity and lower frustration than 
those using a regular, non-graphical interface. 
</P>
<P>
Novice users of a graphics-based system completed 42% more tasks than novice 
users of a non-graphics system, according to the study conducted by the 
research firm Temple, Baker &amp; Sloane. Experienced users were 35% more 
productive, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
The new version of Windows is an exciting and important development, bringing 
many advantages of the Apple Macintosh to lower-priced IBM compatibles. It 
breathes new life into the old MS-DOS operating system and has turned me into a 
born-again DOS user.

<TEXT>
<P>
Many sons of famous corporate tycoons who take over the family business do so 
with trepidation. Thomas J. Watson Jr., son of longtime IBM Chairman Thomas J. 
Watson, was no different. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd heard so many stories about sons of prominent men failing in business, and 
I could imagine their devastation at finding themselves unable to fill their 
fathers' shoes. I worried I'd end up the same way," Watson writes in his 
autobiography, "Father, Son &amp; Co.," which goes on sale today. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, Watson did not fail. 
</P>
<P>
Watson's father had transformed International Business Machines Corp. from an 
obscure tabulating machine company to a worldwide powerhouse before he turned 
over control to his son in 1956. He died a few months later at age 82. 
</P>
<P>
Watson Jr. furthered IBM's growth, leading it into the age of computers -- an 
area his father originally shied away from. 
</P>
<P>
The book, co-authored with a Fortune magazine editor, Peter Petre, provides a 
rare firsthand account of the coming of age of a chief executive and his 
company. Central to the story is the tense relationship between Watson and his 
larger-than-life father. 
</P>
<P>
"In public he would praise me lavishly," the 76-year-old Watson writes. "But in 
private father and I had terrible fights that led us again and again to the 
brink of estrangement." 
</P>
<P>
Watson left IBM in 1971 after suffering a heart attack at age 56. He later 
served as U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union and remains IBM's chairman 
emeritus. He said in a telephone interview that writing the book has allowed 
him to relive his life and to clarify his relationship with his father. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a love story. It is a story of a son who was terribly, terribly fond of 
his father. But the son didn't know how to express it," Watson said in the 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the greatest man I ever knew." 
</P>
<P>
Among the book's insights into Watson Sr.: 
</P>
<P>
* He ran IBM along the lines now associated with Japanese companies. Employees 
sang company songs and recited company slogans. Watson's favorite motto, 
"THINK," was emblazoned on posters and company newspapers, along with Watson's 
picture. But Watson's son worried that his father was creating a personality 
cult. 
</P>
<P>
* Watson Sr. believed that you got the best out of employees by treating them 
with respect. "IBM offered the best benefits money could buy," his son writes, 
including education and company country clubs. However, he was tough with IBM's 
managers, often badgering them with obscure questions about IBM's operations. 
</P>
<P>
In the book, Watson Jr. describes himself as an aimless, spoiled youth who 
partied his way through Brown University while barely keeping his grades high 
enough to keep from being expelled. 
</P>
<P>
Watson decided to join IBM after college, despite having little idea what he 
wanted to do with his life. He went through IBM's sales training program, where 
he first became painfully aware of how hard it was to be the boss' son. 
</P>
<P>
On his first sales call, a corporate executive gave him a lecture on the 
difficulty of following his father's footsteps. He told of one such young man 
who became a drunk from too much high living and was fired by his father. 
</P>
<P>
"I was tempted to abandon my IBM career on the spot," Watson writes. 
</P>
<P>
But he persevered and rose to become IBM's top salesman after a lucrative 
account was added to his sales territory to make him look good. The achievement 
won him headlines in the company newspaper. "I felt demeaned," Watson writes. 
"Everyone knew that I was the old man's son, and that otherwise I never could 
have sold so much in such a short time." 
</P>
<P>
Watson escaped the pressures of IBM and his father for several years by flying 
for the Air Force during World War II. But at the war's end, he decided to 
return to his father's company. 
</P>

Watson rose quickly and was named president in 1952. But he never escaped the 
heavy hand of his father as IBM entered a period of explosive growth. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think my father realized how far he was pushing me," Watson writes. 
"There were times when I wondered if I was going to have a nervous breakdown." 
</P>
<P>
In 1956, Watson was preparing to sail in a yacht race when he was called back 
to New York. His father was in the hospital and soon died. 
</P>
<P>
Watson ran the company on his own for five years. But in 1961, he relinquished 
the job of president to prepare for an eventual successor. He kept the job of 
chief executive and also became chairman. 
</P>
<P>
That period led to what Watson Jr. calls the biggest mistake of his life. 
Watson believed that his younger brother, Dick, who was in charge of IBM's 
international operations, would be his natural successor as chief executive. 
But instead of preparing Dick for the job outright, he set him up in a 
competition with other executives. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Watson ran into trouble during the launch of a computer line that was 
crucial to IBM's future. The project was severely behind schedule. Watson 
decided his brother just couldn't handle the job and gave it to another 
executive. That put Dick Watson out of the running for president.

GOLD PRICES FALL SHARPLY ON REPORTS OF SELLING BY SAUDIS 
</P>

<P>
Gold prices were hammered Wednesday on reports that Saudi Arabian banks were 
unloading enormous amounts of the metal in London. 
</P>
<P>
The reports of heavy selling brought chaos to the morning fixing session in 
London and triggered a sympathetic selloff in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold tumbled $11.50 to settle at $364.10 
an ounce, after losing about $11 in Europe. Gold had been as low as $360 on the 
exchange before rebounding somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
In London, gold closed at $363.25, also off $11.50. 
</P>
<P>
Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $363.95, down 
$10.55 from late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The last time gold was near the $364 level was in October, according to William 
O'Neill, research director at Elders Futures Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The market was shell-shocked by aggressive selling by the Saudi banks, traders 
said, estimating that more than 1 million ounces of gold changed hands 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The sales were so dramatic that some traders said Saudi Arabia may be trying to 
signal its displeasure to Congress, which previously rebuffed its attempts to 
purchase armaments from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Saudis also are believed to have been responsible for a similar sharp drop 
in gold prices two months ago, according to analysts and traders.

DOW RISES 4.03 TO 3RD STRAIGHT RECORD CLOSE

<P>
Stock prices broke out of an early slump Wednesday to post a third straight 
record high close, supported by rising high-tech stocks and a firm bond market. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 blue chips rose 4.03 to 2,856.26, extending its gain 
over the last three sessions to 36.35 points. 
</P>
<P>
Traders were encouraged at the market's ability to rally back from a loss of 
more than 15 points earlier in the day. "The selling dried up and bargain 
hunters came in," said Jack Solomon, a technical analyst at Bear, Stearns &amp; 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the Big Board fell to 172.3 million shares from 203.4 million shares 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues and declines were about evenly balanced in the overall tally 
on the New York Stock Exchange, with 753 up, 739 down and 517 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
While the strength in high-technology stocks was a prop for the market's rise, 
analysts were also worried that the group may be getting too rich. Solomon 
pointed out that Compaq and chip-maker Intel both hit all-time highs. 
</P>
<P>
"Some technology names are running up awfully fast," said Smith Barney 
technical analyst William Raftery, pointing to Microsoft's 4 3/8-point gain to 
75 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
"The market may have gotten into a greed phase. When you see something like 
this, it indicates we're no longer at the bottom," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The market had been gaining recently on an outlook of easier inflation and 
lower interest rates. But another sign of weak economic growth, falling durable 
goods orders, had little effect on the market. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported Wednesday morning that new factory orders for 
durable goods fell 4.1% in April, providing a fresh sign of weakness in the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
The bond market rose sharply on the news, thinking it supported the prospect of 
lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
On the trading floor, Westinghouse Electric dropped 1 1/4 to 34 3/4. Traders 
said a Shearson Lehman Hutton analyst trimmed his rating on the company. 
</P>
<P>
Precious-metals issues tumbled as the price of gold fell $11.50 an ounce to 
$364.60 on the Commodity Exchange in New York amid talk of gold sales by major 
investors in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
ASA Ltd. lost 2 3/8 to 49 1/8; Homestake Mining fell 1 1/2 to 18 1/4; Placer 
Dome fell 1 to 16 1/8; American Barrick Resources fell 1 to 18 1/2, and Newmont 
Gold fell 1 1/2 to 43 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Energy issues also were mostly lower as oil prices sagged. Exxon dropped 1/2 to 
47 3/8; Amoco fell 1/2 to 53 1/4; Chevron lost 5/8 to 69 3/8; Schlumberger 
dipped 3/4 to 57, and Halliburton lost 3/8 to 48 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Gainers among the blue chips included International Business Machines, up 1 at 
118 3/4; Coca-Cola, up 1 3/8 at 44 7/8; Philip Morris, up 1/8 at 45 1/8; 
General Motors, up 1/8 at 49, and McDonald's, up 1/2 at 34 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
In foreign trading, the 225-share Nikkei index closed Wednesday at 32,176.51, 
up 238.21 points, or 0.75% on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks closed mostly lower in moderate trading on London's stock exchange, 
depressed by disappointing British trade figures for April. The Financial Times 
100-share index finished down 23.9 points, or 1%, at 2,287.4. 
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, West Germany, 30-share DAX index gained 18.54 points to close at 
1,831.80. 
</P>
<P>
CREDIT 
</P>
<P>
Economic News Is a Boost for Bonds 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices advanced in a volatile session, helped by more evidence of economic 
weakness and moderating inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The government's bellwether 30-year issue rose 3/8 point, or $3.62 per $1,000 
face amount, while its yield fell to 8.57% from 8.60% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Prices got a lift early in the session from the government's report on durable 
goods, which was a bigger decline than many economists expected and suggested 
that the economy is weakening, a plus for bond prices. 
</P>
<P>
A slowing of the economy suggests that the Federal Reserve will be reluctant to 
push interest rates higher and often coincides with lower credit demand. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.25%, up from 8.188% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Ends Higher in Subdued Trading 
</P>
<P>
The dollar closed mostly higher after ignoring the durable goods report. 
</P>
<P>
Trading was quiet with the approach of Thursday's Ascension Day holiday in 
Europe and Monday's Memorial Day Holiday in the United States. Monday also is a 
public holiday in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said technical factors were largely responsible for the dollar's 
movement Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In the spotlight again was the Canadian dollar, which has been under pressure 
in recent days. Canada's Progressive Conservative government was thrown into 
turmoil after a senior cabinet minister resigned amid growing doubts about the 
future of a constitutional reform package. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian dollar did regain some strength Wednesday in Europe and New York. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where the global trading day begins, the dollar fell 1.05 yen to a 
closing 151.35 yen. It traded at 150.90 yen in London, and at 151.45 yen in New 
York, up from 151.25 yen Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was weaker against the British pound, compared to Tuesday. Sterling 
rose to $1.6975 from $1.6915 in London, and to $1.6940 from $1.6930 in New 
York.

Pork Futures Dive on Supply Report 
</P>
<P>
Pork futures plummeted on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and grain and soybean 
futures were mixed. Livestock and meat futures ended mostly lower on the 
Chicago exchange. Selling was centered in the hog and pork belly pits, where 
some contracts plunged their permitted daily limits in line with weakness in 
the cash markets.

THE BUTCHER: SAVE MONEY WITH ITALIAN-STYLE CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MERLE ELLIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you want to eat better for less, maybe you should learn to be Italian. It's 
not all that hard. My children gave me a little book that teaches you almost 
everything you need to know. It's called "How to be Italian" by Lou D'Angelo 
and it gives you all kinds of helpful hints: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Italian power is something that comes from deep inside, like a rumbling in 
the stomach. Ditto Italian sex appeal." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Choose yourself a genuine Italian name. Once you've established yourself, 
you can always change it back." 
</P>
<P>
OK, I'm not serious. You can't really learn to be Italian, but you can learn to 
think like an Italian butcher, and that will save you money. 
</P>
<P>
Italians were among the first to do business as retail butchers in what is now 
my part of the world -- Northern California. They did things and do things 
differently than back in Iowa, where I learned the trade from English and 
German butchers. Back there, back then, beef was cut with the bones left in. 
Steaks like T-bones and sirloins had bones in them. Prime rib roasts had ribs 
in them. Pot roasts were named for the bone they contained: blade chuck, 
7-bone. 
</P>
<P>
It has long been a tradition with Italian butchers to "muscle bone" beef. The 
meat is cut along the natural seams separating each muscle one from the other, 
leaving the bones behind. It took me a while to learn the muscle boning method 
of breaking beef, but it was a lesson worth learning. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best example of this -- one that can save money on the meat bill if 
you do a little cutting up in the kitchen -- is the beef chuck. 
</P>
<P>
The chuck is the shoulder of the beef animal. It's a large part of the carcass 
(about 26%), and it contains several different muscles -- some tough, some 
tender. English and German butchers cut the chuck into pot roasts primarily, 
either blade cut or arm cut, to compensate for the tough muscles that required 
long, slow, moist cooking. Cut Italian style, the individual muscles of the 
chuck are separated so that each can be cooked according to its natural degree 
of tenderness. 
</P>
<P>
Cutting beef Italian style is not as complicated today as it was when I was 
learning the trade. Most of the beef that comes to market these days has 
already had all of the bones removed at the packer. All that remains to be done 
is the separation of the individual muscles. 
</P>
<P>
Most beef chucks come to market divided into two boneless sub-primal cuts: The 
cross-rib chuck or shoulder clod and the under-blade chuck. The shoulder clod 
is a solid muscle removed from the arm portion of the chuck. Because it is a 
solid muscle, it is easy to carve across the grain into thin slices, either 
before or after cooking. It makes a good roast for the oven or barbecue if you 
roast it slow (300 to 325 degrees) and keep it from getting too well done. 
</P>
<P>
Thin slices from the clod are perfect for stuffing to make beef rolls Italian 
style, any style. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of thicker slices of clod can be turned into a boneless chuck roast 
Italian style. Simply slice off a piece of the clod one-inch thick and then a 
second slice two-inches thick. Butterfly the second slice by cutting it almost 
in half, but not quite, so that you can fold it open, making a piece the same 
thickness as the first, but twice as big around. 
</P>
<P>
Cover the smaller slice with a layer of thinly sliced pepperoni or Italian dry 
salami, one (2 1/4-ounce) can sliced black olives and one-quarter pound thinly 
sliced mozzarella cheese. Place the butterflied slice on top and tie with 
string at about one-inch intervals in both directions. Roast as described 
above, or braise; brown well on both sides in a bit of olive oil, add a cup of 
red wine, cover and simmer for about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
The sub-primal under-blade chuck is the cut that offers the most money-saving 
potential for the would-be Italian cut-up. It's the one you are most apt to 
find on special, or at least reasonably priced, in the pot roast section of the 
meat case, labeled, most probably, beef chuck pot roast-boneless. When you see 
it, preferably on special, take home a piece, a good sized piece, and pretend 
you're Italian. Take it apart. 
</P>
<P>
Separate the individual muscles along the natural seams. Save the seam fat and 
connective tissue from between the muscles to make a rich stock for making 
sauces and soups. 
</P>
<P>
After you have all of the muscles of the chuck separated and trimmed of all 
gristle and fat, take a moment to examine each carefully. Some, you will note, 
will have a coarse grainy texture. These are going to be tough and need moist 
heat cooking to tenderize them. Use them for braised dishes or stews. Some 
muscles will have a texture velvety smooth and fine. These can be used for all 
kinds of quick or fry dishes, Italian and otherwise. Slice them into thin 
strips for stir-fry, stroganoff, or Indonesian sate; or cut them in cubes for 
fondue. Use your imagination. 
</P>
<P>
You will, almost certainly, be seeing Italian Style cuts cropping up in the 
butcher's meat case. It's good merchandising. They can make more money. But you 
can do it yourself. You don't have to be Italian.

22ND CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT: THE VETERAN REPUBLICAN REPRESENTATIVE IS GOING TO 
BE TOUGH TO UNSEAT, BUT TWO DEMOCRATS ARE JOCKEYING FOR THE CHANCE TO TRY.

<P>
Two Democrats are vying in the June 5 primary to challenge Rep. Carlos J. 
Moorhead (R-Glendale) in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
Educators David Bayer, 46, of Burbank and Thomas G. Vournas, 66, of Altadena 
are neophyte candidates who want to square off with the well-funded career 
politician who has represented the GOP-dominated congressional district for 18 
years. Moorhead was an attorney and a state assemblyman before he went to 
Washington in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats, one of whom will appear on the November ballot along with two 
minor-party candidates, say Moorhead has lost touch with the 22nd Congressional 
District. 
</P>
<P>
But the chances of unseating Moorhead, dean of California's 18-member GOP 
caucus in Congress, are considered so slim that in some election years no 
Democrat has even tried. Moorhead has typically won reelection with 70% or more 
of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
The 22nd District sprawls from Glendale, La Canada Flintridge and La Crescenta 
to Canyon Country, Acton, Agua Dulce, and parts of Burbank and Palmdale. More 
than 55% of its nearly 300,000 registered voters are Republicans; about 35% are 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Bayer, director of adult education for the Burbank Unified School District, has 
the endorsement of the California Democratic Party and its local chapters. He 
said he is conducting a grass-roots campaign before area groups and on campuses 
to emphasize his advocacy of abortion rights, family planning, a national 
health program, and aggressive measures to clean the air and protect the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
Bayer has raised less than $10,000 in his primary campaign but said that if he 
wins the primary, he will try to raise as much as $100,000 to take on Moorhead 
in November. 
</P>
<P>
Vournas, a native of Los Angeles who has taught in public schools for 40 years, 
said he has long campaigned for Democratic candidates in local, state and 
national elections. But he said he decided to run for office himself this year 
because of his growing frustration "over the serious problems that the U.S. 
faces that are not being dealt with or even recognized." A self-described 
liberal, Vournas calls for better education, health care and living conditions 
for poor children and workers. 
</P>
<P>
Vournas said his campaign "is very limited, with just friends and family doing 
the labor and pounding the beat." He said he has no special financial or group 
backing. 
</P>
<P>
Also appearing on the November ballot will be Libertarian William H. Wilson, 
49, of Pasadena, a compensation analyst who represented the Libertarian Party 
as a candidate in the 55th State Assembly District in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Running under the Peace and Freedom Party banner is Jan B. Tucker, 35, a 
private investigator and frequent candidate who has run for a variety of 
offices since 1974, including lieutenant governor in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker was among a group of demonstrators who protested Moorhead's stand on 
abortion, which the congressman opposes even in cases of rape and incest, at a 
rally in front of Glendale High School last year. He is one of six 
congressional candidates in California recommended for endorsement by the 
California chapter of the Political Action Committee of the National 
Organization for Women. 
</P>
<P>
All the challengers said their goal is to undermine the apparently solid 
support behind Moorhead, 68, who has kept a relatively low profile during his 
career. Moorhead typically shuns the spotlight and busies himself with 
technical issues such as patent protection, hydroelectric power and 
telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Moorhead has declined to debate challengers, saying he saw no 
reason to do so. This year, he has more than $700,000 in his campaign war 
chest, and his supporters are predicting another easy victory.

DITCH DAY AT CALTECH SEES HOW STUDENTS 'STACK' UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Strange forces took over the sedate, tree-lined campus of Caltech on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Near the cafeteria, students strapped a TV reporter for Channel 7 upside down 
in a tree and doused her with cold water. 
</P>
<P>
At the Winnett Student Center, a poster trumpeted "Gandalf for President." 
</P>
<P>
And across the quad marched 21-year-old physics major Larry Canino, swathed 
from head to toe in white rubber and waving what looked like a butterfly net. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in bio-quarantine," Canino announced blithely. "We lost our thermonuclear 
boosters and we're trying to get them working again. It involves a lot of 
electronics." 
</P>
<P>
Canino and his team had until 5 p.m., at which time Ditch Day 1990 formally 
ended and California Institute of Technology in Pasadena reverted to its quiet 
business of imparting one of the finest science educations in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, teams of underclassmen, who form spontaneously, would run 
frantically around campus searching for clues, solve mind-bending feats in math 
and physics and generally comport themselves like fools. 
</P>
<P>
The object: to solve the cerebral and brute-force puzzles laid out by scheming 
seniors and gain access to their combination-locked dorm rooms, where caches of 
goodies and drinks lay hidden. 
</P>
<P>
Ditch Day is a sort of scientific scavenger hunt for brainy kids that pits 
underclassmen -- called "frosh" and "wimps" -- against seniors who have spent a 
good part of the school year dreaming up their fiendish plots. 
</P>
<P>
The puzzles, called stacks, take their name from the piles of furniture that 
seniors once stacked against their dorm doors in a less sophisticated era to 
keep "wimps" out. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the stacks have evolved into ever-more sophisticated tests of brain and 
brawn. They can be brute-force stacks, which must be shattered with power 
drills, hammers and sweat; finesse stacks, which involve scientific aptitude, 
or a combination of both. 
</P>
<P>
Students agree ahead of time to pay for any damage incurred, which has been 
known to run into thousands of dollars. That taken care of, school officials 
wax enthusiastic about Ditch Day, saying it is intellectually stimulating as 
well as a lowbrow way to let off steam. There is no judging or formal 
declaration of winners. 
</P>
<P>
"Concrete is a common theme," explained Bob Finn, a Caltech spokesman. "A lot 
of the stacks also involve humiliation." 
</P>
<P>
Such as serenading passers-by, for instance, which is what 21-year-old 
mechanical engineering major Ben Masek and 19-year-old aeronautics major Hyon 
Lew had to do for a stack that simulated a ride along a New York subway. 
</P>
<P>
With a boom box blasting, the two belted out a raucous rendition of "New 
Sensation" by the band INXS, with Lew twirling on crutches as the result of a 
torn ligament and Masek wielding a tennis racket like Jimi Hendrix on guitar. 
</P>
<P>
While they rocked, another group scrolled on a bank of computers in the Page 
House dorms as they labored over a demonic stack that mixed cerebral games with 
aerobic ones. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, the group bored with power drills to find three computer chips 
buried inside 3x5 blocks of concrete. Then they had to apply their computer 
skills to simulate a circuit board whose workings would yield up the 
combination to the senior's door lock. 
</P>
<P>
At 11 a.m., dusty from concrete powder and sticky from cans of Cheese Whiz 
hidden in the concrete that had exploded all over them when pierced by the 
power drill, the frosh were already plotting their revenge. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got $300 we can spend on manure," mused Kevin Park, a 19-year-old 
aeronautics major. 
</P>
<P>
Mindful of all the publicity that has come to accompany Ditch Day -- TV, radio 
and newspaper reporters descend on the campus as avidly as if covering an 
earthquake -- some cynical seniors have even incorporated media tasks, such as 
talking a TV reporter into being tied to a tree, into their stacks. 
</P>
<P>
The ignominious drenching wasn't originally part of the stack though. It 
occurred when some underclassmen mistook the bound reporter for a senior and 
decided to have a little fun. (Traditionally, seniors are trussed up in trees 
if found lurking on campus after 8 a.m. on Ditch Day.) 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Hu, a 19-year-old computer science major whose stack involved a scavenger 
hunt to Newport Beach and computer logic games, also had a media-related task 
to perform. 
</P>
<P>
"We're supposed to get on Channel 4 news at 4 p.m.," he muttered, glancing at 
his watch with little hope as the minutes inched past 3. But things didn't end 
there. "We're also supposed to test-drive a new Ferrari." 
</P>
<P>
Staff and students alike enjoy reminiscing about the most memorable stacks ever 
concocted at Caltech, where the average student has scored in the top 1% in 
math ability and the top 3% in verbal ability on national tests. 
</P>
<P>
One senior left a one-page physics problem taped to his unlocked door. While 
honor required that the students solve it before entering to claim their 
reward, the problem proved beyond their abilities. In desperation, they took it 
to Prof. Richard P. Feynman, since deceased, but not even the Nobel laureate in 
physics was able to solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
For sheer elegance and simplicity, Caltech spokesman Robert Finn recalls the 
case of the senior who left a computer outside his locked door but no 
instructions. 
</P>
<P>
Figuring they had only to find the right command and the computer would spit 
out the lock combination, underclassman spent all day vainly trying everything 
from "Open Sesame" to "Please Open Door." 
</P>
<P>
It turned out that the computer was programmed so that if anyone left it alone 
for 10 minutes it would have automatically opened the door, Finn said. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are counterstacks, also known as wimp revenge. 
</P>
<P>
One year, dissatisfied with the reward they found after laboring all day on a 
bedeviling stack, the wimps took apart the senior's Porsche and reassembled it 
in his dorm room, with the motor running. 
</P>
<P>
Another year, a senior returned to his dorm and found a huge water balloon, 
filled, with no drain valve. A third was greeted by his furniture, which had 
been bolted -- to the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
This year, a group of frosh hummed like a swarm of irritated bumblebees when 
they discovered only soda pop, several apples and a bag of Oreo cookies after 
solving a stack called "Crime and Punishment." 
</P>
<P>
"We had to commit a bunch of crimes, like hot-wiring a golf cart and parking it 
in a professor's spot, and the bribe was really weak," complained Jack Prater, 
a 20-year-old physics and astronomy major. 
</P>
<P>
"After crime we had punishments," added Chris Campo, a 20-year-old planetary 
science major. "We had to put our hands in really hot water and shock 
ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
So the weary students decided to dish up a little punishment of their own. They 
hoisted the senior's moped halfway up the three-story Firestone Flight Sciences 
Laboratory and lashed it to the outside wall with ropes, where it dangled for 
most of the afternoon, not even swaying in the breeze.

DIAMOND BAR FACES TEST OF LAND POWERS; 
</P>
<P>
REVENUE: THE CITY STANDS TO REAP A WINDFALL IF IT'S ALLOWED TO MAKE UNDEVELOPED 
LAND A REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT AREA. BUT CRITICS SAY THE PROCESS THWARTS THE

DIAMOND BAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When city officials survey 700 acres of vacant pasture land near the San 
Bernardino County line, they see development opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Retail stores. Office parks. Restaurants. A much-needed high school. Perhaps 
one of three new University of California campuses. 
</P>
<P>
To make all that happen, Diamond Bar officials are looking into including the 
land in a redevelopment project area, which would qualify it for redevelopment 
assistance. That raises the question of whether a state law designed to reclaim 
urban slums can be used to develop pastureland. 
</P>
<P>
The City of Industry faces just such a challenge to its power to include 
undeveloped land in a redevelopment project area. A Superior Court decision 
allowed the city to designate a separate parcel of vacant land a redevelopment 
zone, but the decision is being appealed. 
</P>
<P>
The land that Diamond Bar wants to acquire, which is owned by the City of 
Industry, is part of the 2,500-acre Tres Hermanos Ranch and is one of several 
areas that Diamond Bar is looking at for redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
Under the 40-year-old California Redevelopment Law, Diamond Bar could use 
eminent domain to acquire land and sell it to developers, to float bonds to 
finance land purchases and construction, and to collect property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary study by consultant A. J. Wilson estimates that a fully developed 
Tres Hermanos Ranch would bring in $20 million annually in property tax 
revenues. The city could reap an additional $10 million from redevelopment of 
the area occupied by the Diamond Bar Golf Course and commercial areas if they 
were acquired and made redevelopment project zones. 
</P>
<P>
The only catch is that the rolling hills that make up Tres Hermanos Ranch 
aren't covered with graffiti-scarred buildings, dilapidated businesses or 
streets in disrepair. Instead, walnut trees, cattle and an occasional pond dot 
the landscape. And near the San Bernardino County line, bulldozers are busy 
leveling the ground for a new Chino Hills Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
The redevelopment law requires that an area be "blighted" and predominantly 
urban to qualify for redevelopment agency assistance. But rather than precisely 
defining blight, the law allows for a wide range of local interpretations, 
including inadequate public works and utilities, depreciated land value, and 
"social and economic maladjustment." 
</P>
<P>
At a City Council meeting Tuesday night, Wilson said though Diamond Bar 
"obviously is not a community overwhelmed with low-income families and deprived 
economically," it still has "undeniable deficiencies," such as inadequate 
public education facilities and traffic problems that could be helped with tax 
money from new construction in Tres Hermanos and other areas. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be poor planning, it could be the absence of infrastructure, as long 
as it meets the letter of the law," Diamond Bar Mayor Gary Werner said 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
Industry's Urban Development Agency purchased the Tres Hermanos Ranch about 10 
years ago, before Diamond Bar was incorporated, and is drawing up plans for a 
reclaimed water reservoir on part of the property. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Industry is leasing the grazing land for $12.50 a year to San 
Bernardino County resident Hal Arnold, who in turn is subleasing it to Industry 
Mayor John Ferrero, said Carl Burnett, the agency's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said Diamond Bar is exempt from a 1983 amendment to the redevelopment 
law requiring project areas to be 80% urbanized, because the Tres Hermanos 
Ranch is owned by a public agency. City of Industry officials made the same 
claim when they included another 600 acres of vacant pastureland outside Tres 
Hermanos Ranch in a redevelopment zone. 
</P>
<P>
But, the California Redevelopment Agencies Assn., a lobbying group for 
statewide agencies, is proposing legislation that would prevent cities and 
counties from including any vacant land in redevelopment project areas, said 
William Carlson, executive director. 
</P>
<P>
County officials and watchdog groups have criticized cities that use 
redevelopment to stimulate growth in an undeveloped area, saying so-called 
"bare-land projects" are a twisted interpretation of the law. Some groups have 
successfully sued cities and counties, including Solano County, that 
established redevelopment zones in vacant areas, accusing them of illegally 
diverting tax money from schools and the county. Other times, suits were 
dropped when cities promised school districts and counties a larger share of 
property tax money. 
</P>
<P>
"It's highly unlikely that a vacant piece of property would withstand judicial 
scrutiny," said Bruce Tepper, an attorney with the Los Angeles firm Kane 
Ballmer &amp; Berkman, which is appealing the Superior Court decision on 
Industry's redevelopment project. "I don't think it would pass muster." 
</P>
<P>
But Wilson pointed to Pomona's Phillips Ranch redevelopment plan, a 7,000-unit 
residential project that Wilson, then Pomona's city administrator, oversaw. The 
Los Angeles County Grand Jury commended the development in a 1988 report, 
Wilson said, because Pomona's redevelopment agency used property tax money 
generated from the development of Phillips Ranch to finance construction of an 
auto mall. 
</P>
<P>
"Diamond Bar has very legitimate concerns," Wilson said. "This community is not 
trying to play games with redevelopment."

DEVELOPER FEES PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal to levy fees on developers to pay for city services required by new 
housing projects was approved in concept Tuesday by the City Council but was 
sent back to the Public Works Department for modifications. 
</P>
<P>
After six months of study, the department has proposed fees averaging $1,953 
per single-family house. Community Redevelopment Authority projects, senior 
citizen housing projects and city-supported projects would be exempted. 
</P>
<P>
But Tuesday, council members said the proposed fees were too high and asked 
Public Works Director Bob Pinniger to cut them by half. "We should be 
conservative," Councilman Dan Morgan said. "Developers need to share in costs, 
but we need to be mindful of their contribution as well."

DRUG PROGRAM SITE OPPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Directors, responding to a query by Rep. Edward R. Roybal (D-Los 
Angeles), unanimously voted Tuesday to reject a proposal to house a drug 
rehabilitation program in a federally owned building on Green Street east of 
Lake Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a neighborhood of smaller businesses -- antique stores, tailors, 
restaurants -- and it's surrounded by residences," Director William Thomson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It ought not to be used for institutional purposes." 
</P>
<P>
Roybal, who represents part of Pasadena and is a member of the House 
Appropriations Committee, had sought the city's reaction to a plan to let 
Phoenix House, a New York-based drug treatment program, take over the vacant 
building at 1030 E. Green St. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. General Services Administration has proposed using $2 million in 
federal funds to rehabilitate the building for the program, but owners of 
neighborhood businesses have objected. 
</P>
<P>
The final decision rests with federal authorities.

Plan to Cut Water Use OKd 
</P>
<P>
Officially noting that the city is in its fourth year of drought, the Board of 
Directors voted Tuesday to implement voluntary restraints on water use, 
including sending drought-buster field crews into city neighborhoods to 
identify water-wasters. 
</P>
<P>
If that gets no response, board members indicated, they are prepared to impose 
rationing. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, field workers will encourage apartment dwellers to install 
high-efficiency shower heads, faucet aerators and toilet dams. The city is also 
working to restore four contaminated wells in the Arroyo Seco to service by 
installing a treatment plant. The Metropolitan Water District, which supplies 
60% of Pasadena's water, has urged the city to reduce water consumption by 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Director Rick Cole suggested that the city's conservation efforts might be more 
effective if those who use a large amount of water were billed at a higher 
rate. "We should make people pay for the water they waste," he said. The 
voluntary restraints, he said, are "a thimbleful of solution to a bucketful of 
problems."

TORRANCE GOES DOWN SWINGING AGAINST HART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART MATTHEWS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kym Weil threw seven innings of fastballs past Torrance High batters to pitch 
Hart to a 3-0 second-round victory in the Southern Section 4-A softball 
playoffs at Charles Wilson Park in Torrance Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Weil (26-2) struck out 16 and gave up only four infield singles. 
</P>
<P>
She also added to her Southern Section record for career victories with 87. 
Earlier this season, Weil broke the mark of 81 set by Gahr's De De Weiman from 
1986-89. Weiman is now pitching for UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew what we were going up against," Torrance Coach John Jackson said. "We 
knew she was going to be tough, so we practiced against quicker pitching -- 
especially the risers and drop balls. But I guess it wasn't enough." 
</P>
<P>
Bay League champion Torrance finished 17-3. Hart (27-3), the top-seeded team in 
the division, will face Pacificia, a 4-3 winner over Hacienda Heights Wilson, 
in Friday's quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Weil will attend the University of Hawaii next year, along with catcher 
Stephanie Keeler. Weil has pitched all but two games for Hart, amassing a 
staggering 202 innings and 318 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
She does aerobics every day to stay in shape for her heavy pitching load. 
</P>
<P>
"The pressure builds every game," she said. "Every round we play, the teams we 
face get better. But I tend to pitch better under pressure." 
</P>
<P>
She pitched a no-hitter last week against Rio Mesa to boost Hart into the 
second round. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, she lowered her earned-run average to 0.31, striking out every 
Torrance batter except for leadoff hitter Jenny Yokoyama. 
</P>
<P>
Hart got all the runs it needed in the third inning. Torrance pitcher Jamie 
Sibley walked the first two hitters of the inning, and Nicole White followed 
with an infield hit to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Yokoyama, Torrance's shortstop, made a rare throwing error on the next play 
that allowed two runs to score. Yokoyama handled eight other tough chances 
without an error. 
</P>
<P>
Hart added an insurance run in the fourth when shortstop Krissy Carpenter drove 
home Casey O'Brien with a double down the left-field line. 
</P>
<P>
"We hit the ball hard all game, but mostly it went right at them," said Hart 
Coach Al Weil, who is Kym's father. "So we went to other things, like bunting, 
to put the ball in play."

'CIVIL LIBERTIES' MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Directors voted Tuesday to keep alive a proposed "civil liberties 
ordinance," although several directors said they aren't sure it is needed. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance would guarantee people's right to register voters, solicit money 
for charitable organizations and gather signatures on petitions in open 
facilities such as shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted 6 to 1 to send the measure to the city Human Services 
Commission and to the board's legislative subcommittee for further review. 
</P>
<P>
Director John Crowley, contending that civil liberties are adequately protected 
by state and federal laws, voted to kill the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Director William Thomson also said the measure may not be necessary, and added: 
"It's not on its way to passage in its present form. I'd describe it as having 
escaped being buried." 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance was proposed by Pasadena attorney Dale Gronemeier, who described 
it as "an opportunity to lock in strong protections" against violations of 
civil liberties. It includes criminal penalties of up to six months in jail and 
a $5,000 fine for those who obstruct protected activities. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking against the measure were representatives of H-CHH Partners, owners of 
Plaza Pasadena, which is involved in litigation to prevent a political group, 
represented by Gronemeier, from circulating petitions inside the mall.

<P>
Eleven citizens and six police officers will receive awards for heroism and 
community service at the Police Department's 19th annual Police/Citizens Awards 
Luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
The recipients include five men who subdued a bottle-wielding church robber, a 
man who saved a woman from drowning in a Hastings Ranch swimming pool, three 
cellular-phone tipsters who foiled robberies and two officers and a passer-by 
who helped rescue a would-be suicide on the Colorado Boulevard Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Chris Hagerty and Robert Edgerly, the city's director of adminstrative 
services, will share the Police Chief's Special Award for "spearheading the 
design and construction of a new state-of-the-art police facility and jail." 
</P>
<P>
The $17-million Pasadena police headquarters, on which construction workers are 
putting the finishing touches, is scheduled to be dedicated next month. 
</P>
<P>
The other recipients to be honored at the luncheon today are: 
</P>
<P>
* Morris Goodson, Leon Robertson, Leon Hudspeth, Thomas Dean and Thermon 
Holliday, who were participating in a Bible study group last October when an 
intruder put a broken bottle to a woman's neck and demanded that church members 
hand over their money. When the assailant tried to get away, the five men 
subdued him. 
</P>
<P>
"One hit him with a chair, another tackled him, the rest held him down," said 
Community Relations Officer Tom Delgado. 
</P>
<P>
* Robert Jones Jr., who pulled an unconscious woman from the bottom of a 
swimming pool in June and administered artificial respiration until paramedics 
arrived. His action saved the woman's life. 
</P>
<P>
* Nazo Manoukian and Traci Auzenne, who spotted a man stealing a car, followed 
him and notified police of the crime via a cellular telephone. During the 
chase, the robber pulled out a handgun and fired twice at Manoukian and 
Auzenne. 
</P>

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Transmittable Diseases 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 199 to 187, the House adopted an amendment permitting employers to 
switch workers with transmittable diseases such as AIDS from food-handling 
positions to other jobs atno loss of pay. This occurred as the House debated 
legislation (HR 2273) to protect the estimated 43 million disabled Americans 
against discrimination in public accommodations, on the job and in receiving 
basic services. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans With Disabilities Act remained in debate. 
</P>
<P>
Amendment supporter Charlie Rose (D-N.C.) said, "Don't ask me to risk the 
health of myself and my family in order to prove how unprejudiced I am about 
communicable diseases." 
</P>
<P>
Roy J. Rowland (D-Ga.) said there is no medical evidence of AIDS being spread 
by food, adding, "We should not here in the Congress be making decisions about 
what are infectious and contagious diseases." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote supported the amendment.

Cost to Employers 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 187 to 213, the House rejected an amendment to limit the cost to 
businesses of accommodating disabled workers under the Americans with 
Disabilities Act (above). The cost of providing for a handicapped employee was 
to have been capped at 10% of the pay for the job in question. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Bill McCollum (R-Fla.) said, "This is the small-business amendment in 
this legislation." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Bruce A. Morrison (D-Conn.) said, "Arbitrary formula limits are not 
what this legislation is about." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to cap the bill's cost to employers.

IT'S A LONG WAY FROM THE DIAMOND KITES OF YOUTH TO THE HIGH-SPEED MARVELS OF

Flying a kite is not at all like it used to be. Just ask Ed Back, manager of 
the Village Kite and Toy Store in Ventura Harbor Village and coordinator of the 
annual Memorial Day kite flying competition. Just ask him what happened to his 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
"My little sidekick Ed Hotchkiss and I were flying a stack of kites where we go 
skiing up and down the beach," Back said. "It's got so much power it drags you 
across the beach like you were water skiing. Ed got turned around backward. He 
was being dragged head-first and it pulled his pants down. Right there on the 
beach. Everyone saw it. It was great." 
</P>
<P>
That much power in a kite is not unusual; speeds often reach 100 m.p.h. (The 
record, by the way, was set by a South Carolina man who flew his kite in the 
middle of Hurricane Hugo and reached 120 m.p.h. Unfortunately, just after 
setting the record, his cord broke and he dislocated his shoulder.) 
</P>
<P>
"What we used to fly as kids were diamond kites. Aerodynamically they shouldn't 
fly," Back said. "Now they've really gone scientific and high-tech. They'll 
just fly right off your fingertips. They'll sit in the sky as steady as a rock 
. . . not that a rock can fly." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's competition is open to the public. Kites will be flying from "wind up 
to wind down" (10 a.m.-6 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
There's going to be a seance on Santa Cruz Island this weekend. Sure, fireworks 
would be a more traditional way to mark Memorial Day, but some of the workers 
are fed up with the ghost or ghosts residing in the bunkhouse on Christy Ranch, 
a lodging area for visitors. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll check out some story about a haunted room and a ghostly woman in green 
who likes to sing," said noted local ghostbuster Richard Senate. "It goes back 
at least to the '20s. It's so haunted many people who work there won't sleep 
near the room, let alone in it." 
</P>
<P>
Guide Keith Herold doesn't know where the green lady story came from, but he 
knows he experienced something odd. 
</P>
<P>
"It was late last fall," he said. "It was about 10 at night. It was just the 
cook and myself in the bunkhouse here. Everyone else was out bird watching. I 
had just finished washing the floor and I walked outside for a minute. I came 
back and the cook was walking by the trash can and the top was twirling. He 
said he didn't touch it. I kept on mopping. There were books stacked on a 
microwave. Almost all of the books flew off. They were all bird books. Then we 
heard a really heavy voice say, 'Bird.' " 
</P>
<P>
So how will it affect business? The Del Coronado in San Diego "has a haunted 
room and it's requested all the time," said Dick Fuller of Channel Islands 
Adventures, which offers overnight trips. "It's not like the entire place is 
haunted. It's not Friday 13th nasty stuff." LEO SMITH

JAVIER GOMEZ STARTED DANCE AND THEATER GROUPS TO TEACH YOUTHS ABOUT THEIR 
MEXICAN ROOTS.

<P>
Javier Gomez was trying to play "Cielto Lindo," a traditional Mexican song, on 
his newly bought used piano. 
</P>
<P>
"My children have been taking lessons at school," Gomez said, "so I bought the 
piano for them to practice on. I'd like them to learn some mariachi-type 
music." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Durango, Mexico, Gomez, who turned 40 last month, believes that 
learning about and participating in the traditions of one's culture are not 
luxuries; they are essential parts of a person's total growth. "For my children 
this is one thing they have no choice in. It's like eating -- they must do it." 
</P>
<P>
All three children were given Aztec names. Both of his daughters, 
Xochiquetzaltzin, 17, and Tonantzin, 13, and his son, Anahuac, 14, dance for 
the Ballet Folklorica Regional, a dance company Gomez has headed for seven 
years. And Xochiquetzaltzin is currently acting in the bilingual play "Trucha 
Raza la Revencha" or "Look Out People, the Revenge Is Coming." The play was 
written and directed by Gomez, who organized the theater group Teatro Inlakech 
more than 14 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The play was first staged a little over a decade ago. It examines the 
phenomenon of youth gangs and killings that took place in the county in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez decided to restage "Trucha Raza la Revencha" because of the new surge of 
gangs forming in the county. According to his research, 13 new gangs have 
appeared in just the last year. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids are doing the usual things that kids have been doing for 
generations," he said. "If two kids from two groups get into a fight all their 
friends gather around and watch. That's been going on for years. But what's 
changed is that now it's called gang violence." 
</P>
<P>
That's where Javier Gomez comes in. He runs the theater and dance groups for 
young Chicanos as an alternative to joining gangs. It gives the young people 
something to do. Plus it teaches them about their culture. 
</P>
<P>
"The home, the family; that is what's important," Gomez said. "When there's a 
breakdown in the family, there's a breakdown in society." 
</P>
<P>
Gomez's own home is filled with mementos of his family and heritage. 
</P>
<P>
In the hallway is a wooden wall hanging; a family tree Gomez created. "I 
visited my hometown, Ramon Corona, a few years ago to research my family 
history," said Gomez, who moved to the United States when he was 5. "While 
there I found that my grandfather had a deep respect for his heritage." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the house are various awards. Gomez isn't one to point them out. He 
just received Oxnard's performing arts award. Last year he was given the Oxnard 
Jaycees "Young Man of the Year Award." And he was chosen as the 1989-90 
"Teacher of the Year" at Haydock Intermediate School, and the bilingual 
"Teacher of the Year" for the district. 
</P>
<P>
Before beginning his teaching career, Gomez majored in Chicano studies at Cal 
State Northridge. While there, he learned one theory of the origins of the word 
Chicano. 
</P>
<P>
In Nahuatl, the Aztec language, 'Mexicano' breaks down into three words. Me 
means middle, xic is navel and ano is onto, he explained. "Meaning that a 
Mexican is born on the land located on top of the navel, or center, between the 
two American continents. But when they move, they are no longer in the middle, 
so the 'Me' is dropped off, leaving 'xicano,' which was eventually pronounced 
'Chicano.' 
</P>
<P>
"So when people born in Mexico leave their homeland, they will always remain 
connected to it, dangling from an umbilical cord from the navel." 
</P>
<P>
* THE DETAILS: "Trucha Raza la Revancha" will be performed tomorrow and 
Saturday nights, 8 p.m., at Haydock Intermediate School's auditorium, 647 West 
Hill St. General admission is $5 or $12 per family. Tickets are available at 
Haydock or at Oxnard College's student services window. 
</P>
<P>
The bilingual play, staged by Oxnard College's Theater Department, was written 
and directed by Javier Gomez.

HIS DREAM ENDING TURNED INTO A NIGHTMARE; 
</P>
<P>
PREP BASEBALL: CULVER CITY PITCHER ESTAVIL HAD A ROUGH TIME IN FIRST-ROUND 
PLAYOFF GAME AGAINST THOUSAND OAKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY RIPTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mauricio Estavil of Culver City would have liked to have made a more graceful 
exit from prep baseball than the one he had to endure last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Centaurs' star left-handed pitcher and outfielder would have preferred 
ending his high school career at Anaheim Stadium in the CIF-Southern Section 
5-A Division championship game. 
</P>
<P>
He would have liked to have thrown a no-hit game in the 5-A final and brought 
his third-seeded team a Southern Section title. 
</P>
<P>
But that was not to be. 
</P>
<P>
In a first-round playoff game at Culver City High on Thursday, Thousand Oaks, 
the third-place team in the Marmonte League, treated Estavil like an ordinary 
pitcher. Worse than that, the Lancers gave him the bum's rush, routing the 
Centaurs, 10-1, and ousting them from the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Estavil, who had an 8-0 record in Ocean League play as Culver won the league 
championship, had the worst day of his prep pitching career. 
</P>
<P>
During the season, he had pitched a no-hitter, two one-hitters, three 
two-hitters and a three-hitter. But his outing against Thousand Oaks was more 
notable for the three batters he hit, for the five bases on balls he issued, 
for the nine runs he gave up -- five of them earned -- in 4 2/3 innings than 
for the five hits he surrendered to the Lancers. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not a very good time to have a bad day," Estavil said. 
</P>
<P>
He had no excuses for his performance. "I knew they were a good-hitting team, 
but I wasn't nervous. It just wasn't there. 
</P>
<P>
"My fastball and curve ball weren't there. I tried to finesse, but that didn't 
work. I knew I didn't have my fastball, and I tried to mix it up with my curve 
-- but I wasn't getting that over either." 
</P>
<P>
Both pitches worked well for him for most of the season and last year, when he 
was a part-time pitcher who was more noted for being a hard-hitting right 
fielder. But even pitching only once in a while last year, he tossed a 
no-hitter and struck out 17 batters in another game. 
</P>
<P>
In his four years on the Culver varsity, he hit and pitched well enough to 
attract attention of college and major league scouts, well enough to earn a 
scholarship to Pepperdine University, where he plans to enroll next fall. 
</P>
<P>
Against Thousand Oaks, he had a day "like all good left-handers do at some time 
in their lives," said Art Harris, who scouts for the Dodgers and was the coach 
of strong baseball programs at West Los Angeles College and Venice High. 
</P>
<P>
Harris said that he has seen enough of Estavil on good days to realize that his 
poor performance last week was an aberration. "A good left-handed pitcher at 
the high school level can be overwhelming, and he has been overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember him on one gray afternoon when the hitters weren't even flinching 
but were just standing there, trying to react. He throws the ball very well." 
</P>
<P>
He hits and plays the outfield the same way and will probably be used both as a 
pitcher and outfielder at Pepperdine. Bill Springman, Pepperdine's top 
assistant who does much of the recruiting for the Waves, said he feels that 
Estavil, a 6-foot, 175-pounder who bats from the left side, "will help us out 
pitching . . . and at the plate," either as a designated hitter or as an 
outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
As a pitcher, Springman said, Estavil "has a fastball, curve and change, and he 
throws them all for strikes. He keeps hitters off balance and is a very, very 
good competitor." 
</P>
<P>
Estavil said that in both Little League and Babe Ruth youth baseball he was "a 
pitcher most of the time, but in high school I concentrated on hitting." He 
said that other colleges were interested in his hitting but that Pepperdine 
also wanted him as a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he doesn't know yet whether his hitting or pitching will take him 
farther if he should get the chance to play major league baseball. And he is 
likely to get the chance, if not in this June's major league draft, then after 
his junior year at Pepperdine -- the soonest he can be drafted if he continues 
to play college ball. 
</P>
<P>
Harris thinks that Estavil has the potential to play in the major leagues but 
that he will benefit from playing in college. "He's the kind of kid who 
certainly will be followed closely when he gets to Pepperdine, and, within the 
normal progression, he should be considered a professional prospect. 
</P>
<P>
"One, he can hit. Two, he can throw. Immediately, that's two pluses." In three 
years at Pepperdine, Harris said, "he should fill out and is going to get 
stronger. If he shows some signs of hitting for power, that's another plus." 
</P>
<P>
Harris said that he thinks Estavil might have a brighter future playing every 
day in the outfield, but that he does not rule out the possibility that the 
youngster could pitch in the major leagues -- if he gets someone to work with 
him on pitching and develops "a good off-speed pitch and (a better) breaking 
ball." 
</P>
<P>
Estavil's favorite players are Babe Ruth and Reggie Jackson, both known for 
their hitting, although Ruth was an excellent pitcher early in his career for 
the Boston Red Sox before he was sold to the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Estavil said that he "always considered myself as a hitter, 
but it depends how far my pitching goes. You never know." Estavil, like Harris, 
believes he needs more specialized coaching to develop as a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Estavil was born in Madrid after his family fled Cuba for Spain, and he and his 
family came to the United States when he was about 2 years old. He said he has 
seen Ruth only in newsreels but that the baseball immortal made a deep 
impression on him. 
</P>
<P>
"He was left-handed, and I liked the way he played and swung the bat." 
</P>
<P>
He said that if he is drafted in June, he will accept an offer from a major 
league team only if he is picked in an early round and is offered good money. 
</P>
<P>
If he is a late-round draft choice, he said, "I'd go to college because I want 
the education to fall back on. Baseball is a long, hard pull." 
</P>
<P>
Harris said that Estavil is a legitimate candidate for this year's draft but 
that the fact that he has "committed to Pepperdine might scare off some 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Estavil will probably spend the next three years pitching and hitting for 
Pepperdine because," he said, "I'll get a chance to play every day. But I also 
want to pitch because you have control of the game." 
</P>

STATE-OPERATED HATCHERY OFFERS VISITORS AN UP-CLOSE LOOK AT THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
RAINBOW TROUT.

<P>
When your children ask, "'Where do fish come from?" is your only answer, "The 
market"? If that's the case, it may be time for a family outing to the Fillmore 
Fish Hatchery. 
</P>
<P>
Located just east of town on the south side of California 126, the facility is 
one of 21 hatcheries operated by the state Department of Fish and Game. 
Although there are no formal tours, it is open to the public, and visitors will 
find hundreds of thousands of rainbow trout -- ranging in size from 
half-inch-long youngsters called "fry" to 14-inchers just about ready to be 
sent to nearby lakes. 
</P>
<P>
"Rainbow trout are easy to raise, very adaptable to Southern California climate 
and fairly easy for a fisherman to catch," said hatchery manager Jim Adams, 41, 
who along with most of his staff lives on the 27-acre facility. "The hatchery 
belongs to the anglers of the state, so everyone is more than welcome to come 
by and take a look." 
</P>
<P>
Once inside the gates, visitors are confronted by four parallel 1,000-foot-long 
concrete water troughs, called raceways, each one divided into 100-foot 
sections by baffles. In each section is a different age group of trout, the 
segregation mandatory because bigger fish tend to eat smaller fish, and trout 
are no exception. 
</P>
<P>
The baffles do more than just separate the various sizes of fish, however. A 
series of large pumps keep the raceway water, drawn mostly from underground 
wells, moving vigorously, the baffles acting as obstacles that "rough up" the 
current, which in turn allows more oxygen to reach the fish. In the truest 
sense of conservation, the excess water irrigates nearby fields before 
percolating back into the ground. Eventually it will wind up back in the wells 
and again become part of the hatchery cycle. 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1942, the Fillmore hatchery originally raised largemouth bass and 
various warm-water species of fish until the early 1950s, when it focused 
exclusively on trout breeding. Today, about 1 million rainbow trout are 
produced here each year, with the facility serving all of San Luis Obispo, 
Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles counties. In addition, about 100,000 
fish are sent to Kern County. 
</P>
<P>
The hatchery cycle begins, Adams said, when fertilized trout eggs -- up to 
500,000 at a time -- are trucked in from a state broodstock hatchery in the 
Sierra Nevada Mountains four times a year. 
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, the eggs, packed in special Styrofoam cases, are put into indoor, 
water-filled, incubators. They usually hatch within five days. One to two weeks 
after hatching -- they're about a half-inch long when born -- the fry are put 
into their own 100-foot section of one of the raceways. 
</P>
<P>
Once in the general population, Adams said, the trout will grow approximately a 
half-inch to three-quarters of an inch in length per month. About one year 
later, the ready-to-be-planted fish are trucked to one of 45 lakes supplied by 
Fillmore. From there, a trout's longevity is determined by luck and the 
anglers. 
</P>
<P>
In ideal conditions, Adams said, trout can live about 10 years and fatten up to 
20 pounds, but "in the wild, because people catch them, they rarely live past 
five and usually don't grow past a couple of pounds." 
</P>
<P>
One area in which man has been able to improve on nature is trout-breeding 
periods. Traditionally, the fish spawns only once a year, but with the 
development of various strains of rainbow trout, spawning now occurs throughout 
the year, allowing a continual rotation of fish hatchery stock. Fillmore 
currently breeds Coleman, Hot Creek and Mt. Whitney strains. 
</P>
<P>
One must-see event that causes quite a stir in the fish population is feeding 
time, which happens throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
An employee drives a small cart with a motorized "fish-food thrower" mounted on 
the back down the aisles between the raceways, lobbing 20 to 30 pounds of 
pellets similar in shape to rabbit food into each 100-foot segment. "They eat a 
high-protein, high-mineral diet made of processed fish meal and meat meal," 
said Adams, adding that the hatchery uses 2,000 pounds of food every day and 
has the capacity to store 100,000 pounds at a time. 
</P>
<P>
With about 250,000 fish always on hand, the biggest threat to the hatchery in 
its 48-year history hasn't been drought or fire or someone with a fishing pole, 
said employees, but birds, in particular herons and egrets, which just love 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
"The sight of all those trout in one area was apparently just too much for the 
birds to ignore," said Adams, who estimated that in bad years he lost between 
10% to 25% of his fish that way. 
</P>
<P>
One of the less exciting moments for a visitor to the hatchery is watching 
workers clean the raceways of algae and fish excrement. Done with the aid of a 
scraping machine that slowly marches down the walls and bed of the raceway, the 
excrement becomes part of nature's fertilization process after leaving the 
hatchery. 
</P>
<P>
It may be an unpleasant job, but it is one, said workers, that everyone in this 
democratically run operation has to do. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody does everything," said Ellen Shepard, 30, as she worked her way 
through part of the raceway in rubberized wading overalls. Wielding a fish net, 
she was attempting to catch an errant trout in a section she was working on. 
"And that includes cleaning the ponds and feeding and putting out the fry. It's 
fascinating to watch them go from fry to plantable size." 
</P>
<P>
* THE DETAILS: The Fillmore Fish Hatchery, 612 E. Telegraph Road, Fillmore, is 
open to the public seven days a week, 365 days a year from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
Large groups might want to call in advance. There is no public telephone number 
at the hatchery. All inquiries should be made through the Long Beach office of 
the California Department of Fish and Game at (213) 590-5132.

AZUSA PACIFIC TO TRY FOR EIGHTH TITLE IN A ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Azusa Pacific University men's track team will try for an unprecedented 
eighth consecutive title when it competes in the National Assn. of 
Intercollegiate Athletics championships today-Saturday at Tarleton State 
University in Stephenville, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars will be led by senior weight thrower Ade Olukoju, who has won 12 
NAIA outdoor and indoor titles in his career. He enters the meet with NAIA 
bests of 63 feet, 9 1/2 inches in the shot put, 211-3 in the discus and 196-3 
in the hammer throw. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa Pacific also has a strong contingent of competitors in the decathlon 
headed by senior Brian Chapman, who has a season-best 6,691. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Terry Franson said a key to the team's success will be the performance of 
sophomore Eddie Carbin in the 110-meter high hurdles and long jump. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping he'll combine for a total of about 12 points in the long jump and 
hurdles," Franson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars will also count on points from Tommy Daniel and Brad Bowden in the 
hammer throw and Vince Beresford and Eric Whitcomb in the pole vault. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa Pacific is expected to face its toughest challenge for the title since it 
defeated runner-up Saginaw Valley State of Michigan by 16 points in 1984. Adams 
State of Colorado, Prairie View of Texas and Oklahoma Baptist should be in 
title contention. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect a close meet," Franson said. "Because we have a great deal of 
experience at the national meet, I expect our athletes to come through with 
flying colors. Whether or not that ends up in a team victory, we'll see after 
the 1,600-meter relay." 
</P>
<P>
But Franson said the Cougars have little margin for error. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall we can't have any major breakdowns and we need some surprise 
performances, especially from our people in the relays," he said. "Our four 
decathletes and four pole vaulters really need to come through strong." 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Los Angeles, which last season had its best record in men's 
basketball since 1986, has signed players to national letters of intent. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Eagles, who went 14-14 after a 4-48 record the previous two seasons, 
have added Jamal Ross and Kelvin Harris from El Camino College, Jermoine 
Brantley and Aaron Lattimore from Granada Hills High and Craig Martin from St. 
Monica High in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Ross and Harris helped El Camino reach the state community college semifinals 
the past two seasons. Ross is a 6-foot-7 forward and Harris a 6-5 swing man. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Henry Dyer said the pair should help replace forward LaVar Ball and guard 
Bruce Turner. 
</P>
<P>
Dyer said the signing of Brantley, Lattimore and Martin will improve the team's 
depth. 
</P>
<P>
Brantley, 5-11, 155-pound guard, earned all-North Valley League first-team 
honors last season and Lattimore, a 6-4 and 165 forward, was an all-North 
Valley League second-team selection. 
</P>
<P>
"Brantley is a pure point guard with a good handle on the ball," Dyer said. 
"He's a nice kid with a lot of heart and is real aggressive. Lattimore is a 
pretty good shooter and gets a lot of action on the boards." 
</P>
<P>
Dyer, a former running back for the Los Angeles Rams, says he has known about 
Martin for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a pretty good first step to the basket and is a pretty good defensive 
player," Dyer said. "He plays a lot like his dad (James) because I used to play 
at the recreation center along with his dad when I was playing for the Rams." 
</P>
<P>
The Azusa Pacific women's softball team has placed two players on the 
all-National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics District 3 first team and three 
on the second team. 
</P>
<P>
The first-team selections were sophomore infielder Kristi Van Zee and senior 
outfielder Tiffany Silvey. Van Zee led the district with a .411 average and 
also had two home runs and 13 RBIs. Silvey was among the leading hitters in the 
district at .316. 
</P>
<P>
Second-team selections were freshman pitcher Julie Todd, senior catcher Lisa 
Perry and senior outfielder Stephanie Perdomo. The Cougars (19-19) finished 
fourth in the district. 
</P>
<P>
After its 12th consecutive winning season, Citrus College (21-20) had three of 
its players selected to the all-Foothill Conference baseball squad. 
</P>
<P>
The players are sophomore pitcher Ralph Montenegro, freshman outfielder Dave 
Richards and freshman utility player Mike Collett. Montenegro was 5-2 with a 
3.17 earned-run average, Richards batted .329 and Collett batted .353 and was 
2-3 with three saves as a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. San Antonio College of Walnut has two players on the all-South Coast 
Conference first team and two on the second team. 
</P>
<P>
First-team selections were freshman outfielder Tony Fusco, who finished fifth 
in the conference with a .417 average, and freshman designated hitter Marcos 
Garcia, who was seventh at .380. 
</P>
<P>
The second-team choices were sophomore catcher Alain Duhart, who batted .289, 
and freshman shortstop John Strycula, who batted .324. 
</P>
<P>
For the third consecutive season, Nicky Luce of Cal Poly Pomona has been named 
to the all-Big West Conference team in women's softball. 
</P>
<P>
Luce, a junior, received honorable mention as a utility player after a 14-12 
record and 0.96 ERA. She also played second base and hit .247. She was the only 
Bronco named to the squad in Pomona's final season in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos, who finished at 34-32 and 16-20 in the Big West, will compete as 
an independent next season.

TEMPLE CITY VAULTER MARSTON BATTLES BACK TO REACH NEW HEIGHTS; 
</P>
<P>
TRACK: AFTER BATTLING A TUMOR AND MONONUCLEOSIS, HE RETURNS TO HIS SPORT AND 
SETS A SCHOOL RECORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With his senior year at Temple City High winding down, everything appears to be 
falling into place for pole vaulter Brian Marston. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since he was a freshman, Marston has been able to compete 
for a full season and he is starting to see the rewards. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, the 18-year-old broke his own school record by vaulting 14-7 
1/2 at the Rio Hondo League track final. 
</P>
<P>
He has also advanced to the CIF Masters Meet Friday night at Cerritos College, 
where he hopes to qualify for the state track championships for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Marston can also look forward to next season, when he will continue his career 
as a pole vaulter at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
It's a future filled with promise that he never could have envisioned only a 
couple of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
For Marston, it was a nightmare that began innocently enough with a trip to the 
doctor for dental X-rays early in his sophomore year in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Only in viewing the X-rays, he said, did a doctor discover an unusual growth 
developing in his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to get my teeth X-rayed and as far as the doctor could tell it looked 
like I was missing a tooth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So he referred Marston to Dr. Leonard Churchman, a Pasadena dentist who 
performed a biopsy on the growth in December of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"They went and did the biopsy and the doctor said he'd never seen anything like 
that before," Marston said. 
</P>
<P>
It was Churchman who told Marston to see Dr. H. William Fister, an 
Arcadia-based facial tumor specialist who determined that a large malignant 
tumor had formed in Marston's sinus cavity. 
</P>
<P>
Fister recommended surgery to remove the tumor, and he operated on Marston in 
early March, 1988, at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time I had the surgery, from the time it (the tumor) was first 
discovered, it had really grown," Marston said. "They said that if it hadn't 
been stopped it would've eventually grown into my left eye. It wasn't life 
threatening but I probably would've lost an eye." 
</P>
<P>
The surgery was successful but it was not without its side affects. To reach 
the sinus cavity, the doctor had to remove half of Marston's palate and upper 
jaw along with five teeth. In its place they inserted part a false jaw and 
teeth. 
</P>
<P>
"When they first took the biopsy I didn't know what to expect," Marston said. 
"Even up to the major surgery, I didn't really know they were going to take all 
of that out. I woke up from surgery and it was like, 'Wow! They did all that?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
After a one-week stay in the hospital, Marston was instructed by his doctor not 
to start pole vaulting again for a minimum of three to four weeks. But after 
another week at home, Marston was back vaulting again. 
</P>
<P>
Said Marston: "I went back to practice that week and (my teammates) said, 'Can 
you jump?' and I said, 'I don't know.' So I jumped and my mom was freaking out 
about it because I wasn't supposed to jump for at least three weeks after the 
surgery." 
</P>
<P>
At the time, he said, he simply wanted to return to his normal lifestyle as 
soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to get started with my life again," Marston said. "I didn't want 
to worry about it because if you let something like that bother you, you're 
never going to get anywhere in life." 
</P>
<P>
About the only thing Marston found that he couldn't do after the operation was 
play the trumpet, which he had done since he was in the fourth grade. 
</P>
<P>
So Marston channeled his musical energy toward the drums. He then become the 
drum major in the marching band as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
Since his surgery, Marston said there have been no signs of recurrence of the 
tumor. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tumor but it wasn't cancerous," he said. "They got it all when they 
went in there and I've had several CAT scans since then and they've all been 
(negative)." 
</P>
<P>
But Marston's physical problems were not over. It was midway through his junior 
season when he developed mononucleosis. 
</P>
<P>
That forced him to miss two weeks of school. The week after he returned, 
Marston matched his season best in the pole vault of 13 feet, 6 inches. But he 
said he never returned to full strength, which was a key factor in why he went 
out at 12-0 in the pole vault at the Rio Hondo League final and didn't qualify 
for the CIF preliminaries. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't help that he had lost 15 pounds as a result of the illness. The 
5-foot-11 Marston normally weighs about 150 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"My legs were about as big around as my arms because I don't usually lift 
weights during the season," he said. "So I never really got the weight back." 
</P>
<P>
His coach at Temple City, Bill Martin, said it has been an inspiration to the 
rest of the team that Marston has made a smooth return to his event this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"For a lot of people who had the kind of problems that Brian had, it would have 
been very easy not to come back or to slack off," he said. "But I think Brian 
has always been a believer in himself and he just wouldn't have it any other 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Marston credits his success to being able to practice every day. He practices 
mostly with an off-campus coach, Brian Yokoyama -- a former Temple City pole 
vaulter who works with several high school vaulters in his track club called 
Team Ultimate High. 
</P>
<P>
"I go off with Brian Yokoyama and the guys from Upland (High School) and you 
wouldn't believe how much it helps to have some place to do workouts at all the 
time," he said. "In pole vaulting, being out even a week can hurt you." 
</P>
<P>
Although he has spent most of his career focusing on the pole vault, Marston 
didn't start out that way. As a freshman, he ran cross-country along with a 
longtime friend, Phil Sutliff. When Sutliff went out for track, he persuaded 
Marston to try the pole vault. 
</P>
<P>
"He was really into track and he wanted to pole vault," Marston said. "So he 
said, 'Come on, let's try the pole vault.' As it turned out, I ended up being 
very good at it and Phil didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Marston said he started competing on the freshman-sophomore team, but was moved 
up to the varsity after three meets. He posted bests of 12-6 as a sophomore and 
13-6 as a junior although he never advanced past the Rio Hondo League final. 
</P>
<P>
But he was a little concerned after he vaulted a school-record 14-5 1/2 early 
in the season. That is, until the league final rolled around. 
</P>
<P>
"I peaked real early in the season," he said. "I made 14-5 in a preseason meet 
and I just went down after that. I wasn't really making the heights that I 
should have. But then at the league final I went 14-7 1/2." 
</P>
<P>
It was a case of good fortune, he said, that he has qualified for the Masters 
Meet despite a below par effort of 13-6 at the CIF 2-A Division final last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"I was real lucky to make 13-6 at the CIF finals," he said. "I made it on my 
first try, too. The (assistant) coach from Northridge (Tim Warner) came by 
afterward and said I snaked through -- like I just got it." 
</P>
<P>
Martin said Marston has demonstrated marked improvement from last year to this 
season, but said he can get better. 
</P>
<P>
"He has some technical things that he can improve at but, technically speaking, 
vaulting is one of the toughest events in track and field," Martin said. "It 
might be the toughest." 
</P>
<P>
When he first started thinking about college, Marston said he figured that he 
would have to be content with attending Pasadena City College, a two-year 
community college.

"I hadn't heard from anyone," he said. "So I was just going to go to PCC and 
get some of my freshman work out of the way and then find a (four-year) school 
where I could pole vault at." 
</P>
<P>
That was until he received a call from Warner about attending Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Warner called me up and he asked me where I was going next year and 
said, 'How'd you like to go here?' So I went out there and saw what they did 
with their pole vaulters and I liked it." 
</P>
<P>
Marston did not receive a scholarship to Northridge but said he will be a bona 
fide member of the team in every other respect. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a scholarship, but this way at least I'll be able to get any pole 
that I need," he said. "The poles cost from $200 to $250 and there's no 
guarantee that they won't break." 
</P>
<P>
Although he is looking forward to college, Marston hopes he still has at least 
two more high school meets remaining. Having already reached the Masters, 
Marston is approaching the meet in his typically optimistic manner. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I can pull it off," he said. "I tied with three people at 13-6, so I 
really only have to beat them and one of the people at 14-0. I think I have a 
good chance knowing that I have already cleared that height." 
</P>
<P>
While he realizes it will not be easy, Marston already has developed a track 
record at meeting difficult challenges.

DAD'S DEAD, SOBBING SON SAID ON 911; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: POLICE TAPE OF ONE OF THE MENENDEZ BROTHERS ACCUSED OF KILLING THEIR 
PARENTS IS RELEASED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Police released a tape recording today of the emergency 911 call in which one 
of the Menendez brothers charged with their parents' killing reported the two 
slayings in a sobbing, gasping voice. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone killed my dad," were the first words choked out by the weeping caller 
as a woman dispatcher asked repeatedly, "What's the problem?" 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether the caller was Lyle Menendez, 22, or his brother, 
Erik, 19. Both are charged with the Aug. 20, 1989, shotgun slayings of 
entertainment executive Jose Menendez and his wife, Kitty, in their Beverly 
Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
The tape, which lasts about a minute, consists mostly of the young man sobbing 
and screaming while the dispatcher and an assistant try to calm him down long 
enough to find out what has happened. 
</P>
<P>
They asked him repeatedly who had been shot and after sobs and gasps he finally 
said, "My mom and dad." 
</P>
<P>
At one point the caller sobbed, "I came home and found them." 
</P>
<P>
The second dispatcher, who by then had joined the conversation trying to calm 
down the caller, asked who had been shot. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom and dad," the man sobbed. 
</P>
<P>
The call ended with a dispatcher saying that an ambulance was on the way and 
the young man continuing to cry. 
</P>
<P>
The tape also contains a brief call from the 911 dispatcher to the house but 
the tape quality made it difficult to decipher who was speaking. The only thing 
heard was a man's voice saying, "I'm outside." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that the boys committed the murders to collect a 
$14-million inheritance. Jose Menendez was an executive with Live Entertainment 
Inc., a video distribution company.

BUSH CITES REGULATIONS IN VETOING AMTRAK FUNDS

President Bush today vetoed a bill authorizing funds for Amtrak, the nation's 
rail passenger service, protesting a provision to bring railroad acquisitions 
under new government scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said the provision "represents a step backward for the entire rail 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
It was Bush's first veto of 1990. He vetoed 10 measures last year and has yet 
to have one overturned. 
</P>
<P>
In a veto message to Congress, Bush criticized a provision that would require 
the government to review and approve proposed acquisitions of railroads by 
non-railroad companies and organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"This new regulatory burden would interfere with the ability of the nation's 
largest freight railroads to obtain needed capital or to change existing 
capital structure," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
He said it would even subject to new scrutiny attempts to take over a rail line 
by "a carrier's own management or employees." 
</P>
<P>
"This requirement is an unwarranted regulatory roadblock to financial 
restructuring of the railroad industry," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
He said there is also adequate protection under existing law "to protect the 
public interest in acquisition situations." 
</P>
<P>
The provision would require Interstate Commerce Commission approval of all 
railroad takeovers by non-railroad companies.

WITNESSES, MOTIVE ELUSIVE IN CINCO DE MAYO SLAYING AT PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Napoleon Armando Rivera went to Sepulveda Recreation Center on Cinco de Mayo to 
relax and listen to music. Late that evening, Los Angeles police found his body 
on a sidewalk next to the park. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly three weeks later, detectives have no suspects in the fatal shooting 
they believe may have occurred during a robbery. But what is more baffling to 
them is that they have no witnesses -- although hundreds of people are believed 
to have been at the park that evening -- and that the person who reported the 
incident called from a pay phone more than a mile from the park. 
</P>
<P>
"This happened in a park on Cinco de Mayo and we can't find any witnesses," 
Detective James Vojtecky said today. "We feel there had to have been people 
here but we haven't been able to find them. It's a strange case because we are 
spending our time trying to identify witnesses before we can identify a 
suspect." 
</P>
<P>
Rivera, 28, of Panorama City, was an El Salvadoran immigrant who worked at a 
McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
On the evening of Saturday, May 5, investigators believe that hundreds of area 
residents were at the park at Kester Avenue and Parthenia Street to celebrate 
Cinco de Mayo with live music and family picnics. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Rivera was shot at about 10 p.m., investigators concede that the 
number of people in the park had probably thinned considerably. But at a press 
conference at the park this morning, investigators said they are looking for 
anyone who might have witnessed the shooting or seen Rivera earlier in the 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Phil Morritt said police were not alerted to the shooting until 11 
p.m. when a man made a 911 call from a pay phone at Roscoe Boulevard and 
Woodman Avenue, more than a mile away. "When officers arrived at the park there 
was no one here," Morritt said. "They found the body." 
</P>
<P>
Police said they are attempting to find the caller because there is a chance he 
may have seen the shooting or something that will aid the investigation. 
Morritt said the man, a Latino, told the emergency operator his name is Mario 
and that he lives in North Hollywood. He said he left the park before calling 
because he was with his 7-month-old son.

An associate of imprisoned crime boss Nicodemo Scarfo was shot to death early 
today while parking his car near his home, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities believe more than one gunman was involved but there were no 
suspects in custody. Police searched rooftops in the area of the shooting in 
search of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Louis (Irish Louie) DeLuca, 51, was shot four times at 12:47 a.m. while he was 
parking his car near his house, Police Capt. Richard DeLise said. He died at 
1:38 a.m. at Methodist Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The windows of his brown Cadillac were blown out by the bullets. A .32-caliber 
automatic pistol and a .38-caliber revolver were recovered at the scene.

BUSH BLAMES CONGRESS FOR BUDGET DEFICIT

President Bush today put most of the blame for the federal budget deficit on 
Congress and said he wouldn't lay out his proposals for cutting the red ink 
because that would undermine talks with Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
"If I outlined the problem now, I'd rely on some of the fact that the Congress 
appropriates all the money and raises all the revenues. . . . I will point out 
that people understand that the Congress bears a greater responsibility for 
this," Bush said at a news conference when asked about his refusal to publicly 
lay out his plan for cutting the U.S. budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm not trying to assign blame. That's why I'm not doing it right now," he 
said with a smile as reporters exploded in laughter. 
</P>
<P>
"If I go out now and say what I think . . . I might say something like I just 
said, and I don't want to do that," a grinning Bush added. 
</P>
<P>
Bush called the talks because higher interest rates, weakness in the economy 
and rising costs for shoring up the savings and loan industry have pushed the 
deficit far higher than expected. 
</P>
<P>
The Gramm-Rudman budget law could force automatic spending cuts of more than 
$70 billion unless a deal is worked out. Cuts of that magnitude would likely 
hit basic government services and programs and could spell trouble for 
congressmen seeking reelection in November.

The American Civil Liberties Union is joining forces with Tammy Faye Bakker in 
efforts to overturn a zoning ban against church services in a warehouse area. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Keiner, the ACLU's Central Florida chairman, said there is no compelling 
reason to prohibit religious services in an industrial area, where peace and 
quiet are not as important as they would be in a residential area. 
</P>
<P>
Bakker and her husband, Jim, set up their New Covenant Ministries in Orlando 
last year, before he began serving a 45-year federal prison term in connection 
with fund-raising activities in their former PTL television ministry. 
</P>
<P>
It has been housed in a shopping mall, a hotel, a piano shop and lately in an 
industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
After one Sunday service, Orange County zoning officials said that while she 
could operate a broadcasting studio, no church services would be permitted.

ISRAEL WON'T ACCEPT U.N. OBSERVERS; 
</P>

MIDEAST: PALESTINIANS HAVE REQUESTED A NEUTRAL FORCE FOR PROTECTION. ISRAEL'S 
FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS HE IS COUNTING ON THE U.S. TO VETO THE PROPOSAL.

Israel will not allow U.N. observers into the occupied territories to safeguard 
the Palestinian population even if the U.N. Security Council approves the 
proposal, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said today 
</P>
<P>
Palestinians have requested U.N. observers to protect the 1.7 million Arabs in 
the occupied territories from the Israeli army. Most of the 710 Palestinians 
killed in the 29-month-old uprising have been slain by army gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat is expected to propose the observer force to a 
Friday session of the 15-nation council in Geneva. U.S. Secretary of State 
James A. Baker III has said the United States is prepared to discuss the issue. 
</P>
<P>
But Arens said today he hoped that the Security Council would not approve the 
force. "I hope that this is not going to take place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If it does, he said, "Israel would not accept U.N. observers on territory under 
Israeli control." 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials say Israel is legally responsible for administering the 
territory, seized in war, and that foreign observers are already present in the 
form of U.N. relief staff, Red Cross officials, foreign aid workers and 
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel there is no justification for the stationing of U.N. observers in 
areas that are legitimately under Israeli control and came under Israeli 
control as a result of Arab aggression in 1967," Arens said. 
</P>
<P>
Arens said Israel was counting on the United States to veto the U.N. 
resolution. He said it was crucial that Israel get a chance to explain that a 
veto was of "the utmost importance." 
</P>
<P>
Also today, a 15-year-old Palestinian died after being shot by soldiers in an 
overnight clash, and the army lifted curfews in the West Bank that had confined 
about a million Palestinians to their homes since Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Refugee camps and towns in the Gaza Strip remained under stay-at-home orders, 
except for three small villages. The curfews were to quell rioting that began 
Sunday when an apparently deranged Israeli shot and killed seven Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
Labor leader Shimon Peres also rejected the idea of observers but blamed Shamir 
for plummeting relations with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is not one act or another by the United States. The question is 
the deterioration in relations between us and the United States that is getting 
stronger," Peres said on Israel radio.

Fifty years after defeat stared Britain in the face, the "Little Ships of 
Dunkirk" sailed again today, from the White Cliffs of Dover to the French 
Channel port where the civilian armada plucked a defeated army to safety and 
changed the course of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-six veteran pleasure boats and cabin cruisers were going back to mark 
the 50th anniversary of what Winston Churchill called a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
Dover's white cliffs and harbor walls were lined with cheering spectators as 
the 76 surviving boats set sail. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, up to 7,000 Dunkirk veterans are expected to gather on the beaches 
near the port for a religious service to mark the anniversary. The little ships 
will form a circle offshore into which a memorial wreath will be dropped from a 
helicopter.

The Atlanta-based company said that the plant is no longer profitable and that

Georgia-Pacific said it has given employees 60 days notice of the closing, as

AIRLINE FARE WAR GETS HOTTER AS UNITED MATCHES TWA CUTS

<P>
United Airlines today escalated its scramble for summer vacationers' dollars, 
saying it will match TWA's deep fare cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The lure of a larger share of the vacation travel market was leading the 
nation's big airlines this week to break with tradition and discount some of 
their domestic ticket prices during the busy summer season. 
</P>
<P>
The latest air fare war began when United placed newspaper advertisements on 
Monday containing coupons good for $35 off round-trip tickets of $175 or more. 
</P>
<P>
A day later, Trans World Airlines cut some of its domestic round-trip fares by 
up to 30%, and American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, USAir and Continental 
Airlines announced Wednesday they also were lowering their ticket prices. 
</P>
<P>
Today United, which said it had offered the coupons only in response to 
promotions by some of its competitors, said it was also matching the TWA 
reductions. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts say that so far, the fare cuts pose little danger to the 
companies' earnings. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some diminishing returns as far as profitability, but you don't give 
up market share to someone else," said Paul H. Nisbet, an analyst with 
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.

The Soviet Union presents huge opportunities for foreign insurers if it 
succeeds in reforming its economy, the chairman of the Lloyd's of London 
insurance market said today. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be optimistic and take the view that they're going to become part 
of the modern world in which case there has to be a colossal opportunity," 
Murray Lawrence told a wire service. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence is heading a Lloyd's team in Moscow for talks with Soviet state 
insurance companies to see what role the world's largest insurance market could 
play in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>

JAL ORDERS ANOTHER 20 747-400S FROM BOEING

Japan Airlines Co., Japan's largest airline and Boeing Co.'s biggest customer, 
said today it has ordered 20 Boeing 747-400 jetliners and taken options to buy 
34 more. 
</P>
<P>
The deal would total nearly $12 billion if all the options are exercised, said 
JAL spokesman Sumitaka Kawamura. 
</P>
<P>
The new order brings to 74 the number of orders and options JAL has placed for 
Boeing's largest jumbo jet. 
</P>
<P>
JAL received five of the 74 planes by March and will receive the rest by 1999 
"if our plans are not changed," Kawamura said. The carrier plans to increase 
its fleet from 100 planes to 170 over the next nine years to meet an expected 
increase in passenger traffic, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Japan Broadcasting Corp. said the orders will help reduce Japan's trade surplus 
with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The 747-400, with a range of 8,400 miles, is one of the world's most 
sophisticated passenger aircraft. Its computer-aided piloting requires a 
cockpit crew of only two. 
</P>
<P>
JAL is Boeing's largest customer for 747-400 jets with 40 firm orders, Kawamura 
said, followed by Singapore Airlines with 29 and All Nippon Airways Co. of 
Japan with 26. 
</P>
<P>
Making up the JAL fleet, he said, are five 747-400s; 61 Boeing 747-100, -200 
and -300 jumbo jets; 20 McDonnell-Douglas DC-10s and 14 Boeing 767 planes. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the 747-400s, Kawamura said JAL ordered 10 McDonnell-Douglas MD-11s 
last month, with options for 10 more. 
</P>
<P>
The MD-11s are to be delivered between 1993 and 1998, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, we have no plans to make additional orders," Kawamura said. 
</P>
<P>
He said JAL carried 8.19 million passengers on international routes in fiscal 
1989, which ended on March 31, up 5.6% from a year earlier, and 13.5 million on 
domestic routes, up 13.3%.

Greta Garbo's estate said Wednesday that it had settled a suit with publishers 
Simon &amp; Schuster over whether a controversial book about the late movie 
star is fact or fiction. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed Friday, alleged that "Garbo: Her Story", by Antoni Gronowicz, 
is a work of fiction and that it should not be touted as a factual biography of 
the Swedish-born actress, who died last month in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the settlement were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit claimed that Simon &amp; Schuster falsely advertised that Garbo 
contributed to the book when in fact the reclusive actress consistently denied 
any involvement with it. 
</P>
<P>
Simon &amp; Schuster has said the book contains frank comments from Garbo about 
her lovers, including Mauritz Stiller, the director who discovered her.

FADING 'TWIN PEAKS' THREADS HANGING AT SEASON'S END

When the smoke cleared, FBI agent Dale Cooper had been shot three times. A 
prime suspect in Laura Palmer's slaying had been killed by her father. 
</P>
<P>
A lowlife had shot and possibly killed another prime suspect. 
</P>
<P>
And if that's not trouble enough in the Pacific Northwest logging town of Twin 
Peaks, a mysterious assailant beat mad Dr. Jacoby, Laura's psychiatrist and 
furtive sex partner. Jacoby, hiding at night near a gazebo, had just seen a 
woman he thought was Laura. 
</P>
<P>
Then Jacoby, considered a leading suspect by students of doings in the 
fictional TV town, suffered a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
But unanswered went the show's central question: who killed Laura Palmer? 
</P>
<P>
So it went Wednesday night in the season-ending episode of ABC's "Twin Peaks," 
the surreal, darkly comic David Lynch series that has become TV's most 
talked-about low-rated show this year. 
</P>
<P>
The finale won its time period in the 24-city overnight ratings, but didn't 
come close to the numbers of its much-publicized April 8 premiere, A. C. 
Nielsen Co. audience estimates showed today. 
</P>
<P>
The two-hour premiere got a rating of 21.7 and a 33 share. But its Nielsens 
started sliding immediately, and last week hit a low of 10.6. Each point 
represents 921,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's episode-ending shooting of FBI agent Cooper in his hotel room -- 
only the gunman's gloved hand was seen -- was only one of many closing-episode 
twists that will have "Twin Peaks" fans speculating who did what to whom until 
next fall, when the series resumes on Saturday nights. 
</P>
<P>
The finale left the series with more questions raised than answered. It had 
been kept under tight wraps by ABC, which had refused to provide TV writers 
with advance tapes of the show, lest what proved its non-endings leak out.

DAVID BOWIE STUMBLES AS HE LOOKS TO THE PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's hard to see where you're going when you're looking back. 
</P>
<P>
David Bowie's "Sound + Vision" tour offers a peculiar premise for a show by a 
big rock star: Nothing but old songs, and on top of that it's their final spin. 
After the tour, Bowie will no longer get lost in space as Major Tom or 
celebrate the sci-fi rock star Ziggy Stardust or encourage his fans to face 
their ch-ch-ch-changes. 
</P>
<P>
Is this a gimmick to drum up interest in the tour? A daring gesture to put his 
future artistry on the line? (The idea is that shelving his old favorites will 
force Bowie to rely on his new work.) Or is it a lazy way to stage an 
undemanding concert, avoiding the challenge of combining his past with his 
present? 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the slippery star's true motivation, the result on stage at the Los 
Angeles Sports Arena on Wednesday night was erratic at best: occasionally 
inspired, mostly flat. 
</P>
<P>
What could be wrong with a good, uncomplicated wallow in the canon of this rock 
titan? 
</P>
<P>
Well, the lesson is that a totally retrospective show, even one loaded with 
major material and built-in drama, needs the balance and forward movement that 
even some token new material would provide. 
</P>
<P>
Bowie's performance suggested that rather than bringing a special poignancy and 
edge to his classics, their imminent retirement has already left them lifeless. 
</P>
<P>
The knowledge that they're on their last legs deflates them instead of 
enhancing them, and they didn't even generate much of the valedictory 
sentimentality that should have been the cheapest emotion at their command. He 
put the most into two of his landmarks, "Life on Mars?" and "Ziggy Stardust," 
but he looked as ridiculous as he's said he feels in the Stonesy glitter-rock 
of "Rebel, Rebel." He offered selections for fans of most of his incarnations, 
with the emphasis on the post-"Ziggy" years. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Bowie's casual manner was doubly refreshing after his last 
tour's distancing stagecraft. He seemed even looser than he did at last year's 
surprise Roxy show with his stripped-down group Tin Machine. 
</P>
<P>
If he can create the same kind of intimacy when he plays Dodger Stadium on 
Saturday, Bowie will be a real magician. But with this show, there's still no 
way he can avoid being a lame duck. 
</P>
<P>
A full review runs in Friday's Calendar section.

The European Ryder Cup Committee spurned a strong bid by Spain and voted today 
to stage the 1993 Ryder Cup golf match against the United States at The Belfry 
in central England for the third time. 
</P>
<P>
Spain will stage the event the next time it is held in Europe in 1997 "subject 
to certain guarantees and contractual arrangements being forthcoming," the 
committee said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision boiled down to a straight fight between The Belfry, the choice of 
the European Professional Golfers Assn., and the Club de Campo in Madrid, 
favored by the PGA European Tour. 
</P>
<P>
The issue was decided on a vote cast by Lord Derby, chairman of the Ryder Cup 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The Belfry, at Sutton Coldfield in the English Midlands, staged the event for 
the first time in 1985, when Europe wrested the trophy from the United States. 
Europe, which won for the second straight time in 1987 in the United States, 
retained the cup after last year's tie.

Ayrton Senna of Brazil shattered the qualifying lap record on the first day of

</P>
<P>
Senna, in a McLaren-Honda, sped through the Monte Carlo street course in 1 
minute, 21.797 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
That bettered by more than a half-second his own qualifying mark set last year 
of 1:22.308. He averaged 91.01 m.p.h. today. 
</P>
<P>
The second best time was turned in by Senna's teammate, Gerhard Berger of

Rick Mears got back to the head of the pack today as the 33 drivers in the 
Indianapolis 500 made their final on-track adjustments for Sunday's race. 
</P>
<P>
The three-time Indy winner, who lost the spotlight this month to defending 
champion and teammate Emerson Fittipaldi and last year's second-place finisher, 
Al Unser Jr., drove his Penske-Chevrolet to a fast lap of 222.750 m.p.h. in 
racing trim. 
</P>
<P>
Fittipaldi -- who won his first Indy pole with a four-lap qualifying average of 
225.301, breaking Mears' year-old record of 223.886 -- was right behind at 
221.593. The Brazilian driver was followed by Michael Andretti at 220.496. 
</P>
<P>
Arie Luyendyk of the Netherlands, the other front-row starter, was next at 
220.135. 
</P>
<P>
The only other driver over 220 m.p.h. was 1969 winner Mario Andretti, Michael's 
father and fellow second-row starter, at 220.097. Geoff Brabham, who will start 
on the inside of the seventh row, was strong at 219.855, with Unser at 219.593. 
</P>
<P>
All starters, along with first alternate Salt Walther, made it onto the 2 
1/2-mile oval during the two-hour "Carburetion Day" practice -- the only time 
between the end of qualifications and the start of the race that cars are 
allowed on the track. 
</P>
<P>
There were no crashes or spins during the final practice.
