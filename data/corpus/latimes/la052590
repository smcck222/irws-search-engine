ACQUITTED SKIPPER LAMENTS CRASH THAT SCUTTLED CAREER

Cmdr. John Cochrane had always figured himself a lifelong Navy man. As skipper 
of the destroyer Kinkaid, he dreamed of commanding a carrier group or a 
battleship. But, on Thursday, one day after being acquitted of criminal 
negligence, he said he realizes those dreams were shattered in a twist of metal 
last November when his vessel collided with a Panamanian merchant ship. 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect it will never happen," said Cochrane, 44, who would like to command 
a ship again. "It's difficult to convey to someone who hasn't striven to 
command, but being in command is one of the most rewarding and satisfying 
experiences. I would go back if I could. What I want to do is what I had been 
doing before Nov. 12." 
</P>
<P>
Over the past two weeks, during eight days of court-martial proceedings, 
Cochrane heard his crew testify about the crash, which killed the Navy 
navigator and injured 17 sailors. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the testimony made the ship's crew seem ill-prepared. And Cochrane 
himself took the stand to testify about an embarrassing "memory lapse" that 
prompted him to give an erroneous account of the accident to an investigating 
admiral. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, in a 90-minute interview with The Times, Cochrane and his wife, 
Suzanne, said that, despite his acquittal, the accident has not only derailed 
Cochrane's career but also damaged the carefully wrought world they had 
created. 
</P>
<P>
"I likened it to a death -- it was a death to our way of life as we knew it. In 
one brief moment, John knew his career would never be the same," said Suzanne, 
42. 
</P>
<P>
Cochrane realized as soon as he woke to the alarm on a clear, dark November 
morning that disaster had struck his ship by the Strait of Malacca. And, in the 
days that followed, he fell into a deep depression -- trying to understand how 
the accident had occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"I gladly would have traded places with the navigator. . . . I would much 
rather it had been me than him," Cochrane said. 
</P>
<P>
In late March, Cochrane requested permission to retire from the Navy but the 
request was denied as high-ranking Navy officials decided to press criminal 
charges against him in court-martial proceedings. Today, however, Cochrane says 
he wants to stay in the Navy -- probably for two to three more years. And, he 
says, he certainly wants to receive his promotion to captain, which is slated 
for August. 
</P>
<P>
Cochrane's court-martial does not affect that promotion, which will be awarded 
unless it is vetoed by the secretary of the Navy, said Cmdr. Craig Quigley, a 
Navy spokesman in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Cochrane is still uncertain about his plans and has not received his next 
assignment, though he requested a posting in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an old saying that the reward for a general is not a bigger tent but 
command. In the Navy, the job is your reward," said Cochrane, dressed in beige 
slacks and a light blue sports shirt, appearing more relaxed than he had been 
during the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"When you accept command, you recognize you are going to be held accountable. 
They didn't force me to be a commanding officer, I volunteered. I asked. I 
worked 20 years for it." 
</P>
<P>
Even now, Cochrane cannot explain how the accident happened, except to point 
out the failures of two men upon whom he had relied: the navigator and the 
officer of the deck. The two were the cream of his crew, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a mystery," he said. "I'm sure that's the way all tragedies happen. A 
whole bunch of things went wrong at the same time. If the officer of the deck 
called me, I would have been on the bridge in a flash, and it never would have 
happened. People who had not made serious mistakes in the past did so -- I am 
at loss to explain." 
</P>
<P>
The navigator had miscalculated and told him the ship would arrive in one of 
the world's busiest straits about 10 a.m., so Cochrane had scheduled a 
navigation briefing for the morning. But, in fact, the Kinkaid arrived at 5 
a.m. -- while its captain and navigator slept, and half the appropriate number 
of sailors manned the Combat Information Command. 
</P>
<P>
Confused, the officer of the deck tried to figure out the destroyer's location. 
He ordered more than four course changes -- including one of 45 degrees and one 
that put the ship on the wrong side of the shipping lanes. But the officer 
neglected to call Cochrane -- though he had orders to do so with any course 
changes or questions. 
</P>
<P>
On the night of the crash, Cochrane was sleeping in the cabin only yards from 
the bridge, and he woke to the piercing alarm. Pulling on his trousers, he 
reached for a shirt and realized in a flash that he had no time to put it on. 
Instead, he dashed for the bridge. Halfway there, the ship lurched. The 
merchant vessel had punched a 56-by-15-foot hole in the Kinkaid's side. 
</P>
<P>
Cochrane realized he was too late. 
</P>
<P>
He scrambled to the bridge. He issued orders to douse the three fires that had 
broken out and to rescue the five men who had tumbled into the water. And he 
tried to find the injured. 
</P>
<P>
"In that one instant when the ship lurched, I realized that things would never 
be the same again," Cochrane said. 
</P>
<P>
Although he did not have to issue a statement to the investigating crew aboard 
his ship, he felt obligated to explain what had happened, he said. But he could 
remember nothing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In looking at the charts, he figured that the Kinkaid would reach the Strait of 
Malacca about 5 a.m. So he issued a statement saying he knew it would arrive 
early morning. 
</P>
<P>
"You just don't say, 'I don't know' or 'I can't answer.' I felt complete 
responsibility," Cochrane said. "It was inconceivable to me that Sean (McPhee, 
the navigator) hadn't told me. It was so out of character. The error was by 
several hours. I just wanted to cooperate. I didn't feel I was construing what 
had happened. Sean had always told me; there was no reason to believe he didn't 
this time. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had been more my usual self, I wouldn't have made the statement. But that 
would have looked terrible. I thought I was remembering when I looked at the 
chart. I was trying to explain what had happened. I recognized at the time that 
the statement I was making was very damaging but it was inconceivable to me to 
lie. No way." 
</P>
<P>
But, within 10 days, Cochrane realized that his statement was incorrect and 
that, in fact, the navigator had told him the ship would arrive that morning at 
10 a.m., he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't double-check him -- he was a reliable officer," said Cochrane, 
wearily. Cochrane said he was able to jog his memory by talking with his 
executive officer, who said the navigator had suggested an early-morning 
briefing before reaching the strait. 
</P>
<P>
The charts also contained a note that Cochrane said he had directed the 
navigator to write about going into column formation with another ship before 
entering the strait at mid-morning. 
</P>
<P>
Within days, Cochrane said, he realized that his statement was in error and 
that he had made it because he had felt so guilty. 
</P>
<P>
"Because I felt so responsible, I was ready initially to plead guilty to 
anything," Cochrane said. "I was the commanding officer, and therefore, by 
definition, I was guilty. But, talking to senior officers, I realized there was 
a difference between responsibility and criminal liability. I decided I was not 
a criminal, and that I was not going to just roll over and be branded as one." 
</P>
<P>
From that point on, Cochrane began the battle to salvage his career. He offered 
to resign rather than endure a court-martial. But that offer was refused. Then 
he braced himself for the ordeal of spilling out the details before a courtroom 
of how he ran his ship. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing poised but strained, he sat through the hearing, watching as 21 years 
of accomplishments threatened to dissolve. And, when the judge announced that 
Cochrane was not guilty of dereliction of duty and negligently endangering his 
ship, the skipper gave a weak smile. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I was not guilty," said Cochrane, his face flushed. "And I'm not 
bitter. I still love the United States Navy."

SMALL-TOWN TRUCK STOP'S UNIQUE 'LIGHTHOUSE' GENERATES BUSINESS AND CONTROVERSY

FULTONVILLE, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trucks don't outnumber people here, but it's close. 
</P>
<P>
An average of more than 600 trucks a day rumble off the New York State Thruway 
and cruise down Riverside Drive, Fultonville's mile-long midway of truck stops, 
hotels and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
On any evening, this tiny Mohawk Valley village of 777 people welcomes the 
18-wheelers spilling in to fill up on diesel fuel or get fine-tuned as their 
drivers shower, chow down or bunk for the night. 
</P>
<P>
"After three o'clock the trucks just can't find a place to park," said Wayne 
Hazzard, the village's fire chief. 
</P>
<P>
Trucks are everywhere. There's even one in the sky. That rig -- an 18-wheeler 
painted red, white and blue -- sits atop a 30-foot water tower advertising the 
town's claim to fame: 
</P>
<P>
"Welcome to Fultonville -- 3 Truck Stops, 4 Motels, 7 Restaurants." 
</P>
<P>
Trucks are to Fultonville what baseball is to Cooperstown, something that keeps 
the village from both rural anonymity and red ink. 
</P>
<P>
The average truck can hold 300 gallons of diesel fuel, and the average trucker 
can hold a bit more than a sandwich and coffee after eight hours on the road. 
With more than 13 million commercial vehicles -- including commercially 
registered vans and pickups -- riding the thruway yearly, those figures mean 
dollar signs to Fultonville. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing to me is the sales tax money," said Mayor George Wadsworth, 
who estimates that business generated from passing truckers enriches the 
village's tax coffers by about $50,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
"And it keeps going up and up." 
</P>
<P>
The New York State Thruway Authority counted 244,457 commercial vehicles using 
Exit 28 at Fultonville last year, up from 235,237 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
That's heavy traffic for a town so small it doesn't even have its own doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond Riverside Drive, Fultonville reveals itself to be not all that much: a 
general store, post office, a few other businesses and a couple of blocks of 
aging houses. 
</P>
<P>
But Fultonville has shrewdly taken advantage of its location and small size to 
attract trucks navigating the trade route between New England and the upper 
Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of like it here," said Bob Thompson, a trucker passing through from New 
Haven, Mich. "It's a friendly little place, and it's halfway to anywhere you 
want to go." 
</P>
<P>
Fultonville has capitalized on through-traffic before. The town once sustained 
itself on the comings and goings of mule-drawn ships along the Erie Canal, 
which cut through the town in the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
That section of the Erie Canal was filled in by the beginning of this century, 
but, ironically enough, it was the long-gone canal that gave impetus to 
Fultonville's current heyday. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1950s, state planners drew the route for the proposed New York 
State Thruway right over the old path of the Erie Canal -- and right through 
the heart of Fultonville. 
</P>
<P>
Many here thought it would be the town's death knell. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was skeptical," former mayor George Snyder recalled. "But I knew 
there was nothing we could do to stop them. . . . We decided to make the best 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
Guessing the superhighway's economic potential, Snyder wheedled and cajoled 
politicians in Albany -- including Gov. Thomas E. Dewey himself -- until 
Fultonville got its own thruway exit. 
</P>
<P>
Under Snyder, the town also became one of the few in Upstate New York to allow 
tandem trailers, "double barrels" as truckers call them, to exit to their 
roads. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder started Fultonville Truck Center in 1954 with four diesel pumps and 12 
rooms with a little diner downstairs. When he sold the business in 1973, it had 
37 pumps. 
</P>
<P>
That same stop today is the Roadway Motor Plaza, the largest of the town's 
three stops, offering 14 motel rooms and dispensing an average of 5 million 
gallons of gasoline a year. Next biggest is Glen Travel Plaza, followed by 
Countryside Fuel Stop. 
</P>
<P>
Having multiple truck stops in small towns is not unusual, says Don Lofstrom, a 
vice president of the Rochester, N.Y.-based Roadway Motor Plaza Co., which owns 
the largest stop. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not uncommon for truck stops to be placed in the middle of noplace on 
interstates," Lofstrom said. It can be more convenient for trucks to stop in 
small towns like Fultonville or Buda, Tex., than big cities like Chicago or 
Houston, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's not unusual, then it's certainly laudable," said Roger King, a 
spokesman for the National Assn. of Truck Stop Operators, a Virginia-based 
trade group. "It's an example of what truck stops can be to a community." 
</P>
<P>
People here talk about the thruway like farmers talk about the weather. 
</P>
<P>
"There's enough for all of us as long as we can get them off the thruway," said 
Vincent Gramuglia, Countryside's owner. 
</P>
<P>
Gramuglia is the man who parked a retired semi 45 feet above the thruway's 
roadside flora as a way of attracting business. 
</P>
<P>
"Like a lighthouse is to boats, this is to trucks," Gramuglia said. 
</P>
<P>
The Thruway Authority thinks differently. 
</P>
<P>
"The authority considers the device to be . . . the most hazardous, gaudiest, 
most novel and most distracting advertising device on the thruway system and a 
flagrant violation of its regulations," a complaint issued by the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
The authority says the truck must go because it does not honor a 660-foot right 
of way for advertising next to the road. 
</P>
<P>
While the issue wends its way through state court, the cause of "The Truck" has 
spread beyond the confines of Fultonville. 
</P>
<P>
Gramuglia has started peddling "Save the Truck" T-shirts to spread word of his 
troubles. He's also generated a lot of support. 
</P>
<P>
Both Fultonville and Montgomery County officials have come out with resolutions 
supporting Gramuglia. A bill has just been introduced before the state 
Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
"They're overreacting," said state Sen. Hugh Farley, a supporter of Gramuglia. 
"I think they need a sense of humor about this."

SUSPECT ARRAIGNED IN SLAYING; 
</P>
<P>
SIMI VALLEY: THE TRANSIENT PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO KILLING A BLUE CROSS EMPLOYEE 
IN HIS CONDOMINIUM.

<P>
A 22-year-old transient pleaded not guilty Thursday to murder and robbery 
charges in the shooting death of a Blue Cross insurance employee in Simi Valley 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Rudolfo Barrascout was arraigned in Ventura County Municipal Court on 
charges that he killed 37-year-old Gregory D. Minor last Friday at Minor's 
condominium. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Thomas J. Hutchins ordered Barrascout to be held in the county jail on 
$1-million bond pending a preliminary hearing scheduled for June 7. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald C. Glynn said authorities still haven't determined a 
motive in Minor's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
"We wish we knew," Glynn said. "It looks like a robbery gone sour," because 
police recovered some of Minor's belongings from Barrascout, Glynn said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides murder and robbery, Barrascout is charged with burglary and using a 
weapon. Glynn said the burglary and robbery charges are considered special 
circumstances that would allow Barrascout to face the death penalty or life in 
prison without parole if he is convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley Detective Sgt. Tony Harper said Barrascout saw a for-sale sign in 
the window of Minor's white Corvette and visited Minor's home Friday afternoon 
to talk to him about the car. 
</P>
<P>
Minor's companion, Donna Richardson, returned home at 7:45 p.m. and searched 
the home with a neighbor, finding Minor's body under the bed in the master 
bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
The county coroner's office later ruled that Minor had been shot twice in the 
head with a .22-caliber gun between 4:30 and 7:45 p.m. on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Barrascout was arrested early Saturday morning at his van a mile from Minor's 
condominium. Barrascout, a Hollywood native, had been sleeping in the van for 
several nights before the shooting, Harper said.

BUDGET FREEZE SPARES ARTS, OTHERS -- FOR NOW; 
</P>
<P>
CITY GOVERNMENT: NOT ALL PROGRAMS ARE PROTECTED, AND EVEN THOSE INCLUDED IN THE 
FREEZE COULD FACE CUTS AFTER THE COUNCIL DETERMINES THE IMPLICATIONS OF ITS 
ACTION.

Municipal spending on arts, parks and recreation, community services, 
libraries, lifeguards and social service programs and safety services would be 
frozen at current levels under a partial budget freeze decided upon Thursday by 
the San Diego City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The council action directly undercuts a city manager's proposal that would have 
eliminated arts funding and cut in half funding for parks, pools and libraries. 
</P>
<P>
The council also agreed to spend any excess revenue accrued during the fiscal 
year beginning July 1 on more police and firefighters, a new jail and a new 
police substation. 
</P>
<P>
However, council members at the Thursday budget workshop left many other 
programs unprotected. And, some council members reserved the right to later 
propose cuts in those supposedly safe programs. 
</P>
<P>
The council also stopped short of saying where it would find new revenue to 
breach a budget shortfall that has been described as at least $13 million. That 
shortfall could be "much higher," given the level of municipal service the 
council eventually funds, City Manager John Lockwood said after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's action means that service levels in those protected departments 
would fall in the coming year because demand, which is fueled by San Diego's 
growing population, will outstrip current spending levels, Lockwood said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the frozen spending levels in those departments do not include money for 
millions of dollars in raises promised to employees, or for new expenses that 
were authorized during the current year but will not be funded until next year. 
</P>
<P>
The council's unscheduled priority-setting session drew loud applause from 
hundreds of artists, dancers, singers, musicians and other artists who jammed 
the council chambers to protest budget cuts that would have decimated city 
spending on the arts. Performers and others had gathered earlier at City Hall 
to protest a budget proposed by Lockwood that would have eliminated all $6 
million in arts funding. 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood drew the arts community's ire by proposing that the council balance 
its budget by using hotel and motel tax revenue -- the transient occupancy tax 
-- that typically has been used to fund the arts and cultural promotion. The 
council Thursday voted to freeze TOT spending at current levels and use it for 
arts funding. 
</P>
<P>
Council members directed Lockwood to determine the long-term impact that 
Thursday's actions would have as the budget process goes forward. 
</P>
<P>
"We have taken some straightforward and necessary actions today," Councilman 
Bruce Henderson said. "Now we need to know what the implications are." Lockwood 
will return to the council next week to explain what will happen to the rest of 
the budget if the select programs are frozen at existing levels. 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood said departments protected at current funding levels would account for 
about $260 million of the $444 million in anticipated revenue during the coming 
fiscal year. But many parts of the budget that were not specifically protected 
by the council Thursday can't be tinkered with because of mandated programs, 
Lockwood said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who on Wednesday called for an across-the-board budget 
freeze, described Thursday's council action as "three-quarters of a loaf. . . . 
We've got a good start now on the budget process. We have a direction now." 
</P>
<P>
But Councilwoman Judy McCarty questioned the wisdom of agreeing to freeze parts 
of the budget without first addressing the effect on the rest of the budget. 
"I'll vote for this with much trepidation," McCarty said. "I think this is 
quite worrisome." 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Bob Filner and Ron Roberts failed to get additional funds needed to 
keep the police force's current ratio of 1.68 uniformed officers per 1,000 
residents. That proposal drew support from Councilman Wes Pratt and McCarty. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said the city has an obligation to keep the ratio at 1.68, given the 
city's longstanding claim that drugs and crime have created a "crisis."

STATE ELECTIONS 78TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT; 
</P>
<P>
'DOUBLE ELECTION' IS DOUBLE TROUBLE FOR GOTCH, MARSTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
In a campaign perhaps more notable for its unorthodox, confusing format than 
for its content, a former San Diego city councilman and a one-time City Hall 
aide will compete in two races on the same day next month for a vacant state 
Assembly seat. 
</P>
<P>
Any one of the unusual characteristics of the race for the 78th Assembly 
District seat vacated by Democrat Lucy Killea's election to the state Senate 
last December would be sufficient to drive voters -- as well as election 
officials and the candidates themselves -- to distraction. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for all parties involved, the June 5 "double election" -- a 
political rarity as intriguing as it is perplexing -- is only the start of the 
confusion in the contest between former Democratic Councilman Mike Gotch and 
Republican Jeff Marston. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the potential bewilderment is the fact that Gotch and Marston will 
share one of next month's ballots with a handful of other candidates not 
running, increasing concerns that confused voters may erroneously conclude that 
they must vote for different candidates in the two contests. The likelihood 
that Gotch and Marston will face each other again this fall -- their third 
confrontation within seven months -- provides a fitting backdrop to a campaign 
that even county Registrar of Voters Conny McCormack describes as "a recipe how 
not to run an election." 
</P>
<P>
"Our slogan's going to be: 'Vote early, vote often, vote Jeff,' " joked Marston 
consultant Sara Katz, whose candidate was an upset first-place finisher in the 
six-candidate special April primary that was the initial step toward filling 
Killea's former seat.

Billing June's election as "Round 2" in a three-round contest, Marston and 
Gotch face the peculiar political challenge of having to simultaneously win two 
races: the special runoff for the six months remaining in Killea's unexpired 
term and their respective parties' primary nominations for the two-year term at 
stake in November. Victory in the former, both candidates acknowledge, will 
generate powerful, perhaps unstoppable, momentum for a repeat win this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond its puzzling makeup, there are other compelling aspects to the campaign 
-- notably, the rarity of an open state legislative race, combined with a 
partisan balance that makes the 78th District among the most competitive in the 
state. With Democrats holding only a slim 45%-41% voter registration edge, the 
district was, throughout Killea's four terms, the most heavily Republican 
legislative district represented by a Democrat in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those factors, the campaign has been waged in relative obscurity, since 
Marston and Gotch finished first and second, respectively, in the primary to 
qualify for the runoff. By virtue of running unopposed in her Peace and Freedom 
Party primary, teacher Jane Rocio Evans also will be on June's special runoff 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
After having the political stage largely to themselves before April's special 
primary, Gotch and Marston have watched their race assume a progressively lower 
profile as several other campaigns -- including some in which longtime 
congressional and state legislative incumbents face strong primary challenges 
-- diverted press and public attention. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten a little lost in the shuffle, and that's been frustrating," Gotch 
said. "That's made it more difficult to articulate the issues and focus on the 
differences." 
</P>
<P>
The candidates' philosophical similarity on most major issues also has 
complicated their attempt to distinguish themselves to voters in the 78th 
District, which stretches along the coast from Ocean Beach to Pacific Beach, 
extending inland to the Miramar Naval Air Station in the north, south to 
downtown San Diego and east to East San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Both Gotch and Marston favor abortion rights, capital punishment and a ban on 
assault weapons, and oppose offshore oil drilling and aerial malathion 
spraying. Each also backs one of the major ballot measures that will be before 
statewide voters next month -- Proposition 111, which would double the current 
9-cents-per-gallon gasoline tax over five years to finance an $18.5-billion 
highway and transportation improvement program. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, their standard stump speeches differ more in style than substance, 
revolving around generalities about protecting the environment, improving 
education and health care, reducing crime and drug problems and gaining more 
state money for San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Among their few policy differences, Gotch favors a 15-day waiting period for 
the purchase of rifles, supports increasing the minimum wage and opposes 
Proposition 119's plan to turn over legislative reapportionment to an 
independent commission, with Marston taking the opposite position on each 
issue. Marston also has called for restoring the De Anza mobile home park and 
camp land to natural habitat when their respective leases expire early in the 
next century, while Gotch has committed himself to doing so only in regard to 
the mobile home park. Until a substitute coastline camp land is available, "I 
don't want to give up the only one we have," Gotch explains. 
</P>
<P>
Even the candidates, however, admit that their disagreements more often deal 
with nuance than with black-and-white distinctions. To discern the major 
difference in the race, the 42-year-old Gotch argues, voters must look to the 
candidates' backgrounds -- a comparison that enables him to contrast his own 
elective office experience to Marston's work on the staffs of two Republican 
officeholders. "If you want to see the clearest distinction, it's that my 
opponent has functioned as an office manager, a mid-level staff person, while I 
have experience as an elected member of the City Council," said Gotch, who 
served on the council from 1979 to 1987. "I made the decisions, built the 
coalitions, and provided eight years of tough, independent leadership. Jeff 
likes to say, 'I know how to push buttons, too.' But the job's a lot more 
complex that." 
</P>
<P>
In response, Marston, a one-time aide to former San Diego City Councilwoman 
Gloria McColl and Sen. S. I. Hayakawa (R-Calif.), contends that his own staff 
work involved "doing everything but pushing the button" on a wide range of 
local and statewide issues. 
</P>
<P>
"As a staff person, I did the nuts-and-bolts work from top to bottom on these 
issues," the 34-year-old Marston said. "Like most elected officials, when a 
problem came to Mike, he'd turn it over to his staff person to handle. If he 
wants to compare backgrounds, you could say that I was out attending all the 
community and neighborhood meetings that Mike didn't." 
</P>
<P>
If Gotch's record allows him to rightly cast himself as the race's only "tried 
and tested" candidate, it also makes an inviting target for Marston. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Marston consistently reminds campaign audiences that Gotch 
supported the controversial Belmont Park development and went to work for 
developer Doug Manchester after leaving the council in 1987 -- factors that he 
uses in an attempt to undermine Gotch's otherwise solid environmental record. 
Though Gotch defends his Belmont Park vote as one that cleaned up a 
"dilapidated, crime-ridden area" in Mission Beach, his most effective rebuttal 
to criticism of his environmental credentials is his endorsement by the Sierra 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
The primary's outcome -- Marston outpolled the former councilman, 36%-30% -- 
represented an embarrassing setback for Gotch, whose high name recognition in a 
field of relative unknowns had made him such a prohibitive favorite that many 
of his top aides had predicted an outright 50%-plus victory in April. 
</P>
<P>
"If the primary showed anything, it was that a lot of voters didn't think much 
of the 'tried-and-tested' candidate," said Marston aide Katz. 
</P>
<P>
Forced to put the best possible face on his second-place finish, Gotch has 
stressed that the Democratic primary vote was divided among four candidates, 
while Marston was the only active Republican. Overall, Democratic candidates 
drew nearly 55% of the primary vote -- more than 1 1/2 times Marston's total, 
Gotch aides stress. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the efforts of Gotch's "spin" experts, Marston's first-place primary 
finish significantly shifted momentum in his direction and caused activists in 
both parties to reevaluate the race's political equation -- in the process, 
obliterating the conventional wisdom that held that a Gotch victory was a 
virtual fait accompli. 
</P>
<P>
In their effort to reverse the candidates' finishing order, Gotch's strategists 
are heartened by the fact that dramatically different dynamics will be at work 
in June than were evident in the special primary. With the Assembly race being 
the only issue on the 78th District ballot in April, voter turnout was only 
about 22% -- much lower than is expected next month. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the contested Democratic gubernatorial primary between former San 
Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein and Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp could enhance 
Gotch's candidacy by boosting Democratic turnout. In contrast, former San Diego 
mayor, now-Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) is the presumptive GOP nominee, 
lessening Republicans' incentive to go to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
"That probably is a small plus for Mike that we'll have to deal with," Marston 
said. "But they're presuming that all of those votes that went to other 
Democrats in the primary will just fall into Mike's lap. Since a lot of them 
were anti-Gotch votes in the first place, I think that's a risky assumption." 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, however, much of the attention in the 78th District campaign 
reverts to its unusual framework. Though the "double election" alone is 
sufficiently baffling, the race is further muddied by the inclusion of the five 
losers from April's special primary on next month's normal primary ballots -- 
because, election officials said, it was too late for their names to be 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
From the outset, both Gotch and Marston have worried that the juxtaposition of 
a special runoff and a routine primary on the same ballot could, 
understandably, confuse voters, prompting some to inaccurately conclude that 
they cannot vote for the same candidate twice. 
</P>
<P>
Although election officials inserted a short explanatory note -- "You are 
entitled to vote for a candidate in both races" -- on the ballot, both major 
candidates doubt that that message will eliminate the confusion. Indeed, both 
Marston and Gotch share the same nightmare: that supporters who vote for them 
in the regular primary, which appears first on the ballot, will either neglect 
to do so -- or, worse, vote for their opponent -- in the special runoff. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were going to lose some votes to confusion, you'd rather have that 
happen in the primary, where logically it wouldn't hurt," Marston said. "The 
runoff's where every vote counts. Unfortunately, because of the (ballot) order, 
that's exactly where the confusion might hurt you. I'm superstitious anyway, so 
that's just one more thing to worry about."

OFFICIALS CALL OFFSHORE DRILLING BILL A VICTORY; 
</P>
<P>
EMISSIONS: THE HOUSES PASSES THE CLEAN AIR ACT AMENDMENT. IT WOULD PLACE OIL 
RIGS UNDER STRICT AIR POLLUTION REGULATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Ventura County officials claimed a major victory Thursday in a lengthy campaign 
to bring offshore oil drilling under strict air pollution regulations. 
</P>
<P>
They said the victory came in a last-minute amendment to the Clean Air Act 
passed Wednesday by the House of Representatives. Local officials helped draft 
the measure, which now goes to a House-Senate conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment would give the Environmental Protection Agency control over air 
pollution generated by offshore oil drilling platforms. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Interior's Minerals Management Agency now controls all 
permits for offshore oil platforms. 
</P>
<P>
The House bill specifies that EPA must draft new offshore regulations at least 
as strict as emission controls onshore. 
</P>
<P>
The result will be cleaner air for Ventura County and other California coastal 
communities, said Richard Baldwin, Ventura County air pollution control 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
"I know there are emission sources out there that can be controlled far better 
than they are now," Baldwin said. "Any emissions that come into our county are 
significant because of our severe air quality problem." 
</P>
<P>
If the House bill becomes law, it is probable that the EPA would transfer 
enforcement of the offshore provision to local air pollution control districts, 
Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
"That would give us the ability to control all emission sources under one 
organization," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The oil industry, however, wants all management of the platforms to remain with 
the Minerals Management Agency, said Terry Covington, executive director of 
California Coastal Operators Group, an association that represents nine major 
oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, she said, the platforms contribute very little to onshore air 
pollution problems because they already reduce their emissions as much as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
"We are worried that in the future we won't be able to meet these air rules," 
she said. "We're concerned that we're going to get squeezed out of business." 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin and William Master, assistant director of Santa Barbara's Air Pollution 
Control District, worked with Senate staff members trying to add a similar 
amendment to the Senate version of the Clean Air Act last spring. Sen. Pete 
Wilson (R-Calif.) offered the amendment, but it was defeated. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Baldwin and Master will turn their lobbying efforts back toward the Senate 
to persuade Wilson and Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) to push for the House 
offshore amendment, Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
The House approved its version of the Clean Air Act Wednesday on a 401-to-21 
vote. The Senate approved its version of the bill on April 3 by a vote of 89 to 
11. 
</P>
<P>
Although the House version is tougher on polluters, both bills would severely 
curtail emissions nationwide in an effort to rid cities of smog. 
</P>
<P>
The House offshore amendment, offered by Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura) 
and Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), originally affected all coastal states. 
But opposition from the Gulf states prompted the amendment's sponsors to 
exclude Texas, Louisiana and Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
Because the offshore amendment now affects only California, support from both 
California senators should smooth the way for the amendment in the Senate, said 
John Doherty, legislative aide to Lagomarsino. 
</P>
<P>
"It's called 'senatorial courtesy,' " Doherty said. 
</P>
<P>
Offshore platforms use gas turbines and internal combustion engines to generate 
power for drilling equipment and electricity. Both types of engines emit 
polluting gasses that contribute to the formation of ozone. 
</P>
<P>
A single offshore platform can emit more than 600 tons of smog-producing 
pollutants, Master said. The pollutants are blown over Ventura and Santa 
Barbara counties by westerly winds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
There are 19 platforms in federal waters off the coast of Ventura and Santa 
Barbara counties.

<TEXT>
<P>
Three men have been indicted by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles in 
connection with a total of seven bank robberies in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Frederick Moorman, 42, Victor Murillo Martinez, 32, and Antonio Perez, 
25, are being held in connection with robberies in Oxnard, Ventura and Port 
Hueneme, said Lawrence G. Lawler, FBI agent in charge of the Los Angeles 
bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Moorman of Oxnard is charged with robbing three banks within 15 days in 
November: Security Pacific Bank at 455 South A St., Oxnard; the Bank of A. Levy 
at 2499 Harbor Blvd., Ventura; and the Bank of A. Levy at 143 West 5th St., 
Oxnard, Lawler said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Moorman was identified by people who recognized him from bank camera 
surveillance photographs published in local newspapers. Moorman was located on 
Dec. 26, in the San Diego County Jail, where he was being held on unrelated 
burglary charges. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, formerly of Oxnard, was charged with three Oxnard robberies over six 
months, Lawler said. 
</P>
<P>
The first occurred Oct. 31 at American Savings Bank, 560 South A St. and was 
followed on Feb. 9 by a holdup at First Nationwide Bank, 1055 S. Oxnard Blvd. 
The third robbery occurred April 20 at the Security Pacific on South A Street. 
</P>
<P>
After an arrest warrant was issued, Martinez surrendered to FBI agents in 
Oxnard on May 9, Lawler said. Martinez faces a hearing June 4. 
</P>
<P>
Perez of Oxnard is charged with robbing the Imperial Savings Assn. at 2671 N. 
Ventura Road, Port Hueneme, on April 27, Lawler said. Perez was arrested May 7 
by Port Hueneme police and the FBI, Lawler said. His hearing is scheduled 
Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. CAROL WATSON

<P>
The best way to honor America's war dead on Memorial Day is to pay tribute to 
the living, according to a Vietnam veterans spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Awards will be presented to a firefighter, advocate for the homeless, teacher 
and others at an "In Service to America Ball" sponsored by the Vietnam Veterans 
of San Diego, said executive director Robert Van Keuren. 
</P>
<P>
The ball, at 6 p.m. Monday at the San Diego Hilton Hotel on Mission Bay, will 
honor those who have sacrificed their lives by paying tribute to those who have 
made contributions to the citizens of San Diego, said Van Keuren. 
</P>
<P>
"By honoring those who serve San Diego and our nation today, we honor the 
memory of those who have given their lives to protect our right to participate 
in our communities as free citizens," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Pete Wilson, state Sen. Wadie Deddeh, Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier, 
County Supervisor Leon Williams and City Councilman Bob Filner also will be 
recognized. 
</P>
<P>
The group's eighth annual reading of names of the more than 500 San Diegans who 
died in Vietnam or who are listed as missing in action will begin at 4 p.m. 
today and continue through Sunday at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, at San 
Diego Avenue and Twiggs Street in Old Town. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego high school students will be paired with Vietnam veterans for the 
reading to give students "a fuller understanding of the Vietnam War, our 
nation's involvement in it and the true meaning of Memorial Day," Van Keuren 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The reading concludes Sunday with a memorial service at 5 p.m. Vietnam veteran 
Robert White, a retired Marine colonel of the county's Veteran Service Office, 
will speak. 
</P>
<P>
A variety of activities will mark Memorial Day weekend. More than 50,000 
miniature American flags will be placed on graves at Ft. Rosecrans National 
Cemetery for Monday's 10 a.m. service. Tributes will be held at 11 a.m. at Glen 
Abbey Memorial Park in Bonita and at 1:30 p.m. at El Camino Memorial Park in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The San Marcos Veterans of Foreign Wars will conduct a 10 a.m. ceremony Monday 
at San Marcos Cemetery. The program includes an honor guard of Purple Heart 
veterans, buglers from San Marcos High School and a free buffet. Bishop Robert 
H. Brom of the San Diego Roman Catholic Diocese will celebrate an 11 a.m. Mass 
on Monday in the chapel at Holy Cross Cemetery, 4470 Hilltop Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Schools, banks, Post Offices, libraries and government offices will be closed 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Metered parking in the city of San Diego will not be enforced Monday, and trash 
collections will be one day later than normal during the week. The Miramar 
Landfill will be open from 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego lakes, including El Capitan, Hodges, Miramar, Lake Murray, Otay and 
Sutherland will be open from sunrise to sunset. San Vincente will be open, for 
water skiing only, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Chollas Lake, which offers fishing for 
children 15 and younger, will be open 6:30 a.m. to 7:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Sun Runner beach shuttle begins its summer run Saturday. The shuttle costs 
25 cents and runs every 20 minutes, Wednesday through Sunday, taking riders to 
Mission and Pacific beaches. Beachgoers can park and board the trolley with all 
their gear at Mission Bay High School, 2475 Grand Avenue, or at any one of the 
49 other stops. Call San Diego Transit, 233-3004, for details. 
</P>
<P>
For the motivated, the third annual Senior Olympic Games will be Sunday and 
Monday at the Jewish Community Center, 4079 54th Street. Nearly 1,000 athletes, 
ranging in age from 55 to 95, will go for the gold in 17 events begining at 9 
a.m. Sunday. Competition continues Monday at 10 a.m. in such events as tennis, 
swimming, golf and track and field. 
</P>
<P>
For those looking for a more esoteric weekend, the San Diego Whole Life Expo 
runs today through Monday at the San Diego Convention Center, 111 W. Harbor 
Drive. The expo includes more than 125 specialists and 300 exhibits on New Age 
topics such as metaphysics, crystals, channeling, psychics and nutrition.

GROVES CLEARED TO MAKE WAY FOR STORES

<P>
Bulldozers have cleared citrus groves on the west side of Santa Paula to make 
way for a development that is expected to bring $10 million in retail sales 
into the city. 
</P>
<P>
The groves were cleared from 12 acres in the western portion of town bordering 
California 126, where a new K mart deparment store will be built, said Joan 
Kus, the city's planning director. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the K mart, the project includes two smaller retail stores. 
Contractor Design Build Associates of Westlake Village has not yet received 
permits to build, but has received a permit to begin grading. 
</P>
<P>
The store is part of a large commercial development to be built on the city's 
west side, an area occupied by farms and a few houses. 
</P>
<P>
A recent campaign to slow development on the west side has succeeded in 
generating support for preserving the orchards around the rural community, but 
the K mart project was approved three years ago, Kus said. 
</P>
<P>
Kus said the project was approved in hopes that the department store would 
generate retail sales. "We would like to have people spend money here rather 
than in other places," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A report last year by a consultant said Santa Paula's lack of large shopping 
malls is forcing shoppers to go elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
More than $76 million in retail sales is lost to stores in neighboring 
communities, it said. It also suggested that the city support new commercial 
development to keep shoppers in town. PSYCHE PASCUAL

A black former inmate of a Saugus jail filed a civil rights lawsuit Thursday 
against the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department contending that he was 
beaten by deputies who are members of a white supremacist group known as the 
Wayside Whities. 
</P>
<P>
Clydell Crawford said he was beaten and his leg was broken on Dec. 2 while he 
was an inmate at the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho. He said that six to eight 
deputies beat him after removing him from a medium security dormitory, and that 
the deputies were members of a large group of jailers who take their name from 
the jail's former name, Wayside Honor Rancho. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that deputies in the group are involved in racially motivated 
intimidation and attacks on black inmates. The deputies exchange hand signals 
in which their fingers form the letter W, according to the lawsuit filed in 
U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The civil rights lawsuit against Sheriff Sherman Block and 12 deputies assigned 
to the jail seeks more than $1 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Thursday, Crawford and his attorney, George V. Denny, 
released witness statements from three other inmates who said they saw the 
beating, which followed a fight between Crawford and a white inmate. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Sheriff's Department said the incident was under 
investigation but declined to comment on specific allegations made by Crawford 
and other inmates. 
</P>
<P>
"A complete and thorough investigation is being conducted into the incident," 
Deputy Hal Grant said. "This investigation started the day of the incident. 
Employees of the Sheriff's Department found to have violated policy or criminal 
law will be dealt with accordingly." 
</P>
<P>
Crawford, 26, of West Covina said he served six weeks at the Pitchess Honor 
Rancho for violating his probation for an earlier cocaine sales conviction. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 2, he said, he got into a fight with a white inmate and knocked him 
down. Later, several deputies came into the dormitory and questioned the white 
inmate. Crawford said he was taken behind the dormitory by the deputies and 
beaten with flashlights and knocked to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was down they just kept beating on me," he said. "Then one of them 
stomped on my leg and that's when it broke. I could tell he did it on purpose." 
</P>
<P>
Tyrone Robinson, a 19-year-old former inmate at the jail, appeared with 
Crawford at Thursday's press conference and said he saw the beating by looking 
through the rear windows of the dormitory. He said such beatings of black 
inmates were routine by the deputies who called themselves the Wayside Whities. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw seven or eight deputies beating up on him," Robinson said. "It was like 
they had to beat up on somebody every day." 
</P>
<P>
The suit names Block and deputies Frank La Flame, Ernesto De Armas and John 
Bones. Nine other deputies identified by their last names only are Gill, 
Johnson, Thrail, Berk, Wolf, Perez, Winston, Bemsick and Libel. 
</P>
<P>
The suit says the defendants other than Block are "members of the 'Wayside 
Whities,' a Ku Klux Klan-type organization espousing white supremacy and having 
as one of its objectives the subjugation, intimidation and terrorization" of 
black inmates. 
</P>
<P>
The suit states that "although the Wayside Whities is a semi-secret 
organization, its members . . . openly and notoriously exchange hand signals 
with fingers affixed roughly in a 'W' sign, and that their superior officers 
know . . . of their unlawful and unconstitutional activities in beating, 
harassing and otherwise intimidating black prisoners." 
</P>
<P>
Denny, Crawford's attorney, said that his office has interviewed other victims 
of the alleged Wayside Whities, and that the group's activities might be 
related to other white supremacist deputy groups at other county jail 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The department fired two deputies after an investigation into complaints that 
deputies had engaged in a cross-burning in December, 1987, or January, 1988, in 
a Men's Central Jail module where members of a black street gang were housed. 
</P>
<P>
Denny also said that earlier this year the county approved a $175,000 
settlement with six black inmates who claimed in a lawsuit that they had been 
subjected to racial taunts and beaten by sheriff's deputies in the Hall of 
Justice jail. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford and Denny said that black deputies assigned to the jail are aware of 
the Wayside Whities and that at least one black jailer witnessed Crawford's 
beating. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Can you help me?' " Crawford said. "He just kept watching." 
</P>
<P>
Denny said the black deputies might be afraid to report incidents of racially 
motivated attacks or intimidation.

PLAN TO WATER MADRONA MARSH ON HOLD; 
</P>
<P>
TORRANCE: OPPOSITION BY COUNCILMAN HAS HALTED USE OF CITY DRINKING WATER TO 
REPLENISH AN ECOSYSTEM RAVAGED BY DROUGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The wetlands of Madrona Marsh haven't been very wet for about four years now. 
</P>
<P>
Green thickets of tule grass have withered into tangled, gray stands of dead 
stems. Aquatic marsh plants have given way to carpets of common weeds. Nesting 
waterfowl, once a common sight, have flown elsewhere to raise their young. 
</P>
<P>
The four-year California drought has meant a creeping disappearance for Madrona 
Marsh. Each year, fewer acres of the vernal marsh experience the 
life-sustaining winter floods that carry the delicate ecosystem through the 
drier months. 
</P>
<P>
On Earth Day, retired contractor Don Roser set foot in Madrona for the first 
time and saw its shriveled condition. 
</P>
<P>
He decided that his personal environmental project would be to get Madrona a 
nice, long drink of water. 
</P>
<P>
After Roser did some vigorous lobbying at City Hall, the marsh got its first 
good sip on Wednesday night. But Roser faces a battle before the City Council 
next week to get the marsh the rest of the water it needs. 
</P>
<P>
Plans by Torrance park administrators to release between two and four acre-feet 
of domestic drinking water into the marsh -- an amount roughly equal to between 
650,000 and 1.3 million gallons -- have been blocked by City Councilman Dan 
Walker, who says he believes pouring city drinking water into a marsh during a 
drought sets a bad conservation example. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Barnett, Torrance parks and recreation director, said Madrona's water 
needs represent less than a fraction of 1% of his department's overall water 
use. Although city departments earlier this year agreed to cut their water 
consumption by 10%, Barnett made plans to supply water to Madrona by simply 
cutting back a little more than 10% at each of the city's parks. 
</P>
<P>
Several of Walker's council colleagues argue that watering the marsh is a 
perfectly rational thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason for the city gaining title to that land was so that we could 
preserve the marsh as a natural habitat," Mayor Katy Geissert said. "Because of 
the drought situation and because of the development all around there, there 
has been virtually no natural runoff. . . . This is important to retain the 
viability of the marsh." 
</P>
<P>
The city gained title to Madrona Marsh in 1986 after a protracted battle over 
proposed construction there. Eventually, the developer of Park Del Amo won the 
right to build 1,482 residential units and 850,000 square feet of office space 
in exchange for donating 34.5 acres of marshland and selling an additional 8.5 
acres to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Tim Mock said he sees the latest issue as balancing the use of one 
valuable resource -- water -- to save another. 
</P>
<P>
"The council already has determined that the marsh is a valuable resource," he 
said. "We spent a lot of time and effort to preserve the marshland, and this is 
just following through with that effort." 
</P>
<P>
But Walker said he believes that Madrona would be fine without a drop. 
</P>
<P>
"The marsh can survive on its own. It has gone through periods of drought and 
periods of flood, and it will again," he said. "It just isn't right to use our 
drinking water to fill a marsh." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday afternoon, as city workers prepared to test the water valves that 
could quench Madrona's thirst, Walker called Barnett and told him what he 
thought of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Barnett briefly put the marsh watering plans on hold while he 
conferred with City Manager LeRoy Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
At 7 p.m. Wednesday, Jackson gave the go-ahead and city workers opened valves 
around the marsh, allowing roughly 200,000 gallons of water to flow in. At the 
request of the Metropolitan Water District, the water was pumped at night to 
prevent rapid evaporation. 
</P>
<P>
City plans called for starting the pumps once or twice more over several days 
to give the marsh at least 500,000 gallons more. 
</P>
<P>
But on Thursday morning, Walker demanded that the issue be placed on the 
council's May 29 agenda. Jackson said no more water will be pumped until the 
council discusses the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Roser, 62, said he never dreamed that he would have to wade through such a 
political morass. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to give the marsh a little help," Roser said. "I told (the city) 
from the start that I'd be willing to pay for it, if that was the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Recently retired from his general contracting business, Roser said his water 
odyssey began when he took an Earth Day tour of Madrona Marsh last month. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to the realization that it was drying up and it needed some help," 
Roser said. 
</P>
<P>
After confirming his suspicions with City Naturalist Walton Wright, who acts as 
the marsh's caretaker, Roser started lobbying city officials and won financial 
support from a nonprofit group called Friends of Madrona Marsh. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they already were working on a water management plan for 
the marsh, which included installation of a pump to carry water into the marsh 
from a drainage sump on the corner of Sepulveda Boulevard and Maple Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
But before the lines to the marsh were installed, this season's only major 
storm dumped nearly 700,000 gallons of water into the sump, where existing 
pumps sent it out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
Officials had just begun talking about replacing the lost sump water with 
domestic supplies when Roser stepped in. 
</P>
<P>
"We were caught between two stewardships," City Manager Jackson said. "We had 
to ask, did we disturb the natural balance of water in the marsh? Yes, we did. 
. . . Can we repair that without doing harm to our overall conservation 
program? The answer is yes. 
</P>
<P>
"With those things in mind, I think we were correct in moving forward." 
</P>
<P>
Walking through the marsh Wednesday afternoon, Wright said the water is central 
to Madrona's long-term health. 
</P>
<P>
Once part of a 665-acre drainage basin, the 43-acre preserve that remains needs 
water funneled to it -- either from sumps or some other source -- to thrive, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although far from dead now, Madrona's wetlands have shrunk to such an extent 
that the birds that used to call it home during the winter have had a difficult 
time surviving there, Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
Foxes living in Madrona's dry areas have eaten duck and coot eggs that normally 
would have been hidden deep inside a broad wetland. Those ducklings that did 
manage to hatch did not have enough water around them to protect them from the 
foxes. All were eaten, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, a pair of mallard ducks and their seven ducklings were found 
waddling through a carwash parking lot across from Madrona. Humane Society 
workers captured them, then asked Wright what to do. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned that without enough water they would fall prey to Madrona's foxes, he 
told the workers to take the ducks either to the South Coast Botanic Garden on 
the Palos Verdes Peninsula or to Machado Lake in Harbor City. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't looking for a cause," Roser said, "but come on -- they're even 
turning the birds away. It ought to be as sacred as apple pie to keep something 
like this alive." 
</P>

LONGTIME FOES CLEARED AIR FOR CLEAN AIR ACT; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS: A 10-YEAR HOUSE FIGHT ENDED AFTER REPS. WAXMAN AND DINGELL FINALLY 
AGREED TO COMPROMISE. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although House approval of the Clean Air Act came this week, the critical 
moment in ending a 10-year stalemate on the bill occurred last fall when Reps. 
Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) and John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) -- adversaries in 
one of Congress' longest-running battles -- found common ground. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman, an environmental champion, had crafted a compromise on the thorniest 
issue: tighter controls on smog-producing tailpipe emissions. But Dingell, 
powerful chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and chief defender 
of the auto industry, was skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
As the wary antagonists, two colleagues and several aides met behind closed 
doors last October, Waxman methodically explained to Dingell that each of his 
objections to earlier versions of the proposal had been met. Finally, the 
chairman sat back in his chair. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, Henry, you might have something I can support," Dingell said. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting agreement proved to be the linchpin in a sweeping measure 
approved overwhelmingly by the House Wednesday. A similar bill cleared the 
Senate on April 3, and representatives of each chamber must now resolve 
differences before sending a final bill to President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, hailed as a historic breakthrough, virtually assured the first 
overhaul of the Clean Air Act in 13 years, although specific provisions 
remained unresolved until final passage on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The accommodation was considered so unlikely that one Energy and Commerce 
Committee member said that seeing Dingell and Waxman in the same room to 
announce it proved that "the Earth had moved." 
</P>
<P>
One potential sticking point is a House provision allocating $250 million for 
workers who lose their jobs because of industry efforts to reduce emissions. 
</P>
<P>
Bush threatened to veto the measure if the provision remains intact, but a 
compromise on a lesser amount appears likely. 
</P>
<P>
For Waxman, passage of the Clean Air overhaul was the culmination of a decade 
of efforts to reduce sources of urban smog, industrial toxic chemicals and acid 
rain. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, he saw the issue come full circle from the early 1980s when he 
helped block attempts by the Reagan Administration to significantly weaken the 
Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
"No single member of Congress deserves more credit for a strong Clean Air law 
than Henry Waxman," said Daniel Weiss, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club. "He's 
the breathers' greatest ally and the big polluters' worst enemy." 
</P>
<P>
Auto makers and industry groups, on the other hand, have asserted that Waxman's 
efforts will result in staggering new costs borne by business, and, ultimately, 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman was only one of many key players involved in passing the enormously 
complex measure that is considered perhaps the most far-reaching legislation 
Congress will adopt this session. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he and Dingell, whose district includes the Big Three auto makers, 
remained the pivotal holdovers in a changing cast of those who shaped the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
Most prominent among the new players was George Bush, the avowed "environmental 
President." Early in his presidency, he cited a tougher Clean Air Act as a 
priority and introduced his own proposal to get the process moving. 
</P>
<P>
Also vital was Sen. George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), who was elected Senate majority 
leader in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, an environmentalist whose home state's lakes and forests have been 
depleted by acid rain, succeeded Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), whose 
constituency includes the pollution-producing coal industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The credit for Clean Air moving to become law this year goes more to President 
Bush and Majority Leader Mitchell than anyone else," Waxman said. "They 
certainly made it possible to get this Clean Air bill out of the logjam it had 
been in for so many years. I hope my contribution has been to make it a better 
bill, stronger environmentally." 
</P>
<P>
Waxman, 50, a liberal lawmaker whose low-key style belies his tenacity, has 
been involved in the clean air issue almost since he arrived in Congress in 
1974. 
</P>
<P>
He joined the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health and environment 
as the debate began on the first reauthorization of the 1970 act in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
This culminated with the last revision in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
The issue was a natural for Waxman, given his Hollywood-based district in the 
heart of smog-bound Los Angeles as well as his interest in health care as 
chairman of the California Assembly Health Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Since winning an upset victory to become chairman of the congressional 
subcommittee in 1979, he has repeatedly left his mark on major health and 
environmental legislation. 
</P>
<P>
No cause has occupied more of Waxman's time and energy than clean air. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1981, his subcommittee has held 78 hearings on the topic and heard more 
than 700 witnesses, said Phil Schiliro, Waxman's administrative assistant. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981 and 1982 alone, when Reagan and Dingell joined forces to try to loosen 
controls on airborne emissions, Waxman held 30 hearings. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the years, Henry has slowly but surely weaned people off the one side of 
the issue and over to the other," said Jim Florio, a longtime Democratic member 
of the Energy and Commerce Committee prior to his election as governor of New 
Jersey last year. 
</P>
<P>
"He's done it by talking to people, finding out what their concerns were, 
attempting to make modifications where there was no loss of principle, working 
at the margins. . . . Henry is a coalition builder." 
</P>
<P>
With Bush and Mitchell on board, Waxman entered the negotiations in 1989 with 
new-found confidence that he could beat Dingell on the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
But first he had to move his proposals through his own subcommittee and 
Dingell's full committee. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, when the House and Senate members reconcile differences in the bills 
passed by each chamber, the House representatives will be Dingell appointees. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman said his deal with Dingell gives each lawmaker veto power over the 
conference actions. 
</P>
<P>
These political dynamics set the stage for the compromise, which will extend 
California's tough new auto emissions standards to the rest of the country over 
a two-year period starting in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
By 1996, the changes are expected to reduce emissions by as much as 60%. 
</P>
<P>
Another 50% cut in the remaining level of emissions will be required by 2006 if 
the Environmental Protection Agency decides it is needed and technologically 
feasible. 
</P>
<P>
By this week, nine months of intense negotiations and lobbying had taken their 
toll on Waxman's staff members, some of whom have worked through weekends for 
the past two months. Said a hoarse Schiliro: "We're running on fumes." 
</P>
<P>
Waxman, meanwhile, was already casting an eye toward his next potential 
landmark battle. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what he will do for an encore, the lawmaker replied, "National health 
insurance."

YOUNG MOTHER, 2 CHILDREN SOUGHT AFTER VANISHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A young San Diego woman and her two children have been missing for more than 
two weeks, and police are looking for the children's father in connection with 
the disappearance, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Marci Jo Berry, 20, walked out of the Linda Vista apartment she shared with 
another woman May 8 with her two sons and a diaper bag over her shoulder and 
has not been seen since, said Bill Robinson, a spokesman for the San Diego 
Police Department. A lack of leads has left the police stumped. 
</P>
<P>
The children's father, Bonifacio Trujillo, 23, allegedly had beaten and 
threatened the young woman in the past, and police suspect he may have had 
something to do with her disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know the reason for the disappearance," said Detective Don Strey. "He 
may have spirited her to Mexico to keep control of her, or she may have just 
had enough of it and decided (to leave). . . . But, at this point, I don't see 
a lady in her condition just get up and leave." 
</P>
<P>
Berry's mother, Jessi Hoff, said her daughter had enrolled in a high school 
equivalency program in February and had moved just moved into the Linda Vista 
apartment with her sons, Jose Luis Trujillo, 3, and Alejandro Trujillo, 21 
months. 
</P>
<P>
"She was really getting herself together," Hoff said. "She was talking about 
getting her GED (high-school equivalency degree) and learning a trade or going 
to college. She wanted to be able to support herself and Alex and Jose." 
</P>
<P>
Hoff, 41, said her daughter and Trujillo met about six years ago but that no 
one was aware that the man was abusing her until Berry called her from a 
battered-women's shelter about three months ago. Berry and Trujillo were not 
married. 
</P>
<P>
"She was really afraid of him," Hoff said. 
</P>
<P>
The last trace of Berry and her children was on the day she disappeared, said 
her grandmother, Ruth Hoff. Berry went to the Wells Fargo Bank in Mission 
Valley in the 100 block of Camino de la Reina and closed out her checking 
account about 4 p.m. Hoff said Berry would have had to take a bus from her 
Linda Vista home to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone may have seen her pushing a baby carriage," Ruth Hoff said. "It was 
gray and real sturdy. She carried the two boys in it." 
</P>
<P>
Bonifacio Trujillo is wanted on three misdemeanor arrest warrants involving an 
unrelated burglary and also goes by the name of Miguel Salgado Alonso, Robinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He is a native of a small town near Morelos, Mexico, and San Diego police have 
been in contact with the Mexican authorities and news media in attempt to 
locate him, Berry and the children. 
</P>
<P>
Berry is 5-foot-6 and weighs about 150 pounds. She has brown eyes and 
blond-brown hair. She has a reddish beauty mark beneath the right corner of her 
mouth. Jose Luis has blond hair, stands about 3 feet tall and weighs about 40 
pounds. He has a short haircut, with a tail in the back. Alejandro is about 2 
feet tall and weighs about 29 pounds. Hoff said both children understand 
Spanish and English.

SILENCING AN OUTSPOKEN PUBLISHER; 
</P>
<P>
RANCHO PALOS VERDES: ENRICA STUART'S QUARTERLY NEWSPAPER OFTEN SKEWERS COUNCIL 
MEMBERS. NOW MAYOR MEL HUGHES WANTS TO PREVENT HER FROM ASKING QUESTIONS AT 
COUNCIL MEETINGS DURING PUBLIC COMMENT PERIODS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Enrica Stuart says the idea behind her Rancho Palos Verdes newspaper, the 
Monitor, is to jab officialdom. 
</P>
<P>
"You might say I am punching everyone in the nose, right and left," said the 
63-year-old publisher of her feisty quarterly. "I don't care who they are." 
</P>
<P>
The paper regularly excoriates council members for alleged misdeeds, sometimes 
without any response from its targets. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart now finds herself in a personal battle with Mayor Mel Hughes over his 
recent decision during a council meeting to forbid her to ask a question 
because she is a member of the press. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes, who concedes that he isn't much of a fan of Stuart's newspaper, says 
the issue boils down to one of journalistic ethics. Stuart, he argues, is 
trampling on those ethics when she asks questions at council meetings during 
public comment periods. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart, on the other hand, asserts that her constitutional rights both as a 
journalist and a citizen are being violated. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he is a bully who tries to intimidate speakers, particularly women," 
Stuart said. "It wouldn't hurt him to read the Constitution before he starts 
the council meeting." 
</P>
<P>
Stuart, a native of Italy who speaks with a pronounced accent, said her 
newspaper was started two years ago at the urging of her neighbors. It was 
first called "We the People and Our Two Cents Worth" and consisted entirely of 
letters to the editor. Contributors paid two cents a word for their entries. 
</P>
<P>
The paper was a hit with her neighbors, Stuart said, and it soon evolved into 
"a serious newspaper because people kept calling me." She calls the publication 
"an old-fashioned muckraking newspaper" that reports area issues that she says 
other local newspapers are either indifferent to or are too lazy to dig into. 
Up to 5,000 copies are printed four times a year and distributed free to 
peninsula homes. An occasional small ad appears, but Stuart pays most of the 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
Although the paper is careful not to make political endorsements, Stuart said, 
its articles are frequently a mix of opinion and analysis written by Stuart or 
her friends and neighbors. The paper's editorial practices have caused some to 
attack its objectivity. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is an extremely biased viewpoint on what goes on on the peninsula," 
Rancho Palos Verdes City Councilwoman Jacki Bacharach said. "It is like a 
(personal) letter on newsprint." 
</P>
<P>
Stuart's showdown with Hughes occurred last week at a regularly scheduled 
council meeting. Like a number of other residents, Stuart filled out an 
application to speak during a public hearing and submitted it to City Clerk Jo 
Purcell. She then sat down at the press table. 
</P>
<P>
But when Purcell called Stuart's name to speak, Hughes objected. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry, we don't give press reports in the middle of council meetings," he 
said. "You're either a member of the public or a member of the press," he added 
a few moments later. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart, who says she only occasionally asks questions during council meetings, 
protested to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Hughes stood by his decision. He said Stuart differs from other 
reporters covering the council meetings, who "treat their position with some 
reverence." He said Stuart is free to talk with council members and ask 
questions when the council is not in session. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart has sought guidance from the California First Amendment Coalition, an 
advisory group for journalists and public officials. Terry Francke, the 
organization's executive director, said there is no clear law that applies to 
Stuart's situation. However, he said, the state's open-meeting law, the Brown 
Act, does require city councils and other public agencies to set aside a period 
for public comment on matters within its jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas the public agency can establish rules for the public comment period, 
including how much time each speaker will be allotted, a rule prohibiting press 
comment is unwarranted, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Francke said he does not see "any constitutionally defensible basis for not 
allowing a person to ask whatever is relative to city matters in whatever 
capacity with whatever ax to grind or not to grind." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor said he might change his mind about allowing Stuart to speak at 
council meetings on one condition. "If Mrs. Enrica Stewart wants to stand up 
and say she is an unethical member of the press, then I think we would have to 
let her report," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bacharach said that Hughes' ban surprised her but that she respects his 
decision. Stuart, she said, is abusing the system. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . You can't have someone who tries to have it all different ways," 
Bacharach said. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart appears to have at least one ally in Councilman Bob Ryan. He said this 
week that he would not have acted as Hughes did and will try to persuade the 
mayor to allow Stuart to speak at council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"(Stuart's) also a resident, and she doesn't lose that right as a citizen 
because she runs a newspaper," Ryan said. " . . . I don't think she has lost 
any of her rights by publishing that little newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
Stuart said she has drafted a letter to council members requesting that they 
determine under what circumstances she and other reporters will be allowed to 
speak. 
</P>
<P>
She said that although she doesn't "want to stand on the flag and preach 
anything," she believes that her rights have been violated and that she intends 
to fight back. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't scare," she said.

CITY BEGINS PLANNING TO REACH ITS WATER CONSERVATION GOAL; 
</P>
<P>
DROUGHT: CITY WILL HAVE TO USE 17 MILLION GALLONS A DAY LESS TO MEET VOLUNTARY 
10% REDUCTION IN JUNE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The city of San Diego will have to cut water use by as much as 17 million 
gallons a day during June if the city is to reach its voluntary goal of a 10% 
water-use reduction, Water Department Director Milon Mills said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
According to a formula that incorporates past water consumption levels, average 
daily temperatures and growth patterns during the past five years, the city 
Water Department estimates that San Diego's residential, commercial, industrial 
and agricultural water customers typically would use about 248 million gallons 
of water on "the average June day," Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
However, word of the region's drought evidently has prompted some San Diegans 
to begin conserving, because, in recent days, the city has delivered about 240 
million gallons a day to its customers. For example, Mills said, water use 
hardly rose during one weekend early in the month when temperatures soared to 
record or near-record levels. 
</P>
<P>
Based upon that lower-than-anticipated demand, it looks good for San Diego to 
reach its goal of cutting water use to about 223 million gallons per day, Mills 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The city will formulate goals for following months based upon past water-use 
levels and temperatures, Mills said. Those goals will be difficult to set for 
the hotter summer months, however, because water use changes each year 
depending upon "what kind of Santa Ana winds develop." 
</P>
<P>
Water department officials next week will begin sending water-use reports to 
the City Council weekly, Mills said. The first weekly report is due Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Mills spoke at the initial gathering of a water task force that Mayor Maureen 
O'Connor has assembled to make sure that San Diegans respond to a regional 
drought by voluntarily cutting water use. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego City Council earlier this week elected to ignore a San Diego 
County Water Authority request to set in place mandatory water conservation 
programs that limit when residents could water lawns, wash cars and fill 
swimming pools. With O'Connor at the lead, council members instead opted for a 
voluntary conservation program. However, council members agreed to establish 
mandatory controls in 60 days if the voluntary effort fails. 
</P>
<P>
"We take this very seriously," O'Connor said of the voluntary program unveiled 
Thursday. "It's San Diego's way of solving this problem. We're much better off 
(on conservation) now than we were two weeks ago." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor called San Diego's voluntary effort "the opportunity to show the state 
that you can govern through cooperation . . . your mayor's reputation is on the 
line, along with the city's reputation." 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to stress our commitment to making voluntary (conservation) work," 
county Water Authority Executive Director Lester Snow said Thursday. "At this 
point, we don't care how it's done." 
</P>
<P>
Snow once again cautioned city leaders that, without a dramatic cut in use this 
year -- and given an unprecedented fifth year of drought next year -- San 
Diegans will face severe mandatory rationing designed to cut use by 25%. 
</P>
<P>
Snow called for a "massive media bombardment" designed to alert San Diegans, as 
well as county residents outside of the city, on the 10 best ways to reduce 
water consumption. 
</P>
<P>
Those conservation techniques include: 
</P>
<P>
* Watering lawns between 4 a.m. and 6 a.m., and adjusting sprinkling systems 
seasonally. 
</P>
<P>
* Running dishwashers and washing machines only when full. 
</P>
<P>
* Planting drought-resistant plants, trees and shrubs in mulch. 
</P>
<P>
* Using a broom -- not a hose -- to clean sidewalks, patios and driveways. 
</P>
<P>
* Using a bucket and a sponge, not a hose, to wash vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
* Not letting water run constantly while shaving, brushing teeth or doing 
dishes. 
</P>
<P>
* Taking shorter showers. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager John Lockwood on Thursday pledged that the city would join the 
ranks of large water users, including the Navy and Marines, which have pledged 
to cut water use.

AIRPORT HOLDOUT, 79, RETREATS TO HANGAR NOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roger Keeney, who has run Acme Aircraft Co. at Torrance Municipal Airport since 
1945, on Thursday moved a splintered wooden propeller and some ancient airplane 
manuals out of a small stucco building the city plans to tear down. 
</P>
<P>
His aircraft scales and other equipment had been moved earlier. All that was 
left was a telephone, a bare desk and two model airplane mobiles. Soon they 
would be gone, too. 
</P>
<P>
With resignation and more than a little nostalgia, the 79-year-old Keeney, 
whose firm once occupied 2 1/2 acres and had 50 employees repairing and 
refurbishing aircraft, has given up his struggle to keep operating out of his 
office, now sandwiched between new city-built hangars. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hit a stone wall and I'm bouncing off it," said Keeney, whose operation 
over years was reduced to weighing aircraft, a procedure required by federal 
aviation regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no choice. The city owns the property and the city wanted the property, 
and my lease had expired." 
</P>
<P>
Torrance and Keeney have been at odds since 1987, when the city put him on a 
month-to-month lease and told him he eventually would have to make way for 74 
hangars as the airport was redeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
All but two of the hangars have been built for some time. The city lost 
patience with Keeney, refused to accept his rent checks and sued to evict him 
more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Keeney paid $4,670.64 in back rent Monday and agreed to move out. Still to be 
settled is whether he must also pay for demolishing the office building and a 
small shed. 
</P>
<P>
If he wants to stay at the airport, the city told Keeney, he must either build 
himself a new facility or merge with another airport business. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of building is prohibitive for a small operation, he said, and while 
he seems easygoing, Keeney is not the type to share his secrets with a 
competitor. "I will not show them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The inventive Keeney may have found a third way. 
</P>
<P>
When the city began its campaign to oust him, Keeney said, he increasingly took 
his business on the road. He would fly or drive with his scales to other 
airports to weigh planes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I weigh very few of them here," he said. "Someone calls. I say, 'I'll come.' I 
tack something on for travel." 
</P>
<P>
All he needs at the Torrance airport is a desk, some files, a telephone and 
storage space for the scales. Everything but the telephone has been installed 
in a loft built into one of two hangars that he rents for his two Cessnas. 
</P>
<P>
Because leases at the airport specify that hangars are to be used only for 
aircraft storage, Keeney was reluctant to call his new setup an office. 
</P>
<P>
"Not really," he said, "because the city says I can't have an office." 
</P>
<P>
With a grin, he said all that is here "is a free-standing card table. . . . I 
don't want to retire. It's too much fun here." 
</P>
<P>
William Quale, Torrance assistant city attorney, laughed when he heard Keeney's 
description of the loft space. 
</P>
<P>
"Hangars are for storing aircraft," he said. "I hesitate to comment on that."

ELDER POISED TO CASH IN ON POLITICAL ADVANTAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE HATCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He is the only South Bay state legislator with a primary opponent, but 
Assemblyman Dave Elder (D-San Pedro) appears poised to win a seventh two-year 
term, political organizers say. 
</P>
<P>
Elder's name surfaced in recent news reports about alleged political 
improprieties involving one of his aides. But party organizers say Elder's 
years of attention to his district, and the weakness of his opposition, will 
shield him from political fallout. 
</P>
<P>
"Dave Elder has been working hard for his district," said Carmen O. Perez of 
Long Beach, chief deputy to Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn and one 
of five vice chairs of the Democratic National Committee. "People tend to 
remember that more than a negative news article." 
</P>
<P>
News reports published last week said state prosecutors in 1988 questioned 
whether Elder aide Susan Grivas raised campaign money for Controller Gray Davis 
during working hours. The queries were part of an investigation into 
allegations that Davis illegally used public resources in his 1986 election 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Elder and Grivas, who no longer works for the assemblyman, have denied 
wrongdoing. State officials say they decided not to conduct a separate inquiry 
into Elder's actions because the assertions of a key informant could not be 
confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic organizers say news that the Davis probe touched Elder's office will 
have little effect on voters in the 57th District, which spans San Pedro, 
Wilmington, Harbor City and much of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people in the 57th are happy with the things Dave has done," said 
Betty Karnette, a member of the Democratic Party's 57th District executive 
board. "People think a lot of things in (the reports on Elder) were just a lot 
of hearsay." 
</P>
<P>
Elder said he doesn't expect news of the Davis inquiry to affect his reelection 
prospects because, in his view, "there is no issue." 
</P>
<P>
Elder has drawn two challengers this year: a Democrat and a Republican. 
Neither, however, seems likely to amass the resources needed for an effective 
districtwide campaign against the six-term incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Musgrave, Elder's opponent in the June 5 primary, is a political newcomer 
who is living on welfare. In an interview, Musgrave said he should be elected 
so the district can benefit from his educational background -- a master's 
degree in business administration and a bachelor's degree in physics. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has no quarrel with Elder's performance in office: "As far as I 
know, he's doing a good job." 
</P>
<P>
To push his own candidacy, Musgrave has campaigned door-to-door in four of the 
district's 204 precincts and is also planning a campaign mailer. Because he is 
short of money, the mailing will be limited in scope, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be just for my precinct," said Musgrave, formerly a part-time physics 
teacher at Long Beach College and Los Angeles City College. "That's all I can 
afford." 
</P>
<P>
Musgrave reports raising only $15 for his campaign so far. As of March, by 
contrast, Elder had more than $30,000 on hand, according to his most recent 
campaign finance statement. 
</P>
<P>
Should Elder win the primary as expected, his Republican opponent in the Nov. 6 
general election will be caseworker Rodney D. Guarneri of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Political organizers agree that Guarneri, who has no primary opposition, faces 
an uphill battle in the general election -- if only because of the political 
makeup of the district, where Democrats hold a 61% to 29% advantage in 
registration. 
</P>
<P>
Said Steve Johnson, Republican Party director for Los Angeles County: "The 
registration figures are pretty lopsided." 
</P>
<P>
Elder said that he has nevertheless committed himself to a heavy speaking 
schedule in the 57th District and plans to do intensive campaign mailing: "We 
never take anything for granted."

FIRM FINED $450,000 FOR MISHANDLING OF ASBESTOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A Los Angeles development company was fined $450,000 Thursday for violating 
hazardous waste regulations in connection with the improper disposal of 
asbestos during demolition of an Atwater Village pottery factory, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Perlita in L.A. Inc. pleaded no contest to one count of illegal disposal of 
hazardous waste during an arraignment hearing in Los Angeles County Municipal 
Court, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert M. Brodney. 
</P>
<P>
The West Los Angeles company, one of its site supervisors and two contractors 
were charged last month with allowing friable asbestos -- crumbly material that 
could release airborne particles -- to escape in December, 1988, when they 
demolished kilns and factory structures at the defunct Franciscan Ceramics 
plant. The structures at 2901 Los Feliz Blvd. were being demolished in 
preparation for development of the 45-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
Under a plea agreement with prosecutors, Perlita, in addition to the fine, was 
placed on three years probation by Municipal Judge Candace Beason, Brodney 
said. Environmental regulations allow for corporate violators to be charged as 
if they were an individual person. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't put a corporation in jail," Brodney said. "They are paying a fine. 
$450,000 is a substantial fine." Brodney said other companies in Los Angeles 
County have been fined $600,000 or more for similar violations. 
</P>
<P>
Brodney said Perlita is also cleaning up the ceramics plant site and has 
already paid $150,000 to clean bricks that were taken from the kilns and 
transported to a brick-crushing plant in Barstow. 
</P>
<P>
At the arraignment hearing Thursday, Pradeep Agnihotri of El Toro, John Edwards 
of Arcadia and Al Sesar of Newport Beach pleaded innocent to two counts each of 
illegal disposal and transportation of hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
Agnihotri, 33, was the site manager for Perlita, and Edwards, 52, operated a 
company that demolished the kiln structures, authorities said. The debris was 
trucked to Barstow by a company operated by the 37-year-old Sesar. 
</P>
<P>
Brodney said the kiln structures contained powdered asbestos insulation that 
should have been vacuumed out and bagged in accordance with health regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"They should have known those kilns had asbestos in them," Brodney said. "They 
just knocked them down, scooped it all up and put it in trucks, and it was 
taken to San Bernardino for recycling." 
</P>
<P>
Brodney said if the asbestos had not been discovered by health inspectors 
shortly after the demolition, the contaminated bricks would have been crushed 
and the material then possibly used to make roof tiles. 
</P>
<P>
Though the kilns were torn down during two weeks of heavy Santa Ana wind 
activity in the area, health authorities who later tested air quality near the 
site could not determine if any of the asbestos became airborne during the 
demolition, Brodney said. 
</P>
<P>
Perlita in L.A. is the corporate name for the Franciscan Promenade partnership, 
which is completing cleanup of the property before development, officials said.

POLICE BAFFLED BY ABSENCE OF WITNESSES IN THE SLAYING OF SALVADORAN IMMIGRANT 
</P>

Napoleon Armando Rivera went to the Sepulveda Recreation Center on Cinco de 
Mayo to relax and listen to music. Late that evening, Los Angeles police found 
his body on a sidewalk next to the park. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly three weeks later, detectives have no suspects in the fatal shooting 
they believe might have occurred during a robbery. But what is more baffling to 
them is that they have no witnesses, and that the person who reported the 
slaying called from a pay phone more than a mile from the park. 
</P>
<P>
"This happened in a park on Cinco de Mayo and we can't find any witnesses," 
Detective James Vojtecky said in a news conference at the park Thursday. "We 
feel there had to have been people here, but we haven't been able to find them. 
It's a strange case because we are spending our time trying to identify 
witnesses before we can identify a suspect." 
</P>
<P>
Rivera, 28, of Panorama City, was a Salvadoran immigrant who worked at a 
McDonald's in Van Nuys. Police said he often came to the park at Kester Avenue 
and Parthenia Street in his spare time. 
</P>
<P>
On the evening of Saturday, May 5, investigators said, many people were at the 
park to celebrate Cinco de Mayo with live music and family picnics. By 
comparison, when police went to the park the following Saturday evening they 
found about 250 people but no witnesses to the previous week's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Rivera was shot about 10 p.m., investigators concede that the 
number of people in the park had probably thinned considerably. Investigators 
said they are looking for anyone who might have witnessed the shooting or had 
seen Rivera earlier in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Phil Morritt said police were not alerted to the shooting until 11 
p.m. when a man made a 911 call from a pay phone at Roscoe Boulevard and 
Woodman Avenue, more than a mile away. "When officers arrived at the park there 
was no one here," Morritt said. "They found the body." 
</P>
<P>
Police said they are trying to find the caller because there is a chance he 
might have seen the shooting or something that will aid the investigation. 
Morritt said the man, a Latino, told the emergency operator that his name was 
Mario and that he lived in North Hollywood. He said he left the park before 
calling because he was with his 7-month-old son.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: RAMONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An elderly Ramona woman was killed Thursday afternoon when a truck driver 
reportedly ran a stop sign and struck her as she attempted to cross a street in 
her wheelchair, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The 76-year-old victim, whose name was not released Thursday night because the 
coroner's office could not locate her family, was pronounced dead at the scene 
after being broadsided by the pickup truck and dragged about 15 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Maggie Williams, a California Highway Patrol dispatcher, said the elderly woman 
was on the shoulder of Main Street and crossing 9th Street in Ramona when she 
was hit shortly before 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Williams identified the truck driver as Gary Hite, 28, of Ramona. She said 
witnesses reported that Hite failed to obey a stop sign when he struck the 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
She said, however, that Hite was not cited for a driving offense at the scene, 
and that the accident was still under investigation.

CATHIE WRIGHT, CHALLENGER WAGE EXPENSIVE PRIMARY BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) and her GOP challenger, Hunt Braly, 
have poured nearly $400,000 since January into their bitter primary-election 
battle, making it by far the most expensive San Fernando Valley-area race this 
year, campaign reports released Thursday showed. 
</P>
<P>
The reports -- the last before the June 5 election -- also showed GOP 
congressional candidate Sang Korman outspent Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi 
Valley) by more than 3 to 2 this year, aided by a $200,000 loan from himself to 
his campaign, while raising less than half as much from outside contributors. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, 61, reported spending $231,810 since Jan. 1 in her effort to win a 
sixth term in the 37th Assembly District, which covers northern and western Los 
Angeles County and portions of Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. She raised 
$130,805 in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
Braly, 35, has spent $158,202 since the beginning of the year while raising 
$139,518, including a $60,000 personal loan he made to his campaign, his 
expenditure statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The race has erupted into an expensive, high-stakes struggle as Wright tries to 
fend off Braly's charges that she misused her official position by trying to 
fix her daughter's traffic tickets. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates have filled Republican mailboxes in recent weeks with half a 
dozen slick brochures apiece attacking each other and touting their respective 
platforms. The cost of the mailings represents about two-thirds of the 
candidates' overall campaign budgets. 
</P>
<P>
Wright spokesman Carlos Rodriguez charged that the fact Braly is loaning money 
to his campaign "is a sure indicator" he lacks sufficient community support to 
win. "When he has to loan himself money to run for public office . . . that's 
pathetic," Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
Braly said he has taken in more money than "any other primary challenger in the 
state" and that he has enough cash to wage a strong campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly and Korman faced off two years ago for the GOP nomination in the 21st 
Congressional District, which covers northern and western Los Angeles County 
and southern Ventura County. In that race, Korman, a wealthy Korean-American 
real estate developer, personally loaned his campaign $245,000. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly, a conservative first elected in 1986, reported raising $176,500 this 
year and spending $98,623. His contributions included $25,498 from political 
action committees representing special interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the $200,000 personal loan, Korman's report said he has raised 
$73,446 since the beginning of 1990 from individual contributors, the majority 
of them Korean-Americans. Korman's campaign spent $168,768 during the same 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Korman spokesman Brad Durrell said his candidate must spend significantly more 
than Gallegly to overcome "the power of the incumbency." 
</P>
<P>
"Challengers who win tend to spend more money," he said. "Mr. Gallegly gets 
free newsletters, he gets free staff, he gets a free 800 number. He gets a lot 
of perks to communicate with his constituents." 
</P>
<P>
Spending reports also showed that Northridge real estate broker Paula Boland 
has a heavy fund-raising lead in the five-candidate race for the GOP nomination 
to succeed retiring Assemblywoman Marian La Follette (R-Northridge). 
</P>
<P>
Boland has taken in $112,113 since Jan 1, while her nearest competitor, La 
Follette aide Rob Wilcox, raised $56,634. Attorney Bob Scott reported raising 
$52,274, including a loan from himself of $30,914. 
</P>
<P>
Boland said her fund-raising lead "is like a victory. . . . I feel we've got a 
win already." But Scott and a spokeswoman for Wilcox both said they have 
sufficient money to run good campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Among the individuals and groups contributing to Boland were the California 
Right to Life organization, wealthy Valley car dealer H.F. Boeckmann, and 
Robert Wilkinson, a lobbyist for the proposed Porter Ranch development. 
</P>
<P>
Another candidate, Hal Styles, said he spent $700. The fifth candidate, martial 
arts teacher Al Thomas, could not be reached for comment.

L.A. SCHOOL BOARD REJECTS STIFFER PENALTY ON WEAPONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How reassuring to know, as Roberta Weintraub stated, that the Los Angeles Board 
of Education is more interested in protecting students who bring guns on campus 
than it is in protecting the vast majority of students who do not bring weapons 
as well as all teachers, administrators, and all other campus personnel (Metro, 
May 8). 
</P>
<P>
The campus police officer at the school in which I teach still remembers with 
horror and pounding heart the day, several years ago, when he almost pulled his 
gun on a student who was holding what appeared to be a rifle. 
</P>
<P>
The rifle turned out to be a toy gun, but if the officer had pulled his gun in 
an attempt to defend himself and students against what appeared to be a real 
gun, how many would have been injured or died? 
</P>
<P>
Who are these people who run our school district? How long will it take for 
them to ruin it entirely? Does the public care?

MIDEAST HOSTAGES AND ISRAEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry Levin's assertion that the fate of the American hostages is entirely in 
the hands of Israel ("Two Hostages Out, and Hundred to Go," Commentary, May 14) 
is not only unfair, but also baseless. 
</P>
<P>
Israel sympathizes with the pain of the American people and the families of the 
hostages kidnaped and held by the Hezbollah organization and other Lebanese 
terrorist organizations affiliated with it. Seven Israeli families feel the 
same pain as the families of the American hostages. There are seven Israeli 
prisoners of war, soldiers missing in action and hostages in Lebanon. Why 
should the pain of their families be overlooked or ignored by Levin's article? 
This type of pain knows no national boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Israel calls for the release of all hostages in Lebanon, Israeli and 
non-Israeli alike. No distinction is made. 
</P>
<P>
Some people, including Levin, try to portray those being held in Israeli 
prisons as hostages, thereby equating Israel with the very terrorist 
organizations which currently hold Israeli and Western hostages. This 
comparison is absurd. Those being held in Israeli prisons are either terrorists 
active in various terrorist organizations or people who assisted these 
organizations' activities. 
</P>
<P>
How can their serving prison terms for crimes in any way be compared to the 
kidnaping of American and other Western innocent citizens by the Hezbollah 
organization and its affiliates? They have been kidnaped under Iranian guidance 
and inspiration in order to attempt to extort through them financial or 
political advantages and to use them as political "bargaining chips." 
</P>
<P>
Israel again declares its readiness to release Lebanese detainees it holds in 
exchange for the return of all its prisoners and those missing in action. 
Israel emphasizes that it will be ready to take part and make its contribution 
to any move which will bring about the release of all the hostages, including 
the Israeli hostages and soldiers missing in action. 
</P>
<P>
To single out Israel as holding the key for the release of U.S. hostages and 
pressuring Israel to act accordingly, as Levin suggested, is a simplistic 
attempt for an easy solution. An easy solution simply cannot be found when it 
comes to fighting terrorism. Israel is not the problem. Israel has been the 
victim along with the United States and other Western countries.

MIDEAST HOSTAGES AND ISRAEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let's get one thing straight. Tragic as their plight is, most of the Americans 
held hostage in Lebanon are there because they did not heed warnings from the 
American government to get out. 
</P>
<P>
Levin, on at least five occasions, refers to the Shiite and Palestinian thugs 
held in Israeli prisons as hostages. They are not hostages. They are people who 
planned or carried out mayhem and murder. 
</P>
<P>
By comparing these prisoners to American hostages, Levin plays the fool, for 
the two groups are totally different. He goes on to repeat a threat that since 
"the Israelis played a major role in getting us into this mess, they'd better 
help get us out." 
</P>
<P>
This "blame it on the Israelis" policy is a bankrupt one. Perhaps, if our 
foreign policy had been more forceful and better delineated, we would not now 
have to look for a scapegoat. By painting the hostage situation with such a 
broad stroke, Levin fails to put the blame where it rightfully belongs: on 
sadistic Shiite and Palestinian criminals and on weak U.S. Administrations. But 
then, blaming Israel or the Jews is not a surprising conclusion, even for a man 
with Levin's background.

I am a sixth grader who is entering junior high next year. I will not feel safe 
knowing that a person with a gun or a knife will be transferred to my school or 
return after a few days suspension. I think an expulsion is not too extreme for 
a student who can threaten the life of any person on campus! Does the school 
board care at all about endangering the lives of people on campus?

L.A. SCHOOL BOARD REJECTS STIFFER PENALTY ON WEAPONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Insanity seems to prevail in the school board decision not to automatically 
expel students armed with lethal weapons on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Your editorial "When Students Tote Guns, Not Books" (May 9) was equally 
outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
I quote ". . . without kicking out frightened youngsters who carry a Scout 
knife for protection against gangs and bullies." 
</P>
<P>
Thus the writer sees nothing wrong with a student carrying a Scout knife to use 
against those who threaten him at school. Who is to decide who the gang members 
and bullies are, each student? A Scout knife is a deadly weapon and is 
dangerous if used for self-protection. But it is really no match for a gun. I 
humbly suggest that the school board enact a new rule that all students can 
carry guns for protection. Of course, the teachers would be issued assault 
rifles to ensure fair play. Maybe the NRA could be talked into training the 
students in quick draw and accuracy.

Whatever happened to common sense, responsibility and accountability in our 
public schools? The board's decision not to expel students bringing weapons to 
school sets a poor example and shows a callous lack of concern for students and 
teachers throughout the system. 
</P>
<P>
Like a disaster waiting to happen, the increase in campus incidents clearly 
indicates that guilty students as well as their parents should be made 
accountable, severely and decisively. There should be a definite plan of action 
in place now. Do Medflies have a higher priority than our students?

DEEP BIASES, SHORT MEMORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAL THOMAS, Cal Thomas writes a syndicated column in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The condemnation of an apparently deranged former Israeli soldier for the 
unprovoked, cold-blooded killing of seven Arab workers in the Gaza Strip was 
unanimous. Top Israeli officials representing all parts of the political 
spectrum, as well as Israel's press, unequivocally denounced the act. 
</P>
<P>
But this tragedy will be compounded if those with political axes to grind use 
the incident to advance their causes. It did not take long after the shooting 
before both the Israeli Labor Party and the U.S. State Department, which 
increasingly appears to be Labor's spokesman in Washington, sought to link the 
irrational act of one man with the slow-moving "peace process." 
</P>
<P>
Contrast the immediate condemnation of the killer in this incident by the 
Israeli government and press, and the fixing of blame on the Israeli military 
and government by Israel's critics, with an incident nearly five years ago in 
the Sinai. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 5, 1985, Sulayman Khatir, who was described by Egyptian sources as 
"mentally disturbed," and who was a member of the paramilitary Central Security 
Force, machine-gunned a group of Israeli campers as they slid down a sand dune. 
As in the most recent shooting, seven people were killed -- four children and 
three adults. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the response of the Israeli government and press to the incident in 
Rishon LeZion, the deranged Egyptian was hailed as a folk hero. There were mass 
demonstrations in his "honor." Iran issued a postage stamp with his picture on 
it to commemorate the event. 
</P>
<P>
As Bernard Lewis writes in his book, "Semites and Anti-Semitism: An Enquiry 
Into Conflict and Prejudice," "All kinds of mutually contradictory fantasies 
were developed -- that the victims were spies caught photographing secret 
installations (in a demilitarized zone), that they had spat upon and torn up an 
Egyptian flag, that half-naked Israeli women had offended Sulayman Khatir's 
Muslim conscience, and even that they had attacked him, forcing him to fire in 
self-defense. These stories remain uncontradicted in the pro-government media, 
which for many weeks withheld the facts." 
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian court sentenced Khatir to 25 years in prison, where he died, 
apparently by hanging himself, but the propaganda damage had already been done. 
</P>
<P>
Those who want to blame Israel first in this incident betray their own biases 
as well as their short memories. What other country has been told to "make 
peace" with those whose declared intentions are its eradication? 
</P>
<P>
The PLO regularly bumps off moderate Arabs who want to talk to Israel, but 
rarely do these incidents provoke international furor. But Israel is condemned 
regularly in the international community for not entering into negotiations 
over its own demise. Would Israel prefer to be shot at dawn or burned at the 
stake? Shall it be dispatched with a lethal injection, or is it time to bring 
back the gas chambers? These are the choices much of the world seems to want 
Israel to make. It cannot and should not be expected to make them.

Avi Pazner, turn on your TV. 
</P>
<P>
Watch a replay of the news videos we saw just the other night, on networks 
broadcasting across the United States and around the world. We saw three 
scenes: 
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers firing guns at boys who had been throwing rocks at them; an 
Israeli soldier dragging a woman in a shocking pink blouse down a street as she 
cried out in resistance, and we saw you. 
</P>
<P>
There you were, Avi Pazner, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Shamir. You were speaking for the nation many of us were taught in synagogues 
to pray for and sing praises to as the land of milk and honey and truth and 
justice -- the long-sought home for a long-persecuted people. 
</P>
<P>
We watched as you said: "Israel is acting with utmost restraint." 
</P>
<P>
We watched and listened, but, sadly, our eyes told us we could not believe what 
we heard. You understand the position we are in, Avi, because from 1974 to 1981 
you were based in Washington as the Israeli Embassy's press counselor and you 
saw the events in the Middle East as we did -- on TV. You saw how powerful 
pictures tell powerful truths and influence powerful policy-makers. It's that 
way all around the world now, as the Cable News Network spreads a visual gospel 
more believable than the most carefully crafted words of the most ingenuous 
government spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
For decades, most people strongly supported Israel in its fight for survival, 
because they knew that Israel's cause was just. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Israel's cause remains just. But the eyes of the world are seeing a 
different story from the one you are telling, Avi Pazner. They are seeing news 
videos from Israel, night after night, that show clearly that the leaders of 
this land of truth and justice no longer speak truth, no longer cherish 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
It used to be, when you were based here, Avi, that television news brought home 
to us the horrors caused by Palestinian terrorists who attacked and killed 
Israeli women and children and busloads of tourists, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
Now it's Israelis who are doing the killing. And now the TV cameras are not 
just getting there in time to show the carnage, as used to happen in those 
hit-and-run terrorist attacks by Palestinians. Today, TV news is showing us the 
killers as they kill. To our horror, the killers are Israeli soldiers, 
occupying forces on the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
The essential truth Israel's right wing Likud Party leaders never understood is 
this: Occupying forces will always be seen as persecuting forces. That's true 
whether the occupying forces are storm troopers who are inherently evil or 
refugees from persecution who are inherently good. 
</P>
<P>
So the policy of the Israeli government cannot succeed if it is the policy of 
an occupying force, trying to strong-arm peace on to conquered Palestinian 
people. Policy toward Israel is changing daily -- in Washington, at the United 
Nations and in capitals around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Israel alone has it in its power to end this sad, downward spiral. Put away the 
guns and end the occupation. Talk peace -- unconditionally -- and do it now. 
</P>
<P>
So, turn on your TV, Avi Pazner, and you will see that Israel has lost the war 
of the global television news. Think about that, Avi, and you'll see that you 
must tell the boss that it's come to this: Israel, alone, can act now to win 
the peace. Or Israel may end up standing alone.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STUDENTS WIN TRIPS TO HONG KONG IN CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Teams from San Fernando Valley and Ventura County schools were among five teams 
that won trips to Hong Kong on Thursday in an academic competition testing 
students' knowledge of Pacific Rim countries. 
</P>
<P>
Reed Junior High School in North Hollywood and Valley View Junior High School 
in Simi Valley finished among the top five in the finals of the Ambassadors to 
Asia contest, sponsored by Cathay Pacific Airways and The Times. 
</P>

AZTECS GET STARTED EARLY, ROUT MIDDLE TENNESSEE STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The San Diego State baseball team woke up Thursday morning, went out in the 
Early Bird Special of the NCAA Tournament West I Regional -- 9 a.m. start -- 
and quickly finished off Middle Tennessee State, 18-6. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't as close as it sounds. Middle Tennessee State got three runs in the 
ninth at Stanford's Sunken Diamond. 
</P>
<P>
"What can you say?" SDSU Coach Jim Dietz wondered. "It was just one of those 
days." 
</P>
<P>
It started with Bill Dunckel, the Aztec leadoff batter, who put Chris 
Crabtree's first pitch in the bottom of the first far over the 335-foot sign on 
the left-field fence. Then he stepped up in the second and hit another one out. 
He added two more hits and finished with six runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they had a good scouting report," Dunckel said. "It looked like 
(Crabtree) was throwing, not pitching." 
</P>
<P>
Dunckel said he has shortened his swing since last weekend's Western Athletic 
Conference championship in Hawaii. A Palomar Community College graduate, he 
entered the game batting .333 with four home runs. 
</P>
<P>
"This was one of my better days," he said. "I like the morning. You just wake 
up, go out and play ball." 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs play fifth-seeded Fresno State (38-22) at 4 p.m. today. Fresno State 
defeated second-seeded Southern Illinois, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Dietz was relieved to have gotten started with a victory -- the Aztecs 14th in 
a row. 
</P>
<P>
"In a six-team, double-elimination regional, it's crucial," Dietz said. "I 
don't think anybody has enough pitching to lose the first day and come back. It 
would take Hercules to come back." 
</P>
<P>
No. 4-seeded Middle Tennessee State (42-14) got two runs in the first off 
SDSU's Kurt Archer (8-2). Then, No. 3 SDSU (47-20) took over. 
</P>
<P>
Dunckel started it with his first home run. Three batters later, Jeff Barry 
reached first on an error. Darin McGhee doubled. Up stepped Brian Grebeck. 
</P>
<P>
Have we mentioned him? 
</P>
<P>
He singled home two runs in the first, then walked twice with the bases loaded 
-- in the second and sixth -- for two more RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Archer lasted until the ninth, when Brian Holliday came in with one out to 
finish things. In 8 1/3 innings, Archer was charged with six runs (five earned) 
and eight hits. He walked six and struck out seven. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't a good day for Middle Tennessee State pitchers. Crabtree, 10-1 with a 
2.95 earned-run average entering the game, lasted 1 1/3 innings. He gave up 
seven runs -- four earned, five hits, three walks and two home runs. 
</P>
<P>
He was replaced by Scott Morgan in the second, but Morgan got off to a bad 
start, too. He came in with two on and proceeded to walk the next two batters. 
In all, four Middle Tennessee State pitchers walked nine SDSU batters. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't a good day for Middle Tennessee State, period. The Blue Raiders made 
five errors and spent their morning feeling like the emperor who had lost his 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
"This team is embarrassed," said Steve Peterson, Middle Tennessee State coach. 
"And they ought to be. They didn't come however many miles to play like this. 
</P>
<P>
"This team was ready to play. SDSU beat us like a drum, and that's all there is 
to it. They're a good ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
Said Scott Dennison, the Aztecs' second baseman: "I didn't think we played as 
well as we usually do. A couple of guys weren't swinging the bats as well as 
usual." 
</P>
<P>
You could have fooled the Blue Raiders. By the end of the second, the Aztecs 
were ahead, 7-2. SDSU went on to score three more in the sixth, three in the 
seventh and five in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs sent seven batters to the plate in the first, nine in the second, 
eight in the sixth, six in the seventh and nine in the eighth. All 10 Aztecs 
who batted got at least one hit. 
</P>
<P>
In the seventh, SDSU put together five hits in a row at one point. In the 
eighth, the Aztecs strung together four consecutive hits. Then Barry reached on 
an error, and Eric Christopherson got another hit. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Boucher went four for four with two RBIs, and that came on a nearly empty 
stomach. 
</P>
<P>
The wake-up calls started ringing in SDSU's hotel rooms around 6 a.m. Dietz 
leaves the players to eat on their own, and several wandered down the street to 
Denny's. But their bus was leaving from their hotel at 7, and they said service 
was slow. Boucher didn't even eat. 
</P>
<P>
That's life on the road. The Aztecs left San Diego by bus Tuesday at 6 p.m. and 
didn't arrive in Los Banos, their destination for the night, until 3 a.m. They 
took off around 11 a.m. Wednesday, and ran smack into a traffic jam caused by a 
jack-knifed semi. That was a two-hour delay. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was really beat," Dennison said. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the early wake-up calls Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was terrible," Boucher said. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't good," Archer said. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked it," Dunckel said. 
</P>
<P>
Figures. 
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
Third baseman Steve Boucher's sacrifice bunt in the third broke an SDSU record. 
It was his 14th of the season. . . . SDSU Coach Jim Dietz said either Erik 
Plantenberg (10-4, 2.77 ERA) or Andy Peterson (9-2, 2.78) will start against 
Fresno State today. It will likely be Peterson. . . . Camel Watch: The Campbell 
Fighting Camels (15-32), who lost to No. 1 Stanford in the final game Thursday, 
7-0, come from Buies Creek, N.C. There are five stop signs in town, and no 
stoplights or hotels. A total of 4,195 students are enrolled, and Coach Mike 
Caldwell, a former Padre, was the Cy Young runner-up when he was 22-9 for the 
Milwaukee Brewers. Former major league pitchers Gaylord and Jim Perry both went 
to Campbell.

RAY'S HIT BEATS JAYS IN 11, 4-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Johnny Ray's one-out double in the 11th inning Thursday scored Gary Disarcina 
with the winning run as the Angels rebounded from a disappointing ninth inning 
to edge the Toronto Blue Jays, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
Disarcina led off the 11th against Tom Henke (0-1) with a walk and moved to 
second on Devon White's sacrifice bunt. Ray's second hit in six at-bats drove 
in Disarcina with the run that gave the Angels a season-best four-game winning 
streak and their sixth victory in their past seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Harvey (2-1) was credited with the victory after blowing a save 
opportunity in the ninth. He entered the game with a 3-1 lead, as Angel Manager 
Doug Rader used Mark Eichhorn as a setup man for Harvey instead of as a closer. 
Rader has often said he wanted to get Harvey into more save situations, but 
Harvey squandered the chance he was given Thursday, yielding a single to Mookie 
Wilson, a double to Kelly Gruber and a sacrifice fly before throwing a wild 
pitch that tied the game on what was supposed to be an intentional walk to Fred 
McGriff. 
</P>
<P>
"I just tried to lob it in right to him," Harvey said. "I didn't have my 
mind-set right and I threw it too easy. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy we won, but I would have been happier if we won it in the ninth." 
</P>
<P>
Wally Joyner had another big game, going three for four to raise his average to 
.318. 
</P>
<P>
Although starting pitcher Kirk McCaskill was unable to get out of the fourth 
inning, a succession of relievers stifled Toronto's offense until Harvey came 
on. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill, making his first start since May 10, left with the Blue Jays holding 
a 1-0 lead, built in the third on a walk, an error and a single by McGriff. The 
Angels overcame that deficit in the fourth on Joyner's single and Dante 
Bichette's forceout and added a run in the fifth on an infield single, a walk 
and Joyner's second single of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
California used three pitchers in the sixth alone: Mike Fetters began the 
inning, but was relieved by Scott Bailes after walking Manny Lee and allowing a 
double to Junior Felix. Bailes walked Tony Fernandez and got Mookie Wilson to 
pop up to short before being relieved, in turn, by Mark Eichhorn. The 
side-armer threw only one pitch, but the Angels' infield turned it into a 
double play that ended the inning. 
</P>
<P>
As has become normal for him this season, McCaskill constantly worked with 
runners on base. He escaped a first-and-third situation in the first and a 
first-and-second jam in the second -- getting out of the latter trouble when 
left fielder Bichette leaped against the fence in left-center to rob Tony 
Fernandez of a home run. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill, who had issued 18 walks in his previous 35 1/3 innings, put himself 
in trouble in the third when he walked Wilson leading off the inning. He got 
Kelly Gruber on a fly to right, but third baseman Rick Schu couldn't handle 
Bell's shot to third. Wilson went to second on the error and scored on 
McGriff's looping single to right-center. 
</P>
<P>
An error and another walk in the fourth brought an end to McCaskill's outing. 
Fetters came in and defused the Blue Jays' threat. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner's hot hitting helped the Angels come back and take a 2-1 lead in the 
bottom of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Davis began the inning with a walk and moved to second on Dave Winfield's 
single to center. Davis scored on Joyner's sharply hit single and Winfield went 
to third. Bichette's force play scored Winfield. 
</P>
<P>
Another RBI single by Joyner padded the Angels' lead to 3-1 in the fifth off 
John Cerutti. Davis reached on an infield single and Winfield walked. Davis was 
caught stealing third, but prolonged the rundown enough for Winfield to take 
second, and Winfield scored on Joyner's soft single to right-center. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Infielder Rick Schu was recalled from triple-A Edmonton to replace injured Jack 
Howell, and started at third base Thursday. Howell was placed on the 15-day 
disabled list Wednesday because of a sprained left knee. Schu, who was optioned 
to Edmonton on May 19 when pitcher Mike Fetters was recalled, hit .286 in three 
games with the Trappers with one home run and three RBIs. . . . Gary Disarcina 
singled in the sixth for his first major league hit in 10 at-bats. The crowd of 
24,460 rewarded him with a round of applause. 
</P>
<P>
Infielder Mark McLemore (sprained right wrist) was assigned to Edmonton for 
rehabilitation. Catcher Bill Schroeder (post-surgical elbow problems) was sent 
to Class-A Palm Springs, also for rehabilitation. . . . Shortstop Dick 
Schofield said his strained hamstring "feels real good," but wouldn't put a 
timetable on his return.

AFTER PADRES GET LOUD, THEY GET ON METS, 5-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
There was the sound of muffled voices from behind the cinder block walls of the 
visiting clubhouse at Shea Stadium Thursday afternoon. They became louder. Then 
there were shouts. 
</P>
<P>
This was supposed to be a Padre team meeting, but by the time it ended, it was 
more like a summit. It kept going and going and going. By the time it finally 
ended 50 minutes later, it was too late for the Padres to even take batting 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
They marched onto the field, refused to talk to waiting reporters and promptly 
played their best baseball of the season, defeating the Mets, 5-4, in front of 
31,659 fans at Shea Stadium who were wondering just who these imposters were in 
the brown pinstripe uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that you mention it," shortstop Garry Templeton said, "it's time to do 
something about these damn uniforms. We've got to change these things. We need 
to start looking like a ballclub instead of like jailbirds. 
</P>
<P>
"We look like Taco Bell." 
</P>
<P>
Before anyone gets carried away, Padre Manager Jack McKeon said, let's not 
forget that this was just one game. Besides, he had two previous team meetings 
this season, also resulting in immediate victories. 
</P>
<P>
But this one, McKeon finally conceded, was different from the others. This one 
was an in-your-face, let-it-all-out showdown. 
</P>
<P>
Once McKeon had his say, addressing the team for about 10 minutes, he was 
kicked out. It was the players' turn, and as several said later, it got 
downright nasty at times. 
</P>
<P>
They talked about their lackadaisical play, and from what could be heard from 
outside the clubhouse, pitcher Bruce Hurst did just fine addressing that issue. 
</P>
<P>
They talked about their lack of concentration, giving up key home runs or 
committing errors at the most inopportune times. 
</P>
<P>
And yes, they talked about the accusations of selfishness involving right 
fielder Tony Gwynn, made public by third baseman Mike Pagliarulo and echoed 
anonymously by several others. 
</P>
<P>
It's unknown just how that issue was handled, because Gwynn refused to talk to 
reporters after the game and Pagliarulo would not address the subject. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's just say there were a lot of things brought up," first baseman Jack 
Clark said, "and that was covered." 
</P>
<P>
From now on, the players vowed, there no longer will be any quotes attributed 
to anyone anonymously or said about unnamed players. If someone has a gripe 
about a player or wants to criticize a teammate, it will be said with names 
attached or not at all. No one will be able to hide. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a lot of things off our chest," Clark said. "I know I got things off 
mine. Oh, yeah, you know I got pretty loud." 
</P>
<P>
The idea of the meeting originated with Templeton, the Padre captain. He talked 
privately with McKeon about the idea, particularly because of the accusations 
directed toward Gwynn, and by late Wednesday, McKeon, Templeton and Clark 
decided just how this would be handled. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone knew it was coming," McKeon said. "The players knew they 
deserved it. There are times when they need to have their asses kicked, and 
this was one of them." 
</P>
<P>
With that, the Padres went out and built a 5-0 lead, knocked Met ace Frank 
Viola out of the game in the fourth and hung on for dear life when Craig 
Lefferts rescued starter Andy Benes and saved his sixth game. 
</P>
<P>
Just how important was it for the Padres to win this game? 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight was the biggest game of the year," Pagliarulo said. "I'm not kidding. 
I'm dead serious. And tomorrow will be the biggest game of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to have that approach, or it's just not going to work. If we don't do 
that, we might as well pack up our bags. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in a while, we played as a team tonight, and you saw what 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
The Padre team that played Thursday didn't even resemble the guys who have dug 
themselves a 9 1/2-game hole in the division race with a 19-21 record. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, they actually had a lead for a change. And they were even 
stealing bases. In fact, leadoff hitter Bip Roberts' two steals was just one 
shy of the team's total the previous 15 games. All right, they gave up their 
usual quota of homers when Benes gave up two in the fifth. But that was Benes 
also going two for two with two RBIs and a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight we finally played the way we were capable of playing," Templeton said. 
"Everybody was busting their asses out there, and that's why we won. If you 
don't go out there and concentrate, then the meeting isn't worth a damn. It's 
just a waste of words." 
</P>
<P>
There was no better example of the Padres' rejuvenated spirit than in the sixth 
inning, when Met third baseman Howard Johnson hit a foul ball toward the 
stands. Templeton, Pagliarulo and Roberts each sprinted over. As the ball began 
to fall, Pagliarulo batted it up in the air. Templeton took a swipe at it, and 
it bounced off his wrist. And then Templeton grabbed the ball barehanded with 
Roberts crouched beneath, waiting for a final tip. 
</P>
<P>
"That play right there showed how this team has come together," Roberts said. 
"We know every time we drift apart, it's not going to work." 
</P>
<P>
If the meeting and victory were not enough, the Padres were treated to a 
special bonus with their showcasing of Jerald Clark at first base. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees have been scouting Clark the past two weeks but have had little 
opportunity to see him because he has been on the bench. McKeon provided Clark 
with a few pinch-hitting opportunities but was reluctant to put him back into 
the outfield because of his defensive deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
So McKeon rectified the problem by putting him at first, a position he never 
had played in the big leagues and one at which he played just twice last season 
in triple-A. 
</P>
<P>
"Why not?" McKeon said, "Let's see what happens when we get the extra bat in 
there. Everyone else has been getting the opportunities, let's give him one." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, with Yankee scouts Fred Goodman and Gene Michael in the stands, why 
not let them take a long look at Clark, who went one for three and actually 
looked quite adept at first. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres and Yankees are expected to talk again soon, and if the Padres get 
their wish, they'll receive reliever Eric Plunk or Greg Cadaret in return. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like we make a deal every year at about this time," McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
"It wouldn't bet against it this year." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
National League President Bill White said Thursday that he's confident the sale 
of the Padres will be approved and finalized in June, possibly at the owners' 
meetings June 13-15 in Cleveland. In fact, one source said that the official 
changing of the guard will take place June 15, with managing partner Tom Werner 
becoming responsible for all club matters on that date. White, who met 
Wednesday with Padre President Dick Freeman in Montreal, said: "It will get 
done, I'm sure of that. We've gone too far and worked too hard in the process 
for anything to go wrong now. Everything looks absolutely great. They've done a 
great getting local representation."

SOCKERS LEAVE TROUBLE BEHIND, REACH FINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON PATTERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
DALLAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few thousand pounds rose and flew from the shoulders of Socker Coach Ron 
Newman Thursday night in Reunion Arena. 
</P>
<P>
It was there that his seven-time champion Sockers made a big leap toward number 
eight, eliminating the Dallas Sidekicks from the Western Division finals with a 
3-1 victory before 7,869. 
</P>
<P>
So what else is new, you ask? Just this. The Sockers were really not supposed 
to have another go at the Baltimore Blast, their opponent in the championship 
series starting Tuesday night in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
As hard as it might be for the players to admit, this group of Sockers stunk 
throughout much of the regular season. They lost on the road. They bickered. 
They finished two games below .500. 
</P>
<P>
Since nobody expects the Sockers to be that bad, Newman felt the heat. October 
through May was one long restless night. Thursday's victory provided a splash 
of relief. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so hard to keep going all the time," Newman said. "I've worked bloody 
hard to figure out everything I can. You just hope everything you've done is 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
For now, it is. The Sockers won the final three games to take this series, 4-2. 
In doing so, they held the Sidekicks to three goals. To clinch it, they played 
team soccer, finding the men who were open and working the ball around the 
carpet as the Sidekicks chased after them. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the past, the Sockers don't have that handful of players who break games 
wide open. When everybody doesn't contribute, this team has stumbled. 
</P>
<P>
But Thursday, everybody did a little, and midfielder Brian Quinn did a lot. The 
defenders and goalie Zoltan Toth held Dallas scoreless in the first half. Then, 
2:55 into the third quarter, midfielder Branko Segota, who missed Tuesday's 
game with bursitis in his left hip, came on for one of his few shifts. He 
passed off the boards to forward Paul Wright with defender Wes McCleod glued to 
his back. The ball found Wright alone in the penalty box, and seconds later, it 
was in the top of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers held their 1-0 lead through the third quarter, but Dallas 
capitalized on a strange power play to tie it 2:08 into the fourth. The Sockers 
were penalized for too many men on the field. Newman said the referees made a 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, forward Rod Castro started to run onto the field and decided he 
wasn't supposed to make a change. He reversed his steps, and the officials 
thought he was an extra man, but Newman said the Sockers had just four other 
field players at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Sidekick midfielder Beto took a pass off the boards from defender Doc 
Lawson 33 seconds into the power play and connected. The crowd was suddenly 
very loud. And the game was tied. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty seconds later, all that could be heard were a lot of people mumbling 
into their popcorn. Socker midfielder Waad Hirmez took the ball to midfield and 
sent it up to Wright, who was open by about the length of the Empire State 
building. Wright dribbled, took on goalie Krys Sobieski and slipped it through 
his legs. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to go around him," Wright said. "But then at the last minute he 
stood his ground, so I just put it through his legs. (Hirmez) played a 
beautiful ball, and I had to finish it." 
</P>
<P>
It was about then that defender Ralph Black pulled out his crystal ball and saw 
into the future. He took Segota aside and said something like: "You're going to 
come in and score the crucial goal." 
</P>
<P>
And? 
</P>
<P>
"He just looked at me," Black said. "I think he probably thought I was crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Crazy or not, Segota did finish things off, faking out Sobieski and scoring 
with 23 seconds to play to send the fans toward the exits and the Sidekicks on 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Just before Segota scored, Tatu, the Sidekicks' scoring magician, took a hack 
at the ball facing an empty net and sent it over the goal and into the seats. 
Had he tied it, the outcome might have been different. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to give excuses," Tatu said. "I had it, and I blew it. No two 
ways about it." 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't so much that the Sidekicks lost this game, it was that the 
Sockers burgled it. Nearly every time Dallas made a charge, the defense closed, 
and Quinn ran down the ball and found a blue-and-gold jersey. He got his only 
point on an assist to Segota, but his performance was worth a whole lot more 
than a mark on the statistic sheet. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for a guy playing on his 30th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just playing great," defender Kevin Crow said. "He can still do that even 
at his age." 
</P>
<P>
It should be noted that Dallas played without two of its key players. Defender 
Richard Chinapoo and forward Steve Kinsey were sidelined with injuries. Still, 
advancing to the finals after all the Sockers have been through felt pretty 
nice. 
</P>
<P>
"Above everything," Quinn said, "there's a feeling of self-satisfaction. After 
a tough regular season, it's nice to be there again and have that opportunity. 
We've listened to other people around the league who don't want us to win. I'm 
really satisfied."

EBY REMOVES THE FLAWS WITH SMOOTH DELIVERY; 
</P>
<P>
PREP BASEBALL: IMPROVED MECHANICS AND ATTITUDE HAVE HELPED WESTLAKE LEFT-HANDER 
CRUISE TO 10-0 RECORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his three varsity seasons at Westlake High, Mike Eby has heard plenty of 
snickers and barbs. 
</P>
<P>
And he'll probably hear them again today when he takes the mound at Bishop Amat 
in the quarterfinals of the Southern Section 5-A Division baseball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
After all, a 78 m.p.h. fastball doesn't do much for a high school pitcher's 
ego. Neither do the bench jockeys. 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, I've seen better arms on a clock! There's better pitch on a tree! 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, a pastime classic. Some joker will make a reference to his 
elderly grandmother's fastball. 
</P>
<P>
Even Eby laughs. "I've heard them all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then something really funny happens. 
</P>
<P>
Eby keeps that not-so-fastball at the kneecaps. He spins a few 65 m.p.h. 
curveballs on the inside corner. And leaves batters flailing at changeups that 
caress the outside corner. 
</P>
<P>
The laughs turn to moans. 
</P>
<P>
The opposing dugout, so jovial two hours earlier, is like a morgue littered 
with tossed helmets and mangled bats. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always told my teammates that I wish I had a tape recorder in (the 
opposing teams') dugout after the game," Eby said. "I'd love to hear what 
they're saying then." 
</P>
<P>
The quiet left-hander's pitching has said plenty this season. A combination of 
sound mechanics, good location and maturity has led to a 10-0 record, 1.43 
earned-run average and nine school records. 
</P>
<P>
It also has silenced his doubts, and those of others, concerning his talent. 
Eby has been as steady as a downpour, completing 10 of 12 starts, and is headed 
for UCLA on a partial scholarship in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"When I hand him the game ball, I know he's going to get the job done," 
Westlake Coach Rich Herrera said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the extent of Eby's success is as baffling as his change of speeds. He 
entered his senior season with a 12-8 record and was caught in the dissension 
that was as abundant as errors during Westlake's 11-13 season last year. Eby 
was soured by the Warriors' attitude and his 6-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
"People look at my 10-0 record and don't think I've had any bad times," Eby 
said. "But I had a lot of them last year. Sure, I had a good ERA (1.61), but I 
got hit hard more times than I wanted to, and I had no confidence in my 
fastball." 
</P>
<P>
Eby, 6-foot-2 and 190 pounds, began building that confidence during the next 
six months. He altered his mechanics and added a changeup. But perhaps the most 
important turnabout involved his attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to get caught up in the publicity, and it went straight to my head," 
Eby said. "I wasn't a jerk, but inside I was real conceited. I thought I was 
the best thing that ever walked this earth. This year, things were going to be 
different." 
</P>
<P>
That Eby -- a congenial, easy-talking 18-year-old -- ever had an attitude 
problem is as perplexing as his repertoire of pitches. 
</P>
<P>
He has assumed the role of a leader and considers Herrera a close friend. When 
Eby isn't pitching, he starts at first base and contributes offensively (.342 
batting average). He quickly shuffles credit to his family, his coaches and the 
teammates who play defense and score runs. 
</P>
<P>
His father, Richard, is the public-address announcer. His girlfriend of 1 1/2 
years, Leeanne March, is Westlake's scorekeeper. His mother, Carolyn, 
administers ice packs after games. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the kind of kid who knows what he wants to accomplish, and he'll go as 
far as he can to reach it," Herrera said. "You not only can count on him 
pitching-wise, but you can count on him just being there. Every ballclub should 
have that type of kid." 
</P>
<P>
Eby is so focused that he has asked Herrera to keep him out of the batting 
order when he pitches so he can concentrate on his pitching. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm kind of in a bad mood (when I pitch), and I don't really like anyone to 
talk to me," he said. "I'm kind of snotty and guys say, 'Look out, Eby's in one 
of those moods.' " 
</P>
<P>
Eby's leadership is one reason the Warriors consider themselves family. Last 
year's stabs have become pats on the back. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of us have known each other since we were 12," Eby said. "We can joke 
with each other and pop off. Nobody ever fights." 
</P>
<P>
Eby has changed stride in more than one way. 
</P>
<P>
With a fastball that peaked at 75 m.p.h. last year, he was in desperate need of 
velocity. Weight training and running helped, but a shortening of his pitching 
stride was the key adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Eby has emphasized fundamentals since Mike first picked up a baseball 
at age 5. The two spent countless hours in the family's back yard working on 
location. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, after 12 years of developing habits, they were gambling with a change 
of mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
"He struggled with it for a while, but you could see consistent progress," 
Richard Eby said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard also used a video camera to detect other mechanical flaws. His son was 
rushing his delivery, jerking his front shoulder open and not using his legs. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of Dick Bank, then a scout with the Chicago Cubs, and plenty of 
work in a bullpen, Mike perfected his pitching motion. "Once the smoothness 
came back, so did his control," Richard said. 
</P>
<P>
He has been as sharp on the mound as he is in a classroom, where he has a 3.40 
grade-point average and scored 1,200 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test. In 78 1/3 
innings, he has walked just 24 and struck out 67. His fastball occasionally 
exceeds 80 m.p.h., and he's no longer forced to aim for the outside corner. 
</P>
<P>
"His biggest change is that he's much more aggressive," Richard Eby said. "As a 
sophomore and junior, he spent too much time living on the outside corner. Now, 
he's more willing to come inside." 
</P>
<P>
He is also more willing to use a three-fingered changeup that seldom found the 
strike zone last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year it was a pitch that I hoped to get a guy out with," Mike said. "This 
year, it's my out pitch." 
</P>
<P>
Bank said that Eby is not gifted with a "live arm." 
</P>
<P>
"But that changeup keeps the hitters off balance and makes a 77-78 mile an hour 
fastball look like 82 or 83," Bank said. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera said it has been the key to Eby's success. 
</P>
<P>
"I really believe that Mike's changeup has made him a 10-0 pitcher," Herrera 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As if the changeup isn't already enough, Eby douses the opponent in poise. 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands Coach Don Cardinal received a steady dose of that poise March 
30 when Eby spun a one-hitter to overshadow Manuel Padilla's two-hitter in a 
1-0 Westlake win. 
</P>
<P>
Eby needed just 60 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you what, that kid just won't allow himself to be beaten," Cardinal 
said. "He stands up there and makes you hit his pitches. His poise was the 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
After two years of seeing Eby, Simi Valley Coach Mike Scyphers felt that the 
Pioneers had an encyclopedia worth of information on Eby. Watch for the 
changeup when you're behind in the count, he told his batters, and don't fall 
for the curve-in-the-dirt trick. 
</P>
<P>
Eby, admittedly less-than-sharp, beat Simi Valley in both meetings this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we pretty much knew what he'd throw, when he'd throw it, and he 
still beat us," Scyphers said. "That's the sign of a great pitcher."

GASTELUM TURNS RACE INTO ROUT; 
</P>
<P>
PREP TRACK AND FIELD: BIRMINGHAM SENIOR TAKES CHARGE ON THE THIRD LAP IN THE 
1,600 METERS AND BREEZES TO 9.10-SECOND VICTORY OVER RIVAL DANNY JORDAN OF 
VENICE IN THE CITY CHAMPIONSHIPS. 
</P>

<P>
Brian Gastelum of Birmingham High was as surprised as anyone with his 55-meter 
victory in the 1,600-meter run in the City Section track and field 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
The four-lap race turned into a runaway during the third lap when Gastelum 
surged away from Venice's Danny Jordan en route to victory in 4 minutes 11.28 
seconds Thursday at Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, who won the City 1,600 title last year and has run 4:10.80 this season, 
finished second in 4:20.38. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised," Gastelum said of the 9.10-second margin of victory. "I 
looked at the shadows (after 400 meters) and I saw (Steve Gonzales) from Carson 
(instead of Jordan) and that gave me a boost." 
</P>
<P>
The Brave senior bolted to the lead at the start and towed Gonzales through 
61.6 and 2:06.6 splits at 400 and 800 meters before opening a 10-meter gap at 
the 1,000 mark and 20 meters at 1,200. 
</P>
<P>
"That was my main objective, to run a fast first lap, take it easy the second 
lap and run hard the third lap," said Gastelum, whose personal best of 4:09.87 
ranks fourth nationally and third in California. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, who signed a letter of intent Wednesday with Southern Methodist, moved 
into second for good just after 800 meters, but the Gondolier senior could not 
close the gap on Gastelum. Jordan has been suffering from tendinitis in his 
right foot the past five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real bad," Venice Coach Chris Hieatt said. "It's just been the last four 
or five days he hasn't been limping." 
</P>
<P>
Gastelum came back later to log a 9:36.65 clocking to finish third in the 
3,200. San Fernando's Obed Aguirre won in 9:23.41 and Wilson's Martin Morales 
(9:26.32) was second. 
</P>
<P>
The first four finishers in each event qualified for the state meet June 1-2 at 
Cerritos College in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
Washington won the boys' City title with 80 points. Taft finished second with 
41 and Crenshaw third with 40. Locke won its seventh consecutive girls' City 
title with 104 points. Dorsey (70) was second and Granada Hills (34) third. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth hurdler Kyle Beck's eyes were fixed on his competition in the 110 
high hurdles, in which he finished third in 14.72, but the Chancellor senior 
maintained tunnel vision in winning the 300 intermediates in a personal-best 
38.75. 
</P>
<P>
"What I did (in the highs), instead of concentrating on the finish, I was 
concentrating on my peripheral vision. I was looking for them," Beck said. "I 
should have concentrated on the finish." 
</P>
<P>
In the high hurdles, Beck moved to the front after the fourth hurdle but 
eventual champion Terrence Campbell (14.47) of Banning and runner-up Curtis 
Hawkins (14.52) of Carson quickly surged ahead two hurdles later. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell is the younger brother of four-time Olympian Tonie Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills' girls' 400 relay team finished second to Locke, 47.74 to 48.22. 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders held about a five-meter lead over Locke during the third leg 
but a poor exchange between Kim Montgomery and Shaunte Parker helped give the 
Saints the win. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we sort of fouled just a little bit and we lost a little acceleration 
on that last handoff," Granada Hills co-Coach Eric Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
Parker ran even with Locke anchor Danielle Frost, who placed second in the 100, 
before the Saint junior pulled away to a three-meter win. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills' 1,600 relay team of Patrice Lattimore, Michelle Fowles, Parker 
and Montgomery finished third (3:56.49). 
</P>
<P>
Lori Mertes of Chatsworth cleared 5-4 in winning her first City high jump title 
over Northwest Valley Conference rivals Samantha Beauchamp (5-3) of Granada 
Hills and Sarah White (5-3) of Taft. 
</P>
<P>
In the pole vault, Birmingham's Howard Schrier won by clearing 13-6. 
</P>
<P>
Taft 400 runner Ruben Benitez entered the stretch with a three-meter edge over 
Dorsey's Lamont Warren, but the Don junior passed Benitez with 60 meters to go. 
</P>
<P>
Warren timed 47.72 and Benitez, a Southern Section 1-A Division finalist last 
year for Trona High, finished second at 47.89. 
</P>
<P>
Benitez's teammates Greg Bernard, Jai Cannon and Irving Carter will join 
Benitez in the state meet. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard improved on his runner-up finish in last year's shotput with a winning 
53-4 1/2 effort. Cannon high-jumped 6-4 to finish second and Carter placed 
second in the triple jump at 45-3 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys' Feltina Means qualified for the state preliminaries in three events. 
She finished second in the 300 low hurdles in 46.60, fourth in the long jump 
(17-2 1/2) and second in the triple jump (35-7). 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando sprinter Felicia Howard finished second (25.28) in the 200 and 
third (12.56) in the 100.

PERRY KEEPS CSUN MEN A JUMP AHEAD OF THE FIELD; 
</P>
<P>
TRACK: FRESHMAN LEAPS 25 FEET 6 1/4 INCHES TO WIN A TITLE AS MATADORS LEAD 
DIVISION II CHAMPIONSHIPS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Under the circumstances, it was not an unreasonable question. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Perry of Cal State Northridge was leading the men's long jump after three 
rounds in the NCAA Division II track and field championships at Armstrong Field 
on Thursday. And people wanted to know, "Is he a true freshman?" 
</P>
<P>
The answer is yes and no. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, this is the first year of collegiate competition for Perry, who graduated 
from Muir High in Pasadena last year. But no, he did not jump like a freshman 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman are supposed to wilt in the heat of national championship competition, 
but Perry came from behind -- not once but twice -- to win the long jump and 
help Northridge take the lead after the first day of the three-day meet. 
</P>
<P>
Powered by Perry and hammer throwers Paul Albers (third) and Dave Youngberg 
(fifth), the Matadors scored 20 points. Defending champion and favorite St. 
Augustine's (N.C.) was second with 18, followed by UC Davis (15), Edinboro 
(Pa.) University (13), and Angelo State (Tex.) and Humboldt State (8 each). 
</P>
<P>
In the women's meet, defending champion Cal Poly San Luis Obispo leads with 16 
points, followed by Northeast Missouri State (8), St. Cloud State (Minn.) (6), 
Southeast Missouri State (4), South Dakota State (3) and Northridge (2). 
</P>
<P>
Perry beat a seasoned group to become the first Northridge male to win a 
national title in the long jump. 
</P>
<P>
Leading after the first three rounds with a jump of 24-4 1/2, Perry was passed 
by Terrell Carpenter of St. Augustine's (24-9 1/4) and tied by James Browne of 
Abilene Christian before taking back the lead with a jump of 25-0 3/4 as the 
last jumper in the fourth round. 
</P>
<P>
That stood up until Browne unloaded a 25-2 3/4 effort -- jumping before Perry 
-- in the fifth round. 
</P>
<P>
Unfazed, Perry responded with a wind-aided 25-6 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew when the other guys had passed me, but I wasn't worried about it," 
Perry said. "I figured everybody was within my range. If someone else had 
jumped farther, I felt like I could have jumped farther." 
</P>
<P>
He almost had to. Carpenter, the two-time defending indoor champion, improved 
to 25-4 3/4 in the sixth and final round and Browne, the defending outdoor 
triple jump champion, improved his best to 25-3 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
With victory secured, Perry fouled on his last attempt. 
</P>
<P>
A 23-7 jumper in high school, Perry has been on a tear this month. 
</P>
<P>
On May 5 at the Northridge Open, he raised his personal best from 24-5 3/4 to a 
Northridge-record 25-10 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, he won the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. title at UC 
Riverside with a jump of 25-3 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just peaking at the right time," said Perry, who will compete in the 
triple jump Saturday. "I really improved my steps to the (takeoff) board in the 
last month. I'm hitting the board well every jump." 
</P>
<P>
Albers, a senior, and Youngberg, a junior, improved on last year's finishes in 
the high jump, but they were hoping to do better. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to get second," said Albers, who was sixth last year. "To lose second 
place by four centimeters is very frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
Albers led the first flight of throwers with a first-round toss of 180-6 and 
was in second overall after the fourth round, but Angelo State's Eric Cole 
threw 180-8 on his fifth attempt to claim second. Steve Adelman of UC Davis had 
the four longest throws of the competition and won with an Armstrong Field 
record of 200-4. 
</P>
<P>
Youngberg threw 172-0 on his final effort but fell one place short of his 
pre-meet goal. 
</P>
<P>
"I was seeded fifth coming in, so I wanted to finish fourth," said Youngberg, 
who placed ninth last year. "I didn't feel like I choked, but my marks said I 
did." 
</P>
<P>
Albers and Youngberg both threw well below their bests of 186-10 and 181-8, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
In the only women's final held Thursday, CSUN's Heather Young ran 36 minutes 
31.31 seconds to finish seventh in the 10,000 meters. 
</P>
<P>
After the first day of the decathlon, John Burton of Northridge was fourth with 
3,598 points, and Lisa Gill was sixth in the heptathlon with 3,005 points after 
the first day. 
</P>
<P>
Burton, who has a personal best of 6,811 points, had marks of 11.51 seconds in 
the 100 meters, 21-9 1/2 in the long jump, 40-4 1/4 in the shotput, 6-2 1/4 in 
the high jump and 50.55 in the 400. 
</P>
<P>
Gill, who totaled a personal best of 4,936 points to win the CCAA title, ran 
15.23 in the 100 low hurdles, cleared 5-7 3/4 in the high jump, put the shot 
34-7 1/2, and timed 26.42 in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
In qualifying races, Northridge record-holder Erick McBride won the first heat 
of the men's 800 in 1:51.14. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Hendrix and Charlotte Vines also qualified for the finals of the men's 
and women's 200, to be held Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Hendrix finished second in the first heat in 21.31, but teammate Chris Pippins 
(21.53) finished a non-qualifying fifth in heat two. 
</P>
<P>
Vines and teammate Laural Isles ran identical 24.79s, but Vines advanced to the 
eight-woman final because she finished fourth in the first heat and Isles 
placed fifth in the second.

The L.A. Heat, which plays at San Diego Saturday night, has signed former

FISHING NOTES; 
</P>
<P>
ANGLERS WILL FIND ACTION HEATING UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
There will be plenty of deep-sea action over the Memorial Day weekend as 
anglers choose the species they would like to try for. 
</P>
<P>
The outlook is for an abundance of fish to be caught. 
</P>
<P>
At Rocky Point, party boats and private boats will find the three Bs: bass, 
bonito and barracuda. The Horseshoe has been yielding some good-size calico 
bass. Barracuda are among the missing at Horseshoe because of fluctuating water 
temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
Catalina Island fishing remains excellent with barracuda and white sea bass at 
the west end of the island. 
</P>
<P>
Yellowtail weighing more than 20 pounds have been caught from the kelp patties. 
Anglers are using live squid for bait with light line, but have lost some 
good-size yellows. It takes up to 30-pound tests to hold the big ones that head 
back into the kelp after being hooked. 
</P>
<P>
Earl Vanal of Santa Monica, fishing aboard the Sumo in Santa Monica Bay, was 
sure he hooked a yellowtail. He reeled and followed his fish from bow to stern 
for 15 minutes, but when it came close to the surface it was a big bonito, 
probably the largest caught this spring at 12 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Kelp pattie hopping: Aboard the boat Instinct 30 miles from Point Loma, five 
South Bay fishermen had full limits of yellowtail, although the size of the 
fish averaged only 10-16 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Leon Campazzie of Torrance landed a 16-pounder, Bob Gifford of Torrance a 
15-pounder and Paul Friedman of Hermosa Beach a 15-pounder. Phil Friedman, the 
voice of 976-TUNA, had a 15-pounder and Martin Thompson of Manhattan Beach had 
a 12-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
Stan and Celinda Woodward of King Harbor Marlin Club returned last week from 
Cabo San Lucas. Stan weighed in a 372-pound black marlin while Celinda brought 
aboard a 105-pound sailfish.

DAMEWORTH, JONES TO LEAD PACK SEEKING STATE BERTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Agoura High distance runner Bryan Dameworth and Rio Mesa sprinter Marion Jones 
will attempt to enhance their sparkling records tonight in the Southern Section 
Masters Meet at Cerritos College in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
The top five finishers in each event advance to the state preliminaries, to be 
held June 1 at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth has lost just once this season at 3,200 meters and is the national 
leader at 3,000 in 8 minutes 24.5 seconds. As a junior he won the Masters 3,200 
title and finished second in the state championships a week later. 
</P>
<P>
The Charger senior recorded a personal-best 8:53.85 for 3,200 in the Arcadia 
Invitational on April 7 in finishing second to Andy Maris (8:53.78) of White 
River (Buckley, Wash.) High. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Jones, a freshman, will adjust her starting blocks next to Pasadena 
Muir's Inger Miller, the national leader in the 100 and the 200. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who has personal bests of 11.48 and 23.57 in the sprints, has beaten 
Jones in their previous three meetings this season -- including a photo finish 
in the 100 at the Arcadia meet. 
</P>
<P>
Jones also will anchor the Spartans' 400 and 1,600 relay teams. 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth and Jones are coming off championship efforts in last week's 
divisional finals. 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth won an unprecedented fourth 1-A 3,200 title in 9:05.61, shattering 
the 10-year-old division record of 9:09.77 set by La Salle's Mark Rueles. 
</P>
<P>
Jones easily captured 3-A championships in the 100 and 200, setting a 
division-record and personal-best 11.66 in the former in the 3-A preliminaries 
May 12. She also anchored Rio Mesa's winning 400 relay team and its runner-up 
1,600 relay squad in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
Triple jumper Gabe Higa of Quartz Hill, distance runner Deena Drossin of Agoura 
and Fillmore's Nikki Shaw, a specialist in the 800 and the 1,600, also will 
chase titles tonight.

PATRICK HENRY ROLLS, FACES MONTE VISTA NEXT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM Q. BERKSHIRE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Patrick Henry, in the midst of constructing the house that confidence built, 
has added another story. 
</P>
<P>
In a San Diego Section 3-A baseball quarterfinal game Thursday against visiting 
Orange Glen, Patrick Henry put the hammer down early, scoring two runs in the 
first inning and five in the second and coasting to a 10-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Henry has every reason to believe the next addition could be a victory 
over Monte Vista -- which upset top-seeded Poway, 7-6, Thursday -- in a 
semifinal Saturday at 11 a.m. at the University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Patrick Henry jolted from a deep sleep and a 1-3 start in the City 
Eastern League to tie Point Loma for the league title. The Patriots have now 
won nine of their past 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
"We're so confident right now," said right fielder Dino Distefano, who went 
three for four, drove in two runs and pitched 5 2/3 innings of relief. "All 
through league, we built our confidence. We think we can beat everyone. We're 
100%, 180 degrees confident." 
</P>
<P>
Those are happy words, but Patrick Henry endured many discouraging ones first. 
</P>
<P>
"We were playing awful," Coach Bob Imlay said. "We had terrible defense and 
average pitching, so I decided to make some changes. They've seemed to work for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Sure they have. Imlay moved John Dutra from the outfield to second base, Luke 
Lowrey from second to first and the whole defense back, back, back. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Imlay's changes were met with little acceptance and a lot of 
hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't like it," Distefano said. "We were griping to each other about it 
for a while." 
</P>
<P>
That ended when the victories overshadowed the losses. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care if we lose when we get beat," Imlay said. "But we weren't making 
easy plays, we weren't playing good defense, and we weren't hitting. I knew 
they could swing the bats." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, Patrick Henry swung well enough to get 14 hits off three Orange Glen 
pitchers. Leadoff hitter Eric Feffer picked up two hits, two RBIs and scored 
once, Dutra was two for four and scored twice and Jeff Williams got two hits, 
including a triple, stole a base and scored twice. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Mendez (5-2) gave up four of Orange Glen's six hits, one run and walked 
two. Distefano gave up just two hits but walked two batters in the fifth before 
settling down. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't used him much, and he didn't pitch at all last year," Imlay said. 
"He started out a little nervous, but he came through." 
</P>
<P>
In other 3-A quarterfinals: 
</P>
<P>
Monte Vista 7, Poway 6 -- Neil Svalstud went four for four with three RBIS, 
including the game-winning single in the seventh and a two-run double in the 
sixth for Monte Vista (19-11-1). Eddie Thompson went three for four with an RBI 
and Brock Marsh went two for three for Poway (20-6-1). 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel 4, Montgomery 3 (8) -- John Moon's sacrifice fly scored Shane Whitt 
in the eighth inning with the winning run for Mt. Carmel (22-7). Eric Dockery 
and Whitt had two hits each, and Doug Hill, the fourth Mt. Carmel pitcher, 
threw a hitless eighth to pick up the victory. Mt. Carmel plays Mira Mesa at 2 
p.m. in Saturday's semifinals at the University of San Diego. Montgomery, 
seeded third, finished 21-9. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Mesa 5, RBV 0 -- Jaime Escamilla hit a two-run homer in the sixth inning 
to give 15th-seeded Mira Mesa (20-7) a 4-0 lead. Marc Nielsen followed up with 
a bases-empty homer in the seventh. Nielsen, who also hit an RBI triple, struck 
out seven, walked none and allowed five hits. KIM Q. BERKSHIRE

Checking Out the Library: When Raisa Gorbachev accompanies her husband to 
Washington next week for the arms control summit, the Soviet First Lady plans 
to stop at the Library of Congress to open an exhibit of rare Russian books and 
manuscripts. Gorbachev also may examine the rest of the library's collection of 
Soviet materials, including a dissertation on rural sociology written by Raisa 
Maximovna.

Gorbachev wrote that paper in the 1950s to receive her doctorate from Moscow 
University.

SEARCHING FOR ROAD TO LOVE IN POSTWAR ITALY;

<TEXT>
<P>
In her recently reissued novel "Voices in the Evening," Natalia Ginzburg let a 
wide-angle lens sweep through an entire Italian village, offering American 
readers a panorama of the people and places that have fascinated the author 
throughout her long career. Now, in two piercing novellas of postwar Italy 
(written in the 1940s), she narrows her focus to create a pair of extraordinary 
portraits, letting a small provincial town serve merely as background. 
</P>
<P>
The switch from general to particular has an extraordinary effect upon 
Ginzburg's economical style. The language seems newly sensuous, as imagery that 
once served a large cast of townspeople is lavishly spent upon a few acutely 
observed characters. 
</P>
<P>
In the title story, a restless and bored country girl yearns for the shallow 
life her sister has achieved as the indulged wife of a prosperous city man. 
Never mind that Azalea treats her husband with contempt, neglects her children 
and flits from one lover to the next, her days a meaningless round of shops and 
cafes. That's exactly the life the narrator desires, and we become thoroughly 
involved as she sets about achieving it, turning in the process from a 
frivolous innocent into a shrewd and icy manipulator. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to three brothers and sister Azalea, the narrator's family includes 
Nini, the orphaned son of her father's cousin. Unlike the others, Nini is 
sensitive and literary, with larger ambitions and horizons widened by incessant 
reading. Although the diarist enjoys Nini's interest and cares for him as much 
as her vanity allows, she has no intention of marrying a man who values 
knowledge more than money. Instead of returning his devotion, she sets her 
sights upon the village doctor's son, a pompous dolt named Giulio. 
</P>
<P>
Though Giulio's family disdains her and Giulio himself has a proper fiancee in 
the city, that doesn't stop him from dallying with a willing peasant girl. She 
becomes pregnant, and after realizing that she cannot be bought off, Giulio's 
family reluctantly agrees to a wedding. 
</P>
<P>
Once her condition becomes apparent, the narrator is sent away to an aunt's 
house in a neighboring town to avoid the inevitable gossip. There she's even 
more indolent than at home, making a spinster cousin a virtual slave as she 
waits for her marriage to a man whose company she can barely endure. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout this period, she hears news of Nini -- bad news, because he's become 
an alcoholic, has let his half-hearted relationship with a young widow lapse, 
and lives in solitary squalor, indifferent to health, work, friends or family. 
Still the narrator is unmoved, determined to marry her Giulio and move to town, 
where she too can sleep until noon while a maidservant cares for her child. 
</P>
<P>
Having realized her empty dream, she's strolling aimlessly in her new 
neighborhood when she meets one of her brothers and the young widow who once 
was Nini's consolation. "It was harder and harder to remember the way (Nini) 
looked and the things he used to say, and it frightened me to think of him now 
that he had receded far into the distance and become one of the vast multitude 
of the dead." 
</P>
<P>
Beneath this tale of shoddy values is another, more poignant story of the 
destructive power of provincialism, loneliness and frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"The Dry Heart" shows more complex aspects of love. Again, the female narrator 
is from a small hill town, but she has become a schoolteacher who lives 
austerely in a city boarding house, waiting for the glorious romance that still 
eludes her. 
</P>
<P>
A family friend introduces her to an older man who passively courts her without 
ever mentioning the marriage she so hopes will transform her life. One day she 
forces the question, and her suitor agrees to marry her. Though she soon 
realizes that the bridegroom has no intention of abandoning his married 
mistress, the narrator has a child and gradually becomes resigned to the 
vagaries of her enigmatic husband, sustaining herself with romantic fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
When the child dies, her link with reason breaks. Beginning and ending with the 
stark line "I shot him between the eyes," "The Dry Heart" is a flawlessly 
negotiated descent into the deep and dangerous chasm separating love's 
fantasies from life's realities.

EDUCATION GOALS NEED TO BE RE-EXAMINED

<TEXT>
<P>
You ran a story on declining college enrollments among qualified minority 
students. 
</P>
<P>
Your "experts" cited rising costs and admissions standards as the causes (" 'A' 
Students Resorting to Plan 'B'," May 20). 
</P>
<P>
Never once did the writer mention the existence of California's community 
colleges, which provide good, affordable education within easy commuting 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps high schools should spend more time working with students on what is 
possible and available and less on talking and thinking only about UC.

No Toon-Up for Tom Cruise: Tom Cruise has dropped out of "Capt. Planet and the 
Planeteers," Ted Turner's cartoon eco-series. 
</P>
<P>
Cruise was to be the voice of Capt. Planet, a green-haired hero who can be 
summoned by five youngsters of different races and nations to fight various 
villains ruining the Earth. But the star's busy film schedule didn't allow him 
to be involved. But the $7.8-million project is pressing on. Previously 
announced stars such as Sting, Martin Sheen and Meg Ryan still remain as the 
voices of such eco-villains as Zarm, Sly Sludge and Dr. Blight. GREG BRAXTON

Anne Bogart Quits Trinity: Anne Bogart, artistic director of the Trinity 
Repertory Company in Providence, R.I., has resigned her post. 
</P>
<P>
Bogart and the Trinity Rep board clashed earlier this week about cuts in the 
proposed 1990-91 budgets. Bogart said any cuts would mean the termination of 
staff members and the backing off from commitments. When the board, which said 
the Rep's operating costs for the past few years were more than its box office 
and fund-raising revenues, insisted on the cuts, Bogart resigned. No 
replacement has been named. GREG BRAXTON

REFORM RABBIS URGE NO BAR TO GAYS IN CLERGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES RELIGION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A committee of rabbis in the progressive Reform branch of Judaism recommends 
that no restrictions be imposed on qualified gay and lesbian Jews who want to 
become rabbis, panel officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Saying that Jewish tradition is squarely against homosexual behavior, the 
17-member committee nevertheless unanimously adopted a guarded, but 
sympathetic, stance on an issue that has agonized liberal-to-moderate churches 
for decades. The recommendation came after a four-year, sometimes contentious, 
study of homosexuality and the rabbinate. 
</P>
<P>
If the recommendation is approved by a convention of Reform rabbis next month, 
Reform Judaism would become the first large Judeo-Christian religious body to 
approve admitting acknowledged homosexuals to their clergy. Until now, the only 
approved ordinations have been sanctioned by local units of the Episcopal 
Church and the United Church of Christ. Only the small Unitarian Universalist 
Assn. and the tiny Reconstructionist Jewish movement have adopted 
non-discrimination policies regarding homosexual aspirants to the clergy. 
</P>
<P>
"Considering the history of discrimination against gays and lesbians in 
religion, I consider this a tremendous step forward," said committee member 
Yoel Kahn, rabbi of Sha'ar Zahav in San Francisco, one of four Reform 
synagogues that minister to homosexual communities. 
</P>
<P>
The Reform branch of Judaism, with 1.3 million members nationally, is the 
largest and most liberal of the three major wings of American Judaism. 
Conservative Judaism, the next largest, steers a more moderate course in 
adapting Judaism to modern life. Orthodox synagogues, which strictly observe 
Jewish law, embrace about 10% of U.S. Jewry. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates to the 101st annual convention of Reform Judaism's Central Conference 
of American Rabbis could alter or reject the recommendations when they meet in 
Seattle next month. The initial reaction to the committee's report has been 
favorable. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's recommendation follows a critical but little-publicized 
decision by the seminary that ordains Reform rabbis to write guidelines saying 
homosexual orientation is not enough to deny admission. The Hebrew Union 
College-Jewish Institute of Religion, in Cincinnati, has admitted and ordained 
gay and lesbian rabbis in the past, but had never spelled out a policy. 
</P>
<P>
The committee report said the seminary now "considers sexual orientation of an 
applicant only within the context of a candidate's overall suitability for the 
rabbinate." Two rabbis on the committee explained in interviews that a 
candidate's sexual preference would not be asked, but the information, if 
volunteered by the applicant, would be considered along with other elements of 
the person's character. 
</P>
<P>
In issuing its recommendation, the committee conceded that it may be a divisive 
issue for many congregations because a rabbi is the spiritual leader and role 
model. 
</P>
<P>
"While we acknowledge that there are gay and lesbian rabbis who are serving 
their communities effectively, we believe that there is a great need for 
education and dialogue in our congregations," the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
Because rabbis are expected to lead exemplary lives, the committee called upon 
all rabbis, regardless of sexual orientation, to conduct their private lives 
with discretion. 
</P>
<P>
If delegates at the Seattle convention approve the committee report with little 
change, the rabbinical association would be endorsing the guidelines of Hebrew 
Union College. Late last year, Reform synagogues -- the Union of American 
Hebrew Congregations -- adopted a resolution to "place no limits on (the) 
communal and spiritual aspirations" of gay and lesbian Jews in their synagogues 
that indicated sympathy on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Samuel Karff of Houston, president of the rabbis conference and a 
committee member, said by telephone that the committee's final report was a 
good one. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the best we could do with our tradition, and yet show sensitivity to 
our own time and experiences," Karff said. "I hope the report will be passed 
without substantial changes." 
</P>
<P>
The rabbinical committee, however, declined to endorse wedding-like ceremonies 
for same-sex couples, saying that the issue is highly debated. Even so, it 
sympathetically addressed the rights and commitments of homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
"The committee strongly endorses the view that all Jews are religiously equal 
regardless of their sexual orientation. We are aware of loving and committed 
relationships between people of the same sex," it said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee was divided on the question of whether homosexuals consciously 
"choose" their sexual preferences but agreed it "is clear . . . that for many 
people sexual orientation is not a matter of conscious choice but (is) 
constitutional and therefore not subject to change." 
</P>
<P>
Committee members said their report reflected the rabbis' strong concern over 
the possible reactions of other Jewish bodies, but decided in the end that "our 
decision should be governed by the principles and practices of Reform Judaism."

MEMBERSHIP ANGRY AT NRA FOR LOSING VOTE ON GUN BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The National Rifle Assn., stung by an unexpected Senate vote to limit the sale 
of assault weapons, received hundreds of calls Thursday from outraged members 
demanding to know how a lobbying group legendary for its political prowess lost 
on such an important issue. 
</P>
<P>
"Our main reaction has been to try and calm our membership," NRA spokesman Dave 
Conover said. "It's one thing to rant and rave to us, and another thing to 
write their senators and to express their displeasure over voting the wrong way 
on this issue. That's what we're telling them to do." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, gun-control advocates celebrated the Senate vote as proof of the gun 
lobby's receding influence. They said that senators formerly faithful to the 
NRA have issued their declaration of independence from what critics 
characterize as the NRA's strong-arm tactics. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate action could improve the prospects for passing other gun-control 
bills, they noted. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the worst legislative loss they've ever suffered," said Susan 
Whitmore, a spokesman for Handgun Control Inc., a gun-control advocacy group. 
"I think this vote shows that (members of Congress are) less afraid of the gun 
lobby than they used to be." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, both gun-control advocates and opponents cited the presence of a 
relatively new lobbying group -- a coalition of the nation's police chiefs and 
sheriffs -- as the driving force behind the Senate's 50-49 vote banning 14 
military-style firearms. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials, concerned about the proliferation of the lethal 
weapons among drug dealers and other criminals, pressed the senators to vote 
for the ban. Equally important, the police officials promised to defend 
lawmakers who voted for the ban against any attempt by the NRA to inflict 
political revenge. 
</P>
<P>
"We're tired of passing out flags to the widows of officers killed by drug 
dealers with Uzis," said Col. Leonard Supenski, a Baltimore County Police 
bureau chief. 
</P>
<P>
Supenski, a spokesman for the Major City Chiefs of Police and the Police 
Executives Research Forum, national organizations composed of law enforcement 
executives, said one of the groups' primary purposes is to assure supportive 
lawmakers of protection from the NRA. "We sent a clear message to the 
congressional people that we will support them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The police were all over the Hill," Tom Korologos of Timmons &amp; Co., a 
public relations firm that represents the NRA, conceded. "When you get the 
local sheriff and the local chief of police from your district calling on your 
guy, you've got a problem. They know these people and don't think of them as 
gun-control nuts, plus they can come out and campaign for them in their 
districts." 
</P>
<P>
Conover said that the NRA miscounted the Senate vote because some "six or seven 
senators voted against their very firm commitments on the issue." Those 
senators -- mostly rural and Southern -- were swayed by the appeals from police 
officials, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"In a contest between the perceived needs of the law enforcement community on 
the one hand and the perceived needs of the target shooters and hunters on the 
other hand, we can't win that fight," Conover said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Baker, the NRA's chief lobbyist, was equally blunt: "We never expected to 
lose. We knew it would be close, but we didn't expect it to be that close." 
</P>
<P>
But Baker attempted to downplay the significance of the vote. "I wouldn't say 
it was our biggest defeat," he said. "The 20,000 state and local gun laws on 
the books are bigger defeats." 
</P>
<P>
He noted also that the Senate ban on assault guns is only a part of a larger 
omnibus crime bill sponsored by Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.). The Senate 
has deferred a final vote on the crime package until after it returns from its 
Memorial Day recess. 
</P>
<P>
"The Biden bill hasn't passed yet," Baker said, vowing to fight the issue all 
the way to the White House if necessary. "There's a long way to go yet." 
</P>
<P>
The military-style firearms subject to the proposed ban approved Wednesday by 
the Senate are: Norinco, Mitchell and Poly Technologies Avtomat Kalashnikovs 
(all models); Action Arms Israeli Military Industries UZI and Galil; Beretta 
AR-70 (SC-70); Colt AR-15 and CAR-15; Fabrique Nationale FN/FAL, FN/LAR and 
FNC; MAC 10 and MAC 11; Steyr AUG; INTRATEC TEC-9, and Street Sweeper and 
Striker 12. 
</P>
<P>
Although it surprised many people on both sides of the issue, the Senate vote 
extended a recent string of setbacks for the NRA. 
</P>
<P>
In the last three years, Congress has voted to ban both armor-piercing 
"cop-killer" bullets and plastic handguns, which would be difficult to detect 
with X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, California, New Jersey and Maryland have enacted laws limiting the 
sale and possession of some firearms. In each of those cases, the NRA has been 
an outspoken advocate and financial backer for the losing side. 
</P>
<P>
NRA executives said Thursday that the organization's membership of about 2.8 
million has remained static over the last five years as the public debate has 
shifted away from the NRA's strict interpretation of Americans' constitutional 
right to bear arms. 
</P>
<P>
"The NRA doesn't carry as much weight anymore because they've gone over the 
edge," said Nancy Coffey, a spokesman for Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), 
who was targeted by the gun lobby as its "No. 1 foe" during his 1988 reelection 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"They have subscribed to the camel's-nose-under-the-tent theory on guns for so 
long, it has become a hysterical view," Coffey said. "Many Americans are 
deciding it's just a ridiculous position." 
</P>
<P>
But Coffey said that does not mean the NRA has been fatally wounded. "They're 
still a formidable foe," she said. 
</P>
<P>
On that point, NRA officers and their opponents share common ground. Between 
fielding calls from members, NRA leaders were busy Thursday planning strategy 
for future elections. 
</P>
<P>
"Gun groups are springing up today all over the West," Korologos said. "It 
might not be all bad to have had this happen. The fence-sitters are going to 
wake up." 
</P>
<P>
Added Conover: "Do gun owners feel betrayed? The answer is most definitely yes, 
and we've been hearing it all day long. Gun owners are going to make their 
opinions known."

For four long days and nights, with much of his body shattered by a hit-and-run 
driver, Juan Francisco Camacho lay near death in the brush-covered median of 
Interstate 5 in Oceanside as hundreds of thousands of preoccupied motorists 
passed by without noticing him. 
</P>
<P>
At first, as the lines of cars whizzed incessantly past on both sides, the 
20-year-old migrant worker shouted out for help in Spanish and rattled a small 
tree branch overhead in the slim hope that someone would see him. 
</P>
<P>
But as the days passed, and as the shock from his shattered pelvis, broken arm, 
broken shoulder and internal injuries began to set in, Camacho lay listlessly, 
talking to himself, imagining that the telephone wires overhead were answering 
his calls. 
</P>
<P>
Finally rescued after a passing motorist called the 911 emergency number, 
Camacho is recuperating from his numerous injuries and subsequent infections, a 
survivor of a painful roadside vigil that emergency room doctors have called a 
miracle case of staying alive. 
</P>
<P>
"I was shocked. It's really incredible that he's still here," said Dr. Edgar 
Gamboa, a trauma surgeon at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla. "Even if 
they get treatment within the first hour, many people still die from these 
types of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"And here he's still alive, despite lying by the side of the road for so long, 
with all the bacteria and infections that had set in his body. Even after we 
got him in the hospital, we half expected him to die for the first two days." 
</P>
<P>
Even highway authorities are shaking their heads at Camacho's gritty 
determination. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the only instance I've ever seen in which a pedestrian has been hit on 
the road and didn't get immediate help, was forced to lay there for days and 
then suddenly shows up on the roadside -- alive," said Michael Tomasik, an 
accident review officer for the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
The case of Camacho -- who says he was simply headed home to a migrant camp -- 
is distinct from those of many other illegal aliens who have been struck by 
vehicles farther north along I-5 while attempting to evade the U.S. Border 
Patrol checkpoint at Camp Pendleton. Since 1988, according to the CHP, 22 
illegal aliens have been struck and killed along I-5 directly north and south 
of the checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
Lying in his semiprivate hospital room, his repaired pelvis in traction, tubes 
running from various parts of his body, Camacho described the ordeal that began 
the night of May 5 as he tried to cross the busy freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The illegal alien from Oaxaca, Mexico -- who has lived in the United States 
since 1986 -- said he had come to Oceanside that Saturday from a migrant camp 
near Bonsall in the hope of finding work. 
</P>
<P>
About 8 p.m., after a frustrating day of job-hunting, he decided to take a 
shortcut across the freeway to catch the bus back home. Just after darkness 
fell, Camacho scurried across the southbound lanes and was walking along the 
inside shoulder of the freeway when the car hit him. 
</P>
<P>
Camacho said he never heard it coming. "The only thing I heard was music," he 
said in Spanish. "American music." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors say the car apparently hit Camacho from behind, shattering his 
midsection. Then the driver drove off. 
</P>
<P>
Camacho recalls crawling off the road to avoid being hit again. "I crawled so I 
could get beneath a tree," he said. "I was rolling and dragging myself." 
</P>
<P>
The next 92 hours -- until he was rescued by authorities on the following 
Wednesday afternoon -- have become a blur in Camacho's mind. He recalls seeing 
the houses that line the opposite side of the freeway and calling out to them. 
His only SOS signal was to continually rattle the branches of nearby bushes. 
</P>
<P>
Camacho was dressed only in a thin, zippered jacket. The nights were cold and 
the days long and hot. Eventually, he lost the feeling in his legs. All the 
while, the pain in his shattered body came and went. 
</P>
<P>
He had nothing to eat but soon noticed a water sprinkler nearby. Crawling on 
the opposite side of his broken arm and shoulder to reach the sprinkler, his 
body dirtied and wracked with infection and fever, Camacho sipped water to stay 
alive as cars whipped past nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Tomasik said the freeway median in the area is shrouded by thick oleander 
bushes that often hide the shanties of homeless men and women. "If he got in 
there, it's not surprising no one saw him," the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday, Camacho had become delirious. He recalled talking to himself -- 
and hearing the telephone wires answer back. Finally, he said, he decided to 
crawl back out by the road shoulder to become more visible. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before 4 p.m., as yet another rush hour began along the often choked 
freeway, Camacho was rescued. Authorities say a northbound motorist apparently 
spotted the worker and called 911 from Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
"When we got him, he was in shock from loss of blood. His blood pressure was 
down to about 60, which is about half the normal pressure," Gamboa said. "He 
was dehydrated, he had a dislocated knee and his pelvis was cracked open like a 
book. There was bacteria and infection from all the dirt in his wounds." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors say the low blood pressure in such a young man shows that his wounds 
went without treatment for many days. But Camacho's peak physical shape -- 
along with the fact that none of his vital organs were crushed -- probably 
saved his life, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Along with a determined will to live. 
</P>
<P>
"How long could he have survived?" Gamboa asked. "There's no way of telling. I 
guess it was up to him." 
</P>

EMPEROR VOICES JAPAN'S 'REGRET' FOR KOREA ROLE 
</P>

<P>
The leaders of Japan and South Korea staged an elaborate show of historical 
reflection -- and Japanese contrition -- on Thursday, making tense and 
carefully measured remarks aimed at putting an unhappy past behind the two East 
Asian neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion may go down in the history books as the "apology summit." South 
Korean President Roh Tae Woo began an emotionally charged visit after weeks of 
controversy over whether the Tokyo government would meet his demands that 
Emperor Akihito offer a clear apology for Japan's brutal colonization of the 
Korean Peninsula earlier this century. 
</P>
<P>
Akihito made a tightly restrained expression of "regret" during a state banquet 
in Roh's honor. 
</P>
<P>
"I think of the sufferings your people underwent during this unfortunate 
period, which was brought about by my country, and cannot but feel the deepest 
regret," Akihito said, reading a text prepared by government officials. 
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen how well the emperor's statement will be received in 
South Korea, where bitterness about the 1910-45 period of Japanese colonization 
remains strong. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of students demonstrated in three South Korean cities Thursday, 
shouting anti-Japanese slogans, burning Japanese flags and denouncing Roh's 
trip as a sellout of national pride, news agencies reported. Some students 
charged that Roh's visit is intended to deepen South Korea's economic 
dependence on Japan and strengthen military ties among South Korea, Japan and 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Although the emperor did not utter the word apology, his remarks were somewhat 
more vigorous than those made by his father, Hirohito -- known since his death 
early last year as Emperor Showa -- when former President Chun Doo Hwan visited 
Japan in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Akihito cited Hirohito's statement to Roh: "It is indeed regrettable that there 
was an unfortunate past between us for a period in this century, and I believe 
that it should not be repeated again." 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government went to great pains to avoid giving the impression that 
Akihito's okotoba, or "august words," would somehow render those of his father 
obsolete, or suggest that the late emperor was less than sincere in expressing 
his regret. Hirohito reigned from 1926 until his death at age 87; Koreans were 
forced into subservience, for the most part, under his name. 
</P>
<P>
Hard-line officials in Tokyo also resisted the idea of Akihito making a lucid 
apology that might arouse Japan's right wing or violate what one government 
official described as the mystique surrounding the imperial institution. They 
used the pretext of a "constitutional constraint" on the emperor's "political 
role" to dampen the tone of his statement. 
</P>
<P>
Roh, in response to Akihito's banquet speech, also read from a prepared text: 
</P>
<P>
"It is not possible to erase or forget historical facts," he said. 
"Nevertheless, we must not remain bound up in memories. Our two nations must 
now forge a new era of friendship and cooperation based on proper historical 
perspective, putting the unfortunate past truly behind us. 
</P>
<P>
"It is significant," Roh continued, "that your majesty, the symbol of Japanese 
history and the new Japanese nation, has shown deep concern about this matter." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Roh met with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, who had an 
apology of his own to make. 
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to clearly and honestly articulate the realities of events 
that have so regrettably marred our past relations," Kaifu said. "I would 
therefore like to express my feeling of sincere remorse and honest apology for 
the fact that there was a period in our history in which Japanese actions 
inflicted unbearable suffering and sorrow on the people of the Korean 
Peninsula." 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu reminded Roh of his government's decision to expand legal rights for new 
generations of Korean residents in Japan, and he said Japan is considering a 
plan to donate about $26 million to a fund for medical treatment of Korean 
survivors of the atomic bombings at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu also told Roh that Japan has allocated about $660,000 in humanitarian 
support in this year's fiscal budget for Korean laborers who were left behind 
on the island of Sakhalin at the end of World War II -- nearly double the 
amount budgeted last year.

CAMARENA WITNESS PLACES DEFENDANTS AT KIDNAP MEETINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The former security chief for a Guadalajara drug trafficker testified Thursday 
that all four defendants on trial for the 1985 murder of U.S. drug agent 
Enrique Camarena attended one or more meetings where Mexican narcotics lords 
and government officials urged that Camarena be kidnaped because of trouble he 
was causing them. 
</P>
<P>
The witness, Hector Cervantes Santos, described a series of meetings in 1984 
and 1985 in which the kidnaping was discussed. He told the court that Ruben 
Zuno Arce, a Mexican businessman, was present at three of the meetings. The 
three remaining defendants, he added, were present at one of the meetings. They 
are Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, a convicted Honduran drug kingpin; Javier 
Vasquez Velasco, a Mexican citizen who also has lived in the United States, and 
Juan Jose Bernabe Ramirez, a former Mexican police officer. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes said at the earliest meetings, in September and October, 1984, the 
plotters were not certain who the troublesome Drug Enforcement Administration 
agent was. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to Cervantes, Manuel Ibarra Herrera, then the head of Mexico's 
Federal Judicial Police, told the group at one of the meetings in October that 
something had to be done because the agent's activities were "causing trouble" 
for Manuel Bartlett Diaz, who was Mexico's Minister of the Interior and is now 
Minister of Education. Cervantes did not elaborate on Bartlett's purported 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that Bartlett's name has emerged in the case being 
tried in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. Ibarra is under indictment in the 
United States in the Camarena case, but is living freely in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The meetings, described by Cervantes through an interpreter, were held at the 
large Guadalajara home -- known as "La Quinta" -- of his boss, attorney Javier 
Barba Hernandez, who prosecutors say is a member of the Guadalajara narcotics 
cartel. Bartlett's problems allegedly were raised at a meeting that was held 
during a wedding party for Barba's brother. 
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic moment Thursday, Cervantes stepped down from the witness stand 
and pointed to Matta to identify him for the jury as one of the men at the 
meeting. The two men glared at one another and then Cervantes returned to the 
witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
On the day of the wedding, Cervantes testified, Miguel Aldana Ibarra, a 
commander in the Federal Judicial Police, showed Matta a folder of police 
files. Matta told the group that "we will soon have the identity" of the 
problem DEA agent and that he would be silenced, Cervantes said. Aldana also 
has been indicted in Los Angeles and is in custody in Mexico on other charges. 
</P>
<P>
According to Cervantes, Zuno said at one of the meetings that he wanted to find 
out what the DEA knew about "my general" Juan Arevalo Gardoqui, then Mexico's 
Minister of Defense. Camarena was interrogated on what he knew about Arevalo 
when he was tortured at a Guadalajara house in February, 1985, according to 
tapes that the DEA obtained later. Prosecutors have described Zuno as the link 
between the Mexican political Establishment and the drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
On two occasions, Cervantes said, Zuno gave Barba credentials for a Mexican law 
enforcement agency, with the clear implication that they could be used by 
henchmen of the drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
On cross-examination, Cervantes disclosed that Mexican drug kingpin Rafael Caro 
Quintero had proposed kidnaping John Gavin, then the U.S. ambassador to Mexico. 
Cervantes testified that Barba had strongly opposed kidnaping Gavin, saying it 
was too dangerous, and that others at the meeting agreed. He asserted Thursday, 
in contradiction to his grand jury testimony, that Zuno had originally backed 
the plan to kidnap Gavin. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes testified for nearly five hours and was expected to return today for 
more questioning. He wore a new brown suit, a white shirt and a gold tie. It 
was a more subdued outfit than the gray double-breasted suit, black shirt and 
gray tie he wore Wednesday that looked like it came straight out of a 1940s 
gangster movie. 
</P>
<P>
The witness also offered grim testimony about how he cleaned Barba's 
blood-stained Mercury Marquis after Barba and another man returned from a 
Guadalajara restaurant called La Langosta where an American writer, John 
Walker, and a Mexican medical student, Alberto Radelat, were beaten to death, 
allegedly after they stumbled into a party held by drug traffickers on Jan. 30, 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
When Barba and his friend Javier Vasquez Ochoa returned to Barba's house, 
Cervantes recalled, their hands, clothes, boots and guns were stained with 
blood. Barba and Vasquez Ochoa told Cervantes, he said, that they had caught 
"some gringos" spying on them and beat them severely using ice picks. Vasquez 
Ochoa's uncle, Javier Vasquez Velasco, has been indicted in Los Angeles in the 
killings of Walker and Radelat. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, prosecutors said, the traffickers settled on Camarena as a 
kidnaping target and abducted him from a Guadalajara street on Feb. 7, 1985. He 
was taken to a house owned by Caro, where he was interrogated, tortured and 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes described how a bodyguard of another drug chieftain, Ernesto Fonseca 
Carrillo, came to Barba's house and told him that Caro "had gone too far" and 
that the American had been killed. He said Barba immediately called Zuno and 
told him trouble was looming because of the murder. 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, Barba told Cervantes he was going into hiding. "He gave me a 
.357 magnum, 600,000 pesos and a pair of his boots," Cervantes said. Cervantes 
stayed at the house and saw Barba only one more time. Barba was killed in a 
shoot-out with Mexican federal judicial police on Nov. 17, 1986, amid rumors 
that Mexican law enforcement authorities were worried that he might tell what 
he knew about the Camarena murder. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes has been a government-paid informant since Nov. 24, 1989, according 
to DEA records. He, his wife and two children have been relocated to the United 
States and have received more than $36,000 in payments from the DEA since 
November. 
</P>
<P>
During cross-examination, Zuno's lawyer, Edward Medvene, questioned Cervantes 
about why he had allegedly told DEA investigators different things at different 
times. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes acknowledged that he did not initially disclose certain information 
to the DEA, including the presence of Javier Garcia Paniagua, a ranking Mexican 
political official, at two of the meetings where the kidnaping was discussed. 
Garcia now is Mexico City's police chief. Cervantes said he did not make the 
disclosure until his family had been relocated to the United States because it 
would have been dangerous to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Medvene pressed Cervantes on whether he would receive DEA payments for life and 
be allowed to remain a resident of the United States. Cervantes responded: 
"Nothing has been said that this money would go on for the rest of my life." 
Asked if the decision would be left up to the DEA, he replied: "Yes, I am in 
their hands." 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes did not give a clear answer about why he decided to come forth and 
testify more than 4 1/2 years after the Camarena killing. He said last fall he 
initially was contacted by a man he knew only as "the Panther" and then was put 
in touch with Antonio Garate Bustamante, a DEA operative, who arranged for 
interviews with Los Angeles-based DEA agents. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a matter related to the Camarena case, officials said Thursday 
that the United States has no plans to extradite a Mexican doctor brought 
across the border by bounty hunters to face charges in the murder. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico's request for the return of Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain, to face 
possible prosecution there, was received by the State Department and the United 
States will "respond in due course," Justice Department spokesman Doug Tillett 
said. 
</P>
<P>
However, officials who spoke on condition of anonymity noted that Mexico had 
not made a formal extradition request but only called for Alvarez's return. The 
officials also pointed to recent public statements by the Justice Department 
stressing that there were no plans to return Alvarez to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez, accused of participating in the torture and murder of Camarena, was 
abducted in Guadalajara by bounty hunters, flown to El Paso, Tex., on April 3 
and turned over to Los Angeles-based DEA agents.

A SPECIAL DIPLOMA IN THE CLASS OF 1990 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINA LINDGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nineteen-year-old Mitsuko Yasukochi Funakoshi was just two months shy of 
graduation in the spring of 1942, full of hope and ambition, when her world was 
torn in two. 
</P>
<P>
With anti-Japanese hysteria fanned by the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the U.S. 
government ordered all people of Japanese ancestry to leave the West Coast. 
Funakoshi, a community college student, was forced to abandon her textbooks and 
flee California with her family, prosperous Norwalk grocers who could take only 
what they could carry. 
</P>
<P>
Now, 48 years later, the 66-year-old secretary who commutes daily from 
Oceanside to Los Angeles City Hall, is about to see her dream of a college 
diploma come true. Next week, Fullerton College will award Funakoshi an 
associate of arts degree for the 3 1/2 semesters of work that ended abruptly 
that April so many years ago, when she and 110,000 others of Japanese descent 
were forced to evacuate. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing makes my life more complete," said Funakoshi, an executive secretary 
in Los Angeles City Controller Rick Tuttle's office. "I feel a little like Rip 
Van Winkle . . . coming back to Fullerton (College) after all these years." 
</P>
<P>
Funakoshi, once a business and arts major, will join 1,100 other graduates in 
full regalia at Fullerton College's commencement June 1 and will deliver a 
speech to the class of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
She plans to tell them what happened to her family and the lives of 110,000 
people of Japanese ancestry who were uprooted when President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt ordered them out of California, Oregon and Washington in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
She and her parents were lucky because they had friends in Colorado who 
welcomed them. Others were forced into "relocation camps" where most of them 
remained until 1945. 
</P>
<P>
In Colorado, the girl worked alongside her mother, father and brothers picking 
sugar beets and onions. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a really strange feeling," she said. "But here we were, American 
citizens (who) didn't know any other country and we were being treated like 
enemies." 
</P>
<P>
Even as she labored, Funakoshi said, she thought about finishing school. She 
wrote to her college adviser, who sent an open-book test for credit toward an 
associate of arts degree. 
</P>
<P>
But the books she needed had been left behind in California. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured, this is it, this is the end of all my ambition. What's the use?" 
</P>
<P>
Years passed. She married, moved back to California, had a son and a daughter 
and a comfortable life with her husband, a furniture maker and garage door 
installer. But the elusive diploma was never far from her mind. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, she mentioned the diploma while talking with the city controller. 
Tuttle's advice: Why not write to the college president? 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, she received a response from President Philip W. Borst of 
Fullerton College. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing her grades of mostly As and Bs, Borst concluded that had 
Funakoshi not been forced to leave in 1942, she would have graduated with her 
class that June. He invited her to attend this year's commencement exercises -- 
a little late, but most welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Is she bitter about what she missed? 
</P>
<P>
"If this hadn't happened, you know, I probably would have gotten my degree and 
done something else with my life," Funakoshi said. "But these things have 
happened and I've gotten stronger. You've got to keep going. You can't be 
bitter about things."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / INSURANCE COMMISSIONER; 
</P>
<P>
CANDIDATES INCREASINGLY BACK REFORM

<P>
Even the two Republican candidates present backed government health insurance 
and an end to neighborhood-based pricing of auto policies at a debate among 
eight candidates for insurance commissioner before a forum of the African 
American Voter REP Project in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The 90-minute discussion on Wednesday night demonstrated the increasing 
agreement on major reform of the insurance industry that marks the 
commissioner's race as the candidates crisscross the state responding to 
different kinds of audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Only Libertarian Ted Brown was completely resistant to an increased government 
role in setting rules for the insurance system. The other candidates attending 
said they were prepared to see the government step into some areas and either 
set the rules or operate the system itself. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the candidates, Democrats Walter Zelman and Bill Press, have made 
advocacy of government health insurance for all a keynote of their campaigns. 
But what was striking Wednesday night was endorsement of the idea by one 
Republican candidate, John L. (Jack) Harden, and modified endorsement by 
another, Tom Skornia. 
</P>
<P>
Harden said, "We need to have a health insurance plan similar to Canada's," 
which has universal health insurance. And Skornia said that while he would 
prefer to have an employer-supported system, he feels there ought to be "a 
government safety net" to insure all those not covered by employers. 
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood-based pricing, known as the territorial rating system, is 
particularly unpopular in the black community -- where the poor are charged 
among the state's highest auto insurance rates when they can find a company 
willing to sell to them at all. At the debate, the system was roundly 
condemned. 
</P>
<P>
Press called territorial ratings "discriminatory, racist, illegal and wrong." 
Another Democratic candidate, Larry Murphy, a 37-year veteran in the insurance 
business, told of the refusal of companies he had worked for to sell in black 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Skornia said, "Read my lips -- no more redlining" and went on to call a recent 
decision by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Miriam Vogel upholding 
neighborhood-based pricing "just plain wrong." 
</P>
<P>
When the Libertarian, Brown, said the government should have no role in dealing 
with such problems, Skornia responded, "There is more waste, corruption and 
fraud in the insurance industry than in the government. As commissioner, I will 
deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
In other developments in the commissioner's race, meanwhile: 
</P>
<P>
Zelman, who Thursday won the endorsement of the Long Beach Press-Telegram, told 
consumer advocate Ralph Nader he had decided not to respond to his 
questionnaire on insurance issues, in part because he considered it a setup for 
Nader to support Conway Collis, another Democratic candidate. And Press and 
Skornia, saying they found deficiencies in Nader's 71 questions, sent along 
their own additional questions and comments. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. John Garamendi, who skipped Wednesday's Los Angeles debate, said 
that as commissioner he would put a cap on insurer investments in junk bonds. 
He expressed concern that otherwise many companies may collapse, defaulting on 
their claims obligations. 
</P>
<P>
Press announced that he has purchased a position in a Democratic slate to be 
mailed out by political consultant Clint Reilly. And Proposition 103 author 
Harvey Rosenfield, a supporter of Collis, blasted the Berman-D'Agostino 
campaign firm for selling positions on its slates to Garamendi, who he charged 
would, as commissioner, not pursue Proposition 103 rollbacks.

Embattled President Omar Bongo moved tanks and troops around his palace 
Thursday to stop anti-government rioters, and France rushed Foreign Legion 
reinforcements to this former African colony to guard French citizens here. 
</P>
<P>
Rioters set public buildings ablaze and built barricades in Libreville, the 
capital of the oil-rich West African nation, and in the oil city of Port 
Gentil, 80 miles southwest of Libreville on the Atlantic coast. 
</P>
<P>
Police fired into the air to disperse crowds trying to march on the

The riots erupted after opposition leader Joseph Rendjambe was found dead in a 
Libreville hotel room Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Rendjambe's Gabon Progress Party said he was killed by a poison

North Korea's "Great Leader," Kim Il Sung, began a new four-year presidential 
term Thursday, defiantly lauding communism as he kept his iron grip on power. 
</P>
<P>
Kim, now 78 and the world's longest surviving autocratic ruler, quashed 
speculation that after 42 years at the top, he was ready to hand over power to 
his son. 
</P>
<P>
The son, Kim Jong Il, 48, has long been groomed to take over in what would be 
the Communist world's first dynastic succession. The state propaganda organs 
even named a flower after him. 
</P>
<P>
But his father made it clear Thursday that the time is not yet ripe. 
</P>
<P>
With communism crumbling throughout Eastern Europe, Korea watchers said, the 
veteran revolutionary clearly decided that his isolated, reclusive state still 
needs his experienced hand at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
The official Korean Central News Agency, reporting on Thursday's special 
session of the Supreme People's Assembly, said deputies rose as one to hail 
Kim's reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Other KCNA reports showed that Kim Jong Il did move up in the official 
hierarchy, to his first senior state post as vice president of the National 
Defense Commission. His father is the panel's president.

BUSH CHINA MOVE STIRS CAPITOL HILL CRITICS; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: DEMOCRATS AND A SPRINKLING OF REPUBLICANS VOW TO SEEK REVERSAL OF 
TRADE BENEFITS.

<P>
Congressional Democrats and a sprinkling of Republicans denounced President 
Bush's renewal of trade benefits for China on Thursday and vowed to enact 
legislation reversing the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours of Bush's announcement that he plans to extend China's 
most-favored-nation trade status for a year, measures to nullify the action 
were introduced in both Senate and House. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) called the President's 
decision "inconsistent with American values . . . contrary to American 
interests and . . . profoundly wrong." 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you one thing: China is not my most favored nation," said Sen. Alan 
Cranston (D-Calif.), chairman of the Asia subcommittee of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee. He scheduled a June 5 hearing on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Bush's opponents face an uphill battle to muster the necessary 
two-thirds majority in both houses to override the President's certain veto of 
a resolution of disapproval. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the emotional criticism of the President's action, the 
most-favored-nation bill enjoys substantial support among U.S. firms that do 
business with China. Leaders of these companies can be expected to make their 
views known on Capitol Hill before the matter is brought to a vote sometime 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Bush narrowly averted defeat last January when the Senate fell four votes short 
of overturning his veto of legislation protecting Chinese students in the 
United States from deportation. The Senate action came after the House had 
voted overwhelmingly to override the veto. 
</P>
<P>
The President had far less support in the business community for his position 
on the student bill than he enjoys on the most-favored-nation issue. Also, the 
vote on the earlier measure was taken when the memory of the Tian An Men Square 
crackdown was fresher. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the initial reaction on Capitol Hill was overwhelmingly critical. 
Although Democrats were the most numerous, some conservative Republicans, 
including Sens. Alphonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.) and Jake Garn (R-Utah), joined in. 
</P>
<P>
"Sought-after trade concessions should not be given to the butchers of 
Beijing," D'Amato said. "America must have only one standard for human rights. 
MFN for China at this time is a repudiation of everything this country stands 
for: freedom, human rights and democracy." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said that Bush's decision "puts the United 
States on the wrong side of human rights. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Dixon (D-Ill.), co-author with D'Amato of one resolution to reverse 
Bush's decision, told a press conference that the Chinese leadership's record 
on human rights abuses has gotten worse since the Beijing massacre, despite 
Bush's efforts at "appeasement." 
</P>
<P>
"The government of the People's Republic has stepped up persecution of the 
Roman Catholic Church and other groups and has purged or persecuted Chinese 
academics, journalists, police and government officials who expressed any 
support for the democracy movement," Dixon said.

President Bush's assertion Thursday that Taiwan supports an extension of trade 
benefits for China embarrassed Taiwan's Nationalist government, which issued a 
quick denial. 
</P>
<P>
At his press conference, Bush twice said that in the last few weeks, Taiwan has 
been among the Asian governments urging the Administration to continue China's 
most-favored-nation trading status. 
</P>
<P>
"Korea, Japan, Thailand, Singapore, even Taiwan made clear that MFN should be 
retained," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, said Taiwan's government. 
</P>
<P>
Within a few hours, Ding Mou-shih, the head of Taiwan's unofficial embassy 
here, called a press conference to say that he and his government had not in 
any way endorsed the trade benefits for the Communist regime in Beijing.

BUSH VETOES AMTRAK BILL AS STEP BACKWARD

<P>
President Bush on Thursday vetoed a bill authorizing $2 billion in spending by 
Amtrak, complaining that the bill's expansion of federal regulation over 
railroad acquisitions "represents a step backward for the entire rail 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
Bush took issue with a provision that would require the Interstate Commerce 
Commission to approve the acquisition of railroads by non-railroad companies. 
</P>
<P>
"This requirement is an unwarranted regulatory roadblock to the financial 
restructuring of the railroad industry," Bush told Congress in a veto message. 
</P>
<P>
Amtrak spokesman Clifford Black said the veto would have no effect on daily 
train operations because the national rail passenger service is working with 
money that Congress already had appropriated for 1989-1992. 
</P>
<P>
But the veto will indefinitely postpone plans for a commuter line between 
Washington and its Northern Virginia suburbs, Black said. The bill contained 
technical provisions necessary for the project to open. 
</P>
<P>
It was Bush's first veto of 1990. He returned 10 bills to Congress in his first 
year in office. None has been overridden. 
</P>
<P>
The vetoed legislation would have authorized a new, three-year government 
subsidy of $2 billion to Amtrak. Actual spending levels are set by separate 
appropriations bills. 
</P>
<P>
Black said Amtrak supports the provision that prompted Bush's veto, although it 
applies only to private freight railroads. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Amtrak relies on private freight lines for its tracks 
outside the Northeast corridor and "does support ICC oversight of takeovers of 
railroads by non-railroad companies."

STORMS FLOOD FARMLAND IN MIDWEST AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Heavy storms early Thursday drenched the Midwest, where authorities said 
flooding has ruined much of the newly planted corn crop or delayed planting of 
unseeded acreage. 
</P>
<P>
In southern Illinois, White County emergency services officials said they were 
seeking a disaster declaration from Gov. James R. Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
About 80,000 acres of farmland was flooded in the county, preventing spring 
planting. Only 5% of the county's corn crop has been planted, contrasted with 
the yearly average of 85% at this point in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
The Little Wasbash River was at 36.4 feet and thought to be near its crest. The 
flooding was reported to be the third worst this century. About 40 homes have 
been evacuated, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Floodwaters receded along the east fork of the White River in southern Indiana. 
Rivers in the area were 6 to 7 feet above flood stage and some local road 
flooding was reported. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the receding water, nearly 16% of the state's corn crop could be in 
danger, officials said. Last week's heavy rains left more than 2.5 million 
acres of farmland in 50 central and southern Indiana counties so saturated that 
most of the corn planted before the flooding will have to be re-seeded. But 
first the fields must dry. 
</P>
<P>
More than 2 inches of rain fell Wednesday in western Iowa, with Sioux City 
getting hit the hardest, weather officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In southeast Texas, the rain-swollen Trinity River also was beginning to ebb, 
prompting officials to consider the worst of the flooding over as the river 
rushed toward the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, a tornado roared through central Kansas Thursday night, derailing a 
freight train, destroying farm buildings and seriously injuring two people, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Other twisters were sighted in central Kansas and southeastern Wyoming, the 
National Weather Service said. But there were no reports of damage or injuries.

NATIONAL PARK CONCESSIONAIRES BLOCK RELEASE OF FEDERAL AUDIT 
</P>

<P>
National park concessionaires, accused of earning excessive profits at the 
government's expense, have blocked release of a government audit to prevent 
their finances from being made public, a congressional committee said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The audit, a detailed appraisal of problems outlined in an Interior Department 
task force report released in April, was conducted by the agency's inspector 
general and contains specific profit figures for businesses that operate 
concessions in national parks. 
</P>
<P>
A group representing the concessionaires was granted a temporary restraining 
order Wednesday from a federal court in the District of Columbia, preventing 
release of audit information that the concessionaires consider confidential. 
</P>
<P>
A copy of the audit, with the disputed material removed, was released Thursday 
by the House Interior and Insular Affairs subcommittee on national parks and 
public lands. 
</P>
<P>
"These findings seem to paint a picture of sweetheart deals, whether intended 
as such or not, resulting in excess profits at taxpayer expense," said Rep. 
Bruce F. Vento (D-Minn.), chairman of the subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 private firms operate concessions in 355 national parks, many 
holding several contracts. They range from small food stands to large 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
The April task force report criticized current government policies, such as 
giving concessionaires preferential rights to renew their contracts, granting 
contracts for as long as 30 years and reducing fees in return for physical 
improvements to concession property. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing 45 of the 500 concession contracts in force, the auditors 
concluded that "the U.S. Treasury did not receive adequate fees from the larger 
concessioners in the national parks," Inspector General James R. Richards told 
the subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Richards said that while the concessions generated gross receipts of $500 
million in 1988, the National Park Service received only $12.5 million in 
franchise fees, or about 2.5% of the concession revenues. 
</P>
<P>
But Phyllis O'Connell, secretary of the Conference of Park Concessioners, told 
the subcommittee that the audit was conducted "in relative isolation from many 
facts needed for full evaluation."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE AD CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Elements of the advertisement with an analysis by Times political writer 
John Balzar 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The race: Governor. Whose ads? Democratic candidates Dianne Feinstein and John 
K. Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein, the confident front-runner, is showing signs of looking beyond the 
June 5 primary to the November general election with a new 30-second commercial 
that emphasizes several elements of her record as mayor of San Francisco from 
1978 to 1987. As is often the case in compressed television spots, the ad 
raises several points that might be debatable. The commercial begins airing 
immediately and will run statewide, the campaign said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elements of the advertisement with an analysis by Times political writer John 
Balzar: 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "Oct. 17, 1989. World Series, Game 3. A day no Californian can forget. But 
because of one woman's foresight and common sense, a reinforced Candlestick 
Park protected thousands when the quake hit." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: There were many competing priorities in San Francisco at the time, 
but earthquakes hold a special terror. So when the Department of Public Works 
warned her of structural danger at the ballpark, she authorized a $150,000 
temporary shoring up of the stadium's overhanging lip. Later, as part of a 
$27-million rehabilitation, including the addition of luxury boxes and 
additional seats, the stadium was permanently reinforced. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "Her innovative plan built and financed affordable housing. She started the 
Youth Conservation Corps to train disadvantaged youth. (She saved) the cable 
cars." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Criticized for supporting the San Francisco high-rise boom, 
Feinstein's housing program required developers to contribute to housing as a 
condition for building. She claims that 5,000 units of housing have been built 
or rehabilitated at a cost of $35 million since the program began in 1981. 
Still, a 1989 report by the city found that only 5% of families could afford a 
median-priced home in San Francisco. The youth corps was started in 1984, after 
the establishment of a similar program by the state. Finally, with an energetic 
fund-raising effort, Feinstein was a leader in helping renovate the city's 
picturesque 109-year-old cable car system. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "And (she) signed the law making San Francisco the first major city to 
divest from South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: This is the most controversial claim in the ad. Feinstein signed a 
resolution calling for pension fund divestiture in 1985 and signed a stronger 
city divestiture ordinance in February, 1986. Van de Kamp's campaign says the 
advertising claim is distorted and overblown. She signed the ordinance, yes, 
but opposed it every step of the way through the Board of Supervisors and acted 
only under threat of a veto override and citizen initiative, the Van de Kamp 
campaign says. Moreover, her opponent continued, Feinstein successfully lobbied 
on behalf of the locally headquartered Bank of America for an exemption so the 
bank could continue to conduct business in both South Africa and with the city 
of San Francisco. Finally, 36 cities (including Los Angeles) and 11 states 
passed divestment laws before San Francsico, according to news accounts at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: At the end of the ad, Feinstein takes aim at Republican Pete Wilson. "She's 
the only candidate for governor, Democrat or Republican, with a plan to manage 
growth." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Feinstein has proposed a new state commission to plan for population 
growth. She says it would be modeled after the state Coastal Commission, 
empowered to draw up regional growth plans and force adherence by cities and 
counties. Feinstein says new growth can be accommodated by directing it to 
those areas that want it. She mentions Chico as an example, although the 
controlled-growth movement is well entrenched in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Underdog Van de Kamp, unable to move ahead in the polls or recapture a sense of 
momentum, seems to be looking ahead, as well -- perhaps to how he will be 
remembered in the future. Rather than going on the attack as some had 
predicted, Van de Kamp previewed for statewide airing a soft, inspirational 
homily about his support for the environmentalist "Big Green" ballot initiative 
that will face voters in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad is narrated by Van de Kamp against a changing backdrop of forest, farm 
and waterfalls, with him holding a child in his arms and speaking to 
supporters: 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "And the big Green initiative for which I am fighting will change the face 
of California forever. To protect the coastline. . . . To reforest our land. . 
. . To outlaw cancer-causing pesticides. . . . And to phase out products 
threatening the ozone layer essential to life on Earth. . . . And someday, when 
our peaceful war to save the world is finally won, let it be said the tide was 
turned here, this year, in this special state, California."

JUDGE DENIES MONTOYA REQUEST TO STAY FREE DURING APPEAL 
</P>

<P>
A federal district court judge refused Thursday to allow former state Sen. 
Joseph B. Montoya to stay out of prison while appealing his conviction on 
political corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
But Judge Milton L. Schwartz said he would consider delaying the Whittier 
Democrat's scheduled June 29 prison reporting date to give an appeals court 
time to decide whether Montoya should remain free pending appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with challenges to rulings he made while presiding over Montoya's trial 
four months ago, Schwartz declared: "I would rule the same way on those 
questions today. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
He said he saw "no justification" for allowing the ex-lawmaker to remain free 
while a higher court reviews Montoya's appeal, but he acknowledged that the 
appeals court itself might decide otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya did not appear in court. His attorney, Michael S. Sands, said that 
neither he nor another Montoya defense attorney, Bruce Kelton, would be 
representing Montoya in his appeal. "We don't do appeals," Sands said later. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya was found guilty of seven counts of extortion, racketeering and 
money-laundering to become the first state legislator convicted of felony 
corruption in 35 years. Facing likely expulsion from the Senate, Montoya 
resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Schwartz sentenced Montoya to 6 1/2 years in prison. The judge said 
he would recommend that Montoya serve his time at the minimum-security Lompoc 
Federal Penitentiary. Prosecutors have estimated that, under federal sentencing 
laws, Montoya will serve at least 5 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
In arguing for a delay in Montoya's imprisonment, Sands said that a number of 
Schwartz's rulings during the trial could be overturned on appeal, resulting in 
a reversal of the conviction. For example, Schwartz -- over the objections of 
Montoya's attorneys -- allowed the jury to hear a tape in which Sen. Alan 
Robbins (D-Tarzana) told an FBI informant that he would "need to make some 
arrangements with Joe" to assure Montoya's support for a special-interest bill. 
Asked by the informant what was required for Montoya, Robbins says on the tape, 
". . . a little envelope" and later "I would say about three ($3,000) would be 
sufficient." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said that even if Schwartz erred in admitting the tape, the 
conviction would stand.

A motorcyclist was killed and his companion was seriously injured Thursday when 
their motorcycle apparently hit an undetonated bomb that exploded in a 
restricted military area about 20 miles northeast of Niland in Imperial County. 
</P>

A spokesman for the Marine Corps Air Station in Yuma, Ariz., said the two 
unidentified men were near Surveyors Pass in the Chocolate Mountain Bombing 
Range -- used by Navy fighter pilots for practice missions. The spokesman, 
however, had no information on the type of munition involved.

SCIENCE FAIR'S WHITE MICE GIVE WAY TO COMPUTER-AGE SOPHISTICATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
David Liu, one of more than 580 competitors in the annual California State 
Science Fair for high school students, exuded confidence Thursday as a judge 
approached his display in Exposition Park's Armory Building. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a double-breasted suit, white shirt and red "power tie" adorned with 
a gold tie chain, Liu looked more like a natty corporate executive than a 
16-year-old high school student from Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Picking up his pointer, he sped impatiently through his project: a neural 
network computer model of multistage visual processing. Suddenly he stopped. 
"Do you know enough about neural networks so I can skip this part?" he asked 
the judge. 
</P>
<P>
Taken aback, the judge only nodded but later murmured to the youth, "Ah, yes, 
you know it all." 
</P>
<P>
Attitude, and plenty of it, characterized this year's Science Fair. 
</P>
<P>
The "traditional experiments," in which plants or insects are administered a 
chemical and results are recorded, were few in number at this year's 
competition, said Christopher Gould, a fair judge for the last eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the event attracted students puzzling over sophisticated DNA and RNA 
projects, high schoolers with years invested in their projects, those breaking 
new ground in computer research and students working in partnership with 
university and industrial researchers. 
</P>
<P>
Teen-agers tossed esoteric math terms like "algorithmic" and "fractals" around 
with ease. Others revealed their scientific passion as they eagerly opened 
charts and graphs. Still others talked of skipping their final year of high 
school and zipping ahead to college. 
</P>
<P>
"On average, the projects are of a higher quality; there are more of the really 
good projects," said Gould, an associate professor of physics at the USC. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, we used to have a lot of bathtub-ducky projects, and we're not seeing 
that," agreed Evan Nosoff, a spokesman for the California Museum of Science and 
Industry. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for the improvement was a drive by the California Museum 
Foundation to upgrade the 38-year-old event. The amount of prize money has been 
increased from $10,000 to $40,000, Nosoff said, and the fair was promoted more 
heavily. 
</P>
<P>
The competitors come from 22 regional science fairs. A team of 260 judges 
selects the final 26 winners and the Science Student of the Year, who receives 
a top prize of $5,000. This year's winner was Liu, whose project blended 
computer science, psychology and biology, the judges said. 
</P>
<P>
"The work done here is comparable to three projects," the judges said of Liu's 
work, which created a computer model of the way the human brain functions when 
an individual looks at an image. 
</P>
<P>
But Liu had stiff competition from 17-year-old David Harris of Ridgecrest in 
the Mojave Desert, whose entry was his own computer game and language, 
"Robowar." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Harris' voice had been reduced to a hoarse whisper as he struggled 
to explain the game to yet another interested viewer. Under a set of 
complicated rules devised by Harris, robots are created with physical 
characteristics and liabilities. They then engage in wars. 
</P>
<P>
The game has been picked up by a group of his friends and a physicist at the 
Naval Weapons Center in China Lake, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're on the seventh generation of robots," he said, adding that the robots 
have names like Blade, Freud and his own, Aeneas III. 
</P>
<P>
Another top competitor was Allen Harker, 17, of Solana Beach, who spent 6 1/2 
years studying beach erosion along a quarter-mile section near his home. 
</P>
<P>
Harker began the project in sixth grade and said he kept at it because "a 
number of incredible events just kept occurring in my study area." 
</P>
<P>
Those events included cliff failures, construction of a seawall, and 
destructive winter storms. 
</P>
<P>
Even after years on his project, the blond body surfer was still enthusiastic 
as he explained how waves carry fist-size rocks from the mountains to the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just amazing that the power of water can transport rocks all that 
distance," he beamed.

BOY DROWNED AFTER DIVING, SCHOOL SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
TRAGEDY: OFFICIALS SAY 14-YEAR-OLD JUMPED INTO POOL DESPITE BEING A NOVICE 
SWIMMER. HIS PARENTS QUESTION THAT ACCOUNT.

<P>
A 14-year-old boy who drowned during his swimming class at a Long Beach high 
school this week jumped off the diving board into the pool after challenging 
another student to do the same, school officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan High School Principal Alta Cooke described the drowning of ninth-grader 
Ryan Hardison as "a freak accident, a very unfortunate freak accident" that 
should not be blamed on the lifeguard and instructors supervising the pool. 
</P>
<P>
"We had our lifeguard there and two teachers," Cooke said. "Nothing would be 
done differently. We were following district policy. We were not negligent." 
</P>
<P>
But James and Loretta Hardison, Ryan's parents, disputed the school's version 
of how their son ended up on the bottom of the school's swimming pool 
Wednesday, unnoticed by his classmates and instructor. 
</P>
<P>
"Off the diving board. Off the diving board?" his father asked incredulously 
Thursday. "No way." 
</P>
<P>
James Hardison said that his son, an ROTC cadet, did not know how to swim, had 
a fear of the water and had talked to his instructor, ROTC 1st Sgt. Nick 
Church, about his apprehension. Church assured the teen-ager he would teach him 
how to swim, Ryan's father reported his son as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan was spotted at the bottom of the pool Wednesday at 11:15 a.m. by the 
school's lifeguard, Mike Quigley, who pulled him out and tried to resuscitate 
him. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to determine exactly what led to the drowning, school officials 
on Thursday asked 23 students "to write down what they saw -- not what they 
heard, or thought had happened, but what they saw," said Vice Principal Bob 
Evans. 
</P>
<P>
Evans said that one student wrote, "I saw Ryan went off the diving board. When 
he jumped, before he entered the water, he acted kind of wild. I thought he 
could swim." 
</P>
<P>
Another student, Eric Pribish, told The Times that, earlier that morning, Ryan 
tried to persuade a classmate "to go off the diving board. (The classmate) told 
him that he was stupid because they couldn't swim." 
</P>
<P>
Although James and Loretta Hardison had said earlier that they heard stories 
from some students that Ryan was either pushed into the pool or forced to jump 
in, none of the nearly two dozen students wrote that in their accounts, Evans 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Two students said in interviews with The Times that Quigley sometimes turned 
his attention away from the pool to read a magazine. ROTC ninth-grader Karimah 
Saleem said she observed the lifeguard reading before Ryan drowned. 
</P>
<P>
J. D. Manning, who was in a ninth-grade swimming class the period before the 
incident, said, "He does that all the time." 
</P>
<P>
School officials disputed those reports and said the lifeguard, who declined to 
be interviewed, supervised the students at all times. 
</P>
<P>
Karimah Saleem said that, before to the drowning, Church yelled at Ryan to "get 
your goddamned ass in the pool" when the boy left the shallow end to get 
towels. Karimah did not specify whether Church meant the 3- to 4-foot shallow 
end or the deeper end, with depths up to 12 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Church, who was not in school Thursday, could not be reached for comment and 
was said to be distraught. But Lt. Col. William Waterman, the senior ROTC 
instructor at the school, said Karimah's account of Church's remark "doesn't 
sound like him." 
</P>
<P>
Waterman said Church told him he was encouraging to the boy when he saw him 
practicing swimming in the shallow end. " 'Hey, you're doing it,' " Church told 
Ryan, according to Waterman. 
</P>
<P>
Principal Cooke said she would like to interview this student and any others 
who may have overheard Church telling Ryan to get back in the pool. "This 
gentleman loves his kids and he would not force them to do anything," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying he's not a macho guy, because we like to think of our ROTC 
(members that way). But he's a very caring man," she said. "That is not his 
attitude. I can vouch for that." 
</P>
<P>
Waterman said the purpose of the ROTC program at Jordan High is to teach 
leadership, raise self-esteem and "instill in young people a respect for their 
heritage as American citizens." It is highly structured but is not viewed as a 
source of military recruits, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach police said they are conducting a routine investigation of the 
death, but the case "appears to be a drowning," said Detective Logan Wren. 
School officials are compiling a report for the Long Beach Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
"After we read the report, depending upon what we find, if there have to be 
changes, then we'll send it to the appropriate office," said Supt. Tom Giugni. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the flag flew at half-staff Thursday, and saddened cadets sat 
outside the ROTC office consoling each other. The indoor pool was closed and 
swimming classes were canceled. Counselors and psychologists addressed groups 
of students, many of whom said they were angry and depressed by what happened. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of anger, a lot of guilt. They wonder, 'What could I have done,' 
" Jordan counselor Lynne Fielding said. "Some are still in denial." 
</P>
<P>
"He was well-liked by his classmates," Waterman said. "They're very upset. 
They're like most young people. They're asking 'why?' "

DRUGS: A DEA INTELLIGENCE DOCUMENT TELLS HOW A RECORD 21-TON HAUL SEIZED LAST 
FALL WAS BROUGHT ACROSS THE BORDER IN THE TRUNKS OF CARS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The record 21 tons of cocaine seized at a San Fernando Valley warehouse last 
fall was smuggled across the U.S.-Mexico border at El Paso, 650 pounds at a 
time in the trunks of Mercury Marquis automobiles, according to an intelligence 
report obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
After being stockpiled in the Texas border town, the cocaine was then shipped 
to Los Angeles in refrigerated big rigs in massive loads of several tons each, 
according to the Drug Enforcement Administration document. 
</P>
<P>
The authoritative account differs sharply from previous reports, in which 
investigators theorized that the Mexican operatives who masterminded the 
operation evaded U.S. border guards by hiding their cocaine in hard-to-search 
commercial vehicles or dividing it among human "mules" who crossed into the 
United States illegally. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the DEA report indicates, the cocaine brought into the United States 
by the mammoth smuggling operation was simply driven on hundreds of occasions 
directly past U.S. Customs agents, from whom it was shielded only by the steel 
lid of a Ford Motors trunk. 
</P>
<P>
The document makes no criticism of Customs' actions in the case, but a recent 
General Accounting Office report faulted the agency for relying on a computer 
database incapable of providing border agents with adequate warnings against 
suspicious individuals or vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an increased risk that known or suspected law violators may enter the 
United States undetected," the GAO report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The new details about the smuggling operation from Colombia to a Sylmar 
warehouse were contained in a report warning of Mexico's increasing role as a 
transit point for U.S.-bound cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
The report by the DEA's Office of Intelligence asserts that the cocaine had 
been flown into Mexico near Juarez by Colombian trafficking organizations and 
was to be delivered from Los Angeles to Colombian distributors in Southern 
California, New York and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
In a pattern that has come to be typical, it said the cross-border smuggling 
was "facilitated" by Mexican organizations operating as key middlemen. 
</P>
<P>
The report indicated that the 21 tons recovered in Los Angeles last Sept. 28 
and an additional 60 tons that had passed through the warehouse in the previous 
six months had been concealed "in the trunks of cars (usually Mercury 
Marquises) in quantities of roughly 300 kilograms per shipment and driven 
across the border." 
</P>
<P>
Hector Tapia Anchondo, the alleged ringleader, and six others have been 
arrested in connection with the smuggling inquiry. DEA spokesman Bill 
Ruzzamenti said that the agency could not comment on the intelligence report 
because the case has not yet come to trial. 
</P>
<P>
The document, dated February, 1990, and marked "DEA-sensitive," also provides 
new details about a wide range of other smuggling methods used to ferry cocaine 
into the United States in a number of huge shipments seized by American 
authorities last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Most surprisingly, the intelligence report asserts that the nearly five tons of 
cocaine seized last October in a Harlingen, Tex., stash house had crossed into 
the United States by small rafts floated across the Rio Grande River at 
Bluetown, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
The report describes land smuggling as "the current method of choice" and warns 
that "the cocaine threat at the U.S.-Mexico border is complex and 
multifaceted." The document was drafted before the discovery last week of a 
273-foot underground tunnel used to smuggle cocaine from Mexico into Douglas, 
Ariz.

HISTORIC GROUP'S OCTAGON HOUSE RESTORATION STALLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Just off the Pasadena Freeway north of downtown, in sharp contrast to the tidy, 
historic village around it, an eight-sided house sits on wood and steel 
supports, four years after it was moved there to be refurbished and displayed. 
</P>
<P>
Time has not been kind to the Octagon House at Heritage Square Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Its paint is peeling. A window has cracked. A sash hangs open. 
</P>
<P>
Family disputes surely transpired under the home's cupola in the 93 years that 
it housed descendants of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. But it seems unlikely that 
the Octagon House has seen such mayhem as the paper work war that has been 
waged since its controversial move from Pasadena to Heritage Square in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Heritage Square officials say the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety 
has lost two sets of their construction plans, erroneously charged them fees 
and then refused to allow them to build a foundation on fill dirt they believe 
is adequate to support the Octagon House. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't restore it until we can get it down, and we've gone through hell with 
the city trying to get the permits to do that," said Mitzi March Mogul, the 
museum's development director. "It's just been a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Museum officials are hopeful, however, that the logjam of bureaucratic 
obstacles to the project may soon loosen. A meeting this week among Heritage 
Square representatives and the city's chief of grading, Jerry Takaki, produced 
a promise from Takaki that he will seek a variance so work on the foundation 
may soon begin. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll get it off the dime," he said, "but it may take a couple of 
weeks." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the future of the Octagon House is a nagging question revived 
every weekend by visitors to the living-history museum. Sadly out of place, the 
rundown Octagon House sits on its perch while costumed guides lead such 
Victorian-era festivities around it as an old-fashioned baby parade and a 
Mother's Day fashion show. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounding the Octagon House are a handful of meticulously restored historic 
homes. Next door is the John J. Ford House, the 1887 residence of an 
accomplished wood carver who spent years whittling ornate beams and banisters 
throughout the house. Across the street, visitors wander into the Hale House, 
also built in 1887 during Southern California's post-Civil War construction 
boom. 
</P>
<P>
The Octagon House, a rare example of an avant-garde form of architecture for 
the time, would be a perfect complement to the other Heritage Square homes, 
museum officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd love to be able to get people into the Octagon House to see it," Mogul 
said. "We want to integrate it into the historic interpretations we do here, 
and make it into a living, breathing house again." 
</P>
<P>
As it stands, "We can't get into it to do even the most basic maintenance, 
never mind restoration," Mogul said. 
</P>
<P>
The years of delays have taken a financial toll on the plans for the Octagon 
House, Mogul said. The original contractor lost interest and abandoned the 
project, and costs to prepare the home's foundation have risen an estimated 
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Readying Octagon House for public viewing may ultimately cost $200,000, but 
Heritage Square officials have only "$18,000 and some change" remaining in an 
original budget of $114,500, Mogul said. Fund raising is difficult when the 
home's future is in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
The senior city inspector on the Octagon House, Joe Gras, said he cannot 
explain how the city lost two sets of building plans for the house. But he said 
the current delay, stemming from a dispute over soil safety, is not the city's 
fault. 
</P>
<P>
Museum executives believe that decades ago, crews prepared the soil underlying 
Heritage Square Park to support houses. But they have been unable to prove it 
with documentation, as the city required before a foundation could be built for 
the 1893 treasure. 
</P>
<P>
The Octagon House was designed in a tradition spurred by Orson S. Fowler, a 
utopian philosopher of sorts who argued in an 1848 book that an eight-sided 
house would bring light and air into every room. 
</P>
<P>
It was built by Gilbert Longfellow, a cousin of the poet, near the California 
Institute of Technology. The house was moved in 1917 to Allen Street in 
Pasadena. It is the only remaining octagonal house in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Heritage Square's parent organization, the nonprofit Cultural Heritage 
Foundation of Southern California, 20 years ago helped Walter Hastings, a 
Longfellow descendant, restore the old house when he was ordered to make 
substantial improvements to meet city codes. 
</P>
<P>
In turn, Hastings promised the house to the foundation, and years later he kept 
his vow. When Hastings moved to Stockton in August, 1986, building movers 
lifted the roof and cupola off and took the Octagon House, piece by piece, to 
Heritage Square. 
</P>
<P>
Hastings died last month, his house still on blocks at Heritage Square. 
</P>
<P>
While Heritage Square Executive Director Barry Herlihy admits that "some of it 
is probably our own damned fault," he is irate about the years that have passed 
since the summer of 1986, when the first set of permit applications were 
submitted to the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
At first, a permit was delayed for months while the city checked construction 
plans, Herlihy said. Then, when Heritage Square applied for an exemption from 
various permit fees because of the home's historic value, the city lost the 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, Herlihy said, the city charged Heritage Square the fees when they 
resubmitted their plans. And another set of plans was lost the following year, 
Herlihy said. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I thought they were out to get us," he said. "At this point, I don't 
think it is animosity. A lot of stupidity, maybe, but no animosity." 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety, no central file can be 
found that tracks the Heritage Square project from the filing of the first 
permit, said Mike Lee, an inspector for the Bureau of Community Safety. 
</P>
<P>
Lee acknowledged that $1,311.72 in fees were incorrectly assessed to Heritage 
Square, first in 1986 and then last year. The money was refunded last April, 
Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the issues of the fees and lost plans, the project remains stalled by 
concern about the land where Octagon House will sit. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the ground under Heritage Square is fill dirt dumped there from an 
adjoining arroyo and from Bunker Hill. Houses can be placed on fill, but it 
must first be compacted and approved by city inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
Heritage Square officials always felt sure the soil was compacted, because two 
other historic houses at the site were placed on city-approved foundations in 
the 1970s and neither has settled. 
</P>
<P>
Gras conceded that the worst that could happen if the soil was not compacted 
enough would be that the Octagon House's windows and doors might not close 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to topple over," Gras said. 
</P>
<P>
For now, Heritage Square officials are hoping for a successful search for 
records to support city soils engineer Burr E. Peck's recollection that, 20 
years ago, the soil at Heritage Square was compacted under his supervision. 
Peck came forward with the information last week and assured Takaki at this 
week's meeting that the soil had indeed been prepared. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just saying, 'Let's get on with it, folks,' " Herlihy said.

BEATINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A black former inmate of a Saugus jail filed a civil rights lawsuit Thursday 
against the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department alleging that he was beaten 
by deputies who he said are members of a white supremacist group. 
</P>
<P>
Clydell Crawford, 26, of West Covina alleged that he was beaten and his leg 
broken on Dec. 2 while he was an inmate at the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho. 
</P>
<P>
He said the six to eight deputies who allegedly beat him after removing him 
from a medium-security dormitory were members of the Wayside Whities, a large 
group of jailers who he said take their name from the jail's former name, 
Wayside Honor Rancho. 
</P>
<P>
A sheriff's spokesman declined to comment on the allegations by Crawford and 
other inmates or to comment on whether such a group exists. But he said the 
alleged beating incident was under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The suit seeks more than $1 million in damages.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 5 SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES STRICKEN BY DIZZINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies, mysteriously stricken by nausea and 
dizziness during a routine traffic stop in Carson, were released Thursday from 
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, where tests failed to explain the illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies took ill about 11 p.m. Wednesday after stopping a suspected drunk 
driver near the intersection of Alameda and Dominguez streets, according to a 
sheriff's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The officers became too ill to cite the driver or even make their own way to a 
hospital, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
After the deputies were taken by paramedics to the hospital, county fire and 
health investigators speculated that the illnesses were caused by gas from a 
railroad tanker car near the intersection. However, no official explanation was 
given for the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what caused it," said county Fire Capt. Roger Sorenson. "You 
could speculate all you want about the cause, with all the industry in Carson. 
But it's all unexplained so far."

<P>
The Los Angeles City Fire Department held its 47th annual Memorial Day service 
Thursday on the South Lawn of City Hall in honor of firefighters who have died 
in the line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was at the Cenotaph, a permanent memorial built in 1944, and was 
attended by friends and families of the victims as well as representatives from 
other fire departments and city agencies, including City Fire Chief Donald O. 
Manning and County Fire Chief P. Michael Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
With bagpipes playing in the background, the names of 48 firefighters who died 
in the line of duty from 1906 to 1984 were read. 
</P>
<P>
Manning noted that no firefighters have died in the line of duty since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
After a prayer, representatives of 15 departmental organizations placed wreaths 
at the base of the monument and widows placed red roses. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's ceremony culminated with three Fire Department helicopters flying in 
a "missing man" formation as a bugler played Taps.

BOMB THREATS, VANDALISM AT SYNAGOGUE INVESTIGATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police are investigating recent bomb threats and vandalism at a 
synagogue in Tujunga as hate incidents, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Swastikas about four feet square were etched into the doors of the Verdugo 
Hills Hebrew Center on May 12, said Detective Gaspar Oliveras. Anti-Semitic 
slurs were scrawled on signs and brass plaques at the temple's entrance that 
same day, police said. 
</P>
<P>
On May 11 and again on May 16, bomb threats were telephoned to the temple, 
which serves about 85 families, Oliveras said. He said that the vandals may 
have been inspired by desecration of Jewish graves in a cemetery in southern 
France in early May, which received widespread media attention, and a wave of 
other anti-Semitic incidents in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Police have no suspects, but Neo-Nazi skinhead youth groups are believed to be 
responsible, Oliveras said. 
</P>
<P>
The firebomb caused about $8,000 damage, Oliveras said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the center is the only synagogue in the area, making it a 
convenient target for anti-Semitic crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't call them hate crimes; hate is not a crime," Oliveras said. "They are 
hate incidents." However, he said they are an ongoing problem in the Police 
Department's Foothill Division, especially in the Sunland-Tujunga and Sylmar 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
The center's president, who asked that his name not be used, said temple 
officials had tried to keep the incidents out of the news. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want publicity," he said. "We're trying to keep a low profile." 
</P>
<P>
A woman who answered the phone at the temple said synagogue members fear they 
will be harassed or harmed at their homes if the incidents are publicized. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that we have a lot of copycat crimes when incidents like this 
get a lot of publicity," Oliveras said. Other recent incidents of hate crimes 
have included an attempted cross-burning at the home of a black family in 
nearby La Crescenta in February, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Krasn, a spokeswoman for the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, 
agreed that some people fear copycat crimes, but added: "It's very important to 
confront each hate crime so that it can be fully investigated by police. 
</P>
<P>
Krasn said hate crimes nationwide are becoming more frequent. A recent 
Anti-Defamation League audit found anti-Semitic incidents in the United States 
during 1989 rose to their highest level in at least 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
The county Human Relations Commission listed 167 racially motivated hate crimes 
last year, a 75% increase over 1988.

EX-INMATE SUES, ACCUSING GROUP OF WHITE JAILERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A black former inmate of a Saugus jail filed a civil rights lawsuit Thursday 
against the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department alleging that he was beaten 
by deputies who he said are members of a white supremacist group known as the 
Wayside Whities. 
</P>
<P>
Clydell Crawford alleged that he was beaten and his leg was broken on Dec. 2 
while he was an inmate at the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho. 
</P>
<P>
He said the six to eight deputies who allegedly beat him after removing him 
from a medium-security dormitory were members of the Wayside Whities, a large 
group of jailers who he said take their name from the jail's former name, 
Wayside Honor Rancho. 
</P>
<P>
A sheriff's spokesman declined to comment on the allegations made by Crawford 
and other inmates or to comment on whether such a group exists. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that deputies in the group are involved in racially motivated 
intimidation and attacks on black inmates. The deputies exchange hand signals 
in which their fingers form the letter W, according to the lawsuit filed in 
U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed against Sheriff Sherman Block and 12 deputies assigned to 
the jail and seeks more than $1 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Thursday, Crawford and his attorney, George V. Denny, 
released statements from three other inmates who said they saw the beating, 
which allegedly followed a fight between Crawford and a white inmate. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff's spokesman said the incident was under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"A complete and thorough investigation is being conducted into the incident," 
Deputy Hal Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford, 26, of West Covina, said the alleged beating occurred while he was 
serving six weeks at the Pitchess Honor Rancho for violating his probation for 
an earlier cocaine sales conviction.

African-American and Asian parentage, lives and writes in Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
<P>
Two blocks from my home in the West Adams District of Los Angeles is a small 
neighborhood market. It is owned by a family of Korean immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent trip to the store, I noticed that the proprietors had installed a 
bullet-proof plastic barrier that shielded them from their clientele. I asked 
whether or not they had been robbed, and they responded negatively, saying that 
the protective cage was a preventive measure. 
</P>
<P>
I also witnessed the displeasure of some of the predominantly African-American 
clientele to the merchants' decision. Several reacted with impatience and 
verbal hostility when the merchants took longer than usual to bag their 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the Flatbush section of New York, a simmering feud continues 
between African-American residents and the Korean owners of two neighborhood 
markets. Coincidence? Or are these inter-ethnic rivalries the inevitable result 
of social-cultural design? To the extent that these disparate events are 
similar in origin, they may suggest both the causes and the solutions to such 
hostile relations. 
</P>
<P>
In both instances, African-American residents view with resentment, the 
invasion of their neighborhoods by outside merchants. This intrusion is like 
rubbing salt into the wounds caused by generations of economic impotence and 
despair. By any measure, the economic status of America's ethnic-minority in 
ner cities has worsened during the 1980s. In many buyer-seller relations, 
suspicions occur naturally: sellers suspect buyers of theft; buyers suspect 
sellers of overpricing policies. But when the sellers are immigrant Koreans, 
and the buyers are African-American urban dwellers, additional suspicions 
pervade the relationship, including longstanding racial biases that infect 
attitudes and behavior.The ideology of white supremacy (the cornerstone of 
which is black inferiority), is evident throughout the world. The continuing 
portrayal of African-Americans in the media as criminally inclined or 
pathological reinforce these pre-existing biases. Unfortunately, the kernel of 
truth in these biases imbues them with a false sense of validity. 
</P>
<P>
It is true that African-Americans are over-represented among the poor, the 
violent and the criminal. Less obvious are the objective life circumstances 
that produce these symptoms of pathology. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, anti-Asian prejudice is a reality that must be acknowledged. As 
Americans, we were taught to distrust Asians through motion pictures about 
World War II and through other portrayals that dehumanized Asians. American 
biases against those who do not speak English well impede the formation of 
harmonious relationships with first-generation immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
These ideological underpinnings of the contemporary conflict between 
African-Americans and Korean immigrants result in justification for 
inter-ethnic scapegoating. Anti-black prejudice is widespread; anti-Asian bias 
is a reality in the African-American community. 
</P>
<P>
With their long history, solutions to these issues will potentially involve 
generations of conscious and deliberate action. 
</P>
<P>
First, we must re-socialize ourselves regarding racial differences. Instead of 
amplifying them, we should recognize that the concept of race is a political 
invention with little or no scientific basis. 
</P>
<P>
We must recognize that the current plight of African-Americans is not of their 
making, but the product of centuries of de jure discrimination. We must learn 
that our attitudes toward Asians are largely the result of superficial 
portrayals. 
</P>
<P>
Second, we must learn that cultural differences are a valuable resource. All 
groups have unique cultural histories and characteristics that are of value to 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Koreans display a laudatory collective spirit of economic cooperation. It is 
not so much that wealthy Koreans are "invading" African-American communities as 
it is that Korean immigrant families are pooling their comparatively meager 
resources to purchase businesses in economically distressed areas. 
</P>
<P>
African-Americans have shown the world a certain moral consciousness, notably 
exhibited by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Other blacks also contributed to the 
development of modern civilization by the invention -- in antiquity -- of 
written script, mathematics, politics and architecture. Thus, anti-black biases 
are unfounded, and the same is true of anti-Asian biases. 
</P>
<P>
We must learn to nourish our ethnic, racial and cultural differences. They 
illuminate both the diversity and the commonality within our species. 
</P>
<P>
A remedy to the current Korean-African-American conflicts must be found. A 
recognition of the shaping of public opinion by popular media (such as motion 
pictures), alleviating economic anomie and a recognition of each group's 
contribution to modern society, are beginning steps toward this positive 
resolution.

The California Wine Commission, the major marketing tool of the state's 
$6-billion wine industry, has voted itself out of existence, the Department of 
Food and Agriculture reported. 
</P>
<P>
The vote announced Thursday was 125 to 111. 
</P>

Smaller wineries protested that the commission dictated overall industry policy 
even though members represented only 11% of the more than 700 wineries in the 
state. Only those wineries that crush more than 100 tons of grapes a season 
were eligible to vote on industry matters. 
</P>
<P>
The immediate effect of the commission's demise could be a cutoff of about $6 
million a year for the Wine Institute, a private trade organization of the 
industry.

Humor is probably the least-encountered element in contemporary music. It is 
difficult to pinpoint just when humor fell out of fashion, but in the 18th 
Century and early 19th Century, respectable composers turned out comic operas 
by the dozen. Even in the purely instrumental genres, Mozart's "Musical Joke" 
and Haydn's "Surprise" Symphony are but two examples of the playful attitude 
towards musical convention. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, it is no mere coincidence that the interchangeable vernacular 
term for contemporary classical music is "serious" music. Just try to imagine 
an opera buffa by Alban Berg, Elliott Carter or Pierre Boulez. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday evening at UC San Diego's Mandeville Auditorium, the contemporary 
music ensemble SONOR provided a welcome relief from new music's earnest pall 
with Anthony Korf's song cycle "Nothing but Love Songs." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, SONOR opened its final concert of the season with Michael 
Gandolfi's dour, ascetic nonet "Personae" and finished the evening with 
Karlheinz Stockhausen's "Kontra-Punkte," the quintessential 1950s icon of 
acerbic cerebral pointillism. But Korf's lively opus for soprano and small 
chamber orchestra displayed a winning, humorous countenance, from the 
instruments' unabashed flirting with pop styles to the vocal soloist's ironic 
intoning of seven amatory poems by Thomas Hardy, William Butler Yeats, John 
Hollander and Amy Lowell. 
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old New York composer demonstrated that, with sufficient vision, 
consonances can be used playfully and unpredictably to excellent effect. 
</P>
<P>
Soprano Carol Plantamura, who eloquently sang Arnold Schoenberg's "Pierrot 
Lunaire" with SONOR earlier this season, savored Korf's witty vocal line with 
sophisticated, articulate declamation -- she is the Maria Callas of 
Sprechstimme. Guest conductor Keith Humble, who evidently relished the 
composer's humor with equal conviction, kept the work's delicate, precise 
instrumental textures in pristine alignment. 
</P>
<P>
Drake Mabry's "11.10.83" for solo clarinet proved to be a tour de force that 
elicited knowing smiles -- it satirized all those vapid, flashy clarinet 
showpieces -- as well as admiration for the soloist's virtuosity. Clarinetist 
Michael Richards, for whom the piece was written, had the supple technique and 
sang-froid to sail through its athletic jumps and staccato iterations. In the 
middle section, he delicately conjured its eerie multiphonics. 
</P>
<P>
"Sum over Histories," a recently completed chamber piece by UCSD graduate 
composer John Stevens, reconstructed works of J. S. Bach, Beethoven and Webern 
according to Stevens' mathematical formulas. The result was a fragmented 
dismembering that stirred in this listener the desire to hear the originals 
again, preferably before Stevens' work ground to its conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
New York pianist Aleck Karis brought his authoritative technique to the 
keyboard solo in Stockhausen's "Kontra-Punkte." Karis' strong, clear attacks 
and wide spectrum of colors enlivened the performance considerably. Resident 
conductor Thomas Nee kept the pace taut and the ensemble precisely focused.

PITTSBURGH TROUPE AT TERRACE THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH ZIMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The social order may be turning upside down in various Soviet republics, but in 
the repertory of the Duquesne University Tamburitzans, centuries of traditional 
Slavic dance and song are protected, celebrated and displayed for American 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
A Pittsburgh-based troupe of 40 dancers, singers and musicians, the 
Tamburitzans offered a tightly structured program at the packed Terrace Theater 
in Long Beach on Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Now in their 53rd year, they took the stage with interwoven ensembles of 
dancers and instrumentalists. From bagpipes, oboe-like sopels and the women's 
throats came the strange and wonderful harmonies of Croatia; meanwhile, men 
danced in lines with men, and women in clusters with women. 
</P>
<P>
A single choreographer, Zeljko Jergan, arranged the dances for the first half 
of the seamless presentation. After intermission, each work had a different 
provenance, including a charming adaptation of a satirical sketch by Igor 
Moiseyev. In this number, the "Starogorodski Kadrille," students in homely 
dresses and mismatched coats, pretending to be post-revolutionary Russian 
clerks pretending to be the aristocrats they despised, danced a 
pre-revolutionary quadrille. 
</P>
<P>
Stomping dances in high black boots were performed to Polish folk melodies; May 
Festival dances from Serbia were executed by processions of men and maidens 
wearing traditional curly-toed shoes. The dancers' upright bearing contrasted 
pleasantly with their deft footwork. Clusters of musicians played a variety of 
stringed instruments as well as accordions and the haunting pipes. 
</P>
<P>
The Tamburitzans will offer additional performances Saturday at 9 p.m. and 
Sunday at 7:30 p.m in the Gindi Auditorium at the University of Judaism.

<TEXT>
<P>
Maxine Mahon of the California Ballet is headed for the Soviet Union at the 
invitation of the Ballet School in Tbilisi, Soviet Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
The director will attend a two-week course for dance teachers, scheduled to 
begin at the end of May. 
</P>
<P>
The trip will coincide with Cal Ballet student Calvin Kitten's graduation from 
an exchange program in Tbilisi, which will bring a Soviet dance student to the 
company's ranks in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Mahon is planning side-trips to Moscow and other Soviet cities as well, to pave 
the way for a 1991-92 tour of the Soviet Union by her San Diego-based ballet 
troupe.

LEON FLEISHER CLOSES PACIFIC SYMPHONY SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For nearly 25 years, Leon Fleisher has made what seemed a career detour into a 
mainstream occupation. 
</P>
<P>
As a left-handed pianist -- when Fleisher was 37, his right hand was made 
inoperative by a disorder later diagnosed as carpal tunnel syndrome -- the 
American musician has successfully specialized in and expanded that repertory. 
At the same time, his pursuit of a conducting career has borne fruit; actually, 
Fleisher was, long before being struck by the hand-disorder, a conducting 
protege of Pierre Monteux, who saw the breadth of his talents. 
</P>
<P>
Now 61, Fleisher seems in his prime as both pianist and conductor. His first 
appearance in Orange County, Wednesday night, when he led the Pacific Symphony 
in a Beethoven/Ravel/Rachmaninoff program at Segerstrom Hall in Costa Mesa, 
displayed his mastery impressively. 
</P>
<P>
Ending its fourth season in the Orange County Performing Arts Center, the 
ensemble played both splendidly and lethargically, by turns. No doubt the most 
inconsistent of the more visible symphonic bands in Southern California, the 
Pacific Symphony can soar or crawl, depending on the occasion, the conductor 
and a number of other variables. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, the orchestra gave its deepest attention and best efforts to 
Fleisher -- in the final movements of Rachmaninoff's Second Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Here, players and conductor achieved a wondrous combination of immaculate 
execution, emotional expansion and artistic reserve. The pathos of the Adagio, 
which under some leaders can grow excessive, emerged at once pristine and 
seductive. The finale proved, as it can, cathartic, authoritative and moving -- 
a conclusive statement summing up all that precedes it. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, however, in the opening movements of the symphony, but particularly in 
Beethoven's "Coriolan" Overture, the orchestra vacillated between crystalline 
transparency and vague and muddy textures, between stunning, mellow wind 
playing and less-than-clean blasts, between perfectly aligned attacks and 
flabby entrances. 
</P>
<P>
At mid-program, Fleisher, conducting Ravel's Left-Hand Concerto from the 
keyboard, seemed to give the players no choices. 
</P>
<P>
With a hair-raising, definitive reading of Ravel's masterpiece emerging from 
the grand piano, and commanding, irresistible gestures from the leader, the 
orchestra responded in kind. 
</P>
<P>
The performance moved ineluctably from its threatening beginning to its 
climactic resolution, in a straight line. For once, the subsequent standing 
ovation seemed appropriate. DANIEL CARIAGA

STITCHES DISHES UP THE RIGHT PRESCRIPTION FOR THE PALATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wee-oo, wee-oo, wee-oo, here comes another ambulance. We're across the street 
from the emergency entrance of County-USC Medical Center, having dinner. 
</P>
<P>
The place is named Stitches, and yes, the waiters do wear green 
operating-theater tunics. Yes, there's a tangle of scarcely unpacked plastic 
tubes behind the counter, so when somebody draws a Coke you see syrup moving 
around like blood in an I.V. unit. A bottle of liquefied CO2 lies next to it, 
as if left there by an absent-minded anesthetist. 
</P>
<P>
Some of this might be accident, but Stitches does seem to have a little fun 
with its situation. We certainly can't blame it. Not every restaurant has to 
endure the apocalyptic wail of a siren every few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But the place is not just a gag. Stitches is a real resource for this 
restaurant-poor neighborhood, where the hamburger otherwise rules. You see 
doctors and nurses wander across the street at all hours, obviously pleased to 
vary their cafeteria diet. 
</P>
<P>
And for visitors to the hospital, it must be a real comfort. A plate of 
linguine can get you through a lot of anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
Technically it's just a lunch counter with a beer and wine license, but 
Stitches has a more sophisticated style than you'd expect. On the wall you find 
a Miro print and a Patrick Nagel poster. Hot rolls the size of walnuts, 
dripping with garlic and olive oil, come with many entrees. 
</P>
<P>
There are evident signs of health-consciousness. Garlic abounds, and chicken is 
definitely the specialty. Probably the best entree is grilled chicken breast 
with "garlic slivers," which are thin slices of garlic cooked quite brown, 
perfumey and sweet. The best of the pastas is chicken Alfredo, made with rather 
wide noodles (like egg noodles, rather than fettuccine) and broccoli and the 
occasional bit of dried tomato. 
</P>
<P>
The chicken sandwich is a grilled breast in thick, sweet teriyaki sauce (and 
some Thousand Island-type secret sauce) on a whole wheat bun sprinkled with 
bran. It comes with some home fries that define, or even redefine, the genre: 
slices of potato fried very, very casually (and often quite brown) with the 
occasional bit of onion or bell pepper. You might think it Army chow, until you 
notice that it's made with delicate new potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
The pizzas follow the thin-crust school, easy to handle and of a fresh cracker 
flavor. The fairly short list includes a barbecued chicken pizza (there's also 
a chicken sausage pizza for hard-core chicken fans), which was what I actually 
got when I asked for the Roma tomato, garlic and basil pizza. It wasn't bad as 
barbecued chicken pizza goes, with a sauce that was at least not stupefyingly 
sweet. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes Stitches tries its hand at Cajun food. The only attempt I'm familiar 
with is an odd "seafood gumbo" that was really a good pepper-hot tomato broth 
with celery and an odd papery substance with bits of red coloring -- probably 
surirmi, or imitation crab. Not what I'd call gumbo, but not bad on a cold day. 
</P>
<P>
One thing I know that Stitches has a monopoly on in its immediate neighborhood 
is calamari pasta. The linguine is colored black with squid ink and served in a 
light white wine (and garlic) sauce with bits of squid. Unfortunately, the 
squid itself is a little mushy and overdone. 
</P>
<P>
The heavy focus on chicken cannot be accidental, because Stitches doesn't 
specialize in meat. The most expensive thing on the menu is the flank steak, 
but though it's pretty tender (apart from a tiny rind of gristle), it's not 
very flavorful. Nor is it a very big portion, but maybe the doctors prefer it 
that way. In any case, it's vastly overpowered by the vegetables (boiled rather 
than steamed, but usually not badly overcooked) and salad (with garlicky 
vinaigrette, natch). 
</P>
<P>
The least successful thing I've had here was a pork-chop special. The grilled, 
not barbecued, chops were served with a candy-sweet, palate-numbing sauce that 
could kill the flavor of anything. But then these cotton-dry chops didn't 
deserve a lot of mercy to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
And you really wouldn't come here for the desserts. Apparently, none of them 
are made on the premises. They're merely honest commercial pastries from the 
cheesecake/apple pie/chocolate chocolate list. 
</P>
<P>
Stitches has a monstrous parking problem. You have your choice of all-day lots 
that charge a flat $5 rate and tend to fill up anyway, or potluck parking on 
the street. Things seem a little slow in the late afternoon and evening, and 
there's a happy hour from 3 to 7 p.m. with a pitcher of beer and a pizza (one 
topping) for $8.99. 
</P>
<P>
So it's not Spago. Stitches is still worth knowing about in this part of town. 
What do you want across the street from Emergency Admitting? 
</P>
<P>
Stitches, 1927 1/2 Zonal Ave., Lincoln Heights; (213) 222-0221. Breakfast, 
lunch and dinner 9 a.m.-9 p.m. daily. Beer and wine. Street parking; parking 
lots in neighborhood. No credit cards. Dinner for two, food only, $15-$30.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: MEXICA: UPSCALE AND AUTHENTIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Chinese Kitchen was a perfectly preserved '30s-era Chinese restaurant that 
could have come straight out of the pages of a Raymond Chandler novel. Every 
hip newcomer to Los Angeles ate there once . . . exactly once. 
</P>
<P>
The place was all looks. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, rumors surfaced that the space was to be transformed into a 
high-concept restaurant called Chino Latino -- a hybrid of Chinese and Mexican 
food served in an elaborate fantasy setting that was supposed to persuade 
customers they were eating in a Chinese restaurant in the middle of the Amazon. 
People worried. 
</P>
<P>
But Chino Latino didn't happen. Mexica did. The restaurant, at 7313 Beverly 
Blvd., Los Angeles, (213) 933-7385, is not quite the high-voltage place people 
feared, but an airy, pleasant room (high ceilings, interesting sconces, 
Postmodern Mexican realist-style murals) that is respectful of its '30s 
surroundings without being retro in the least. And only one kind of cooking is 
done here: Mexican. 
</P>
<P>
It's owned by Albert Solis, who's put in time as a waiter and manager in some 
of the hippest restaurants on both coasts, including Angeli, Cha Cha Cha and 
Brian McNally's Canal Bar in New York. He brought his parents in to work on the 
food, which is more authentic than you'd expect for such upscale surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
A quesadilla, for instance, isn't the plate-sized mass of flour tortilla, 
orange cheese and sour cream you might get across the street at El Coyote, but 
a tiny packet of cornmeal, sort of a cross between a pupusa and an empanada, 
stuffed with cheese and zucchini flowers, or sauteed chiles, stuff like that. 
There are standard enchilada platters too, but also red snapper Veracruz-style, 
chilaquiles and Yucatan-style pork pibil. 
</P>
<P>
One more thing, when you say Mexica, say meh-SHEE-ka. The restaurant has Aztec 
aspirations. LAURIE OCHOA

HOME TECH / WHAT'S NEW IN VIDEO: WOODY ALLEN'S BRIGHT, WITTY 'CRIMES, 
MISDEMEANORS'

<BYLINE>

<P>
THIS WEEK'S MOVIES 
</P>
<P>
Could the most intellectually mature and morally challenging film of 1989 also 
be one of that year's funniest? Check out Woody Allen's "Crimes and 
Misdemeanors" (Orion, $89.98, PG-13) and see. 
</P>
<P>
This brilliant film interweaves two stories -- one about the predicament and 
choices of a socially prominent ophthalmologist (Martin Landau), the other 
about a documentary film maker (Allen) who struggles with metaphysical 
questions and competes with his overbearing brother-in-law (Alan Alda) for the 
attention of a sweet but ambitious woman (Mia Farrow). Another incredible 
combination of intelligence and humor from writer-director Allen. 
</P>
<P>
If Woody Allen films strain your brain, then you might prefer the time-travel 
sequel "Back to the Future Part II" (MCA/Universal, priced for rental, PG), 
which takes Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd from 1955 to 1985 to 2015. Its 
video release is timed to coincide with the theatrical debut of "Part III." 
</P>
<P>
Several critics thought that the best thing about "The Fabulous Baker Boys" 
(IVE, $89.95, R) was its fabulous female lead -- Michelle Pfeiffer, who graced 
the top of a piano better than anyone since Helen Morgan. A lot of those 
critics liked the rest of the movie, too -- a romantic comedy/drama about an 
ex-prostitute's involvement with a small-time lounge-music duo (Jeff and Beau 
Bridges). 
</P>
<P>
Another film from last year boasting a strong cast was "Triumph of the Spirit" 
(RCA/Columbia, $89.95, R), with Willem Dafoe as a Greek prisoner who tries to 
stay alive in Auschwitz by boxing. Edward James Olmos and Robert Loggia also 
star. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Whales Came" (CBS/Fox, $89.98, PG) is a British drama examining 
mankind's lack of respect for nature, starring Helen Mirren and Paul Scofield. 
</P>
<P>
"Worth Winning" (CBS/Fox, $89.98, PG-13) stars Mark Harmon and Madeleine Stowe 
in a comedy about a cocky TV weatherman. 
</P>
<P>
OLDIES: One of the most fascinating, metaphysically slanted dramas that 
Hollywood (and producer David O. Selznick) ever made, "Portrait of Jennie" 
(1948), is available for $39.98 from CBS/Fox. It stars Jennifer Jones and 
Joseph Cotten. Also at that price from the same label (and also produced by 
Selznick): the lovely World War II tear-jerker "Since You Went Away" (1944), 
also with Jones and Cotten, and two of John Barrymore's best performances, in 
"A Bill of Divorcement" (1932, also the screen debut of Katharine Hepburn), and 
"Topaze" (1933). 
</P>
<P>
COMING ATTRACTIONS: "My Left Foot" (June 13), "Steel Magnolias" (June 20), 
"Music Box" "Peter Pan" (the Disney cartoon version, Sept. 21). TERRY ATKINSON

<P>
FLATLANDERS, 3 PALS FROM WEST TEXAS, RESURFACE AFTER 18 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joe Ely, Jimmie Dale Gilmore and Butch Hancock are singer-songwriters who 
displayed the raw talent in the early '70s to become the nucleus of a 
country-music revolution that might have rivaled the fabled "outlaw" movement 
of Willie and Waylon. 
</P>
<P>
But the three pals from West Texas dealt in a folk- and blues-influenced 
country style that was out of place in Nashville in the pop-conscious '70s -- 
and which has never really returned to favor there despite all the talk in 
recent years about the "new traditionalist" movement in country music. 
</P>
<P>
Before Ely, Gilmore and Hancock started solo careers that led to several 
outstanding if commercially ignored albums, the three musicians joined together 
as the Flatlanders in 1972 to make an acoustic album in Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
The music from those sessions lacked the sociological commentary of Gram 
Parsons' earlier work with the Flying Burrito Brothers, but there was a purity 
of emotion in the Flatlanders' approach that reflected some of the freshness 
and vision of the Burritos' music. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Flatlanders' tracks were apparently so far from the commercial 
mainstream at the time that the album was only released on eight-track tape -- 
until now. 
</P>
<P>
Rounder Records has released 13 selections from the sessions in a highly 
recommended 35-minute CD titled "More a Legend Than a Band." 
</P>
<P>
Though Ely has enjoyed more success as a solo artist than either Hancock or 
Gilmore, he played a background role in the Flatlanders. Gilmore sang lead 
vocals and wrote three of the songs. Hancock wrote four others. 
</P>
<P>
In the liner notes, Colin Escott writes, "The Flatlanders' sound was akin to a 
78 r.p.m. without the crackle and hiss -- except that the lyrics were 
stunningly contemporary. It was a compelling juxtaposition of the old and the 
new." 
</P>

RAP ON: The just-released "Hip-Hop Greats: Classic Raps" doesn't come with the 
colorful booklets normally found in Rhino Records compilations, but the music 
in the 69-minute CD includes some of the most influential works in the 
evolution of rap. Among them: the Sugarhill Gang's "Rapper's Delight," 
Grandmaster Flash &amp; the Furious Five's "The Message," Run-DMC's "It's Like 
That," UTFO's "Roxanne, Roxanne" and Kurtis Blow's "The Breaks."

Black state employees in California are more than three times as likely as 
Anglo workers to be disciplined or fired, according to a two-year state 
Personnel Board study. Blacks make up less than 12% of the state government 
work force in California, but they accounted for 38% of the firings and 33% of 
the dismissals during probation, according to a report on the study. 
</P>
<P>
Latino workers also are disciplined more often than Anglos, the report 
concluded. Asian and Filipinos had a low percentage of sanctions. Figures for 
American Indians, Pacific Islanders and other minorities were not at wide 
variance. The findings were compiled by the Adverse Action Task Force, a group 
of more than 40 state workers, managers, union officials and civil rights 
activists.

A legislative study urges the state to construct a $12.6-billion rail system by 
the year 2000 that would carry passengers between San Francisco and Los Angeles 
at speeds of 125 m.p.h. or more. The study, which the Legislature will consider 
when it sets funding priorities for improving rail service in the San Joaquin 
Valley, calls for building a route over the Tehachapi Mountains along 
Interstate 5 to link Bakersfield and Los Angeles.

JIM MURRAY: NO LUSTER ON HIS INDY STAR

INDIANAPOLIS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You're Emerson Fittipaldi and everything's all right. Car owners are fighting 
to put you in the driver's seat. You get your pick of the cars, the crews, the 
parts. You fly first class, stay in the Palace. Money is no object. 
</P>
<P>
You're Danny Sullivan, any Andretti, Rick Mears, Bobby Rahal, and you're 
getting in the automotive elite. The Roger Penske team, the Babe Ruth Yankees 
of auto racing, is courting you. You get machines hand-tooled for speed in 
elegant test centers in England. You get a garage full of the best backup 
engines the industry can tool. You're a celebrity, people want your autograph. 
You're auto racing's answer to Bo Jackson, Joe Montana. 
</P>
<P>
Then, there are the other guys. There are more of them. They fill out the 
field. They scramble for rides. They prowl the garages of Gasoline Alley, 
helmet in hand, gloves at the ready. Sometimes, they get in mystery cars. They 
qualify in used cars, last year's models put together with Scotch tape and 
baling wire. 
</P>
<P>
They're the real heart of Indianapolis racing. Without them, there's no 500. 
They have no real expectation of winning. But they don't care. They're just 
glad to be there. They talk of "making the show," not winning the race. They're 
spending thousands of dollars while the big factories are spending millions. 
It's like trying to win the Kentucky Derby with a burro. They know all they'll 
see of Penske's cars is tailpipes, but hey, someone's got to do it. 
</P>
<P>
Indy knows who they are. They're the spear carriers in this automotive opera. 
Their best hope is for major attrition. They need 25 cars to drop out of the 
race. They're like guys buying a ticket on a lottery. They can't run with the 
big boys, but maybe they can outlast them. 
</P>
<P>
They had names such as Tingelstad and Dallenbach and Krisiloff and Gehlhausen. 
They were there every year, good drivers in bad cars, magnificent young men in 
their washing machines. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, they escaped the chorus line. Johnny Rutherford used to be one of 
them till he got noticed, graduated from the back of the pack and become a 
speedway legend, a three-time winner. Gordon Johncock had to claw his way onto 
the front row before he became a two-time winner. 
</P>
<P>
They know it's a longshot, but so was Buster Douglas. You can't win if you 
don't play, and they call for cards even though they get into something that 
cynical mechanics say is "guaranteed for 30 miles or 30 seconds, whichever 
comes first." 
</P>
<P>
Scott Brayton knows the view from near the back of the pack as well as anybody. 
Scott knows what it is to try to win this pot with a pair of treys. He's been 
in eight Indy races. He fills out the dance card faithfully -- but you don't 
see him in any of the full-page tire ads the day after. He's usually trying to 
nurse a sick car through the chutes hoping nothing critical falls off and the 
oil doesn't leak. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Brayton has 20/10 vision: he can see at 20 feet what you have to go to 10 
to make out. He's been driving a car since he learned to talk. Some kids want a 
pony for Christmas, he wanted something with an engine in it. He dumped a 
go-kart in a snowbank when he was 6. 
</P>
<P>
He laughs a lot and he talks a lot. Life is pretty uncomplicated for Scott. He 
just climbs in a car, floors it and sees how far he can go. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Brayton could probably take one of those Penske Chevies and put it right 
where Rick Mears does -- on the front row, in the lead for 160 or so laps and 
maybe in Victory Lane. 
</P>
<P>
But Scott Brayton does not get one of those Penske Chevrolets. Scott Brayton is 
one of the hitchhikers of Gasoline Alley. He has to thumb a ride. 
</P>
<P>
He does very well, all things considered. In 1985, he came within 2/10ths of a 
second of the pole. He qualified his Buick with the fastest qualifying lap ever 
turned at the Speedway until then -- 214.199 m.p.h. -- but the transmission 
broke in the stretch on qualifying day, and he had to coast across the finish 
line to the second spot. Everyone at the track knew the untried Buick wouldn't 
last much longer than the national anthem, but his lasted a bit longer than 
teammate Pancho Carter's, 19 laps to six. 
</P>
<P>
Getting in the race is always lump-in-the-throat business for the Scott 
Braytons, but he cheerfully sets about it each season. About two years ago, he 
became a distributor for Amway household products, and it occurred to him these 
entrepreneurial characters were naturals for auto race sponsorships. "I was 
making a talk and I realized there wasn't a negative person in the room," he 
said. "They dealt in positives." 
</P>
<P>
Brayton deals in positives, too. Back-row bumpers have to. "My first year at 
the Speedway (1981), I had talked a sponsor into putting $35,000 into my team," 
Brayton says. "But I had to make the race or it was no deal. I had find to find 
six more miles per hour with time running out." 
</P>
<P>
Back-row crews always have to find six more miles. "I had to wave off two 
qualifying attempts and I was down to my last one and it was 4:45 on the last 
day of qualifying," Brayton says. "Now, I believe in the Lord. I don't preach, 
but I prayed to find those six more miles per hour. Just then, a friend of my 
father's came up and told him, 'Your son's blowing a popoff valve. If you drill 
this little hole in the exhaust, you'll stop losing that power.' So, we did it 
-- and if that hadn't happened, you wouldn't be talking to me now." 
</P>
<P>
He got in the race in the 10th row, ran 174 laps and finished 16th. 
</P>
<P>
Those are the kinds of things the back-row bunch have to do to get on the 
track. They're used to it. This year, Brayton was turning a nice groove, 
heading up over 220 on a qualifying run when, suddenly, his pit crew forgot to 
signal the flagman it was a run. With a car full of run, Brayton suddenly found 
himself facing a yellow, get-off-the-track light. 
</P>
<P>
He had to re-qualify. On a windier day and a slower track. But that's life in 
the caboose of the race. Don't look for Scott Brayton up there with the 
soloists in this auto opera. He'll be back there with the boys in the band, the 
stagehands, the understudies. They're just hoping for the day the stars can't 
make it, and they get their names in lights for a change. Scott Brayton is 
surrogate for every Dick Simon, Mike Mosley or Roger McCluskey who ever teed it 
up in here with high hopes and smoking car and made the race but not the 
headlines.

25 YEARS LATER: A FIX OR A FIST?; 
</P>
<P>
BOXING: WHEN MUHAMMAD ALI KNOCKED OUT SONNY LISTON IN THE FIRST ROUND OF THEIR 
REMATCH, MANY AT RINGSIDE DIDN'T BELIEVE IT WAS A LEGITIMATE FIGHT. SOME STILL 
DON'T. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty-five years ago today, 4,200 people in a Lewiston, Me., high school 
hockey rink saw either boxing's most shameful charade or, depending on where 
they were sitting, a tired, old heavyweight knocked out by a perfectly 
legitimate punch. 
</P>
<P>
The Shame in Maine, some still call it. Others call it much ado about nothing. 
</P>
<P>
It was Clay-Liston II, a rematch of the controversial Cassius Clay-Sonny Liston 
fight 15 months earlier at the Miami Beach Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
In Florida, the sports world had been shocked by the sight of the seemingly 
indomitable Liston, a 7-1 favorite, quitting on his stool after the sixth 
round, claiming an injured shoulder. Thus the heavyweight championship passed 
into the hands of Cassius Clay, who the following day announced that he had 
joined the Muslim faith and had a new name, Muhammad Ali. 
</P>
<P>
But while shock and disbelief greeted the Clay-Liston I result, the outcome of 
their second bout was greeted with outrage and fury. 
</P>
<P>
Fans in the Central Maine Youth Center surged toward the ring, demanding 
refunds and screaming, "Fix!" and "Fake!" The next day, grandstanding 
politicians across the United States were summoning TV cameras and proposing 
that boxing be banned. 
</P>
<P>
For a few days, it seemed like an even bet as to whether professional boxing 
would make it through 1965. The May 26 headline in The Times read: 
</P>
<P>
"IT ONLY TAKES MINUTE TO KILL BOXING." 
</P>
<P>
In the eye of the firestorm was a harmless-looking, countering right-hand punch 
that Ali, 23, a 13-10 underdog, employed to knock out Liston, believed to be at 
least 33, in the first round. To most, it looked more like a slap. 
</P>
<P>
"I've spanked my kids harder," was an oft-said line. 
</P>
<P>
A quarter-century later, opinions held by those who were there, even two 
columnists from this newspaper, differ sharply. 
</P>
<P>
Says Jim Murray: "I saw the punch, and it was a good one. But the point is, 
Sonny was old and out of shape -- I don't think he could've beaten a 10 count 
if he'd tripped over his shoelaces." 
</P>
<P>
Says Melvin Durslag, who then wrote for the Los Angeles Herald Examiner: "I've 
covered a lot of championship fights, and that one was the only one I didn't 
think was sanitary. In my opinion, Liston either took money to go down, or the 
Muslims had him scared to death." 
</P>
<P>
The fight had tighter security than a Presidential visit. Everyone entering the 
hockey rink that night was searched. Durslag recalls that security men took 
away his wife's steel knitting needles. 
</P>
<P>
In the days before the fight, there was a rumor that Muslim followers of 
Malcolm X, who had been assassinated, were bent on revenge and planned an 
assassination attempt on Ali. 
</P>
<P>
The fight's closed-circuit TV promoter, Sportsvision, in effect laid odds of 
1,000 to 1 on Ali -- to live through the fight. The firm took out a three-day, 
$1-million life insurance policy on him for $1,000. Sportsvision beamed the 
fight to 258 closed-circuit locations. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Bingham, then a training camp aide to Ali, recently recalled bizarre 
daybreak roadwork sessions, accompanied by slow-moving policemen. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd run at sunup, the two of us, and the cops would start out running with us 
but couldn't keep up," Bingham said. "One of them would hand me a gun, then 
they'd wave us on." 
</P>
<P>
Reporters who interviewed Ali at his Lewiston Holiday Inn campsite had to first 
pass patdowns by uniformed policemen and Ali's own security people. At the 
weigh-in, police guarded every door and surrounded the fighters. 
</P>
<P>
Ali's trainer, Angelo Dundee, still reacts angrily to those who suggest it was 
a rigged fight. "He got him with a solid punch," Dundee said recently. "Look at 
the film. Sonny's left foot jumps off the canvas just as Ali hits him. It was a 
flash right hand. Ali hurt a lot of guys with it. 
</P>
<P>
"And he was not backing up when he hit him, like so many guys wrote. He was 
sliding laterally. One thing about boxing, it's the shots you never see that 
hurt you the most. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who say that fight was fixed should have seen Sonny's eyes like I 
did, right after. A few seconds after it's over, I felt kind of sorry for the 
guy and I walked up to him and said: 'Tough, Sonny.' His eyes looked right 
through me. He didn't see nothin'." 
</P>
<P>
Both Murray and HBO boxing commentator Larry Merchant, then a sportswriter with 
the Philadelphia Daily News, recall hearing reports in Lewiston before the 
fight that things weren't right in Liston's camp. 
</P>
<P>
"We were hearing that Sonny's sparring partners were being paid extra to hold 
back," Merchant said. "My own view is that Sonny was simply an old heavyweight, 
waiting to get knocked out. I believe it was a solid punch. It was such a shock 
at that time to see Sonny Liston on the canvas. No one had ever seen that 
before." 
</P>
<P>
To Mark Kram, who covered the fight for Sports Illustrated, the aftermath was a 
case of members of the media rushing to judgment over a punch most of them 
didn't see. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a perfectly valid, stunning right-hand punch to the side of the head, 
and (Ali) won without benefit of a fix," wrote Kram, in his first paragraph. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people," Kram reported, "failed to see the short, fast right to the jaw 
that nailed Liston, and among them were numerous reporters. . . . (There is) no 
shred of evidence or plausibility to support the suggestion that this was 
anything but an honest fight. 
</P>
<P>
"The knockout punch itself was thrown with the amazing speed that makes Clay 
different from any other heavyweight. He leaned away from one of Liston's 
pawing, ponderous jabs, planted himself solidly and whipped his right arm over 
Liston's left arm and into the side of Liston's jaw." 
</P>
<P>
Kram also reported that Amos Lincoln, a sparring partner of Liston's, had been 
"carefully coached" to be "well battered" at Liston's Poland Spring Hotel camp 
in the days before the fight. For several weeks before that, he had routinely 
connected with Liston's head with right crosses, according to Kram. 
</P>
<P>
Wrote the New York Times' Arthur Daley of the knockout punch: "The punch looked 
good, but not great. Certainly, it didn't appear thunderous enough to fell the 
oak-thewed Sonny." 
</P>
<P>
Daley also commented on a report in a Boston newspaper afterward that Lincoln 
had been paid an extra $100 to let Liston batter him in final sparring 
sessions. "He gave Lincoln a pretty good thumping, but his camp followers were 
not misled," Daley wrote. "They knew in their hearts the old man didn't have it 
any more." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Hand, who covered the fight for the Associated Press, didn't think much of 
the punch. "I saw it and I thought it was a glancing blow," Hand said recently. 
"I was surprised Liston went down and even more surprised he didn't get up. I 
remember hearing Terry Downes, the British middleweight, saying that night: 
'I've hit my daughter harder.' " 
</P>
<P>
Murray Rose compiled the round-by-round summary for the AP that night and was 
as mystified as Hand. "It looked like a phantom punch to me," he said. "I saw 
him swinging, but I just didn't see it connect. I remember some writers saying 
they'd seen a solid punch, though." 
</P>
<P>
After Lewiston, Liston won 14 consecutive fights, 13 by knockout. Some pointed 
to that streak as evidence that Liston had done business with someone in 
Lewiston. 
</P>
<P>
"None of the fighters he met after Lewiston were ranked fighters, until he met 
Leotis Martin, who knocked him out (in 1969)," Merchant said. 
</P>
<P>
Liston fought once more after the Martin bout, winning a tough, bloody fight 
with Chuck Wepner in June 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Ali went on to have one of boxing's great careers. Yet to come were his 
memorable bouts with Joe Frazier and Ken Norton, his upset of George Foreman in 
Zaire, and his dramatic regaining of the championship, at 36, from Leon Spinks. 
</P>
<P>
Ali-Liston II probably still leads the league in rumors. 
</P>
<P>
"We heard all kinds of things in Lewiston," Durslag recalled. "One theory was 
that the Muslims were very anxious to keep the title, that they'd told Sonny: 
'Be a good boy and take the money.' Then we heard that Sonny was scared to 
death that he'd be hit by stray gunfire (meant for Ali) during the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"I can remember Ali immediately afterward, as mystified as anyone, being vague 
about the punch. Then, after he'd showered, his line was it was an 'anchor 
punch,' taught to him by Stepin Fetchit, who was in his camp then." 
</P>
<P>
One ringside observer, former heavyweight champion Jim Braddock, said the 
suspect Ali right hand merely finished up what an earlier punch had begun. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a feeling that this guy (Ali) is a lot better than any of us gave him 
credit for," Braddock told Daley. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't the knockout punch that sticks in my mind as much as a punch he let 
go (earlier). . . . It was a right to Liston's jaw and it shook him to his 
shoetops. For all we know, it could have been the one that set up the 
knockout." 
</P>
<P>
Another former champion, the late Rocky Marciano, changed his view about the 
knockout punch after seeing videotape the next day. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think it was a powerful punch when I saw the fight from ringside," 
Marciano said. "Now (after seeing video) I think Clay, seeing the opening, 
snapped the punch the last six inches." 
</P>
<P>
If there are dark secrets still untold from Lewiston, they won't be told by 
Sonny Liston. He died on Dec. 30, 1970, under somewhat mysterious circumstances 
in Las Vegas. His wife, who had been gone several days, found his body on their 
bed. 
</P>
<P>
The police report indicated that small amounts of marijuana and heroin were 
found near the body, but those who knew Liston maintain to this day that he 
never used illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
In his final years as a fighter, Liston's manager was Johnny Tocco, who at 79 
runs a Las Vegas gym. Recently, Tocco recalled a conversation he had with 
Liston shortly before he died. 
</P>
<P>
"I never asked Sonny about things I didn't think he wanted to talk about," 
Tocco said. "But I'd heard from someone who was once in his camp that Sonny had 
been told before the second Ali fight that if Ali didn't win, Sonny's son would 
be kidnaped. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him about it, and all Sonny told me was: 'Let's not talk about that -- 
it was the way the fight had to go.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ali, 48, lives on his 88-acre farm at Berrien Springs, Mich. He is afflicted 
with a form of Parkinson's Disease. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Maine Youth Center in downtown Lewiston stands, and its owners are 
contemplating adding a second rink to accommodate the children of the 
hockey-crazed region. The building is also used for weekend swap meets. 
</P>
<P>
In the immediate aftermath of Lewiston, Ring magazine columnist Dan Daniel 
seems today to have been closer to the truth than most when he wrote after the 
fight: "Did Liston go into the tank at Lewiston? Who knows? What happened in 
Maine was in the nature of a fever. As Lincoln said, while Gettysburg was 
raging, 'This, too, will pass.' "

CLIPPERS TO NAME SCHULER; 
</P>
<P>
NBA: FORMER TRAIL BLAZER COACH TO BE ANNOUNCED TODAY AS CASEY'S REPLACEMENT.

<P>
The Clippers have called a news conference for today to introduce Mike Schuler 
as their new coach, sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
An assistant with the Golden State Warriors the last 1 1/2 seasons, Schuler, 
49, has long been a Clipper favorite. They interviewed him last year when the 
job went to Don Casey, then the interim coach. 
</P>
<P>
When Casey's option was not picked up after this season, Schuler became an 
immediate candidate. He and Mike Fratello, formerly coach of the Atlanta Hawks, 
were the only two who met with General Manager Elgin Baylor and owner Donald T. 
Sterling. Both candidates made final visits this week. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers also were interested in K.C. Jones and Bernie Bickerstaff, both 
with the Seattle SuperSonics; Jimmy Rodgers, recently fired as coach of the 
Boston Celtics, and Cleveland Coach Lenny Wilkens. But in each case, the 
Clippers were either refused permission by teams or told no thanks by the 
individual. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Portsmouth, Ohio, Schuler has been an assistant to three of the 
biggest names in basketball: Bob Knight (at Army), Larry Brown (New Jersey 
Nets) and Don Nelson (Milwaukee Bucks and Warriors). He has been head coach at 
Virginia Military Institute, Rice University and, starting in 1986, with the 
Portland Trail Blazers, where he built his current reputation. 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers went 127-83 (.605) with Schuler in charge, including the 
49-33 finish that earned him the NBA's coach of the year award in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
But he was fired in February of 1989 after ongoing personality conflicts with 
players, it was reported. Some team members considered him too hard-driving, 
and from there every problem was magnified. 
</P>
<P>
Schuler never denied he had personality differences with players. But, he said, 
the unhappy ones were in the minority -- and the loudest. At the forefront was 
Clyde Drexler, the team's star. 
</P>
<P>
So, a year after hiring Casey, who built his reputation as a motivator and a 
player favorite, the Clippers will turn to someone who is looked upon, at least 
by former players, as a disciplinarian. 
</P>
<P>
Schuler could not be reached for comment, although he would not confirm or deny 
the reports to Bay Area reporters. Baylor refused to answer any questions on 
the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Casey, who helped the Clippers to a 30-52 record last season, a nine-game 
improvement from the previous season, interviewed Wednesday to become director 
of basketball operations for the Denver Nuggets. He is also a candidate to 
become an assistant on the staff of the Hawks' new coach, Bob Weiss.

STANLEY CUP: EDMONTON WINS GAME, 4-1, AND SERIES, 4-1, FROM BOSTON FOR FIRST 
CHAMPIONSHIP SINCE GRETZKY TRADE TWO YEARS AGO. GOALIE RANFORD NAMED MVP.

<P>
It was the trade that shocked a nation, angered a city and, supposedly, 
decimated a team. 
</P>
<P>
Goodby Wayne Gretzky. Goodby Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
For two years, that's all Edmonton Oiler owner Peter Pocklington has been 
hearing after dealing The Great One to the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
But no more. Not after Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky may be in Los Angeles, but the Stanley Cup is back in Edmonton after 
the Oilers defeated the Boston Bruins Thursday night, 4-1, before a Boston 
Garden crowd of 14,448 to win the finals in five games. 
</P>
<P>
Pocklington, champagne dripping from his forehead, beamed outside the Oiler 
locker room after his team won its fifth Stanley Cup in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Arguably the team of the last decade, the Oilers are alive and well in the new 
decade. There is life after Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
"I was as much disturbed as anybody in Edmonton over the trade," Pocklington 
said. "Wayne Gretzky is not just a hockey player. He's an icon. 
</P>
<P>
"But to win in the '90s, you sometimes have to do something unpopular in the 
'80s. I did what I had to do. There is no doubt in my mind I did the right 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
This was a night of vindication: 
</P>
<P>
 -- For Pocklington, who has been under siege in Edmonton for the past two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 -- For goalie Bill Ranford, who had never won a playoff game before this 
season and wound up winning the Conn Smythe Trophy, given to the most valuable 
player in the finals. Ranford had a 16-6 record, tying the all-time mark for 
most playoff victories. In the five games of the finals, he allowed Boston a 
total of eight goals. 
</P>
<P>
 -- For center Mark Messier, who was handed the mantle of leadership when 
Gretzky departed. He had a Gretzky-type regular season, and is the favorite to 
win the Hart Memorial Trophy, given to the season's most valuable player. But 
Messier struggled through the first three games of the finals, getting only one 
assist. He came on strong in the final two games with four assists while 
centering a line that collected 16 points in the last two victories. 
</P>
<P>
 -- For a defense that was often forgotten behind the fast-skating, wide-open 
offense that grabbed the headlines in Edmonton. But Kevin Lowe, Craig Muni, 
Charlie Huddy, Steve Smith and Randy Gregg cleared out the puck and shut down 
the Bruins in the Oiler zone game after game, allowing both Ranford and the 
offense to shine. 
</P>
<P>
 -- For John Muckler in his first year as head coach. Muckler, who finally 
stepped out of the shadow of Glen Sather, proved he could make the right moves 
on his own at the championship level. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And vindication for Sather, who left the bench and the coaching to Muckler 
and concentrated on doing the wheeling and dealing as general manager who 
rebuilt this club. 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the nicest of the five Stanley Cups," Muckler said, "because 
coming out of training camp, we never expected to be here." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly not when they fell behind the Winnipeg Jets, three games-to-one, in 
the opening round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton won three in a row to survive that series, swept the Kings in four and 
beat the Chicago Blackhawks in six. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers then won the opener of the finals in the Garden in triple overtime, 
3-2, and also won Game 2 in Boston, 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
After losing the third game back home, 2-1, Edmonton came up with its best 
playoff effort in Game 4, winning easily, 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Game 5 was expected to be tough. The Bruins, owners of the league's best 
regular-season record, didn't figure to lose three in a row at home, surely not 
against a club that had stumbled so often here before in the regular season, 
going 2-13-2. 
</P>
<P>
And sure enough, Boston came out aggressively Thursday night, smashing bodies 
into the boards and the puck into the Edmonton zone. 
</P>
<P>
But when it became obvious the Bruins weren't going to be able to handle 
Ranford any better than they had in the past, it became merely a matter of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
The game was scoreless in the first period, but Glenn Anderson broke through at 
the 1:17 mark of the second after Bob Sweeney smashed the puck off him near the 
left boards at mid-ice. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson controlled the puck, skated down the left side and into the slot, 
where he found defensemen Don Sweeney and Ray Bourque awaiting him. 
</P>
<P>
Wisely avoiding Bourque, Boston's defensive leader, Anderson, without breaking 
stride, skated past Sweeney and rammed the puck through the pads of goalie Andy 
Moog. 
</P>
<P>
Boston never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Simpson scored his league-high 16th playoff goal later in the period, and 
Smith and Joe Murphy added third-period goals. 
</P>
<P>
Lyndon Byers accounted for the Bruins' only goal late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Boston outshot Edmonton, 30-22, but it didn't matter with Ranford on duty. 
</P>
<P>
Messier, the Stanley Cup held high over his head in the locker room with 
champagne pouring out of it, also took a moment to look back. 
</P>
<P>
"We all missed Wayne, he's a good friend of ours," he shouted above the roar of 
celebrating teammates. "This is for you, Wayne. We love you."

MORNING BRIEFING: HE WAS PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION AND MADE THEM PAY THE PRICE

<P>
In dealing with Oakland's Rickey Henderson, Boston catcher Tony Pena discovered 
that it doesn't pay to play it straight. 
</P>
<P>
After a game in which Henderson hit a game-opening home run off Red Sox pitcher 
Eric Hetzel, Henderson told the Boston Globe: "When the count was 3-and-2, Pena 
was out there yelling, 'Throw the ball right down the middle. I want you to 
throw the ball right down the middle and let him hit it.' 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that maybe they were trying to trick me. They'll do that sometimes 
with you. I thought he probably would throw me the curve, but he threw me the 
fastball, and I hit it out. When I got back, Pena said, 'I didn't mean hit it 
like that.' " 
</P>
<P>
Add A's: Outfielder Dave Henderson, always looking for an edge, told the 
Oakland Tribune: "Mike Witt was one of the toughest starting pitchers in the 
league three years ago. Well, I watched him and watched him, and found that his 
finger stuck out a little bit on his breaking ball. He doesn't do that 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
More A's: From St. Louis Cardinal pitcher John Tudor, revealing that Oakland 
tried hard to sign him after he left the Dodgers: "Anyone in their right mind 
would want to play for the A's, being the world champions. But not being in my 
right mind, I didn't want to learn a new league." 
</P>
<P>
Of his stay in Los Angeles, he said: "Nothing against the ballpark, nothing 
against the team, but I'm not a patient person. I don't like sitting in 
traffic. I don't like waking up in the morning with my eyes burning. That 
lifestyle was not for me." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who is the only driver to win the Indianapolis 500 in three 
decades? 
</P>
<P>
Call of the wild: Blazermania has overtaken the city of Portland, and Trail 
Blazer media director John Lashway wondered if it had gone too far when he 
answered the press room telephone during the final playoff game against San 
Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
Lashway: "This woman on the other end had gotten the number, I don't know how. 
Suddenly she starts tearing into the officiating. She wants me to get a message 
to referee Joey Crawford that he stinks." 
</P>
<P>
How about it?: Cincinnati Red outfielder Paul O'Neil, on the crackdown on 
oversized gloves: "Back in the old days, players used their bare hands instead 
of gloves. If you had big hands, did that mean you couldn't play." 
</P>
<P>
Mark it down: From Chicago Coach Mike Ditka, promising that Mark Carrier, the 
Bears' No. 1 draft choice from USC, will be a starter at safety: "If anyone 
keeps Mark off the field, he'll be on his way to Canton." 
</P>
<P>
Canton, Ohio, is the home of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Who asked that?: Said New York Giant Coach Bill Parcells, when somebody asked 
if he was concerned that Lawrence Taylor might hold out: "He's only the best 
player we've got. It wouldn't bother me at all." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Bobby Unser, in 1968, 1975 and 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Raider executive Al LoCasale, on the reacquisition of former Navy 
running back Napoleon McCallum from the San Diego Chargers: "It's an 
unbelievable deal for us. When we traded him, he was an ensign. Now we get him 
back as a lieutenant." HARLEY TINKHAM

COLOGNE, REAL MADRID LOOK IMPRESSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All too often when big-name soccer teams visit the United States for a series 
of exhibitions, the players treat it as a holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Not so on Thursday night at the Coliseum. Cologne of West Germany and Real 
Madrid of Spain, even in defeat, turned in performances worthy of their 
position as two of the leading clubs in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The West Germans looked particularly impressive -- or at least motivated -- 
coming back from a goal deficit to defeat a Central American all-star team, 
5-1, in the first game of a doubleheader before a lively crowd of 44,592. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd was so lively, in fact, that several hundred fans invaded the field 
before the start of the nightcap to mob Hugo Sanchez, who stars for both his 
club team, Real Madrid, and his national team, Mexico. It took at least 15 
minutes for order to be restored. 
</P>
<P>
The game lived up to its billing, with Mexico winning, 3-1, on goals by Gonzalo 
Farfan in the 15th minute, Ricardo Pelaez in the 30th and Zaquino in the 66th. 
Real Madrid's goal was scored by Sanchez in the 28th minute. 
</P>
<P>
In the opener, Cologne took the initiative from the start, with forward Uwe 
Rahn's shot flashing just wide of the right post in the first minute. But it 
was the Central American team that scored first. 
</P>
<P>
An excellent move by forward Raul Chacon on the right wing resulted in teammate 
Sergio Rivera, from Guatemala, firing the ball past German goalkeeper Volker 
Diergardt in the 12th minute. Undeterred, Cologne came right back, with Rahn 
again just wide on a shot a minute later. 
</P>
<P>
The West Germans tied the score, then took the lead, with three goals in an 
11-minute spell midway through the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Hugo Perez, the El Salvador-born U.S. national team player, came on in the 
second half for the Central Americans and, although still showing a lack of 
match fitness due to recovery from a broken leg, nevertheless underlined once 
again why he should not have been left off the U.S. World Cup squad.

Vince Coleman was hoping to get a hit so he could steal second base and put the 
winning run in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
He got a hit all right, but he didn't have to run it out when the ball cleared 
the fence with two out in the 12th inning Thursday to give the St. Louis 
Cardinals a 3-2 victory over the San Francisco Giants at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of those things you dream about," Coleman said. "You want to be that 
hero. A jubilating feeling goes over your body when you're on the basepaths." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman hit his second home run of the season over the left-field wall off 
reliever Ed Vosberg (0-1) to end the longest game either team has played this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman went three for four with two walks and a stolen base on a pitchout. He 
had two triples Wednesday night and is 11 for 23 against the Giants this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"Coleman's a hell of a weapon," Giant Manager Roger Craig said after San 
Francisco lost for the fifth time in six games. "He can beat you in a lot of 
ways." 
</P>
<P>
Frank DiPino (1-0), the fifth St. Louis pitcher, got the last out in the top of 
the 12th to pick up the victory. DiPino is 10-0 over the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants tied the score, 2-2, in the eighth on Robby Thompson's two-out 
double off reliever Ken Dayley. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Guerrero singled home two runs for the Cardinals in the first against Don 
Robinson, who made his first start of the season following knee surgery in the 
off-season. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 5, New York 4 -- Andy Benes held New York to three hits in seven 
innings and drove in two runs with a pair of singles as the Padres knocked off 
the Mets and Frank Viola at New York. 
</P>
<P>
Benes (4-4) allowed three runs in the fifth inning when Daryl Boston hit a solo 
home run and Gregg Jefferies hit a two-run shot. 
</P>
<P>
Viola (7-2) lost his second game in a row to the Padres, lasting 3 1/3 innings, 
his shortest outing of the season. He gave up all five runs -- four earned -- 
and eight hits. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 7, Montreal 1 -- Ron Robinson scattered four hits over six shutout 
innings and the Reds snapped the Expos' four-game winning streak at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson (2-1) struck out two and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Hatcher had three singles and a double for Cincinnati, 15-4 on the road, 
which broke a scoreless tie with four runs in the fourth against Kevin Gross 
(5-3). 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 8, Atlanta 4 -- Von Hayes snapped a six-for-31 slump with a homer, 
triple and single and drove in four runs as the Phillies beat the Braves at 
Philadelphia for their third consecutive win. 
</P>
<P>
Lenny Dykstra had three hits for the Phillies, raising his average to .411, 
tops in the majors.

CANSECO RAISING THE PRICE OF HIS SIGNATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every day the Oakland Athletics waste trying to sign Jose Canseco may be 
costing them money. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco hit two more home runs and Dave Stewart won his eighth game as the A's 
defeated the Milwaukee Brewers, 13-1, Thursday at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Canseco said he would like to sign a new contract within 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll stay here as long as they want me," Canseco said. "(Signing now) is good 
business sense because I want to play for the A's. I want to show good faith. I 
wouldn't mind signing a 10-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to stay with Oakland the rest of my career. I'd like to set and break 
records here for the fans. But if A's make it extremely difficult, then I can't 
stay here. The longer (negotiating) goes on the more difficult this is going to 
be." 
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old slugger has a one-year, $2-million contract and is eligible to 
become a free agent after the 1991 season. 
</P>
<P>
His agent, Dennis Gilbert of Beverly Hills, and Oakland General Manager Sandy 
Alderson have already begun discussions on a long-term deal. 
</P>
<P>
"We've approached them (with a proposal) and they've made a counter-offer," 
Canseco said. "We're working it out right now." 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert declined to comment other than to say, "We expect when Jose signs he 
will be the best-paid player in baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Canseco said the Athletics could have signed him 3 1/2 months ago "for 
peanuts." He said he was asking for less than the four-year, $15-million deal 
Will Clark signed with the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Against the Brewers, Canseco had four hits, including his 16th and 17th homers 
to tie Cecil Fielder of the Detroit Tigers for the major league lead. Canseco 
drove in three runs to give him 43, tops in the majors, and scored four runs to 
lead the majors with 36. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco, who is batting .331, has nine home runs and 22 RBIs in his last 12 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"He's hot, but does that make (a contract agreement) any more urgent?" Alderson 
said. "I don't think so. We've said for a number of weeks now that we'd like 
Jose to be an Oakland Athletic for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Felix Jose also had three RBIs and Dave Henderson had four hits and drove in 
two runs. 
</P>

MARY BUDKE WINS WOMEN'S CITY GOLF TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were no crowds at Rancho Park Golf Course Thursday -- no galleries of 
fans following the leaders on the final day of the Los Angeles City Women's 
Golf Championships. 
</P>
<P>
But the lack of attention didn't detract from the fact that the women who 
played in the 67th annual tournament are some of the best golfers in the 
Southland. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Budke, 36, an emergency physician who won the U.S. Amateur title 18 years 
ago, shot a 75 in the final round for a total of 224 to win the title by four 
strokes. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my second golf career," said Budke, who plays at Oakmont Country Club 
and lives in South Pasadena. "I won the U.S. Amateur (in 1972) and the 
collegiate individual (while at Oregon State in 1974) and played on the World 
Cup team, then went on to medical school. I didn't play at all from 1980-86, 
and when I started again, I played so badly, I couldn't break 95 for years." 
</P>
<P>
While Budke is on her second golf career, Heidi Voorhees, 17, a senior at Notre 
Dame High School in Sherman Oaks, is preparing for her first. Voorhees, who 
played in Budke's group, began the day six strokes off the pace and made it 
interesting on the back nine, where she had three birdies and eagled No. 15. 
She shot a 73 to finish in second place with a total of 228. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be a long night," Voorhees said. "I have grad night at 
Disneyland, a Mass, and then I graduate the next day." 
</P>
<P>
Voorhees will attend USC in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Claudine Rubin of Woodland Hills Country Club shot a 79 to finish third at 230. 
</P>
<P>
City Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Park's Terri Melanson, the City defending champion, shot an 85 in the 
opening round and, despite her subsequent 74 and 75, finished fourth at 234. . 
. . She was followed by Linda Pearson of La Canada Country Club at 236 and 
Sylvia Kim of Wood Ranch Country Club at 238. . . . Jennifer Choi, a 
17-year-old senior at Beverly Hills High School who will attend UCLA next fall, 
was tied for seventh place at 241 with Laree Sugg, a junior at UCLA.

Larry Mize and Wayne Grady had eagle-3s to highlight rounds of six-under-par 66 
and share the first-round lead with upstart Steve Lowery in the Atlanta Golf 
Classic Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Mize, winless since taking the 1987 Masters, chipped in from 35 feet for his 
eagle on the 548-yard 11th and Grady, winner of last year's Westchester 
Classic, rolled in a 25-foot putt on the 499-yard 18th. 
</P>
<P>
Lowery, who lost his card when he finished 157th on the money list in 1988, 
played a bogey-free round, parring his last eight holes. His longest birdie 
putt was a 20-footer on No. 16. 
</P>
<P>
The trio had a two-shot lead over 10 others after an ideal day for scoring on 
the 7,018-yard Atlanta Country Club course. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa's Nick Price, who tied for second last week in the Colonial, and 
Scott Hoch, who lost the Masters in a playoff last year, headed the group at 
68. 
</P>
<P>
Non-winner Lisa Walters birdied her last three holes to join six other players 
in a tie for the lead after the first round of the LPGA Corning (N.Y.) Classic. 
</P>
<P>
Walters, Judy Dickinson, Trish Johnson, Tammie Green, Diana Heinicke-Rauch, 
Cathy Johnston, and Alice Ritzman all shot three-under-par 68s on their first 
trip around the 6,006-yard Corning Country Club Course. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Bradley, Kris Monaghan, Marianne Morris and Robin Hood were one shot back 
at 69.

HOLLYWOOD AGENCY ADDS NEW TWIST TO BIDDING ON STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a bizarre twist on Hollywood's tradition of hard-nosed deal making, a major 
talent agency on Thursday claimed credit for driving down the price paid to one 
of its top clients. 
</P>
<P>
Creative Artists Agency, bucking current trends, said it discouraged a bidding 
war over the screen rights to author Michael Crichton's upcoming science 
fiction thriller "Jurassic Park" in order to exert more control over the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
The novel still fetched a handsome $1.5 million from Universal Pictures in a 
deal that guarantees director Steven Spielberg's participation. Crichton will 
also receive $500,000 to write the screenplay and a percentage of the film's 
profits. But CAA said it could have gotten more. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a large number of studios and directors interested," said Robert 
Bookman, Crichton's agent. "But we wanted to put Michael in a situation where 
he could choose from among competing directors rather than competing studios. 
And a bidding war means you have to take the highest bid." 
</P>
<P>
Others who tried to acquire the film rights to Crichton's soon-to-be-published 
book -- about the havoc that results from the genetic re-creation of dinosaurs 
-- confirmed that the manuscript alone could have commanded $2 million. 
Tri-Star Pictures Chairman Mike Medavoy, one of those interested in the 
manuscript, said he viewed Crichton's book as a top prospect. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's true" that they could have gotten more for the novel, Medavoy 
said. "Maybe not a lot more, but more. There was a lot of interest. We're sorry 
we missed it." 
</P>
<P>
CAA's strategy in selling "Jurassic Park" is not unprecedented, especially when 
a specific author wants to work with a specific filmmaker. Even writer Shane 
Black, whose "The Last Boy Scout" fetched $1.75 million in a bidding war that 
sent shock waves through Hollywood, rejected a slightly higher bid in order to 
chose his studio. 
</P>
<P>
CAA has traditionally discouraged its clients from engaging in such bidding 
wars, believing that they are bad for business and for their clients' long-term 
careers. But those familiar with movie rights fees for books said Crichton's 
deal still ranks as one of Hollywood's sweetest. International Creative 
Management agent Jeff Berg negotiated an unprecedented $2-million deal for 
client Peter Benchley's "The Island" in 1978, but most top books fetch less, 
even today. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Crichton's deal said the best-selling author and occasional 
director, who is known for such spine-tingling works as "The Andromeda Strain" 
and "The Terminal Man," helped determine how "Jurassic Park" would be peddled. 
Crichton's primary interest was in finding a director who could "execute his 
vision," one source near the deal explained. 
</P>
<P>
CAA offered Crichton's manuscript, which will be published by Alfred A. Knopf 
Inc. in October, to its usual list of major clients on Monday, according to 
sources. The first offer was about $500,000, but CAA set a target price of $1.5 
million, based on what other major books have fetched in recent years and on 
Crichton's expectations. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for meeting its price, CAA promised that it would not "shop around" 
competing offers and encourage a bidding war. 
</P>
<P>
Crichton then helped narrow the choices to Warner Bros, which offered up 
"Batman" director Tim Burton and producer Joel Silver; Columbia/Tri-Star, which 
weighed in with Richard Donner and Guber-Peters Entertainment Co.; 20th Century 
Fox, with Joe Dante and Sandollar Productions, and Universal, with Spielberg 
directing for his Amblin Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
All four met CAA's demand of $1.5 million for the project, which is expected to 
cost $40 million to $50 million to make, sources said. CAA promised an answer 
by Wednesday, but Crichton opted to "sleep on it" before deciding he was most 
comfortable with Spielberg and Universal. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Tri-Star, the studios in final competition for "Jurassic 
Park," refused to comment on the sale. One leading Hollywood executive, who 
asked not to be identified, said he found it unusual that the agency was 
publicizing such a deal. But he added that it may reflect a growing backlash 
against out-of-control costs that have concerned many Hollywood executives. 
</P>
<P>
Spielberg has committed to making "Jurassic Park" his next project.

ECONOMIC GROWTH ESTIMATE CUT BACK TO A STAGNANT 1.3% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By OSWALD JOHNSTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government on Thursday lowered its estimate of economic growth during the 
first quarter to a sluggish annual rate of 1.3%, well below the 2.1% estimate 
reported a month ago and a confirmation of the near-stagnation that set in late 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
But economists took some comfort in the fact that a larger-than-expected 
reduction of inventories, mostly on auto lots, accounted for virtually the 
whole downward revision in gross national product reported by the Commerce 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
They also noted that the revised statistics masked a big increase in U.S. 
exports and that demand for U.S. goods and services increased at a healthy 
annual rate of 4.1% -- signals of a possible economic rebound later in the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government reported that a key measure of inflation tied 
to the gross national product hit an unpleasantly high annual rate of 6.7% in 
the first quarter. That was up from the 6.5% rate reported a month ago, when 
complete data for the quarter was not in hand. 
</P>
<P>
But the negative numbers had been generally anticipated, and economists found 
much to cheer in the Commerce Department report because inventory shrinkage in 
one quarter usually heralds production expansion the next. 
</P>
<P>
"That 1.3% growth is pretty feeble," said economist Bruce Steinberg of Merrill 
Lynch &amp; Co. in New York. "But with final sales up at more than 4%, you had 
a sharp inventory liquidation that suggests a considerable rebound in the 
second quarter . . . mostly from inventory rebuilding." 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all of the downward revision in GNP was the result of a decline in 
business inventories, as manufacturers shut down production to offset sluggish 
sales. Retail inventories plunged at an annual rate of $26.6 billion in 
inflation-adjusted 1982 dollars, with the troubled auto industry alone 
accounting for $23.2 billion of that. 
</P>
<P>
Economists agreed that the inventory reduction should be followed by stronger 
growth later this year to bring supplies more in balance with demand, both in 
domestic markets and overseas. 
</P>
<P>
"Inventory is the key here," said Cynthia Latta of Data Resources Inc. in 
Lexington, Mass. "There was a much bigger runoff reported this time than the 
first time around, and that should be good for production in the second and 
third quarters. Since there are fewer goods on the shelves than we supposed, 
there is going to have to be more current production." 
</P>
<P>
The consensus among economists is that demand will remain fairly steady, with 
economic growth following a sluggish but steady path in the 2% to 2.5% range. 
</P>
<P>
"Inventory pullbacks like this almost never come before a recession, which is 
usually signaled by the opposite -- an inventory overhang," observed Giulio 
Martini, an economist with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's also rare to see inventory liquidations like this late in an economic 
expansion," he added. "Normally you get it during the first quarter of a 
recovery, when a big burst of demand draws them down." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. exports increased at an annual rate of 7.7%, or $11.3 billion in 1982 
dollars, compared to an original first-quarter estimate of 0.9%, or $1.4 
billion. Imports increased 2.7%, or $4.4 billion, compared to a previously 
estimated decline of 2.8%, or $4.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The net result was an improvement in the nation's trade balance of $6.8 
billion, compared to the $6-billion gain estimated earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Economists mostly shrugged off the inflation figure. Significant inflation in 
goods has been evident from the beginning of the year. Most of it has been 
attributed to weather-related factors, primarily higher fuel and food prices, 
which have since begun to reverse. 
</P>
<P>
In a companion report issued Thursday, the Commerce Department said that 
after-tax profits of U.S. corporations increased only 0.2% during the first 
quarter after rising 2.8% in the October-December quarter of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Profits from current production rose 0.7%, after a 3.2% decline, while cash 
flow from current production fell 2.3%, after a 0.3% decline. 
</P>
<P>
The figures reflected general economic sluggishness and underscored the slow 
growth and inventory liquidation noted in the GNP report.

CONSUMER AFFAIRS: SUNTAN OIL HUNT CAN GET UNDER YOUR SKIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S.J. DIAMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's no such thing anymore as a simple suntan lotion -- something to slather 
on oneself and the kids for a day at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, if one dares go to the beach at all, there's sunscreen and sun block, 
waterproof, sweat-proof and PABA-free, with SPFs of 8, 15, even 50, broad 
spectrum protection against UVB, UVA, IR and Lord knows what other initials. 
Those who choose too casually accept terrible risks -- from wrinkles to skin 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
In lieu of working through all the gobbledygook, one Los Angeles pool buff, 
seeking assurance of mildness, buys "the ones that have pictures of babies on 
them." Another shrugs, "I just go for a high number and a nice smell." 
</P>
<P>
This is a field in which the advertising offers beautiful models or 
pseudo-science or both, the science is still emergent, the government authority 
is the slow-moving Food and Drug Administration, and the consumer market is 
oddly schizophrenic. Half of the sun-care products sold promote tanning, and 
the other half prevent it. And as the market grows, particularly the prevention 
side, new products are rushed out and new promises made so regularly that there 
are constantly new safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
In the good old days, there was just suntan lotion, generally oily stuff that 
aided tanning. Then it was discovered that sun actually harmed skin, speeding 
aging and increasing the risk, and incidence, of skin cancers and malignant 
melanomas. 
</P>
<P>
Enter sunscreens. Some were physical screens ("sun blocks"), coating skin with 
opaque, almost impermeable goo. Some were chemical ("sunscreens"), absorbing 
certain ultraviolet, or UV, rays -- particularly the UVB rays located in the 
middle of the ultraviolet spectrum, the ones considered the cause of burns. 
</P>
<P>
UVB burn was combatted by a number of ingredients of various strengths 
expressed by a "sun protection factor" (or SPF) -- the multiple by which one 
could increase exposure without burning. Someone who burns in 10 minutes, for 
example, can use an SPF15 and stay out 150 minutes or 2 1/2 hours. SPF15, in 
fact, was considered effective against most UVB rays. 
</P>
<P>
The ensuing hoopla, heavy on claims, led the FDA to convene panels of experts 
to study the issue (slowly). They published their findings in an "Advanced 
Notice of Proposed Rule Making" in August, 1978. That document, still the Bible 
on sunscreens because it was the last word handed down, described the known 
dangers of sun exposure, categorized ingredients as to safety and 
effectiveness, analyzed SPF numbers up to 15 and described appropriate tests 
for their effectiveness, and spelled out permissible labeling. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, times change. Ultraviolet A rays, believed not to cause burns, turn out 
to be a problem as well, particularly in increasing the risk of cancer: "It's 
clear UVA has several roles, but exactly how it acts is unknown," says Los 
Angeles dermatologist Anita Highton, director of UCLA's Dermatology and 
Phototherapy Center. 
</P>
<P>
No matter. Sunscreens have begun to advertise UVA blocking, including, say FDA 
warnings, misleading "numerical claims similar to SPF factors." Some advertise 
"broad spectrum" protection, implying protection that covers the full range of 
UVB and extends into the UVA range. 
</P>
<P>
As it happens, the FDA hasn't yet produced its sunscreen rule, a mere dozen 
years having passed since it was said to be coming. The agency will therefore 
add UVA to the consideration, rushing through a "tentative final monograph," or 
proposed rule, by the end of this year, and anticipating a final final 
monograph by 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the FDA handles current claims and advertising with advisory letters 
saying that a company can advertise UVA protection if its product tests 
effective up to a given UVA wavelength. However, there are as yet no 
FDA-certified testing procedures for UVA sunscreens, so all such claims are 
"unsubstantiated" and "unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
As if the issue weren't confused enough, there are added complications. For 
starters, there is one product whose manufacturer has made UVA-protection 
claims that have FDA approval -- Photoplex, from Herbert Laboratories, the 
dermatology division of Allergan, Inc. Instead of waiting for the general rules 
to come out, Herbert Laboratories filed a separate new-drug application for 
Photoplex's UVA-screening ingredient. It was approved. The company will aim its 
marketing at doctors and pharmacists. 
</P>
<P>
There's also new disagreement about the optimal SPF. Sunscreen marketers, 
naturally assuming that if 15 is good, 30 or 50 is better, rushed into what 
detractors call an SPF "horsepower race" or "numbers game." But there's some 
question now whether an SPF above 15 adds much extra UVB screening. There also 
is a fear that it encourages people to linger in the sun, thus exposing 
themselves to more UVA, infrared rays and whatever else is next found harmful. 
Moreover, even if a higher SPF further protects the skin from sun, it also 
irritates it more with chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, several ingredients are already revealed to be serious allergens and 
one a possible carcinogen. Those not currently suspect may surface some years 
hence as causing bladder cancer in rats. It's that kind of product. 
</P>
<P>
Let's get real. These are only sunburn lotions, for most people purely 
recreational aids, and scarcely the only protection available. There are also 
hats, close-weave T-shirts, loose pants. "If someone's extremely sensitive and 
burns immediately," says Highton, "they should avoid the sun instead of trying 
to increase the amount of time they can stay in it." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone else awaiting the definitive word can just go for a high number and a 
nice smell.

BOESKY TELLS OF ILLEGAL TIPS FROM MILKEN; 
</P>
<P>
WALL STREET: THE FORMER INSIDE TRADER ALSO SAYS HE BROKE FEDERAL LAW BY PAYING 
FELLOW PRISON INMATES TO DO HIS LAUNDRY.

<P>
Ivan F. Boesky gave the first public evidence Thursday that former Drexel 
Burnham Lambert junk bond chief Michael Milken had illegally fed him inside 
information about stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by a defense lawyer in the trial of John A. Mulheren Jr. to name all of 
the people who had given him illegal inside tips, Boesky said "Mr. Milken comes 
to mind." 
</P>
<P>
But Boesky, formerly one of Wall Street's leading speculators in takeover 
stocks, said he didn't know how much money he had made from the information 
Milken had passed to him. "I haven't made a compilation, sir," Boesky said. 
</P>
<P>
Milken pleaded guilty to six felony counts last month and is awaiting 
sentencing. Several of the counts related to transactions with Boesky. None of 
them, however, had to do with inside trading, a point which Milken's lawyers 
and press spokesman strongly emphasized at the time. Milken's spokesman has 
long denied that Milken leaked inside information or traded on it himself, 
although he was accused of it in an indictment that has since been dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Lerer, Milken's spokesman, said Thursday that he wouldn't comment on 
Boesky's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Boesky, 53, was excused Thursday after testifying for two and a half days as 
the main prosecution witness in Mulheren's trial. Like Boesky, Mulheren was a 
stock arbitrager. Mulheren faces federal criminal charges of securities fraud 
and conspiracy related to his business dealings with Boesky. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony about Milken was elicited by Mulheren's lawyer, Thomas Puccio, who 
attempted to demolish Boesky's credibility by showing that he had lied 
repeatedly under oath and engaged in extensive illegal activities. Boesky said 
Milken was the only individual he remembered leaking him inside information 
besides the two he had already named, former investment bankers Dennis Levine 
and Martin A. Siegel. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the grueling cross-examination, however, Boesky claimed that he 
couldn't remember names, details or specific amounts of money. He said he 
couldn't recall which companies Milken had leaked information about. 
</P>
<P>
Boesky's nearly total inability to recall amounts of money at times appeared to 
stymie Puccio. The defense lawyer is attempting to show that Boesky has 
considerable personal wealth left despite the $100 million in penalties Boesky 
paid when he pleaded guilty to a single felony count. The defense theory is 
that Boesky's agreement with the government to turn in others enabled him to 
keep a big part of his wealth. 
</P>
<P>
Boesky claimed that the huge volume of stock trading he did -- up to 300 
million shares a year -- made it difficult for him to recall how much money he 
made on any deal. Asked if he had made $57 million in profit after receiving an 
inside tip about Getty Oil in the early 1980s, Boesky said he didn't remember. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't it true that if you made in the neighborhood of $57 million on a certain 
stock it would stick out in your mind?" Puccio asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it would necessarily stick out in my memory," Boesky said. 
</P>
<P>
Boesky also said he couldn't recall whether he had transferred assets to his 
wife and children when the government began investigating him in 1986 to reduce 
the amount of money the government could seize from him. "I do not recall my 
financial activities in 1986," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But under close questioning, Boesky did recall that he was able to deduct from 
his 1986 taxes half of the $100-million penalty he paid. 
</P>
<P>
Puccio said outside the courtroom that one possible reason for Boesky's 
apparent severe memory problems is his concern about the many civil lawsuits he 
faces. Boesky has testified that he faces more than $1 billion in civil claims 
filed by people and companies that contend they were defrauded by his illegal 
activities. Anything Boesky said on the witness stand in the Mulheren trial 
could be used against him in the civil lawsuits. A lawyer for Boesky failed to 
return a telephone call asking for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Boesky also said he had broken federal law during the 19 months he had spent as 
an inmate at the minimum-security federal prison camp in Lompoc by paying 
fellow inmates to do his laundry. A spokesman for the federal Bureau of Prisons 
said in a phone interview that hiring fellow inmates would have violated prison 
rules, although the spokesman said he wasn't certain what law it might have 
violated. 
</P>
<P>
Puccio also asked Boesky if he had bribed officials at the prison, including 
one of the wardens. Boesky strongly denied it. 
</P>
<P>
While answering questions from reporters later, Puccio refused to say if he had 
any evidence that Boesky had committed bribery. The prisons spokesman said: "We 
have no knowledge of any bribes occurring in this facility with any staff 
member." 
</P>
<P>
In court, Puccio had intimated that when Boesky was sentenced in 1987, he had 
given false information to the sentencing judge that the $100-million penalty 
would leave him nearly bankrupt. Puccio refused to say afterwards if he plans 
to introduce evidence later in the trial showing that Boesky had lied on that 
point.

MAJOR U.S. AIRLINES SLICE SUMMER FARES; 
</P>
<P>
TRAVEL: OTHER CARRIERS MATCH OR BEAT A DISCOUNT COUPON THAT UNITED INAUGURATED.

The lure of a larger share of the vacation travel market has led the nation's 
big airlines to break with tradition and discount some of their domestic ticket 
prices during the busy summer season. 
</P>
<P>
United Airlines said Thursday it will meet the reductions of competitors who 
dropped prices in response to a $35 United coupon offered Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The coupon is good on round-trip tickets of $175 or more. 
</P>
<P>
Trans World Airlines cut some domestic round-trip fares Tuesday by up to 30%, 
and American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, USAir and Continental Airlines 
announced Wednesday that they also were lowering prices. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts say that, so far, the fare cuts pose little danger to the 
companies' earnings. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some diminishing returns, as far as profitability, but you don't 
give up market share to someone else," said Paul H. Nisbet, an analyst with 
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
If the war escalates, earnings could become a casualty, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Neidl, an analyst with Dillon, Read &amp; Co., was surprised that 
airlines were offering discounts so early in the vacation season. 
</P>
<P>
United's coupons are good through Dec. 14, excluding Nov. 16-30. The offer 
requires a Saturday night stay, and tickets must be bought seven days in 
advance of departure and no later than Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
United, which American surpassed last year as the nation's biggest carrier in 
terms of traffic, was "looking for a recouping of that market share," Nisbet 
said. 
</P>
<P>
TWA responded by cutting domestic round-trip fares up to 30% for travel Tuesday 
through Thursday. TWA also is requiring a Saturday night stay and seven-day 
advance purchase. Tickets must be purchased by June 7. The discount is good for 
flights through Dec. 13. 
</P>
<P>
Under TWA's discounts, the lowest coast-to-coast fares fall to $298 from 
$428.50. 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions place the lower fares out of peak periods for business travel, 
the carriers' most lucrative market.

FRAUD CASE MAY HINGE ON MUFFLED AUDIOTAPES;

<P>
Now that everyone has to wait at least until next fall to find out who killed 
Laura Palmer on "Twin Peaks," here's a real-life mystery to ponder: What's on 
those tapes they are playing in the first big trial in Chicago's 
highly-publicized commodities fraud case? 
</P>
<P>
The 130 audiotapes, recorded in 1988 by undercover FBI agent Randall Jannett 
while he was posing as a crooked trader in the Swiss franc pit of the Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange, are at the heart of the government's fraud case against 
three Swiss franc currency traders and brokers, the first group of traders to 
be brought to trial in the federal government's wide-ranging probe of fraud and 
corruption on Chicago's two big commodities exchanges, the Mercantile Exchange 
and the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
Jannett, the prosecution's star witness against currency broker Robert Mosky 
and traders Danny Scheck and David Zatz, has testified at length during the 
first two weeks of the trial that the secret recordings he made show Mosky, 
Scheck, Zatz and others in the pit conspiring to bilk their distant customers 
by skimming profits off of trades. 
</P>
<P>
In highly complex and detailed testimony, Jannett, an agent with an accounting 
background who worked undercover in the Swiss franc pit for 10 months in 1988, 
has attempted to catalogue instances in which Mosky and his allies made quiet 
deals in private conversations while they stood in the middle of the trading 
pit, conversations which they hoped would be masked by the chaotic noise from 
the hectic trading activity going on around them. 
</P>
<P>
They were right; their conversations were masked, even from Jannett's tape 
recorder. In fact, it has become increasingly clear as the trial has progressed 
and the government has played the first of Jannett's nearly inaudible tapes, 
that the content of those recorded conversations will be the central issue in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
On each tape played so far, it has been almost impossible for the untrained ear 
to pick out what Mosky and his allies are saying underneath the roar of the 
trading activity. So far, the only way for the jury to understand the tapes has 
been to read along on transcripts of the conversations while they listen. 
</P>
<P>
Now, attorneys for Mosky and the others say, they plan to center their defense 
on the assertion that Jannett misunderstood what the traders were saying among 
themselves in the special shorthand of the commodities markets. When the 
defense opens its cross-examination of Jannett, which will probably come next 
week, it will argue that the traders were talking quietly among themselves 
merely to double-check earlier trades made through the exchange's normal open 
outcry system. Rather than cutting secret deals, they were simply catching up 
with earlier work in the frenzied, and still non-computerized, trading pit. 
"They were just checking, checking each other's work," said Harvey Silets, an 
attorney for Scheck. 
</P>
<P>
Silets opened his counter-attack on Jannett's testimony this week, when he 
submitted a transcript of one of Jannett's tapes that conflicted significantly 
with the government's version. U.S. District Judge Ann Williams allowed the 
jury to listen to the taped conversation twice, once while reading along with 
the government's transcript, and a second time with the defense version. 
</P>
<P>
Silets provided a far more detailed transcript, one which identified more 
voices in the background, and which provided much greater context for the 
conversations. In one key tape from March 17, 1988, Silets' version is six 
pages long, compared to just two for the government's transcript. The defense 
version also attributes some critical comments to different people than in the 
government version. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the government transcript shows Mosky forcing another trader to 
accept a non-competitive, secret deal; the understanding being that the 
opposite trader will make up his losses on another secret deal later. But in 
the defense version, the conversation shows a deal that is much less one-sided, 
with both traders appearing to amicably agree on the terms of their trade. 
</P>
<P>
With the tapes virtually impossible to understand without a transcript, the 
defense may score important points if it can persuade the jury that appearances 
can be deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
A TALE OF TWO TRANSCRIPTS 
</P>
<P>
Below are partial transcripts of a tape recording from trading activity in the 
Swiss franc pit at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on March 17, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The beginning of the conversation shows what the government contends is a 
secret, non-competitive trade, with Robert Mosky dictating unfavorable terms to 
Mark Fuhrman (nicknamed "Furball"). 
</P>
<P>
But the defense version has Fuhrman responding directly to Mosky ("A hundred 
away") and seeming to cooperate in a more mutually beneficial deal. 
</P>
<P>
Government's Version: 
</P>
<P>
Robert Mosky: Hey, take this sh . . . hey Furball, take this. It's a hundred 
away. I sold you two at sixty.

Keating Sues Government: Beleaguered Arizona businessman Charles H. Keating Jr. 
and top executives of his bankrupt American Continental Corp. sued the federal 
government for $300 million, claiming that regulators wrongly took the 
company's property -- its Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan subsidiary -- and 
destroyed it. The suit, filed in U.S. Claims Court in Washington, is similar to 
one American Continental filed a year ago after regulators seized the 
Irvine-based thrift.

Resorts Reorganization Gets OK: Resorts International, the Merv Griffin casino 
company now operating in bankruptcy court, announced that its creditor 
committees have approved a reorganization plan. The plan calls for sharply 
reducing the face value of Resorts' long-term debt while giving bondholders a 
major equity stake in the company. Resorts, whose principal asset is its casino 
in Atlantic City, expects to emerge from bankruptcy this summer.

-based Motorola for mobile telephone networks. The technology will change 
sounds into digital code, then back into voice. While the move "enhances" 
Motorola's chance to sell its speech coders for use in cellular telephones, the

SMALL BUSINESS: EVEN AT TINIEST COMPANIES, SAFETY PAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Bruce Hunter, service manager for Mike Thompson's R.V. Center in Santa Fe 
Springs, knew he might have a problem if a state Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration inspector visited his body shop. His technicians were sanding 
and shaping fiberglass and metal without protective respirators. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter's problem was solved when he bought a $900 respirator system. He acted 
in the nick of time. 
</P>
<P>
"Less than a month after I bought the system, the Cal/OSHA inspector arrived 
and was really impressed with our respirator setup," said Hunter, who also 
ordered industrial first-aid kits and oxygen bottles in case anyone has a heart 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
Small-business owners may think that they are too busy to worry about workplace 
safety, but a single major accident can virtually cripple a small company. 
Apart from the costs of workers' compensation benefits and medical bills, a key 
worker's absence can be devastating. 
</P>
<P>
The financial impact of workplace accidents is staggering. Each year, U.S. 
businesses lose an estimated $42 billion to work-related illness and injuries, 
according to the National Safety Council. Most on-the-job injuries are caused 
by improper lifting, straining and twisting. Hitting or being hit by an object 
is the second most common cause of injuries. Falls rank third, with 
machine-related accidents fourth, the council says. 
</P>
<P>
"Employees are demanding safer work environments," said Tom McKevitt, president 
of Respond Industries of Denver, which has distributors in 23 states. "When 
employers provide first-aid and pharmaceutical supplies, they find attendance 
and productivity improves." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Bray, vice president of direct operations for Zee Medical of Irvine, said 
his staff tries to help small-business owners cope with the growing number of 
workplace regulations. He said Zee, which sells oxygen bottles, first-aid kits 
and other equipment, also offers a free on-site analysis to business owners 
with no obligation to buy. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to bring them as up to speed as we can and make recommendations as to 
what they can do," said Bray. He said the company, which serves about 300,000 
businesses in 50 states, offers a full accident-management program, including 
training classes for employees. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Schafer, facilities manager for Cassette Productions in Irwindale, said he 
recently asked Zee to set up an earthquake preparedness and emergency first-aid 
class for 10 of the audio cassette duplication company's 75 employees. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not only meeting the OSHA regulations but keeping our employees safe," 
said Schafer. 
</P>
<P>
OSHA requires all businesses to make first-aid supplies available to all 
employees and to post safety instructions and warning signs. The rules also 
call for businesses to keep a record of all workplace accidents in a log called 
the "200 log." 
</P>
<P>
First-aid and safety supplies are not as expensive as you might think. A small 
business with 50 employees can buy enough basic first-aid supplies for about 
$250 a year. Adding an oxygen bottle and a stretcher increases the cost to 
about $500. 
</P>
<P>
The success of any safety program depends on the total involvement of the 
owner. Even the smallest company can create a safety committee. 
</P>
<P>
The National Safety Council, an established, not-for-profit organization based 
in Chicago, has thousands of booklets, posters, books and training materials 
available to business owners and others. The group also has offices in Foster 
City, Calif., and Syracuse, N.Y. For information write to: John Kaplafka, NSC, 
444 N. Michigan Ave., Chicago, Ill. 60611. Or phone (312) 527-4800. 
</P>
<P>
California business owners can call Cal/OSHA for free help from a safety 
consultant. Unless the problem is life-threatening, the consultants are 
prohibited from giving any information to the agency's compliance officers. 
Cal/OSHA consultants are based in five offices. For information or an 
appointment call:

department. 
</P>
<P>
Make plans to correct the hazards before an accident occurs. 
</P>
<P>
Develop ways to comply with all state and local health and safety regulations. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Make sure you have a fully stocked first-aid kit near each work area. 
</P>
<P>
Post the address and phone number of the nearest hospital or clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Offer your workers classes in first-aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
(CPR). 
</P>
<P>
Keep track of how many work days were missed due to accidents or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Schedule regular safety meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Prepare a written safety plan and circulate it to all employees. 
</P>
<P>
Offer incentives for improved safety records, such as prizes or bonuses for 
accident-free months.

CARTER HAWLEY HALE'S LOSS IS LARGER THAN FORECAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carter Hawley Hale Stores, hurt by flat sales at its department stores, on 
Thursday posted a bigger-than-expected loss of $6.6 million for the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles company, parent of the Broadway and other retail chains, lost 
$3.2 million during the same quarter a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Its stock fell 12.5 cents on the news, closing at a 52-week low of $5 on the 
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Carter Hawley has been losing money in every quarter except the one that 
includes the Christmas shopping season -- largely a result of the debt it took 
on three years ago to thwart a takeover attempt. Along with hefty interest 
expenses, it was hurt in the quarter ended April 29 by weak revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Sales totaled $590.9 million, up 0.8% from a year earlier. Among stores open 
for all of the past year, the increase in sales was just 0.3%. 
</P>
<P>
The company attributed its sales performance partly to its decision to hold 
down expenses instead of taking part in the rampant price-cutting that many 
retailers are engaging in. 
</P>
<P>
N. Richard Nelson, an analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago, said the 
quarterly report prompted him to lower his 1990 earnings estimate for Carter 
Hawley to around $9.1 million from $10.4 million. Still, he said, Carter Hawley 
is in better shape than some of its debt-heavy competitors. 
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of the fiscal year, the company lost $480,000 on 
sales that climbed 4.6% to $2.23 billion. The year-to-date results were hurt by 
a charge of $10.5 million taken to cover expenses from the October earthquake 
in the Bay Area.

SMALL WINERIES BEAT GIANTS, KILL MARKETING PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
California's small, premium wineries won a major victory over industry giants 
Thursday by voting the California Wine Commission out of existence. The 
commission is the major marketing tool of the state's $6-billion wine industry. 
</P>
<P>
The members' vote was 125-111 against retaining the commission for five more 
years. In a separate vote, wineries representing 88.5% of the grape tonnage 
crushed in 1989 voted to keep the commission. But a majority vote was needed in 
both ballots to keep the commission going. 
</P>
<P>
Bill MacIver of Matanzas Creek Winery, who helped spearhead a massive mail 
campaign against the commission, said commissioners previously were elected by 
a formula that allowed the state's largest wineries to dominate the 
commission." He said that, under his plan, "half of the commissioners would be 
elected on the basis of one winery, one vote." 
</P>
<P>
One of the small wineries' major complaints was that $7 million of the 
commission budget last year went to the Wine Institute, a private trade 
organization. "And the small wineries didn't have a voice in how the money was 
being spent or in Wine Institute," said one vintner.

IN FALL READY-TO-WEAR L. A. DESIGNERS OFFER THE SMOOTH, THE SOFT THE SLEEK AND 
THE SIMPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA FOLEY, Foley, a free-lance writer, often contributes to The Times 
fashion pages. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Los Angeles, there are always a few fashion designers who go about their 
business quietly. They seldom stage fashion shows, they sell to a small 
selection of stores, and their strong independent spirit is always apparent. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their unorthodox approach to business, their names are among the best 
known of Southern California ready-to-wear designers. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, the names include several long-time Los Angeles talents -- Harriet 
Selwyn, Rick Beach and Patti Cappalli, Holly Harp and Nancy Heller -- along 
with some newer names -- James Tarantino, Peter Cohen, Bryan Emerson and Tere 
Tereba, Richard Tyler and Jennifer Joanou. For all the diversity in their 
styles, they all draw from the basic building blocks: stretch fabrics, sleek, 
soft shapes and interchangeable pieces that make even a small wardrobe 
versatile. 
</P>
<P>
Since she began designing her "Fragments" collection of modular components in 
the early '70s, Selwyn's design concept hasn't changed. Most of her designs are 
still one size and all of the pieces work interchangeably. 
</P>
<P>
Her evening wear best shows off her unique way of blending beauty and comfort. 
For fall she is styling wrap tops of Chantilly lace, and matching full skirts, 
in earth tones mixed with gold. Her outer wear includes a silk velvet jacket 
with a cascade of jet fringe beading, to wear with Fortuny pleated satin and 
iridescent chiffon fabric evening outfits. Her collection is sold locally at 
Raffles. 
</P>
<P>
The design team of Rick Beach and Patti Cappalli gives jackets center stage for 
fall. "I think it's great to have basic pants, skirts and dresses to wear with 
all kinds of different jackets that can take you anywhere you need to go," 
Cappalli says of the collection, which will be at Modasport and Bullock's. 
Matte jersey or lace T-shirts in solid and glittery colors are shown under the 
jackets in mohair tweeds with gold buttons or gray flannel with jet-beaded 
fringe. Blanket pattern coats are Beach-Cappalli's show-stopping finish. 
</P>
<P>
James Tarantino works his signature wool crepe fabric into sheathes with 
necklines made of gold chain jewelry by Deanna Hamro. In black, charcoal gray 
or bright shades of red and chrome yellow, Tarantino's silhouettes are the 
modern update of dresses that Audrey Hepburn wore as Holly Golightly in 
"Breakfast at Tiffany's" in 1961. The clothes are carried at Ron Ross in 
Tarzana and at Nordstrom. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Cohen takes a Zen-like approach to fashion, starting with the small, gold 
star he puts in his clothes instead of a label. His designs are pared to gently 
tailored silhouettes. Luxury fabric T-shirts with necklines that graze the 
collarbone, blouses with collars and single buttons, slim pants and short 
skirts are the foundation of his simple statement. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen's novelty shapes and details are clever: a vest creates a V-neck by 
looping the fabric, a charmeuse skirt takes on texture and body with crushed 
pleating, and layers of Indian-inspired silk and chiffon combine East and West. 
His collections are carried at Ecru. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Heller's philosophy has been based on ease. Some of her best work this 
season is in cashmere, suede and knit, and oversize, buffalo plaids. A group of 
crisp white shirts are her alternative to basic T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Joanou's name first attracted attention when she opened her nouvelle 
couture shop on La Brea Avenue about a year ago. Now, she also wholesales her 
clean-lined styles nationwide. Her wool knit separates range from long-sleeved 
tops to long and short skirts and narrow pants. Other narrow silhouettes 
include vests, jackets and chiffon blouses creating layers of texture. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Tyler also began his L.A. career with the opening of his retail store 
for men's and women's wear, Tyler-Trafficante, on Beverly Boulevard. He is 
known for strong shapes, unexpected choice of colors and custom-quality 
workmanship. For fall, he is adding his first, limited collection of women's 
evening wear. A quilted satin suit with motorcycle-style jacket is one example 
of his blend of British tailoring with cutting-edge style. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Emerson and Tere Tereba are partners, and each is a designer in her own 
right. Their collections are sold at Shauna Stein in Los Angeles. Emerson 
describes her collection as modern and romantic. For fall, she shows fluid 
velvets that loosely glide over the body. But there's always a twist. Emerson's 
signature is loops and buttons that bring hemlines up to hip-line with 
asymmetrical draping. Her velvets can be dressy or casual. 
</P>
<P>
Tere Tereba has a more tailored style. She uses antique trims and closings on 
silhouettes that are classically oriented. A linen suit with crewel embroidery 
is one of her first fall '90 offerings. Other styles are trimmed with 
tobacco-colored Battenberg lace.

ANIMATION: THE RECENT BOX-OFFICE SUCCESS OF FULL-LENGTH FEATURES IS CREATING A 
NEW BOOM IN THE INDUSTRY THAT MAY RIVAL THE 'GOLDEN AGE' OF THE '30S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Buoyed by the success of "Who Framed Roger Rabbit," "Oliver and Company," "The 
Land Before Time" and "The Little Mermaid," animation is enjoying a banner 
year: 
</P>
<P>
* "The Little Mermaid," which earned a record-breaking $82 million, won two 
Academy Awards -- the first animated feature to receive an Oscar since "Dumbo" 
in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
* At least five new animated features are scheduled to be released this year. 
</P>
<P>
* The madcap Roger Rabbit returns to theaters next month in a new short that 
will screen with Disney's "Dick Tracy." 
</P>
<P>
* The other Oscar-winning rabbit, Bugs Bunny, will appear in his first 
theatrical short in 26 years when "Box Office Bunny" debuts this fall. 
</P>
<P>
* Starting today, the AMC Theatre chain will show a classic Warner Bros. short 
before the feature in 1,700 theaters across the country. 
</P>
<P>
The new AMC policy is the latest development in the current animation boom that 
threatens to rival the "golden age" of the 1930s. Since 1986, animated films 
have grossed more than $400 million domestically, and Fox's "The Simpsons" is 
one of the biggest hits of the 1989-90 TV season. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty years ago, when Elmer Fudd first admonished audiences, "Be ve-wy, ve-wy 
quiet: I'm hunting wabbits," cartoons were an essential part of a trip to the 
movies. AMC is bringing them to the big screen after a long hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1989, we conducted an extensive research study to see what people felt 
would enhance the movie-going experience," said AMC president Ed Durwood at a 
press conference in Century City Monday morning. "Of the 70,000 people we 
polled, 42% wanted to see a cartoon before the feature -- a higher figure than 
for any other possible improvement. We felt this response revealed an on-going 
interest in animation and indicated that the success of 'Roger Rabbit' and 
other recent animated films do not represent a passing fad." 
</P>
<P>
Patrons at most AMC theaters will see one of 130 shorts chosen from a list the 
surviving Warners directors and animators compiled of their best work. The bulk 
of the films were made during the late '40s and '50s, when the Warners artists 
made some of the fastest, funniest cartoons in the history of the medium. Bugs, 
Elmer, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Tweety, Sylvester, Wile E. Coyote and the Road 
Runner formed a versatile repertory company of comedians that rivaled even 
Disney's creations. 
</P>
<P>
For the AMC release, Warner Bros. has struck new 35-millimeter prints, 
adjusting the nearly square image so that none of the visuals will be lost in 
the contemporary wide-screen format. These cartoons have been popular on 
television for decades, but in recent years the networks have excised the 
pratfalls and explosions because of their allegedly violent content. The films 
will be shown in the theaters "in their classic form, with no editing 
whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
Most film industry observers credit the seven-minute "Tummy Trouble" -- the 
first Roger Rabbit short -- with the quick start last summer for Disney's 
"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids," a movie that went on to gross $130 million. On June 
15, Disney will roll Roger out again in "Roller Coaster Rabbit" to see if he 
can give "Dick Tracy" a hand. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Honey' was a very strong, successful movie in its own right, but its 
entertainment value was enhanced by the cartoon," said Peter Schneider, senior 
vice president of feature animation for Walt Disney Pictures. "I don't think 
Disney has created a character of the magnitude of Roger in the last 30 years 
-- a character who's real in the way Mickey Mouse is real, who jumps off the 
screen into people's laps. We're moving ahead with the sequel to 'Roger 
Rabbit,' but we've also done the two short cartoons. What better way to keep 
the character alive than using him correctly?" 
</P>
<P>
Animation historian John Canemaker, who previewed "Roller Coaster Rabbit" at 
Disney's Florida studio, recalled a renowned MGM animator when he described it 
as "very funny and very Tex Avery in tone. The pandemonium builds much more 
skillfully than it did in 'Tummy Trouble.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Box Office Bunny," the new Bugs Bunny cartoon, is slated to debut this fall. 
Directed by former Disney animator Darrell Van Citters, the film is being 
animated at Warners' Burbank animation facility. Dan Fellman, senior vice 
president/general sales manager at Warner Bros., said the studio has yet to 
decide which feature to release with "Box Office Bunny." Fellman also expressed 
the hope that the success of the distribution arrangement with AMC will enable 
Warners to produce additional new cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
This renewed interest in animated shorts comes 18 years after the last 
Hollywood cartoon studio closed. Cartoons had been a feature of motion picture 
shows since the days of silent film; from the '30s through the '50s, every 
Hollywood studio had either an in-house animation unit or a distribution deal 
with an independent cartoon producer. 
</P>
<P>
The 1949 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that forced the studios to discontinue block 
booking killed cartoons. Under block booking, a theater owner who wanted a 
studio's hit feature also had to take a second feature, a cartoon and -- often 
-- a newsreel and live action short. A percentage of the rental fee for the 
entire package financed the animation production. 
</P>
<P>
Theater owners refused to pay more than nominal fees for cartoons, and an 
animated short couldn't earn back its production costs on its initial release. 
As a result, the Hollywood cartoon studios closed their doors during the late 
'50s and early '60s. Walter Lantz, who finally stopped production in 1972, 
said, "We didn't stop producing cartoons because their popularity died out, it 
was because we couldn't afford to make them." 
</P>
<P>
But a good cartoon could be re-released over a period of years and earn a 
substantial profit. At the AMC press conference Monday, an audience of adults 
and children whooped with laughter at Friz Freleng's 1954 Bugs Bunny-Yosemite 
Sam short "Captain Hareblower." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a wonderful feeling to come back into a theater and see one of these 
films on a big screen," said Freleng, a five-time Oscar winner who directed 266 
Warners cartoons. "Since I left the studio, I've usually seen them by myself on 
a little tube; it's nice to know the laughs still come in the places I 
intended, 26 years later. I think when theaters stopped showing cartoons, it 
left a big hole in the entertainment."

'BACK TO THE FUTURE': GENIAL, TIDY FINALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Time-travel scenarios almost always work in the movies, no matter how clumsily 
executed. In the case of the 1985 "Back to the Future," no excuses were in 
order. The film was a highly inventive nonstop dither of time-warp confusion 
and, in Marty McFly's rush to unite his parents-to-be, it even had a mite of 
"heart." 
</P>
<P>
"Back to the Future Part II" extended the storyline of its predecessor without 
adding much to its inventiveness. It wasn't as bad as most people said it was 
at the time -- it had pace and wit -- but it didn't really need to be made, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
The third installment, "Back to the Future Part III" (citywide), was filmed on 
the heels of "Part II," and it too has no particular reason for being (except, 
of course, to complete the series and cash in). It's sprightly and inoffensive, 
though. And, for those who care, it satisfyingly ties up the various plot 
strands that were flapping in the breeze from the last installment. "Back to 
the Future" futurists will feel complete. 
</P>
<P>
This time around, director Robert Zemeckis and screenwriter Robert Gale indulge 
their love of Westerns. (It's that love that must have kept them interested in 
the project.) Through a series of blissfully nutty schemes, Marty McFly 
(Michael J. Fox) travels back to the Old West, circa 1885, to try and rescue 
Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) before he is shot in the back by Hill Valley's 
chief lout, Buford (Mad Dog) Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), an ancestor of Marty's 
20th-Century rival Biff Tannen. 
</P>
<P>
Duded up in bargain-bin cowboy attire, calling himself "Clint Eastwood," Marty 
reunites with Doc, who is posing as a blacksmith. (Doc said in Part II that he 
always wanted to live in the Old West.) Unlike the first two films, this new 
one, once it settles into the past, is essentially devoted to Doc. He's smitten 
by an equally smitten schoolmarm (Mary Steenburgen) and the question arises: 
Will he be able to leave her and zip back to the future? 
</P>
<P>
In its emphasis on Doc, "Part III" (rated PG) is a bit like an episode of some 
long-running TV show that gives over an entire segment to one of its character 
actors. There's a pleasing humility in the way Fox hands the movie over to 
Lloyd. Or is it just that Fox has become tired of scampering around like some 
overage-underage hellion? Marty's wind-up-toy athleticism has wound down, and 
that's something of a relief. Fox has grown as an actor since he started this 
series, and it may be that, particularly after "Casualties of War," he can't 
quite find it in himself to careen about with the same cartoonish abandon. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Lloyd, on the other hand, appears to regard his role as a kind of 
actor's redemption. With his great shock of white hair and his rubbery, 
permanently agape features, Doc still looks like a Kabuki mad scientist. But 
his love for Steenburgen's Clara humanizes him; when he's alone with her, or 
dancing with her, Doc is happily flummoxed by his own capacity for tenderness. 
He can't quite get a fix on his romantic delirium, and he kind of likes the 
idea that he can't explain his bliss. It's a good joke: The mad scientist 
seeking to explain the unknowable comes face to face with the universe's 
ultimate mystery: women. 
</P>
<P>
Steenburgen is such an entrancing presence, with her own slightly out-of-time 
spaciness, that she keeps Clara's scenes with Doc from becoming blubbery. She 
really is Doc's soulmate; their mutual love of Jules Verne is their touchstone. 
It's regrettable that Zemeckis doesn't give over more of his movie to this 
couple's lyrical clownishness. Marty may have cooled off but Zemeckis is still 
hot-footed; even though Part III is a more spacious and gentle entertainment 
than its predecessor, it doesn't slow down for the emotional moments. It 
doesn't quite give these balmy lovers their due. 
</P>
<P>
Zemeckis may think he's still working with the cartoon characters from "Roger 
Rabbit" and, in a sense, he is. But the cartoon inventiveness of his best work 
doesn't have a chance to function in this Western setting. The filmmakers may 
love the idea of making a Western -- even a mock-satirical one -- but they 
don't provide enough gags at the genre's expense. They may be too awed by the 
form to make a satisfying joke out of it. (Parts of the film were shot in 
Monument Valley: John Ford country.) 
</P>
<P>
Fox's pint-size feistiness is used to comic advantage in a barroom brawl scene, 
and he gets to do a funny moon dance when Mad Dog shoots at his feet, but too 
much is made of the Clint Eastwood connection, and the overweening chumminess 
of it is a bit obnoxious. (Eastwood is given a "thank you" in the end credits.) 
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Western is a dead genre for the mostly young audience that will 
see this film, so most of the in-jokes will be exclusionary -- private jokes. 
(Kids who see the film aren't likely to clamor for more Westerns.) Then again, 
the entire film (rated PG) is inlaid with in-jokes to the two previous films in 
the series. Is all this self-congratulation a matter of pride or a sign of 
creative exhaustion? A little of both, I think.

CONCERT: DAVID BOWIE'S IMMINENT RETIREMENT OF HIS CLASSICS ON HIS 'SOUND + 
VISION' TOUR HAS ALREADY LEFT THEM LIFELESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's hard to see where you're going when you're looking back. 
</P>
<P>
David Bowie's "Sound + Vision" tour offers a peculiar premise for a show by a 
big rock star: Nothing but old songs, and on top of that it's their final spin. 
After the tour, Bowie will no longer get lost in space as Major Tom, nor 
celebrate the sci-fi rock star Ziggy Stardust, nor encourage his fans to face 
their ch-ch-ch-changes. 
</P>
<P>
Is this a gimmick to drum up interest in the tour? A daring gesture to put his 
future artistry on the line (the idea is that shelving his old favorites will 
force Bowie to rely on his new work)? Or is it a lazy way to stage an 
undemanding concert, avoiding the challenge of combining his past with his 
present? 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the slippery star's true motivation, the result on stage at the Los 
Angeles Sports Arena on Wednesday night was erratic at best: occasionally 
inspired, mostly flat. 
</P>
<P>
What could be wrong with a good, uncomplicated wallow in the canon of this rock 
titan? 
</P>
<P>
Well, the lesson is that a totally retrospective show, even one loaded with 
major material and built-in drama, needs the balance and forward movement that 
even some token new material would provide. Nobody went to the Stones shows to 
hear stuff from "Steel Wheels," but scattered in the nostalgia, those songs at 
least offered a convincing illusion of vitality. 
</P>
<P>
Bowie's performance suggested that rather than bringing a special poignancy and 
edge to his classics, their imminent retirement has already left them lifeless. 
The knowledge that they're on their last legs deflates them instead of 
enhancing them, and they didn't even generate much of the valedictory 
sentimentality that should have been the cheapest emotion at their command. 
</P>
<P>
Definitive, committed execution would have helped, but Bowie's band -- 
especially the overactive guitarist Adrian Belew -- specializes in mowing down 
nuance, and the singer's interest level seemed to fluctuate radically. 
</P>
<P>
He put the most into two of his landmarks, "Life on Mars?" and "Ziggy 
Stardust," but he looked as ridiculous as he's said he feels in the Stonesy 
glitter-rock of "Rebel, Rebel." He offered selections for fans of most of his 
incarnations, with the emphasis on the post-"Ziggy" years. 
</P>
<P>
On a stage flanked by carved columns and decorated with medieval-looking 
statuary of beasts and angels, Bowie slipped in and out of a theatrical mode. 
Most of the songs were enhanced by gigantic, ghostlike images projected on a 
transparent screen: an effective integration of the star in the flesh with the 
star's assorted public images and private emanations. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Bowie's casual manner was doubly refreshing after his last 
tour's distancing stagecraft. He seemed even looser than he did at last year's 
surprise Roxy show with his stripped-down group Tin Machine. 
</P>
<P>
Often stationed on a stage extension that jutted into the audience, he smiled 
and joked, sometimes almost nervously. He opened the post-intermission segment 
by strolling out strumming with Belew while the house lights were still on, and 
at the encore he even teased the crowd by saying: "I know who killed Laura 
Palmer." 
</P>
<P>
If he can create the same kind of intimacy when he plays Dodger Stadium on 
Saturday, Bowie will be a real magician. But with this show, there's still no 
way he can avoid being a lame duck.

WRONG NUMBER: It happens in nearly every political campaign -- a mass mailing 
seeking support lands on the most inopportune doorstep. . . . This time, a 
strongly worded pitch for Assessor Bradley L. Jacobs, focusing on his battle 
with local cable television operators over increased taxes, went to two 
executives of companies which have filed suit against Jacobs. . . . His 
consultant, who said the volunteer envelope stuffers "don't read the paper," 
suggested the executives "can simply toss it." Mark I. Pinsky and Steve Emmons

SCHOOL'S OUT: The proposal that three elementary schools be closed in 
Huntington Beach (B4) is nothing new for Orange County but may be the end of a 
trend. . . . Countywide figures are tough to come by, but nearly 40 schools 
have been closed in six of the county's 28 districts alone. The Westminster, 
Orange and Newport-Mesa districts have reopened or built new elementary schools 
and are contemplating more in the next two years. . . . Says Westminster

AGRAN, SHERIDAN SLUG IT OUT IN DEBATE

<P>
Above the jeers and cheers of about 100 people, incumbent Mayor Larry Agran and 
his political nemesis, Councilwoman Sally Anne Sheridan, traded insults and 
highlighted their differing positions during a contentious debate Thursday at 
UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
In their first face-to-face confrontation, Agran and Sheridan berated each 
other's previous City Council votes and questioned the motives on a host of 
issues ranging from open-space preservation to a ban on chemicals blamed for 
the slow destruction of the Earth's ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
On the quad of the UCI student center, Agran criticized Sheridan's vote to 
oppose Irvine's ban on ozone-depleting chemicals, known as chlorofluorocarbons, 
or CFCs, which gave the city national recognition and prompted similar measures 
in other municipalities. 
</P>
<P>
"Council Member Sheridan voted against our ordinance," Agran said. "She has 
tried to thwart our open-space preservation policies from the beginning. She 
was lackluster with respect to CFCs and recycling and every other environmental 
initiative. Now, she has to be accountable for the record." 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan retorted by lambasting Agran's desire to expand Irvine's role in 
foreign relations, especially his vote to spend $90,000 for an international 
affairs department and a sister-cities program. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor makes headlines and I make progress," Sheridan said. "We're doing 
better at international relations than we are at local relations. We don't get 
along with Costa Mesa, Newport Beach, Santa Ana, Tustin, the Board of 
Supervisors, the Orange County Transit District or the Orange County 
Transportation Commission, and, therefore, we have to go to Tsukuba, Japan." 
Tsukuba is one of Irvine's new sister cities. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, Sheridan is endorsed by all five county supervisors and 50 council 
members from almost all of Orange County's cities. 
</P>
<P>
The two-hour showdown became even more heated when Agran resurrected Sheridan's 
1984 City Council proposal to build a City Hall on landmark Quail Hill, now a 
nature preserve. The Quail Hill development was supported by the Irvine Co., 
the giant construction firm which owns about a third of the city's land. 
</P>
<P>
In her defense, Sheridan said that she was on a committee to find a civic 
center site and that a lot of people were involved in the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll say there was a large number of people," Agran responded, "virtually all 
of them employed by the Irvine Co., that prevailed upon you, as their best 
friend on the City Council, to propose the early and immediate development of 
Quail Hill." 
</P>
<P>
"That's not true," Sheridan interjected, her voice drowned out by boos and 
cheers from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Agran tried to distance himself from developers by making 
available to the news media the names of 1,646 people who have contributed a 
record $85,139 in loans, money and non-monetary donations to his reelection 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
Although state campaign disclosure laws do not require candidates to release 
the identities of people who contribute less than $100, Agran did so through 
his campaign manager, Angelo Vassos. 
</P>
<P>
A review of the donations indicates that the occupations of the vast majority 
of Agran contributors appear to be unrelated to the construction industry. Of 
those who gave more than $100, roughly 5 to 10% work in construction-related 
trades. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite my opponent's cynical attempts to portray our effort as elitist," 
Agran said, "the facts clearly demonstrate that my support comes from the 
people of Irvine, who have donated, on average, $40.68. These are not fat cats 
or high rollers." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the campaign, Agran has described himself as an independent 
policy-maker who strives to keep developers at bay with an agenda of innovative 
planning ideas and slow-growth measures. 
</P>
<P>
To differentiate himself from Sheridan, he has repeatedly labeled her a 
"puppet" of the Irvine Co. Agran claims that Sheridan hides her contributions 
from the company and other builders behind state laws that do not require her 
to publicly name those who donate less than $100. 
</P>
<P>
Calling Agran's disclosure of contributors a "ruse," Sheridan said she was not 
the darling of developers but declined to make public donors giving her less 
than $100. She said that the law does not require it and that she wants to 
honor her supporters' desire for privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the race, Sheridan made public her income tax returns and records of 
her and her husband's property sales as real estate agents to head off 
criticism that she was exploiting her council position by handling home sales 
for more than a dozen city employees and Irvine Co. executives. 
</P>
<P>
"I have provided the substance of disclosure in this campaign," Sheridan said. 
"Mr. Agran has not even provided a very good appearance." 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan has raised $55,501 in campaign donations, of which an estimated 10% 
came from people who work in construction-related occupations, according to 
campaign disclosure statements filed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Agran's repeated attacks on developers during the race have angered not only 
Sheridan but some of the city's builders, who consider him a hypocrite. They 
say they are tired of being browbeaten every election despite their support for 
some of Agran's projects, including open-space measures and a proposed 
monorail. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, campaign disclosure statements show that some developers have 
contributed heavily to the Conservancy, an Agran-backed group that sought open 
space in the city, and to Proposition 116, a statewide initiative that could 
provide $125 million for a monorail in Irvine. The mayor, who spearheaded local 
fund-raising efforts for the ballot measure, raised $250,000 to $300,000, 
virtually all of it from the construction industry.

ROUTES TO FORGET ON MEMORIAL WEEKEND

What does the California Highway Patrol advise to ease the headache of the 
hectic Memorial Day holiday weekend, when it seems everyone has places to go, 
people to see and things to do? 
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone should stay home, put their feet up and relax," said Linda 
Burrus, spokeswoman for the CHP in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
But of course, she acknowledges there is scant chance this will happen. 
</P>
<P>
So for those folks who insist on hitting the streets, Burrus has a few 
suggestions on how to avoid the worst traffic congestion during the long 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be heavy Thursday and worse on Friday," she said. "Probably east 
on 91 (Riverside Freeway) is going to be real hectic. And south to San Diego, 
so 405 will be bad. Sunday and Monday night will be real heavy heading back 
from the border and toward the coastal areas from the desert." 
</P>
<P>
Get the picture? 
</P>
<P>
"This is, of course, the beginning of the summer holidays, and if the weather 
is nice, then everyone sets out to do sports kinds of things, like dirt-biking, 
like heading for the desert or the mountains, like fishing, or going to the 
river," she said. 
</P>
<P>
And yes, the weather will be nice. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Burback, a meteorologist for WeatherData Inc., of Wichita, Kan., which 
provides weather forecasts for The Times, said the weekend will be "really 
pleasant." 
</P>
<P>
Along the coast, high temperatures will reach the upper 60s, with some late 
night and morning clouds. Inland, the mercury will reach the 70s to the 
mid-80s. 
</P>
<P>
"But it'll be dry and there will be some sea breezes," he said. "Yes, it sounds 
like a perfect weekend." MARIA NEWMAN

SLATES REPRIMANDED FOR FUND-RAISER ROLE

In a terse and scolding letter to Planning Commissioner Roger Slates, Orange 
County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder has requested that he submit a written 
statement detailing his involvement in reportedly soliciting funds for an 
Assembly candidate from developers who have projects pending before him. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, released Thursday, recounts a telephone conversation that Wieder 
had Sunday with Slates, whom she appointed to the Planning Commission last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"I really gave him a tongue-lashing. The whole thing was stupid. . . ." Wieder 
said in an interview. "I told him I wanted him to put everything he told me in 
writing." 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported last week that Slates helped host a dinner on behalf of 58th 
Assembly District candidate Peter von Elten. The affair was held in a private 
dining room at a Trabuco Canyon restaurant owned by Planning Commission 
Chairman Stephen A. Nordeck. The article quoted several of those who attended 
as saying that both commissioners urged guests -- including representatives of 
some South County developers -- to contribute to von Elten's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
State law prohibits members of appointed boards or commissions from soliciting 
campaign contributions of $250 or more from individuals who have matters 
pending before them. 
</P>
<P>
Nordeck has strongly denied soliciting any funds or taking part in the dinner; 
Slates has repeatedly declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder said she would not disclose what Slates told her about the evening until 
he submits his written explanation. She said that in her 12 years as a 
supervisor, however, this is the first time she has made such a request. 
</P>
<P>
In her letter to Slates dated May 21, Wieder wrote: "Our discussion relative to 
the evening at the Trabuco Oaks Restaurant held last Tuesday and your related 
involvement was explained by you to me in detail. 
</P>
<P>
"As I told you, it was totally inappropriate and poor judgment for you to have 
been involved in such a political activity. As a county planning commissioner, 
you hold a very sensitive and responsible public role that cannot be tarnished 
in any way." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said Thursday that he also has talked to Nordeck, 
whom he appointed to the commission last year. He said that Nordeck's behavior 
demonstrated a "lapse of judgment" that "should not have been allowed to 
occur." Vasquez said he questioned Nordeck earlier this week about the dinner 
and that Nordeck continued to deny involvement beyond being present on and off 
throughout the evening in his capacity as owner of the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez said, however, that since that conversation, additional questions about 
Nordeck's involvement have been raised and that he plans to interview the 
commissioner again. Vasquez declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say in my opinion there was a lapse of judgment," Vasquez said, 
"because I feel it is very important to strive to preserve a level confidence 
that is essential in public office." 
</P>
<P>
Both commissioners are reportedly on vacation this week and could not be 
reached for comment Thursday. ROSE ELLEN O'CONNOR and GEORGE FRANK

2 ACCUSED IN SCAM AS CREDIT CARD CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Following a monthlong investigation, police have arrested two men suspected of 
operating an Orange County credit card pyramid scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Joseph Shea, 40, of Garden Grove and Michael William Berger, 37, of 
Placentia were arrested by detectives on Tuesday following a meeting with 
prospective customers at a meeting hall of the Westminster Manor, said 
Westminster Police Detective Robert Gill. 
</P>
<P>
The two men, connected to Inglewood-based Credit Card Bank Club Inc., were 
charged on Thursday, with bail set at $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Gill said investigators suspect that similar scams all over Southern California 
may be linked to the Inglewood operation. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Harold Moret, spokesman for the Inglewood Police Department, would not 
comment on the credit card club, only saying that Inglewood is conducting its 
own investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Gill said it was still too early to determine how much money was exchanged, but 
according to the arrested men's records, 300 people had been involved with the 
scheme. 
</P>
<P>
During his investigation, Gill attended two of the credit card seminars. Those 
who attended the meetings were asked to pay $88 to join the club. They were 
promised MasterCards, regardless of their credit histories, but the cards were 
never produced, Gill said. 
</P>
<P>
Members also were told to bring in more people, which would increase their 
credit limit. This way, Gill said, members could start out with a $500 limit 
and increase the credit limit every time they got someone else to join. 
</P>
<P>
"In the end, the only people who were making money were the owners of the 
credit card club," said Gill. 
</P>
<P>
Gill said potential customers were notified of meetings by phone numbers given 
in advertisements that ran in the Los Angeles Times, the Orange County 
Register, USA Today and Penny Saver. 
</P>
<P>
When Gill arrested Shea and Berger, 38 people were attending the meeting. Many 
said they didn't know the practice was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really strange," Gill said. "The people who were attending these 
meetings came by Cadillac and bus. But they all had the idea they would be 
making fast and easy money." 
</P>
<P>
Gill said the investigation is continuing and urged anyone who thinks that he 
or she may have been the victim of this operation to call the Westminster 
Police Department at (714) 893-3315. Erik Hamilton

2 ARRESTED AFTER 911 CALL DURING ROBBERY 
</P>

<P>
Two men who held a husband and wife at gunpoint Thursday were captured by 
police after the wife called 911 while the suspects were in another room 
looting the apartment, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began about 1 p.m. at an apartment complex on 1555 Mesa Verde East 
when the two men entered the home of Ernesto Ramos, 26, and his wife, Irma 
Abalos, 23, Police Lt. Tom Warnack said. 
</P>
<P>
The men, armed with handguns, left Abalos unattended as they looked for 
valuables, Warnack said. 
</P>
<P>
"The wife was able to call 911 when the suspects were looking around the 
place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police surrounded the complex and apprehended one of the suspects as the pair 
left the building. The other suspect was captured about 45 minutes later hiding 
in a bush. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects, identified as Peter Immanual Hernandez, 20, of Fullerton and 
Frank Garcia, 34, address unknown, were arrested on suspicion of armed robbery, 
Warnack said. They were taken to Costa Mesa Jail and held in lieu of $25,000 
bail each, he said. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the incident, and no property was lost, police said. MATT

MUSEUM STUDYING 2ND DESIGN PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The board of the Newport Harbor Art Museum on Thursday night revealed that it 
is looking at a second design plan by an architect other than Renzo Piano, who 
drew the initial plan. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees would not disclose the identity of the second architect, who was 
called into the project three months ago. The board also said that other 
designs may be considered. 
</P>
<P>
The board designated Trustee James V. Selna to spearhead efforts to select a 
final design for the museum's new building. Selna will consolidate trustees' 
opinions on various alternatives for a full board vote on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Selna said the board hopes to make a choice by early July. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to be sure there is enthusiasm for the design we choose -- from 
trustees, from the museum community as a whole and particularly from major 
contributors," Selna said. "We need a design that works programmatically and a 
design we can pay for." 
</P>
<P>
Trustees have been modifying the original plan by the renowned Piano since it 
was unveiled last summer. They said earlier this week that Piano's plan could 
be completely redrawn, either by Piano or by other architects, though no final 
decisions have been made. 
</P>
<P>
Piano, based in Italy, has been unavailable for comment on the matter. But he 
and his local design team, Blurock Partnership in Newport Beach, have been 
working with trustees on the modifications, museum officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Piano is aware that a second architect's plan is under consideration, Selna 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Alterations to Piano's original plan, which calls for a low-lying, 
87,000-square-foot building, have centered on substantial expansion of gallery 
space and reduction of the project's cost. 
</P>
<P>
The new museum, scheduled to open in 1993, is to be built on 10 acres promised 
by the Irvine Co. at the corner of East Coast Highway and MacArthur Boulevard.

LOCAL ELECTIONS: DISTRICT ATTORNEY; 
</P>
<P>
BAR ASSN. RATES CAPIZZI HIGHEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Members of the Orange County Bar Assn. have rated Dist. Atty. Michael R. 
Capizzi the most qualified of four candidates running for district attorney in 
the June 5 election. Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. James G. Enright ranked second. 
</P>
<P>
The Bar Assn. poll results, released Thursday, show Capizzi with much greater 
marks than his opponents in the "highly qualified" category. 
</P>
<P>
But if the "highly qualified" and "qualified" categories are combined, Enright 
closes the gap considerably. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi received 209 "highly qualified" votes and 76 "qualified." Enright 
received 117 in the first category and 108 in the latter. That put the totals 
at 285 for Capizzi and 225 for Enright. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Dist. Atty. Edgar A. Freeman ranked a distant third, with a total of 
168 points for the two categories. 
</P>
<P>
The only candidate who actually made a poor showing was Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Thomas Avdeef, who has been Capizzi's strongest critic during the campaign. 
Avdeef's "not qualified" votes outnumbered his combined "highly qualified" and 
"qualified" votes 84 to 71. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi is hoping to win enough votes next month so that he won't have to run 
against any other opponent in a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
He would need one vote more than 50% of the total to win the election outright 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
Enright's supporters, however, said Thursday night that the bar association 
ratings may be an indication that Enright has enough support to force a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate section, the poll asked the lawyers to break down their rankings 
into five categories: experience and judgment, knowledge of the law, integrity 
and character, objectivity and fairness, and administrative abilities. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi consistently outranked the others in all those categories. Enright was 
second in all of them. 
</P>
<P>
But Enright's votes fell off in the last category, administrative abilities. 
</P>
<P>
He got 61 votes to Capizzi's 181. Enright was consistently in the low 100s in 
the other categories with Capizzi in the high 100s. 
</P>
<P>
Bar Assn. President Jennifer J. King said Thursday that the local bar conducted 
the poll because "it's very important that the bar respond to the public's 
request for information." 
</P>
<P>
"Attorneys have more contact with the candidates and probably know more about 
them than the average citizen," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Only about 10% of those contacted, or 433 lawyers, returned an evaluation. But 
the Bar Assn. was satisfied enough with the results that it is paying to 
advertise them in newspapers.

PARENTS PROTEST SCHOOL CLOSURE PLAN 
</P>

<P>
About 500 angry parents packed a high school gymnasium Thursday night to 
challenge an Ocean View School District proposal to close three elementary 
schools as a cost-cutting measure. 
</P>
<P>
The district's Master Planning Committee of Eleven, which has recommended 
closing Golden View, Haven View and Lake View schools, listened as parents gave 
impassioned speeches pleading for their children's schools to remain open. 
</P>
<P>
Parents argued that the committee should consider what programs are available 
at the schools and other factors, rather than focusing on low enrollment -- the 
chief reason the committee has cited in recommending the closures. 
</P>
<P>
"This looks to me to be a Band-Aid solution to a problem that probably requires 
surgery," said Debbi Wise, mother of a Golden View first-grader. 
</P>
<P>
The Committee of Eleven, elected from among a 40-member group of parents, 
administration officials, teachers and other district employees, recommended 
this week that the district close the schools to slice $750,000 from its budget 
deficit. The district, whose student enrollment stabilized this year after 
steadily dropping the previous 14 years, faces a shortfall of $1.3 million to 
$1.8 million, Supt. Monte McMurray said. 
</P>
<P>
Golden View parents, wearing red armbands -- the school's colors are red and 
gold -- appeared to make up the largest group of parents in attendance Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Eileen Mori, a Golden View parent and committee member opposed to the plan, 
unveiled an alternative proposal to close only Haven View and Lake View and 
make budget cuts elsewhere in the district. 
</P>
<P>
Other parents opposed the closure plan because it would change boundaries and 
force their children to switch schools next year. 
</P>
<P>
The advisory committee targeted the three schools for closure because 
attendance is well below the average for Orange County K-6 schools. According 
to a March enrollment report, 340 students attend Haven View, Golden View has 
350 students and Lake View has 395. The county average is 420, McMurray said. 
</P>
<P>
The plan would also change Crest View, now a K-8 school, to a K-6 school to 
help accommodate students from the closed schools. It would also expand busing 
and alter the boundaries at Crest View, Mesa View, Spring View, Village View 
and Westmont schools. 
</P>
<P>
The school board is scheduled to hold public hearings on June 4 and 6, 
tentatively planned to take place in the Ocean View High School gymnasium, and 
a study session on June 5 before deciding on the committee's recommendation. 
Trustees plan to make their decision following the June 6 hearing.

FAST-STARTING BICHETTE RUNNING INTO SUMMER DOLDRUMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dante Bichette has spent the early part of this season looking for a piece of 
outfield grass to call his own. 
</P>
<P>
For awhile, he seemed to be staking a claim to most of it, leaving a little in 
center for Devon White. 
</P>
<P>
Bichette hit three home runs in the first eight games of the season. He was 
throwing out runners from the outfield on a pace to set a major-league record. 
He was playing in left, in right, and even made appearances in center. 
</P>
<P>
By May 11, he was hitting .302 and had driven in 17 runs. 
</P>
<P>
That, coincidence of coincidences, was the day the Angels traded Mike Witt for 
Dave Winfield -- or, rather, the day the trade was announced -- preceding the 
suspense of precisely when or if Winfield would arrive. 
</P>
<P>
Since that day, Bichette had gone 5 for 31 before the Angels' extra-inning game 
against the Toronto Blue Jays Thursday, his average falling to .272. 
</P>
<P>
With the acquisition of Winfield and the earlier trade that brought outfielder 
Luis Polonia to the team, the Angels had six outfielders, and Bichette no 
longer had a clear role. 
</P>
<P>
By all rights, right was Winfield's. 
</P>
<P>
"Right field, that's my terrain," Winfield said as he sat in the dugout at 
Anaheim Stadium on Wednesday. It was no jealous claim, simply an assessment. 
The Angels traded for him with the intention of playing him. 
</P>
<P>
And Bichette was left with Polonia to contend with in left. 
</P>
<P>
Bichette had been rested for two of the past three games before getting the 
start in left Thursday. He flied out in his first at-bat, but in his second, 
his fielder's choice grounder drove in the run that gave the Angels their first 
lead, 2-1, in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
In the 10th inning, Bichette came up with Joyner on first. Bichette had hit a 
game-winning, 12th-inning homer against Minnesota April 14, but this time he 
flied out to center for the second out. 
</P>
<P>
Bichette did make his presence felt in the field, however, making two nice 
defensive plays in left. 
</P>
<P>
The game was still scoreless with two out in the second inning when the Blue 
Jays put runners on first and second. Shortstop Tony Fernandez drove a Kirk 
McCaskill pitch to deep left-center. The ball looked as if it had a chance to 
go out, but Bichette was there to make the catch, pulling it down near the wall 
in left-center. 
</P>
<P>
Bichette made another good play in the fifth when the Angels were trying to 
keep their hold of that 2-1 lead. With Kelly Gruber on first, George Bell sent 
a ball toward the left-field corner. But Bichette got there, making the catch 
just short of the low, padded wall. 
</P>
<P>
But Bichette's days as the powerhouse of the Angel offense seem to be in the 
past now. While Bichette has slumped, Wally Joyner has spent the month 
increasing his average from a weak .222 on May 5 to a team-leading .318. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner drove in two runs to Bichette's one Thursday, moving to within one of 
Bichette's team-leading 24 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Bichette has made fast starts before. Last year, he hit .388 with four home 
runs during spring training, but ended up spending 61 games at triple-A 
Edmonton, where he hit .243. In 48 games with the Angels, he hit .210. 
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen if this year will be different.

Comments: The Longhorns, who play Texas Arlington today at 5 p.m. PDT, have an 
outstanding pitching staff that has a team earned-run average of 2.95. Their 
ace is junior right-hander Kirk Dressendorfer, who is 12-3 with 148 strikeouts 
and just 31 walks in 120 innings, despite suffering tendinitis in his shoulder. 
Their No. 2 pitcher is junior left-hander Brian Dare, who is 7-2 with a 2.85 
ERA and 78 strikeouts. Texas, which won 16 consecutive games from March 19 to 
April 13, is led offensively by sophomore third baseman Clay King (.357, 17 
doubles, 43 RBIs), junior second baseman David Tollison (.355, 12 home runs, 20 
doubles, 66 RBIs), senior center fielder Lance Jones (.352, 13 doubles, seven 
triples, 49 RBIs) and freshman first baseman Scott Pugh (.342, six home runs, 
15 doubles, 30 RBIs). The Longhorns will make their 36th playoff appearance, an 
NCAA record. They have played in the College World Series a record 25 times, 
winning four national championships. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clemson 
</P>
<P>
Record: 42-21 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Bill Wilhelm, 33rd year 
</P>
<P>
Conference finish: Second in the Atlantic Coast 
</P>
<P>
How got here: At-large berth 
</P>
<P>
Ranking: 23rd by Collegiate Baseball-ESPN 
</P>
<P>
Comments: The Tigers, who play Creighton today at 11 a.m., have been a streaky 
team. They opened with a 19-2 record but have gone 23-19 since March 22 and 
have lost five of their last six games. They have a .305 team batting average 
but have hit .266 in the last 12 games. Clemson's best player is junior 
outfielder Brian Kowitz, who is batting .402 with 21 doubles, five triples and 
59 RBIs. Kowitz, the leadoff batter who had a 37-game hitting streak at one 
point this season, doesn't have blazing speed but has stolen 32 bases in 40 
attempts. He has made one error in three seasons. Sophomore designated hitter 
Joe DeBerry, the son of Air Force Academy football Coach Fisher DeBerry, is 
batting .378 with 15 home runs and 68 RBIs, and junior first baseman Eric 
Macrina is hitting .339 with 16 homers and 62 RBIs. Clemson doesn't have much 
pitching depth, but the Tigers do have one solid starter in junior right-hander 
Tim Parker, who is 7-4 with a 2.54 ERA and 89 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
Record: 32-21 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Larry Cochell, third year 
</P>
<P>
Conference finish: First in the Big West 
</P>
<P>
How got here: Automatic berth for winning the conference 
</P>
<P>
Ranking: 17th by Collegiate Baseball-ESPN, 21st by Baseball America 
</P>
<P>
Comments: The Titans' 6 p.m. game against Old Dominion tonight will mark their 
13th playoff appearance in 16 years. But for the first two months of the 
season, it didn't appear Fullerton would challenge for a playoff berth. The 
Titans struggled offensively, received sporadic pitching performances and 
played .500 ball throughout February and March. But they got hot as conference 
play started and have been on a roll ever since, winning 14 of their last 19 
games. Fullerton has three solid starting pitchers in right-handers James 
Popoff (10-4, 3.66 ERA) and Sam Colarusso (6-3, 3.30 ERA) and lefty Huck Flener 
(7-1, 3.78 ERA), but much of their success could depend on reliever Chris 
Robinson. Third baseman Phil Nevin, the leadoff hitter who is batting .353 with 
14 home runs and 48 RBIs, has keyed the offensive surge, and the Titans have 
two consistent hitters behind him in second baseman Mate Borgogno (.379, 15 
doubles, 53 RBIs) and left fielder Rich Gonzales (.382, 37 RBIs). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Old Dominion 
</P>
<P>
Record: 40-17 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Pat McMahon, first year 
</P>
<P>
Conference finish: Second in the Sun Belt 
</P>
<P>
How got here: At-large berth 
</P>
<P>
Ranking: Unranked 
</P>
<P>
Comments: McMahon, a former Mississippi State assistant who replaced Mark 
Newman as coach last August, has had success using many of the players from 
last season's 26-26 team. But part of the Monarchs' resurgence can be 
attributed to a newcomer, freshman pitcher Steve Lyons from West Springfield, 
Va. The right-hander went 10-2 with a 3.18 ERA during the regular season, 
striking out 54 and walking 35 in 99 innings. Old Dominion's two other top 
starters are sophomore right-hander Jeff Ware (9-2, 3.52 ERA, 72 strikeouts) 
and junior lefty George Sells (4-3, 3.74 ERA.) Sells plays the outfield when he 
isn't pitching and is one of the Monarchs' top hitters with a .353 average, 
nine home runs and 35 RBIs. Other top offensive players are outfielder Scott 
Thomson (.401, five homers, eight triples, 17 doubles, 38 RBIs), third baseman 
Ty Hawkins (.333, 24 RBIs) and catcher Scott Hafling (.325, 23 RBIs). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Creighton 
</P>
<P>
Record: 46-20 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Jim Hendry, sixth year 
</P>
<P>
Conference finish: Third in the Missouri Valley 
</P>
<P>
How got here: At-large berth 
</P>
<P>
Ranking: 24th by Baseball America 
</P>
<P>
Comments: The Bluejays, who finished behind NCAA participants Wichita State and 
Southern Illinois in their conference, set a school record for victories and 
will be making their first playoff appearance in 18 years. They have one of the 
nation's top pitchers in junior left-hander Dan Smith, who is 13-3 with a 1.71 
ERA. Smith, who led Team U.S.A. in seven statistical categories last summer, 
set school records for complete games (11), shutouts (five), strikeouts (126) 
and fewest earned runs allowed by a starter (21). Creighton's No. 2 pitcher is 
right-hander Mike Heathcott, who is 7-2 with a 3.32 ERA. Offensively, the 
Bluejays are led by sophomore first baseman Scott Stahoviak, who is batting 
.406 and leads the team with 86 hits, 61 runs and 24 doubles. He has 45 RBIs 
and has struck out only 27 times in 212 at-bats. Third baseman Pat Mooney leads 
the team in home runs with nine but hasn't hit one since April 24. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Texas Arlington 
</P>
<P>
Record: 31-28 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Butch McBroom, 17th year 
</P>
<P>
Conference finish: First in the Southland 
</P>
<P>
How got here: Automatic berth for winning the conference 
</P>
<P>
Ranking: Unranked 
</P>
<P>
Comments: McBroom has won more than 500 games in 19 years as a head coach, but 
this will be his first trip to the NCAA tournament. The Mavericks were 9-17 in 
mid-March but have gone 22-11 in the second half of the season. They swept a 
doubleheader from Sam Houston State on the final day of conference play to win 
their first-ever Southland championship. Mirroring the team's turnaround has 
been sophomore shortstop Lawrence Hanlon, who started the season with a 
1-for-37 slump but hit .500 (22 for 44) in conference games. Outfielder Tony 
Vilaros leads the team in hitting with a .323 average, five home runs and 33 
RBIs, but the Mavericks, with a .253 team batting average, don't have much 
offensive punch. Their top pitcher is junior right-hander Lee Jones, a transfer 
from Louisiana Tech who has an 8-4 record and a 3.16 ERA. Texas Arlington has a 
solid reliever in sophomore right-hander Gary Paul, who has appeared in 26 
games and has a 2-2 record, 2.41 ERA and five saves.

HUNTINGTON BEACH'S FIGHTING LIFEGUARD SURVIVES HEAD BUTT TO WIN

When John Armijo's fight with Robert Jackson was stopped after four rounds 
Thursday because of a cut above Armijo's eye that was caused by an 
unintentional head butt, Armijo looked worried. 
</P>
<P>
But as the ring announcer slowly explained that the fighter suffering from the 
butt could not lose the fight, Armijo managed a slight grin. 
</P>
<P>
When it was then announced the fight would be decided by the judges, a smile 
came across the Huntington Beach resident's face. Armijo (9-0-1) was ahead, 
40-36, on all three cards over Jackson (6-11) of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't sure of the rules," said Armijo, who is a Huntington Beach lifeguard. 
"I just come here to fight. That's what I worry about." 
</P>
<P>
Armijo, a middleweight who has become very popular at Irvine in the past year, 
made his main-event debut Thursday before a sellout crowd of 1,450. It was the 
largest audience of the year at the Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
Armijo's usual band of supporters, mostly co-workers, were in the back of the 
room chanting his name three fights before he came into the ring. 
</P>
<P>
Armijo was calmer than usual before the fight, and continued his slow actions 
in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to pace myself," he said. "Sure, I was a little nervous, but this 
was a learning experience and I can build on it." 
</P>
<P>
Armijo picked it up in the next three rounds, though. He was clearly the more 
aggressive fighter, landing several solid rights on the chin of Jackson in the 
second and third rounds. 
</P>
<P>
The two boxed in close for most of the third. Then, about halfway through the 
fourth, the head butt caused a deep gash above Armijo's left eye. 
</P>
<P>
After the cut, Armijo stood up and dared Jackson to punch him as blood gushed 
from the wound. There was one more solid exchange before time ran out and the 
ring-side doctor halted the bout. 
</P>
<P>
"I was getting him ready," Armijo said. "I was confident the knockout was going 
to come. I just needed a little more time."

MIYAHARA PITCHES NO-HITTER FOR MARINA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Janet Miyahara's no-hitter led Marina High School to a 5-0 victory over Lompoc 
in a Southern Section 5-A quarterfinal softball game at Lompoc Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Miyahara (14-1) struck out eight and walked one. It was her second no-hitter of

</P>
<P>
Marina (26-5) scored three runs in the sixth inning and two in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Muche scored the first run on Becky Toler's squeeze bunt. Toler later 
scored on a wild pitch and Julie Luft hit a solo home run to cap the scoring in 
the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
In the seventh, Muche hit a two-run double to score Becky Tackett and Crista 
Yorke. Tackett and Luft each had two hits for Marina.

EL TORO GETS JUST ENOUGH OFFENSE TO STOP PALMDALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

EL TORO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Offense has been a scarce commodity for El Toro much of this season, but the 
Chargers generated enough hits Thursday to complement their usually strong 
pitching and defense. 
</P>
<P>
Four hits and some shaky fielding by Palmdale added up to a 3-0 victory for 
top-seeded El Toro in a quarterfinal softball game. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro (24-8) advances to the semifinals for the first time since 1986, taking 
on Saddleback Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers took a 2-0 lead in the third inning, taking advantage of two 
Palmdale errors. With two on and one out, Karie Yoshioka hit a ground ball that 
bounced wildly off the knee of Palmdale shortstop Cheree Rogers into right 
field. The error allowed Kymm Maniscalco to score from second. 
</P>
<P>
An errant throw home by right fielder Rachael Medina went to the backstop and 
Charger Corrie Yauney beat the throw to the plate by catcher Debby Dimeglio for 
the second run. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro added its other run in the fourth on an infield single by Maniscalco 
with the bases loaded. The senior center fielder was two for two with one run 
batted in. 
</P>
<P>
The lead was more than enough for Paige Lauby, who earned her third victory of 
the playoffs. Lauby (14-2) struck out 10 and gave up three hits while running 
her playoff scoreless streak to 28 innings. Lauby has compiled 44 strikeouts 
during the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
Lauby, a senior right-hander, said the effects of pitching all 14 innings in a 
1-0 victory over Trabuco Hills Tuesday took its toll.

Garden Grove High School made Buena Park sweat right up to the last game of the 
last match of the Southern Section 4-A badminton final. But Buena Park took the 
final game to win the championship, 10-9, at Cypress College. 
</P>
<P>
The Buena Park players on the bench cheered as if they had already won the 
championship when, with the score tied at 9-9, their best boys' doubles team of 
Eric Chin and Anh Le were playing in the last match of the meet against Garden 
Grove's second team of Sung Chang and Spencer Kim. 
</P>
<P>
Chin and Le dominated the first game, 15-4, but Chang and Kim shocked the 
Coyotes in the second game, winning, 15-3. 
</P>
<P>
Chin and Le's teammates finally rushed the court to celebrate after they won 
the third and deciding game, 15-10. 
</P>
<P>
But when Buena Park Coach Michelle Tafoya was asked what matches she thought 
were most important, Chin's and Le's final doubles victory was not the first to 
come to mind. Tafoya said that the key victory was Scott Lee's victory over 
Sung Choi. "We had to win that one," Tafoya said. 
</P>
<P>
Lee dropped the first game, 12-15. By the time he had beaten Choi, 15-12, in 
the second game, matches that had started at the same time were long since 
over. Lee was frustrated in the third match, several times pounding his fist 
into the floor after losing points to Choi but finally ended the marathon 
match, 17-15. 
</P>
<P>
Chin's and Le's doubles victory and Lee's key singles win may have been 
meaningless if it hadn't been for earlier victories by Buena Park's Noy 
Sundara, the Southern Section 4-A division girls' singles champion. 
</P>
<P>
Sundara won both of her singles matches, beating Ly Huynh, 11-1, 11-2, and Hanh 
Vu, 11-1, 11-4. Sundara, along with doubles partner Sandy Chun, beat Nicole 
Nguyen and Thao Vo, 11-15, 15-2, 15-4, and Xuan Nguyen and Dao Pham, 15-3, 
15-0.

MEDTRONIC UNIT GETS $6-MILLION SOVIET CONTRACT; 
</P>
<P>
COMMERCE: ANAHEIM-BASED DIVISION TO SUPPLY 20,000 BLOOD OXYGENATORS TO THE 
MINISTRY OF HEALTH, WHICH WILL DISTRIBUTE THEM TO ITS NATION'S HOSPITALS.

<P>
An Anaheim division of a Minneapolis biomedical manufacturer will supply 20,000 
blood oxygenators to hospitals in the Soviet Union under a contract that 
company officials valued at $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Medtronic Cardiopulmonary, a 380-employee division of Medtronic Inc., 
manufactures the Maxima blood oxygenator, a disposable device used to perform 
the functions of the lungs during open-heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Winston R. Wallin, Medtronic's chairman and chief executive, said Thursday that 
the sale is the largest the Minneapolis firm has ever made in Eastern Europe. 
It is also believed to be the largest single Soviet purchase of oxygenators 
from a U.S. company. Two other Orange County firms -- Shiley Inc. and Baxter 
Healthcare Corp.'s Bentley Laboratories division, both in Irvine -- have made 
smaller sales of oxygenators to the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
Medtronic will begin shipping the oxygenators to the Soviet Union in June, said 
Willard Lewis, general manager of the Anaheim division. The Soviet Union's 
Ministry of Health will distribute the devices to various hospitals that 
perform open-heart surgery in the Soviet Union, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Hokkaido Takushoku Bank Ltd. of Japan has issued a letter of credit 
guaranteeing that Medtronic will receive payment for the equipment in U.S. 
dollars, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
"We estimate that this order would comprise the majority of the oxygenator 
requirements of the Soviet health ministry for a year," said Jim Pacek, the 
division's marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations with Soviet ministry officials and Medtronic representatives in 
Paris and Anaheim began last July after Soviet officials visited Medtronic's 
Anaheim facility, Medtronic officials said. Under the contract, Medtronic will 
also provide technical and educational support to the Soviets, said Dick Reid, 
a Medtronic spokesman in Minneapolis. Medtronic will send technicians to Soviet 
hospitals to train their medical staffs, and some Soviet doctors, medical 
technicians and health ministry officials will receive training at Medtronic's 
European headquarters in Paris.

reuse them? And what about aerosol sprays that replace propellants that eat the 
Earth's ozone layer with others that produce smog? 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to guide shoppers through the maze, a national group this month 
will unveil an environmental "seal of approval" modeled after programs in West 
Germany, Canada and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The Green Seal, a nonprofit corporation based in Washington, expects by late 
this year to begin awarding its logo to products it judges environmentally 
sound, Chairman Denis Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, who was instrumental in establishing the first Earth Day in 1970 and was 
the head of one of the major Earth Day 1990 organizations, said that national 
polls show a majority of U.S. consumers want to buy products that are 
environmentally responsible. 
</P>
<P>
But with so many marketing claims being pitched by manufacturers and challenged 
by environmental groups, Hayes fears that consumers sincerely interested in 
using their buying power to help the environment will be turned off. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't know who to trust," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Green Seal's program, in which companies or the public would suggest products 
to be judged, will rely on an independent panel of scientific and technical 
experts, Hayes said. Independent laboratories will be used to ensure that 
manufacturers' claims are accurate. 
</P>
<P>
The manufacturers will be asked to pay the costs of judging and testing 
products and awarding the logo. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to give the public a thumbs-up or a thumbs-down on a basis they can 
understand," Hayes explained. 
</P>
<P>
Another labeling venture -- Scientific Certification Systems Inc. of Oakland, 
Calif. -- is a private, profit-making laboratory that intends to award a green 
cross to products it certifies; the cost to companies will vary from a few 
hundred dollars to $10,000, depending on the amount of research necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Industry groups are carefully watching the "eco-labeling" movement in the 
United States and abroad, according to Theresa Pugh, director of environment 
for the 13,500-member National Manufacturers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
She said that the trade group did not want to comment on any particular 
labeling program but generally was concerned that symbols could be simplistic 
and fail to take into account a product's total life span, from manufacture to 
disposal. 
</P>
<P>
"We're urging companies to seriously look at this before they place that logo 
on their product because the public can be easily confused and become 
distrustful of industry," Pugh warned. 
</P>
<P>
She said there are limitations in what can be easily conveyed to the public in 
"buzz phrases" on packaging. "If the public wants a more reasonable, 
thought-out, meticulous approach to environment in terms of industry, they're 
going to have to give us some time to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Ray Goldberg, a professor at the Harvard Business School who studies U.S. 
agribusiness from farms to supermarkets, said that "green" consumers are a 
large, growing market. "People do take this labeling very seriously; I don't 
think it is a fad." 
</P>
<P>
"They are trying to make this a better place to live and they don't think of 
this as a do-gooder segment of society, or a small segment of society any 
more," said Goldberg, who has studied the Canadian labeling program. 
</P>
<P>
He said shoppers "are willing to pay a premium to make sure what they're 
getting is really biodegradable." 
</P>
<P>
Labeling programs also are being developed in Norway, Sweden and France; and 
the European Community wants to begin a labeling program before the 12 nations 
unify their markets in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Of those countries, only Norway provides a model for a private, nonprofit 
approach rather than government sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
The labeling programs in other countries are administered by a government 
agency, usually with an independent advisory board and the involvement of the 
public. All of the programs have been modeled after West Germany's program, 
which is the oldest. 
</P>
<P>
Since Germany's program was established in 1978 by the Federal Environment 
Agency, more than 3,100 products in 57 categories have been awarded a Blue 
Angel seal. 
</P>
<P>
Industry and consumers have embraced the German program, says a December report 
done for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency office of pollution 
prevention. "A survey of 3,000 households in 1987 showed that 78.9% were 
familiar with the Blue Angel label. Consumer demand for recycled paper products 
and . . . paints with the Blue Angel logo has been healthy," the report states. 
</P>
<P>
The German government says the program has reduced solvents from household 
paints entering the waste stream by 40,000 tons. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its success, the German program has been criticized for not paying 
enough attention to the overall quality of products, for outdated criteria in 
selecting products and for picking products based on only one reason. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian labeling program, administered by Environment Canada, equivalent 
to the U.S. EPA, reviews products on a much broader basis. Products must be 
environmentally sound in their production, use and disposal, without any 
reduction in performance and safety. It was begun last year, and only about 10 
products have been awarded the Canadian Eco-Logo.

THAT MISSED BREAKFAST MAY NOT BE A PROBLEM AT ALL; 
</P>
<P>
DIETS: A MAGAZINE DEBUNKS TRADITIONAL THINKING ABOUT THE MORNING MEAL. THE 
ARTICLE CONTENDS THAT 'WE'VE BEEN CONNED.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The days when mom forced you to eat your oatmeal before you jumped on the 
school bus are long gone. 
</P>
<P>
Today, despite the morning chaos as you get your children on the bus before you 
head for work, an inner voice that sounds a lot like mom's might be reminding 
you to eat breakfast. If you don't, you may feel guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Many of us share that belief in breakfast. A study by the Kellogg Co. showed 
that nine out of 10 people consider breakfast important, and more than 
two-thirds believe it is very important. 
</P>
<P>
But an article in a recent issue of Self magazine debunks traditional thinking 
about the morning meal, contending that "we've been conned." 
</P>
<P>
"I think the most important thing we need to say about breakfast is it's as 
important as any other meal you eat during the day, not more so," said Trish 
Thompson, the magazine's health editor. "What's important is what you eat. It's 
not what the meal is called, or when it happens." 
</P>
<P>
The idea that breakfast is the most important meal of the day partially stems 
from a 1940s test that was conducted in Iowa's public schools. That study found 
that children who ate breakfast performed better on tests than children who did 
not. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine article, however, said the Iowa test held the potential for bias 
because students and teachers knew who had and had not eaten breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
Also, findings that apply to children might not be relevant for adults. 
Children have a higher energy, or caloric, requirement in relation to their 
body weight than adults. 
</P>
<P>
But the energy requirements of adults who work out in the morning or perform 
heavy physical labor are greater than those who sit at a desk. These people 
should eat breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
"What we know from studies is that if you're either doing a hefty amount of 
exercise first thing in the morning or have a physically taxing job, it's 
probably a good idea to eat something," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
"You're using up a lot of energy at the beginning of the day after having 
fasted all night. If you're somebody who's running 10 miles in the morning, you 
ought to eat something." 
</P>
<P>
The type of meal best for early morning exercisers is high in carbohydrates, 
which are digested quickly and convert to ready-to-burn glucose. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're heading to the office rather than a track meet, the boost from 
breakfast is probably more psychological than anything else," the magazine 
article reported. 
</P>
<P>
"For many people, skipping breakfast is like getting up on the wrong side of 
the bed. What's on the plate doesn't really matter. If you believe in it, it 
probably helps." 
</P>
<P>
Another false notion is that skipping breakfast will lead to overeating later 
in the day, the magazine said. Eating often is tied more to psychological or 
sensory cues than actual hunger. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to pay more attention to eating because we're hungry, not because we 
see something or smell something we like or because we've grown up hearing that 
we should eat at certain times of the day," Thompson said. "Basically, you 
shouldn't eat breakfast if you're not hungry." 
</P>
<P>
Typical wisdom is that breakfast is important because it breaks a fast of 
several hours. Thompson said each person's energy level differs. And this, he 
said, can determine whether they need to eat breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we all have to pay attention to the physical cues our bodies give off. 
If we really feel lethargic, dragging, and we haven't eaten anything for six or 
seven hours, there's an excellent chance we need to eat," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"But for people who don't have chronic conditions like low blood sugar or 
diabetes, or any health problems, I don't think we need to be concerned about 
measuring the distance between our meals so much. 
</P>
<P>
"You should be paying more attention to how you feel and when you feel best," 
Thompson said. "Some people feel best eating six small meals a day, while 
others feel best eating three meals a day."

LOUISIANA LAWMAKERS OF THE PAST TELL MEMORIES; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICAL LORE: IN A STATE TOURISM PROMOTION, THE SOUTHERN ART OF STORYTELLING 
IS BEING PASSED ON. 
</P>

BATON ROUGE, La. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the steps of the Louisiana State Capitol, the monument to political excess 
built by Huey P. Long, a smaller, temporary monument was erected to forgotten 
people who made politics the most-watched spectator sport in the Bayou State. 
</P>
<P>
Here under a white tent, political old-timers gathered to pass on the stories 
of their generation to a group of wide-eyed schoolchildren who sat rapt with 
attention as legends and lore were passed down. 
</P>
<P>
As part of Louisiana Open House 1990, a tourism promotion put on by the state, 
tents are being erected across the state to pass on one of the South's greatest 
art forms -- that of storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
Johnnie Jones, a grizzled and bent black man who served in the state House 
between 1972 and 1976, starts off telling stories of his childhood in West 
Feliciana Parish, north of Baton Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
He remembers a time when racism was a fact of life and when a parish doctor 
vaccinated white children with a needle and black children with a piece of tin. 
</P>
<P>
"So, Dr. Singletary, yeah, I'm going to call his name, he asked kids what they 
were going to be when they growed up," Jones said. "Most of the kids say they 
going to be a dairy farmer, or they going to be raising cotton." 
</P>
<P>
He explains how the children -- "chirren" as he puts it -- were vaccinated. 
</P>
<P>
"If you'd say to him you was going to be a farmer, he'd say, 'God bless you, 
God bless you.' When he got to me, he asked me what I was going to be when I 
growed up. I said I was going to be a lawyer. He said, 'What else you going to 
be?' I said a lawyer and a state representative. He pushed me on aside and 
didn't even vaccinate me. That's the true story." 
</P>
<P>
The story draws a chorus of "oooohs" from the middle-school children growing up 
in a time when color doesn't seem so important. 
</P>
<P>
For Lillian Walker, another former state representative, a barrier of a 
different kind was broken -- the sex barrier. Walker served from 1964 to 1972, 
and was the first woman legislator in Louisiana since the late 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was first elected, someone who wanted to address the House would start 
off, 'Mr. Speaker, gentlemen of the House and Mrs. Walker.' My name got well 
known all over East Baton Rouge Parish," says the prim Walker. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you something that was bad for a woman to serve in the House was 
that there were not enough restrooms. For instance, the women had no restrooms 
because I was the first woman who had served in a number of years. . . . I 
believe now that those facilities have changed. The facilities they have now 
are beautiful," she says proudly. 
</P>
<P>
"But Lillian, they still don't have a speaker in the restroom," interrupts 
Louise Johnson, another former House member from north Louisiana who was in the 
lower chamber from 1972 to 1976. "The men's restroom has a speaker in it, so 
the men could run out and vote if there was something they wanted to vote on. 
But the women's restroom didn't have one." 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, you missed some votes because of that," said Walker, who like Johnson 
has retired. 
</P>
<P>
A few nervous giggles are heard from the kids, who sit forward on the benches 
to catch the words. 
</P>
<P>
The storytelling this spring day is moderated by Chris Faser, who was executive 
secretary to former Gov. Jimmie Davis, the man who made the song "You Are My 
Sunshine" a national treasure and once rode his horse up the very same steps of 
the State Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
Davis recalled later in life the reason he rode Sunshine up the steps in 1963 
was because "he hadn't seen my office before. And he hadn't met the press." 
</P>
<P>
Faser's boss parlayed the song into a B-grade Western movie career and became 
one of the legends of gospel music for writing "You Are My Sunshine," which has 
been translated into literally dozens of languages. 
</P>
<P>
Of such stuff are political legends made in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
It's Faser's turn to weave a story for the children. 
</P>
<P>
"You remember that day somebody brought a snake into the Legislature," Walker 
asks Faser. "There's something I want to ask you. Was that snake real?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it was real, Lillian. This fellow was deathly afraid of snakes. Someone 
had put a toy rubber snake in his desk and he almost broke his leg trying to 
get out," Faser said, chuckling at the memory. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the young pages came up to me and said, 'Mr. Faser,' he said, 'I got a 
live snake at home.' I said, 'Bring it up here.' We set it up with one of the 
TV people to interview this representative. This young boy had it wrapped all 
around him, put a coat over him. Just as they started the interview, he took 
the coat off, and stuck this snake in (the lawmaker's) face with its tongue 
moving all around. 
</P>
<P>
"He took off running, went up to the governor's office. He said, 'Governor, 
you're going to have to move me somewhere else. Those people are going to kill 
me!' " 
</P>
<P>
After the laughter subsided, Walker told a legendary story about Rep. Risley 
(Pappy) Triche, a colorful lawmaker in a political body that was stuffed to the 
rafters with such characters. 
</P>
<P>
"You remember the time Pappy Triche got up to the microphone to handle that 
bill and he had worked on that thing, all the debate he put on it, and had 
everybody in the House ready to vote on it?" Walker asked Faser. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, somebody sent up a note that said they were agin' the bill. He said, 
'Now that I've given y'all the good parts, I'm going to give you the bad parts' 
and ended up killing the bill." 
</P>
<P>
An uneasy silence followed the giggles from the schoolchildren, and Faser 
implored the kids to ask some questions. 
</P>
<P>
"Come on, girls and boys, don't be timid this morning. Come on, ask us some 
questions." 
</P>
<P>
"Was there any racism among the legislators when you served?" a young black 
girl asked Jones. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was, I tell you, it wasn't among the legislators. I couldn't find 
it," replied Jones, who today still practices law. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said she didn't see anyone treat her differently for being a woman. 
</P>
<P>
"I became known as 'that woman,' not Louise Johnson. I miss it. I love the old 
pot suppers down in Union and Claiborne parishes. I enjoyed the political 
arena," she said wistfully. 
</P>
<P>
After 45 minutes, the storytelling was over and the children made their way 
back to their school buses, swapping and embellishing the stories they'd just 
been told. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, Johnson, Walker and Faser made their way back to their cars, retreating 
again into the anonymity of being former Louisiana lawmakers.

MARKET'S BOOTHS DISH UP JAPANESE-STYLE FAST-FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
COSTA MESA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At Yaohan Market, you can find anything from a chair that massages your head to 
a scoop of Japanese red-bean ice cream served at a Robin Rose stand. Have the 
ice cream -- it'll set you back a lot less than the chair, and we can all use 
more dietary fiber. 
</P>
<P>
The place is organized a little like the Irvine Ranch Market at Fashion Island: 
a supermarket plus a lot of little booths and a collection of tables, all under 
a single roof. Six of the booths (including the ice-cream stand) are grouped 
together as the Food Court, a term which in Japan refers to a dimly lit cluster 
of stalls found at every major department store, usually on an upper floor 
somewhere. Here in Costa Mesa the stalls sit in a bright, spacious area on the 
ground floor. 
</P>
<P>
Well, hey, this isn't Japan. But just as in Japan, the stalls at the Food Court 
sell the kinds of food Japanese people eat on the run (and I don't mean 
McDonald's). A full-fledged sushi bar sequestered behind Japanese curtains is 
the nearest thing to an actual restaurant. At all the other stalls, you order 
your food, wait until your number is called and take it to one of the tables to 
dig in. 
</P>
<P>
At lunchtime the table area is packed, mostly with working women and Japanese 
housewives shopping with their small children. A moderate number of businessmen 
from local Japanese firms can be found hunched over heaping plates of rice and 
curry. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike a food court in Japan, however, this one also gets quite a few 
non-Japanese curiosity seekers who have never seen much of this stuff before. 
You'll find them staring in wonderment at the more exotic-looking dishes, or 
rather at the wax models of dishes on display at every stall. The craftsmanship 
on the models, by the way, is astonishing. 
</P>
<P>
The sushi bar, Hakone, must have the lowest prices in Southern California, 
starting at $1.50 per order. However, the sushi is merely competent, and it's 
no surprise that you'll find a smaller proportion of Japanese eating here than 
at any of the other concessions. There is a good mirugai (giant clam) at only 
$2 per order. The eel is fine too, at an unheard-of $2.50. But the uni (sea 
urchin), at $3.50 the most expensive item on the list, has almost no flavor at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
You'll find most of your favorites here: Spanish mackerel, tuna, the various 
hand rolls such as salmon skin or California, a combination of crab and 
avocado. The sushi men are very speedy, so if you're looking for a quick fix 
you've come to the right place. 
</P>
<P>
But if there is one thing that the Food Court demonstrates, it is that sushi is 
not necessarily what Japanese people prefer to eat for lunch. If you want to 
know what they really eat in Japan, look no further than Atami, a rice bowl and 
bento stand. Be prepared to stand in line, because this place is popular. 
</P>
<P>
Bento, the Japanese box lunch served in a lacquered tray, has infinite variety, 
but a few basic components might be rice, pickles, sashimi, some stewed or 
fried vegetables and a few fish cakes. The bento I tasted at Atami, 
unfortunately, was totally uninteresting. Almost nothing on it, from the cold, 
soggy tempura to a rubbery, flavorless fish cake, had any personality. 
</P>
<P>
My advice here would be to go with a plate of their tonkatsu curry, a 
reasonably good breaded pork cutlet on a mountain of steamed rice smothered 
with a thick, sweet curry paste. This is a filling dish and you may not be able 
to finish it. Atami also prepares rice bowls (donburi) topped with tempura, 
chicken or beef. All are reliable and, again, really filling. So if you're 
really hungry, line up. 
</P>
<P>
Surugaji is a noodle shop specializing in ramen, long, skinny noodles in 
garlicky broth with a variety of toppings. You eat the noodles with chopsticks, 
slurping permitted, and then you drink what's left over. In Japan, men eat 
ramen in the evening but women rarely eat it at all because of its strong 
flavors. 
</P>
<P>
Surugaji ramen comes in a huge bowl topped with a variety of finely shredded 
vegetables, such as spinach and bamboo, amid slices of pork and hard-cooked 
egg. They also serve ramen with seafood, fish cakes, or beef. You can't go 
wrong. The noodles here are fresh and well prepared, as good as you have a 
right to expect. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, for ramen you can substitute soba, the thicker, more nutritious, 
more traditionally Japanese buckwheat noodles. Ask for plain dashi (broth made 
from shitake, and dried fish) to go with the soba. It's the lightest noodle 
dish I know of. 
</P>
<P>
Pasco is really a bread company, one of Japan's largest, and the Pasco 
Cafeteria stall is really a bakery. But it's also the place to go for yakisoba, 
noodles cooked on a griddle with pork and eaten with ginger and seaweed. You 
get a free show when you order it -- Toshiko-san, the manager, prepares it with 
gusto behind the kitchen window. 
</P>
<P>
But even if yakisoba isn't your thing, there is much else to enjoy here. 
Toshiko-san also makes one of the city's best clam chowders: a thick, creamy 
chowder with lots of potato, just the way they make it in Tokyo (where clam 
chowder is very popular). 
</P>
<P>
Very interesting is imagawa-yaki, little pancakes usually filled with sweet 
bean paste but here enjoyably Americanized with a rich custard cream filling 
laden with golden raisins. 
</P>
<P>
There are also various Western dishes popular in Japan such as pizzas, puddings 
and pastries, all subtly altered to suit Japanese tastes. Try the coffee Jell-O 
with whipped cream or the wonderful Black Forest torte. The coffee's good, too. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Expess is one you've seen before, the sort of fast-food Chinese 
operation found at almost any American shopping mall. The service is from a 
steam table and features egg rolls, sweet and sour pork, kung pao chicken, and 
. . . well, you already know the menu. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sorry, I didn't try any of these familiar-sounding dishes, although a great 
many people seemed to be eating them. You may have to be Japanese to eat 
Chinese food at a Japanese market.

<P>
If in your Walter Mitty dreams you see yourself as a celebrated chef, join the 
next "participation cooking class" at Mr. Stox in Anaheim on June 15. You even 
get to wear a toque. The evening will celebrate seafood and wines of the Loire 
Valley. Once outfitted with aprons and side cloths, participants will be 
divided into small groups and assigned a course to prepare, cook and serve. No 
experience is needed. 
</P>
<P>
The session begins at 6:30 p.m., and it's $70 per person, gratuity included.

COMING AND GOING: Alfredo Rivas, who has managed Zeppa, Five Feet and Trees, is 
now manager of Emperor's Fortune restaurant in South Coast Village in Santa 
Ana. The restaurant has expanded its lunch and dinner menus, adding several 
vegetarian dinners, soft shell crab, tea smoke duck, flaming lobster and more. 
And the carts have just arrived for serving dim sum. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Eugenio Martignago from Bistango will be chef for the new Rex of Newport, due 
to open in Newport Beach's Fashion Island in October. Incidentally, the new 
restaurant will become Rex Chandler's special-occasion showpiece. The 
oceanfront Rex, to be re-named 21 Oceanfront, will offer more popular prices, 
but Chandler promises everything else will remain the same. 
</P>
<P>
YOU CAN GET THERE FROM HERE: The Mezzanine opened last month in the Brinderson 
Towers at MacArthur Boulevard and Jamboree Road in Newport Beach, but the trick 
is to figure out how to get to it. The secret: the entrance is on Fairchild 
Road, which arcs between Jamboree and MacArthur, just north of their 
intersection. The Swiss owner, Christopher Boo (pronounced "beau"), a chef by 
training and graduate of a Swiss hotel school, served as restaurant manager for 
the Newport Four Seasons before opening the Mezzanine. He brought his brother, 
Juerg, from Switzerland to be chef. The restaurant serves breakfast in the bar 
area from 7 to 10 a.m.; lunch is from 11:30 to 2:30, but an all-day menu is 
available from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. in the restaurant or to go. Boo plans to begin 
dinner service at the Mezzanine by the end of the year. Information: (714) 
724-1066.

ADIEU: Showley-Wrightson in Eastbluff shopping center, Newport Beach, has 
closed. The hoped-for baton-passing to former employees didn't jell. 
</P>
<P>
WHAT'S NEW: A third Gambino's (there's one in Mission Viejo and another in San 
Clemente) debuted in Fullerton last week, a remodel of the former Jimmy's 
family restaurant. Owner Hadi Gambino promises "exactly the same menu" (and 
it's a big one, with eight veal dishes, 10 chicken entrees) as in the other 
restaurants. Dinner prices range from $4.95 to $12.95, including soup or salad 
and bread. The restaurant is open for lunch Monday through Saturday and dinner 
nightly. The Sunday brunch buffet features everything from antipasti to pasta, 
hot entrees and dessert and includes champagne for $7.95. Information: (714) 
447-1184. . . . Look for a new brew pub, the Fullerton Hofbrau on State College 
Boulevard just south of Chapman Avenue, due to open in about a month. (714) 
870-7400. . . . La Pergola, which recently opened on Harbor Boulevard in Costa 
Mesa, specializes in northern Italian cuisine. It's the joint effort of Joe 
Ingardia (of Ingardia Produce fame), Giuseppe Galatti and Beni Spitoli. The 
restaurant serves lunch Monday through Friday, 11 to 2; and dinner, 5:30 to 10, 
Monday through Saturday. Sunday's it's brunch only -- a buffet of Italian 
specialties -- 11 a.m to 4 p.m., $14.95 for adults; half-price for children 
under 10. Information: (714) 646-1225.

FRIENDLY SEA RIVALS;

<P>
2 HIGH SCHOOL SAILING TEAMS SHARE COACH BUT STILL COMPETE INTENSELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CARMICHAEL, Alan Carmichael is a sophomore at Corona del Mar High 
School, where he is a reporter on the student newspaper, the Trident, and a 
member of the school's cross-country, soccer, track and field, and sailing 
teams. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As far as high school rivalries go, the one between Corona del Mar and Newport 
Harbor is as intense as any. When these schools compete, pride is as much a 
factor as athletic or intellectual ability. 
</P>
<P>
But amid this turbulence there is also a peaceful coexistence -- a calm, if you 
will, on the water. For there, student sailing teams from both schools practice 
together, travel together and even share the same coach -- Bill Wakeman, who is 
an English teacher at Newport Harbor as well as an accomplished sailor. 
</P>
<P>
This togetherness has caused a change in some perceptions of the rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the sailing team, I have good friends over at Harbor, and my 
attitude toward their school has changed for the better," said Darren 
Sutherland, a Corona del Mar senior and sailor since age 11. "I'm not into the 
rivalry between Corona and Harbor. To me, it's just another game." 
</P>
<P>
And from the rival school? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm more open-minded about other schools because of my friendships on the 
sailing team," said Chris Johnston, a Newport Harbor junior. 
</P>
<P>
The Corona del Mar and Newport Harbor sailing teams have been practicing 
together since 1972, and Wakeman has been their coach from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids have known each other since they were 8 years old, and friendly 
competition has existed for years," said Wakeman, adding that there has never 
been a problem between the schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I do this simply on a volunteer basis because it's a heck of a lot of fun," 
said Wakeman, who has been sailing since he was 9 and competed on the college 
level for Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
The teams practice in the Newport Bay Turning Basin every Monday and Wednesday 
during April and May, the competitive sailing season. 
</P>
<P>
They sail in individually owned Lasers, which are one-man boats, and yacht 
club-owned Collegiate Flying Juniors, which are two-man boats. 
</P>
<P>
Three local yacht clubs -- Bahia Corinthian, Balboa and Newport Harbor -- offer 
both teams financial support as well as loan them sailboats, a coach's boat and 
racing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the clubs should support the schools' sailing teams because 
that's where the future of yachting is coming from," said George Leitch, vice 
commodore of the Balboa Yacht Club. 
</P>
<P>
The 4 1/2-hour practices begin with members rigging their boats at one of the 
three yacht clubs and then making their way to the Turning Basin, which can be 
time-consuming, depending on weather conditions. When both teams arrive, the 
short practice races begin. Wakeman tries to get in as many races as possible 
to emphasize the importance of starting techniques. 
</P>
<P>
The boats sail a triangular course that takes about 20 minutes. Though these 
are informal practice races, there is still some competition between the teams 
as well as between teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Many well-known local sailors have graduated from the schools' sailing teams 
and some have gone on to collegiate success. All-American sailors from Corona 
del Mar include brothers John (UC Irvine) and Mike (Charleston) Pinckney; and 
from Newport Harbor, Hugo Schmidt (USC), Alan Andrews (Stanford) and Jack 
Franco (UC Irvine). 
</P>
<P>
The teams have had great success on the national level, with Newport Harbor 
winning six national high school championship regattas and Corona del Mar 
winning five, with its latest coming in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
This year, both again competed in the national championships May 12 and 13 at 
Annapolis, Md. The regatta was held at the U.S. Naval Academy in conditions 
that were less than perfect. 
</P>
<P>
On the first day of competition, there was no wind and only two races were held 
before the race committee canceled the remainder. The next day, the weather 
took a turn for the worse, with the wind blowing at a gusty 20 m.p.h., 
accompanied by heavy rains. To compound that, there were three- to four-foot 
waves. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Harbor and Corona del Mar teams did not fare well. In the 
double-handed (two-persons in a boat) competition, Newport Harbor finished 11th 
and Corona del Mar 12th in a field of 20 teams. In the single-handed (one 
person) competition, I skippered the Corona del Mar boat to a 32nd-place finish 
in a field of 34. 
</P>
<P>
"We were expecting to do a lot better, but it just didn't come together in the 
end," said Sutherland, who skippered the first Corona del Mar boat, which had 
senior Chris Attencio as the crew and sophomore Keith Geffen as back-up crew. 
The second Corona del Mar boat was skippered by sophomore Bill Ward, with 
sophomore Josh Nichols as his crew. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor's first boat was skippered by junior Jory Twist, with freshman 
Creighton Oyler serving as his crew and Chris Johnston as back-up crew. 
Sophomore Ben Benjamin skippered the second boat, with sophomore Christina 
Allen, the only female member of either team, as his crew. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Corona del Mar and Newport Harbor appear to have had two of the 
most successful sailing records on the West Coast. Tina McKinley, a youth 
racing coordinator for the U.S. Yacht Racing Assn., attributes their success to 
"the culmination of a consistent coach who brought the teams into varsity 
status and parental support." 
</P>
<P>
The success can also be attributed, at least partially, to the teams' combined 
practices, where the more people sailing helps to make the competition stiffer. 
</P>
<P>
And even if the sailors are from rival schools, there's enough camaraderie to 
keep the sails full.

SAFE-RIDES HELPS TEENS WHO DRINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South County Safe-Rides, a student-run program sponsored by Capistrano by the 
Sea Hospital in Dana Point, was recently acknowledged by the Orange County 
Board of Supervisors for its efforts to reduce teen-age drinking and driving. 
</P>
<P>
Launched two years ago, the program provides safe and confidential rides home 
to fellow students in the Dana Point, Laguna Beach and San Clemente areas who 
have been drinking or riding with someone who has. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano by the Sea is the base of operations every Friday and Saturday from 
10 p.m. to 2 a.m. Trained adult volunteers oversee the activities of the 
students. Students who work on the program also participate in the four-hour 
training program directed by the Boy Scouts. It includes CPR training, 
emergency procedures, alcohol awareness and communication skills. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the Safe-Rides program includes discouraging drinking. Students on each 
high school campus form a club to inform other students and pledge never to 
drink and drive. 
</P>
<P>
Students at San Clemente, Dana Hills and St. Margaret's high schools have 
distributed wallet cards and key chains with the Safe-Rides slogan, "Don't 
Drink &amp; Drive, Call 83-ALIVE." 
</P>
<P>
When school resumes in the fall, South County Safe-Rides will expand to include 
all high schools south of Irvine.

SINGLE LIFE: MAKING FRIENDS WITH FORMER LOVER TAKES A LITTLE TIME, EFFORT

<P>
The premise of last year's hit movie "When Harry Met Sally" is that men and 
women cannot maintain platonic relationships. If you accept that premise you 
may also believe it impossible to remain friends with someone you once loved. 
Speaking from my own experience, breaking up and staying friends with a former 
lover is not only possible, it is often preferable. 
</P>
<P>
We had been living together for two years when Alan and I ended our 
relationship. We moved out of the rented home we shared and took separate 
apartments. Our romance was clearly over, but we wanted to stay friends. 
</P>
<P>
We had formed a special bond, almost like family. In many ways, we were each 
other's best friend. And we had not only loved each other, we loved each 
other's children too. We didn't want to give that up. 
</P>
<P>
Through trial -- and considerable error -- we managed to alter the form of our 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Right after the breakup we were both lonely and missed each other. We attempted 
a few bimonthly trysts. Those didn't work because each one reminded us of what 
we once had, leaving us feeling empty, lonely and depressed. We decided it 
would be less painful to keep in touch by phone until the initial pain 
diminished. We talked about once a week, keeping each other current about the 
events in our lives. Sometimes it hurt to hear his news; an upcoming vacation 
in Maui where we had once stayed together, or being invited to the wedding of 
mutual friends. 
</P>
<P>
At the time friends urged a clean break, warning that any attempt to stay 
connected would prove futile. But staying friends felt like the right choice 
for us and we were determined to see it through. Alan continued to visit my 
children, taking them and his on occasional outings. His children and mine 
loved the new arrangement. It made them feel secure to know that they hadn't 
been "divorced," too. In the beginning, I felt awkward, left out. But when I 
saw how much happiness our children derived from it, I began to feel fortunate. 
I wondered how many other men would have made the effort. Alan began dating 
after a couple of months, a blow for me; I hadn't started dating. I called one 
or two former boyfriends, but those reunions did little to salve my hurt 
feelings. Alan was soon seeing someone on a regular basis, a woman he later 
married. It was during their courtship I realized that in my pursuit of 
friendship I had been diverted from the natural process of grieving. 
</P>
<P>
Friendship cannot build from a breakup until the love relationship is 
completely dissolved. Both people must reach a stage of acceptance and work 
through the pain. Alan had processed his grief, I hadn't. He was ready to date, 
I wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
For my sake, we agreed to stop communicating until I felt ready to accept his 
new life and rebuild mine. First -- in an act worthy of Sarah Bernhardt -- I 
took to my bed, gorged myself on home-delivered Chinese food and cried. It 
wasn't long before I grew tired of the self-defeating behavior. 
</P>
<P>
I got active and stayed active. I took a drama class, needlepointed until my 
fingers were numb, got involved in my children's school activities, dropped a 
few pounds and bought some new clothes. Soon I was the old me. 
</P>
<P>
Once the grieving process was complete, a reunion was possible. Alan and I were 
ready to begin a new phase. From that vantage point we were able to see each 
other through different eyes and other expectations. 
</P>
<P>
That was 12 years ago and he remains my best male friend. 
</P>
<P>
Breaking up and staying friends can only be accomplished if you love and 
respect each other and if you have not reached a point of no return, such as 
physical or extreme verbal abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Friendship cannot flourish where unresolved anger is present. A new friendship 
can develop when both parties let go of false hope that the relationship can be 
restored to its former romantic state. It will not work if one person attempts 
friendship, hoping for a possible reconciliation; that's manipulation, not 
friendship. 
</P>
<P>
If you have been edging toward a breakup, chances are communication has already 
shut down. To break up friendly, set aside a relaxed, stress-free time to talk. 
Drive to the beach or visit a quiet place. Make a flexible agenda of what you 
want to say to each other. 
</P>
<P>
Put aside blame and speak from your heart. Acknowledge your partner's 
contribution to your life. Tell your partner what you have gained by his or her 
presence in your life. Offer your support during the transition. 
</P>
<P>
Genuine friendship takes time to develop, but what you end up with may be far 
better than your relationship was as a couple.

MERRY-MAKING ACTOR GOES THROUGH CHANGES PLAYING BIRTHDAY PARTY CHARACTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By NANCY WRIDE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
It's about 120 degrees inside his black leotard, cape and rubber Batman mask as 
Tom Stewart pulls his Chrysler Le Baron to the mouth of a Mission Viejo 
neighborhood. But he's still got his sense of humor for the first of three 
kiddie birthday parties, where he'll be the star attraction. 
</P>
<P>
"Who are you here to see?" the guard at the gated community entrance asks. "I'm 
Batman," Stewart says, in a husky voice. "Here for Greg's fifth birthday party 
at the clubhouse." 
</P>
<P>
The guard doesn't seem amused, and persists with his drill. "What's your last 
name?" he demands. 
</P>
<P>
"Uh . . . Man," quips Stewart, who throws his head back and, with a wacky 
laugh, guns the engine toward the recreation room. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, it's a job. Just when it seemed everyone in Orange County had some boring 
occupation -- developer, census taker, realtor -- meet Stewart, a Teenage 
Mutant Ninja Turtle for breakfast, Elvis Presley at lunch, Pee-wee Herman at 
cocktail hour. 
</P>
<P>
"I get to see people at their best -- when they're happy and celebrating 
something," says Stewart, whose been running his $90-an-hour road show for five 
years. "It's a great job." 
</P>
<P>
Out of his car trunk, the 27-year-old performer transforms himself from Batman 
to Superman and other characters, often in the span of one day. Sometimes he 
changes in his car. On the freeway. Or in the restroom of the nearest fast food 
joint. 
</P>
<P>
"I know how to find every public bathroom in Orange County," he boasts. 
</P>
<P>
Life at the Stewart's Huntington Beach home is interesting. He is married to a 
woman officially recognized for making 10-foot-tall dachshunds out of balloons 
(she is one of seven certified master balloon artists in California). When he 
arrives home from work at night, his 22-month-old son nonchalantly greets him 
with, "Hi Big Bird. Dinner time!" 
</P>
<P>
It is a business to Stewart. Although he hasn't had a weekend off since 1985, 
he grossed $148,000 last year -- netting $27,000. 
</P>
<P>
He makes what! 
</P>
<P>
"Oh sure, absolutely," said Susan Gilbert, owner of Huntington Beach-based 
Animal Crackers Entertainment, a 14-year-old company that employs five 
full-time performers and enlists another 450 free-lancers as needed. "There's 
very good money in this." 
</P>
<P>
And bashes for the kids -- from one-hour performances to extravagant all-day 
soirees -- have in the past year become the biggest part of the business, 
owners of many entertainment firms say. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say 75% of our business is children's parties," said Gilbert, 
Stewart's first employer. "Mickey and Minnie Mouse are always popular. The 
Little Mermaid is big now. Oh! Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, it's absolutely 
crazy the demand for them. We've done these parties that cost up to $5,000. One 
we did for Halloween was about $7,000. That was in Nellie Gail Ranch. We built 
an entire graveyard in this woman's front yard." 
</P>
<P>
In a region where excesses quickly become passe, these extravaganzas for the 
pint-sized continue to grow ever more elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
"We have done several big deals for kids," said Jim Harnage, owner of St. Ives 
catering in Newport Beach. "(At) one they had a big tree in the back yard that 
was in the way of a merry-go-round they were having brought in. So they spent 
thousands of dollars to have it removed with a 50-foot crane. It was 
unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
So keeping in mind that parents of mere kindergartners have been known to drop 
a sum equal to Cal State Fullerton's tuition for party attractions such as 
elephants, Bengal tigers and other circus animals, $90 for Stewart's gig seems 
relatively cheap. 
</P>
<P>
Of the two dozen or so Orange County entertainment specialty firms, no more 
than 10 are considered among various owners as successful businesses. Half of 
those, owners say, are run out of homes, often by college students. Turnover is 
high because the work, which can be erratic, seems deceptively alluring at 
first blush: relatively inexpensive overhead and no real start-up fees beyond 
costumes and mileage. 
</P>
<P>
For those who make money, however, there are a few drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"The only bad part, because the parents get real up-tight, is when you're 
late," Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic is the biggest culprit. But Stewart admits to being a bit 
scatterbrained, which has led to some funny moments. Like the time he got a 
ticket dressed as Santa Claus -- on his birthday. And the time he wrapped his 
car around a freeway berm dressed as Pee-wee Herman (a passing priest 
mercifully delivered him to the party only moments late). Once, he ran out of 
gas as Superman. 
</P>
<P>
He's driven as far as Arizona for a party gig, and he's put 141,000 miles on 
his 4-year-old car. His least favorite performance was his largest: 6,000 
students at a high school homecoming game, at which he hosted the half-time 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
"I was Pee-wee Herman," he remembers. "I had to announce the homecoming court. 
I hated it." 
</P>
<P>
The mishaps, however, have been relatively few and painless. Among the most 
memorable was the time he announced it was time to blow out the birthday 
candles and the 5-year-old birthday boy doused them with spittle. 
</P>
<P>
"The ice cream," he recalls with a grin, "was much more popular at that party." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the heat this Saturday, Stewart's show must go on. 
</P>
<P>
He parks his junk-filled Chrysler on a side street to put the last touches on 
his costume. A guy in a BMW circles suspiciously to watch. Stewart is careful 
to dart behind his car door when kid-filled vans approach the Canyon Crest 
clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't want to spoil the effect," he said, wiping beads of sweat from his 
forehead. He removes blue horn-rimmed glasses and pulls the thick rubber Batman 
mask over his damp brown hair and freckled face. He saves for last the long 
black cape, which billows out from his 6-foot-4 frame. A fetching Batman 
indeed. 
</P>
<P>
"Last Saturday I started out as Big Bird in Cota de Caza, drove to Huntington 
Beach and did Superman at 1 p.m. I was in La Palma at 3 as Elvis, drove to 
Irvine to do Batman at 4:30 and then to Cerritos at 7 p.m. for Jim Ignatowski 
from (the television comedy) 'Taxi,' " Stewart explained. "So today will be 
pretty easy." 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, he said, half his business was in singing telegrams. Now 90% of the 
work is children's parties. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are spending more time at home, and yet they still want the 
kids to have fun but impress their friends too," Stewart speculates. "So what I 
do is perfect for them." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart has for years been interested in the performing arts, although he 
admits he never envisioned himself doing one-hour party gigs. The son of a 
retired cop who worked at the legendary "Fort Apache" police division in the 
Bronx, Stewart took a decidedly different career path. He graduated from Mater 
Dei High School in Santa Ana and worked as a cart boy, range boy, then golf pro 
at Riverview Golf Course. That paid his way through the American Academy of the 
Arts in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
For now his work is satisfying, he said. Of the future? 
</P>
<P>
"I imagine one day I'll probably be famous, but I dunno," he says with a shrug. 
"I just have this feeling . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Inside the air-conditioned community room Batman enters the party, as two-dozen 
wide-eyed kindergartners whisper and giggle and point. 
</P>
<P>
"What's your name?" Batman asks one towhead. "Hamburger," the boy giggles, 
showing off his missing front tooth. One boy won't talk at all. Most of them 
pummel him with questions: "Where's Robin? (He's at the cave.) Where's the 
Batmobile? (It's being fixed at the shop.) Where's the Joker? (Up to no good.) 
</P>
<P>
Heeey, you're not Batman; he's Michael Keaton! (Well, sure, but who do you 
think did all the stunts?) 
</P>
<P>
He enchants the kids with tales about the making of the movie, which most of 
them seem to have at home. He asks them trivia questions, and at least one of 
the children knows every answer, including the name of Batman's butler 
(Alfred). 
</P>
<P>
Pretty soon the group spills outside so that each child can be photographed in 
the palm of Batman's hand. Like a waiter would hold a tray, Stewart hoists 
every child at his shoulder as Polaroids are taken. Eggs would fry on this 
sidewalk. Batman never loses his cool. 
</P>
<P>
Not even after he discovers that one of the pint-sized party-goers has lifted 
his bag of Batman buttons and other party favors and games. 
</P>
<P>
Like any self-respecting Caped Crusader, he organizes a search party and the 
fabric satchel is found. 
</P>
<P>
An hour later, Stewart is back in his car, pulling off the drenched Batman 
mask. His car is a mobile comedy of its own, talking to the feckless performer 
like some nag, badgering him all day: Your car door is ajar. Your brake fluid 
is low. Please fasten your seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
 His Chrysler is his dressing room on wheels. Helter-skelter around the 
interior are disposable razors, hair spray cans, disposable arm shields and 
shoulder pads, white athletic socks, ratty hairbrushes, deodorant, wigs, 
costumes and unopened brake fluid. Oh, and a bullhorn. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to use that to clear traffic," Stewart says with a smirk, "especially 
when I'm dressed as Pee-wee." 
</P>
<P>
By the time he boards the San Diego Freeway he has stripped off the better part 
of his Batman duds. "I'd be in my underwear by now but you're in the car," he 
tells his tag-along. "I'll just have to pull over down the street from this 
place." 
</P>
<P>
That would be in a Fountain Valley tract of homes where one Cody McKennon is 
celebrating his fourth birthday in the back yard. For this Stewart will appear 
as Superman. 
</P>
<P>
Around the corner from the house, he orders his passenger out of the car. "Look 
the other way. This could get ugly," he jokes. Between the curb and his car 
door he proceeds to strip to his own birthday suit, as giggling teen-age girls 
bicycle past. He quickly tugs on a skin-tight blue body suit with a large red 
"S" on the chest. 
</P>
<P>
It is so hot he decides to stuff white athletic socks under his armpits as 
perspiration shields. They look exactly like what they are. He pulls them out. 
With the insertion of the disposable shoulder pads and half a can of hair spray 
plastering his head, he is ready to make his entrance. 
</P>
<P>
He looks good leaping onto the back-yard lawn of Cody's party, and the kids are 
thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
He makes balloon animals, paints their faces with daisies and Batmans and 
stars, plays a game of hide-and-seek, orchestrates a round of duck-duck-goose, 
and finally leads an amusing version of Simon Says. 
</P>
<P>
"If you get out," he warns, "you have to go sit with the parents. Ewwwwww!" The 
children wince as though a foul odor has wafted through the party. They love 
this guy. So does Kim McKennon. 
</P>
<P>
"I like him because I don't have to do the games myself," McKennon, a paralegal 
and single mother, said with a laugh. "I work all week and I'm tired on the 
weekends. Besides, I think it's more fun for the kids to have someone else 
besides their parents" entertain at the party. "We almost had a Ferris wheel 
this year, but I was worried about the insurance because they would have to 
(set it up) in the street in front of the house. I think this is the smallest 
party we've had for Cody." 
</P>
<P>
Another hour and Stewart is back behind the wheel, this time bound for Del 
Taco. En route to another party he changes back into the Batman outfit in the 
fast food restaurant's bathroom, much to the amusement of several burly men 
buying tacos at the drive-through window. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey," hollers one beefy teen-ager, "you forgot your keys in the head, Batman! 
Ha! Ha!" 
</P>
<P>
Hey, it's a job.

SHOWPLACE FOR COUNTY'S ABUNDANT ARTIFACTS LONG OVERDUE, ADVOCATES SAY 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
Flake by painstaking flake, the sloping skull of a long-extinct whale emerged 
from an eight-foot-long cocoon of sedimentary earth and plaster of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to chip any of the fragile bone away," said Marian Meyer quietly 
as she scraped at the partially exposed fossil that sat on a pallet in the back 
room of RMW Paleontologists, a small research company in a light-industrial 
complex on Via Fabricante in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with an assortment of dental tools and delicate chisels, workers at the 
research center have been laboring since January to uncover the 
10-million-year-old fossil, only the second of its kind in the world. 
</P>
<P>
The bone, part of a 40-foot prehistoric baleen whale, was discovered accidently 
last summer at a Laguna Niguel construction site along with thousands of other 
marine fossils. 
</P>
<P>
Once extricated from the silty tomb that helped preserve it for millions of 
years, the whale bone will be sent to the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural 
History for casting, study and storage. 
</P>
<P>
"We work very closely with (Los Angeles)," said paleontologist Rod Raschke, who 
is supervising the work on the whale bone. "They have the facility; we don't." 
</P>
<P>
There is the rub, say boosters of a proposed Orange County Museum of Natural 
History and Science. 
</P>
<P>
More than a decade since a county-commissioned task force recommended a 
centralized museum system, Orange County remains the only urbanized county in 
Southern California without a permanent museum of natural history and science. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, there are scores of collections and small museums scattered 
throughout the county. But as the population -- especially in South County -- 
continues to climb, proponents of a centralized museum say the time has come 
for Orange County to add a world-class museum to its growing number of 
institutions for the arts and sciences. 
</P>
<P>
"The growing population feels deprived" by having no museum to call its own, 
said Dudley M. Varner, executive director of the private, nonprofit Natural 
History Foundation of Orange County. "We hear it all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Without a major museum, researchers and county officials say, there is no place 
for Orange County residents to view the hundreds of thousands of 
paleontological and archeological discoveries that have been turned up in the 
South County over the years. 
</P>
<P>
And just as important, there is no adequate place for researchers to study the 
burgeoning number of local artifacts or to store them in a way that ensures 
there will be no damage to the valuable finds. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had the setup," Raschke said, "we could be doing more of our own 
research." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, members of the Natural History Foundation of Orange County have 
been working with the county to design a state of the art natural history and 
science museum in South Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Although the site has already been established, architectural drawings have 
been completed and there are plenty of Orange County artifacts to fill a 
world-class museum, construction is at least five years away. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really just a question of how to pay for it," said Varner, whose 
foundation is spearheading the drive to establish the permanent museum. "I 
don't think you can open the doors for less than $40 million." 
</P>
<P>
For that kind of money, Varner envisions a 100,000-square-foot facility on a 
25-acre site at Pectin Reef, in the uppermost corner of the newly opened Aliso 
and Wood Canyons Regional Park in Aliso Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Half of the building will be dedicated to displays. Unlike older museums, the 
Orange County facility will use the latest in a growing technique called 
"interpretive display." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of loading the museum shelves and cabinets with thousands of esoteric 
artifacts, Varner said, the staff will set up displays that will explain the 
importance of the artifacts and their relation to one another. 
</P>
<P>
"We will set up the museum in a way that is going to be exciting and 
entertaining," Varner said of his proposed hands-on approach to displaying and 
teaching. "We don't want to be a 'stuffed animal' museum or have exhibits that 
people merely walk past." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the display area in Laguna Niguel, Varner said, the foundation 
is planning three satellite museums. The most likely spots for those facilities 
include the UCI Arboretum on campus, O'Neill Regional Park in Trabuco Canyon 
and the end of the Huntington Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the main facility will be dedicated to laboratory and storage 
space, two aspects of a museum that are as vital to its success as the viewing 
area. 
</P>
<P>
The public and science are suffering, Varner said, because of the lack of 
adequate research space. 
</P>
<P>
At present there are at least three complete whale skeletons encased in 
diatomaceous earth and plaster of Paris in a parking lot of the foundation's 
warehouse in Santa Ana. Researchers have yet to begin work uncovering the 
paleontological treasures. 
</P>
<P>
The whale skeletons are just one example of the tons of artifacts that are 
locked away from the public eye. Countless cartons of bones, teeth, bowls, 
shells, arrowheads and other artifacts have yet to be catalogued, Varner said. 
</P>
<P>
And as residential and commercial construction continues in artifact-rich South 
County, many more are likely to be found. 
</P>
<P>
"The warehouse in Santa Ana is full to overflowing right now," Varner said. 
</P>
<P>
The artifact overcrowding is so severe, in fact, that private developers, who 
are required to turn over all finds to the county, have been forced to 
stockpile them until the county can take control. 
</P>
<P>
At the Newport Coast project in Corona del Mar, for instance, the Irvine Co. 
has filled a fleet of boxcar-size storage bins with artifacts from the 
once-ubiquitous Gabrieleno Indian tribe, whose members camped in the hilly 
coastal country around Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The company is eager to turn the artifacts over, Varner said, but the 
foundation has no storage space left. Foundation members have asked the county 
to study ways to launch a joint public-private venture to help speed along the 
plan for a permanent museum. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, whose district includes the Laguna 
Niguel site, said the board has commissioned a study on the feasibility of a 
public-private project. 
</P>
<P>
But, he cautioned, despite the lofty goal of the foundation members to provide 
the public with a valuable recreational and educational institution, the county 
is not prepared to foot the bill for construction. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of anybody in the county who isn't supportive of a museum," said 
Riley, pointing out that the county has donated the 25 acres of undeveloped 
land for the permanent site. 
</P>
<P>
"But the county can only do so much. Right now, the financing is going to have 
to be found someplace else." 
</P>
<P>
Riley's chief aide, Ken Bruner, added, however, that some funds may be found in 
several departments, including Harbors, Beaches and Parks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's appropriate to do. It's intellectually sound and it's doable 
financially," Bruner said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence G. Barnes, a member of the Los Angeles County Natural History and 
Science Museum, urged the county to not only provide funds for construction, 
but to organize a county museum department. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Orange County Board of Supervisors) have to put their money where their 
mouth is," Barnes said, adding that he feels the museum should be much larger 
that the planned 100,000-square-foot facility. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation, established in 1974 by a group of Newport Beach women, operates 
a natural-history museum out of a 7,000-square-foot room at an abandoned 
Newport Beach elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
A few partitions are set up to separate paleontological from archeological 
exhibits, but the room is so cramped that the museum becomes chaotic when more 
than a couple of classes of schoolchildren attend field trips. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation, however, is on the brink of announcing that it will move the 
small museum to a 40,000-square-foot site by the summer. 
</P>
<P>
But even that will not be nearly large enough to hold all the prehistoric 
treasures and the growing number of scientific exhibits the museum is 
collecting, Varner said. 
</P>
<P>
The largest scientific exhibit will be a mock-up of a space station that will 
eventually be shot into space. The wood and metal laboratory, large enough for 
museum visitors to walk through, is in storage at the El Toro Marine Corps Air

"If you don't have a real good-sized museum, people don't want to come back," 
Varner said. "They will feel like they didn't experience a destination point." 
</P>
<P>
Sites in Costa Mesa, Santa Ana and Aliso Viejo -- a mile from the permanent 
site -- are being considered, Varner said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the foundation is doing what it can to spark public interest in the 
project so that it can raise money for construction and endowment funds. A few 
weeks ago, with the help of the Santa Margarita Co., the foundation sponsored a 
Nature Affair, which raised about $25,000. Other fund-raisers are planned. 
</P>
<P>
Varner said one of his favorite pastimes these days is to stand on the grassy 
ridge overlooking the museum site and picture the glass and concrete building, 
the garden next to a meandering creek and the picnic area that surrounds the 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something the people of Orange County need," Varner said, "to fulfill 
their educational, intellectual and recreational interests."

The San Clemente Animal Shelter has many projects in which volunteers play a 
vital role. "We currently have about 100 volunteers," said Roberta Gorny, 
shelter manager. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of the volunteers work with fund-raising projects, and the others 
staff the shelter. They help us remain pro-life. 
</P>
<P>
"Without the volunteer help, we would not be able to keep up the shelter as we 
do now." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the volunteers' duties include walking and bathing the dogs and taking 
animals to the veterinarian. Volunteers are also trained to issue animal 
licenses and check up on adoptions. 
</P>
<P>
"We currently have a program in which we take pets to schools and educate 
students to care for pets, the importance of licensing and keeping a dog on a 
leash," Gorny said. "We have another program in which volunteers will bring a 
pet to a day-care center or nursing homes for an hour or so." 
</P>
<P>
The main objective for volunteers is to keep the animals happy and adoptable, 
which at the same time fulfills the interest of many volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"We still have most of our original volunteers since the program started in 
January, 1983," Gorny said. "Our volunteers seem to be satisfied by just seeing 
the animals' tails wag." 
</P>
<P>
For details on volunteering your time for the San Clemente Animal Shelter, call 
Michael Ewart, volunteer coordinator, at (714) 492-1617. Volunteers must be at 
least 16 (14- and 15- year-olds may work with a parent).

LUCE SAYS HE WILL RETIRE AS CHAIRMAN OF GREAT AMERICAN 
</P>

<P>
Gordon Luce, chairman and chief executive of Great American Bank, said Thursday 
he will retire this year, once the embattled S&amp;L finds a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
In making the announcement at Great American's annual shareholders' meeting, 
Luce acknowledged reports that have circulated for weeks that he plans to leave 
the S&amp;L this year. Although the S&amp;L has no mandatory retirement age, 
Luce will turn 65 in November. He has been Great American's chief executive 
since 1969 and chairman since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
An executive search committee is looking for a new chief executive, Luce told 
shareholders. As reported earlier, Luce confirmed that Federal Home Loan Bank 
of San Francisco President James Cirona has been offered the job. But Cirona 
removed himself from consideration after he and the S&amp;L's board of 
directors failed to agree to terms. 
</P>
<P>
"The search is not yet concluded, but, when it has, there will be a prompt 
announcement of my successor," Luce told shareholders. "It is time for change, 
and perhaps a new perspective will assist the bank in moving forward in these 
changing times." 
</P>
<P>
In his 21 years at Great American, Luce built the thrift from an obscure 
four-branch institution then known as San Diego Federal to the eighth largest 
S&amp;L in the nation, currently with $15.4 billion in assets and 211 branches. 
He introduced an array of marketing and customer service innovations and 
established a branch network that became the envy of many California financial 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Luce also enjoyed high standing within the S&amp;L industry, partly by virtue 
of his strong political ties to Ronald Reagan, who, as California governor, 
named Luce state secretary of business and transportation. When Reagan was 
President, he appointed Luce to a United Nations post. 
</P>
<P>
But Luce's accomplishments at Great American have been overshadowed in recent 
months by the financial problems that have brought the institution close to 
insolvency. Most of the problems stem from Great American's 1986 acquisition of 
Home Federal Savings of Tucson, from which Great American has reaped a harvest 
of problem loans. 
</P>
<P>
Those bad loans were a major cause of Great American's 1989 losses totaling 
$263.4 million. As a result, Great American has been weakened to the point of 
facing regulatory seizure unless it can find a merger partner or buyer, or 
raise $350 million in outside capital by the end of the year. Great American 
stock has dropped to Thursday's close of $2.25 from a high over the past 12 
months of $14.875. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the five shareholder lawsuits that have been filed against the S&amp;L 
and its executives, Luce and other Great American executives declined to answer 
many shareholder questions on the S&amp;L's finances. Much of Luce's prepared 
speech was taken from previous regulatory filings. 
</P>
<P>
Two dozen shareholders questioned Luce and other executives closely about the 
plunge in Great American's stock price and looming threat of a government 
takeover, but few were openly hostile. 
</P>
<P>
"What's remarkable about the meeting is what didn't happen, that shareholders 
didn't tear the arms and legs off management, given that the stock has been the 
worst performer in San Diego over the past year," said Blaine Roberts, 
president of La Jolla-based Morgan, Roberts &amp; Co., an investment firm with 
a stake in Great American. 
</P>
<P>
"It just goes to show the remarkable amount of good will on the part of the 
community toward the company," Roberts said.

ACTOR VIC TAYBACK OF 'ALICE' DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Service Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vic Tayback, the actor who portrayed loudmouth diner owner and fry cook Mel 
Sharples on the long-running television series "Alice," died early today in his 
sleep of a heart attack. He was 60. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Amsel, Tayback's friend and agent for 20 years, said Tayback was rushed to 
Glendale Adventist Hospital following the heart attack at about 1 a.m., but 
could not be revived. Amsel said Tayback, who underwent triple bypass surgery 
in 1983, was "just fine" on Thursday and had told him he had quit smoking -- 
again. 
</P>
<P>
A popular character actor, Tayback appeared in the motion pictures "Papillon," 
"Bullitt," and "The Choirboys." His television movies included "They Call It 
Murder," "The Night the City Screamed," "The Jesse Owens Story" and "The Three 
Kings." 
</P>
<P>
His character's poor cooking, which became a running gag on the CBS comedy 
series for which he was best known, won Tayback a commercial contract for Heinz 
57 Sauce. After the "Alice" series ended in 1985, Tayback returned to the 
stage, appearing in "12 Angry Men" and "Death of a Salesman."

A Piper 18 Super-Cub aircraft crashed just short of the runway at the Fullerton 
Municipal Airport today and hit a telephone pole, injuring the two men on 
board, a fire official said. 
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred at 10:47 a.m. in an open space in an industrial area near 
Artesia Avenue and just short of the runway. 
</P>
<P>
Names of the injured were not immediately known, and it was unclear how 
seriously injured they are. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving paramedics placed the men on back boards because of possible back 
injuries, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Marshal Marc Martin said the men "managed to get out of the airplane under 
their own power. When the firefighters arrived, they were out of the plane." 
</P>
<P>
"There was no fire," Martin said. "There was some fuel which had spilled from 
the airplane. Both patients have injuries. (I) don't know the extent of their 
injuries." 
</P>
<P>
They were treated at the scene and transported to St. Jude Hospital in 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody on the ground was injured, and, as far as I know, there was no other 
damage on the ground," Martin said.

MAN WHO KILLED 2 STUDIO GUARDS IS RULED INSANE

A former mental patient today was found innocent by reason of insanity in the 
fatal shootings of two Universal Studios guards, in a plea bargain that 
prosecutors say will keep him hospitalized for the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
Nathan Nicholas Trupp, 43, said he understood the terms of his plea and 
acknowledged that he killed guards Jeren Beeks and Armando Torres in a violent 
attack at a Universal Studios gate on Dec. 1, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Trupp, who was sought by New Mexico authorities for investigation of killing 
three people in Albuquerque a few days earlier, went to the studio in search of 
actor Michael Landon. 
</P>
<P>
As the slender, bearded Trupp entered his pleas, the families of the two 
victims sat sobbing in the spectator section of the court. Two of them said 
outside they were pleased that Trupp was now unable to harm anyone else.

MISSING INGLEWOOD BOY, 11, FOUND DEAD DUMPED IN CARPORT

<P>
The body of an 11-year-old Inglewood boy who was reported missing after he 
failed to return home from school Thursday was found dumped in the carport of a 
Hawthorne apartment building, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
The body of William James Tillett of Inglewood was discovered by residents of 
the apartment building about 10:15 p.m. Thursday, five hours after he was 
reported missing by his mother, Inglewood Police Sgt. Harold Moret said. 
</P>
<P>
"The body had no obvious signs of trauma. But we are treating it as a homicide 
for several reasons," Moret said. Those reasons include the "suspicious" 
location of the body and indications that the youngster's wrists had been 
bound. Police said, however, there were no immediate clues as to how the boy 
died. 
</P>
<P>
Moret said the boy was last seen by two friends around 3 p.m. as he walked home 
from Kew Elementary School, where he was a student in the fourth grade. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the boy had no pulse when paramedics arrived at the apartment 
building. He was transported to Robert Kennedy Hospital and pronounced dead on 
arrival.

WINNIE MANDELA'S GUARD CONVICTED OF KILLING TEEN

<P>
A judge today convicted Winnie Mandela's former bodyguard of killing a black 
teen-age activist and said Mandela was at home when the kidnaped boy was 
brought there and beaten. 
</P>
<P>
Supreme Court Justice Brian O'Donovan convicted Jerry Richardson of murdering 
14-year-old James Stompie Seipei Moeketski on Jan. 1, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
He also was convicted of kidnaping, attempted murder and assault in cases 
involving three other men who were abducted and beaten at her home in Soweto 
township, according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Winnie Mandela, wife of black nationalist leader Nelson R. Mandela and a 
prominent anti-apartheid activist herself, was not charged in the case, even 
though witnesses testified that she participated in the beatings. She has said 
she was not at her house when any assaults took place. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson once was Winnie Mandela's chief bodyguard and the coach of the 
Mandela United soccer team, whose members also served as guards. 
</P>
<P>
His sentencing was postponed until Aug. 6 while he undergoes psychiatric 
examinations. If no extenuating circumstances are found, the death penalty is 
mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
However, President Frederik W. de Klerk suspended executions in February as 
part of his efforts to encourage negotiations between the white minority 
government and black organizations such as the African National Congress. 
Nelson Mandela is deputy president of the ANC. 
</P>
<P>
Three men testified during the 23-day trial that Richardson and other 
bodyguards kidnaped them and Stompie from a Methodist Church house in Soweto on 
Dec. 29, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
They said that they were taken to Winnie Mandela's home and that she beat them 
and Stompie with her fists and a whip, then allowed her bodyguards to continue 
assaulting them. 
</P>
<P>
Eight other former bodyguards face trial on lesser charges. Winnie Mandela did 
not testify at Richardson's trial, although his attorney asked her to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson Mandela said Wednesday that the government was trying to ruin his wife's 
reputation by deliberately not charging her in a "case which centers on her." 
However, he said he was not calling on the government to prosecute his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Winnie Mandela has made no public statement on the case since last year when 
leaders of major anti-apartheid organizations accused her of complicity in the 
abductions and assaults and called on the Soweto community to ostracize her. 
</P>
<P>
A few months later she reappeared on the stage at anti-apartheid rallies, 
however, and she has accompanied her husband at most public engagements since 
he was freed Feb. 11 after serving 27 years in prison.

GAO'S REPORT TO SENATE FAILS TO BACK IOWA BLAST THEORY;

<P>
TESTS FAIL TO BACK FINDING OF SABOTAGE IN FATAL IOWA BLAST

<P>
Congressional investigators said today that their tests did not support the 
Navy's finding that sabotage caused the explosion that killed 47 sailors aboard 
the battleship Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
The congressional report, which came a day after the Navy reopened its 
investigation into the disaster, said the explosion could have resulted from 
gunpowder bags in the ship's guns being rammed at "higher than normal speeds." 
</P>
<P>
The report was presented to the Senate Armed Services Committee by the General 
Accounting Office, which investigated the Navy's controversial finding that 
gunner's mate Clayton Hartwig probably sabotaged the battleship in the April 
19, 1989, explosion. 
</P>
<P>
Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) said today's testimony by 
the GAO report "cast grave doubts on the Navy's findings" that foreign material 
had been found in the gun barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, responding to the GAO report, said he would 
"reserve judgment" until further investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"They did the best job they could. Now there's new evidence, new information 
that warrants reopening the investigation," Cheney said. "But I think at this 
point I'd want to keep my powder dry, so to speak, until we have a better sense 
of exactly what this new information may contribute." 
</P>
<P>
Hartwig's sister, Kathy Kubicina, who attended the hearing, told reporters: "My 
brother was only a victim . . . I hope after today this will get rid of any 
doubt in anyone's mind." 
</P>
<P>
Retired Adm. Fred Moosally, the Iowa's skipper at the time of the explosion and 
an outspoken critic of the investigation, sat in the front row during the 
hearing. But he declined to comment, saying, "I'm only here to listen." 
</P>
<P>
The Navy said it would have no immediate comment. But on Thursday, it ordered a 
halt to any firing of 16-inch guns aboard the service's four battleships after 
an "unexplained" ignition of some gunpowder bags during testing. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn said the GAO finding "will essentially eviscerate the Navy's conclusion" 
that the explosion aboard the Iowa was the result of a wrongful, intentional 
act. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO said tests at the Sandia National Laboratory "could not corroborate the 
Navy's technical finding that an improvised chemical device initiated the 
explosion." 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, the Navy said Hartwig, who was killed in the explosion, "most 
probably" had placed "some type of detonation device" between gunpowder bags 
when he supervised the loading of the warship's guns.

The GAO analysis made no mention specifically of Hartwig in its report.

An Air Force fighter jet crashed into a residential area today, setting two 
homes ablaze and killing the pilot and a housekeeper, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The F-16A was on a training flight from Moody Air Force Base near Valdosta to 
Lake George Weapons Range in Florida when it crashed in southern Georgia, Moody 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot was the only one aboard, public affairs officer Dee Tait said. Names 
of the dead were not immediately released. 
</P>
<P>
Parts of the plane hit Mary Alice Corbitt's home. Corbitt "was in the middle 
bedroom and heard a loud noise, a boom. The debris hit the house and debris 
came in. There was fire inside the house," said her daughter-in-law, who said 
Corbitt was too upset to speak on the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very loud -- almost like a sonic boom," said David McDonald, assistant 
principal at Atkinson County High School, about half a mile from the site. "It 
shook real hard."

The Drug Enforcement Administration paid $20,000 to the people who brought a 
Mexican doctor to U.S. soil to face charges in the murder of an American drug 
agent, the DEA said today. 
</P>
<P>
"We did make a payment of services of $20,000," DEA spokesman Frank Shults 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The money, he said, was not a reward or a bounty for the delivery of Dr. 
Humberto Alvarez Machain. 
</P>
<P>
Shults would not specify the services rendered for the $20,000. However, he 
said, it could have covered such things as the rental of the plane that flew 
the Guadalajara gynecologist to El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez was arrested April 3 to face charges in the 1985 kidnaping, torture and 
murder of DEA Agent Enrique (Kiki) Camarena. The alleged kidnaping of Alvarez 
has strained relations between the United States and Mexico.

Campbell Soup Co. said today it plans to sell several of its European food 
units in an effort to focus on its more profitable businesses. 
</P>
<P>
On the auction block are D. Lazzaroni &amp; C. SpA of Italy; Campbell Seafoods 
Division, which operates in the United Kingdom and Belgium; the vegetable 
division of Campbell Foods PLC in England; and Campbell Irish Foods Ltd. and 
Mallow Foods Ltd., both of Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
The latter three companies were acquired when Campbell took over Freshbake 
Foods Group PLC of Britain in 1988. Total sales of all the businesses to be 
sold exceed $200 million, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said it expects the sale to result in a $55-million charge against 
fourth-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell has faced increasing problems over the last year and has been 
frequently rumored as a takeover target because of its sluggish performance and 
depressed stock price. Some members of the founding family have urged a sale of 
the entire company.

Stock prices fell sharply today, retreating from the record highs they reached 
earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 34.63 to 2,820.92, cutting its 
gain for the week to 1.01 points. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 4 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 534 up, 944 down and 503 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 120.25 million shares, down from 155.14 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index lost 1.76 to 193.71. 
</P>
<P>
Technology issues suffered some of the day's biggest losses. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the tone for the session was set overnight by word from Adobe 
Systems, a computer software company, that its earnings for the second quarter 
and full fiscal year were likely to fall short of analysts' estimates. 
</P>
<P>
After struggling through an extended rocky spell in the past few years, 
technology stocks have experienced a revival in the recent rally that has 
carried the market to new highs. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers said the latest word from Adobe came as a fresh setback to fans of a 
market group that often is particularly vulnerable to earnings disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
The bond market continued to lose ground today in the wake of unusually weak 
bidding in Thursday's auction for new five-year Treasury notes. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, which lost 7/16 point on Thursday, was 
down another 7/16 point, or about $4 for every $1,000 face amount, in light 
trading. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, rose to 8.65% from 8.61% late 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Liz Capo, a futures analyst with Stone and McCarthy Associates of Princeton, 
N.J., said the market was still reacting to the results of Thursday's auction, 
at which the government sold $8.5 billion in notes for an average 8.54%, up 
slightly from the last auction in late February. 
</P>
<P>
Market watchers said only about $2.60 in bids came in for every $1 in notes 
sold; five-year note auctions usually attract $3 in bids for every $1 sold. 
</P>
<P>
Capo said the market also showed concern that the U.S. dollar continued to fall 
against the Japanese yen in European trading this morning. Dealers attributed 
the fall to remarks by assistant Treasury Secretary Sidney Jones that the 
dollar was undervalued against all currencies but the yen. 
</P>
<P>
The market was less affected by today's government report that consumer 
spending increased by 0.6%, the largest increase since it rose 1.2% in January. 
Consumer spending is considered a barometer of economic health since it 
accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
The April increase was rosier than analysts expected, but Capo said trading in 
general was extremely slow because of the Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very quiet. There's not a lot going on because of the long weekend," she 
said. "The combination of the weaker dollar and the poor results of yesterday's 
five-year auction just brought the market in with a weaker tone." 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
fell 3/32 point, intermediate maturities fell 1/8 point to 3/8 point, and 
long-term issues were down as much as 7/16 point, according to Telerate Inc., a 
financial information service.

The U.S. trade deficit fell to $26.4 billion from January through March, the 
lowest quarterly imbalance in more than six years, the government reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said the 8.2% improvement from a $28.7-billion 
fourth-quarter deficit resulted from a record level of U.S. sales abroad 
offsetting the highest volume of oil imports in more than 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
For the first quarter, U.S. exports rose 4.7% to an all-time high of $96.04 
billion. Imports also were at a record level, based on a surge in oil demand, 
climbing 1.6% to $122.4 billion. The trade deficit is the difference between 
imports and exports. 
</P>
<P>
Today's report on merchandise trade as calculated on a balance-of-payments 
basis confirmed trends already noted in the department's monthly merchandise 
trade reports. They showed a first-quarter deficit of $23.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The disparity in the two figures comes from the fact that today's report 
excludes military sales by the U.S. government and makes other minor 
adjustments to the monthly figures. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts were generally heartened by the new figures despite the surge in oil 
imports. They noted that U.S. export sales remain at strong levels. Since 
growth in exports has fueled a large portion of U.S. economic growth over the 
last three years, the continuation of this trend is seen as a promising sign 
for the future. 
</P>
<P>
The first-quarter deficit was the smallest since a $21.7-billion shortfall in 
the fourth quarter of 1983.

<P>
Personal income edged up 0.3% in April, the lowest rate in seven months and 
only half of the 0.6% increase in consumer spending, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
The result was a drop in Americans' savings rate -- savings as a percentage of 
disposable income -- from 5.8% in March to 5.5% in April. 
</P>
<P>
The rate had been 5.5% in February, up from 5.3% in January. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported that incomes totaled a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of $4.69 trillion following 8% gains during the three previous 
months. It was the lowest rate since it dropped to 0.2% last September. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3.68 trillion 
after 0.5% increases in both February and March. It was the largest gain since 
it jumped 1.2% in January.

CHINA PREMIER SAYS TRADE STATUS WILL IMPROVE TIES

<P>
Premier Li Peng today welcomed President Bush's decision to renew China's most 
favored nation trade status, saying it will help U.S-Chinese ties. 
</P>
<P>
At least two other Asian governments -- Hong Kong and Japan -- also praised the 
move, saying friendly ties are important despite Beijing's crackdown on 
pro-democracy demonstrators a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Bush announced Thursday that he favors renewing the trade status for one year, 
entitling China to the lowest available tariffs on its exports. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not only in the interests of China but in the interests of the United 
States, too," the official New China News Agency quoted Li as telling visiting 
Japanese businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said Li "noted that his government will, as always, make due efforts 
to restore and promote Sino-U.S. relations." 
</P>
<P>
The news agency, in its report on Bush's decision, claimed that only a small 
number of Americans supported ending the favored trade status "under the 
pretext of so-called human rights." 
</P>
<P>
Other official Chinese media argued before Bush's announcement that American 
consumers, rather than Chinese manufacturers, would be hurt most by canceling 
the favored status. 
</P>
<P>
China Daily said without cheap Chinese canvas shoes, "some Americans would be 
unable to afford similar shoes manufactured in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, China exported about $12 billion worth of goods to the United 
States, mostly garments and toys. The United States sold China about $5.7 
billion worth of goods, led by wheat, fertilizer and aviation equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Trade and Industry Secretary John Chan today said Bush's move was 
"very good news from Hong Kong's point of view." 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Chan noted the British colony's business community and 
government had engaged in intensive lobbying during the last few weeks to 
explain how termination of special trade status would harm Hong Kong, which 
will return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.

TRIO CONVICTED OF HELPING CUBA MAKE FAKE WINSTONS

If these Winstons didn't taste good like a cigarette should, it could be 
because they were counterfeited in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
Three men, including a former R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. engineer, were 
convicted Wednesday of violating export laws and the U.S. trade embargo against 
Cuba by shipping equipment to the island to make imitation Winstons. 
</P>
<P>
They exported a carton-stuffing machine, cigarette-wrapping equipment, red and 
gold ink and other items through Panama to Cuba, where the fake Winstons were 
manufactured for export, according to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be a big embarrassment for Cuba," said Keith Prager, who supervises 
the investigating U.S. Customs unit. "This case . . . shows how desperate the 
Cuban government is, that they are down to counterfeiting cigarettes." 
</P>
<P>
Customs officials heard about the scheme after a tip on some equipment 
shipments in March, 1989, and the discovery of 1,800 cases of Cuban-made 
Winstons in the Netherlands in August. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors claimed that sales of the American cigarettes could have made $2 
million for Cuba's foreign exchange-starved economy. It wasn't clear whether 
any of the cigarettes were eventually sold. 
</P>
<P>
Convicted after a nine-day trial were former R. J. Reynolds engineering foreman 
Michael Macko; Emilio Ortiz De Zevallos, the Peruvian director of a Panamanian 
export company, and Frank Van Ameringen, who ran several small tobacco 
companies from his home in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
They face prison terms of 15 to 21 months. U.S. District Judge Lenore Nesbitt 
set sentencing for July 23.

'IN LIVING COLOR' BUZZES LIKE 'SNL' OF EARLY DAYS 
</P>

By MICHAEL HILL, THE BALTIMORE EVENING SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In just a month, Fox's "In Living Color" has become the hottest, hippest comedy 
show on television. It's got the same sort of buzz that accompanied the early 
"Saturday Night Live," the same sort of feeling that these are people you 
haven't been allowed to see on TV before. 
</P>
<P>
That's not a mistaken feeling. When "Saturday Night Live" made its debut in 
1975, it was really the first time baby boomers with '60s sensibilities had 
been allowed to put out their own TV show, totally unfiltered by the older 
generation. The word quickly spread among its generation -- "Hey, we've got our 
own show." 
</P>
<P>
A similar word is spreading about "In Living Color" as it marks the first time 
that prime time has been turned over to hip black comedy, totally unfiltered by 
white studio executives. 
</P>
<P>
"In Living Color" is a half-hour comedy sketch show that comes from Keenen 
Ivory Wayans, who worked with Robert Townsend on the film "Hollywood Shuffle" 
before turning out his own movie, "I'm Gonna Get You Sucka," a hilarious 
send-up of the blacksploitation films of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Fox basically gave Wayans carte blanche. He put together a multiracial cast 
that includes his brother Damon, his sister Kim and a variety of up-and-coming 
talent. Running on Saturday nights, it has attracted just the kind of young 
audience Fox loves, finishing second in its time period to NBC's hit "The 
Golden Girls. It single-handedly killed the attempted comeback of "The Famous 
Teddy Z" on CBS in that time slot. This weekend, "In Living Color" moves to 
Sunday night, giving Fox a solid 90 minutes of comedy starting with "The 
Simpsons" and followed by "Married . . . With Children." 
</P>
<P>
Like all good parody, "In Living Color" isn't afraid to risk offending its 
audience, whether it's with the the show's version of Siskel and Ebert in which 
two gay black critics give films "two snaps up" or with the Home Boys Shopping 
Network, with two characters who have appeared twice, once selling stolen goods 
out of the back of a truck, inviting you to call in your orders on a nearby pay 
phone, the other time hawking cars in the parking lot of Dodger Stadium.

WOMAN PLEADS INNOCENT ON GLESS' ENTRY

<P>
A woman described as an obsessed fan of actress Sharon Gless has pleaded 
innocent to charges she barricaded herself in the actress's home with a loaded 
rifle, court officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, Joni Leigh Penn, 30, of Garden Grove, allegedly broke into Gless' 
home last March and planned to sexually assault the actress, then commit 
suicide, prosecutors have said. 
</P>
<P>
Penn, appearing in Superior Court Thursday for arraignment, pleaded not guilty 
to two felony counts of residential burglary. She was ordered by Superior Court 
Judge John Major to remain in custody without bail and to return to court June 
7 for a pretrial hearing. A July 12 trial was also scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted of the charges, Penn could be sentenced to up to six years in 
state prison. Penn had been scheduled to be arraigned today, but her case was 
moved up a day because court officials mistakenly believed that Judge Major's 
courtroom would not be open today. 
</P>
<P>
The District Attorney's Office said that Penn, armed with a loaded rifle, broke 
into Gless' Studio City home March 30, threatened suicide and barricaded 
herself in a bathroom for nearly seven hours before surrendering to police. 
</P>
<P>
Penn, who was purportedly in love with Gless, also allegedly broke into the 
home on March 27.

<P>
A street that runs beside Mickey Spillane's old elementary school now bears the 
author's name. 
</P>
<P>
One of Spillane's grade school teachers showed up for the dedication ceremony 
attended by the writer Thursday, along with dozens of young students from the 
Theodore Roosevelt Elementary and Middle schools. 
</P>
<P>
"At least it's paved," the 72-year-old Spillane said of Mickey Spillane Way, 
which runs by the schools. "If it wasn't paved, I wouldn't go." 
</P>
<P>
Spillane, who has written more than 40 detective novels featuring the 
hard-boiled private eye Mike Hammer, said he attended grades three through six 
at Roosevelt Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
The writer's family moved to Elizabeth in 1918, when he was a month old. He 
lived here until his senior year of high school, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Spillane has been living in Murrell's Inlet, S.C., where he's finishing a novel 
and rebuilding his home. The novel was lost and the house destroyed last fall 
in Hurricane Hugo.

A key figure in a $150-million real estate scam whose victims included Eddie 
Murphy and actress Kirstie Alley has been sentenced to 16 to 48 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Rosen of University Heights, Ohio, was sentenced on 37 counts, including 
grand larceny and securities fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said he was the comptroller in deals set up by tax-shelter hustler 
John Peter Galanis, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Dist. Atty. Robert Morgenthau said Rosen made about $1 million from a variety 
of schemes, including one involving the sale of limited partnerships in hotels 
and store space in Atlantic City, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Boomer Esiason, and Alley of the TV 
series "Cheers," were among 1,300 people drawn into the Atlantic City scheme in 
1985, Morgenthau said. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for the district attorney, said Esiason lost 
$79,800, Alley lost $93,500 and Murphy lost $240,375. 
</P>
<P>
Rosen, 64, is free on bond pending appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Galanis, from San Diego, earlier pleaded guilty and is serving a sentence of 
seven to 21 years in prison, along with a 27-year sentence from another case.

People glanced at them, not because of their celebrity but because of their 
faces, which marked them as fighters, to some objects of curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Frank Szuzina nor Tom O'Shea made a mark on boxing as Rocky Graziano 
did, nor have they achieved the level of recognition reached by the former 
middleweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
The Rock, however, left his mark on them, and the two old pros came to St. 
Patrick's Cathedral today to say farewell to Graziano, who died Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"He was my idol," said Szuzina, who fought about 80 times in the 1950s and who 
was good enough to once beat Joey Giardello, who went on to win the 
middleweight title. 
</P>
<P>
Graziano was much more, however, than a hero to Szuzina. 
</P>
<P>
"He lived in my neighborhood," Szuzina said. "I knew him as a friend." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had ever seen Graziano fight, O'Shea, who said he fought as a 
bantamweight in the early 1950s, replied, "I'm not here to talk about who he 
fought. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here because I loved the guy." 
</P>
<P>
Both Szuzina and O'Shea attracted men with microphones and cameras as they 
stood on the street waiting for the funeral Mass to begin. The faces attracted, 
but the names drew blank stares. 
</P>
<P>
Jake LaMotta, the Bronx Bull when he was the middleweight champion, the Raging 
Bull as movie-made folk hero, was there, but the turnout was anything but a 
celebrity crowd. 
</P>
<P>
There were a goodly number of squashed noses and suits too tight and a little 
threadbare. One man wore pants with a pattern of stains and carried a gym bag 
that had a beer logo on it.

Surprise. Brent Musburger agrees with the critics who wish he'd shut up once in 
a while. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm watching tapes of a game I did, there are many times when I get tired 
of the sound of my own voice," Musburger says in an interview in the June 1 
issue of Entertainment Weekly. 
</P>
<P>
"I turn the sound off or just shut the damn thing off and walk away." 
</P>
<P>
Musburger, for years the sports anchor at CBS, was fired by the network the day 
before he announced the NCAA college basketball final, his final event at CBS. 
He signed a month later with ABC. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care what you put me on," he says in the interview. "I've done more 
schlock sports than anybody. I've done the Human Fly, a guy walking on 
airplanes." 
</P>
<P>
Musburger also acknowledges that he may over-hype events that he covers. "If 
I'm not going to be enthusiastic about it, who's going to be?" he asks. "It 
would be virtually impossible for someone who shares the responsibility for 
making an event a success to be a pure journalist."

Defensive tackle Steve McMichael, an 11-year veteran who played in every game

he wants to renegotiate his agreement.

Coach Mike Ditka said Thursday that McMichael is making a mistake by staying 
home.

McMichael and linebacker Mike Singletary were the only two team members to play 
in every game last season. McMichael is seeking an increase in his base salary 
from $500,000 to $800,000.

Ditka said McMichael is not accomplishing anything by staying away. He would 
not say if he will fine McMichael for not showing up.

Town Policy Handicap winner Movin North and Los Alamitos Derby runner-up 
Merriette share high weight heading a field of sophomore fillies in tonight's 
Lassie Handicap at Los Alamitos Race Course. 
</P>
<P>
The 400-yard Lassie offers a $25,000 added purse. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how they'll line up for the Lassie Handicap with jockey and weight 
assignments: To Toast (James Lackey, 120); Merriette (Bruce Pilkenton, 123); 
Come Azure Are (Kip Didericksen, 122); So Cal Gal (Steve Treasure, 121); 
Smashed Jewel (John Creager, 121); Lucks Fiesta Miss (Lute Proctor, 120); 
Telesis Too (Roman Figueroa, 120); Movin North (Danny Cardoza, 123); The 
Jetaway Caper (Ralph Seville, 118), and Coda Lark (James Brooks, 118). 
</P>
<P>
Movin North, the daughter of Easy Dozen is two-for-two this year, including a 
major upset in a division of the Town Policy Handicap on April 20 at Los 
Alamitos. Racing at 15-1 odds in the Town Policy, Movin North was never headed 
while posting a neck win over Dadburn Swift under the guidance of veteran rider 
Danny Cardoza. 
</P>
<P>
Merriette has won four of six starts and finished second in her remaining two 
outings. The most impressive performance came on May 12, when Bruce Pilkenton 
missed the winner's share by a nose in the $111,000 Los Alamitos Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, Merriette captured the Redwood City and Debutante Handicaps at Bay 
Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
Come Azure Are has the talent to upset either of the two top weights. The Azure 
Request daughter ran out more than $12,000 last year, finishing a neck behind 
So Cal Gal in the La Jolla Handicap last year at Los Al. 
</P>
<P>
After opening her sophomore campaign with a third in allowance company, trainer 
Bob Baffert saddled the Oklahoma-bred miss to the second-fastest qualifying 
time for the Los Alamitos Derby. She finished third in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, Apprehend and Ourautograph will carry high weights of 123 
pounds in the $25,000 Laddie Handicap at Los Alamitos.

PAPA JOHN CREACH CONTINUES A CAREER THAT'S RANGED FROM ARMSTRONG TO THE 
AIRPLANE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The days when the Jefferson Airplane vaulted its chaotic psychedelia into 
pot-filled, amoeba-light-showed halls might seem like ancient history now. But 
for Papa John Creach, who played with the Airplane and its spinoff groups for 
five years, music goes back a little further than that. 
</P>
<P>
"I can remember the time when guys would sing through a megaphone," states the 
multifaceted violinist, who turns 73 on Monday. A professional musician since 
his teens, the Pennsylvania-born Creach has included stints playing classical, 
jazz, be-bop, R&amp;B, pop and acid rock. Given his current busy schedule -- 
which includes shows tonight with bluesman Bernie Pearl at Cafe Lido -- Creach 
will likely outlast several more musical styles. 
</P>
<P>
Reached by phone this week at his Los Angeles home, he said: "I've just kept on 
going. I think I'll always keep on playing because it's therapy for me. To make 
me feel good, I pick up my violin and play it. It makes me enjoy life as much 
as I can. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me so happy, really, to see all those faces and a full house, and 
everybody wanting to shake your hand and tell you, 'I saw you when. . . .' Some 
of that can be interesting, because they'll tell me about engagements I forgot 
I played." 
</P>
<P>
It's forgivable if Creach has forgotten about a few of his gigs, since he's had 
over half a century of them. As a child he was introduced to the violin by an 
uncle. Subsequent tutoring and conservatory studies gave him classical 
training, which led to symphonic work in Chicago in his early 20s. "We were 
playing some pretty heavy stuff," he said, "but then I started in jazz because 
there was no money in the symphony stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Creach said the fact that he is black also once posed a problem in symphonic 
circles. 
</P>
<P>
"They closed the door on you. You really had to try. Who'd ever heard of a 
black man playing symphonic violin? That's what they'd say. But I never paid 
them any attention. I just kept on sawing on the thing. And I got pretty good 
at it. The more I kept on playing, the more people forgot about it being a 
black man playing the violin." 
</P>
<P>
Fluency in a number of styles was an economic necessity in Chicago he said, 
"because of all the nationalities, I had to learn to play everything. At some 
jobs it was strictly German music, or Polish. Now, they used to dance and knock 
holes in the floor." 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't so immediately adept at learning jazz. "A violin (player) coming out 
of a symphony orchestra sounds like the corniest thing in the world when you 
start playing jazz. Then I started trying to play like the horn players I was 
running around with. I had to change my bowing technique and other things to 
make it sound more like a horn. I've been doing that ever since." 
</P>
<P>
There weren't many jazz violinists for Creach to be influenced by, though he 
wasn't alone on the instrument. "I used to jam all the time with my buddy Stuff 
Smith, and I played with Eddie South, who they called the Black Angel of the 
Violin. I listened to Joe Venuti and Stephane Grappelli, but I was playing 
fiddle real good by the time I heard them." A limiting factor on the jobs 
available to jazz violinists was the modest volume the instrument produces, a 
problem Creach addressed in the early '40s. 
</P>
<P>
"The violin was a hard instrument to get into a big band, until in 1943 I got a 
National electrified violin and amp. The pickup on the violin was like a 
telephone receiver pickup under the bridge. It was a great instrument for that 
time and era because it had a nice mellow tone, and it was loud. You sure 
couldn't drown it out." 
</P>
<P>
Though Creach did have occasion to play with legends such as Louis Armstrong, 
Fats Waller and electric guitar pioneer Charlie Christian, he remained on the 
periphery of the volatile jazz scene, opting instead for steady work with a 
trio dubbed the Chocolate Music Bars. 
</P>
<P>
"I found work playing cocktail lounges for a hotel chain, so I didn't fit in 
too well to the club scene. There were like 17 hotels in the chain, and they 
sent me to all of them. I knew where I was going for six years. So I didn't 
have to go through all this other stuff of looking for a gig tonight and 
tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
In 1945, Creach moved to California and formed his own trio. He continued 
working steady gigs, including a five-year stint on the Catalina steamer in an 
outfit called the Shipmates. But he also branched into R&amp;B, working with 
Roy Milton, Big Joe Turner, T-Bone Walker and others. He appeared with Nat King 
Cole in the Fritz Lang film "Blue Gardenia." (More recently Creach and his 
music were featured in the CBS TV movie "A Gathering of Old Men.") 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, some members of the Airplane saw him playing at the Parisian Room in 
Los Angeles. They were sufficiently impressed to soon ask him up to San 
Francisco to play a show with them. That show, it turned out, was a wake at the 
Winterland for Janis Joplin, and Creach found himself sharing the stage with 
Jerry Garcia, Santana and others. He gave his two-weeks' notice to the Parisian 
Room and spent the next five years playing for thousands of fans a night (there 
were 100,000 for one Central Park show) with the Airplane, Jefferson Starship 
and Hot Tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the volume of the Airplane -- which required Creach to get a larger 
amp and some earplugs -- Creach said he had no problem adjusting to their 
music. "I just listened to their albums and then knew exactly what style to 
play in. It was the same with a woman singer I just recorded with in Japan. You 
just go with the music." 
</P>
<P>
The Airplane's lifestyle, including a predilection for altered consciousness, 
also didn't faze Creach. "They were called acid freaks and all that. But I knew 
drugs way back before them, and they weren't doing it heavy like kids are now. 
But back in the early jazz days, all the heavy dudes was doing it, Louis 
(Armstrong) and all that bunch. They used to smoke it back when they called it 
hemp. I never did like it. I couldn't get nothing out of it. I'd just go get me 
a bottle of bourbon or something, and get more kicks out of that." 
</P>
<P>
When he departed the fold in 1975, "I slowed down considerably because they'd 
had a rock 'n' roll agent, and he just kept you busy. It was all, 'Drive 250 
miles, then play a gig.' " 
</P>
<P>
Managed since then by Gretchen Creach, his wife of 27 years, he still has no 
shortage of work. He just returned from a recording project in Japan, is being 
sought to repeat a European tour he made last year, and has been approached to 
tour Asia and Australia later this year. In June he embarks on a West Coast 
tour with the Dinosaurs, a group composed of San Francisco-scene veterans. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the legendary-ness of me or something, everybody wants to see if 
I'm still walking around, I guess," Creach said with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
 Papa John Creach, the Bernie Pearl Blues Band and Harmonica Fats play tonight 
at 9 at Cafe Lido, 501 30th St., Newport Beach, (714) 675-2968.

NO FEAR HE MAY OFFEND; 
</P>
<P>
LITERARY BAD BOY HANIF KUREISHI KNOWS THAT THE RACIAL AND SEXUAL THEMES IN HIS 
WORKS WILL SCANDALIZE MANY. BUT THOSE ELEMENTS, HE SAYS, REFLECT THE REALITIES 
OF A DIVERSE, CHANGING WORLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By IRENE LACHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's hard to believe that the slight, soft-spoken guy in jeans and long dark 
curls is the angry young man lionized as a literary terrorist by the British 
press. Sure, Hanif Kureishi's "My Beautiful Laundrette," a razor-edged take on 
race, class and sexuality in London, was as scrappy as it was fresh. Even in 
the States, Muslim pickets hounded the New York showing of "Laundrette," 
accusing the half-Pakistani screenwriter and author of betraying his own kind. 
</P>
<P>
Kureishi made tart headlines yet again with the raw, nose-thumbing title of his 
second satirical film, 1987's "Sammy and Rosie Get Laid." Not only did it make 
the Motion Picture Assn. of America testy, but it inspired some of the 
country's established newspapers to remove any hint of salaciousness from their 
ads, opting for the positively dignified "Sammy and Rosie." 
</P>
<P>
Still, if Kureishi is an agent provocateur of letters, then they make 
terrorists a little gentler in England. Here, the English subversive comes off 
as virtually restrained. Kureishi is now negotiating on the phone with room 
service at the Chateau Marmont, which he is passing through to promote his 
acclaimed first novel, "The Buddha of Suburbia." His voice is barely more than 
whisper-soft. He is trying to cross the vast cultural divide between England 
and California, so that he can achieve the greater good of eating lunch. This 
means he must get room service to understand that herbal tea simply will not do 
for an Englishman. 
</P>
<P>
"I want Earl Grey," he murmurs. "Earl Grey." Pause. "You don't have ordinary 
tea?" 
</P>
<P>
Some extraordinary beverage arrives, along with spare slices of Brie, Cheddar 
and tomato, which he nibbles idly with a knife. He seems like a character from 
his rollicking novel in that his identity is very much in the eye of the 
beholder. In "Buddha," one man's guru -- namely, the title character, who 
offers suburbanites pithy nuggets of Eastern wisdom -- is another man's 
adulterous, lowly clerk. 
</P>
<P>
Kureishi's own identity seems equally elusive. If, for example, his fondness 
for explicitly rendering bisexual experimenting in his book and films has 
ruffled the British press, which insists on tarring him as provocative, then 
Kureishi offers a considered, level-headed explanation for all those scenes of 
sexual profligacy. 
</P>
<P>
"If that shocks you, then it shocks you," says Kureishi, 35, who has made no 
secret of his own bisexuality. "I try to reflect the world as I see it. The 
world contains lesbian people, black people, gay people and straight people and 
they do all kinds of dirty stuff together that sometimes you put in a movie." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps even trickier, but central to Kureishi's work, is the question of 
cultural identity. 
</P>
<P>
"My name is Karim Amir, and I am an Englishman born and bred, almost," his 
novel begins, marking the half-Indian protagonist's treacherous, eccentric 
journey from the lackluster suburbs to the sophisticated city. Time is marked 
as bell bottoms give way to the dissonance of punk culture. "The Buddha," like 
Kureishi's films, is heavily autobiographical, which has sometimes nettled the 
author's family. Kureishi's father inspired the adulterous Buddha character but 
only because his suburban neighbors were known to seek out his counsel. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone's writing is drawn on their personal experience in some ways, 
although most of the incidents that happen in 'Buddha of Suburbia' didn't 
happen to me directly. My dad is really nervous in case the neighbors think he 
was (expletive) away in Beckenham having a really good time and stuff, when in 
fact he was at home watching 'I Love Lucy' like everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
Kureishi was born to a Pakistani father and English mother. His father came 
from a well-to-do Bombay family that later moved to Muslim Pakistan. The family 
sent its sons abroad for their education. (Kureishi traces his friendship with 
embattled author Salman Rushdie to their families' alliance in Bombay.) 
</P>
<P>
Kureishi's father went to England in the late '40s to study law at London 
University. The law held no great fascination for him, but Kureishi's mother, a 
young lower-middle-class suburban woman, did. Kureishi's father was considered 
quite an exotic catch in those days, before mass immigration from the former 
colonies triggered waves of racist violence. 
</P>
<P>
The couple settled in suburban Bromley, a mere 10 miles from London, but 
culturally much more distant. "We always considered the river to be the crucial 
divide," Kureishi says. "We always used to talk about going to London." 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-'60s, when Kureishi was attending his local boys' school, racial 
tensions had erupted in England. For the rebellious Kureishi, education 
sometimes came in unpleasant packages. 
</P>
<P>
"You were always getting kicked around, but then you were getting kicked around 
anyway," he says. "People would abuse you and say, '(Expletive) off Paki.' 
</P>
<P>
"There was one teacher who only referred to me as Pakistani Pete. So I used to 
call him by his nickname, which was 'Jock' because he was Scottish. That's like 
saying someone's a Limey, I suppose. It's not terrible. He went mad. He had me 
slippered -- they beat you with a tennis shoe. Stuff like that was pretty 
disturbing." 
</P>
<P>
Kureishi's youth also included troubling brushes with racist parents of his 
English girlfriends, whom he lampoons in "Buddha." Karim is barred from a 
girlfriend's home by her beefy English dad, who is immortalized with the 
sobriquet Hairy Back. Beating a retreat, Karim has an unfortunate encounter 
with a lusty dog -- which may or may not have been drawn from real life. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying," Kureishi says with a mysterious smile. 
</P>
<P>
As a youth, Kureishi channeled his fury into his writing. From the age of 14, 
he led an untypically disciplined life, napping on his return from school, then 
writing fiction after tea, at 7ish, until bedtime at 10. At that tender age, 
Kureishi knew no shame, seeking and obtaining audiences with patronizing 
publishers who were surprised to find a schoolboy in uniform on the other side 
of Kureishi's promising manuscripts. He wrote three novels in his teens. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was the only way out," Kureishi says. "If I didn't become a writer, 
I would have stayed in the suburbs like my friends. They worked in insurance, 
customs and excise, banks. They were managers of shops. Boring stuff, really. 
Some of the others became rock 'n' roll stars, which was the other thing we 
were interested in." 
</P>
<P>
In the book, Karim's growing maturity is measured partly by his relationship 
with his stepbrother, punk rocker Charlie Hero (modeled after Kureishi's 
schoolmate Billy Idol). As time wears on, Karim, once infatuated with Charlie's 
fame and thorny style, becomes disaffected with the shallowness of the rocker's 
hedonistic existence. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, rock 'n' roll had a more positive influence on Kureishi's 
development. In the English suburbs, it was the rockers who broke out and made 
their impressive way in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"The Beatles, Lennon and McCartney, Jagger and Richards, they were all suburban 
boys. They were not hard city kids. They were lower-middle-class like me. They 
sat in their bedroom like me listening to Chuck Berry records and Elvis 
records. 
</P>
<P>
"They were examples for our generation -- not to say we were talented like 
them. But Jagger came from Dartford, which was near me, and David Bowie went to 
the same school I went to. They weren't literary models, but they were boys 
like us who got out of the suburbs, made money and practiced their art as they 
wished." Kureishi wasn't a chain-sporting rocker himself, preferring to run 
with the hippie crowd in those days of '60s choices, which also included swats 
-- eggheads -- and skinheads. Kureishi sometimes found himself in the curious 
position of having friends who turned into skinheads, whose favorite pastimes 
included "Paki-bashing." 
</P>
<P>
"I was very disturbed by it," Kureishi says. "When you're young and you're in a 
male school and it's a very macho place, there really isn't a vocabulary for 
discussing these things. You can't -- these guys were walking around with 
knives." 
</P>
<P>
Kureishi later did manage to put words to those experiences. The ambiguity in 
his friendships with skinheads is played out in "Laundrette," whose Pakistani 
protagonist finds comfort in a sexual relationship with Daniel Day-Lewis's 
skinhead character. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Kureishi began attending King's College in London, he'd turned from 
solitary novel-writing to the more glamorous alternative theater. "It was young 
people, radical. It was live entertainment. You met actresses. You got out and 
about. The novel was associated in my mind with stuffy people in Bloomsbury. 
The theater was Sam Shepard and Peter Brook and all that stuff. More like rock 
'n' roll. More active." 
</P>
<P>
Kureishi got a job as an usher at The Royal Court, London's main radical 
theater in the mid '70s, and began writing plays about "the same stuff that 
'Buddha of Suburbia' is about -- young people, music, drugs, sexual 
experimenting, being in the suburbs, except all the characters were white. It 
never occurred to me to write about Asian people, really. I'd done it once or 
twice but I never thought that this was a subject. There were no half-Indian 
boys in literature." 
</P>
<P>
Kureishi's plays were staged by The Royal Court, among other fringe theaters. 
"The King and Me," a well-received short play about a man obsessed with Elvis, 
prompted an English professor friend to make a career-swerving suggestion: " 
'Why don't you write about your own background, being Asian in Britain? This 
material is so rich. No one's really written about it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Kureishi began peopling his plays with Asians and fascists, among others, 
finding a voice in the Royal Shakespeare Company -- and trouble with some 
colleagues in the theater, who attacked him for his complicated portrayals of 
Asians. The novel's Karim, too, provokes his colleagues in the theater when he 
portrays Asian characters as sometimes irrational and foolish. Both take place 
in the politically sensitive '70s. 
</P>
<P>
"We argued a lot about how women were presented because of the media being what 
it is -- full of stereotypes," Kureishi says. "People were always saying, 
'Well, the dominant culture has these stereotypes of Asian people. We mustn't 
reinforce them. We must show them as being good and loyal, primarily as nice 
people. We mustn't show them as tricky, because people already think of Asian 
people as tricky.' 
</P>
<P>
"It's very hard if you're a writer to write a play about nice people shaking 
hands all the time. So I never took any notice of it and I never have. I'm not 
doing PR. Does Shakespeare present Hamlet as a nice Danish prince? A writer's 
job, if we have any job in society, is to tell the truth as we see it, to write 
about the world as we observe it, and the world is a strange place and people 
are divided, unusual, wicked and good." 
</P>
<P>
In those lean years, Kureishi padded his purse by writing magazine pornography 
under various pen names, among them Antonia French. "I destroyed all that 
stuff. I should have kept it. It's a terrible form, though, pornography. It's 
so limited. There's no black people. There's no old people. You know what you 
have to do and you do it." Kureishi was rescued from obscurity by Independent 
Television's Channel 4, which commissioned him in 1984 to write a teleplay. 
That teleplay was "Laundrette." 
</P>
<P>
"We ran it at the Edinburgh Festival, Daniel Day-Lewis, (director) Stephen 
(Frears), (producer) Tim Bevan and I. Dan and I were talking about it the other 
day, and we said, 'That's the day our lives changed.' " 
</P>
<P>
The 1985 film, about cultural collisions encountered by a gay couple who 
operate a Laundromat, was the darling of the critics. Orion picked it up for 
theatrical distribution in the United States, where its quirkiness and fearless 
take on homosexuality won it a devoted following. "The 'Laundrette' got a 
really big gay audience," Kureishi says. "It was one of the first films to lock 
into that audience, I think. I don't think people realized that there were 
these huge communities all over the world that never got any movies made for or 
about them." 
</P>
<P>
Although Kureishi has snippily likened the usual anonymity of screenwriters to 
that of medieval architects, the press often gave him equal billing with Frears 
because of the film's unusual and personal subject matter. 
</P>
<P>
But even if Kureishi achieved some measure of fame with "Laundrette," 
remuneration was somewhat more elusive. The screenwriter saw little of the $10 
million made by the $1-million film -- just enough, though, to buy two years of 
freedom that enabled him to return to novel writing -- in some ways, Kureishi's 
form of choice. "A movie is 90 minutes, two hours, and you've got to get in and 
out pretty quick. You've got much more space in a novel. It's a limitless form. 
You can go off here. You can go off there. You can go around the corner. You 
can go back to the past. You can have much more fun in that way. And you don't 
have to hand it over to anybody else, to act as a director. It's published as 
you wrote it. Wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
These days, Kureishi lives with his girlfriend, Tracey Scoffield, who works in 
publishing. They live in west London, in a "sort of bedsitter land," a modest 
neighborhood with small flats for transients, students and immigrants. Kureishi 
is taking his first turn at bat as a director, which makes him nervous, even 
though he wrote the screenplay. Its working title is "London Kills Me," and 
it's about "three kids involved with drugs in London, squatters and homeless 
and round and about." 
</P>
<P>
Kureishi says that city will always loom large in his writing, because while 
his work attempts to grasp the slippery issue of cultural identity, Kureishi's 
own identity is unswerving. "You always know who you are until people ask you 
about it, really, don't you? Like (English author/director) Jonathan Miller 
said, he didn't realize he was Jewish until somebody said, 'What's it like 
being Jewish?' It's rather like that. I always felt I was an English boy until 
people said to me, 'Do you really belong here?' Or, 'Do you feel at home in 
England?' people would say, when I was 15, 16, which rather disturbed me 
because I never thought about it any more than anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
"So your identity doesn't get shaken until other people doubt it. One's 
identity has to be some sort of alliance between the way you see yourself and 
the way other people in the world see you. I'm an English writer, a British 
writer, let's say with an Indian background. And there's going to be more and 
more of that in England."

ILESIC GETS HIS FOOT IN THE DOOR IN COMPETITION FOR PUNTING JOB 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 13 seasons in the Canadian Football League, punter Hank Ilesic became a 
30-year-old NFL rookie with San Diego last season. As a result, he says it was 
"my worst year ever in professional football." 
</P>
<P>
He averaged 40.1 yards on 76 punts, numbers that looked pretty good to the 
Rams, who had watched the alarmingly inconsistent Dale Hatcher stagger to his 
worst season in five years with the team. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams left Hatcher unprotected and he ended up in Green Bay. San Diego left 
Ilesic unprotected and he's now a Ram. So a couple of Plan Bs ended up with a 
chance to be somebody's Plan A again. 
</P>
<P>
Ilesic will be competing with rookie Kent Elmore, a seventh-round pick who 
averaged 40.2 yards at Tennessee, for the Rams' job. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy with the way both of them are kicking right now," Coach John 
Robinson said Thursday, the last day of mini-camp at Rams Park. "Hank's a good 
punter. He was under a lot of pressure (in San Diego). Things were falling 
apart in that area." 
</P>
<P>
Ilesic certainly got a club-on-the-head introduction to the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
After playing two exhibition games and 10 regular-season games with the Toronto 
Argonauts last year, he got out of his contract and arrived in San Diego in 
time to have Kansas City Coach Marty Schottenheimer question the legality of 
his punting shoe. Ilesic had to cut off a flap that covered the laces. Still, 
he managed to average 44.8 yards on five punts in his NFL debut. 
</P>
<P>
But the situation -- not to mention the protection -- quickly began to 
deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
Ilesic signed to play professional football as a 17-year-old senior at St. 
Joseph's High School in Edmonton. He has six CFL championship Grey Cup rings 
locked in a safe deposit box at home in Toronto and two other times his team 
lost in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
He had grown accustomed to winning. Then the Chargers finished 6-10 last 
season, in last place in the AFC West. 
</P>
<P>
Ilesic hasn't been around Rams Park long, but he already is feeling more at 
home then he did in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing you really notice is that the atmosphere in the locker room is 
very different on a winning team," he said. "It's much looser. You establish 
closer relationships with your teammates. You have fun. You enjoy being out 
here. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess that's because it's a relatively more stable environment compared to a 
losing team, where you don't know what's going to happen today or tomorrow. 
You're always looking over your shoulder and wondering, 'Is it my fault we're 
losing?' There are fingers being pointed and that adds a lot of pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Ilesic, who averaged a career-high 48.5 yards per punt with Toronto in 1986, 
never had an average below 42.5 until last season. He said he succumbed to 
pressures, real and imagined. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year was definitely a learning experience," he said. "I had to learn the 
NFL game overnight. I had to learn the game on the field. I suppose that's the 
fastest way to learn, but it's certainly not the easiest. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, I'm more settled down. And the blocking patterns are much different 
here than in San Diego. I never had one blocked last year, but I got a lot of 
pressure. My timing and rhythm were off and when you speed things up, mistakes 
are going to happen. Then you start thinking too much and begin to lose 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
That was never a problem when he was known as "the Ray Guy of Canada," or even 
when Toronto fans started calling him "Hank the Shank" during his attempts to 
wrangle out of his contract with the Argonauts. 
</P>
<P>
After booming off a number of towering punts Thursday, Ilesic said he felt good 
about his chances of playing for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
"Competition brings the best out in me," he said. "I think it's necessary. It's 
human nature to become complacent if you know the job is yours." 
</P>
<P>
If Hank Ilesic has learned anything about punting over the past 13 years, it's 
that nothing in this business is certain. It's a fickle game. 
</P>
<P>
"You can be a hero one moment and a goat the very next," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And if you don't believe him, just ask Dale Hatcher. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Robinson said he doesn't like to make evaluations based on 
performances in a four-day mini-camp, but he did say that he felt the key to 
the Rams' success this season would be the development of a number of young 
players. "I think we're going to be improved in a lot of areas on this team," 
he said. "We have a lot of first- and second-year men that now have to assert 
themselves and become real players." . . . Speaking of rookies, Robinson was 
impressed with what he saw of center Bern Brostek, the Rams' No. 1 draft 
choice. "It usually takes offensive linemen a couple of years, but I think he 
will be able to help us this year," he said. "We've brought him into a 
situation where we are very strong (center Doug Smith has been to six 
consecutive Pro Bowls), but I think he can play guard for us too." . . .
