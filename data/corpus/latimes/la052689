HISTORIAN ANDREAS HILLGRUBER; CATALYST OF HOLOCAUST DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
COLOGNE, West Germany 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andreas Hillgruber, a controversial German historian and catalyst of 
acrimonious debate on the historical perspective of the Holocaust, died this 
month after a long illness, Cologne University said Thursday. He was 64. 
</P>
<P>
The university said he died May 8 but did not provide details of his illness. 
</P>
<P>
Hillgruber, a Cologne University professor and prolific author, gained respect 
among historians around the world for his detailed works on Adolf Hitler's rise 
to power and the Nazi dictator's foreign policies. His theories also sparked 
widespread argument. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bitter Arguments 
</P>
<P>
Over the last three years, Hillgruber -- considered by some to be an apologist 
for German war crimes -- was involved in bitter arguments among West German 
academicians over the historical interpretation of the Holocaust, in which 6 
million Jews were killed. 
</P>
<P>
Hillgruber supported the view that, historically speaking, the Holocaust, 
although certainly atrocious, could not be singled out as generally different 
from other atrocities, like Josef Stalin's reign of terror in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
In a controversial 1986 book titled "The Destruction of the German Reich and 
the End of European Judaism," he also praised the German army's last-ditch 
attempt in 1945 to fend off Soviet troops, saying that it gave civilians time 
to flee from "revenge organs of the Red Army." 
</P>
<P>
His writings, it was suggested, encouraged comparisons between the Holocaust 
and the raping and pillaging by advancing Soviet troops. 
</P>
<P>
Hillgruber also contended that it was Austria, more than Germany, that created 
the anti-Semitism that produced the Holocaust, and that it was Hitler's 
personal extremism, not Germany's, that led to the persecution of Jews. 
Additionally, Hillgruber argued that the Allies decided to crush Germany long 
before they knew of Nazi atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Provoked Anger 
</P>
<P>
The book provoked anger among some West Germans, with many newspapers calling 
it a scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow historians said Hillgruber will long be respected for his earlier work. 
</P>
<P>
"He was an excellent historian, particularly on Hitler's political and military 
plans, which were the basis for Hitler's program to conquer the world," said 
Reinhard Meyers, a historian at Muenster University. 
</P>
<P>
Hillgruber's other works include "The Second World War 1939-45: Goals and 
Strategies of the Great Powers," "The Destruction of Europe" and "Hitler's 
Strategies, Policies and Leadership From 1940-41."

J. ARTHUR CAMPBELL; CHANGED TEACHING OF CHEMISTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
J. Arthur Campbell, a Harvey Mudd College professor credited with changing the 
way in which chemistry is taught to young people, has died of Lou Gehrig's 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
George McKelvey, a longtime colleague, said Campbell died Monday at his 
Claremont home after battling amytrophic lateral sclerosis for nearly three 
years. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, the first faculty member hired by Harvey Mudd when it opened in 1957, 
had continued to teach at the school for some time after his illness was 
diagnosed despite having officially retired two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
During his first years at Harvey Mudd, he was chosen as chairman of a new high 
school chemistry program under the auspices of the American Chemical Society. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Innovative Project 
</P>
<P>
The project involved textual study, classroom instruction, testing, modern 
laboratory equipment and short films. Called the CHEM Study, it is now in use 
by more than half the high school chemistry students in the country, said 
Joseph B. Platt, the founding president of Harvey Mudd and the administrator 
who recruited Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell was revered by his students, Platt said, adding that when Harvey Mudd 
recently linked its newest, most powerful computer into a worldwide science 
network, they dubbed it "J. Arthur." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell had headed the college's chemistry department for 25 years. In 1981, 
Change magazine rated it the best undergraduate program in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, who held a doctorate from the University of California, is survived 
by his wife, Dorothy, two daughters, five granddaughters and a great-grandson. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial will be held June 11 at 2 p.m. at the college and friends are asked 
to contribute to a scholarship fund there in Campbell's name.

BUDGET MUST FIND ROOM TO ADD 140 POLICE, CITY ORDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN and RICHARD A. SERRANO, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two days after declaring that drug- and gang-related violence had created a 
"state of emergency," the San Diego City Council on Thursday ordered City 
Manager John Lockwood to find the money in next year's budget to add 140 police 
officers and two police substations. 
</P>
<P>
The 9-0 council vote will require Lockwood to cut $10 million from other city 
departments to pay for the new officers and 46 support personnel needed to back 
them up. 
</P>
<P>
Even more cuts would be required to acquire land and begin designing the 
substations, which could cost as much as $3.5 million apiece, and to hire city 
attorneys and communications personnel to augment the beefed-up police force, 
Lockwood said. 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood said he hopes to accomplish the spending reductions without laying off 
city employees but will not rule out the possibility of small cuts in the city 
work force. Lockwood refused to say Thursday where the cuts might be made, but 
other city departments include parks and recreation, planning, engineering and 
development, and libraries. 
</P>
<P>
When added to the 22 new officers already proposed by Lockwood, the council 
plan would increase the number of officers in the Police Department -- the 
city's largest general fund agency -- by nearly 10%. 
</P>
<P>
The spending blueprint could put 162 new officers on the street by the end of 
summer in 1990, Lockwood said. The substations, one of which appears destined 
for the high-crime intersection at 30th Street and Imperial Avenue -- proposed 
by Mayor Maureen O'Connor in her January State of the City address -- could be 
open within two or three years, according to Councilman Ed Struiksma. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor said the plan is intended to show Gov. George Deukmejian that the 
council is serious about its request that he also declare a state of emergency 
and grant the city $34 million in state aid -- a prospect that appeared 
increasingly dim Thursday. The plan was devised at a private, morning meeting 
of the "local disaster council" formed Tuesday after the council's emergency 
declaration. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor made the highly unusual request for a gubernatorial emergency 
declaration, traditionally reserved for natural disasters, in a letter to 
Deukmejian on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're trying to tell the state is that this is serious and we're cut to 
the bone," said O'Connor, who two days ago described the crime crisis as beyond 
the control of local "services, personnel, equipment and facilities." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mayor Calls Budget 'Wholly Inadequate' 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, she again argued that city funding is "wholly inadequate" to pay 
for more jails, courts, prosecutors and other law enforcement needs that total 
more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
A Deukmejian spokesman Thursday issued his most definitive statement yet that 
the governor has no intention of singling out San Diego for a piece of the 
state's new-found,$2.5 billion budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no plans to proclaim a state of emergency," said Kevin Brett, 
Deukmejian's press secretary. "What we have before us is a $34-million budget 
</P>
<P>
request that will be decided in the normal budget process." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the city never receives a dime from Sacramento, the mayor's emergency 
declaration appears to have created a political climate in which the council 
has no choice but to beef up the police force at almost any cost to other city 
priorities. The escalation of rhetoric on drugs and gangs is particularly 
sensitive for the four council members who face district-only elections for the 
first time this year. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, those close to the mayor insisted that her purpose in 
declaring a state of emergency was solely to get a piece of the state budget 
surplus. They insisted there was no intention of raising the stakes on the city 
budget to force the council to spend more money for police. 
</P>
<P>
But, on Thursday, that appeared to be the unintended consequence of her gambit. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council has repeatedly announced its intentions to find the $18.5 
million needed for the first year of a three-year, $62.2-million program to 
increase police coverage from 1.62 officers per thousand residents to two 
officers per thousand. But the extremely tight fiscal 1989-90 budget Lockwood 
proposed May 11 actually would have reduced police presence to 1.59 officers 
per thousand residents. 
</P>
<P>
Though it is impossible to predict whether the council will adopt the new 
spending plan that Lockwood will suggest to the emergency panel Tuesday, there 
appears to be very strong support for the 140 new police officers, regardless 
of the cost to other city departments. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question in my mind that we will have the 140 additional officers," 
said Struiksma, who serves on the emergency council with O'Connor, Councilman 
Wes Pratt, Councilwoman Gloria McColl, Lockwood, City Atty. John Witt and 
Police Chief Bob Burgreen. "There is no question in my mind that we will have 
the resources for two additional substations." 
</P>
<P>
"I never commit until absolutely the final vote," O'Connor said. "But I can 
tell you there is strong support for the 140, including myself." 
</P>
<P>
A fifth vote could come from Councilman Bob Filner, who has repeatedly said he 
would ask the council to cut its budget deeply to put more officers on the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the one who brought up that we ought to tighten our own budget," he said 
Thursday. "I'm glad that they finally agreed with it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Per 1,000 People 
</P>
<P>
An additional 140 police officers would be almost one-third of the 440 needed 
to bring the city police force to two officers per thousand people over three 
years. Still, Burgreen cautioned, added manpower won't curb the crime rate if 
there is no new jail space to house offenders. 
</P>
<P>
The chief said, "140 new officers and two new substations really would help us 
to increase service to the community." 
</P>
<P>
"If we can convince the state about the seriousness of the jail crisis in San 
Diego, then we could really begin to show some progress in our fight against 
the growing crime problem." 
</P>
<P>
To reinforce the seriousness of their request for emergency state aid, council 
members told Lockwood and Witt to ask the county Board of Supervisors, Sheriff 
John Duffy and Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller for help in devising a spending plan 
for the $34 million. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor also plans to meet with Bush Administration drug czar William Bennett 
in an attempt to win federal support for the city's drug-related law 
enforcement needs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Near 30th, Imperial 
</P>
<P>
Although the first substation sought by the council is expected to go near 30th 
and Imperial, police would like the second substation near 40th Street and 
University Avenue, which would be roughly between the two large and 
overburdened Southeastern and Eastern police divisions, police spokesman Dave 
Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
"It would make sense to place something in that widespread area to cut off some 
of the police travel response times and the size" of the existing patrol 
divisions, Cohen said. "Southeastern has a large area to cover, as does 
Eastern, and it's a high-density population area there." 
</P>
<P>
Pratt suggested that the second substation could go somewhere in mid-city or on 
East Mesa; Struiksma suggested that it would be placed in mid-city. 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood said money for the substation would come from his proposed 
$260-million capital improvement budget and would be phased in over the several 
years required to acquire land and build the facilities. Also uncertain is how 
large the substations would be, though O'Connor said she hopes the Southeast 
San Diego facility will be able to house the entire 86-person Special 
Enforcement Detail targeted at drug- and gang-related crime. 
</P>
<P>
Cuts in the proposed $404.7-million operating budget to finance the additional 
officers could be difficult. The budget already includes large reductions in 
park, recreation and library services, and a mandate that city employees 
provide more services without corresponding budget increases.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SALE OF POKER CLUB DELAYED BY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sale of the Horseshoe Club, one of Gardena's three poker clubs, was put on 
hold this week when the City Council voted to table a proposal from a group of 
investors who balked at the city's requirements for a license transfer. 
</P>
<P>
City officials on Tuesday told prospective buyer Herbert Stern and his partner, 
Leonard Baum, that before the city would approve issuing a license to the 
group, five conditions must be met, including the establishment of a $180,000 
escrow account to cover four weeks' pay for the club's 250 employees. 
</P>
<P>
The city also requested a letter of credit for $6 million. Stern, former 
president of an investment group that owned the Commerce Club, must also sever 
all ties with that club. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the conditions were necessary to ensure the club's solvency 
during an extensive remodeling of its facilities at Vermont and Rosecrans 
avenues.

SEEKERS OF SITE FOR NEW AIRPORT TO TAKE YET ANOTHER LOOK AT LINDBERGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with resistance from public officials in the South Bay to locating a new 
airport near the border, civic leaders looking to relocate Lindbergh Field say 
they will examine -- for one last time -- whether the aging center-city airport 
can be revived as the region's air hub. 
</P>
<P>
The move to take another look at Lindbergh was approved on Thursday by a panel 
of locally elected officials convened by the San Diego Assn. of Governments 
(Sandag) to help oversee a yearlong, $350,000 study of where to put a new 
regional airport. 
</P>
<P>
The change, requested by Chula Vista Mayor Greg Cox, is a significant departure 
for the study, which has been predicated on the belief that Lindbergh would be 
abandoned as San Diego's primary air field because of limited capacity, as well 
as safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Band-Aid' Fixes 
</P>
<P>
Lindbergh is one of the nation's smallest airports serving a major city, with 
only 471 acres and one long runway. It is so overburdened that the San Diego 
Port District, which owns the facility, has recently embarked on a $27-million 
"Band-Aid" program to expand the field's capacity until a replacement is found. 
</P>
<P>
The study has also assumed that a new regional airport would need a minimum of 
4,000 acres and two runways to accommodate an estimated 40 million annual 
passengers by the middle of the next century. 
</P>
<P>
Those constraints have led Sandag and its consultant, KPMB Peat Marwick of San 
Francisco, to identify three preliminary sites for a new airport -- the Miramar 
Naval Air Station, a tract of land east of Miramar and Otay Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The South Bay proposal contemplates construction of a joint international 
airport with Tijuana that would traverse the border and absorb 3,400 to 6,600 
acres of prime developable land on Otay Mesa. It has been the favorite of San 
Diego City Councilman Ron Roberts, a major proponent of relocating Lindbergh, 
which lies on bayfront property within his district. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
South Bay Backlash 
</P>
<P>
But talk of a border airport has prompted a backlash from South Bay officials, 
who complain that they don't want to be the region's dumping ground for 
unpopular public works projects like a secondary sewage-treatment plant and 
state prisons, which either already exist or are planned for the area. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time there is a regional problem and where they need to dump the 
problem, it always seems so convenient to find a place in the South Bay," 
County Supervisor Brian Bilbray said before Thursday's Sandag panel meeting of 
the Policy Committee. A member of the panel, Bilbray argued for the change in 
the study to include Lindbergh. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything from sewers to hazardous waste to airports and jails . . . there is 
a feeling that the political path takes the least resistance and it is easier 
to dump on the working class in the South Bay rather than the wealthy people in 
the north," Bilbray said. 
</P>
<P>
Bilbray said he is also concerned about the findings of a Sandag report, 
released earlier this month, that shows the proposed international airport 
would gobble up the most land in private ownership of any proposal. The border 
airport could consume as much as 5,585 acres, contrasted with only 76 acres at 
Miramar and no private land if the airport is moved farther east. 
</P>
<P>
Bilbray said the city of San Diego has used Otay Mesa as the "sacrificial lamb" 
in development wars, restricting growth in the northern areas while encouraging 
developers to seek their fortunes unrestricted near the border. Taking that 
land away from developers now for an airport will be difficult, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough, once you've thrown it to the wolves, to get it back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Affect of Noise 
</P>
<P>
The Sandag study also shows that more people may be affected by jet noise from 
a border airport than at the two other alternatives. Projections show that 
nearly 30,000 people -- mostly in University City and La Jolla -- could be 
living under jet noise by the year 2010 if a new airport were to replace the 
Navy at Miramar. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there could be as many as 44,200 people in San Ysidro and southern 
Chula Vista living in the jet noise zone under one scenario in the South Bay, 
the report shows. A second configuration of runways across the border would 
affect only 6,470 people, estimates show. 
</P>
<P>
Those kind of worries, said Cox, prompted the Chula Vista City Council to vote 
last month to request that Sandag change its study to re-examine the question 
of keeping Lindbergh -- a move he agreed Thursday could take the heat off South 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"My concern is the impact it would have on Chula Vista," Cox said. "We're 
talking about a new imposition." 
</P>
<P>
Before that happens, Cox said, he wants to make sure that Sandag takes a 
"critical look at Lindbergh to see what has to be done to continue to allow us 
to keep it as a regional airport." 
</P>
<P>
Even if it meant buying up 1,000 million-dollar homes, that still may be 
cheaper than buying the land in Otay Mesa, where more than $1 billion worth of 
infrastructure has been invested, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cox's suggestion was even endorsed by those on the Sandag panel who believe 
that Lindbergh is a lost cause, including Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
"It is hopeless, but the public generally is not aware of the entire range of 
problems as we grow, as we increase in air traffic and we try to maintain an 
airport at Lindbergh Field," Roberts said. "It's good that we include it in the 
study. . . . I'm reasonably certain that the life span of Lindbergh Field is 
very limited." 
</P>
<P>
Escondido Councilman Ernie Cowan also agreed that Lindbergh should now be 
included in the study, which is scheduled for completion in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"From a public perception standpoint, it's a snake we have to kill," Cowan 
said. "We can finally, empirically say, 'Here it is folks. This is why it 
(Lindbergh) won't work.' "

A CLEAR-CUT CASE OF NICE WEATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"No significant change" is foreseen by the National Weather Service for the 
Memorial Day weekend, which means we can expect near-perfect weather for 
outdoor activities. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not much change," forecaster Frank Perdue said. "It's going to stay 
the same. What we saw (Thursday) will be what we will see through the weekend." 
</P>
<P>
With no changes in sight, San Diego will experience typical May weather the 
entire weekend -- night and morning low clouds lasting until mid-morning, when 
they give way to clear skies. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures at the beaches will reach 66 to 71 degrees, with sea breezes of 12 
to 18 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The coastal strip will have highs of 69 to 75 degrees and nighttime lows of 45 
to 52. The night and morning clouds will burn off by mid-morning. The inland 
valleys will have highs of 71 to 84 and lows of 45 to 52. 
</P>
<P>
There will be little change in temperatures Memorial Day, when temperatures in 
the coastal region should reach near 70 and, in the inland areas, near 80. Lows 
for the coastal section are expected to drop to 60 degrees and to the low-50s 
inland. 
</P>

TOYOTA DECIDES AGAINST UNLOADING SHIP IN SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Stunned port officials and longshoremen reacted with disbelief Thursday after 
Toyota officials announced that the company is pulling out of a deal to ship 
about 4,300 new vehicles to San Diego over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Unified Port District spokesman Dan Wilkins said port officials are 
disappointed by Toyota's action, which deprives the cargo-starved port of a 
windfall source of jobs and revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been given an official reason for their decision. But we are 
disappointed at the loss of longshoremen's jobs and opportunities for the 
stevedoring companies. We were informed (Wednesday) night that Toyota had made 
an operational decision, and the ship would not be coming. We don't believe 
that was because of anything we did," Wilkins said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Explanations 
</P>
<P>
J. R. (Chayo) Colmenero, secretary-treasurer for the Longshoremen's &amp; 
Warehousemen's International Union, Local 29, said he was notified of Toyota's 
decision early Thursday morning. Colmenero and other union officials had been 
scheduled to meet with port authorities later in the day to discuss the 
unloading of the ship, which was expected to dock on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"We were told that the meeting and work were canceled. But nobody gave us an 
explanation why. We're all in the dark and wondering what the hell's going on. 
There were a lot of people counting on the work, and a lot of them are going to 
be angry," Colmenero said. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Sanchez, spokeswoman for Toyota's U. S. sales and distribution 
headquarters in Torrance, said that Toyota decided to order the ship to Long 
Beach, which was its initial destination, because there suddenly was space 
available to unload. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Sanchez had said that Toyota was diverting the ship to San Diego 
because Toyota's unloading facility at the Port of Long Beach was crowded with 
thousands of cars awaiting transport to Southern California dealers. The plan 
was for San Diego longshoremen to drive the cars off the ship, after which they 
would be transported by truck to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
However, those plans were abruptly changed Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'There's Now Room' 
</P>
<P>
"We decided to go ahead and order the ship to Long Beach because some of our 
inventory had moved," said Sanchez. "The dealers in the Los Angeles basin have 
been ordering and moving vehicles at a fast pace. So, there's now room to 
discharge the vehicles in Long Beach." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unexpected Opportunity 
</P>
<P>
Toyota signed an agreement Tuesday with San Diego port officials for the ship's 
arrival at the 24th Street Pier in National City. Along with other fees, Toyota 
agreed to pay a fee of $14 per vehicle and a dockage fee of $1,734 per day. 
Local 29's membership of 78 workers, who earn a base wage of $19.80 an hour, 
welcomed the unexpected job opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"We were gearing up for Sunday," Colmenero said. 
</P>
<P>
Port officials, who have been quietly working to attract auto ships to San 
Diego, reacted favorably to Toyota's request to bring the ship to San Diego. 
Bill Stonehouse, the port's director of trade development, said the ship would 
have been the first modern vessel, from which cars are driven off, to dock in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of the ship's arrival, port officials put a fence around the 
pier to secure the vehicles after they were unloaded. Toyota had also agreed to 
hire security guards that would patrol the pier 24 hours a day, until all the 
vehicles had left for Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years the Port of San Diego has suffered a sharp decline in 
dockworker jobs and cargo as port officials promote restaurants, hotels and 
tourist attractions on the waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, 1.3 million metric tons of cargo passed through the port. During the 
same period, the Port of Long Beach recorded 63.4 million metric tons of cargo, 
while the Port of Los Angeles reported 60.8 million metric tons.

HALL TAKES BIG MONEY LEAD OVER BERNARDI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE and JAMES QUINN, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Council candidate Lyle Hall raised nearly twice as much money 
as incumbent Councilman Ernani Bernardi between March and May, campaign finance 
statements filed Thursday disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
The frugal Bernardi, however, still had more money in the bank than Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, a city fire captain and former president of the firefighters union, 
received one-third of his $131,413 total from unions and from 129 individual 
firefighters, most of whom live outside the council district. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi raised $71,049 from a variety of sources, ranging from car dealers to 
developers to attorneys. More of Bernardi's contributions -- 16% -- came from 
sources within the 7th District, which stretches across the northeast San 
Fernando Valley. Only 7% of Hall's money came from inside the district. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi, a 28-year council veteran, was forced into a June 6 runoff after he 
failed to gain more than half of the votes in the April primary. Before the 
primary, Bernardi raised slightly more money -- $54,897 to Hall's $41,505. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Beholden to Unions' 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi could not be reached for comment Thursday night, but in the past has 
frequently criticized his opponent for being "beholden to the labor unions" 
because of Hall's strong union support. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hall said Thursday that he is "not beholden to anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Hall also said he attracts donations because "people that follow the political 
process have made their decision about who's going to win." 
</P>
<P>
Since the primary, more than half of Hall's $41,175 in union contributions came 
from individual firefighters and unions that represent them. The rest came from 
sources ranging from police to plumbers. 
</P>
<P>
The United Auto Workers was the only union that backed Bernardi, giving him 
$500. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$42,481 in Debt 
</P>
<P>
But expensive mailings from Hall to district residents and consulting fees paid 
to his campaign manager, Harvey Englander, caused Hall to spend more than he 
raised. At the end of the reporting period, May 20, he was $42,481 in debt, not 
counting a $15,000 personal loan that he took out at the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi, who brags that his frugality always leaves him a large surplus in his 
council office budget, spent only $58,226 of his campaign funds and took out no 
loans. That left him with $42,391, to Hall's $10,618 in cash on hand. However, 
Hall held a fund-raising dinner Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
A controversial issue in the campaign was reflected in the finance statements. 
</P>
<P>
A proposal to locate the Nancy Reagan Center for drug rehabilitation in Lake 
View Terrace is opposed by neighborhood organizations. Bernardi, who has joined 
the opposition, reported receiving $750 from Phyllis Hines, an officer in the 
Lake View Terrace Improvement Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, who favors the center, received $500 from attorney Dale K. Neal of Latham 
&amp; Watkins, the firm that is representing the center's backers. 
</P>
<P>
Neither candidate received much financial support from other politicians. 
Bernardi reported a $500 contribution from Councilman Marvin Braude and another 
$500 from Braude's wife, Marjorie. Hall got $100 from state Sen. John Garamendi 
(D-Walnut Grove). 
</P>
<P>
The two candidates made a joint appearance before a senior citizens group in 
Sherman Oaks Thursday, with the 77-year-old Bernardi trying to woo his 
contemporaries by complaining that Hall has suggested that the elderly should 
not hold office. 
</P>
<P>
"You're looking at a man who, according to Lyle Hall, is too old to represent 
you," Bernardi said. 
</P>
<P>
But the remark got only scattered applause, and members of Seniors for Action 
quickly returned the candidates forum to the social causes that are close to 
their hearts. 
</P>
<P>
Both candidates got a generally favorable response from the sometimes militant 
group, which lobbies for better bus service, stricter rent control, improved 
Medicare benefits and crime prevention measures. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, 49, regularly tells voters that it is time for a "fresh, aggressive and 
realistic point of view" on the council, and suggests that voters could begin 
by retiring Bernardi. But he refrained from such language Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the city fire captain emphasized his qualifications and his record of 
activity on behalf of the firefighters union and other groups. 
</P>
<P>
In response to questions, he said he opposes the proposed use of the National 
Guard to help deal with youth gangs, saying it should be saved for 
"extraordinary emergencies." He also advocated, as a crime-fighting measure, 
creation of street-lighting assessment districts, with the assessments to 
become liens on affected properties, to be paid only when the land is sold. 
</P>
<P>
He told the group that the experience of New York and other cities, which have 
a higher proportion of police officers to residents than Los Angeles, shows 
that "you never have enough police to solve the crime problem." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Hall said, governments should offer more social programs, including 
improved education, to "provide a break in the chain of despair" that he said 
is the root of urban crime. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi, long a critic of redevelopment and what he views as unnecessarily 
high salaries for city employees, especially administrators, once again 
attacked Hall as a pawn of "militant city employee unions that have been trying 
to get me out for a decade." 
</P>
<P>
He also defended his record of fighting crime in his district, saying a section 
of Blythe Street in Van Nuys, which until recently was a haven for drug sellers 
and other criminals, is "almost bearable now." 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi credited intensive police patrols, paid for with funds that he secured 
to pay officers for overtime work. 
</P>
<P>
The two agreed that council members' existing annual salary of $58,000 is 
adequate. Bernardi said that with "free trips and other perks, the $58,000 is 
comparable to an $80,000 to $90,000 annual salary."

DEAR CLAUDE PEPPER. . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Claude Pepper (D-Fla.), the oldest member of Congress, is 88 and ailing. 
He deserves our affectionate attention and praise because of the difference he 
has made in the lives of senior citizens, poor workers, sick children and other 
Americans in need. 
</P>
<P>
Long a friend of the elderly, Pepper has been a guardian of Medicare and Social 
Security. His reluctant support of compromises to keep the system solvent 
proved persuasive six years ago. Older men and women can work longer because 
his efforts to raise the minimum mandatory retirement age from 65 to 70 became 
law a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
Idealistic and an "ideological soul mate" of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's 
New Deal, Pepper, a Harvard-educated lawyer, began his congressional career 
with his election to the Senate from Florida in 1936. A year later, he 
sponsored the bill that created the National Cancer Institute and paved the way 
for the other national institutes of health. Two years later, he pushed for 
passage of the minimum wage, although the proposal was politically unpopular in 
the South. 
</P>
<P>
Putting principles before politics led to the end of Pepper's Senate career. 
Derisively nicknamed "Red" Pepper, he was smeared as a friend of Communists and 
black Americans during a dirty and disgraceful campaign. A former protege, 
George A. Smathers, beat him in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
Claude Pepper returned to Congress when he was elected to the House from Miami 
in 1962. He is a champion to his district and to his national constituency -- 
Americans who need help.

10 STEPS TO CURB DRUNK DRIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial praise of our soon-to-retire U.S. surgeon general "A Doctor Up 
to the Task" (May 13) was right on: "Dr. C. Everett Koop put public health 
before politics as the nation's surgeon general, and President Bush should keep 
that example in mind as he seeks a replacement." 
</P>
<P>
But the public-health perspective and pro-activity practiced by Dr. Koop went 
far beyond providing "much-needed leadership in educating the public about 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome and the hazards of smoking." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Koop conducted a surgeon general's workshop on drunk driving on Dec. 14-16, 
1988, to develop recommendations for a comprehensive plan to bring impaired 
driving under control and eliminate it as the leading cause of death and 
disability among young people. Highlighting the 250 recommendations and 
implementation activities developed by 11 expert panels are these 10: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Equalize federal excise tax rates for all alcoholic beverages by raising 
the rates for beer and wine to that of distilled spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Adopt or strengthen server/seller liability statutes and practices to 
encourage responsible serving and selling practices. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Require alcohol advertisers to give equal time to health and safety 
messages. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Eliminate alcohol advertising and promotion and sponsorship of public 
events where the majority of the audience are under the drinking age. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Require state and local police to obtain the blood alcohol concentration of 
all drivers and non-motorists involved in fatal and serious motor vehicle 
crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Integrate drinking and driving information in all health promotion/risk 
reduction programs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Conduct research on effective community approaches to drinking and driving 
prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Establish a coalition of national and local advocacy groups for 
coordination, exchange of information, and strategic planning. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Include drinking and driving information in health professionals' training. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Strengthen laws concerning hours of sale, characteristics and density of 
outlets, and other factors relating to retail availability of alcoholic 
beverages.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Traffic statistics released by the San Diego Police Department for the first 
four months of 1989 show a 24.4% decrease in fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Bill Robinson said Thursday that, of the 31 fatalities 
reported through April, 14 involved only vehicles, 12 involved pedestrians, 4 
involved motorcycles and 1 involved a bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-one fatalities were reported during the same period in 1988. There were 
12 fatalities from vehicle accidents, 15 involving pedestrians, 11 involving 
motorcycles and 3 involving bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably a combination of things that results in the decrease, like 
awareness of the other person's right of way, awareness of the penalties for 
drunk driving, signals being posted and not speeding," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
From 40% to 50% of the vehicle accidents were related to drunk driving, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the number of pedestrian fatalities, police have implemented a 
pedestrian education program, Robinson said.

A TRADE HULLABALOO THAT NEED NOT BE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES D. HODGSON, James D. Hodgson served as U.S. ambassador to Japan from 
1974 until 1977. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Too often we see problems of perception and wounded feelings surface in the 
U.S.-Japan relationship. On issue after issue, Americans have come away from a 
negotiation believing they have reached a firm accord guaranteeing finite 
results conditioned by their own practices. The Japanese, on the other hand, 
possess a more flexible view. They feel what they have committed themselves to 
is a diligent effort to reach mutually desired goals. Later, when either the 
schedule or the numerical target is not quite reached, a hullabaloo breaks out. 
Americans profess outrage; Japanese feel bashed. Too often a clash of this kind 
has erupted as cultural and business practice differences arise to put the 
parties at odds. Many scars linger. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone appreciates the efforts made by Japan's electronics industry since 
the 1986 U.S.-Japan semiconductor agreement. Significant advances have been 
made and the prospect for sustained growth of U.S. sales in Japan enhanced. In 
1988 alone, U.S. producers increased their sales to Japan by 55%. And the 
growth rate of foreign semiconductor sales to Japan far exceeded the growth of 
the Japanese semiconductor market as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these advances, the U.S. electronics industry is disgruntled. Its 
expectations have not been met. As a result, accusations have been hurled 
across the Pacific. This, of course, is not the first time misunderstandings 
have plagued an agreement between our two countries. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement established a target for imports of American semiconductor 
products. But the ink was hardly dry before clamor erupted. The Americans felt 
that the Japanese were committed to specific goals within specific timetables. 
The Japanese interpretation was that the commitment was to goals within a less 
rigid time period. So we now have on our hands another awkward dispute between 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
By now, our past experience in such negotiations should condition both sides to 
recognize that the party across the table brings with them a profoundly 
differing perspective. Expectations should be adjusted accordingly. By now, we 
should understand that even after a solemn agreement has been worked out 
laboriously and in good faith, disputes over interpretation are almost 
inevitable. Before either nation cries "foul," there should be careful 
consideration of both nations' differing traditions, standards and business 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
The two countries have a complex relationship. On the surface much seems 
serene. Japanese products do well in American markets. America finds Japan a 
reliable ally. But beneath the surface a sense of unease prevails and grows. 
Polls show that Americans see Japanese economic practices as unfair. The 
Japanese in turn blame faulty American policies for our disputes. 
</P>
<P>
Although the United States and Japan obviously have a wealth of common 
interests, we continue to suffer from recurrent fallout brought about by our 
wildly dissimilar cultures. 
</P>
<P>
When faced with an alien culture, suspicion of motives finds fertile soil in 
which to grow. Prudence dictates that this suspicion must not be permitted to 
fester. 
</P>
<P>
We can point to one positive feature that characterizes the electronics 
industry in both countries. In contrast to previous years, the Japanese and the 
American industriesnow deal directly with each other, rather than through 
respective government organizations. 
</P>
<P>
This kind of cooperative effort at international problem-solving has much to 
commend it. It is well for Japanese electronics manufacturers to bring their 
capabilities and needs to the attention of their American counterparts and to 
seek to induce American companies to design products marketable in Japan. At 
the same time, Americans must be assured that the often elusive Japanese market 
is open. 
</P>
<P>
We should all be encouraged by Japanese efforts to promote the current ongoing 
dialogue between U.S. suppliers and Japanese users. The recent seminar 
sponsored for this purpose by the Japanese electronic industry in the heart of 
California's Silicon Valley is a particularly conspicuous example of this 
outreach. 
</P>
<P>
Although many Americans have questioned Japanese intentions in this matter, a 
calmer appraisal would recognize that it is now actually in Japan's 
self-interest to increase imports, including imports of foreign semiconductors. 
Japan has acknowledged that it must expand its own consumer demand. To meet 
this demand, a new high level of goods from overseas is starting to flow in. 
Given time, this will substantially increase U.S. semiconductor exports and 
will serve to integrate American suppliers into Japan's economic system. 
Meanwhile, a bit of patience is wise counsel.

A PAPER TIGER OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE PEOPLE ONLY INVITES SOCIAL CHAOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WEIJIAN SHAN, Weijian Shan, a citizen of China, is an assistant professor of 
management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This month, the world has witnessed the enthusiastic support of the people from 
all walks of life for the striking students of China. The general public also 
is disenchanted and angry about the government's handling of the requests of 
the students and hunger-strikers for elimination of official corruption, for 
freedom of the press and assembly, and for democratic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Many people have wished that the huge scale and scope of the demonstrations 
would bring the regime of Deng Xiaoping and Premier Li Peng to its senses, and 
that it would keep its promise to address the concerns of the students and to 
move in the direction of democracy by engaging in political reforms. Harsh 
reality has shattered the last bit of hope of the people about the nature and 
the intention of those in power. 
</P>
<P>
The Li Peng government has responded to the people's movement with the 
incredible pomposity and contempt. The whole world has marveled at the 
discipline and the organization of the students and the peaceful nature of this 
mass movement, but the Communist leadership dismissed it as a "social 
disturbance instigated by a tiny minority of people with ulterior motives" and 
flatly refused to address the immediate concerns of the students. 
</P>
<P>
When they justifiably refused to accept this verdict, the government showed 
disdainful apathy to the thousands of hunger-strikers who were willing to die 
for the cause of democracy. Outraged by this attitude and alarmed by the 
imminent danger of sacrifice of the young students, the general populace joined 
the demonstration and petitioned the government to heed the students' demands. 
The government once again defied the will of the people by declaring martial 
law and threatening to "use all necessary means to forcefully stop violators," 
thus the leadership has squarely positioned itself at the opposite side of the 
people. 
</P>
<P>
The hard-liners of the government have completely lost touch with the Chinese 
people and have been pitifully unable to comprehend the meaning of the people's 
movement. In the 40 years of the People's Republic, including the tumultuous 
years of the Cultural Revolution, Beijing has never been under martial law. The 
imposition of martial law on nonviolent demonstrators only reveals the 
desperation of a totalitarian regime that has lost its credibility with the 
people. By a blanket news blackout order, the regime foolishly hopes that it 
can keep the truth from reaching the people of the world. A government that 
dreads exposure of its own actions is a paper tiger indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Against the opposition of such a large majority of people and even many of 
China's top leaders, it is doubtful that Li's government will survive for very 
long. Unlike most communist leaders who had participated in the Long March, in 
the war against Japan or in the the student movements against earlier regimes, 
Li does not have any political assets to draw on other than the support of 
Deng. But Deng himself has lost credibility with the people. 
</P>
<P>
To satisfy the demands of the students and the people, China needs fundamental 
economic as well as political reforms. Widespread official corruption, the root 
of popular discontent, is a product bred by a half-reformed, hybrid economic 
system that lies between the old, Stalin-type command economy and a market 
economy. Under this "two-track" system, resources are allocated through both 
the bureaucratic channels of the government and the market. The system provides 
opportunities to government officials to trade for a profit by reselling in the 
free market resources obtained from bureaucratic channels. To cure these 
economic ills, the country must resolutely move forward to a market economy. 
The economic reforms of China, however, have halted because the leadership is 
reluctant to engage in the most fundamental of the reforms -- privatization of 
state ownership, which forms the foundation of a market economy. 
</P>
<P>
It is unlikely that China's economic, social and political problems will be 
resolved if the government continues to rule in secrecy and totalitarianism. 
The people demand participation in political processes, yet the Communist Party 
has failed to deliver on its promise of political reforms toward democracy. The 
country is behind Mikhail Gorbachev's Soviet Union in allowing more freedom of 
the press and the freedom of dissenting opinions. Absolute power continues to 
concentrate in the hands of one man, Deng Xiaoping. 
</P>
<P>
Realistically, there does not exist in China an organized political force to 
replace the leadership of the Communist Party. Nor have the students advocated 
for its overthrow. For now at least, a multi-party democratic system seems a 
very remote possibility. Many people have pinned their last hope for a peaceful 
solution on Zhao Ziyang, who has been a staunch liberal reformer and has been 
sympathetic to the students. He is the only person in the top leadership who 
could conceivably work with the students to resolve the crisis and bring about 
the fundamental reforms that the Chinese people have demanded. If Li Peng 
consolidates his power, prolonged social chaos, which the country cannot 
afford, seems inevitable.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Navy is investigating the brief grounding of a nuclear-powered attack 
submarine that apparently hit a reef off the coast of San Diego, officials said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
No one was hurt in the incident, which occurred shortly after 3 p.m. Tuesday 
while the submarine, the San Diego-based Gurnard, was carrying out routine 
operations, according to Lt. Sonja Hedley, a Navy spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
The submarine apparently was undamaged, but was being closely inspected in 
port, Hedley said. She termed the incident "minor" and said it was "more of a 
bumping than a grounding." 
</P>
<P>
The 292-foot Gurnard, which carries a crew of 129 enlisted men and 15 officers, 
immediately continued on its way under its own power and needed no assistance, 
she said. It returned to port in San Diego about four hours later. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials would not say precisely where the incident occurred and refused 
to speculate on a cause. The investigation is being conducted by Rear Adm. 
David R. Oliver, commander of Submarine Group 5. 
</P>
<P>
The last time a San Diego-based submarine ran aground was in 1985, when the 
William H. Bates, also a nuclear-powered attack sub, hit bottom just off the 
coast of La Jolla.

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: CALIFORNIA CUISINE'S COOKING COMBINES CREATIVE, 
CONTEMPORARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One rarely hears California cuisine discussed these days, even though the style 
thrives under the nurturing care of some of the state's better chefs. 
</P>
<P>
The term may have died at the hands of chain-feedery executives and their 
public relations minions, who bullied it savagely. (One publicity release 
mailed by a leading San Diego firm touted a client's menu of "California 
cuisine dishes like prime rib and New York sirloin"). Thus, the term was 
frequently invoked to describe the suburban can-of-soup school of cooking, 
which jumbles ill-matched ingredients at will while praying for the best. 
</P>
<P>
One also rarely hears mention of the Hillcrest restaurant named California 
Cuisine, even though it continues to turn out thoughtful, imaginative, 
contemporary-style fare for what seems a fairly steady clientele. The 
intelligence behind the cooking reveals itself when one glances down the list 
of menu entries, which features dishes that sometimes sound fantastic but never 
implausible. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Menu Printed Daily 
</P>
<P>
Chef Chris Walsh prints the menu daily, and it recently commenced with chilled 
watermelon and lime soup and concluded with steamed halibut with tropical fruit 
and mint vinaigrette. These two dishes made intriguing brackets to a list that 
also mentioned such teasers as a shrimp tamale sauced with margarita beurre 
blanc (a creamy butter sauce flavored with lime and tequila) and charbroiled 
duck, glazed with dark rum and garnished with papaya. 
</P>
<P>
Each of these dishes was undoubtedly novel, but none seemed like the modern 
equivalent of a drugstore lunch-counter special. Real knowledge of technique is 
required by anyone who hopes to puzzle together unlikely combinations of 
ingredients into workable dishes, and such knowledge seems in generous supply 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Just as some dishes are overlaid with tone upon tone, the dining room's soft 
gray color scheme is highlighted with pastel abstract paintings and extravagant 
protea blossoms in table-top vases. The service proceeds smoothly, and it 
should be mentioned -- only because so few San Diego restaurants trouble 
themselves with this important detail -- that hot preparations arrive on hot 
plates. 
</P>
<P>
A recent menu offered so many wildly creative appetizers that the temptation 
arose to order several and call them dinner. A cream soup elaborated from 
smoked onions and sun-dried tomatoes sounded promising and proved the smash hit 
of the evening. Chocolate in color, it approached the taste buds gradually and 
tasted smoky only after the first several sips -- a really remarkable soup, it 
was velvety, sweet, deep-toned and rich, and offered more than might reasonably 
have been expected of its two main ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
Another starter was a fine example of how California and contemporary cuisine 
updates and transforms traditional dishes. The menu described the finished 
product as a "crayfish chili relleno with black bean sauce and cilantro creme 
fraiche." It was an altogether elegant and novel presentation of a time-honored 
Mexican specialty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Subtle Bean Sauce 
</P>
<P>
Because crayfish tails are now fashionable, it seemed natural enough for them 
to be included along with the traditional cheese in the filling. The pepper 
itself was battered and fried in the normal method, but, instead of the typical 
red sauce and (sometimes) sour cream garnish, the kitchen used the subtle black 
bean sauce as a reminder of the beans often used in Mexican cooking. The 
cilantro-flavored creme fraiche (a thick, cultured cream) stood in nicely for 
the sour cream. 
</P>
<P>
The menu devotes a good bit of space to elaborate salads (none of which were 
sampled, although the "Thai mosaic" with grilled scallops sounded like it had 
great potential) and to pastas, which, like so many restaurants now, California 
Cuisine treats as only incidentally Italian. The "California carbonara" proved 
one of the least interesting of the kitchen's offerings. Traditionally, this 
dish calls for spaghetti or fettuccine to be tossed with crisp bacon, beaten 
eggs and Parmesan cheese. California cuisine changed the formula only slightly 
by slipping in a bit of white sauce and some sauteed mushrooms. Other, perhaps 
better, choices were fettuccine with chicken, asparagus and cashews in brown 
butter, and linguine with shrimp, shiitake mushrooms and roasted garlic butter. 
</P>
<P>
This sense of exploration continues under the entree list, which offers such 
things as chicken breast dressed with a spicy walnut, sesame and tomato butter; 
veal chop with gingered brandy and chestnut cream, and lamb loin in a highly 
seasoned, Chinese-style plum sauce. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Real Star of Show 
</P>
<P>
The real star of the show here, however, was an outrageously beautiful grilled 
filet of Norwegian salmon, cooked somewhat on the rare side and lightly charred 
so that the moist flesh took on an intense flavor. The fish rested in a puddle 
of banana-ginger chutney, a smooth, exotic sauce that offered pleasingly 
complementary sweet and sharp accents. 
</P>
<P>
A dish of pork medallions, garnished with plump figs and doused with a mild 
Zinfandel sauce, showed how ingredients sometimes work together to make a dish 
special. A bite of pork taken with the sauce alone actually was rather bland, 
but with a bit of fig added to the mix the sauce seemed intense and the meat 
much more savory. 
</P>
<P>
When the waiter recited the list of desserts, replete with the usual chocolate 
and fruit fantasies, he also mentioned something that sounded so modest that it 
seemed out of place at California Cuisine. That fact alone meant there must be 
something interesting about the lime/poppy-seed cake in pear sauce. A rather 
dry yet tender cake, it took flavors somewhat foreign to American 
dessert-making and used them quite cleverly. The flavors were, in fact, muted 
but companionable, the pear sauce adding the necessary note of sweetness and 
the poppy seeds an elegant and very old-fashioned presence.

PLANNERS ACKNOWLEDGE MISTAKE; 
</P>
<P>
UNCORRECTED ZONING ERROR ANGERS CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jehovah's Witnesses leaders who want to sell a landmark Woodland Hills 
auditorium to an apartment developer were angered Thursday when Los Angeles 
city planners admitted that they made a mistake in drawing a zoning map for the 
site -- but refused to correct the error. 
</P>
<P>
Church officials said it may take up to a year to petition the City Council to 
remedy the confusion. They complained that by then their deal to sell the 
property and move to a larger meeting site in the Santa Clarita Valley may have 
fallen through. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an absolute outrage. They make a mistake and they won't correct it," said 
Jim Lacher, a church elder and member of the relocation committee. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is a "zoning consistency map" recently prepared by city officials to 
depict probable future land-use designations for the site at 20600 Ventura 
Blvd. Officials are being required under court order to adopt such maps 
throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
Church officials say the map was drawn without their knowledge by city planning 
staffers who incorrectly located the line separating the site's existing 
commercial and low-density residential zoning. 
</P>
<P>
The city has placed the dividing line so that there is only enough commercially 
zoned land to allow construction of about 280 to 300 apartments. 
</P>
<P>
But Lacher and other elders want the line changed so they have enough 
commercial zoning for 350 apartments. That is the number of units neighboring 
landowner Jay Wilton intends to build if he can buy the site from the church. 
</P>
<P>
Lacher declined to say how much Wilton has agreed to pay for the site or where 
in the Santa Clarita Valley the Jehovah's Witnesses intend to open a new 
4,500-seat assembly hall. 
</P>
<P>
Church leaders received the backing of city planning staff members Thursday 
when they appealed to planning commissioners to change the map. 
</P>
<P>
Although a public hearing held in April prompted planning department Hearing 
Examiner Anne Howell to recommend against changing the dividing line, Chief 
Hearing Examiner Bob Rogers told commissioners he decided to overrule Howell 
after the church asked Mayor Tom Bradley's office to intercede. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting between his staff and the mayor's last week, "more complete 
information" was obtained and it became clear that the church was correct about 
the dividing line, Rogers said. "The information we had before was erroneous." 
</P>
<P>
Planning Commission President William Luddy balked at changing the map, 
however. He said that the commission frequently has heard landowners complain 
that zoning consistency maps were inaccurate but that his panel always held 
firm because it was afraid of setting troublesome precedents by giving in. "I 
understand the pain and confusion," Luddy said. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners voted 4 to 0 not to change the map, and Luddy recommended that 
the church take its case to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Lacher said Jehovah's Witnesses may take their case to court if the delay 
causes their sale to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that Wilton will demolish the well-known 2,900-seat domed 
auditorium, built 25 years ago as the now-defunct Valley Music Theater. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing would please us more" than to sell the dome and its 8.3-acre site to 
anyone wishing to preserve it as a cultural center, Lacher said. But so far, no 
one has stepped forward.

YOUTH CHARGED WITH MURDER IN BOY'S DEATH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Murder charges were filed Thursday against a Valencia teen-ager who shot a 
13-year-old boy to death during a one-sided game of Russian roulette, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-year-old boy was charged in Sylmar Juvenile Hall with one count of 
murder in the fatal shooting Tuesday of Gabriel Soto, said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Michelle Rosenblatt. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators said the boy shot Soto once in the 
head with a large-caliber revolver at the Valencia apartment where he lived 
with his parents, who were not home at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the suspect had possession of the gun at all times during the 
game. They also said it appeared that Soto and a third boy, identified as 
14-year-old Aaron Schwartz, were reluctant participants in the game and were 
probably prevented from leaving the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the suspect first spun the chamber on the gun and aimed the 
weapon at either his own head or at one of his companions. They said the boy 
did this several times before Soto was eventually shot. 
</P>
<P>
The youth remains in custody at Sylmar Juvenile Hall and is scheduled to be 
arraigned today, Rosenblatt said. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, he could serve his sentence in the California Youth Authority 
until he is 25.

L.A. SAYS PART OF ROOF MAY HAVE TO GO; 
</P>
<P>
CONDOS' HEIGHT STILL UP IN THE AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Developers of a three-story condominium project under construction in Woodland 
Hills may have to tear off part of the roof to make the $7.5-million structure 
comply with zoning laws, Los Angeles officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But whether the building will actually have to be lowered won't be decided 
before June 6, when city planning commissioners discuss how the height should 
be measured, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The height of the 24-unit condominium project has been debated since March, 
when neighboring homeowners complained that the hilltop structure is too tall 
to meet a 45-foot height restriction imposed on the site 10 years ago by the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
But the issue became clouded when it was learned that recent changes to the 
city's zoning code may have authorized a 75-foot height at the Ventura 
Boulevard construction site. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Case Reviewed 
</P>
<P>
Franklin P. Eberhard, the city's chief zoning administrator, reviewed the case 
at the request of Woodland Hills-area City Councilman Marvin Braude and 
concluded this week that the 45-foot limitation is in effect. 
</P>
<P>
However, Eberhard rejected homeowners' contention that the building is also 
being constructed too close to the site's southern property line. 
</P>
<P>
Residents have complained that several lofts atop the condominium building 
exceed the 45-foot limit by as much as two feet. Homeowners said they 
calculated the excess height by visually inspecting the project and estimating 
the distance from the ground to the rooftop. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowner leader Sid Perry said Thursday that he feels the whole building may 
also have to be lowered by 1 1/2 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear to us that it's over-height all the way across," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Development partner Ed Dade has rejected the residents' height complaint. He 
has suggested that any over-height lofts can be converted into legal skylights 
with the removal of their floors. The project is about three-fourths completed. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Miscikowski, Braude's chief deputy, Thursday predicted that the issue 
will remain up in the air until the commission steps in to resolve it by 
formally ruling on Eberhard's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Included among his suggestions are ideas as to how the city should measure the 
height. Eberhard concludes that the proper way to do that is to measure from 
the finished ground next to the building -- not from the site's natural grade 
before construction began or from the tops of artificial berms or planters.

CLAREMONT TRIES TO STOP SUBURBAN SPRAWL; 
</P>
<P>
'BOLD PURCHASE' AIMED AT SAVING HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Claremont city officials demonstrated recently that they are willing to put 
their money -- more than $13 million, in fact -- behind a pledge to save the 
slopes north of the city from suburban sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council unanimously approved a letter of intent to buy 1,345 acres of 
rustic hillside land from a group of owners, the largest of which is Pomona 
College. After taking title, Claremont will annex the property, which 
constitutes almost half of the unincorporated area within the city's sphere of 
influence and includes the historic Padua Hills Theater. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Glenn Southard said the city plans to recoup the purchase cost -- 
between $13 million and $18 million, depending on when escrow closes during the 
next three years -- by selling off about 145 acres in the lower foothills to 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder, "an area larger than Central Park in New York City," will be 
designated as permanent open space. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase is the culmination of a decade-long effort by Claremont leaders to 
extend city control over development into the foothills. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a pretty big step for us," Southard said. "I don't think we're the 
first town to preserve the hillsides." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "I think for a town the size of Claremont, this is a very bold 
purchase." 
</P>
<P>
Ted Gibbens, Pomona College's vice president for development, said the limited 
partnership that owns the property had not originally intended to sell the land 
to the city. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't necessarily the transaction we sought," Gibbens said. "Some of the 
directors were uncomfortable about the risk involved in the project for the 
city. But the city is a very determined buyer, and there's no doubt that we're 
pleased about the prospect that the hillsides will be protected." 
</P>
<P>
However, the purchase does not please some residents of neighboring 
unincorporated areas. To them, the planned purchase raises the threat of a 
"hostile takeover" of their neighborhoods. They contend that it is a ploy by 
the city to pave the way for annexation, which they claim is opposed by 70% of 
foothill residents. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have made no secret of their desire to annex the unincorporated 
foothills. In recent months, Councilwomen Judy Wright and Diann Ring have met 
with residents, seeking to convince them of the advantages of being in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
"The city has not been able to capture the hearts and minds of the people in 
the county areas, so they have bought up all the land surrounding them," said 
George Keeler, co-founder of Hillside Environment and Land Protection (HELP), a 
group of about 100 foothill homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
Keeler said residents' anti-annexation sentiment is rooted in their desire to 
preserve their bucolic life style and avoid the "persnickety regulations" 
imposed by city government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Costly Move 
</P>
<P>
They also worry that joining Claremont would be a costly move, specifically 
because the city would hook their homes up to its sewer system and bill them 
for the cost through assessment districts. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make sure that we don't have a hostile takeover and that, if you're 
annexed, it's because you want to be," said Janet Myhre, another founding 
member of HELP. 
</P>
<P>
However, the city's annexation of the 1,345 acres it is purchasing would not 
necessarily make it easier to annex adjoining areas, according to Michi 
Takahashi, an administrative assistant with the county Local Agency Formation 
Commission (LAFCO), which must approve all annexations. 
</P>
<P>
In areas with more than 12 homeowners, annexation cannot take place if 50% or 
more of the registered voters file written protests. If 25% or more protest, 
annexation must be approved by residents at the polls, Takahashi said. 
</P>
<P>
Southard said he believes Claremont's plans to designate such a large parcel as 
open space should help prove the city's sincerity to residents. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope they'll take this as a sign that we're serious about hillside 
preservation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Keeler said that, as far as his group is concerned, the jury's still out on the 
city's stated efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that if the city holds to its word, there will be hillside 
preservation," he said. "But there's a problem of trust between the county 
residents and the city." 
</P>
<P>
County residents worry about the density of development the city will permit on 
the land it plans to sell off. Myhre said she is concerned the city might allow 
as many as six homes per acre in the areas slated for development. These 
development "clusters" would be near existing rural neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if we aren't annexed and the cluster building goes on, it will change the 
quality of life," said Myhre, who lives in Padua Hills. "We live on a quiet 
street. It won't be a quiet street anymore. They're sacrificing our 
neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
Southard said the city has not determined the density to be permitted in the 
145 acres designated for development, but said it probably will be less than 
two units per acre. 
</P>
<P>
As for the remaining land, Southard said, restrictions will be placed on the 
deed, requiring the property to be maintained as open space. Keeler said his 
group is concerned that the deed restrictions might contain loopholes that 
could be challenged in court. 
</P>
<P>
Keeler and Myhre also questioned whether the city might not be able to recoup 
the cost of the purchase and speculated that officials might have to allow 
developers higher densities to get an adequate price for the land. 
</P>
<P>
Southard said such a prospect is "possible, but not probable." Gibbens said the 
city paid market price for the buildable portion of the land. The remainder, 
which was not prized by developers because of environmental restrictions on 
construction, was essentially a gift to the city, he said.

JIM MURRAY: HE'S FOLLOWING DAD BUT WANTS TO PASS HIM

<P>
It is the fondest wish of most fathers that sons follow in their footsteps, 
take over the family business, maintain the tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Few do. Ministers' sons often become world-class playboys or tango dancers. 
</P>
<P>
Parents try everything. Take the boy down and show him the family factory, the 
office with the rug on the floor, promise him the good life. "Some day, son, 
all this can be yours," they whisper seductively. He can, they assure him, have 
an expense account, condos in Florida, a yacht, he can be a pillar of the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't want it. He may even run off to join the circus. He'll sell the 
family business to the first corporate raider and go off to the south of France 
and play baccarat the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
Great authors and painters never seem to replicate themselves. You don't find 
any Hemingways on the best-seller lists. Only one Rembrandt hangs in the 
Louvre. 
</P>
<P>
There aren't any Ty Cobb Jrs. on the base paths, Jack Dempsey III's in a ring. 
</P>
<P>
But, then, it comes to auto racing, and the older generation can't keep away 
the younger generation with a club. 
</P>
<P>
It's boggling. You close your eyes and imagine a father taking his son to the 
nearest grease-filled garage with gaskets all over the floor, a naked girl on a 
calendar, more drain oil than West Texas, a pile of retreads. "Some day, son, 
all this can be yours," he tells him, waving his arms over the mess. The kid is 
thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
Then, he takes him out to the nearest dirt-track or high-speed oval and says: 
"Just think, some day you can break an arm or shatter an ankle here. You can 
burn, crash, get heat prostration. The possibilities are limitless. When you're 
not in a race car, you're in an airplane. Raises hell with your home life. 
You'll get bored doing anything under 200 miles an hour. You'll be breathing 
methane for the rest of your life." 
</P>
<P>
And the kid can't believe his good luck. 
</P>
<P>
There's no love affair in the world that can match one between a young racer 
and his car. Not Romeo and Juliet, Camille and Alfredo, Scarlett and Rhett. 
It's more than a romance, it's an obsession. 
</P>
<P>
Young Al Unser is the prototype of the breed but not the only one. There's a 
grandson of a race driver who is the son of a race driver in here. This sport 
deals in royal families. Billy Vukovich's grandfather died on this race track 
at Indianapolis before he was born. He is Billy Vukovich the Third. His 
grandfather won this race twice before he was killed. His father drove it 12 
times. Gary Bettenhausen's father died here. Al Unser's uncle died here. You'd 
think they'd rather go in a haunted house than to the Indianapolis Motor 
Speedway. You'd think the sight of a turbo-charged race car would make them 
turn white and cross themselves. Guess again. 
</P>
<P>
Al Unser Jr. is a deceptively-mild-appearing young man, freckled, dimpled. He 
doesn't really look like an Unser. But he drives like one. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't get in a race car till he was well up in age -- 9. For an Unser, 
that's practically in his dotage. Unsers usually go directly from the cradle to 
a cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
Little Al's father, Big Al, put him in a go-cart when he was big enough to see 
over a dashboard. After that, he was pretty much on his own. The Unsers are not 
big on sharing secrets. "My father taught me everything I know," Little Al 
concedes. "But he didn't teach me everything he knows." 
</P>
<P>
Why do the sons and grandsons of drivers follow in the family business while 
chain-store magnates can't bribe their spoiled brats to show up for work? 
</P>
<P>
"It's addictive," Al Unser the Younger explains. "It's hard to explain the 
excitement." It is, he adds, a feeling that you are more alive, more alert, 
more challenged in a race car than you will ever be again. The rest of life is 
vanilla ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
Wouldn't his family rather he be a lawyer, an accountant? "I went to work in a 
machine shop when I was 16," young Al reveals. "I worked eight hours a day, 
five days a week. On the weekends, I was very glad to go racing." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, an Unser out of a race car is like a camel out of sand, a cowboy off 
a horse. John Wayne in a three-piece suit. Legend has it Unsers don't come 
equipped with heart, lungs and bloodstreams like the rest of us. They have 
cylinders, fuel pumps and they bleed petroleum. If you check an Unser, you find 
a tachometer. In a few more generations, they'll be born with tires. 
</P>
<P>
Is it likely they'll have to be numbered like popes or English kings or Super 
Bowls? 
</P>
<P>
As the scion of a family that has won seven Indy 500s and on a track on which 
his uncle, Jerry, died in practice, does he feel any pressure to excel? 
</P>
<P>
"The public may feel I don't have my own identity," young Al concedes. "But 
when you're in a race car, your name won't help you." 
</P>
<P>
Are his loyalties split? Will he be rooting for his father to win his 
unprecedented fifth Indy? "I will be rooting for me to win my first before I 
want him to win his fifth," Al Two insists. 
</P>
<P>
Is he gaining on his father? Can he break the family tradition and impart 
secrets? "A 27-year-old cannot teach a 50-year-old anything," young Al claims, 
endearing himself to a whole generation of father-knows-bests. 
</P>
<P>
"Me and Dad talk a lot. But, you have to understand the Unser family is very 
competitive within themselves." In other words, if you're an Unser, you learn, 
crash-by-crash. 
</P>
<P>
He's had five trips around this race track in the 500 now. Will he not feel 
like an Unser till he wins the race? "I wouldn't feel like an Unser if I 
weren't in the race." 
</P>
<P>
Except that Unsers get in Victory Lane as well as the starting grid. Victory 
Lane is like Buckingham Palace, the ruling family's ancestral home. Being a 
racer is getting to be like being a Hohenzollern. You reign by divine right. 
The Indy 500 museum is going to become like Westminster Abbey, the resting 
place for a few monarchical families. And, the father whose son won't take over 
the garment industry can only look on in envy. He's facing a losing battle. You 
can't get killed selling dresses. So, who wants to spend his life doing that?

MORNING BRIEFING: TAKING THE AIR OUT OF JORDAN HUBBUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Basketball Assn. playoffs have inspired a lot of Jordan vs. Magic 
columns. But how about Michael Jordan vs. Akeem Olajuwon, the man (along with 
Sam Bowie, but that's another story) drafted ahead of Magic's Air Apparent? 
</P>
<P>
The first instinct, of course, is to declaim the chowderheads who let Jordan 
pass on down to the Chicago Bulls in that 1984 draft. But Tony Kornheiser of 
the Washington Post has come up with some numbers that suggest the pick was not 
all that foolish. 
</P>
<P>
He points out that Houston was 29-53 the year before Olajuwon but that within 
two seasons the Rockets won 51 games and reached the NBA finals. Chicago was 
27-55 before Jordan and didn't get over .500 until his fourth season and is 
still working on that NBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Jordan," Kornheiser wrote, "hasn't won anything yet but the scoring title." 
</P>
<P>
Further: "Giving Jordan a great center to work with wouldn't have improved 
Chicago as much as giving Olajuwon a great point guard would improve the 
Rockets." 
</P>
<P>
Problem is, he gets out: Iran Barkley is preparing for his Aug. 14 fight with 
middleweight champion Michael Nunn as does any other boxer these days: He's 
going to jail. That is, he plans to spar with inmates at Rikers Island over the 
next couple of weeks before opening training camp in California. The idea is to 
get meaner. "My whole purpose is to get into the mood to kill people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tubular, Bob: That fight, incidentally, will be held in Reno, away from Nunn's 
constituency in Los Angeles, where he has fought the most. Reasons promoter Bob 
Arum: "All those Nunn fans, where do you think they'll be on Aug. 14? On the 
beach in Malibu. They're not going to go to the fight when they can sit back, 
smoke some grass and watch it on HBO." 
</P>
<P>
How sweet it is: Ken Griffey Jr. may not have Reggie Jackson's numbers yet but 
at least Seattle's rookie outfielder didn't have to wait until he got to New 
York for somebody to put out a candy bar with his name on it. 
</P>
<P>
The Ken Griffey Jr. candy bar came out in Seattle stores on May 17 and the 
entire production was sold out two days later. 
</P>
<P>
High-fives for a full count: Rich Donnelly, a coach for the Pirates, remembers 
hard times in the minors. "I managed a team that was so bad we considered a 
2-and-0 count on the batter a rally." 
</P>
<P>
They called him Catfish Morgan then: The Dodgers' Mike Morgan was a Charles 
Finley creation 11 years ago when the Oakland A's owner put the youngster into 
the starting rotation right out of high school. Said Morgan: "Oakland was 
struggling for attendance then. I had nothing to lose, everything to gain. I 
gained a lot of losses." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, 3-2 with the National League's best ERA so far this season, lost his 
only three decisions for Finley and was sent to the minors. The next season he 
lost his first six starts before winning and has been, up until this year, the 
pitcher with the worst record (34-68) in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What winning Indianapolis 500 driver made the most pit stops? The 
fewest? 
</P>
<P>
More annals of boxing: Buddy McGirt, who recently lost a junior welterweight 
title, is frustrated by his new invisibility. "Mike Tyson gets a speeding 
ticket and it's news. I had three speeding tickets and no one wrote about 
that." 
</P>
<P>
It's not that simple, Buddy. In all fairness, c'mon. Tyson's were acquired in 
two weeks. It took McGirt a year. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Bobby Unser made 11 stops in 1975. Johnny Rutherford made four 
in the rain-shortened 1976 race. Such records were first kept in 1923. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Lesley Visser, who along with other female sportswriters had to 
battle for years to be admitted to locker rooms for postgame interviews, said 
this when she was finally inside the smelly, cramped quarters of the Boston 
Garden: "We fought for the right to get in here?"

Brian Garrow promised himself that he was going to have more fun at this year's 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. tennis championships, but early Thursday 
morning it didn't look that way. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 1 player from UCLA, who reached the singles final at this event a year 
ago, was facing elimination in the second round against unseeded Greg Failla of 
USC. 
</P>
<P>
Failla had won the first set, 7-5, and held two match points in the second 
against his Pacific 10 Conference rival, whom he had beaten in their last 
meeting. But Garrow fought off both match points, took the second set, 7-5, and 
then went on to win the third set, 6-0, to advance to today's quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Garrow will play Georgia's Francisco Montana, who upset top-seeded MaliVai 
Washington of Michigan in the first round and took three sets to defeat Vince 
Van Gelderen of Clemson on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Eisenman of California and Kip Brady of UC Santa Barbara pulled off the 
upsets of the day against the No. 2 and No. 6 players, respectively, leaving 
the tournament without its top six seeded players. 
</P>
<P>
Eisenman needed to win a second-set tiebreaker to take a 3-6, 7-6 (7-3), 6-3 
marathon over No. 2 Mike Brown of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
Brady also lost his first set but came back to win over sixth-seeded Adam Malik 
of Kentucky, 5-7, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
In other singles matches Thursday, Trevor Kronemann of UC Irvine advanced to 
the quarterfinals with a 6-2, 6-4 victory over Clint Banducci, Texas 
Christian's No. 1 player. Bryon Black of USC also advanced with a 7-5, 6-4 
victory over Brian Devening of Southern Methodist. 
</P>
<P>
Falling out of the tournament Thursday were Buff Farrow of UCLA, who was upset 
by Steven Jung of Nebraska, 6-4, 6-2, and Eric Amend of USC, who lost Clemson's 
John Sullivan, 6-1, 6-4. Jung is from Hacienda Heights. 
</P>
<P>
Doubles play began Thursday and, as expected, top-seeded Garrow and Gailbraith 
easily advanced past Mario Pacheco and Ged Schwing of Louisiana State, 6-1, 
6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Both of Irvine's doubles teams advanced as Mike Briggs and Trevor Kronemann 
beat Jamie Booras and Dave Randall of Mississippi, 6-4, 6-4, and Mike Kaplan 
and Richard Lubner beat Jeff Neuman and Jack Solerno of Oklahoma State, 6-3, 
7-5.

Chris Evert withdrew from next week's French Open, which she has won a record 
seven times, saying Thursday her heart isn't in her tennis. 
</P>
<P>
Evert, 34, left in doubt whether she will play at Wimbledon and if her career 
might be over. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to go home and evaluate what I'm going to do," Evert said from 
Geneva, Switzerland, where she lost Wednesday to 19-year-old Austrian Barbara 
Paulus in the European Open. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now I don't have the heart to stay out there and fight all day," Evert 
said in a statement. "I just want to plan my schedule one week at a time." 
</P>
<P>
Evert's agent, Bob Cain, said she will "decide over the next week to 10 days 
whether she will play Wimbledon." 
</P>
<P>
Evert has won Wimbledon three times, the U.S. Open six times and the Australian 
Open twice. Wimbledon starts June 26. 
</P>
<P>
The United States defeated Spain, 2-1, and West Germany beat Switzerland, 2-1, 
in the $900,000 World Team Cup at Dusseldorf, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Javier Sanchez gave Spain a 1-0 advantage by defeating Tim Mayotte, 3-6, 6-0, 
7-6 (7-4), but Aaron Krickstein got the United States even with a 7-6 (7-4), 
1-6, 6-3 victory over Jordi Arrese. In doubles, Rick Leach and Jim Pugh beat 
Sanchez and Sergio Casal, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Third-seeded Manuela Maleeva of Bulgaria scored a 6-1, 6-0 victory over Beverly 
Bowes and advanced to the quarterfinals of the European Open at Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
Maleeva plays today against Elise Burgin, who gained the quarterfinals by 
defeating Celine Cohen of Switzerland, 6-4, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
In other matches, Belinda Cordwell of New Zealand defeated Camille Benjamin, 
6-2, 2-6, 7-6 (7-5), and Laura Garrone of Italy defeated Shaun Stafford, 6-0, 
6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Andres Gomez of Ecuador outlasted Francesco Cancellotti of Italy, 
7-5, 7-6 (8-6), and reached the quarterfinals of a tournament at Florence, 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
In other matches, fourth-seeded Eduardo Bengoechea of Argentina beat Francesco 
Clavet of Spain, 6-3, 2-6, 6-3; sixth-seeded Horacio De La Pena of Argentina 
downed Roberto Azar, also of Argentina, 6-1, 7-6 (9-7), and Thierry Tulasne of 
France defeated Nuno Marques of Portugal, 6-3, 6-2.

Defensive end Bob Buczkowski, a one-time first-round draft pick whose career 
has been hampered by injury and illness, signed as a free agent Thursday with 
the San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
Buczkowski, a 6-foot-5, 265-pound defensive end, was out of football last 
season after being released by the Raiders during the 1988 exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
He was a first-round draft choice of the Raiders in 1986 and the 24th player 
selected overall. 
</P>
<P>
A standout at Pittsburgh, where he was named defensive player of the year as a 
senior, Buczkowski was sidelined by a back injury during his rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
He played only two games in 1987 because of a bout with hepatitis and injuries.

NEWSWIRE: 3 SOVIET STARS ARE FREE TO PLAY FOR NHL CLUBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet hockey stars Vyacheslav Fetisov, Igor Larionov and Sergei Makarov will 
be allowed to play in the National Hockey League, the Soviet official news 
agency Tass reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement that the three were released from the Red Army -- whose hockey 
team they represent in the Soviet league -- was made Wednesday and ended months 
of speculation. All were members of the team that won the World Championships 
in Stockholm this month. 
</P>
<P>
Tass did not refer to the disputes in its terse announcement that the three 
were let go "owing to reduction of staff" in the Red Army and "are now free to 
sign contracts with NHL or any other foreign clubs." 
</P>
<P>
Last year Larionov spoke out against the methods of national team coach Viktor 
Tikhonov. 
</P>
<P>
And Fetisov quit after an argument with Tikhonov over the treatment of players. 
The two patched up their differences before the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
The New Jersey Devils have contract rights to Fetisov, the Vancouver Canucks to 
Larionov and the Calgary Flames to Makarov.

Jon Peters, who set the national high school record of 51 consecutive victories 
last month, lost his first game as a scholastic pitcher Thursday night when 
West Orange-Stark no-hit his Brenham team, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
Peters, who is 53-1 in his career at Brenham, remained two short of the Texas 
record for career victories as West Orange-Stark evened the best-of-three Class 
4A regional semifinal playoff series. Brenham won, 5-2, on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Brenham (27-2) has won an unprecedented three consecutive Class 4A titles. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was the first in 12 decisions this season for Peters, who struck out 
eight. 
</P>
<P>
Peters' wild pitch scored Kevin Smith from third base in the second inning and 
he allowed two more runs in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
On April 28, Peters broke the record of 50 consecutive wins held by Timmy Moore 
of McColl, S.C. Moore set the record in 1977-80, but he didn't know he had a 
national record until last year when Peters' streak was publicized nationally. 
</P>
<P>
Peters' last defeat came when Brenham lost to Taiwan in the semifinals of the 
1985 Little League World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Peters had a 13-0 record as a freshman, 15-0 as a sophomore and 14-0 last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Texas state high school record for total career victories is 55 by 
Duncanville's Keith Creel from 1974-77. 
</P>
<P>
The national high school record for career victories is 61 by Steve Streater, 
of Sylva Webster, N.C. from 1974-1977.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
BREWERS FINALLY CATCH UP TO STEWART AND BEAT A'S, 4-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dave Stewart has been tough on the rest of the American League during his 
career, but until Thursday he'd been downright unbeatable against the Milwaukee 
Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart carried a 9-0 record into the game at Milwaukee, the only American 
League team never to defeat the Oakland Athletics' two-time 20-game winner. 
</P>
<P>
"When a guy beats you that many times, you're certainly aware of it," Robin 
Yount said after driving in the go-ahead run in a 4-1 victory over Stewart and 
the A's. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart allowed nine hits, including five doubles, in 7 1/3 innings as his 
record fell to 8-2. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee starter Bryan Clutterbuck (2-1) allowed a first-inning homer to Dave 
Parker but gave up just three more hits before his shoulder stiffened after six 
innings. After the game, Clutterbuck said he was OK. Dan Plesac got the final 
four outs for his ninth save. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was Milwaukee's victory its first over Stewart, but the Brewers took a 
series from the Athletics for the first time since July, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee scored a run against Stewart in the third inning and added another in 
the fifth, when Yount doubled home Bill Spiers. The Brewers picked up two more 
runs in the eighth on consecutive doubles by Rob Deer, Glenn Braggs and Terry 
Francona. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 10, Seattle 0 -- Mike Smithson pitched his first shutout since 1986 and 
Mike Greenwell had four hits and four RBIs as the Red Sox completed a 
three-game sweep at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Smithson (2-3) allowed only two runners to reach third base. He gave up eight 
hits, struck out six and walked two in his fifth career shutout and first 
complete game in four starts this season. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwell singled in a run in the first inning and hit a three-run double in 
the second as the Red Sox capitalized on two Seattle errors for five unearned 
runs off Mike Dunne (1-3). Greenwell also singled in the sixth and seventh for 
his fifth career four-hit game. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 9, Cleveland 5 -- The Tigers had a season-high nine extra-base hits at 
Detroit, including six doubles, to beat the Indians for the third consecutive 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Tanana (4-4) pitched the first six innings for Detroit, giving up four 
runs and nine hits while striking out seven. Frank Williams took over and 
pitched into the ninth, with Guillermo Hernandez getting the last out. 
</P>
<P>
Lou Whitaker hit his 11th homer for the Tigers.

SIMONS SAY;

<P>
DICK SIMON CALLS SHOTS FOR BRAYTON; HIS WIFE, DIANNE SIMON, FOR LUYENDYK 
</P>

<P>
When Dick Simon decided to retire as a race car driver and become a car owner 
and team manager, he didn't go half way. 
</P>
<P>
He signed two drivers, Arie Luyendyk and Scott Brayton, to drive a pair of 1989 
Lolas, but he complicated his problems by using two engines, a Cosworth V-8 for 
Luyendyk and a turbocharged stock block Buick for Brayton. 
</P>
<P>
As far as running the team on race day Sunday, however, he's keeping things in 
the family. 
</P>
<P>
Simon, 55, a veteran of 17 starts in the Indianapolis 500, will be in Brayton's 
pits, and his wife, Dianne, will be making the decisions for Luyendyk. 
</P>
<P>
"She was around helping run the team all the time I was driving, so she knows 
as much or more than anyone else I could find," Simon said of the unusual 
arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
But Simon has always had unusual arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
A former ski jumping and parachute jumping champion, he did not take up racing 
Indy cars until he was 36, but once in it he set records for perseverance by 
running 183 races without a victory. 
</P>
<P>
He also was the one who guided Janet Guthrie in her goal to become the first, 
and still the only, woman to qualify for the Indy 500. 
</P>
<P>
And last year at age 54, he extended his own record as the oldest driver in the 
500. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I'd miss driving, but I haven't, not a bit," he said. "I've had so 
much satisfaction in working with Arie and Scotty that I haven't had time to 
think about driving myself." 
</P>
<P>
Both Luyendyk and Brayton came to Simon this season after unhappy experiences 
with other teams. 
</P>
<P>
"Dick is an exceptional car owner," Brayton said Thursday after the team put 
its cars through their final paces during carburetion day. "Having Dick running 
the team gives Arie and I an added edge because he's been in the seat himself. 
When we come in and tell him how the car felt, how it was reacting at different 
places on the track, he can understand. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, I would come in and tell my crew chief that something was wrong and 
either he didn't believe me, or he had a blank look on his face." 
</P>
<P>
Simon says that he often knows before his driver gets his helmet off how the 
car is running. 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell from the look in their eyes. If he's had a scare, or the car's not 
handling right, the fire's still there when he comes into the pits. If the 
car's been handling right, there's always a smile in their eyes when they come 
in." 
</P>
<P>
Both of Simon's engine programs are factory backed, and factory engineers do 
all the dyno testing and development, so all Simon's crew has to do is bolt 
them in the Lolas. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a good deal from our standpoint," Simon says. "I remember when I 
used to take my screwdriver or my wrench and make my own changes on the engine. 
Now it's all done electronically, by computer, and the engineers take care of 
it. It's just another example of how technology is taking over racing and 
eliminating a lot of the human element. 
</P>
<P>
"But that doesn't mean we don't have enough problems. Take this week. We were 
quite pleased after qualifying to have Scotty (Brayton) in the second row and 
then we came out Tuesday and found the fuel cell was leaking. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't just go out and find a fuel cell to fit an Indy car. We had to 
contact Lola in England and they said they would send one over with the tub 
from Jim Crawford's car. But when the tub arrived in Chicago Wednesday night, 
it didn't need to clear customs because it had originated in the States but the 
fuel cell had to go through customs. That meant we had to send a guy up to 
O'Hare (Airport) just to take care of it. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time the crew got it, it was close to midnight. They worked until about 
4 in the morning and then went home for a couple hours sleep and then came back 
to the track. It's been that kind of a year for us. We blew a couple of 
engines, had gear boxes break and had to patch up the car after something broke 
and Brayton hit the wall. 
</P>
<P>
"But the way the two cars ran today, we're looking forward to the race." 
</P>
<P>
In the final workout before Sunday, Luyendyk and Brayton both ran 216 m.p.h. 
Only four drivers were faster, the fastest being 217.407 by Al Unser. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a great feeling about the race because of the way the car handled on a 
full load (of methanol fuel)," Luyendyk said. "It also handles real well in 
traffic and that's extra important in those first few laps when the turbulence 
from all the other cars can really throw your car off." 
</P>
<P>
Brayton knows that all too well. 
</P>
<P>
In last year's race, Brayton hit the second turn wall on the first lap when 
traffic was still heavy and when the car spun, it collected Roberto Guerrero's 
car, too. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the lowest point in my career," Brayton said. "The worst thing is that 
my team never explained what happened. They had some snap-on tabs on the wing 
that apparently weren't on tight and after I got through the first turn, the 
turbulence kicked them off going down the short chute. 
</P>
<P>
"When I tried to turn, it just went, 'boom,' into the wall and when it came 
around I was looking at Guerrero." 
</P>
<P>
Simon likened it to trying to land an airplane without a tail and rudder. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't do anything about it when it's that way," Simon said.

ALL CRAWFORD'S MEN PUT HIS CAR TOGETHER AGAIN

Jim Crawford will not have to move to the back of the field for the start of 
Sunday's Indianapolis 500, thanks to a major effort to repair his car by the 
Lola factory in England and an equally major effort putting it back together by 
his crew here. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford qualified the Lola-Buick fourth, at 221.450 m.p.h., then crashed in a 
practice session last Friday when a part of his suspension broke. 
</P>
<P>
Damage was extensive but if Crawford had switched to his backup car, he would 
have had to qualify it, accepting a poorer starting spot, or move to the 33rd 
spot without qualifying it. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Kenny Bernstein, a former drag racer, chose to get it repaired. He sent 
the car's main component, the tub, back to the factory, where it was fixed, 
then shipped back to the United States. It arrived at Crawford's garage at 9 
p.m. Wednesday and Crawford's crew spent the rest of the night making it a race 
car again, borrowing liberally from the backup. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford drove it Thursday in the final practice session before the race, as 
required by the rules, and proclaimed himself satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very nearly perfect," he said. "I went 215 with a full tank, so it 
can't be too bad." 
</P>
<P>
The car left a little to be desired aesthetically, though. The repaired tub was 
left unpainted -- dull black fiberglass, which contrasted strikingly with the 
shiny red, white and yellow of the engine cowling and wings -- but carried the 
usual complement of decals. 
</P>
<P>
The great Andretti-Unser feud apparently is over, without bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
In the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach last month, Al Unser Jr. ran into Mario 
Andretti as they dueled for the lead late in the race, knocking Andretti's car 
out of commission. 
</P>
<P>
Unser continued and won the race, after which an angry Andretti accused him of 
careless driving at best, and calculated opportunism at worst. Andretti, in 
fact, wanted a piece of Unser immediately after the race and had to be 
restrained. 
</P>
<P>
A chagrined Unser sort of admitted to sloppy driving but denied any 
purposefulness and said that when Andretti cooled off, he would try to set 
things right. 
</P>
<P>
Said Little Al the other day: "I went to Nazareth (Pa., Andretti's hometown) 
for the IROC (series) race and went to see Mario. Whatever there was to be 
squared away was squared away." 
</P>
<P>
Andretti has not been discussing the situation but his publicity people put out 
a release earlier this month, saying that all is well between the two, and 
spokesmen for both drivers said that Unser's visit to Andretti's home was a 
cordial one and that there were no lingering hard feelings. 
</P>
<P>
Drivers like to impress people with the difficulty of their jobs in this age of 
high-tech racing, but Kevin Cogan maintains that high tech has made the driver 
something of a supernumerary. 
</P>
<P>
"The driver is almost a dyno," he said, referring to a dynamometer, an 
engine-testing machine. "You just put your foot down and hold it down." 
</P>
<P>
Cogan's teammate, Rich Vogler, on safety at more than 200 m.p.h.: "The race 
cars are as safe as they can be and as a driver, I do my part about keeping 
safe. And yet, can you say a race car is really safe? If you hit the wall at 
200 m.p.h.? I don't think about that." 
</P>
<P>
Vogler, again, on his familiarity with the 2 1/2-mile Speedway track: "I know 
there's four or five corners here, or however many there are." 
</P>
<P>
How has the repaving of the track affected drivers' capabilities to actually 
race? Take your pick from the thoughts of two former winners. 
</P>
<P>
Said Gordon Johncock, who won at Indy in 1973 and again in '82: "You can pass 
now. It's not a one-groove track, like it usually is." 
</P>
<P>
Contradicted Danny Sullivan, the 1985 winner: "It's very hard to pass anyone. 
The track is a lot smoother, but it's still a one-groove track."

LMU TO FACE OKLAHOMA IN REGIONALS 
</P>

<P>
Picture this: Dave Snow, who took Loyola Marymount to two baseball regionals, 
and Chris Smith, who was Snow's right-hand man, square off in Tucson with the 
winner advancing to the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
It could happen. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola (37-22) will make its third appearance in four years in the National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. baseball regionals today at noon at the University of 
Arizona against high-scoring Oklahoma (43-17). 
</P>
<P>
Other opening-round games at Arizona's Sancet Field are Cal State Long Beach 
(46-13) vs. Hawaii (40-25) at 4:30 p.m. and host Arizona (43-16) vs. Eastern 
Kentucky (38-17) at 7:30 p.m. This is one of eight six-team regionals 
nationwide. The eight regional winners advance to Omaha for next week's World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
Snow coached Loyola to regional berths in 1986 and last year. Now he leads Long 
Beach, and his friend and protege, Smith, is at the Lions' helm. If the teams 
play the way they're seeded, No. 1 Arizona should face Oklahoma for the 
regional title. But this appears to be a competitive bracket, and with a double 
elimination format nearly any combination is possible. That raises the chance 
that Loyola and Long Beach might reach a position where one has to eliminate 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
"That is a little unfortunate," Smith said. "I want to win it, but if we don't 
I would like to see (Snow) win it." On the other hand, business is business. 
"At least we're familiar with them," Smith noted. "We played them four times 
and beat them the last two." 
</P>
<P>
The Lions and Pepperdine, the West Coast Athletic Conference's representatives, 
appeared to get little respect from those seeding the teams. Pepperdine, the 
WCAC champion, was seeded fourth at Fresno. Loyola is seeded fifth at Arizona. 
"I was a little surprised that we were fifth behind Hawaii," Smith said. "But 
it doesn't really make much difference." 
</P>
<P>
On paper, the matchup of Loyola vs. Oklahoma appears to be a slugfest, with 
Oklahoma carrying a .336 average and scoring more than nine runs per game and 
Loyola hitting .316 and scoring seven per game. The Lions have an earned-run 
average of 4.14 while the Sooners' is a generous 5.59. Sancet Field is 360 feet 
down the lines but 400 feet in the power alleys and dead center. However, if 
the weather is hot the ball carries well in Tucson. "It's a good hitter's park. 
The ball's gonna fly," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions will probably open with left-hander Steve Surico (7-5 with a 4.90 
ERA) or lefty Jon Willard (2-0, 2.84 ERA), who has been the Lions' best pitcher 
lately and may be able to nullify some of the Sooners' left-handed power. Top 
winner Kalani Bush (10-2, 3.50) is also a possibility. Oklahoma will probably 
start left-hander Kevin King (8-3, 5.09) but could go with right-hander Jim 
Huslig (8-2, 3.91), who recently threw the Sooners' first no-hitter in nine 
years, against Old Dominion. 
</P>
<P>
If the Lions win today, they play in the winners bracket at 7:30 p.m. Saturday. 
If they lose their opener, they play in the losers bracket at noon Saturday.

<P>
LIONS' BACKUP CATCHER VALUES TEAM FRIENDSHIPS MORE THAN PLAYING TIME AS HE 
TAKES THIRD TRIP TO NCAA TOURNAMENT 
</P>

Mark Grafitti is preparing for a journey into familiar territory. For the third 
time in his four years at Loyola Marymount, Grafitti and the Lions are in the 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. baseball tournament. And just as he has done 
in his previous two trips into postseason play, Grafitti will begin the 
tournament from a familiar vantage point -- the Loyola bench. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't had a three-year All-American career, but the friendships I've 
developed and the experiences I've had with the team have been great," said 
Grafitti, a backup catcher and first baseman who played at Hoover High. "I've 
been lucky enough to go through something 99% of the people in the world never 
get to experience." 
</P>
<P>
Grafitti graduated from Loyola two weeks ago with a degree in psychology. So, 
it's not surprising that throughout his collegiate baseball career, Grafitti 
has relied on the power of positive thinking to help overcome what some players 
might view as a series of major league disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who plays wants to be the guy to throw out the runner or hit the home 
run," Grafitti said. "But if you want to be part of a team, you do what you 
have to do. 
</P>
<P>
"Someday, you'll get your chance and you just gotta hope you make the best of 
your chance when you get it." 
</P>
<P>
In this, his final season, Graffiti is hoping for an opportunity to help Loyola 
win its first national title when the Lions open play Friday against Oklahoma 
in the West I Regional in Tucson, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola (37-22), under first-year Coach Chris Smith, is ranked 18th and 24th, 
respectively, in this week's Baseball America and Collegiate Baseball-ESPN 
polls. 
</P>
<P>
Grafitti, 6-foot-2, 185 pounds, made the Loyola roster as a walk-on after 
batting .335 his senior year at Hoover. Under Dave Snow, who coached at Loyola 
before taking over the program at Cal State Long Beach this season, Grafitti 
said he got a quick indoctrination into the importance of preparation and 
mental toughness. 
</P>
<P>
"My freshman year was difficult but it made me a lot stronger person," said 
Grafitti, who earned a full scholarship this year. "I was one of a couple of 
guys that Snow was on every single day. If you quit he didn't want you, because 
you were weak and weren't going to be able to take it when you were faced with 
adversity. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad I got the chance to play for him because I think the things he taught 
me carry over to the working world, family -- everything." 
</P>
<P>
Grafitti, who is batting .274 with two home runs and 15 runs batted in in 84 
at-bats, has had his career slowed by two major obstacles: injuries and junior 
catcher Miah Bradbury. 
</P>
<P>
Grafitti's physical problems began during his senior year at Hoover, when he 
underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right knee for ligament damage suffered 
during basketball season. The knee remains unstable and requires Grafitti to 
wear a brace when he is on the field. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Grafitti broke the thumb on his glove hand. Last season, he suffered a 
broken index finger and wrist. 
</P>
<P>
However, at 6-foot-4, 210 pounds, Bradbury has proven an even more formidable 
barrier for Grafitti. Last season, Bradbury batted .345 with 10 home runs and 
43 RBIs. This season, he is batting .409 with six home runs and 44 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Mark could have started at most four-year schools, but unfortunately, 
from a baseball standpoint, he's playing behind a very gifted player," Smith 
said. "I think he recognizes that Miah Bradbury's don't come around very 
often." 
</P>
<P>
Said Grafitti: "A lot of people would have left when Miah came in and saw that 
they were going to spend their junior year sitting on the bench. I just liked 
the school and the friends I had here. That was more important to me than going 
somewhere I could play all the time."

HARBOR NINE TO OPEN PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harbor will meet San Jose City College today at 1 p.m. in the first round of 
the state baseball playoffs at Sacramento City College. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks (32-14) earned the spot in the four-team tournament by defeating 
Cypress, 2-1, in the Southern Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
If Harbor defeats San Jose (38-13), the North's No. 2 team, it will play the 
winner of today's Cerritos-Sacramento game at 3 p.m. Saturday. If the Seahawks, 
No. 1 in the South, lose they'll play the loser of that game at 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Either team will be difficult to beat. Sacramento (37-12) is the defending 
state champion and Cerritos (39-9), the 1987 state champ, is making its third 
straight appearance in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor's pitching is a strong point. Pat Ahearne, Chris Garrett and Leonard 
Fletcher are the starters and the bullpen is solid with freshmen Tom Fulkerson 
and Robert Parga and sophomore John Ingram. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel real good about this team," said Coach Jim O'Brien, who led Harbor to 
the state title in 1978 and 1984. "It took us a little while to get going this 
season, but now I think we have a great chance of winning this." IRENE GARCIA

HAWTHORNE RUNNERS GEAR UP FOR IMPORTANT MASTERS CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JORGE VALENCIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hawthorne High boys track team, fresh from winning their seventh divisional 
title in eight years a week ago at the CIF-Southern Section 4-A finals, still 
have unfinished business. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars, who set a state record in the 400-meter relay in 40.36 at Cerritos 
College last Saturday, will attempt to qualify for the state championships 
tonight at 6:30 in the Masters meet at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars may have another record on their minds when they take the track. 
They are attempting to become the first high school 400 relay team to break the 
40-second barrier. The top five finishers in each event will qualify for the 
state championships. 
</P>
<P>
The Masters is an important tuneup for the state meet, according to Hawthorne 
Coach Kye Courtney, whose club compiled 80 points -- 40 more than its closest 
competitor, Long Beach Wilson -- in the 4-A finals. 
</P>
<P>
"This week we're working a little harder," said Courtney, whose team performed 
well in the 4-A finals despite having practiced only two days because of minor 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't run them hard before the state meet, so we're working for that this 
week," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he insists he's not taking tonight's field lightly. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't look ahead," he said. "We're concerned about the meet because they 
squeeze a 6 1/3-hour meet into two hours, so kids like (sprinter Curtis) 
Conway, who runs in a lot of events, will have their hands full. 
</P>
<P>
"But Curtis has done it every year he's been here, so I don't think he'll have 
any trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Conway will compete in the 100, 200 and the 400 and 1,600 relays. He won both 
sprints and was a member of the winning relay teams in the 4-A finals despite a 
sore hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne sophomore Anthony Smith, a 400 relay team member and 4-A champion in 
the long jump with a mark of 24-2 3/4, was also hampered by a sore hamstring 
but should be ready. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not taking a chance on him pulling it again by putting him in the pit 
during practice," said Courtney, "but he will be jumping." 
</P>
<P>
Keith Pouncey and Dean Dunbar, who finished first and third in the 110-meter 
high hurdles, will also attempt to qualify, as will Cougars Erik Allen (100) 
and Chris Alexander (100). 
</P>
<P>
The Hawthorne girls team will try to qualify in the 400 relay after an upset 
win over Muir of Pasadena on Saturday. Kesha Marvin, the 4-A champion in 400 
meters, and sprinter Danika Conwright (100 and 200) are two of Hawthorne's 
standouts. 
</P>
<P>
Other South Bay schools represented tonight include St. Bernard, whose girls 
relay teams won the 400 and 1,600 relay championships. St. Bernard is led by 
Kerri Pegues, who won the 200 and 400 sprints last week. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Wiler of Rolling Hills, the 4-A pole vault champion at 15-0, will try to 
advance, along with Tim Camillo of Leuzinger, who finished second to Wiler at 
14-6. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Montgomery's Pete Hargraves, who finished second in the 2-A 100 and took 
third in the 200, will attempt to advance in both sprints. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Leslie of Morningside, Jenifer Tully of Torrance and Bonnie Jones of St. 
Bernard will compete in the girls long jump. 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Lucas of Palos Verdes will be in the 3,200 and Marilyn Cragin of 
Miraleste will compete in the high jump.

PLAY BALL! CITY SECTION REINSTATES 4-A PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a result of the settlement of the Los Angeles schoolteachers' strike, the 
City Section has reinstated the 4-A Division baseball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
City Section Commissioner Hal Harkness and a group representing the 4-A coaches 
hammered out a plan Thursday morning that calls for first-round games today and 
the next three rounds to be played Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. The final 
is scheduled for Thursday at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Teams that survive the first round of the 16-team tournament will be allowed to 
practice either Saturday or Monday, a school holiday. In addition, the City has 
instituted a pitching limit for next week, limiting a player to 14 innings over 
three games. 
</P>
<P>
Harkness had canceled the playoffs Tuesday because of a coaches' boycott 
stemming from the strike against Los Angeles Unified School District. The 
11-day-old strike was settled Thursday and teachers are expected back in school 
today. 
</P>
<P>
A group of 18 4-A coaches had voted last week to boycott the playoffs as part 
of the strike. Harkness announced the cancellation after a poll of the schools 
whose teams had qualified for the playoffs revealed that only a handful were 
willing to field teams without the coach of record. District rules state that 
the school official coaching a team must be a credentialed employee. 
</P>
<P>
Harkness, who had insisted that the playoffs could not be postponed because of 
conflicts with academics, reinstated the postseason tournament because the new 
format calls for no extension of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"From the first day the coaches talked about the boycott, an extension beyond 
June 1 was not acceptable," he said. "I've got no problem going back on my 
decision because this agreement is the best thing for kids who want to finish 
the season." 
</P>
<P>
The 4-A baseball coaches had been criticized by parents and district officials 
because they rejected the recommendation of the Los Angeles City Coaches Assn. 
that allowed coaches who honored picket lines to continue to direct their teams 
after school. The strike did not disrupt playoffs in 3-A baseball, golf, 
gymnastics, softball, swimming, track and volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like we fought World War III," San Fernando Coach Steve Marden said. 
"This is like a governor's reprieve. We were eating our last meal and we were 
down to the dessert. Today feels like a doubleheader victory. We got a contract 
with the union that we like, and the commitment we had for our teams will be 
able to be realized." 
</P>
<P>
Marden played an instrumental role in the reinstatement of the games. When he 
sensed an end to the strike Wednesday night, he devised a plan for a 
rescheduled tournament and then gained approval from the boycotting coaches to 
present the plan to Harkness at a meeting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In order to accommodate two wild-card games that were canceled last week, 
Marden called for games Friday and Saturday in addition to the 
Tuesday-Wednesday-Thursday games. Harkness had ruled that El Camino Real and 
Gardena would join the 16-team tournament based on better conference records, 
knocking Birmingham and Cleveland from the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Harkness ruled against any Saturday games in deference to administrators, who 
he said have been overworked during the strike. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a lot of stress at the schools and administrators have done 
enough," he said. "With no advance warning to set up these games, they didn't 
need Saturday baseball, especially on a three-day weekend." 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham Coach Wayne Sink said if put in the same position, he would boycott 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"My position was simple: If we have to strike, you cannot come back and coach. 
I haven't really had any negative feedback from the players," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday was not a day for negatives for those involved in City baseball. After 
nearly two weeks of strife, coaches, players, parents and school officials 
joined to commend the reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
"We probably had our best practice of the year today," Kennedy shortstop Gino 
Tagliaferri said. "We worked out for about 3 1/2 hours and everyone was there. 
This is our second season. I'm not so happy about going back to school, but 
this makes it OK." 
</P>
<P>
Although some teams assembled in time for practice Thursday, word traveled 
slowly to others. Tim Costic led Monroe to a City championship last year and 
was named The Times' Valley Player of the Year. He didn't learn of the 
announcement until 4 p.m. and wondered whether players would be prepared for 
today's games. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been running, taking swings and throwing with my dad, but we haven't 
worked out as a team," he said. "That's going to hurt us. Some guys maybe 
haven't picked up a ball because they thought the high school season was over. 
I wish the playoffs had started on schedule, but at least we're playing." 
</P>
<P>
Others expressed concern about the emotional damage the strike had caused 
between players and coaches. Some players have said that they are bitter and 
disappointed because they feel abandoned by their coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel we'll be together as a team and there is bitterness from 
players," Costic said. "Strikes do funny things. Friends before the strike may 
not be friends now." 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth Coach Bob Lofrano planned a meeting with his players before today's 
game against Gardena and conceded that the session could turn ugly. Players 
have criticized him for the leadership role he played in the boycott and he 
received a venomous letter from an anonymous parent accusing him of disloyalty 
to the team. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Evans, father of Chatsworth shortstop Jason, has supported Lofrano and is 
relieved that the strike is over. He said nothing would keep him from attending 
today's game but he issued a warning: 
</P>
<P>
"The coaches have to re-convince the players that they're on their side again," 
Evans said. "The coaches have to win the kids over with some kind of Knute 
Rockne motivational speech." 
</P>
<P>
Lofrano is not the fire-and-brimstone type but he realizes that special steps 
are needed to mend fences. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to clear the air, but I expect hard feelings from the players," he 
said. "But the bottom line is that we're back playing tomorrow. You can't let 
those things bother you when you cross the lines." 
</P>
<P>
LET THE GAMES BEGIN 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Chatsworth and defending-champion Monroe are among the 16 teams that 
will play today. Steve Elling's story, Page 14.

CSUN'S GILL IN FIFTH PLACE IN HEPTATHLON; 
</P>
<P>
FRESHMAN ON PACE FOR LIFETIME BEST IN DIVISION II TRACK FINALS 
</P>

HAMPTON, Va. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Competing in her third heptathlon in the past two weeks, Cal State Northridge 
freshman Lisa Gill overcame fatigue to move into fifth place with a first-day 
score of 2,973 points in the NCAA Division II track and field championships at 
Hampton University on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Lizz Barringer of Southeast Missouri State, second in last year's Division II 
meet, was the first-day leader with 3,216 points, followed by 1988 champion 
Durelle Schimek of Cal Poly Pomona (3,059) and Seattle Pacific teammates Juli 
Vanpelt (3,053) and Karen Lauve (3,023). 
</P>
<P>
Gill, a graduate of Alemany High, is 27 points ahead of her pace last weekend 
when she recorded a personal best of 4,895 points at Cal State Long Beach to 
qualify for the Division II meet. 
</P>
<P>
Gill was 85 points off that pace after the first two events -- the 100-meter 
low hurdles (15.27 seconds) and the high jump (5-5 3/4) -- but tied her 
heptathlon best in the shotput with a heave of 32-7 1/2 and ran a personal best 
of 25.71 in the 200 to complete the first day. 
</P>
<P>
The 200 time cut .25 seconds off Gill's previous best and gives her some needed 
momentum heading into the today's events (long jump, javelin, 800 meters). 
</P>
<P>
"The shotput and 200 has her headed in the right direction," Northridge Coach 
Don Strametz said. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, paced by the third- and fourth-place efforts of 
Amanda Marks and Patty Almendariz in the 10,000 meters, led the women's meet 
with 12 points after the first day. St. Augustine (Raleigh, N.C.) and Seattle 
Pacific were tied for second with 10 points each. 
</P>
<P>
Angelo State (San Angelo, Tex.) -- led by a 2-3-4-5 finish in the hammer throw 
-- was the leader in the men's meet with 23 points, followed by North Dakota 
State and Cal Poly Pomona with 10 each. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, ninth in last year's Division II meet, was tied for eighth with 
three points. Junior Paul Albers accounted for the Matadors' points with a 
sixth-place effort in the hammer. 
</P>
<P>
Albers threw 176 feet, 8 inches. Teammate Dave Youngberg placed ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Darcy Arreola, Tina Cheney and Gena Jauregui were all scheduled to run for 
Northridge in qualifying heats of the women's 1,500 Thursday but automatically 
advanced for Saturday's final because there were only 11 entrants. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN junior Tyrone Jeffries, who has placed sixth in the 400-meter intermediate 
hurdles in the past two Division II championships, easily qualified for 
Saturday's final in that event, placing fourth in his heat with a 51.99 effort. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffries will compete in a heat of the 110 high hurdles today and join Tyrone 
Harlow, Melvin Jones and Chris Pippins in the 400 relay. 
</P>
<P>
Finals today include the heptathlon, the women's 3,000 -- in which Arreola will 
defend her title -- and the high jump.

FISHING REPORT / DAN STANTON: BARRACUDA HOT HOLIDAY RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Dan Stanton

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anglers planning to go out over the three-day Memorial Day weekend should 
prepare for a fish fry. 
</P>
<P>
Name any fish you would like to catch and chances are it can be hooked, 
especially the three Bs: barracuda, bonito and bass. 
</P>
<P>
The hottest run continues to be barracuda with the biggest concentration 
outside Rocky Point. 
</P>
<P>
Yellowtail and white sea bass have broken wide open at Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
The Topgun, sailing from L.A. Harbor Sportfishing with a tank of live squid, 
found the hot spot early this week at Catalina. 
</P>
<P>
Anglers used light tackle and the white sea bass, all quality fish, weighed 18 
to 35 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Brandberry of Long Beach caught the whopper of the week with his 
35-pounder. Mark Gotto of West Los Angeles landed a 28-pounder as did Dave Van 
Hotten of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
With the one-fish limit on white sea bass filled, the Topgun had to leave the 
bite early. Capt. Bob Taft moved up the island to where the yellowtail have 
been tearing up tackle. 
</P>
<P>
It was the right move as 27 yellows went into the bulging sacks of sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
The King Harbor Marlin Club and Redondo Yacht Club's third annual Sadie Hawkins 
fishing tournament was a success as 28 women participated from eight boats.

VOLLEYBALL PROS RETURN HOME FOR $75,000 VENICE OPEN TOURNAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After playing more than a third of the professional beach volleyball season in 
such unlikely locales as Dallas, Phoenix and New Orleans, the tour returns home 
this weekend for the $75,000 Venice Open. 
</P>
<P>
Once a strictly Southern California phenomenon offering its top players little 
more than sun and status, the professional beach volleyball tour now consists 
of 29 tournaments with $1.9 million in prize money. The winning two-man team 
will divide $17,250 in the Venice Open, which begins at 8:30 a.m. Saturday and 
ends with the championship match at 3 p.m. Sunday on the sand north of Venice 
Pier. 
</P>
<P>
The growth on the sport began with the formation in 1983 of the Assn. of 
Volleyball Professionals, which brought wealthy sponsors, big money and 
national cable television coverage to the beach. And the tour has brought the 
beach -- by the truckload -- to landlocked cities whose only previous exposure 
to the game had been soft drink and beer commercials. 
</P>
<P>
"We've played in horrendous dirt, construction sand, some far from ideal 
circumstances," said Mike Dodd, who with his partner, Tim Hovland, form the 
leading team in the AVP money rankings. Both have earned $58,000 to date, 
winning three tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Although Dodd says Southern California "has the best crowds, the best beaches 
and is the best place to play in the world," the 6-foot-4 El Segundo resident, 
who learned the game on the hallowed sands of Manhattan Beach, sees value in 
the long trips to Cleveland, Milwaukee and Rochester, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
"We see ourselves as pioneers, taking our sport all over the country," Dodd 
said. "It's really unbelievable. When we go to a new site, the first year the 
crowd will be sparse. Then the next year, the same people will be back, they've 
told their friends and there will be a bigger crowd. The big payoff is watching 
the excitement grow in an area that had never seen the game before." 
</P>
<P>
Going into the Venice Open, Sinjin Smith and Randy Stoklos, last year's 
champions and the most successful team in beach volleyball history, are even 
with Dodd-Hovland in tournament victories (three) but trail in the money 
rankings with $45,687 each. 
</P>
<P>
Karch Kiraly is also back on the beach after taking last summer off to play for 
the U.S. Olympic team.

Photo, An Eyesore -- Heavyweight Monte Masters of Saugus spent nearly three 
years dreaming about returning to the ring but little more than three minutes 
living that dream. He made his comeback Wednesday at the Hollywood Palace 
against Dee Collier of Los Angeles, a former state champion. Masters was 
knocked down twice, once in the first round and again in the second. Above, 
referee Chuck Hassett gives Masters the count after the first knockdown. The 
fight was stopped in the second round of the scheduled 10-rounder because of a 
punch that closed Masters' eye, right. JOAN M. ZOPF-PAHOYO / Los Angeles Times

FALCONS BEAT SAN PASQUAL EASILY FOR FIRST TITLE

Torrey Pines has its team title, and Shawn Wirth her integrity. Not bad for an 
afternoon's work. 
</P>
<P>
By winning the San Diego Section team gymnastics title Thursday at Torrey Pines 
by a landslide, the host Falcons won their first team championship and made an 
honest woman of four-year coach Wirth, who repeatedly said her gymnasts were 
destined to win it. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really nervous," Wirth said after her optional gymnasts scored 110.70 
points to defeat second-place San Pasqual (105.55). "All year I've been saying 
we'd win. It would have looked pretty bad if we hadn't." 
</P>
<P>
Combined with Wednesday's compulsory scores, the Falcons finished with a 
school-record 220.10 -- Mt. Carmel's 1987 section record is 221.25. Runner-up 
San Pasqual finished with 210.30 and defending champion Santana, second after 
compulsories, slipped to third with 206.90. 
</P>
<P>
"They knew they had a job to do," Wirth said of all the hype. "We didn't have 
any score we wanted to reach, we just wanted to hit all our routines." 
</P>
<P>
Defending section champion Tasha Taylor had two firsts (vault and uneven bars), 
a second (balance beam) and a third (floor exercise) and set a school record 
(38.00) en route to her second consecutive all-around title. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great," Taylor said. "I would have let myself down if I hadn't won." 
</P>
<P>
But Taylor said Wirth's title talk didn't pressure her too much. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't put all that much pressure on me," she said, "but I tend to perform 
better when I'm under a lot of pressure, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Fallbrook freshman Paige Peterman, who Taylor figured would press her for the 
individual title, started strong on the floor exercise but had a break on bars 
and fell on a difficult back tuck on the balance beam that dropped her to 
fourth in the all-around. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had only done better on bars and beam . . . " she said. Peterman was 
first on floor -- she won it with a 9.6 to Taylor's 9.55. 
</P>
<P>
Second in the all-around was Falcon junior Julie Kawasaki, whose difficult 
front headspring into an immediate back handspring was the spark that helped 
lift her to a first-place 9.55 in the balance beam. She was fifth on vault and 
eighth on floor. 
</P>
<P>
Kawasaki competes with Taylor at the Gymnastics Center of San Diego and said 
Taylor pushes her harder in meets. 
</P>
<P>
"She's on a higher level then me, she drives me to excel," said Kawasaki, who 
was never worried about her team's chances. "I was just trying to do my best. 
We didn't have to worry about winning because we had that cushion from 
compulsories." 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines had just one slight break during an otherwise flawless day. 
</P>
<P>
"We hit everything," Wirth said. "There was just that one extra swing." 
</P>
<P>
Before Taylor's difficult toe-on, front tuck dismount on her uneven bar 
routine, she took an extra giant swing. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to get that second giant in," Taylor said, who won despite the mistake. 
"I was going too fast to get my toes on."

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: SOCKERS' SEGOTA COULD MISS OPENER OF FINALS

<P>
Branko Segota, leading the Sockers in playoff points with 13, may not play the 
opener of the Major Indoor Soccer League championship series Monday night at 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Segota reinjured his hamstring Saturday in a 1-0 victory over the Dallas 
Sidekicks in Game 7 of the semifinal series. The odds Segota will be ready 
Monday are about 50-50. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say it's no better than that," said Bill Taylor, the Sockers' trainer. 
"He's torn some scar tissue in the same hamstring he's had trouble with all 
year." 
</P>
<P>
The injury occured minutes before Segota scored the winning goal. Taylor said 
he and Segota discussed the possibility of him coming out of the game but 
decided to let him try one more shift. 
</P>
<P>
Segota hasn't practiced this week but is expected to do some light jogging 
through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"He's basically walking now without pain," Taylor said. "It's a day-to-day 
thing." DON PATTERSON

In other 2-A quarterfinal games: 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Buena Vista 13, Mission Bay 6 -- The unranked Longhorns booted the 
county's No. 2-ranked team and the defending 2-A champion out of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Our weakness was found out today, and I've known about it for a long time," 
said Mission Bay Coach Dennis Pugh. "Pitching. They just hit everything we 
threw at them today. They did a good job." 
</P>
<P>
Pitching a weakness? It was only Tony Lennan's second loss (11 victories). 
Rancho Buena Vista's Donovan Crocker improved to 6-4, and Jason Robirds had the 
game's only home run, a three-run blast in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont 19, St. Augustine 7 -- Grossmont got home runs from Jim Earley (two 
for four), Dan Lennon and Kent Smith. Todd Cady went two for three and scored 
five runs, and John Tatum was four for five with two runs. Pitcher Mark Gapski 
(7-2) got the win. 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad 2, USDHS 1 -- Carlsbad (21-9) scored two runs in the bottom of the 
seventh. Larry Griffith drew a bases-loaded walk to force in the winning run. 
USDHS finished 21-6.

<P>
Parker 14, Imperial 2 -- Pietro LaGreca (two for two) and William Beamer (two

CLOTHESLINES: EVENING SUIT A GOOD CHOICE ON THE BUSINESS-SOCIAL SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYLOU LUTHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: What's appropriate to wear to a high school reunion dinner dance to 
be held this spring at a beautiful club? Specifically, what should a still-slim 
older woman wear if she wants to be in fashion, but not over-dressed? Escorts 
are asked to wear business suits. -- T.B.L. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: How about an evening suit? You'll feel appropriately dressed, 
especially if you make the suit jacket in a dressy fabric such as satin, lace 
or wool crepe and the skirt in a softer chiffon. The idea of a tailored jacket 
with soft skirt is newer than two pieces in the same fabric. 
</P>
<P>
The suit illustrated here is Ralph Lauren's design for Vogue Pattern 2090. You 
can make the skirt street length or longer, but the shorter length would be 
more compatible with the men's business suits. Your suit will look especially 
fashionable in navy or pale pastels such as dove gray, pale peach, blush pink 
or celadon. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I wish you'd tell designers to stop making all these black clothes. I think 
black is depressing. For weeks after Oprah Winfrey lost weight, she wore only 
black. I thought she was in mourning for her weight. Wearing all black takes 
away your individuality. In an age when there's a lot of stress, drugs, 
depression, teen-age suicide, etc., I feel the all-black style just induces 
that mood. 
</P>
<P>
Kids who wear all black seem to disappear, not stand out. I feel more in 
control when I'm given choices to make. Kids complain that they are bored as it 
is. Well, can you imagine how boring life is when you're wearing the same color 
every day? Perhaps the idea is to eliminate the color competition and get into 
personalities? I disagree. Clothes express your personality. I like variety. I 
like colors. I like being optimistic. I like freedom. -- S.C. 
</P>
<P>
A: And I like your letter. While there is a definite fashion trend to black for 
young people, and while black is still great for disguising fat, creating your 
own style is what clothes-wearing is all about. You might be interested in 
Paris knitwear queen Sonia Rykiel's views on color as expressed in her new 
book, "Celebration" (Des Femmes, Antoinette Fouque). 
</P>
<P>
Rykiel believes yellow is the most spectacular color. 
</P>
<P>
"It heightens or pales -- that depends on the makeup, which must be heavy or 
light. They say wearing yellow is to wear good luck. Yellow is an infinity of 
shades, a circle, a symbol of silence, the contrary of orange, which excites. 
</P>
<P>
"White means tradition," Rykiel writes. "It remains the color of the eternal. 
Blue is space, distance, universe. It calms; it is the color of hope. Pink, 
color of the body, color of flesh . . . invites. Green could only be of nature 
. . . it forces, it flounces. Red seizes the heart, is love, passion, the 
trigger. Black emphasizes, magnifies, pierces, strikes, rips, untouchable and 
inviolate." 
</P>
<P>
Black may pierce, strike and rip and it may be depressing, but I don't think it 
magnifies -- at least not in clothes. To the contrary, it causes shrinkage 
whenever it's worn.

Today Show hostess Jane Pauley is showing off the sites of Los Angeles this 
week, but she saved one just for herself. Between takes in various Melrose 
Avenue stores for grown-ups, the diminutive mother of three ducked into Kids In 
Costume and loaded up on Indian and clown suits, butterfly wings, mermaid 
scales and a Southern Belle outfit with a hoop skirt for her three kids. Wanda 
Fudge of the store says Pauley has had her eye on it from afar, ever since her 
daughter's Manhattanite playmate started parading around in a "Kids" mermaid 
suit.

Calvin's Tennis Togs 
</P>
<P>
Calvin Klein has a new racket -- a tennis racquet. Listen's New York spy found 
him at the Midtown Tennis Club where other fashion designers, among them Mary 
McFadden, also play ball. Calvin's taking beginning lessons, but what Listen 
learned has more to do with his backside than his backhand. The report from the 
locker room is that nothing comes between Calvin and his tennis shorts -- 
except his own, signature briefs. 
</P>
<P>
A Reborn Blonde 
</P>
<P>
We don't know how anyone would dare, but someone turned Brigitte Neilsen into a 
dishwater blonde while she was in Arizona. Neilsen called the Umberto salon in 
Beverly Hills, looking for help from hair stylist Bruce Wayne. But he was on 
location in New Jersey's Rahway prison, tending to the locks of Nielsen's 
ex-husband, Sylvester Stallone, who is making a movie there. Neilsen reached 
Wayne there "and begged him to fly out," we're told. He did, and now she's 
solid platinum again.

Fred, Italian-Style 
</P>
<P>
It was Dom Perignon and caviar time at 273 N. Rodeo Drive for the unveiling of 
retailer Fred Hayman's signature collection of handbags and leather goods. The 
usual fashion suspects were on hand -- Zsa Zsa Gabor (who quickly purchased one 
of the satin evening bags), Judith Krantz and Contessa Cohn. And then there was 
the handsome dark-haired Italian working the room, Nicola Minelli, better known 
as the manager of the Rodeo Drive Gucci shop for 20 years. Hayman cut short 
Minelli's retirement by putting him to work as chief designer of his new 
leather collection. The emphasis is on accessories and handbags made of 
cappuccino-colored vinyl imprinted with an FH motif, a la Louis Vuitton, and 
trimmed in leather. Also available: Brightly colored satin evening bags with 
jeweled clasps and a luggage line, due out this fall. Prices start at $165, but 
reach as high as $5,000 for reptilian handbags. With Minelli at the helm, 
everything, of course, is made in Italy.

Purple Reign Continues 
</P>
<P>
Prince (a k a the Purple rock legend, because grape is his favorite color) was 
spotted cooling his spike-heels at Vertigo, the Downtown club, the other night. 
Maybe he, like the rest of us, was waiting for the release of his new song, 
"Bat Dance." It'll be on the "Batman" movie sound track, and Prince's tune 
includes lots of quotes he took from the Joker (Jack Nicholson's) character in 
the upcoming, campy flick. 
</P>
<P>
Who Dressed Zemeckis 
</P>
<P>
While "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" director Robert Zemeckis was working on sequels 
to "Back to the Future," his wife went shopping for his birthday suit. And it 
didn't take long. Sami Dinar says Mary Ellen Zemeckis spent all of 15 minutes 
in his Brighton Way menswear store selecting a black rayon, six-button, 
double-breasted suit; two shirts; a sterling lapel pin, and a terry cloth robe. 
We hear the suit, worn with a linen-cotton T-shirt, went down very well at 
Zemeckis' birthday celebration attended by pals Steven Spielberg, Michael 
Douglas and Jack Rafferty. 
</P>
<P>
B Is for Bikini and . . . 
</P>
<P>
Actress Amy Steel of "The Guiding Light" fame is launching a second career this 
summer, as a fashion designer with just one product to sell: the B-string 
bikini. B is for baby, and the string doesn't even begin to cover a baby's 
backside. But Steel and her fashion partner, comedian Claire Berger, whom she 
met at a prenatal exercise class, describe their design as a liberated suit. 
Steel's mother-in-law, Lily Pulitzer, the designing socialite whose flower 
print dresses were required wearing 20 summers ago, served as fashion 
consultant for the B-string. Steel says her best advice was this: "When people 
say you can't do it, don't listen, just keep going." No doubt that helps 
explain why the cute little suits are now available (for $13-$18) at children's 
stores around town, including Fred Segal Kids, This Little Piggy and Bam Bam. 
</P>
<P>
Stars in the Pink 
</P>
<P>
The Pink, a little theater in Santa Monica, turned out to be a magnet for rock 
stars the night that Listen stopped in to see a production of "The Rhythm of 
Torn Stars." It's a dramatization of poetry by New York's Lower East Side 
writers. Rocker Billy Idol was there to see his friend, actress Perri Lister, 
perform in the show. Hard to tell if Billy actually caught much of her act. He 
kept his shades on throughout the evening. Other music men on hand that night 
were Peter Case of modern folk music fame, and John Lydon (a k a Johnny 
Rotten), the ex-Pistol now lead singer for PIL (that's Public Image Limited). 
</P>
<P>
The Big Picture 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Mitrotti, who used to have a branch of Madonna menswear shop in Beverly 
Hills, and still does in New York, has decided that canvas is his favorite 
fabric. He's been devoting himself to painting for the last year and recently 
opened a one-man show at the Bruce Lurie Gallery in Manhattan. Not 
surprisingly, several of Mitrotti's works depict men in colorful ensembles that 
might have come right off the rack of his Madonna shop. He plans shows for Los 
Angeles and Europe in the fall.

A CLOSE STUDY OF CHARACTERS IN TRANSIT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In Transit: 20 Stories by Mavis Gallant (Random House: $17.95; 229 pages) 
</P>
<P>
First published in the New Yorker during the 1950s and '60s, these vintage 
stories have aged like fine Burgundy. A Canadian who settled long ago in Paris, 
Gallant is ideally placed to record the joys and tribulations of people 
permanently or temporarily at odds with their environment. Though the 
collection is conveniently divided into three sections, virtually all the 
characters are observed at the crucial moments when their lives irrevocably 
change; a thematic connection that gives the book a subtle unity. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Wedding Ring," a barely adolescent girl is spending a summer in Vermont 
with her mother, a boy cousin "the only American relation my age," and an 
unnamed 24 year-old male guest. The narrator's father is in Montreal attending 
to business, and this mysterious guest seems to have replaced him in some 
obscure way; driving the family to the movies, tactfully disciplining the 
children, turning the writer's mother into a capricious stranger. Sometimes she 
talks about her daughter to the visitor as "if she'd never seen me before"; 
other times, she treats her as a contemporary. 
</P>
<P>
Young as she is, the child derives the truth from these contrary messages, 
realizing her mother is in love with the visitor. At the beginning of this 
brief piece, she's still a child; a few acute perceptions later, she's become 
an adult. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Awaiting Other Assignments 
</P>
<P>
"Malcolm and Bea" transports us to a NATO enclave in France, where Americans, 
Canadians and Britons are winding up their tours of duty and awaiting other 
assignments. All the themes of "In Transit" coalesce in this one particular 
story, nuanced with Gallant's shrewd eye for the subtle differences of speech, 
dress, and manner that define national character and separate people from each 
other. A single phrase about the way children play "without admonitions and 
good advice" under the disapproving eye of the old French "gardien" tells you 
exactly how these interlopers are regarded in their host country. 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm is English, Bea Canadian, and the tensions of their French sojourn have 
frayed their marriage to the point where Malcolm asks his wife whom she hates 
most, the English, the French, or the Americans, knowing the unspoken answer 
will be Malcolm himself, for bringing her to a place that could never be home. 
Bea may not be quite as hopelessly provincial as Verna Baum, who has gone from 
the Congo to Copenhagen carrying "an electric iron that cannot be plugged in 
anywhere except Hamilton, Ontario," but Gallant offers enough of Bea's 
background to convince us she'll never be a cosmopolite. Here again the 
characters are in transit emotionally as well as geographically; physical 
displacement intensifying their misery. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Macho Festival 
</P>
<P>
In "The Hunter's Waking Thoughts," a Frenchwoman invites her scholarly and 
somewhat effete English lover to a hunting party at her father's estate, a 
macho festival also attended by her husband. Colin Graves is put into an 
outbuilding with a cot, a lamp, and a chamber pot; relegated to the company of 
women and children while the men rampage around the estate, shooting everything 
that moves. Alone after his paramour leaves for Paris with her daughters and a 
still-bleeding hare, the frustrated lover realizes that the entire appeal of 
this cross-cultural romance has been its utter impossibility. 
</P>
<P>
"In Italy" is a briskly ironic story exposing the ambivalent feelings of a 
young woman who inadvertently finds herself with a grandchild exactly the same 
age as her own infant son. Brought up to believe that she'd be happier as an 
old man's darling than a young man's slave, Stella has wound up neither adored 
nor adoring, just patiently enduring the fatuities of the man she married. This 
time the transition is the crucial one between naivete and worldliness; a 
passage Stella will never quite manage. 
</P>
<P>
Loyal to her husband, she's a true English brick, stuck indefinitely in a 
rented Italian villa where rats jump from tree to tree and every one of her 
English plants shrivels and dies in the alien soil. At least Peggy, Henry 
Manning's disinherited daughter, can go home to England with her husband and 
baby, but Stella has made a choice and believes "you have to stick to it, 
that's all." There are a lot of Stellas in the world and their stories lend 
themselves perfectly to Gallant's wit and compassion.

HOUSTON'S CAMPY, POP 'WHERE'S DICK?' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM ALBRIGHT 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
HOUSTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dick being sought in Stewart Wallace's teasingly titled "Where's Dick?" is 
not Dick Wagner, Dick Strauss or even Dick Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
It's Dick Tracy, and the composers lurking in the wings of this alternative New 
Vaudeville opera are Steve Sondheim, Lenny Bernstein in his "Trouble in Tahiti" 
stage, Minimalism Main Man Phil Glass, Johnny Gay of "Beggar's Opera" fame, and 
generic rock, blues, jazz and even tango tunesmiths. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's Dick?" was written on a fellowship from the National Endowment for the 
Arts, workshopped at Opera/Omaha and given two concert readings at Playwrights 
Horizons, the noted Off-Broadway theater company. It received a stylish but 
only intermittently satisfying world premiere Wednesday night in Miller Outdoor 
Theatre by Texas Opera Theater, the touring arm of the Houston Grand Opera. 
</P>
<P>
The hero of Chester Gould's classic comic strip is needed in "Where's Dick?" to 
foil a passel of baddies so outlandishly cartoonish they make the villains in 
television's "Batman" look slice-of-life. 
</P>
<P>
The swat stick-wielding Ma Paddle and a scroungy Santa kidnap ventriloquist 
dummies, force-feed them pickles of forgetfulness and sell them to new mommies. 
When they bag Mrs. Heimlich's wooden son, she tries to buy another so she will 
still have a child to abuse. Stump Tower is a midget developer who wants to 
build a skyscraper on the site of Ma's bogus orphanage. The Rev. J.J. Newright 
and Sister Immacula saw people in half and exchange the bottom halves. 
</P>
<P>
Baby Snowflake is an albino gorilla hungry for virgin flesh. Like that of Fate 
Spritely, who always carries a bridal veil and Niagara Falls travel brochures 
in her purse just in case she bumps into a prospective groom. Like Junior, the 
bumbling would-be detective who reels around the sharply raked, game-board 
stage like a top in perpetual search of Dick Tracy. 
</P>
<P>
Junior never finds his hero. But the opera -- narrated by a Kabuki countertenor 
who's named Boldface Headlines and dressed like a living newspaper -- ends with 
an ensemble declaration that we must look for heroism in ourselves, not 
somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
Though trained at Juilliard, the Houston-raised Wallace has grounded "Where's 
Dick?" in pop music. At their boldest and best, his torch ballads, patter 
songs, gospel shouts and rock-based numbers. 
</P>
<P>
But the campy humor of Wallace's aggressively non-arty score and Michael 
Korie's modestly naughty libretto gets numbingly thin when stretched over 
nearly three sprawling, erratic hours. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Foreman, who founded the avant-garde Ontological-Hysteric Theater in 
1968, staged the opera with tons of outrageous humor. Indeed, there was so much 
intricate funny business that the performers could have used a few more 
rehearsals to master it. 
</P>
<P>
HGO music director John DeMain -- who will conduct Los Angeles Music Center 
Opera's "Orpheus in the Underworld," opening June 14 -- led his 18-member, 
hidden-under-the-stage orchestra with firmness and panache. Jim Buff's costumes 
and Christina Giannelli's lighting enjoyed fitting comic-strip exaggeration. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-member cast consisted of opera singers and Broadway-musical performers. 
Acting Company alumnus Henry Stram, his bald pate ringed with collar-length 
fringe, made an ideally waiflike and nimble Junior, and soprano Karen Patricia 
McVoy was a nicely vulnerable Fate Spritely. Angelina Reaux's singing as Baby 
Snowflake was a bit lean and edgy, but Natalie Oliver and Consuelo Hill belted 
splendidly as Sister Immacula and Police Chief Blowhard. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Benson's Ma Paddle recalled "Annie's" Miss Hannigan, and bass Wilbur 
Pauley rumbled darkly as Santa. Ken Jennings and bass-baritone Daryl Henriksen 
were aptly oily as Stump Tower and the Rev. Newright. 
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing for effect the break between falsetto and his natural baritone, 
countertenor Randall Wong sang Boldface Headlines' slow, slightly eerie music 
with pure, ethereal tone. Joyce Castle's mezzo was neither pure nor ethereal, 
but her torchy singing and broadly vampy acting as Mrs. Heimlich stole the show 
anyway.

A state Assembly subcommittee voted Wednesday to restore a $3-million cut 
proposed by Gov. George Deukmejian for the $15.6-million budget of the 
California Arts Council. Contrary to what was widely anticipated, the 
subcommittee did not recommend that the council trim its administration budget, 
but it did request studies about how the arts agency awards grants. A Senate 
subcommittee has recommended the same budget restoration, also voting for an 
additional $2.2 million for the council. The matter now goes before a joint 
legislative committee, then to Deukmejian, who will sign the entire state 
budget into law in July. CLAUDIA PUIG

Jury selection has begun in a lawsuit over a woman's accidental death 2 1/2 
years ago in a hot tub on Dustin Hoffman's Roxbury, Conn., estate. Sheila Cruse 
Fionda, 43, was found floating face down in the hot tub at Hoffman's estate in 
1986. The actor was not there at the time and Fionda had gone out to dinner 
with the estate's caretaker earlier. Police concluded that Ms. Fionda drowned 
accidentally, her blood-alcohol level being three times the legal limit for 
driving in Connecticut. Her former husband, A. Joseph Fionda, sued Hoffman, the 
property's former caretaker, the tub installer and the manufacturer of its 
heater. The suit, which does not specify amount of damages sought, accuses 
Hoffman of failing to have the area of the hot tub fenced, failing to ensure 
that the water did not get too hot and failing to instruct the caretaker about 
the safe use of the tub. CLAUDIA PUIG

Rob Lowe, 24, denied in court records that he seduced a 16-year-old girl who 
allegedly taped a sexual encounter with him, and the girl's father said his 
"very modest" daughter never intended to blackmail Lowe for $2 million. Court 
records unsealed Wednesday at the request of lawyers for the Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution also indicate Lowe's lawyers tried to "reach a compromise 
settlement" eight months after the alleged incident. The girl's mother filed 
suit May 12 against the actor seeking unspecified civil damages for the alleged 
seduction of her daughter, who turned 17 last month. Prosecutors are 
investigating possible criminal charges against Lowe for exploiting a minor.

Paris Opera officials Thursday named 36-year-old Myung-Whun Chung music 
director of the Bastille Opera, confirming reports of the appointment widely 
circulated earlier this week. The Korean-born conductor -- who leads the radio 
orchestra in Saarbrucken, West Germany, and was associate conductor of the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic under Carlo Maria Giulini -- succeeds Daniel Barenboim, 
who was fired from the post in January by Pierre Berge, the 
government-appointed chairman of the Paris Opera board. Elements in the 
Barenboim-Berge conflict were the conductor's $1.1-million salary for four 
months, and artistic control over the composition of the opera orchestra and 
the naming of stage directors. No details on Chung's salary or the length of 
his contract were given, but Chung did say that it calls for him to be in Paris 
for at least six months a year, and gives him final say in the hiring of stage 
directors. A compromise on revamping the orchestra is still being worked out. 
The Bastille position, which was previously offered to Charles Mackerras and 
Marek Janowski, among others, will be Chung's first opera directorate. Neither 
Chung nor Berge offered any specific plans for the first season in the new 
opera house, which will be inaugurated July 13 with a special concert as part 
of the bicentennial celebrations of the French Revolution.

PHAROAH SANDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When tenor saxophonist Pharoah Sanders walked on stage for his first set at 
Catalina Bar &amp; Grill, he was greeted by a front row of listeners containing 
no fewer than five young men wearing ponytails and tie-dyes. The symbolism was 
inescapable. Sixties revivalism has finally embraced the decade's most 
clangorously radical new music. 
</P>
<P>
How ironic, then, that Sanders' performance Tuesday night retained few of the 
radically innovative qualities that marked him in the mid-'60s as one of John 
Coltrane's most gifted legatees. The intervening years appear to have softened 
Sanders' sound and his vision with somewhat ambivalent results. 
</P>
<P>
His willingness, for example, to play a lovely ballad (on which he turned the 
improvising over to bassist Jeff Lilton and pianist William Henderson), as well 
as a jaunty West Indian piece and a straight-ahead blues, resulted in vigorous, 
if not particularly startling, contemporary jazz. 
</P>
<P>
But it remained for Sanders' occasional forays (usually undertaken at the close 
of a piece) around the outer limits of his tenor saxophone's capabilities to 
provide far too-brief reminders of the genuinely revolutionary qualities of his 
earlier playing. During those moments, as well as during the improvisational 
passages in which he responded and interacted with drummer Wayne Wright's 
multilevel carpet of complex rhythms, Sanders came close to reviving the spirit 
of the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
More often, he stepped aside to allow his excellent rhythm section to dominate 
the proceedings. Making the most of the opportunity, were bassist Lilton with 
his feathery dynamics, drummer Wright and his articulate brush work and 
Henderson whose dense piano chording was more than worth the price of 
admission. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it would have been nice to have heard a bit more from Sanders. 
Revolutionary or not, he continues -- when he so chooses -- to be one of the 
world-class players on his instrument. 
</P>
<P>
The Sanders group will be at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill through Saturday night.

COOPER, GREEN IN REVIVAL FOR THE TROMBONE

The use of two trombones as centerpieces for a jazz group seemed to go out of 
fashion many years ago when J.J. Johnson and Kai Winding went their separate 
ways. Its revival by Buster Cooper and Thurman Green, who led a quintet at 
Alfonse's, provided a welcome reminder that such partnerships are as valid now 
as ever. 
</P>
<P>
This sartorially elegant pair can boast impeccable credentials. Green is best 
known for his work with Gerald Wilson, Harold Land and Willie Bobo; Cooper 
played with Lionel Hampton, Benny Goodman and, for seven years, Duke Ellington. 
</P>
<P>
It was immediately evident Wednesday that their decision to work together is 
more than a one-night-stand throwaway; they had music to provide them with at 
least a routine of sorts on most tunes. In unison or harmony, they achieved a 
burnished blend that was further accented by the sympathetic drumming of Pat 
Sharrod, who seems to know all the ends and outs of these arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper has long been known for his sly, sliding way with a tune. Tossing notes 
around like confetti, he is about as instantly recognizable as anyone handling 
this horn today. Green, though less identifiable, is a strong improvising force 
who solos on a blues, and the Sonny Rollins standard "Doxy" provided often a 
welcome contrast to Cooper's explosions. 
</P>
<P>
Because Wednesday was the 15th anniversary of Duke Ellington's death, Cooper 
dedicated part of the set to his ex-boss, deserting for a sensitive "I Got It 
Bad" and an intense "Caravan." 
</P>
<P>
The dancing lines of Dwight Dickerson's piano and the limber, inventive bass 
solos by James Leary rounded out the plus factors in this communicative unit, 
which left no doubt that everyone on the bandstand was contentedly engaged in 
an act of musical stimulation. Because their work has been largely confined to 
big bands in recent years (Cooper is most often heard with Bill Berry), it was 
a pleasure to hear these leaders in a setting that unleashed them in a context 
of unlimited freedom. LEONARD FEATHER

JOFFREY IN ARPINO'S 'VIVA VIVALDI' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, Times Dance Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Viva Vivaldi" is one of Gerald Arpino's strangest and most fascinating Joffrey 
Ballet showpieces. Created in 1965 and revived this season, it contains duets 
of great originality as well as group passages just as slick and empty as 
Arpino's recent output. A real back-to-the-future oddity. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, it's curious that Arpino made a Spanish-style divertissement from 
the Venetian composer's Concerto in D for violin, strings and cembalo. And 
those two moody, intimate duets -- each of them ornamented by three subsidiary 
dancers -- are puzzling too, structurally and spatially, very imaginative but 
expressively enigmatic, even private. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the first duet involved 
Elizabeth Parkinson and Ashley Wheater along with three male soloists, while 
the second featured Julie Janus and Tom Mossbrucker plus three women. But the 
formal parallels soon dissolved as each sequence developed its own pattern of 
principal and group interaction and its unique emotional implications. 
</P>
<P>
In the two bravura sections, however, (one dominated by Jodie Gates and Carole 
Valleskey, the other by Edward Stierle and Carl Corry), we saw what has become 
Arpino's M.O.: high-velocity, hard-sell step combinations imposed at random on 
cast and score. And here the ballet blurred into all the generalized 
neoclassical bonbons to come, and they into one another. Let's see, there's 
"Suite Vivaldi" and "Viva Saint-Saens," "Italian Rain" and "Light Confetti," 
"Reflections of Angels, and "Ketten-something" . . . 
</P>
<P>
All the dancing had flair and charm, but Mossbrucker was the major surprise: 
unexpectedly somber and even self-absorbed. A sense of mystery always makes an 
artist interesting, but the quality can be startling when combined with 
all-American surfer-boy looks. If the underwater fantasy "Sea Shadow" (Tuesday) 
depended on this juxtaposition, "Viva Vivaldi" showed Mossbrucker sustaining it 
in a non-dramatic context and making it doubly compelling. 
</P>
<P>
Allen Lewis conducted stylishly, with guitarist Stuart Fox and violinist 
Kenneth Yerke the capable soloists. Completing the program: Paul Taylor's 
"Cloven Kingdom" and Eugene Loring's "Billy the Kid," both reviewed during the 
Joffrey Ballet's recent engagement in Costa Mesa.

A WILL AND A FRAY IN THE COMICAL 'SO LONG' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aunt Pearl is laid out in a casket in the family living room, where 
occasionally one of the gathering mourners lifts the coffin lid with airy 
detachment and peers at her with curiosity and relief. 
</P>
<P>
It's a wonderful, droll touch, setting the comical tone for the West Coast 
premiere of Sandra Deer's "So Long on Lonely Street" at International City 
Theatre in Long Beach. Deer has ripened the hoary tradition of the 
reading-of-the-will drama with dripping Southern Gothic excess -- in this case 
greed, incest and dark family secrets. 
</P>
<P>
The zany unraveling of Aunt Pearl's will among the members of an acrimonious 
Southern clan on what's left of an antebellum estate in Georgia is staged with 
marvelous aplomb by Shashin Desai. A strong cast, headed by Ron Boussom and 
Holgie Forrester as a hilariously avaricious couple, delivers an energy so 
bright that even the play's looming flaw is forgivable. 
</P>
<P>
That misstep, in a play that opened in Atlanta four years ago (followed by a 
seven-week run on Broadway in 1986), concerns a twin brother and sister incest 
theme brazenly played for poignancy. In the context of a romp, that's courting 
lunacy. But David Head and Ann Walker portray the latent lovers with such 
sublime discretion, and the events surrounding them are so risible, that you 
hardly mind this egregious tribute to Gothic romance. 
</P>
<P>
The play is something like "Little Foxes" meets "Daddy's Dyin' -- Who's Got the 
Will?" complete with a whiff of Faulkner's Snopes family and an aging, imposing 
housekeeper who has reason to throw her weight around (a salty performance by 
Patricia Belcher). 
</P>
<P>
Boussom and Forrester are terrific. He plays a blustering yahoo who wants to 
turn the family estate into a mall called Beulahland for Christian merchants, 
and she's his hugely pregnant Southern princess in frilly laces, gliding about 
looking like a tethered balloon. This pair has so totally absorbed technique 
that their acting is aerodynamic. 
</P>
<P>
When the goldilocked Forrester overhears that the black housekeeper almost 
certainly comes from the same lineage that spawned her righteous husband, her 
instinctive reaction is the production's most uproarious moment. 
</P>
<P>
The cast is ably balanced by Head's bemused, fading soap opera actor and 
Walker's cynical poet, who derides the family roots. Michael Sollenberger lends 
solid support as the lawyer handling the will with stolid decorum. 
</P>
<P>
This family whirligig, in an atmosphere redolent of delicate neglect, unspools 
in a vaguely raggedy, staircased living room and front porch set designed with 
an imaginative whoop by Don Gruber. 
</P>
<P>
From a certain angle, you can catch old Aunt Pearl in the coffin. Paulie 
Jenkins' tonal lighting, Deborah Slate's costumes, Chuck Estes' original music 
and Mario Mariotta's rain and lightning effect catch a manse under zany siege. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4901 E. Carson St. (near the northeast corner of Long Beach City College), 
Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 2 p.m. and 7:30 p.m., through June 11.

Like Josef Beuys and his piles of felt, Georg Herold has power that comes from 
the ability to decode and then recode the meanings of common things -- bricks, 
bits of clothing, pellets of caviar -- into a personal iconography that says a 
lot by refusing to say anything. This is not double talk; this is the strategy 
of an art that has decided that language and everything that flows from it is 
in such contextual flux that it must be sidestepped altogether. If anything, 
the work proves that this is not possible. 
</P>
<P>
Take the woman's nylon stocking, stretched and meticulously stitched onto a 
small wire armature. The piece is strangely menacing, erotic, whimsical, 
political and ultimately off-putting because it skirts our grasp and asserts 
itself as a weird presentation that is read as cogent art. A woman's bikini 
underwear is cut up and similarly mounted and in "Desatres de la democracia" 
(Disasters of Democracy), bits of real caviar coalesce into the vague numbered 
map or a combat plan. This piece and "Russian Cocaine" -- expensive Beluga 
caviar shellacked into black, shiny abstract art -- address geopolitical 
intrigue, the hypocrisy of Communist bureaucracies or the abstract reasoning 
that lets a symbol (in this case a numbered dot made from old fish eggs) 
successfully stand in for the complex concepts communication requires. Two 
handsome paintings that have bricks jutting out of their smoldering rust 
surfaces are the closest to pure formal finery. This is excellent but 
nihilistic work, intellectual and narcissistic in the extreme, seeing things so 
clearly that it finally concludes that all values, all ideologies, all 
signifiers are equally ineffective. This gives the work an annoying 
equivocation that only drives its point. (Daniel Weinberg Gallery, 625 N. 
Almont Drive, to June 17.) MARLENA DONOHUE

In the Bible, the universe was formed when order was divinely wrested from 
chaos, and the final expression of that was man. In Eastern philosophy, the 
universe was created from a harmonious standoff between light and dark, 
cohesion and dispersal, and the flesh was a fleeting illusion in the greater 
scheme. Los Angeles abstractionist Karen Carson gives us a visual analogue for 
the latter version in clever, energetic work that takes a tough theme and has a 
good time with it. 
</P>
<P>
In each canvas the background is roughly divided into a light, bright side 
where quickly painted (or in some cases spray painted) concentric circles in 
neon greens, pinks and oranges seem to explode and radiate sending out long 
colorful emanations that bleed into and converge with an adjacent area of 
darker tones. In the darker area a more stable shape, such as a diamond or an 
off-center square tipped on its side to look like a diamond, sends out its own 
visual vibrations of color and echoing shape. Shapes, colors, patterns mingle 
and collide to make engaging designs and illusionistic puzzles that often feel 
like corridors in a glass house or a maze. 
</P>
<P>
Carson adds tiny shards of glass to emphasize the trajectory of painted gesture 
or heighten the illusion of depth. The works are so full of information that 
you come in close to look and catch fleeting glimpses of yourself, passers-by, 
bits of the painting reflected onto itself and fun house reflections of the 
gallery space. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever transcendent philosophy lies behind the work, Carson is well schooled 
in Modernism and Post-Modernism as she adds actual wood moldings that hint at 
Synthetic Cubism or frames of paintings. (After all, isn't art the ultimate 
illusion?) These are visually charming works made better because there is room 
in Carson's crammed, holistic universe for humor. She titles works with 
metaphysical little ramblings borrowed from Disney songs and '50s lyrics, such 
as "I only have eyes for you" or ". . . makes no difference who you are."

It's obvious Kenny Scharf spent most of his youth in front of the TV set 
watching cartoons and their rapid-fire commercial messages. His paintings have 
always had the same kind of absurd innocence that tries to turn real-life scary 
stuff into harmless, garish amusement. This time out Scharf steps into the 
wheeling-dealing realm of consumerism. It's an area of hard sell idiocy that 
seems well matched by the artist's surreal sense of fun and games. 
</P>
<P>
These paintings are their own kind of hard sell. They couple simplified 
drawings of comic book characters and consumer objects with English-Spanish 
translations of key phrases such as "What is the price range?" and "I would 
like to buy!" There is something so blatantly obvious about a painting 
emblazoned with comments about its own marketability that the work gets giddy 
about being self-referential. Somehow this whimsy in primary colors, airbrush 
and finger paints doesn't feel funny, however. Scharf's cosmic comics don't 
defuse the malaise this time around. (Michael Kohn Gallery, 313 N. Robertson 
Blvd., to June 17.) SUVAN GEER

Carol Vena-Mondt uses old junk store black-and-white family-photo Christmas 
cards as springboards for large painted family portraits. Using only the bluish 
grays and whites of faded photos or those first '50s TV screens that aired "The 
Ed Sullivan Show," she duplicates postwar families oozing with the prosperity 
and down-home propriety that briefly marked life before Sen. McCarthy and 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
"The Hennings" are here, for example, with their goofy, spectacled mom and pop 
and a brood of progeny that only a parent could love. Exaggerating and 
distorting features with deep dark shadows, Vena-Mondt selectively turns period 
portraits into universal Rorschach tests onto which we graft a history: Is that 
a flicker of Oedipal defiance in the teen-age son who refuses to pose just like 
Daddy? Comedic and grotesque, these Middle Americans unwittingly invite us to 
glimpse the dark drama behind all our post-card greetings. 
</P>
<P>
Judie Bamber's lonely painted objects interact with potent titles to produce a 
loud, mysterious echo. Two small paintings are called "Excuse Me for Living." 
On the left is a lustrous gumdrop casting shadows on a bright, flat ground; on 
the right it is squished, its liquid contents spilling like viscera. Shiny and 
pristine as a Japanese koi study, "Oh Come On It Doesn't Hurt That Much" is a 
teeny, frail and very dead goldfish. Bamber's combination of damaged objects, 
loaded titles and seductive technique gets us thinking about personal 
vulnerability and the politics of intimacy, themes that become overt in the wry 
feminist statement "Closeness Is Easier When You Are Far Away." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Tony Greene builds on photos of nude male torsos and museum dioramas 
of "real" (stuffed) forest animals in "natural" habitats. He embeds these in 
thick, honey-hued varnishes and paints decorative florals around and through 
them, toying with distinctions between nature and artifice, fake and real. In 
"His Broken Lines," traces of an erotic male torso entwined with baroque thorns 
hints at crucifixion and the idea that religion and art bear the same proxy 
relationship to genuine passion that a stuffed deer bears to a romping doe.

Since the mid-'80s, ignoring or anticipating every foray of recent pluralism 
into Neo-Expressionism or Neo-Geometry, Scot Heywood has stayed steadfastly 
stuck on very reduced, hard-edge art. His first works were irregular 
arrangements of black and white panels; his last show limited the palette to 
black. He is still making those eccentric geometric compositions from combined 
rectangular panels painted a matte, uninflected ebony. 
</P>
<P>
Black can look sensually elegant and a too-quick perusal of this work might 
remind you of Ellsworth Kelly. But in Heywood's hand, the quiet fields, 
calibrated to reflect light and alternating ever so slightly between recession 
and tautness, strike a meditative rather than decorative chord. Rectangles are 
turned on their axes with corners pointing upward, then abutted by other 
slightly off-center and displaced rectangles to create a unified diamond 
format. 
</P>
<P>
Never sticking to right angles or equal-sided shapes, Heywood finds 
asymmetrical points of focus and tension that draw you in hypnotically. He 
still seems committed to using the barest information to pull you in for a 
close, long reverie during which vision, affect and meaning are meant to be 
pre-verbal and wholly experiential. These paintings aren't for everyone; you've 
got to be willing to stay long and lean close to "hear" them, so attenuated is 
their swan song. (Newspace, 5241 Melrose Ave., to June 10.). MARLENA DONOHUE

New York artist David Humphrey's surrealist paintings seem to come from a 
besieged public official's dream time. The images are strange yet make a weird 
kind of sense, as if the floating gaseous bladders, winged bells and formal 
gardens were all just unconscious symbols of an individual trying to deal with 
a too-complex civic responsibility. The style is a strangely serene mix of 
Magritte fantasy joined to a smooth, body-oriented, organic abstraction. The 
result is an unreal, highly symbolic world of distended viscera and odd bits of 
recognizable reality. 
</P>
<P>
The paintings are powerful, both in the way they are painted and in the 
symbolism that stays just outside of comprehension. Humphrey adds to the fray 
by spelling out the titles in disjointed lettering right on the canvases. This 
technique, suggesting the additive nature of collage, also mirrors his own 
slightly out of kilter means of communication that obscures as much as it 
reveals. Ultimately, however, it is the nagging sense that something vital is 
being addressed that makes deciphering the images seem important.

SAYING YES TO PERSIAN FOOD AT GLENDALE'S YAAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Once meat and potatoes, Glendale is now full of small, colorful ethnic 
restaurants -- places where you can sample the world's cuisines at suburban 
prices. Yaas Restaurant stands near the head of the list; it's one of the most 
authentic Persian kitchens around. Many of the dishes here compare favorably 
with similar ones served in Westwood, where the Farsi-speaking community is 
concentrated. Prices do too. 
</P>
<P>
Yaas (it means jasmine) bills itself as a Persian-Armenian dining room. On a 
quiet downtown street, it looks more like a ski lodge than a restaurant. The 
walls are paneled in stained wood, with plenty of disco-style mirrors hanging 
on them. But look more closely, and you notice that a dark Persian rug hangs on 
a back wall. Listen more carefully, and you hear mysterious music emanating 
faintly from speakers. In Glendale, exoticism is understated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
American Heart Assn. 
</P>
<P>
But what comes out of this kitchen certainly is not. Owner Madhu Gandhi's menu 
offers most of the traditional Persian favorites. Yet unlike many of those 
Persian restaurants in West L.A., several dishes are marked with hearts, 
indicating that they have been approved by the American Heart Assn. This is 
accomplished because Gandhi trims his meats religiously, using little oil in 
preparation. Much of his food is light and lean. 
</P>
<P>
The dishes that aren't marked with hearts are divinely heavy. In the best 
Persian tradition, these dishes are full of nuts, oils and the bounty of the 
region they represent. And despite the raised health consciousness of the 
management, they are the better dishes in the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Best of all is kashk budemjoon ($4.99), fried Japanese eggplant dripping with 
kashk, a fragrant, thickened yogurt. Atop the kashk is minced garlic, a crunchy 
fried spice topping made from dill, cilantro and plenty of olive oil. You dip 
the eggplants into the wonderful, piping hot, sesame-topped house bread, and 
sprinkle the whole thing with chopped fresh onion. If there is a more 
soul-satisfying appetizer in town I don't know about it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exotic Yogurt 
</P>
<P>
Other starters are good too. Dolmeh ($3.89), stuffed grape leaves, are more 
familiar to most, but these are dolmeh with a twist. Besides being far meatier 
than those in Greek or Lebanese restaurants, they are topped with garlic 
yogurt. Yogurt fanciers will be pleased to note that there are mint and shallot 
yogurts on the appetizer list. Just try to find those in your dairy case. 
</P>
<P>
The extensive kabob list is the heart of this menu, and probably what most 
people come for. I found the kabobs rather hit and miss. Barg ($8.99), a fillet 
steak in thin strips, had very little flavor, despite being lean and tender. 
Other Persian restaurants must use more marinade, or tastier meat. Ditto for 
the koobideh ($5.95), a long, tubular skewer of ordinary ground beef, which 
tasted Middle Western, rather than Middle Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, lamb chop kabobs ($11.95) were wonderful, meaty, juicy and 
flavored just right, with the meat falling from the bone. Shrimp kabobs 
($11.99) were equally fine, eight large, slightly blackened shrimp, with a 
pungent lemon-garlic butter as an inspired compliment. 
</P>
<P>
Good kabobs notwithstanding, I would say the stews and specialty dishes here 
make more pleasing main courses. They are homey and comforting, big enough to 
share, and more interesting. My favorite of these is fasenjoon ($7.99), chicken 
floating in an impossibly rich sauce made from walnuts, pomegranates and stock. 
The sauce is sweet and grainy, the texture of pipian (a Mexican sauce made from 
pumpkin seed). A few bites of it are enough to make anyone swoon. How one 
person is expected to eat the whole thing is anyone's best guess. 
</P>
<P>
Slightly lighter (but also plenty filling) is bagali pulo ($6.99), lamb shank 
in tomato stock with a lima bean rice overwhelmed by a mountainous heap of 
chopped dill. I'd personally choose the chicken cherry ($7.99), known in Farsi 
as albaloo pulo. Yaas' version is a tasty rice reddened by the juice of sour 
cherries that aren't really sour, flanked by an excellent flame-broiled chicken 
kabob. The chicken kabob itself is not on the menu, but is the best kabob the 
restaurant serves, tender, juicy and pleasantly spiced. The mild pungency of 
the rice balances it well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coffee and Dessert 
</P>
<P>
Try to save a little room for those sticky desserts. Persian ice cream ($2.65) 
is perfumed and creamy, loaded with pistachios and the scent of rose water. The 
Heart Assn. wouldn't come within miles of it. I like zoolbiah ($2.45), swirling 
rings of floured batter that are deep fried and drenched in honey; they remind 
me of the Tunisian pastry shops in Paris. And there is always that thick, 
sweet, muddy coffee, called Armenian coffee on the menu. I wondered why Yaas 
billed itself as a Persian-Armenian restaurant. I guess it must be the coffee. 
</P>
<P>

kabobs, $11.99; shrimp kabobs, $11.99; fasenjoon, $7.99; chicken cherry, $7.99.

HIGH DRAMA IN THE VALLEY; 
</P>
<P>
ARE PATRONS GETTING ENOUGH NEW, CHALLENGING PLAYS IN LOCAL THEATER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
On any given night, there are perhaps a hundred theater events to choose from 
in Los Angeles -- a good share of them in the San Fernando Valley. Many of the 
Valley houses are prosperous. But does that mean they're healthy? Is the work 
new, important, thoughtful, challenging? 
</P>
<P>
It depends on the theater, the artistic director -- and his or her audience. 
From Van Nuys to Burbank to North Hollywood to Woodland Hills, the creative, 
financial and qualitative scope of Valley theater is a wide one. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, community theater (composed of non-professionals) was standard. 
Now, most of the work is Equity Waiver. Many of the theaters are rented by 
outside producers -- with an occasional co-production by the landlord and a 
visiting artist. Some are membership companies. Of those, the longest-standing 
are Studio City's Theatre West (established in 1962), North Hollywood's Group 
Repertory (1973) and Sherman Oaks' Actors Alley (1973). 
</P>
<P>
"We do everything ourselves," said Group Rep's Lonnie Chapman, whose 99-seat 
theater has a subscription audience of 350, a mailing list of 5,000 and an 
annual budget of $62,500. Although he relies on revivals in his five 
productions per year, Chapman's real interest is in creating new work. The 
company includes 12 directors, 115 actors and 21 playwrights -- from whom 
Chapman has chosen his current repertory: Doug Haverty's musical "Roleplay" and 
Robert Ellis' Czechoslovakia-set "Perestroika." 
</P>
<P>
One of the company's biggest obstacles has been surviving a move that took 
place six years ago. "We lost almost all our subscriptions," lamented Chapman 
(whose attendance fluctuates from show to show, depending on reviews and word 
of mouth). "We're just now getting back to where we were." The average age of 
his audience is 40, he estimated, with a 70-30 split favoring Valley residents. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not happy with the status quo -- certainly not," he declared of the 
quality of theater around him. "But I think that will change. It's the 
responsibility of the artistic people not to say, 'Will this do well?' but 'Is 
this something that illuminates the human condition?' " 
</P>
<P>
At Theatre West, managing director Doug Marney presides over 186 seats and a 
mailing list of 3,000. He figures that most people in his audience are "Yuppies 
from the Valley, West Hollywood and Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
"We tend to do kind of experimental stuff," he said, "and that's bound not to 
get an older audience." Playing to an average capacity of 65% (their children's 
theater, however, always packs the house), Marney listed "Betty Garrett and 
Other Songs" and Brian Friel's "Freedom of the City" as the theater's 
best-received work. 
</P>
<P>
The company lists 250 members (125 actors, 25 writers, 25 directors and the 
rest musical and technical people) and an average of 10 productions -- budgeted 
at about $8,000 each -- per year. "I'd like to get to a point where we can 
produce on a regular basis, rather than when we have the money to produce," 
Marney said. "I do think audiences are growing. But sometimes audience support 
gets lost when there are too many theaters. Also, so much in our society is 
tied into celebrity worship. A show can't do well without a 'name' in it. And I 
think that's unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
Playwright-director Jeremiah Morris is the new artistic director at 65-seat 
Actors Alley, where he's inherited a 62-member company of "vibrant young people 
-- but a shortage of more mature actors: bona fide leading men in the 40 to 45 
year-old range." With an annual $125,000 budget ($6,000 to 7,000 is the average 
per show), the theater has a 5,000-person mailing list and an "over-30 
audience, a cross-section of professional people and lower-echelon Yuppies." 
Attendance vacillates between 50% to 90% capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Planning a season of six productions, Morris (who's currently presenting George 
Bernard Shaw's "Widowers' Houses") already has an impression of theater's 
position "in a town dedicated to film and television. Ninety-eight percent of 
the people who do theater don't do it for theater," he said sadly, "but as an 
audition piece for some TV show." 
</P>
<P>
Morris -- who also oversees Actors Alley's improv group, the Alley Oops, and a 
"living newspaper project" (which dramatizes news stories) with Cal State 
Northridge -- isn't shy about voicing his complaints. "Everybody wants to act, 
but nobody wants to put up sets," he said. Neither is he fond of the audience 
makeup: "We've got a problem. We don't have minorities -- blacks, Hispanics, 
Asians; we do not have an inner-city audience. I also want to build an audience 
with hearing-impaired in the Valley. But it's hard." 
</P>
<P>
One thing that no one's worrying about is the presence of women. The roster of 
females at the helm includes Laura Zucker, co-producing director (with Allan 
Miller) of Van Nuys' Back Alley Theatre; Maria Gobetti, co-artistic director 
(with Tom Ormeny) of Burbank's Victory Theatre; artistic director Cynthia Baer 
Wynant of the Richard Basehart Theatre in Woodland Hills, and managing director 
Alicia O'Connor of the Donald O'Connor's Family Theatre (formerly the Show 
Place) in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
With 93 seats and a mailing list of 18,000, the 10-year old Back Alley is one 
of the most respected theaters in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Among its more than 30 productions, its hits have included "The Fox," "Are You 
Now or Have You Ever Been?," "In the Sweet Bye and Bye," "What's Wrong With 
This Picture?," "Walk on the Wild Side" and the recent "Voice of the Prairie." 
Said Zucker: "We're increasingly interested in pieces that involve music; we've 
been averaging one a year. I think there's a great need to develop small 
musicals. But it takes more money." (Her annual budget is $350,000.) 
</P>
<P>
On the subject of money, Zucker -- who's been one of the producers most 
vociferously involved in the ongoing negotiations with Actors Equity -- gets 
downright glum. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a hit show. But with the new 99-Seat Plan," she noted, referring to 
Equity's stipulation that 30% of the box office take go to the actors, "I can't 
pay the rent. I mean, I can pay it, but it's hard. For an ongoing institution, 
that becomes a real problem." Zucker points to the recent closings of two 
Valley theaters -- the Megaw and Room for Theatre. "The financial pressure of 
running an organization like this is absolutely horrendous," she emphasized. 
"It grinds away at you, year after year." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Zucker has no intention of giving up -- or moving her business to a more 
fashionable setting. "The point is, everyone's doing it on Melrose," she said, 
laughing. "We live here, we work here. When we first decided to open in the 
Valley, everyone said, 'You're crazy.' Now they say, 'You're so smart.' " 
</P>
<P>
She sees no difference between her patrons and those in Hollywood: "Our 
audiences tend to be older -- but that's true across the United States. 
Everyone's audience is tipped towards the over-40. Still, we are looking for 
plays that would interest a younger audience." Zucker, who believes that it 
takes three to five years to develop a relationship with an audience, described 
the one with her own patrons as a healthy "tug of war." 
</P>
<P>
"It's like you're on one end of the rope and they're on the other, each pulling 
the other in the direction you want to go," she said. "Yes, we had a big 
success with 'What's Wrong With This Picture?' -- a Jewish play. Yet 'Sand 
Mountain' was definitely not a Jewish play. A lot of our audiences tend to be 
Jewish, as they are across the county. But if you're only giving people what 
they want to see and are used to seeing, why bother? 
</P>
<P>
"No, you don't want to go so far out that no one comes. But you've got to 
stretch. Sometimes you guess right, sometimes you're wrong. Sometimes you feel 
brave. I wish we could afford to be braver." 
</P>
<P>
The 9-year old Victory Theatre, (which recently completed a premiere run of 
David Higgins' "Bonu$ Baby") also has a reputation for favoring new work, 
including John Kostmayer's "On the Money" and "The History of Fear" and John 
Ford Noonan's "Talking Things Over with Chekhov." 
</P>
<P>
"We choose to do original material by American playwrights -- exhibiting our 
taste and hoping people will like it," said Maria Gobetti, who also teaches 
three acting classes at the theater. "Yes, we have to stay in business -- but 
we're not going to do sure-fire theater." 
</P>
<P>
With two theater spaces (99 and 48 seats), an annual budget of $180,000 divided 
between three main-stage productions and two small-stage ones, and a mailing 
list of 16,000 (she's in the process of paring it down), Gobetti sees her 
audiences "as the same people -- age-wise, and everything else-wise -- who go 
to theater all over the city. They come from the Valley, Hollywood, the 
Westside, Toluca Lake, Glendale, Encino . . . but not a lot from Burbank." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Cynthia Baer Wynant of the Richard Basehart Theatre (which 
rented at the West End for two years before establishing its new home in 
January, 1988,) feels that her audience is very local, drawing well from 
Northridge and Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people don't want to go over the hill, leave the Valley at night," 
she pointed out. And they want to be home -- in bed -- by 10 p.m. We do get 
some young people from Pierce or CSUN or young marrieds with children. But our 
main audience is the older group." (There is a mailing list of 2,000, but so 
far only 100 subscription sales.) 
</P>
<P>
Sixty actors, writers and directors make up the company -- with "charter 
members" such as Angie Dickinson, Shirley Jones and Shaun Cassidy swelling the 
celebrity ranks; David Doyle of "Charlie's Angeles" was a draw last year in 
A.R. Gurney Jr.'s "The Perfect Party." (Other first-year fare included "Little 
Mary Sunshine" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream.") 
</P>
<P>
If it isn't the most adventurous fare, Wynant -- whose per-production budgets 
average $12,000 -- has no apologies: "I don't think we have people coming here 
who endlessly want to see new things. Perhaps they'll try something new, but 
they want to be comfortable. So maybe we'll do new things one or two times a 
year . . . but no more." 
</P>
<P>
The O'Connor Theatre's Alicia O'Connor (who was featured last March in the 
68-seat theater's debut production of "Charley's Aunt" with her father, Donald) 
is finding herself in the same boat -- with some reluctance. "Dad really wants 
us to do the standards," she noted. "I want to do plays with meat on them -- 
not avant garde, but things that'll make people think. The one I want to do 
next has Asians, whites and blacks. At the end of the year I want to have as 
many people showcased as I can." 
</P>
<P>
With such a short track record, O'Connor is not quite sure of who makes up her 
audience, where they come from or if they'll be back. 
</P>
<P>
"Charley's Aunt" did extremely well -- but the $50,000 that came from it has 
already disappeared into back-payments and production costs for her last show, 
Robert Morse's staging of "I Do! I Do!" O'Connor inherited the Show Place's 
500-person subscription list but has found signing them up slow so far. "On our 
first show, we didn't have a lot of discounts," she explained. "And a lot of 
our audience are seniors. Now we have those discounts in place -- for seniors, 
students, groups." 
</P>
<P>
Another relative newcomer to the Valley scene is Ed Gaynes, who took over 
artistic directorship of the 5-year-old, 84-seat West End Playhouse in Van Nuys 
on Jan. 1 of this year. "It's hard for Equity Waiver to get any visibility," he 
said with a sigh. "A lot of people who'll go to houses like the Pantages won't 
go to Waiver." To help subsidize the theater's budget of $15,000 to $25,000, 
the space has often been used as a rental. 
</P>
<P>
Predecessor Michael Bell "was doing classy comedies: British, French; there's 
an audience really in tune with that." With a mailing list of 5,000 (and no 
specific number of productions planned per year) Gaynes notices "no problem 
with people crossing over the hill to come here. It's a very loyal audience. 
But I want to branch out. I'm talking to Joan Darling about doing some plays. 
It's a constant struggle, though. You don't go into this to make money. You do 
it to give life to new projects." 
</P>
<P>
For some, it means starting from the ground up. In 1985, Jeff Seymour renovated 
a deli on Magnolia Boulevard in North Hollywood and turned it into the Gnu 
Theatre. Since then, Gnu premieres include Bill Barker's "Best Wishes," John 
Ford Noonan's "Spanish Confusion" and Rafael Lima's "El Salvador" -- which was 
awarded outstanding writing, directing and production honors at the 1989 Los 
Angeles Drama Critics Circle Awards. He is preparing Barbara Bishop's 
"Siblings," which opens in June. 
</P>
<P>
In-house work is one of the Gnu's secrets of success. On a $5,000 budget 
("often less") Seymour -- who lives next door to the theater -- hires the 
actors, builds the sets, designs the lights, directs the shows, handles 
publicity, and often seats patrons. He also teaches acting classes at the 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we started, the audience and box office have grown wonderfully -- with 
little variance," he said. "I attribute it mostly to the shows doing well 
critically. People hear about them; they tell others. If you have any 
competence, you tend to get better. Then you get more press and it keeps 
building." 
</P>
<P>
As for audience makeup, Seymour, who has a mailing list of 4,500 for the 
50-seat house, sees "mostly over-35, white-collar college graduates." Half come 
from the Valley, half from the 213 area code. "But to me, there's no 
distinction between Valley and other theater. Aside from the geographic 
location and a slightly different image, humans are the same." 
</P>
<P>
At the 99-seat Burbank Theatre Guild (in its community theater days, the 
Burbank Little Theatre), artistic director Gary Blumsack is also attracting a 
varied crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people come from the east side of the hills in Hollywood," said 
Blumsack, who's run the theater for two years. "We've also got a lot of studio 
people; it's a heavily traveled industry house. We're five minutes from Warner 
Brothers, Columbia, the Burbank Studios, Orion. People also come from Van Nuys, 
Sherman Oaks, Encino, Glendale. We don't tend to pull a lot from Burbank; it's 
still a very conservative town. But the city of Burbank has been terrific. They 
gave us this building" rent-free. 
</P>
<P>
He has also recognized the value of a celebrity cast: "I called in my markers, 
got all my friends with series to come." Although that has led to successful 
revivals ("Wait Until Dark" with Doug McClure and Greg Mullavey in 1986), 
Blumsack is looking forward with more excitement to his upcoming premieres: Lee 
Blessing's "Independence" and a play by Dana Coen, whose "Sympathy" ran at the 
theater in 1988. "I'm looking for original work," Blumsack said, "and hoping 
it'll translate into film. Hey, it worked for Joe Papp." 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the aches and pains -- financial and otherwise -- of running a 
small theater, there is little indication that producers are becoming fatally 
discouraged. Of course, only a handful (the Back Alley, Group Rep, the Victory, 
Burbank Theatre Guild and the Gnu) have budgets that include advertising -- and 
then usually on a limited basis. "I'm not a great believer in spending too much 
on ads," said Gaynes. "Too costly," said Wynant. "We don't have the money," 
Marney said bluntly. 
</P>
<P>
The producers are considerably warmer when it comes to evaluating each other's 
work -- though the opportunities to sample it are admittedly scarce. Morris, 
who says, "I've seen some very exciting theater and some very bad theater," 
ranks the Back Alley, Group Rep and Theatre West as his picks. Chapman also 
cited the Back Alley and Theatre West. O'Connor picked Theatre West and the 
Chamber (generally a rental), Blumsack the Victory, Back Alley and Gnu. Gobetti 
picked the Back Alley -- "and I like our stuff too." 
</P>
<P>
At a time when VCRs and cable have made stay-at-home entertainment an easy 
alternative to the rigors of theatergoing, these producers (and their Westside 
counterparts) find themselves in a common boat: vying for good work and for 
larger audiences. If theatergoing has not been a priority of Valley residents 
in the past, these producers are determined to steer a new course. "I've seen 
only an increase in patrons," Blumsack said firmly. "L.A. theater is growing 
up; we're not the poor relation anymore. And we're not going away."

AT THE GALLERIES / DAVID LEWINSON: BOSMAN WORKS ARE FULL OF WATER, BUT STILL 
COME OFF DRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LEWINSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Landscape hasn't been much more than a sideshow in avant-garde art for what 
seems like eons -- since Postimpressionism, about 100 years ago. But it may be 
making a comeback. In the way it splits down the middle, "Richard Bosman: Gifts 
of the Sea" abruptly signals this possibility. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 13 works on view at UC San Diego's Mandeville Gallery, seven produced 
from 1980 to 1986 focus on the figure set in a variety of marine contexts. In 
six works from 1986 to the present, the figure disappears entirely, and only 
the seascape remains. 
</P>
<P>
The style of these seascapes, which constitute a type of landscape, evades 
classification. The earlier figurative works, however, clearly reveal this 
43-year-old artist's major debt to neo-expressionism, a European-born style 
that hit American shores in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Bosman's 1980 "Floating Head" employs typically neo-expressionist 
brushwork and scratchy, nearly sculptural handling of form to produce an image 
of a frightened blue face vomiting blood and bobbing bodiless in a cold patch 
of sea. 
</P>
<P>
Another 1980 work, "The Rope," depicts a terror-filled figure falling into the 
sea from the rigging of a sailing ship. "Beached," from 1985, shows a man and a 
woman heaped together on the shore amid remnants of a shipwreck. (The woman, 
somehow, still wears her red high-heel shoes, and her lipstick is perfect.) 
</P>
<P>
This group of figure-involving imagery then ends with the 1986 "Studio Scene: 
Adrift," in which a painter sprawls face-down, apparently dead, on a flat chunk 
of Arctic ice, with only brushes, tubes of paint, a palette and a blank canvas 
for company. 
</P>
<P>
Given the deadly nature of these last images, it's not so surprising to see 
Bosman jump ship and end 1986 as a landscape, or rather a seascape, painter. 
The main thing he seems to carry with him from the maritime miseries he 
previously painted is a quite adept skill in representing water, in making the 
plastic qualities of paint tightly equivalent to the look of the frothing, 
foaming, rolling and tossing of the sea. 
</P>
<P>
There's undeniable delight in seeing this skill in operation, but it's not all 
that unique or inventive. A classic Dutch still life offers similar, although 
more delicate, experience in which a quick streak of white pigment highlights 
the rim of a goblet or the shiny skin of a piece of fruit. But this is skill, 
not art; or certainly not all there is to art. 
</P>
<P>
Proof of this lies in the generally banal impact of the seascapes that emerges 
from Bosman's hand beginning in 1986. In all of these, at least two and as many 
as 10 separate panels are combined in a single frame. "Shoreline," from 1986, 
combines three separate scenes of relatively tame waves running up a sandy 
beach. The multiple panels invoke time and changing conditions; but the 
reference barely obscures the triteness of the imagery. It's more like you get 
three paintings -- and three looks at Bosman's paint -- for the price of one. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1987 painting "Beacon," two panels depict day and night views of a 
lighthouse isolated on a spit of land. Bosman handles the inherently subtle 
colors well enough, and his paint here is even more alluring than in previous 
works. While this indicates that his considerable skill in manipulating paint 
is continuing to grow, we're again confronted with post card imagery that seems 
to be no more than an excuse for Bosman to do his painterly shtick. 
</P>
<P>
In "Awash" (1988), there's even a hint that the artist recognizes the 
vulnerability of what he's doing. The upper panel of the two-part image shows 
an unmanned skiff facing into the swells of a white-capped sea. The lower panel 
shows only the skiff's mast sticking out above waters that are now calm. 
Whether the wry wit of the story implied by the image is intentional is 
difficult to determine. 
</P>
<P>
The dubious usefulness of Bosman's multiple panels reaches its pinnacle in "Sea 
States," a 1988 work in which 10 images in two horizontal rows produce an 
overall work measuring 5 by 15 feet. The individual scenes present a sequence 
of states of agitation in the open sea, from calm to extremely violent. 
</P>
<P>
The colorations of the water and the sky follow similar variation, from 
soothing blues and greens to turbid greens, yellows and grays. But while each 
single panel suggests itself as a study for some eventual masterpiece, locked 
together they cancel each other out, like mixing hot and cold water. 
</P>
<P>
If the goal of the multiple images is to subdue the emotional responses that 
any one of the scenes might provoke, that would constitute a rationale of a 
sort and would be consistent with the exhaustion of emotional reserves 
expressed in "Studio Series: Adrift," Bosman's last figurative work. 
Nevertheless, for all its technical accomplishment and aqueous imagery, this 
painting is pretty dry stuff. 
</P>
<P>
As to what Bosman's work has to say about a possible resurgence of interest in 
landscape -- seascape being a subset of landscape -- the message is only the 
most general one: that something is happening. Bosman has sensed this and 
picked up on it, just as he seems to have quickly adopted neo-expressionism 
when it arrived from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
This new interest in landscape may result from something as simple as artists 
finding that abstraction and figuration are depleted for now, while the domain 
of landscape has been lying fallow long enough to have become ripe for harvest 
again. There also may be something more subtle occurring: a reflection of the 
deepening recognition that the landscape that the industrial revolution started 
to pollute in a big way around the time of Postimpressionism has now become so 
abused that it threatens to return the favor and kill us. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps we're responding.

JUNIOR HIGH STUDENT WHO STABBED TEACHER GIVEN 8-YEAR SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A ninth-grade student convicted of stabbing his Olive Vista Junior High School 
teacher in the back when she attempted to discipline him during class was 
sentenced Thursday to the California Youth Authority for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old youth was convicted last month of assault with a deadly weapon 
on a school employee after admitting to the March 6 stabbing of his English 
teacher, Cynthia Edwards, 37, of Palmdale. A 3-inch knife was embedded to the 
hilt in the back of Edward's shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
She was hospitalized for five days after the incident, and prosecutors said 
Thursday that she may never return to work because of the physical and 
psychological damage she has suffered. 
</P>
<P>
Before the youth's sentencing in Sylmar Juvenile Hall, Deputy Dist. Atty. Craig 
R. Richman read a letter that Edwards had written to the court: 
</P>
<P>
"I am still enraged and frustrated when I think of such a senseless act that 
has plunged my life down a rather nebulous path toward the future," the letter 
read. "Am I bitter? Am I angry? Yes. My career has possibly gone. Fifteen years 
of dedicated teaching has been violently pre-empted because a young man did not 
want to accept a meager punishment . . . for his disruptive behavior in class." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, who has had only limited use of her right hand since the attack, 
wrote: "I am still in the initial recuperative stages, psychologically and 
physically, of my victimization in this mishap." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards had called the boy to the front of the classroom after he had disturbed 
other students discussing Homer's "The Odyssey" by using profanity. The teacher 
was writing a referral slip to send the boy to another room for the remainder 
of the class when he walked up behind her and stabbed her in the back. 
</P>
<P>
The boy showed no emotion as Judge Morton Rochman pronounced sentence at the 
end of the two-hour hearing attended by the youth's parents and three sisters. 
Although committed for a maximum detention time of eight years at a California 
Youth Authority facility, a prison for young people, the boy could be eligible 
for parole in two to four years, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Mark R. Frazin, expressed 
disappointment with the judge's decision to send his client to a Youth 
Authority facility. "The judge was responding to pressure from the public and 
not the needs of the minor," Frazin said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Counseling Urged 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Frazin argued that the boy needed extensive psychological counseling 
and should be placed in another, less severe county-run facility, where he 
could receive such help. 
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, Frazin called several witnesses, including two Olive Vista 
Junior High School teachers, to testify on his client's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Williams, a physical education teacher, said that he had known the boy 
only a short time but that "he was always concerned about improving himself and 
becoming a better athlete." 
</P>
<P>
Teacher Rochele Minutella said she had known the youth for three years and had 
a close relationship with him. Minutella described the boy as "very loving and 
warm." 
</P>
<P>
Minutella said the boy had come to her before the stabbing and complained to 
her about Edwards, saying that the teacher was harassing him. Minutella said 
that the boy "asked for help to get out" of Edwards' class but that the "school 
didn't respond to his need for help." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not a Violent Person' 
</P>
<P>
She said when the boy came to her immediately after the stabbing and told her 
what he had done, "I didn't believe him because he is not a violent person." 
</P>
<P>
However, Richman said, since the youth was taken into custody, he has engaged 
in several fights with Juvenile Hall employees. 
</P>
<P>
Richman said that on April 7 the boy allegedly threatened to kill staff members 
when he is finally released from custody. In another incident on April 20, the 
boy had to be restrained from hitting employees, Richman said.

BUILDING WAS SCENE OF EXCITING TIMES FOR L.A. SPORTS FANS

"Going to the Pan" was but a memory for sports enthusiasts when the old 
auditorium burned Wednesday. And for many who played or watched college 
basketball there, news that the Pan Pacific Auditorium was finally gone meant 
that a lot of memories also went up in smoke. 
</P>
<P>
"It took a little bit out of me when I heard about it," said Al Buch, a 
one-time UC Berkeley basketball standout who in 1959 beat UCLA with a 
last-second shot at the Pan Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
In the days before the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, the Pan Pacific, 
Olympic and Shrine auditoriums were Southern California's major indoor sports 
facilities. The 15,000-seat Sports Arena opened in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
The Pan Pacific, completed in 1937, is best remembered by Southland sports fans 
as the site of many USC and UCLA basketball games for 20 years, Harlem 
Globetrotters games, Amateur Athletic Union basketball games, and college and 
minor league ice hockey. 
</P>
<P>
"I have fond memories of those days, in the 1950s, of coming to L.A. on 
basketball trips, and staying at the Hollywood Knickerbocker Hotel," said Buch, 
of Studio City. "The Pan was an intimate place. It only seated about 6,000 for 
basketball, but with an exciting game, the noise level was very high." 
</P>
<P>
Al Wesson, a former USC sports information director, remembers some bloody 
college ice hockey games at the Pan Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
"USC and Loyola had a fierce ice hockey rivalry at the Pan years ago," he said. 
"USC had a bunch of Canadians on the team, and Loyola had a bunch of Wisconsin 
kids. Notre Dame came out and played us (USC) one year. We had a coach, Arnold 
Eddy, who couldn't even skate." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shrine, Olympic Fading 
</P>
<P>
Time may be running out on two other old Los Angeles indoor sports facilities: 
</P>
<P>
* The 5,500-seat Shrine Auditorium, built in the 1920s, where nearby USC once 
played basketball on the stage, faces an uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
* The 8,200-seat Olympic Auditorium, also built in the 1920s and still the only 
arena in America built exclusively for boxing, has been boarded up for more 
than a year. USC played basketball games there in the 1930s and 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
The Pan Pacific was never UCLA's home basketball court, but the school did play 
selected home games there from 1949 until 1959 because the building seated more 
than the old UCLA men's gym. USC's basketball teams played home games at the 
Pan Pacific from 1949 through 1959.

PLANS TO RENOVATE THE AUDITORIUM GO UP IN SMOKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
To the satisfaction of some of its neighbors, the historic Pan Pacific 
Auditorium's destruction almost certainly marked a fiery end to controversial 
plans for commercial renovation of the cavernous and long-vacant indoor arena. 
</P>
<P>
With the still-smoking building and a fire engine as backdrop, officials who 
had backed the county-sponsored plans for a $14.6-million renovation of the 
site said Thursday that they would be lucky to salvage the 54-year-old 
building's striking Streamline Moderne facade. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make sure that we can save . . . the remnants of what was a very 
historic building," Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, fire investigators said they had not determined the cause of the 
Wednesday night fire -- officially labeled suspicious -- but were pursuing 
reports that two unauthorized men had been seen inside the boarded-up building 
just before the blaze broke out shortly after 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman and Los Angeles City Councilmen John Ferraro and Zev Yaroslavsky 
advised developers to abandon plans to restore Pan Pacific, which has been 
vacant since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the renovation had feared that the reopening -- which would have 
included an ice-skating rink, theaters and shops -- would bring crime, traffic, 
late-night noises, graffiti and parking problems to the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman said further that any attempt to build a structure on the same scale as 
the Pan Pacific on the site at 7600 Beverly Boulevard "would be met with very 
strong opposition." 
</P>
<P>
Robin Gostin, a vocal opponent of county restoration plans, concurred. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sad to see the monument gone, but I'm not sad to see the building gone," 
said Gostin, vice president of the Rancho La Brea Neighborhood Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from trying to save the architecturally distinctive facade, Ferraro said 
planning for the site should center on more modest uses, such as senior housing 
or parking for the Pan Pacific county park, which is just south of the arena. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky, who lives four blocks from the auditorium, added that the fire had 
created "a broader set of options" because restoration plans for the structure, 
listed on the National Register of Historic Places, had been proceeding under 
strict guidelines. As an example, he said, among the options that had been 
barred by the restoration requirements was relocation of the facade to Beverly 
Boulevard, where space is available. 
</P>
<P>
While officials contemplated what could be done with the site, others mourned 
the loss of what was once the premier indoor sports and entertainment facility 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame, really," said Amarjit S. Marwah, president of the Los Angeles 
Cultural Heritage Commission. "We have so few historic structures." 
</P>
<P>
Christy McAvoy, the Los Angeles Conservancy's preservation expert, said the Pan 
Pacific was "Los Angeles' primary example of Streamline Moderne, the 
architectural style (of the 1930s) which articulated the country's love of 
transportation, speed and progress." 
</P>
<P>
Its style stemmed from the personal taste of Clifford W. Henderson, developer 
of the Pan Pacific, who loved aviation. 
</P>
<P>
"He liked things with uplift," his widow, Marian Henderson, said. Henderson 
held a design contest, and the then-2-year-old firm of Welton Becket won with 
its facade featuring rounded wing-like pylons. Officials of the firm, which 
became internationally known because of the Pan Pacific, came to the site 
Thursday with an offer to assist in any restoration effort. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been supportive of efforts to preserve the building and especially the 
western facade," said Louis M. Naidorf, senior vice president of Ellerbe 
Becket, the successor firm. "It is the city's history and our firm's history as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Jay Rounds, executive director of the preservationist Los Angeles Conservancy, 
called for a grass-roots effort to assist in restoration similar to the 
extraordinary volunteer outpouring after the 1986 fires at the Los Angeles 
Central Library. 
</P>
<P>
"The library has come back," said Rounds. "Now we are challenged by the fire at 
Pan Pacific." 
</P>
<P>
The county had reached a preliminary agreement in November with the 
architectural and development team of Kornwasser &amp; Friedman/Goldrich &amp; 
Kest. It called for the county to receive an estimated $3.8 million in rent in 
the first 10 years of the project. Officials hoped the money would defray the 
cost of maintaining the state-owned Pan Pacific Park, which adjoins the 
auditorium site and is administered by the county. 
</P>
<P>
With a total area of 116,700 square feet, the renovation project would have 
cost an estimated $14.6 million, according to documents submitted to the 
supervisors in November. It would have included an ice-skating rink, gymnastics 
facility, movie theaters, food court, restaurants, a sporting goods shop, park 
offices and meeting rooms for community groups. 
</P>
<P>
Although the project had not received final approval, it had been making 
progress in overcoming bureaucratic hurdles. The deadline for commenting on a 
draft environmental impact report was next month. 
</P>
<P>
None of which escaped neighborhood opponents of the plans who came out in force 
to watch the fire. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were standing outside watching this incredible blaze, everybody had 
some memories of the Pan Pacific. It's something we shared together and that 
was beautiful. But we certainly don't need the commercial use there now," 
Gostin said. 
</P>
<P>
Now a Fairfax High School teacher, Gostin was raised nearby and has fond 
memories of going to the auditorium to see the Harlem Globetrotters and the Ice 
Capades. 
</P>
<P>
But her attitude changed as fears of crime and congestion grew. Graffiti and 
late-night noise were bad enough when the building stood empty, Gostin said. If 
anything commercial were to go in, the situation would only get worse, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Fire Marshal Craig Drummond said preliminary interviews with a man 
reported near the scene during the early moments of the fire indicated that he 
was a passer-by who stopped to help. Drummond added that the man, whose 
identity has not been released, is not an arson suspect. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said investigators were trying to confirm two reports that two men 
who did not have permission to be inside the Pan Pacific were spotted there 
just before the fire.

MEASURE ON PAP SMEAR STANDARDS ADVANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to concerns about the accuracy of Pap smears used in the early 
detection of cervical cancer, the Assembly on Thursday overwhelmingly passed a 
bill to toughen standards for laboratories and the technicians who evaluate the 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a matter of life or death for women," said Assemblywoman Sally Tanner 
(D-Baldwin Park), author of the measure, which passed 55 to 9. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, which now goes to the Senate, places a limit on the number of Pap 
test slides a technician can review during any eight-hour day and requires both 
labs and technicians to be tested regularly for accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
A similar measure was passed by the Legislature last year but vetoed by Gov. 
George Deukmejian. The governor complained of what he called "a major 
intervention into the private sector by government" without evidence that 
California women are being hurt because of unreliable Pap tests. 
</P>
<P>
But Tanner and other supporters of the legislation argued that there now is 
ample evidence that a serious problem exists. 
</P>
<P>
Tanner cited the case of one of the biggest clinical laboratories in the 
country, Central Pathology Services Medical Group in Tarzana. The lab was shut 
down by state health officials last month after inspectors found that 21% of 
Pap tests in a sample of 1,103 had been diagnosed in error, according to a 
spokesman for the Department of Health Services. Most alarming was the finding 
that 143 of those slides -- 13% of the total -- were incorrectly diagnosed as 
showing no sign of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
State officials complained that Central Pathology technicians were examining 
more than 100 slides a day each -- too many to be accurate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Annual Load 
</P>
<P>
The lab annually handled nearly 700,000 tests that had been sent by physicians 
from California and other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Pap smears -- named for Dr. George Papanicolaou, who developed the procedure -- 
can detect 90% of cervical cancers at a stage when they still can be 
effectively treated. A standard physician's reference book credits the test 
with reducing deaths from cervical cancer by 50%. 
</P>
<P>
But physicians depend on the accuracy of pathology labs to prepare and evaluate 
slides made from cells scraped from a woman's cervix and vagina. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Tanner bill, the technicians, called cytotechnologists, would be 
licensed and regularly tested by the state. And laboratories would have to 
recheck a sampling of slides regularly.

FOR THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
A Times story May 26 on legislation affecting laboratories that process Pap 
smears incorrectly stated the results of a state inspection of Central 
Pathology Services Medical Group in Tarzana. The story should have said that 
state reviewers found 143 cases in which Central Pathology failed to diagnose 
possible signs of disease. In 123 cases, the state reviewers found conditions 
frequently linked to the development of cancer and requiring follow-up, but no 
instances of cancer. The laboratory disputes the state's findings.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PHELPS TAKES HELM OF COLLEGE DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Donald Phelps, a longtime Seattle educator and community leader, was 
inaugurated Thursday as the new chancellor of the Los Angeles Community College 
District, the largest junior college system in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Phelps, 56, is the first black to lead the nine-college system, whose 
population of more than 100,000 students is more than 70% ethnic minorities. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 people, including Mayor Tom Bradley and some of the new 
chancellor's close friends from Seattle, filled the Grand Theater at Los 
Angeles Trade-Technical College for the formal installation ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, who graduated from a two-year program at the college, praised Phelps 
as a man with a "lifelong commitment" to education and a strong concern to help 
the economically disenfranchised. 
</P>
<P>
Taking the podium after being officially sworn in, Phelps praised the 
district's 7,500 teachers and staff members for their dedication and commitment 
to education as a way to better the lives of disadvantaged students. 
</P>
<P>
"I pay tribute today to a faculty and staff that is selfless because they have 
chosen to take on a tough job, he said."

Police and sheriff's deputies were still searching Thursday for a pair of armed 
robbers who allegedly shot and killed one man and wounded a store owner during 
a violent, three-store robbery spree in the San Gabriel Valley Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The robbers, masked and clad in black, stole a sports car at gunpoint at a West 
Covina shopping mall before holding up two "mom and pop" stores in Rosemead and 
El Monte and a Duarte pizza franchise over a two-hour period, authorities said. 
The pair later eluded deputies after a high-speed chase early Wednesday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said the frequency and close proximity of the hold-ups made them 
unusual. 
</P>
<P>
During the robbery of the Marketplace, a small general store in El Monte, Yung 
Suk Yoon of Diamond Bar, the store's 31-year-old manager, was shot and killed. 
Yoon, whose family owns the store, apparently struggled with the robbers, said 
El Monte Police Detective Gary Walker.

You know how it is with celebrities: The bigger they get, the more they must be 
isolated from the curious public. 
</P>
<P>
So it is with Grunt, the 800-pound porker who received nationwide attention 
last month when it was revealed that he faced death because his owners had 
abandoned him in Rolling Hills Estates. More than 400 people, including an 
Australian man, subsequently offered to take in the big swine. 
</P>
<P>
The county eventually sent him to the 193-acre ranch of Ozzie Osborn (no 
relation to the singer) in Santa Paula. Santa Paula isn't known for excitement, 
but since the pig's arrival, there have been so many gawkers that the family 
has been forced to place Grunt temporarily in a large coop. 
</P>
<P>
"You never know what could happen with some stranger," said Osborn's wife, 
Rhonda. "We'll turn him loose when all the hubbub dies down. But in the 
meantime, he has a nice mudhole in there." 
</P>
<P>
She said Grunt pays no attention to visitors unless they "have something to 
feed him." 
</P>
<P>
Oh, maybe one other thing would put Grunt in hog heaven. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband," said Osborn, "is thinking of buying a female for him." 
</P>
<P>
Looks as though strike negotiators for the Los Angeles City Board of Education 
ignored the advice of astrologer Joyce Jillson, whose at-large forecast to the 
world on Wednesday said in part: 
</P>
<P>
"Don't try to negotiate unless you have all the strength. Students and 
employees may get the better of their supervisors." 
</P>
<P>
It was Ditch Day at Caltech Thursday, the annual opportunity for underclassmen 
to show off their skills in such games as the old 
Assemble-the-Automobile-Parts-on-My-Doorstep-Into-a-Functioning-Chevrolet-Engine 
trick. 
</P>
<P>
Combining the best (and worst) of "Star Wars" and "Animal House," the event 
also enables seniors to let off steam from the pressure of academics. What they 
do is lock up their rooms in imaginative ways and challenge their inferiors to 
unravel the secret of gaining entry. 
</P>
<P>
The engine, for instance, had to be assembled because only when it was turned 
on could exhaust be directed into a tube that would trigger the opening 
mechanism on the dormitory door. 
</P>
<P>
Not all the puzzles required complex thinking. 
</P>
<P>
Students at Page Hall dormitory were challenged to break through a front door 
covered on the outside with layers of plaster, plywood, and steel plating, and 
on the inside with layers of concrete, wood and steel -- by 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently," Caltech spokesman Bob Finn said, "no one had lived in the room 
for the last few weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Using such scientific instruments as blow torches, the students bore in only as 
far as the concrete, which contained a shaving cream can that blew up in their 
faces. 
</P>
<P>
A flag flap looms in a Lakewood development. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate agent Becky Turner, who places miniature American flags on the 
front lawn of Lakewood Gardens residences each Memorial Day, sent out a note to 
the inhabitants declaring that she would repeat the custom even though "I have 
been asked by another Realtor not to do the Memorial Day flags . . . as he 
plans to do them." She questioned whether others were trying to "commercialize" 
Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dave Emerson, the other agent who plans to plant flags there, contends 
that he made no such request of Turner, adding, "I don't think you can have too 
many flags." 
</P>
<P>
Residents will have no trouble figuring out who their benefactors are, since 
the agents attach their names to the flags. 
</P>
<P>
If Malibu does become an incorporated city, will the beach colony change its 
name so as to break with its past? Perhaps to erase the memory of such recent 
jokes as Johnny Carson's observation that residents were offering to pay for 
valet parking for the homeless and provide free sun block? 
</P>
<P>
Well, the marquee at the Malibu Inn and Restaurant on Thursday suggested a new 
dateline: 
</P>
<P>
"Hullabaloo, Calif."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BOY, 14, ARRAIGNED ON MURDER CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Valencia teen-ager who shot a 13-year-old boy to death during a game of 
Russian roulette was charged Thursday with murder. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-year-old boy was arraigned in Sylmar Juvenile Hall on one count of 
murder in the fatal shooting Tuesday of Gabriel Soto, said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Michele Rosenblatt. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators said the boy shot Soto once in the 
head with a large-caliber revolver at the Valencia apartment where he lived 
with his parents, who were not home at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the suspect had possession of the gun at all times during the 
game. They also said it appeared that Soto and a third boy, identified as 
14-year-old Aaron Schwartz, were reluctant participants in the game. 
</P>
<P>
The youth remains in custody at Sylmar Juvenile Hall. If convicted, he could 
serve his sentence in the California Youth Authority until he is 25.

VICTIMS, OFFICIALS KICK OFF INITIATIVE TO SPEED UP TRIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ambitious politicians and angry crime victims teamed up Thursday for the 
kickoff of what could be a noteworthy ballot initiative campaign to speed up 
criminal trials in California. 
</P>
<P>
Ridiculing a system that took three years to bring Night Stalker suspect 
Richard Ramirez to trial, the victims and their supporters stood in the 
courtyard of the main County Jail, within earshot of prisoners, and predicted 
that this far-reaching measure would cut delays of years into just weeks and 
shorten the agony of those who have endured a crime. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to change the law in order to change the odds in favor of the 
citizen and not the criminal," said U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, Republican candidate 
for governor. He is the foremost office-seeker behind the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
Other backers of the signature-gathering drive include prominent police, other 
Republican politicians and a couple of law-and-order Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chief Sponsors 
</P>
<P>
The chief sponsors are a group of crime victims and prosecutors who first 
banded together in 1986 in the campaign that brought down controversial state 
Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird and two other Supreme Court liberals. 
</P>
<P>
With Bird gone, Kern County Dist. Atty. Ed Jagels said, the group asked itself, 
" . . . what are we going to need to undo the damage and bring California's 
criminal justice system back onto the mainstream?" 
</P>
<P>
The result is a proposed overhaul in the state Constitution that begins with a 
declaration that courts are to afford the accused the same rights as defendants 
under federal law but nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would revive the indictment powers of grand juries. Preliminary 
hearings, which now can last for months, would be shortened and victims spared 
having to attend. Prosecutors complain that preliminary hearings often become 
full-blown trials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Significant Changes 
</P>
<P>
Other significant changes would require judges, not lawyers, to conduct 
questioning of prospective jurors. Time limits would be imposed on the work of 
court appointed defense lawyers. And more cases would be consolidated for 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would eliminate a controversial Bird court precedent holding that 
criminals are liable for the death penalty only for crimes in which they set 
out to kill someone, rather than crimes that escalate to murder while in 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, additional penalties would be imposed on criminals who tortured their 
victims -- a provision to prevent future release of criminals such as the 
notorious Larry Singleton. He was the man who raped a young woman in 
California, chopped off her arms and was released after serving less than eight 
years of a 14-year prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Backfire Warning 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys are among those who will contest the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald F. Uelmen, dean of the University of Santa Clara School of Law and 
spokesman for the defense lawyers group California Attorneys for Criminal 
Justice, warned that the provisions designed to speed up justice would backfire 
and clog courts with many more criminal trials. 
</P>
<P>
Uelmen explained this is because California's criminal justice system has 
evolved into one where 95% of felony cases are settled before trial thanks to 
provisions of law and precedent that the proposition would eliminate. 
California would be left looking more like the federal system, where five times 
the percentage of felonies are sent to full trial, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is courting disaster. We handle 10 times as many felony cases with only 1 
1/2 as many judges as the federal system," Uelmen said. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsors of the proposition now must collect 650,000 signatures in the next 5 
1/2 months to qualify the measure for a spot on the June, 1990, ballot. 
</P>
<P>
One tool they have are the likes of the 50 or so crime victims and their 
families who attended Thursday's kickoff. Wearing yellow ribbons, some quietly 
nodded as the court delays were castigated. Some held each other. Others 
sobbed. Together, the scene demonstrated not just the emotion of the victim but 
the growing political sophistication of the victim movement. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us have had a very costly education. Not an education that we wanted; 
not an education that we deserved. But believe me, we understand the court 
system," said Collene Thompson Campbell. Her son, Scott, was killed in 1982. 
Then in 1988, her brother, racing promoter Mickey Thompson, was slain along 
with his wife, Trudy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long History 
</P>
<P>
"At the time of their death, they were working on this very initiative. In 
fact, the petitions were in the car where they were assassinated," she 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, this proposal has been kicking around for years. Twice previously, 
sponsors have filed for petitions, but never successfully gathered enough 
signatures to qualify it for the ballot. They blamed lack of money. 
</P>
<P>
What is different this time is that Wilson has thrown his support, prestige, 
fund-raising potential and even some manpower behind the effort. Los Angeles 
County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, a Democratic candidate for state attorney 
general, and state Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside), one of the Legislature's 
strongest law-and-order figures, have also endorsed the measure.

HIGH-TECH TRAFFIC SYSTEM EXPANDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ground-breaking ceremonies Thursday set the stage for a Westside addition to a 
high-tech system that controls the flow of traffic through pavement sensors. 
</P>
<P>
The automated traffic system was one of a battery of traffic control measures 
used during the 1984 Olympics and is still in place in the Coliseum area. 
</P>
<P>
The system has also been installed downtown and in the West San Fernando 
Valley, and a citywide system should be in place within the next 10 years, city 
Transportation Department Manager Ed Rowe said. 
</P>
<P>
The system works through a series of pavement sensors that transmit information 
about traffic conditions to a control center in City Hall. Computers 
automatically modify the timing of signals to help traffic flow. The sensors 
also transmit information about traffic problems so officers or emergency 
response units can be quickly dispatched.

NEW SOVIET CONGRESS ELECTS GORBACHEV TO PRESIDENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, was 
elected overwhelmingly Thursday at the first meeting of the Soviet Union's new 
congress to fill the country's strengthened executive presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev immediately pledged to use his increased powers to accelerate the 
pace of his political and economic reforms and to broaden their scope. 
</P>
<P>
His election by the first democratically elected Soviet legislature in 70 years 
gives Gorbachev, 58, broad executive authority to shape the nation's foreign 
and domestic policies and makes him the leader of the new congress as well. He 
also remains the party's general secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, who became the sole candidate for president after other nominees 
withdrew or were rejected, received nearly 96% of the 2,210 ballots cast in the 
Congress of People's Deputies. Eighty-seven members voted against him in the 
secret ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Although his election was never in doubt, Gorbachev's suitability for the 
presidency was debated, often sharply, for several hours, with the deputies 
taking their new responsibilities quite seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Replying to their questions, Gorbachev declared his intention to speed the 
democratization of the Soviet political system, replacing a decades-old system 
of commands from the top with dialogue at all levels. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to his program of political and economic restructuring, he 
acknowledged that perestroika is facing great difficulties now, but these 
latest reforms should, he repeated, help break through the conservative 
resistance to them. 
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of the Congress of People's Deputies was itself a major step 
-- participants again and again stressed its historic character -- in the 
reform process here. 
</P>
<P>
The 2,250 deputies were chosen for the most part in the first truly contested 
elections since the earliest days of the Soviet state, and the new Congress 
has, as the result of constitutional changes, far more authority and 
independence than any previous legislature. Past legislatures are now 
acknowledged here to have been little more than rubber stamps for party 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The new executive presidency makes Gorbachev the formulator of the country's 
domestic and foreign policies. He recommends the appointment of the premier for 
approval by the legislature; he heads the country's defense council, and he can 
exercise broad, and so far undefined, authority under a constitutional 
provision saying simply that the president "shall issue orders." The old 
presidency, which Gorbachev had held since last Oct. 1, was largely ceremonial. 
</P>
<P>
The Congress of People's Deputies will also elect about 540 of its members to 
serve in the Supreme Soviet, which has been reconstituted as a standing 
legislature with full lawmaking authority but under the congress. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the strengthened presidency and legislature are part of Gorbachev's 
broad reform effort, ending the Communist Party's long monopoly on power by 
sharing it with other segments of Soviet society. 
</P>
<P>
With millions around the country watching the session on television -- even the 
debates over rules were broadcast live -- the proceedings at the Palace of 
Congresses in the Kremlin conveyed the drama and excitement of a nation setting 
out, with both hope and trepidation, on a new course. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boldly Challenged 
</P>
<P>
In scenes unprecedented since the earliest days of the Soviet state, deputies 
boldly called on Gorbachev to explain the country's deepening economic crisis 
and its mounting inter-ethnic tensions. 
</P>
<P>
"Please tell us is it right to use the army for punitive operations against our 
own people?" a deputy from the Baltic republic of Estonia asked Gorbachev, 
recalling the deaths of 21 people when troops were sent into Tbilisi in the 
southern Soviet Republic of Georgia last month. 
</P>
<P>
"Was a country house built for you in the Crimea?" a Leningrad deputy demanded, 
wanting to know how Gorbachev stood on the highly sensitive issue of 
privileges, often verging on corruption, that the Soviet leadership has 
enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Raisa, was both criticized and defended for the prominent role she 
plays at home and abroad. "Napoleon started out as a national leader," one 
deputy said, "but because of the ambitions of his wife ended up as an emperor." 
</P>
<P>
And Andrei D. Sakharov, the nuclear physicist and human rights campaigner, said 
that, although he respected Gorbachev and believed that only he could lead the 
country at this time, he could not vote for him without first hearing his 
program for future reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"Do we have the right to elect the head of state before discussions, before 
debates and before the resolution of political questions that will define the 
future of our country?" Sakharov asked, opening the session. 
</P>
<P>
"We shall disgrace ourselves in front of our people if we do this. I supported 
Gorbachev many times, and I do not see another person for the post. But this 
support of mine is conditional in nature. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that Gorbachev gave birth to perestroika, and he must say what has 
happened to the country during the past four years," Sakharov said. "We must 
say what achievements and what mistakes we have made and also what we are going 
to do in the nearest future to overcome the extremely difficult situation of 
our country." 
</P>
<P>
There was even a challenge to the legitimacy of Gorbachev's presiding over the 
opening debates on procedural matters, and the discussions were stopped briefly 
to reconfirm his temporary chairmanship of the session. 
</P>
<P>
"What is happening in this hall is totally out of the ordinary for all of us," 
Gorbachev said later as the debate over his leadership grew increasingly frank. 
"And I see it," he added, amid thunderous applause, "as the most convincing 
proof that perestroika is pressing firmly ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Most speakers praised Gorbachev for launching the reforms that have transformed 
the Soviet political scene, restoring the hope for the "bright future" that 
socialism had promised and giving the country a sense of confidence that it 
could achieve it. 
</P>
<P>
"He is the man who shook the sleeping kingdom of stagnation," writer Chingiz 
Aitmatov declared, nominating Gorbachev. "He had the valor to start a new 
revolution." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, even Aitmatov was critical. Gorbachev and his supporters have to recognize 
"the errors that have been committed in perestroika up till now, in the economy 
and in inter-ethnic relations," Aitmatov said, touching the three most 
sensitive issues here. 
</P>
<P>
The most serious criticism of Gorbachev came on the question of combining the 
posts of president and party leader. Many deputies said flatly that no man, not 
even Gorbachev, should occupy the two most powerful posts in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"To ensure that the party autocracy is excluded from influencing the direction 
of the state," one Moscow deputy said, "the posts of president and general 
secretary must be separated." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, who listened carefully to all the criticism, argued in reply that it 
was necessary to bring together the two jobs, at least for the next five years, 
to push through further changes, but he promised that the arrangement would be 
reviewed before the next parliamentary election in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Use of Troops Discussed 
</P>
<P>
He assured the deputies that he and the party's ruling Politburo opposed the 
use of combat troops to police the country, but he said that the government 
also had an obligation to maintain stability and avoid bloodshed, particularly 
from inter-ethnic clashes. 
</P>
<P>
To settle the question of privileges -- he said his only country house, or 
dacha, was one owned by the state -- Gorbachev proposed a special legislative 
commission to "do a full inventory of all we have and the decide what to do 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to ensure a contested election, a construction engineer from 
northern Russia had put forward his own candidacy for president, outlining an 
alternative, more radical reform program and drawing some support. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander Obolensky, the engineer, argued that a choice was essential for the 
country's emerging democracy, but he was rejected as a candidate when only 689 
of the deputies voted for inclusion of his name on the ballot rather than the 
50% needed. 
</P>
<P>
"I am no fool," Obolensky said. "I know I don't stand any chance whatsoever, 
but I think we should create the precedent for all future elections." 
</P>
<P>
Boris N. Yeltsin, the Communist Party maverick, who quit his ministerial post 
this week to sit as a deputy representing the Moscow at-large constituency, was 
nominated by supporters, who said that his boldness was needed in the top 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
But Yeltsin immediately withdrew himself from consideration, saying that he 
supported the party's nominee, Gorbachev, out of adherence to "party 
discipline."

WRIGHT EXPECTED TO RESIGN FROM OFFICE NEXT WEEK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) is likely to resign from the House next week, 
even though he has ruled out further efforts to persuade the House Ethics 
Committee to drop charges against him, a House leadership source said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, who has been charged by the committee with 69 violations of House 
rules, signaled the end of his behind-the-scenes negotiations with the 
committee by issuing a statement ruling out any plea-bargaining over the 
charges pending against him. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no deal now. There will be no deal in the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But a knowledgeable source said that Wright is still seriously considering 
tendering his resignation as Speaker and, simultaneously, ending his 35-year 
House career next week after most of the chamber's 435 members return from a 
Memorial Day recess. 
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the Speaker, despite a strong desire to defend himself 
against the charges, is fully aware of the growing sentiment among House 
Democrats that his legal troubles are causing embarrassment to the party and to 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a proud man," the source said. "He is torn between his desire to be 
heard and his respect for the institution . . . . I believe the Speaker will 
ultimately do what he wants to do when he wants to do it." 
</P>
<P>
If Wright resigns, the Ethics Committee case against him would be dropped, but 
he still would face a broad investigation of his finances undertaken recently 
by the Internal Revenue Service as well as a possible Justice Department 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
Many House Democrats are convinced that Wright will step down, perhaps as soon 
as next Wednesday. They noted that it would be very difficult for him to 
withdraw the offer to resign that was implied in his negotiations with the 
Ethics Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's all over for him," said a prominent House Democrat, who declined 
to be identified. "He can't un-ring the bell." 
</P>
<P>
A Democratic aide added: "If Wright indicates he's willing to quit, he'll be 
pushed out the door. A lot of support he's had up to now might go fast. People 
are tired of being dragged down by leaders who can't keep their affairs 
straight. They are taking a very hard line, saying: 'Enough's enough. Let's get 
on with it.' " 
</P>
<P>
If he resigns, Wright is virtually certain to be replaced as Speaker by House 
Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.). House Democrats said the chances 
that Assistant Majority Leader Tony Coelho (D-Merced) would succeed Foley have 
been diminished somewhat by news that Coelho and Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley 
are the subjects of preliminary investigations by the public integrity section 
of the Justice Department in connection with their financial dealings with 
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable sources said that Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-Ga.) is considering 
challenging Coelho for the position of majority leader, if it becomes 
available. Jenkins declined to confirm or deny the report. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri was also reportedly considering seeking a 
top Democratic leadership position. 
</P>
<P>
The Speaker and other Democratic leaders are chosen by a vote of the party 
caucus. 
</P>
<P>
Common Cause, the citizens lobby, and House Republicans also are considering 
filing a complaint with the House Ethics Committee against Coelho in connection 
with his purchase of a $100,000 "junk bond" from Thomas Spiegel, chairman of 
Columbia Savings &amp; Loan in Los Angeles, and his failure to report a $50,000 
loan from Columbia to help purchase the bond. It was complaints from Common 
Cause and GOP congressmen that led to the Ethics Committee's investigation of 
Wright. 
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Wright said that he had not initiated the negotiations 
between his lawyers and committee members that took place Wednesday. He said 
that the talks began, instead, at the request of unnamed friends in both camps 
who wanted "to save the House from what they saw as a harsh and divisive 
confrontation." 
</P>
<P>
A House leadership source said that the settlement talks were initiated earlier 
this week by Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the Ethics 
Committee, who enlisted Rep. Louis Stokes (D-Ohio) to make the initial contact 
with Wright's principal defender in the House, Rep. Robert G. Torricelli 
(D-N.J.). He said that the Speaker then agreed to permit Torricelli to carry on 
talks on his behalf with Richard J. Phelan, special counsel for the committee. 
</P>
<P>
The committee was anxious to settle the Wright case, according to this source, 
because the members want to avoid a precedent-setting vote on the issue of what 
constitutes "direct interest in legislation" under House rules. 
</P>
<P>
"The committee wants out," the source said. "The committee suggested something 
that was rejected out of hand. The Speaker from the very beginning was 
unwilling to cut a deal." Wright is accused of violating the rule that 
prohibits House members from accepting gifts in excess of $100 from persons 
with direct interest in legislation. The charge stems from lucrative benefits 
that Wright and his wife, Betty, received from their friendship and business 
partnership with George A. Mallick Jr., a Ft. Worth real estate developer. 
</P>
<P>
According to the source, the committee offered to clear Wright of violating 
this rule before 1986 in exchange for his resignation from the House. It was 
not until 1986 that Wright called upon Mallick to prepare a report aimed at 
influencing legislation to recapitalize the beleaguered savings and loan 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
The committee never offered to forgive Wright on the charge of violating the 
rules governing outside income by selling his book, "Reflections of a Public 
Man," to special interest groups in lieu of honorariums. House rules limit 
honorariums but not book royalties. 
</P>
<P>
A leadership source said that Wright dismissed the offer not because he 
objected to these terms but because members of the committee were insisting 
that he resign immediately, a demand that he saw as unreasonable. He indicated 
that Wright would rather wait until next week to tender his resignation so that 
he can do it in a speech before the full House. 
</P>
<P>
"The Speaker wants to do what he wants according to his timing," the source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seen as Against Talks 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the source said, Wright never felt comfortable about the negotiations 
and viewed them only as a necessary step in the legal process of defending 
himself. "He did not like the smell of a negotiated arrangement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A close associate reported that Wright and his wife -- acting on the advice of 
friends -- are expected to leave town to spend a long, quiet Memorial Day 
weekend together at an undisclosed location to ponder their future. 
</P>
<P>
If he decides to resign, this associate noted, Wright, 66, would receive a 
generous House pension and would be in a position to write a lucrative book 
about his experiences in his 2 1/2 years as Speaker. Wright's predecessor as 
Speaker, Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr. (D-Mass.), received a $1-million 
publisher's advance for his memoirs.

SENATE APPROVES BILL ALLOWING RANDOM CAR SEARCHES FOR WEAPONS 
</P>

<P>
Anti-gang legislation permitting law enforcement officers to stop motorists at 
random and search their vehicles for illegal firearms during a local emergency 
was overwhelmingly passed by the Senate on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The bill by Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia), a former Los Angeles police chief, was 
sent to the Assembly on a lopsided 29-4 vote despite some reservations that the 
measure might run afoul of constitutional protections against unreasonable 
search and seizure. 
</P>
<P>
But Davis insisted that the bill, aimed at the perpetrators of gang-related 
drive-by shootings, provided for "reasonable search and seizure." He noted that 
"even some of our nicest suburbs are getting gang shootings and gang violence." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, told the 
Senate that the far-reaching bill probably is unconstitutional and likely will 
be killed in the Assembly. Nevertheless, Lockyer had voted in favor of the 
measure in his committee and decided to sit out the vote on the Senate floor 
rather than publicly side against it during the current anti-crime climate that 
prevails among citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"When you start in a free society searching people's cars without cause -- just 
doing it because you know there is a general safety problem -- we should all as 
free Americans worry about that," Lockyer cautioned his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics noted that under the bill, police would not have to demonstrate the 
usually required probable cause or reasonable suspicion before stopping and 
searching a vehicle and seizing weapons. 
</P>
<P>
One such skeptic, Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), voiced concern that 
police and sheriff's deputies could single out minority drivers for 
"discrimination." But Hart wound up voting for the measure. 
</P>
<P>
But Davis said such conduct would be both improper and illegal. "I think police 
agencies are very sensitive to that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The bill is intended to give cities and counties an additional tool to combat 
street gang shootings, particularly in some Los Angeles neighborhoods where gun 
fights between rival groups seem part of the life style. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would allow a city council or county board of supervisors to declare 
that public safety is so "gravely imperiled" by illegal use of firearms that 
law enforcement officers should conduct emergency searches of vehicles at 
random. 
</P>
<P>
The searches would be conducted only at night because, a Davis aide said, most 
drive-by shooting occur under cover of darkness. He also said daylight searches 
would unnecessarily disrupt people's lives 
</P>
<P>
The bill, in addition, would allow officers on a non-emergency basis to stop 
motorists at roadside checkpoints, similar to stops aimed at catching drunk 
drivers. At these stops, officers could not search the vehicle except to 
visually inspect the driver and passenger compartment for stolen, smuggled or 
other illegal weapons.

SAN BERNARDINO WILL SUE PIPELINE COMPANY, ANGERED OFFICIALS SAY 
</P>

City officials, ruefully telling of reassurances by state and pipeline company 
inspectors that the pipeline involved in Thursday's fatal gasoline explosion 
was safe, announced plans to sue the pipeline company for damage sustained in 
the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"We were told the pipeline had been looked at after the (May 12) train 
derailment, inspected, and it was safe," Mayor Evlyn Wilcox said. "Apparently, 
though, there was some weakness." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor said she was "upset, concerned and distraught" at the loss of life 
and property in the explosion, and City Atty. James Penman said the city will 
sue the Calnev Pipeline Co. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, in this case, the experts were wrong," Penman said. "Calnev has got 
a lot of explaining to do." 
</P>
<P>
While the mayor and city attorney were making their bitter statements at the 
scene of the explosion, however, other officials at City Hall were refusing to 
make records available that could shed light on what role the city and other 
agencies played in allowing the railroad track and pipeline right-of-way so 
close to a housing tract. 
</P>
<P>
"We have some potential litigation here, so we can only say at this point that 
from our point of view everything was handled according to state laws on tract 
subdivisions, railroad lines and pipelines," city spokesman Gregory Garcia 
said. "What we did was correct, but we cannot divulge the records at this 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Other officials in the city's Planning Department, however, said the tract was 
approved before the railroad line was constructed, and that the homes in the 
230-lot subdivision were constructed after the rail line was built but several 
years before the pipeline went in. 
</P>
<P>
John Montgomery, principal planner for the city, released a brief file noting 
that the subdivision was approved by San Bernardino County authorities on March 
17, 1955. It was not until Oct. 1, 1957, that the area was annexed to the city 
of San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery said the railroad had been constructed in 1966 and the homes in 
1970. A Calnev official said the pipeline was constructed in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
A deputy city administrator, Jim Richardson, said that just last week the city 
attorney, Penman, had negotiated an agreement with Southern Pacific under which 
the railroad company rather than the city was to assume liability for damage 
resulting from the train derailment. 
</P>
<P>
The records that were requested and withheld Thursday pertained to any city 
hearings or other deliberations that may have transpired over permits for the 
pipeline. The general manager of the pipeline company's local office, Jed 
Robinson, said that while the U.S. Department of Transportation had the overall 
responsibility for approving the pipeline and the office of the state fire 
marshal for inspecting it, he believed that local permits had also been 
required to actually construct it. 
</P>
<P>
Although city officials aimed their criticism at the pipeline company, it is 
the state fire marshal's office that was responsible for assuring that the 
pipeline was safe after the May 12 train derailment. 
</P>
<P>
It was this agency's West Covina office that conducted spot inspections in the 
days after the train derailment and found no impairment of the pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Questions Raised 
</P>
<P>
Thursday afternoon, a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board, a 
federal agency, said the board will investigate what had happened with 
particular attention to the following questions: 
</P>
<P>
* Why didn't testing of the pipeline after the derailment reveal any damage? 
</P>
<P>
* What kind of testing was done by the fire marshal's office? 
</P>
<P>
* What may have happened to the pipeline after the testing? 
</P>
<P>
* How did a pipeline cutoff valve that is supposed to detect changes in 
pressure and shut down a leaking line function in this case? 
</P>
<P>
Officials on various levels said that while the Transportation Department has 
overall authority over the pipeline, a confusing array of state and local 
agencies also had roles in the permit and design process for it. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Lael, an associate safety engineer in the fire marshal's office in 
Sacramento, said the state agency had entered into an agreement in 1985 with 
the U.S. Department of Transportation to assume responsibility for inspecting 
the Calnev pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Responsible Department 
</P>
<P>
But Lael said that while the fire marshal makes reports on what it finds, it is 
the Transportation Department that is responsible for any follow-through. 
</P>
<P>
He said many different state and local agencies have a role in the process 
whereby pipeline companies are given permits to build their lines. There are so 
many agencies that, in most cases, the agencies agree among themselves which 
one is to have the coordinating role in the permit process, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire marshal's office comes in after the permits to look at design factors, 
he said.

HAZARDOUS LIQUIDS FLOW IN 8,000 MILES OF PIPES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 14-inch pipeline that ruptured and set off a deadly fire in a San 
Bernardino neighborhood Thursday is part of 8,000 miles of pipeline that carry 
oil, gasoline and other hazardous liquids under many residential communities 
throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
"We would not look very favorably on constructing pipelines through a 
residential area, but to get to the refineries, you have to go through those 
areas," said Thomas Lael, associate pipeline safety engineer in the state fire 
marshal's office. "You are between a rock and a hard place." 
</P>
<P>
The largest concentration of these lines is under the Los Angeles Basin, and 
many, possibly most, run near or under residential communities, Lael said. Each 
month, there are 15 to 20 leaks or pipeline spills statewide, ranging from a 
few ounces of fuel to 1,000 barrels. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to make it sound routine, but with that many miles of pipeline, 
this (a spill or leak) is just a normal occurrence" caused by pipe corrosion, 
he said. "Most of them are real small leaks anyway, a quart or a gallon or a 
pint." 
</P>
<P>
Explosions are rare. 
</P>
<P>
"With 99% of the spills, there is no fire or ignition," Lael said . "This (the 
San Bernardino blaze) is the exception. You need to have a source of ignition, 
like a vehicle with an engine running or a cigarette." 
</P>
<P>
Neal Osborne, a San Bernardino County planning analyst, said the houses that 
burned in the explosion were built in the early 1970s, a time when the 
proximity of a pipeline probably would not have been considered and no 
environmental impact report was required. 
</P>
<P>
"There wouldn't have been any environmental determination made," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Each day, that pipeline transports 80,000 barrels of gasoline 250 miles from 
Colton to Las Vegas. It is owned by Calnev Pipe Line Co., a common carrier that 
state officials characterize as "cooperative." 
</P>
<P>
The company "has a good safety record," said James Wait, acting manager of the 
pipeline safety program for the state fire marshal. 
</P>
<P>
It was Wait's office that gave the pipeline a clean bill on May 16, the last 
inspection after the May 12 train derailment. "Everything looked fine to us and 
to the operators," Wait said. 
</P>
<P>
After the train wreck, his office had engineers on the site each day during the 
cleanup "making sure we did everything we could to avoid a puncture or an 
accident." 
</P>
<P>
"We thought that process was finished and we had succeeded. . . ." he said. 
"It's just a mystery at this point." 
</P>
<P>
The fire marshal works with the U.S. Department of Transportation to enforce 
pipeline safety laws. Usually, the fire marshal inspects a pipeline every year 
or 18 months to ensure that the carriers meet all federal requirements, 
including regular patrol of the pipeline to search for leaks and maintenance of 
valves. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't recall any particular difficulty with (Calnev) as far as complying 
with our regulations," Lael said. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials say pipeline transportation is considered one of the safest 
ways to move fuel. "Pipelines are probably, if not the most safe, one of the 
safest modes of transportation when you look at accident statistics" for trains 
and trucks, said James Thomas, deputy director of Pipeline Safety for the 
Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 200 "significant" spills nationally of more than 50 barrels 
each year, and last year there were 20 fatalities associated with pipelines, he 
said. Pipelines are most often damaged by excavation equipment, usually during 
the installation of sewer lines or construction of highways, according to 
Thomas. Those accidents are followed in number by mechanical failures and 
corrosion of pipes. 
</P>
<P>
In California, real estate brokers are required to disclose the existence of a 
gasoline line to buyers only if it is on the property, not just nearby, said 
George Hartwell, spokesman for the state Department of Real Estate. 
Subdivisions have more extensive disclosure requirements, and the presence of a 
nearby gasoline pipeline would have to be reported. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the area devastated by Thursday's blast said they were unaware of 
the gasoline line that skirted their neighborhood until its existence became 
known after the train wreck two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Although most pipeline leaks are small, there have been some notable 
exceptions. In November, 1986, the rupture of a 10-inch pipeline next to the 
Marine Corps Helicopter Station in Tustin resulted in the spilling of gasoline 
for two hours into a flood control channel and the temporary evacuation of 
1,500 Marines and their families. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, a pipeline leading to an underground natural gas storage yard in 
Valencia broke and triggered an explosion and a five-acre brush fire. In April, 
1988, a street was temporarily closed in Los Alamitos after about 50 gallons of 
marine diesel fuel from a pipeline bubbled to the surface.

DOCTORS SAY HONESTY IS NOT ALWAYS BEST POLICY 
</P>

Most physicians would be willing occasionally to mislead insurers and patients' 
families -- either to protect their patients' interests or even, in some 
instances, to protect themselves, according to a new study. 
</P>
<P>
The study, published today in the Journal of the American Medical Assn., found 
that more than half of the 211 doctors surveyed would deceive an insurance 
company to help out a patient, or would let a patient lie to his wife about his 
diagnosis of venereal disease. 
</P>
<P>
More than a third said they would provide incomplete or misleading information 
about a mistake that led to a patient's death -- contending, in many cases, 
that the patient's family would only be further hurt by knowing of the mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"There is this tension between what's ethically correct in the abstract and 
what works in practice," said Dr. Dennis H. Novack of Brown University, an 
author of the study. "I think physicians tend to be practical people." 
</P>
<P>
The anonymous questionnaire, aimed at exploring attitudes toward deception, 
presented the randomly selected physicians with four quandaries. In a 
multiple-choice format, they were asked to choose a course of action and 
identify their reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The physicians were also asked generally about their basic principles. The 
results: 
</P>
<P>
* Nearly 70% said they would mislead an insurance company to obtain coverage of 
a routine mammogram for an apparently healthy 52-year-old woman. In the 
example, the woman's insurance covered mammography only if there were some sign 
of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The physicians said they would tell the insurer the test was needed to "rule 
out cancer," rather than simply as routine screening. Justifying the deception, 
they argued that the insurance rules were unreasonable and their obligation was 
to their patient. 
</P>
<P>
* More than 60% would permit a man who had caught gonorrhea from a prostitute 
to deceive his wife rather than jeopardize his marriage: They would allow him 
to tell her he had a non-specific infection, as long as he would ensure that 
she be treated. 
</P>
<P>
But the authors noted that the wife might then underestimate the infection, 
neglect her antibiotics and run the risk of developing pelvic inflammatory 
disease -- a painful consequence of untreated gonorrhea that can in some cases 
leave a woman infertile. 
</P>
<P>
* More than a third of the doctors surveyed said they would omit telling a 
mother that her 15-year-old daughter was pregnant. In the hypothetical case, 
the girl begged for secrecy, saying she would get an abortion in a nearby state 
not requiring parental consent. 
</P>
<P>
The physicians said they would tell the mother that they had discussed the 
daughter's health with her and she could discuss it with her mother. Most 
justified their evasion on grounds of patient confidentiality. Some simply said 
it was best for the girl. 
</P>
<P>
* Finally, nearly 40% said they would be willing to mislead the family of a 
hypothetical 80-year-old patient who had been hospitalized with severe 
hypertension, and who had then died after receiving a fatal dose of medication 
from a mislabeled vial. 
</P>
<P>
While more than half the physicians surveyed said they would admit the 
accident, others would simply stress the risks of strong medication. Some said 
they would say the patient had been very sick and had died, despite the 
physician's best efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"While many argued in their comments that the family would only be further hurt 
by the knowledge of the mistake, deception clearly offered benefits to the 
physicians as well," the researchers noted in the paper. 
</P>
<P>
Asked generally to describe how they felt about deception, 87% of the 109 
physicians who answered that question said deception would be acceptable on 
rare occasions to protect the patient from harm, to circumvent "ridiculous 
rules" and to protect confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Survey's Value 
</P>
<P>
The researchers -- including physicians from the medical schools of Brown, 
Harvard and the universities of Washington and Pittsburgh -- said their 
exploratory survey, which they believe is unprecedented, could serve as 
groundwork for developing guidelines, teaching ethics and further research. 
</P>
<P>
"My view of ethics is that in certain cases there are right and wrong answers," 
said Dr. Robert Arnold, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of 
Pittsburgh and a co-author. "In other cases, what counts are not the answers 
but the reasons." 
</P>
<P>
While the researchers believe the survey's anonymity encouraged honest 
responses, one expert in opinion research said there is a well-documented 
tendency for people to "over-report good behavior and under-report bad 
behavior." 
</P>
<P>
"Having things be entirely anonymous does not entirely ensure frankness," said 
Tom Smith of the National Opinion Research Center. "Doctors may be 
sophisticated enough to know that what they report might reflect upon the 
profession as a whole."

AIR CONTROLLERS STILL OVERWORKED, GAO SAYS; ORANGE COUNTY, LONG BEACH CITED

Three years after it first described serious flaws in the nation's air traffic 
control system, a congressional watchdog agency said Thursday that the 
country's 14,400 air controllers are still seriously overworked, undertrained 
and demoralized. 
</P>
<P>
And there apparently are particular problems among the controllers who manage 
air traffic in and out of airports in Orange County and Long Beach in 
California, according to testimony at a congressional hearing on the study. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
El Toro Criticized 
</P>
<P>
Conditions at the air traffic control facility at the El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station, which handles flights in Orange County, Long Beach and much of the 
rest of the busy air corridor between Los Angeles and San Diego, "are poor, and 
I would go so far as to say very poor," said Randy Moore, who heads the local 
branch of the controllers' union. Moore was among three air traffic controllers 
who testified at Thursday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The margin of safety in the nation's skies remains "less than desirable," 
although flying on commercial airliners is not unsafe, a consulting firm hired 
by the General Accounting Office concluded. The GAO is the congressional 
investigative agency that conducted the study at the request of the 
investigations and oversight subcommittee of the Public Works and 
Transportation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO report "says, in effect, nothing has changed" since the agency released 
its last study in 1986, said Rep. Guy V. Molinari (R-N. Y.), the ranking 
minority member of the subcommittee, which conducted the hearing on the safety 
of the nation's air control system. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, government safety officials blamed a near collision last 
February between two airliners over Orange County on the failure of the Federal 
Aviation Administration, which employs the controllers, to correct problems at 
the Coast Terminal Radar Approach Control facility, the formal name of the El 
Toro tracking station. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they know the problem exists, but I think it might take some public 
pushing like this hearing to actually get them in gear," Moore, in an 
interview, said of the FAA. "I hope they do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
However, Robert E. Whittington, the FAA's acting administrator, told the 
subcommittee that his agency is already taking significant steps to increase 
the number of controllers, reduce their workload, curtail overtime, update 
equipment and improve training. Whittington said he believes that controllers' 
morale is good. 
</P>
<P>
"The safety afforded by our air traffic control system remains high," 
Whittington said, citing statistics showing that near collisions dropped from 
840 in 1986 to 712 in 1988 and that traffic controller errors fell from 1,202 
in 1986 to 1,042 last year. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO's finding that serious problems remain was based on a survey of 5,098 
controllers and air traffic supervisors. Responses were obtained from 80% of 
those to whom questionnaires were sent, a return rate that GAO officials 
described as remarkably high. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Handle Too Many Planes 
</P>
<P>
The study found that: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sixty-five percent of the controllers said that they routinely handle too 
many airplanes during peak traffic periods. Supervisors reported that 38% of 
their radar controllers handle too much traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nearly 60% of the controllers said that they typically work too long 
without a break. Although the FAA guidelines call for a break after every two 
hours in front of the radar screen, 87% of the controllers said they had 
exceeded that limit at least once in the last month. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Although 43% of the controllers said they suffer from low morale, 
supervisors perceived controller morale as high. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A majority of the most senior and experienced controllers, who are formally 
designated as full performance level controllers, rated as inadequate nearly 
half of the procedures used to train new controllers. 
</P>
<P>
The figures are virtually unchanged from those presented in a 1986 report on a 
similar survey of controllers that was taken in 1985, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
"We find that the report bears out many of our worst suspicions and fears," R. 
Steve Bell, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Assn., the 
controllers' union, testified. "I can say that the FAA has a tired and 
demoralized work force that is fed up with the empty promises that have been 
served up in the last eight years . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It all boils down to business as usual. And it is a very poor way of doing 
business." 
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question from Rep. Glenn M. Anderson (D-San Pedro), chairman of 
the full committee, the official who directed the research for the GAO said 
that the survey results gave him pause. 
</P>
<P>
"It does give me some concern, not that the system is unsafe, but (about) what 
the FAA is willing to settle for as an acceptable level of safety." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1981, when President Ronald Reagan fired 11,400 striking members of the 
Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, the number of air traffic 
controllers has increased to only 14,437. That is about 1,800 fewer than the 
pre- strike total. In addition, there are now about 3,300 fewer senior 
controllers than before the strike, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
But the figures may understate the problem because the volume of the nation's 
air traffic has increased each year, the study noted.

CROSS BURNED AT JAPANESE HIGH SCHOOL IN TENNESSEE 
</P>

<P>
Community leaders apologized Thursday for a cross burning at the nation's only 
high school for the children of Japanese business executives, and police 
stepped up patrols to prevent another "sick prank." 
</P>
<P>
The crude 6 1/2-foot wooden cross was set ablaze Tuesday night at the stone 
entrance gate to the Japanese government's Tennessee Meiji Gakuin High School, 
eight days after it opened with 24 students. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater Police Commissioner Jim Burris and Police Chief Mike Jenkins went to 
the school to apologize on behalf of the city of 5,310 in the foothills of the 
Great Smoky Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
"We went up and told them: 'That's not the sentiments of the community,' " 
Burris said. "Most of the community is tickled to death that they're there. 
It's something to be proud of if you've got the only Japanese high school in 
the nation. They thought enough of the city of Sweetwater to move in with us. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought cross burning went out 20 years ago," Burris said. "I think it was 
just someone playing a prank -- a sick prank. It's a shame. It really is. I'll 
tell you one thing: It won't be tolerated." 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins said the gate where the cross was burned is a quarter-mile from the 
school buildings. Students live on the 144-acre campus but probably did not see 
the cross, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The director of an organization that monitors the activities of the Ku Klux 
Klan and other white supremacist groups said racists often target Asians as 
well as blacks for acts of intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
The circumstances frequently are similar to those in Sweetwater "where you have 
a group coming in and doing their own thing in a very visual way," said Pat 
Clark, the director of Klanwatch. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's only Japanese-accredited high school was established for children 
of Japanese business executives who are on assignment in the United States.

CRIMINAL LINKS TO IOWA A POSSIBILITY, NAVY SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
SERVICE CONTENDS SAILORS' RUPTURED FRIENDSHIP MAY HAVE LED TO THOUGHTS OF 
MURDER OR SUICIDE 
</P>

The investigation into the April 19 explosion that killed 47 sailors on the 
battleship Iowa has "a criminal aspect to it," the Pentagon disclosed Thursday 
in confirming reports that a ruptured friendship between two members of the gun 
turret crew may have led one or both of them to ponder murder or suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Navy announced that the surviving member of the friendship, 
Gunner's Mate 3rd Class Kendall L. Truitt, 21, has been transferred off the 
Iowa before it was to depart on a six-month deployment June 6. Citing the 
"extensive publicity surrounding the Iowa explosion," the service reassigned 
Truitt "in the best interests of Petty Officer Truitt, the Iowa and the Navy," 
a Navy spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Truitt was one of only 11 men in the ill-fated second gun turret to survive the 
blast. The other subject of the current investigation -- 24-year-old Gunner's 
Mate 2nd Class Clayton Michael Hartwig -- died in the explosion, leaving Truitt 
as the beneficiary of a $100,000 life insurance policy, Navy officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Hartwig, as a gun captain in Turret 2, would have been one of the last men to 
handle the 550-pound bag of explosive powder that ignited to trigger the blast. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Kubicina, Hartwig's sister, told The Times from her home in Cleveland 
that federal and Navy investigators had questioned her and her family at length 
about Hartwig's relationship with Truitt. Kubicina, who is contesting Truitt's 
claim to the insurance money, was among the first to alert naval investigators 
to the insurance policy, Navy officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether she believes that either Hartwig or Truitt had engineered the 
fatal blast, Kubicina said: "I absolutely do not believe that." 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of widespread reports that investigators found explosive devices 
among the possessions of Truitt and Hartwig, officials said that the inquiry 
has proved inconclusive so far. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no evidence to prove homicide or suicide here," said Deborah Johnson, 
an agent with the Naval Investigative Service in Norfolk, Va., where the Iowa 
is based. She described theories of homicide or suicide as "possibilities among 
many possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
But investigators so far have failed to find any evidence to suggest that the 
crew of Turret 2 accidentally misloaded the gun or mishandled the explosive 
powder that powers projectiles to distances of 23 miles. In the absence of 
other strong clues to the cause of the explosion, the inquiry increasingly has 
focused on the Hartwig-Truitt connection. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing else," said a knowledgeable Navy source. "There's a lot of 
confusion" among investigators, the source added. 
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable sources said that Navy criminal investigators on the West Coast 
were questioning Truitt's friends about his relationship with Hartwig, 
including the possibility that one or both men were homosexual. The 
investigators also sought information from Truitt's former crew mates now based 
in San Diego about the insurance policy that Hartwig purchased and what Truitt 
knew about it. 
</P>
<P>
Gay rights groups protested the Navy's focus on the relationship between 
Hartwig and Truitt. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not surprising that the Navy would blame the Iowa disaster on personal 
emotions rather than on military negligence, particularly when they could also 
then claim support for their ridiculous argument that gays are unfit for 
military service," said Craig Davidson, executive director of the New 
York-based Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.

The arrest of five high school boys -- including twins who co-captain the 
football team -- in the sexual assault of a mentally retarded teen-ager has 
some students condemning their classmates and others rallying to their defense. 
</P>
<P>
Eight other male teens, including the son of a police lieutenant in this 
affluent town, cheered while they watched the attack, investigators said. They 
are considered witnesses and have not been charged. 
</P>
<P>
The five Glen Ridge High School students were arrested Wednesday and charged 
with sexually assaulting the 17-year-old with a broomstick and miniature 
baseball bat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taunts, Threats 
</P>
<P>
The case sparked taunts, threats and incidents of vandalism at the school of 
340 pupils. Thursday was the annual "spring day" at Glen Ridge High, and along 
with the picnics and games there were fights, car vandalism and graffiti 
scrawled on walls inside the school, students said. 
</P>
<P>
The five who were charged were suspended from school Thursday for 10 days 
"because of the disruption their presence in the school would have on the 
educational program," said Supt. Rose McCaffrey. 
</P>
<P>
Damian DeVito, 17, defended the accused teen-agers, two of whom are his 
football teammates. He said he has known the victim since elementary school and 
said he believes she willingly participated in the March 1 incident. 
</P>
<P>
"I know them well enough to know they wouldn't do anything against somebody's 
will," DeVito said. "These kids are really not bad kids at all." 
</P>
<P>
Some students who were interviewed refused to give their names, saying they 
were frightened by threats made by friends of the accused students. A junior 
said he received a death threat from a telephone caller who warned him against 
talking about the case. 
</P>
<P>
School officials refused Thursday to allow journalists onto the campus, saying 
it would be disruptive. Reporters spoke to students in the parking lot of the 
school in this community of 8,000 people, about 20 miles from New York City. 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified victim, now 18, met a group of youths in a local park and then 
went to the nearby home of two of the teens charged in the case, 18-year-old 
twins Kevin and Kyle Scherzer, Essex County Prosecutor Herbert Tate said. The 
twins are co-captains of the school football team. Kyle also captains the 
baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
The Scherzer brothers and Peter J. Quigley, also 18, were charged as adults 
with aggravated sexual assault and conspiracy. The two other defendants, 16 and 
17 at the time of the incident, have been charged as juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
Tate said the girl is mentally retarded, but he would not elaborate on her 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Informed 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said the girl told a teacher about the attack on March 4 and 
that relatives and school officials took the information to police on March 22. 
Police notified the prosecutor's office a week later. The prosecutor's office 
took charge of the investigation on April 12. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-agers were arrested Wednesday morning. WNBC-TV in New York broadcast a 
report on the case Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss said the arrests were delayed because of the complexities of the case, 
particularly the question of the victim's capacity to consent to the alleged 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
Karl Greiner, a spokesman for the Assn. for Retarded Citizens-New Jersey, 
called the attack demeaning. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose that she was treated like an object . . . a dehumanizing affair at 
best, with spectators cheering on," Greiner said. "It's difficult enough to 
live your life with a handicap. It's especially difficult to be treated in a 
dehumanizing way."

More and more Americans know that people can get AIDS from sexual intercourse 
with an infected person but not from casual contact with an AIDS victim, a 
federal study released Thursday shows. 
</P>
<P>
The study, based on about 3,500 interviews a month from August, 1987, to 
August, 1988, and conducted by the federal Centers for Disease Control's 
National Center for Health Statistics, indicates that Americans think they know 
more about AIDS than before and that they may be right. 
</P>
<P>
But it may be years before the improvement shows up in a drop in reported new 
AIDS cases, because some people can be infected with the AIDS virus for 10 
years before symptoms appear, federal researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
The CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report said the overall gain in 
knowledge about acquired immune deficiency syndrome coincides with a national 
public awareness campaign. 
</P>
<P>
It said the effect of one element of the campaign, the mailing of an AIDS fact 
brochure to most American households in May and June last year, is being 
analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
The report said the percentage of parents who discussed AIDS with their 
children remained constant at about 60% but that those reporting their children 
had AIDS education in schools was up from 36% to 59%. 
</P>
<P>
The adults correctly answering it was "definitely true" that AIDS was an 
infectious disease caused by a virus rose from 44% to 64%. 
</P>
<P>
Other study findings included: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Those who knew it is very unlikely to get AIDS by working near someone who 
has the disease increased from 53% to 67%. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The percentage of people saying they knew "a lot" or "some" about AIDS rose 
from 60% to 66%. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Those correctly answering that it is "definitely true" that AIDS can be 
transmitted through intercourse with an infected person increased from 75% to 
about 85%.

HUNTING GUIDE ORDERED TO PAY $2.7 MILLION FOR YELLOWSTONE FIRE

<P>
The Forest Service has ordered a hunting guide in Bozeman, Mont., to pay more 
than $2.7 million to reimburse the government's costs of fighting one of the 
forest fires that swept through Yellowstone National Park last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Forest Service investigators said they traced the source of the blaze to camp 
stoves set up by outfitter Vernon Smith last Aug. 15. They said sparks from 
Smith's stove started a local fire that spread rapidly under high winds and 
became the Hellroaring Fire. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze burned more than 52,000 acres in Yellowstone and an additional 29,000 
acres in adjacent Gallatin National Forest before being doused by rain and snow 
in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
According to federal law, a person proven to have started a fire that burns 
public land can be required to repay the government for losses due to the fire. 
The law is seldom used because people found to have started fires usually 
cannot pay the high costs of firefighting. 
</P>
<P>
Smith declined to comment. Government officials said it is unlikely that he 
could pay the amount he has been charged, but federal lawyers said they could 
recoup part of their costs by attaching his property. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Sanders of Gallatin National Forest said the government also has billed 
Todd Wilkof of Canton, Ohio, who was on a back-country trip led by Smith the 
day the fire began. 
</P>
<P>
Forest Service investigators said Wilkof used a camp stove that morning. Their 
investigation concluded that sparks from the stove blew into the dry forest and 
quickly kindled an unmanageable blaze. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven major fires erupted in the Yellowstone area last summer and fall. Forest 
Service detectives said they believe that people started three of the fires 
while lightning was responsible for the others. 
</P>
<P>
By tracing the path of a blaze upwind to its source and checking forest 
records, investigators often can pinpoint who was at the kindling point when 
the fire began. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the federal government charged four Idaho loggers with 
dropping cigarettes in a forest west of Yellowstone last July. That evidently 
kindled the North Fork fire, the largest of the Yellowstone fires. 
</P>
<P>
Those loggers were formally charged only with the misdemeanor of dropping 
cigarettes.

off. The newspaper said hotel bookings and souvenir sales also dropped.

The European Parliament urged China's leaders Thursday to open a dialogue with 
students demonstrating for political reform, saying otherwise events could take 
a turn for the worse. 
</P>
<P>
In a message of support to the students, protesting in defiance of martial law, 
a parliamentary resolution said: 
</P>
<P>
"The European Parliament salutes the Chinese students and people, who with 
courage and determination are demonstrating their attachment to the values of 
freedom and democracy." 
</P>
<P>
It added that the Parliament, representing the 12 member nations of the 
European Community, "hopes the Chinese government will respond by showing 
openness and a willingness to talk, which alone will prevent developments 
prejudicial to the present situation."

waving banners in support of protest, taxi and bus drivers taking part in a 
transit slowdown to show solidarity with a pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
This has been Hong Kong over the past five days as the people awakened to a new 
political consciousness. Hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong citizens, old and 
young, have turned out at peaceful rallies to support the student 
demonstrations in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
An unprecedented 600,000 people -- the largest demonstration in the history of 
Hong Kong -- marched Sunday, calling for the resignation of Chinese Premier Li 
Peng. Another 60,000 turned out three days later at a rally in support of the 
pro-democracy movement in China. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong residents, known for their political apathy and preoccupation with 
making money, with selling Rolex watches and providing a glitzy shopping 
environment, are coming to terms with the British colony's eventual return to 
China in 1997. And this week's demonstrations were the most dramatic evidence 
that the people of Hong Kong want assurances and safeguards for their 
democratic rights after 1997. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confidence Wavered 
</P>
<P>
But even as Hong Kong residents asserted themselves, their confidence wavered 
as they waited to see who will emerge as China's leader. 
</P>
<P>
"People in Hong Kong are very pragmatic people who are not very interested in 
political theories," said Michael C. C. Sze, director and chief negotiator of 
Hong Kong's Trade Development Office. "But when their fundamental rights are 
challenged, they will come out, as in the demonstrations. . . . People are very 
clear about our future -- which, like it or not, is inextricably linked with 
China." 
</P>
<P>
The uncertainties of whether Beijing will keep its promise of allowing Hong 
Kong to maintain its economic system has caused thousands to flee Hong Kong, to 
seek "insurance" by residence in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
But in the wake of this week's pro-democracy demonstrations, Hong Kong's 
Executive Council and Legislative Council held a special meeting Wednesday and 
recommended that direct elections to the legislature be accelerated. They 
suggested that 45 members of the legislature, half the total, be elected 
directly by the people by 1997 and that all 90 members be so elected by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal will go to a committee drafting a basic law, or constitution, for 
Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Despite increased political activism, confidence among Hong Kong residents is 
declining. A poll published by the South China Morning Post found that 92% of 
the island's residents want more provisions for democracy in the basic law. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-seven percent said recent events in China have eroded their confidence 
and that they no longer believe that Beijing will adhere to its pledge to Hong 
Kong. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chinese Visit Postponed 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the uncertainty, Chinese officials Wednesday postponed a visit 
scheduled for next week for continued negotiations on how Hong Kong will be 
governed when China takes over. 
</P>
<P>
The uncertainty continued to affect the Hong Kong stock market. The Hang Seng 
index declined 256.22 points Thursday to close at 2,752.51. It was the fourth 
consecutive day of sharp price swings. The index plunged 339.06 points, or 
10.8%, on Monday, then recovered 251.25 points on Tuesday -- only to fall 58.92 
points Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Economically, Hong Kong is a very promising place," said K. C. Kwok, a senior 
economist at the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. "The danger is from the 
political side -- 1997 is something that hangs over the city. The confidence of 
Hong Kong depends on how people see which way China is moving. 
</P>
<P>
"China has to convince the outside. Confidence is like a piece of glass. It's 
easy to break, but difficult to mend." 
</P>
<P>
Barrie Wiggham, the Hong Kong government official known as "Mr. 1997" because 
he is overseeing the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong to China, says he 
expects China to honor its commitment to Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Useful to China' 
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is always useful to China, never more so than now," he said. "China 
gets one-fourth of its foreign currency from Hong Kong. It sees Hong Kong as a 
window to the world. (The Chinese) can get all the advantage by keeping at 
arm's length. 
</P>
<P>
"The PRC (People's Republic of China) wants a piece of the action and is 
investing in Hong Kong. The Chinese are putting their money where their mouth 
is." 
</P>
<P>
China has made a series of investments in Hong Kong over the past decade, and 
today China is the third-largest foreign investor in Hong Kong manufacturing, 
after the United States and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
China owns a 10% interest in Cathay Pacific Airlines and is an investor in a 
new air carrier called Dragonair. China is also participating in construction 
of the new eastern harbor crossing project, which is costing $385 million and 
is to open in July. 
</P>
<P>
The Bank of China's new $15-million building in Hong Kong is the sixth-tallest 
building in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"It has a symbolic meaning in that it is the tallest building in Hong Kong and 
it overshadows the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank," Kwok said.

FRESH RECRUITS FOR STUDENT ARMY ARRIVE BY RAIL TO JOIN BEIJING'S WAR OF NERVES 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At one platform of the vast, cavernous and filthy Beijing Railway Station, 
fresh recruits arrived from the countryside, stowaways who had come to the 
capital Thursday night to join fellow students in Tian An Men Square in a 
protracted war of nerves with authorities. Their faces lighted up as the train 
pulled into the station to the cheers of sympathizers. 
</P>
<P>
At the next platform, more than 1,000 similarly youthful soldiers of the 
People's Liberation Army languished on the hard seats of a parked and darkened 
train in which they had been cooped up for more than four days. The troops were 
sent here Sunday to help enforce martial law, only to have their exit from the 
station blocked by throngs of irate students and citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The scene at the station perhaps sums up the baffling stalemate between one of 
the world's most authoritarian governments and its suddenly defiant people. 
</P>
<P>
Exuberant students are banking on the naive hope that they can lead China's 
masses in a drive for democracy. But hard-line Communist Party leaders are 
emerging from a murky power struggle apparently victorious and preparing to 
recoup a humiliating loss of face by making good on an ultimatum to crack down 
on dissent. 
</P>
<P>
A curious tension was in the air Thursday evening after Premier Li Peng made 
his first public appearance since declaring martial law five days earlier. Li's 
grasp on power was confirmed when he was shown greeting ambassadors on the 7 
p.m. news broadcast of the Chinese Central Television network. 
</P>
<P>
Employees of the same state-run network were among journalists and 
intellectuals who led tens of thousands of people earlier in the day on a march 
to Tian An Men Square, expressing solidarity with students who have carried out 
a hunger strike and sit-in there for the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
An equally large number of people watched and cheered as the protesters arrived 
at the square chanting, "Li Peng, step down!" Some of them dared to call for 
the resignation of Deng Xiaoping, China's top leader and Li's backer. 
</P>
<P>
"Li Peng's government has lost the trust of the people," said a researcher at 
the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. He joined the protest wearing a 
baseball cap bearing the message: "To Be or Not to Be, That Is a Question." 
</P>
<P>
But Deng, 84, arouses more ambivalent feelings among protesters than does the 
vilified Li. Deng is respected because he is the hero of economic reform, and 
he supposedly controls the powerful military. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to make him too angry," a student protester said. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, references to Deng have come in the form of mild rebukes, such as 
the slogan painted on a subway train earlier this week: "When a Person Gets 
Old, He Can No Longer Carry a Tune." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mockery Grows Explicit 
</P>
<P>
By Thursday, however, the gentle prodding had given way to a more explicit 
mockery. 
</P>
<P>
"Xiaoping, Xiaoping, in his 80s," demonstrators chanted. "Health OK, brain not 
sharp. Go home quickly. Go play bridge." 
</P>
<P>
A group of music students who perform in a rock 'n' roll band in the 
rubbish-strewn tent city erected by protesters in the center of the square 
attacked Deng in one of their songs. 
</P>
<P>
"We are masters, not willing to be slaves," the words go. "We want democracy, 
we don't need an emperor." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, back at the railroad station, new slogan fodder continued to arrive 
from the provinces as students ignored an "urgent circular" issued Thursday by 
the State Council warning them to stay away from Beijing. And while rumors 
circulated about massive numbers of troops circling the capital, a small group 
of students kept a symbolic vigil over the trainload of stranded People's 
Liberation Army soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not afraid of them because they're the people's army," said one of a few 
dozen students positioned on a platform near the train. "But we're keeping an 
eye on them and trying to talk with them. I don't think they're going anywhere 
soon."

NICARAGUA ORDERS EXPULSION OF 2 U.S. ENVOYS

<P>
The Sandinista government accused two U.S. diplomats Thursday of encouraging 
labor unrest and ordered them to leave Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
The action was a sharp setback to what officials of both countries had hoped 
would be an improvement of relations under the Bush Administration. It 
reflected the Sandinistas' concern over a wildcat strike by teachers and the 
prospect of growing labor upheaval in the months before the February, 1990, 
Nicaraguan elections. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto announced the expulsion orders after meeting 
with John Leonard, the U.S. Embassy's charge d'affaires. 
</P>
<P>
"The American Embassy has increased its activities to promote and incite 
opposition groups and unions to make disturbances and disorders with the double 
purpose of impeding an economic recovery and the normal development of the 
election process," said a diplomatic note handed to the American official. He 
denied that any U.S. diplomat had acted improperly. 
</P>
<P>
Joel F. Cassman, the embassy's economic and commercial attache, was declared 
persona non grata and given 72 hours to get out of the country. Kathleen W. 
Barmon, a labor attache based in Honduras and also accredited to Nicaragua, was 
given 48 hours to leave. 
</P>
<P>
The government gave contradictory accounts of what they had done. The 
diplomatic note said they had met Wednesday with teachers in the northwestern 
city of Chinandega and "incited" them to join about 1,500 teachers on strike in 
a four-day-old wildcat action in scattered parts of Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Barricada, the official Sandinista newspaper, published a front-page photograph 
of the diplomats amid a crowd of men it identified as teachers. A banner 
headline read: "Yankee Interference in Chinandega." 
</P>
<P>
However, D'Escoto said he knew nothing about any meeting with teachers. He told 
reporters that two diplomats attended an opposition labor assembly in 
Chinandega and promised union leaders financial support if they would "unify 
among themselves and cause disorder, discontent and street demonstrations" 
against the revolutionary government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Allegations Rejected 
</P>
<P>
"We reject those allegations completely and totally," Leonard said as he left 
the Foreign Ministry. "They were doing what diplomats normally do, meeting with 
people and learning about what is going on in Nicaragua. . . . Their actions 
were completely within diplomatic norms." 
</P>
<P>
Cassman said he and Barmon held an "informal meeting" with farmers at 
headquarters of the Labor Unification Central, a federation affiliated with the 
Social Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
"We were on a fact-finding trip," he said. "We were listening to their 
complaints about how hard life was, how they had been wiped out by inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"Then we saw this Barricada photographer hiding in a tree." 
</P>
<P>
Relations between Washington and Managua, deeply strained by the Reagan 
Administration's backing of the Contra insurgency here, hit a low point last 
July when U.S. Ambassador Richard Melton and seven other American diplomats 
were accused of encouraging anti-government street protests, and expelled. In 
response, the United States sent home eight Nicaraguan diplomats from 
Washington, including Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann. 
</P>
<P>
The day President Bush took office, Nicaragua offered to end the mutual 
blockade on visas for new diplomatic personnel, but it wasn't until early this 
month that new visas were granted -- three for Nicaraguan diplomats and four 
for Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Cassman arrived here May 15 to take up his post. Barmon came this week on a 
temporary assignment, embassy officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The two countries have not yet agreed to exchange ambassadors. 
</P>
<P>
D'Escoto charged that the Bush Administration is "moving slowly in the 
direction of normalizing relations" and blocking a three-month-old Central 
American peace accord. He said that a May 15 deadline for a plan among the 
region's presidents to close Contra military camps in Honduras had passed 
without action because Washington insists on keeping the now-idled rebels there 
as a potential military threat until after the Nicaraguan election. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything shows that we were too optimistic about Bush," the foreign minister 
said. "Much smells the the same. Reagan is gone, but the stench has not gone 
away." 
</P>
<P>
The ambassador of another Central American country who closely monitors the 
political opposition said he doubted that the Sandinistas' charges against the 
two American diplomats are true. Rather, he said, the Sandinista action seemed 
a reflection of "tremendous insecurity" in the government about its ability to 
manage an anti-inflation program that has cost 29,000 government jobs in a 
country of 3.5 million people since Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time they are faced with a conflict with the working class, they're 
getting into a very, very sensitive area," the diplomat said. "Anything can 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
President Daniel Ortega and other officials Thursday warned the nation's 36,000 
teachers, who belong to a Sandinista-led union, that they cannot be granted a 
significant wage increase because it would refuel inflation, which was running 
at 100% per month at the end of 1988 but was cut to 12% in April. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers seeking wage increases of several hundred percent have broken with the 
union leadership and walked off the job this week in Managua, Chinandega and 
the coastal town of San Rafael del Sur. Hundreds of other teachers, who earn 
the equivalent of $10 to $13 per month in primary school and up to $30 per 
month in high schools, have threatened to join the strike.

HIGH COURT WON'T PERMIT SUITS OVER SMOKING DEATHS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The state Supreme Court on Thursday refused to permit product liability suits 
against tobacco manufacturers for death or personal injury that allegedly 
result from smoking. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, over two dissents, let stand a ruling last February by a state 
Court of Appeal holding that a 1987 state law, the Civil Liability Reform Act, 
protects tobacco and other products that are found "inherently unsafe" and are 
recognized as unsafe by customers. 
</P>
<P>
The justices' action came as a setback to plaintiffs in more than two dozen 
lawsuits pending against tobacco companies in California, as well as litigants 
in an undetermined number of other liability actions against manufacturers of 
other products. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, widespread legal attacks have been made against tobacco 
manufacturers in suits brought across the nation. But only one case thus far 
has resulted in money damages for a plaintiff. Last year a federal court jury 
awarded $400,000 to the husband of a New Jersey woman who died of cancer at age 
58 after smoking cigarettes for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
George W. Kilbourne of Martinez, an attorney representing plaintiffs in several 
cases charging death or injury from tobacco, asbestos and other toxic 
substances, expressed disappointment with Thursday's action. 
</P>
<P>
But Kilbourne said pending lawsuits still may be able to proceed on alternative 
legal grounds -- such as alleged fraud, negligence or conspiracy by 
manufacturers. "The failure to warn that some ingredients in a cigarette were 
not fully tested to see if they are carcinogenic would be considered as 
negligent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
George A. Sears of San Francisco, an attorney representing the American Tobacco 
Co., one of the defendants in the case before the court, called Thursday's 
action "obviously the correct result." Sears declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
The California law was approved by the Legislature over the objections of 
consumer groups after a last-minute compromise on tort liability issues reached 
in a closed-door meeting among insurance, business, medical and trial lawyer 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The measure established new legal protections for design defects in products 
whose users would be presumed to know that they presented health risks. Listed 
as specific examples in the law were sugar, castor oil, alcohol, butter and 
tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
A state Court of Appeal here, in the first appellate review of the law, ordered 
the dismissal of 10 wrongful-death lawsuits brought against a group of tobacco 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
The three-member panel ruled unanimously that while the 1987 statute was 
"poorly drafted," the Legislature intended to create automatic immunity for the 
makers and sellers of inherently unsafe products. 
</P>
<P>
In their appeal to the state Supreme Court, lawyers for the plaintiffs in the 
cases argued that the Legislature did not intend to bar liability for products 
that, while unsafe, could be made safer. Nor, said the attorneys, should the 
new law bar suits where consumers did not realize the added risk of smoking 
while being exposed to other health hazards, such as asbestos dust or welding 
fumes. 
</P>
<P>
In response, attorneys for the tobacco companies contended that the Legislature 
clearly intended to eliminate liability suits over tobacco, alcohol and other 
products "involving life-style choices." 
</P>
<P>
The legislators had determined that such products posed "inherent and 
well-known risks," and thus were to be protected from liability suits, the 
lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's action came in a brief order issued by the court, with only Justices 
Stanley Mosk and David N. Eagleson voting to hear the plaintiffs' appeal. Votes 
from four of the seven justices are required to grant review.

REWARDS OF $50,000 OKD IN CHILD KIDNAPING CASES

Gov. George Deukmejian, flanked by the somber parents of four abducted 
children, on Thursday signed urgency legislation authorizing state rewards of 
up to $50,000 for information leading to convictions in child kidnaping cases. 
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony in his office, Deukmejian cited the parents of four kidnaped 
children standing near him and observed, "It is impossible, even if you have 
children, to appreciate the devastating worry and concern these parents have." 
</P>
<P>
The faces of the four sets of parents were drawn and nearly expressionless 
after months of ordeal. Their children, ranging in age from 8 to 16, were taken 
from various San Francisco Bay Area locations during the last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Allows Governor to Post Rewards 
</P>
<P>
The bill, which took effect immediately upon Deukmejian's signature, allows the 
governor for the first time to post rewards of up to $50,000 for information 
leading to the arrest and conviction of the kidnapers of children. 
</P>
<P>
The measure by Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) also boosts the maximum state 
reward for other major crimes from $10,000 to $50,000. At the ceremony were the 
parents of Micheala Garecht, 10, of Hayward, abducted last November; Amber 
Schwartz-Garcia, 8, of Pinole, kidnaped in June; Michael Masaoay, 16, of San 
Francisco, who disappeared in January, and Ilene Misheloff, 14, of Dublin, who 
also vanished in January. 
</P>
<P>
"We do believe that this bill holds out hope that Micheala will be returned," 
said her mother, Sharon Garecht. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a reputation for being very careful with the dollar," Deukmejian said, 
"but I would be delighted to see the state pay out these rewards."

VA HOSPITAL ASSAILED ON CARE FOR HOMELESS VETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Veterans Administration Medical Center in Westwood is not moving fast 
enough to expand its care and housing for homeless veterans despite the fact 
that more than new 30 beds for that purpose have remained empty for two months, 
an advocacy group for the homeless charged Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging a "communications breakdown" with homeless veterans, VA officials 
have begun to rewrite admission standards, but insisted that beds had stayed 
empty because veterans either had not sought them or were ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
Toni Reinis, co-director of the nonprofit California Homeless Coalition, said 
the problem at the VA center reflects a "lack of commitment to the estimated 
20,000 homeless veterans walking the streets of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Cranston, in a strongly worded letter sent May 3 to VA Medical Center 
Director William K. Anderson, agreed. Cranston said he was "concerned that a 
lack of effective communication and working relationships between the VA and 
Los Angeles-area homeless advocacy groups may have a played a role in these 
beds not being filled." 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Cranston also requested an immediate survey of vacant buildings 
at the medical center that could be used to provide care for homeless veterans 
with little or no income. 
</P>
<P>
Reinis said that the 101-year-old medical center, which provides medical and 
psychological treatment for veterans, must accelerate its efforts to improve 
outreach programs and clarify admission criteria. 
</P>
<P>
"There are veterans groups all over the county that have no knowledge of the 
existence of these beds or how to access them," Reinis said. 
</P>
<P>
Betsy Hardie, chief of domiciliary operations at the medical center, which 
currently has 298 beds in service for homeless veterans, accepted blame for the 
"communications breakdown." 
</P>
<P>
"We at the Veterans Administration have to provide more and better 
communications with the community," Hardie said. As for the empty beds, 
however, Hardie argued: "We must recognize that there are veterans out there 
who do not wish all the services we provide . . . others are ineligible for 
reasons ranging from dishonorable discharge to bad conduct."

COMMERCIAL TV IN CLASSROOM GETS AN F FROM HONIG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig on Thursday issued a negative 
report card for Channel One, a controversial, satellite-delivered television 
show that introduced commercials to the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
"Our students' minds aren't for sale," Honig said in Anaheim as he announced 
that public schools would not be allowed to collect state money for the time 
that students spend watching the commercial television program. 
</P>
<P>
In March, Tennessee-based Whittle Communications introduced Channel One's pilot 
project at five high schools and one junior high school across the nation, 
including Gahr High School in Cerritos. The five-week program ended last month, 
but Whittle plans to expand the program nationwide if it proves successful. 
</P>
<P>
Honig said his department has examined the legal and ethical merits of Channel 
One and decided that it was "forced commercialization in school." He said 
Channel One does not qualify as an "educational activity," and therefore is 
inconsistent "with the purpose for which schools are established." 
</P>
<P>
"On the whole, it's a bad deal for kids, a bad deal for education, and it sets 
a terrible precedent," Honig said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
If California public schools take part in the Whittle programming, Honig said 
they will be docked state funding commensurate with the total number of hours 
that students view the show. 
</P>
<P>
Whittle's 12-minute program, viewed daily in the pilot project, was a lively 
international news show with young announcers. It was the two minutes of 
commercials, for such products as Snickers candy bars, Levi's jeans and 
Gillette razors, that bothered educators. 
</P>
<P>
Whittle has said it was prepared to make a $100-million investment to equip 
schools with TV monitors in each classroom, satellite dishes and video 
recorders. 
</P>
<P>
David Jarrard, spokesman for Whittle Communications in Knoxville, said 
California is the only state where there has been official opposition to 
Channel One. 
</P>
<P>
"We respectfully strongly disagree on the interpretation of state law here," he 
said. "We did this in six schools across the country, and the response in these 
schools, including Cerritos, has been remarkable in how positive it is, even 
more so than we expected." 
</P>
<P>
Even before Channel One began its pilot program, it met with strong opposition. 
The National PTA and the Action for Children's Television strongly condemned 
the use of commercials.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: POLITICAL REFORM MAY BLUR OFFICIAL VIEW OF BALLGAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it comes to perks, it's hard to beat two free tickets to every event at 
San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium: Padres, Chargers, Aztecs, World Series, Super 
Bowl, motorcycle races, The Who concert, you name it. 
</P>
<P>
And not stinko tickets, either. 
</P>
<P>
In baseball, right next to team owner Joan Kroc's private box. In football, 
next to team owner Alex Spanos. With free parking, ushers to keep away the 
riffraff, and beer and hot dogs within easy reach. 
</P>
<P>
Such is the good life enjoyed by 26 public officials since the stadium opened 
in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
Under the bonds sold to build the stadium, two tickets are given to each member 
of the San Diego City Council, the Stadium Authority and the Board of 
Supervisors, plus the city manager, city attorney and county administrative 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
But now, Proposition 73, the political reform act adopted by statewide voters 
last year, threatens to ruin things for the supervisors and their 
administrative officer. The act restricts politicians to no more than $1,000 in 
gifts from a single source. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are thought to be immune because the city runs the stadium. They 
use the free tickets not for enjoyment, but as a way to monitor how an 
important public facility is being maintained. 
</P>
<P>
If you believe that, you probably also believe that men buy Playboy to read the 
articles. 
</P>
<P>
The public-facility argument wears thin when it comes to the supervisors and 
administrative officer because the county does not have day-to-day 
responsibility for the stadium. Supervisors Chairman Susan Golding has stopped 
using the tickets until the matter is sorted out. 
</P>
<P>
County Counsel Lloyd Harmon is negotiating with the state Fair Political 
Practices Commission to see if the supervisors and administrative officer can 
get an exemption from Proposition 73. 
</P>
<P>
The commission is set to discuss the ticket issue June 6. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The News Rolls Along 
</P>
<P>
There is always a local angle -- even in Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
Piper Parry, who helped get CNN film of Beijing despite the government news 
blackout, is the daughter of Brooks and Bill Parry of Del Mar. Brooks is a Del 
Mar Fair Board member; Bill is a retired real estate editor of the San Diego 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
Piper, 32, a publicist for Turner Broadcasting System based in Hong Kong, had 
gone to Beijing for the Sino-Soviet summit. 
</P>
<P>
She spent two nights in the crowded square when the student-led rebellion 
erupted. She was in the CNN bureau when Chinese bureaucrats pulled the plug on 
live broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
What followed was a scramble to get news film out of China, where 
transportation is snarled and confusion is rampant. 
</P>
<P>
Stranded at her hotel and unable to get her film to the airport, Parry 
discovered that the students view the news media as an ally in their standoff 
with the People's Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
Unsolicited, a student on a motorbike sped to the front of the hotel and, 
without asking any questions, motioned for Parry to hop on. 
</P>
<P>
The two weaved through the traffic blockades, and Parry's precious cargo was 
soon bound for the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bigger Fish to Fry 
</P>
<P>
As in so many other sports, the Europeans provide government subsidies to their 
mountain climbers, and the Americans are left to fend for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Enter corporate sponsorship. But there are only a few mountain-climbing 
equipment firms to go around, so American climbers must look for sponsors 
wherever they can. 
</P>
<P>
That explains why a group led by La Jolla climber Doug Dalquist will unfurl a 
red-and-yellow banner extolling the fish tacos at Rubio's Deli-Mex when they 
reach the top of Mt. McKinley in Alaska, the highest mountain (20,230 feet) in 
North America. 
</P>
<P>
The climbers, who begin the three-week trek Saturday, got $400 from Rubio's, 
which has restaurants in San Diego, San Marcos and Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
The banner -- "The Highest Fish Taco / Rubio's / Home of the Fish Taco" -- will 
fly long enough for pictures to be taken, before being packed up. It may 
reappear, however, at an even greater height. 
</P>
<P>
Dalquist needs sponsors for an assault next year on K2, a peak in the Himalayas 
that, at 28,250 feet, is second only to Mt. Everest.

SUPPORT GROUPS FOR AIDS VICTIMS, BATTERED WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two new community outreach programs have been announced by Frank Richelieu, 
pastor of the Redondo Beach Church of Religious Science. They are an AIDS 
support group called Being Alive, and a support group for battered women and 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Both programs are under the direction of the Rev. Cecile Brazille, staff 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
Being Alive -- for people with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, their 
families and friends -- meets privately at the church on the last Monday of 
each month. A meeting on the last Tuesday of each month is open to the public. 
Assisting in the program are Dr. Neil Schram of Kaiser Permanente Hospital in 
Harbor City and Brother Richard, associate chaplain of Little Company of Mary 
Hospital in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
The Family Crisis Center, a shelter for battered women and children in the 
Redondo Beach area, is not located at the church but is assisted by the 
congregation's fund-raising activities. Donations are also sought to assist 
people with AIDS, many of whom are too ill to work. 
</P>
<P>
The church is located at 907 Knob Hill Ave., Redondo Beach. For more 
information, call 540-5080.

BOARD FAVORS PLAN TO SEND SOME TRUANTS TO JUVENILE HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BAIRD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Habitual truants could be sentenced to as many as five days in Juvenile Hall 
under a program informally endorsed this week by the Centinela Valley Union 
High School District Board of Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the trustees said Tuesday night that they favor the program, which was 
created by Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner and will be presented for formal approval at 
the next board meeting on June 13. The program would take effect in September. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope something will click so there will be a turnaround" in the truancy 
problem, said trustee Ruth Morales. "Even if the statistics change just a 
little bit, I think it's a step in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
About 10% of the district's 6,100 high school students merit special counseling 
and programs outside the regular classroom because of serious truancy problems, 
Supt. McKinley M. Nash said in an interview Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Only students with the most intractable problems -- 1% or fewer -- would be 
likely to be referred for possible incarceration under the district attorney's 
new Truancy Mediation Program, Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the student penalties in the program, parents would face 
prosecution if they are found to be responsible for their children's excessive 
absences -- when, for example, they repeatedly write false excuses or keep a 
teen-ager home to baby-sit. A first-time infraction by a parent could carry a 
fine of up to $100 or special counseling; the most serious misdemeanor offense 
could mean a $500 fine and 25 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney would be called in only after counseling and other school 
truancy programs had been tried without success, according to Adalbert T. 
Botello, chief deputy of the district attorney's juvenile division in 
Inglewood, who spoke to the school board Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Centinela Valley is the first school district in the South Bay to hear a formal 
presentation on the new countywide program, Botello said. An official in the 
district attorney's office said Thursday that 160 truants have been referred to 
the program countywide, though she was unable to say what school districts the 
students attended. None of those students have yet been sent to Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Nash praised the program, which provides stiff penalties to deter students from 
chronic truancy. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Centinela Valley district's overall dropout rate is less than 14%, 
compared to 37% statewide, partly because of its intensive efforts to deter 
truancy. But the district wants to reduce truancy even further, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Link to Achievement 
</P>
<P>
In the first semester of the current school year, 9% of Hawthorne High School 
students were picked up as truants. The rate was 12% at Leuzinger High School, 
Nash said. Each school has an enrollment of about 2,700. The remainder of 
students in the district attend Lloyde High School, an alternative education 
program for students who have difficulties in the regular program. 
</P>
<P>
District officials hope the program will have a positive effect on learning by 
keeping more students in school, Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
The program is also expected to reduce gang activity and daytime crimes 
committed by truants in Hawthorne, Lawndale and Lennox, Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner, in unveiling the program in February, said law enforcement agencies 
have found that habitual truancy "is the No. 1 precursor of ultimately serious 
criminal behavior." 
</P>
<P>
"If you can clear the streets of truants, you can dramatically reduce daytime 
residential burglaries," he said. Up to two-thirds of such crimes are committed 
by truants, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's meeting, Deputy Dist. Atty. Leslie Hanke described how California 
educators and law enforcement officials have grown increasingly frustrated with 
the state's truancy problem since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
That year, the Legislature enacted a law limiting the power of the juvenile 
courts to incarcerate habitual truants and juvenile status offenders, those who 
commit an offense that would not be a crime if they were committed by an adult, 
such as curfew violations. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, she said, the district attorney's office "got out of the business" 
of prosecuting habitual truants. Local School Attendance Review Boards were 
created to take over the work previously handled by the juvenile courts. These 
boards, however, had no authority to compel students to attend school, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A 1988 state Supreme Court ruling restored the district attorney's authority to 
incarcerate habitual truants for up to five days when found in contempt of 
court, for such things as violating an order to attend school or counseling. 
</P>
<P>
The emphasis will be on returning youngsters to school, not keeping them in 
custody, Hanke said. "Our purpose is not to incarcerate truants, but to assist 
in returning kids to school," she said. 
</P>
<P>
At the trustees' meeting June 13, Nash will discuss existing truancy programs 
that would have to be tried before the district would refer a case to the 
district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
After the presentation, Botello and Hanke fielded questions asked by teen-age 
students from a night-school government class who attended Tuesday's board 
meeting at Nash's request. 
</P>
<P>
The students, some of whom were in night school to complete classes they missed 
because of truancy, listened attentively to the presentation. 
</P>
<P>
They were particularly concerned about whether missing a single class or a 
single day would trigger the penalties, and were assured that the district 
attorney would be consulted only as a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of students also objected to the penalties for parents, saying that 
high-school students, not parents, should be held responsible. Hanke said 
parents would only be prosecuted when it can be shown that they were directly 
responsible for allowing children to remain out of school. 
</P>
<P>
TRUANCY PROGRAM AT CENTINELA VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
The school district currently notifies parents on the fifth day of an unexcused 
absence. 
</P>
<P>
Students can make up missed class time after school or, for substantial amounts 
of time, on Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
If the student's truancy continues, he is assigned to "Opportunity Classes," 
where students receive special counseling and stay in the same classroom for 
two or three periods to reduce the opportunity to leave school. 
</P>
<P>
The next step is referral to continuation school, where the district provides 
one teacher for each 12 students, compared to 20 in the Opportunity Classes and 
26 in regular classes. The smaller classes provide special counseling to help 
students get back on track. 
</P>
<P>
Students also are picked up by patrols for the truancy abatement program 
sponsored by the city of Hawthorne and the school district. Truants are picked 
up and taken to Lloyde High School, a continuation school campus for 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new program, the district would create a School Attendance Review 
Board that would hear the most severe cases and provide intensified counseling 
for students and parents. 
</P>
<P>
If truancy continues, the case would be referred to the district attorney's 
office, which would ask a judge to order the student to attend school or 
counseling. If the student violates that order, he could be sent to Juvenile 
Hall.

NATURAL HABITAT RECONSTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recent news articles reported a search for natural habitats that could be 
improved or built to offset the destruction of wetlands by the ports of Los 
Angeles and Long Beach. Among habitats being considered are new artificial 
reefs off the local coastline, but such reefs do not meet federal and state 
criteria and do not compete with tide pools in the production of flora and 
fauna. 
</P>
<P>
The best habitat to reconstruct is the beach, tidal and sub-tidal areas in the 
Abalone Cove-Portuguese Bend landslide areas. About two miles of coastline have 
been severely damaged and neglected for years. The sand beaches and productive 
tide pool areas have been replaced or covered with landslide debris consisting 
of small rocks and cobbles that support very little sea life. The sub-tidal 
area that was reef rock and sand is now covered with silt mud that has 
smothered most of the flora and fauna. Near-shore sea life can't compete with 
loose rocks and mud. 
</P>
<P>
Let's rectify the damage that started in 1956. State and federal laws require 
that habitats destroyed by planned port construction be offset by repairing 
conditions elsewhere -- in this case, the Portuguese Bend and Abalone Cove 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
The repair of the Portuguese Bend coastal area (splash zone, tidal and 
sub-tidal areas) involving 100 acres will very likely be as valuable to the 
ocean environment as the Seal Beach (Naval) Weapons Station wetlands 
reconstruction.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE

<TEXT>
<P>
1990 Budget 
</P>
<P>
The House passed, 241 to 185, the conference report on House Resolution 106 
giving Congress spending, revenue and deficit targets for the fiscal year 
beginning Oct. 1. The Senate followed suit and HR 106 is now in effect. 
</P>
<P>
The fiscal plan was developed by the Republican White House and Democratic 
Congress. It formalizes President Bush's pledge of no new taxes but projects 
$5.3 billion in largely unspecified new revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The plan assumes spending of $1.17 trillion, revenue of $1.07 trillion and a 
deficit within the Gramm-Rudman law's $100-million target. All sides conceded 
it avoids tough fiscal decisions and that its goal of a $100-million deficit is 
wishful thinking. Members looking for a bright spot said the agreement shows 
the President and Congress can work harmoniously toward fiscal goals. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the fiscal 1990 budget.

SALE OF GARDENA'S HORSESHOE CLUB STALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sale of the Horseshoe Club, one of Gardena's three poker clubs, was put on 
hold this week when the City Council voted to table a proposal from a group of 
investors who balked at the city's requirements for a license transfer. 
</P>
<P>
City officials on Tuesday told prospective buyer Herbert Stern and his partner, 
Leonard Baum, that before the city would approve issuing a license to the 
group, five conditions must be met, including setting up a $180,000 escrow 
account to cover four weeks pay for the club's 250 employees. 
</P>
<P>
The city also requested a letter of credit for $6 million to cover the first 
year of operation under new ownership and an audit of the club's finances after 
its first year of operation. Stern, former president of an investment group 
that owned the Commerce Club, must also sever all ties with that club, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the conditions were necessary to ensure the club's financial 
solvency during an extensive remodeling of club facilities at Vermont and 
Rosecrans avenues. 
</P>
<P>
But Baum, a Los Angeles attorney, told the council that trying to obtain a $6 
million letter of credit while working out a plan to finance purchase of the 
club "is not prudent at this time from a business standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
Stern asked the council for at least six months to come up with a financing 
plan and to find additional investors to back it. Stern and Baum had proposed 
buying the club for $4 million and have paid the city $9,000 in application 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's meeting, City Councilman Mas Fukai requested that the council get 
a status report on the group's progress within 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said the club closed Wednesday for remodeling, which will be 
paid for by the present owners, City Manager Kenneth Landau said. The 
remodeling is scheduled to take about three weeks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The present owners, the Horseshoe Club limited partnership, is a group of about 
100 investors who have owned the club since 1951, said spokesman and general 
manager Miles Corwin. The group has been seeking a buyer for about a year, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Before new owners can take over, the city and the state attorney general's 
office must do background checks of investors and license the owners, Landau 
said. The city investigation of Baum and Stern is continuing, he said.

TRUMP READY TO TAKE OVER SHUTTLE 
</P>

NEW YORK

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Donald J. Trump is not known for his modesty. He names a lot of things after 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
There are the Trump Plaza &amp; Casino and the Trump Castle &amp; Casino in 
Atlantic City, N.J.; the 68-story Trump Tower office and apartment building, 
the Trump Plaza cooperative and Trump Parc condominiums in Manhattan; the Trump 
Plaza condominiums in Palm Beach, Fla., and his 282-foot Trump Princess, the 
world's largest private yacht. 
</P>
<P>
Now he's got an airline bearing his name. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Paint Airliners 
</P>
<P>
"I put my name on something when I really feel that it is going to be right," 
he said at a news conference at New York's swank Plaza Hotel -- which he 
acquired a year ago but has not named for himself, presumably because there are 
already too many Trump Plazas. 
</P>
<P>
Trump did not try to hide his jubilation as he talked to reporters Thursday 
hours after U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland signed the order allowing 
Eastern Airlines to sell its Northeast shuttle to Trump. 
</P>
<P>
The New York hotel owner and real estate developer said the Trump Shuttle's 21 
airliners will be painted white with black, red and gold stripes. Trump's name 
will be painted on each side of the planes; on the tail there will be a giant 
T. He said he will take over the shuttle from Eastern in about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives me as much pleasure as buying the Plaza Hotel," he said. "This is 
something that from day one I have said I want to have my name on." 
</P>
<P>
Trump even boasted that his name is what finally won him the shuttle in the 
contest he had been having over it in bankruptcy court with America West 
Airlines. Phoenix-based America West offered more for the shuttle than Trump's 
$365 million but could not come up with the financing to support the bid. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw one report that said that the biggest disadvantage America West had was 
that it did not have the Trump name," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy court, which has been in charge of Eastern's affairs since it 
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy March 9, must approve the sale of any of the 
carrier's assets. 
</P>
<P>
Trump and Bruce Nobles, a man who began his airline career with American 
Airlines 23 years ago as a reservations clerk and is now president of the Trump 
Shuttle, declined to say what specific changes would be made in the shuttle 
service, which links New York with Boston and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
They would not say if fares will be cut in an effort to win back some of the 
passengers lost to the Pan Am Shuttle in the last three months. The two 
shuttles each had about half of the traffic before Eastern's machinists went on 
strike March 4. Since then, Eastern's share has slipped to 23%. 
</P>
<P>
The Trump Shuttle will employ about 1,000 people, of whom 800 will be former 
Eastern workers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Planes Are Safe 
</P>
<P>
Trump and Nobles did say that the planes -- all aging Boeing 727s -- will be 
refurbished during the next year and that some new planes will ultimately be 
acquired. 
</P>
<P>
But the shuttle's present planes are safe, Trump said. Because of Eastern's 
recent troubles, he added, the airliners have been more closely inspected than 
those of any other carrier. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, "We are going to go over them totally, impeccably 
carefully. We will X-ray every part, every inch. They are not only going to be 
the safest planes in the air, they are going to be magnificent to look at."

Albertson's Inc.: The Boise, Ida.-based grocery and drug store company said 
first-quarter earnings rose 25% to $44.4 million from a year ago on sales of 
$1.8 billion, a 16.6% increase. The company said the increase was due primarily 
to added efficiencies in its distribution operations generated by strong sales 
and gains from a new distribution center in Portland, Ore.

MATSUI SEEKS TO CLOSE TAX LOOPHOLE FOR UTILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento), in a major reversal, introduced a bill 
Thursday to plug a tax loophole that has allowed utilities to amass $19 billion 
in unneeded tax money collected from ratepayers. 
</P>
<P>
Matsui accused utilities of "pure greed" for not yet returning the excess money 
to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
A clause authored by Matsui in the 1986 Tax Reform Act allowed utilities to 
refund slowly -- over a period of 30 years -- money they have collected from 
customers for tax payments that they no longer owed because their corporate tax 
bills were reduced. The 1986 tax law reduced the corporate tax rate from 46% to 
34%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Money Is on Loan' 
</P>
<P>
"I think I really made a mistake," Matsui said in an interview. "I accept full 
responsibility." He also said passage of the corrective legislation represents 
a top priority for him, but he conceded that his bill faces an uphill struggle 
against the powerful utility lobby. 
</P>
<P>
Matsui's bill would allow state regulators to establish a schedule for 
returning the money in the form of utility rate reductions over a period of 
three years, beginning in 1991. The bill does not require a rebate. 
</P>
<P>
"That (money) is a loan the consumers of America made to the utilities -- tax 
free," Matsui said. "Never before in my 11 years in Congress has an issue been 
as crystal clear as this one. It's a matter of right vs. wrong, good public 
policy vs. bad special interests, ethics vs. greed." 
</P>
<P>
Matsui accused the utility industry of "bribery" by responding to his requests 
for information on the issue by highlighting its campaign contributions to him. 
"When you have a tough case, you don't try to bribe the judge," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Matsui introduced his bill at a press conference with the support of 21 
consumer groups, including the American Assn. of Retired Persons and Citizens 
for Tax Justice. State utility regulators from New York and Illinois also 
called for support of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Matsui's bill is similar to one introduced in February by Rep. Byron L. Dorgan 
(D-N.D.), who has been the leader on the issue. Dorgan, speaking at the press 
conference, said he supports Matsui's bill as a "reasonable compromise." 
</P>
<P>
Dorgan said the issue, despite the complexity of tax laws, is very simple. "The 
many are owed money by the few," he said. 
</P>
<P>
California ratepayers, topping those in all other states, have given $1.9 
billion to utilities to offset expected taxes. California Public Utility 
Commissioner Stanley W. Hulett predicted that if the bill becomes law, the 
commission would begin a broad review of utility companies to determine their 
financial ability to compensate consumers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Need Money for Investment 
</P>
<P>
Hulett, who brought the issue to Matsui's attention two years ago, said he 
could not predict by how much consumers' utility rates could be reduced, if 
any, until such a review is complete. 
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman for Pacific Telesis, parent of Pacific Bell, estimated 
that the rate cut that would be given its customers under Matsui's proposal 
would amount to about 70 cents a month each for three years.

SUZUKI DECIDES TO PUT ITS AD ACCOUNT UP FOR GRABS

Suzuki has hit the road for a new advertising agency. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese auto maker, which has still not recovered from year-old safety 
concerns over its Samurai sport utility vehicles, said on Thursday that it was 
placing its estimated $15 million to $30 million advertising business up for 
grabs. 
</P>
<P>
Suzuki sales have nose-dived since last June when Consumer Reports harshly 
condemned the Samurai as being prone to roll-overs and asked for a recall of 
all Samurai vehicles. The federal government later found that the Samurai was 
no worse than the average utility vehicle in its class. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of recalling its vehicles, however, the Japanese importer is recalling 
its Los Angeles ad agency, Keye/Donna/Pearlstein. The agency has created Suzuki 
ads -- such as billboards with the headline, "A Cure for the Car Sick" -- since 
Brea-based American Suzuki Motor Corp. began importing the vehicles into the 
United States four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"When Suzuki first entered the U.S, it looked for an ad firm without automotive 
experience so they could bring a fresh perspective," said Laura Segal, a 
spokeswoman for Suzuki. "But Suzuki is changing and expanding its product line, 
and that may require something different." 
</P>
<P>
Although Keye/Donna was asked to participate in the review, the agency has not 
responded to that request. "We want to take a few days to think about it," said 
Leonard Pearlstein, president of Keye/Donna/Pearlstein. "I can tell you, we 
were surprised by their decision." 
</P>
<P>
It is not all that unusual, however, for troubled businesses to blame their ad 
agencies for their problems. And Suzuki has plenty of them. Sales of its 
Samurai dropped nearly 89% in the first quarter of 1989, compared to the first 
quarter 1988. That's 1,914 Samurais sold during the period this year, compared 
to 16,783 during the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
Several ad industry executives said they now expect that beleaguered Suzuki 
will name a new agency by mid-summer. 
</P>
<P>
"Suzuki's problems are much larger than their ad agency," said Peter Stranger, 
president of the Los Angeles office of Della Femina, McNamee WCRS, which 
creates the "Joe Isuzu" ads for American Isuzu Motors Corp. "To punish the ad 
agency for this is ludicrous."

LIN Plans Spinoff: LIN Broadcasting Corp., which has interests in television, 
cellular telephone service and publishing, said its board has approved in 
principle spinning off its seven TV stations as a separate company. The 
company, a frequent subject of takeover speculation, said the spinoff would be 
"for operating purposes aimed at maximum development of the company's two 
principal businesses, each of which will operate as an independent publicly 
held company." Wall Streeters pushed the company's stock sharply higher on the 
news, and LIN's stock rose $4.75 a share to $101 in over-the-counter trading. 
Analysts have said the company's cellular telephone business has proven 
increasingly attractive as that fledgling industry has expanded rapidly.

Sales of previously owned single-family homes fell 1.1% in April, reflecting an 
industry slump caused by higher mortgage interest rates, the National Assn. of 
Realtors said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
April resales slipped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.36 million 
units, the slowest since February, 1988, when the rate was 3.32 million units. 
The rate was down 4.3% from year-ago levels. 
</P>
<P>
"Higher interest rates have stymied efforts of renters to become homeowners," 
said association President Ira Gribin. "First-time buyers, with no equity and a 
tight budget, continue to be left behind, particularly in high-cost areas." 
</P>
<P>
The national median price for a single-family home rose $1,500 to $93,500 last 
month, up 6.3% from year-ago levels, the NAR said. The higher median price 
reflects the purchase of more expensive homes by people less likely to feel the 
pinch of higher mortgage costs, Gribin said. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's benchmark mortgage rate ranged from 11.03% to 11.07% in April, 
according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., the NAR said. 
</P>
<P>
There were 2.64 million single-family homes on the market in April, a 9.4-month 
housing supply. The NAR, the trade group of the real estate industry, forecasts 
a boom in resales in the second half of 1989, sparked by a decline in interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
Regionally, the resales slump was led by a 7.5% decline in the West, which had 
been enjoying brisk activity. The West had the sharpest median price increase, 
19.5% from year-ago levels. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that higher rates have worked their way into the hottest markets," 
said NAR chief economist John Tuccillo. 
</P>
<P>
Resales were flat in the South -- the region with the highest sales volume -- 
while the pace picked up in the Northeast and Midwest.

The stock market closed on a mixed note Thursday, with blue chips easing and 
the broader market rising as an economic report indicated a slowdown in the 
economy and suggested that inflation may still be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials dropped 1.28 to 2,482.59. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 154.47 million shares, down from 
178.60 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
While the revised figure was lower than expected, analysts said growth had been 
dampened chiefly by large inventory declines. Lower inventories actually help 
the economy grow in the future because they show that businesses will need to 
produce more goods to meet demand. 
</P>
<P>
That initially appeared to be a plus for stocks by reinforcing evidence that 
the economy was slowing in response to the Federal Reserve's campaign to 
restrain inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
But accompanying figures showed no downward revision of the pace of inflation 
over the January-March period. 
</P>
<P>
Among actively traded blue chips, Philip Morris rose 2 5/8 to 140; Eastman 
Kodak gained 1/8 to 44 7/8; General Electric dropped 7/8 to 52 3/4, and 
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph was down 1/4 at 35 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
Takeover rumors and speculation sparked active trading in such issues as 
Maytag, up 2 1/8 at 23 1/2, and Syntex, up 1 1/4 at 47 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Del Webb Corp. rose 7/8 to 13 7/8 on word of the cancellation of a planned 
offering of $50 million in convertible debentures. The company cited market 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The debentures would have had the potential to increase the number of claims on 
the company's earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted some tentative buying in depressed precious-metals stocks. ASA 
Ltd. rose 1/2 to 39 5/8 and Hecla Mining 1/4 to 12 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
LIN Broadcasting climbed 4 3/4 to 101 in the over-the-counter market. The 
company announced plans to spin off a new subsidiary that will own seven of its 
television stations. 
</P>
<P>
A slightly weaker U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen on the foreign currency 
markets sent stocks prices higher in slow trading Thursday on the Tokyo Stock 
Exchange. The key Nikkei 225-share average closed up 153.57 points at 
34,005.39. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices ended slightly higher on London's Stock Exchange, gaining little 
incentive from British trade figures that were in line with market 
expectations. The 100-share index closed 3.9 points higher at 2,136.6. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
In the credit markets, bond prices fell sharply, depressed by the disappointing 
GNP report and by the dollar's slide on foreign exchange markets. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's key 30-year bond fell 17/32 point, or $5.31 per $1,000 in face 
amount, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, rose 
to 8.67% from 8.62% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices began their decline early in the day, after the government's 
revised report on the gross national product was issued. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts also said the report still indicates a robust economy. 
</P>
<P>
When the economy is strong, the Federal Reserve is less likely to loosen 
credit, and allow interest rates to fall. If credit remains tight, interest 
rates will rise and, conversely, bond prices will slip. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded 
at 9.813%, up from 9.75% Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Grain and soybean prices were mixed in light trading on the Chicago Board of 
Trade but received some strength from a weaker dollar. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, precious metal prices climbed, livestock and meat prices were 
mixed, and energy futures were mostly lower. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell as concern grew about central bank intervention and interest 
rate hikes abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The weakened dollar brought some buyers back into the grain and soybean 
markets. Its strength had been believed to be holding down export sales of 
grain, analysts said, since a more expensive dollar makes U.S. commodities less 
attractive to foreign buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Corn and soybean prices bounced back despite the National Weather Service's 
latest 6- to 10-day outlook. The forecast, released late Wednesday, calls for 
normal to above-normal rain in most major growing areas. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say soybean futures have lost about 65 cents during the past two 
weeks. And there is a feeling that the selloff is a little overdone, setting 
the stage for a short-term rally, said Anne Frick, an analyst with 
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Energy futures were mostly lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Livestock prices were mixed and pork futures mostly lower on the Chicago Board 
of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
"Pork bellies were down because we have a large inventory," said Dale 
Durchholz, an analyst with Agri-Visor Service Inc. in Bloomington, Ill.

ECONOMY GROWS MORE SLOWLY THAN EXPECTED

<P>
The nation's economy grew at an annual rate of 4.3% during the first three 
months of the year, well below the 5.5% estimated a month ago and far slower 
than analysts had expected, the Commerce Department said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
And excluding the farm economy, which rebounded briskly from last year's 
drought, economic expansion was only 1.8%, down from the 3% reported earlier. 
By contrast, the non-farm economy grew 3.5% in the last quarter of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in reported growth had little impact in financial markets 
Thursday, as the Dow Jones industrial index fell by barely more than a point. 
</P>
<P>
And it drew varying interpretations from economists. Some said a slowdown of 
near-recession proportions might be imminent; others predicted a quick 
turnaround and faster growth next year. 
</P>
<P>
Hidden in the revised estimate was evidence, welcome to most economists, that a 
previously reported slowdown in domestic consumption was offset by a stronger 
trade performance than earlier reported, mainly because of greater exports. 
</P>
<P>
Bigger sales overseas of American goods in turn permitted manufacturers to 
reduce business inventories at a faster clip than earlier reported. Although 
that retards economic output in the short term, it prepares the way for renewed 
production later on. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a separate report Thursday that likewise pointed to slower growth 
so far this year than earlier had been expected, the Commerce Department said 
corporate profits in the first quarter fell $21.6 billion, or 1.7%, to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $319.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Signs of Slowdown 
</P>
<P>
This was the biggest decline in profits since a 2.5% drop in the fourth quarter 
of 1987, when the stock market crashed. In the fourth quarter of 1988, profits 
increased $10.9 billion, according to a revised report issued Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"With this revision, it looks even more like a slowdown has already set in this 
year," said Giulio Martini of Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., a New York 
investment banking firm. "But with this drop in business inventories, the 
question now becomes, how much further can the slowdown go? It now looks much 
more likely that the economy will be primed to rebound in the fourth quarter, 
rather than waiting for next year." 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein's current estimate: two more quarters of limping growth at or near 
the non-farm 1.8% annual growth now estimated for the first quarter, then a big 
rebound to 4% in the last three months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, First Interstate Bancorp of Los Angeles sees an economic slowdown for 
the rest of the year before a rebound next year. 
</P>
<P>
"What this indicates was that the first quarter was much weaker than we had 
thought, that March was weaker than February and that February was weaker than 
January," said Kenneth Ackbarali, a First Interstate economist. "It supports 
our case that we are close to the onset of a mild and brief recession." 
</P>
<P>
But thanks to the strong growth in exports and the inventory slowdown, 
Ackbarali predicted, there will be nothing like the collapse of jobs growth 
that occurred in 1982, and thanks to expected vigorous reaction by the Federal 
Reserve Board, a quick rebound can be anticipated early next year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Good News for Fed 
</P>
<P>
Even economists like Ackbarali, who see a recession as imminent, generally 
agree that the Fed has stopped squeezing the economy as inflation has moderated 
and will act to head off a serious slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
David Wyss of Data Resources, Inc., a forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass., 
said the Fed could not have asked for a more favorable report than Thursday's. 
</P>
<P>
"Real growth was a lot slower than expected," he said, "but inventories 
accounted for all the revision, so there's much less danger of an inventory 
correction later in the year. If anything, this increases the chances of a soft 
landing for the economy and reduces the chances of recession this year." 
</P>
<P>
In the language of economists, a soft landing is a slowdown to growth rates 
well within the Fed's declared inflation-moderating target of 2.5% a year, then 
a gradual resumption of the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Final sales, to some economists a crucial tell-tale measure of productive 
growth because they remove inventories from the accounting, were pegged by 
Thursday's report at an annual rate of $4.039 trillion in 1982 dollars, 
compared to $4.035 trillion in the earlier report. Final sales grew at a 3.5% 
rate over the previous quarter, compared to 3% in the earlier report.

EXPRESSLY ORIENTAL

<P>
Ordinarily, fashion and politics are magnets that attract, but not one another. 
Yet this spring, while Chinese citizens gather in Beijing's Tian An Men Square 
to express their desire for Western-style democracy, American jewelry designers 
are expressing appreciation for Far Eastern aesthetics. 
</P>
<P>
Some would call it mere coincidence, others would say it is happening because 
ideas that occur at opposite points can sometimes intersect. Coincidence or 
not, China is currently a source of influence for Western jewelry design. 
</P>
<P>
The designers themselves might explain it by recalling the first spark of 
inspiration they felt a year or two ago, as they watched scenes of royal 
opulence and lowly elegance in "The Last Emperor," a historical epic included 
on many must-see movie lists. What they developed from there is not entirely 
unlike what the Chinese protesters in Beijing are aspiring toward now: a 
melding of old and new, East and West. 
</P>
<P>
California designers, including David Navarro in San Francisco and Sandra 
Burton in Los Angeles, are picking up on the neutral-toned, earthy shapes of 
Chinese country life and mixing them with ancient artifacts, yet creating 
modern designs. 
</P>
<P>
Coins, carved jade and soapstone, spiritual symbols and calligraphy are being 
reworked into contemporary silhouettes made of wrapped, knotted and tied 
leather, decorative passementerie, cords and tassels mixed with metal, stones 
combined with beads -- all taken from the Chinese tradition. 
</P>
<P>
The season's new length for necklaces is as long as any the Emperor would wear. 
Some reach to the waist or beyond. Bracelets can be jumbles of ancient charms 
on sculptural bangles. Earrings reflect cultural images and dangle like 
delicate wind chimes. 
</P>
<P>
"I've often gone to the Orient looking for adaptable pieces for my jewelry," 
says Navarro, known for his ethnic designs made of museum-quality artifacts. He 
mentions small bells, nails and bits of cloisonne (the colorful enameled work) 
he has found. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a beauty, a mystery, a sense of history and intrinsic value to them 
that exists independently of fashion," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Other jewelers, including New York's Robert Lee Morris as well as Los Angeles' 
Deanna Hamro, are opting for Asian opulence as their inspiration -- part 
Chinese Empress, but part Chanel as well, and, of course, part modern American. 
Vibrantly colored, faux or real stones, including lapis blue, cinnabar red, 
Emperor yellow, carnelian orange or jade green mixed with bright yellow-gold 
are used to reinterpret ancient Chinese shapes and symbols. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked back to the 14th Century to find my 24-karat gold color and the rich 
feeling of design," Hamro says. "I see it as a marriage of ancient Oriental and 
renaissance periods. Mine is the type of ethnic jewelry the aristocracy might 
have worn." 
</P>
<P>
Morris was drawn to the vibrant colors of the Chinese designs he sees in his 
New York neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"Living on the edge of Chinatown, I decided to do my own updated version of an 
ancient look," he says. 
</P>
<P>
In the world of fashion, Chinese inspiration does not exist in jewelry alone. 
Ready-to-wear designers are feeling the Asian influence too. Harriet Selwyn and 
Rosemary Peck, a Los Angeles team, are showing boxier silhouettes for spring, 
with Mandarin collars and frog closings. 
</P>
<P>
Italian designer Romeo Gigli is reveling in the Far Eastern sensibility with 
his extravagant embroideries, golden-toned fabrics and sensuously wrapped 
shapes. Turkish-born designer Rifat Ozbek, who works in London, is looking 
towards the Far East to inspire his brocade-trimmed robes. 
</P>
<P>
This latest modernization of a Far Eastern look occurs in the way people 
reassemble the classics. An ancient Chinese-inspired necklace worn with a 
T-shirt and jeans is a modern, young statement. For dressier times, a Chanel 
suit accessorized with an armload of gold-leaf, bamboo bangles or 
cinnabar-studded earrings hints of the Orient. 
</P>
<P>
Even such unlikely items as an English Fair Isle sweater or a Giorgio Armani 
jacket can become chinoiserie, by mixing it with one special effect inspired by 
the Ancient Civilization.

8,000 MILES OF PIPELINES CROSS STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 14-inch pipeline that ruptured and set off a deadly fire in a San 
Bernardino neighborhood Thursday is part of 8,000 miles of pipeline that carry 
oil, gasoline and other hazardous liquids under many residential communities 
throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
One major line, for instance, bisects Orange County from Buena Park to San 
Clemente, although it mostly avoids residential areas, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We would not look very favorably on constructing pipelines through a 
residential area, but to get to the refineries, you have to go through those 
areas," said Thomas Lael, associate pipeline safety engineer in the state fire 
marshal's office. "You are between a rock and a hard place." 
</P>
<P>
The largest concentration of these lines is under the Los Angeles Basin, and 
many, possibly most, run near or under residential communities, Lael said. Each 
month, there are 15 to 20 leaks or pipeline spills statewide, ranging from a 
few ounces of fuel to 1,000 barrels. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to make it sound routine, but with that many miles of pipeline, 
this (a spill or leak) is just a normal occurrence" caused by pipe corrosion, 
he said. "Most of them are real small leaks anyway, a quart or a gallon or a 
pint." 
</P>
<P>
Explosions are rare. 
</P>
<P>
"With 99% of the spills, there is no fire or ignition," Lael said . "This (the 
San Bernardino blaze) is the exception. You need to have a source of ignition, 
like a vehicle with an engine running or a cigarette." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Orange County Spill 
</P>
<P>
Neal Osborne, a San Bernardino County planning analyst, said the houses that 
burned Thursday were built in the early 1970s, a time when the proximity of a 
pipeline probably would not have been considered and no environmental impact 
report was required. 
</P>
<P>
"There wouldn't have been any environmental determination made," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Thursday's explosion brought to mind the 1986 pipeline 
rupture that spewed 500,000 gallons of unleaded gasoline into a flood control 
channel adjacent to the Tustin Marine Corps Helicopter Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing there wasn't an explosion then," said Robert Collacott, manager 
of Orange County's environmental resources division. "All it would have taken 
would have been a spark." 
</P>
<P>
That rupture occurred along the county's main pipeline, a 40-mile-long common 
carrier for most Southern California oil companies that is operated by the San 
Diego Pipeline Co. The oil companies pay a fee for using the pipeline, which is 
16 inches wide and propels liquids using pressure of up to 1,600 pounds per 
square inch, Collacott said. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Pipeline Co. line roughly parallels the Santa Ana Freeway through 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the pipelines in Orange County carry less volatile crude oil, said Ed 
Ferrer, a construction engineer and a specialist in pipeline construction. 
"Most of them run from the Huntington Beach area to the refinery districts in 
L.A. County," Ferrer said. 
</P>
<P>
The pipeline that caused the San Bernardino explosion transports 80,000 barrels 
of gasoline 250 miles each day from Colton to Las Vegas. It is owned by Calnev 
Pipe Line Co., a common carrier that state officials characterize as 
"cooperative." 
</P>
<P>
The company "has a good safety record," said James Wait, acting manager of the 
pipeline safety program for the state fire marshal. 
</P>
<P>
It was Wait's office that gave the pipeline a clean bill on May 16, the last 
inspection after the May 12 train derailment. "Everything looked fine to us and 
to the operators," Wait said. 
</P>
<P>
After the train wreck, his office had engineers on the site each day during the 
cleanup "making sure we did everything we could to avoid a puncture or an 
accident." 
</P>
<P>
"We thought that process was finished and we had succeeded. . . ." he said. 
"It's just a mystery at this point." 
</P>
<P>
The fire marshal works with the U.S. Department of Transportation to enforce 
pipeline safety laws. Usually, the fire marshal inspects a pipeline every year

In California, real estate brokers are required to disclose the existence of a 
gasoline line to buyers only if it is on the property, not just nearby, said 
George Hartwell, spokesman for the state Department of Real Estate. 
Subdivisions have more extensive disclosure requirements, and the presence of a 
nearby gasoline pipeline would have to be reported. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the area devastated by Thursday's blast said they were unaware of 
the gasoline line that skirted their neighborhood until its existence became 
known after the train wreck two weeks ago.

Ethiopian President Mengistu Haile Mariam has replaced his entire military high 
command, tightening his grip on the rebellious armed forces after last week's 
attempted coup. Deputy Prime Minister Addis Tedla, an air force major, was 
named commander in chief of the armed forces, according to a statement from the 
president's office. Tedla replaces Maj. Gen. Merid Negussie, a leader of the 
coup attempt who was killed in a May 16 gun battle at the Ministry of Defense. 
No successor has been named for Defense Minister Haile Giorgis Habte-Miriam, 
who was killed while resisting the abortive coup.

A federal appeals court ruling that upheld the right of a profoundly retarded 
boy to be educated at public expense was applauded by a disability advocate who 
said it lifts a threat to special education. The ruling Wednesday by the U.S. 
1st Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston overturned a U.S. District Court ruling 
in New Hampshire that said the boy, identified only as Timothy W., could not 
benefit from the services. "I feel it is a reaffirmation of what I thought was 
clear all along -- that all handicapped students are entitled to an education," 
said attorney Ronald Lospennato, who represented the boy and the Disabilities 
Rights Center.

Syrian troops fought fierce street battles with Iranian-backed militias south 
of Beirut, killing at least three people. Syria's Muslim militia allies also 
clashed with Christian forces across the so-called Green Line that divides 
Beirut, and three people were wounded, military officials said. The fighting 
south of Beirut reportedly started when Muslim Hezbollah (Party of God) gunmen 
attempted to seize truckloads of scarce butane gas at a storage complex in the 
waterfront district of Ouzai.

Investigators found more than 1,000 types of dangerous chemicals in a San 
Francisco Bay Area building when they served a search warrant in connection 
with drug conspiracy charges, federal agents said. The building at Oakland 
Research &amp; Laboratory Supplies Co. was filled with thousands of containers 
of hazardous chemicals, many of them corroded and stacked randomly on shelves. 
Agents had entered the building to search for records in connection with the 
indictment on drug charges of Vincent Gammill, said Bill Morley, a special 
agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration. Gammill was an employee of the 
supply company. No containers appeared to be leaking or in danger of exploding, 
according to officials. Most of the chemicals were stored in small quantities.

said she traveled from California in hopes of changing public opinion on 
capital punishment. "I think only God has the right to take another life," she 
said. Spenkelink's former pastor, Tom Feamster, said the anger he felt 10 years 
ago has yielded to sadness. "We really don't need to pray for John, he's OK,"

NAVY PROBING CRACKS IN NEW ATOM SUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Navy officials are investigating two severe cracks in the outer steel hull of a 
Los Angeles-class nuclear submarine under construction at the Electric Boat 
shipyard in Groton, Conn., officials said. The company described the cracks in 
the nearly completed Topeka, an SSN-688 fast-attack submarine, as "quite 
severe" and said workers may have to replace a portion of the giant pressure 
hull. Electric Boat said the cracks represent "a very unusual occurrence." The 
company is seeking to determine the cause of the cracks. Electric Boat, a 
division of General Dynamics Corp., said Armco Inc. of Parsippany, N.J., 
supplied the steel for the submarine. "It is too premature to identify any 
financial liabilities," the company said.

An ambitious plan to clean up the heavily polluted environment of the 
Netherlands by the year 2010 was submitted to Parliament by the government. 
However, it said 80% of that nation's forests may die even if the measures are 
put into effect. Among the goals are removing 7,000 toxic waste dumps, cutting 
pesticide and fertilizer use by 50% and reducing industrial discharges by 75%. 
The cost by 1994 would be more than $14 per month per household, according to 
Environment Minister Ed Nijpels. The plan, likely to be a major campaign issue, 
will be taken up by the new government after elections in September. Cabinet 
disagreements over a minor part of the plan brought down the government headed 
by Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers earlier this month.

CONTROLLERS' SITUATION STILL STIRS CONCERN; 
</P>
<P>
WORK CONDITIONS AT EL TORO FACILITY CALLED 'VERY POOR' 
</P>

Three years after it first described serious flaws in the nation's air traffic 
control system, a congressional watchdog agency said Thursday that the 
country's 14,400 air controllers are still seriously overworked, undertrained 
and demoralized. 
</P>
<P>
And there apparently are particular problems among the controllers who manage 
air traffic in and out of airports in Orange County and Long Beach, according 
to testimony at a congressional hearing on the study. 
</P>
<P>
Conditions at the air traffic control facility at the El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station, which handles flights in Orange County and much of the busy air 
corridor between Los Angeles and San Diego, "are poor, and I would go so far as 
to say very poor," said Randy Moore, who heads the local branch of the 
controllers union. Moore was among three air traffic controllers who testified 
at Thursday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The margin of safety in the nation's skies remains "less than desirable," 
although flying on commercial airliners is not unsafe, a consulting firm hired 
by the General Accounting Office concluded. The GAO is the congressional 
investigative agency that conducted the study at the request of the 
investigations and oversight subcommittee of the Public Works and 
Transportation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO report "says, in effect, nothing has changed" since the agency released 
its last study in 1986, said Rep. Guy V. Molinari (R-N.Y.), the ranking 
minority member of the subcommittee, which conducted the hearing on the safety 
of the nation's air control system. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, government safety officials blamed a near-collision between 
two airliners over Orange County last February on the failure of the Federal 
Aviation Administration, which employs the controllers, to correct problems at 
the Coast Terminal Radar Approach Control facility, the formal name of the El 
Toro tracking station. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they know the problem exists but I think it might take some public 
pushing like this hearing to actually get them in gear," Moore, in an 
interview, said of the FAA. "I hope they do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
The El Toro tracking facility "has been understaffed for some time," said 
Moore, the union local president. "In 1985 we had 22 (senior controllers). At 
the current date we have 23." 
</P>
<P>
Although the FAA has authorized a total of 65 controller positions at the 
station, only 45 are filled. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA has serious problems attracting controllers to Orange County because of 
the high cost of living, William Pollard, the FAA's associate administrator for 
air traffic, told the subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
"Our system is such that controllers would make the same amount of money in a 
lesser cost-of-living area," Pollard said. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA tried to solve the problem last year by asking Congress to authorize 
higher salaries for controllers working in New York, Chicago and Southern 
California. However, legislators granted the pay differential only to 
controllers working at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not the Only Problem 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's high cost of living is not the only problem facing the El Toro 
tracking station, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a prewar building we're in. We have 342 square feet with 16 positions, 
eight radar screens and eight handoff positions," he said. The air-conditioning 
system keeps half the room cold and the other half warm, and on occasion fumes 
from the jet engines of fighter planes landing at the El Toro air station have 
nauseated controllers at their screens, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
FAA acting administrator Robert E. Whittington told the subcommittee that his 
agency is already taking significant steps to increase the number of 
controllers, reduce their workload, curtail required overtime, update equipment 
and improve training. Whittington said he believes that controllers' morale is 
good. 
</P>
<P>
"The safety afforded by our air traffic control system remains high," 
Whittington said, citing statistics showing that near-collisions dropped from 
840 in 1986 to 712 in 1988, and that traffic controller errors fell from 1,202 
in 1986 to 1,042 last year. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO's finding that serious problems remain was based on a survey of 5,098 
controllers and air traffic supervisors. Responses were obtained from 80% of 
those to whom questionnaires were sent, a return rate that GAO officials 
described as remarkably high. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Findings 
</P>
<P>
The study found that: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sixty-five percent of the controllers said they routinely handle too many 
airplanes during peak traffic periods. Supervisors reported that 38% of their 
radar controllers handle too much traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nearly 60% of the controllers said that they typically work too long 
without a break. Although the FAA guidelines call for a break after every 2 
hours in front of the radar screen, 87% of the controllers said they had 
exceeded that limit at least once in the last month. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Although 43% of the controllers said they suffer from low morale, 
supervisors perceived controller morale as high. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A majority of the most senior and experienced controllers, who are formally 
designated as full performance level controllers, or FPLs, rated as inadequate 
nearly half of the procedures used to train new controllers. 
</P>
<P>
The figures are virtually unchanged from those presented in a 1986 report on a 
similar survey of controllers that was done in 1985, the study says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Worst Suspicions and Fears' 
</P>
<P>
"We find that the report bears out many of our worst suspicions and fears," 
testified R. Steve Bell, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers 
Assn., the controllers union. "I can say that the FAA has a tired and 
demoralized work force that is fed up with the empty promises that have been 
served up in the last 8 years. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It all boils down to business as usual. And it is a very poor way of doing 
business." 
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question from Rep. Glenn M. Anderson (D-Harbor City), chairman of 
the full committee, the official who headed the research effort for the GAO 
said that the survey results gave him pause. 
</P>
<P>
"It does give me some concern, not that the system is unsafe, but (about) what 
the FAA is willing to settle for as an acceptable level of safety." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1981, when President Reagan fired 11,400 striking members of the 
Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, the number of air traffic 
controllers has increased to only 14,437. That is about 1,800 fewer than the 
pre-strike total. In addition, there are about 3,300 fewer senior controllers 
than before the strike, the study says. 
</P>
<P>
But the figures may understate the problem because the volume of the nation's 
air traffic has increased each year, the study notes. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA in the next 4 years plans to close the El Toro tracking facility and 
relocate it, along with three other stations in Southern California, in a new, 
consolidated station at a site yet to be determined, Pollard said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the agency will spend about $250,000 to improve the facility, 
the FAA official added.

TODDLER GETS HER OWN ATTORNEY IN WAYNE-GIONIS DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Anastasia Pilar Gionis, the 2-year-old girl at the center of the custody battle 
between Aissa Wayne and Thomas Gionis, on Thursday was assigned her own lawyer 
to protect her interests. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Ronald E. Owen also named an independent psychologist to 
try to sort out wildly conflicting reports about the child's current well-being 
and agreed to reopen her parents' bitter custody hearing in light of recent 
criminal charges against Gionis. 
</P>
<P>
Owen, who earlier this year gave Gionis custody of the child, said the criminal 
charges against the Pomona surgeon in connection with last October's attack on 
Wayne raise "some strong suspicion that the doctor's moral character is not 
what is should be." 
</P>
<P>
Gionis, interrupting the judge's remarks as his lawyers tried to quiet him, 
shot back: "This is via the newspapers." 
</P>
<P>
Until Gionis' arrest last month, the question of Anastasia's custody had 
finally seemed settled. 
</P>
<P>
In January, after a lengthy and often emotional trial, Owen announced his 
intention to award custody of film legend John Wayne's granddaughter to Gionis 
-- in part because the judge found that Aissa Wayne was "emotionally immature" 
and lacked a proper commitment to parenting. 
</P>
<P>
But on April 4, Gionis was arrested on charges of masterminding an attack last 
October on Wayne and companion Roger Luby at Luby's Newport Beach estate. 
</P>
<P>
Because of Gionis' incarceration, Owen gave Wayne temporary custody of the 
child, allowing Gionis about 8 days of monitored visitation a month after his 
release from jail on bail. 
</P>
<P>
And on Thursday, Owen agreed to reopen the custody battle altogether, a move 
that Wayne later described as "a victory." 
</P>
<P>
Gionis' attorney, Ronald Cordova, said that his client has not been found 
guilty of anything and that there is no reason to reopen the custody case 
because the issues were thoroughly discussed at last year's trial. 
</P>
<P>
But Owen, while acknowledging that Gionis has not yet been tried, told the 
surgeon that "theoretically, your moral character would be somewhat of an issue 
if all these (allegations) are true." 
</P>
<P>
The judge put off setting a hearing to determine permanent custody until 
Gionis' criminal case is resolved. Gionis has been ordered to stand trial in 
Superior Court, but no date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Owen appointed Irvine psychologist W. Russell Johnson to 
examine Anastasia and report to him before a June 15 court hearing to review 
Anastasia's temporary custody. 
</P>
<P>
In advance of Thursday's hearing in Santa Ana, each side had offered the judge 
conflicting expert testimony about Anastasia's current state under the 
temporary care of her mother. One side depicted the girl as headed for "the 
insane asylum," the judge said, and the other depicted "the happiest little 
girl in the state of California." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm worried more about the child than I am about either one of you," the judge 
told her parents. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also agreed with a proposal by Gionis' attorney that the court 
appoint an independent counsel to represent Anastasia's interests in the 
ongoing dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne's attorney, E. Robert Lemkin, opposed the motion, telling the judge that 
"enough of a circus atmosphere" already exists without yet another lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
The judge overrode him, appointing attorney Judi A. Curtin to be the child's 
counsel. 
</P>
<P>
Also at the hearing, Owen ordered Gionis to give Wayne's attorneys financial 
records that she charges may show Gionis spent hundreds of thousands of dollars 
from a community trust fund for his own personal use.

COUNTY SEEKING MONEY FROM FUND FOR JAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County fiscal officers, always seeking ways to fund day-to-day operation of 
Orange County Jail, hope to get their hands on an additional $1 million 
annually from a fund set up to ease moves into new or expanded jail facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Woodyard of the county's administrative staff said the fund has about $1.8 
million in it from assessments on court fines and traffic tickets. It was set 
up 18 months ago, he said, at the same time as a similar fund in Solano County 
was established by the Legislature. The purpose of both funds is to provide 
money for transition staffs and to buy such things as heavy equipment at new or 
enlarged jail facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Both funds are scheduled to be terminated July 1, 1991, but Assemblyman Thomas 
M. Hannigan (D-Fairfield) has introduced a bill to extend the life of the 
Solano County fund indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Woodyard's office has recommended that Orange County supervisors support 
Hannigan's bill and try to have it amended so that it applies to both 
jurisdictions. 
</P>
<P>
Woodyard said the fund could still be used for transitions and will be used at 
Theo Lacy Branch Jail in Orange, when and if that facility is doubled in size. 
The county began construction there earlier this month, but a Superior Court 
judge ordered the work stopped until legal challenges have been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Woodyard admitted that that the $1 million is not a lot of money in this case. 
The annual cost of operating the county's jail facilities is estimated at $55 
million to $65 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The county's legislative planning committee, which includes all five 
supervisors and 11 other county officials, is scheduled to discuss Hannigan's 
bill next week.

ANAHEIM MAN SEES CHINESE TURMOIL FIRSTHAND; 
</P>
<P>
BANNER YEAR ENDS FOR DOCTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A young Anaheim doctor's round-the-world medical mission proved more exciting 
than he expected. It ended last week in Beijing, China -- right in the middle 
of thousands of demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
There, Dr. Christopher Coad waded through throngs of banner-waving students. He 
watched as peaceful demonstrators offered ice cream and water to guards from 
the People's Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
And at central Beijing's Tian An Men Square, he confessed to feeling a little 
"unnerved" when he discovered that he was one of "maybe four" Westerners among 
a million chanting people. 
</P>
<P>
Sporting a black tie decorated with a fiery Chinese dragon, the 31-year-old 
ophthalmologist was relaxing Thursday at his parents' Anaheim home after a 
yearlong fellowship with Project Orbis, a traveling eye clinic that is based 
inside a renovated DC-8. 
</P>
<P>
As one of five eye doctors assigned to Orbis, Coad had spent the year 
performing surgeries and training foreign doctors in India, Nepal, Thailand, 
Bangladesh, New Guinea and the Philippines. Orbis' last stop was a 3-week stay 
in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
But Coad, who was assigned to make final arrangements for that visit, arrived 
ahead of the rest of the team, on April 23, the same week the protests began. 
</P>
<P>
Coad said he spent his first days in Beijing uneventfully, laying plans for 
medical lectures and eye surgeries. But on April 27, as he walked from his 
hotel to Tian An Men Square for a meeting, "I was caught up in the largest 
demonstration they had ever had." 
</P>
<P>
The main street, Changan Boulevard, was blocked off, Coad recalled. "No buses 
were moving. No pedicabs were moving. . . . It was just students marching with 
their banners." 
</P>
<P>
Trying not to become associated with the marchers, Coad worked his way to the 
square by walking alongside the students, then "climbing through gardens, over 
fences." 
</P>
<P>
At first, Coad said, the students were demanding only greater press freedom and 
their movement seemed to be pro-government. "It was a reformist movement, not a 
revolutionary movement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But as the demonstrations continued, Coad said he watched the students begin to 
denounce hard-line Premier Li Peng and demand changes in government leadership. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Coad said workers seemed unsympathetic to the demonstrations as did 
the Chinese doctors who worked with Orbis. "In the beginning, most people just 
ignored it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But after several weeks, "the doctors were more supportive of the students. 
They still apologized for the inconvenience the demonstrators were causing, but 
they would start asking us what we thought of the democratic movement" in 
China, Coad said. 
</P>
<P>
As he worked with Chinese doctors, and in his spare time toured the city, Coad 
said he found many more demonstrators. When he visited the Great Wall of China 
about 40 miles outside of Beijing, he passed marchers on their way to Tian An 
Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
At ancient temples in Beijing and also in a section of the city called the 
Forbidden City, there were students carrying banners. 
</P>
<P>
Coad said he visited the square for the last time on May 18. By then, students 
had begun a hunger strike and were finally receiving so much support, from 
workers, professionals, everyone, that "the entire city was immobile," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That day, as he walked through the square with another American from Project 
Orbis, "We gave support to the demonstrators," Coad said. "We had seen a pro 
Sino-American banner, and you just kind of cheer." 
</P>
<P>
Coad left for Shanghai on May 19 -- "less than 24 hours before they declared 
martial law" in Beijing, he said. But even in Shanghai, more than 600 miles 
south of China's capital, there were demonstrators. They blocked the road from 
the airport so that the doctor had to carry his luggage the half mile to his 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations continued every day that he was in Shanghai, Coad said. But "it 
wasn't a scary movement -- there was more of a festival atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
When he finally left for Hong Kong, he found demonstrators there too -- holding 
a sympathy demonstration for Chinese on the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Coad's first day in Anaheim in a year, he said he was glad to be 
back. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very comforting to be home," he said, and added: "I'd rather watch the 
movement from here." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Coad said he is amazed by his China experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I was expecting a nice medical exchange -- talking to doctors interested in 
learning new microsurgical techniques. But it was remarkable to be there at 
such a time," he said. "You felt history was being made and you were right 
there."

SANTA ANA OFFICER FATALLY SHOOTS FLEEING SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Santa Ana police officer on Thursday shot and killed a fleeing suspect wanted 
in connection with two robberies earlier this year, a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The officer fired two shots at the man, one of which struck him in the back, 
after the suspect appeared to be reaching for an object in his waistband, Lt. 
Hugh Mooney said. The man was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange, where he 
was pronounced dead. His identity was withheld pending notification of 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
The officer's name was not released. 
</P>
<P>
Mooney said police later found a knife tucked in the suspect's waistband. 
</P>
<P>
Police confronted the suspect after an informant called to report that the man 
was in the area of 2000 W. Civic Center Drive. When an officer arrived, Mooney 
said, the suspect began to run.

TAYLOR TELLS COURT THAT RETURN TO COUNTY COULD COST HIS LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jail escapee Michael Douglas Taylor, fighting extradition from South Dakota to 
California, told a judge Thursday he does not want to be sent to Orange County, 
where he fears for his life in County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department, which oversees the 
jail, called Taylor's claims "hogwash" and an attempt to solicit sympathy from 
South Dakota extradition authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"We want him here; he escaped from (jail) here and we would like to try him 
here," said Sheriff's Lt. Robert Rivas. "His claims that he fears for his life 
and for his safety while he is inside the jail here is all a bunch of hogwash. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's following the same steps used by another jail escapee some time 
ago as a ploy to use emotion and make an attempt to get sympathy," Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 36, appeared in Pennington County Circuit Court in South Dakota on 
Thursday, where he told Judge Roland Grosshans that he would fight extradition 
to Orange County, where he faces trial in connection with six jewelry 
robberies, jail escape and kidnaping. He is being held in maximum security 
custody in lieu of $1.75-million bail. 
</P>
<P>
"He fears for his safety in California, but he would be willing to waive 
extradition to Illinois to face charges there," said Wayne Gilbert, Taylor's 
court-appointed attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor has a reputation as an intelligent and self-confident outlaw, according 
to law enforcement officials, but he will "not be allowed to manipulate" the 
legal system said Rod Oswald, Pennington County's chief deputy state's 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"He goes where we want him to go," Oswald said. "He doesn't tell the system 
where he wants to go." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Orange County, other jurisdictions also have expressed interest 
in extraditing Taylor, including Alameda County in Northern California, 
Illinois and Des Moines, Iowa, Oswald said. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor is suspected of robbing shoe stores in Des Moines and Denver, as well as 
jewelry stores in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., West Des Moines and River Grove, 
Ill., on his cross-country flight since he broke out of Orange County Jail 6 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Police in Albany, Calif., believe Taylor and another man posed as used-car 
buyers and kidnaped a woman Jan. 9, raped her and then tried to choke her with 
a rope. The woman escaped from the car near San Jose and identified Taylor as 
her assailant after he was the subject of an "America's Most Wanted " 
television show. 
</P>
<P>
In Rapid City, S.D., where he was caught last weekend, Taylor also faces a 
charge of being a felon in possession of stolen property, Oswald said. 
</P>
<P>
"We would be willing to step aside and let other jurisdictions (including) 
Orange County, Illinois and perhaps Des Moines extradite him for trials there," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Strongest Case 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Burl Estes said he is convinced that Orange 
County, where Taylor could face life imprisonment if found guilty of several 
felony charges, has the strongest case against him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my understanding that the fugitive complaint filed in South Dakota, which 
resulted in his apprehension and arraignment, was based on our (Orange County) 
charges. We want him back first," Estes said. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor faces charges in three cases in Orange County, including one that 
involves six jewelry store armed robberies, the jail escape and a third case 
involving kidnaping with intent to commit robbery the night he escaped from 
jail, Estes said. 
</P>
<P>
On the robbery case alone, Estes said, Taylor faces at least 60 years in prison 
because of his prior criminal record, alleged use of a gun and other charges. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that in this situation we have enough potential time stacked up 
against the guy, so that there is no reason to let another jurisdiction have 
him. We can, if we find him guilty, probably put him away for his natural 
life," Estes said. 
</P>
<P>
During extradition hearings, judges and prosecutors are influenced by the 
jurisdiction with the greatest case against the defendant and whether that 
jurisdiction is able to absorb costs involved in the trial, Oswald said. 
</P>
<P>
The judge in the extradition case has set a June 20 hearing in Rapid City. 
</P>
<P>
Estes, who is preparing Orange County's extradition request, said he may have 
the documents mailed to Sacramento next week for Governor Georbge Deukmejian's 
signature. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's office is expected to approve the request and mail the documents 
to the governor of South Dakota. If so, Estes said, authorities there will 
issue a governor's warrant ordering Taylor returned.

THIRD LAWYER APPOINTED TO PADUANO CASE; 
</P>
<P>
ATTORNEY QUITS DRUG-ROBBERY DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The case of reputed Newport Beach drug kingpin Robert G. (Fat Bobby) Paduano 
was dealt a setback Thursday when his lawyer abruptly declared a conflict of 
interest and removed himself, after several weeks of pretrial motions. 
</P>
<P>
Paduano, 45, is charged with 71 counts involving a series of robberies at homes 
of small drug dealers, or homes where prosecutors say Paduano suspected drug 
activity. Prosecutors theorize that Paduano was trying to expand his own drug 
empire in Newport Beach, but that he also tried to pressure the victims into 
paying him for protection. 
</P>
<P>
Paduano, who remains in Orange County Jail on $500,000 bail, and other members 
of his family have denied all the allegations. His sons and daughter have said 
in court that Paduano is simply an investment banker. 
</P>
<P>
His trial had been expected to begin in Westminster soon after the end of the 
defense's legal motions. But the departure of defense attorney John D. Barnett 
Thursday left the trial date in question. Barnett had taken over the case last 
September after a falling out between Paduano and his first attorney, Alan M. 
May of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher W. Evans. "But what can 
you do? You have to learn to live with frustrations in this job and just keep 
plugging along." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Patrick McNeal, appointed Thursday to replace Barnett, said he will 
have to spend probably 2 weeks just sorting through the list of people involved 
in the case to make sure that he also does not have a conflict. 
</P>
<P>
By law, Barnett was not allowed to disclose what his conflict was. Usually when 
lawyers declare conflicts of interest it is because they discover that they 
once represented a witness on the list. But it can be for a variety of other 
reasons, such as an inability to get along with the client. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Kathleen E. O'Leary in Superior Court, Santa Ana, ordered the lawyers to 
return June 9 to see where the case stands. 
</P>
<P>
"To be realistic, it's going to take me a while," McNeal said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Leary had heard 14 days of testimony when Barnett left the case Thursday. 
McNeal said he did not know yet whether he will ask O'Leary to start all over 
or whether he could save the court time by carrying on where Barnett left off. 
</P>
<P>
"Different lawyers do things different ways," McNeal said. "I've got a lot of 
reading to do on this case before I know just where we're going to go with it." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Evans said he did not blame McNeal for needing time to acquaint 
himself with the thousands of pages of grand jury, preliminary hearing, and 
pretrial motion transcripts. But when the case resumes June 9, Evans said, he 
will ask the court for a firm trial date. 
</P>
<P>
Paduano was arrested in February, 1988, after an extensive investigation by 
Newport Beach police and the district attorney's office. He also faces similar 
charges in Riverside County, including conspiracy to kidnap a Palm Springs man 
for ransom.

LINEUP CHANGE HELPS THE LANCERS DEFEAT LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Steve White, Sunny Hills High School tennis coach, looked at Laguna Beach's 
strength and decided the best thing was to avoid going head-to-head against its 
fine singles players. 
</P>
<P>
So he shuffled his lineup Thursday, making his good doubles teams even better. 
The result was a 10-8 victory for Sunny Hills in the semifinal round of the 
Southern Section 3-A playoffs at Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills (22-1) plays Woodbridge (19-4) for the 3-A championship Wednesday 
at a site to be determined today. It's the first title appearance for the 
Lancers since 1977, when they finished second to Corona del Mar in the 4-A. 
Laguna Beach ends its season 20-4. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers won seven of nine doubles sets to compensate for losing six of nine 
singles sets. The match easily could have gone the other way if not for the two 
tiebreakers won by the Lancers. 
</P>
<P>
For much of the match, a tie was a distinct possibility. Laguna Beach would 
have won on games, 88-76, thanks to its dominating singles play. 
</P>
<P>
But in the final round, Glenn Henderson delivered an upset victory over Graham 
Gilles, Laguna Beach's No. 2 player, 6-4, to clinch the match. 
</P>
<P>
The first tiebreaker helped Sunny Hills take a 4-2 lead after the first round 
of play. Andrew Duncan and Jason Klingsberg, the Lancers' No. 1 doubles team, 
took a 7-6 victory over Lee Kirner and Aaron Brauer, Laguna Beach's No. 1 team. 
Kirner and Brauer had four set points, but Duncan and Klingsberg battled back. 
</P>
<P>
The second tiebreaker victory in the second round put Sunny Hills ahead, 7-5. 
Hans Erkelens and Nathan Winn, the Lancers' No. 3 team, defeated Kirner and 
Brauer, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
Erkelens, a senior foreign exchange student from Holland, was the key figure in 
White's shuffling. He often has played at No. 2 singles but was moved to 
strengthen the doubles teams further. Other shuffling included moving Sameer 
Gavankar, who is often paired with Winn at No. 3 doubles, to No. 1 singles. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Henderson, the Lancers' best singles player, played at No. 3. Ryan 
Henderson, who normally plays No. 3, moved to No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Leach, Laguna Beach's No. 1 singles player, won 6-0, 6-0, 6-0, to improve 
his record to 57-0. Gilles won his two other sets, 6-0, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
"They played really well," Laguna Beach Coach Bob Walton said. "We knew they'd 
be tough in doubles, but (Glenn) Henderson played tough, too."

A YEAR LATER, KENNEDY'S HANSELL GETS ANOTHER SHOT AGAINST LAGUNA HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The play has haunted Kennedy High School pitcher Greg Hansell for a year. 
</P>
<P>
Hansell was facing perennial playoff participant Laguna Hills in the first 
inning of Kennedy's first playoff game in 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
A line drive hit Hansell's pitching hand and caromed to the left of the mound. 
Visibly stunned, Hansell still managed to pick up the ball, but he threw wildly 
past first baseman Pete Montera. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills eventually scored three unearned runs in the inning (a fourth run 
was earned) en route to an 8-5 victory in the first round of the Southern 
Section 3-A division playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Hansell (11-1) gets another opportunity when he starts against Laguna 
Hills at 3:15 in La Palma in the quarterfinals of the 3-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"All Greg had to do was underhand the ball to Pete, and we were out of the 
inning with Laguna Hills scoring only one run," said Chris Pascal, Kennedy's 
coach. "Instead, they got three more runs, and we never recovered." 
</P>
<P>
But Kennedy (22-5) recovered well enough this season to earn a rematch with 
fourth-seeded Laguna Hills (24-4), which finished as the top-ranked team in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's best showing in the playoffs has been keyed by quick starts. Kennedy 
scored two runs in the first inning in a 6-2 victory over Bonita, then 
duplicated the first-inning production in a 6-4 victory over Canyon Country 
Canyon on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that three of our key players (Hansell, Montera and Craig Roah) went 
through the football playoffs has been a steadying influence on the team," 
Pascal said. "But we're well aware that we're facing the best team in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills, which has five future Division I players in the lineup, has won 
21 of its past 22 games. Center fielder Chris Sheff, who has signed with 
Pepperdine, is the county's career hit leader with 129. 
</P>
<P>
First baseman Rob Milo, who has signed with Stanford, was voted the most 
valuable player in the Pacific Coast League after batting .489 and winning five 
games as a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
In other 3-A games: 
</P>
<P>
Saugus (21-4-2) at Estancia (21-6): Saugus starting pitcher Roger Salkeld, a 
6-foot-5, 210-pound right-hander, is rated among the top prep pitchers in the 
nation by most scouting services and figures to be a top draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
Salkeld (11-0) struck out 139 in 82 innings during the regular season and has a 
save and a victory in the playoffs. Outfielder Darren Davis has 28 stolen bases 
and shortstop Scott Warr has six home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Estancia advanced to the quarterfinals for the first time in 17 years under 
Coach Ken Millard by rallying for five runs with two outs in the seventh inning 
to gain a 9-7 victory over Corona Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Jason White, who jammed his wrist in a first-round game against 
Pacifica, is questionable. White had 19 stolen bases during the regular season. 
Second baseman Rob Nye's first homer of the season was the difference against 
Corona. 
</P>
<P>
In the 5-A division: 
</P>
<P>
Tustin (20-8) at Palmdale (14-10): Tustin Coach Vince Brown is anticipating an 
"intimidating situation" when his team travels to the upper desert. "Their 
players and their fans do their best to rattle opposing players," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin has its own intimidating tactic, "the barking dogs." The Tillers bark at 
opposing pitchers from the dugout in crucial situations. Starting pitcher Monte 
Jones, 11-2 with 130 strikeouts, also can be intimidating on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore right fielder Shawn Green had three hits in Tustin's 3-2 upset 
victory over top-seeded Artesia in the second round. Palmdale third baseman 
Jason Priske is batting .406 with six homers. 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado (20-8) at Mater Dei (22-5): Surprisingly, these perennial playoff 
teams have never met in the postseason. Tony Pena, who has won 22 games in the 
past two years, will oppose El Dorado's Pete Janicki. Pena has signed with 
Arizona State and Janicki is headed to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado has four players -- first baseman Matt Luke (California), shortstop 
Phil Nevin (CS Fullerton), catcher Bruce Petillo (University of Pacific) and 
Janicki (UCLA) -- who have signed with Division I schools. 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado was the top-ranked team in the county's preseason polls, but "never 
put it all together" during the season, according to Coach Steve Gullotti. "The 
pitching has been good all year long," Gullotti said. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Bob Ickes' son, Rob, has driven in five of the Monarchs' 12 runs with 
three doubles and leadoff hitter Greg Carl is five for seven in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
In the 4-A division: 
</P>
<P>
South Hills (18-7) at Mission Viejo (20-6): Mission Viejo has scored 23 runs in 
two playoff games while South Hills has allowed only one run in a wild-card 
game and two playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
Designated hitter Damon Hubbart is six for 11 in the last three games and has 
driven in six runs for Mission Viejo. Shortstop Eric Ekdahl is five for seven 
in the playoffs with three runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo is coming off an emotional 12-11 victory over Santa Ana in which 
the Diablos rallied four times in seven innings to erase leads and then nearly 
lost a 12-8 lead disappear in the last inning. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the most draining game I've ever been involved in," said Ron Drake, 
Mission Viejo's coach. "I felt like a piece of spaghetti when it was over."

DALEY LEAVES MAGNOLIA FOR FULLERTON COLLEGE JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Daley has resigned as baseball coach at Magnolia High School to become an 
assistant at Fullerton College, Magnolia Athletic Director Bob Rishel said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Magnolia was 16-31-1 during Daley's two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Daley was a four-year starter for Magnolia from 1980-83. He also played two 
years at Fullerton College. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for people right now," Rishel said. "Our biggest problem is that 
the job doesn't include a teaching position."

MISSION VIEJO'S FAGER WANTS TO SURPASS ANY BARRIERS STILL IN HER WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lisa Fager of Mission Viejo High School stands 90 feet away from her launch 
site, staring down a narrow tartan runway. 
</P>
<P>
In her mind's eye she sees her run-up step for step. She sees her perfect 
running form, hair blowing in the wind, as she picks up speed. 
</P>
<P>
She reaches her first mark and hops off her right foot, trying to propel her 
lean 5-foot-10 frame up and out, farther down the runway. She starts to head 
back to earth. She hits perfectly on her right heel for the skip, trying to 
keep her momentum going forward, always forward. 
</P>
<P>
Now she bounds to her left foot, something she has done again and again in 
practice. Finally, the sand pit, her target, is in sight. One last jump and she 
flings herself into the pit. 
</P>
<P>
In her mind's eye, she has triple jumped 40 feet. It's always the case. At 
least until she actually clears that elusive 40-foot barrier. 
</P>
<P>
Then it will be a new target. Maybe 40-6 or 41 feet. For now it's 40 feet. And 
it has been that way ever since Fager broke her last elusive goal with a jump 
of 39-11 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Fager, a junior, broke the Orange County girls' triple-jump record with that 
leap at the county girls' track and field championship in April. It was a mark 
that drove her -- sometimes to distraction -- ever since she jumped a personal 
best 39-4 at the same meet a year earlier. She went on to place seventh in the 
state meet. 
</P>
<P>
She just had to better the record of 39-8 1/4, set by Debbie Orr of Ocean View 
in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
She'll try to again qualify for the state meet, and break the 40-foot barrier 
in the process, at the Masters Meet at 6:30 tonight at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
Fager also will be high jumping tonight. She won the 4-A title last week at the 
Southern Section championship meet with a jump of 5-4. Fager also hopes to 
qualify in the high jump, but it's the triple jump that has her full attention. 
</P>
<P>
She tried a number of events when she first tried track and field as an eighth 
grader competing for a Mission Viejo-based age-group club called Time Machine. 
</P>
<P>
Fager played soccer and softball but neither held her interest. So she gave 
track and field a shot. 
</P>
<P>
She tried the long jump. Nah. 
</P>
<P>
High jump? Too nerve wracking. 
</P>
<P>
Sprints? Uh, not fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
Triple jump? She tried it and fell for it in a big way. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I did it I was doing it on the grass, getting my steps down," 
Fager said. "And I tripped and fell on my face." 
</P>
<P>
She got up, brushed herself off and mastered the event not long after. She went 
32-6 "or something like that" as an eighth grader and began to improve by leaps 
and bounds. 
</P>
<P>
As a freshman at Mission Viejo, she qualified for the state meet, but did not 
advance to the final. That showed her potential in the event, though. 
</P>
<P>
So she and John Hattrup, Mission Viejo's jumps coach, worked diligently on 
improving her speed and perfecting her technique during the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at who she's jumping against and if it was just a race, she'd get 
beat every time," Hattrup said. 
</P>
<P>
But that hard work -- including endless sessions of jumping over milk crates to 
improve her spring -- has helped compensate for her lack of blazing speed on 
the runway. 
</P>
<P>
Fager's best last week was 39-7 1/2, good for second place in the 4-A behind 
Hesperia's Krystal Kirkland, who jumped 39-11. Kirkland, and Walnut's Juliana 
Yendork, who has the best jump in the nation this year (41-9 1/2), will be 
Fager's toughest competition tonight. 
</P>
<P>
They aren't the only ones, however. 
</P>
<P>
"She's her toughest critic," Hattrup said. "Sometimes she doesn't understand 
that Bob Beamon (the world record holder in the long jump) didn't jump 29 feet 
everyday. Forty feet, that's all we hear about. If she doesn't jump 40 feet 
it's not a good jump." 
</P>
<P>
Masters Meet Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's meet begins at 6:30. The top five finishers in each event qualify for 
the state meet next Friday and Saturday at Cerritos College. Here's a look at 
some of the 44 Orange County athletes, not including relay team members, 
competing tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Boys: 
</P>
<P>
Sprints -- Tim Martin, a sophomore from San Clemente, ran 10.61 in the 100 
meters at the 4-A prelims, the third-fastest time ever by a county runner. 
Curtis Conway of Hawthorne, who won the 100 and 200 at the 4-A finals last 
week, is favored. 
</P>
<P>
Distances -- In the 800, Doug Nichols of Edison ran a personal best of 1:52.15 
last week, the second-fastest qualifying mark. In the 1,600, Eddie Lavelle and 
Greg Shryock of Corona del Mar, Mike Nielsen of Mater Dei and Neil Stevenson of 
Capistrano Valley will compete. In the 3,200, Nielsen and Jimmy Rodriguez of 
Santa Ana Valley will challenge Bryan Dameworth of Agoura and Mike Williamson 
of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Field events -- Phouphet Singbandith of Magnolia competes in the long and 
triple jumps. Charles Cummings and Vince Chuck of Kennedy and Tony Robinson of 
San Clemente also are entered in the triple jump. In the pole vault, Eric 
Whitcomb of Valencia is the county's top entrant. In the shotput, Esperanza's 
Chuck Underwood won the 3-A title and has the third longest put among the 
qualifiers (56-9 1/4). 
</P>
<P>
Girls: 
</P>
<P>
Sprints -- In the 400, Shelly Tochluk of Westminster and Don'yelle Norris, a 
freshman at Mission Viejo, qualified. 
</P>
<P>
Distances -- Shelley Taylor, a freshman at Edison, won the 4-A 800 and 1,600 
last week. She won the 800 in 2:15.33 and the 1,600 in 5:05.10. Kim Toney of 
Atascadero has the fastest time going into the 800 (2:12.65). Karen Hecox of 
South Hills is fastest in the 1,600 (4:53.90). 
</P>
<P>
Field events -- In the high jump, Lori Svoboda of El Dorado went 5-10 to win 
the 3-A title last week and will be the favorite tonight. Beth Byron of Villa 
Park was second to Svoboda with a 5-5 jump. Lisa Fager of Mission Viejo won the 
4-A in 5-4. Elizabeth Bauer of Foothill also cleared 5-4. In the long jump, 
Allison Franke of Canyon, Brenda Robinson of Santa Ana Valley, Allison Axtell 
of Mission Viejo and Melissa McDonald of Mater Dei are entered. In the shotput, 
Leslee Briggs of Edison, Bev Oden of Irvine and Kristen Dunn of Mission Viejo 
are entered.

KARCHER EXECUTIVE SOUGHT OK FOR STOCK SALE, JURY TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN GALANTE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alvin DeShano, the Carl Karcher Enterprises accountant accused of illegal 
insider trading, discussed selling his Karcher stock before he had any 
knowledge of an impending dramatic drop in the company's profits, Karcher's 
treasurer testified Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Elaine Falbe, vice president and treasurer of the Anaheim fast-food chain, told 
a federal jury in Los Angeles that DeShano asked controller George Clower in 
late September or early October of 1984 whether he could sell the shares. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors contend that DeShano sold all of his Karcher stock on 
Monday, Oct. 15, 1984, after receiving a preliminary, internal report on the 
previous Friday showing that the company's earnings for the 4-week period that 
ended Oct. 5 would be as much as $900,000 below projections. 
</P>
<P>
Falbe was called as a witness on the first day of the defense portion of the 
3-day-old trial for DeShano, who is accused of avoiding $7,107 in losses by 
selling shares based on information that had not been made public. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, Karcher executive Steve Kishi told jurors that he had advised 
DeShano earlier in 1984 to diversify and not invest only in company stock. 
</P>
<P>
According to Kishi, director of international development, DeShano asked him in 
the summer or fall of 1984 about selling his stock. "I told him our stock has 
tremendous fluctuation and that keeping everything in one stock was probably 
not a good investment. . . . I told Al the very prudent thing would be to 
diversity . . . take the profits and put them in another investment like a 
money market (account)," Kishi said. 
</P>
<P>
The two Karcher executives' testimony is intended to help convince jurors that 
DeShano believed that he was doing nothing wrong by selling his stock. 
</P>
<P>
But before the two testified Thursday, defense lawyers were handed two setbacks 
by U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima. 
</P>
<P>
First, the judge denied defense attorney David Wiechert's motion to acquit 
DeShano before the conclusion of the case. "I agree there may not be direct 
evidence of intent, but there certainly is circumstantial evidence," the judge 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Then -- in a ruling that visibly shocked and angered Wiechert -- Judge Tashima 
decided to bar a major portion of the defense's proposed testimony about 
whether DeShano used material information to make his sales. 
</P>
<P>
In her testimony Thursday, Falbe said that DeShano, in his discussion with 
Clower, "basically said, 'Hey, Boss, I'm thinking of selling some stock. Is 
that OK?' There was some discussion . . . (and) Clower's basic response was 
'Yes,' it was OK for Al to sell his stock." 
</P>
<P>
In the trial, the government must prove that DeShano had criminal intent and 
used material, non-public information to avoid a stock market loss. Federal law 
prohibits any stock trading based on such inside knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
The criminal case stems from a civil suit filed last year by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission in which Carl N. Karcher, along with 15 members of his 
family and DeShano, were accused of avoiding stock losses of at least $310,000 
in 1984 by selling securities before the earnings decline was made public. 
</P>
<P>
The civil case is pending against Karcher as well as six of his relatives and 
DeShano. DeShano is the only one who has been criminally charged. 
</P>
<P>
Clower, who testified earlier in the trial, has said that he does not remember 
the conversation with DeShano, according to documents filed in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Clower -- DeShano's immediate supervisor -- acknowledged that he sold blocks of 
his own Karcher stock on five occasions in the fall of 1984. Clower made his 
sales as late as Oct. 11 -- the day before Karcher executives received the 
internal report showing the dramatic plunge in earnings.

Quiksilver Inc., a Newport Beach beachwear company, reported a 51% increase in 
net income for its second quarter ended April 30, to $2.7 million from $1.8 
million for the like period last year. Sales rose 39%, to $23 million from 
$16.5 million. Net income for the first half of fiscal 1989 increased 62%, to 
$3.5 million from $2.2 million for the comparable period a year ago. Sales 
totaled $35.5 million, a 45% increase from the $24.5 million posted for the 6 
months last year. The company said Quiksilver's record first-half performance 
was a result of strong demand for its product line.

Ford Aerospace Corp.'s newest commercial satellite, the Superbird, is scheduled 
to be placed into orbit for the first time today when two of them, configured 
as communications satellites, will be carried aloft aboard a European Ariane 4A 
rocket launched from French Guiana. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Pearce, spokeswoman for Newport Beach-based Ford Aerospace, said the 
satellites will be used by their Japanese owner for video distribution, 
satellite news gathering, private business networks and, in the future, 
possibly for high-definition television. 
</P>
<P>
The satellites were built at a Ford Aerospace plant in Palo Alto for Space 
Communications Corp., a private Japanese satellite firm, at a cost of about 
$200 million, Pearce said. 
</P>
<P>
The two satellites will be placed in a stationary orbit 22,300 miles above the 
Earth. DAVID OLMOS

SEGERSTROM FIRM LAYS OFF WORKERS, BLAMES LOSS AT POLLS 
</P>

<P>
The development firm of C.J. Segerstrom &amp; Sons has laid off about 10 
employees, blaming voters' rejection last year of a proposal to build a big 
office complex in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
That project, called the Home Ranch, was approved by the Costa Mesa City 
Council but was overwhelmingly rejected by voters in a November referendum. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement issued Thursday, Segerstrom said that because of 
"severe restrictions on its development activities resulting from the elections 
last November, (the company) had instituted an approximate 15% reduction" in 
its work force. 
</P>
<P>
The company declined to discuss the layoffs or the number of people it employs. 
But sources familiar with the company said that eight to 10 employees were 
recently notified that they would be laid off. 
</P>
<P>
Segerstrom said in the statement that only employees at its South Coast Plaza 
shopping center were "not affected by the reduction." 
</P>
<P>
The $300-million Home Ranch project -- already reduced in size once by 
Segerstrom -- would have included two big office towers near Harbor Boulevard 
and the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa residents anxious about the traffic the big project would generate 
put two referendums on the ballot last year, one blocking the older, larger 
Home Ranch plan and one blocking the smaller compromise plan Segerstrom put 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
Segerstrom sued to keep both measures off the ballot but was denied by an 
Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Voters then overwhelmingly rejected the project, despite Segerstrom's reported 
spending of nearly $200,000 in an effort to win at the ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
The project appears to be dead until Segerstrom comes forward with a new plan. 
The company has not yet made a new proposal, according to the Costa Mesa 
Planning Department. 
</P>
<P>
The company, a big landholder in Costa Mesa, owns and operates South Coast 
Plaza as well as office buildings and a hotel near the mall.

<P>
The Fluor Daniel unit of Fluor Corp. in Irvine said it has been awarded an 
$84-million contract to assist in construction of a 90-megawatt power plant at 
one of Boise Cascade Corp.'s pulp and paper mills in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The contract, issued by a unit of the Intercity Gas Corp. of Winnipeg, Canada, 
calls for Fluor Daniel to provide engineering, procurement and construction 
management services for the project, which is expected to be completed late 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
At its peak, the contract will provide jobs for about 175 workers in the 
Canadian province of Ontario, a Fluor spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Fluor Daniel said that Conoco Inc. has renewed a $6-million annual 
contract for plant maintenance and capital improvement work at the 
Houston-based oil company's Denver refinery. JOHN O'DELL

NEW VENTURE FOR COMPANY;

<P>
KOLL TO START DEVELOPING, BUYING SHOPPING CENTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Koll Co., a large Newport Beach developer, said Thursday it will soon begin 
developing and buying shopping centers for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Koll has developed only offices, factories and warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
David Mudgett, who had headed the Irvine Co.'s shopping center business, was 
named to run Koll's new venture. 
</P>
<P>
Mudgett, now a corporate senior vice president at Koll, won't be heading a 
large staff. Koll said it will use its existing personnel to start the retail 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Koll said it will start small by developing small complexes of stores around 
its office and industrial projects. 
</P>
<P>
"Retail is becoming an important element in the mixed-use commercial complexes, 
business parks and industrial parks we are developing throughout the western 
United States," J. Harold Street, president of the company's Development 
Services Group, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
"Until now, we have been selling or leasing the retail components of the sites 
to retail developers -- but now we will develop the retail ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
The company will also look for land on which to develop neighborhood and 
community shopping centers, and said it eventually plans to develop larger 
retailing centers such as malls. 
</P>
<P>
Koll, with a real estate portfolio of $4 billion, is one of the nation's 
largest developers. Although it operates mostly in the West, it is also opening 
a Texas office.

THE BEACH BOYS' NEW SPLASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Beach Boys are riding their biggest wave in two decades. They're coming off 
their first No. 1 single in 22 years ("Kokomo"), "genius" Brian Wilson is back 
in the fold, they've re-turned to Capitol Records and are on the road with 
Chicago for a hot-ticket summer tour. 
</P>
<P>
You'd think these purveyors of good vibrations and endless summer fun, fun, fun 
would be coasting along quite comfortably. But the mood at a Culver City sound 
stage during the band's final rehearsal for the Chicago tour was anything but 
light. 
</P>
<P>
The tension seemed to mirror the band's determination to take advantage of the 
current resurgence and re-establish itself as a contemporary hit-maker -- or be 
doomed to a life as nostalgia merchants. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Wilson, who had spent much of the night before working on new songs in a 
recording studio, declined to be interviewed. And Wilson, Bruce Johnston, Mike 
Love and Al Jardine seemed pretty businesslike as they worked out choreography 
steps to "Barbara Ann" with the six bikinied surfer girls who are decorating 
the stage on this tour (which includes shows Saturday at the Pacific 
Amphitheatre and Sunday at the Hollywood Bowl). 
</P>
<P>
Explained Johnston, who joined the Beach Boys in 1965 after Brian Wilson gave 
up full-time touring: "I don't want the Beach Boys to be the futile endless 
road show of 'The King and I' or 'I Love Lucy' reruns. I live, eat and breathe 
getting on the radio. I just think, 'How can we get back on the radio?' " 
</P>
<P>
Johnston didn't pause before answering himself: "With great songs, that's how!" 
</P>
<P>
An odd question, coming not long after the band's "Kokomo," a song from the 
"Cocktail" movie score, became the Beach Boys first No. 1 single since 1966's 
"Good Vibrations." 
</P>
<P>
And that was only one highlight from what was the group's best year in eons. It 
began with its induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, built through the 
attention focused on the solo album debut of Brian Wilson -- the architect of 
the Beach Boys' often-imitated sound -- and crested with "Kokomo." 
</P>
<P>
The new Capitol release will be the band's first album in four years. Titled 
"Still Cruisin' " and due this summer, the record will be a combination of 
movie-related tracks including "Kokomo" and "Wipe Out" (a pairing with the 
rapping Fat Boys) and several new songs. After that, the contract contains an 
option for an album of all new material. Johnston calls it "the album of doom." 
</P>
<P>
"Just because you've had a No. 1 doesn't mean you're automatic," Johnston said 
during a rehearsal break, acknowledging that the Beach Boys could go on forever 
recreating the endless summer with its stockpile of old hits. But that isn't 
good enough for him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's records that matter," he said. "There's no point in touring without new 
records. It's just huge payments to me. We've got to be better than that." 
</P>
<P>
David Berman, president of Capitol Records, was pleased to hear that the Beach 
Boys are going into their new arrangement with the label with that attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a pivotal point in their career," he said. "I hesitate to say 
with them that it's ever make or break. As a touring entity so continually 
successful, I wouldn't say that if this record doesn't happen it's the end of 
them as a recording entity. They're too good and represent too much so that 
they won't ever be dated. But on the other hand, I'm glad they feel that way 
because it bodes well for the record." 
</P>
<P>
It's clear to the Beach Boys what Capitol expects from them. 
</P>
<P>
"Three hit singles, to tell you the truth," Jardine said. "That's what they 
told us." 
</P>
<P>
"That's fair," Berman said. "That's what I would hope for." 
</P>
<P>
But even one hit, coming on the heels of "Kokomo," would pay double dividends 
for Capitol, which still owns the Beach Boys' '60s catalogue, some of which is 
now on CD, with the much-anticipated and much-delayed CD release of the hailed 
"Pet Sounds" 1966 album still to come. 
</P>
<P>
Said Berman: "We do anticipate that a new hit Beach Boys record will help us 
exploit the catalogue, including but not limited to a 'Pet Sounds' CD." 
</P>
<P>
Much is being made of Brian Wilson's role with the group. He will play only 
selected dates on this tour, including the Southland shows, with a four-song 
solo set included. But he will be working throughout the summer in the studio 
creating new songs for the band, which is essentially the role he has played 
for the past 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going back to the original formula," said Dr. Eugene Landy, Brian's 
controversial therapist, guide and co-writer who hovered around while Brian was 
being interviewed. "Brian is most valuable to the Beach Boys using his time in 
the studio." 
</P>
<P>
Still, many are perceiving this as a return to the fold for Brian, given his 
solo activities and the fact that he was not involved with "Kokomo." That 
impression was heightened last year when Love said in interviews that 
"Kokomo's" commercial superiority over Brian's solo album might prove to Brian 
that he needed the Beach Boys. 
</P>
<P>
And Brian himself spoke of being accepted back into the Beach Boys. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy about it," he said. "And Mike seems to be happy for me being in 
the Beach Boys." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Brian's presence is paramount to Capitol. "Brian's involvement on 
this record is extremely important," Berman said. "But the fact that Mike Love 
and (producer) Terry Melcher came up with 'Kokomo' on their own without Brian 
means you've got a tremendous amount of talent there. I'm confident we can have 
quality material from all the Beach Boys."

AN ENIGMATIC 'EVENING WITH BOULEZ AND ZAPPA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The world will little note nor long remember what was said during "An Evening 
With Pierre Boulez and Frank Zappa" at UCLA. Should it care, the affair -- part 
of the ongoing Festival Boulez -- was videotaped. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's think of this as an aleatoric entertainment event," Zappa urged the 
capacity crowd in Schoenberg Hall Auditorium at one point Tuesday. On those 
terms, as a muted triumph of personality over content, the evening was not 
without simple -- and simplistic -- charms. 
</P>
<P>
Revelations in the dialogue, moderated by David Raksin, were few. The 
conversation ranged from Boulez's earnest description of how he tunes 
individual chords in Webern's orchestral music to Zappa's equally serious 
explanation of where he found his theory that AIDS is the result of a CIA 
conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
Boulez in particular proved unexpectedly reticent. Asked for his feelings about 
the work of some contemporaries such as Schnittke, Lutoslawski and Gubaidulina, 
Boulez said: "I prefer to keep my opinions to myself." Asked what he attempts 
to bring to listeners in a performance, he responded: "I cannot tell you. I 
don't know what it is that I convey." 
</P>
<P>
He did confide his impression of minimalism: "If I may be nasty, I think it is 
minimal." Zappa, for his part, claimed never to have heard a piece by Philip 
Glass, or indeed, to listen to anything recreationally except a Boulez 
recording of Webern. 
</P>
<P>
Zappa's comments covered mostly familiar ground, from his dissatisfaction with 
the Music Business and his low regard for rock journalism -- "Compared to 
Rolling Stone, there's a wealth of information (in Hustler)" -- to the futility 
of composing in the United States today and his frustrations with performance 
standards -- The most important goal in his life? "I'm still waiting for an 
accurate performance." 
</P>
<P>
Regarding future projects, Zappa discussed the "world orchestra" of ethnic and 
electronic instruments which he has proposed to the authorities planning the 
1992 world's fair in Seville, saying he will be leaving for Spain soon to 
discuss an offer to finance the project. 
</P>
<P>
Boulez said his most important project was a series of concerts of music by 
young composers, to be given in Paris in the fall. His name has come up as a 
possible candidate for some of the currently vacant music director positions, 
but in a press-only tune-up before the evening's program officially began, he 
reiterated his disinclination for such work: "I don't want to be in charge of 
an orchestra anymore. I want to concentrate on composition and research." 
</P>
<P>
The liveliest confrontations of the evening came not between the two erstwhile 
iconoclasts, but between Raksin and the audience. Ushers collected written 
questions from the audience, which Raksin read to Zappa and Boulez, with much 
derisive commentary on the intelligence and relevance of the questions. 
</P>
<P>
That produced heckling from the audience, including the suggestion that their 
questions compared favorably to those of Raksin, who saw fit to ask Zappa and 
Boulez for their comments on the songs of Irving Berlin and Jerome Kern. There 
were also frequent shouted demands from the audience for more sound 
amplification. 
</P>
<P>
One suspects that John Cage -- who was the butt of considerable affectionately 
contemptuous kidding -- would have reveled in the contradictory, 
theater-of-the-absurd evening.

SHOSTAKOVICH MOVIE STRIKES SOUR NOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT DUNCAN, Baltimore Evening Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is hard to dismiss Tony Palmer's "Testimony," a high-concept film based on 
the memoirs of composer Dmitri Shostakovich, which airs tonight on PBS. 
</P>
<P>
But if you don't zap it midway in a fit of pique (and many Shosty admirers will 
do so, pronto, screaming "intellectual tripe!"), you must shed any hope of a 
glimpse into the inner workings of the Soviet composer who died in 1975 as 
perhaps the 20th Century's greatest symphonist and one of its most troubling 
enigmas. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer's "Testimony" is tenuously based on Shostakovich's memoirs, purportedly 
"narrated to Solomon Volkov" and published in 1980. Volkov's publication of the 
composer's rambling recollections caused a storm, partly over the authenticity 
of the statements and partly because Volkov was seen as an apologist for a 
composer who more than once cooperated with Soviet officials during Stalin's 
reign of terror. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer, who co-wrote, produced and directed "Testimony," is true to the memoirs 
only in its fervid development of the theme of Shostakovich's tangled 
relationship with the Soviet political machinery and its ruthless chief 
manipulator, Josef Stalin. Stalin's shadow crossed everything in Soviet life, 
including the arts. As the memoirs show, Shostakovich carried the scars long 
after Stalin's death in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
Shostakovich was a victim, a portrait of an artist who was not a hero. He was 
too frail to fight, never a Solzhenitsyn, and not strong enough to abandon his 
country, like an Igor Stravinsky, who later denounced him. 
</P>
<P>
Shostakovich closed his eyes and stayed in the Soviet Union while Stalin's 
monstrosities swirled around him, producing an output that included 15 
symphonies and an equal number of string quartets, two operas and six 
concertos. 
</P>
<P>
His music has a permanent place, yet Shostakovich's complicity has left his 
persona, at least in the world music community, in a kind of limbo. One hungers 
to know the man, what made him do the duplicitous things he did, but Palmer 
would argue that there is little sense in knowing the man outside his political 
context. And so for 2 1/2 hours, "Testimony" plays out Shostakovich's struggle 
with Stalin on an abstract psychological landscape, like one long Eisenstein 
propaganda film with a sound track by Shostakovich. 
</P>
<P>
Shot in grainy black and white, Palmer's "Testimony" has the dank atmosphere of 
Orwell's "1984" and the dense, bureaucratic texture of Terry Gilliam's 
"Brazil." It is intercut with documentary film footage and filled with garish 
angles, shadows, hand-held camera effects and a busy sound track. 
</P>
<P>
As he loosely visits a chronology of Shostakovich's life, Palmer dashes notions 
of time and reality and feels no need to be entirely comprehensible to the 
viewer. Palmer's intent is a kind of ecstatic collage, a visual bombardment of 
fast-edited images. 
</P>
<P>
"Testimony," which begins at Shostakovich's funeral, seems very much like the 
hallucinations of a dying man, a life passing before one's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Kingsley, of "Gandhi" and "Betrayal" fame, plays Shostakovich with a kind 
of earnest intensity that unfortunately cannot seem to make it out from under 
Palmer's visual pyrotechnics.

CROWDS WARM TO CARRIE SNOW'S LOW-KEY DELIVERY, FOLKSY WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUNCAN STRAUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Comedian Carrie Snow is like your favorite veteran waitress at the local coffee 
shop: sufficiently wise, sassy and engaging so that even when she's not 
uproariously funny, you still get a kick out of listening to her. 
</P>
<P>
Snow is low-key and conversational. And because she's been doing stand-up for 
many years, nearly all vestiges of performance have been removed, leaving her 
remarkably comfortable and natural. That makes the patter of her shows -- like 
the one Wednesday at the Irvine Improvisation -- akin to the things Madge would 
say while offering to warm up your coffee, hon. 
</P>
<P>
It's pretty close to an ideal synthesis of persona, delivery and material, 
because while many of her topics are wholly contemporary, much of her chatty 
style is a throwback to the approach of earlier female comics: 
self-deprecating, especially about her weight and her troubled dating life. 
</P>
<P>
But because she projects that warm, casual personality, her act never descends 
into the annoying, whiny, self-pitying tone so common to that approach. 
</P>
<P>
Her greeting a moment into Wednesday's show ("My name is Carrie Snow. Please 
don't hate me because I'm beautiful; hate me because I'm dating your son") 
essentially served as some kind of thesis statement for what she would discuss 
over the next 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
It was smart alecky, ironic and hinted at her interest in young men ("As far as 
I'm concerned, a kid on a rubber raft is a sailor"), a jumping off point that's 
as central to her act as the jokes about her weight. 
</P>
<P>
Not long after, she introduced another major theme -- that she's a compulsive 
shopper: "I'm an incredible shopper. . . . I like to walk into really big 
department stores, take out my charge cards and say, 'Let the games begin.' " 
</P>
<P>
The rest of her show was devoted to developing those themes, although there 
were brief side trips into such other areas as politics and getting braces. 
</P>
<P>
During one of the sections about dating she alluded to "chubby chasers," which 
she defined as "guys who try to ply big women with food because -- it works." 
She doesn't really oppose the technique "because they don't have to worry about 
what's going to happen if I let myself go." 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, she allowed that she hopes to marry soon ("I've got about 
4 minutes left to breed"), while analyzing one of the universal stumbling 
blocks, namely that men find it difficult to commit: "They're afraid they're 
going to get married and then meet the woman of their dreams right at the 
reception." 
</P>
<P>
This drew a big laugh, and some applause, at which point she tagged the bit 
with: "I hate you guys for laughing at that." That's another of Snow's 
strengths; she frequently utters asides, off-center references and throwaway 
lines that are at least added bonuses, and sometimes funnier than the main 
thing she was talking about. 
</P>
<P>
For example, she made a slightly obscure reference at one point, which she felt 
a woman in the front row didn't understand. She approached the woman and said: 
"You're so sweet. . . . You looked at me with your head to the side, like the 
RCA dog. If you look at me like that again, I'll just explain stuff. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The woman seemed to enjoy the exchange and the audience definitely did. In the 
same way, because Snow is so non-threatening and likable, the crowd happily 
accompanied her when she periodically traipsed into rough or bawdy territory. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the winning impact of her spontaneous moments, truth be told, most of 
her material isn't great. A too-sizable chunk of her act these days addresses 
condoms and various aspects of menstrual periods, which are pretty standard 
stand-up topics -- although getting a woman's point of view puts a slightly 
different spin on them. 
</P>
<P>
But there are enough other pluses that Snow brings to the stage that, 
collectively, make her act work pretty well. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that wonderfully self-mocking, endearing personality, there's the 
inflection and rhythm of her delivery, part Valley girl (in the enthusiastic 
expression), part Snagglepuss (in the way she holds certain words and 
syllables, especially at the end of sentences). 
</P>
<P>
She also works in some neat phrases, even if the piece itself is so-so. During 
one about talking on the phone with one of her young boyfriends, she mentioned 
that "My parents beeped in on Call Rudeness." 
</P>
<P>
At this point in her career, you're obviously not going to get Carrie Snow to 
wait on you at a restaurant, but by her own admission, you're likely to see her 
at one. And there's no question that it would be great fun to have coffee with 
her and talk -- or, more likely, listen. 
</P>
<P>
Headlining an all-clever-comic bill that also includes Gerry Swallow and Matt 
Weinhold, Snow continues through Sunday at the Improv. 
</P>
<P>
 The Improv is at 4255 Campus Drive, Irvine. Showtimes: 8:30 and 10:30 p.m. 
Friday, 8 and 10:30 p.m. Saturday and 8:30 Sunday. Tickets: $7 to $10.

WYETH WATERCOLORS FROM WALLIS ESTATE SELL FOR $450,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three Andrew Wyeth watercolors that figure in a court battle between the Los 
Angeles County Museum of Art and a foundation set up by the late film producer 
Hal B. Wallis were sold at auction Thursday for $450,000. 
</P>
<P>
The sale at Christie's in New York occurred after attorneys for the museum and 
the foundation agreed to include proceeds from the three Wyeth works in an 
escrow account containing the $39.6 million brought by the May 10 sale of eight 
Impressionist paintings from the Wallis collection. 
</P>
<P>
The escrow agreement extends until June 6, the date of a previously scheduled 
hearing in state court in Manhattan at which a judge will hear arguments on a 
permanent injunction blocking transfer of sale proceeds to the Wallis 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement stipulates that the museum will not attempt to block transfer of 
title to the paintings to the people who purchased them. The museum previously 
had said it would not interfere with delivery of the Impressionist works to 
their new owners. The litigation involves a dispute between the foundation, 
based in Toluca Lake, and the museum that art experts say is unique. 
</P>
<P>
In the lawsuit filed last week, the museum accused the foundation of keeping 
secret a letter of instruction signed by Wallis in which the film producer 
instructed the foundation to make the artworks available to the museum on 
"permanent loan" and to remove them only for display at another public museum. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the foundation took the paintings back in preparation for 
their sale, contending the escalating art market necessitated the step to 
provide funds for charitable grants the foundation planned to make. 
</P>
<P>
The Wyeth paintings sold Thursday include "Head Gate," which went at Christie's 
for $120,000, "Sundown," which brought $165,000, and "The Grist Mill," which 
sold for $165,000. Unlike the Impressionist works by such masters as Claude 
Monet, Edgar Degas and Camille Pissarro that were sold earlier this month, the 
Wyeths represent work in which the Los Angeles County museum's collection is 
comparatively rich. 
</P>
<P>
Museum director Earl A. Powell noted that while the Wyeths are high quality 
paintings, the museum's permanent collection contains an ample supply of 
similar paintings while the Impressionist works are unique and considered 
irreplaceable. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Gold, the New York attorney representing the foundation, said the Wallis 
group agreed to the extended escrow as an expedient after the museum threatened 
Wednesday night to seek a court order blocking the sale. The escrow, signed by 
Gold and Martin Glenn, the museum's New York lawyer, contained the 
characterization by the foundation that the museum's contentions are 
"frivolous."

ANN CONWAY: JORGENSEN'S PALS WANT A LIVELY FAREWELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Her pal Dorothy Lamour is invited. And so are friends Sybil Brand, Martha Raye, 
Kathryn Grayson, Gretchen Wyler and Rusty Warren. So is her attorney, Donald 
Segretti. And so is John Hansen of Fullerton, the man who played her on the 
silver screen. 
</P>
<P>
About 270 of the late Christine Jorgensen's faithful are expected to assemble 
at a secret south county locale June 11 to bid her farewell. Jorgensen, who 
arched a zillion eyebrows when she was surgically changed from male to female 
in 1952, died of cancer in San Clemente on May 3. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen, who is going to the gathering with his wife, Sue, says he wants to 
attend because Jorgensen "was a definite part of my life." 
</P>
<P>
"She knew I was uncomfortable in the role," says Hansen, 37, who starred in 
"The Christine Jorgensen Story" when he was 18. "And she was extremely kind. 
Incredibly brave. She never left my side. I was extremely grateful." The movie 
did poorly in the United States, says Hansen, now a real estate developer, but 
it did big box office in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
There will be no crepe-hanging at this bon voyage party. No brave flowers. No 
torch songs. Not one tear, if Jorgensen's friend Dame Brenda Smith has her way. 
"Christine didn't want anybody weeping and moaning," says the English-born 
Smith. "She enjoyed her life and wants her friends to enjoy theirs." Skoal! 
</P>
<P>
A trend begins?: Videotape invitations are being used to lure celebs and 
corporate types to the Coca Cola/Ritz-Carlton Classic beginning June 9. And 
they're working. So far, Robert Wagner, Jill St. John, Paul Anka, Cheryl Ladd, 
Frankie Avalon, Elliot Gould and Telly Savalas have said oui to the private 
weekend that will benefit the Ronald McDonald Camp Good Times program. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie, oy: The zany author of the autobiographical "Jackie, Oy" opened his own 
theater-district bistro, called Jackie Mason's (what else?), in Manhattan last 
month with the likes of Malcolm Forbes, Donald Trump, Claire Trevor and Mikhail 
Baryshnikov sampling its continental fare. And on June 12, the man himself will 
be noshing with prominent locals on the kind of food they order (if they're 
lucky) before sweeping into the Orange County Performing Arts Center. For 
$1,000 each, supporters of the Jewish Senior Center of Orange County get to 
converge at the Center Club and dine on, among other items too continental to 
mention, Dover sole with truffle mousse and breast of pheasant with sun-dried 
cherries. The piece de resistance? Chocolate pyramid cake embellished with 
candy masks of tragedy and comedy (but of course). Tickets for Mason's 
one-night-only sidesplitter are on sale to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Let them eat cake -- and pate and crepes and . . . : Nothing like a little 
junket to get a party going. Elizabeth Carr Tierney, chairwoman of the Newport 
Harbor Art Museum blast that will commemorate the bicentennial of the French 
Revolution on July 14, did some research for the celebration during a recent 
trip to Paris. "In fact, I did a lot of research," said Tierney, a resident of 
Santa Ana Heights, "peeking in department stores to see what kind of displays 
and souvenirs they had." Tierney had hoped to bring some home to help decorate 
the party site -- Le Meridien Hotel in Newport Beach. But what she found was 
mostly "red, white and blue ticky tack" -- such as men's briefs decorated with 
guillotines. 
</P>
<P>
So she asked Parisians what they do to celebrate Bastille Day. "They told me it 
depends on which class you're in. And I thought, 'Things haven't changed much 
since the revolution!' " Members of the working class dance in the streets and 
enjoy fireworks and picnics in the park with their families, Tierney was told, 
while members of the upper class dine formally behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
For Tierney's crowd -- 1,400 can be accommodated -- there'll be jugglers, 
bands, caricaturists, accordionists, violinists -- and food, glorious food, all 
over the place, for everyone. Now that's class. 
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead: It was a quote from Fluor Corp.'s David Tappan that did the 
trick. In a December article in The Times about the Newport Harbor Art Museum, 
Tappan said: "When the museum is dedicated 3 years from now, it will join South 
Coast Repertory and the Performing Arts Center as the third leg of a cultural 
triangle for Orange County." Community activist Ginny Smallwood read that and 
wondered: Why doesn't the museum have support groups similar to those that 
raise funds for the two theaters? The result: Visionaries, a support group that 
will, it is hoped, number 500 women who will pay initiation fees of $1,000 and 
annual dues of $500. The goal: to hand the museum a check for $500,000 when it 
opens. The idea was introduced to a roomful of Orange County community 
activists during a luncheon Thursday at the Four Seasons Hotel. Among those on 
the Visionaries board are Smallwood, Judy Hemley, Mary Lou Hornsby, Jeanne 
Tappan, Maria Crutcher, Judie Argyros, Marilyn Nielsen and Nora Hester. 
</P>
<P>
On the town: Dr. Jonas Salk and his wife, Francoise Gilot (she was once married 
to Pablo Picasso), visited Santa Ana on Saturday night and enjoyed dinner with 
Salk's son, Peter, and his wife, Ellen Schreibman Salk. The Salks visited 
Gustaf Anders restaurant, where Ellen's oil paintings are on exhibit.

SANTA ANA RIVER TRAIL TAKES BICYCLISTS FROM THE CANYONS TO THE COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ed Campagna is ready to roll. 
</P>
<P>
He wears a pair of pricey bicycling eyeshades to protect his eyes from insects, 
road debris and glare. He has a helmet and padded gloves in case of a fall. 
Mounted on his handlebars is a small computer that will tell him how far and 
how fast he is traveling on this Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the extra batteries taped to the beefy steel frame of his 
Schwinn cruiser. "That's because I listen to the radio while I ride," says 
Campagna, 44, a Yorba Linda doctor. "Usually KOST, something real relaxing." 
</P>
<P>
With that, Campagna pushes off for his 20-mile spin from Yorba Linda to Anaheim 
Stadium and back, along a path that is the backbone of Orange County's 
impressive network of bicycle routes: the Santa Ana River Trail. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty good here. . . . You can really get those endorphines going," says 
Campagna, whose ride is a weekly ritual. "The only thing that's bad is when the 
wind's blowing -- when the Santa Anas blow, it's murder." 
</P>
<P>
But today, only the slightest breeze blows inland along the trail. For Campagna 
and the hundreds of other cyclists on the trail, it's a perfect day for a ride. 
</P>
<P>
Stretching 22 miles from the hills and canyons of Yorba Linda to the 
sun-splashed sands of Huntington Beach, the river trail is the county's longest 
cycling route uninterrupted by traffic lights and speeding trucks and cars. 
</P>
<P>
With spring bringing warmer temperatures and longer evenings, the ever-popular 
river trail turns into a mecca for cyclists, with about 50,000 people pedaling 
along the flat, 10-foot-wide strip of pavement each month, according to county 
transportation planners. 
</P>
<P>
Every kind of cyclist can be found on the trail: racers spinning along on 
luscious Italian frames at 30 m.p.h., powerful tandems, doughy couch potatoes 
on clunkers, parents pulling kids in trailers. Some ride just a few miles; 
others ride all 22 miles -- and back. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the equestrians riding on parallel dirt trails and the folks 
taking poodles and schnauzers out for a walk along the river. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, bicyclists see a representative cross section of the county. The 
trail meanders through or alongside the county's largest and oldest cities, 
Anaheim and Santa Ana, plus parts of Yorba Linda, Orange, Costa Mesa and 
Fountain Valley before ending in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
It winds past two golf courses, a baseball stadium, a jail and several parks. 
Plant and bird life abound. Sometimes water rushes in the river on the inland 
half of the trail, while a cool breeze lets you know the ocean is fast 
approaching on the trail's lower half. 
</P>
<P>
The trail also takes riders from the bucolic to the industrial: Along one 
stretch in Anaheim, corrals, stables and a small house with roosters and 
chickens line the trail; in Costa Mesa, the bike path passes the sprawling 
United Rock and Concrete Corp.'s yard and a lot filled with fiberglass spas and 
tubs. 
</P>
<P>
Finding the trail head at the inland end is a bit complicated. When the Gypsum 
Canyon Road bridge is completed this fall, the trail will cross over the river, 
extending through Featherly Regional Park, along the Green River Golf Course 
and into Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
There is now no way to cross the riverbed at Gypsum Canyon (although cyclists 
can get off the trail at Weir Canyon Road and ride along Santa Ana Canyon Road 
to reach Featherly Park). 
</P>
<P>
The easiest place to pick up the trail, starting at the inland end, is along La 
Palma Boulevard, between Weir Canyon and the bridge project, in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
Riding southwest, the trail crosses under a bridge where Yorba Linda Boulevard 
becomes Weir Canyon Road, and the river is suddenly full of water -- at least 
when the engineers at the Prado Dam decide to release some. On a recent Sunday, 
the water was flowing freely, a faint reminder of the powerful river the Santa 
Ana was before it was tamed. (During a storm in 1938, its swollen waters killed 
45 county residents. A year later, the dam was built.) 
</P>
<P>
At Imperial Highway, the trail switches from the north to the south side of the 
river, which here runs downstream nearly due west. Past Imperial Highway, a 2 
1/2-mile stretch of the path through Anaheim is called the Imperial Woods 
Trail. Built by the Orange County Flood Control District and Water District, 
the Imperial Woods portion is one of the most scenic parts of the trail. 
</P>
<P>
Great blue herons stand motionless in the shallow water, then execute their 
graceful, slow-motion takeoffs. Mallards, gulls, swallows, egrets and 
red-winged blackbirds are also plentiful along this stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Mat Vallance, 30, a lawyer from Yorba Linda, has extra time to enjoy this part 
of the trail while he is fixing a flat tire on his new aluminum racing bike. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know how to get this tire off?" Vallance asks, explaining that he just 
began cycling a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
As for why he began, "I needed the exercise," says Vallance, who grew up in 
Yorba Linda. "You can really let your mind go out here. . . . I remember when 
people used to go duck hunting with their shotguns right here." 
</P>
<P>
As the trail continues, it makes a gentle southward curve into Anaheim, 
crossing under Lincoln Boulevard, where a clever entrepreneur has placed the 
bike path equivalent of a billboard along the trail: A cardboard sign says, 
"Bike Shop, 2 Blocks," with an arrow pointing the way. 
</P>
<P>
Soon the path takes riders alongside a stable and small ranch-style house. The 
smell of horses is strong, and roosters crow loudly. A rusty, crooked hoop is 
nailed to a piece of fence in the house's dirt driveway, a rustic basketball 
court for some young inhabitant. 
</P>
<P>
The big A of Anaheim Stadium is visible in the distance. Here, the river 
appears dry. Actually, it is underground, in a series of spreading basins that 
allow the water to percolate down into the ground-water supply, to be used by 
nearby homes. 
</P>
<P>
From Taft to Orangewood avenues, the path is closed because of construction of 
the Katella Avenue bridge, which will probably not be completed before early 
1990. Today, however, most bikers simply ride past the signs that point to a 
detour along Main Street, carefully negotiating the Katella Avenue crossing. 
</P>
<P>
South of Katella, the trail is back along the west side of the riverbed and 
passes county landmarks: a county maintenance yard, Anaheim Stadium, the 
Orangewood children's shelter, the scorched county fire training tower, the 
Cinedome movie theaters and Theo Lacy Branch Jail -- surrounded by barbed wire 
and signs warning people not to get too close. A lone guard sits in the jail's 
recreation yard, reading a magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Entering Santa Ana, the path takes the name Forrest S. Paul Memorial Trail. A 
worn plaque from 1966, marred by graffiti, says Paul was devoted to riding and 
hiking trails. 
</P>
<P>
At 17th Street, the trail crosses back over the river. As it goes through Santa 
Ana, graffiti covers almost every inch of path's concrete walls. 
</P>
<P>
At Spurgeon Intermediate School, a baseball game is in progress. Families 
picnic and play soccer on the grass nearby. 
</P>
<P>
An old steel girder railroad bridge with rusted, locked gates spans the 
riverbed just outside the school. It was once part of the old Pacific Electric, 
or Red Car, line that connected Santa Ana to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The trail passes Centennial Regional Park -- a good place to park and unload 
bikes to begin a shorter ride. As it nears the San Diego Freeway, some of the 
more interesting graffiti along the route can be seen on the far bank of the 
riverbed: huge, red-spattered outlines of bodies with the words Let Peace 
Prevail -- End Gang Violence. 
</P>
<P>
Just before the crossing under the freeway, there is more: an oil-soaked paw 
print stamped on an outline of Alaska with the words Exxon's Smoking Paw. 
</P>
<P>
A surprise greets bikers of this hot, nearly shadeless stretch after they pass 
under the freeway. Mike Boyle, a ninth-grader at Estancia High School, has set 
up a lemonade stand in Moon Park along the trail. He comes out just about every 
weekend and sells mineral water and lemonade for $1 a cup. 
</P>
<P>
"I make about $52 a day," Boyle says as a half-dozen thirsty bikers guzzle 
lemonade. "I'm putting it into my car -- a '68 (VW) Bug." 
</P>
<P>
Leaving the park, the path runs outside and below the riverbed's eastern levee 
and is partly sheltered from the wind. A mile or so later, though, the path 
returns to the top of the embankment, and a stiff breeze slows riders down. 
Some afternoons, the wind makes pedaling the last few miles to the ocean 
extremely difficult, but today it just makes riders work a bit harder. 
</P>
<P>
Two miles from the ocean, the river is crossed one more time, on a wooden 
bridge. It would be nicer to be back on the east side of the river here rather 
than riding alongside the Orange County Sanitation Treatment Plant. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, however, the trail reaches the beach, and riders cross under Pacific 
Coast Highway, negotiating two gates installed to slow down the crowd of 
cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
At one gate are Edward and Franca Carmona, training for a bicycle tour of 
France on their identical Diamond Back fat-tired bikes. 
</P>
<P>
They wear radio headsets that allow them to talk to each other within a

If you had one, maybe you would have studied more, or gone out for the football 
team, or at least talked to that guy or girl with the locker near yours. 
</P>
<P>
All anybody ever wants is another chance. 
</P>
<P>
Hot Topics wonders: "If you could repeat this last school year, what would you 
do differently?"

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Julie Suscardo, 16, 
</P>
<P>
junior, Brea-Olinda

</P>
<P>
Christina Gonzalez, 18, 
</P>
<P>

SHOPPING: SOMETIMES USED IS BETTER THAN NEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN NEWELL YOUNG, Karen Newell Young is a regular contributor to Orange 
County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To the adage "never pay full price" should be added this commandment: "Buy used 
whenever possible." But where can you buy good stuff cheap? 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most dependable spots for used merchandise are the county's 10 
thrift shops run by local Assistance Leagues. Donated primarily by members, the 
used clothing, furnishings, toys and sports equipment are sold at rock-bottom 
prices, with the money used for Assistance League charities such as day care, 
dental programs, homemaking services and scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
Scouring the clothes racks at any thrift store is like strolling down the 
Memory Lane of fashion trends, where bell bottoms, granny gowns and disco-era 
polyester shirts struggle for a second chance. But among the passe discards are 
hidden treasures -- the timeless but forsaken trinkets that keep their rescuers 
coming back for more. And every bargain hunter is hoping to hit the jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
Each store has its own tale of how some extraordinary donations caused a flurry 
of excitement. Like the time a Santa Ana Assistance League member donated a 
bundle of St. John Knits dresses, which when new sell for several hundred 
dollars each, and even the volunteers couldn't resist them. They were quickly 
scarfed up at $75 each. Or the time in Newport Beach when a 14-foot Laser 
sailboat with a trailer swiftly fetched $350. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the merchandise is slightly used clothing and household goods. 
</P>
<P>
According to guidelines of the National Assistance League, which oversees all 
the local Assistance League shops, each store has to return more than 50% of 
its income to the community. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the stores return far more than that," says Pat Spears, a National 
Assistance League spokeswoman. "Many return about 75% or 80% to the community." 
</P>
<P>
Each shop is staffed entirely by volunteers, who take turns manning the cash 
register, maintaining the store, laundering the clothes and pricing the 
donations, which vary from community to community. Each store also caters to a 
slightly different crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Jeanne Mengos, chairman of the Assistance League of Santa Ana Thrift Shop, says 
her store caters to the low-income residents of the First and Flower streets 
neighborhood. Here clothing, especially shoes at $1 a pair, and bric-a-brac 
sell fast. 
</P>
<P>
"First they want to clothe their children," says Mengos. "Then they want to 
brighten their homes. I come in with a box of bric-a-brac and it disappears." 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers at the Newport Beach Assistance League Thrift Shop on 32nd Street are 
looking for something a little different, according to its chairman, Aileen 
Schrader. The most popular items here are furniture and work outfits. 
</P>
<P>
Schrader tells of the man who needed clothes for a job interview. Volunteers 
brought out a Neiman Marcus suit in his size, and matched him up with shirt, 
tie and shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"A few weeks later he came back in and told us he got the job," she adds. "This 
is the kind of thing that makes us so happy because it shows that what we do 
makes a difference." 
</P>
<P>
Schrader adds that furniture is a hot commodity at her Balboa Peninsula store 
because rentals are plentiful in the area and residents are looking for 
inexpensive ways to furnish apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers say many of their customers are regulars. In Santa Ana, there is the 
woman who buys several pairs of shoes nearly every day and is thought to be 
selling them at swap meets. In Tustin, an elderly man methodically checks the 
jewelry counter daily, only occasionally buying a bauble or two. 
</P>
<P>
"You see the same people every day because it's like the neighborhood 
department store," says Mengos of the Santa Ana store. 
</P>
<P>
A look at four local Assistance League thrift shops in the past week turned up 
the following merchandise: 
</P>
<P>
At the Santa Ana store were men's hockey skates (size 10) for $5, new-looking 
wet suits for $7, bowling ball and bag for $8.50 and a waffle baker for $6. 
Cookie tins sold for 5 cents each, silk scarfs for 50 cents each and leather 
gloves for $1. A new mailbox cost $8 and a blue I. Magnin women's robe (size 
5-6) went for $3.50. 
</P>
<P>
At Tustin's thrift shop were a never-used car radio for $5, Liz Claiborne jeans 
for $3 and a navy L.L. Bean knit dress for $1.50. Most of the men's suits cost 
$12, and ties go for 10 cents each. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange, a new-looking pair of men's suede shoes (size 12) cost $10, a beige 
leather Cherokee handbag cost $4, a Liz Claiborne shirt (medium) cost $8 and a 
women's Benetton shirt (medium) cost $5. 
</P>
<P>
In Newport Beach were a Nordstrom sweater vest for $2, ladies sun dresses for 
$5, a woman's Stanley Blacker cotton suit (size 4) for $12, and a two-piece Liz 
Claiborne knit dress for $8. The shop also had wedding dresses ($37.50 and up), 
an exercise cycle ($40), oil paintings ($15 and up) and a good selection of 
furniture and toys. 
</P>
<P>
The county's largest Assistance League thrift shops are those in Santa Ana and 
Newport Beach, according to the National Assistance League. Of the four shops 
visited, the Newport Beach store had the most variety and best quality. It also 
was the only store that had a large selection of furniture. 
</P>
<P>
"We get lots of young families who are setting up housekeeping, and we're the 
first place they visit," says a Newport Beach volunteer. "These days, it's hard 
enough to be able to afford the rent, let alone the furnishings."

SINGLE LIFE: GREETING CARDS PUT NEW STAMP ON DATING RITUAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN CHRISTIAN, Susan Christian is a regular contributor to Orange County 
Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Situation One: You were under the impression that your blind date had as much 
fun as you did. But 2 weeks have passed and you haven't heard a peep out of 
him. What's a woman to do? 
</P>
<P>
Solution: Send him a card, perhaps the one that says, "1,387 hours, 22 seconds. 
Average length of time a woman waits for a man to call. . . . Time's up." 
(Carolyn Bean Cards.) 
</P>
<P>
Situation Two: You and your best friend recently had a no-good-men 
conversation, which she immediately followed up with an appropriate card. So 
now you owe her one. How can you outdo her? 
</P>
<P>
Solution: Go to a Hallmark shop, and find the card that says, "We shouldn't 
worry about finding a man. There are lots of men out there. They're married, 
lunatics and losers, sure, but they're out there." 
</P>
<P>
And so on, ad infinitum. 
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, there has been a proliferation of such greeting cards 
aimed at the singles market. Commonly found in the "Fun and Love" section at 
gift shops, the humorous cards address every aspect of single life -- for 
better or worse. 
</P>
<P>
There are post-date cards, love-hate cards, losing-weight cards. There are 
congratulations-on-your-divorce cards and sorry-your-dumb-boyfriend-dumped-you 
cards. There are cards too sweet for words and cards too dirty for mention. 
</P>
<P>
"We have cards for all the different stages of dating -- first date, casual 
flirtation, longstanding relationships," Hallmark spokeswoman Barbara Miller 
said. "They are one of our fastest-growing areas." 
</P>
<P>
Paper Moon Graphics, the Los Angeles-based manufacturer that rocketed into 
orbit 12 years ago, sells as many "Fun and Love" cards as it does birthday 
cards. "In the past 3 years, our relationship cards have had phenomenal 
success," said Vivian Lipman, national sales manager for Paper Moon. 
</P>
<P>
Lipman attributed the genre's upward mobility to relationship-confused yuppies. 
"So many men have the Peter Pan syndrome (i.e., fear of commitment) that it has 
become women's little joke," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Male-bashing is definitely hot in card land. "Quick: What's the difference?" 
asks a Hallmark witticism displaying a rock vs. a man on its cover. Answer: 
"Right, the rock is slightly more sensitive (also a better listener)." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Templeman, president of Southern California-based Scott Cards 
(distributed by Recycled Paper Products), gave two reasons for the popularity 
of male-bashing. 
</P>
<P>
First, women buy 85% to 90% of all greeting cards. "It's a female-dominated 
market," Templeman said. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Templeman added, "all those male-bashing books of the past 10 
years" have fanned the fire. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a double standard," he said. "Some of the things you can get away with 
saying about men would be viewed as sexist if said about women. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's all in fun; I don't think men take this stuff too seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Relationship themes have been "revolutionary rather than evolutionary," said 
Dennis Chupa, executive director of everyday products for American Greeting. 
"They emerge almost spontaneously -- seemingly overnight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Divorce cards did not fare well for American Greeting until they recently 
gained a sense of humor: "Let's face it: Your prince turned out to be a frog." 
</P>
<P>
"Still, divorce cards are tricky, no matter how they're approached," Chupa 
said. "You have to know how the person is handling their divorce before you can 
send them a joke about it." 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco-based Carolyn Bean Cards offers this consolation: "Your spouse 
was a louse. Be sure you get the house." 
</P>
<P>
A lot of "Fun and Love" cards actually deal with love -- or, at least, like. 
Many do so in a risque manner: 
</P>
<P>
* "The moment our eyes met, the rest of me wanted to get acquainted." 
(Carlton.) 
</P>
<P>
* "I've had it with you. And boy was it great." (Paper Moon.) 
</P>
<P>
* "Wanna cuddle? Or whatever." (Scott Cards.) 
</P>
<P>
* "You make me feel like a kid again. Wanna sleep over?" (Hallmark.) 
</P>
<P>
That last one is about as suggestive as Hallmark gets, but other manufacturers 
push the limits. "Some of the most conservative-looking people come in here and 
buy cards with four-letter words," said Sandra Small, manager of Mr. G's 
Expressions card shop in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hallmark's 3-year-old Shoebox Cards division sprinkles 
double-entendres throughout its line of cards, the company still steers clear 
of strong language. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a hard call," spokeswoman Miller admitted. "Our overriding concern is 
that customers consider our cards in good taste. Yet we don't want to seem 
old-fashioned; we want to be timely and to reflect contemporary society." 
</P>
<P>
Many "Fun and Love" cards reflect the issues singles are facing in contemporary 
society.

"The Raw and the Cooked," Fine Young Cannibals' first No. 1 album, nudged 
Madonna out of the top spot of the Billboard magazine pop album chart after her 
"Like a Prayer" had reigned for six weeks. John Cougar Mellencamp's "Big Daddy" 
is an instant hit, climbing all the way to No. 13 in just two weeks. Bonnie 
Raitt's "Nick of Time" (No. 24) continues its steady rise. Cyndi Lauper may 
have a hit album: Her "A Night to Remember" jumped from No. 84 to No. 52. The 
surprise of the week is that Aretha Franklin's "Through the Storm," which 
figured to be a big hit since it boasts all those guest stars, moved up only 
two notches, to No. 62. The new No. 1 pop single is Michael Damian's "Rock On." 
</P>
<P>
* Richard Marx, who's been called the new Kenny Loggins, has become a big star. 
His "Repeat Offender" shot up to No. 17 on the pop album chart in just three 
weeks.

The Department of Veterans Affairs announced today that it will cut some 
veterans health care services because "urgently needed" funds are tied up in a 
congressional battle over an emergency spending bill. 
</P>
<P>
VA Secretary Edward J. Derwinski called the cutbacks "temporary" and said they 
will be closely monitored. But he warned that unless the urgently needed new 
funds reach the department soon, more drastic cutbacks will follow. 
</P>
<P>
The department said the immediate steps being taken to save health care funds 
include a freeze on accepting new patients whose eligibility depends on 
available VA resources. Except in emergencies, the agency said, veterans 
affected are those with non-service-connected conditions whose incomes are 
above limits set by law. 
</P>
<P>
Other actions include decreasing staff levels at VA facilities through 
attrition.

<P>
A man shot dead by a Santa Ana motorcycle officer as he tried to escape arrest 
Thursday was identified by a police spokesman this morning as Paul Castro, 20, 
of Santa Ana, who was being sought by police as a suspect in at least two armed 
robberies. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said police "had been looking for him pretty heavily" for at 
least two weeks when officers received a tip that Castro was at an address in 
the 2000 block of W. Civic Center Drive. The spokesman said four uniformed 
officers were sent to the address, and when Castro saw them pull up, he began 
to run and reach to his waist. One officer fired twice, hitting him once in the 
back, police said.

TEACHERS BACK AT SCHOOLS; HALF OF STUDENTS STILL OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH J. MANN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A mood of ebullience and relief swept across the sprawling Los Angeles Unified 
School District today as teachers returned to their classrooms and campus life 
resumed its normal routine. 
</P>
<P>
But many teachers found sparse attendance among students, who had apparently 
decided to begin the Memorial Day weekend early. District officials estimated 
that about half of the district's 594,000 students came to school today, 
slightly fewer than the number who attended school Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
There was no official estimate of how many teachers were in class today. 
</P>
<P>
The nine-day teachers' strike ended Thursday with United Teachers-Los Angeles 
and the school board approving a pact that increases teacher pay by 24% over 
three years, gives teachers shared power with parents and administrators on 
school decision-making councils, and reduces some outside classroom duties. 
</P>
<P>
Most instructors said they are glad to be back and anxious to make up for lost 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Darlene Haezaert, a Venice High School Health teacher, said instructors at her 
school felt victorious. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody feels real good," Haezaert said. "I think we won." 
</P>
<P>
But other teachers said they harbored bitter feelings toward those who crossed 
the picket lines. "It is grossly unfair that they are going to get the same 
thing that we fought so hard and struck for. It is like a cold breeze in the 
middle of this sunshining day, but it is good to be back," said Ellen Wormser, 
a Hamilton High School counselor who sported a UTLA T-shirt.

VALENCIA TEEN DENIES CHARGE HE KILLED FRIEND IN RUSSIAN ROULETTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Times wire services

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Valencia teen-ager pleaded not guilty today to charges that he murdered a 
school friend during a one-sided game of Russian roulette, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-year-old suspect, who was not named because he is a juvenile, denied the 
charge during a brief arraignment hearing at Sylmar Juvenile Court. Los Angeles 
County Deputy Dist. Atty. Craig R. Richman said a denial in juvenile court is 
similar to a not guilty plea in criminal court. 
</P>
<P>
The boy is charged in the Tuesday killing of Gabriel Soto, 13, of Newhall. 
Authorities said the suspect, Soto and another 14-year-old were in the 
suspect's home when he partially loaded his father's gun and took turns 
pointing it at himself and the others, pulling the trigger. Soto and the other 
boy, Aaron Schwartz, were described by Soto's parents as unwilling participants 
in the game. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, who had apparently played Russian roulette with another boy two 
weeks earlier but did not injure him, was being held at Sylmar Juvenile Hall. 
Judge Morton Rochman scheduled a hearing for June 21 to set a trial date. If 
convicted, the boy could be sentenced to the California Youth Authority until 
he is 25.

Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said today that the West is witnessing "the 
failure of the communist ideology and the meltdown of authoritarian regimes." 
</P>
<P>
In a broad-ranging speech after receiving the honorary freedom of the City of 
London and the right to herd sheep across London Bridge, Thatcher noted the 
"great upheavals" taking place in the Soviet Union, Hungary, Poland and China. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony in the medieval Guildhall Building was to mark Thatcher's 10 years 
in office. 
</P>
<P>
As an honorary freeman of the City, London's financial district, Thatcher 
follows such former prime ministers as David Lloyd George, Winston Churchill 
and Harold Wilson. The honor bestows a centuries-old right to herd sheep across 
London Bridge.

Maverick Boris N. Yeltsin and several prominent reformers in the new congress 
were nominated today for a smaller, full-time legislature, but some charged 
that senior officials rigged the nominee list to stay in power. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania threatened to boycott the elections to the new legislature if 
delegates from other republics are allowed to vote on the Lithuanian slate. 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanians and other Baltic reformers want to protect their small reform 
slates from being lost in an all-congress vote. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
called the boycott threat "a crisis situation." 
</P>
<P>
The moves came during the second day of debate in the 2,250-member Congress of 
People's Deputies, the first competitively elected national assembly and the 
latest step in the Soviet experiment with democratic reform. 
</P>
<P>
Only one member of the ruling Communist Party Politburo appeared on a 
congressional list of nominees for the smaller law-making body, the Supreme 
Soviet, assuring an overhaul of its traditional makeup.

activity in the congress, which was elected this spring in the first nationwide 
multicandidate balloting in 70 years. 
</P>
<P>
A list of 573 members of congress selected by their home regions was prepared 
for 542 seats in the Supreme Soviet, giving deputies few choices but setting up 
tough races for lawmakers from Moscow, home to many of the reformers. 
</P>
<P>
"The party apparatus is once again asking us to elect the Supreme Soviet 
according to the old system," complained deputy Vladimir Shevlyuga of Rostov. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Zolotukhin of Tashkent said top party and government officials in 
Uzbekistan had themselves nominated without consulting other deputies from the 
republic. 
</P>
<P>
Reformers lost an attempt to force top party officials to choose between their 
party jobs and serving in the Supreme Soviet, as a way of easing the grip of 
the party bureaucracy on the country's legislature.

1ST MAN ON MOON BACKS PLANNED SPACE STATION

Neil A. Armstrong, who walked into history 20 years ago July as the first man 
on the moon, made a rare public appearance today with his two Apollo 11 crew 
mates and endorsed NASA's planned space station. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference to commemorate the 20th anniversary of their historic 
flight, Armstrong, 58, Edwin E. (Buzz) Aldrin, 59, and Michael Collins, 58, 
reminisced about their July 16, 1969, blastoff atop a mighty Saturn 5 rocket 
and the mission that fulfilled President John F. Kennedy's promise to land men 
on the moon before the end of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago, I did make a statement endorsing the concept of a permanent 
presence in space," Armstrong said. "I guess I still feel that's a worthy 
objective. I hope that space station Freedom becomes a reality before we have 
another 10 years go by." 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong was referring to NASA's plans to build a permanently manned space 
station in the late 1990s, a project that is threatened by budget cuts and a 
lack of political support. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mars Mission Endorsed 
</P>
<P>
Aldrin called for an evolutionary approach to exploring the solar system while 
Collins strongly endorsed a mission to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this country should set a goal of exploring and setting up on Mars," 
Collins said. "That is the one goal that . . . I think would have a unifying 
and perhaps even an electrifying effect on NASA and our space program." 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong and Aldrin touched down in the Sea of Tranquility on July 20, 1969, 
in a spider-like lunar module spacecraft called Eagle while Collins orbited 69 
miles overhead in the gumdrop-shaped Apollo command module, Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind," Armstrong said as 
he stepped onto the moon's surface. 
</P>
<P>
While Aldrin and Collins have granted interviews and written books, Armstrong, 
a very private man, has routinely refused to meet the press or make public 
appearances.

DOW UP 11.18, BOOSTED BY DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES

<P>
Stock prices advanced broadly today, aided by new declines in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 11.18 to 2,493.77, cutting its 
loss for the week to 7.33 points. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 2 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 1,025 up, 412 down and 513 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 143.12 million shares, against 154.47 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index gained 1.26 to 179.31. 
</P>
<P>
Activity tapered off through the day as many traders got an early start on the 
long Memorial Day weekend. The markets will be closed on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates fell in the credit markets. Prices of long-term government bonds 
rose more than $5 for each $1,000 in face value, reducing their yields to the 
8.6%-8.65% range. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said stocks benefited from expectations that the recent downturn in 
rates might have further to go, with encouragement from the Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
The economy has showed signs of slowing lately, as Fed policy makers have 
intended. Furthermore, some observers think the central bank might want to ease 
credit in order to slow the recent sharp rise of the dollar in foreign 
exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices were higher in early trading today, rebounding from an earlier 
decline on the strength of the rising dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's key 30-year bond was up 17/32 point, or about $5.30 for every 
$1,000 in face value, at around midday. Its yield, which moves in the opposite 
direction to its price, had declined to 8.62% from 8.67% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Early trading was thin. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said bond prices were knocked down earlier today by the government 
report on consumer spending, which fueled the market's fears of inflation. Bond 
prices recovered later, however, as the dollar strengthened against major 
foreign currencies, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, it looks like we're just shrugging off some of the economic data 
recently and focusing on the foreign exchange market," said Kevin Flanagan, a 
money market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Secondary Market 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of short-term 
government issues were up 1/16 point to 3/32 point, intermediate maturities had 
gained 3/16 point to 5/16 point and long-term issues had jumped about 1/2 
point, according to figures provided by the Telerate Inc. financial information 
service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer, 
had risen 2.40 to 1,150.95. 
</P>
<P>
In corporate trading, industrial bonds were lower. Moody's investment grade 
corporate bond index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80 
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, had slipped 0.16 to 
313.42.

Journalists and technicians at the British Broadcasting Corp. staged the fourth 
in a series of 24-hour strikes over wages today, disrupting radio and 
television programs. 
</P>
<P>
National Union of Journalists spokesman Don Brind said more than 10,000 
employees were on strike, but BBC spokesmen said it was too early to say how 
many of the corporation's 28,000 employees joined the action because many work 
in shifts. 
</P>
<P>
Brind said three unions representing 20,000 workers went on strike after the 
BBC refused to reopen talks or increase its 7% wage offer. The unions want a 
16% increase.

U.S. TRADE DEFICIT DROPS SHARPLY TO $27.6 BILLION, LOWEST IN 4 YEARS

<P>
The U.S. trade deficit improved sharply in the first three months of the year, 
narrowing to $27.6 billion for the smallest quarterly imbalance in four years, 
the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said the imbalance between imports and U.S. exports 
fell by 13.7% from a fourth-quarter deficit of $32.02 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The improvement stemmed from a 5.7% jump in exports, which pushed sales of 
American goods abroad to a record of $88.50 billion. Imports also hit a record 
of $116.13 billion, but the 3.4% increase was smaller than the rate of export 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
The big jump in exports reflected increases in sales of industrial products, 
consumer goods and farm products. The 11% advance in farm exports put American 
agricultural sales at $10.9 billion, the highest level in almost eight years. 
</P>
<P>
The rise in imports came entirely from an increase in petroleum imports, which 
shot up 18% to $10.8 billion, with the advance coming from the higher cost of 
oil. Non-petroleum imports declined by $1.2 billion to $105.3 billion, 
reflecting a drop in demand for consumer goods and autos. 
</P>
<P>
The improved trade performance put the quarterly deficit at the lowest level 
since a $25.7-billion imbalance in the first quarter of 1985.

Defending men's champion Mats Wilander of Sweden should have an easy time in 
the first two rounds of the French Open tennis championships. 
</P>
<P>
In today's draw, he was chosen to meet a qualifier in the first round. If he 
wins, his second-round opponent will be the winner of another match between two 
qualifiers. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander, the No. 4 seed, won three Grand Slam titles in 1988 and vaulted into 
the No. 1 ranking in the world. Since then, however, he has been off form and 
dropped to No. 4 in the rankings. 
</P>
<P>
His opponents will be determined Sunday following the completion of the 
qualifying tournament for the final 16 spots. 
</P>
<P>
Top seed Ivan Lendl of Czechoslovakia will meet West German Davis Cup player 
Patrick Kuhnen in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
No. 2 seed Boris Becker, who led West Germany to the Davis Cup title, faces 
American Jim Pugh in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Third-seeded Stefan Edberg of Sweden drew Czechoslovakia's Marian Vajda for his 
first match, while fifth-seeded Andre Agassi of the United States will play 
another Swede, Johan Carlsson. 
</P>
<P>
On the women's side, defending champion Steffi Graf of West Germany, seeking 
her sixth straight Grand Slam title, is the top seed and Gabriela Sabatini of 
Argentina is seeded second. Both should reach the final easily since Martina 
Navratilova and Chris Evert are skipping the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Graf drew American Camille Benjamin in the first round, while Sabatini got 
Japan's Akemi Nishiya.

A seven-block area of downtown Calgary turned into a milling, cheering, 
hollering, drinking celebration as a crowd estimated at 20,000 toasted the 
Flames' Stanley Cup triumph and the Alberta city's first major championship 
since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the Olympics, Christmas and the Stampede wrapped into one," Jerry 
Christensen said Thursday night.

Their faces painted with flaming-red Cs, the crowds flowed out of bars as the 
final seconds ticked away in the Flames' 4-2 victory over the Canadiens at the 
Montreal Forum. (Story, Part III, Page 1.) 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 police officers, most on foot, others on motorcycles and horses, 
stood watch over the noisy, sometimes obnoxious but generally well-behaved 
crowd. Inspector Jim Berger said that seven arrests were made and that some 
scuffles broke out. One man was taken away in an ambulance after his arm was 
badly cut in a fight. But many of the revelers chatted with the officers and 
shook their hands.
