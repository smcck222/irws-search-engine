GRAND JURY URGES CITIZEN PANEL OVER SHERIFF; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: THE CALL FOR AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW BOARD AND THE RECENT 
SHOOTING DEATH OF A VISTA MAN ACTIVATE SHERIFF'S CANDIDATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego County Grand Jury on Friday urged the creation of a "strong and 
independent" citizens' advisory review board to monitor the activities of the 
Sheriff's Department and to investigate complaints of deputy misconduct and 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the grand jury, acting on a unanimous request by the county Board 
of Supervisors, agreed to launch its own investigation into a May 18 incident 
in Vista in which a young man was shot to death after a deputy sheriff and 
reserve deputy mistook him for an auto thief. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury's actions and the continuing public concern over the death of 
21-year-old Jeffrey Bray also triggered a flurry of activity among candidates 
for sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
One candidate, Vince Jimno, abruptly reversed his position Friday and agreed 
with the grand jury on the need for a review panel, while another candidate, 
Jim Roache, attended the grand jury's press conference and passed out news 
releases reiterating his support for a review board. 
</P>
<P>
They also stepped up their criticism of fellow candidate Jack Drown, chastising 
him for siding with Sheriff John Duffy in opposing a review board and for not 
exerting leadership by attempting to calm the public outcry after Bray's death. 
</P>
<P>
A grand jury spokesman said the timing of the announcement was not an attempt 
to influence the June 5 primary election for sheriff, or to cast aspersions on 
whether the deputy and reserve deputy erred when Bray was shot to death outside 
his apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
"We just felt it was timely right now," said George T. Wise, who led the grand 
jury's nine-month investigation into whether a review board for the Sheriff's 
Department should be established. 
</P>
<P>
"But we do want to put it in place before a new sheriff takes office, so I 
guess in that regard politics was in the back of our minds." 
</P>
<P>
In its report, the grand jury noted that it does not have the time or resources 
to adequately investigate citizen complaints of deputy misconduct. "The grand 
jury is burdened enough with all the duties it is mandated to do," said J. Phil 
Franklin, grand jury foreman. 
</P>
<P>
The report also noted that the sheriff's internal affairs unit is not properly 
equipped to handle a large number of investigations. Using the recent flood of 
allegations of deputies assaulting jail inmates as an example, the grand jury 
report said the sheriff's internal affairs unit had a difficult time keeping up 
with the multitude of complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an awesome task to undertake, even for a full complement of six 
internal affairs investigators, as that unit is now constituted," the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
With those limitations in mind, Franklin said the grand jury was calling on the 
county Board of Supervisors to create a citizens' advisory review board whose 
members would be chosen by the individual supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury did not recommend how the review board should be structured. 
However, Franklin and Wise said they did not believe state law and the county 
charter would allow the review board to have subpoena powers or hold public 
hearings, which would make the panel similar to the review board approved by 
San Diego voters last year to work with the San Diego Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury said the Board of Supervisors should not wait to hold an 
election on a sheriff's review board, however, but should act immediately to 
create the panel. 
</P>
<P>
"The Board of Supervisors is there to make decisions," Franklin said. "They 
shouldn't have to refer everything to a vote of the public." 
</P>
<P>
Reaction at the Board of Supervisors appeared favorable. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Susan Golding, who has repeatedly called over the past year for the 
creation of a review board, was hopeful the board would move quickly to 
implement an independent panel. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor John MacDonald already has indicated to her, Golding said, that he 
backs the proposal and Leon Williams, the current board president, is a likely 
supporter. In addition, she said, Supervisor Brian Bilbray told her earlier 
this week that he would "take a careful look at it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have great respect for good law enforcement officers," Golding said. "I just 
think we all need reassurances that the right things are going on." 
</P>
<P>
Franklin and Wise said they studied review panels in other areas and heard 
conflicting opinions from staff members in the San Diego County Sheriff's 
Department. But the grand jury members said they did not discuss the concept 
with Duffy, who, as sheriff for the last 20 years, has been adamantly opposed 
to a review board. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement his office released after the grand jury report, Duffy called 
instead for expansion of the grand jury as an alternative to a review panel. He 
also strongly objected to elected supervisors appointing review board members 
to monitor the elected sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that the grand jury's report," he said, "while well-intended, offers no 
viable solutions to a complex issue." 
</P>
<P>
Jimno, who had been opposed to a review board, announced Friday that he now 
agrees with the grand jury. If elected sheriff, he said, he would propose 
within six months a type of review panel he would favor. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why he changed his mind, Jimno said: "I just feel it is going to be stuck 
down our throats either way, so we might as well become a part of it. And there 
were a number of people pushing me who said it was time. And they are strong 
supporters of mine." 
</P>
<P>
Roache, who seized on the grand jury's announcement as an opportunity to 
restate his support of a review panel, said he favors a review board that would 
hold public hearings, but not have power to subpoena deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Roache, Jimno and a third candidate, Jim Messenger, also chastised Drown for 
opposing a review board and criticized his handling of events following the 
shooting death in Vista. 
</P>
<P>
They criticized Drown and the Sheriff's Department for seizing a news 
photographer's film of the Vista shooting and for being slow in releasing 
details of the killing. They also said Drown should have visited the scene of 
the incident to help calm the public outcry 
</P>
<P>
Messenger said the Sheriff's Department is already considered arrogant and that 
Drown's "failure to assume a leadership role perpetuates the public's 
perception." 
</P>
<P>
Drown responded that no matter what he did or did not do after the Bray 
shooting, the candidates would never be satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had been out there, the other candidates would have then said I was 
grandstanding and taking advantage of a very tragic situation for political 
reasons, to get my name and photograph out front," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Drown also defended his opposition to a review panel and for agreeing with 
Duffy that the grand jury system should be expanded or a second grand jury 
impaneled. 
</P>
<P>
He said he preferred a grand jury to monitor citizen complaints because its 
members are appointed by the Superior Court and not politicians, as would be 
the case if the supervisors named review board members. 
</P>
<P>
"I think its important to keep politics out of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Defending Drown's position was the Deputy Sheriffs Assn., which like Duffy is 
endorsing Drown's candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sheriff's Department's internal affairs unit currently has a little over 
200 complaints a year," said Randall Dibb, association president. "Of those, 
few if any require further investigation or review."

FBI NOW INVESTIGATING VISTA SLAYING BY SHERIFF'S DEPUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The FBI said Friday that it will investigate the fatal shooting of Jeffrey Bray 
last week in Vista by a reserve sheriff's deputy, saying the victim's civil 
rights may have been violated by the officers. 
</P>
<P>
FBI spokesman Ron Orrantia said the bureau decided on its own on Friday to 
conduct the probe, but that, coincidentally, the father of the victim called 
the FBI later in the day to ask for an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a preliminary investigation under way, initiated by ourselves, for a 
possible federal civil rights violation under the color of law," Orrantia said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation, he said, will be concurrent with the one now being conducted 
by the Sheriff's Department. Results of that investigation will be turned over 
to the district attorney's office for review and possible action. Orrantia 
offered no date for the conclusion of the FBI probe, and he declined to comment 
further on the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Glenn Revell, a spokesman for the San Diego County Sheriff's Department, 
said: "The FBI's decision to initiate an investigation into the circumstances 
surrounding the death of Jeffery Bray is certainly within the realm of their 
authority. The Sheriff's Department will assist the bureau in any way it can." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Bray, Jeffrey Bray's father, said in a telephone interview from Conway, 
Ark., that he welcomes the FBI's interest in the shooting death of his 
21-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy to know they're looking into it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I called them myself (Friday) morning and talked to an agent who asked me why 
I wanted them to look into it. I said I felt they needed to. There was a pause, 
and he put me on hold, and he came back and told me that they already were 
doing a preliminary investigation." 
</P>
<P>
The FBI's investigation will be the second outside of the district attorney's 
office to review the shooting. On Wednesday, the County Board of Supervisors 
asked the grand jury to also investigate the killing, and on Friday the grand 
jury said it would. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Bray was shot and killed May 18 when he pulled into the driveway of his 
apartment complex in Vista and, apparently unwittingly, backed into a patrol 
car that had followed him on the suspicion that Bray was driving a stolen 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses have told The Times that reserve Deputy Sheriff John S. Wickham, 31, 
had gotten out of the passenger side of the vehicle just as Bray accelerated 
backward, and fired at Bray three times with his 9-millimeter semiautomatic 
handgun as Bray's pickup truck collided with the patrol car. One of the shots 
fired by Wickham -- who instructs other reserve deputies in firearms -- struck 
Bray in the head, killing him instantly. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Sheriff's Deputy William C. Fewell got out on the driver's 
side and, mistaking Wickham's shots for ones being fired from the pickup truck, 
fired his own .357-caliber revolver at the truck, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, sources at the Sheriff's Department say, the two deputies 
apparently believed they had shot a 24-year-old Latino man known as "Shorty," 
who has had frequent run-ins with law enforcement in North County, mostly in 
Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Fewell and Wickham were at the Vista sheriff's substation when they overheard a 
car-to-car radio call from another deputy in the field, Joe Mata, that he had 
spotted the man known as Shorty in what may have been a stolen vehicle, 
according to those who heard the call. Because he had a prisoner in his patrol 
car, Mata himself couldn't give chase, but radioed in the suspect's nickname, a 
description of the vehicle and its license plate number. 
</P>
<P>
Fewell enlisted Wickham, who had just arrived for his volunteer shift and was 
still in his street clothes, and the two drove to Hacienda Drive, which runs 
alongside the sheriff's substation and which is where Mata said he last saw the 
red pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department acknowledged that the two deputies tailed the wrong 
truck, mistakenly choosing to follow Bray's similar vehicle because he was 
traveling at an "excessive speed." 
</P>
<P>
The department said the deputies followed Bray into his apartment complex and 
stopped 20 feet behind his vehicle, but, no sooner had Wickham gotten out of 
the patrol car than Bray looked rearward and accelerated backward, colliding 
with the patrol car. At that moment, Wickham shot and killed Bray, a carpenter 
who was on leave from the Marine Corps. 
</P>
<P>
A man at the shooting scene, who asked that his name not be published, told The 
Times that he had called out to Bray as he drove up the driveway, and contends 
that Bray stopped his vehicle and backed up to talk to him. Bray didn't know 
the sheriff's patrol car was there, the witness said, and was shot and killed 
before he knew what he had hit. 
</P>
<P>
Even after the shooting, the identity of the victim was still a mystery to 
some, as deputies at the Vista station told others, according to one deputy who 
was there, that "they shot Shorty." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the original suspect had turned off Hacienda Drive into another 
apartment complex, and even watched the patrol car as it continued up the 
street, following Bray, according to deputies familiar with last week's events. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, there were two separate misdemeanor arrest warrants for the 
suspect Shorty, but law enforcement officers have long acknowledged that, 
because the county's jails are crowded, only persons wanted on felony arrest 
warrants are apprehended. 
</P>
<P>
Shorty was most recently named in the two separate arrest warrants for his 
failure to appear in Vista Municipal Court to answer to charges that he was 
driving a vehicle on a revoked or suspended driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old, according to court records, had previously pleaded guilty 
twice to misdemeanor battery, including one assault on his live-in girlfriend 
about a year ago, and a second time four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1988, he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor counts of possession of 
methamphetamine and driving without a license. A third charge, of possessing a 
dagger, was dropped, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies familiar with Shorty said his most recent run-in with the law came 
when he was stopped two months ago on suspicion of driving a stolen vehicle -- 
a red pickup truck. The vehicle was not stolen, it was learned, and instead he 
was cited for driving on a suspended license and for not having insurance. 
</P>
<P>
In the moments after the shooting last week, Fewell and Wickham apparently 
believed that they had been dealing with an armed suspect. Witnesses said the 
deputies ordered the driver several times to put his hands where they would be 
visible, and yelled to the bystander witness to get out of the area because 
"the guy's got a gun." 
</P>
<P>
No weapon was found.

JUDGE REJECTS DRUG SEARCHES AT CHECKPOINTS; 
</P>
<P>
CIVIL RIGHTS: FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S BID TO ALLOW STOPS WITHOUT PROBABLE CAUSE IS 
CALLED UNCONSTITUTIONAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A U.S. District Court judge Friday rejected the federal government's bid to 
give the U.S. Border Patrol authority to make drug searches "without a founded 
suspicion" at the two immigration checkpoints on major freeways leaving the San 
Diego area. 
</P>
<P>
In a major victory for civil libertarians, Judge J. Lawrence Irving ruled that 
the government's request to use the checkpoints for both immigration and 
drug-related stops of motorists would violate the Constitution, particularly 
Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys opposing the government's motion had argued that expanded 
narcotics jurisdiction at the checkpoints -- in the northbound lanes of 
Interstate 5 near San Clemente and of Interstate 15 in southern Riverside 
County -- could eventually give U. S. officials broad authority to set up drug 
checkpoints almost anywhere in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite the gravity of the drug-trafficking problem and the brevity of the 
proposed stops," Irving wrote in his 16-page decision, "this court cannot 
condone the evisceration of the Fourth Amendment by allowing permanent 
checkpoints to serve the 'dual purpose' of permitting Border Patrol officers to 
investigate both immigration and narcotics violations." 
</P>
<P>
The decision was applauded by Betty Wheeler, legal director of the American 
Civil Liberties Union of San Diego and Imperial Counties, who called the 
government's request yet another example of the assault on individual rights 
associated with the anti-drug efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just one instance in many in which the perceived drug crisis has 
caused the government to seek exceptions to civil liberties requirements," 
Wheeler said. "Our view is that it is precisely during times of perceived 
crisis that our civil liberties have to be upheld." 
</P>
<P>
William Braniff, U.S. attorney in San Diego, said prosecutors will probably 
continue to seek court approval for the drug stops, possibly at the appellate 
level. However, he noted that Irving's decision will not be appealed, as the 
judge, in the same ruling, actually upheld the legality of two recent drug 
seizures at the checkpoints that resulted in criminal prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
Irving ruled that the Border Patrol had sufficient legal authority to conduct 
the searches that led to the seizures because the behavior of the motorists 
gave the agents reasonable cause to suspect that something was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel our position is a correct one, and we look forward to being able to 
demonstrate that in the future, either to another judge or a higher court," 
Braniff said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attorney general's office in Washington had approved the prosecutor's 
decision to seek authority to conduct drug stops at the checkpoints, Braniff 
said, although the idea originated in the U.S. attorney's office in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
In court papers, federal prosecutors had argued that the increasing amounts of 
drugs entering via the U.S.-Mexico border required the dual-purpose role at the 
checkpoints, which were set up exclusively for immigration-related 
investigations. A 1976 Supreme Court ruling, U.S. vs. Martinez-Fuerte, upheld 
checkpoint stops of motorists for brief questioning regarding immigration 
status. 
</P>
<P>
But the high court ruling made no mention of drug investigations. In the 
current case, the government had sought to extend the Supreme Court's rationale 
to the narcotics arena, thereby enabling checkpoint agents to conduct narcotics 
stops without the "founded suspicion" of a violation that is now required. 
</P>
<P>
"The problems associated with alien smuggling are clearly no more important 
than the scourge of drugs," Assistant U.S. Atty. Patrick K. O'Toole argued in 
court papers. 
</P>
<P>
As part of their application, federal prosecutors submitted statistics 
demonstrating what they characterized as the soaring volume of drug trafficking 
along the almost 2,000-mile-long U.S.-Mexico border, which has long been a 
smuggling corridor. Border seizures of cocaine increased from fewer than 60 
kilograms in fiscal 1982 to almost 12,000 kilograms in fiscal 1989, while 
seizures of marijuana rose from about 27,000 kilograms to almost 200,000 
kilograms during the same period, according to government figures filed in 
connection with the case. 
</P>
<P>
But Judge Irving rejected the government's argument, noting that the 1976 
Supreme Court ruling permitted only immigration stops. Accepting the 
government's argument, the judge said, would come "uncomfortably close" to 
rejecting the Supreme Court's ruling in a Prohibition-era case, Carroll vs. 
U.S. (1924). In that instance, Irving noted, the court ruled that law 
enforcement officers needed some form of "probable cause" before stopping a 
vehicle, questioning its occupants and searching it for contraband. The 
"probable cause" threshold has since been upheld by numerous court rulings, and 
has become a bedrock principle in U.S. law enforcement to protect innocent 
citizens from harassment by police agencies.

NOT-GUILTY PLEA ENTERED IN SLAYING OF DRIVER AFTER TRAFFIC DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Howard F. Barton Jr. pleaded not guilty Friday to a charge that he murdered 
Marco Sanchez on Feb. 22. after a traffic dispute involving Sanchez and 
Barton's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Barton, a Pacific Beach real estate broker and a La Jolla resident, said, "That 
is absolutely correct," when Superior Court Judge Jesus Rodriguez asked him if 
he had entered a not-guilty plea. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez set Barton's trial for Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, Rodriguez denied a motion by defense attorney Clyde 
Munsell to release Barton on bail. Barton's $500,000 bail was revoked May 14 by 
Municipal Judge Rafael Arreola after a preliminary hearing. At the end of the 
hearing, Arreola called Barton a danger to the public, ordered him to stand 
trial on the murder charge and revoked his bail. Barton has been in County Jail 
downtown ever since. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Munsell asked Rodriguez to authorize an evidentiary hearing so 
Munsell could argue again that Barton had a right to be freed on bail while 
awaiting trial. Rodriguez refused and advised Munsell to appeal to the 4th 
District Court of Appeal if he believes Barton should be released on bail.

HEARING RENEWS CALL TO SHUT LOPEZ DUMP; 
</P>
<P>
AIR QUALITY: AREA RESIDENTS TESTIFY THAT THEY SUFFER HEALTH PROBLEMS CAUSED BY 
TOXIC GAS EMISSIONS FROM THE LANDFILL. 
</P>

<P>
Lake View Terrace and Kagel Canyon residents told air quality officials Friday 
that foul odors from the Lopez Canyon Landfill have become worse and more 
frequent in the last six months and once again called for the dump to be shut 
down. 
</P>
<P>
Several residents also told the South Coast Air Quality Management District 
hearing board that they or their children have suffered health problems they 
believe were caused by toxic gas emissions from the dump. 
</P>
<P>
"I am so angry," said Kagel Canyon resident Ellen Shaheen. "Daily, I smell the 
odors and they're getting worse. My son has sneezing fits." 
</P>
<P>
Several participants said the dump would not remain open if it were located in 
a more affluent neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Residents said that odors were particularly strong Wednesday night, when the 
AQMD issued a citation to the city for causing a public nuisance, the second 
citation since March. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past six months, the odor has gotten worse and worse," said Kagel 
Canyon resident Neal Morris. "I've felt it going into my lungs." 
</P>
<P>
Friday's hearing at Dexter Park in Kagel Canyon was the third time this month 
that members of the AQMD board have traveled to northeast San Fernando Valley 
to take public testimony on toxic gas emissions at the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Residents and elected officials representing the area have charged that the 
city of Los Angeles, which owns the landfill, is violating state laws on 
methane gas emissions. They have asked the board to close the dump until gases 
are controlled. 
</P>
<P>
City Bureau of Sanitation officials have admitted that gas emissions at the 
dump violate state law, but said they will be in "substantial compliance" with 
the law by Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing board, a quasi-judicial panel, will continue taking testimony at 
the AQMD headquarters in El Monte on June 8. They are scheduled to hear a 
doctor who treated an 11-year-old girl who became sick after she inhaled gas 
from the dump. Deputy City Atty. Christopher Westhoff, representing the Bureau 
of Sanitation, said he will present his own health experts then. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 residents attended some part of Friday's six-hour hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Kagel Canyon resident Mary Shannon held up a large picture of her sons, ages 2 
and 4, as she urged the hearing board to shut the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
"The dump must be closed in order for the city to take my children's health 
seriously," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Zapple of Kagel Canyon said her pediatrician has told her that 
long-term exposure to gases from the dump could be harmful to her two small 
children. She is pregnant with her third child. 
</P>
<P>
Lake View Terrace resident Patricia Rivera said her year-old daughter became 
ill and was diagnosed as having a bacterial infection in her bloodstream caused 
by "something airborne" after walking outside near her home. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to calling for the board to close the landfill, Anson Burlingame of 
nearby Shadow Hills asked that a planned expansion of the dump be halted until 
gas emissions are brought under control. 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, J. Malcolm Toy, the city's principal sanitary engineer, said 
the city will have spent $2.7 million to install a gas collection system to 
control the problem. He said 48 wells to control emissions have been installed 
and that 200 more are planned. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll do whatever it takes," he said.

AL MARTINEZ: DOWN THE ROAD APIECE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I stopped by Edward's Steak House the other day to say goodby. 
</P>
<P>
I hadn't been there for years, but it looked pretty much the same. Sawdust on 
the floor, glowing Tiffany lamps, a wooden Indian by the door, family pictures 
on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
George Escobar was behind the bar as always, pouring one hell of a drink, and 
Jeannie Jackson was bustling about, waiting on tables. 
</P>
<P>
I talked to Ken Rausch, whose father opened the place 44 years ago and whose 
announcement to sell the building has left a lot of old-timers in a state of 
shock. 
</P>
<P>
When a deal is made, the restaurant closes. 
</P>
<P>
Drug dealers, gang members, addicts, whores, pimps and pan-handlers in nearby 
MacArthur Park have driven them out of business, the Rausches say. 
</P>
<P>
They can't risk the lives of their customers and their employees by remaining 
open in an area, as one former customer put it, that has become a human sewer. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone is telling the Rausches to hang on, that things are going to get 
better somewhere down the road, but Ken Rausch says the decision to sell is 
irrevocable. 
</P>
<P>
There were tears at the announcement. Ed Rausch's hand shook and his voice 
trembled. City Councilwoman Gloria Molina almost wailed in official regret. 
Cameras rolled. Strobes flashed. 
</P>
<P>
Even Jane Pauley, America's electronic sweetheart, is doing a segment on the 
end of the Edward's Era. How big can a closing get? 
</P>
<P>
I met with Ken not to add to the lachrymose nature of the Great Passing, but to 
take a look at what happens when crime clashes with commerce. 
</P>
<P>
There's personal nostalgia involved here too. I used to eat at Edward's once in 
awhile with my old pal John St. John, the LAPD's "Jigsaw John," when I was 
writing a book and a television movie about him. 
</P>
<P>
We'd go there and to Little Joe's on upper Broadway and the Red Dog Saloon on 
2nd Street. John and the other homicide cops stopped going to Edward's, Ken 
says, when the neighborhood started going downhill. 
</P>
<P>
Just because they're homicide cops doesn't mean they want to eat and drink at a 
place surrounded by potential killers and, as John used to say, killees. The 
restaurant sits in the middle of a neighborhood that has the worse crime rate 
in the city. 
</P>
<P>
A police captain tells me that they've been putting heavy pressure on drug 
trafficking in MacArthur Park. Five years down the road, he says, the place 
will be what it was 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
There's that phrase again. Down the road. We'll get to heaven bye and bye. 
</P>
<P>
That's not good enough, Ken Rausch says. 
</P>
<P>
When cops shut down the park at 10:30 every night, dealers, addicts, gang 
bangers, hookers and homeless people hang out in the alley and the parking lot 
behind his restaurant, where the main entrance is. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past three years," he says, "the place has gotten dangerous. My sister 
comes here in the morning and is afraid to get out of her car. I leave at night 
and see prostitutes doing their business in the alley." 
</P>
<P>
The kinds of homeless who haunt those back streets aren't gentle, either. Not 
like the old guy who digs lettuce leaves out of the trash bins every day to 
feed the ducks. 
</P>
<P>
We're talking about the guys who pounded on a terrified waitress' car and 
urinated against its doors a couple of Sundays ago when she was driving out of 
the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"How long will it be," Rausch asks, "before someone gets killed?" 
</P>
<P>
I hadn't realized how bad MacArthur Park had gotten until I went out there to 
look around. The south side section especially has gone to hell. It even smells 
rotten. 
</P>
<P>
Forget there are portable toilets everywhere. A lot of guys prefer the bushes 
or the lawn or sometimes the lake. Hell, it doesn't matter who's looking. 
</P>
<P>
Crudity prevails in dark kingdoms. 
</P>
<P>
Drunks, junkies and crazies sprawl across pathways and park benches like 
garbage in a flower bed. It's hard to tell sometimes whether they're asleep, 
comatose or dead, but at least when they're out they aren't hassling anyone. 
</P>
<P>
A few of the families who used to come here are still trying to make the park 
what a park ought to be, a place to play and rest and picnic, but I can't see a 
heaven on Earth in the near future, not down the road I'm looking. 
</P>
<P>
So Edward's is closing. Say your sad goodbys. Crime met commerce along Alvarado 
Street, and crime won. 
</P>
<P>
But it'll be different when Metro Rail comes, they say. It'll be different when 
the skyscrapers and the condos march west down Wilshire like towers of a 
tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Rausch shakes his head. "I'm sorry," he said, "but we just can't wait for 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Down the road is just too far, and the road is getting tougher all the time.

DROWN'S FINANCES FAR OUTPACE RIVALS' IN SHERIFF'S RACE; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: DISCLOSURE REPORTS ALSO SHOW CHACON AND BALLESTEROS NEARLY EVEN IN 
79TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT SPENDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego County sheriff candidate Jack Drown has received nearly as much in 
campaign contributions as the combined total of his four competitors, and a 
state assemblyman facing the toughest campaign of his political career is being 
closely matched in fund-raising by his major opponent, finance reports showed 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Drown, an assistant sheriff who has been endorsed by retiring Sheriff John 
Duffy, has raised $87,651, more than twice as much as any of his opponents and 
only about $10,000 less than the four other candidates' overall fund-raising 
total. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the county's most competitive state legislative contests, Assemblyman 
Pete Chacon (D-San Diego) has out-raised former Democratic San Diego City 
Councilwoman Celia Ballesteros by a relatively slim margin in the 79th District 
contest, $128,128 to $117,084. 
</P>
<P>
Another state legislative incumbent facing a stiff challenge in the June 5 
primary, Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier (R-Encinitas) has outspent her major GOP 
opponent, former Del Mar Mayor Ronnie Delaney, by a more than 2-1 margin -- a 
gap that Delaney has attempted to close by loaning more than $35,000 to her own 
75th District campaign. 
</P>
<P>
And in the county's most expensive state legislative campaign -- the special 
runoff for state Sen. Lucy Killea's former 78th Assembly District seat -- 
former Democratic San Diego City Councilman Mike Gotch has out-raised his 
Republican opponent, one-time City Hall aide Jeff Marston, $229,151 to 
$195,422. 
</P>
<P>
Among the competitive elections on the June 5 ballot, one of the greatest 
financial disparities among candidates in a single race is found in the contest 
to succeed Duffy, who late last year announced plans to end his 20-year career 
as sheriff by stepping down next January. 
</P>
<P>
Drown, one of the Sheriff's Department's three assistant sheriffs and the 
candidate whom Duffy would prefer to see succeed him, has easily outdistanced 
the rest of the field in fund raising, as underlined by the fact that his 
$87,651 total is more than double the $38,363 treasury of his nearest 
competitor, Escondido Police Chief Vince Jimno. 
</P>
<P>
Two other major candidates in the sheriff's contest, sheriff's captain and San 
Diego school board member Jim Roache and former San Diego Police Chief Ray 
Hoobler, have raised $27,273 and $26,675, respectively. Jim Messenger, a senior 
Carlsbad police officer who is widely regarded as a long shot, had raised only 
$5,928 as of May 19, the finance reports show. 
</P>
<P>
In the state legislative contests, Chacon, who has been buffeted by questions 
over his ethics and overall effectiveness in his campaign for an 11th two-year 
term, overcame Ballesteros' early fund-raising lead -- as of March 17, she had 
out-raised the incumbent by about $14,000 -- to gain about a $12,000 edge 
himself as their increasingly acrimonious campaign enters the final week and a 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Since March 18, Chacon has raised $100,578, contrasted with Ballesteros' 
$74,525 total. A third candidate in the 79th District Democratic primary, 
newspaper editor John Warren, has raised and spent only $4,755. 
</P>
<P>
In the 75th District contest, Mojonnier, who is running for a fifth term, has 
raised $92,747 -- a total that would give her a wide edge over Delaney were it 
not for Delaney's increasing reliance on her own personal funds to underwrite 
her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Although Delaney has received only slightly more than half as much as Mojonnier 
in contributions -- $48,480 -- she has been able to keep financial pace with 
the incumbent by loaning herself $35,500, including a $25,000 loan made 
Thursday. As of May 19, Mojonnier had spent $96,854, more than double Delaney's 
$45,359 total. 
</P>
<P>
The two other candidates in the 75th District Republican primary, La Jolla 
businesswoman Fay McGrath and Poway school board member Stan Rodkin, lag far 
behind the two front-runners in contributions. McGrath's contributions total 
$18,401, with nearly two-thirds of that -- $11,500 -- her own money, while 
Rodkin has raised only $5,488. 
</P>
<P>
In the county's costliest state legislative race, the final price tag in the 
special race for the 78th Assembly District vacancy created by Democrat 
Killea's election to the state Senate last December is likely to easily top the 
half-million-dollar mark, with both finalists receiving tens of thousands of 
dollars from political action committees. 
</P>
<P>
In the past week alone, both Democrat Gotch and Republican Marston have 
received more than $40,000 each, with much of that coming from their respective 
state parties, both of which recognize the rare political opportunity and 
challenge posed by an open seat in a district that is among the most 
competitively balanced in the state. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of Gotch's $229,151 in contributions have come from political 
action committees, which have donated more than $118,000 to his campaign since 
March 18. The vast majority of those PAC contributions came from labor unions 
and Democratic Party organizations. 
</P>
<P>
An equally large percentage of Marston's $195,422 contribution total has come 
from PACs over the past two months, with the Republican receiving about 
$126,000 in such donations, primarily from business and GOP groups. 
</P>
<P>
In two other state Assembly races in which incumbents face credible 
challengers, both Republican Tricia Hunter and Democrat Steve Peace have 
heavily out-raised their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
In the 76th District, Hunter, a Bonita nurse, has raised $135,296, contrasted 
with the $33,530 total of her GOP primary opponent, anti-abortion activist 
Connie Youngkin. 
</P>
<P>
Peace has received contributions totaling $76,541 in his 80th District race, 
four times more than lawyer Robert Garcia, who has raised $17,074. The finance 
report of Peace's other challenger in next month's Democratic primary, lawyer 
Darrel Vandeveld, had not been received by the county registrar of voters' 
office as of Friday's deadline.

THE $64-MILLION TRUMP QUESTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles badly needs another high school in the Mid-Wilshire area to relieve 
the overcrowding that requires thousands of youngsters to spend up to three 
hours a day on a bus going to schools in outlying areas. But the old Ambassador 
Hotel is simply not the best site for a new campus. 
</P>
<P>
The state Allocation Board on Wednesday gave the nod to plans by the Los 
Angeles Unified School District to build on the grounds of the old hotel and 
provided $50 million to pay for a large chunk of the 23.5-acre site. That's 
just one victory, however. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Trump paid $64 million for the site last year. No one should be 
surprised, given his reputation as an aggressive entrepreneur and unyielding 
deal-maker, that his aide would predict the ultimate property cost to go as 
high as $150 million. Trump isn't likely to roll over and make a sweet deal 
with the school district, even on behalf of children sorely in need. 
</P>
<P>
The expected legal battles are likely to cost millions -- money that could be 
much better spent by the financially strapped district. School Board President 
Jackie Goldberg has declared confidently that the board could proceed and even 
finish the school before the litigation is resolved. But given the resources of 
the Trump forces, how much of Goldberg's prediction is realistic -- and how 
much of it is based on a stubborn glee for temporarily besting Trump? Sure, it 
feels good, but is a protracted court fight with Trump in the best interests of 
schoolchildren? 
</P>
<P>
The board has proposed putting stores near the school on the old hotel site to 
help offset expenses. A similar creative mix -- commercial use and a campus -- 
works in other cities. The concept is certainly worth exploring here, but not 
on this high-priced site. 
</P>
<P>
Homes are also at the heart of the district's dilemma. The board is reluctant 
to condemn housing if vacant land is available. That is an admirable and 
compassionate position given the scarcity of affordable housing around town. 
But, really, how available is the Ambassador site? 
</P>
<P>
It's true that other sites would require the district to take modest houses, 
low-rent apartments and commercial buildings as well as face fierce community 
opposition. The competing needs -- homes versus a school -- force a very tough 
choice. But the district's climbing enrollment requires the board to balance 
the needs of a few families against the needs of thousands of families with 
children in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School District spends more than $6 million a year to 
bus 4,500 high-school students from the crowded neighborhoods served by Los 
Angeles High and Belmont High. Those youngsters, and their younger brothers and 
sisters, must not wait years for a new school -- and much of that time on a 
freeway.

BUSH'S PLAN FOR VOYAGE TO MARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Has that man in The White House lost his marbles? Is he totally out of control? 
With the drug situation, and the uncounted homeless in this country without 
shelter, George Bush is talking about spending billions of dollars on a space 
program to plant the American flag on Mars on July 20, 2019 (Part A, May 12). 
</P>
<P>
I don't believe what I'm hearing! The students at his commencement address at 
the Texas A&amp;I University in Kingsville, Texas, must have been more aware of 
the deplorable conditions of the world than a President who can so blithely 
ignore reality and discuss the spending of those billions of dollars on the 
improbable. President Bush is too much out in space and needs to come back to 
Earth and to reality.

WOUNDS TOO DEEP FOR A SIMPLE APOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has been 80 years since Japan formally annexed Korea, 45 years since defeat 
in World War II brought its harsh rule to an end. But older Koreans have not 
forgotten, and younger Koreans have been taught from birth to remember the 
oppression and humiliations of the colonial period, a final if unintended 
consequence of which was to leave Korea divided between two bitterly 
antagonistic states. Not until 1965 did South Korea establish full diplomatic 
relations with Japan. And not until this week did the Seoul government at last 
win from Tokyo something close to the apology it has long sought for what 
Koreans in the first half of this century were forced to endure. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's military takeover of the Korean peninsula in fact began as early as 
1904, at the onset of the Russo-Japanese war. The colonization that followed 
aimed at much more than economic exploitation. It included a systematic effort 
to denigrate and even eradicate much of Korean culture. South Korea's President 
Roh Tae Woo, addressing the Diet in Tokyo on Friday, recalled how Korean 
schoolchildren would be severely punished by their teachers if they were heard 
speaking Korean instead of Japanese, or even if they used their given Korean 
names rather than the Japanese names that authorities insisted they must have. 
Hundreds of thousands of Koreans were transported to Japan to serve as slave 
laborers. About 700,000 ethnic Koreans remain there today, an unassimilated 
minority discriminated against both socially and by law. 
</P>
<P>
Japan, as recurrent controversies over the accuracy of its history textbooks 
show, remains reluctant to dwell on or even fully to acknowledge the aggressive 
policies it pursued before and during World War II. Six years ago another South 
Korean president sought an official expression of contrition in Tokyo. At that 
time, the late Emperor Hirohito would only refer to the "regrettable" and 
"unfortunate" past that had existed between the two countries. This week, his 
son, Emperor Akihito, was somewhat more forthcoming, expressing "deepest 
regret" for the "sufferings . . . brought about by my country." Even stronger 
expressions of remorse and apology were delivered by Japanese political 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Will all this, as Roh asked Japan's Parliament, "break off the shackles of the 
past and clean up negative residues of what went on in bygone days"? Certainly 
that is the hope. But memories of the past are likely to intrude as the two 
countries address tough issues of the present, notably Korean complaints about 
unfair Japanese trading practices and about the treatment of Koreans resident 
in Japan. Geographically, Koreans and Japanese are close neighbors. 
Emotionally, the distance between them may still be considerable.

PARKING TICKET REVENUE IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am angered to read that the mayor is upset with the traffic officers wherein 
he contends that they are not writing enough tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Although the annual revenue has increased from $18 million in 1985 to $90 
million last year, this just isn't good enough, according to our esteemed 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
It is reprehensible to think that the mayor of this city is angry because more 
citizens are obeying the law! 
</P>
<P>
But then again it really isn't surprising that this muddle-headed man who has 
lived for so long under a cloud of murky and nefarious transactions would think 
in a more positive vein than having to enrich the city coffers through such 
punitive means. 
</P>
<P>
Come on, it's time to pat him on the head with two lumps of sugar, and put him 
out to pasture.

PARKING TICKET REVENUE IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the bargaining representative for the city's 572 traffic officers, we are 
deeply concerned with Mayor Tom Bradley's suggestion that the traffic officers 
have somehow been derelict in their duties ("Officers Cited for Too Few Parking 
Tickets," Metro, May 15). Traffic officers are hard-working, conscientious city 
employees who are under increasing pressure to write tickets in an effort to 
balance the city's budget. 
</P>
<P>
Because traffic officers have made a stand and refused to write questionable 
tickets, Bradley is threatening to reward them for their honesty by eliminating 
their jobs. While the mayor says he will not tolerate ticket quotas, he also 
says that traffic officers aren't writing enough tickets and that the city 
should consider hiring a private firm to perform that service. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Bureau of Transportation's annual report for fiscal year 
1988-89, traffic officers issued 4,383,076 citations, compared to 3,460,713 
tickets during the previous fiscal year, a 21% increase. Yet, Mayor Bradley 
says this is not enough. The mayor also says that traffic officers issue an 
average of 39 citations per day and that is too low. 
</P>
<P>
In arriving at this figure, the mayor and the city administrative officer have 
lumped all traffic officers together and treated them as if the only job duties 
are to write tickets and produce revenue for the city. Such is not the case. 
Traffic officers perform a wide array of duties. In addition to writing 
tickets, they impound vehicles, respond to radio calls, handle abandoned 
vehicles, work on the booting detail and handle intersection control. When one 
factors out the time spent on these important and essential non-ticket writing 
duties performed by the officers, the average number of citations written is 71 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
We are also concerned that Mayor Bradley would even consider hiring a private 
firm to handle ticket writing when the only portion of the department's 
operation that is currently handled by a private contractor is also the only 
part of the operation that has failed to fulfill its mission. With more than 
$250 million in uncollected parking fines, the city is hard-pressed to call 
this part of the program a success. 
</P>
<P>
We do not believe the mayor should retaliate against traffic officers because 
the city is faced with a fiscal crisis and needs someone to blame.

So much talent. So much creativity. So much energy. So much love of life. Sammy 
Davis Jr. and Jim Henson will indeed be missed.

Sammy and Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog are as much American institutions as

It was in 1967 when Sammy shook hands with my heart. 
</P>
<P>
My husband Ed and I were visiting Jerry Lewis, the fine comedian, as he was 
making a movie at the Shepperton Studios just outside of London. Jerry was busy 
-- so he told us to go to the commissary on our own. 
</P>
<P>
Sammy was there making a movie too -- and noticing that we were strangers, came 
to our table, welcomed us as he introduced himself, and as he shook our hands, 
said, "We were strangers no more." Shalom, Sammy -- you'll make friends 
wherever you are. We'll miss you, we'll miss you.

Sammy Davis and Jim Henson, I will miss you. I find it very difficult to think 
of a world without Davis and Henson -- two great men whose talent and 
imagination gave so much to all of us. 
</P>
<P>
I remember the first time I saw Davis in person. It was many years ago, but I 
was so impressed with how such a big voice could come out of such a little man. 
Many years later I thought he was wonderful in "Tap," even though the critics 
didn't like the movie much. In many ways, he left some "big" shoes to fill. 
</P>
<P>
"Sesame Street" and "The Muppet Show" were special favorites of my son when he 
was little. Kermit, Miss Piggy, Big Bird, and Oscar brought smiles and laughter 
into my home every day when we really needed it. His creative genius will be 
sorely missed. 
</P>
<P>
Heaven must be a happy place with Davis and Henson there, singing, dancing and 
having lots of fun. Kind of gives us all something to look forward to!

PARKING TICKET REVENUE IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have a new proposal and idea for the parking tickets mess -- from the matter 
of unpaid tickets to the ruthless enforcement of such violations -- on which 
local cities depend for revenue. 
</P>
<P>
I call it parking ticket prepayments. 
</P>
<P>
I propose a prepayment by drivers of a sum of let's say $25 per year for any 
possible violation; such drivers would be entitled to two parking violations 
without having to appear in court. 
</P>
<P>
Why not computerize such pre-payers according to their car license numbers, and 
when a parking violation occurs such car owners would be notified that a ticket 
was charged to their account. 
</P>
<P>
And why not provide such pre-payers with a sticker, so that the parking ticket 
enforcers would be cognizant of the pre-payer who would be given only an 
account notice. 
</P>
<P>
The point is that cities or counties would immediately reap income of millions 
in prepaid revenue, and would be able to hire parking attendants and handle the 
entire matter of such violations in a civilized and businesslike manner.

CEREMONY CAPS DAY FOR GRADUATES OF CSUN; 
</P>
<P>
COMMENCEMENT: AN ESTIMATED 27,000 PEOPLE WITNESSED THE PARADE OF STUDENTS WHOSE 
HEADGEAR INCLUDED MORTARBOARDS, FLOPPY DISCS AND HARD HATS.

From the computer floppy discs taped to their black hats to the flower leis 
around their necks, from the confetti in their hands to the beach balls under 
their black robes, there was no mistaking them for anything else. 
</P>
<P>
They were graduates. 
</P>
<P>
A record crowd at the North Campus stadium -- an estimated 27,000 people -- 
attended the Cal State Northridge graduation Friday morning, filling 
surrounding streets and sidewalks with cars and pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
But police reported no major traffic problems, unlike at the 1989 graduation, 
which was moved off campus to the Hollywood Bowl, causing a three-hour traffic 
jam that left even university President James W. Cleary late for the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
This year there were 3,800 graduating seniors -- 20% of them in business 
administration -- and 600 master's degree recipients, campus spokeswoman Ann 
Salisbury said. 
</P>
<P>
As always, headgear was diverse. Engineers wore hard hats, fraternity brothers 
and sorority sisters wore their letters on their mortarboards, a computer 
science major wore a stack of floppy discs topped by a cat face. 
</P>
<P>
While students' black garb soaked up the hot spring sun, Cleary -- the keynote 
speaker -- extended thanks to the faculty, students' friends and families and 
the graduates themselves. He received loud applause when he spoke of the 
students' shared experiences, including "financial crisis."

<P>
When will the papers start printing something about the 98% of the people in 
the Valley who don't try to cause trouble. 
</P>
<P>
I'd like to see the papers ask people what types of things they'd like to see 
in the future. Porter Ranch is an example. 
</P>
<P>
With a new mall planned for that area, why don't the papers ask what kind of 
stores we shoppers would like to have? Or how about asking businesses if they 
would be interested in locating there? 
</P>
<P>
I will put my vote in now for Porter Ranch to have a Nordstrom so I won't have 
to drive so far to shop there.

ELSMERE DUMP 'MISGUIDED'

Are the people of Los Angeles willing to get ripped off, to the tune of $125 
million paid to the owner of BKK landfills at taxpayers' expense, and at the 
same time very likely pollute our air and water with methane gas and toxic 
chemicals? Isn't water much too precious an item to be tampered with, 
particularly during this terrible drought? 
</P>
<P>
We must speak out against the misguided construction of a landfill at Elsmere 
Canyon and the expansion of existing landfills.

The only safe and economically sound solution to our waste problem is to 
recycle, now!

LAUDING THE LITTER CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In newspapers and on television we are hearing about the wonderful things 
elementary schools are doing to improve our environment. What about the high 
schools? My school, Calabasas High, is making a great effort to clean up our 
school and environment. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned students have started the Litter Club, which club has placed yellow 
receptacles all over campus for aluminum cans. The public may bring cans to our 
new recycling bin at the end of the ramp leading to the football field. Members 
of the club are also planting trees on campus and in the Santa Monica 
Mountains. Our Associated Student Body has canceled a car-washing fund-raiser 
to conserve water. 
</P>
<P>
When standing in line at the cafeteria window, I am hearing more and more 
people ask for soda in a can instead of a Styrofoam cup. Eating areas are 
becoming much cleaner because students are remembering to pick up their trash. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to congratulate the Litter Club and all the people who have done 
anything that can lead to a safer place to live.

TO SILVER'S DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To label Gerald A. Silver, president of Homeowners of Encino, a "slow-growth 
gadfly" (L.A. Times, May 10) is to trivialize a person that many of us would 
call a civic hero. That pejorative reference reveals your reporter's ignorance 
of Silver's tireless and unpaid efforts over some 20 years fighting some of the 
most pressing battles facing the San Fernando Valley -- airport noise, 
irresponsible development and sewer pollution, just to mention a few. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Silver, perhaps a "Don Quixote" at worst, is laboring on his own time 
and expense to accomplish what we pay city employees to do full time -- to make 
this a more livable city. Los Angeles needs more Gerald Silvers, whatever his 
label.

WESTERN CONFERENCE: AFTER WASTING 22-POINT LEAD IN GAME 2 LOSS AT PORTLAND, 
THEY TAKE A 46-POINT LEAD AND CRUISE AT PHOENIX, 123-89.

<TEXT>
<P>
It would not happen again, or so the Phoenix Suns hoped. Another 22-point lead 
against the Portland Trail Blazers, this time by the end of the first quarter 
here Friday night, would not be lost. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out they didn't have to hold that lead. 
</P>
<P>
No, it grew to 28 by halftime, then 30, then 40 before finally hitting a high 
mark of 46 points late in the third quarter of a 123-89 victory over the Trail 
Blazers in Game 3 of the Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
Two days ago, the concern was whether the Suns could recover after wasting a 
22-point lead and losing Game 2 in Portland. Now, the question is whether the 
Trail Blazers will be the demoralized team. 
</P>
<P>
Portland leads the series, two games to one, with Game 4 here Sunday. But the 
Suns may be in control. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knew what happened the other night," Sun guard Jeff Hornacek said. 
"That was a good lesson for us never, never to let up. But that happens to 
teams in the playoffs. You lose leads." 
</P>
<P>
This blowout, which must have reminded Trail Blazer forward Buck Williams of 
his days as a New Jersey Net, was not a record. But only because Sun Coach 
Cotton Fitzsimmons cleared the bench in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix, which made 61% of its shots, fell short of a franchise playoff record 
for margin of victory. The Suns beat the Golden State Warriors by 37 points 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns' starters made a combined 35 of 42 shots (83.3%). Tom Chambers had 24 
points, guards Hornacek and Kevin Johnson had 17 each and power forward Kurt 
Rambis got 14 on six-for-six shooting. Center Mark West scored eight of his 
nine points in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to play every single quarter like it was 0-0," Kevin Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzsimmons was asked if he had ever seen his starters make 83% of their shots 
in a game before. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably have been involved in a game like that, but it had to be in junior 
college where nobody ever plays defense," Fitzsimmons said. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzsimmons wanted it known he was not comparing the Trail Blazers to a junior 
college team or knocking Portland's defensive effort. 
</P>
<P>
But the Trail Blazers knocked themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"We just played horribly," said Clyde Drexler, who made only five of 14 shots. 
"We know we're a better team than that." 
</P>
<P>
But, on the road in their last two playoff series, the Trail Blazers have 
resembled the Sacramento Kings in February, folding at the first hint of a 
deficit. In their last four road playoff games, the Trail Blazers have lost by 
an average of 20.4 points. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't play well offensively -- that was our biggest breakdown," said Trail 
Blazer guard Terry Porter, who made two of eight shots and had six points. 
</P>
<P>
"Our offense made their offense look great because we missed so many shots we 
got their break going." 
</P>
<P>
The Suns took a we-told-you-so attitude about not letting down after Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
"You hear all kinds of things after our game up there," Hornacek said of Game 
2. 
</P>
<P>
"People said we were doubting ourselves. But, as players, you just go out and 
play the game. You don't worry about the last one." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Suns made strategic adjustments. Fitzsimmons said the key was a 
multifaceted offense. 
</P>
<P>
That was evident in the first four minutes, when the Suns took an 18-4 lead. 
West scored inside, Chambers made a jump shot, Kevin Johnson made free throws 
after driving, Rambis scored inside and Chambers scored twice off fast breaks. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we had them both games up there," said Chambers, who made 11 of 13 
shots in only 26 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"But we allowed them to come back. Tonight, we did not allow that." 
</P>
<P>
Just as Fitzsimmons scoffed at the notion his Suns would fold after the Game 2 
loss, Portland Coach Rick Adelman vowed his team would not wilt, despite making 
36.3% of their shots and playing only token defense. 
</P>
<P>
"They dominated the game in every way," Adelman said. "But I don't care how 
many points you get beat by. The series is still 2-1, with us ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Friday, that was the only statistic the Trail Blazers could embrace. 
</P>
<P>
Western Conference Notes 
</P>
<P>
Sun guard Eddie Johnson has renewed his vow of silence for the third 
consecutive playoff series. But Johnson has done so much explaining about why 
he is not talking with the media it might be easier for him to answer 
questions. "You guys are going to write whatever you're going to anyway, 
whether I talk or not," Johnson told reporters. "I have my job to do. I need to 
concentrate." . . . Before Friday night's game, Sun forward Tom Chambers had an 
0-10 record in Western Conference finals. Chambers was a member of the 1986-87 
Seattle SuperSonics that lost four consecutive games to the Lakers. He was with 
the Suns last season, when they lost four in a row to the Lakers. And the Suns 
lost the first two games of this series.

MARTINEZ'S LIGHTNING TOO MUCH; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: PITCHER STRIKES OUT EIGHT CARDINALS IN 4-1 FIVE-HIT VICTORY THAT ENDS 
IN AN ELECTRICAL STORM. THE DODGERS WIN FOR EIGHTH TIME IN 11 GAMES.

<TEXT>
<P>
It was difficult to determine which was the more intimidating Friday night -- 
the electrical storm or the skinny Dodger pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Most everybody at Busch Stadium had seen lightning. But none of them had ever 
seen Ramon Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
With flashing bolts crossing the sky above him for the final two innings, 
Martinez finished off a five-hitter and beat the St. Louis Cardinals, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
He struck out eight and all of the Cardinal hits were singles. 
</P>
<P>
"That lightning scared the hell out of me," said Juan Samuel, who hit a two-run 
homer. 
</P>
<P>
Added Jose Gonzalez, who tripled and scored a run: "Standing in center field, 
that lightning made me feel like a trapped rat." 
</P>
<P>
But Martinez, who leads the major leagues with 65 strikeouts, smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not worry about the lightning," he said. "I see it hit the street near my 
house in the Dominican (Republic) once, and it blew everything up. I'm used to 
the lightning." 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals entered the game as the only National League team that Martinez 
had yet to face. His first impressions were lasting. 
</P>
<P>
"He is everything everybody said," Cardinal shortstop Ozzie Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Whitey Herzog said, "We took a lot of funny looking swings." 
</P>
<P>
Because Martinez and catcher Mike Scioscia worked so well complementing 
Martinez's changeup with his 90 m.p.h.-plus fastball, all eight strikeouts were 
swinging. Before Martinez grew weary in the ninth inning, allowing his only run 
on a two-out single by Pedro Guerrero, only six of the Cardinals' 24 outs were 
on fly balls. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers won for the eighth time in 11 games, improving this trip record to 
3-0. 
</P>
<P>
"You could tell a lot of them were up there guessing for one pitch and getting 
another," said Mickey Hatcher, who added two hits and a run. "There were a lot 
of ugly swings, which can happen when Ramon is on." 
</P>
<P>
He has been on for three consecutive games, during which he is 3-0 with a 1.96 
earned-run average. But in the two games before the start of this streak, both 
losses, he allowed 11 runs in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
Having learned not to get too happy with his successes to avoid being 
heartbroken five days later, the Dodgers are thrilled that he is 5-2 with a 
3.57 ERA. And they are keeping their fingers crossed. 
</P>
<P>
"His mechanics are not ironed out like they should be, but, shortly, he will be 
a complete major league pitcher," Scioscia said. "With more and more 
experience, he will be more refined." 
</P>
<P>
Before 36,2643, Gonzalez staked the Dodgers to a 1-0 lead in the first inning 
off Cardinal starter and loser Joe Magrane with a triple off the right-field 
wall and a dash home on a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel, batting sixth and acting more relaxed out of the leadoff spot, hit his 
second homer in two days in the seventh inning. It was a two-run shot to left 
field that followed Hatcher's single. 
</P>
<P>
The way Martinez reacted under pressure, those runs were all he needed. 
</P>
<P>
Witness his best inning, the sixth, when, with one out, Vince Coleman singled 
to center field. On Martinez's second pitch, Coleman stole his 21st base of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
But Martinez retired Ozzie Smith on a fly ball to shallow center field and, 
after Coleman took third on a wild pitch, Martinez struck out Willie McGee. 
</P>
<P>
"He had poise," said McGee, who entered the night as one of the league's 
leading hitters with a .327 average. "It looks like he's going to be a good one 
for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez shrugged. "If you feel pressure, you lose your concentration," he 
said. "In a big situation, when I need a big out, I just throw as hard as I 
can." 
</P>
<P>
Just as Samuel was swinging -- and running -- as hard as he could on his third 
homer of the season. He has been struggling so much at the plate, he was still 
running hard around second base when umpire Bill Hohn signaled that the ball 
had bounced off a facade beyond the left-field fence for a homer. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw it bounce and I thought it was a triple. Heck, I don't think about 
homer," said Samuel, who has five hits in his last nine at-bats to improve his 
average to .204. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson played all nine innings in his second rehabilitation start for 
triple-A Albuquerque Friday, but he was a designated hitter and did not test 
his legs in center field. He had two hits in three at-bats with a home run, a 
single and a walk in the Dukes' 10-5 win over Colorado Springs. . . . Kal 
Daniels left Friday's game after being hit in the back in the eighth inning 
with a pitch by Joe Magrane, but afterward he was fine. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Morgan rejoined the team Friday after spending the last week battling a 
virus. The only time he left his home during that period was to make his 
scheduled start Monday against the Mets, in which he allowed nine runs in 2 1/3 
innings in the Dodgers' 12-3 loss. "I was an idiot going out there, feeling as 
sick as I was," he said. "I didn't have my balance. I didn't have my strength. 
I know I would do it again, it's just the way I am -- but I don't know if they 
would let me do it again." Morgan said he will make his scheduled start 
tonight. . . . Another sick Dodger, John Wetteland, joined the team in St. 
Louis Friday even though he said doctors advised him to remain in Chicago and 
not attempt to pitch again until Monday in Pittsburgh. "I was feeling better, 
and I wanted to be with the team and get back on track," said Wetteland, who 
has had two starts affected by a chest virus this season. He is tentatively 
scheduled to start Sunday against Jose DeLeon. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Howell said that he was checked by a doctor in Chicago after removing 
himself from Wednesday's 4-3 victory over the Chicago Cubs after pitching 
two-thirds of an inning. "He said the shoulder was fine, it was just stiff," 
Howell said. "I've got to remember to take this comeback slowly." Howell has 
not felt good since pitching two innings last Saturday against Philadelphia, 
his second consecutive appearance after a 27-day absence because of 
arthroscopic knee surgery. . . . Eddie Murray's left hamstring was still sore 
Friday, causing him to be scratched from the starting lineup for a third 
consecutive game. The Dodgers won't know if he can start until checking with 
him each day after his pregame work. . . . Although sore-shouldered Jeff 
Hamilton has accompanied the team on the trip, he said he will probably not 
pick up a ball or bat until the end of next home stand, during the first week 
of June. Once he begins throwing, he said, he can return to the team within a 
couple of weeks. Because of the recent good play of Mike Sharperson and Lenny 
Harris, third baseman Hamilton could be the subject of upcoming trade talks. . 
. . Dodger coach Bill Russell visited a local hospital Friday because of 
prolonged dizziness. He was diagnosed as having an inner-ear infection and 
treated on an outpatient basis.

CLARK HIT BY BALL, HURT AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
PADRES: FREAK ACCIDENT BEFORE GAME LEAVES FIRST BASEMAN WITH FRACTURED 
CHEEKBONE AND AT LEAST A TWO-WEEK EXTENSION OF HIS TIME ON THE SIDELINES.

<TEXT>
<P>
Jack Clark, the Padre first baseman who was within days of coming off the 
disabled list, suffered a fractured left cheekbone Friday night in a freak 
accident and will be sidelined for at least another two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The injury was diagnosed as a fracture of the zygomatic arch, according to the 
New York Mets doctors, and Clark will undergo X-rays today to determine if 
there was any damage to his eye. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who has been on the disabled list retroactive to May 6 with an inflamed 
disc in his lower back, was hit in the left cheekbone about 30 minutes before 
the start of the game against the New York Mets. He had been running sprints 
just beyond the infield when Padre reliever Pat Clements threw a ball from the 
outfield toward second base. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I threw it, I started yelling," Clements said. "I threw it real 
high, but I could see he was running right underneath it. 
</P>
<P>
"I started screaming at the top of my lungs, but it was right when a plane went 
overhead. I don't know if someone 10 feet ahead of me could have heard me with 
that plane." 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, Friday was the first time Clark was able to run sprints and 
take live batting practice. In fact, he was so impressive swinging with just 
three-quarter power that Padre Manager Jack McKeon said he would likely be 
activated Monday in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
And then this happened. 
</P>
<P>
"I really feel bad about it," Clements said, "and I'll feel horrible if he's 
going to be out for a long time because of this." 
</P>
<P>
Said McKeon: "Sure, this hurts, but what are you going to do? We're going to 
have to bring him some body guards from now on." 
</P>
<P>
Since the day Clark changed his uniform number from 25 to 00, he played three 
innings May 5 before suffering the inflamed disc, pinched a nerve in his back 
while putting on his socks three days ago, and now this. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the number 00 was supposed to bring strength and power," Padre 
reliever Craig Lefferts said. "I wonder if he's thinking about changing back." 
</P>
<P>
Clark left the clubhouse before the end of the game and was unavailable for 
comment.

In your May 19 Newswire item on Roberto Baggio, the premier "centrocampisto" 
(midfielder) in Italian soccer, there were two inaccuracies. 
</P>
<P>
Juventus paid Fiorentina $20 million, not $16.5 million, for the rights to 
Baggio. And the item makes no mention of the fact that the night before the 
transfer was announced, Juventus and Fiorentina played to a scoreless tie, 
making Juventus the European champion. 
</P>
<P>
It is as if after the fourth game of last year's World Series, Will Clark 
announced he was moving from the Giants to the A's.

A veteran championship team hits an unfortunate slump in the early rounds of 
the playoffs and fails to make the finals for the first time in years. Fans 
wail, gnash their teeth and call for the coach's blood, ignoring an otherwise 
excellent season. 
</P>
<P>
Sportswriters insist major changes must be made, the team is clearly over the 
hill, and the young, victorious team is anointed as the new power in the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers of 1990, you say? Well, yes, but also the Lakers of 1986, after 
which the same over-the-hill veterans won back-to-back championships and would 
have had a third but for ill-timed injuries. Let's not panic, but thank the 
Lakers for a fine regular season, and in Dodger tradition, vow to "wait till 
next year."

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
TWINS MAKE UP FOR LOST NIGHTS, GET 19 HITS IN 16-0 ROUT OF RED SOX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After being on the wrong end of two blowouts earlier in the week, the Minnesota 
Twins had a better time Friday night at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Kirby Puckett drove in three runs and scored three times, and the Twins ended 
up with 19 hits in a 16-0 rout of the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
The Twins had been defeated Tuesday by Baltimore, 10-2, and Wednesday by New 
York, 12-0. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to have games when you get blown out," Puckett said. "We were two 
nights in a row. Now we're on the other side of the fence, and it was great for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Puckett was replaced in the lineup in the sixth inning after he hit a two-run 
triple past diving right fielder Tom Brunansky. Puckett also had a run-scoring 
double in the fourth to give the Twins to a 10-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Twins went through five Red Sox pitchers, including outfielder Danny Heep, 
who came in to pitch the eighth inning. He gave up one run, fewer than any 
other Boston player to take the mound. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota's Roy Smith, whose longest outing this season had been 6 2/3 innings, 
pitched a four-hitter. He retired 12 consecutive batters from the fourth to the 
eighth inning, struck out three and walked none. 
</P>
<P>
Boston starter Eric Hetzel, lasted only 2 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 2, Chicago 1 -- Kenny Williams' seventh-inning double broke a tie to 
help give the Tigers a victory at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy Jones was safe at second on third baseman Robin Ventura's throwing error 
and Ed Romero sacrificed. Williams then doubled to center off White Sox starter 
Greg Hibbard to score Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Gibson got the victory in relief of Dan Petry, and Mike Henneman got his 
11th save. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 5, Cleveland 2 -- Mark McGwire had a solo home run and a run-scoring 
single and Jose Canseco hit his major league-leading 18th home run at Oakland 
as the Athletics won their fifth game in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Rickey Henderson got his 20th steal in the fifth inning, moving to within one 
of Ty Cobb's 62-year-old American League stolen base record of 892. Henderson, 
after being thrown out at second in the third inning by Sandy Alomar, stole 
third after a double. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire ended a two-for-22 slump by hitting a home run over the center-field 
fence off Greg Swindell in the second inning. It put the Athletics ahead, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
Swindell allowed Canseco's homer in the eighth after Carney Lansford singled. 
Canseco has five home runs in his last five games. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 3, Seattle 1 -- Fred McGriff's two-run home run in the 11th inning at 
Seattle helped the Blue Jays snap a four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
George Bell led off the inning with an infield single off Bill Swift (2-2). 
McGriff followed with his seventh home run. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners scored one run after there were two out in the fourth. Ken Griffey 
Jr. and Edgar Martinez drew walks from rookie Willie Blair, and Henry Cotto 
followed with a looping single down the right-field line to score Griffey. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto tied it, 1-1, in the seventh when McGriff's groundout scored Kelly 
Gruber, who led off the inning with a single and went to third on a single by 
Bell. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Acker (1-1), who pitched 1 1/3 innings in relief, was credited with the 
victory. Tom Henke pitched the last two-thirds of an inning for his fifth save. 
</P>
<P>
New York 6, Kansas City 3 -- Jesse Barfield's check-swing double drove in three 
runs in the first inning and poor fielding by the Royals helped the Yankees win 
at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
A throwing error by rookie second baseman Terry Shumpert helped the Yankees 
score two runs in the fifth inning. The Royals dropped to 15-25, matching the 
Houston Astros for the worst record in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Cary pitched five innings, walking two, striking out five and giving up 
four hits. Lee Guetterman gave up three hits in three innings and Dave Righetti 
pitched the ninth for his ninth save. 
</P>
<P>
Loser Storm Davis departed in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 12, Texas 2 -- Pete Harnisch shut down the Rangers for the second 
time in six days and Joe Orsulak was four for five with four RBIs as the 
Orioles won easily at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Harnisch gave up a run in the first inning on Harold Baines' sacrifice fly, 
then retired 14 of the next 16 batters. He pitched seven innings, allowing 
seven hits. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Melvin, who replaced injured starting catcher Mickey Tettleton in the 
second inning, had a two-run home run, and Baltimore added a run on Rene 
Gonzales' suicide squeeze bunt. 
</P>
<P>
Tettleton was hit on the right elbow by Kevin Brown's pitch in the first 
inning. X-rays of the elbow were negative. 
</P>
<P>
Brown gave up seven runs, four earned, and seven hits in 4 1/3 innings.

LA QUINTA'S PATCHWORK LINEUP FALLS TO TUSTIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
La Quinta High School's makeshift lineup was no match for top-seeded Tustin 
Friday as the Tillers advanced to the semifinals for the second consecutive 
year with a 6-2 victory in the quarterfinals of the Southern Section 3-A 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta played without pitcher Jon Korzen, who was suspended from school for 
five days this week. Korzen's absence forced Coach Dan Demarest to move 
freshman Ken Granger, the team's starting left fielder, to third base, where he 
had played only four innings all season. 
</P>
<P>
The results were predictable; La Quinta committed six errors, including two in 
the decisive sixth inning when Tustin scored three unearned runs. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Demarest didn't make any excuses for the loss. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't say, 'I wonder what would have happened if we had Korzen,' " he 
said. "You can sit here and go what if, what if, what if . . . all afternoon. 
The bottom line is Tustin is a good team and deserved to win. They could go all 
the way." 
</P>
<P>
Tustin (25-3) took advantage of La Quinta's mistakes and used timely hitting to 
complement the pitching of left-hander Dan Baker (14-1). Baker struck out six 
of the first nine batters he faced and allowed four hits to gain his sixth 
consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
"He made some adjustments after losing to Newport Harbor and has put a little 
more jump into his fastball," Tustin Coach Vince Brown said. "Usually, he 
starts slowly and finishes strong, but today, he was just the opposite." 
</P>
<P>
Tustin's hitters also started quickly. Catcher Ryan Relph gave the Tillers a 
2-0 lead when he hit a two-run homer over the center-field fence in the third 
inning. Tustin had at least one hit in every inning except the fourth and 
finished with 11 hits. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta (21-9) cut the deficit to 2-1 when catcher Matt Logan's homered in 
the fourth and then tied the score in the fifth after center fielder Chad Faltz 
misplayed a single that rolled to the fence, allowing Granger to score. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta committed two errors in the fifth, which led to one run, and two in 
the sixth, which led to three runs. Tustin third baseman Ben Strack's two-run 
double in the sixth inning was the key hit. 
</P>
<P>
"I was moving my infielders all around, and we stayed close for a while," 
Demarest said. "I had my closer (Jason Cherms) in there pitching in the third 
inning and he did a great job. But sooner or later, things were bound to come 
apart and they did." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said the team's goal following a season-ending 7-2 loss to Kennedy at UC 
Irvine last year was to return to the semifinals this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to get back, and we're in that situation again," Brown said. "This 
team has improved as the season progressed, and today, we took advantage of 
their mistakes. We're getting better with every game."

MARINA'S STRING OF UPSETS CONTINUES WHEN MATER DEI FALLS, 4-0

The Marina High School baseball team continues to make up for lost time, not to 
mention a few lost years. 
</P>
<P>
After going 14 years without a victory in the Southern Section baseball 
playoffs, the Vikings are on the verge of playing for the 5-A championship. 
They advanced to the semifinals with a 4-0 victory over Mater Dei Friday at 
Marina. 
</P>
<P>
It is the first time the Vikings have reached the semifinals since 1976, which 
was also the last time they won a playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings have eliminated fourth-seeded Hacienda Heights Wilson, Esperanza, 
the Empire League champion, and Mater Dei, the Angelus League champion. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of our guys thought we would be out in the first round," said 
Marina first baseman Marc Newfield, who had a solo home run Friday. "But when 
we beat Wilson, we started believing." 
</P>
<P>
Marina is the third-place team from the Sunset League, but had only a 12-12-1 
record entering the playoffs. The Vikings' pitching had been inconsistent 
through most of the season 
</P>
<P>
However, Marina has received strong performances from Sean Patterson and David 
Schultz through the first three playoff games. Friday, it was Patterson's turn. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson (6-2) kept the free-swinging Monarchs off-balance by changing speeds 
and locations. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei (20-9) had 11 hits against Lakewood, including two home runs by 
Lionel Hastings, in its second-round victory Tuesday. The Monarchs had only 
three hits off Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
"We sat down with Sean before the game and decided that we really didn't know 
enough about Mater Dei to change anything," Marina Coach Paul Renfrow said. "So 
we told him to go out and keep the ball low and mix things up. If we got burned 
once with a home run, then we'd just eat that one." 
</P>
<P>
Patterson struck out just two batters, but the Monarchs hit only seven balls 
out of the infield and all were outs except Jim Betzold's double in the fourth 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the type of pitcher that gives us trouble," Mater Dei Coach Bob Ickes 
said. "We're a very aggressive team and he didn't give us anything that we 
could hit hard. Bishop Amat and St. Paul beat us with the same type of 
pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
Patterson was in trouble only once, when Betzold reached on an error to lead 
off the second and Cale Carter walked. However, Taylor Ivey missed a sacrifice 
bunt attempt and Betzold was picked off second by catcher Robin Lindsey. 
</P>
<P>
Marina (15-12-1) didn't do much better off Sean Sutton (8-5). The Vikings had 
seven hits, but other than Newfield's solo home run in the third, none were hit 
hard. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings took the lead in the bottom of the first after nearly running 
themselves out of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
With runners on first and third and no outs, the Vikings tried a double steal, 
and Travis Boyd being thrown out at the plate. The inning might have been a 
disaster had Schultz not followed with a single to score Lindsey from second 
base. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings added another run in the second on a sacrifice fly by Jeremy 
Preall. Newfield homered in the third, his sixth of the season, and Marina 
added an unearned run in the sixth.

FLYNN GIVES CSUN JUMP ON COMPETITION

<P>
A day after watching its male counterpart steal the show, the Cal State 
Northridge women's team got into the act in the NCAA Division II track and 
field championships at Hampton University's Armstrong Field on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Lolita Pile finished third in the long jump and Lisa Gill was fourth in the 
heptathlon, as expected, but it was the third-place showing of Noreen Flynn in 
the high jump that ignited the Lady Matadors on the second day of the three-day 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge was third in the team standings with 20 1/2 points, trailing 
defending champion Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (38) and Abilene Christian (24). 
</P>
<P>
Northridge continued to hold a surprising lead in the men's competition, but 
the advantage is expected to evaporate quickly when defending champion St. 
Augustine's (N.C.) unleashes its lethal arsenal of sprinters, hurdlers and 
triple jumpers this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
John Burton's third-place finish in the decathlon gave Northridge a 26-point 
total, with UC Davis and St. Augustine's tied for second with 21. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn, a 1986 graduate of Bell-Jeff High, barely qualified for the Division II 
meet, posting a provisional qualifying mark of 5 feet 7 1/4 inches at Cal State 
Los Angeles last Saturday. But her first-attempt clearance of 5-7 on Friday 
earned her an All-American certificate. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely wanted to clear 5-7 coming into the meet," Flynn said. "I thought 
that would make me an All-American, but I was thinking more like sixth. I never 
thought I'd get third." 
</P>
<P>
Flynn, who redshirted the 1988 season while recovering from knee surgery, 
cleared 5-3, 5-5 and 5-7 on her initial respective efforts before missing three 
times at 5-8 3/4, which would have been a personal best. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I could make that height, but I just didn't have enough to do it," 
said Flynn, who set her personal best of 5-8 1/2 as a freshman in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Pile, a three-time All-American in the triple jump, was fourth in the long jump 
after five rounds, but her sixth -- and final -- effort of 19-11 1/2 tied her 
with Irish Holmes of St. Augustine's. 
</P>
<P>
Pile took third on the basis of a better second jump. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little disappointed," said Pile, winner of the California Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. title with a personal best of 20-3. "I would like to have jumped 
20 feet again." 
</P>
<P>
Gill, a sophomore from Alemany High, totaled a personal best of 5,031 points in 
the seven-event heptathlon. Sixth after the first day, Gill jumped 18-6 1/2 in 
the long jump, threw the javelin 136-7, and ran the 800 in 2 minutes 39.12 
seconds to add 95 points to her previous best. 
</P>
<P>
Gill was first after her personal best in the javelin, but the 800 is one of 
her weaker events, and Jackie Alford of East Texas State (5,266 points, 2:18.07 
in the 800), Karen Lauve of Seattle Pacific (5,220, 2:22.12) and Chris Diehl 
(5,062, 2:31.82) all passed her in the final event. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the heptathlon, Gill tied Stacy Roberts of Northeast Missouri 
State for seventh in the high jump at 5-5. The mark was below par for Gill but 
did add 1 1/2 points to Northridge's total. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Matadors suffered a major setback, however, when freshman Kim Young 
failed to advance to the final of the 100-meter hurdles. Young, who ran 13.77 
in the Northridge Open earlier this month, was a non-qualifying fifth in the 
second heat in 14.54. 
</P>
<P>
Burton, fourth after the first day of the decathlon, strung together an 
unspectacular but solid second day to total 6,739 points, five points ahead of 
Arden Beachy of North Dakota State. 
</P>
<P>
In men's qualifying, CSUN suffered no major casualties as Kevin Hendrix and 
Chris Pippins made the final of the 100 meters and teamed with Melvin Jones and 
Wade Smart for a 40.41 clocking in the first heat of the 400 relay.

LEADING A CHARMED LIFE;

<P>
CSUN'S SHARTS BLENDS SKILL WITH SUPERSTITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Scott Hayward happened to be playing left field for UC Riverside last Sunday 
when Scott Sharts connected with a slider that was last seen rapidly heading 
east at about a 30-degree angle. 
</P>
<P>
Hayward turned to give chase, but his retreat lasted only a step before reality 
set in. 
</P>
<P>
As the ball cleared the wall, Hayward's shoulders sagged and his head drooped. 
For several seconds he stared at the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Ditto for Bill Jordan, the Riverside pitcher whose two-ball, no-strike pitch 
had just been sent whistling ("Dixie" no doubt) into the afternoon breeze. 
</P>
<P>
There have been 26 such Sharts Shots and each has had a similar effect on the 
posture of Cal State Northridge opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Sharts Shots are high, deep and they hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's fourth-inning homer was the only run Northridge would need to qualify 
for the NCAA Division II World Series that starts today in Montgomery, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
Sharts made sure it would stand up. The 6-foot-6, 221-pound sophomore 
right-hander earned the 2-0, complete-game victory by allowing only eight hits 
to a Riverside lineup that came into the game batting .332. 
</P>
<P>
"What can I say? He just dominated us," Riverside Coach Jack Smitheran said. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who witnessed Sharts prepare for the game might have expected as much. 
After all: 
</P>
<P>
He was wearing his home-game undershirt. 
</P>
<P>
His socks and stirrups had been donned in the correct order. 
</P>
<P>
His belt buckle was on the right notch. 
</P>
<P>
His uniform had been buttoned juuust right. 
</P>
<P>
"When it comes to superstition, I'm probably the worst," Sharts said sheepishly 
while relaxing before practice this week. 
</P>
<P>
Sharts always puts his right sock -- he says the right are clearly 
distinguishable from the left -- on before the left. Same with his sanitary 
stockings and stirrups. 
</P>
<P>
When he doesn't pitch, Sharts wears a brace on his right elbow. It is a remnant 
from a time earlier this season when he was bothered by tendinitis. 
</P>
<P>
The brace was given to Sharts by Phil Lombardi, a one-time major league 
catcher. The first game he wore it, Sharts blasted two home runs. 
</P>
<P>
The arm ailment is long gone, but the brace might be around for a while. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people think it's stupid and it doesn't work, but I'm staying with it," 
Sharts said. "It works for me." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, so do carne asada burritos. 
</P>
<P>
Sharts reports that he and Dave Weatherman, CSUN's pitching coach, dine 
regularly at a particular Mexican restaurant in Simi Valley on the night before 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Wade Boggs eats chicken. Sharts eats burritos. 
</P>
<P>
Somebody should patent the recipe. 
</P>
<P>
In his first full season of college baseball, Sharts has broken Northridge's 
10-year-old single-season home run record, is batting .299 with a team-high 66 
runs batted in, and has a 5-2 pitching record with a strikeout for each of his 
55 innings pitched. 
</P>
<P>
All things considered, the West regional title game against Riverside was just 
another day at the office. 
</P>
<P>
Sharts expected there would be plenty of those days when he left Simi Valley 
High in 1988, bound for the University of Miami. He and the Hurricanes were 
supposed to take Division I baseball by storm. 
</P>
<P>
He signed with Miami in hopes of playing for a champion but rarely played, and 
the Hurricanes were knocked off in the Division I World Series by Louisiana 
State. 
</P>
<P>
Sharts, who blasted a Southern Section-record 32 home runs in his high school 
career, hit .222 in only 36 at-bats as a reserve first baseman for Miami last 
season. As a pitcher, he logged 18 1/3 innings, allowing eight runs and 
compiling a 1-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
Yearning to be a regular -- preferably at both positions -- Sharts asked to be 
released from his scholarship at the conclusion of last season. Miami obliged. 
</P>
<P>
Sharts was the college equivalent of a free agent. And there were plenty of 
takers. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge had a vacancy at first base and the Matadors were in need of both a 
power hitter and pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Sharts certainly fit the bill. But would he befit the program? 
</P>
<P>
That question was answered the first time Sharts' new teammates saw him on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
With a hose and a rake. 
</P>
<P>
"We had two weeks of working on the field before we started practice and he was 
one of the first ones out there every day," Northridge Coach Bill Kernen said. 
"I think he showed the other guys right there that he wasn't going to be a 
prima donna." 
</P>
<P>
Miami had its own grounds crew, but the Hurricanes also had a crew of players 
trying out at every position. 
</P>
<P>
When Sharts jogged toward first base to take infield on the first day of 
practice at Northridge, no one else came with him. 
</P>
<P>
So what would a little landscaping hurt? 
</P>
<P>
"As it turned out, I couldn't ask for anything more," Sharts said. (Kernen) has 
given me a shot. When I was slumping he'd tell me, 'I don't care if you go 0 
for 40, you're still going to be in the lineup.' Here I can relax and do what 
I'm capable of doing." 
</P>
<P>
The bill of Sharts' baseball hat is testimony to the damage he has inflicted on 
CSUN's opponents this season. There are asterisks drawn in a line across the 
brim, one for each home run he has hit. 
</P>
<P>
"At the start of the year I said I had the potential to go all the way around," 
Sharts said. "Now that I've done it, I'm going to start across the middle." 
</P>
<P>
However, numbers alone aren't a true indicator of Sharts' value to Northridge. 
The West regional title game was merely the latest example. 
</P>
<P>
"When push comes to shove and you're locked in a great pitching duel like that, 
you look at a guy like him and say, 'You know what? He's gonna hit one out. 
He's gonna throw a gem,' " Kernen said. "That's why he's here. 
</P>
<P>
"He lives for that. Championship guys do." 
</P>
<P>
Sharts and the Matadors will be trying for their third championship of the 
season beginning Sunday at Paterson Field in Montgomery, when they make their 
debut in the eight-team, double-elimination national tournament against Lewis 
University of Romeoville, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to winning the West regional title, the Matadors shared the 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. championship with Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge won the first of its two Division II championships in 1970. Its 
other national title came in 1984, when the Matadors featured another sophomore 
pitcher named Sharts: Steve Sharts, Scott's older brother. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Sharts is a left-handed relief pitcher for the Philadelphia Phillies' 
triple-A affiliate in Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, Pa., but his influence has been 
felt 3,000 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
"My brother has been the inspirational person in my baseball career," Scott 
said. "He's the one who keeps me going." 
</P>
<P>
Steve is kept informed of his brother's progress through a stream of telephone 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview this week, Steve recalled a time when the brothers 
used to face off in batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd hit five or six rockets before I'd throw him a cut fastball or a changeup 
or something just to show him I could pitch a little," Steve said. "He'd just 
laugh. I'd say, 'You're pretty good, but I've got some smarts.' " 
</P>
<P>
The dream then was the same as it is now. 
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate goal is for me to pitch against him in the big leagues some day," 
Steve said. 
</P>
<P>
In Steve's absence, a trio of former teammates showed up at Northridge last 
Sunday to help Scott through the regional championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Between innings, Sharts received words of encouragement from Dave Williams, 
Perry Husband and Todd Mustin, all members of Northridge's 1984 team. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw guys that played with my brother coming back and showing some 
interest, it was a real exciting thing for me," Scott said. "It pumped me up. I 
wanted them to see us do well and carry on the tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all following in their footsteps, kind of like I've always wanted to 
follow what my brother was doing." 
</P>
<P>
He seems well on his way. The brothers even have similar superstitions. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, Steve Sharts has been struggling with his consistency. 
</P>
<P>
So, having studied videotape and checked his mechanics, Sharts says he now is 
checking his wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny. When I have a bad game I don't really look at my performance. My 
first thought is always something like, 'Oh, my gosh, I didn't have on the 
right shirt. . . .'

EL CAMINO REAL EARNS A DREAM DATE IN FINAL; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: TREEND BEDEVILS SAN FERNANDO, 3-1, AND SENDS CONQUISTADORES TO THE 
CITY 4-A TITLE GAME AT DODGER STADIUM.

<P>
Ryan McGuire admits the idea sounds hokey. In fact, he uses more descriptive 
terms, such as "dorky and corny." 
</P>
<P>
McGuire, a first baseman at El Camino Real High, took out a small ad in the 
school paper. Those purchasing the ads, called senior wills, were asked to 
bequeath to their classmates items of sentimental value. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire left an item or two to a couple of teammates but saved the best for 
last. 
</P>
<P>
"I willed the baseball team one night on our field of dreams," McGuire said. 
"Dodger Stadium. I tried to figure out something catchy, but it was the most 
eloquent thing I could think of." 
</P>
<P>
Here's to willpower. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real defeated San Fernando, 3-1, Friday in a City Section 4-A 
Division semifinal game before an estimated crowd of 1,000 at Valley College 
and, in doing so, advanced to the final Wednesday night -- at McGuire's venue 
of preference. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real (21-2-1), which last played in the championship game in 1984, 
will face Chatsworth in the final. Chatsworth defeated Taft, 6-1, in a 
semifinal game at Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Treend's dreams had plenty to do with fields too. Such as being planted six 
feet under in one. 
</P>
<P>
The senior right-hander threw a one-hitter and struck out 11 in what he termed 
his "best game of the year," but he conceded that the butterflies have been 
bat-sized all week long. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the most scared guy on the team," he said. "I laid in bed every night 
since I knew it was going to be San Fernando and us. They scare me more than 
any team in the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
McGuire's looping single in the first inning keyed a two-run rally that started 
San Fernando's downfall. Facing left-hander Canto Franco, a surprise starter, 
Jeff Marks walked and took second on a wild pitch. McGuire's excuse-me dunker 
to right gave El Camino Real runners at first and third with nobody out. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a sit-on-a-fastball-and-drive-it swing," McGuire said. "But it turned 
into a oh-my-gosh-it's-a-straight-change swing. I just dropped the bat on the 
ball." 
</P>
<P>
After Jason Cohen forced McGuire at second, with Marks holding at third, Bobby 
Kim gave the Conquistadores a 1-0 lead on a chopper through the hole into left. 
Greg Lederman drove in Cohen, who had stolen second and moved to third on Kim's 
single, on a ground out to short. 
</P>
<P>
Franco (9-1) surrendered a leadoff double to Lederman to open the fourth. 
Treend, who has been among the team leaders in runs batted in all season, then 
smacked a liner into left to give El Camino Real a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I still wouldn't call Pat a hitter," McGuire said, grinning. "He grabs a bat, 
walks up and starts swinging. He reduces the game to its basics." 
</P>
<P>
After Treend's single, Franco was relieved by senior right-hander John Najar, 
whom many expected to start. Figuring that El Camino Real would be among that 
group, the Tigers (18-7-2) threw the junior lefty instead. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured we could get three or four innings out of Canto and then come back 
with Johnny," San Fernando pitching coach Joe Bergara said. "He pitched good, 
but they get a walk, a check swing, a passed ball. . . . and boom, we're down 
two runs." 
</P>
<P>
Najar was impressive, allowing no runs or hits and striking out five over the 
final four innings. But the damage had been done, and Treend ensured the lead 
would not be blown by blowing fastball after fastball by the Tiger batters. 
</P>
<P>
The senior right-hander -- who completed his 12th game in 13 starts -- did not 
allow a ball to be hit out of the infield over the first four innings. Treend 
carried a no-hitter into the sixth, when San Fernando mounted its only real 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Sanchez led off the inning with a liner to left-center that center 
fielder Marks caught off his shoe tops on the dead run. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I caught it," Marks said. "My glove was on the ground when it hit it. 
The play before, Jason (Cohen, the left fielder) said to dive for anything." 
</P>
<P>
But Marks' acrobatics might have saved more than a mere no-hit bid. 
</P>
<P>
Treend walked David Rojas on four pitches and with two out, hit Najar on an 0-2 
pitch. Jess Ceniceros singled cleanly to left to drive in Rojas. 
</P>
<P>
Fernando Ortega then launched what seemed destined to be a double into the gap 
in left. Marks, however, tracked the ball down to save two runs. 
</P>
<P>
"Jeff saved my butt, big time," Treend said. 
</P>
<P>
The catch prompted an impromptu jig from El Camino Real Coach Mike Maio, who 
spent much of the game in a crouch or on both knees in front of the dugout, 
ripping up blades of grass. At times, he seemed too worried to watch the game, 
instead looking at the pebbles around his feet. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, I saw it," said Maio, who led El Camino Real to the final in 1984, only to 
lose to Granada Hills. "I think it's better for the team if I just sit there 
and play with rocks or something." 
</P>
<P>
Treend walked Luis Rodriguez with one out in the seventh and San Fernando sent 
pinch-hitter Damacio Mendoza to the plate. Mendoza, a long-ball threat who was 
promoted from the junior varsity for the playoffs, waved at three Treend 
fastballs. 
</P>
<P>
Treend retired Sanchez on a grounder to second to end the game. The final out, 
of course, prompted the usual festive pile on the mound. Eloquent, it wasn't. 
But nobody seemed to mind.

MCHENDRY WESTLAKE'S LASTEST HERO AS WARRIORS ADVANCE TO SEMIFINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During Westlake High's 29-game journey to the Southern Section 5-A Division 
baseball semifinals, clutch performances from various players have helped 
smooth the ride. 
</P>
<P>
Friday at Bishop Amat, it was Matt McHendry's turn at the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
McHendry, a senior right fielder, had two hits to set up two runs, then added a 
diving catch that saved at least one run in a 5-2 win over the Lancers. 
Top-seeded Westlake (28-1) will meet Marina (15-12-1), a 4-0 winner over Mater 
Dei, Tuesday at 4 p.m. in a semifinal at Blair Field in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"A different guy has picked us up all year," Westlake Coach Rich Herrera said. 
"It just goes to show that we have a pretty solid lineup." 
</P>
<P>
Balance has helped the Warriors overcome a batting slump that has affected 
their top two hitters, Tim Falsken and Mike Lieberthal, who are a combined 
three for 19 in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
And who better to come to the rescue than McHendry? He hit .235 and was 
platooned in right field with Keenan McAluney during the regular season, but he 
has started each of Westlake's three playoff games and is hitting .429 in the 
postseason. 
</P>
<P>
Yet his most important contribution Friday might have been his catch that ended 
the fifth inning with the tying run at first base. 
</P>
<P>
With Westlake nursing a 3-1 lead, Bishop Amat (18-10) put runners at first and 
third with two out. George Garcia followed with a soft fly ball along the 
right-field foul line, and McHendry -- playing deep in Bishop Amat's spacious 
outfield -- sprinted in to make a diving catch. 
</P>
<P>
The nearest fence at the Lancers' home field is 415 feet from the plate, which 
forced McHendry to approach each ball with caution. 
</P>
<P>
"I was playing back, just worrying about keeping the ball in front of me," he 
said. "At first, I thought it was going foul, but I felt I had it all the way." 
</P>
<P>
The rest of Westlake's defense was equally impressive. Shortstop Falsken and 
second baseman Rick Wolters combined to turn two double plays, including one to 
end the game, and pitcher Mike Eby (11-0) induced the Lancers into 13 ground 
outs. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake erased a 1-0 deficit in the second on Todd Preston's first home run of 
the season and took a 2-1 lead on Dave Monheim's two-out single in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
McHendry helped produce a run in the fifth when he singled, stole second and 
scored on Rob Neal's double to give Westlake a 3-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors added two runs in the seventh. McHendry singled, Wolters was hit 
by a pitch, and both runners advanced on a wild pitch from Eric White (6-3). 
</P>
<P>
Neal then followed with a two-run single that gave Westlake a 5-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
That was plenty for Eby, a senior left-hander who went the distance for the 
11th time in 13 starts. Eby allowed eight hits and four walks but pitched out 
of three jams. 
</P>
<P>
And McHendry's heroics were enough for Herrera, who was left wondering which 
Warrior is next in line. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's our scorekeeper's turn," he said with a laugh.

SAN LUIS OBISPO RALLIES IN SEVENTH TO DEFEAT CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Luis Obispo High School rallied for two runs in the seventh inning to 
defeat Canyon, 4-3, Friday in a Southern Section 4-A baseball playoff game at 
San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third consecutive time San Luis Obispo has rallied for two runs in 
the seventh to win, 4-3, in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon (14-13-1) had scored a run in the second and two more in the fifth to 
take a 3-1 lead. San Luis Obispo added one in the sixth to cut the lead to 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Josh Simmons opened the seventh with a single for San Luis Obispo (19-5). A 
throwing error by Canyon pitcher Greg Tippen put runners on first and second. 
</P>
<P>
Grant Munger's RBI single tied the score, 3-3, and left runners on first and 
second. A passed ball moved the runners up and an intentional walk loaded the 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Emery hit into a force play at home, but a wild throw to first allowed 
the winning run to score.

SOUTHERN SECTION BASEBALL QUARTERFINALS; 
</P>
<P>
SPARKS HELPS IGNITE MONTCLAIR PREP, 11-9 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Montclair Prep Coach Walt Steele will be the first to admit it wasn't pretty. 
</P>
<P>
But in the playoffs, as he'll also tell you, aesthetics count for very little. 
</P>
<P>
After surviving a 2 1/2-hour bus trip to the desert and nearly blowing a 10-run 
lead in the final three innings, top-seeded Montclair Prep hung on to defeat 
Beaumont, 11-9, in a Southern Section 1-A Division quarterfinal game Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We managed to survive," Steele said. "We let those guys back in the ballgame, 
but we should've known that when you're in somebody else's backyard, they're 
not going to back down." 
</P>
<P>
Montclair Prep (23-3) took a commanding 11-1 lead in the fifth inning after 
5-foot-9 center fielder Leland Sparks hit a grand slam, his second homer of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
From there, Beaumont (17-10) scored four runs in the fifth to chase starter and 
winner Kevin Grant (11-1). Beaumont added three runs in the sixth and one in 
the seventh before senior Scott Saklad shut the door for his second save. 
</P>
<P>
Sparks had two hits and five runs batted in. Teammate Andy Shaw had three hits, 
and Jared Baumblatt and Keyaan Cook had two hits each. 
</P>
<P>
In the semifinals on Tuesday, Montclair Prep will meet Paraclete, which 
defeated Crossroads, 21-5, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In other quarterfinal games: 
</P>
<P>
3-A DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
La Serna 4, Saugus 3 -- La Serna scored the winning run when Saugus pitcher 
Chris Hernandez hit Glen Huggins with a 1-and-1 pitch with one out and the 
bases loaded in the bottom of the 11th inning. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez (7-3), a sophomore left-hander, replaced starter Doug Maggiora in the 
ninth inning. With one out in the 11th, Jeff Ferguson and Bryan Dunnigan 
singled and Willie Adams reached base on a fielder's choice to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Walter White was two for five with an RBI for Saugus (20-6-1). Pat Henry 
was one for three with a run scored and an RBI. 
</P>
<P>
1-A DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
Village Christian 3, Kern Valley 2 -- Senior left-hander Matt Bates was two for 
three and scored two runs to lead Village Christian in a quarterfinal at Kern 
Valley. Bates (8-0) also pitched six innings, allowed two runs and struck out 
seven. 
</P>
<P>
With Village Christian (17-6) leading, 3-1, in the bottom of the seventh, Bates 
allowed a walk and a double to lead off the inning. He was relieved by Mark 
Vail, who walked the first man he faced to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Vail retired the next two batters via a strikeout and a fly ball, then walked 
in a run to cut the lead to 3-2. Vail, a junior right-hander, ended the game 
with a strikeout. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore 17, Tehachapi 7 -- Junior right-hander Anthony Chessani survived a 
rocky start to pitch a complete game as the Flashes advanced to the semifinals 
on Tuesday against Village Christian. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore, which reached the 1-A final last season, led, 7-3, after an inning 
and a half, but Tehachapi scored three in the bottom of the second and one in 
the third to tie. However, Chessani (10-1), who struck out five and scattered 
12 hits, yielded only five hits after the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
Chad Van Winkle, who was two for three, hit a pair of two-run home runs to lead 
Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
Paraclete 21, Crossroads 5 -- Paraclete collected a season-high 20 hits to go 
with a season-high run total in a quarterfinal game at Paraclete. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Stewart led the Spirits' attack with three hits, including a two-run home 
run in the second inning to give Paraclete (15-7) a 6-0 lead. Jason Williams 
was two for three, including a double and a triple, with two RBIs. Jeff 
Williams, Jason's twin, was three for five, and Andre Matalon was two for four. 
</P>
<P>
SMALL SCHOOLS DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
Rosamond 11, Queen of Angels 5 -- Felix Renteria was two for three, including a 
run-scoring triple, for Queen of Angels (14-5). Eric Montijo added two hits and 
two RBIs.

PACIFICA SURPRISES TOP-SEEDED HART TO ADVANCE

Hart High School Coach Al Weil watched his team lose Friday in the Southern 
Section 4-A quarterfinals by the same score as last year, 1-0, with the run 
coming in the same half inning -- the bottom of the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Pacifica (16-8) eliminated top-seeded Hart from the playoffs to reach the 
semifinals for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"We were coming out to win, not just come out to be satisfied with the season," 
said Rob Weil, Pacifica's first-year coach. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to score a run," Hart's Al Weil said. "It's the name of the game. 
We score one run, we win. They score one run, they win." 
</P>
<P>
The game was scoreless until the last at-bat, when Pacifica first baseman Dena 
Villasenor, slowed by a knee injury, led off by bouncing a single over third 
baseman Kim Curtis' head into left field. Villasenor hobbled to first, where 
she was replaced by pinch-runner Carrie Parker. 
</P>
<P>
Villasenor, a senior, went two for three, accounting for half of Pacifica's 
hits. And her coach said he had decided to let her play before the game. 
</P>
<P>
"She was questionable yesterday with a knee injury," Rob Weil said. "So I took 
a chance with her, hoping for the base hit." 
</P>
<P>
Parker stole second when catcher Stephanie Keeler hesitated on the throw, 
following a strikeout by Susan Denny. 
</P>
<P>
"That's another one (Parker) on the injured list that just came back," Rob Weil 
said. "Carrie was out three weeks with a bad back. Usually, she's our starting 
center fielder. But today's her first day back." 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Jennifer Surface came up, after having struck out twice, and ripped the 
first pitch up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
Hart second baseman Jamie Dean dove, but the ball got past her and rolled into 
center field, and the throw to the plate was late. 
</P>
<P>
"(Hart pitcher Kym Weil) had been pitching me risers all day," Surface said. "I 
knew this would be my last chance. I had struck out twice, and I knew that I 
had to chop it -- I had to come at a different angle, and I just mentally 
pictured it." 
</P>
<P>
"Jennifer focused herself well," Rob Weil said. "She's a perfectionist, and 
she's been coming through and doing well. She's got a lot of composure for a 
sophomore." 
</P>
<P>
Surface, 15, struck out nine and walked one, with only two hits. And she is 
unsatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel there's always room for improvement," she said. "There's always 
something to work on. Right now, I have to work on the location of my pitching, 
concentrate on keeping the ball down, and I need to really work on my hitting."

CARLSON KEEPS HIS COOL IN HIGH JUMP VICTORY

At 6-foot-4 and just under 130 pounds, Kevin Carlson of Katella High School has 
a physical stature of a human knitting needle. An intimidating presence, he is 
not. 
</P>
<P>
But Friday night at the Southern Section Masters meet at Cerritos College, 
Carlson kept cool when the others couldn't, winning the high jump with a leap 
of 6 feet 9 3/4 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was not a personal best -- Carlson leads the state at 6-11 3/4, a 
leap made in a dual meet against Esperanza -- it was a significant improvement 
over last year. In 1989, Carlson did not even make it to the Masters meet and 
finished the season with a best of 6-5 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Five jumpers, including Carlson, had cleared 6-8 Friday when the bar was raised 
to 6-10. While no one else came close, Carlson cleared the height on his second 
attempt. The bar was later measured at 6-9 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Carlson then attempted 7-0, but couldn't clear it. 
</P>
<P>
"I got close (on the second attempt), but it's pretty hard to tell. It's pretty 
high up there," Carlson said. "I'm going to go for it in the state meet." 
</P>
<P>
Carlson was one of five Orange County athletes to win a field event. And 30 
Orange County athletes and one relay team qualified for the state 
championships, scheduled for June 1 and 2 at Cerritos College, by placing in 
the top five of their events. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza junior Mark Parlin won the boys' shotput with a mark of 60-3 1/2 
after qualifying in the discus with a fourth-place throw of 175-4. Parlin, who 
leads the Southern Section shotput list at 61-4, will now get the chance to 
meet high school star Brent Noon of Fallbrook at the state meet. Noon has put 
the shot 76-2 this season, the second best effort on the all-time high school 
list. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want a good series next week, like I had last week (in the divisional 
finals)," said Parlin, who Friday night had only one toss more than 60 feet. "I 
really wasn't into the throwing mode yet." 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills' Andy Marrone knew the feeling. Marrone, who set a 4-A discus record 
(192-1) last week, won that event on his first throw, 184-1. 
</P>
<P>
And Magnolia's Phouphet Singbandith, the national leader in the triple jump at 
51-0 3/4, won that event on his first attempt (49-8 1/2). Then, as has often 
been his habit this season, Singbandith passed on the rest of his jumps -- 
keeping a close watch on the competition all the while -- to avoid risk of 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park's Beth Byron won the girls' high jump at 5-6, then passed at 5-7 
before missing all three jumps at 5-8. 
</P>
<P>
In the running events, Edison sophomore Shelley Taylor finished second in the 
1,600 -- an event she won here last year -- with a time of 4 minutes 55.50 
seconds. Taylor ran shoulder to shoulder with favorite Karen Hecox of South 
Hills for most of the race, staying 20-30 yards behind Deena Drossin of Agoura. 
Drossin set a fast pace from the gun, and looked strong until the final 100 
meters where Taylor and Hecox began to reel her in. But Drossin held them off, 
winning in 4:54.71. Hecox was third in 4:55.82. 
</P>
<P>
University's Tanja Brix and Katella's Martha Pinto had career-best times in the 
girls' 3,200. Brix, who was in sixth with 200 meters to go, passed three 
runners around the final turn to finish third in 10:50.10 -- erasing four 
seconds from her previous record. Pinto, in fifth with a lap to go, dropped to 
sixth but then powered past Lucinda Reyes of Lakewood to regain fifth in 
10:51.29. 
</P>
<P>
In the 100, San Clemente's Tim Martin was third (10.70) and Los Alamitos' Erik 
Mitchell was fourth (10.71). 
</P>
<P>
But in the 200, Mitchell's better event, Mitchell was second (21.34) to 
Martin's sixth (21.80). 
</P>
<P>
In the hurdles, Woodbridge's Kaci Keffer ran a lifetime best 42.98 to place 
third in the 300 hurdles. La Quinta freshman Elinor Tolson qualified for the 
state meet by taking fourth in the 100 hurdles (14.56), and Dave Fair of El 
Toro was fourth in the 300 hurdles (38.46). 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza's girls 1,600-meter relay team finished n fourth in 3:52.93, a county 
best this year, on the strength of Nikki Jackson's third leg and Lynn Murray's 
anchor leg. 
</P>
<P>
Other state meet qualifiers included: Kendall Welsey of Katella (fourth in the 
400 at 48.78), El Modena's Mike Terry (third in 800, 1:54.29), Esperanza's 
Clayton Tharrington (second in triple jump, 48-0 1/4), Valencia's Josiah 
Williams (fourth in long jump, 22-7 3/4), and Mark Kinney (third in shotput, 
55-6 3/4, Dana Hills' Matt Jordan (55-5 1/2 in the shotput), Loara's Albert 
Avila (fifth in discus, 175-4); Estancia's Debbie Hargrove (third in discus, 
143-10) and Marie Midland (fifth at 133-10), Mater Dei's Melissa McDonald 
(third in long jump, 17-9), Mission Viejo's Lisa Fager (second in triple jump, 
38-5 3/4) and Tammy Graham (fifth, 37-8), Santa Ana Valley's Joanna Alo (third 
in shot put, 41-7 3/4), Esperanza's Nikki Jackson (fourth in 300 hurdles, 
44.37) and Mission Viejo's Kristin Dunn (fifth in shotput, 40-9).

REPEATING NO EASY TASK FOR WOODLAND HILLS WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
American Legion District 20 baseball, featuring defending World Series champion 
Woodland Hills West, opens play today at high schools throughout the San 
Fernando and Antelope valley and Glendale areas. 
</P>
<P>
Defending its title, even on the home front, will be more difficult this year 
for West. This season, there are 24 teams in the district, an increase of five 
from 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The Western Division features Woodland Hills East (primarily Taft High 
players), Woodland Hills West (El Camino Real), Granada Hills, Agoura, Reseda, 
Chatsworth, Encino-Crespi (Crespi) and Las Virgenes (Calabasas). Woodland Hills 
West won the division and district titles in '89, finishing with a 
regular-season mark of 19-3. 
</P>
<P>
West again should be the team to beat -- perhaps beyond the district level. 
Eleven players return, including third baseman Del Marine, the 1989 national 
legion Player of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
Also expected to play for West are Pat Treend, Jason Cohen, Bobby Kim, Jeff 
Marks and Greg Lederman of El Camino Real High. Left-hander Joey Rosselli of 
Alemany High, a pitcher-first baseman and newcomer to the team, also will play. 
</P>
<P>
"We went out last year to have fun and everything fell into place," said West 
Coach Don Hornback, an assistant with the team last season. "The kids played 
very, very well. To expect us to repeat (the World Series title) is 
far-fetched. To hope we do isn't." 
</P>
<P>
The Eastern Division includes North Hollywood, Burbank, Sun Valley (Poly), Van 
Nuys-Notre Dame (Notre Dame), Glendale, Verdugo Hills, Valley Encino-Tarzana 
(Birmingham) and Panorama City (St. Genevieve). Panorama City (18-4 in district 
play) is the defending divisional champion. 
</P>
<P>
The Northern Division features Palmdale, Lancaster (Antelope Valley), West 
Hills (Chaminade), Newhall-Saugus (Saugus), Studio City (Van Nuys), Quartz Hill 
and San Fernando. Newhall-Saugus (17-5) is the defending champion. 
</P>
<P>
Play in Ventura County's District 16 begins next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Last August in Millington, Tenn., West became the first District 20 team to win 
a World Series title, defeating Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, in the championship 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Single games are scheduled each Wednesday and Saturday, with a doubleheader on 
Sunday.

RIVERSIDE TO OPEN AGAINST CHABOT AT UC IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Riverside College will attempt to cap an amazing turn-around when the community 
college state baseball championships start today at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside was 7-29-1 last year and last in the Orange Empire Conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers, under first-year coach Dennis Rogers, are 32-15 this season and 
have set a school record for victories. Rogers was an assistant at Cal State 
Fullerton for two seasons before going to Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside finished fourth in the conference this season but defeated conference 
champion Rancho Santiago and third-place Fullerton in the regional last weekend 
to advance. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside plays Chabot (41-14) at 11 a.m. today and Los Angeles Harbor (48-5) 
plays Santa Rosa (35-13) at 3 p.m. The double-elimination tournament continues 
Sunday with the losers playing at 10 a.m. at Rancho Santiago College and the 
winners at UC Irvine at 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The championship game is 11 a.m. Monday at UC Irvine.

DOW FALLS 34.63 AS HIGH-TECH SECTOR DIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A big selloff in high-flying technology stocks pounded the stock market Friday, 
extending losses to a second session following record highs reached earlier in 
the week. The session was marked by sharply reduced activity on the eve of the 
long Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials dropped 34.63 to 2,820.92, cutting its 
gain for the week to 1.01 points. 
</P>
<P>
The high-technology sector sank after software maker Adobe Systems Inc. of 
Mountain View, Calif., stunned Wall Street with an announcement that 
second-quarter earnings would be far below expectations. Its shares sank 30% on 
the news. 
</P>
<P>
"Adobe tilted the market downward with the surprise quarterly earnings report," 
said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Gruntal &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
On the broader market, declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 4 in 
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 543 up, 947 
down and 507 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Many traders got an early start on the three-day holiday weekend, accounting 
for the light Big Board volume of 120.25 million shares, down from 155.14 
million Thursday. The markets will be closed on Monday for Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
Adobe, the most active stock in the over-the-counter market, tumbled 15 1/4 to 
35 1/4. Other computer and technology issues registered smaller declines on the 
news. 
</P>
<P>
Apple Computer, a primary Adobe customer, slumped 2 to 40 in OTC trading. Among 
NYSE-listed technology stocks, International Business Machines dropped 2 1/2 to 
116 1/4, Motorola fell 3 to 80 3/4 and Hewlett-Packard lost 5/8 to 47 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stocks ended sharply higher, with strong buying sentiment encouraged 
by the yen rising to its highest level against the dollar in 2 1/2 months. The 
225-share Nikkei index jumped 482.13 points, or 1.49%, to close at 32,793.88. 
The Nikkei rose more than 1,300 points this week. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks fell on the London Stock Exchange in response to early losses on Wall 
Street. The Financial Times 100-share index lost 11.5 points to close at 
2,265.6. 
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, West Germany, stocks drifted lower in thin trading. The 30-share 
DAX index ended 8.63 points lower at 1,823.17. 
</P>
<P>
CREDIT 
</P>
<P>
Economic Report Sinks Bond Prices 
</P>
<P>
Treasury securities closed lower after a series of reports that spelled bad 
news for the bond market, including consumer spending figures that were rosier 
than analysts had expected. 
</P>
<P>
The government's bellwether 30-year bond, which lost 7/16 point Thursday, fell 
another 5/8 point, or about $6.25 per $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which 
rises when prices fall, rose to 8.66% from 8.61% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Trading was extremely light due to the long Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the market was affected by the government's report that consumer 
spending increased by 0.6% in April, the largest increase since it rose 1.2% in 
January. The increase was seen as a good indication of future economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
Traders had been expecting an increase of about 0.4%, said Mike Casey, 
international economist at Maria Ramirez Capital Consultants Inc. Bond prices 
usually decline on signs of economic improvement because it decreases the 
likelihood that the Federal Reserve Board will ease interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.313%, unchanged from late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Plunges Against the Yen 
</P>
<P>
The dollar plunged against the yen but otherwise was little changed in foreign 
exchange as investors regained confidence in the Japanese currency. 
</P>
<P>
The recovery of stock prices in Tokyo helped boost confidence in the yen. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar skidded to 149.40 yen in New York from 151.15 late Thursday. In 
Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 150.05 yen from 151.55 yen, and was quoted 
at 149.70 yen in London. 
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Corn Futures Rise as Rain Continues 
</P>
<P>
Too much rain kept corn futures prices growing, and new forecasts called for no 
change in the soggy conditions that have stalled spring planting in the 
Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
Other grain and soybean futures also advanced on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, cocoa futures retreated; livestock and meat futures 
rose; precious metals and oil futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Corn futures settled 1 cent to 5 cents higher in Chicago, with the contract for 
delivery in July at $2.84 a bushel. The July contract's gains totaled 9.25 
cents in the three days ending Friday.

STANSFIELD VERSATILE AS A VOCALIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On stage, at least, white soul singer Lisa Stansfield can't dance to save her 
life. And probably doesn't want to. 
</P>
<P>
At Stansfield's L.A. debut Thursday at downtown's newly reopened Mayan Theatre, 
her hoofing was mostly limited to furiously pacing back and forth like a 
hyped-up insomniac. In the world of dance-pop, especially after recent Bob 
Fosse-inspired trips to town by Janet Jackson and the Material Girl, this might 
seem like a crippling liability. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is her sex appeal overwhelming. About as suggestive as she gets is singing, 
"I know where you're coming from, 'cause I'm a woman," emphasizing the last 
part by running her hand up and down the length of her torso. 
</P>
<P>
But she does have it all over her contemporaries in a related, albeit less 
commercially vital, discipline: She can sing. Yes, to save her life, and maybe 
even somebody else's. 
</P>
<P>
This 23-year-old upstart star's versatile vocals are perfectly in the pocket 
for the kind of revivified black music she sings -- classy R&amp;B inspired by 
an era on the first cusp of disco in the mid-'70s, when Stansfield would have 
been not yet pubescent. 
</P>
<P>
This kind of soul -- popularized by other talented English musicians like Soul 
II Soul as well as Stansfield -- replaces the monotonous thump of that era with 
the funkier syncopation of modern hip-hop and house music, but the silky 
singing and pseudo-string arrangements wouldn't sound out of place between Boz 
Scaggs and Barry White. 
</P>
<P>
The hooks in Stansfield's songs are composed craftily enough that she doesn't 
have to take her voice to the melismatic extremes that she clearly could; the 
melodic range is written right in. And, even live, she delivers the songs 
pretty close to the vest, without much improvisation, yet sings them with 
enough supple force that you tend to believe her when she croons (with 
considerable potential for corn) that "no two people ever felt this way" and 
adds, for effect, "In this wooooorld! In this wooooorld!" 
</P>
<P>
Her recent "Affection" album, which includes the catchy hit "All Around the 
World," is as wonderful as English whites worshiping American black music gets 
-- marvelously romantic and rhythmic. Yet, good as it is, some of the songs 
tend to blur into one another, and the musical concept isn't quite enough to 
base a lasting career on. Even savoring the flavor of what she and her 
producers have done, mostly in small doses, you hope she'll stretch herself in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
The Mayan show didn't offer much in the way of expansion. A full band replaced 
the album's two-man instrumentation, complete with up to three percussionists 
working to reproduce the full force of the LP's drum programming. But the 
effect was much the same -- usually no better, no worse. 
</P>
<P>
Stansfield did have one surprise up her sleeve: a mid-set rendition of Billie 
Holiday's "Good Morning, Heartache," which she handled with all the bluesy ease 
and playfully despairing intensity you'd expect and hope for. What she does so 
entertainingly now is probably enough for one so fresh and so young -- it's 
hoped that this stray ballad was a precursor of vision and variety to come.

KOTOS ENLIVEN 'EAST / WEST' FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chamber Music/LA concert presented Thursday night at the Japan America 
Theatre wasn't the most mellifluous event in the history of the enterprising 
festival. However, it neatly underscored the official subtitle of this year's 
series: "East/West Encounters." 
</P>
<P>
The evening began with a rather aggressive performance of Erno Dohnany's 
beguiling C-major Serenade for string trio (1902). Christiaan Bor (violin), 
Milton Thomas (viola) and Jeffrey Solow (cello) played with obvious affection 
and independent finesse. Ensemble values, unfortunately, turned out to be 
somewhat sporadic, as did reliable intonation. 
</P>
<P>
The evening ended with Dvorak's rhapsodic Piano Quartet in E-flat, Opus 87. 
Here, Thomas and Solow were joined by pianist John Steele Ritter and violinist 
Yukiko Kamei, the dedicated artistic director of the festival since its 
inception in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
This performance tended to veer toward stridency, just when one longed most for 
suavity. Balance problems were aggravated by the brilliant-sounding Hamburg 
Steinway, which consistently out-thumped the delicate strings. Still, one could 
admire the pervasive brio. 
</P>
<P>
The intriguing, drastically contrasting centerpiece was a welcome Asian 
novelty: "Homura" by Tadao Sawai. Written in 1974, it is a bracing bravura 
exercise for the 17-string bass koto, accompanied by an ensemble of 
conventional 13-string kotos. 
</P>
<P>
The koto, in case you have forgotten, is a long zither equipped with movable 
frets. Its Japanese ancestry probably predates the Nara period (710-84). Sawai 
has spent much of a prolific career augmenting the sonic possibilities of the 
instrument and expanding its repertory to embrace experimental stylistic 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
"Homura," which translates as fire, makes a splendid, mighty, gutsy noise. The 
bold rhetorical outbursts of the solo koto reverberate with percussive drama 
that seems to verge on violence. The support group adds neat textural echoes 
and precise rhythmic punctuation. 
</P>
<P>
Ears unaccustomed to the idiom can recognize modest flights of modal melody. 
The primary appeal of the taut 15-minute piece, however, remains dynamic. 
</P>
<P>
Kazue Sawai, the composer's wife, served as the dazzling protagonist. Makiko 
Goto, Michie Yagi, Mieko Hayashi, Miho Okada, Ayako Kawai and Noriko Tsuboi 
functioned as her faithful, ultra-disciplined allies. 
</P>
<P>
The audience wasn't very big. It was, however, very enthusiastic.

AFTER 10 YEARS, 'BUMS' STRIKE OUT

<P>
It's kinda sad. But what's happened to "Bleacher Bums" at the Century City 
Playhouse in the last decade may be a reflection of what's happened to America. 
Call it an erosion of standards.

comedy," is celebrating this production's 10th -- count 'em -- 10th 
anniversary. It is Los Angeles' longest-running show ever, except for possibly 
"The Drunkard." But what was once a rousing 90 minutes of uplifting, low-brow 
fun at the ballpark has become an indiscriminate shambles at the theater, 
making a potent case against longevity. Could this production's durability have 
been merely a matter of keeping the doors open, whether audiences came through 
them or not? 
</P>
<P>
One thing's for sure: It's not the play's fault. Behind the sloppy din and 
mistiming, there are the remains of a wonderful little show. 
</P>
<P>
Because it was conceived and created by Chicago's Organic Theatre some 15 years 
ago (from an idea of actor Joe Mantegna, who was in both the Chicago and Los 
Angeles original productions), it takes place at Wrigley Field. The fans we see 
are Chicago Cub die-hards -- most of them. But beyond such specifics, this is a 
brash yet tender tribute to all dedicated baseball fans who never miss a game, 
would sooner surrender Mother than their allegiance to the home team, and who 
form an indestructible community of passionate bleacher zanies who hit those 
backless benches with the fire of true believers. 
</P>
<P>
The play is simplicity itself. It dwells on the interplay among young Melody (a 
weak Kathy Fleig), who is there mostly to wave flirtatiously to her favorite 
player and show off as much of her bod as she can pretend she wants to tan; 
Greg (a very good Keith Grant), the blind fan who "sees" it all by staying 
tuned into the radio but "feels" it by being there; the blowhard Zig (Rob 
Slyker), known as Herb to his wife (Tina Bacon), who shows him up by showing up 
and knowing the game better than he does; Decker (Peter Nicholson), a snappy 
dresser and sharp bettor, slavishly shadowed by the nerdy Richie (Richard 
Catt); Marvin (Marc Castaldo), the snake in the grass who doesn't care how, who 
or what he bets on, as long as he wins, and cheerleader (Mark Murphy) who loves 
to provoke the players by shouting out secrets about their private lives. 
</P>
<P>
One would reasonably assume that director Ivan Spiegel, who has personally 
shepherded this production over the last 10 years, would give this anniversary 
celebration his best effort. But if what was on view Thursday is the best he 
has to offer (though the show is double-cast and there is an alternating team 
not seen by this writer), the Cubs are not the only ones striking out. 
</P>
<P>
The actors do a lot of inarticulate shouting. What there is of a plot becomes 
inexcusably hard to follow. Their hit-or-miss timing more often misses than 
hits. Character detail, the heart of this piece, is haphazard, and the staging, 
which has lost the play's rhythms, is devoid of the tenderness and subtleties 
that are essential subtext for such a sweet and simple text. 
</P>
<P>
This general disarray is matched in the technical department by a sound track 
(credited to Mantegna and giving every indication of being fully 10 years old) 
that is more a distracting hum than a realistic background show of enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
Times Theater Critic Dan Sullivan suggested in his 1980 review of this 
production that the unstated moral of this play is that "a real fan has got to 
care" and that "if we all cared it would be a better U.S.A." That goes double 
for theater. 
</P>
<P>
No one appears to have cared enough to keep this show's benchmarks up to snuff. 
Since it's been Spiegel's baby all along, the problem would seem to be his. 
This is a game whose bases are loaded, but whose manager's dropped the ball.

THE GUARD IN WATTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As an African-American resident of Watts during the 1965 uprising, my 
recollections of National Guard activities differ substantially from those of 
Duane Shelton (Letters, May 12). 
</P>
<P>
True to Bob Richardson's assertion in Irv Letofsky's May 3 "Reliving a 
Nightmare," the vast majority of guardsmen were from such places as Redwood 
City and Eureka and had little or no exposure to or understanding of 
African-Americans and our problems. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to former guardsman Shelton's statement that "we didn't shoot dogs, 
cats, or people for that matter," the record clearly shows that after the Guard 
moved in on Friday, Aug. 13, the death toll rose exponentially. Perhaps he 
feels this is some odd coincidence, but those of us who were there know better. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five years later, I am still haunted by the searing image of two of my 
neighbors lying dead in the street, their bodies riddled with bullet wounds as 
young guardsmen stood over them, magazines emptied, bayonets affixed, looking 
up at me quizzically, seemingly searching for answers. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Mr. Shelton can vouch for his own unit, but ignoring the actions of the 
remaining 14,000 guardsmen whose convoys patrolled the 54-square-mile area is a 
cruel distortion and a slap in the face to the many families who lost their 
loved ones during those long, hot days in August.

I am an old man. All my life I've been an avid reader, and I can state I have

If anything, it only furthered my belief that the death sentence is just and

NEA COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Credit where credit is due: Allan Parachini is doing a magnificent job covering 
the National Endowment for the Arts censorship issue. He's presented the facts 
and gotten material no one else has -- for example, the recent interview with 
the NEA's top lawyer about the constitutional problem of prior restraint and 
the story about debarment. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times doesn't seem to think that news about the politics of 
culture belongs in its culture section; fortunately for us, the L.A. Times 
does.

NEA COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Judging by the letters to the editor, some readers would prefer to "kill the 
messenger" by attacking Parachini's coverage of the NEA controversy. Parachini 
is criticized for posing the debate in terms of "censorship" rather than 
congressmen "protecting the taxpayers" and for labeling the American Family 
Assn. as fundamentalist. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, those who seek to impose content restrictions on recipients of NEA 
grants would prefer to avoid the stigma of censorship. But in 1972, the Supreme 
Court held that the government "may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis 
that infringes his constitutionally protected interests, especially his 
interest in freedom of speech." The government can no more prohibit NEA grants 
for sexually explicit art than it can restrict religious exemptions to only 
Episcopalians or Social Security benefits to only Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
And as far as the American Family Assn. is concerned, Parachini is certainly 
not alone; The New York Times (May 16) called it "a fundamentalist religious 
group." Its spokesman, the Rev. Donald Wildmon, states that somebody's values 
are going to dominate and asks asked whether these values will be humanistic or 
Biblical. 
</P>
<P>
As a constitutional lawyer who has followed this issue closely, I consider 
Parachini's reports to be objective and well-balanced.

BUSHNELL'S THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We were appalled by reading in Stage Watch recently of Bill Bushnell's latest 
ravings and demands for another $32 million from the Community Redevelopment 
Agency for his L.A. Theatre Center debacle -- and later that Mayor Tom Bradley 
still backs funding. 
</P>
<P>
A self-appointed savior of theater here, Bushnell never has had the slightest 
inkling of what it takes to attract an audience anywhere, no less to the 
entrails of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
His pretentiousness of product, posing as "theater," has always been a turn-off 
to audiences seeking any pure entertainment value for the inflated price of 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
His "art and education" drivel is an arrogance topped only by his statement 
"the community doesn't know what it wants. . . . It's my responsibility to put 
on these stages what I want to see done." What conceit! Especially when it's 
exactly that "community" -- or more precisely the Community Redevelopment 
Agency -- he wants all those millions from! Give us a break, please!

Two articles in the May 19 Times, when juxtaposed, reveal the incongruities in 
our social values and standards. The first was Rosenberg's, in which he wrote 
"the public has the right -- perhaps even the obligation -- to watch" televised 
executions. 
</P>
<P>
The second dealt with Culver City school officials banning the story of "Little 
Red Riding Hood" because some believe the version in question may encourage 
children to drink. 
</P>
<P>
What bizarre social values do we express when we would ban a fairy tale because 
it allegedly encourages the drinking of alcohol and yet we would consider 
televising the execution of a human being? 
</P>
<P>
Will state-sponsored executions supplant the lottery as the most popular form 
of government-sponsored entertainment while the state surreptitiously censors 
books it sees as detrimental to society?

MELLOW ECLECTICISM FROM GUITARIST HIRAM BULLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hiram Bullock was feeling mellow. He made that clear from the start of his 
opening set Thursday night at Santa Monica's At My Place. 
</P>
<P>
A veteran of the David Sanborn and Gil Evans orchestras, as well as the David 
Letterman show house band, the guitarist moved easily across most of the 
current musical categories -- from funk and rock to jazz and soul. The result 
was eclecticism of the first order, some of it tongue in cheek, some of it 
deadly serious, and virtually all of it mellow. 
</P>
<P>
Among the humorous highlights were Bullock's laid-back vocalizing on "A Little 
Bit" and "Groovy, Groovy" (with a rhythmic drive that was true to its name), 
and bassist Steve Logan's raucous romp through "Funky Chicken." But a ballad, 
"Angelina," was less appealing; its smooth-limned melodic line didn't seem to 
fit into Bullock's still modest interpretive vocal range. 
</P>
<P>
He was much better when he got down to some serious guitar playing on the final 
few numbers -- notably an unidentified fusion piece and two extended 
improvisations on "Dear Prudence" and "Ode to Billie Joe." Bullock's tendency 
to play to the crowd did not obscure his energetic technique, colorful melodies 
and rich assortment of passing harmonies. 
</P>
<P>
Keyboardist Scott Brown and drummer Steve Wolf spent most of their time 
supporting the musical interactivity between Bullock and Logan. But given some 
open space toward the close of the set, they responded like world-class 
sprinters at the crack of the starter's gun. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's solo was a virtual nonstop, right-hand tour de force, snapping out his 
lines at a breathtakingly rapid pace. Wolf, who had appeared somewhat chaotic 
earlier in the evening, brought everything together with a collection of 
percussive sounds -- both live and sampled -- fascinating enough to offset the 
curse of the set-ending drum solo. 
</P>
<P>
"Mellow" is what Bullock started with, and "mellow" is what seasoned most of 
his performance. But "mellow" wouldn't have worked without the high-voltage 
intensity that is an intrinsic part of all his music. DON HECKMAN

CALLING CARDS LEFT IN BAR BY HORSES

<P>
Police were looking Friday for a couple of mischievous beer drinkers -- and 
their horses -- who got carried away in an Ojai bar earlier this week. But they 
are not quite sure what to charge them with if they are found. 
</P>
<P>
A man and a woman on horseback stopped by The Hub in the 200 block of East Ojai 
Avenue on Wednesday, said Bonnie Dohrn, a dispatcher for the Ventura County 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
While the woman waited outside, the man ordered two beers to go, Dohrn said. 
Then they rode off, leaving horse droppings behind, she said. Patrons of the 
bar cleaned up the mess in front of the building, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Larry Weimer said about 10:30 p.m. the couple trotted their horses into the 
bar, ordered two beers to go and "how can I say this? The horses made a mess on 
the floor." Then they left through the back door. 
</P>
<P>
"They're still trying to get the stains out of the carpeting," said Jim Beard, 
husband of bar owner Leah Beard. 
</P>
<P>
Beard said he and his wife know the man on horseback but identified him only as 
"Old Cowboy Jack." The Beards do not plan to press charges. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been friends with him for 25 years. He's a real nice guy. Well, he can 
be a jerk too," Jim Beard said. 
</P>
<P>
Beard said Cowboy Jack was trying to impress his new girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was funny," Beard said. "He's 52 years old. He knows better." 
</P>
<P>
Although police say the case is still under investigation, Weimer said, "I'm 
not sure that there's even a violation of a law unless it's a health and safety 
law." KIM KASH

2 HELD IN BEATING ATTACK ON FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Oxnard residents were being held Friday on suspicion of attacking a family 
with weightlifting belts, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Sabino Ortega, 21, and Angel Gonzales, 19, were being held in Ventura County 
Jail in lieu of $10,000 bail each. 
</P>
<P>
They were arrested earlier this week in the 500 block of Cuesta Del Mar in 
Oxnard and charged with assaulting three residents with weightlifting belts 
they took from around their waists, said Oxnard Police Sgt. Frank Devorick. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Marie Flores, 49; her son Jose Flores, 23, and daughter Marylena Flores, 
27, were in their apartment when three men came to the door and challenged them 
to a fight, Devorick said. The men attacked the family with fists, then removed 
heavy leather weightlifting belts from their waists and used them as weapons, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Marylena Flores lost several teeth when she was struck by a belt, Devorick 
said, and the other injuries were minor. Other members of the Flores family 
restrained two of the men until police arrived, but one man fled. 
</P>
<P>
Motive for the attack is unknown, Devorick said. There is no indication that it 
was gang-related, he said.

5TH ANNUAL FREE RECYCLING DAY SET

<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands Oaks officials are hoping to collect more than 181 tons of trash at 
the fifth annual Community Clean-up and Recycling Day today. 
</P>
<P>
The effort, jointly sponsored by the city and the Ventura Regional Sanitation 
District, includes free recycling operations at Thousand Oaks, Newbury Park and 
Westlake high schools from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Grahame Watts, the city's recycling coordinator, said workers and volunteers 
will collect glass, plastic, metal, newspapers, tree trimmings and most 
household refuse. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial users are not invited to participate, and no hazardous materials are 
allowed. 
</P>
<P>
Watts said motor oil can be disposed of from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. the first 
Thursday of each month at the municipal services facility at 1851 De Havilland 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Watts said last year that the city collected 74 bins -- 181 tons of trash. He 
said he had no estimate on how much refuse was recycled and how much went to 
landfills, but that an increasingly large portion has been recycled each year.

RESIDENTS OPPOSE WATER TANK PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET BERGAMO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A report declaring that a proposed 3-million-gallon water storage tank in 
Fillmore would have no significant impact on the environment is being 
vigorously contested by neighboring residents. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council listened to testimony earlier this week from about a dozen 
residents who live on Foothill Drive and oppose installation of the tank 
because they said it would be unsightly and vulnerable to earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
The current proposal calls for all trees and shrubs to be removed from the site 
and new vegetation to be planted after the tank is constructed. 
</P>
<P>
After listening to the complaints, the council asked the landscaping firm and 
project engineers to present alternative plans designed to preserve as many of 
the existing trees as possible. 
</P>
<P>
The council will listen to additional public testimony June 12. 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, Fillmore planners have examined eight sites for the tank, 
which officials say is necessary to meet peak demands of up to 4 million 
gallons per day. The storage capacity of two existing reservoir tanks is 2 1/2 
million gallons, which exceeds the current average daily consumption but cannot 
meet heavy demands, such as those caused by a major fire. 
</P>
<P>
William Winterstein, a Foothill Drive resident, presented a petition signed by 
61 residents who oppose the proposed tank because they say a nearby existing 
tank is an environmental eyesore. 
</P>
<P>
Under a proposal by a landscape architect, oaks, pines and peppertrees planted 
40 years ago would be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Fremlin Cox, whose family owns the site, told the council, "The owners 
aren't happy about the city's plans for a 'tank farm' on Foothill. Since the 
city plans to take the property by eminent domain, the least you could do is 
save those trees." JANET BERGAMO

DISTRICT TO STOP PAYING FOR USED NEWSPAPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Newspapers won't be worth even a penny to the Ventura Regional Sanitation 
District starting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its goal of recycling papers to reduce trash, the sanitation district 
announced Friday that it can no longer afford to provide a major incentive to 
recyclers -- cash. 
</P>
<P>
The sanitation district, the last recycler in the county to pay for used 
newspapers, said it will no longer pay the $4 per ton it has been offering. 
</P>
<P>
District officials said, however, that they will continue to accept newspapers 
at the Oxnard landfill from people who are willing to recycle without payment. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Ewens, resource recovery manager for the district, said the measure could 
reduce the volume of newspapers that are diverted from the landfill to the 
recycling center. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of customers who bring large volumes of paper in are nonprofit clubs 
who collect old newspapers to raise money, he said. The district paid out $226 
to newspaper recyclers last month. 
</P>
<P>
"All we can hope is that they will continue to do it from an environmental 
effort," Ewens said. 
</P>
<P>
The district, a public agency supported in part by tax dollars, set recycling 
as a high priority this year in an effort to extend the life of the Bailard 
Landfill in Oxnard, which the district operates. 
</P>
<P>
The landfill's permit expires in 1993, and the county does not yet have an 
approved site for a replacement landfill for the western part of the county. 
</P>
<P>
Recycling efforts will prevent the landfill from filling by 1993 and will allow 
the district to continue using the site if it can get the required permits, 
district officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
The sanitation district and other recyclers receive about $20 per ton for the 
newspapers they send to Golden State Fiber, a paper recycler in Pomona that 
produces newsprint from recycled paper. 
</P>
<P>
But rising labor and transportation costs make newspaper recycling a losing 
proposition, said Ewens and private recycler John Evetts. 
</P>
<P>
"If you figure in the hauling costs, I lose money on it," said Evetts, who 
operates D &amp; J Recycling Service in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
It is unfair, Ewens said, to use taxpayer money to continue paying for 
newsprint when other recyclers pay nothing, even if the net result reduces the 
volume of trash. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not appropriate for us to keep absorbing a loss, particularly when it 
places us in competition with private recyclers," Ewens said.

SAN DIEGO, MEXICAN DANCERS TO COLLABORATE SOUTH OF THE BORDER

Despite San Diego's proximity to Tijuana, cross-cultural exchanges with Mexican 
artists have been few and far between. But this weekend, some of those 
invisible barriers will begin to crumble when Three's Company -- San Diego's 
leading modern dance troupe -- joins forces with 15 dancers from the other side 
of the border. The one-night stand is scheduled for 7 p.m. Sunday at the 
Tijuana Cultural Center. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done five or six performances in Mexico," said Jean Isaacs, the troupe's 
bilingual artistic director. "But this is the first time we're actually working 
with Mexican dancers." 
</P>
<P>
The impetus for the cross-cultural collaboration was a $4,000 grant from the 
city of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I never expected to get it," Isaacs said, "because I'm not an ethnic artist. 
But the grant is really doing what it's supposed to do -- encourage 
multicultural activity. We have quite a few men and women coming up to our 
studio to take class with me as a result of our work there, and Ricardo Peralta 
(one of the Mexican dancers involved in the project) has asked permission to 
use my work for his company. I never give my pieces away, but, since they don't 
have any money, I donated it." 
</P>
<P>
Isaacs credits Miriam Soto, a Mexican part-time student of Three's Company's, 
for encouraging her to take the troupe into these uncharted waters. 
</P>
<P>
"Miriam made it happen," recalled Isaacs, who also has an undergraduate degree 
in Spanish literature. "She said, 'You speak Spanish, you should teach modern 
dance technique in Mexico.' I applied for the grant, and now, Miriam is the 
paid coordinator of this project." 
</P>
<P>
With support from the Mexican government in the form of free facilities, Isaacs 
began training the dancers a month ago for the performance. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mexican dancers haven't had much modern dance, but they have good 
classical training," Isaacs noted. "And they are very grounded dancers. They 
understand the sense of weight this kind of dance requires. We sit and talk, 
and some of them tell me, 'Hey, this has really changed my life.' I really wish 
we could keep this going. There's so much to do. 
</P>
<P>
"They're getting support and attention from the media in their own community as 
a result of this concert. We can't let it end with this performance." 
</P>
<P>
When Isaacs began training dancers in Tijuana, she had low expectations. 
However, the teacher was pleasantly surprised by what she found out about her 
well-motivated students. 
</P>
<P>
"I found the technical level quite high, and they all look good on stage 
because they have an innate dramatic sense that compensates for any (kinetic) 
weaknesses," Isaacs said. "Dance is a strong part of their culture, and they 
just 
</P>
<P>
understand it." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, instead of a choreographing a watered-down dance for the fledgling 
modern dancers, Isaacs taught them the most challenging piece in her repertory 
-- adjusting the designs to accommodate the contingency of men among them. 
</P>
<P>
To help ensure the future of Mexican-American cultural relations -- at least in 
the field of modern dance -- Isaacs and her dancers have extended their 
involvement well beyond the terms of the grant. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone in our company is working for minimal salaries," she explained, "and 
we've given the Mexican students scholarships to study with us in San Diego. We 
had to, because they couldn't afford the lessons otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
Isaacs is eager to take Three's Company back to Mexico again, but the dance 
maker is even more excited about the new talent she discovered south of the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to find some way for Ricardo (Peralta) to show his work here," she 
vowed. "I'd like to do it, if we can fund it. It's too late for this year's 
low-tech (Three's Company's summer dance series in the studio), but maybe next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a real need for this," she said, referring to the cross-cultural 
training. "We're only 15 minutes away. There shouldn't be a border. 
Geographically, and culturally, it's all California.

STARLIGHT SHINES WITH A FIRST-RATE SONDHEIM 'FOLLIES'

<P>
Haunting, daunting and ravishing. That's what "Follies" is at the San Diego 
Civic Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Sondheim's tender ode to old entertainers and their memories marks a 
turning point for Starlight Musical Theatre, which has made its reputation on 
dependable if unremarkable productions of old warhorses like "Carousel," which 
will make its fourth outing at Starlight in July. 
</P>
<P>
Though Starlight, in its 45 years, had never tackled Sondheim, Sondheim 
aficionados need not worry. Top-notch casting, which ranks among Starlight's 
best, and sensitive direction by William Pullinsi, makes this story of retired 
performers haunted by memories of their youth a vibrant portrait of life that 
summons up tears and smiles, simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
As for Starlight patrons for whom a good show still means a sentimental story 
with hummable tunes, let "Follies" be your bridge to a fresh way of looking at 
the evolving American musical. The show is nearly 20 years old but new to San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Sondheim is not asking you to do away with old-fashioned entertainment in this 
show. He celebrates it by having the entertainers do period-style numbers such 
as "One More Kiss," "You're Gonna Love Tomorrow" and "Love Will See Us 
Through." 
</P>
<P>
But the difference between this show and the old standbys is that, instead of 
using art to while away your time, Sondheim fashions "Follies" into a great 
mirror that helps you look at your own life -- past, present and future. 
</P>
<P>
James Goldman's script is ostensibly about four long-retired performers -- Ben, 
his wife Phyllis, Buddy and his wife, Sally, all of whom grow to question their 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
The group is brought together at a final reunion with dozens of other singers 
and dancers who used to perform at the Weissman before the theater is to be 
demolished. 
</P>
<P>
The crumbling Weissman, often thought to be modeled on the old Ziegfeld 
Theatre, reflects the way our own bodies fade and will eventually fail over 
time. The poignancy comes from seeing the youth of these players' dream-selves, 
played by young actors, juxtaposed with the aging ones. 
</P>
<P>
Ben (played with ironic panache by Dennis Kelly) reaches out his arms for Sally 
(portrayed with exquisite radiance by Teri Ralston). But it is the young, 
dream-self of Sally (the irresistibly ingenuous Christine Hewitt) who comes to 
him for her kiss while the older Sally stands a few feet back with arms 
outstretched; thus we know that Ben is reaching out for the Sally of his youth, 
not of his present. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent and Vanessa (rendered with stylish flair by Starlight's co-artistic 
directors Don and Bonnie Ward) do a dance shadowed by their younger selves (the 
graceful Reina Bolles and Jason Gonzales). It tugs at the heart to see the 
young pair occasionally switch partners with their older and now-slowed 
counterparts in Danny Herman's graceful choreography. 
</P>
<P>
Among the many sumptuous delights of "Follies" comes from seeing seasoned 
performers sing some of Sondheim's best show-stopping numbers. It is worth 
catching the show just to hear the incomparable Marilyn Maye pour warm milk and 
honey over that marvelously bittersweet and funny ode, "I'm Still Here." 
</P>
<P>
Silver-haired Helen Geller, too, can stop traffic with her "Broadway Baby." 
Gloria Marinacci Allen brings fragility and unexpected depth of power to "One 
More Kiss" with Leslie Beauvais, complementing her beautifully as the young 
Heidi who joins her in a duet. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Beattie as Buddy, the performer turned salesman, sells "The Right Girl" and 
"Buddy's Blues" with a force that is uncannily at one with the character he 
plays. Old San Diego favorites Ole Kittleson and Pat White summon up old times 
with the old-fashioned number "Rain on the Roof." 
</P>
<P>
In "Follies," the crumbling set on which the Ghosts of Showgirls Past walk the 
boards plays as large a role as any of the characters; Ken Holamon's design, 
originally designed and built by and for the San Jose Civic Light Opera, brings 
the story of passing time home with a one-two punch. 
</P>
<P>
The one glaring hole in the technical support came from a sound system that 
brought unintentional humor when it crackled as some of the performers 
embraced. 
</P>
<P>
But despite such minor technical glitches, the only real folly in this 
"Follies" would lie in missing it.

KATYDIDS ARE POISED TO HOP TO THE TOP OF THE POP SCENE; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: FOR SINGER AND SONGWRITER SUSIE HUG, WHO GREW UP IN SAN DIEGO, THE 
ACCLAIM IS SOMETHING OF A SURPRISE.

<P>
Are the Katydids going to be the next Big Thing in pop music? 
</P>
<P>
The British rock press certainly thinks so. They went into a tizzy over the 
London-based band's debut single, "Lights Out (Read My Lips)," which was 
released last month in England only. 
</P>
<P>
"Two minutes of crisp, heart-stopping brilliance," said the New Musical 
Express. "The Katydids are the kiss-and-tell cousins of the Beatles, the 
Monkees and R.E.M.," according to a review in Melody Maker. "They summon up 
memories of time-locked perfect pop with nostalgic, jangly clarity." 
</P>
<P>
The folks at Reprise Records think so, too. Confident that a U.S. conquest is 
in the stars, they're supporting next Tuesday's release of the Katydids' debut 
album, produced by pop avatar Nick Lowe, with one of the most intensive -- and 
expensive-promotional campaigns in the label's history. 
</P>
<P>
But what is expected to be the latest chapter in the ongoing saga of the 
British invasion, which began in the early 1960s with the Beatles, is also a 
homecoming of sorts for Susie Hug, the Katydids' lead singer and co-songwriter 
(with guitarist Adam Seymour). 
</P>
<P>
Though born in Tokyo, Hug, 30, spent most of her life in San Diego. She was 
raised in Linda Vista and attended Mark Twain Elementary School, Montgomery 
Junior High, Kearny High and UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
But Hug was never a participant in the local original-music scene -- just an 
observer. In the early 1980s, she regularly hung out at the Spirit in Bay Park, 
watching such promising hopefuls as the Penetrators, Four Eyes, the Puppies and 
the Rick Elias Band. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to go see bands, but I wasn't doing music at all," Hug recalled in a 
telephone interview from New York City. "And while I remember thinking it would 
be great to be in a band, I never even thought, for a moment, that it would one 
day become a reality. 
</P>
<P>
"I was too busy with school, studying art and film. I used to write little 
tunes to go with the 16-millimeter films I made, but nothing to the extent I'm 
doing now, which completely took me by surprise." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. Even after graduating from UCSD with a fine arts degree four years ago 
and moving to London to be closer to her parents, who live in Scotland, Hug 
said, she had no intentions of pursuing a career in music. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to get involved in movies some way. I started as a receptionist at a 
medical film company, hoping to get into editing, but it was pretty bad -- I 
couldn't handle films about hip operations, stuff like that. 
</P>
<P>
"After three months, I left and found a new job as film librarian with an 
advertising agency. It was better, but it still wasn't completely satisfying, 
so I started doing music as a hobby. 
</P>
<P>
"I bought a guitar and taught myself some chords, just as something to do after 
I got off work and on weekends, and I liked it a lot more than being a film 
librarian." 
</P>
<P>
Before long, Hug recalled, she began singing and writing songs, and, in late 
1987, she did her first session, backing pop duo Big Bam Boo. 
</P>
<P>
"I had had no other experience, being in the studio before," she said, "and it 
was all guys -- I was the only girl." 
</P>
<P>
One of those "guys" was Adam Seymour, a fellow upstart singer, guitarist and 
songwriter. 
</P>
<P>
"We got to talking, and sort of as mutual encouragement, he said, 'Play me your 
stuff and I'll play you mine,' just to see what the other person was doing," 
Hug said. 
</P>
<P>
"It ended up, I really liked the songs he was writing, and he really liked the 
things I was doing. We discovered that we shared the same musical tastes, so we 
decided to get together after the session. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time we did, we each played some tapes and then wrote three songs 
together; they sounded great, so we thought, 'Let's write some more songs, demo 
'em up, and see what happens.' " 
</P>
<P>
What happened was a big-time management deal and a suggestion "that we put 
together a band so we could have real-life instruments play the stuff on our 
demo tape for which we'd used a drum machine, things like that," Hug said. 
</P>
<P>
Hug and Seymour promptly recruited "several musician friends we knew," she 
said, and ,in the summer of 1988, began gigging around the London club scene as 
the Katydids. The band wanted a bug name because one of their favorite groups 
had a bug name: the Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
"Initially, we played the real dives of London, hellish clubs with slime on the 
wall and maybe two people in the audience," Hug recalled. "But it was good, 
especially for me, because, even if nobody was there, we got experience playing 
live -- something I'd never done before." 
</P>
<P>
Within a year, the Katydids had recorded a band demonstration tape, which they 
submitted to "Demo Clash," a British radio show on which unsigned bands' demos 
are aired and voted on by listeners. 
</P>
<P>
After trouncing the competition for five straight weeks, Hug said, "they kicked 
us off, and from that point on, everything just sort of built up." 
</P>
<P>
The Katydids quickly became one of the top-drawing club bands in London. They 
hit the road, opening for Squeeze and Del Amitri, and, last August, signed a 
lucrative recording contract with Warner Brothers/Reprise Records. 
</P>
<P>
"They asked us who we wanted to produce our first album, and our first choice 
was Nick Lowe," Hug said. Lowe -- whose prior production credits include albums 
by Elvis Costello, Graham Parker, the Fabulous Thunderbirds, Paul Carrack and 
the Damned -- "hadn't produced anything in a long time," Hug said, "and we had 
to explain to him that we weren't a typical British drum-machine or computer 
band. 
</P>
<P>
"We told him we wanted real instruments hit by real people, clear and pure, 
and, after we played him some songs on acoustic guitar, he said real modestly, 
'Um, if you're still interested, I'd like to produce you.' " 
</P>
<P>
"And we thought to ourselves, 'God, we don't think he realizes he's Nick Lowe 
-- he's got no ego at all.' "

A company whose truck plowed into a school bus, knocking the vehicle into a 
water-filled pit near Alton, Tex., and killing 21 students, has agreed to pay 
$72 million to 16 of the victims' families. The settlements call for Valley 
Coca-Cola Bottling Co. to pay $4.5 million per death, lawyers for the families 
and the company said. Parents will receive the bulk of the money, but some of 
it will go to trust funds valued from $50,000 to $250,000 established for 30 
surviving brothers and sisters, lawyers said.

Bronx County Court Judge Barry Salman ruled that Bernhard H. Goetz cannot 
interrogate one of the 1984 subway shooting victims who is suing Goetz for $50 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Goetz asserted that Darrell Cabey is not the "mental vegetable" he claims to 
be. At a news conference, Goetz handed out a videotape of an interview with 
Cabey last December in which Cabey appeared coherent. Cabey was left partially 
paralyzed and was in a coma for two months after the shooting. Goetz has filed 
a $100-million counterclaim against the teen-agers he shot when he thought they 
were about to mug him.

A freighter collided with a brace of barges on the Mississippi River near the 
New Orleans French Quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The accident tore the ship open and it dumped 60,000 gallons of fuel oil that 
formed a slick 60 miles downstream. Workers were transferring the ship's 
remaining fuel to other tanks and shifting cargo and ballast to keep the damage 
above the water line. A number of communities including New Orleans draw their 
drinking water from the river. But the accident happened below the New Orleans 
intakes and only threatened one intake: for the town of Pointe a La Hache, 
officials said.

The Census Bureau said it has counted 81% of the nation's estimated 106 million 
housing units. 
</P>
<P>
It was the most positive report to date of the much-criticized 1990 census. 
Troubles began when the first phase of the national head count ended April 24 
with only 63% of the nation's housing units returning the census form. Since 
then, thousands of census takers have fanned out across the nation, knocking on 
the doors of those homes that either did not receive a mailed form or failed to 
return one. According to the new figures, Puerto Rico tops the completion rate 
with 98.3%

EAGLE ROCK STUDENTS PROTEST VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

An Eagle Rock High School student was stabbed as he stood outside the campus 
Friday, just hours after more than 150 classmates walked out of their classes 
to protest what they said was increasing campus violence and a weak school 
district policy for disciplining students who carry weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Students who witnessed the attack, which occurred shortly after classes ended 
at 3 p.m., said four gang members knocked down the 16-year-old student, then 
stabbed him three times in the back and once in the head. 
</P>
<P>
But Sgt. Roman Fromm of the Los Angeles school district police said the student 
was treated and released at a Glendale hospital for a minor head wound. Los 
Angeles police and fire officials confirmed that the incident was gang-related, 
but could not provide further details. 
</P>
<P>
The student walkout earlier in the day was organized after a 14-year-old 
student was stabbed Wednesday on the campus in northeast Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The nightmare continues at a campus that's had little violence up until this 
year," said Rudy Cordero, a history teacher who supported the walkout. "It's 
horrible." 
</P>
<P>
Eagle Rock students left their classes at 11:30 a.m. Friday and gathered in the 
middle of campus. Students and parents who helped organize the hourlong walkout 
called on the Los Angeles Board of Education to reconsider its rejection of a 
proposal to automatically expel students found with weapons at school. 
</P>
<P>
"We want a safe place, we want a safe environment," said Suraya Fadel, Eagle 
Rock's student body president, as classmates chanted, "No more weapons!" 
</P>
<P>
Students said they will protest again next week by wearing black armbands to 
the school, which has an enrollment of 2,500. Parents and teachers are 
circulating petitions to urge the Board of Education to reconsider its 
decision, Cordero said. 
</P>
<P>
District officials said the protest was the first over the board's May 7 
decision. Board members voted 6 to 1 against a measure that would have expelled 
any student caught with a weapon at school, with no exceptions. Members at the 
time said the measure was too broad and restrictive. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of board member Leticia Quezada, after receiving a call from 
parents, agreed Friday to meet with administrators and parents next Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Until this school year, Eagle Rock High School, with one security guard 
employed by the district, had experienced little campus violence, said 
Principal John Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
But since September, four students have been arrested for carrying guns in 
school. In March, a 10th-grade boy was stabbed by two classmates in a 
gang-related incident. Authorities treating the victim discovered that he was 
carrying a pistol, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
And on Wednesday, an eighth-grade girl was stabbed at the school. She told 
authorities she was attacked in a girls' restroom by two male students. 
Administrators, however, said she may have been trying to kill herself. 
</P>
<P>
Despite uncertainty about that incident, students said they believe it was a 
gang-related attack and an indication that campus violence is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't feel safe anymore when we come to school," Fadel said. "We want 
something done."

<P>
7 CANDIDATES SUCCEED IN STIRRING UP ONLY YAWNS OF INDIFFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County assessor candidate Jay Curtis last week stood on a lonely 
Hollywood street corner preparing to announce a plan to rewrite a section of 
Proposition 13 that allows different taxes to be levied on similar properties. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis carefully chose a site only a few blocks from TV stations, with a good 
visual backdrop of similar houses that have different tax rates. But no one 
showed up. Even a dog running loose in the neighborhood ignored the event. 
</P>
<P>
"You talk about rejection," Curtis lamented. "The dog wouldn't even come up and 
let us pet him." 
</P>
<P>
Much like comedian Rodney Dangerfield, the seven contenders for the 
low-visibility assessor's job clamor for respect, but they are encountering 
apparent indifference. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis also was scheduled to speak earlier this week at the University Club, 
but the event was called off for lack of interest. Only a handful of people 
signed up to attend, the club manager said. 
</P>
<P>
In his first reelection bid, incumbent John J. Lynch faces six challengers, 
including four current or former employees of the assessor's office, in the 
June 5 election. 
</P>
<P>
The employees seeking the top job are Kenneth P. Hahn, Sid Delgado and John 
Carl Brogdon. Hahn is not related to County Supervisor Kenneth F. Hahn, who has 
endorsed Lynch. Lynch's former secretary, Monica Anderson, also is running. 
</P>
<P>
The other contenders are Joe Gardner, a retired county administrator, and 
Curtis, an attorney and president of the Los Angeles Taxpayers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The challengers contend that Lynch is a bully who has failed to get tax bills 
out on time. Lynch said he is a tough boss but fair. He blamed billing delays 
on problems with a computer system installed by his predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
If no candidate receives a majority of the vote, the top two vote-getters will 
face off in November. 
</P>
<P>
The assessor's race has been overshadowed by feisty battles for governor and 
attorney general. And the candidates themselves have not had much money to 
spend on campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Only Curtis and Lynch paid the $62,775 to publish a 200-word statement in the 
official sample ballot, which is sent to 3.8 million voters. 
</P>
<P>
"What price democracy, at $313.87 per word?" grumbled Brogdon, who said he 
could not afford the statement. His campaign has been limited to attending 
candidates' forums, buttonholing voters at shopping malls and handing out 
photocopied campaign flyers during theater intermissions. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify for the ballot, candidates had to collect 20 signatures and pay 
$953. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner also complained that he is having trouble getting support because 
voters mistakenly believe candidate Hahn is a relative of the popular 
supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn, the candidate, acknowledged that he expects to benefit from the 
well-known Hahn name, but said he makes it clear, when asked, that they are not 
related. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County assessor, who will earn $130,869 a year when the new 
four-year term begins Dec. 3, oversees the largest single property-taxing 
jurisdiction in the United States, in terms of land value. The assessor's chief 
task is to determine the tax bills for 2.2 million commercial and residential 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
Assessors lost much of their power in 1978 after voters approved Proposition 
13, which limited reappraisal to changes of ownership and new construction. 
Still, the Los Angeles County assessor, who oversees a staff of 1,600 and an 
$83-million annual budget, expects to review about 500,000 properties this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch acknowledged that the duties of his office are a mystery to much of the 
public. "I spend a lot of time telling people what I do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Lynch, a 14-year veteran of the lower ranks of the assessor's office, 
surprised himself by topping a field of 12 candidates to win the job vacated by 
Alexander Pope. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch, 53, did have some things going for him. He was a Republican Party 
activist in the San Fernando Valley who was endorsed by tax fighter Howard 
Jarvis, whose portrait now hangs on the wall above Lynch's desk. And he was one 
of only two candidates with a campaign pitch in the sample ballot. 
</P>
<P>
To get the statement in the ballot, Lynch filed an affidavit claiming he was 
indigent and unable to pay the cost of the statement. The county later rejected 
Lynch's claim, but it was too late to remove his statement from the booklet. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch said he did not learn until after the election that only those living 
below the poverty level are considered indigents. He said he has since paid the 
printing costs. 
</P>
<P>
During his first term, Lynch made headlines by throwing county auditors out of 
his office and being accused of assaulting an employee during a heated argument 
over the worker's union activities. Lynch denied the assault allegation. 
</P>
<P>
The worker filed a complaint with the Civil Service Commission, but the matter 
was dropped when Lynch agreed that there would be no reprisals against the 
employee, and the employee agreed not to file a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
In ordering auditors out of his office, Lynch contended that an audit was 
unnecessary because it would review only procedures established by his 
predecessor. In 1988, the county grand jury conducted a management review, 
which found millions of dollars in billing backlogs. Lynch blamed the backlogs 
on a computer system inherited from his predecessor, and said he has corrected 
most of the problems. A routine follow-up audit is planned, but is not expected 
to be completed until after the election. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch, who has been endorsed by Jarvis' widow, cited a reduction in taxpayer 
appeals as evidence that his office is operating effectively. He also noted his 
office each year has produced higher property tax rolls. 
</P>
<P>
A look at the challengers: 
</P>
<P>
* Anderson, 39, left the assessor's office in 1988 after working as executive 
secretary to Pope and Lynch. When she filed for the office in March, she called 
Lynch a "bully," and said she was "appalled at the way he treated taxpayers." 
But Lynch said Anderson once sent him a birthday card calling him "the best 
boss I ever had." 
</P>
<P>
* Brogdon, 61, supervising appraiser, is a 33-year veteran of the assessor's 
office. He pointed out that he has worked longer in the office than any 
candidate, including the incumbent. He also is a former Culver City councilman. 
</P>
<P>
* Curtis, 47, former chief tax counsel of the West Virginia State Tax 
Commission and former director of taxes for Pacific Enterprises, is making his 
first try for public office. He is now in private practice. Curtis has spent 
$40,000 of his own money on the campaign and raised another $50,000 -- more 
than any of the other challengers. 
</P>
<P>
He has proposed a complex plan to change the way property taxes are levied in 
the event of a successful court challenge to a section of Proposition 13 that 
requires new home buyers to pay higher taxes than longtime owners of similar 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
* Delgado, 51, a chief appraiser, is a 27-year veteran of the assessor's office 
who is the highest-ranking challenger. Delgado has been endorsed by the Service 
Employees International Union Local 660. 
</P>
<P>
A former assistant to Pope, Delgado ran against Lynch in 1986. After the 
election, Delgado said he was "exiled" by the new assessor to the South El 
Monte office. Lynch insisted that he has never retaliated against any political 
opponent in his office. 
</P>
<P>
* Gardner, 59, retired in 1984 after working for county government for 25 
years. He served as the Board of Supervisors' liaison to the county's 86 
cities. Gardner, president of the Baldwin Hills Estates Homeowners Assn., 
unsuccessfully ran for assessor in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
* Hahn, 50, an appraiser specialist who has been in the assessor's office 10 
years, is running for the first time. He joined the county 23 years ago as a 
social worker.

NAGOYA, Japan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ernest Borgnine is not big here. Charles Bronson, Elizabeth Taylor? Yes, of 
course. Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis? Maybe. 
</P>
<P>
Those conclusions emerged from a survey of about a dozen Nagoyans who passed 
through their city's central park on Friday afternoon as a replica of 
Hollywood's Walk of Fame was unveiled. 
</P>
<P>
A gift from the city of Los Angeles and its port, the Nagoya Walk contains 25 
stars engraved with the names of 25 major entertainers -- Borgnine included -- 
who also are memorialized in Hollywood's own version. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley and a delegation from the port of Los Angeles traveled to 
Nagoya for the ceremony Friday and were greeted with great fanfare. A marching 
band struck up the "Star Spangled Banner" and a bouquet of helium-filled 
balloons was set free to disperse above the treetops. 
</P>
<P>
But an uncomfortable undercurrent marked the visit, as reporters for local 
newspapers and television stations attempted to question Bradley about his role 
in an incident last month involving the then-president of Nagoya's city 
assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Yukio Umemura, who has since resigned, has been charged with shoplifting $450 
worth of merchandise from a duty-free shop at Los Angeles International 
Airport. Umemura was released without being charged April 14 after police were 
contacted by Bradley's office. 
</P>
<P>
Umemura was permitted to return to Japan, but last week was charged with a 
misdemeanor stemming from the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Disclosure of the matter has caused a sensation in Nagoya and prompted Umemura, 
57, to resign after more than 20 years on the council. 
</P>
<P>
Umemura, who has withdrawn from the public eye, has said that he has "lost 
everything," according to the Asahi Shimbun, a Nagoya newspaper. He told a 
reporter he was physically ill at the time of the incident and remembers little 
about it, the newspaper said. The reporters learned little Friday from Bradley, 
who refused to comment on the matter. Bradley has said that his office did not 
interfere in the case. 
</P>
<P>
A woman who answered the telephone at Umemura's home Friday said he was not 
there and that she did not know when he might return. 
</P>
<P>
Nagoya's mayor, Takeyoshi Nishio, on Friday called the matter "a terrible 
incident" and said, "I hope this won't change the relationship between our city 
and Los Angeles." For 30 years, Nagoya and Los Angeles have been sister cities, 
part of a program to promote cultural good will around the world. Los Angeles 
has 16 other sister-city relationships, but the one with Nagoya is the oldest. 
</P>
<P>
A munitions and aircraft manufacturing center during World War II, Nagoya was 
virtually leveled by American bombers. After the war the city underwent a 
remarkable regeneration and is once again an industrial center with a 
population of 2.2 million. The city's new Walk of Fame was placed in Hisaya 
Odori Park's Los Angeles Square in the center of the downtown area. The 
sidewalk containing the stars borders quiet fountains and waterfalls. 
</P>
<P>
Nagoya officials came up with the idea for a Walk of Fame replica and suggested 
it to Bradley, who pursued the idea, officials said. But there is some 
confusion about who actually selected the celebrities on whose names Nagoyans 
will tread. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles officials say Nagoya chose the celebrities from a list supplied by 
the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. Nishio said Friday he thought Los Angeles 
had chosen the names. He conceded that a few are not exactly household names in 
his city. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 25 celebrities, Borgnine, star of a fair number of World War II 
movies as well as television's "McHale's Navy" series, seemed to fare the worst 
in the informal poll Friday. None of those surveyed had heard of the 1955 
Academy Award winner, nor could they pronounce his name. 
</P>
<P>
Nobuko Uchikawa, head of the city's women's league, studied a list of the names 
and reported that she recognized Audrey Hepburn and Charles Bronson; Borgnine 
and Anne Bancroft did not ring a bell. 
</P>
<P>
Three teen-age girls nodded enthusiastically at the name "Elizabeth Taylor" and 
said they were quite sure they recognized Shirley MacLaine, although they could 
not say exactly who she was. 
</P>
<P>
The square occupied by "Dean Martin" was carefully scrutinized by two men 
passing through the park. Unable to make sense of the English characters 
straight on, they changed angles and tried to read the name "nitraM naeD," to 
no avail. 
</P>
<P>
To the apparent delight of the crowd, Bradley, Mayor Nishio and Johnny Grant, 
chairman of the Hollywood Walk of Fame, strolled down the walkway wearing 
Stetsons. Meanwhile the Nagoya Fire Department marching band struck up a few 
choruses of "Zip-a-dee-do-dah." 
</P>
<P>
Walks of fame have become a kind of cottage industry for Grant, who repeatedly 
was described Friday by the Japanese hosts as the mayor of Hollywood, a 
misimpression no one bothered to correct. 
</P>
<P>
Grant recently dedicated a Walk of Fame in Rotterdam and said Friday he was 
heading off to do the same for a town in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"That name Hollywood!" Grant said. "I tell you, anywhere else it's magic -- 
except Hollywood."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WACHS URGES BAN ON USE OF AIRPORTS IN 
MEDFLY WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs on Friday proposed keeping city-operated 
airports off-limits to helicopters used by the state to spray residential areas 
with pesticide in the ongoing Medfly battle. 
</P>
<P>
He said the state, which recently moved its Southern California Mediterranean 
fruit fly helicopter operations from El Monte to the Riverside Municipal 
Airport, is interested in using the Van Nuys Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs said that residents, who have endured repeated sprayings of malathion, 
should not have to suffer also from having noisy helicopters taking off and 
landing in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Cooper, a spokesman for the state's Cooperative Medfly Project, confirmed 
that officials are negotiating with airport officials at Van Nuys. But he said 
the state does not expect to use the San Fernando Valley airport more than once 
or twice unless more Medflies are found in the Los Angeles area.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SEASON'S LAST CONDOR CHICK BREAKS OUT OF 
SHELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shatash, the last California condor of the 1990 breeding season, broke out of 
its shell early Friday at the Los Angeles Zoo, bringing the number of the 
endangered species to 40. 
</P>
<P>
Shatash, an American Indian term for condor, weighed a healthy 5.3 ounces when 
it emerged at 3 a.m., said Deborah Ullman Pollack, a zoo spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
"It got out of its shell all by itself and it's eating well," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Keepers were on hand to watch the final egg of the prolific 1990 season hatch. 
It took longer than usual without the assistance of humans, Pollack said, but 
it was necessary to keep human interference to a minimum because the zoo's 
objective is to eventually release the condor into the wild.

L.A. TO PAY RECORD $3.8 MILLION TO BOY HURT IN CITY VAN CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what is believed to be the largest settlement of its kind, the Los Angeles 
City Council on Friday approved a $3.8-million payment to settle a lawsuit 
brought on behalf of a boy who was severely injured when a city van driven by a 
part-time lifeguard crashed into a South Los Angeles home he was visiting in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sad, tragic situation," said Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who as 
chairman of the budget and revenue committee urged approval of the settlement. 
"The city believes that if this went to trial we could be risking a far greater 
amount of money." 
</P>
<P>
"The facts were bad and the injuries horrible," added Assistant City Atty. 
Michael K. Fox. "And this is the 1990s when a million dollars isn't what it 
used to be." Fox said he knew of no other single settlement that was larger. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Stolpman, an attorney representing 5-year-old Brian Casales, said he was 
pleased that the "city recognized its financial responsibility to this little 
boy" and his family. Under the agreement, Brian will receive $3.8 million in a 
trust and his sister, Elizabeth, 11, who suffered lesser injuries, will receive 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
The children were inside their baby-sitter's South Los Angeles home a few doors 
away from their own house near 70th and San Pedro streets on June 24, 1985, 
when the city van crashed into the front of the house, according to the city 
attorney's report presented to the council. The front of the house and part of 
the roof caved in and Brian's skull was crushed. 
</P>
<P>
Brian, who was 8 months old at the time, suffered brain damage, according to 
attorneys for both sides. He was left virtually blind on the left side, and has 
severe atrophy in his left lower leg. His left hand is essentially unusable and 
he requires further surgery. The boy still wears diapers and crawls, Stolpman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police that Shawn Jordan, 19, was driving at more than 60 m.p.h. 
in a 25-m.p.h. zone when he lost control of the van. According to a police 
analysis of skid marks at the scene, he was going at least 55 m.p.h.

LABOR SHORTAGE AIDS NURSES IN WALKOUT AT KAISER HOSPITAL; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH CARE: NO NEGOTIATIONS SET AS STRIKE HITS TWO-WEEK MARK. ALLEGATIONS 
TRADED OVER WHETHER THE QUALITY OF CARE HAS DROPPED. 
</P>

<P>
Usually when a strike drags on for two or three weeks, employers begin to feel 
they have the upper hand. Workers begin getting nervous and worrying about next 
month's mortgage payment. Some begin to trickle back across the picket line. 
</P>
<P>
But the nationwide shortage of nurses apparently has wiped out that traditional 
management advantage in the strike by 900 registered nurses at Kaiser 
Permanente's Sunset Boulevard medical center in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The strikers -- easily able to find temporary work through scores of placement 
firms that fill daily vacancies in Southern California hospitals -- are 
sweating nary a drop. As a result, the 13-day-old work stoppage at the 600-bed 
hospital, the high-tech jewel of Kaiser's Southern California hospital network, 
seems likely to drag on for months. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not worried at all. We have plenty of work," said Gloria David on Friday 
as she carried a picket sign. 
</P>
<P>
"We recognized early on that this could be a long strike," Kaiser spokeswoman 
Janice Fowler Seib said. 
</P>
<P>
With no negotiations in sight, administrators and strikers traded allegations 
over whether the quality of care has dropped since the nurses walked out. 
</P>
<P>
Local 535 of the Service Employees International Union, which represents 
strikers at Kaiser Sunset and a small facility in Inglewood, called a press 
conference featuring two patients who believed that their cases had been 
mishandled by the Kaiser system during the strike. 
</P>
<P>
A Kaiser spokeswoman denied the claims and complained that the public was being 
"unnecessarily worried and frightened by the (striking) nurses' self-serving 
behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Nurses are striking the Sunset facility primarily because of Kaiser's attempt 
to roll back overtime premiums that in some cases pay nurses 2 1/2 times their 
base wage. 
</P>
<P>
The nurse shortage has enabled unionized nurses throughout the nation to obtain 
hospital contracts raising wages far beyond the cost of living, even though 
hospitals are under intense pressure to cut costs. Nurses contend that large 
raises are needed to encourage more people to enter the profession. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser, which pays its registered nurses about $40,000 a year after five years, 
followed this pattern earlier this year by approving a contract with another 
union -- United Nurses Assn. of California, an affiliate of the American 
Federation of State, City and Municipal Employees International -- for the 
4,000 nurses who work in eight of Kaiser's 10 Southern California hospitals. 
The United Nurses pact granted raises of at least 20% over three years. 
</P>
<P>
But the SEIU Local 535 prides itself on being a tougher bargaining organization 
than United Nurses and believes that nurses at Kaiser Sunset deserve even 
higher wages because they work in units that require more technical training, 
such as the bone marrow transplant unit and the cardiac surgery unit. SEIU 
sought 34% raises over three years. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser resisted and also made a pointed attempt to take back contract 
provisions on overtime. Premium overtime -- overtime paid at a rate of greater 
than time and a half -- has risen by 300% at Kaiser Sunset in the last three 
years, hospital officials say. "We want to bring (Local 535) back into line," 
spokeswoman Seib said. "The fact that we have a strike going on now underscores 
our determination to work toward controlling costs." 
</P>
<P>
Nurses, contending that the cuts in overtime effectively pared back most of the 
net wage increase that Kaiser was offering, struck on May 13. Kaiser responded 
by transferring about two-thirds of the Kaiser Sunset patients to other 
community hospitals or, in some cases, to other Kaiser hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
The strike, coming a month after an eight-day strike by 11,000 Kaiser clerical 
and maintenance workers throughout the Southern California system, rapidly 
turned contentious. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent evidence occurred Friday when Miriam Kavis, the mother of a 
premature infant born at Kaiser Sunset in February and transferred to Kaiser's 
West Los Angeles hospital two weeks before the strike began, appeared at a 
union press conference to complain about her daughter's care. 
</P>
<P>
Kavis said a data-monitoring and alarm machine attached to her daughter was 
unplugged at the West Los Angeles facility. Seib said the baby's health was not 
threatened by the incident. Kathy Sackman, president of the United Nurses 
Assn., which represents nurses at the West Los Angeles facility, said the 
machine in question was a backup unit and that the same mistake could have as 
easily have been made by nurses at Kaiser Sunset. 
</P>
<P>
But striking nurse Cathy Mitchell, who said she had taken care of Kavis' baby 
at Kaiser Sunset, said the incident illustrated the potential danger that 
Kaiser is risking by failing to settle with the nurses. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very badly about it because I'd rather be working . . . because I took 
care of that baby many times. . . . Do I feel guilty? Yes. But I'm not going 
back in there until we have a contract that's equitable," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Strikers have been angered by several mangement actions before and during the 
strike: 
</P>
<P>
* Three days before the strike began, Kaiser officials began discussing the 
possibility of cutting off the nurses' health benefits if they struck, 
according to an interoffice memorandum. That strategy has yet to be 
implemented. 
</P>
<P>
* Administrators also sent letters before the strike to Filipino nurses who 
held temporary-worker visas implying that their immigration status might be 
affected by their participation in a strike. The union subsequently sued the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service to block a new INS policy that 
discourages holders of temporary-worker visas from striking. The U.S. 
attorney's office responded by pledging this week that the policy will not be 
implemented in the Kaiser strike. 
</P>
<P>
* A picketing nurse was shoved by a Kaiser security guard a week ago during 
nighttime picketing.

D.A. WANTS MURDER CASE DROPPED BUT DEFENSE OBJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER and MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

<P>
Los Angeles County prosecutors on Friday unexpectedly requested the dismissal 
of murder charges against the lone survivor of a police shoot-out that left 
three robbers dead outside a McDonald's restaurant in Sunland last February. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Kenneth L. Barshop asked a San Fernando Municipal Court 
judge to dismiss the charges because prosecutors are uncertain they could prove 
that the defendant, Alfredo Olivas, provoked the shooting. Such a finding is 
necessary to convict Olivas of murder in the deaths of his accomplices, who 
perished in a hail of police gunfire after robbing the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Barshop would not specify what led him to believe Olivas may not have provoked 
the shooting, saying the information came from sealed police documents. 
</P>
<P>
Moments after Barshop's motion, Olivas' attorney, Deputy Public Defender Howard 
C. Waco, surprised the courtroom by objecting to the request. 
</P>
<P>
Waco declined to say why he wants prosecutors to proceed with the charges, 
which could result in his client's being sentenced to death if convicted. But 
he indicated that continuing the murder case will entitle him to information 
about police tactics in the shooting that would otherwise be unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing on Waco's objection was scheduled for Tuesday. Judge Stephen A. 
Marcus, who has presided over the case, said he intends to dismiss the charges 
unless Waco can show on the basis of previous court rulings that his objection 
is valid. 
</P>
<P>
Dismissal of the charges would spare the Police Department potentially 
embarrassing exposure of its officers' conduct during the shooting, Waco said 
later. 
</P>
<P>
The nine officers involved in the shooting are members of the department's 
Special Investigations Section, which has been criticized for following violent 
criminals but not arresting them until after robberies or burglaries occurred. 
. 
</P>
<P>
Barshop denied that public exposure of the department's tactics was a factor in 
the decision to drop the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Barshop said that even if the murder counts are dismissed, Olivas, who is 19, 
could spend the rest of his life in prison if convicted of the 19 assault, 
robbery and kidnaping counts still pending. 
</P>
<P>
Those charges stem from a string of at least nine similar robberies of 
fast-food restaurants that Olivas and his three companions allegedly committed 
in the Los Angeles area. It was in connection with those robberies that the 
Special Investigations Section was monitoring the group before the shoot-out 
early on Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting resulted in the deaths of Herbert Burgos, 27, and Jesus Arango, 
25, both of Venice, and Javier Trevino Cruz, 20, of Hollywood. Olivas was shot 
twice but recovered. 
</P>
<P>
The men were shot as they sat in their getaway car after robbing the Foothill 
Boulevard restaurant.

MELVIN DURSLAG: HITTING IMMORTALITY FOR A MAN NAMED FIELDER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN DURSLAG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Baseball in its time has survived its share of crises. It has survived a fixed 
World Series. It has survived an earthquake. It even has survived an announcer 
who used as his sign-off: 
</P>
<P>
"This is the old right-hander, rounding third and heading for home." 
</P>
<P>
The last, in particular, was painful, but baseball survived it. 
</P>
<P>
In an atmosphere of survival, it is surprising most of all that the home run 
standards of Babe Ruth and Roger Maris continue to survive through the changing 
times that have followed them. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth hit 60 homers in 1927. Maris hit 61 in 1961. All these years have passed 
-- and the achievement of neither has been matched, not Ruth's in a 154-game 
season, not Maris' in a 162-game season. 
</P>
<P>
And all the while, society has been bombarded with boasts of human advancement 
in sporting endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
Just the other day, for instance, a guy puts the shot a little under 76 feet. 
At the time Maris hits 61, guys are putting the shot maybe 65 feet. 
</P>
<P>
And when Ruth hits 60, they are muscling the shot 52 feet. 
</P>
<P>
But home run production for a single season? A bust. 
</P>
<P>
So now the argument begins. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know why someone hasn't caught Ruth or Maris?" a scholar asks. "Better 
pitching by guys helped by modern methods." 
</P>
<P>
"But if pitching has been improved by better coaching, better conditioning and 
better living habits," the pundit is asked, "why hasn't all this improved 
hitters, too?" 
</P>
<P>
Any case you want to make here on behalf of hitters isn't impressive, leading 
us to wonder today about batsmen named Cecil Fielder and Jose Canseco. Are they 
working up to something noteworthy, or are they teasing us in April and May? 
</P>
<P>
Fielder is an interesting study. Rising 6-feet-3, at 230 pounds, he experienced 
an undistinguished start in baseball, calling on such ports as Butte, Mont.; 
Florence, S.C.; Kinston, N.C., and Knoxville, Tenn., before being given a brief 
showing in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, he is in Syracuse, from where Toronto recalls him for another look. And 
do you know what it does then? It sells him to the Hanshin Tigers of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Doing well already on their purchase of Rockefeller Center, the Japanese make 
another score. Cecil Fielder smashes 38 home runs for Hanshin in 106 games. 
Folks in the town aim to elect him sheriff, if not lord mayor, but Detroit 
sneaks in and steals him as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
Now we are heading for Memorial Day, and Fielder has hit 17 home runs and 
Canseco has 18. 
</P>
<P>
A right-handed batter, Cecil hits home runs off right- and left-handed pitchers 
alike. And he hits a lot of bad pitches, which is what it takes to catch Ruth 
or Maris. 
</P>
<P>
You give a hitter the strike-zone eye of Ted Williams and he isn't going to 
swing often enough to punch out 60. 
</P>
<P>
A Detroit spokesman explains: "It is Cecil's position that any ball leaving the 
pitcher's hand has home run potential. 
</P>
<P>
"Does he hit screamers?" the man is asked. 
</P>
<P>
"No, mostly high flies. He does best on outside pitches on which he is able to 
extend his long arms." 
</P>
<P>
"Then why don't they pitch him inside?" the interrogator, a tactical genius, 
asks. 
</P>
<P>
"They did -- until he learned to pull the ball. Now if they pitch him inside, 
he is able to lift one past the left-field pole." 
</P>
<P>
At 26, Cecil doesn't pose as a student of technology, ascribing science to the 
art of belting homers. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of May 1961, Maris had hit 12 home runs. Ruth, in 1927, had hit 15. 
You come up with comparative timetables this early in the year and you usually 
go off a bridge. 
</P>
<P>
But, you presume, it eventually will happen that someone will take the measure 
of Ruth and Maris, whose records have stood too long. 
</P>
<P>
Could it be Canseco? We see him as too nervous and too prone to injury. 
</P>
<P>
What about Fielder? He is too new for a judgment to be made, but he has wide 
experience at dispensing home runs in the Pioneer League, South Atlantic 
League, Southern League, Venezuelan Winter League and Japanese Central League. 
</P>
<P>
Has he recognized that pitching is better in the American League? Sparky 
Anderson doesn't think so. But if it is, Sparky pleads with you not to tell 
Cecil.

BEACH VOLLEYBALL PROFESSIONALS PLAY IN VENICE BEACH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Professional beach volleyball will make its first stop of the season in 
Southern California this weekend when the Assn. of Volleyball Professionals 
Tour comes to Venice Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The $75,000 Venice Beach Open, a double-elimination tournament, begins today at 
9 a.m. The finals are scheduled for Sunday at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Sinjin Smith and Randy Stoklos, together for the last nine years, have been the 
most successful duo in the history of the sport and make up the top-seeded 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that we've been together and the fact that we've been playing so long 
are big pluses in our favor," Smith, 33, said. 
</P>
<P>
So is his consistency and the blocking ability of the 6-foot-4, 210-pound 
Stoklos. 
</P>
<P>
The two have five victories this season and lead in earnings with $75,850 
apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Still, parity has been making slow inroads on the tour, especially since 
Olympic gold medalist Karch Kiraly rejoined the beach circuit in 1988. Kiraly's 
partner has been 21-year-old Kent Steffes, and the two are ranked second with 
two victories and $42,600 apiece in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
However, on Thursday, Kiraly dropped Steffes in favor of Brent Frohoff for the 
Venice Open, an event they won last year. 
</P>
<P>
"They're an established team, they've won before," Stoklos said of 
Kiraly-Frohoff. "But the timing was very unusual. Kent Steffes and Karch -- 
they weren't playing that badly." 
</P>
<P>
Steffes will team with Sinjin Smith's younger brother, Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Hovland and Mike Dodd, last season's leading money-winners with eight 
victories and $164,000 apiece, have struggled this season but are coming off a 
victory over Smith-Stoklos and are presently ranked third. PETE THOMAS

BARNES AIMS FOR NEW MARK IN SHOTPUT

<P>
When Randy Barnes broke the world record in the shotput last Sunday at UCLA's 
Drake Stadium, he said it wasn't a "dream throw." 
</P>
<P>
He said he believes he can surpass his world record of 75 feet 10 1/4 inches, 
and he will get that opportunity today in the Bruce Jenner meet at San Jose 
City College. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes said he had a practice throw of 79-2 1/2 a few days before the meet at 
UCLA. He is the first American to hold the world shotput record since Terry 
Albritton in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
The Jenner meet was to have included two top Cuban athletes -- Javier 
Sotomayor, the world record-holder in the high jump at 8 feet, and Ana Quirot, 
top-ranked in the world in 1989 in the women's 400 and 800 meters. But the 
Cuban Athletics Federation, which had earlier agreed with TAC, the U.S. track 
and field governing body, to have the athletes travel from Brazil to San Jose 
to compete in the meet, said Friday that the U.S. State Department denied visas 
for the athletes. State Department officials said the visas were authorized 
Friday. The athletes instead went to compete in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Others who will compete include Hollis Conway, the American record-holder in 
the high jump at 7-10; Tony Dees, a sprinter-hurdler, and Algeria's Nourredine 
Morceli, who will compete at 3,000 meters. MAL FLORENCE

<P>
UCLA FRESHMAN THROWS ANOTHER SHUTOUT, 6-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA's Lisa Fernandez extended her scoreless inning streak to 50 as the Bruins 
defeated Cal State Long Beach, 6-0, Friday in the second round of the NCAA 
softball World Series at Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, a freshman from Lakewood St. Joseph High, gave up only four hits to 
earn her 11th victory in a row. 
</P>
<P>
She's 11-1. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore center fielder Yvonne Gutierrez, who was walked intentionally in her 
first two at-bats, went two for two, both doubles, and drove in three runs. Her 
fifth-inning double drove in the first two runs. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA (59-6), seeking its third consecutive national championship, has not given 
up a run in postseason play. The Bruins beat Northern Iowa, 2-0 and 4-0, in the 
West Regional, and in the first round of the Series Wednesday, they beat Kent 
State, 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was the first in the double-elimination tournament for Long Beach 
(48-18). The 49ers beat Nevada Las Vegas Wednesday, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV (41-26) stayed alive by eliminating Kent State, 5-2. A three-run double by 
Kim Harris in the fourth inning keyed the victory. Kent State finished 43-9. 
</P>
<P>
In another elimination game, Fresno State beat Arizona, 1-0. Fresno State is 
59-14; Arizona is 49-17.

Davis Pillsbury's Holua and Bob Doughty's Evolution won the first two races 
Friday, but Dennis Durgan steered Bob McNulty's defending champion Chance to 
consistent second- and third-place finishes to lead the 28th California Cup for 
ultralight 70s off Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
There are two more races today and one Sunday on windward-leeward courses of 
various lengths. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve boats are competing in the sixth year the Cal Cup has been staged 
exclusively for the sleds. 
</P>
<P>
Winds had been strong all week, a condition that favored Mitch Rouse's Taxi 
Dancer, which placed first on corrected time in the Transpac last year. But in 
breezes fading from only 10 knots to four Friday, the Reichell/Pugh 68, with Ed 
Lorence at the helm upwind, could manage only a fifth and a third. 
</P>
<P>
In Friday's first race of three laps and 18 miles, Bill Menninger steered the 
Santa Cruz 70 Holua past Ed McDowell's Grand Illusion on the downwind finishing 
leg to win by 1 minute 18 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
As the winds lightened, the second race was shortened to two laps and eight 
miles. Doughty, a Los Angeles furniture dealer, was on port tack at the first 
windward mark and had to yield right of way and duck behind the lead boats. 
Then he came from sixth place and passed Chance on the last leg to win by 13 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
The fleet split into two flights on the first day. Seven boats were still 
competitive, but the other five -- including 1985 winner Kathmandu and '87 
winner Ole (then Citius) -- appeared out of the running. 
</P>
<P>
Two-time winner Blondie, purchased by Long Beach businessman Peter Tong only 
two weeks ago, was in sixth place. RICH ROBERTS

FRESHMAN JONES OUTRUNS MILLER IN 100, 200 RACES

Nearly eight weeks ago, Inger Miller of Pasadena Muir earned the title of the 
state's top girls' sprinter by defeating Marion Jones of Oxnard Rio Mesa twice 
in the Arcadia Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
Since their April showdown, however, Miller has been hampered by an ankle 
injury that proved to be all the edge Jones needed in their rematch Friday 
night in the Masters' track and field meet before 5,560 at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, a 14-year-old freshman, avenged her early season losses to Miller by 
sprinting to victories in the 100 and 200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
In almost a repeat of their Arcadia matchup, Jones again got off to a fast 
start in the 100 meters. But, unlike in their first meeting, she was able to 
hold off a late-charging Miller to win in 11.64 seconds to 11.65. 
</P>
<P>
"That was best first 30 meters I ran all year," Jones said of the early part of 
her race. "I knew it was close there at the end because she (Miller) is not the 
type of runner who was going to stay back there." 
</P>
<P>
In the 200 meters, it wasn't close. Jones ran a personal best 23.70 seconds to 
defeat Miller, who clocked 24.27. 
</P>
<P>
"Since our first meeting, I've been working on not breaking down near the 
finish," Jones said. "Now, I know that I can beat her." 
</P>
<P>
With the first first five finishers in each event qualifying for the State meet 
June 1-2, Miller and Jones will meet again next week. 
</P>
<P>
"We just wanted her (Miller) to qualify," said Muir Coach Jim Brownfield, whose 
Mustangs won the team state title last season. "She was favoring her ankle (to) 
where she was not pushing off of it well. It is a minute-by-minute thing." 
</P>
<P>
Despite being slowed by her ankle, USC-bound Miller, who has the nation's top 
marks in both the 100 and 200 meters, ran the anchor leg in Muir's victory in 
the 400-meter relay. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Green of Long Beach Poly reinforced his position as the Southern 
Section's top boys' sprinter by winning the 100 (10.57) and 200 meters (21.26). 
</P>
<P>
Coley Candaele of Carpinteria was also a top qualifier in two events, winning 
in the 800 and 1,600 meters in come-from-behind fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Napoleon Kaufman of Lompoc also had busy nights, finishing second in the 100 
meters (10.60), third in long jump (22-10 3/4) and fifth in the 200 meters 
(21.74). 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne, which has won six of the last seven boys' team state titles, will 
not repeat as champion because of injuries, but it will have hurdler Demond 
Smith in two events in the state meet. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was impressive in finishing second to Andre Derezin of Muir in the 
110-meter high hurdles and second to Charles Johnson of Cajon in the 300-meter 
intermediate hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, four defending state champions were top qualifiers in their events 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Julian Yendork of Walnut, who won the girls' long- and triple-jump state titles 
last year, led qualifiers in both events with leaps of 19-feet-4 and 41-1 1/4 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The girls' 800 meters champion, Kim Toney of Atascadero won her specialty in 
2:08.11. The Arizona State-bound senior defeated Sheria Moses of Ramona by more 
than seven seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Felice Lipscomb of Santa Monica qualified to defend her 100-meter low hurdles 
title by winning in a time of 13.97 seconds, ahead of Kim Barnes of Fontana, 
who finished in 14.51. 
</P>
<P>
Twila Sims of Lompoc, the state 300-meter low hurdles champion, defeated 
Lipscomb in her specialty event, 42.29 to 42.30, after finishing third in the 
100 low hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
Deena Drossin of Agoura may not be a defending state champion, but she will be 
a force this year after winning the 1,600 meters in 4:54.71 and finishing 
second in the 3,200 in 10:42.40.

SUCCESS ENCOURAGES SPORT OF KINGS

<P>
Before May of 1989, Wayne Gretzky's interest in thoroughbred racing was 
limited. He paid some attention to the career of fellow Canadian Sandy Hawley 
and the Triple Crown, but that was about it. 
</P>
<P>
Hockey's Great One had never seen a race in person until last year's Kentucky 
Derby at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
After watching Sunday Silence beat Easy Goer in the first of their four 
meetings, Gretzky was hooked. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very emotional and very exciting," he said. "When the gates opened, it 
was one of the wildest things I'd ever seen. They've said it's the greatest two 
minutes in sports, and I guess I'd pretty much have to agree with that." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky's Derby companion was Bruce McNall, owner of the Kings. By his own 
count, McNall -- the man behind Summa Stable -- has had "thousands of horses." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Gretzky was to own his first horse, in partnership with McNall. The way 
their first collaboration has turned out, it's easy to understand why Gretzky's 
interest in the sport is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
Purchased almost a year ago in Europe after his second start, Golden Pheasant 
won once and placed in two other graded races before coming to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Since his arrival, the roan son of Caro has been perfect in two tries and has 
already stamped himself one of the nation's best turf performers. 
</P>
<P>
Impressive beating allowance rivals at Santa Anita, Golden Pheasant was equally 
dominant against Eclipse Award winner Steinlen and Classic Fame 13 days ago in 
the John Henry Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Golden Pheasant will go for three consecutive victories Monday in the $500,000 
Hollywood Turf Handicap. His main rival, now that Prized has been scratched, 
figures to be Hawkster. 
</P>
<P>
Having owned stars such as Trempolino, Dahar and Track Robbery, McNall 
definitely likes what he has seen of Golden Pheasant, who is trained by Charlie 
Whittingham. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he has every opportunity to be the best horse I've ever had, certainly 
in this country," McNall said. "It's very exciting for me. Charlie's very 
confident. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how good he is yet, but we'll find out a little more on Monday. 
From what I've seen, he's got all the potential. I've had a lot of horses, and 
I think he's right near the top." 
</P>
<P>
McNall was initially hesitant to buy the colt, even though he had finished 
second to Old Vic in the second race of his life. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't a great-looking horse, and he wasn't a horse who necessarily was 
proven at that level," McNall said. 
</P>
<P>
Bloodstock agents and racing managers Emmanuel and Laura de Seroux were 
convinced Golden Pheasant had the right stuff. "They've done great for us over 
the years, so I tend to go with them," McNall said. 
</P>
<P>
Credit Gretzky with an assist. Ever since the 1989 Derby, he had been eager to 
get involved in the sport. He helped persuade McNall to buy the horse. 
</P>
<P>
"Bruce had been telling me that one of the most important things about the 
horse business is that you have to be patient," Gretzky said. "I was anything 
but patient about Golden Pheasant. I kept pushing him on it. It's pretty 
exciting when you first get involved with horse racing that you can be involved 
with a horse like Golden Pheasant." 
</P>
<P>
Golden Pheasant hasn't been the only successful horse for Gretzky and McNall. 
Shining Steel won the Shoemaker Handicap earlier this month. Northern Glance, a 
daughter of Nijinsky II, broke her maiden at first asking the same day Golden 
Pheasant won the John Henry. Frankly Perfect won or placed in several stakes 
before breaking down in the San Juan Capistrano April 22. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to figure out how to explain to Wayne that not every horse wins 
graded races," McNall said. "So far, I've been unsuccessful. It's like starting 
out your first game winning the Stanley Cup finals. Where do you go from 
there?" 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky experienced the other extreme when Frankly Perfect was injured a couple 
of hours before the Kings' Game 3 loss to Edmonton. Still, Gretzky plans to 
increase his involvement. He has shares in eight thoroughbreds and a harness 
horse in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"When you see your horse win, there's an emotional high, just like there is 
when you win anything else," he said. "When you lose, obviously, there's 
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to think that when we lose a hockey game, I understand the reasons why 
or some of the reasons why. I'm still learning this business, and after a race 
is lost I'm still not sure of everything that happened or everything that went 
on. It'll take time to learn. You're not going to grasp it all in one year. I 
have a lot of years ahead of me to learn the whole business, and I'm enjoying 
it more every day. 
</P>
<P>
"Like I said two weeks ago, if you're going to get involved with something 
where you don't know a whole lot about it, you have to be patient and get 
involved with people who know what they're doing. 
</P>
<P>
"Bruce and his horse empire and the people who run it have been very 
successful, work very hard and know what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky's wife, Janet, and 17-month-old daughter, Paulina, saw Golden 
Pheasant's victory in the John Henry. 
</P>
<P>
"She loves animals and horses," Gretzky said of Janet. "We watched the replay 
of Golden Pheasant's last race about seven times, mostly because she kept 
wanting to see the horses run." 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham will also be represented in the two other stakes Hollywood Park is 
offering this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he will send out Warcraft against 10 other 3-year-olds in the $113,500 
Will Rogers Handicap at 1 1/16 miles on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
Beaten by a nose in the Spotlight Handicap in his first grass start three weeks 
ago, Warcraft is the co-highweight with Somethingdifferent, who was fourth in 
the Spotlight, at 120 pounds. Robbie Davis again will ride Warcraft. 
</P>
<P>
Making his first turf start will be Tsu's Dawning, who was a disappointment 
after looking as though he might be a Triple Crown prospect early in the year. 
Trainer Ed Gregson's colt has trained well on the surface and is bred to do 
well on it. He is a son of Tsunami Slew, who won this race in 1984 and the '85 
American Handicap over this course, and a half-brother to Zoffany, a multiple 
stakes winner on the turf. Gary Stevens has the mount. 
</P>
<P>
Others in the field include Single Dawn, who beat Pleasant Tap by a nose in the 
Hoist The Flag Stakes last fall in his only grass start; Itsallgreektome, who 
staged the upset in the Spotlight in his first race as a gelding; Mehmetori; 
Senegalaise; Robyn Dancer; Forth Niner Days, Green's Leader and Balla Cove. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, Whittingham's hopes in the $107,700 Gamely Handicap will rest with 
Dearly Loved. The beaten favorite in the Santa Lucia at Santa Anita in her 
first California outing, Dearly Loved was scratched from the Hawthorne Handicap 
a week ago in favor of the Grade I Gamely. She was fourth in her only other 
turf appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Dearly Loved will have only five opponents in the 1 1/8-mile race -- Beautiful 
Melody, runner-up to stablemate Reluctant Guest in the recent Wilshire 
Handicap, Stylish Star, Double Wedge and the Fabio Nor-trained entry of 
Estrella Fuega and Mamma Rosita.

IS DRUG EMPHASIS IN WRONG PLACE?; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: USOC DOCTOR SAYS TOO MUCH ATTENTION IS BEING PAID TO OVER-THE-COUNTER 
MEDICATIONS, RATHER THAN STEROIDS. 
</P>

A U.S. Olympic Committee doctor has admitted that mistakes have been made in 
the drug testing of American athletes. 
</P>
<P>
James C. Puffer, chief of family practice at UCLA and the head physician for 
the U.S. team in the 1988 Olympic Games, said this week at the American College 
of Sports Medicine's convention that too much emphasis is being placed on 
over-the-counter cold medications by The Athletics Congress, the national 
governing body for track and field. 
</P>
<P>
Although Puffer said there is evidence that athletes use cold medications to 
enhance performance, he believes that the thrust of TAC's program should center 
on anabolic steroid abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make a lot of sense to be chasing after people who inadvertently 
used cold preparations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Track and field officials recently suspended elite athletes Larry Myricks, 
Antonio McKay and Greg Foster for three months. The athletes allegedly tested 
positive for a banned substance called phenylpropanolamine, commonly known as 
PPA. Myricks said he had taken Alka-Seltzer, which contains the substance; 
Foster said he took vitamin pills that contained PPA, and McKay has not 
commented on his case. 
</P>
<P>
Puffer helped U.S. Olympic Committee officials develop their initial 
drug-testing program in the fall of 1983 after the Pan American Games at 
Caracas, Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
There, 17 athletes -- some from the United States -- tested positive for 
steroids, and many others suddenly left the competition once they realized that 
sophisticated testing was being used. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Puffer calls the USOC's original war on drugs "an absolute disaster." 
</P>
<P>
He said the program was organized to monitor athletes without punitive results. 
The idea was to educate athletes on the potential problems associated with 
steroids, such as liver cancer and heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
Athletes, however, used the medical information to determine when to stop using 
the drugs to avoid detection. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't get anybody off steroids," Puffer said. "We allowed them to feel 
much more comfortable with their use. 
</P>
<P>
"We grossly underestimated the extent of the problem. I don't think there is 
any doubt our initial efforts failed because we were naive. The athletes did a 
very good job of duping us. We had no real handle on how extensive the problem 
was." 
</P>
<P>
Before the Pan American Games, most of the international testing was shoddy, 
said Puffer, a member of the U.S. Olympic Committee's Sports Medicine and 
Science Committee. He said urine samples often were poured out after 
collection, a process cynics call the sink test. 
</P>
<P>
Puffer said random, unannounced testing will help eradicate steroid use, but he 
is no longer naive and does not believe that the problem is going to disappear 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Puffer engaged in a debate with Paul D. Thompson, a cardiologist from Brown 
University, on the ethics of physicians monitoring the use of steroids by 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, who has researched the effects of steroid use, said physicians have a 
moral obligation to care for patients even when disagreeing with the patients' 
lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
Puffer said that by caring for steroid users, doctors are aiding and abetting 
use. He said physicians should persuade steroid users to seek rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said the controversy over steroid use is overstated because medical 
literature is inconclusive. "We don't know as much as we pretend to know," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said it is unfair to paint a broad-brush picture of steroid side 
effects. In a study of 11 Rhode Island weightlifters, he found that stanozolol 
had a different effect than testosterone on cholesterol levels. Canadian 
sprinter Ben Johnson tested positive for stanozolol after winning the 100 
meters at the 1988 Seoul Games. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the side-effects are overstated," Thompson said, adding that 
stanozolol helped reduce the risk of heart disease by reducing cholesterol 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
Puffer said working with Olympic-caliber athletes leads him to believe that the 
side-effects are real. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Heiden, formerly a gold-medal winning speed skater and professional 
cyclist, is studying medicine at Stanford and coaching the 7-Eleven 
professional cycling team that will compete in next month's Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
During a symposium on the medical and scientific aspects of the tour Friday, 
Heiden presented a slide show highlighting his team. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll have to excuse me, this looks like a Slurpee commercial," he said after 
three consecutive slides prominently displayed the 7-Eleven logo. 
</P>
<P>
Heiden, who competed in the Tour de France, said the race's second week is 
psychologically the toughest on riders. 
</P>
<P>
"You are into the mountains but you have another week to go," he said. "It 
seems like they're never going to end." 
</P>
<P>
Although cycling is popular in Europe, Heiden said he does not expect the sport 
to gain a foothold in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The riders go by so fast there's not a lot to see," he said.

AVERY AND RIVAL OFFICE SUPPLY FIRM TO COMBINE; 
</P>
<P>
MERGERS: THE DEAL WITH DENNISON INVOLVES A STOCK SWAP VALUED AT $500 MILLION. 
IT CAPS FIVE YEARS OF TALKS AND WILL RESULT IN A WORLDWIDE GIANT. 
</P>

Avery International, a company founded in Los Angeles 55 years ago by R. 
Stanton Avery to market the self-sticking label that he had invented, said 
Friday that it will merge with one of its early customers to form a worldwide 
office products giant with combined annual sales of $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, Avery and Dennison Manufacturing of Framingham, Mass., 
said they will swap stock in a deal valued at about $500 million to form Avery 
Dennison Corp. The move will cap five years of sporadic negotiations that 
nearly produced a merger three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The result, subject to shareholder approval and government antitrust clearance, 
would cap a relationship born in 1941, when Avery began to supply Dennison with 
his self-sticking labels, which put the East Coast firm into the office 
products business. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the earlier failure to consummate a definitive agreement, the two 
companies continued exploring a merger, in part prodded by the European 
Community's imminent removal of its member nations' internal customs barriers, 
scheduled for 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Avery already attributes 40% of its 1989 sales of $1.7 billion to overseas 
operations in 26 countries. From France alone, Dennison generated about $40 
million of its 1989 sales of $771 million. (Avery had 1989 net income of $86.5 
million, Dennison $29.1 million.) 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street responded strongly to news of the merger. Avery common stock closed 
at $26.25, off $2.24, but Dennison common finished up $8.375 at $27.375 in 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Charles D. Miller, Avery's chairman and chief executive, will assume the same 
titles in Avery Dennison. His counterpart at Dennison, Nelson S. Gifford, will 
be vice chairman of the newly merged company. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Miller said Friday that "fundamental changes" are transforming 
the once-provincial and fragmented office products market into one dominated by 
large distribution firms and super-size retailers. "It is becoming a market 
where size and the ability to cross-merchandise will make for more effective 
distribution and logistics," he said. "We'll be able to go more effectively 
after the big customers." 
</P>
<P>
Avery makes self-adhesive base materials, labels, tapes, office products and 
specialty chemicals. Dennison makes stationery, office products, systems for 
identification and control and package decoration systems. Their products are 
sold under such brands as Avery, Fasson, Dennison, National and Carter's. 
</P>
<P>
Avery, which built a new headquarters building in 1982 in Pasadena, employs 
11,700 worldwide with several thousand of the jobs based in Southern 
California. Dennison has 7,000 employees, mostly in Massachusetts. The merged 
company will be based at Avery's Pasadena headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said the merger is not expected to reduce the combined work force. 
</P>
<P>
The Avery Dennison board will include all current Avery directors and four 
Dennison directors, including Gifford. The planned stock swap calls for 
Dennison's shareholders to receive 1.12 shares of Avery common stock for each 
Dennison share. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction is expected to take three to six months to be completed. 
Despite the fact that Avery and Dennison competed in a number of areas, analyst 
Matthew Robbins of Duff &amp; Phelps, an independent research firm in Chicago, 
said he expects no antitrust concerns because of the intense competition in the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said both Avery and Dennison shareholders "will be participating in the 
future growth of a company that, both financially and operationally, is larger, 
stronger and better positioned to capitalize on new growth opportunities and be 
more competitive in a rapidly developing global marketplace."

GM Shareholders OK Pension Plan: The provision to boost executive pensions 
nearly doubles the annual retirement pay of outgoing Chairman Roger B. Smith to 
about $1.1 million. Pensions for executives versus hourly workers will likely 
be a hot topic when negotiations between GM and the United Auto Workers union 
open in July, just a few weeks before Smith retires July 31. Also at the 
four-hour annual meeting, Smith said GM would begin building cars in an East 
German joint venture in October, becoming the first U.S. auto maker to make 
vehicles in Eastern Europe.

Smaller Personal Income Gains: Americans spent more during April despite a 
slump in income gains, the Commerce Department said. 
</P>
<P>
But personal income rose a mere 0.3% -- the smallest monthly increase in seven 
months -- after solid gains of 0.8% in the two preceding months. The last time 
there was a smaller increase was September of 1989, when incomes were up 0.2%. 
But spending rose at a stronger-than-forecast 0.6% last month after gains of 
0.5% in February and March.

Trade Deficit Shrinks: The U.S. trade deficit shrank to $26.4 billion in the 
first quarter, the smallest quarterly imbalance in more than six years, the 
Commerce Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
The department said the 8.2% improvement in the trade balance in the 
January-March period was a result of record-high export sales that offset the 
highest volume of oil imports in more than 12 years. For the first quarter, 
U.S. exports rose 4.7% to an all-time high of $96.04 billion. Imports were also 
at a record level, reflecting the surge in oil demand. They climbed 1.6%, to 
$122.4 billion.

SELF-RELIANT CHAPMAN HAS A LITTLE HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There aren't a lot of ways in which you might be tempted to compare Tracy 
Chapman to Madonna, but if nothing else, both of their current tours are 
triumphs of the modern zeitgeist of self-reliance. No other women in recent pop 
history have based their repertoires so strongly and successfully around the 
idea of not wanting to get kicked around. 
</P>
<P>
Madonna ended her recent shows breathlessly chanting "keep it together" like a 
mantra and sent everyone home with the philosophical admonition, "Remember, no 
matter what you do, never doubt yourself." Her new album includes yet another 
song about learning to love yourself. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman, who plays tonight at the Pacific Amphitheatre and Monday at the Open 
Air Theatre in San Diego, is much too self-aware to avoid doubting herself. But 
she similarly trades in the concepts of tough love and, when that fails, 
self-love. "I'm gonna love myself / More than anyone else / I'm gonna treat me 
right / This time I'm gonna be my own best friend," she sang with 
characteristic firmness during a powerful solo segment of her concert at the 
Greek Theatre Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Similarities pretty much end there. Where there's not much lingering irony in 
Madonna's "Material Girl," Chapman expresses nothing but contempt for those who 
chase after the "Material World." More important, if Madonna's self-help 
platitudes probably inspire nothing so much as harder and faster work-outs in 
the health clubs, Chapman is actually interested in working out personal and 
societal demons. Her victory feels more hard-fought, and inevitably more 
genuine. 
</P>
<P>
It's a fight she dukes out in a concert setting even more compelling than her 
first go-round of shows two years ago. Touring after her first smash album, 
Chapman played solo acoustic gigs at venues from the Roxy to the Coliseum (on 
the Amnesty International tour), a brave -- and attention-getting -- move. The 
austerity of playing such strong songs without a band finally made them sound 
more strident than they needed to be, placing too much gravity on 
protest-oriented tunesmanship that was already awfully weighty. 
</P>
<P>
There are obvious limits to self-reliance, and it's nice this time to see 
Chapman relying on the strength of a subtle backing band. 
</P>
<P>
At the Greek, Chapman showed up with five low-key musicians, and never did they 
get in the way of her shy confidence or folkish intimacy. An upbeat number like 
"Born to Fight," which sounded unduly cocky and overearnest in a solo context, 
took on more character performed with a lightly rollicking piano and upright 
bass backing that added the kind of sly, playful spin that Phil Ochs might have 
put on such an anthem. 
</P>
<P>
And if on the recent "Crossroads" album Chapman's righteous digs tend to 
overwhelm the more tender relational songs, these highly charged salvos took on 
more interesting shadings and found a better working context at the Greek. Her 
two sides converged most welcomely with a jazzy encore rendition of "A Change 
Is Gonna Come," where Chapman loosened up physically and vocally in surprising 
ways. If she keeps that up, look out. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Clegg and Savuka opened with a crowd-pleasing "Zulu-rock crossover" act, 
as he put it, insistently exuberant as always. If you sense Clegg on record 
extending himself too far to make South African rhythms and liberational themes 
palatable to a mass audience, Wednesday's hourlong opening set was happily free 
from the kind of pop overproduction that mars the albums. 
</P>
<P>
Clegg, as outgoing as Chapman is reserved, joined his crewmen (and women) in 
the latter part of the set for some Zulu dancing and ritual reenactment that 
ignited a true perspirational party atmosphere. As personality types go, it's 
certainly a well-balanced bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Chapman and Johnny Clegg &amp; Savuka play tonight at 7:30 at the 
Pacific Amphitheatre, 100 Fair Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $22.55 to $24.75. 
Information: (714) 634-1300.

THE WATER SHORTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the growing water shortage in California, specifically Southern 
California, I am concerned about a procedure that takes place in the restaurant 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
I work at a chain restaurant where, at the end of each night, while cleaning up 
the kitchen and dining area, we are to melt down the remaining ice with hot 
water. 
</P>
<P>
This same procedure was used at my previous job. Is this done for health 
reasons? Couldn't the ice be used to water plants inside and around the grounds 
of the restaurant? 
</P>
<P>
Each night at closing I think of the water rationing that is taking place in 
parts of California, and I feel that some action should be taken to stop the 
restaurants from the tremendous waste that occurs.

ON THE WATERFRONT: BOATING CLASSES AIM TO HEAD OFF DISASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEARLEAN DUKE, Shearlean Duke is a regular contributor to Orange County 
Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every day during the summer in Orange County, hundreds of boats head out to 
sea. Most are aiming for a relaxing weekend on the water, but others are headed 
for disaster. 
</P>
<P>
More boating accidents occur on Saturday, during perfect weather, than at any 
other time, according to the National Safe Boating Council. When it comes to 
boating accidents, California's yearly total of 745 is second only to Florida's 
952. Of all transportation accidents, boating mishaps are second only to auto 
accidents in the number of fatalities reported in this country each year. 
</P>
<P>
Local boating experts believe that those numbers could be cut drastically if 
skippers and their first mates would sign up for a safe-boating class before 
they ever set sail. But too many first-time boaters don't bother. That's why 
the emphasis is on education during Safe Boating Week, June 3 through 9. 
</P>
<P>
And education is what the U.S. Power Squadron is all about. "Our educational 
programs are the cornerstone of our safe-boating activity," says Louis Loth, 
commander of the Balboa Squadron in Newport Beach. "That's why most of us 
belong to the Power Squadron -- for the educational opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Power Squadron consists of 444 chapters nationally; three of those 
chapters are in Orange County. The oldest and largest is the Balboa Power 
Squadron, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary in July. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of states have made boating education mandatory for skippers, but 
Connecticut is the only state that requires an operating license much like a 
driver's license. A recent proposal to license boaters in Florida failed to 
pass. In California, a bill has been introduced in the Legislature to require 
mandatory boater education for some boating law offenders, but no license is 
required. 
</P>
<P>
"You can just go out and buy a boat," says Curtis Smith, education officer for 
the Balboa Power Squadron. "As long as the boat is registered, you can go out 
and do anything you want. You can buy a Donald Trump-size boat and go out and 
run it around." 
</P>
<P>
Smith and others in the Orange County boating community believe that it is 
better to learn how "to run it around" before you leave the dock. And during 
Safe Boating Week they hope to encourage beginning boaters to sign up for one 
of the safe-boating classes offered throughout Orange County by the U.S. Power 
Squadron or the Coast Guard Auxiliary, a civilian volunteer branch of the Coast 
Guard. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the week, members of the Power Squadron and the Auxiliary will set 
up booths along the waterfront and near popular marine stores and hand out 
safety literature describing classes available to the public. The Balboa Power 
Squadron offers free classes each spring and fall at the Newport Harbor Yacht 
Club. For information, call (714) 640-0281 or (714) 642-1249. 
</P>
<P>
Two separate series of free Coast Guard Auxiliary classes will begin July 11 
and 12 at the Orange County harbor master office, 1901 Bayside Drive. For 
information, call Barbara Farley at (714) 581-5568 or Joe Muslin at (714) 
675-3363. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Power Squadron and Auxiliary classes cover boat handling, charts and 
charting, coastal navigation, equipment regulations and boating laws. "What we 
try to do in our safe-boating classes is to cover the very fundamentals of 
boating safety," says Smith. "There is really a lot more to (operating a boat) 
than is usually apparent. And the Catalina channel is really quite a 
treacherous stretch of water. There are other boats out there, and you are not 
alone. There are many other factors to worry about other than just running 
aground or running into the breakwater. There are rules of the road like there 
are in driving a car." But as Mal Coston, another Power Squadron member points 
out: "There are no white lines on the water. So you have to know the rules of 
the road. We see almost every year two or three collisions that could have been 
avoided by following those rules if the people knew them." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to emphasizing education, members of Coast Guard Auxiliary will 
also be encouraging boaters to get their vessels in proper working order. 
"We'll give free courtesy exams and hand out Coast Guard decals to anyone who 
passes," Joe Muslin says. The courtesy boat inspections will be held at Newport 
Dunes at times and dates to be announced. For information, call (714) 675-3363. 
Typical problems found during such inspections include inadequate or missing 
fire extinguishers, improper lights and missing life jackets, according to 
Muslim. 
</P>
<P>
Other safe boating activities included a recent volunteer effort by the Balboa 
Power Squadron to verify the location of navigational aids in Huntington 
Harbour. Squadron members cruised through the harbor in inflatable dinghies 
checking to make sure that all channel markers were where they were supposed to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
Marlinespike -- Marine craftsman Robert Smirl will present a marlinespike class 
beginning June 7 at the Orange Coast College Sailing Center, 1801 W. Coast 
Highway, Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-week class will cover all aspects of marlinespike work, including 
knots, splices and decorative rope craft. Hands-on work will be emphasized, and 
students will work with the tools of the sail maker and rigger in completing 
various projects. For information, call (714) 645-9412. 
</P>
<P>
Boating education -- Boating information is quickly available year-round by 
calling the following toll free numbers: 
</P>
<P>
Boating classes (800) 336-BOAT or (800) 869-SAIL.

ASK THE JUDGE: IT'S ONE THING TO GET A JUDGMENT; IT'S ANOTHER TRYING TO COLLECT 
ON IT 
</P>

<P>
Q. As plaintiff in a small-claims case about three years ago, the court ruled 
in my favor and ordered the defendant to pay me an amount slightly under 
$1,200. I asked the defendant for payment. 
</P>
<P>
After several additional unsuccessful attempts to collect the money, the 
defendant flatly refused to pay and threatened my physical well-being if I 
pursued the matter further. 
</P>
<P>
Through some investigation of my own, I have found that the defendant was 
involved in several other claims such as mine and that he has done a thorough 
job of concealing any and all of his worldly assets through the use of 
fictitious business names and the help of family members. 
</P>
<P>
What can I do? The money means a lot to me, but so does my health! 
</P>
<P>
J.H., 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills 
</P>
<P>
A. I cannot give you any legal advice in regards to this. Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Donna Crandall, however, suggests that you may wish to consult the Sheriff's 
Department for a possible fraud investigation. She believes that her office 
would not be able to assist you until such an investigation is done and a 
recommendation to prosecute is made. 
</P>
<P>
Q. My daughter is dating a young man that I don't particularly like. By that, 
I'm not referring to a father's ordinary distrust of someone his daughter is 
seeing, but a feeling that there is something not quite right about him. From 
something he has said, I have a strong suspicion that he has been in trouble 
with the law, and has even been in jail. 
</P>
<P>
There has been recent publicity about people being able to get information from 
the Department of Motor Vehicles about perfect strangers. I would like to know 
if there is any law that would prevent me from getting some kind of information 
about a person's criminal past. I know that there are such things called "rap 
sheets." Is it possible for me to get one of those? 
</P>
<P>
ES, 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
A. The state does keep a record of a person's criminal history, which is 
commonly called a "rap sheet." The rap sheet will show whether a person has 
ever been arrested and the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
These rap sheets are highly confidential and are available to a relatively 
select group of people. Most of this group is made up of law enforcement 
personnel who must have access to rap sheets to perform their employment 
duties. An example would be the court, which would need a defendant's record 
for sentencing purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The law also allows defense attorneys to obtain their clients' rap sheets when 
defending them in criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
There are some people other than law enforcement personnel who are authorized 
access to the records as well. Ordinarily, they are governmental agencies who 
need the records when filling employment positions. Public utilities may also 
acquire the records when hiring employees who must enter private residences as 
part of their employment. 
</P>
<P>
A person who obtains someone's rap sheet in violation of the law can face 
criminal penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Q. My mother left me her home when she died. I should have sold the home, but, 
thinking it was a good investment, I rented it out. I have had nothing but 
trouble with my tenant. He is never on time with the rent, and, when he pays, 
he acts like I should be grateful to him. 
</P>
<P>
My tenant has now decided to sue me. He claims that he cut himself on a 
"defective window" that I should have fixed. 
</P>
<P>
Someone told me that he probably won't go through with this lawsuit. I heard 
that there is a time limit that cases must be heard in the courts or they are 
dismissed. Is this true? 
</P>
<P>
TY, 
</P>
<P>
Tustin 
</P>
<P>
A. It is unclear from your letter exactly what your tenant has done in his 
"lawsuit" against you. If he has filed a complaint naming you as a defendant, 
the court may, at its discretion, dismiss the case if you are not served with 
the complaint within two years of its filing date. 
</P>
<P>
If you have already been served with the complaint, the court may dismiss the 
case, at its own discretion, if it is not brought to trial within three years. 
The court must, however, dismiss the action if it is not brought to trial 
within five years. 
</P>
<P>
As with everything with the law, there are exceptions to these rules. You 
should consult an attorney to make sure that you are protected. Your attorney 
should be able to give you legal advice as to how you should handle your case. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I am a defendant in a personal-injury case (I am accused of causing an 
automobile accident). I have been told by my insurance company's lawyer that I 
have to appear at a deposition. I have never heard of such a thing and would 
like to know what it is. 
</P>
<P>
IK, 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
A. It appears from your letter that you are being asked to attend an oral 
deposition. An oral deposition is normally held at an attorney's office. You 
will be sworn to tell the truth, as if you were in court, and you will be asked 
questions that relate to the case in which you are involved. There will be a 
record of your answers. 
</P>
<P>
The answers that you give at a deposition may be used at the trial under 
certain circumstances. As a result, the law provides you with an opportunity to 
review your answers once a transcript of the deposition has been made. 
</P>
<P>
If you fail to attend the deposition, the law allows the party who wanted to 
question you to go to court and obtain an order requiring you to do so. You may 
also be fined by the court.

BUSH WILL TRY TO REASSURE SOVIETS ON GERMANY, NATO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
KENNEBUNKPORT, Me. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the future of a unified Germany shaping up as a central issue in next 
week's U.S.-Soviet summit, President Bush has indicated that he will try to 
persuade Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that there is "no threat to the 
Soviet Union" if Germany remains a member of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials displayed little alarm at Gorbachev's remarks Friday suggesting 
that the Soviet Union might reconsider its participation in conventional arms 
talks in Europe if a unified Germany becomes a member of NATO. 
</P>
<P>
While Gorbachev's opposition to German membership in NATO has not shifted, his 
comments to a Moscow press conference after a meeting with French President 
Francois Mitterrand were seen by non-government experts in the United States as 
his most dire warning yet of the consequences of such a step. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, in an interview with French television that was recorded Thursday -- one 
day before Gorbachev made his comments -- praised the Soviet president's 
handling of the fast-paced changes in Eastern Europe that have brought about 
the near-disintegration of the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorbachev has handled up until now change in Eastern Europe with great 
ability. And so I will approach him and make my case for a Germany in NATO," 
Bush said, according to a White House transcript made available in 
Kennebunkport as the President began a four-day Memorial Day holiday at his 
vacation home. "I have to sell him on the fact that this presents no threat to 
the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
After reports of Gorbachev's remarks in Moscow reached Administration 
officials, the White House said that it would have no comment until a complete 
text had been received. 
</P>
<P>
But one Administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 
Gorbachev's comments reflected the increasing pressure the Soviet leader 
apparently is feeling as a result of his plans to pull troops out of Hungary, 
Poland and Czechoslovakia -- all military allies of the Soviet Union until the 
crumbling of their Communist governments. 
</P>
<P>
The official said the demobilization in Eastern Europe presented Gorbachev with 
a number of problems, including that of finding housing and work for the 
returning troops and what he called the "psychological" problem linked to 
shrinking the Soviet Union's military role. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he pointed out that until last week's meeting in Moscow between 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze, the Soviet military had played a conspicuously limited role in 
recent arms control talks. 
</P>
<P>
That was said to have changed dramatically when Gorbachev sought the advice of 
a senior general during talks with Baker. 
</P>
<P>
At that meeting, the Administration official said, "the military played an 
extremely important role." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's sharp comments were read not only as a signal that tough bargaining 
may take place during the Washington summit, but also as a sign that the Soviet 
president is playing to a home audience of military professionals who are 
increasingly anxious about their future role. 
</P>
<P>
"Going into the summit, we felt that Germany would be the No. 1 issue," the 
Administration official said. "It's shaping up to be that."

In Washington, Baker and West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher 
reaffirmed Friday their support for German membership in NATO. 
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters before Gorbachev's press conference in Moscow, Baker said 
that he and Genscher achieved "an amazing degree of convergence of views" on 
German reunification and strategy for the 23-nation Conventional Forces in 
Europe talks in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
After talks with Genscher in Geneva, Shevardnadze said Wednesday that the 
Soviet Union wants to complete the conventional forces talks this year. His 
optimism seemed to contrast with what the United States and other NATO nations 
have termed Soviet foot-dragging in the Vienna talks. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to elaborate, Genscher said Shevardnadze expressed a Soviet desire to 
complete the negotiations quickly but did not provide any hint that Moscow was 
ready to compromise on artillery, tanks, troop levels and other issues to end 
the current deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said he received from Shevardnadze a similar assurance that Moscow wants 
to reach agreement soon in the Vienna talks. 
</P>
<P>
In the French television interview, Bush recognized the enhanced role of the 
Soviet military in the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he thought Gorbachev was being blocked by the military, Bush 
replied: "I don't think we know that, but that's certainly a concern. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"But it's not my role to figure out whether Gorbachev is having a problem with 
his right or his left; it's mine to deal with what's on the table. And what's 
on the table is a strong Soviet leader, clearly in charge, with whom we have a 
lot of business items."

TACTIC OF LIGHTING UP BORDER RAISES TENSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As dusk fell on the U.S.-Mexico border Thursday, hundreds of motorists gathered 
along a roadway here and shined their headlights toward groups of uninterested 
migrants waiting patiently for nightfall at the boundary line. 
</P>
<P>
Facing directly into the harsh beams of light, counter-protesters chanting No 
mas racismo! (No more racism!) held up mirrors and sheets of dark plastic in an 
attempt to reflect the lights back to the north. 
</P>
<P>
With the chill of night closing in, the face-off disintegrated into alternating 
volleys of epithets, as shouts of "Nazis!" and "Wetback lovers!" were 
exchanged. 
</P>
<P>
The dissonant scene was from the latest gathering of the Light Up the Border 
campaign, a burgeoning movement of mostly Anglo citizens that has galvanized 
public attention on the continuing stream of undocumented immigrants from the 
south. The lighting movement, which began with small gatherings last winter, 
has expanded rapidly and grown into huge, highly publicized protests involving 
1,000 or more people, energizing supporters and opponents on both sides of the 
frontier. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their many disagreements, the participants and counter-protesters agree 
on one thing: U.S. laws, specifically the much-ballyhooed Immigration Reform 
and Control Act of 1986, have failed abysmally in a primary goal -- turning 
back the daily tide of undocumented humanity from Mexico and elsewhere. Visual 
testament is provided by the hundreds of migrants -- men and women, the old and 
the young -- who stage each day along the international line in San Diego, 
waiting to slip into California and its promise of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The emotions evident during Thursday's border protests underline what appears 
to be an ever-greater polarization about unauthorized immigration. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel hatred is brewing on both sides," said Elizabeth Sisco, a photographer 
and professor at Southwestern College in Chula Vista who has been involved in 
border issues for more than a decade. "When people start hurling negative 
statements back and forth at each other, they just get madder and madder. And 
mad people don't act rationally." 
</P>
<P>
How to deal with the immigration problem remains a fiercely contested 
challenge. The so-called Alliance for Border Control, organizer of the lighting 
protests, hopes the movement will prompt U.S. authorities to bolster 
enforcement by posting additional border guards, building more barriers, 
deploying National Guard troops, and implementing similar stratagems. Opponents 
say such steps will never work without efforts to improve the economies of 
Third World "sending" nations, especially Mexico, and parallel moves to allay 
civil strife in Central America and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The pro-enforcement theme of the lighting protesters has struck a responsive 
and provocative chord in Southern California, drawing mostly non-Latinos who 
say they are fed up with illegal immigration and what they view as its 
corollary evils -- drug trafficking, the spread of disease, terrorism, traffic 
congestion and environmental degradation, among others. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is worsened by these massive numbers of people coming in," 
explained Sonya Jason, a San Fernando Valley resident who made the trip. "Look 
at the traffic. You just can't drive in L.A. anymore. The crisis in hospital 
care. The schools. Some black Americans can't get jobs because they don't speak 
Spanish. . . . The increased crime, the drugs coming in, the terrible effects 
of pollution. What about the water shortage?" 
</P>
<P>
The pro-enforcement activists have been particularly insistent on linking the 
illegal immigration and drug trafficking problem, implying that many migrants 
finance their trips by ferrying narcotics -- a claim dismissed by critics. In a 
letter published recently in the San Diego Union, Audrey W. Bergner, a La Jolla 
resident who is one of the movement's most vociferous leaders, alluded to "the 
drug dealers, criminals and other 3,000 aliens who pour into our city illegally 
every night." 
</P>
<P>
The protests have been heavily publicized by former San Diego Mayor Roger 
Hedgecock, who now hosts a popular radio call-in program. On a recent program, 
Hedgecock recounted that he had seen illegal aliens with phony immigration 
documents selling drugs to homeless people on the streets of downtown San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Critics see such comments as scapegoating and racist, a xenophobic throwback to 
U.S. nativist movements of yesteryear -- and a manifestation of Anglo backlash 
to the "browning" of California, as the state's Latino population continues to 
rise. They also perceive an invitation to vigilantism at a time when violence 
against migrants is on the rise and tensions about their presence are 
escalating throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what they're doing is promoting racism and hate," said Roberto 
Martinez, a longtime San Diego-based Latino rights activist who says he 
receives threatening telephone calls regularly on the days following border 
lighting protests. "They're creating a state of hysteria and fear in order to 
draw attention to their anti-immigrant attacks, which are based on 
misinformation." 
</P>
<P>
In the view of its detractors, the border lighting movement is a modern 
incarnation of classic American nativism -- the dislike of outsiders that has 
been a prevalent theme in U.S. society since Irish "hordes" began arriving on 
the East Coast during the 1840s. The demonization of immigrants has also 
affected Italians, Jews, Eastern Europeans, Chinese -- and now, many believe, 
Latin Americans and other immigrants, including Koreans and Haitians. 
</P>
<P>
The border lighting activists reject the harshly negative image projected by 
critics, contending that they are only seeking to have U.S. authorities regain 
control of the nation's borders. 
</P>
<P>
"This racist talk is just not true," said Muriel Watson, a San Diego County 
resident who is the leader of the Light Up the Border protests. "The border and 
its problems have been kept a deep, dark secret, and we're tired of it," said 
Watson, widow of a longtime Border Patrol pilot, and the former spokeswoman for 
the union representing U.S. Border Patrol officers. "Something has to be done. 
We're in a crisis situation." 
</P>
<P>
Watson, the granddaughter of Italian immigrants, stressed that the movement was 
not anti-immigrant -- just anti-illegal immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
But counter-protesters say the linkages drawn between undocumented immigrants 
and criminal activity suggest a clear bias. Critics charge that the 
pro-enforcement contingent regularly cites incorrect data to prove various 
points, such as the asserted connection between undocumented immigrants and 
crime, or the alleged link between illegal immigration and loss of jobs by U.S. 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"When you use phrases like war zone, state of siege, Tortilla Curtain -- these 
are the words that they use -- then you're making it impossible to create a 
dialogue," said Aida Mancillas, a language professor at UC San Diego, who was 
among the counter-protesters Thursday. "It tends to become Us vs. Them." 
</P>
<P>
Participants in the monthly lighting rallies are particularly disturbed by 
changes in California, and, in attempting to explain where things went wrong, 
many point to illegal immigration. Among the many interviewed Thursday evening, 
there was a clear yearning for what they viewed as the less complicated, less 
culturally baffling society of a past era. 
</P>
<P>
"I just can't see California being turned into Mexico," said Kay McCormick, a 
retired 67-year-old homeowner in northern San Diego County. Tensions are 
increasing there between Anglo residents and migrant workers, many of whom live 
in crude dwellings in area canyons. "It's a cultural thing. It has to do with 
speech, it has to do with bilingual education. I think people who come here 
should speak English." 
</P>
<P>
She was standing in front of her truck, lights on, along with Gladys Tisue, a 
retiree from El Cajon. "We're not against the Mexican people," Tisue explained. 
"We need them to work in the fields. But we need some kind of a program to 
bring them in. Anybody could come in through this border now. There are 
terrorists." 
</P>
<P>
As the protests wound down Thursday evening, the people who were its principal 
targets -- undocumented immigrants -- observed the lights with passing interest 
from hillsides to the south. Informed that the lights were meant as a symbolic 
protest against their presence, the border crossers expressed considerable 
bemusement. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to stop us by putting lights there?" asked a clearly befuddled Juan 
Murguia, a 22-year-old native of the Mexican state of Michoacan, who was among 
those staging on the now-dark hillside. "We're going to go through whether they 
are there or not. Besides, who would work in the fields if we weren't there? Do 
you think Americans would do the kind of work that we do?" 
</P>
<P>
With that, Murguia and the others continued following movements of the lights 
that most mattered to them -- the lights of U.S. Border Patrol land vehicles 
and aircraft assigned to the border area.

THE TIMES POLL;

<P>
FEINSTEIN HOLDS 11-POINT MARGIN OVER VAN DE KAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON, TIMES SACRAMENTO BUREAU CHIEF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Propelled by women and strengthened by her advocacy of the death penalty and 
abortion rights, Dianne Feinstein is running 11 points ahead of John K. Van de 
Kamp nearing the finish of their race for the Democratic gubernatorial 
nomination, according to The Los Angeles Times Poll. 
</P>
<P>
One other key factor -- a dynamic personality, contrasted with the cool, 
lawyer-like demeanor of her opponent -- has helped Feinstein maintain and 
solidify her lead in the last three months. 
</P>
<P>
The two recent televised debates -- the premier public events of this long 
election campaign -- did not help Van de Kamp, the Times survey indicated. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic voters were split about evenly over who they thought won the final 
debate last Sunday. Before the encounter, 35% told Times interviewers they 
expected to watch it. But afterward, only 6% said they had. Van de Kamp came 
across as the "more knowledgeable," voters told The Times. But Feinstein was 
the "most likeable" and "displayed the strongest personality and character." 
</P>
<P>
The Times survey, which ended Wednesday night, found Feinstein leading Atty. 
Gen. Van de Kamp by 38% to 27% with a large 35% still undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Neither candidate, according to the last four Times polls, has picked up any 
significant support since late February when Feinstein vaulted ahead with a 
strategically timed television commercial that emphasized her advocacy of 
abortion rights and the death penalty and her leadership as mayor of San 
Francisco after succeeding the assassinated George Moscone. Nor has the number 
of undecided voters been reduced since then. 
</P>
<P>
The undecided -- compared to the rest of the Democratic electorate -- tend to 
be more apolitical and less liberal; more blue collar and less educated. But 
more importantly, they also tend to be female. Three-quarters of the undecided 
are women, including two-thirds of those most likely to vote. 
</P>
<P>
This means that the numbers clearly favor Feinstein in her drive to become 
California's first woman gubernatorial nominee of a major party. Women who 
already have chosen up sides support her by 5 to 3. So if the undecided women 
break the same way as those already committed, they will boost Feinstein's lead 
substantially. 
</P>
<P>
But if Feinstein does emerge as the Democratic nominee on June 5 and battles 
Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson in November, she may find the gender equation 
significantly altered as GOP voters are tossed into the electoral mix. 
</P>
<P>
In a hypothetical November runoff, Wilson holds a slight lead over Feinstein, 
42% to 36% with 21% undecided and 1% for "someone else," according to the Times 
survey. Women divide about evenly between Feinstein and Wilson, while men 
support the senator by 4 to 3. 
</P>
<P>
In a Van de Kamp-Wilson matchup, Wilson leads by roughly the same margin: 44% 
to 36% with 20% undecided. 
</P>
<P>
The Times poll, directed by I.A. Lewis, interviewed 1,730 registered voters by 
telephone for seven days beginning May 17. Among these were 854 Democrats, 621 
Republicans, 218 independents and 37 members of minor parties. The margin of 
error for all the registered voters is three percentage points in either 
direction. For the Democrats and Republicans separately, the error margin is 
five points. 
</P>
<P>
The poll also measured voter opinions about other contests on the state primary 
ballot, including these: 
</P>
<P>
Democratic attorney general: San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith has pulled 
even with Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner after trailing for months. 
But, as with other state contests below governor, there is a whopping number of 
undecided voters. The latest result shows Smith 21%, Reiner 20%, undecided 59%. 
Los Angeles County supports Reiner by nearly 2 to 1, but the San Francisco Bay 
Area backs Smith by 4 to 1. Smith leads 3 to 1 in the remainder of Northern 
California and the candidates are running even in the rest of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Republican treasurer: Incumbent Thomas W. Hayes has retaken the lead over 
Angela (Bay) Buchanan, 25% to 14% with 61% undecided. In the previous Times 
survey, the two were tied. The difference in results of the two polls, at least 
partially, may be in how Buchanan was identified. In the earlier poll, she was 
identified as a former U.S. treasurer. In the latest survey, she was 
characterized exactly as she will appear on the ballot: "Chief Financial 
Officer." 
</P>
<P>
Republican lieutenant governor: This contest still is a mystery to the 
electorate. State Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) had 17%, State Sen. Marian 
Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) had 13% but 70% were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 111: Voters are divided about evenly on this controversial measure, 
which would raise the gasoline tax and alter the state spending limit in order 
to finance a 10-year transportation plan. The poll showed 45% in favor, 42% 
opposed, and 13% undecided. Democrats are more inclined to support the measure 
than Republicans, but voters of each party are basically split. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 108: A companion to Proposition 111, this $1-billion bond issue for 
light rail is supported overwhelmingly, 59% to 27%, with 14% undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 116: Voters are divided on this separate $1.9-billion bond issue 
for rail systems, with 41% in favor, 42% opposed, and 17% undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since February, three or four factors have dominated the Democratic 
gubernatorial race and they continue to do so as election day approaches. 
</P>
<P>
First and foremost is Feinstein's natural appeal to women, enhanced by the lure 
of her becoming the first woman governor in California's history. Second is her 
adamant positions on two issues that California voters care deeply about: the 
death penalty and abortion rights. Third is her personality. And beyond that, 
she benefits from some stereotypes long associated with women -- they're 
caring, honest and concerned about schools. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's supporters actually have an agenda that is a little different than 
Van de Kamp's, the Times survey found. The attorney general's supporters -- 
like voters as a whole -- say that "issues involving crime and drugs" are 
"usually the most important" when they decide whom to back for governor. But 
among Feinstein's supporters, education is just as important as fighting crime. 
</P>
<P>
Education ranks second on the list of priorities for Van de Kamp supporters, as 
it does for voters as a whole. Abortion is a close third on the issues list of 
Van de Kamp and Feinstein supporters alike, but women are a lot more concerned 
about it than are men. 
</P>
<P>
By 3 to 1, Democratic voters believe that Feinstein "would do the best job as 
far as abortion is concerned." 
</P>
<P>
Four in 10 Democrats who generally favor abortion say they probably would 
switch to another candidate if they believed the person they had been planning 
to vote for was "much less strongly committed to abortion rights" than the 
other contender. This is especially true of Feinstein's supporters. And it 
means that Feinstein may have been playing with political fire when she told 
reporters after the first gubernatorial debate that she "might well" sign 
legislation banning abortion for sex selection. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein quickly backed off that notion the next day and again pledged her 
unequivocal support for a woman's right to choose for herself whether to have 
an abortion for any reason. Previously, Van de Kamp was thought to be the 
vulnerable candidate on this issue because although he publicly supports a 
woman's right to choose, he personally opposes abortion. 
</P>
<P>
By 7 to 1, Democratic voters support a woman's right to choose for herself and 
reject the idea that "the government has a legitimate right to regulate 
abortion." Feinstein's voters feel this way by 13 to 1. But there is a seeming 
contradiction here. When asked whether "it should be legal for a woman to have 
an abortion because she prefers a child of the opposite sex," Democratic voters 
answered "no" by 4 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
Times pollster Lewis said: "People generally think about abortion 
situationally, not theoretically. Every situation is considered one at a time 
on its own merits, without worrying about whether it is consistent with any 
other abortion attitude. In that sense, Californians see no contradiction 
between opposing the widely condemned idea of government regulation of abortion 
and yet at the same time favoring laws to stop the widely condemned idea of 
gender selection by abortion." 
</P>
<P>
As for fighting crime, voters rate the attorney general only slightly better 
than Feinstein. And by 7 to 3, they regard her as best at handling the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Roughly one-fourth of the Democrats who favor the death penalty say they 
probably would switch their allegiance to another candidate if they believed 
the person they had been supporting was "much less strongly committed" to 
capital punishment than the other contender. This would seem to work to the 
advantage of Feinstein, since she is unswervingly for capital punishment and is 
constantly questioning Van de Kamp's commitment to carry out executions because 
he personally opposes the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's voters told Times interviewers that the "single most important 
quality" that attracts them to her is the belief that she "can get things 
done." Van de Kamp's chief attraction for his supporters is his "experience." 
</P>
<P>
By 3 to 2, Democrats think Feinstein possesses "the strongest qualities of 
leadership." By 2 to 1, they believe she is the candidate who "cares most" 
about people like themselves. And by 5 to 2, she is considered "the most 
dynamic." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein may have come close to alienating some Democratic voters in the first 
debate by saying she would put "everything on the table" during state budget 
negotiations, including cost of living adjustments (COLAS) for the aged, blind 
and disabled. She later backed off, pledging to protect these benefit increases 
in negotiations. Three-fourths of the Democratic voters in this survey -- and 
82% of Feinstein's supporters -- opposed freezing cost-of-living increases for 
the needy. 
</P>
<P>
Regionally, Feinstein leads by 7 to 4 in Los Angeles County, despite it being 
Van de Kamp's home turf. The candidates are running even in the rest of 
Southern California. Feinstein leads 3 to 2 in the Bay Area and 5 to 3 in the 
remainder of Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
It does not appear that the size of the voter turnout on election day will have 
a major impact on the result, according to the latest Times survey. Feinstein's 
lead is roughly the same regardless of whether the turnout is projected to be 
large -- say, in the 58% range -- or historically low, down around 37%. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's support is more solid than Van de Kamp's, the poll indicated. 
Compared to the front-runner, there are significantly more voters in Van de 
Kamp's column who are merely "leaning" his way, as opposed to being fairly 
certain of their vote. Looked at from another angle, nearly half of Feinstein's 
voters say they support her "very strongly." But only slightly more than a 
third of Van de Kamp's voters feel "very strongly" about him. 
</P>
<P>
About one in six voters say they probably will vote absentee rather than 
actually go to the polls on June 5. Feinstein's lead is slightly larger among 
these likely absentee voters.

In a recent TA directive, parents with strollers would be allowed to use

A STAUNCH ENEMY OF DRUG TRAFFICKING IS FAVORED TO BE COLOMBIA'S NEXT PRESIDENT;

ELECTION: VIOLENCE IS THE MAIN ISSUE FOR VOTERS. FRONT-RUNNER CESAR GAVIRIA 
VOWS 'NO CONCESSIONS' TO COCAINE BARONS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In presidential elections scheduled for Sunday, the terrifying violence that 
plagues Colombia overrides all other issues, and the candidate who has taken 
the toughest position against killer drug lords is favored to win the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Cesar Gaviria of the governing Liberal Party may not win as strong a mandate as 
he would like to back his policy of fighting narcoterroristas "without 
concessions." According to recent surveys, Gaviria was preferred by as little 
as 40% of those polled. 
</P>
<P>
But the surveys have shown that none of the 11 other candidates was preferred 
by more than 20%. 
</P>
<P>
The winner will take office in August, succeeding Virgilio Barco Vargas as 
president of South America's second most populous country, with 32 million 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Gaviria, 43, served as minister of finance and minister of government in 
Barco's Cabinet. He quit last year to head the presidential campaign of Luis 
Carlos Galan, a charismatic Liberal who was assassinated at a campaign rally 
last August. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, terrorists suspected of working for cocaine traffickers have killed 
two more presidential candidates and hundreds of other Colombians in a shocking 
siege of shootings and bombings. 
</P>
<P>
One of Gaviria's main campaign positions has been a stern stand against the 
terrorist campaign, which is aimed at forcing government concessions to 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
"He is the only one of the four main candidates who is not preaching some form 
of accommodation," observed a European diplomat. Gaviria summarized his 
hard-line stance in a meeting this week with foreign correspondents. 
</P>
<P>
"No society can lose the fight against terrorism without risk of dissolving," 
he said. "I am in favor of facing up to terrorism without making concessions to 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Gaviria's position coincides with U.S. policy, and American officials credit 
him with bravery under threats to his own life. 
</P>
<P>
"He's probably the most threatened person right now, under a tremendous amount 
of pressure," said one U.S. official. "And every time I have seen that he has 
spoken to the press, he has not wavered. He's extremely tough on the narcotics 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
Gaviria said the immediate goal of the violence by traffickers is to disrupt 
the electoral process. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to destabilize the democracy," he said. He added that right-wing 
death squads and leftist guerrillas have the same goal. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the Colombian press has reported almost daily clashes between 
guerrillas and the army. On Friday, radio stations said seven policemen and 
five guerrillas died in a rebel ambush near the town of Jamundi, about 200 
miles southwest of Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
But the terrorist campaign of the drug lords has overshadowed other kinds of 
violence. Radio RCN said bombings and shootings killed 35 people Thursday in 
the city Medellin, home of the notorious Medellin cartel. 
</P>
<P>
Six of the dead were police. The cartel has offered a bounty of $4,300 for 
every police officer killed in Medellin, and more than 30 have died this month. 
</P>
<P>
The three candidates closest in pre-election opinion polls to Gaviria have all 
taken more conciliatory positions than he. 
</P>
<P>
Rodrigo Lloreda, candidate of the opposition Social Conservative Party, has 
said he opposes the extradition of Colombians to the United States for trial on 
drug trafficking charges. An end to extradition has been one of the 
traffickers' main goals. 
</P>
<P>
Alvaro Gomez, candidate of a Conservative splinter group, has proposed the 
legalization of cocaine in the United States. He has said the government should 
consider granting unspecified conditions in return for the surrender of 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Antonio Navarro, candidate of the M-19, a former guerrilla movement, has also 
advocated a conditional surrender and rejected extradition. 
</P>
<P>
"The extraditions have done nothing for Colombia," Navarro told foreign 
reporters this week. Fifteen accused traffickers have been extradited to the 
United States since late August. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro became the M-19 candidate after the April killing of candidate Carlos 
Pizarro, who had led the former rebel movement into the political arena earlier 
this year. The M-19's switch from rebellion to legal politics was the result of 
peace negotiations with the Barco administration. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the government began negotiations with another guerrilla movement, 
the Popular Liberation Army. Two other major rebel groups continue to fight, 
although both have announced cease-fires for election day. 
</P>
<P>
Both officials and rebel leaders say the process of pacifying guerrillas 
depends on reforms in Colombia's democratic system, long dominated by Liberals 
and Conservatives to the exclusion of other parties and interests. 
</P>
<P>
When Colombians vote Sunday for a president, they will mark a second ballot on 
the question of whether to convene a constituent assembly that could write 
political reforms into the constitution. The national Congress previously has 
blocked the creation of a constituent assembly. 
</P>
<P>
All leading presidential candidates support the idea. Some, including Gaviria, 
have said that constitutional changes also are needed to strengthen the 
country's judicial system, which has been almost totally ineffective against 
powerful drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the threat of assassination, all major candidates except Lloreda 
have avoided outdoor campaign rallies this month.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alberto Fujimori sat in his living room and watched himself star on the evening 
news: driving his tractor unannounced into the poorest of Peru's slums and 
then, from atop his "Fujimobile," berating Peru's oligarchy before a cheering 
throng. 
</P>
<P>
The bespectacled university administrator was buoyant as he noted high points 
in the replay of his campaign rally a few hours earlier. And he was not the 
least bit surprised by its success. 
</P>
<P>
This son of Japanese immigrants, making his first run for public office, may be 
the only person in Peru who is not stunned by his extraordinary rise from 
obscurity to front-runner in the two-man runoff for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
The question now is whether the Fujimori tsunami, or seismic wave, will subside 
as quickly as it arose. Novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, the favorite until 
Fujimori's sudden first-round surge, again is campaigning with fervor, and he 
is narrowing Fujimori's lead in opinion polls. Many analysts say either man 
could win in the June 10 runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Vargas Llosa, leading a right-wing coalition, had seemed certain of victory 
back when Fujimori was lumped among "others." The author had detailed policies, 
ample funding and the ear of much of the media as he stridently attacked past 
administrations and promised a new "people's capitalism." 
</P>
<P>
But Fujimori was rewriting the script. Known inaptly as El Chinito (the Little 
Chinese), he cast himself as the moderate champion of Peru's forgotten poor, 
the cholitos, a sometimes-derogatory term in Peru and and elsewhere in the 
Andes for Indian peasants. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the majority," Fujimori told one rally. "We are a Chinito and cholitos, 
but we are the authentic people of Peru." 
</P>
<P>
He stormed into second place in the April 8 first-round ballot, and many of 
Peru's centrist and leftist politicians, who share a dislike for Vargas Llosa, 
now support Fujimori. But his continued refusal to disclose detailed proposals 
has raised skepticism about his ability to run the nation effectively. 
</P>
<P>
Vargas Llosa's lieutenants dismiss Fujimori as a populist demagogue who has no 
organization of substance behind him. The writer's partisans charge that 
Fujimori's vaguely proposed gradual reform will merely ensure a further slide 
into hyper-inflation of well over 2,000% a year, declining wages and, 
inevitably, more suffering for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
For both candidates, it is an almost furtive campaign, politics by stealth. 
Fear of attacks by radical Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) guerrillas means 
that campaign appearances are announced at most a day in advance. Often, 
especially in risky areas, the candidates simply show up and hope people will 
gather. 
</P>
<P>
After a monthlong respite in which both candidates took stock and vanished from 
sight, they resumed campaigning in early May. Characteristically, Fujimori 
headed for the poor barrios, avoiding specifics and raising the pitch of his 
derisive attacks on Peru's elite. 
</P>
<P>
Vargas Llosa tried to apply some of Fujimori's own tactics, plunging into the 
poor areas, though with smaller crowds and sometimes hecklers. He now 
emphasizes his Democratic Front coalition's detailed plan for a huge social 
program for the poor to ease the impact of the adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
A mid-May poll showed Vargas Llosa actually leading for the first time in Lima, 
home to about one-third of Peru's 22 million people. Lima-only polls can be 
misleading, although they do suggest voter trends. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Fujimori is clearly more comfortable in Lima's squatter camps and forgotten 
inland mountain towns, where he built his surge. He wears blue jeans with 
turned-up cuffs and drives his tractor, which has become his trademark, into 
the dusty settlements; Vargas Llosa, trying to shed an upper-crust image, rides 
in a bulletproof four-wheel-drive vehicle but then walks alone with the poor, 
no longer surrounded by so many white aides. 
</P>
<P>
The pro-Fujimori press took delight in noting that Vargas Llosa's campaign 
caravan got lost recently while trying to find one of the many slums that ring 
Lima. The subliminal message: Try as they might, well-to-do conservative whites 
are not at home in much of what makes up modern Peru. 
</P>
<P>
Even some of Vargas Llosa's supporters acknowledge that Fujimori saw and filled 
an empty space in the political spectrum, galvanizing hundreds of thousands of 
people who function in the black-market world that accounts for half of Peru's 
moribund economy. 
</P>
<P>
Felipe Ortiz de Zevallos of the Apoyo polling firm said that Vargas Llosa was 
always well to the right of most Peruvians and further polarized the electorate 
with talk of "shock" adjustment programs. 
</P>
<P>
"The people have the impression that Vargas Llosa is going to pull out their 
molars to achieve this shock," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fujimori framed it this way: "It isn't a matter of center, right or left. You 
must see it rather as above, center and below. A political vacuum existed in 
the center and below. These sectors did not have the attention of the political 
parties or the government. We have recognized their aspirations." 
</P>
<P>
Fujimori, who spent $197,000 for his first-round campaign, has attacked the 
Democratic Front for its $12.3-million campaign, including a contract for the 
New York advertising firm of Sawyer/Miller Group, when so many Peruvians are 
hungry. 
</P>
<P>
"Ours was a very white campaign. Few mestizos (mixed-race people) were 
visible," a Vargas Llosa aide admitted, and he said that Sawyer/Miller "had no 
idea what Peru is about. You have to feel Peru with your fingertips." 
</P>
<P>
Vargas Llosa reportedly was so dispirited the night of the first-round ballot 
in April that he nearly quit the race. 
</P>
<P>
Fujimori preempted Vargas Llosa's role as an independent nonpolitician. Even 
among those who respected Vargas Llosa and his ideas, many worried about his 
friends -- traditional conservative parties and prominent whites. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Gomez, a government worker with four children attending a Fujimori rally 
in the squatter settlement of Huaycan, called Fujimori "a miracle from God, 
because at a hopeless moment a new person arrived who wasn't like the old faces 
who failed." 
</P>
<P>
Fujimori, a 51-year-old agronomist and former head of the university rectors' 
association, said his own immigrant heritage has been a factor in winning over 
the urban newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is part of my message," he said. "As I said to the people of Huaycan, 
they too are first-generation Peruvians, immigrants from the highlands living 
in a hostile area like Lima. And there was a tacit identification." 
</P>
<P>
The tiny Japanese community, just 60,000 people of the 22-million population, 
is quiet; some members fear a backlash if Fujimori wins and fails to govern 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese are seen here as hard workers, savers, scrupulous," sociologist 
Carlos Franco said. "Those are the same characteristics of Peru's new 
microbusiness owners and 'informals.' So the Japanese are the super-ego of the 
cholos." 
</P>
<P>
Vargas Llosa, 54, has sought to keep race and racism out of the campaign and 
quickly denounced the suggestion by one of his spokesmen that an immigrant's 
son ought not be president of Peru. To add to his problems, Vargas Llosa was 
the subject of scathing remarks by Julia Urquidi, his first wife, who is also 
his aunt. 
</P>
<P>
"When we married, he was a snob, but not rich. I don't know why this gentleman 
has ended up giving such importance to money, to the extent of putting himself 
at the head of the bourgeoisie whose values he made fun of when he was my 
husband," she said in an interview from La Paz, Bolivia, where she now lives, 
that was reprinted by the anti-Vargas Llosa newspaper La Republica. 
</P>
<P>
Religion became an emotional issue in the race this week when the Roman 
Catholic archbishop of Lima publicly criticized "the insidious campaign 
unleashed against our faith by so-called evangelical groups. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Fujimori is Catholic, but many supporters in his Cambio 90 (Change 90) movement 
are from Peru's growing evangelical Protestant churches. Some churches have 
criticized Catholic practices, and a number of evangelical clerics have openly 
endorsed Fujimori from the pulpit. 
</P>
<P>
Fujimori followers in turn criticized the Catholic Church for leaning to Vargas 
Llosa, a professed agnostic. An estimated 90% of Peru's population is Catholic.

SAVE CHRISTIAN TRADITION, POPE URGES IN MALTA VISIT

<TEXT>
<P>
Pope John Paul II opened a three-day visit to Malta on Friday by calling on the 
government to prevent the influx of any ideas or behavior alien to the island 
nation's Christian tradition. 
</P>
<P>
John Paul, the first pontiff to ever travel to the Mediterranean island, said 
this century's two world wars and the more recent convulsions in Eastern Europe 
have shown that nations must respect the inalienable rights and dignity of each 
citizen. 
</P>
<P>
"The task of establishing such a social order requires great patience, clear 
vision and moral maturity," he said in a speech delivered inside the ornate 
presidential palace. 
</P>
<P>
The pontiff, in an endorsement of the Christian Democratic government of Prime 
Minister Eddie Fenech Adami, said he saw these values of charity, justice and 
freedom in Malta. 
</P>
<P>
President Censu Tabone responded by reaffirming Malta's position as a bulwark 
of Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope's visit to the rugged Mediterranean island showed that the Vatican and 
Malta have repaired relations that deteriorated during the tenure of a previous 
leftist government. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope upon arrival appeared intent on demonstrating the improvement. After 
kissing the airport tarmac, he beamed as he embraced Adami, whose Nationalist 
Party ousted the leftist Labor Party in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of people heralded his arrival through streets festooned with 
bunting and the fluttering red and yellow flags of Malta and the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
Church bells clanged and firecrackers detonated as the pontiff -- standing 
behind bullet-proof glass in his special vehicle -- was driven through the 
narrow winding streets of the city hewn from honey-colored stone. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Malta's 350,000 inhabitants are Catholic. Christianity arrived on the 
island in AD 60, when -- according to the Book of Apostles -- St. Peter was 
shipwrecked on the rugged island and converted those who helped him. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope will travel to northern Gozo island today. The highlight of his visit 
is expected to be a Mass before his Sunday evening departure.

FORMER NAZI QUITS AS W. GERMAN PARTY LEADER, BLAMING EXTREMISTS

Franz Schoenhuber, the ex-Nazi Waffen SS soldier whose ultra-rightist 
Republicans became the shooting star of West German politics, quit as party 
leader Friday, complaining that extremists have taken over. 
</P>
<P>
Mainstream politicians in Bonn said his decision marks the near-certain demise 
of one of Europe's most controversial political parties, which went from a 
mushrooming political force to a fringe group in disarray. 
</P>
<P>
Otto Lambsdorff, head of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's junior coalition partners, 
the Free Democrats, said Friday, "The remains . . . of this party will soon 
scatter themselves into the wind." 
</P>
<P>
The Republicans' main office in Munich said Schoenhuber's former deputy, 
Johanna Grund, 56, would replace him until a new chairperson is elected. 
</P>
<P>
Schoenhuber, 66, said that a "small clique of extremist functionaries" existed 
at top party levels and that he is quitting because he feels unable to oppose 
them. 
</P>
<P>
In recent state elections, the Republicans mustered less than 2% of the vote. 
They slipped badly in national polls -- far below the 5% needed to gain seats 
in the federal Parliament in Dec. 2 elections. 
</P>
<P>
Schoenhuber told reporters in Munich that he would try to create a new 
leadership to challenge his successor, but Republican officials said efforts 
were already under way among the leadership to oust him from the party.

FIGHTER JET CRASH KILLS 2 IN GEORGIA; WOMAN READING BIBLE ESCAPES

An Air Force fighter jet crashed into a residential area in rural south Georgia 
on Friday, killing the pilot and a woman on the ground and narrowly missing a 
resident who had been reading a Bible in her living room. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time since November that a military jet crashed in Georgia 
and killed a civilian on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
The crash victim on the ground was identified by the Atkinson County Sheriff's 
Department as Marion Lanier, a cleaning woman who was making her weekly visit 
to a client's home. 
</P>
<P>
The F-16A Fighting Falcon was on a training flight from Moody Air Force Base 
near Valdosta, Ga., -- about 40 miles away -- to Lake George Weapons Range in 
Florida when it crashed. The pilot was the only occupant, a base spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials could not immediately explain why the jet crashed north of the air 
base when it was scheduled to fly south to Florida. The plane was carrying six 
practice bombs, but none exploded. 
</P>
<P>
Six homes were damaged in the crash. Reporters at the scene said at least two 
of the houses were leveled, and the house where Lanier died appeared to have 
been destroyed by fire. Other houses had windows shattered. 
</P>
<P>
A woman in her 70s living on the other side of the highway narrowly escaped 
injury. Atkinson County Sheriff Earl Haskins said Mabel Guthrie walked out of 
her living room, where she had been sitting and reading a Bible, just before 
the crash. The fuselage tore through the room just after she left to answer the 
telephone, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The woman was unharmed," Haskins said. "It was miraculous." 
</P>
<P>
The Pearson Volunteer Fire Department sent both of its units to fight the 
fires, and fire departments from neighboring towns also were called in to 
assist. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, a Navy jet crashed into an apartment complex north of Atlanta 
and burst into flames, killing two residents and seriously wounding the pilot. 
The fighter was trying to land at Dobbins Air Force Base when it crashed in 
suburban Smyrna, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1989, a trainer jet out of Moody accidentally dropped a 500-pound bomb 
in west Georgia. It blew up in a wooded area, narrowly missing some houses. The 
Air Force blamed a faulty bomb rack.

BEIT SAHUR, Israeli-Occupied West Bank 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael A. would seem to have good reason to want U.N. observers of some sort 
overseeing the West Bank, where his hometown of Beit Sahur is located among 
olive groves and pasture. 
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, he and witnesses said, a group of demonstrators were set upon by 
clusters of Israeli security agents wearing Arab headdress and carrying 
concealed pistols. When the impersonators got close, they opened fire and 
wounded about 20 demonstrators, all below the waist. 
</P>
<P>
Michael A. was hit four times in the right leg. His friends collected 
9-millimeter shells from the scene to show that pistols, not rifles, were used 
and that the shootings were not by soldiers firing from afar in response to 
protesters hurling rocks. 
</P>
<P>
An army spokesman said that four youths were wounded in the incident and that 
they were attacking soldiers with stones. "These were not innocent protesters," 
said the spokesman. As is customary, the spokesman declined to comment on 
either the weaponry used or the mode of military operation, disguised or 
uniformed. 
</P>
<P>
As with many incidents that take place in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the 
truth will probably never quite be known, but Michael A., interviewed in a 
Jerusalem hospital, is skeptical that any team of U.N. observers would make any 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
"There are plenty of people here observing. You, a journalist, are here, and 
what good does it do?" he asked. "There is the Red Cross and the United Nations 
already around, and what comes of it? Just more killing." 
</P>
<P>
His impassioned response was typical of residents in Beit Sahur, a Palestinian 
town next door to Bethlehem. The violence in the wake of last Sunday's killing 
of seven Palestinian day workers by a deranged Israeli had left at least 15 
Palestinians dead, including one 8-year-old boy, at the hands of Israeli 
soldiers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. An Israeli and an Arab civilian were 
slain in separate knifings inside Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Beit Sahur residents seemed in no mood for diplomatic news. Vengeance was more 
on their minds. 
</P>
<P>
"We are treated like animals, and we should strike back," said Taher, a 
30-year-old activist in the intifada, as the 29-month-old Arab uprising is 
known. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III made news mid-week when he said the 
United States might consider supporting sending U.N. observers to the occupied 
territories. The State Department clarified the U.S. position a day later, 
saying that Washington would back a U.N. investigative team to study the 
situation of the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Yasser Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation 
Organization, addressed the U.N. Security Council in Geneva and requested that 
a U.N. force be sent to protect Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Israel opposes all these proposals, especially the idea of a U.N. observer 
force to be permanently established in the occupied lands. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very seriously concerned that U.N. observers would not contribute to 
tranquility in the area at all; that those people who incite to violence in the 
area and engage in violence would feel encouraged to engage in violence," 
Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials contend that there are already plenty of observers in the 
West Bank and Gaza, citing the many journalists, foreign and domestic in 
Israel. But more and more, reporters are barred from entering the occupied 
lands by military order; all of the West Bank and Gaza Strip was put off limits 
to the press the first three days of this week. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leaders welcomed the possibility of U.N. intervention, even in the 
watered down form of a one-time investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a step in the right direction," said Radwan abu Ayash, a top contact for 
the Palestine Liberation Organization in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Although the need for U.N. activity was couched in practical terms by 
Palestinians -- they view it as a form of protection against the abuses of 
occupation -- the political ramifications of such a move are clear to both 
sides of the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
For Israel, it would presuppose a resolution to the conflict that the 
government precludes: that the land is destined to be taken away from Israeli 
control. 
</P>
<P>
"There would be nothing to negotiate," a Foreign Ministry official said 
privately. 
</P>
<P>
What the Israeli government finds unacceptable is just what Palestinians want: 
international recognition, by way of U.N. operations over a specified 
geographical area, of the boundaries of a future Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
"We would hope the U.N. team would be dispatched to the West Bank, Gaza and 
East Jerusalem," said Faisal Husseini, who is viewed as the leading public 
figure in the Palestinian uprising. 
</P>
<P>
U.N. protection in the West Bank and Gaza has been a long-time demand of the 
PLO. The United States has traditionally opposed such a program, so Baker's 
seeming willingness to consider sending peacekeepers came as a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
These concerns seemed far away from Beit Sahur, which gained prominence in the 
Arab uprising last year when its inhabitants staged a tax strike that the 
Israeli authorities tried to break by sacking private homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Bethlehem and Beit Sahur, along with several other West Bank towns and 
villages, have also been targeted by special units of the Israeli army and 
intelligence whose members dress up in Arab headdresses and the masks used by 
uprising activists. Sometimes commandeering Arab cars, the agents infiltrate 
groups of stone throwers and sometimes try to shoot ringleaders. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most notorious of the cases occurred last year in Bethlehem, where 
plainclothes agents disguised themselves as tourists and killed a man who was 
throwing stones at soldiers in an alley. 
</P>
<P>
Undercover gunmen have posed as reporters in order to approach wanted activists 
in safety. There have also been cases of street ambushes of suspected activists 
in which the gunman has blended into busy street scenes while awaiting his 
target. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses in Beit Sahur say the masked Israelis approached two groups of youths 
in town as they were marching Monday night. The Palestinians became suspicious 
of the newcomers, who declined to identify themselves.

Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat urged the U.N. Security Council on Friday to 
send an emergency force to protect Arabs in the Israeli-occupied territories 
from a "war of extermination." 
</P>
<P>
Opening an emergency council session, Arafat called for an end to Israel's 
23-year-old occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, a ban on Jewish 
settlements in the territories and international sanctions against Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The violence "has reached an extremely dangerous and explosive point," the 
Palestine Liberation Organization chief said. "The situation now requires 
urgent action in order to enforce reverence for international legitimacy." 
</P>
<P>
But Israel dismissed any U.N. monitoring of the West Bank and Gaza following an 
upsurge of violence triggered by an Israeli gunman who killed seven Palestinian 
laborers last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"It requires the consent of all parties, and we will not give that consent," 
Israel's delegate, Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said shortly 
before the council session began. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are now facing is a further attempt to delegitimize Israel and Jewish 
immigration to it," he told the council. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat, speaking for nearly an hour, did not say what sort of civilian or 
military force he proposed. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat urged appointment of a permanent U.N. envoy to monitor the situation and 
immediate preparations for an international Middle East peace conference. 
</P>
<P>
Initial responses from other delegates were largely noncommittal. In Israel, a 
top aide to caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Arafat's speech was 
"full of lies and distortions." 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III reiterated in Washington the United 
States' opposition to stationing a U.N. observer force in the territories but 
said the "idea of the secretary general sending one of his top aides to take a 
look at the situation and return is something quite different." Asked to 
appraise Arafat's speech, Baker said he had not read it.

A ranking Mexican police official "got loaded" on cocaine while he attended 
parties at the home of a Guadalajara narcotics cartel leader, a prosecution 
witness testified Friday during the federal trial of four men accused of 
murdering U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena. 
</P>
<P>
The government witness, Hector Cervantes Santos, said that Federico Castel del 
Oro, a first commander with Mexico's federal security directorate, used cocaine 
at the Guadalajara home of Javier Barba Hernandez, an attorney who was a leader 
of the drug cartel. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes, 30, who served as security chief at Barba's sprawling "La Quinta" 
estate from 1982 to 1985, made the statement during his third day on the 
witness stand under cross-examination by four defense lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony appeared to heap more embarrassment on Mexican police officials, 
who have seen some of their top ranks identified during the trial as 
cooperating with drug traffickers. Four law enforcement officials are among the 
19 defendants who have been indicted for involvement in Camarena's February, 
1985, murder in Guadalajara. 
</P>
<P>
Castel del Oro has not been charged in the Camarena murder. He left his post 
several years ago, according to U.S. government sources, and his current 
position is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
During cross examination, Cervantes said Friday that cartel members and friends 
attending parties and meetings at Barba's home frequently used so much cocaine 
that they had to be revived by doctors who were also in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes also testified that during one of the 1984 meetings where Camarena's 
kidnaping was discussed, Miguel Aldana Ibarra, a commander with Mexico's 
Federal Judicial Police, said that the group needed information about how 
Camarena had learned about a large marijuana operation in Zacatecas that was 
raided in May, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Aldana, who led the raid, has been indicted in the Camarena murder here. He was 
arrested in Mexico earlier this year on other charges, shortly after his Los 
Angeles indictment. 
</P>
<P>
During the raid, about 20 tons of processed marijuana were seized, along with 
150 acres of marijuana fields and enough marijuana seeds to plant about 6,500 
acres, according to "Desperadoes," a book on the Camarena murder by author 
Elaine Shannon. 
</P>
<P>
The raid could have been even more successful had the operators not been tipped 
off by corrupt officials in Mexico's Federal Judicial Police, according to U.S 
Drug Enforcement Administration officials. Although 177 people were arrested, 
the key suspects were able to flee before the raiding party arrived. 
</P>
<P>
During the raid, Camarena -- who had shown up as an observer -- was spotted by 
an aide to drug kingpin Rafael Caro Quintero. Some U.S. officials believe that 
Camarena's presence at the raid convinced Mexican drug traffickers that he was 
a threat and led to the plot against him. 
</P>
<P>
In several less exotic exchanges Friday, Cervantes appeared to be caught in 
significant contradictions. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes said that he had never been shown any photographs of people involved 
in the case by DEA officials. But defense lawyer Martin R. Stolar held up a DEA 
report which showed that Cervantes indeed had been shown photographs. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes also said that the bodies of two people allegedly killed by cartel 
members a week before Camarena was abducted had been buried near a house in 
Guadalajara owned by defendant Ruben Zuno Arce. But one of Zuno's lawyers said 
that his client did not own a house in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes -- who has been paid more than $36,000 by the U.S. government since 
he agreed to become a witness -- acknowledged that he was pleased to be in the 
United States and said that he could be killed if he returned to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Barba, was shot to death by Mexican federal judicial police in November, 1986.

PLANE CRASH IN FULLERTON INJURES PILOT, PASSENGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A small plane stalled on approach to Fullerton Municipal Airport on Friday and 
hit a telephone pole before crashing on a public road 100 yards short of the 
runway. The pilot and his passengers suffered minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Robert P. Kelly, 59, of Anaheim Hills, and Mary DeGuelle, 37, of Westminster, 
were pulled from the wreckage by several people who had raced to the scene of 
the accident on Artesia Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly had taken DeGuelle on an aerial photography assignment for the Orange 
County Sheriff's Deparment, a department spokesman said. DeGuelle is a forensic 
specialist for the department. Kelly is a captain in the Sheriff's Reserve Aero 
Squadron. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses described the rescue of the two as harrowing. 
</P>
<P>
"There was gasoline all over the place so I wanted to get him out of there," 
said Ray Lara, who pulled Kelly out of the wreckage. "He had crawled out, but 
only half way because his feet were caught on something." 
</P>
<P>
With the help of an unidentified man, Lara managed to free Kelly's feet and 
pulled him out of the cockpit while two other people rescued DeGuelle. 
</P>
<P>
The two were were taken by paramedics to St. Jude's Hospital and Rehabilitation 
Center in Fullerton where they were listed in stable condition. No other people 
were injured. Traffic was light on the road at the time of the 10:45 a.m. 
crash.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE AD CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The race: Insurance commissioner. Whose ads? Democratic candidate Bill Press. 
</P>
<P>
Press has two 30-second commercials that try to make the point that he has long 
been a consumer champion on various issues, and, if elected commissioner, will 
take on the insurance companies on the consumers' behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign manager Michael Ganley said the cost of these commercials will be at 
least $100,000. He added that these two commercials will be replaced by others 
before the June 5 primary. 
</P>
<P>
Elements of the ads, with an analysis by Times staff writer Kenneth Reich: 
</P>
<P>
Ads: Press, appearing in one of the commercials, declares that "for almost 20 
years I've been fighting for consumers . . . fighting big oil companies to stop 
offshore drilling, winning against developers to protect our coastline, taking 
on the big insurance companies to stop redlining." Now, he adds, "I want to be 
your insurance commissioner, not just to cut auto rates but to deliver basic 
quality health care to everybody." The other commercial features an announcer 
making the same points. He adds at the end that Press is "the man the insurance 
companies will fear the most." Both commercials note that Press has been 
officially endorsed by the California Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: These ads recite Press' record correctly. As director of the state 
Office of Planning and Research in the Administration of Gov. Edmund G. Brown 
Jr., Press was active against offshore drilling, and he was press secretary of 
the initiative campaign that established the California Coastal Commission. He 
has frequently spoken as a television commentator against insurance company 
redlining of minorities and others, and assisted a private political group to 
establish a hot line for people complaining of redlining. The phrase about 
delivering "basic quality health care to everybody" is a promise. The new 
insurance commissioner does not have the authority to establish new health 
insurance plans, although, of course, the commissioner could lobby for 
legislation or draft and campaign for an initiative on the subject. As for the 
contention that Press is the one the insurers "will fear the most," he is at 
odds with another Democratic candidate, Conway Collis, who contends that he is 
the one the insurers will fear the most.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE AD CAMPAIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By The following is a text of portions of the ads and an analysis by Times 
staff writer Daniel M. Weintraub 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ballot measures: Propositions 118 and 119. Whose ads? Supporters of 
Propositions 118 and 119 and one group opposing both measures. 
</P>
<P>
Propositions 118 and 119 both seek to change the way the state draws new 
political district lines after the U.S. census, an act that can determine the 
balance of power in the Legislature and the state's delegation to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The supporters of Proposition 118 have begun airing a commercial ignoring the 
redistricting issue and focusing instead on another portion of the measure 
dealing with legislative ethics. The Proposition 119 campaign and the united 
effort to defeat both measures are carrying on something of a televised duel. 
</P>
<P>
 The following is a text of portions of the ads and an analysis by Times staff 
writer Daniel M. Weintraub: 
</P>
<P>
From the ad in favor of Proposition 118: "It's in the news everyday. Some 
politician somewhere trades public interest for special interest. You stop it 
with Proposition 118. Stop gifts that corrupt." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: The measure seeks to ban gifts and honorariums from individuals or 
groups that employ lobbyists in Sacramento. But since the initiative amends 
current law, which only prohibits gifts and honorariums received in connection 
with a speech or article on a subject related to the governmental process, it 
apparently would not close the loophole that allows legislators to take money 
from special interests as long as it is not "in connection to the governmental 
process." 
</P>
<P>
Ad: ". . . Close conflict of interest loopholes." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: The measure makes minor amendments to a law that already prohibits 
legislators from voting on any measure in which they have a "personal 
interest." Neither the current law nor the proposed measure defines "personal 
interest." That task is left to the Legislative Ethics Committee. 
</P>
<P>
From an ad in favor of Proposition 119: This ad features Charlton Heston 
responding to an earlier ad in which Jack Lemmon urged voters to reject both 
initiatives: "Jack Lemmon, get honest. You and Willie Brown -- fooling the 
voters again. Last time the Fresno Bee said you 'conned' the voters. The 
Examiner said it was 'an insult to California.' " 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: These lines are referring to the fight over a similar measure in 
1984, after which Assembly Speaker Brown joked that his side had won by using 
an advertising campaign he described as a "con job." 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "Oil, chemical and hazardous waste dumpers paid for your fraudulent 
commercial. It's a hoax." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: The campaign against the two measures depends to some degree on 
corporate sources but has collected thousands of dollars from Democratic 
incumbents and political action committees run by organized labor and trial 
lawyers. The campaigns in favor of both initiatives and against both measures 
are funded in part by contributions from corporations and politicians. The two 
initiatives depended on corporate and political money to get on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "Each time I see your ad, I'll remember the League of Women Voters (says) 
you're wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: The league helped write Proposition 119 and is one of its chief 
sponsors. The measure is opposed by, among others, the Sierra Club, California 
Common Cause and the National Organization for Women. 
</P>
<P>
From an ad opposed to both 118 and 119: The ad features actor James Garner: 
"Now that the world is waking up to the environmental threat, corporate 
polluters and politicians are spending millions to turn back the clock." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: This is a reference to the fact that the Republican Party and 
corporations such as Chevron and Unocal helped put the two measures on the 
ballot and are helping to fund their campaigns. To a lesser extent, the 
campaign against the two initiatives has received money from similar sources. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "It's a power grab that could let big business exploit our oceans, trees 
and few remaining wilderness areas." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Both measures probably would result in more Republican legislators, 
at least in the short run, who have traditionally been less friendly than 
Democrats to environmental issues. But the campaign against the two initiatives 
says that the measures would result in fewer coastal districts and therefore 
weaker representation for ocean concerns. Nothing in either initiative would 
prevent the line-drawers from creating as many coastal districts as there are 
today.

TRAVELERS PAY THE PRICE FOR O.C. AIRPORT'S CONVENIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Gary Lavender were just an occasional air traveler, he might not be too 
concerned about the extra bucks that he has to shell out to use John Wayne 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
But as a sales manager who logs about 175,000 miles a year in the skies, the 
Mission Viejo resident has become a bit unnerved by the price gap between 
Orange County and other Southland airports -- so much so that he now flies out 
of other airports half the time just to keep within his business budget. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of times I don't fly out of John Wayne because I can get much more 
reasonable fares at LAX and some of the other airports," the 42-year-old 
Lavender said. "If I can save $75 to $100 on a road trip, I'll take the trouble 
to drive up to L.A. to catch a plane." 
</P>
<P>
Industry experts blame the sky-high fares at John Wayne on a range of forces -- 
the attraction of Orange County to business travelers who are willing to book 
flights first and ask questions later; a years-old environmental lawsuit that 
forced unusually severe flight restrictions, and the law of supply and demand. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that many of the thousands of local residents who will fly into 
and out of Orange County this Memorial Day weekend will do so with less money 
in their pockets -- sometimes much less. 
</P>
<P>
Data from the U.S. Department of Transportation reveals that for 12 of the 14 
major destinations across the nation, passengers at John Wayne pay higher 
average fares than their counterparts at the three other major airports in the 
area -- Los Angeles International, Long Beach and Ontario; for the remaining 
two destinations, Orange County is a close second. 
</P>
<P>
And while the four airports are separated by only a few dozen miles 
geographically, the gap in dollars can be dramatic: an average round-trip 
ticket to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City, for example, 
would cost $156 more from John Wayne than from Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
"The demand is very high in Orange County, and the supply is just not there; we 
refer to it as our 'boutique market,' " said Dianne LaPorte, vice president of 
operations for the Santa Ana-based World Travel Bureau, which operates 17 area 
travel agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Even with all the current construction and parking problems to muddle through 
at the airport, she said, "the location is very convenient for all the local 
business people who are willing to pay whatever it takes to get there." 
</P>
<P>
People like Grant Lund. 
</P>
<P>
A J.C. Penney store manager in the Sacramento area who sometimes has to travel 
for business on short notice, Lund paid $315 for a round-trip flight into 
Orange County last week in order to attend a meeting in Buena Park. That's 
about the same price as he would have paid had he used Los Angeles 
International -- but $37 more than if he had used Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
"In my case, the expense isn't a factor" in using John Wayne, Lund said. "It's 
the convenience." 
</P>
<P>
Business people, often traveling on short notice through Orange County, are 
plentiful enough to ensure substantial profits for locally based airlines -- 
profits that some industry specialists suggest make the airport one of the most 
profitable in the nation. Local airport administrators say that perhaps 80% of 
their passengers are business travelers, compared to an average national rate 
of about 55%. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining casual fliers, however, saddled with the higher rates, may be out 
of luck -- or on the road to Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ridiculous," San Clemente resident Charles Hayden said of the ticket 
fares as he dragged a suitcase through construction zones at John Wayne this 
past week, just returned from a trip to Nashville with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Hayden said he checked fares for the same trip out of Los Angeles -- and found 
that he could have saved $60. But in the end, he decided grudgingly that it 
wasn't worth the drive or the hassle. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it's just something you have to put up with for the convenience," he 
grumbled. 
</P>
<P>
Not all agree. Consider Lavender, the sales manager from Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
The frequent flier says he used to fly to such spots as Chicago and New York 
City out of area airports other than John Wayne about a quarter of the time; 
now, combating what he sees as an increase in the Orange County gap in the last 
year, he seeks out other takeoff sites about half the time. 
</P>
<P>
That means a freeway trek of more than an hour from Mission Viejo to either 
Ontario or Long Beach, and sometimes more than two hours to Los Angeles 
International -- compared with about 25 minutes to John Wayne, Lavender says. 
But he added: "With those kinds of dollar differences, a lot of times it's 
worth the drive." 
</P>
<P>
No solid data is available on whether the gap between Orange County and the 
three other major area airports is actually growing. (The Burbank airport is a 
bit far even for most cost-conscious travelers.) Some industry officials do 
say, however, that they seem to be seeing more casual fliers seeking out other 
airports rather than paying the extra money. 
</P>
<P>
"The leisurely traveler who's looking for the best price seems to be giving 
more consideration now to traveling out of Ontario or Los Angeles," said 
LaPorte, the travel agency executive. 
</P>
<P>
Added Jack Keady, regional marketing manager for American Airlines: "We've 
discovered that people will travel enormous distances to save what for us would 
be considered small amounts of money." 
</P>
<P>
Industry specialists such as John Wayne Airport Manager George Rebella suggest 
that the ongoing airport expansion -- now mired in controversy by cost overruns 
and delays -- could help bring fares down by nearly doubling the site's annual 
passenger capacity to 8.4 million people. Another regional airport is also in 
the works but is still years away. 
</P>
<P>
But others, such as American Airlines' Keady, assert that there is such a 
terrific local demand among business travelers that, while there may be a 
temporary sag in fares as airport capacity expands, John Wayne prices would 
likely resume their place atop the local airports. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Beyond the heavy presence of local business travelers, industry officials 
say the price gap centers on years of litigation against the county by the city 
of Newport Beach and various citizen groups, resulting in a 1985 settlement. 
</P>
<P>
The litigants' complaints about noise and environmental concerns at the airport 
prompted a master plan, recently revised, that placed caps on the numbers of 
carriers, flights, passengers and noise levels, and also banned nighttime jet 
flights. 
</P>
<P>
"The Orange County airport is one of, if not the most, artificially constrained 
airports in the nation," said Roger Cohen of the Air Transport Assn. in 
Washington. "And the higher prices that you see are the clear result of those 
restrictions on access and capacity." 
</P>
<P>
To understand the restrictions at John Wayne, one need only consider that: 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, with a population of 2.3 million people, the number of annual 
passengers is capped at 4.6 million; by contrast, in Los Angeles, a county of 
8.8 million people, there were about 44 million passengers last year at its 
main airport -- or nearly 10 times as many fliers in a county just over three 
times as big. 
</P>
<P>
With those kind of supply-and-demand forces at work, officials say, airlines at 
John Wayne are essentially dealing from a stacked deck; because for every 
person resigned to making a trip to Long Beach or Ontario for a cheaper flight, 
there is likely someone right behind in line with bags packed and credit card 
drawn, willing to pay the price.

A small plane stalled on approach to Fullerton Municipal Airport on Friday and 
hit a telephone pole before crashing on a road about 100 yards short of the 
runway. The pilot and his passenger escaped with minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Robert P. Kelly, 59, of Anaheim Hills and Mary DeGuelle, 37, of Westminster 
were pulled from the wreckage by several people who had raced to the scene on 
Artesia Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"There was gasoline all over the place, so I wanted to get him out of there," 
said Ray Lara, 20, who added that Kelly "had crawled out, but only halfway 
because his feet were caught on something." 
</P>
<P>
With the help of an unidentified man, Lara freed Kelly's feet and pulled him 
out of the Piper 18 Super Cub's cockpit while two other people rescued 
DeGuelle. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly had taken DeGuelle on an aerial photography assignment for the Orange 
County Sheriff's Department, a sheriff's spokesman said. DeGuelle is a forensic 
specialist for the department, while Kelly is a captain in the Sheriff's 
Reserve Aero Squadron. 
</P>
<P>
Both suffered cuts, bruises and other minor injuries. They were taken by 
paramedics to St. Jude Hospital and Rehabilitation Center in Fullerton and 
listed in stable condition, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred at 10:45 a.m. Traffic was light on Artesia at the time, and 
no other injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Kelly told them his single-engine plane stalled for an undetermined 
reason. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park Mayor Donald L. Bone said the crash underscores a concern for safety 
in both Buena Park and Fullerton. Planes taking off from the airport fly over 
the eastern edge of Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
There have been several crashes near the airport over the years. Most recently, 
the pilot of a small plane was killed March 20 when his aircraft struck power 
lines and slammed into an empty parking lot at the Movieland Wax Museum in 
Buena Park. The pilot had been cleared to land in Fullerton after fog diverted 
him from John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Safety was an issue earlier this week, when the two cities went to court to 
block the state's attempt to relocate to Fullerton its fleet of helicopters 
used to spray malathion on areas infested with Mediterranean fruit flies. A 
Superior Court judge granted their request, but the state has appealed, with a 
hearing scheduled June 9. 
</P>
<P>
"While we're always sad to hear when anyone gets injured in an accident . . . I 
do think that (Friday's) accident points up the fact why we went to court to 
fight the state," Bone said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our concern was the urbanization of the airport and a potential for accidents. 
I think (the accident) justifies and vindicates our arguments before the 
courts." 
</P>
<P>
Bone and Fullerton Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin noted that their cities have formed 
a joint noise and safety committee to investigate crashes at the airport and 
make recommendations about safety and future use of the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Stacy Wolfe said she has lived in the neighborhood for 11 years, long enough to 
witness three aircraft crashes. 
</P>
<P>
"You kind of get nervous about" the planes, she said. "But we have a good 
neighborhood, and it's one of the things we have to live with."

STATE ALLEGES NEGLIGENCE BY DOCTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Medical Board of California has accused a Santa Ana doctor, Rajendra Desai, 
of gross negligence for allegedly prescribing the wrong drugs, overprescribing 
drugs and general incompetence, especially when caring for seriously ill cancer 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. Heidi R. Weisbaum, who is seeking to revoke or suspend his 
medical license, said Friday that some of Desai's patients were given "too much 
chemotherapy," leaving them more depleted than before Desai's care began. 
</P>
<P>
The 67-year-old Desai, who recently retired from a 38-year practice in oncology 
and hematology, was said to be traveling and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Weisbaum noted that Desai had formally contested the Medical Board's 
accusation. She said the case will probably be heard in September in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
A board official said the investigation began two years ago after the medical 
executive committee at Coastal Communities Hospital in Santa Ana revoked 
Desai's staff privileges. 
</P>
<P>
The board official said Coastal's action came after "it was determined that 
Desai's medical management contributed to the patients' death" in seven of 11 
cases that were reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
In compliance with state law, Coastal Communities forwarded a copy of its 
disciplinary action to the Medical Board, and its civil case began. 
</P>
<P>
The board was also notified, the official said, when Desai was disciplined in 
1982 and again in 1984 by Fountain Valley Hospital, which required that his 
admissions be monitored by another doctor. 
</P>
<P>
In its seven-page accusation, the board described Desai's care of 11 patients 
in 1986 and 1987. Two suffered "extremely serious" brain tumors. Others 
suffered breast or other forms of cancer, and several had blood disorders. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of a patient identified as Fred K., a 47-year-old man with 
renal-cell carcinoma, the board charged that Desai administered 6 million units 
of the anti-cancer drug Interferon at the same time as three other powerful 
drugs. The drugs were supposed to be administered sequentially, the board said. 
</P>
<P>
After receiving his medical degree from Bombay University in India in 1949, 
Desai worked at New England Center Hospital in Boston, where he was a Fulbright 
Scholar in hematology and oncology from 1952-1955. 
</P>
<P>
He told the medical board that he served as a Stanford University research 
fellow in hematology from 1957 to 1962. And he came to Orange County in 1965 to 
serve as chairman of hematology/oncology at Orange County Medical Center, the 
county hospital later sold to UC Irvine. A member of the Orange County Medical 
Assn., Desai has been in private practice here since 1969.

SERVICES CONDUCTED FOR 3 KILLED IN CRASH

<P>
The classrooms of San Clemente High School were deserted Friday as hundreds of 
grief-stricken students and faculty members attended memorial services for 
three classmates killed in a tragic joy ride last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Turning out in numbers usually reserved for the famous, they clung to each 
other and tried to make sense of a car accident that police are calling one of 
the worst in the city's history. 
</P>
<P>
Abel Aguilar Jr., 18, and brothers Marco Martinez, 17, and David Martinez, 16, 
were remembered in two separate memorial services. 
</P>
<P>
Teen-ager Jason Diaz told almost 700 people at Our Lady of Fatima Catholic 
Church in San Clemente that his close friend Abel Aguilar was "always there for 
us whenever we needed him." 
</P>
<P>
Diaz said it was Aguilar who would help him through difficult times. 
</P>
<P>
"Abel would always come up and try to make me laugh. . . . I will miss him very 
much," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day at Pacific View Memorial Park in Newport Beach, Grant Sad of 
Jehovah's Witnesses Kingdom Hall in National City, where the Martinez family 
are members, told the standing-room-only throng that "there's no pain greater 
than the loss of a loved one. Certainly that pain is something we'll have to 
deal with today." 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony ended with the opening of the two red caskets at the front of the 
flower-lined chapel. Hundreds of family members, friends and fellow students 
took the opportunity for a last look at the two popular brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the chapel afterward, the mourners milled about, many on the way to a 
gathering at the Martinez family's San Clemente home. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, this being a Friday before a three-day weekend, kids would be 
celebrating," said Kathy Keith, 17. "But not this week." 
</P>
<P>
Police are still trying to sort out details of the Saturday accident. It 
occurred around noon after Thomas Sheehan, 18, and Andrew Felix, 17, were 
excused early from a detention class for talking, school officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Police say that another student in detention, an unidentified 15-year-old boy 
who had taken his parents' 1988 Jaguar to school, was talked into lending the 
keys to Felix and Sheehan so they could listen to the car radio. 
</P>
<P>
The pair met Aguilar and the Martinez brothers on campus, and the group piled 
into the Jaguar and headed out to an isolated stretch of Avenida Pico in 
eastern San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
The car was going about 120 m.p.h. near the intersection of Avenida Pico and 
Avenida La Pata when it veered out of control, police say. FRANK MESSINA and 
LEN HALL

RESIDENTS FRUSTRATED BY MCCOLL SITE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM McQUEENEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a new neighbor of the former McColl toxic waste dump, John Law attended his 
first McColl community meeting this week and listened to residents discussing 
possible solutions. 
</P>
<P>
He left the late Thursday night meeting frustrated, he said, that both the 
federal Environmental Protection Agency and the oil companies responsible for 
McColl seem to have diverse agendas for dealing with it, and neither of those 
agendas seems to be in the community's best interest. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really disturbed by this meeting," Law, 32, said after a representative of 
five oil companies showed color slides demonstrating their proposed solution to 
seal off the estimated 150,000 tons of waste at McColl. 
</P>
<P>
"On one side, you have big government and on the other side you have the (oil 
companies) putting on a dog-and-pony show," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 2 1/2-hour meeting, called by a small group of residents living just behind 
the former dump site, was to allow the oil companies to show their proposal to 
seal the McColl wastes beneath layers of natural and artificial materials and 
monitor the site far into the future. 
</P>
<P>
The oil companies -- Shell, Unocal, Arco, Texaco and Phillips -- have been 
trying to increase community support for their plan, which the EPA calls 
inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
"EPA is mandated by Congress to come up with permanent solutions," spokesman 
Terry Wilson said. "The proposal the oil companies have at this time is not a 
permanent solution." 
</P>
<P>
Although the aim of the meeting was to help residents reach a consensus, about 
70 area residents left still frustrated with the oil companies and with federal 
officials over the lack of a solution to clean up the World War II-era refinery 
waste dump. 
</P>
<P>
Besides residents, also attending were representatives from the oil companies, 
the EPA, the city of Fullerton and representatives of local elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
After studying McColl for several years, the EPA expects to announce its 
preferred cleanup method next March. The EPA holds the oil companies as 
potentially responsible for cleaning up McColl, because the toxic contamination 
is from refinery wastes dumped -- legally -- during the 1940s. The oil 
companies, however, have balked at paying the cleanup costs, estimated to cost 
at least $117 million. TOM McQUEENEY

MAYS EXPLAINS 'NO' VOTE ON PARAMEDICS

<TEXT>
<P>
Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J. Mays, a candidate for the state Assembly, 
boasts in a recent campaign mailer that his support for senior citizens is 
demonstrated by the city's creation of a special, low-cost paramedic service. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the kind of program we need at the state level," Mays says in his 
brochure. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is, Mays voted against the plan when it came before the City 
Council in January. It passed on a 4-3 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Mays said in an interview this week that he now supports the so-called FIREMED 
program. Mays said he voted against it because he feared the program would cost 
the city too much money. 
</P>
<P>
The program's promise of low-cost emergency medical service is based on the 
level of participation, and Mays said he was skeptical about the prospects. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, participants are promised unlimited paramedic and ambulance 
service for $36 per year. 
</P>
<P>
"The city was taking a big risk," Mays said. Now, "we're actually getting more 
participation than we expected (and) I no longer have that concern." 
</P>
<P>
Mays defended his decision to use the program in his campaign literature 
because it is something that he would propose in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't claim that I voted for it or I had anything to do with it," he said. 
"I just said this is a program that could be looked at at the state level." 
</P>
<P>
Mays is running against four other Republicans in the 58th Assembly District 
primary. The district includes the cities of Huntington Beach, Seal Beach and 
Long Beach. DAVE LESHER

DISASTER FUNDS FOR SCHOOLS APPROVED

<P>
Funds to buy emergency medical supplies and other disaster-preparedness 
equipment for schools throughout the district were approved by the City Council 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
Basic supplies will be purchased with the $30,000 appropriation, said Joseph 
Fortier, the school district's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange Unified School District spent $27,000 on emergency equipment for the 
38 school sites in 1987-88, but the stockpile is still insufficient to handle 
demand during a major earthquake, Fortier said.

PRIZE WINNER CITES 99 'HAPPY' YEARS

At 99, Stella King was surprised to be honored as the eldest guest at the 
annual Orange Senior Center luncheon for men and women over 80. While insisting 
that she knew people who were at least a month or two older, King offered 
secrets to her own longevity. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been happy, I think that's part of it. I've had a wonderful life, 
so when my time comes, I don't have any regrets," said King, a resident of the 
Fountain Retirement Center. 
</P>
<P>
A bad back has kept her from participating in most of the center's activities, 
"but I couldn't miss this," she said of the 15th annual "Elegant Eighties-Nifty 
Nineties" party, the center's largest and most popular event. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very special day for everybody," said JoAnn Arntsen, the center's 
activities and service director. The program Thursday, which included 
appearances by City Council members along with entertainment, lunch and prizes, 
attracts many more than the 125 seniors who eat lunch regularly at the center, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lyla Culver, at 84 the founder of the event, said the party's over-80 guest 
list has grown from 17 the first year to 114. 
</P>
<P>
Guests sipped punch and nibbled candy during the pre-lunch program, which 
included a performance by the Orange Blossoms, the center's choral group. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the 'Lawrence Welk' show come to the Orange Senior Center," said 
musical director Marylee Mouser, introducing a song-and-dance number. 
</P>
<P>
Stella King wasn't the day's only prize winner. Bottles of wine or care 
packages went to others, such as the person with the most 
great-great-grandchildren (12) and the person with the oldest living child 
(70). 
</P>
<P>
Dallas Bowman, who will be 92 in June, won a prize for being the oldest man. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what I tell 'em. I don't drink, I don't smoke and I don't chase 
women," said Bowman. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of a kind," said a dining partner. MARY HELEN BERG

Ever since Bradley L. Jacobs became Orange County assessor 15 years ago, his 
only political challenges have come from his own employees. 
</P>
<P>
The June 5 election is no different. Three employees are running against the 
boss. 
</P>
<P>
"There aren't any issues in this election. I am carrying out the laws and the 
state Constitution equally and fairly for everyone," said the 58-year-old 
Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you why my employees run against me," he said. "It is not unique 
to Orange County. It happens in assessor's offices all over the state." 
</P>
<P>
"It is tough to run against your boss," admitted David J. Holbert, 45, an 
18-year appraiser in Jacobs' office. "If I don't win this election or the next 
one, I could be in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
It was Holbert who staged one of the most significant challenges against Jacobs 
in 1986, winning 33% of the vote. But those votes did not come cheaply. Holbert 
spent $225,000 of his own money inherited from his mother's estate. 
</P>
<P>
"What I need to do is pick up another 18% of the vote," Holbert said, adding 
that if he were elected to the $80,000-a-year job he would protect the interest 
of home owners, assess property fairly and be accountable to the taxpayers of 
Orange County. Holbert said he has spent about $42,000 of his own money so far 
in the election. 
</P>
<P>
The other candidates, Larry L. Bales and Victor J. Fulladosa, have spent 
considerably less on their campaigns, but both said they think they have a good 
shot at winning the election. 
</P>
<P>
Bales, 48, a longtime employee in the assessor's office, called on the County 
Board of Supervisors to appoint a special assessment appeals board to handle 
the current controversy over cable television operators' property tax 
assessments, which rose from $2.5 million to $13.5 million over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
"The appointment of a special appeals board would remove the political stigma 
surrounding the issues. . . ," Bales said. 
</P>
<P>
"Morale in the assessor's office is terrible," said Fulladosa, 59, an auditor 
in the office for a dozen years. "There has been a 25% turnover. . . . Managers 
don't talk to the employees, and the employees get ticked off, and when they 
get a chance, they leave." 
</P>
<P>
Fulladosa said that, if elected, he would "restore efficiency and effectiveness 
in the assessor's office, bring competency back into top-level management and 
zealously protect Proposition 13 legislation." 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs pointed out that he was appointed assessor in 1975 in the wake of a 
political corruption scandal that forced his predecessor, Jack Vallerga, to 
resign after convictions for grand theft and misuse of public funds. 
</P>
<P>
"I have paid attention to honesty and integrity," Jacobs said. "I have also 
brought new technology and management techniques to the assessor's office. This 
is a 50- to 80-hour job a week." 
</P>
<P>
But Bales charged that large corporations are getting special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"Brad Jacobs has neglected to assess large corporations their fair share," he 
said. "Although mandated by state law, hundreds of audits have not been 
completed . . . due to a lack of action -- some as long as eight years or more. 
Many special-interest taxpayers have avoided paying taxes even after being 
audited." 
</P>
<P>
Fulladosa said Jacobs has never been an appraiser or auditor and does not 
understand the issues. 
</P>
<P>
"It is like electing a sheriff that has never been a policeman," Fulladosa 
said.

<P>
ORANGE COUNTY ASSESSOR 
</P>
<P>
Bradley L. Jacobs 
</P>
<P>
Home: Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
Age: 58 
</P>
<P>
Occupation: Incumbent 
</P>
<P>
Background: Has been county assessor since 1975, when he was appointed to fill 
the unexpired term of Jack Vallerga, who was removed from office after being 
convicted of grand theft and misuse of public funds. His election challenges 
over the last 15 years have come from his own employees. 
</P>
<P>
Issues: Jacobs has vowed not to back down or grant special treatment to 
companies or individuals because they have a lot of money or a lot of 
influence. 
</P>
<P>
David J. Holbert 
</P>
<P>
Home: Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
Age: 45 
</P>

campaign, receiving 33% of the vote. He has spent $42,000 so far in this 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Issues: He says the county assessor should be an advocate for all the people in 
Orange County. He claims that the current philosophy in the county assessor's

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
A JAIL MEASURE THAT WOULD BE A CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Proponents of Measure A on the June 5 ballot portray it as something that would 
promote efficiency in the criminal justice system. But Measure A is just 
another example of the not- in-my-back-yard syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
It would require that any jail should be built in Santa Ana, near Orange County 
courts. It is being pushed by Anaheim Hills area residents who don't want a 
jail built near them in Gypsum Canyon, the site selected by the Board of 
Supervisors three years ago. Passage of Measure A would not just preclude jail 
construction in Gypsum Canyon, however. It also would tie the hands of the 
Board of Supervisors in choosing any other site in the future. It is a bad 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a decade, the county has been under a court order to resolve jail 
crowding, which has grown worse than ever. More than 50,000 suspected offenders 
have been released early because there weren't enough jail spaces. But the 
board has been immobilized by the staggering costs of constructing and 
operating a jail, and by the controversy over its location. The county has 
spent $7 million on design work on the Gypsum Canyon site, which is owned by 
the Irvine Co., but is nowhere near acquiring it. 
</P>
<P>
Measure A proponents have tried to scare people outside the Anaheim Hills area 
into supporting it by alluding to other possible jail sites that have been 
dismissed or never were in the running. They are on shakiest ground, however, 
when they argue that there would be added traffic and air pollution caused by 
the transport of jail inmates to court appearances in Santa Ana, the county 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
Here the proponents contradict themselves: They have registered no complaints 
about a proposal to put a jail in a remote desert location in Riverside County. 
(By the way, County Counsel Adrian Kuyper says he believes that Measure A, if 
passed, would not preclude Riverside and Orange counties from forming a joint 
powers authority to build such a jail.) 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Mayor Dan Young is blowing smoke around Measure A by accusing its 
proponents of bias and bigotry for trying to "dump" a jail on Santa Ana, where 
there is a large Latino population. Young is trying rhetoric where politics has 
failed: In response to Measure A, he made an unsuccessful attempt to put an 
initiative on the ballot that would have precluded a jail from being built in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Young is right in urging the defeat of Measure A. It would rob 
the Board of Supervisors of needed flexibility in dealing with an 
already-difficult issue.

HIS RETURN IS A RAY OF HOPE FOR THE ANGELS; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: JOHNNY RAY, WHO WAS NURSING A SORE SHOULDER ONLY TWO WEEKS AGO, 
EXTENDS HIS HITTING STREAK TO NINE GAMES.

<P>
All Johnny Ray really wanted Friday afternoon was to grab a snack and some 
peace and quiet before the Angels' game with the Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
But Ray was in demand. A television station wanted the Angel second baseman to 
appear during its newscast. Live. 
</P>
<P>
A newspaper reporter had been badgering him for a few moments of his time. 
</P>
<P>
It's that way when you've had a dramatic two-week turnaround the way Ray has. 
Score the game-winning run in the bottom of the ninth inning one night, then 
drive it in the 11th the next, raise your average 41 points in two weeks and 
hit in nine consecutive games and people want to know how you've done it. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Ray's shoulder hurt when he threw a ball. It was sore when he 
tried to swing a bat. A dull numbness had invaded Ray's right shoulder and 
rendered him useless to the club. 
</P>
<P>
Suffering from bursitis, Ray missed four consecutive games and his batting 
average bottomed out at .200. 
</P>
<P>
"Bursitis, tendinitis . . . it all feels the same, it hurts," Ray said. "It's a 
sore numbness." 
</P>
<P>
Rest was the only cure. Ray lifted weights, which helped strengthen the muscles 
in his shoulder, and that also helped his recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Gradually the pain has subsided, Ray has returned to the lineup and been 
rapping singles and doubles and playing steady defense at second base since. 
</P>
<P>
A single in the first inning Friday at Anaheim Stadium extended his hitting 
streak to 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just been a matter of catching back up with his strength," said Angel 
trainer Ted Bergert, who also has had to tend to injured infielders Kent 
Anderson, Jack Howell, Mark McLemore and Dick Schofield. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't (pinpoint) an exact day or hour, but it feels better," Ray said. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly psyche is in good shape. Since returning to the lineup on May 12, 
Ray's confidence has soared. He came into the game with six RBIs in his last 
four games and nine in the last nine games. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, he drove in the winning run in the 11th inning of the Angels' 4-3 
victory over the Toronto Blue Jays. The night before, he scored the game-winner 
in a 5-4 win. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing it boils down to is consistency," Ray said. 
</P>
<P>
And, as he pointed out, you can't be consistent if you're injured. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough enough to play 162 games when you're healthy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ray is feeling good these days, particularly when he comes to bat in crucial 
situations such as in Thursday's game. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's going to be able to come through 100%, or even 90% or 80%, of the 
time, but you have to believe in your ability," he said. "You can have all the 
talent in the world, but you have to believe you can do it in certain 
situations." 
</P>
<P>
For a change, Ray wasn't the Angels' hitting hero Friday. A two-run home run by 
Chili Davis in the third and solo homers by Dave Winfield and Lance Parrish 
provided the Angels' offense. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield's homer, a high drive into the stands near the left-field foul pole, 
was the 361st of his career, tying him with Joe DiMaggio.

SCHWARTZ, LUCERO FEUD AT SPEEDWAY RACE

<P>
The feud between Bobby Schwartz of Costa Mesa and Steve Lucero of Riverside 
erupted Friday when Lucero crashed into Schwartz on the second lap of the 
scratch main event at the speedway motorcycle racing program at the Orange 
County Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz, the defending U.S. champion, was leading the race when Lucero rammed 
into the rear of Schwartz's bike and knocked him off it. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third time in five weeks the riders have had problems on the track. 
</P>
<P>
The race was called complete on from that point and Lucero was declared the 
winner. Scott Brant of Riverside was second, Dukie Ermolenko of Cypress third 
and Schwartz, who didn't continue, finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Schwartz, 33, confronted promoter Harry Oxley in the track office 
and the pair shoved each other, according to a witness. 
</P>
<P>
"Bobby is a clean rider," Harry Oxley said afterwards. "And it seems Steve is 
out to get him. I don't blame Bobby for being mad and he exploded in the 
office." 
</P>
<P>
Oxley also said the on-track incident would be reviewed further. TOM HAMILTON

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last August, Larry and Nancy Green were all set to adopt a newborn baby. The 
couple spent the night at the hospital with the baby and in the morning planned 
to go home as a brand-new family. 
</P>
<P>
But it was not to be. 
</P>
<P>
The birth parents had a change of heart and decided to keep the child. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just like losing a biological baby," Larry Green said. "We grieved for 
our lost child." 
</P>
<P>
Within a week, the Greens joined the Tarzana-based Adoption Assistance Group, a 
support organization founded in November, 1988, for adoptive and prospective 
adoptive parents. 
</P>
<P>
For Steve and Suzi Blonder, who had joined the same group well before their 
birth mother was due, the adoption failed for a different reason: The baby died 
shortly after birth. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt none of our friends or family could understand what an adoption was 
like," said Suzi Blonder, 35. "And we wanted to be around other couples who had 
gone through it." 
</P>
<P>
The support groups are for people like the Blonders and adoptive mothers and 
fathers who feel they have no other place to go to learn parenting skills, 
infant care or even what is needed to bring the baby home from the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The Greens and the Blonders are among hundreds of Southern California couples 
who have joined AAG and similar groups for help, security and support in what 
many adoptive parents find is a very uncertain process. For security reasons -- 
primarily a fear that a mother who gave up her child might try to make contact 
again -- adoptive parents asked that their home communities not be mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
There are all kinds of legal adoptions, including those arranged by public 
agencies, religious groups and attorneys. The process, AAG members say, can 
take as little as a few weeks to as much as a few years, with costs varying 
from almost nothing to more than $20,000. And still there is no guarantee of a 
family. The Blonders' attempt to adopt was successful -- they are now the proud 
parents of Allison. 
</P>
<P>
Many people turn to adoption after they find they cannot have children of their 
own, said Denice Baum, 39, one of the founders of AAG. Like all parents, they 
also need instruction in infant care, Baum said. But, she added, "The thought 
of many of them sitting in a room of pregnant women in a Lamaze class is not 
appealing. And we found most hospitals didn't even have a program for adoptive 
parents to learn newborn infant care." 
</P>
<P>
Just as importantly, said Baum, adoptive parents wanted to be with people who 
have had similar parental experiences. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a lot of help here," Larry Green said of AAG. "Unless a couple has 
experienced it, nobody else can really understand what you've gone through." 
</P>
<P>
The Greens, hoping to adopt another child, are in contact with a second 
expectant mother, whose child is due in early June. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many support groups, AAG is not directly connected with an adoption 
agency. The groups are open to people who are waiting to adopt, who have 
already adopted or who want to see if adoption is a suitable alternative for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of information you can share with other couples who are thinking 
about adoption or are going through it," Baum said. "Plus there's a lot of 
anxiety you can go through with another couple who understands. If you need a 
hug, you can get one from this group." 
</P>
<P>
Others have had similar experiences with Adoptaides, a support group affiliated 
with the Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first got our daughter, Kacey, she was 11 days old, and we knew no one 
who had adopted children," said Joan Akkerman, 39. "It was a very traumatic 
time. We knew Kacey existed on a Monday, and we picked her up that Friday. I 
was a wreck." 
</P>
<P>
Joan and Michael Akkerman turned to Adoptaides for help in 1982. They have 
since adopted a second child, David, in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Faulk, 37, and his wife, Sheryl Scarborough, 38, turned to AAG after an 
initial bad experience with the adoption process. 
</P>
<P>
An agency matched them with an out-of-state pregnant woman two weeks after they 
had signed up, Faulk said. She had about six months to go before her delivery 
date. 
</P>
<P>
They traveled a lot to see her, "and she needed help," said Faulk, explaining 
that they paid for most of the woman's medical bills, which amounted to about 
$15,000. "A week before she gave birth, she had false labor. It was 
instrumental in changing her mind." The woman kept her baby and the adoptive 
couple lost their money. Faulk and Scarborough turned to the support group soon 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole purpose of an open adoption," Faulk said, "is it has to be a win-win 
situation where both the birth mother and the adoptive parents are happy. If 
not, it's not good for either party." Three months later, they successfully 
adopted a child, Mason, now 1 year old. 
</P>
<P>
Luis and Lily Macias of AAG had two similar experiences in which the birth 
mothers decided to keep the children they had initially planned to put up for 
adoption. 
</P>
<P>
"So we started the process all over again," said Lily Macias, 42, who is hoping 
a third attempt will be successful. "We've been advertising, networking, 
praying, doing anything we could. We have a few things in the fire." 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, Shauna and Jim Lewis adopted Terra, now 9, and joined 
Adoptaides soon afterward. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the adoption, "We felt very alone," said Shauna Lewis, 34. "My 
brothers and sisters were having children the 'normal' way and it was very 
comforting to become part of a group that became families the same way we did." 
</P>
<P>
"The group can become a crying towel," said Jim Lewis, 39, who explained that 
Terra had been made fun of in school when some of her classmates found out she 
was adopted. "But when she came to the support group and saw other adopted 
kids, she said, 'They're OK, and they're adopted.' It's great to know that 
someone is there when you're really down and wondering what you're doing 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Though not all adoptions are a struggle, even the ones that go smoothly can be 
a little unnerving. Two years ago, soon after making contact with the birth 
mother, Leslie and Tom Milwicz became adoptive parents. 
</P>
<P>
"We had no preparation time," said Leslie Milwicz, 36, who said she became 
aware of Adoptaides through a social worker. She said she and her husband were 
concerned about how to tell their child that she was adopted, so they started 
referring to the adoption in the course of normal conversation. "We don't hide 
things from her, we speak about the adoption. It gives you a comfortable 
sense." 
</P>
<P>
For most members, there are many anxious moments connected with the adoption 
process. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a period of time afterward when you are waiting for the adoption to 
be finalized as well as waiting for the birth mother to do everything properly 
and not change her mind," said AAG member Paul Teplitz, 32. "That gets 
addressed within this group as well." 
</P>
<P>
Denice Baum's husband, David, 36, added: "We have a qualified person teach 
infant CPR, have guest medical speakers and guest lecturers who speak on 
everything from children's books to behavioral issues. Groups like ours try and 
give constructive solutions, share what worked and what didn't work, and we're 
available to people." 
</P>
<P>
Besides support groups that generally appeal to couples adopting infants, other 
organizations, such as the Open Door Society, specialize in helping parents who 
want to adopt so-called "hard-to-place" children. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles chapter of the countywide Open Door Society, said member Marsha 
Spector, 48, meets monthly at various locations in the Southland. It is aimed 
at people who want to adopt a child 18 months or older who might have been in 
foster care, been born drug-addicted and who might have emotional problems or 
learning disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
The society also sponsors the Adoption Warm Line, a telephone referral service 
for adoptive parents that addresses the needs and concerns of families before 
and after adoptions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really reassuring for me to know that what you're doing is right," said 
Adoptaides member Sharon Wright, 46, "and that other people have gone through 
the same thing."

<TEXT>
<P>
Amanda Bialack, a precocious and outgoing 4-year-old, opened the front door of 
her family's Encino home, the smile on her face hinting at her excitement. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi!" she said, stretching up to exchange quick kisses with Jeanne Furie. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi, bunky," Furie said. 
</P>
<P>
Hugs and kisses with Amanda's parents, Maggie and Ed, followed before Furie, 
24, joined them on the living room couch and began chatting. Amanda 
participated by joyfully climbing between them and, just as often, on them. 
</P>
<P>
Later that evening, as she jumped up and down on her bed, Amanda was asked 
about Furie. 
</P>
<P>
"She grew me," Amanda explained. 
</P>
<P>
Is she your mother? a visitor inquired. 
</P>
<P>
"No. Maggie's my mom," Amanda replied, as if the answer were ridiculously 
obvious. "Jeanne's my aunt." 
</P>
<P>
In truth, however, both Maggie and Jeanne are, in different ways, mother to 
Amanda. Maggie is her adoptive mother. Jeanne is her birth mother. Together, 
they represent a small but growing number of people involved over the last 
decade in the process known as cooperative adoption. 
</P>
<P>
Cooperative adoption means that ongoing contact is maintained between the 
adoptive family and the biological mother (it is extremely rare for birth 
fathers to maintain contact). 
</P>
<P>
The degree of contact varies and is controlled by the adoptive parents, who 
have legal say over the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Contact may be restricted to a yearly exchange of letters and photos, or, as in 
Amanda's case, may involve frequent face-to-face meetings with the birth mother 
and other blood relatives -- Furie's mother also sees Amanda regularly. 
</P>
<P>
At age 2, when Amanda first began asking about the birth process, she was told 
that Maggie's "stomach was broken" and that Furie helped out by "growing" 
Amanda for her parents, Ed and Maggie, who then adopted her. Just how much 
Amanda truly comprehends is unknown, given the mysteries of the 4-year-old 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, at some level, Amanda understands and is comfortable with the situation, 
the Bialacks say. "I really think kids have a tremendous ability to put things 
in their place without complicating it with the psychobabble that adults add," 
Maggie said. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters hail cooperative adoption as a healthy alternative to traditional 
adoption, a process seen as cruelly secretive and detrimental to everyone, 
particularly the child. Maintaining contact, they say, helps adopted children 
deal with the deep psychological scars that can arise from feeling they were 
abandoned at birth and answers their questions about their identity. 
</P>
<P>
"Children suffer great loss in adoption. The more we can cut that loss, the 
less they suffer," said Sharon Kaplan, executive director of Parenting 
Resources in Tustin and a leading advocate of cooperative adoption. 
</P>
<P>
However, its critics condemn cooperative adoption as a dangerous experiment 
that only complicates an already complex web of parent-child relationships. 
</P>
<P>
"Adoption should be a total transfer of family membership, legally and 
socially," said William Pierce, spokesman for the National Committee for 
Adoption, an independent agency in Washington advocating traditional adoption 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
"Cooperative adoption strikes me as a kind of psychological joint custody or 
prolonged foster care," he said. "Children need one set of parents they can 
rely on in an unambiguous way. Cooperative adoption is just a dangerous fad." 
</P>
<P>
The Bialacks and Furie acknowledge that their arrangement is a journey through 
uncharted waters that most people find troublesome. But they also feel strongly 
that their course of action is preferable to traditional adoption and has 
served them well. Amanda is thriving, they agree, and the openness of the 
arrangement has enriched all their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"The only problem we've had so far is the response of other people who think we 
don't know what we're doing," said Maggie, a 42-year-old bookkeeper. "But we 
do. We're taking it step by step." 
</P>
<P>
If, in the future, cooperative adoption no longer appears to be in Amanda's 
best interest, she said, the arrangement, which is entirely voluntary, will be 
reconsidered. 
</P>
<P>
"She's only 4. We have a long way to go with this," Ed said. "We don't have all 
the answers. We just know what our love and instincts tell us." 
</P>
<P>
The Bialacks were introduced to cooperative adoption by their social worker at 
Vista del Mar Child and Family Services, the Cheviot Hills agency that arranged 
Amanda's adoption. Only about 2% of the 150 adoptions annually arranged at 
Vista del Mar involve cooperative adoption, according to officials there. 
</P>
<P>
The Bialacks met Furie during the adoption and liked her (she was an unwed 
teen-ager; the birth father was already out of the picture). Still, they had 
their doubts. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very threatened at first," Maggie said. "My feeling was, just because I 
can't bear children doesn't mean I want to share parenting. The fear was that 
Amanda would automatically love her birth mother more and run off with her 
someday." 
</P>
<P>
Ed, an attorney who practices business law, said he also felt "very insecure, 
very threatened." 
</P>
<P>
Despite those feelings, the social worker, Selma Hersh, now retired and living 
in Carlsbad, recalled that the Bialacks "immediately sought to go beyond their 
fears. They responded positively to the idea because they felt it was best for 
Amanda." 
</P>
<P>
The first step, taken soon after Amanda's adoption became final, was to contact 
Furie through the adoption service. A letter was sent suggesting further 
contact through the mail. But Furie, still agonizing over the loss of her 
child, rejected the idea. 
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough came when Amanda was about 5 months old. A local television 
news program researching a story on cooperative adoption approached the 
Bialacks for an interview. They agreed and again contacted Furie to ask if she 
wanted to be included. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Furie responded positively. "My situation had changed," she said. "I 
had grieved enough. We hadn't even talked yet about me seeing Amanda, but I 
decided that's what I wanted to do. I wanted to know how she was doing. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize at the time that it would lead to such a major change in my 
life."

STREET HOCKEY: A HOT NEW GAME IN PLAYGROUNDS, PARKING LOTS; 
</P>
<P>
RECREATION: THE CONTESTS ARE HARD-FOUGHT AND SOMETIMES BLOODY, AND ALL YOU NEED 
ARE ROLLER SKATES, A STICK, BALL AND A LEVEL, BLACKTOP AREA. 
</P>

<P>
Spring has sprung and northern lakes are thawing. Wayne Gretzky has hung up his 
skates for the year. With the Stanley Cup playoffs over, hockey will hibernate 
until fall. 
</P>
<P>
But on Los Angeles playgrounds and parking lots, the season is only beginning 
to heat up. Young men are lacing on roller skates, grabbing hockey sticks and 
chasing a plastic ball across the blacktop. 
</P>
<P>
Street hockey, the Canadian version of sandlot baseball, was once as rare to 
Southern California as glacial ice. Now, weekly games have sprung up in 
sun-drenched locales such as Venice Beach and Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
And in the San Fernando Valley, the sport has spread like a brush fire. 
</P>
<P>
On weekdays after school, teen-agers play in Porter Ranch Park and at Lockhurst 
Drive School in Woodland Hills. They go to Balboa Park on Wednesdays. 
</P>
<P>
Older players -- men in their 20s -- start evening games in the parking lot at 
Humana Hospital West Hills, where they skate beneath lights until the security 
guard kicks them out. Each Sunday morning, as many as 30 players show up at 
Lindero Canyon Middle School or Agoura High School. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden, you go by any school and you see people playing," said Greg 
James, 21, of Woodland Hills. "Everybody grows up playing softball or football. 
This is something different." 
</P>
<P>
Hockey on the streets of Los Angeles shouldn't come as too much of a surprise. 
The sport grew instantly popular in this city when Gretzky, hockey's best-known 
player, was traded to the Kings in 1988. Street hockey has also benefited from 
the development of roller skates that look and work like hockey skates. 
</P>
<P>
There are no city leagues or organized games, so no one knows how many people 
are playing street hockey on local blacktops. Perhaps the best gauge comes from 
sporting goods stores. 
</P>
<P>
"It started about six months ago. I started getting phone call after phone call 
asking for street hockey equipment," said Ric Collins, owner of Encore Sports 
in Woodland Hills. "I'm mainly a surf shop but I don't sell surf stuff any 
more; I just sell street hockey stuff. The sport has turned into a madhouse." 
</P>
<P>
Players require only skates, sticks and a paved area. Lockhurst Drive School 
has a small, walled parking lot that is well-suited. Last week, 25 of the usual 
gang arrived: Sean Milder, an especially fast skater; Chris Mahoney, whose 
parents sometimes come out to watch; Greg James, wearing cut-off army pants and 
his hair sprayed so it stood straight up. A car stereo blared a John Lennon 
song as players chose sides. 
</P>
<P>
But before the game could start, the police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"The principal does not want you to be here," an officer told the group. A 
month or so earlier, school officials said, a teacher was struck by a flying 
street hockey ball. "Leave the playground right now," the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
"A wholesome activity interrupted," one player grumbled. "Let's go smoke some 
crack." 
</P>
<P>
Half an hour later, the group had reassembled in a Builders Emporium parking 
lot. Play started quickly and moved at a furious pace, punctuated by clattering 
skates and the occasional thud of bodies. Cries of "Center!" and "Point!" -- 
the hockey equivalent of "I'm open! Pass me the ball!" -- sounded like a 
foreign language on this warm evening. 
</P>
<P>
Street, or roller, hockey is similar to its colder sibling. Teams move 
continually back and forth on a makeshift rink, shooting at goalies who guard 
nets at either end. A bright orange ball, roughly the size of a tennis ball, is 
often used in place of a puck because it rolls smoothly over pavement. 
</P>
<P>
Players don't call any penalties. They wear scant padding because there is 
little checking -- the body-slamming common to ice hockey. Occasional 
collisions are unavoidable. 
</P>
<P>
"About the only difference between street and ice hockey is that it's harder 
when you fall in street hockey," said Dan Winters, 27, who played locally on 
ice as a youth. "You fall on ice and you can slide. You fall on pavement and 
you can tear an elbow up." 
</P>
<P>
The game at Builders Emporium was perhaps less savvy than one would find on a 
Toronto or New York City playground. While several players skated and 
stick-handled gracefully, others lurched about, leaning on their sticks for 
balance. Defensemen occasionally got caught out of position, scrambling to get 
back as the other team rushed their goal. 
</P>
<P>
The game was hard-fought but friendly, as are most. Arguments were infrequent. 
Players often joked as they skated back and forth. When a player fell hard, his 
opponent paused to make sure he was all right. 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers stopped to watch. 
</P>
<P>
"What is this?" an older man asked. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the rag-tag trappings -- parking lots and schoolyards -- street hockey 
can be expensive. Special sticks, with plastic blades to withstand pavement, 
cost $20. Knee and elbow pads run $50. Gloves are $35, and some players make 
due with gardening gloves. A goalie can spend up to $250 on a helmet, stick and 
body padding. 
</P>
<P>
Skates are even more expensive. The footwear of choice is Rollerblades, a 
high-tech skate designed in 1980 by two Minnesota brothers who wanted to 
practice hockey during the summer. Because the four wheels are set in a line, 
Rollerblades stop and start more quickly than conventional skates. They also 
cost from $89 to $215, depending on the model. (Officials at Rollerblade Inc. 
estimate that during 1990 their sales in Southern California will double to 
60,000 pairs, more than in any other part of the country.) 
</P>
<P>
But no discussion of street hockey expenditures is complete without mention of 
the Damji family, who recently moved from Canada to Woodland Hills. They chose 
one house over another because, among other things, it had a level driveway. 
</P>
<P>
"The other house they were considering had a sloped driveway," said Stuart 
Tain, their real estate agent. "The kids wouldn't have been able to play hockey 
on it." 
</P>
<P>
Many players said their parents are supportive, both financially and 
emotionally, of their street hockey habit. "It gets rough," said Mary Mahoney, 
as she watched her sons Chris and Paul play. "But I don't mind it. I know where 
they are and it keeps them out of trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Bloodied knees and elbows are common to the games; serious injuries are not. 
One Valley player recently broke a wrist, another broke some ribs. Both are 
playing again. Doctors at half a dozen local hospitals and sports injury 
clinics said they couldn't recall treating any street-hockey injuries. 
</P>
<P>
None of that impresses Ilene Meyers, the principal who is seeking to banish 
street hockey from Lockhurst Drive School. 
</P>
<P>
"It brings the older people out, smoking and drinking and that sort of thing," 
Meyers said. "That little hockey ball could certainly break a window. I just 
don't think that's what our elementary school campuses are meant for." 
</P>
<P>
For now, the players travel from one schoolyard or parking lot to the next, 
going wherever there's a game. They are a mish-mash breed: whites play with 
blacks, Latinos and Asians. A long-haired college student skates beside a body 
shop manager. Ice hockey veterans -- the only people who played street hockey 
in Los Angeles 10 years ago -- are joined by players who have never touched a 
stick and players reliving the game they grew up on.

COMMON DRUGS MAY INHIBIT SEXUAL ACTIVITY; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: AT LEAST 200 MEDICATIONS -- BOTH OVER-THE-COUNTER AND PRESCRIPTION -- 
CAN AFFECT PERFORMANCE OR ENJOYMENT.

<P>
Is your sex life in shambles? Check to see what's in the medicine cabinet 
before heading to the doctor or sex therapist. 
</P>
<P>
Some widely used drugs can cause side effects that upset the delicate balance 
of the human libido or trigger physical problems that interfere with sexual 
fulfillment. 
</P>
<P>
Topping the list of culprits are blood-pressure pills and psychiatric drugs. 
But at least 200 medications -- both prescription and over-the-counter -- are 
known to influence sexual performance or enjoyment, says pharmacist M. Laurence 
Lieberman, author of "The Sexual Pharmacy" (New American Library, $18.95). 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Taylor Segraves, a psychiatry professor at Case Western Reserve medical 
school in Cleveland, said studies indicate about half of all sexual problems 
stem from physical causes and perhaps 10% of those cases are linked to drug 
side effects. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a huge number, but if you happen to be one of those patients, it is 
quite significant," Segraves said. 
</P>
<P>
For people experiencing sexual difficulties, Segraves recommends that they make 
a list of what medications they have been taking -- and when they started using 
them -- and bring it along when they visit a doctor or sex therapist. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the anti-hypertensive drugs may cause problems with male ejaculation 
or getting an erection," Segraves said, noting that studies have generally 
looked at the impact of the high-blood pressure drugs on male, not female, 
sexual activity. 
</P>
<P>
One type of anti-hypertensive that appears relatively free of sexual side 
effects are angiotensin-converting enzyme or ACE inhibitors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another class of drugs notorious for causing sexual problems are medications to 
alleviate mental disorders. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-psychotics like chlorprothixene and haloperidol have been reported to 
inhibit both ejaculation and orgasm, Segraves said. Lieberman also noted that 
some males taking haloperidol for Tourette's syndrome have experienced a 
decreased sex drive. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to creating difficulties similar to those caused by 
anti-psychotics, some tricyclic anti-depressants may interfere with the ability 
to get an erection, while monoamine oxidase-blocking anti-depressants can delay 
the ability to reach orgasm or ejaculation. 
</P>
<P>
Another bothersome drug from a sexual standpoint may be the acne-fighting drug 
isotretinoin or Accutane. A large-scale study found that 13% of females and 7% 
of males had a lowered sex drive after about one month of Accutane therapy, 
Lieberman said. 
</P>
<P>
There have also been reports of the tranquilizer Valium and other members of 
the benzodiazepine drug family inhibiting ejaculation. In fact, Segraves said, 
some of those medications, which depress the central nervous system, have been 
used in small doses to help men plagued by premature ejaculation. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, doctors had generally thought diuretics -- often prescribed for 
people with high blood pressure -- had no harmful effect on sex. But recently, 
some older men using the drugs have reported problems, Segraves said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to sexual shortfalls, some medications also may lead to troublesome 
excesses. 
</P>
<P>
The benzodiazepines may lower people's normal social anxieties, prompting them 
to engage in sexual behavior they would normally shun. 
</P>
<P>
Drugs that increase levels of the brain chemical dopamine, such as levadopa for 
Parkinson's disease, have been reported to cause spontaneous -- and sometimes 
inappropriate -- erections in some patients. In one study, 10 of 41 patients 
treated with levadopa showed an increase in sexual activity. 
</P>
<P>
In a bizarre association, a couple of patients taking clomipramine, a drug 
recently approved for treating obsessive-compulsive disorder, have reported 
spontaneous orgasms when they yawned. 
</P>
<P>
What should someone do who suspects a medication may be playing havoc with his 
or her sexual enjoyment? 
</P>
<P>
Segraves said the first step should be to find a doctor or other medical 
professional who takes the complaint seriously. In the past, many doctors have 
steered clear of discussions about patients' sexual problems or dismissed such 
difficulties as medically unimportant. 
</P>
<P>
Younger physicians should have received better training about the sexual side 
effects of drugs and may also be more open to discussing sexual matters, 
although some may overlook the role of sex in an older person's life, Segraves 
said. 
</P>
<P>
If the problem does appear to be linked to drugs, a doctor may be able to lower 
a patient's dosage or switch them to a different class of drugs. "The patient 
and doctor have to have a good relationship. It may take a couple months of 
experimenting to find a drug that works," Segraves said. 
</P>
<P>
If changing drugs or lowering the dose would endanger health, Segraves said, a 
patient, after checking with a physician, may want to postpone taking an 
evening or morning dose of the drug until after he or she has intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
If delaying medication is also out of the question, a patient should not 
despair, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Patients can learn to enjoy other forms of sexual intimacy. Some men, said 
Segraves, may be able to artificially induce erection through drug injections, 
and in rare cases, a man may decide to have a penile prosthesis surgically 
implanted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SIDE EFFECTS FROM SOME DRUGS 
</P>
<P>
While their impact on sexuality may not be as dramatic as prescription drugs, 
some common over-the-counter medications can produce side effects that can 
disrupt -- or enhance -- sex and fertility. Here is a short list of examples 
compiled from "The Sexual Pharmacy" (New American Library, $18.95) by 
pharmacist M. Laurence Lieberman: 
</P>
<P>
Aspirin: May help improve male infertility by reducing inflammation of the 
genital tract. 
</P>
<P>
Brompheniramine: As little as 16 milligrams daily of this antihistamine has 
been reported to reverse the occasional problem of backward ejaculation in 
diabetics. 
</P>
<P>
Diphenhydramine: This antihistamine and several related drugs have been found 
to inhibit the movement of sperm, which could result in decreased fertility. 
</P>
<P>
Ibuprofen: At a maximum daily dose of 1,200 milligrams, it may delay the start 
of menstruation up to 14 days. It may also reduce fertility-impairing 
inflammation in men. 
</P>
<P>
L-tryptophan: Sexual disinhibition, such as lewd comments and inappropriate 
touching, have been reported among people given large doses on an empty 
stomach. This dietary supplement was recently recalled by the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration after it was linked to a serious blood disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Vitamin D: May lower the sex drive if supplement is given at doses above 12,000 
units per day.

JOSEPH N. BELL: AGONIZING MEMORY OF POISONED DOGS LIVES ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Somewhere in the upscale neighborhoods that surround the Mesa Verde Country 
Club in Costa Mesa is a person -- probably a man -- who on Easter night threw a 
half-dozen balls of hamburger meat laced with strychnine into the back yard of 
Sharkey and Nancy Warrick. 
</P>
<P>
His mission was accomplished. Both of the Warricks' 11-month-old West Highland 
terriers died painfully and convulsively the next morning after eating the 
poisoned meat. But even if his conscience allows him, he shouldn't rest easy. A 
lot of people, including the Costa Mesa police, would like to see him caught. 
And they don't intend to give up looking for him very soon. 
</P>
<P>
In the cosmic scheme of things, the murders of Speck and Maggie may be a tiny 
footnote. But not to the Warricks or their neighbors. Or to the Warricks' son, 
Joel, who considered Speck his dog. "It's pretty hard to explain this to a 
14-year-old boy," Nancy Warrick says. 
</P>
<P>
She wrote me after my recent column about our weekend at the veterinary 
emergency hospital in Fountain Valley with our desperately sick dachshund, 
Coco. The Warricks were there two days later. Coco pulled through; their dogs 
didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Her letter -- as had Coco's illness -- brought back vividly the memory of a 
wire-haired terrier named Rowdy who was an integral part of our family when I 
was 16 years old. Rowdy also ate a ball of hamburger filled with strychnine. My 
brother and I found him in convulsions on the back porch, and I held him in my 
arms while my brother drove to the vet. He died in my arms before we could get 
there, with one last, massive convulsion. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not a violent person, but I think at that moment if I could have faced the 
person who murdered Rowdy, I might have tried to kill him. There may be human 
acts more contemptible than dog poisoning but that has to rate right up there 
with the worst of them. 
</P>
<P>
So when I received Nancy Warrick's letter, I phoned her. She told me more about 
that terrible morning. It is her custom to get up very early and let the dogs 
out before she takes a morning walk. She did that on the day after Easter and 
the dogs were back in the house when she left. Her husband came down a few 
minutes later and let the dogs out again. Before he went back upstairs to 
shave, he called them in. Only one, the male dog, Speck, came. He dragged 
himself into the house, went into convulsions and died at Sharkey Warrick's 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
Warrick rushed into the back yard and found Maggie in convulsions there. 
Gathering her up, he met his wife coming back from her walk, and they raced to 
the emergency clinic. "They had Maggie stabilized for a while," Nancy Warrick 
said sadly, "and we thought she was going to make it. Then she died of cardiac 
arrest." 
</P>
<P>
Joel was waiting at home with the body of Speck. Together, the family searched 
the back yard and found the balls of poisoned meat. Nancy is a nurse, and she 
recognized the evidence of strychnine -- a deadly poison -- in the grass in the 
back yard. "We have small children in the family who visited on Easter and who 
play in our yard. If they had come a day later, they could quite easily have 
gotten into it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Warricks called the police, and the patrol officer who responded walked 
about the neighborhood interviewing neighbors. Several bits of information 
turned up that seemed more than coincidence. When the Warricks were moving in 
almost three years earlier, they lost another West Highland terrier. They found 
him dead in the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
"We assumed," says Nancy, "that he had a heart attack. Moving into a new 
neighborhood and full of enthusiasm, we chose to believe that. We found no 
poisoned meat then, and we didn't have an autopsy performed." 
</P>
<P>
A year later, a neighbor's dog died under strange circumstances that could have 
been caused by poison. They requested an autopsy, but the vital parts were lost 
and so it was never performed. 
</P>
<P>
The only real lead that was turned up by the police came from a neighbor who 
had looked out her window on Easter night and seen the figure of a man running 
away very fast from the wrought iron fence that separates the Warricks' back 
yard from the golf course -- or more precisely from the end of the driving 
range. The man was dressed all in black, and the witness estimated his height 
at about 5 feet, 11 inches. 
</P>
<P>
"Pets are a special part of our family," says Nancy, "and these two were a real 
joy to all of us. They barked -- at people arriving or walking down our street 
and at those -- not golfers -- who were illegally using the end of the driving 
range. But a certain amount of barking is appropriate and desired. They were in 
the house each evening, all night, and on-and-off during the day. Nothing in 
their behavior warranted being murdered." 
</P>
<P>
The case has been turned over to Costa Mesa Police Detective Dale Birney, and 
he told me: "There is nowhere for us to go at this point until additional 
information comes in." He said that over the past year, there had been two 
anonymous complaints about barking dogs at the Warrick residence, but "they 
were far apart and there was no pattern of complaints." 
</P>
<P>
He says he would be eager to follow up new leads, so if you have any 
information that you think might be useful in identifying this dog poisoner, 
call Detective Birney at (714) 754-5205. The case number is 90-14961. 
</P>
<P>
According to Nancy Warrick, "this is a neighborhood of dogs, and so far the 
only response from my neighbors has been shock, fear and sadness. I'd like to 
believe it was no one in the neighborhood who did this, but whoever it is, they 
must be very sick. I've always been a person who leaves the front door 
unlocked, but I don't feel comfortable doing that any more." 
</P>
<P>
The Warricks say they plan to get new pets one of these days. But they also 
don't plan to remove the pictures of Maggie and Speck that greet them each day 
on the door of their refrigerator. And they don't plan to give up their search 
for the man who killed them. Ever.

WALKING THE TIGHTROPE OF SELF-DISCOVERY;

INDOOR OBSTACLE COURSE CAN LEAD EMOTIONALLY TROUBLED TO CONFIDENCE, TRUST

For 13 years Mona George went through life as a victim, overwhelmed by 
debilitating guilt. But all that changed on The Great Ropes -- a physically and 
emotionally challenging indoor obstacle course. 
</P>
<P>
A terrified George in a mountain climber's harness and safety line stood 12 
feet off the ground on a platform just wide enough to hold one person. Members 
of her small group gathered below to encourage her to jump out and catch a 
trapeze bar about six feet away. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't," George said. "I killed somebody, and I can see his face out there." 
</P>
<P>
George says that when she was 21 she was viciously assaulted and raped by a man 
with whom she had just ended a relationship. Later he killed himself and she 
blamed herself for his suicide. 
</P>
<P>
She had spoken to almost nobody about the incident until she blurted it out to 
virtual strangers at the ropes course that Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Why would George share an intimate secret in a semipublic setting, and why 
would it change her life? 
</P>
<P>
The answer is in the course. 
</P>
<P>
The Great Ropes, part of the Psychodynamics Success Institute of Lake Forest, 
is the only indoor ropes course in California. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of corporations have had groups of their executives graduate, and more 
than 2,000 individuals -- from emotionally troubled teens to people just 
looking for a challenge -- have passed through the course since Ellie Ryan 
built it in a racquetball court more than three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The principle of putting people through physical challenges to help break down 
barriers to emotional and intellectual growth, and to build self-esteem, trust 
and teamwork is not new. Organizations such as the Boy Scouts and Outward Bound 
have been using such techniques since the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years ago corporations started to form softball leagues and have 
company picnics," said Ryan, 45, founder of the Psychodynamic Success Institute 
Inc. and a certified neuro-linguistics programmer. Neuro-linguistics is the 
study of human communication and behavior with an emphasis on overcoming 
emotional obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
"They understood that that type of activity, where people got out of their 
suits and ties, and out of their attitudes, led them to become friends and that 
that type of retraining in the corporate structure worked well." 
</P>
<P>
While other physical challenge courses send individuals on mountain climbing, 
white-water rafting or sky diving adventures, Ryan designed a course that 
eliminates high-risk situations. "All you have to do is kill one vice president 
climbing a mountain and you are in big trouble," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
After experiencing a rope course in Oklahoma, she built her own and tested its 
by having her two children, Rebekah, 22, and Philip, 20, don safety harnesses 
and jump off the garage. "It didn't take much of a scrape of the knees before 
we figured out what worked and what didn't," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
The Great Ropes course is sort of a Jungle Gym for self-esteem. There are 
challenges with exotic names such as the Parrot Perch, where George exorcised 
her guilt; the HeeBee-GeeBee, a steel cable tightrope 12 feet off the ground; 
and the Dangling Duo, a series of swinging logs connected by cables that one 
must scale. 
</P>
<P>
The way people approach the course parallels the way they perform in the world, 
Ryan said. "Sometimes you meet yourself on the ropes course and you don't like 
the person you meet. It gets brought to the surface and now (your behavior) is 
not just something you do, it's a conscious choice and you can choose to change 
it." 
</P>
<P>
That is what happened to Mona George three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at that day as the first day I really began to trust myself," said 
George, who still has difficulty talking about the assault. "I could have 
jumped down off that cable at any time, but something in me said, 'Maybe you 
can take care of yourself up here.' 
</P>
<P>
"I think that guilt is a very powerful emotion and if it takes control it 
buries this other part that says, 'Hey! I can take care of it.' I had viewed 
myself as a slug. I had been that way for so long, I thought: 'If somebody 
takes away all this guilt, there is going to be a lot of room left there.' 
</P>
<P>
"I shouldn't have worried about what was going to fill the guilt. Shoot! 
Happiness is going to be there. And that's what I came to find." 
</P>
<P>
David Sofi, who owns a consulting firm and is president of the Health Research 
Institute in Oceanside, first saw the benefits of the course when he was 
director of marketing for the San Diego-based Boys and Girls Mental Health 
Center -- a residential treatment program for 12- to 18-year-olds with 
emotional problems. The center studied two groups that it sent through the 
course. 
</P>
<P>
"The course had significant positive effects," Sofi said. "We saw much less 
depression in some children and much greater self-esteem, and also discovered 
that the course helped us make breakthroughs in some children who had been very 
hard to reach, very mistrusting of adults. 
</P>
<P>
"They had been denying reality or the effects of sexual or drug abuse, for 
example, and after the ropes course they faced reality, which in their case was 
kind of sad for them," Sofi said. "But this is the first step in recovery." 
</P>
<P>
The center's clinical staff has raised about $85,000 -- half of the money that 
it will need to construct its own building and acquire a $50,000 setup kit from 
The Great Ropes. 
</P>
<P>
"A problem that children who are troubled encounter is that they may not trust 
the rest of the world to take care of them," said Kitt Briggs, the center's 
director of development. "They have to learn you don't go through life 
independently. What the ropes course experience does is it puts them in a 
situation where they have to rely on other people and have others rely on them 
in a team planning strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it would be tremendously exciting to have these children go through 
the ropes course with their parents and with their siblings." 
</P>
<P>
A six-hour training on a Saturday is $80 per individual. For executive groups 
the cost is $295 per person. But no family has ever been turned away, Ryan 
said. "Some people need it for the bonding process." 
</P>
<P>
There have been no serious injuries, aside from a few rope burns. Whenever 
participants are off the ground they are hooked up to belay lines -- a safety 
line held and managed by another person. 
</P>
<P>
Along the course walls are penned the transcendent writings of the course's 
sweaty, flushed and enthralled certified graduates: 
</P>
<P>
"Behold the turtle," wrote Todd Jackson on Oct. 26, 1987. "It makes no progress 
without sticking its neck out." 
</P>
<P>
"Happiness is an inside job," Deborah Lloyd, June 6, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Life is our creation. We create by our thoughts. Change your thoughts. Create 
life anew," Victor Preston, June 13, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Eight and a half years sober. I go high here," F.R.F. 
</P>
<P>
And, "May the course be with you," Anonymous.

SURGERY PUTS SNORING TO REST

<P>
Jan Smith woke up on the couch again, forced out of her bedroom by her husband 
for the fourth time that week. Jim wasn't a tyrant, nor was their marriage on 
the rocks. 
</P>
<P>
The Smiths are just two of the estimated 60 million Americans disturbed each 
night by snoring. 
</P>
<P>
Jim, a 44-year-old real estate agent, has always snored and never thought much 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
His attitude was: What could he do about it? 
</P>
<P>
Jan took the noise pollution that disrupted intimacy harder: "I love sleeping 
with him. After all, he's my husband." 
</P>
<P>
Heavy snoring like Jim's is more than a marital stress, according to sleep 
researchers. It can indicate a potentially serious problem called sleep apnea. 
Because of an obstruction in the airway -- tonsils, adenoids, an enlarged uvula 
or soft palate, or excessive tissue on the side of the throat -- victims of the 
disorder can't breathe properly during sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of times a night, during episodes called apneas, the sufferer actually 
stops breathing for intervals lasting 10 to 180 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Apnea occasionally causes fatal cardiac arrhythmia, or irregularity in the 
heartbeat. The noisy gasps for air that eventually open the airway prevent deep 
sleep and a well-rested feeling. Now, sleep disorder centers are making great 
strides in pinpointing apnea and other sleep problems and are treating them 
with therapies ranging from medication to surgery. 
</P>
<P>
When Jim checked in at the California Center for Sleep Disorders in Oakland, 
Calif., he learned that 90% of sleep apnea sufferers are middle-aged, 
overweight men like himself. People tend to gain weight as they age, and the 
extra fatty tissue, especially in the neck and throat, may make it more 
difficult to breathe while sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
While Jim spent the night in the center's sleep laboratory, his brain waves, 
heart rate, breathing pattern, body movement, snoring and oxygen level were 
monitored. 
</P>
<P>
In the morning, the records showed that Jim had stopped breathing an average of 
20 times each hour, occasionally for as long as 45 seconds at a time. 
</P>
<P>
He had a moderate case of sleep apnea. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. James Piepergerdes, a local ear, nose and throat specialist, agreed to help 
Jim. First, he said that there are a variety of treatments for sleep apnea, 
many very simple. Weight loss can increase the diameter of the airway. 
Sometimes a small change in position can help: Sleeping on one's side seems 
best. 
</P>
<P>
More drastic treatments include continuous positive airway pressure, in which 
the sleeping patient breathes through a nasal mask that draws in air from a 
tank, thus expanding his airway. Surgery can correct or remove obstructions. 
</P>
<P>
To isolate Jim's problem, Piepergerdes X-rayed his throat and jawbone and used 
an eyepiece on a flexible tube to see the back of Jim's throat. 
</P>
<P>
After the exam, the doctor recommended palatopharyngolplasty: the removal of 
one-third of the soft palate and the uvula, a structure used only for certain 
sounds, such as the French "r." The surgery, done under a general anesthetic, 
is 90% successful at stopping snoring or reducing it so it's no longer a 
nuisance, and 60 to 70% effective in decreasing sleep apnea. 
</P>
<P>
After surgery, Jim's snoring and sleep apnea vanished. "I'm much more alert and 
productive during the day," he says. "Surgery has also enhanced my sleep. Now I 
have a lot of vivid dreams." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so happy with the way things worked out," adds Jan. "Now we both sleep at 
night."

ADL, SOVIET COUNCIL TRACK RUMORS, FACTS OF ATTACKS ON JEWS; 
</P>
<P>
ANTI-SEMITISM: THREATS HAVE INCREASED BUT NO VIOLENCE HAS BEEN REPORTED. 
EMIGRATION IS ON THE RISE.

Jews in the Soviet Union have been fearful for months that anti-Semitic taunts 
and threats may turn into violence against them, but a Jewish agency in Moscow 
with connections to the Anti-Defamation League in this country is being careful 
not to raise false alarms. 
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the Vaad, an umbrella council for Jewish organizations in the 
Soviet Union, investigated reports of violent acts against Jews and found in 
each case that they were not motivated by anti-Jewish sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
In turn, the ADL offices in New York passed along the information to other 
agencies and to the public through news releases. That kind of caution has been 
an ADL hallmark, according to National Director Abraham H. Foxman. 
</P>
<P>
"It is important in fighting anti-Semitism in the United States or in the 
Soviet Union to be accurate so that, God forbid, we won't find ourselves 
yelling 'wolf' and the next time, when it really happens, there would be no 
credibility," Foxman said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a widely circulated rumor said Soviet Jews would be attacked 
in a pogrom on May 5, but the date passed without incident. Soviet government 
officials had warned the citizenry that such violence would not be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
"The government didn't speak out with the crescendo that we would have hoped," 
said Foxman, "but it did speak out, and there was heightened security around 
Jewish institutions. We are aware that the Soviet Union is taking (the threat 
of a pogrom) more seriously today than it did six months ago." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Foxman said while visiting ADL's new Los Angeles office near 
Century City, Jews are faced with an uncomfortable irony in the changing Soviet 
Union. Glasnost now allows Jewish groups to function openly, but perestroika, 
the decentralizing reforms, has unleashed social turbulence, including 
anti-Jewish feelings. 
</P>
<P>
"In our country," Foxman said, "we have skinheads, nuts and hatemongers, but at 
least the U.S. Jewish communities, while anxious, know that the law enforcement 
agencies will be there, will protect, will defend. In the Soviet Union, that is 
still an open question." 
</P>
<P>
When Soviet Jews formed Vaad (Hebrew for "board") to give them a central voice, 
the ADL signed a contract with the board to exchange information on reports of 
anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
"If we read in the newspaper that such and such is happening, we check with 
them: Is it true? What are the circumstances?" Foxman said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Foxman, a Jerusalem newspaper reported this month the looting of 
Jewish homes during a riot in Uzbekistan and the slaying of a Jewish man and 
torture of his wife in another region of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
But Mikhail Chlenov, a Vaad co-president, told ADL officials that the rampage 
by Uzbekis on May 2 followed the cancellation of a soccer match and "was not a 
specific Jewish problem." Nor was the slaying related to anti-Semitism. The 
Vaad said that Jews are victims along with many others during times of 
increased criminal activity in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, nervousness about the possibility of anti-Semitic violence in the 
Soviet Union is said to be feeding record rates of emigration to Israel. Soviet 
Jews have been landing in Israel at the rate of nearly 3,000 a week, prompting 
the worldwide Operation Exodus fund-raising campaign by Jewish communities to 
help finance their settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"In Jewish history, Jews usually run after bloodshed, after a pogrom has 
occurred," said Foxman, who was born in Poland during the Nazi-era Holocaust 
and says he owes his life a Catholic woman who hid him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm delighted that here is a situation (in the Soviet Union) where, thank God, 
blood has not been spilled," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Christians at times accuse Jewish leaders of overreacting to perceived threats, 
he said. "We may be guilty of that," Foxman said. "But I say, 'I'm sorry if 
we've upset you. I do not have the luxury to err on not speaking out.' "

ARCHBISHOP BUCKS ANTI-ABORTION TREND;

<P>
Roman Catholic Archbishop Rembert Weakland, bucking the trend toward increasing 
confrontation in fighting legalized abortion, has issued a statement that 
criticizes many in the anti-abortion movement as narrow and lacking compassion 
and urges the church to spend more time listening to the concerns of women 
about the root causes of abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-page statement is the archbishop's response to a series of six 
"listening sessions" held with women around the Milwaukee Archdiocese earlier 
this year. The sessions fulfilled a promise he made in November when the U.S. 
bishops agreed to make the abortion issue a top priority. At the time, 
Weakland, long a spokesmen for women's concerns, promised to go back to his 
archdiocese and consult women on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Weakland not only takes issue with anti-abortion tactics but also advocates 
that the church "allow to our politicians as much latitude as reason permits." 
</P>
<P>
In a number of places, the statement mentions the consistent life ethic, a 
concept that would place abortion amid a whole range of human life issues -- 
including poverty, hunger, education and abuse of children and women -- some of 
which have a direct bearing on women's decisions to have abortions. 
</P>
<P>
While not veering from the church's ban on abortion in most circumstances, the 
archbishop pointed out that the teaching "does not have the full support of 
many Catholics, especially of many women, because it seems to be too simplistic 
an answer to a complicated and emotional question." 
</P>
<P>
The statement's toughest language is aimed at elements of the anti-abortion 
movement and fundamentalist groups, which Weakland sees as heavily influencing 
some in the movement. 
</P>
<P>
"Many dislike the narrowness of so many in the pro-life movement, their 
tactics, their non-acceptance of the consistent life ethic approach, their lack 
of compassion, their alliances with groups that often are very anti-Catholic in 
other areas, their lack of civility and so on," he says. Consequently, he adds, 
many women and priests are being driven away from the movement. 
</P>
<P>
"Many priests, moreover, feel uncomfortable with some of the political and 
other aggressive activities of the pro-life movement. Some of the rhetoric and 
literature seem ugly and demeaning." 
</P>
<P>
Weakland also wrote that he was "surprised and disturbed by the strong 
influence of fundamentalist positions" on the anti-abortion movement. "I say 
disturbed because they did not seem to know the Catholic approach to Scripture 
and fell into proof-texting in ways that are not our tradition. I will have to 
talk much with the priests and other pastoral ministers in the diocese about 
this unwholesome influence and what it means. It might also account for some of 
the narrowness of vision on the part of some of the pro-life people one meets." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the statement criticizes the abortion rights movement's 
advocacy of " 'rights' over one's body or 'rights to an abortion.' " 
</P>
<P>
"The church has never accepted this point of view, namely, that one has control 
over one's body to do with it what one wants," the statement says. "The body is 
not a mannequin nor a machine. Cutting off any part of the body just to show 
that one has control over this 'machine' is contrary to the whole approach our 
faith takes to the body as integral to the identity of the whole person." 
</P>
<P>
On a personal level, the archbishop says he "came away from the listening 
sessions making a few resolutions. I would never be so glib in talking about 
the 'moment of conception' since from a medical point of view that is far from 
accurate: conception is a long process, not a moment. I have learned from 
letters and from the discussion among the health care women that the first days 
and weeks of the growth of a fetus are . . . anything but simple. I know I must 
be more precise and correct in talking about those stages of development." 
</P>
<P>
He says he also will be more careful in talking about infertility and 
miscarriages, having learned that a very real sense of loss follows a 
miscarriage. 
</P>
<P>
"Nor will I talk so glibly about bringing the baby to term and then 'just give 
up for adoption' since I learned that there can be so much grieving here, too, 
and a deep sense of loss that often needs to be faced." 
</P>
<P>
The statement also asks what would happen if a total ban on abortion were to 
occur. "Would the wealthy, because they could afford to do so, then go to other 
countries where abortions would be permitted? Would there be again the 
back-alley illegal practitioners? These are urgent questions, especially if 
there is not a clear consensus of the population on this issue."

The National Conference of Christians and Jews has publicly aligned itself with 
an appeal in the U.S. judicial system for the first time in its 62-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
The organization has announced that it will support an effort asking the U.S. 
Supreme Court to reconsider its April 17 decision in a dispute over whether the 
First Amendment protects the religious use of the drug peyote. 
</P>
<P>
On May 10, a diverse coalition of religious and civil liberties organizations, 
joined by 55 constitutional law scholars, had filed a petition urging the court 
to re-examine its ruling, which limits the application of a "compelling state 
interest" test in free exercise of religion cases. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, national conference board Chairman Ira A. Lipman and President 
Jacqueline G. Wexler said they would back the petition because they "are not 
convinced the court has given sufficient consideration to the ways in which the 
decision may limit valid expressions of religious liberty." 
</P>
<P>
They said they "are not questioning the power of states to regulate the use of 
peyote but are distressed by the constitutional argument put forth by the court 
majority in the case. . . ."

ANGELS HAVE RUN OF LUCK IN 13TH, 5-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT , Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Devon White doubled with one out and scored on two sloppy fielding plays by the 
Brewers as the Angels outlasted Milwaukee, 5-4, in 13 innings Friday night at 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The victory against the American League's worst fielding team was the Angel's 
fifth in a row, a season-high streak, and seventh in their past eight games. 
</P>
<P>
White's sinking liner to left against Tony Fossas (1-3) almost hopped past left 
fielder Mike Felder and was ruled a double. 
</P>
<P>
Playing the percentages, the Brewers walked Dante Bichette, a right-handed 
hitter, to put left-handed hitter Wally Joyner against the left-hander Fossas. 
</P>
<P>
But Joyner never got to hit. Fossas' pickoff throw to second went into center 
field, allowing White to take third, and center fielder Robin Yount's throwing 
error on the play enabled White to come home with the Angels' second 
consecutive extra-inning victory. They defeated the Toronto Blue Jays, 4-3, in 
11 innings Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't particularly easy, but it is very gratifying nonetheless," Angel 
Manager Doug Rader said. "We've always refused to lose, except sometimes 
earlier in the season the other team wasn't listening." 
</P>
<P>
Willie Fraser (2-2), who pitched four shutout innings in relief, was credited 
with the victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels are 3-2 in extra-inning games and 5-6 in one-run games. They are 
within three games of .500 for the first time since May 4. 
</P>
<P>
Angel starter Mark Langston, who went 7 1/3 innings and had a season-high nine 
strikeouts, was elated with the team's winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
"We expected to be going like this all year," he said. "Now that we have our 
bats going, every night we are feeling pretty confident we can win the game." 
</P>
<P>
The Angel offense came to the aid of Langston, who was unable to hold the 4-1 
lead he took into the eighth inning. Milwaukee scored three in that inning. 
</P>
<P>
Home runs accounted for the Angels' first four runs. Chili Davis' two-run drive 
to right in the third and home runs by Dave Winfield and Lance Parrish in the 
fourth were the highlights. Other than that, only one other batter reached 
second against Milwaukee starter Chris Bosio. That was Johnny Ray, who singled 
in the second and moved into scoring position when Parris walked behind him. He 
was stranded when Rich Schu struck out. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield's home run was the 361st of his career, tying him with Atlanta's Dale 
Murphy and Joe DiMaggio, for 35th on the all-time home run list. 
</P>
<P>
Langston's lead was cut to 4-3 before he was taken out of the game. Felder, who 
entered the game as a pinch-hitter, led off with a walk and moved to third on 
Gary Sheffield's double down the left field line. Yount drove in both runners 
when he chopped a single into short left. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Eichhorn relieved Langston, but Milwaukee kept the inning alive when Dave 
Parker hit a grounder to first baseman Joyner, whose throw hit Young in the 
back of the head. The error put runners on first and second with one out. Rob 
Deer forced Parker at second, with Yount moving to third, and Yount scored the 
tying run on Glenn Braggs' single to right. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Vaughn walked, loading the bases, but Charlie O'Brien grounded into a 
force play that ended an agonizing inning for the Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee threatened in the top of the 10th against Fraser, the third Angel 
pitcher. Parker hit a one-out single to center and was removed in favor or 
pinch-runner Darryl Hamilton. Deer lined a double to left that sent Hamilton to 
third, and the Angeles walked Braggs intentionally. Bill Spiers struck out and 
shortstop Gary DiSarcina preserved the tie by running all-out and snaring 
O'Brien's liner before falling face-first onto the grass in shallow left. 
</P>
<P>
Langston was in fine form in the early going, matching his season high by 
recording his seventh strikeout before the game was four innings old. Although 
the suspense of a no-hitter was dispelled with one out in the fourth inning, 
well short of the 5 1/3 perfect innings he pitched in Toronto last Sunday, his 
strikeout pace created a different element of suspense for the fans at Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Angeles gave Langston two runs to work with in the third. White singled for 
the second consecutive at-bat and Davis followed with a home run into the 
terrace seats in right field, his fourth home run of the season and first since 
May 8. It was measured at 378 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Deer jarred Langston out of the groove in the seventh with a looping single to 
right. It became dangerous only when left fielder Davis tried to backhand the 
ball on one hop and instead allowed it to roll to the fence. Deer advanced to 
third, and scored from there on Braggs' grounder to first to cut the Angel's 
lead to 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers' two errors in the 13th gave them 47 for the season, highest in the 
American League . . . Dave Winfield, who established a charitable foundation in 
his name while he played for the New York Yankees, said he's interested in 
becoming involved in similar activities here. One program he's considering is a 
substance abuse prevention campaign for elementary-school age children. "It 
augments what they teach in school," Winfield said. "It's 'Don't just say no.' 
It gives positive alternatives and trains adolescents to feel positive about 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Schroeder caught five innings at Class-A Palm Springs and reported no 
problem with his surgically repaired right elbow. Schroeder, who was 0 for 1 
with a walk, is scheduled to catch there again today. 
</P>
<P>
Donnie HIll (bruised left knee) didn't start Friday but was available. Hill 
injured the knee last Saturday in Toronto and reinjured it Wednesday. A 
magnetic resonance imaging test was normal . . . Greg Minton (right elbow 
surgery) threw off the mound for the first time Friday for three to five 
minutes and had no pain . . . Jack Howell (sprained left knee) has shown some 
improvement, but Bob McClure (left elbow soreness) has not, according to 
trainer Ned ? Kent Anderson (sprained right shoulder) is about the same. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Schofield (strained hamstring) took ground balls and moved laterally 
without mishap . . . Second baseman Johnny Ray extended his hitting streak to 
10 consecutive games with a second-inning single.

ONCE-DISABLED SURFER IS RIDING HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EVAN CUMMINGS, Evan Cummings is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At 17, Gary Clisby was "in the tube." A top-ranked amateur surfer, the 
Huntington Beach high school honor student was also an award-winning artist. A 
member of the National Scholastic Surfing Assn., he had planned to compete in 
the World Surfing Championships held near his home in the summer of 1984. 
</P>
<P>
That Memorial Day, Gary was driving through Malibu with a 15-year-old male 
companion en route to Ventura, where they were to participate in an another 
surfing contest. Out of nowhere, it seemed, a 20-year-old man, driving drunk, 
careened into their car, leaving an inexorable mark on Gary and his family. 
</P>
<P>
The drunk driver died instantly. 
</P>
<P>
Gary's friend was transported by ambulance to a local hospital, where surgery 
was performed to repair severe internal injuries. He recovered and returned to 
school the following September. 
</P>
<P>
Gary was airlifted by helicopter from the crash site and taken to UCLA Medical 
Center. Twice during the trip his breathing stopped; an on-board physician 
performed an emergency tracheotomy. 
</P>
<P>
Once at UCLA, a medical team worked feverishly around the clock to surgically 
correct intestinal injuries and multiple fractures of Gary's neck, legs and 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven facial fractures caused his head to swell to nearly three times 
its normal size. He remained in intensive care for nine days and spent five 
more weeks in the hospital. Two months of home nursing care was followed by a 
long course of physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
In the 72 hours following his accident, doctors said Gary had a slim chance for 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
Six years later, he is the eighth-ranked amateur surfer in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't believe (the doctors) when they told me I'd never walk again. And I 
knew I'd be surfing again. There wasn't any doubt in my mind. I felt a 
tremendous sense of peace about it," says Gary, now 24. 
</P>
<P>
It is not the severity of an injury but how the individual perceives it that 
determines recovery, says Jerry Teixeira Ph.D., director of the clinical 
neuropsychology department at UCI Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen patients view a minor burn on the finger as an entire body 
distortion, while others view a severe body distortion as a burn on the 
finger," says Teixeira, who treats patients suffering brain- and head-related 
traumas and emotional disorders caused by accidents, strokes, sports-related 
injuries and burns. Coping skills and emotional support systems contribute 
significantly to recovery, says Teixeira. 
</P>
<P>
The Clisbys are a close-knit family. 
</P>
<P>
While Gary lay suspended between life and death, his mother, Carol, father, 
Mel, and two older sisters, Cheryl and Karen, took turns standing watch in the 
intensive care unit. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors advised them that each passing hour increased Gary's chances for 
staying alive. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to take it hour by hour and minute by minute," recalls Mel. 
</P>
<P>
"We had always been very close, a traditional family," says Carol. "But that 
closeness had never really been tested before." 
</P>
<P>
That test, she says, reaffirmed all she ever believed about the good in people. 
Relatives, friends, neighbors, business associates and members of their church 
visited the family. 
</P>
<P>
"Fellow surfers who hadn't even met our son heard about the accident and came 
to the hospital to give their support," says Carol. "His jaw was wired shut, he 
couldn't talk or eat, yet people came to the hospital just to sit with him, 
talk to him." 
</P>
<P>
The Clisby family acknowledges that medical expertise played a large part in 
Gary's healing, but they are convinced that his positive outlook, strength and 
courage -- and the family's faith in God -- played a pivotal role in his full 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
"Gary was always the kind of kid who went after what he wanted. He didn't let 
anything stop him," says Mel. 
</P>
<P>
Teixeira agrees: "Thoughts are powerful. When people take responsibility for 
their own recovery, it puts them in the driver's seat. If you are thinking that 
the world is 'doing it to you,' you are not going to feel as if you have much 
control over the outcome." 
</P>
<P>
"Attitude is the way you view yourself; perspective is the aspect through which 
you view a disability or illness," says Allen Lawrence MD, co-founder of Neuro 
Diagnostic Testing Services in Fountain Valley. As medical director there, he 
oversees patient testing for nerve damage caused by illness and accidental 
injury. He became interested in the dynamics of healing 20 years ago during his 
residency at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence recently completed a book on healing and believes that attitude, 
perspective and action are essential to healing and wellness. He is convinced 
that the most important factor in healing is action. "The power that you give 
to the decisions that you make and the action that you take are crucial to 
recovery," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Complete recovery may not always be possible, says Lawrence, but "if the desire 
is great, people can overcome almost any limitation." 
</P>
<P>
He cites as examples armless people who throw baseballs with their feet and 
paraplegics who ride motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence also believes that forgiveness helps heal. "Part of the action process 
is letting go of negative aspects and focusing entirely on the positive," he 
says. "When patients are not mending properly, I look for repressed anger or an 
unwillingness to forgive themselves or another person." 
</P>
<P>
As soon as he was physically able, Gary contacted the father of the deceased 
drunk driver and told the man that he had forgiven his son. "I lost a lot, but 
he lost his son," Gary says. "I wanted him to know I felt bad about what he was 
going through and I didn't want him to blame himself for what happened to me." 
</P>
<P>
Next, Gary took responsibility for his illness. It would have been easy for him 
to hide behind distractions like television or pain killers, but he didn't take 
the easy route. Doctors attempted to prepare him for not being able to walk 
again, but he refused to accept that fate. 
</P>
<P>
To the amazement of his doctors, he took his first steps less than three months 
after the accident. Soon he was surfing again. 
</P>
<P>
His sister Cheryl, 29, a physical therapist, "helped me every day with my 
therapy. She explained everything in detail so that I could understand what was 
necessary and why," says Gary. 
</P>
<P>
Gary's sister Karen, 28, a sales division manager for Best Foods, once 
dismissed her contribution, thinking it was less than Cheryl's. "People often 
think that you have to say or do something really major to help someone who is 
ill, but it isn't so," says Gary. "Karen was fantastic. She sat with me and 
just talked to me, kept me current, raised my spirits. When I could eat again, 
she brought me cookies she had baked." 
</P>
<P>
When someone is seriously ill, says Gary, "you don't have to know all the 
answers. You don't have to talk about the person's disease. You only have to be 
there, treating them like a normal person. When you feel like a person and not 
an invalid, you get well faster." 
</P>
<P>
Annemarie Schwantes, one of Gary's friends since junior high, visited him in 
the hospital. She brought with her photographs from their school days. "We 
became reacquainted. I visited him throughout his recovery, and when he came 
home, we started dating," says Annemarie. "I learned firsthand what an 
incredible person he is. After all that had happened to him, I never saw any 
sign of bitterness. I knew then that someone very special was in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Gary and Annemarie were married last St. Patrick's Day. 
</P>
<P>
The newlyweds work for Billabong, a surf-wear manufacturer based in Costa Mesa. 
Annemarie is assistant controller, and Gary is an outside sales representative. 
He continues to compete in national and international surfing contests and is 
the North American distributor for Australian Surfing World magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Moore, photo editor at San Clemente-based Surfing magazine and a longtime 
friend of Gary, says he is not surprised that Gary Clisby made a complete 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
"He was fearless before the accident, and he's fearless now," says Moore. "I've 
seen him go for waves that terrify other surfers who are ranked much higher 
than him. But Gary will look at a 10-foot wave and say 'No big deal. This is 
nothing compared to what I've been through.' "

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: ISOLATION OF A CHILD OF DIVORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Early reviews of Michelle Latiolais' first novel, "Even Now," praise it for 
being "delicate" and "lyrically evocative" (Kirkus Reviews) as it probes "a 
common theme with new depth and without dreariness" (Booklist). 
</P>
<P>
But a mixed review in Publishers Weekly also describes the Costa Mesa writer's 
sensitively written novel about the struggles of a Northern California girl 
caught between her divorced parents as "slow-moving." 
</P>
<P>
Laughs Latiolais: "I know where the belly blows are going to come with the 
book, but I sort of disagree." 
</P>
<P>
She acknowledges that her novel is not heavy on plot and action. But calling it 
slow-moving, Latiolais said, "is a funny criticism, I think, because is it 
about things that move quickly, or things that go by quickly? No. It's about 
things that stay with you the rest of your life." 
</P>
<P>
More important than how fast "Even Now" reads, Latiolais believes, is the 
emotional response readers have to her coming-of-age narrative about adolescent 
Lisa Sandham, whose world is turned upside-down with her parents' divorce and 
subsequent battle over her custody. The reader follows the introspective Lisa 
as she moves through her teen-age years feeling a constant sense of loss and 
lingering guilt as she charts the uncertain waters of self-discovery. 
</P>
<P>
Latiolais, 33, who has a bachelor's degree in psychology from San Francisco 
State and a master's degree in English literature from the University of 
Denver, is a 1988 graduate of UCI's MFA Program in Writing. She holds the 
distinction of being the only person in the program's history to earn a 
master's of fine arts degree in both fiction and poetry. 
</P>
<P>
She was part of what former writing program director Oakley Hall refers to as 
his "magic workshop." Members included Michael Chabon ("The Mysteries of 
Pittsburgh"), Jay Gummerman ("We Find Ourselves in Moontown"), Louis B. Jones 
("Ordinary Money") and several others whom Latiolais says the public will soon 
be hearing from. 
</P>
<P>
Latiolais, who is now director of UCI's undergraduate writing program, wrote 
"Even Now" as her master's thesis in fiction. 
</P>
<P>
The novel, however, underwent several rewrites over the next two years before 
it was sold to Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux for a $20,000 advance. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised to this day that this book is published; I'm incredulous," she 
said. "You get this response from people: 'I don't want to read anything that 
will depress me.' 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I'm just of the Greek tragedy school of reading. If I have a good cry 
I'm delighted. It's cathartic. I'm not very interested in writing things that 
go by quickly and you never have to think about again. It's not that I'm Miss 
Heavyosity. But with a lot of those things, 'So what?' is my response." 
</P>
<P>
Although Latiolais emphasized that "Even Now" is not autobiographical, she 
tapped many of her own feelings and memories as a child whose parents were 
divorced when she was 7. 
</P>
<P>
In writing her novel, Latiolais said, "I was interested in the isolation of 
childhood. I certainly put those details in. I didn't grow up with very many 
people who had two parents." The marital split that opens "Even Now" causes 
10-year-old Lisa to turn inward, Latiolais portraying the girl's feelings of 
powerlessness, torn loyalties and sense that anything she says to either her 
mother or her father may be used by them as a type of emotional weaponry 
against the other. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a tremendous pressure on children standing between two 
parents, and anything they say and almost anything they do can be construed in 
a certain way -- and they know it too," said Latiolais, who grew up in Sonoma, 
the setting for the novel. "That was a big impetus for the book. I believe that 
children understand and perceive everything." 
</P>
<P>
Divorce, she said, "sets up this vigilance. You're always watching because you 
know that everything could just mutate instantly into something else. You're 
just vigilant and you're always on the lookout and you're so overly careful. 
And I think that causes a lot of pain. I think it closes you down in a lot of 
ways." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, however, teen-age Lisa has gained a sense of self and is on her way 
to becoming an independent young woman. 
</P>
<P>
Latiolais doesn't mind giving that much of the story away. 
</P>
<P>
"From a couple of the responses I've gotten from people, it might be helpful 
(to know) there is an upside to the book -- the fact that it does end up on an 
upbeat note," she said with a laugh. "So I think that's maybe not a bad thing 
for people to hear, that there is a little light."

VIC TAYBACK; ACTOR BEST KNOWN AS MEL IN 'ALICE' TV SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vic Tayback, the actor best known for his role as the gruff diner owner and 
short-order cook Mel Sharples on the long-running television series "Alice," 
died early Friday of a heart attack. He was 60. 
</P>
<P>
Tayback was pronounced dead at 1:56 a.m. at Glendale Adventist Medical Center, 
where he was taken after his wife called paramedics. She said he had climbed 
out of bed, taken a few steps and collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Tayback, a smoker who told his agent Fred Amsel on Thursday that he had again 
given up the habit, had a history of heart problems. He underwent a triple 
bypass in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The Brooklyn-born actor had a 33-year career in film, television and stage, but 
will be remembered best as Mel, the crusty boss whose cooking was so 
notoriously bad that the Heinz food company hired Tayback to advertise its 
foolproof sauces. 
</P>

Tayback created the role in the 1975 movie, "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore," 
and then anchored the cast of zany waitresses starring Linda Lavin for the 
"Alice" series on CBS. It ran from 1976 to 1985. Tayback won Golden Globe 
awards in 1979 and 1980 for Mel's loudmouth, overbearing antics.

<P>
Tayback's film credits included "Bullitt," "Papillon," "The Gambler" and "The 
Choirboys." 
</P>
<P>
He appeared in a number of television series, including "Mission: Impossible," 
"Star Trek," "The Man from U.N.C.L.E.," "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," "All in 
the Family," "The Love Boat," and "Fantasy Island."

Born Victor Tabback on Jan. 6, 1930, the son of Syrian immigrants moved to 
Southern California with his parents when he was a teen-ager. He attended 
Glendale Community College and the Frederick A. Speare School of Radio and TV 
Broadcasting, with the thought of becoming a sports announcer.

<P>
A forced role in a school version of "Stalag 17" taught him that he enjoyed 
making audiences laugh and changed his career plans to acting. Until his career 
took off, he worked as a bank teller and cab driver. 
</P>
<P>
Tayback appeared in more than 25 stage productions, including "12 Angry Men," 
"The Diary of Anne Frank" and "Death of a Salesman." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, he portrayed a Lebanese immigrant in the comedy "An Oasis in 
Manhattan" at the Venture Theatre in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
With other performers, Tayback founded the Los Angeles-based theater group 
Company of Angels.

Wry and down-to-earth off-camera as well as on, Tayback five years ago wrote to 
then-President Ronald Reagan with a proposal for reducing the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
"It's in the form of a national lottery," he explained to a reporter. "You work 
extra hours per month. . . . The money you earn goes into a pot. Every month 
there is a lottery-type thing, and 155,000 Americans win money. . . . It's a 
four-year plan and I say $60 billion can come into the treasury." 
</P>
<P>
But, he conceded, he never heard from the Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Tayback is survived by his wife, Sheila McKay Barnard, whom he married in 1962; 
his son, Christopher; his mother, Helen Hanood Tabback, and a brother and 
sister.

<P>
Mass will be said Tuesday evening at Incarnation Catholic Church, 1001 N. Brand 
Blvd., Glendale. Burial will be Wednesday at Forest Lawn Memorial-Park, 
Glendale.
