TIJUANA WATER SUPPLY TO TRICKLE BACK TODAY;

FULL SERVICE IS NOT EXPECTED UNTIL AFTER HOLIDAY; SAN DIEGO HOOKUP, CREWS 
PROVIDE AID

A ruptured aqueduct that shut off most water supplies to this city of more than 
1 million should be repaired by early today, and water should begin flowing 
into the city by late in the day, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still an emergency situation, but the level of concern has been reduced 
considerably," said Miguel Ravelo, a spokesman for the Baja California state 
public service commission. 
</P>
<P>
However, water supplies are not expected to return to normal until late Tuesday 
-- after the Memorial Day weekend, a major tourist period -- because the 
repaired aqueduct must be tested, filled, pressurized and sanitized, Ravelo 
said. In the meantime, the city will continue to depend in part on sundry water 
supplies, including an emergency hookup with San Diego water lines. 
</P>
<P>
Despite emergency declarations, officials said drinking water has not been 
threatened. Most residents in Tijuana, as in much of Mexico, rely heavily on 
bottled drinking water purchased from private distributors. The water from the 
aqueduct, although nominally purified, is used mainly for non-drinking 
purposes, such as washing and sewage flow. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Complaints Voiced 
</P>
<P>
Residents here are accustomed to breakdowns in the water system and seemed to 
take the lack of water with few complaints. Commercial sales of water were 
brisk, and authorities warned against price-gouging, with rates said to be 
rising among water salesmen. 
</P>
<P>
City officials, wary of losing tourist income, have been downplaying the 
potential impact of the water shortage, noting that many hotels and restaurants 
have their own holding tanks with reserve capacity or have the option of 
purchasing water. Tens of thousands of U. S. vacationers traditionally head 
south for the holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Many restaurant owners were scrambling to maintain their water supply to 
prepare for the weekend, purchasing water in bulk or trucking it in from other 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency began Wednesday morning when an underground, 6-foot-diameter pipe 
ruptured and began spilling water, prompting an eventual shutdown of the 
aqueduct system, which carries water from the Colorado River and supplies more 
than 90% of the city's non-drinking needs. Engineers from Mexico and the United 
States have been working around the clock to fix the metal-reinforced concrete 
pipe and expect to complete the job by about 3 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego crews equipped with gasoline saws designed to cut through concrete 
were helping, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities called for conservation and opened a number of wells as several 
dozen state-owned trucks began distributing water, free to some of the 
hardest-hit neighborhoods. About 500 private trucks were also vending water on 
city streets, which is typical since many Tijuana residents are not connected 
to the city water system. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, officials on both sides of the border arranged a hookup with San 
Diego's water system, providing Tijuana as much as 13 million gallons a day -- 
less than a third of Tijuana's average daily consumption, but still a 
significant flow. The transnational link had been used previously to transport 
water to Tijuana but was abandoned a decade ago when Mexico completed its own 
hookup to the Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
The water sharing caused San Diego officials to ask residents to adopt 
voluntary conservation measures, such as limiting irrigation and washing of 
cars. Officials were hopeful that the diversion would not lower water pressure 
in San Diego, said Henry Pepper, San Diego's assistant water utilities 
director, who noted that water was being pumped in from reservoirs to maintain 
the pressure level. 
</P>
<P>
He said the diversion of San Diego water will continue until Tijuana supplies 
return to normal.

ABEL SCHECHTER; FIRST DIRECTOR OF NEWS AT NBC

SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Abel Alan (Abe) Schechter, the first news director for NBC and the first 
executive producer of the "Today" show, has died in a car accident. 
</P>
<P>
Schechter, 81, was killed Wednesday with his wife, Fritzi, 82, who was driving 
the couple's car when it ran off a Long Island highway and struck a tree, 
Southampton police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Schechter wrote two books about his exploits as a journalist, "Go Ahead 
Garrison" in 1940 and, with Edward Anthony, "I Live on the Air," in which he 
recounted an anecdote that broadcasters were to associate with him for the rest 
of his life. 
</P>
<P>
In that book, published in 1941, he told of the time he directed an NBC Radio 
reporter to set up for what he thought was to be the first broadcast from the 
base of the Egyptian pyramids at a time when remote broadcasts were rare and 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
His reporter arrived to find a CBS reporter already on the air from the 
opposite side of the pyramid. He phoned Schechter for advice and was told, 
"Then go to the top of the pyramid." The order became a catch phrase for 
producers to dramatize the importance of being first. 
</P>
<P>
Schechter, a newspaper editor and reporter, was hired by NBC in 1932 to 
organize and run the network's news department, which he did until 1942. 
</P>
<P>
During World War II, he was attached to the staff of Gen. Douglas MacArthur, 
supervising radio and press communications for war correspondents. 
</P>
<P>
From 1945 to 1950, he was a vice president of the Mutual Broadcasting System, 
which he left to work briefly at Crowell Collier Publishing Co. 
</P>
<P>
He then returned to NBC to help create the "Today" show and became its first 
executive producer. 
</P>
<P>
He left in 1952 to start a public relations company.

L.A. TV'S COVERAGE OF CUP TAKES HIT INTO THE BOARDS 
</P>

<P>
Wayne Gretzky has definitely had an impact on the city of Los Angeles, but I'm 
afraid L.A. is still a far cry from what one would call a hockey town. 
</P>
<P>
Case in point: Game 2 of the Stanley Cup finals was tape-delayed to air an 
Angel baseball game. 
</P>
<P>
I thank Rockey Flintermann of Z Channel for bringing me back to my senses. For 
a while I thought hockey had emerged from the preempt syndrome.

WHAT DOES LAKERS' RILEY HAVE TO DO TO WIN AWARD?

<P>
I do not know how the NBA coach of the year is selected. I do know that the 
fact that Pat Riley has never been selected is insulting to any honest fan of 
the sport. 
</P>
<P>
After the May 14 victory over Seattle, I was sure I had watched not only a 
great team but an extraordinary coach at work. 
</P>
<P>
More than anything, that victory said for me -- "In your face, Tom Heinsohn" -- 
and everybody else who refuses to give this team and this coach their due.

In reference to Magic Johnson winning the MVP over Michael Jordan: Give me a 
break.

Jordan was ahead of Tragic in scoring, field-goal percentage, steals and

<P>
Johnson had Jordan beat in free-throw percentage, assists and turnovers.

And where would the Bulls be without Jordan? No better than the Clippers.

Where would the Lakers be without Tragic? Still in the playoffs.

ERROR JORDAN: REASON FOR THE SUCCESS OF BULLS DESERVED AN MVP TIE

<TEXT>
<P>
On the balloting for the NBA's most valuable player, I cannot help wondering 
how a real basketball fan can say that Magic Johnson is better and more 
valuable than Michael Jordan or vice versa, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
Comparing Magic and Michael is like comparing Muhammad Ali and Mike Tyson, or 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Wilt Chamberlain. 
</P>
<P>
There's no clear winner. 
</P>
<P>
Satisfying both their fans, we can say Magic is the best player on the ground 
and Michael is the best in the air.

NEW BLOOD SOUGHT TO FAN THE FLAMES; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER ITS CUP RUNNETH OVER, CALGARY LIKELY TO BID OLD GUARD ADIEU 
</P>

<P>
The Calgary Flames are being fitted for Stanley Cup rings. In the case of each 
player, it is the first. For some, it will be the last. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames, oldest team in the National Hockey League, can expect personnel 
changes before they leave for the Soviet Union in early September. General 
Manager Cliff Fletcher stuck with the old guard as long as possible and was 
rewarded. Now, it is time to move on. 
</P>
<P>
Co-captains Lanny McDonald and Jim Peplinski seemingly were going nowhere until 
McDonald, after sitting out three consecutive games, dressed for Thursday's 
finale and produced the goal that put the Flames ahead to stay. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first goal of the playoffs for McDonald, 36, who was joined by the 
scratched Peplinski in sweat clothes for the ceremonial skate with the Stanley 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no weight to the Cup at all; you could carry it forever," McDonald 
said. "I was ecstatic about being in the lineup, but I didn't want to just be 
in the lineup. I wanted to contribute and I did." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Terry Crisp, the 12th man since 1917 to win a Stanley Cup as both player 
(Philadelphia 1974 and 1975) and coach, said, "Lanny McDonald was rested and I 
felt to put him back in there with that 'C' on his chest would give the team an 
emotional lift. I didn't put him in for sentiment. The main reason was to win 
the game -- and we did." 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, McDonald said he had not yet decided whether he would retire. But 
Fletcher left little doubt when he said, "That was a great way for Lanny to end 
his career, scoring a big goal in the game that gave us the Stanley Cup." 
</P>
<P>
It was a big 16th season for McDonald, who collected his 500th goal and 1,000th 
point, in addition to his first Stanley Cup ring. McDonald already was wearing 
two diamond rings, one commemorating the 500th goal and another in the shape of 
the Flames' logo, given him by his wife Ardell. 
</P>
<P>
"She gave it to me on my 30th birthday and told me that if I wore it, I'd never 
get old," McDonald said. "You know what? She lied." 
</P>
<P>
Right wing Hakan Loob is headed back to Sweden, where he will join Washington's 
Bengt Gustafsson, Winnipeg's Fredrik Olausson and the Montreal's Kjell Dahlin 
on a Farjestads team that ought to be a potent force in the Elite Division. 
</P>
<P>
Peplinski, defenseman Rob Ramage, right wing Mark Hunter and backup goalie Rick 
Wamsley are others who figure to be playing somewhere else next season. 
</P>
<P>
It would be no surprise if the Flames packaged all of them in a giant deal with 
the Toronto Maple Leafs. Fletcher is known to covet right wing Gary Leeman, one 
of the few Toronto players who could make a major contribution in Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, Fletcher has to make room for several players from the Salt Lake 
City farm club, which reached the final of the International League playoffs 
before falling to Muskegon. 
</P>
<P>
Defenseman Rick Lessard was a first-team IHL all-star in his first pro season. 
Center Paul Ranheim racked up 68 goals and center Peter Lappin had 48. Goalie 
Steve Guenette had an excellent year and could easily fill Wamsley's role. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the matter of Iron Curtain forwards Sergei Priakin and Jiri 
Hrdina, who saw limited duty this season. The Flames have paid too much to the 
Soviet and Czech federations to allow them to continue as part-timers. 
</P>
<P>
If Soviet right wing Sergei Makarov elects to play in the NHL, he would be a 
capable replacement for Loob. Makarov has received his release from the Red 
Army and can come to Calgary if he wishes, providing the Soviets' monetary 
demands are not too high. 
</P>
<P>
All of which means the Flames are in good shape to make a run at another Cup.

SIMI VALLEY FALLS SHORT ONCE AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
MILLIKAN'S 6-3 VICTORY PROVIDES A FAMILIAR POSTSCRIPT FOR PIONEERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
In baseball parlance, it's known as warning-track power. 
</P>
<P>
For the fifth time since 1982 -- and the third season in a row -- Simi Valley 
High lost a playoff game in the quarterfinal round. This time, the Pioneers 
fell, 6-3, to visiting Long Beach Millikan in a Southern Section 5-A Division 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The warning-track label doesn't mean Simi Valley has never won a big game. Far 
from it. The Pioneers are 18-9 in playoff games since 1980, including two trips 
to the semifinals. However, as he has done too often for his tastes, Simi 
Valley Coach Mike Scyphers was left standing on the infield grass, explaining 
away a playoff loss. 
</P>
<P>
"In a game like this," he said, "you need some breaks. They got every break 
imaginable and we got none. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like they always had the momentum. Every play seemed to be an 
exciting play for them and a downer for us." 
</P>
<P>
Scyphers, though, maintained that he was satisfied with the success of the 
Pioneer program, despite all the near-misses in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't get tired of being in the playoffs," he said. "There's only one team 
that can win it all. There's a lot of teams who would love to be where we are. 
</P>
<P>
"One of these years we'll put it together." 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't to be this year as Millikan (20-8), runner-up in the Moore 
League, mixed in a lot of little ball, an occasional display of power, solid 
pitching by right-hander David Mauss and, yes, several good breaks to advance 
to the semifinals against Hacienda Heights Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams scored a run in the first on three soft singles and a sacrifice fly 
off Simi Valley starter Mike Jenkins. They added two more in the second on a 
rally started by a pop-up to shallow right field lost in the sun by Simi Valley 
second baseman Jesse Anguiano. A hit batter followed, then a two-run double by 
Todd Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Millikan led, 3-1, with Anguiano accounting for the the Pioneers' scoring with 
a leadoff home run in the first inning. Mauss (11-3) didn't allow another hit 
until the fourth inning but then struggled in the sixth and seventh. His 
three-year playoff record is 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
"After that home run, I think most kids would cave in," Millikan Coach Dan 
Peters said. "But he pitched his guts out. He had very average stuff today." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams provided support with a run in each of the last three innings, and 
Simi Valley's only reply was Mike Jenkins' two-run homer in the sixth that made 
the score 5-3. Jenkins (9-1), who went 5 1/3 innings, was the losing pitcher. 
It was the senior's first varsity loss in 14 decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Scyphers was able to find some positive aspects in a season that included 23 
wins and only four losses, but others were not as generous. 
</P>
<P>
Junior first baseman Kenny Hood, like many of his teammates, thought that this 
Pioneer team had enough to carry over the warning track and out of the 
ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
"We had it all -- pitching, hitting," Hood said. "Get a few bad breaks . . . 
It's just, like, devastating."

MONROE BEGINS POSTSEASON HEALING PROCESS, 4-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By STEVE ELLING, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Apparently, it takes a full body cast to keep Adam Clark, Monroe High's 
catcher, out of the lineup. When he was 15 years old, Clark broke his right 
ankle, got tired of waiting for it to heal, and had his father saw off the cast 
after four weeks so he could resume playing in Little League. 
</P>
<P>
"He knew what he was doing," said Clark, a senior. "He's a paramedic.". 
</P>
<P>
A month ago, Clark broke the index finger on his right hand, and after missing 
a couple of games, again started chomping at the bit. 
</P>
<P>
"Adam waited about a week before he took off all the tape and bit the skin 
off," Monroe's Tim Costic said. "He got bored and started chewing the dead skin 
away." 
</P>
<P>
The tape was back for Friday's City Section 4-A Division first-round playoff 
game, and, wounded or not, Clark hit a two-run home run in the sixth inning to 
put San Fernando under wraps as the Vikings rallied for a 4-2 win at Monroe. 
Tuesday, Monroe (11-10) will play at Palisades, which on Friday defeated Poly, 
5-3. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 2-2, Clark belted a Frank Serna fastball over the fence in 
left, scoring Costic, who had opened the inning with a triple. The homer, 
Clark's third, handed defending champion Monroe its sixth consecutive playoff 
victory over two years and its second win in a row over the Tigers, who the 
Vikings defeated, 3-2, in the 1988 final. 
</P>
<P>
Are the playoffs a panacea? 
</P>
<P>
"We like to experiment around and try some new things in league," cracked 
Monroe Coach Kevin Campbell, in reference to his team's less-than-sterling 8-8 
record in Mid-Valley League play. "But, hey, we're a veteran playoff club. And, 
obviously, I'm kidding." 
</P>
<P>
There wasn't much for Campbell to giggle about early on. Serna (7-5) was nearly 
unhittable in the first four innings, allowing just an unearned run in the 
third while striking out seven. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando (16-7-1) took a 2-0 lead in the second on a run-scoring triple to 
right-center by Richard Sanchez and a two-out error by Josh Lawrence on John 
Najar's grounder to third. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Henson, a junior left-hander, blanked the Tigers thereafter and finished 
with a six-hitter. Henson (5-5), who struck out 10 in the final last year, 
struck out nine and walked one. 
</P>
<P>
The Monroe defense helped out, turning double plays to end the third, fourth 
and fifth innings. 
</P>
<P>
"The middle infield was great," Costic said. "Did this look familiar, or what?" 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando, uncharacteristically, was unable to mobilize offensively. Four 
San Fernando players were asked to execute sacrifice bunts, and four times they 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
"This was terrible," San Fernando Coach Steve Marden said. "We did not execute, 
we did not play defense, we didn't even cover bases on steal attempts." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, when Monroe scored a run in the fifth to forge a 2-2 tie, San Fernando 
committed two errors of record and a mental miscue when nobody covered second 
on a steal by Jeff Rubell. Rubell -- Monroe's No. 9-hitter -- drove in Henson 
with the tying run on a two-out single to left. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando threatened in the sixth when Bobby Corrales was safe on a throwing 
error by shortstop Mike Enriquez and Rudy Sanchez followed with a single to 
left. Andrew Munoz, however, missed two sacrifice-bunt attempts and eventually 
struck out. 
</P>
<P>
Henson followed by striking out pinch-hitter Fernando Ortega on three pitches, 
and after Richard Sanchez beat out a bunt single to load the bases, Henson 
struck out Najar on three pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Costic, who struck out in his first two appearences against Serna, tripled to 
right-center to lead off the Monroe sixth. Clark then belted Serna's first 
offering over the temporary fence in left. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't make contact sometimes in that same situation," Campbell said. "But 
about two times out of 10, he really comes through." 
</P>
<P>
Monroe, for some reason, seems to flourish as an underdog during the playoffs. 
As a reminder of last season's championship, Campbell hung a press clipping in 
the dugout. It showed Henson being mobbed after the final out at Dodger 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"The playoffs bring out the best in us," Henson said. "No one predicts us to 
win, so we have nothing to lose and we come out relaxed."

Montclair Prep appeared in control for the first five innings of the Southern 
Section 1-A Division quarterfinal playoff game Friday at Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
The Mounties held a 2-1 lead and pitcher Christian Anderson had struck out 
eight and allowed only one ball to be hit out of the infield. 
</P>
<P>
But the sixth inning was a different story. Fillmore scored six runs on six 
hits to post a 7-2 victory and advance to the semifinals Tuesday against 
Aquinas, a 7-6 winner over Tehachapi. 
</P>
<P>
The first five batters in the sixth reached base against a tiring Anderson. 
Mike Kosar's two-run single gave Fillmore (15-6), the defending 1-A champion, 
the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
"We told Chris we were going to let him throw in the sixth even though it was 
getting late in the game and he had been fighting a cold," Montclair Prep Coach 
Walt Steele said. "I thought he was still throwing well and they didn't hit the 
ball hard -- they just did a good job of hitting the ball in the holes." 
</P>
<P>
Montclair Prep (16-6-1) had the bases loaded with none out in the fifth inning 
but came away with only one run when Keyaan Cook was hit by a pitch to force in 
Leland Sparks. PAUL OLSON

In other first-round games: 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy 5, Venice 4 (11 innings) -- Garret Anderson stroked an 11th-inning 
double to score James Campbell from second base and give the second-seeded 
Golden Cougars a come-from-behind win at home. 
</P>
<P>
Cody Beaumaster (4-1) pitched two innings in relief of junior left-hander Denny 
Sharp to earn the win. Sharp struck out 13 in nine innings. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy (19-7) spotted Venice a 3-0 lead in the first inning before tying the 
score with a two-out, three-run rally in the third. Pat DeBoer singled to score 
Bruce Carreau and Gino Tagliaferri belted a two-run home run. It was 
Tagliaferri's 12th home run. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy took a 4-3 lead in the sixth when Travis Bourne scored on a balk, but 
Venice (9-8) tied the score in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy will play host to University in a quarterfinal game Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Grant 6, Banning 2 -- Grant earned a quarterfinal match-up with Chatsworth on 
the strength of a five-hitter by right-hander Javier Delahoya and solo home 
runs by Delahoya, Sean Goldman and Stan Spancer. 
</P>
<P>
Delahoya (9-0) struck out 11 and walked six. He also was two for three and

</P>
<P>
Sylmar 8, El Camino Real 4 -- Senior right-hander Nino Romo struck out six and 
added a two-run double to lead Sylmar to victory on its home field. 
</P>
<P>
A three-run double by Jose Gallegos keyed a four-run Spartan rally in the 
second inning. Sylmar added a run in the fourth to take a 5-1 lead before El 
Camino Real (9-8) rallied for three runs in the fifth to cut the Spartan lead 
to 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
Romo's double in the sixth sparked a three-run Spartan rally to give Sylmar its 
winning margin. Romo (9-2) gave up eight hits and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans (18-3), winners of nine in a row, will play host to Taft in a 
quarterfinal game Tuesday. 
</P>

seventh but left the bases loaded in both innings at Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Eddie Chavez (1-3) was tagged for four runs in four innings. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez, who was one for three, was hit by a pitch in the sixth inning to force 
in the Parrots' first run. Harold Whiteside added a run-scoring single. 
</P>
<P>
Poly (15-7) scored in the seventh when Chavez singled in Shad Martinez.

SALKELD, WARR THROW ESTANCIA OFF BALANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saugus High Coach Doug Worley did his homework. Estancia, the Centurions' 
opponent Friday, had reached the quarterfinals of the Southern Section 3-A 
Division baseball playoffs by virtue of late-inning rallies. Twice the Eagles 
had trailed entering the sixth inning and both times they won. 
</P>
<P>
So Worley aligned his pitching accordingly. Scott Warr, a left-handed, 
off-speed pitcher, started and left after four innings with a two-run lead. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the heat, Roger Salkeld, whose fastball has been clocked at 90 m. p. 
h. Salkeld allowed only two singles and struck out seven batters over the final 
three innings as Saugus advanced to the semifinals with an 8-2 victory at 
Estancia. 
</P>
<P>
The Centurions will play Ontario, an 11-2 winner over Mountain View on Friday, 
in the semifinals Tuesday at a site to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to keep them off-balance, so we showed them two different types of 
pitchers today," Worley said. 
</P>
<P>
At first, it didn't appear that Warr (8-2) would fulfill his part of the plan. 
After being handed a 4-0 lead, Warr barely survived the bottom of the first 
inning. His first 10 pitches were balls and Sean Nichols smacked the second 
pitch Warr threw for a strike into right field for a run-scoring single. 
</P>
<P>
But Warr settled down and allowed only two more hits before Salkeld (11-0 and 
an 0.55 earned-run average) made his appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Saugus (22-4-2) built its lead quickly. With runners on first and third with 
one out in the first, J. B. Johnson singled to center for a 1-0 lead. After a 
walk to Warr, Salkeld grounded to Nye, but the Eagles (21-7) were unable to 
turn the double play and the Centurions had a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Gabe Javage walked Trevor Rice to load the bases, then threw away a pickoff 
attempt and two more runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
Saugus added four more runs in the seventh, three on a home run by George 
Lopata.

DOLLAR REGAINS LOST GROUND AFTER SHARP DROP EARLY IN DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After dropping sharply early in the day, the dollar bounced back in volatile 
trading Friday and closed at just under Thursday's levels. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was the center of a tug-of-war between central banks from around the 
world, which joined forces to push it lower, and traders who viewed a lower 
dollar as a buying opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Thin volume ahead of the long Memorial Day weekend heightened the dollar's 
volatility. Most traders spent the day squaring their positions to protect 
themselves in the event that interest rates rose overseas when U.S. markets are 
closed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants to be exposed too much in the dollar over the weekend," said Jack 
Barbanel, a senior vice president at Gruntal &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
In London, one dealer complained that "the market had no depth" and said many 
players there finished trading at midday. British markets also will be closed 
for a holiday Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar opened lower in U.S. trading on rumors that Japan was about to hike 
its discount rate by 0.75% and was further pressured by talk of a West German 
rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
Traders had expected the dollar to retreat from the highs posted earlier this 
week. The currency smashed the 2-mark level for the first time in 2 1/2 years 
on Monday and finished New York trading at 2.0115 West German marks two days 
later, when it also surged to close at 143 Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
But the central banks took notice of the gains. "For the first time in a long 
time we've seen coordinated central bank intervention by even the smaller 
countries," Barbanel said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, U.S. officials earlier this week spoke out against the dollar's climb in 
an effort to stem further increases. 
</P>
<P>
But when the central banks sold dollars at Friday's lows in an attempt to 
depress the currency further, traders viewed it as a buying opportunity, said 
Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. 
</P>
<P>
While the intervention may have been effective over the course of the week, 
Flanagan said it failed Friday. "The dollar just held at major support points," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 140.40 Japanese yen, down from Thursday's close 
of 142.35 yen. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 140.30 yen. In New 
York, the dollar fell to 141.10 yen from 141.23 yen. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the British pound traded at $1.5922, up from $1.5815 late Thursday. 
But later in New York, sterling dipped to $1.5905 from $1.5910.

CRANSTON URGED AGENCY TO OK SALE OF LINCOLN; 
</P>
<P>
SENATOR SAYS HE WAS 'OUTRAGED' BY BANK BOARD INACTION REGARDING DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sen. Alan Cranston said Friday that he urged federal regulators to let the sale 
of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine go through last month to avoid hurting 
the Arizona economy and the California investors who held much of the $200 
million in bonds from the S&amp;L's parent company. 
</P>
<P>
The California Democrat said he was "outraged" that regulators didn't let the 
parent company, American Continental, sell the institution. 
</P>
<P>
"I never told them to do anything," Cranston said in a telephone interview late 
Friday afternoon. "I said if there's any way to permit the sale, let him do 
it," Cranston added, referring to American Continental Chairman Charles H. 
Keating Jr. "It sure would be a better way to resolve it. Of course, they may 
have had a better way to resolve it." 
</P>
<P>
Cranston said he intervened at the request of Keating, something that the 
senator and other politicians have done previously in the ongoing 
confrontations between the controversial financier and regulators. Two years 
ago, Cranston and four other senators -- all of whom benefited from Keating 
campaign contributions -- met with regulators over the unusual length of time 
regulators were taking to examine Lincoln Savings. 
</P>
<P>
Keating had been trying to sell Lincoln for more than a year. One tentative 
deal fell through in March, and another one was quickly reached with a group 
headed by John Rousselot, a former congressman from San Gabriel. But in tense 
days in early April -- before the beleaguered company and the S&amp;L had filed 
financial reports for 1988 -- the deal broke down. Keating blamed regulators, 
with whom he had been feuding since he bought the S&amp;L in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Keating finally put the parent company into bankruptcy on April 13, and 
regulators seized Lincoln the next day, saying it was being operated in an 
unsafe manner. 
</P>
<P>
In the days before the collapse, Cranston said he urged M. Danny Wall, chairman 
of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and Roger Martin, then one of the three 
bank board members, to reconsider the proposed sale to Rousselot's group. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't think they gave it fair consideration," Cranston said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Wall nor Martin, who has since resigned and moved to Milwaukee, could 
be reached for comment. Other bank board executives also couldn't be reached. 
</P>
<P>
But Karl T. Hoyle, a bank board spokesman, has said previously that the 
Rousselot group simply lacked the cash needed to complete the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"I have the distinct impression that they got into a feud or a vendetta," 
Cranston said about Keating and the regulators. "Keating wanted to get out of 
the S&amp;L business and the regulators wanted him out, too. But they wanted to 
put him out of the business." 
</P>
<P>
Cranston said the failure to approve the sale ruined Arizona's fourth-largest 
company, "messed up" that state's economy and "injured a lot of Californians 
who had invested in the company." 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic senator said Rousselot, a conservative Republican who was "not 
exactly a political bedmate of mine," seemed to be a qualified buyer. 
</P>
<P>
A sale would have put a different group of executives in charge and eased the 
tension between the operators and regulators, Cranston said. He said he didn't 
know if Lincoln could be salvaged now. 
</P>
<P>
The senator said he had intervened at the request of Keating, whose family and 
corporate executives have donated $39,100 to Cranston's campaign funds over the 
last six years. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston said donations don't affect him. He said he would do same -- and has 
done same -- for those who haven't contributed to his campaign coffers. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Cranston and three other senators met with Edwin J. Gray, Wall's 
predecessor, to discuss the unusual length of time it was taking the bank board 
to examine Lincoln's financial condition. A typical two- to three-month exam 
had dragged on for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Gray said that two years ago the senators -- Cranston, 
Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), John McCain (R-Ariz.) and John Glenn (D-Ohio) -- 
tried to cut a deal for Keating. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deny Any Deal 
</P>
<P>
He claimed that they asked him to withdraw a stiff new rule that would have 
hurt Lincoln's nontraditional investments, such as in securities and real 
estate development, and promised to "lean" on Keating to turn Lincoln's 
business strategy more toward traditional investments, such as home loans. 
</P>
<P>
The senators, or their aides, claimed said no such deal was ever discussed. 
They said no promise to "lean" on Keating was ever made, and they denied that 
the subject of the new rule ever came up. 
</P>
<P>
Because Gray said he didn't know the status of the examination of Lincoln, the 
senators, joined by Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich), met a week later with 
regulatory executives from San Francisco, who were overseeing the examination. 
</P>
<P>
"All I did was stick my head in the door and said I wanted to join with the 
others in saying don't drag this examination on and on and on," Cranston said. 
"I said do something or leave him alone. If there's anything criminal, indict 
him." 
</P>
<P>
The other senators also said their only interest was in getting regulators to 
move on the examination because the delays were financially straining American 
Continental and Lincoln Savings. 
</P>
<P>
Keating and his family and corporate executives had contributed more than 
$300,000 to all five senators. The lawmakers said they saw no conflict of 
interest because it was their job to help constituents, regardless of whether 
they contribute to campaigns.

MOTOROLA'S WASHINGTON LOBBYISTS KEEP HEAT ON JAPANESE TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The company's lobbying operation here is laden with former U.S. trade 
negotiators. Officials who once hammered out U.S.-Japan trade deals are now 
touting the firm's interests in determining how they are enforced. 
</P>
<P>
All this may sound familiar. Foreign firms such as Hitachi and Toyota, seeking 
greater influence in Washington, have latched onto dozens of former U.S. 
officials who have left the government for greener pastures. 
</P>
<P>
But in this case, there is a difference. This revolving door leads into the 
offices of an American firm -- Motorola Inc., the electronics maker based in 
Schaumburg, Ill. In fact, two members of the company's "family" have won key 
posts in the Commerce Department. 
</P>
<P>
A rarity among U.S. manufacturers of consumer products, Motorola has 
aggressively tapped government agencies for its strategists and lobbyists and 
sent them off to pressure their former colleagues on behalf of their new 
employers. 
</P>
<P>
"Motorola is just about the only American corporation that really goes about 
that very aggressively," said Paul Freedenberg, who recently left his job as 
undersecretary of commerce to join a Washington law firm. "So far, it's mostly 
been Japanese companies that have been doing that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interest Has Grown 
</P>
<P>
Freedenberg calls Motorola's aggressive posture "a perfectly understandable 
response" to Japan's lobbying effort here and attributes it mainly to 
"corporate personality." Robert W. Galvin, who took over the firm in the 
mid-1950s, became interested in Japan then because his firm was asked to help 
revive Japan's war-torn economy by buying more Japanese-made goods. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Galvin has become more and more interested in international trade, 
building Motorola into a worldwide exporter of a broad range of electronics and 
telecommunications equipment. Over the years, the company has been one of the 
few U.S. electronics makers to have tried to market its goods in Japan. And it 
has become increasingly active in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy has paid off handsomely. Under pressure from Motorola, the United 
States launched negotiations with Japan in 1985 that blasted open Tokyo's 
complex network of trade barriers against switching equipment and other 
telecommunications equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Texas Instruments, Motorola was a major force in engineering and 
shaping the efforts by the U.S. trade representative's office in 1986 to hammer 
out an accord with Japan designed to end predatory pricing and open the 
Japanese market to the sales of semiconductors. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, again largely at Motorola's insistence, the United States imposed its 
first formal sanctions on Japan -- an important turning point in U.S.-Japanese 
trade relations -- ostensibly for violating the 1986 semiconductor accord. The 
sanctions included 100% tariffs on about $300 million worth of Japanese 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Administration Prodded 
</P>
<P>
And early last month, the White House announced that the United States would 
impose additional but still undetermined sanctions on Japanese goods for 
Japan's failure to live up to a 1987 accord requiring it to open its markets to 
U.S. telecommunications products such as cellular telephones and mobile radios. 
Only one U.S. company had been seriously impeded by the Japanese intransigence: 
Motorola. 
</P>
<P>
The well-worn path between Washington and Schaumburg dates back to 1981, when 
Lionel Olmer, then a Motorola executive, joined the Reagan Administration as an 
undersecretary of commerce. Long frustrated by Japan's myriad regulations and 
import barriers, Olmer pushed the Administration to challenge them. 
</P>
<P>
That, in turn, got other government officials -- and Congress -- interested in 
placing high-technology items high on the U.S. trade agenda, and Motorola's 
influence in Washington has been broadening ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Olmer, a partner in a Washington law firm, is now representing 
Japanese clients. But Motorola has developed a host of new links to 
policy-making circles in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The firm hired Veronica A. Haggert, a well-connected former member of the U.S. 
International Trade Commission and a one-time staffer in the U.S. trade 
representative's office, as director of international trade relations for its 
Washington office. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Heimlich, Motorola's director of international strategy in Schaumburg, 
was once a senior official in the trade representative's office and, before 
that, the Commerce Department. And James Gradoville, a middle-level staff 
member of the trade representative's office who was instrumental in drafting 
both the semiconductor and telecommunications accords, works in Motorola's 
Washington office. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Join Lobbyists 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, when Motorola was pressing the Bush Administration to target 
Japan for new sanctions in the telecommunications case, it hired Steptoe &amp; 
Johnson, a Washington law firm, to make the rounds. Michael B. Smith, who until 
early this year had served as deputy U.S. trade representative and had been the 
driving force in negotiating the agreements with Japan, accompanied Steptoe's 
attorneys as a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Although Smith is technically prohibited from lobbying at his former agency for 
a year after leaving office, the law does not bar him from accompanying Steptoe 
&amp; Johnson lobbyists on visits to the Commerce Department, where Smith is 
equally well known and able to project a voice of authority on the trade 
accords he negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
And now two other members of the Motorola family have been named assistant 
commerce secretaries. Michael Skarzynski, a top Motorola executive, will head 
the department's office of trade development, while Michael Galvin will be 
chief of the branch that administers trade laws. Galvin is not actually on 
Motorola's payroll, but his father, Robert, owns the company. 
</P>
<P>
As even Motorola's opponents concede, there is nothing illegal about the 
increasingly close links between Motorola and Washington's trade policy-making 
establishment. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that they have former government people on the payroll is not a big 
issue," said Stanton D. Anderson, a Washington lawyer who has frequently been 
criticized for representing Japanese companies. Motorola may be influential, he 
said, "but no more than any industry that has been dominant in its field." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Government Supportive 
</P>
<P>
Smith finds nothing wrong with the close relationship between the trade 
representative's office, where he used to work, and such U.S. companies as 
Motorola. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been very active for a long time, and I would say that by and large 
the U.S. government has been very supportive," Smith said. "They have used the 
law to petition the government to go after other trade barriers." 
</P>
<P>
Freedenberg, the former undersecretary of commerce, says Motorola's 
relationship with the government falls short of a worrisome link between 
private and public interests. "The danger is if somehow they have an undue 
influence on where the government's going," he said. "But that's a judgment 
call that people have to make." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone would agree that what is good for Motorola has been good for 
America. The State Department argues that lashing out at Japan with formal 
trade sanctions risks alienating the one ally that America will need most in 
Asia for the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
More specifically, American firms that use microchips in manufacturing other 
products have charged that the 1986 semiconductor accord worsened a shortage of 
chips in late 1987 and 1988, sending chip prices soaring and making U.S. 
computer manufacturers uncompetitive. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Washington's decision to retaliate against Japan in the semiconductor 
case in April, 1987, helped send the stock market plummeting over fears of 
growing U.S. protectionism. 
</P>
<P>
And as for the forthcoming sanctions likely to be imposed in response to 
Japanese telecommunications barriers, they will not be painless in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oppose Sanctions 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of more than 50 U.S. firms that manufacture everything from 
cosmetics to chemicals crowded into a hearing room at the U.S. International 
Trade Commission this week to ask the Administration not to impose its punitive 
tariffs on Japanese products that they use in their own businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"We are seriously concerned about the propriety of imposing sanctions so 
broadly when the problem concerns so narrow a segment of an entire industry," 
said Edwin B. Spievack, president of the North American Telecommunications 
Assn., which represents some 750 manufacturers and suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
Spievack warned the hearing panel that if the Administration, as expected, 
imposes sanctions, "the American consumer and American businesses -- many of 
them in small businesses -- will be forced to bear penalties greater than those 
Japan may experience." Broad retaliation now, he concluded, "would be out of 
all proportion" to the offense. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration is expected to decide which imports to target within a few 
weeks. In the meantime, negotiations with Japan are continuing in an effort to 
resolve the dispute without resort to penalties. Motorola President George M. 
C. Fisher was in Tokyo last week trying to hammer out a compromise.

The Bank of Japan, which has been battling to secure an increase in the 
official discount rate in the face of opposition from other Japanese government 
agencies, appears to have won the day after weeks of intense debate. 
</P>
<P>
The bank announced Friday that it will raise the official discount rate next 
week for the first time in nine years in response to increases in official 
rates abroad and fears of a resurgence in inflation at home. 
</P>
<P>
The central bank will lift the rate by 0.75 percentage points to 3.25% at a 
policy board meeting on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The bank made the announcement following the publication of figures Friday that 
showed sharper-than-expected increases in consumer prices in April and May. 
These came at the end of a week in which fears of a resurgence of inflation had 
already been exacerbated by a sharp decline in the international value of the 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sharp Price Rise 
</P>
<P>
Central bank officials declined to comment directly on the possibility of a 
rise in the official discount rate from its all-time low. However, on Friday 
night they indicated to Japanese newspapers and television stations that rates 
would be raised. 
</P>
<P>
The prices data published Friday showed that in April, consumer prices rose by 
2.4% from a year earlier, the highest monthly increase in 12 years. The 
increase is not as significant as it seems because it is boosted by the 
introduction of a 3% consumption tax in April. But both the central bank and 
private sector economists detected signs of underlying increases in prices. 
</P>
<P>
These concerns were reinforced by consumer price figures for Tokyo for May, 
also published Friday.

CONSUMER SPENDING IN APRIL UP A ROBUST 1.1%

<P>
Consumer spending in April posted its best performance in nearly a year, rising 
1.1%, the government said Friday in a report that analysts said shows the 
economy remains healthy even as growth slows. 
</P>
<P>
While consumer spending rose at its fastest pace since a 1.3% increase last 
June, much of the growth was attributed to a sharp increase in auto sales 
because of rebates, low-interest loans and other industry incentives to move 
cars off dealers' lots. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department also reported that personal income rose a weak 0.4% 
last month, compared to hikes of 0.8% in March and 1% in February. The April 
figure was the smallest increase since last November's 0.2%. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts blamed the sluggish income growth in April on lower farm subsidies 
over the past two months and on a fallback from higher auto industry bonuses 
and retroactive Social Security payments in March. 
</P>
<P>
Discounting the auto sales and one-time weakness in incomes, "what you come out 
with is reasonably decent income and consumption growth which tends to make the 
Fed's soft-landing scenario look more realistic," said analyst Cynthia Latta of 
Data Resources in Lexington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve credit-tightening designed to stem inflation has caused some 
economists to worry that resulting higher interest rates could move the economy 
into a recession, rather than the targeted soft landing. 
</P>
<P>
But recent reports continue to point to an economic slowdown without recession. 
</P>
<P>
And Friday's income and spending report tells the Fed "that so far, so good; 
that there's no reason to change what they're doing because it doesn't yet look 
like they're guilty of overkill," Latta said.

Bid Made for Sea Containers: Sweden's Stena Holding AG and Britain's Tiphook 
PLC announced a joint bid of $824 million for Bermuda-based Sea Containers 
Ltd., a diversified ocean shipping company that operates the leading ferry 
service across the English Channel. Stena announced March 13 that it owned 8.2% 
of Sea Containers' common stock and has since been rumored to be preparing a 
bid. Sea Containers' stock now has risen more than 50% from its price of 
$36.125 before Stena's March announcement. Sea Containers is considered to be 
attractive because of its British real estate and ferry operation.

 Great American First Savings Bank said it will probably take a charge on 
earnings of $8 million to $14 million, possibly in the current quarter to end 
June 30, at the urging of federal regulators, because of a revision of the 
future value of the S&amp;L's future loan servicing income. 
</P>
<P>
The exact timing of the charge on earnings will depend on when Great American 
reaches a final agreement with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, spokesman Kenn 
Ulrich said Friday. Ulrich said Great American expects to recoup the charge as 
earned income over a five-year period.

ANALYSTS PREDICT MORE VACATION DRIVING, BUT SHORTER TRIPS DUE TO RISING GAS 
PRICES 
</P>

Vacationers are expected to drive more this summer than last despite the recent 
jump in gasoline prices but will take shorter trips, according to travel 
industry groups. 
</P>
<P>
Motor vehicles will account for nearly 83% of all summer travel, with 273 
million vacationers expected to travel the nation's roads and highways in the 
14-week period between Memorial Day and Labor Day, a 4% increase over 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"The sharp increases in gasoline prices since March, 1989, although higher than 
usual for the pre-summer travel season, are not expected to be a serious 
deterrent to auto vacation travel this summer," according to the 
Washington-based U.S. Travel Data Center. The center's data are based on a 
national telephone survey of 1,500 households. 
</P>
<P>
Retail gasoline prices have risen an average of 17.4 cents a gallon since 
Easter weekend, the steepest rise between holidays since Christmas, 1979, and 
Easter, 1980, when prices jumped 19 cents a gallon, according to the American 
Automobile Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The average retail cost of a gallon of gasoline is $1.254, with actual costs 
varying between cities, states and regions and self-serve or full-service 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
Air travel is expected to remain relatively stable at last summer's level, 
representing about 15% of all vacation travel, while bus and train travel, 
which represents 1%, is expected to be at capacity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
16% Increase 
</P>
<P>
Airline fares increased far more than gasoline in the first quarter of 1989 -- 
6.2% compared with 2.5% -- but second-quarter gas prices have leaped more than 
16% due to a combination of factors, including the Alaska oil spill and the 
strong rise in crude oil prices since January, according to the AAA. 
</P>
<P>
Overall summer vacation travel is expected to rise about 3% from last year, 
with vacationers generally opting for shorter trips, industry surveys indicate. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of all summer travelers will make round trips of 500 miles or 
less, according to the AAA. Average domestic miles traveled are projected to 
decline to 920 from 970 last summer. 
</P>
<P>
"America wants to travel more than ever and its people are going to satisfy 
this desire even if the demands of time and two-income families are forcing 
them to take three- and four-day trips in place of one- and two-week 
vacations," said Suzanne Cook, director of the AAA data center. 
</P>
<P>
According to the center's survey, the volume of day trips and trips of up to 
three nights will rise 7% and make up more than half of all summer vacation 
travel. 
</P>
<P>
Overall travel prices were up 4.5% during the first quarter of this year 
compared with last year, according to the data center. Transportation and 
lodging costs were up 4.1%, food and beverage costs up 4.6% and entertainment 
up 5.6%.

DEATH OF ART MUSIC

Regarding Donna Perlmutter's pointed commentaries about Jorge Mester's 
rendering of Todd Levin's "Turn extended dance mix" (May 16): 
</P>
<P>
It is not only sad that the Pasadena Symphony employs resources, time and 
programming space to such fifth-rate junk while bypassing an enormous amount of 
important contemporary music works, it is also alarming to see that vulgarity, 
mediocrity and trendy rubbish have now been enthroned and sanctified in stately 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Will this be another beginning of the last chapter in the death of art music in 
Los Angeles? One is amazed as to how eager many seem to be to add to the 
consuming fire, misnaming taste as elitism and intelligent selectivity as 
decadent haut monde. 
</P>

But what is important today is to applaud Perlmutter for her courage in putting 
things in their proper place.

THE RESISTANCE AT KMEX-TV TO UNIVISION'S 'CUBANIZATION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with interest Victor Valle's May 19 account of the "ethnic" fight at TV 
station KMEX, where Mexican-Americans are resisting "Cubanization" of the huge 
Univision Spanish-language network. 
</P>
<P>
Reluctantly I agree with those who are resisting. It seems amazing that the 
Anglo owners can find only one Mexican-American, Emma Carrasco, to be among 
their eight highest-ranking executives. We must remember that Mexicans and 
Mexican-Americans used to own and run this 500-affiliate network. 
</P>
<P>
One important point that Valle did not touch on was the uneasiness that we 
Mexican-Americans have regarding the Cuban community's pro-Contra and 
anti-communist views. Before CNN took over the Telemundo network news agenda, 
the Cuban outfit supplying this product continuously used to editorialize the 
news when it dealt with the Nicaraguan Sandinistas. It got to be so 
outrageously biased that I just stopped watching.

For Mexican-Americans to gripe about the achievements of Cubans, Central

Hard work, unity and a generosity of spirit are commendable; anything else

COELHO TO RESIGN IN FACE OF PROBE; PARTY IN 'DISARRAY'

<P>
House Democratic Whip Tony Coelho of Merced, facing a preliminary criminal 
investigation by the Justice Department and calls for an Ethics Committee 
inquiry into his financial dealings, has decided to resign from Congress next 
month, a close congressional associate said Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho's decision, coming on the heels of an apparent decision by House Speaker 
Jim Wright (D-Tex.) to give up his post and leave Congress in the face of 
similar ethics problems, stunned colleagues in both parties and threw the 
question of Democratic leadership in the House into confusion. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen our party in such disarray as it is now," said a Democratic 
member who declined to be identified. "This is scary. There's going to be a 
panic." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento) said he was "absolutely stunned" by 
Coelho's decision to quit. "It's a shame," Matsui said. "He's a hard charger. 
He raised more money for the party than Democrats could imagine. Tony was the 
oil that kept the engine moving, from a political perspective." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gingrich Stunned 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who has led the crusade against what he claims is 
pervasive corruption in the Democratic Party, said he was also stunned by the 
news of Coelho's quitting. "But I think the fact that the No. 1 and No. 3 
Democrats apparently will both leave in June says something about 35 years of 
monopoly power," Gingrich said, referring to the fact that Democrats have 
controlled the House of Representatives since 1953-54, the last time the GOP 
had a majority. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento), a friend of Coelho's and a member of the House 
Ethics Committee, said the Merced congressman telephoned him Friday night to 
say he was resigning. Fazio said Coelho apparently acted to spare his party, 
his family and himself the ordeal of a protracted public inquiry into his 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
"He did not want to put himself and the party through that. He's confident he's 
not in any legal trouble," Fazio said, "but he doesn't want to put the party or 
his family through that. He's worked 10 years to create a better party, and he 
didn't want to give the Republicans that kind of target." 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very sad," Fazio said. "I'm going to miss him. He'll leave a vacuum in 
our delegation and in our Caucus in the House." 
</P>
<P>
He said Coelho did not discuss what he intended to do next. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho's problems began several weeks ago when he acknowledged that he bought a 
$100,000 junk bond underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. with the help of 
a $50,000 loan from Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Assn. arranged by its chief, 
Thomas Spiegel -- a loan the congressman failed to disclose as required by law. 
Coelho and Mayor Tom Bradley, also the subject of a preliminary investigation 
by the Justice Department, were later involved in a lobbying effort on behalf 
of Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
One of Coelho's congressional colleagues said the Democratic leader was 
concerned that his financial affairs were being aired more frequently on 
national television news programs and he feared the effect this might have on 
his two teen-age daughters. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho himself was in seclusion late Friday night at his home, a large brick 
house on more than an acre of land in suburban Annandale, Va. The house was 
guarded by two Capitol police officers in plain clothes who threatened to have 
reporters arrested when they tried to contact the congressman. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday evening, Coelho had attended a high school class play in which 
one of his two daughters had taken part. 
</P>
<P>
House Democratic Leader Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) said that Coelho's decision 
came as a "shock and surprise" to him when he learned of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a great loss for the House, and it's a very great disappointment 
to me personally," he said in a telephone interview from Spokane. "Tony's been 
one of the most creative and able persons who has ever been in the leadership 
so he won't be easy to follow." 
</P>
<P>
But Foley said there are Democrats who have already expressed interest in a top 
Democratic post who could handle the assignment. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 2 Democrat in the House and heir-apparent to the Speaker said he would 
return to Washington on Sunday night, a day earlier than scheduled, to consider 
the next step. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho, who sought to have the news of his decision announced exclusively in 
the New York Times, was quoted as saying he would leave Congress on June 15, 
his 47th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
In connection with Coelho's purchase of the junk bond, his lawyer later 
acknowledged that the congressman had taken advantage of a tax break to which 
he was not entitled when he sold the bond at a profit and probably owes the 
Internal Revenue Service at least a few hundred dollars in unreported back 
taxes on the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho, who earned a $6,882 profit on the junk bond transaction in 1986, later 
arranged a meeting for a Columbia lobbyist with a member of the House Banking 
Committee to discuss issues of interest to Spiegel, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho arranged the meeting last March between Rep. Richard H. Lehman 
(D-Sanger) and Norman Brownstein, a Denver attorney and lobbyist who currently 
represents several savings and loan including Columbia, which is heavily 
invested in junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Bauer, Coelho's attorney, said that setting up the Lehman-Brownstein 
meeting was the only act by Coelho in the wake of his junk bond purchase that 
could possibly be construed as a quid pro quo for Spiegel's help in obtaining 
the $100,000 bond. But Bauer dismissed it as insignificant because Coelho 
routinely introduces people to his colleagues in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Common Cause, the citizens lobby that precipitated the current 
ethics probe of Speaker Wright, called on the House Ethics Committee to 
investigate Coelho's junk bond purchase. 
</P>
<P>
The group asked the panel to look into whether the deal violated a House rule 
prohibiting each member from accepting "favors or benefits under circumstances 
which might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the performance 
of his governmental duties." 
</P>
<P>
Spiegel, a close associate of junk bond king Michael Milken, has acknowledged 
assisting Coelho by recommending -- and then helping finance -- the highly 
unusual purchase of the bond, which was underwritten by Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary criminal investigations of both Coelho and Bradley have been 
opened by the Justice Department's public integrity section in Washington in 
connection with their financial dealings with the Drexel firm. 
</P>
<P>
Although details of the investigations are not known, a central question being 
examined is whether Bradley and Coelho, who have acknowledged that they made 
investments through Drexel, illegally received preferential treatment. The 
inquiry also is expected to examine whether investment opportunities may have 
been made available to the two Democratic office-holders with the hope or 
expectation of favored treatment from them in return. 
</P>
<P>
Both have denied doing anything improper. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Bradley called Coelho to help launch a lobbying effort by 
several California political figures on behalf of Drexel. The campaign 
attempted to persuade the Securities and Exchange Commission not to require 
Drexel, as part of a settlement of the agency's civil suit against the firm, to 
move its junk bond operation to New York from Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Bradley could not be reached for comment on the Coelho 
resignation, but one City Council member said it is certain to intensify 
questions about Bradley's dealings with Drexel and officials at Columbia 
Savings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a startling development and very ominous for the mayor," said City 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. "It's a shock." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said: "Obviously something much more serious is going on here. How 
this will affect the mayor, I don't know. But it certainly intensifies the 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously Coelho's and Bradley's lives overlapped here," Yaroslavsky said. 
"There may also be differences. So it may be dangerous to jump to conclusions. 
But it is ominous." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilwoman Gloria Molina said: "Obviously this is very serious. . . . 
These constant revelations are making it much more difficult for the mayor. It 
will create such a cloud that even if, in the end, the conclusion is that there 
is nothing to prosecute, that he didn't use his office for personal gain, it 
will still create a perception" that something was improper.

TRADITIONS UNDER ATTACK; 
</P>
<P>
BIG CHANGES BREWING FOR BRITISH PUBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

LONDON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The threat is to the very fabric of society, the British are warned. The mass 
media are up in arms, members of Parliament in revolt. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is something as vital as politics or religion: that unique British 
institution known as the public house, or pub. 
</P>
<P>
"An Englishman's pub is his castle," the conservative Daily Telegraph 
thundered. "It is one thing for the government to tangle with the bar or the 
doctors, but if it upsets the nation's drinkers, its goose will be well and 
truly cooked." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drastic Changes Urged 
</P>
<P>
The Telegraph referred to a new government study that urges drastic changes in 
the way pubs are owned and operated and, most important, seeks to limit the 
number of pubs owned by a single brewing firm. According to the nation's 
brewers, it could result in chaos, possibly a fatal blow to the pub. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty Conservative Party members of the House of Commons broke ranks and sided 
with the brewers. 
</P>
<P>
Now the government and the brewers have agreed to sit down and talk the whole 
thing over. Whatever the outcome, one thing seems sure: While the pubs are in a 
period of extraordinary change, reports of their demise, to borrow Mark Twain's 
wording, are greatly exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
"People have probably been complaining for hundreds of years that 'pubs today 
aren't what they used to be,' " Alisdair Aird, editor of the Consumer 
Association's 1989 "Good Pub Guide," said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a continuing refrain, really. But while "pubs do change . . . perhaps too 
much can be made of the 'demise of the great British pubs.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Pubs Disappeared 
</P>
<P>
There were pub post-mortems during the redevelopment of British cities in the 
1950s and 1960s, when thousands of drinking establishments in fact disappeared. 
Shifting classifications make exact comparisons difficult, but the number of 
pubs is believed to have increased in the last 20 years, to about 75,000. 
</P>
<P>
But none of this stops Britons from lamenting an earlier lost pub era, in much 
the way a car buff nostalgically recalls his first used car, mechanical 
shortcomings and all. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the English seem to spend more time analyzing their pubs and 
romanticizing over them than drinking in them. 
</P>
<P>
"No other single institution has aroused so much emotion as the English pub," 
according to a promotional article in a London tourist magazine. "In the 
thousand or so years since pubs were introduced in this country, people have 
talked about them, written about them, laughed in them, played in them and 
relied upon them for food, drink and companionship." 
</P>
<P>
The book section at Harrods department store lists 47 titles dealing with pubs, 
and there are at least four regular magazines on the subject. By one count, the 
new government report, an exhaustive study by the Monopolies and Mergers 
Commission, was the 16th major inquiry into pubs and other aspects of Britain's 
drinking habits in the last 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Campaign for Real Ale, which lobbies on behalf of traditional pubs and 
old-fashioned beer made in the basement, has been called "the most successful 
pressure group in Western Europe." 
</P>
<P>
This time it is the brewers who have leaped to the defense of tradition, not so 
much out of patriotism, one suspects, as because the Monopoly Commission's 
recommendations would largely dismantle what the commission described as a 
monopolist, 239-year-old "tied house" system under which the brewers either own 
or indirectly control at least 75% of the country's pubs. 
</P>
<P>
Many drinkers hold those same brewers responsible for "tearing the heart out of 
a national institution" by visiting "a plague of trendy gimmicks" on their pubs 
in the hope of attracting a generation of younger and more affluent urban 
patrons. 
</P>
<P>
The argument is indicative of what the market research organization Mintel 
recently called the greatest period of change in the post-World War II history 
of the pub. 
</P>
<P>
There is evidence that man was brewing ale in the British isles 5,000 years 
ago. The Saxons are credited with the spread of the ale house as a national 
institution. The names of many modern pubs derive from the signs that King 
Richard II made mandatory for all inns in 1393. The Red Lion, from the crest of 
the founder of the Plantagenet dynasty, is still the most common element of the 
pub sign. 
</P>
<P>
Britons have long been known as beer drinkers, and in contrast to their 
American counterparts, who drink most of their beer at home out of cans and 
bottles, they do 80% of their tippling in the pubs out of pint-sized glasses. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the egalitarian sound of its name, the "public house" has been very 
much a part of the British class system. In addition to all the pubs, there are 
more than 34,000 members-only clubs with bar licenses. And some pubs still have 
separate "public bars" for working men and "saloon bars" for the upper crust. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pub and the People," a classic 1943 sociological study, described a 
typical working man's pub of the time: 
</P>
<P>
"The door opens with a brass latch, disclosing a worn and scrubbed wooden 
floor, straight bar counter brown-painted with thick yellow imitation graining 
on the front paneling; at its base is a scattered fringe of sawdust, 
spit-littered and strewn with match-ends and crumpled cigarette packets. Facing 
the bar, a brown-painted wooden bench runs the length of the room." 
</P>
<P>
While Spartan, according to that study, the place had a certain dignity: 
</P>
<P>
"It is the only kind of public building used by large numbers of ordinary 
people where their thoughts and actions are not being in some way arranged for 
them. In other kinds of public buildings they are the audiences, watchers of 
political, religious, dramatic, cinematic, instructional, or athletic 
spectacles. But within the four walls of the pub, once a man has bought or been 
bought his glass of beer, he has entered an environment in which he is 
participator rather than spectator." 
</P>
<P>
This was a man's world, that of a "no-nonsense boozer," as Stephen Cox, a 
spokesman for the Campaign for Real Ale, described it. Patrons played dominoes, 
darts and cribbage. But mostly they just drank and talked. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, said Frank Fletcher, Mintel's research director, that kind of pub -- 
"the pub as a place where you just go and consume alcohol -- really is dead." 
</P>
<P>
Today's pub-goer visits his "local" less frequently, does not stay as long and 
drinks less than his predecessor. Often he is there mainly to meet friends 
before heading off for somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, modern pubs are generally more receptive to groups of people 
they once shunned. Virtually all of them not only welcome women but cater to 
them. Many are even happy to serve coffee and soft drinks for abstainers, 
although, as Pub Guide editor Aird noted, "There are still many publicans -- 
and pub customers -- who reserve for the coffee machine and the teapot the same 
sort of look that the virile young bullock reserves for the vet's knife." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lager Louts, Yobbos' 
</P>
<P>
The Home Office said in a report issued last month that the government should 
encourage the consumption of low-alcohol and non-alcohol drinks in pubs in 
order to counter the problem of "lager louts" and "yobbos," as drunken young 
hooligans are known. 
</P>
<P>
The microwave oven has helped make food an increasingly important part of the 
pub business. This trend was accelerated last fall when licensing laws were 
changed to allow proprietors to stay open all day. 
</P>
<P>
Most pub menus still feature such traditional and sometimes unpalatable "pub 
grub" as steak and kidney pie, or "bangers and mash" (sausages and mashed 
potatoes). But others offer a much greater and more creative variety, and some 
realize so much of their income from food that the government now classifies 
them as restaurants rather than pubs. 
</P>
<P>
Brewers have spent the equivalent of nearly $10 billion in the 1980s to 
modernize -- traditionalists would say trivialize -- their pubs. Hundreds have 
been turned into "theme pubs" -- places like the Bull, Bear &amp; Broker, in a 
new office development in London's financial district. It has a wine bar 
upstairs, serves baguettes and croissants in the downstairs bar and provides 
up-to-the-minute market information on strategically located television 
monitors. 
</P>
<P>
In many city pubs these days one is as likely to find a "Space Invaders" video 
game as a dart board. About 1,500 pubs are said to have installed karaoke 
machines -- "Japanese juke boxes" that provide background music, a microphone 
and a voice enhancer to encourage amateur crooners. One pub manager in Hayes 
runs competitions for the worst singer, and he says his twice-a-week karaoke 
nights have almost tripled business. 
</P>
<P>
Pubs designed for younger people may have neon lights, loud music and a 
resident disc jockey. "The 'birds' (girls) are 'bang-on' in here," a young male 
customer was heard to remark recently at one such New Wave pub in the Midlands. 
"That's why I come here." 
</P>
<P>
His companion boasted, "Every weekend I've pulled a girl in this very place, in 
this very spot, actually." 
</P>
<P>
At the other extreme are pubs making such a strong pitch for family business 
that they feature diaper-changing rooms. One, owned by the giant Whitbread 
brewery, has a playroom with $1,700 worth of Lego building blocks, and another 
has monkey bars outside. 
</P>
<P>
The Mintel survey showed that about half the patrons still describe their ideal 
pub in "pretty conservative, traditional, even romantic" terms -- a small, cozy 
country inn, a Labrador retriever lying by a roaring fire, a genial, outgoing 
host. 
</P>
<P>
On closer inspection, however, the survey shows that most of the 
traditionalists are among the older and less frequent pub patrons. Among 
younger patrons, and those who go to a pub five to seven days a week, the 
desire is for something a bit livelier -- a "fun pub," with loud music, "zany 
characters" and "a good laugh." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'The New and the Smart' 
</P>
<P>
Organizations like the Campaign for Real Ale "prefer the old and traditional to 
the new and the smart," Brewers' Society spokesman Kenneth Dunjohn commented. 
"It's unfortunate, but the majority of our customers want the new and the 
smart." 
</P>
<P>
In today's more affluent, more mobile Britain, more people are apt to travel to 
a pub. According to Aird, "the pub as a neighborhood local is becoming slightly 
less important, while the pub as a place to go on a day out in your car is much 
more important." 
</P>
<P>
For all the talk about the traditional pub being endangered, Aird said, "this 
trend is helping toward the survival of the idiosyncratic local pubs that were 
becoming an endangered species five years ago." Pubs are also increasingly 
expensive, and the Mintel survey found that this is driving a significant 
number of former customers away. 
</P>
<P>
The "Good Pub Guide" accuses the brewers of overcharging for their increasingly 
popular low-alcohol brands and the soft drinks distributed by their 
subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
The Monopolies Commission argued that a few brewers control the retail market 
through their "tied houses" to such an extent that normal competitive forces 
cannot function to reduce prices. It wants brewers, some of whom now own as 
many as 7,000 pubs, limited to no more than 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
For all this turmoil, however, a visit to the pub remains Britain's most 
popular leisure pursuit outside the home. And if the Mintel research is right, 
it will probably remain so. 
</P>
<P>
"As an institution, the pub has a healthy future," Mintel concluded. Even the 
"local," which appears to be under the most pressure, has going for it such an 
extraordinary atmosphere of informality that many customers see it as an 
extension of their home, offering "an alternative to an evening in," as the 
researchers put it, "rather than . . . an evening out."

COELHO ARRANGED MEETING OF COLLEAGUE, S&amp;L LOBBYIST 
</P>

<P>
Assistant House Majority Leader Tony Coelho (D-Merced), who earned a $6,882 
profit in 1986 by purchasing a junk bond with the help of Columbia Savings 
&amp; Loan Chairman Thomas Spiegel, later arranged a meeting for a Columbia 
lobbyist with a member of the House Banking Committee to discuss issues of 
interest to Spiegel. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho arranged the meeting last March between Rep. Richard H. Lehman 
(D-Sanger) and Norman Brownstein, a Denver attorney and lobbyist who now 
represents several savings and loan institutions, including Columbia, which is 
heavily invested in junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Bauer, Coelho's attorney, said setting up the Lehman-Brownstein meeting 
was the only act by Coelho in the wake of his junk bond purchase that could 
possibly be construed as a quid pro quo for Spiegel's help in obtaining the 
$100,000 bond. But Bauer dismissed it as insignificant because Coelho routinely 
introduces people to his colleagues in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Common Cause, the citizens lobby that helped precipitate the current 
ethics investigation of House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.), called on the House 
Ethics Committee to investigate Coelho's junk bond purchase. 
</P>
<P>
The group asked the panel to look into whether the deal violated a House rule 
prohibiting each member from accepting "favors or benefits under circumstances 
which might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the performance 
of his governmental duties." 
</P>
<P>
The junk bond deal also has become the subject of a preliminary Justice 
Department investigation into the financial dealings of Coelho and Los Angeles 
Mayor Tom Bradley with Spiegel and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s junk bond 
department. The bond bought by Coelho was issued through Drexel by BCI Holdings 
Corp., which used the revenue for a buyout of Beatrice Foods. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho staunchly denies that his junk bond deal was improper but he has 
declined to comment either on the Common Cause request or on the meeting he 
arranged for Brownstein. 
</P>
<P>
Brownstein, in a telephone interview, described Coelho as a friend whose help 
he sought when he set out to lobby Lehman on behalf of his clients. "I had a 
conversation with Tony . . . and asked him: 'Would you mind introducing me to 
this congressman?' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lehman, who had been host of a contentious meeting with Columbia executives a 
few months before Brownstein's visit, said he would not have met with the 
Denver attorney if Coelho had not asked him. "When Tony asks me to meet with 
somebody, I meet with them," said Lehman, whose district is next to Coelho's. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Campaign Contributions 
</P>
<P>
He said Brownstein was introduced by Coelho as "a close friend of Gary Hart." 
Brownstein had contributed to Hart's presidential campaigns as well as to 
Coelho's House campaigns and to the Democratic Congressional Campaign 
Committee, which Coelho headed for several years. 
</P>
<P>
Brownstein said he outlined for Lehman the views of Columbia and his other 
clients on legislation now being drafted by Congress to restructure the savings 
and loan industry. Columbia strongly opposes restrictions on investments by 
S&amp;Ls in junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
But the meeting did not go well for Brownstein, Lehman said. Not only is Lehman 
an advocate of restricting S&amp;Ls' junk bond investments, but also the 
congressman was put off by Brownstein's approach. 
</P>
<P>
"He and I didn't get very far," Lehman recalled. "He asked me to open some 
doors to meet some other (Banking Committee) members. 'Disagreeable' would be 
too strong a word, but I kind of brushed him off . . . . My job is not to go 
make appointments for people, so we didn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
Lehman was also annoyed that a California S&amp;L had sent a Denver lawyer 
instead of one of its own executives to talk to him. "I would gladly meet with 
any S&amp;L industry executive," he said, "but when several of them get 
together and send me an attorney, I'm not interested." 
</P>
<P>
According to reports that all lobbyists must file with the House clerk, 
Columbia is one of a group of six savings and loans represented by Brownstein. 
The others are Far West Financial Corp. of Los Angeles; Crossland Savings of 
Brooklyn, N.Y.; San Diego's Imperial Corp. of America; American West of Miami, 
and Pima Savings &amp; Loan Assn. of Tucson. Before this year, Columbia was 
listed as Brownstein's sole savings and loan client. 
</P>
<P>
Like Columbia, Brownstein's other S&amp;L clients are interested in 
discouraging Congress from imposing any restrictions on the diversity of 
investments that they make. Under current law, savings and loans are permitted 
to put up to 40% of their assets in investments unrelated to housing. 
</P>
<P>
Federal law also permits savings and loans to invest up to 11% of their assets 
in high-yield bonds, but Columbia and other California thrifts are permitted to 
buy as much as 15% under state law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Riskier Ventures an Issue 
</P>
<P>
Some members of Congress involved in writing new legislation governing the 
savings and loan industry, including Lehman, have expressed the view that many 
thrifts got into financial trouble in recent years by straying from 
housing-related investments into riskier ventures such as junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem here is not really Columbia," Lehman said. "They may do it well, 
but you have to write the bill for those who do it poorly." 
</P>
<P>
Coelho has acknowledged that he purchased his $100,000 junk bond with the help 
of Spiegel and Columbia. He sold the bond a few months later at a net profit of 
$6,882. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did Columbia lend Coelho half the money to buy the bond, but also 
Spiegel himself purchased the bond on Coelho's behalf when the congressman 
failed to come up with his money on time. Spiegel later sold the bond to Coelho 
for the initial price -- about $3,000 less than the going price of the bond at 
the time Coelho took possession of it -- plus interest. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho has admitted that he failed to report the Columbia loan on his annual 
financial disclosure report as required by House rules. 
</P>
<P>
But he has denied that he violated any other House rules. Specifically, he has 
rejected suggestions that he violated a rule prohibiting members from receiving 
gifts or favors valued in excess of $100 from anyone with direct interest in 
legislation, a category that appears to include Spiegel. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the House Ethics Committee, Common Cause President Fred 
Wertheimer noted that, at the time Spiegel helped Coelho with the bond 
purchase, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board was challenging Spiegel's 
$9-million-a-year compensation package from Columbia. Coelho has said that he 
knew that Spiegel was a highly successful businessman but knew nothing about 
his dispute with the bank board.

NANCY REAGAN WITHDRAWS SUPPORT FOR DRUG FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE and LAURIE BECKLUND, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former First Lady Nancy Reagan on Friday unexpectedly withdrew her support from 
a drug treatment and research center in Lake View Terrace, saying she "respects 
the concerns of the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the proposed Nancy Reagan Center said her decision will kill 
plans to locate the $10-million, 210-bed facility at the former Lake View 
Medical Center in the northeast San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a year, neighbors had fought the proposal, complaining that it 
would damage property values and attract crime and drugs to their streets. They 
held numerous rallies, letter-writing campaigns and petition drives -- while 
Mrs. Reagan helped raise funds for the project at gala affairs featuring 
celebrities and political supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Reagan's announcement was made Friday morning by her spokesman, Mark 
Weinberg, shortly before members of her staff met with representatives of area 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
"She regrets that this situation has upset members of the community," Weinberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Nancy Reagan Center was to be the core of Mrs. Reagan's post-White House 
anti-drug efforts, with room for 150 live-in adolescents, 60 adults, a drug 
counselor training program and a research center. She had planned to have an 
office there. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of the estimated $10 million needed to buy and renovate the 
former hospital buildings was raised at events endorsed by Mrs. Reagan, 
according to Phoenix House Inc., the nonprofit organization planning the 
center. Where the money will go now was unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Weinberg said Mrs. Reagan will continue her "Just Say No" to drugs crusade 
"without missing a beat," but he would not comment on whether it will include a 
similar center located elsewhere. He also would not say whether she will 
continue to work with Phoenix House. 
</P>
<P>
However, Phoenix House representatives said they would look for another 
location in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
"Our understanding is that the Nancy Reagan Center will operate in a site other 
than the Lake View Terrace site," said spokesman Chris Policano. 
</P>
<P>
Those who live near the former hospital were pleased by Mrs. Reagan's 
announcement but puzzled by its timing. 
</P>
<P>
"We made hundreds of phone calls to her, sent her letters and petitions with 
about 1,200 signatures. We picketed her fund-raiser," said Lynne Cooper, 
president of the Lake View Terrace Improvement Assn. "Who knows? Maybe the mail 
finally reached her office." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi, whose district includes Lake View 
Terrace, said the announcement was "a victory for the community and the 
leaders." 
</P>
<P>
"If we had quit protesting a year ago, we never would've heard from Nancy 
Reagan," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Change of Heart 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Reagan's decision seemed to indicate a change of heart since February, 
when The Times asked Weinberg what the former First Lady thought about the 
community opposition. Weinberg said at the time that Mrs. Reagan was "sorry," 
but "she is also aware that everyone agrees we need to be treating our kids, 
but they say, 'Please don't do it in this neighborhood.' " 
</P>
<P>
Lewis Snow, who met with Reagan staff members Friday as vice president of the 
Lake View Terrace Home Owners Assn., said he was "absolutely floored" by the 
sudden pullout. When he was asked to attend the meeting, Snow said, he had 
assumed that Reagan's staff members wanted to quiz him about a homeowner 
protest he had organized for June 4 outside the Reagans' Bel-Air home. 
</P>
<P>
The only explanation he received was that Mrs. Reagan did not want to forge 
ahead without "total community backing," Snow said. But he said he "got the 
feeling she was very upset with the way Phoenix House had handled the program, 
in terms of public relations, because it had polarized the community." 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix House operates 10 centers nationwide, six in New York and four in 
California. All faced some degree of community opposition before they were 
opened, but few continued to be controversial once they were in operation. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Reagan visited a Phoenix House center in New York during former President 
Ronald Reagan's first term in office and chose the site to publicly launch part 
of her anti-drug campaign. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's for the Kids' 
</P>
<P>
City Council candidate Lyle Hall, who is among the few local Phoenix House 
supporters, said he was disappointed that the organization had decided not to 
proceed in Lake View Terrace without Mrs. Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
"I hoped they would go forward with the rehabilitation program, at least, 
because it's for the kids and not necessarily for Nancy Reagan's credit," Hall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The controversial proposal was approved by a city zoning administrator in March 
but his decision was appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals by both Phoenix 
House and neighborhood residents. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Zoning Appeals was scheduled to hear the case on June 27. Each 
side had vowed to appeal any unfavorable decision to the City Council and 
continue into the courts if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents speculated that the loss of Mrs. Reagan's support would have gutted 
fund-raising efforts for the Lake View Terrace site. 
</P>
<P>
"They primarily fed on her name. . . . It's the key to getting financial 
donors," said Fred Taylor, a Pacoima community activist who organized meetings 
to explore alternative sites for the facility. "That's like rain before a 
baseball game. It's a rainy day for Phoenix House." 
</P>
<P>
Fund-raising events included a May, 1988, breakfast for Mrs. Reagan hosted by 
longtime friend Merv Griffin in the garden of his Beverly Hills home. In 
January, the proposed center received the proceeds from a welcome-home dinner 
for the President and Mrs. Reagan at the Beverly Hilton, where a traffic jam of 
limousines transported supporters such as actress Joan Collins to a 
$1,000-a-plate dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the Reagans said those events were intended to raise money for 
Mrs. Reagan's anti-drug efforts, which at that time focused on the Lake View 
Terrace drug treatment center. But one source said it was unclear whether the 
money will stay with Phoenix House now that she has changed her mind about the 
Lake View Terrace site. 
</P>
<P>
Pamela Powell, development director for Phoenix House, said she knew "nothing 
at all" about the center's financial arrangements.

REP. LUKENS GUILTY OF HAVING SEX WITH GIRL, 16

U.S. Rep. Donald E. Lukens (R-Ohio) was convicted Friday of having sex with a 
16-year-old girl whose mother accused the congressman of offering a government 
job to buy her silence. 
</P>
<P>
Hours after the verdict, one Ohio congressman called for Lukens to resign, but 
an aide predicted that he would seek reelection next year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he should do the gentlemanly thing and resign," said Rep. Chalmers P. 
Wylie, the senior Republican among Ohio's congressional delegation. 
</P>
<P>
A jury deliberated for 1 1/2 hours before finding Lukens guilty of contributing 
to the delinquency and unruliness of a minor, stemming from an incident last 
Nov. 6. The misdemeanor carries a maximum sentence of 180 days in jail and a 
$1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Lukens stood still, his hands pressed on the defense table and his mouth 
slightly open, as Franklin County Domestic Relations Judge Ronald Solove read 
the verdict. The judge delayed sentencing pending the completion of a 
presentence investigation. 
</P>
<P>
One of his lawyers, Mark Serrott, said the two-term congressman from Middletown 
would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Lukens, 58, was indicted on Feb. 23, about three weeks after Columbus 
television station WSYX broadcast a secretly recorded videotape that appeared 
to show Lukens offering to find the girl's mother, Anna Coffman, a job. She had 
gone to the station to get help and agreed to the taping. 
</P>
<P>
On the tape, the woman asked Lukens why he was "messing around" with her 
daughter. Lukens replied: "Well, first of all, I didn't really know she was a 
teen-ager." 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of the tape, Lukens said: "Let me go back (to Washington) and 
see what there is part-time and . . . I don't know what, uh, the government 
has, but I can check and find out." 
</P>
<P>
Coffman testified that the offer was to try to buy her silence, while Lukens 
called it an extortion attempt. 
</P>
<P>
A misdemeanor conviction does not automatically trigger an ethics committee 
investigation or bar a member from sitting in Congress. The committee has the 
option of investigating such cases and recommending action such as censure.

4 AUTOS PLUNGE INTO RIVER AS BRIDGE COLLAPSES

A temporary bridge collapsed Friday, plunging as many as four automobiles into 
the swollen Great Miami River, and the people inside were feared dead. A child 
was found dead in a creek flooded by the same heavy rains. 
</P>
<P>
Widespread flooding in southwestern Ohio sent people scurrying to rooftops and 
high ground. One couple and their 10-year-old son were stranded on the roof of 
their house from morning until 5:30 p.m. when rescuers reached them by boat, 
the Butler County Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
In Camden, rescuers used lifelines and boats to lead 30 occupants of a trailer 
park through chest-high water to safety. A total of 200 people were forced from 
their homes in the town of about 1,900 people southwest of Dayton. 
</P>
<P>
Divers recovered the body of 20-month-old Brandon K. Irwin of Springfield in 
Donnels Creek, northeast of Dayton, about 7:30 p.m., the sheriff's department 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Swept Out of Reach 
</P>
<P>
Four hours earlier, authorities received a report that Brandon wandered away 
from his grandmother, fell into the creek from a bridge and was swept out of 
her reach. Sheriff's Lt. Vaughn McKenney said two helicopters helped rescuers 
search for the boy. 
</P>
<P>
Swift currents and the danger of floating debris prevented rescuers from going 
into the river where the bridge collapsed near Miamitown, about seven miles 
east of Cincinnati, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses gave varying accounts of two to four vehicles falling into the river, 
said Bruce Smith, chief of the Colerain Township Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton County Sheriff's Lt. Col. Ramon Hoffbauer, when asked if anyone could 
have survived a plunge into the river said: "I wouldn't think so. 
</P>
<P>
"The current is moving pretty fast. I can't tell you how fast, but the rescue 
crews didn't go into the water at all," Hoffbauer said. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Brayshaw, deputy county engineer, said an engineer at the scene of the 
accident, 15 miles west of here, had wanted to close the bridge. "He must have 
called me just moments before the collapse," Brayshaw said.

IRAN SPEAKER HAS AYATOLLAH'S TRUST; 
</P>
<P>
RAFSANJANI READY TO TAKE MANTLE FROM KHOMEINI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A decade ago, when the brooding Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini swept triumphantly 
into Iran on the heels of the departed Shah, his coterie included a 
hard-working cleric in a white turban, Hashemi Rafsanjani. 
</P>
<P>
It was a tumultuous time. From the ashes of monarchy the ayatollahs, supreme 
religious leaders among the Shiite Muslims, set about building an Islamic state 
under Khomeini's guidance, not without dispute or violence. Amid the struggle, 
Rafsanjani, then as now bearing the lower clerical rank of hojatoleslam, was 
never far from the sleeve of Khomeini, his former teacher. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Uncertain Times 
</P>
<P>
Iran is once again in difficult straits, its economy ruined by the eight-year 
war with Iraq that ended with a forced truce last July. Its pugnacious 
government remains largely isolated by its Muslim neighbors and the West. And 
the aging Khomeini, while still calling the important shots, has been making 
provisions for the succession of power. 
</P>
<P>
An announcement that the 89-year-old ayatollah underwent surgery Tuesday for 
bleeding in his digestive tract underlined the uncertainty of the times. 
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old Rafsanjani, in his third term as Speaker of the Iranian 
Parliament, acting commander of the armed forces and the only declared 
candidate for the August presidential election, is widely regarded as the man 
to watch. 
</P>
<P>
"He has the trust of Khomeini," said Shaul Bakhash, a former Tehran journalist 
now with the Wilson Center in Washington, underscoring Rafsanjani's most 
formidable political attribute. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Bakhash observed in a telephone interview: "He has ability. He's 
managed Parliament very well. He adjusts." 
</P>
<P>
However labeled -- liberals and conservatives or pragmatists and radicals -- 
Iran's politicians seem to be performing in a house of mirrors. Rafsanjani has 
been put down as a pragmatist, a man who has spoken of the need to open up to 
the West in order to bolster his country's attempts at postwar economic 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
But on May 5 he appalled and outraged Western governments by calling on 
Palestinians to kill Americans, Britons and Frenchmen to avenge Palestinian 
dead in the uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza 
Strip. A few days later, he said his remarks had been misinterpreted and that 
he "did not mean to condone the killing of innocent civilians." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the shock waves, many analysts put Rafsanjani's inflammatory words down 
to domestic political maneuvering. No Iranian leader is openly campaigning to 
succeed Khomeini, but nearly all follow his fundamental line on issues about 
which the old man feels strongly. Before Rafsanjani's clarification, the 
Iranian newspaper Islamic Republic said his remarks were "well within the 
framework of the imam's (Khomeini's) firm stance that Israel must be 
eliminated." 
</P>
<P>
Last February, Khomeini set the tone for political debate and what he 
apparently saw as wavering on the spiritual underpinning of the Islamic state 
by seizing on Salman Rushdie's novel "The Satanic Verses," which he labeled 
blasphemous. He demanded the execution of the Indian-born British author as an 
apostate. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, Khomeini moved more directly into the political arena by 
withdrawing the mantle from the Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, his designated 
successor as Iran's supreme leader. He instructed Montazeri, who had been 
critical of the current wave of arrests and executions in Iran, to "clean his 
house" of liberal influences. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a real shift in what Khomeini is willing to tolerate," Iran 
analyst Bakhash noted. He said the old man was disappointed in the Western 
countries' tilt toward Iraq at the end of the war, when Rafsanjani and others 
expected more support for what they considered Iran's just cause. 
</P>
<P>
The Montazeri episode left Iran's future power structure uncertain. The 
remaining senior ayatollahs, those with sufficient prestige to ascend to 
Khomeini's singular position, are too old or "their qualifications are not 
quite right," Bakhash said. A possible option, he said, would be the 
establishment of a council of Islamic leaders to take over the spiritual reins 
of the state. The present constitution provides for such a council, of either 
three or five members. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Maneuvering 
</P>
<P>
On the political side of the power structure, meanwhile, Rafsanjani has 
reportedly sought a constitutional amendment to abolish the post of prime 
minister, currently held by Hussein Moussavi, his longtime rival in Parliament. 
Instead, a more powerful president -- the post Rafsanjani is seeking -- would 
administer government through a group of presidential deputies. 
</P>
<P>
If Rafsanjani is now the second-strongest leader in Iran, he would emerge -- as 
president with centralized powers, and with Khomeini succeeded by a council of 
clerics -- as the country's foremost political personality. 
</P>
<P>
His candidacy has already received the blessing of the incumbent president, Ali 
Khamenei, who is barred by the constitution from seeking a third term. But 
Rafsanjani's bid for extraordinary power is not expected to go unchallenged. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Moussavi and others opposed to his pragmatic tendencies will 
oppose him issue by issue. But neither Moussavi nor Interior Minister Ali Akbar 
Mohtashemi -- nor any other political strongman -- has made a move to seek the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Another possibility could be the succession of the ailing Khomeini's son Ahmad, 
43, the reclusive ayatollah's closest confidant, his ears and voice outside the 
family home. But the old man has imposed a legalistic formula for succession 
and a dynastic appointment would run against the procedures he is setting in 
place. Nevertheless, Ahmad has become a power in his own right and in the 
confusion that will follow the ayatollah's death he will have a circle of 
influential followers. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani's power base would be difficult to challenge. He controls a large 
bloc of votes in Parliament. Over the years in government, he has managed to 
place important allies in important positions (a brother runs the broadcast 
media). He commands the military and the Revolutionary Guards, but his support 
there may be less certain. 
</P>
<P>
But in any political or ideological difficulty, Rafsanjani's well-demonstrated 
agility will serve him, as it did when he survived the implications of his 
direct role in the Iran-Contra affair. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the shape of a future government and ideological questions, political 
tensions revolve largely around the national economy, which is a mess. The 
government concedes a 23% annual inflation rate on basic items, while outside 
analysts say it is many times higher. The price of potatoes, cigarettes and 
cooking oil has gone up sharply, and subsidized rations for the poor have dried 
up. Lines for subsidized commodities begin forming before sunrise. The salaries 
of government workers have been frozen for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
So-called radicals are pushing explosive issues like land reform and 
nationalization of foreign trade. Rafsanjani, who has the support of the 
bazaari, the merchant class, might be more inclined to go slow on economic 
reforms, although he supports change. 
</P>
<P>
At the podium, in command of Parliament, Rafsanjani has a reputation for 
polished control, a conductor with a well-trained orchestra. He likes a joke, 
it is said, and smiles readily, although perhaps not at the nickname his 
critics have given him -- "the beardless one." Among a host of Shiite clerics 
with bushy whiskers, Rafsanjani wears only a thin mustache. 
</P>
<P>
Born in the southeastern province of Kerman, Rafsanjani went to the shrine city 
of Qom at age 16 to study religion. By the late 1950s, he was a student in 
Khomeini's class in Islamic jurisprudence and had developed a flair for 
preaching. 
</P>
<P>
In the struggle against the rule of the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, he was 
jailed a number of times and drafted into the army. "He used to go around 
converting fellow conscripts, most of them from peasant families like himself, 
to the Islamic thought and revolutionary teaching of Khomeini," a contemporary 
told a European reporter last year. 
</P>
<P>
Alarmed, the army sent him back to Qom. There he set up a property firm -- he 
is a rich man today -- which tithed its proceeds to Khomeini's movement. When 
Khomeini went into exile in Iraq and later Paris, Rafsanjani followed. 
</P>
<P>
He remains a loyal acolyte, and still owes his powerful position to the 
ayatollah. But as the Montazeri dismissal proves, the ayatollah can change his 
mind. Ahmad, a gatekeeper for his father, has given Rafsanjani unusual access. 
But Ahmad too has accumulated political power, and other politicians are 
knocking at his door.

<P>
A regional judge Friday sentenced 14 blacks to hang for the 1985 mob killing of 
a black police officer, in a ruling that is likely to stir widespread protest. 
</P>
<P>
The 13 men and one woman appeared calm during the one-hour hearing in the 
heavily guarded courtroom in this remote town in Cape province as Justice Jan 
Basson handed down the sentences. 
</P>
<P>
The 14 are among 25 convicted of killing Lucas Sethwala in the nearby black 
township of Paballelo in November, 1985, at the height of a national black 
uprising against white minority-led rule. 
</P>
<P>
Only four of the 14 were found to have physically contributed to the death of 
Sethwala, who was caught by a mob, hit over the head and then stoned, beaten 
and set on fire. Only one of the four was found to have actually inflicted the 
blows that caused the policeman's death. 
</P>
<P>
But Basson sentenced all 14 to hang, invoking a controversial "common purpose" 
doctrine -- that they were part of a crowd of about 300 that gathered outside 
the victim's house after a protest against rent increases. 
</P>
<P>
Sethwala, who was singled out for being a police officer, fired a gun out the 
window, wounding a small boy. Defense lawyers said this incited the crowd to 
throw stones at the house to force him to come outside. When he tried to flee, 
he was caught and attacked. 
</P>
<P>
But Basson said the killing was politically motivated, part of a conspiracy to 
attack authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"The Upington trial is an outrage that only the apartheid system can produce," 
protested the South African Council of Churches. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing the crowded court, the defendants all professed their innocence. 
Lawyers said the sentences will be appealed. 
</P>
<P>
The trial is reminiscent of the "Sharpeville Six" trial, in which six blacks 
were sentenced to hang for being part of a crowd that killed a black councilman 
in the black township of Sharpeville in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Although there was no evidence that any of the six had actually caused the 
death, South Africa's highest court upheld the sentences and the principle of 
applying "common purpose" judgments in cases of political unrest. But the 
ruling drew worldwide protests, prompting President Pieter W. Botha to commute 
the sentences last year to long prison terms.

Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Friday that the West is witnessing "the 
failure of the Communist ideology and the meltdown of authoritarian regimes." 
</P>
<P>
In a broad-ranging speech after receiving the honorary "freedom" of the City of 
London, Thatcher said there were "great upheavals" in the Soviet Union, 
Hungary, Poland and China. 
</P>
<P>
"We are witnessing what is perhaps the greatest change for many decades: the 
failure of the Communist ideology and the meltdown of authoritarian regimes," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The attractions of democracy and free enterprise are ever more apparent, not 
only for the prosperity they create but because they give life dignity and 
meaning. 
</P>
<P>
"Can anyone now doubt that the tide is turning in the struggle for the hearts 
and minds of people the world over?" 
</P>
<P>
But Thatcher added: "Times of great change are times of great uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
"More than ever we shall need to keep our defenses strong and sure, in case the 
clouds of tyranny should gather and spread once more." 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony in the medieval Guildhall Building, site of civic administration 
in London for 800 years, was to mark Thatcher's 10 years in office. 
</P>
<P>
As an Honorary Freeman of the City, London's financial district, Thatcher 
follows such former prime ministers as David Lloyd George and Winston 
Churchill. The honor bestows a centuries-old right to herd sheep across London 
Bridge.

4 LATIN PRESIDENTS TO PUSH FOR ANDEAN REGION COMMON MARKET 
</P>

<P>
Four South American presidents agreed here Friday to join in a major new effort 
to create a regional common market. 
</P>
<P>
The four presidents were in Cartagena for the 20th anniversary of the Andean 
Pact, an agreement on economic integration that was signed in Cartagena on May 
26, 1969. So far, it has brought little progress toward the goal of a common 
market for Andean countries. 
</P>
<P>
But the presidents -- Virgilio Barco Vargas of Colombia, Rodrigo Borja Cevallos 
of Ecuador, Alan Garcia of Peru and Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela -- 
emphasized that their national economies must be integrated in order to 
develop. 
</P>
<P>
"Andean integration is imperative for guaranteeing peace, security, improved 
living conditions and the full development of our peoples," the presidents 
declared in a joint "manifesto" signed at the end of the summit. The document 
called for a series of measures to lower trade barriers and increase 
cooperation within the Andean group of nations. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate document, the presidents commented on the political crisis in 
Panama, where the results of a presidential election apparently won by the 
opposition were annulled by the regime of military strongman Manuel A. Noriega. 
That development, they said, "not only assaults the sovereign will of 
(Panama's) people but also affects regional stability and security." 
</P>
<P>
Outgoing President Victor Paz Estenssoro of Bolivia, the fifth member of the 
Andean Pact, sent his foreign minister to the meeting. It was the first Andean 
Pact summit meeting at which all the participants represented popularly elected 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
Chile, ruled by Gen. Augusto Pinochet since 1973, was among the founding 
members but withdrew in 1976, after the group adopted rules restricting private 
foreign investment in the nations belonging to the pact. 
</P>
<P>
The petroleum crisis of the 1970s, the international recession of the early 
1980s and the current foreign debt crisis have battered South American 
economies and weakened integration efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The combined foreign debt of the five member countries is about $76 billion, 
and about 40% of their export earnings goes to servicing their debts. As a 
result, money to import goods from one another is severely limited. Since 1980, 
exports by Andean Pact members to other members have declined from $916 million 
to $837 million. 
</P>
<P>
But the presidents also blamed bureaucratic red tape, opposition by some 
private business groups, and a lack of political resolve for the pact's failure 
to abolish trade barriers among its members. 
</P>
<P>
President Garcia of Peru said in a speech at the opening session that business 
groups often fear competition from other member countries, preferring to defend 
"their little fiefdoms in the domestic market." 
</P>
<P>
President Barco of Colombia said at the same session that by joining the 
worldwide trend to create common markets like the European Economic Community, 
the Andean countries will have a better chance of sharing "the dividends of the 
international economy." 
</P>
<P>
"The Andean Group is truly an unfulfilled potential for progress," Barco said, 
and this "imposes on us the responsibility of seeking strategies that will give 
it new life and meaning for the well-being of our peoples." 
</P>
<P>
President Borja of Ecuador said: "We cannot let the Andean Pact die. History 
would not forgive us."

A grand jury refused to indict a mother for manslaughter in her infant's death, 
which was linked to alleged cocaine use during pregnancy, authorities said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had charged Melanie Green, 24, with involuntary manslaughter and 
delivery of a controlled substance to a minor, a charge usually used against 
street-corner drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
A Winnebago County grand jury that met Thursday did not indict her on any 
charge, State's Atty. Paul Logli said. 
</P>
<P>
Green's 2-day-old baby, Bianca, died Feb. 4. Cocaine was found in Bianca's 
system and in her mother's, said Dr. P. John Seward, the county coroner. The 
drug was carried through the placenta to the fetus, reducing Bianca's ability 
to accept oxygen from the mother and resulting in brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
Logli had characterized that process as delivery of a controlled substance. 
</P>
<P>
In a similar case, another mother in this northern Illinois city of 140,000 was 
convicted May 1 of prenatal child abuse for using cocaine throughout her 
pregnancy, including the hours right before she gave birth. That child 
survived.

Teamsters international Vice President Harold Friedman was fined $35,000, given 
four years of probation and stripped of union offices Friday for his federal 
conviction in a union payroll-padding scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Hughes, a local union officer and one-time FBI informant, also lost his 
union office and was sentenced to four years of probation and fined $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. District Judge George White granted a motion allowing the two to 
keep their union offices while their appeals are pending. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman and Hughes were convicted on Jan. 13 for their parts in a scheme, 
allegedly involving the late Teamsters President Jackie Presser, to put on the 
payrolls of two Cleveland locals friends and reputed organized crime members 
who performed no work. 
</P>
<P>
Presser died in July without going on trial. 
</P>
<P>
The guilty verdicts against Friedman, an international vice president, 
president of the Ohio Conference of Teamsters and president of two Cleveland 
locals, and Hughes were handed down after two days of deliberations in U.S. 
District Court. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman was found guilty of two counts of racketeering, one count of 
embezzling union funds and one count of filing false forms with the Labor 
Department. He was acquitted on one other embezzling charge and one charge of 
filing false forms. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes was found guilty of two counts of racketeering and one of embezzling 
union funds. 
</P>
<P>
The government had contended that the men embezzled more than $700,000 from the 
locals, but the jury found them guilty on charges of embezzling $52,300.

Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale said Friday that he will not enter the 
1990 race for a U.S. Senate seat in Minnesota and will not seek elective office 
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe it's time for other candidates to step forward," said Mondale, a 
former senator who was the Democratic Party's presidential nominee in 1984. "It 
was a very difficult choice for us." 
</P>
<P>
Mondale, 61, said he has enjoyed his life out of political office and has seen 
too many colleagues stay in the Senate for too long. He was considering running 
against two-term incumbent Rudy Boschwitz, a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm at peace with myself," Mondale said. "We took a lot of time making this 
decision, and it's a basic one. It's a lot easier deciding when to get into 
politics as opposed to when to leave." 
</P>
<P>
Mondale said he had decided two days ago, after seeking advice from numerous 
friends and associates, to end his political career.

A federal judge on Friday moved back to July 24 the starting date of the 
Iran-Contra trial of a former CIA agent. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton granted the two-week delay after lawyers for 
Joseph F. Fernandez said the government's case has been tainted with testimony 
given under immunity from prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, the CIA's former station chief in Costa Rica, is accused of covering 
up his ties to Oliver L. North's secret Contra resupply operation. The network 
operated during a congressional ban on military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez is accused of obstructing and making false statements to the CIA's 
inspector general and the presidentially appointed Tower Commission early in 
1987.

LEGISLATURE OKS EXTRA $50 MILLION TO KEEP IMMIGRANT EDUCATION ALIVE

<P>
The Legislature on Friday passed and sent to Gov. George Deukmejian compromise 
legislation providing an extra $50 million to keep immigrant education programs 
operating for the rest of the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly, after a compromise was worked out between Deukmejian and 
Democratic supporters of the bill, passed the legislation on a 61-0 vote. 
Minutes later, the Senate gave final legislative approval, 36 to 0. Deukmejian 
is expected to sign the bill, carried by Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Funding for the special classes, offering English and civics instruction to 
immigrants under the 1986 federal amnesty program, had run dry because of the 
unexpectedly large number of aliens applying for the instruction. 
</P>
<P>
The program is financed by the federal government, but administered by the 
state. Deukmejian originally had budgeted $100 million for the program during 
the current fiscal year, which ends June 30, but those funds already have been 
largely exhausted. The bill calls for the extra $50 million to come from next 
year's proposed allocation of $180 million. Torres said he also will seek more 
money next year. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the legislation said the special schools are crucial because 
immigrants are required to pass a test that demonstrates basic English and 
civics skills or face deportation. Unless the extra money was made available, 
backers of the bill said, many of the aliens granted temporary residence status 
under the amnesty program would have been threatened with deportation. 
</P>
<P>
Some classes around the state have already closed because of the budget 
shortfall. The instruction is offered by a variety of school districts and 
nonprofit agencies. Many offer midnight and early morning classes to those who 
work during the day or into the night. Some schools offer classes in off-beat 
locations, like coin laundries, because demand is so high that there are not 
enough regular classrooms to go around. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the 1.5 million people in California who applied for legalization 
benefits under the amnesty program are required to take the special classes. 
Some can do well enough on their own to pass the tests. But state officials 
said many of those applying for the schooling have such a poor grasp of English 
that they need more hours of instruction than officials had anticipated when 
setting up the program. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials had wanted to put a limit of 100 hours on the amount 
of instruction each person would be allowed, but Torres and other supporters of 
the bill refused to go along with the cap.

LEGISLATORS PROD UC TO EXPAND AIDS PREVENTION RESEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANNY SCOTT, Times Medical Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Social and sexual behavior have been badly neglected in the distribution of 
state money for AIDS research, according to state legislators who on Friday 
urged the University of California to give greater priority to AIDS prevention 
research. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly subcommittee on higher education also suggested that the 
university initiate a survey of the sexual behavior of Californians, in light 
of the paucity of research in the field and the federal government's reluctance 
to support a nationwide survey. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of AIDS research money has gone to the search for treatments 
and a cure -- a goal the subcommittee described as laudable but elusive. 
Members said that work has come at the expense of more short-term research in 
stopping the spread of the the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no cure in sight," said Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), 
releasing the subcommittee's report on the university system and AIDS. " . . . 
The only so-called cure lies in the realm of prevention and behavioral change, 
which can be achieved through education." 
</P>
<P>
According to Hayden, the subcommittee chairman, only 14.3% of the nearly $29 
million that the university has awarded for AIDS research since 1983 has gone 
to behavioral research. More than half of that money went to just four 
researchers, the subcommittee found. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, only $24 million of this year's $1.23 billion federal AIDS 
allocation is going to research on changing high-risk behavior. Administration 
officials have not acted upon scientists' calls for an extensive survey of the 
nation's sexual behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been extremely difficult to obtain federal money for research into 
sexual practices," Dr. Charles Lewis, a UCLA professor of medicine, said Friday 
at a press conference with Hayden. " . . . This is really an emotional and 
social problem." 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee report is the product of a six-month investigation into the 
AIDS epidemic in California and the university's role in combatting it. The 
other recommendations made by Hayden and the subcommittee include the 
following: 
</P>
<P>
* Hospital and physician reimbursement rates under the state's Medi-Cal 
insurance program must be increased to attract private physicians and hospitals 
into AIDS patient care, alleviating a burden that has fallen disproportionately 
on UC hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
* The university should do more to recognize and promote clinical faculty 
active in patient care. If not, the state should "re-evaluate its heavy 
reliance on a research university to provide treatment to AIDS patients." 
</P>
<P>
* The university should recruit and retain black, Asian and Latino researchers 
to study how to change risky behavior in their communities -- a subject the 
subcommittee said has received short shrift from AIDS researchers. 
</P>
<P>
* The university should consider suspending for a year any of the recently 
imposed limits on the number of AIDS patients in its hospitals, "to protect the 
right of AIDS patients to treatment until the rest of California's health care 
system assumes a more proportionate share of the burden." 
</P>
<P>
The University of California has received a total of more than $40 million in 
this decade in state money for AIDS services, and currently receives nearly $10 
million a year. It has also received even larger sums from the federal National 
Institutes of Health in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The five university hospitals constitute the state's largest providers of care 
for AIDS and AIDS-related diseases, serving nearly one third of the state's 
AIDS patients. They also train many of the health-care providers who will work 
with AIDS patients in other settings. 
</P>
<P>
From testimony gathered in a series of hearings held throughout the state 
earlier this year, the subcommittee concluded that the university has given low 
priority not only to social and behavioral research but also to attracting 
experts in those fields. 
</P>
<P>
Hayden blamed an "emphasis on the search for a magic bullet" and "the 
stickiness of getting into sexual behavior."

Several "good-sized" dents were detected by federal investigators Friday near a 
gaping crack in a gasoline pipeline that ruptured and showered a poor 
neighborhood here with a fountain of flaming fuel. 
</P>
<P>
National Transportation Safety Board officials also said half a dozen pieces of 
steel from a Southern Pacific freight train that derailed May 12 were found 
buried near the fuel line, but it was unclear whether the fragments had caused 
the dents or perhaps weakened the pipe to the point where it ruptured.

The heavy chunks -- none of which was touching the steel pipe -- include pieces 
of a locomotive and a brake assembly from one of the runaway train's 69 hopper 
cars, acting transportation board Chairman Jim Kolstad said at a press briefing 
amid the charred ruins of a fire that killed three people and injured 31 
Thursday. The piece of steel closest to the fuel line was discovered about 15 
inches away. 
</P>
<P>
One of the dents, which range up to 30 inches long and 4 inches wide, runs 
directly across the elongated gash that allowed thousands of gallons of 
gasoline to spew from the underground line. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was not known what caused the 14-inch fuel pipe to explode while 
under the extreme pressure used to pump gasoline over the steep Cajon Pass 
grade, Kolstad said the new discoveries raise questions about the adequacy of a 
safety inspection conducted by the line's owner, Calnev Pipeline Co., after the 
derailment. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, while Calnev officials said Thursday that they had uncovered a 
block-long stretch of the pipe and checked for damage, they retreated from that 
position Friday, saying they excavated and only conducted "spot checks" at 
50-foot intervals. 
</P>
<P>
"We made two major excavations in areas we felt we might have damage, one where 
a locomotive had rested and another to the north of there," said David Andries, 
manager of operations for Calnev. "We saw absolutely no evidence of damage in 
those areas." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Claypoole, president of Calnev's owner, GATX Terminals Corp., added that 
the company "took all precautions known to us and common in the industry to 
ensure this (fuel fire) would not occur." 
</P>
<P>
The company did not, however, send an X-ray-like device known as a "smart pig" 
into the pipe to check for weaknesses from the inside. Andries said officials 
were planning to take such a look but that it required a specialist and took 
"considerable time to arrange." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the company might consider abandoning or relocating the line 
given the protests by residents and city leaders, Claypoole said, "This 
pipeline is strategic, not just to Las Vegas but also to Air Force bases along 
the way. The product has to move in that direction." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tuesday Hearing 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Friday, Calnev officials agreed in court not to pump any petroleum 
products or other hazardous liquids through the pipeline before Tuesday. On 
that day, a hearing will be held on the city of San Bernardino's bid for a 
permanent injunction enjoining the company from pumping through the community. 
</P>
<P>
"The city has a tremendously steep uphill battle before it, but it's one we 
will fight because the safety of our citizens is at stake," City Atty. James 
Penman said. The fact that the line carries fuel across the state line into Las 
Vegas, making it an interstate commerce link, constitutes the biggest legal 
hurdle, Penman said. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome of Tuesday's hearing is vital, Penman said, because the federal 
Office of Pipeline Safety, a division of the U.S. Department of Transportation, 
could authorize Calnev to resume pumping at any time. 
</P>
<P>
The city will argue that an injunction is proper because harm caused by this 
and any future eruption is irreparable, Penman said. 
</P>
<P>
As authorities prowled amid the blackened carcasses of 15 homes and 18 vehicles 
engulfed by Thursday's inferno, residents grappled with the grief caused by the 
two disasters that have struck their western San Bernardino neighborhood in the 
space of just 13 days. In all, seven people have been killed and 42 injured and 
26 homes have been damaged or destroyed since the runaway train jumped the 
tracks at a bend alongside Duffy Street. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Evacuees to Return 
</P>
<P>
Evacuees from a quarter-mile-square area surrounding the fire were expected to 
be allowed to return home today. But few among the estimated 96 families 
displaced by the blaze seemed eager to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how we can feel safe here again," said George Liti, 54, whose 
9-year-old son, Roy, suffered burns when the blistering fireball sped toward 
his Mesa Street home. "They told us the gas line was no danger, but you can see 
for yourself this place looks like a bomb exploded. None of us can ever 
forget." 
</P>
<P>
Schools and service organizations were attempting to help shaken families cope 
with their pain. Cajon High School had 16 students from families whose homes 
were affected by the fire, five of whom lost their homes entirely. On Thursday 
night, the school's student council established a fund to collect donations for 
victims, Vice Principal George Bohn said. 
</P>
<P>
The school, about 3 miles from the blaze, has seen more than its share of 
disasters in recent years. In 1980, the deadly Panorama brush fire swept 
through nearby neighborhoods, engulfing more than 300 homes. And a killer 
mudslide also wiped out homes occupied by students from the school. 
</P>
<P>
Caswell (Kay) Hayes, a crisis counselor and outreach worker at Cajon High, has 
been assisting students who suffered losses in the most recent tragedies. 
</P>
<P>
"They are all in shock, gripped by fear," Hayes said. "Many were crying and 
trembling yesterday. They couldn't believe this could happen again. Many still 
had not been sleeping because of the train wreck. And then to have this hit 
them. I'm convinced we will see some long-term damage." 
</P>
<P>
Hayes said that follow-up, professional counseling is vital for students 
traumatized by the terrifying episodes but expressed concern that their 
low-income parents would not be able to afford such treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these people are working people and they have just enough money to 
live on," Hayes said. "I hope these kids will get the help they need." 
</P>
<P>
The San Bernardino County coroner's office identified one of the victims as 
Darie Lee Brown, 54, a resident of Duffy Street. Two other bodies are so badly 
burned that neither their sex nor identities have yet been determined. 
</P>
<P>
The transportation board, which is also investigating the train derailment, 
will conduct laboratory tests to determine what sort of force caused the pipe 
to erupt in a geyser and spill more than 12,600 gallons of unleaded gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
"We are removing a (25-foot) section of pipe around the rupture and will be 
sending a section to Washington to be examined by our metallurgical experts," 
said Kolstad, standing in the shadow of homes obliterated by the speeding 
fireball. 
</P>
<P>
Tests using electron microsopes to magnify sections of the pipe will reveal 
whether impact from the train or natural forces such as corrosion caused it to 
rupture. 
</P>
<P>
Of particular interest will be the dents, which officials said are clearly 
visible on the surface of the pipe and are near the crack, which measures about 
30 inches long and is 4 inches across at its widest point. 
</P>
<P>
Also to be studied are the operation of the pipe since pumping resumed May 16 
and the extent of the inspection conducted by Calnev. In addition, 
investigators will examine an "event recorder" from a Southern Pacific freight 
train that passed about five minutes before the eruption, Kolstad said. 
</P>
<P>
To assist victims of the disaster, checks payable to the Duffy Disaster Relief 
Fund may be sent to Cajon High School, financial secretary, 1200 Hill Drive, 
San Bernardino 92407.

When Peter De Laat first heard of the fatal fireball that engulfed a San 
Bernardino street Thursday, his thoughts flashed back to June, 1976, when a 
wall of flames erupted in front of him on Venice Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"Boom, an explosion. The whole block was doused with gasoline," De Laat 
remembered Friday. "Now this. It's almost identical." 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, nine people were killed and a block of businesses were leveled in the 
Culver City-Palms explosion after a gasoline pipeline was punctured by a 
bulldozer. 
</P>
<P>
This week, three people were killed and 10 homes destroyed when a pipeline 
ruptured after a train wreck at the same site two weeks ago. The train 
derailment is being investigated as a possible cause of the gasoline explosion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prevent Recurrence 
</P>
<P>
De Laat, a retired auto mechanic, said he wonders whether anything has been 
done in those 13 years to prevent such a recurrence. 
</P>
<P>
What new rules, he asked, protect those who live near the state's greatest 
concentration of petroleum pipelines -- the 2,000-mile maze of major lines that 
run into and out of the 18 crude oil refineries in Los Angeles County? 
</P>
<P>
State and federal officials charged with ensuring the safety of petroleum 
pipelines say the Venice fire and a pipeline explosion that destroyed nine 
homes in west Long Beach in 1980 have prompted a raft of changes in 
pipeline-safety regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The cities of Los Angeles and Long Beach passed laws requiring annual 
inspections for leaks in most pipelines, and those ordinances have since been 
folded into state and federal laws, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flaws Acknowledged 
</P>
<P>
They acknowledge, however, that serious flaws remain in those regulations. For 
example, state law requires that before excavators begin digging at 
construction sites, they must check with a central utilities clearinghouse to 
find out where pipelines are located in the area. 
</P>
<P>
But builders who ignore the law face no penalty, said Tom Lael, one of five 
engineers in the tiny unit for pipeline safety in the state fire marshal's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no enforcement provision. There is quite a bit of non-compliance," 
Lael said. 
</P>
<P>
Also addressing the problem of excavation damage, which accounts for about 60% 
of pipeline leaks, the U.S. Department of Transportation this summer will begin 
requiring that pipeline operators notify companies whose operations pose a 
danger to pipelines where the lines are located, said Jim Thomas, deputy 
director of pipeline safety for the Transportation Department. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inadequate Rules 
</P>
<P>
Serious problems detecting the corrosion of the oil pipelines, which is the 
second-biggest cause of leaks, have also emerged despite new testing 
requirements, according to state and federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board warned in 1987 that federal rules are 
inadequate to ensure that corrosion protection systems on the steel pipelines 
are working properly. In response, the National Assn. of Corrosion Engineers is 
reviewing the methods being used to evaluate such systems. The association's 
recommendations are expected this year, said Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
One Mobil Oil Corp. pipeline that runs through the San Fernando Valley 
illustrates the failure of tests to detect corrosion, Lael said. Even though 
the line has been found to be secure when tested under federal standards, it 
has leaked at least six times during the last three years. Last September, 
thousands of gallons of gooey, foul-smelling crude oil leaked onto valley 
streets from the line. 
</P>
<P>
Congress has asked federal regulators to soon implement stiffer federal rules 
for corrosion testing, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, one new rule will require operators of all new pipelines to make 
the length of the pipelines accessible to a camera and ultrasound devices that 
will be able to detect erosion of the inner walls of the lines, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another concern on the Mobil Oil line was the lack of pressure-check valves at 
regular intervals. Regulatory agencies have suggested, but do not require, that 
such valves be installed to reduce the amount of oil lost during a break, Lael 
said. But the federal Department of Transportation has concluded that such 
valves would be prohibitively expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Though government's decade-long push toward safer oil pipelines has been only 
partially successful, Lael said, federal and state studies have repeatedly 
found that shipment of oil through pipelines is far safer than the 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Federal figures show that between 1982 and 1985, moving petroleum by pipeline 
was about 50 times safer than moving it by truck and 135 times safer than by 
rail. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Mobil estimates that to substitute trucks for pipelines on its 
troubled San Fernando Valley line, it would take a fleet of more than 600 
tankers making round trips each day to carry crude oil from production fields 
in Kern County to its Torrance refinery.

CITY TO REOPEN BIDS ON NEW PHONE SYSTEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under pressure from the San Diego City Council, the city's data processing 
corporation has agreed to reopen bidding for a lucrative contract to supply a 
new city-government telecommunications system. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Data Processing Corp., a nonprofit corporation given authority by 
the council in 1986 to select a vendor for the $12-million to $18-million 
contract, will accept "best and final" offers from the seven firms competing 
for the pact and will hold oral briefings with all of them. No other companies 
may enter the bidding, however. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation to reopen bids has convinced the San Diego Convention Center 
staff to recommend that the phone contract for the convention center be bid 
separately, to ensure that phone service is available when the new facility 
opens in October, according to a memo to the council Friday from Robert 
Metzger, executive vice president of the data processing corporation. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for the convention center telecommunications contract to be part of 
the citywide contract. The convention center's board will review the situation 
June 8. 
</P>
<P>
The decision Thursday by the data processing corporation's board of directors 
is a blow to Tel Plus Communications, chosen by data processing officials over 
the six other firms based on highly detailed written bids. The data processing 
corporation was prepared to begin negotiations with Tel Plus on details of 
providing 6,300 phones for offices citywide and 800 more for the San Diego 
Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
But on May 16, five council members intervened at the 11th hour, led by 
Councilman Ron Roberts and Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer. They persuaded data 
processing corporation officials to delay the negotiations and further explain 
the process by which the bids were compared. 
</P>
<P>
After a private review of the bid process Tuesday, a discussion that included 
access to the confidential bids and supporting information submitted by all 
seven companies, Roberts said he is even more convinced that oral briefings 
must be held with the firms. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very clear to me, and I think to (data processing officials) at this 
point that there is a flaw in the procedures that they used," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said that data processing committees comparing the seven bids put so 
little emphasis on cost that, "if a company came in and said, 'we will do this 
for you for free,' (the data processing corporation) would not have recommended 
that we select them based on their criteria." 
</P>
<P>
Metzger has said that the written bid process was designed to avoid accusations 
of favoritism to any firm, a posture partly motived by the 1982 Telink scandal, 
in which there were allegations that contractors provided San Diego County 
administrators with cocaine, prostitutes and bribes in an attempt to influence 
the award of a $24.5-million telephone contract. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fair Competition 
</P>
<P>
Several of those accused were ultimately convicted, but 10 others had their 
convictions overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Mattis, district sales manager for Tel Plus, which is owned by Siemens 
Information Systems, said that Roberts' claim "certainly doesn't sound 
realistic" and contended that her company won a fair competition because its 
product and plans were superior. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course I'm disappointed," Mattis said. "It's really aggravating to me that 
the process was over, and now we're opening it up again, for what? Because a 
couple of vendors were unhappy, because they were sore losers. What happens if 
they're unhappy again after this? Will they open it up again?" 
</P>
<P>
Mattis said that Tel Plus so far has not discussed filing a lawsuit over the 
change of procedures. She said that she believes Tel Plus will be chosen again 
after further review. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Maureen O'Connor has so far been the most biggest champion of the 
existing data processing selection system. During a European vacation that 
ended Sunday, O'Connor, through her chief of staff, demanded that the council 
stay out of the selection process. 
</P>
<P>
But Terry Churchill, area vice president for Pacific Bell, which placed second 
in the competition and complained about how it was run, said Friday, "We 
pursued it because we just didn't think the other way was fair. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a good step forward. Let's see what comes out of council." 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the council, the new procedure will cost the city an 
undetermined amount of money by delaying acquisition of the phone system about 
eight weeks. "Temporary arrangements" for telecommunications services to 
Building Inspection department staffers preparing to move into two renovated 
floors of the City Operations Building in August will be required at city 
expense, said Bruce Gorton director of network support for the data processing 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Blue Ribbon Committee' 
</P>
<P>
The plan approved by the data processing corporation's board of directors 
Thursday calls for creation of a "blue ribbon committee of experts in the field 
of telecommunications" to listen to daylong oral presentations from each 
company, and to recommend a final choice. 
</P>
<P>
The five-member panel, to be selected by data processing staffers, would 
include Gorton and four outside experts from private firms, Gorton said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also will examine other concerns raised by council members, 
including whether the new system will be adaptable to the planned relocation of 
City Hall and whether Siemens USA's European parent company violates a city 
council policy by conducting business in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Mattis said that Tel Plus, Siemens Information Systems and Siemens USA do not 
do business in South Africa.

LIFE OF BOY, 13, DEPENDS ON SEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like most 13-year-olds, Joshua Kaplan leads a busy life. He collects baseball 
cards, commands remote-controlled cars, roots for the Padres, smacks a few 
tennis balls and brings Bach to life on the living-room piano. 
</P>
<P>
But, unlike his friends, Joshua works hard at something else -- staying alive. 
</P>
<P>
Joshua suffers from leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm at school all day, I really don't think about it," said Joshua, who 
lives with his family in Leucadia. "But, sometimes when I'm alone, it's like, 
'Wow, how can this be happening to me?' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Remission for Nearly 4 Years 
</P>
<P>
With treatment, the leukemia had been driven into remission for nearly four 
years, raising family and friends' hopes that Joshua was rid of the disease. 
But, in late April, the cancer resurfaced. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Joshua's best hope for survival is a successful bone marrow transplant. 
</P>
<P>
But the chances of finding the right donor are slim: 1 in 15,000. And the 
search for the perfect match is exacerbated because so few people have been 
tested as donors. The National Bone Marrow Donor Registry in St. Paul, Minn. -- 
an organization that maintains a nationwide list of potential donors -- has 
only 34,000 names. 
</P>
<P>
Schools, local hospitals and other organizations from the community are 
rallying to help Joshua, holding fund-raisers and sponsoring blood tests in an 
attempt to add names to the donor list. The strategy: the bigger the 
donor-candidate pool, the greater the chance of making Joshua the lucky 1 in 
15,000. 
</P>
<P>
Since mid-May, the Kaplans have recruited more than 1,500 people to take the 
blood tests. Just as important, supporters have helped raise $75,000 -- 
financial aid is greatly needed because each blood test costs $75. But many, 
many more donors are needed. So the search continues. 
</P>
<P>
On Memorial Day, Scripps Memorial Hospital and Scripps Clinic and Research 
Foundation in La Jolla will administer blood tests. 
</P>
<P>
"People can come by (to the hospital) early before they go out to the beach," 
said Dr. Roy Kaplan, Joshua's father. "It's a simple blood test, nothing more. 
But it could be the first step toward saving my son's life." 
</P>
<P>
Joshua added: "Please come." 
</P>
<P>
Although the family would be grateful if donors could pay for their own tests, 
Kaplan said shortage of funds shouldn't deter people from volunteering. 
</P>
<P>
"We know the cost may be prohibitive, so if you can't pay, that's OK," Kaplan 
said. "We'll raise the money. We just need people to come." 
</P>
<P>
If a match is made, the donor will be contacted and asked to give roughly a 
pint of marrow, the catsup-like substance found within the bone that produces 
the body's blood and immune system, said Tammy Brown, a spokeswoman for 
Life-Savers Foundation. The private, nonprofit organization in Covina was 
established last September to raise public awareness of marrow transplantation 
and recruit potential donors. 
</P>
<P>
"Bone marrow transplant. People hear those words and immediately they think 
it's something terrible. They get afraid, and don't want to help," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Simple and Painless 
</P>
<P>
But, in reality, the process is simple and painless, Brown said. In a procedure 
that takes less than an hour, a hypodermic syringe is used to extract about 5% 
of the donor's marrow. The patient is placed under a light general anesthetic 
</P>
<P>
during the process, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
The donor can return to a normal routine the following day, and the 
individual's body will replenish the lost marrow in 10 to 12 days, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
By trying to help Joshua, donors may save other lives, too. Individuals tested 
will be listed with the national registry, making their names available to the 
9,000 people in the United States who still need marrow transplants and are 
waiting to find the perfect donor. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Joshua continues to receive treatment, fighting an illness the 
Kaplans thought they had licked. 
</P>
<P>
After intensive treatment shortly following his diagnosis in 1985, Joshua's 
leukemia went into remission. The illness rarely forced Joshua to miss school. 
He competed in music festivals, won "all-star" baseball honors for his nifty 
glove work at second base. He could have been cast as the boy next door. 
</P>
<P>
With such good fortune, the Kaplans celebrated Joshua's bar mitzvah in April in 
spirited fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"We were on top of the world," Kaplan said. "We thought we had beaten this 
thing. We weren't just celebrating his bar mitzvah. We were celebrating the end 
of the disease." 
</P>
<P>
Ten days later, the leukemia came back. 
</P>
<P>
The disease plays a cruel game with the Kaplans, lulling them into a false 
sense of hope that it has disappeared, only to resurface again. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been living in this ugly nightmare" Kaplan said. "It's a nightmare that 
you can't erase. It keeps playing over and over again." 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Kaplans want to end the nightmare, and a successful marrow transplant 
is their only hope. And, while the search for a donor continues, Joshua sticks 
to his busy schedule to keep his mind off his illness: school work, piano 
lessons, baseball practice. 
</P>
<P>
But sometimes, even that's not enough. 
</P>
<P>
"I get afraid," Joshua said. "The kids at my school don't have to worry about 
surviving. They get to live every day. It's weird that surviving has to be on 
your mind."

5 ARE FINALISTS TO HEAD NEW USC CAMPUS

<P>
California State University officials on Friday named the five finalists in the 
running to become the founding president of their new university in San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
The list included a psychologist, a physicist and a pianist who resigned as the 
chancellor of a small arts school, effective next month, under pressure from 
students, faculty and fellow administrators. 
</P>
<P>
She is Jane Milley, 48, who had served as an arts adviser to CSU Chancellor W. 
Ann Reynolds in 1983-84 and since 1984 has been chancellor of the 750-student 
North Carolina School of the Arts in Winston-Salem. Her leadership there 
eventually earned the scorn of eight of her nine top administrators, who sent 
her a memo criticizing her management style. 
</P>
<P>
Among complaints were assertions that she had discouraged advice from 
administrators, didn't delegate tasks, had been abrasive to her staff and 
insensitive to the school's supporters, and hadn't demonstrated an 
understanding of the education of young artists. 
</P>
<P>
Milley agreed April 27 to resign effective June 30 after C. D. (Dick) Spangler 
Jr., president of the University of North Carolina system, offered her a paid, 
six-month leave of absence and a three-year-contract as a faculty member in the 
music department. Milley, in the face of still continued protest by faculty and 
staff, told the Associated Press four weeks ago that she wouldn't even return 
as a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to pursue other professional opportunities," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Milley could not be reached Friday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
All Top Administrators 
</P>
<P>
The other four finalists now hold top jobs at public campuses ranging in 
student enrollment from 5,600 to 9,000. None now work within the California 
State University system, although Milley was dean of music at Cal State Long 
Beach before becoming an arts adviser to the CSU system and then leaving that 
job to become head of the North Carolina School of Arts. 
</P>
<P>
The other four finalists come from campuses specializing in the liberal arts, 
general education and teaching preparation. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Milley, the other four finalists, who were not ranked in preference by 
the search committee, are: 
</P>
<P>
* Carol J. Guardo, president of Rhode Island College in Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
* Bill W. Stacy, president of Southeast Missouri State College at Cape 
Girardeau, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
* Paul F. Weller, president of Framingham State College in Massachusetts, 
outside of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
* Victor K. Wong, provost and vice chancellor for academic affairs at the Flint 
campus of the University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
The job originally attracted 180 applicants, a list that was pared to 115 and 
then 15. 
</P>
<P>
Caesar Naples, vice chancellor for faculty and staff relations for the CSU 
system and the staff executive leading the search for the president, said 
earlier this month that the field of candidates was "the largest showing of 
interest we've ever had for any of our presidencies." 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Reynolds previously said: "The president of CSU San Marcos has to be 
a visionary with the intellectual, fiscal and people skills necessary to bring 
those visions to fruition. There aren't many people who can measure up to such 
high expectations, but I'm confident our selection committee will find that one 
perfect woman or man to serve as the founding president." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Reynolds nor Naples could be reached for comment Friday. The 
announcement of the five finalists was made by the CSU's public affairs office. 
</P>
<P>
The search has focused on a review of resumes and daylong interviews of the 
semifinalists by the 13-member search committee. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the five finalists will be further interviewed during the week of June 
5 at the San Marcos campus site, a one-time chicken ranch that is expected to 
open to upper-division students only in the fall of 1992 as the 20th university 
within the California State University system and the first new university in 
the system in 20 years. By the fall of 1995, the campus will open to 
under-division students. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Background Checks 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, CSU officials will conduct background checks of each of the 
finalists at their home campuses. Search committee members to date have acted 
only on the resumes and what they gleaned from the interviews with the 
candidates, and have not yet looked at independent background information on 
the finalists. 
</P>
<P>
The CSU trustees will make their final selection when they meet in Long Beach 
June 13. 
</P>
<P>
E. Nicholas Genovese, a professor of classics at San Diego State University who 
was on the selection committee, said: "I am pleased with the choices, based on 
what I know of them. It's a good slate, and we should be able to find a good 
president from the bunch." 
</P>
<P>
He said the diversity among the candidates "just happened that way. We were 
very interested in individuals and their qualifications, with an understanding 
that people start off in certain disciplines, but if they are good academicians 
they learn about other disciplines along the way. You expect a person who is in 
one end of the spectrum to know the other end, if they are to be president." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nationwide Experience 
</P>
<P>
Guardo, 50, earned her Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Denver and 
was a professor of psychology at Eastern Michigan University from 1966-1968 and 
at the University of Denver from 1968-1973. She was a college dean and 
professor of psychology at Syracuse State University in New York from 1973 to 
1976, when she became dean of liberal arts and a psychology professor at Drake 
University in Des Moines, Iowa. From 1980 to 1985 she was a provost and 
professor of psychology at the University of Hartford in Connecticut, and has 
served as president of Rhode Island College since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Stacy, 50, earned a Ph.D. in speech communication from Southern Illinois 
University, and in 1971 returned to Southeast Missouri State University, where 
he earned his bachelor's degree in education, to serve as a professor of speech 
communication. He stayed on the campus and rose to become dean of the school of 
graduate studies in 1976, becoming president of the university in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Weller, 53, earned a Ph.D. in inorganic chemistry from Cornell University in 
Ithaca, N.Y., and served from 1961-65 as a research chemist with IBM. In later 
years he held professorships in chemistry at the State University of New York 
in Fredonia, becoming chairman of the chemistry department in 1974. From 
1975-79, he was the dean of arts and sciences and a chemistry professor at 
Western Illinois University. From 1979-1985 he was vice president for academic 
affairs at Cal Poly Pomona. He has been president of Framingham State College 
since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Wong earned his Ph.D. in physics at UC Berkeley and held a variety of teaching 
positions in physics at the University of Michigan at its Ann Arbor and 
Dearborn campuses. From 1980 to 1983 he was chairman of the department of 
natural sciences at Dearborn, and from 1983 to 1986 was dean of the college of 
arts, sciences and letters at Dearborn. Since 1986 he has been vice chancellor 
for academic affairs at the University of Michigan's 5,600-student campus at 
Flint. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Controversial Figure 
</P>
<P>
If none of the candidates are famous, clearly the most controversial is Milley, 
who earned her Ph.D. in education administration from Syracuse State University 
after earning a master's degree in music from Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
A pianist, Milley became a music instructor in 1967 at Elmira (N.Y.) College 
and was named director of the arts and science program there in 1974. In 
1976-77 she was the administrative assistant to the dean of the college of arts 
and sciences at Syracuse, then spent three years as a dean in the humanities 
and fine arts division at Sacramento City College. 
</P>
<P>
She was hired at Cal State Long Beach in 1980 as a professor of music and 
associate dean of the school of fine arts, and became the dean of the school in 
1982. Milley transferred to the chancellor's office as arts adviser in 1983, 
and left Long Beach for North Carolina the following year. 
</P>
<P>
When she was hired as chancellor at the School of Arts, she became the first 
noncomposer ever to head the small college. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Vote of No-Confidence 
</P>
<P>
Criticism of her managerial style began almost at once, but it intensified last 
fall with faculty, students and administrators publicly voicing their nearly 
unanimous lack of confidence in her administrative ability. 
</P>
<P>
Student Body President Joshua Mark told reporters last month that Milley was 
"butting into everything where she doesn't belong and undermining the deans." 
</P>
<P>
Even after Milley agreed last month to step down from her chancellorship and to 
become simply a teacher there, complaints continued about her continued 
presence on the campus. 
</P>
<P>
Student musicians set up chairs and music stands in two of Milley's three 
reserved parking spaces on campus where they gave impromptu performances, and 
some students wore T-shirts bearing a red circle and a slash through a likeness 
of the woman. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, four weeks ago, Milley announced that she would not return to the 
campus in the fall, even as a faculty member. 
</P>
<P>
"My decision was made on the basis of what I think is best for the institution 
and best for myself," she told reporters at the time.

LA JOLLA COUNTRY DAY TEACHERS PETITION TO GET UNION RECOGNITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Teachers at La Jolla Country Day School filed a petition Friday with the 
National Labor Relations Board, asking that their association be recognized as 
the bargaining agent in contract talks with the school's management. 
</P>
<P>
A local NLRB official, who asked not to be named, said the petition was filed 
by a group calling itself the Country Day Teachers Assn., which seeks to 
represent teachers, aides, librarians and the school nurse. The school has 
about 75 teachers and has never had a union shop, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A source familiar with the petition said the teachers decided to organize 
partly because of school administrators' treatment of Sharon Rogers after the 
March 10 bombing of her van. However, Barbara Judy, the association's 
spokeswoman and a kindergarten teacher, refused to confirm that or to say when 
the organization drive began. Judy said the petition signatures were gathered 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Caved In to Terrorists? 
</P>
<P>
Rogers, wife of Navy Capt. Will Rogers III, has said that administrators caved 
in to terrorism when they pressured her to resign in exchange for a $140,000 
settlement after the bombing. Rogers had taught at the school 12 years and was 
teaching a fourth-grade class when she resigned April 28. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI is investigating the bombing as a possible terrorist reprisal. Capt. 
Rogers was in command of the guided missile cruiser Vincennes last summer when 
a missile fired by the ship mistakenly downed an Iranian passenger jet in the 
Persian Gulf, killing all 290 people aboard. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Saxon, newly elected president of the school's board of trustees, said he 
does not believe the union bid is related to the school's decision not to renew 
Rogers' teaching contract. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been no indication to me there is any relationship," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Judy refused to publicly discuss Rogers' firing, saying that "we don't like to 
air family disputes." But, she added, "we certainly know that we have 
colleagues who are no longer there for various reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Judy said the teachers' decision to organize is an attempt to play a greater 
role in school affairs that directly effect them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Opening Communication' 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that the faculty, speaking together, can have some input in matters 
that concern them. . . . Some people feel that they are not listened to 
individually. . . . We feel this (union) is a proper forum by which to address 
these concerns. It's a way of opening communication between the board, 
administrators and the faculty," Judy said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Judy, who has been a teacher at the school 15 years, and Saxon said that 
teachers' unions at independent schools are rare. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not often done in independent schools," said Judy. "We cherish our 
parent body and (students) and have very close ties to them. We wouldn't do 
this without thinking it over very carefully. We're all too old to be 
radicals." 
</P>
<P>
Saxon estimated that 90% of the nation's independent schools do not have 
unions. 
</P>
<P>
The NLRB spokesman said the next step is to send a copy of the petition to the 
school to confirm the signatures. The petition has to be signed by at least 30% 
of the eligible membership. The names of those signing and number of signatures 
are not allowed to be made public. 
</P>
<P>
After the signatures are verified, both sides must meet to work out issues 
raised by the petition and agree on an election. Disputes will be decided by 
the NLRB regional director in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Saxon said he had not seen the petition but acknowledged that 
"there's been some request about a possible move to have a bargaining 
representative for the faculty." He said the board has no position now on 
unionization.

15 SAILORS FROM CRUISER VINCENNES DISCIPLINED FOR DRUG OFFENSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifteen sailors assigned to the guided missile cruiser Vincennes, which last 
July mistakenly shot down a civilian Iranian jetliner carrying 292 persons, are 
being disciplined for possession or use of drugs, the Navy has announced. 
</P>
<P>
Insisting that there is "no indication" that any of the sailors netted in the 
investigation were using drugs when the jetliner was shot down, the Navy has 
touted the bust a victory for its "Zero Tolerance" drug program. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy also insists that none of the sailors being punished could have 
influenced the decision to fire at the jetliner. 
</P>
<P>
"None of them were in a decision-making position or involved with the decision" 
to shoot down the Iranian airliner, said Cmdr. David Dillon, a public affairs 
officer for Pacific Fleet Surface Force headquarters in Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Low-Ranking Crewmen 
</P>
<P>
Because none of the sailors being disciplined was above the rank of petty 
officer 2nd class, it would have been impossible for any of them to have 
influenced the decision of Vincennes skipper Will Rogers III to shoot down the 
plane, Dillon said. 
</P>
<P>
Dillon said most of the sailors involved in the drug charges were on board the 
day of the shooting. Several of the 15 crewman who were cited tested positive 
for methamphetamines in April during random drug testing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"From that, other people were found out," Dillon said. "There was also a 
separate Navy Investigative Service investigation going on at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Those sailors being disciplined for possession of drugs were found with LSD, 
Dillon said, adding that NIS officials found LSD in one crewman's pants pocket. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some To Be Discharged 
</P>
<P>
Twelve of the sailors, who face non-judicial punishment, include two petty 
officers 3rd class, three seamen, five seamen apprentices and two seamen 
recruits. Six of those them are being processed for administrative discharge, 
and six have been given warnings. 
</P>
<P>
The three remaining sailors, who are awaiting proceedings that could lead to 
court-martials, include two petty officers 2nd class and one petty officer 3rd 
class. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers is scheduled to be relieved of his command at 10 a.m. today by Capt. 
Robert B. Lynch during a change-of-command ceremony aboard the Vincennes, which 
has a crew of 384 sailors. Rogers' will become commander of the Pacific Fleet 
Tactical Training Group on Point Loma, a shore-based training command.

WEATHER SUITED FOR A HOLIDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those who have felt cooped up on the job since Easter week can look forward to 
a balmy Memorial Day weekend tempered only by night and morning low clouds 
along the coast and hazy sunshine in the afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be kind of cool at the beaches in the mornings with some low 
clouds and fog," said Patricia Cooper, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., 
which provides weather forecasts to The Times. "Otherwise, it's going to be 
great for doing just about anything." 
</P>
<P>
Overall, temperatures will range from the upper 60s at the beaches, to the 
upper 70s and lower 80s in the inland valleys, Cooper said. Mountain areas can 
expect temperatures in the mid-60s to mid-70s through Monday, with locally 
gusty winds of up to 30 m.p.h. that could cause problems for picnickers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hot in Deserts 
</P>
<P>
Deserts will remain hot, with temperatures in the lower deserts ranging from 95 
to 105 degrees. Temperatures in the high desert will hover in the 80s. 
</P>
<P>
"We are anticipating a lot of people coming out to enjoy the beach," said Bob 
Moore, spokesman for the Los Angeles County Department of Beaches and Harbors. 
"But there have been some riptides that could be a danger for swimmers." 
</P>
<P>
Boaters from Point Conception to the Mexican border can expect to encounter 2- 
to 4-foot waves and gusts of up to 28 m.p.h., Cooper said.

PIZZA DELIVERERS NEW FAVORITE OF ROBBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robberies of drivers delivering pizzas have "exploded" recently, local police 
said this week, noting that several have been concentrated in the same 
neighborhood where a 25-year-old cab driver was fatally shot early Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. C. T. Martin of the San Diego Police Department said Bates Street in East 
San Diego has been the focal point in recent months of "a lot of drug and gang 
activity and is getting to be a real problem." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Carroll, an employee of Coast Cab, was shot on Bates Street about 1 
a.m. Monday after being robbed at gunpoint by an assailant who had asked 
Carroll to drive him to a liquor store. Carroll was robbed after the passenger 
was returned to his Bates Street destination and, police said, after he had 
given the bandit his money. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said Thursday that, of the 30 robberies of pizza-delivery drivers in San 
Diego this year, several have been on Bates Street or in the 5800 block of 
University Avenue, a block away. Carroll was shot one block from 58th Street 
and University. 
</P>
<P>
"We had three in that area just last weekend," Martin said. "Lately, they've 
just been exploding. The M.O. is always the same. They take the cash, sometimes 
the pizza and sometimes the vehicle. And, often, they're armed robberies." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Robbed on, Near Bates Street 
</P>
<P>
Martin said two of the pizza-delivery robberies occurred in the 5700 block of 
Bates on Saturday night and one in the 5800 block of University on Friday 
night. On May 17, one happened in the 5700 block of Bates, which is a dead-end 
street two blocks long. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had about five pizza-delivery robberies this month alone," Martin said, 
"and most were in that area or pretty close by. It's getting real rough over 
there. These robberies usually involve less than $30, and the victim is usually 
a young kid trying to make a little spending money, or just trying to put a 
little away." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Schweda, manager of Etna Restaurant and Pizza House in the 4400 block of 
El Cajon Boulevard, said one of his drivers was robbed on Bates last weekend 
and, as a result, Schweda now forbids drivers to deliver pizzas at night to 
East San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"A guy came up behind him with a gun and just took his money," Schweda said. 
"Bates is rough, man. It's a dead-end street, kind of a dark area. It's rough, 
partly because it is a dead-end street. You get in there, and you're just 
trapped." 
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, robberies of pizza-delivery carriers have increased 
across the country, with fatalities resulting in Los Angeles, Philadelphia and 
other cities. Martin said he knew of no such fatalities here but added that 
pizza-delivery robberies are on the rise in San Diego County, "particularly 
along our southeast corridor," and in National City. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been the manager here a month and a half, and in that time, we've had 
three," said Tony Pasquariello, manager of Domino's Pizza on Plaza Boulevard in 
National City. "And, throughout its history, the store has had a lot. It's 
getting to where a guy will kill you for $10 and a lousy pizza." 
</P>
<P>
Mitch Wagner, who manages the Domino's Pizza on El Cajon Boulevard in East San 
Diego, said three drivers for his outlet had been robbed since January. 
</P>
<P>
"We've taken measures to try and stop it," he said. "Any large order, we call 
back, $18 or more. We confirm it with the customer. We're also very selective 
now about where we go." 
</P>
<P>
Wagner said he thinks the worst pizza-delivery area in the county is not Bates 
Street but an apartment complex on Paradise Valley Road in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the edge of Paradise Hills," he said. "All kinds of people with guns. The 
Twilight Zone, Vietnam. A real bad place." 
</P>
<P>
He laughed and said, "Whoever thought pizzas would get to be such a risky 
business?"

<P>
A juror in the Nancy Hoover Hunter fraud trial disclosed Friday in court that 
her rabbi had told her Hunter was guilty. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure came after attorneys for Hunter, 50, asked U. S. District Judge 
Earl B. Gilliam to ask each juror and alternate whether they had read anything 
about the case or had spoken to anyone about it. 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified juror told Gilliam that her rabbi asked her what she had been 
doing lately, and she replied that she was a juror in the Hunter case. 
</P>
<P>
"She's guilty," the rabbi responded, according to the juror. 
</P>
<P>
The juror promised the judge she would not consider the rabbi's opinion, and 
she was allowed to remain on the case. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam turned down a motion by Hunter's lawyers asking that the jury be 
sequestered.

A diesel-powered attack submarine was towed into port in San Diego on Friday

said.

The submarine, the Blueback, was forced to the surface at an undisclosed 
location off the California coast Thursday afternoon when the fire erupted, 
said Lt. Sonja Hedley, the spokeswoman. There were no injuries, and the extent 
of damage was being assessed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was extinguished almost immediately, and the cause was undetermined, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Blueback carries a crew of 65 enlisted men and eight officers and was on a 
training operation when the fire broke out.

GAMBLING ON FOREIGN TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush has used welcome moderation and careful targeting in putting 
together a list of alleged unfair trading practices under the so-called Super 
301 provisions of the new trade law adopted last year. He has, in other words, 
made the best of a law that could, if not used with great care, trigger trade 
wars. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's angry and stubborn response will not help matters, because it once 
again fails to face up to the extensive protectionism, overt and covert, that 
operates in Japanese markets and also fails to recognize that Bush's findings 
under the new law merely set the stage for negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The other two nations cited, India and Brazil, pose delicate problems, for many 
of the protections they have prolonged are similar to those that the United 
States itself used when it was seeking to develop its own industrial base. But 
the citation of those two nations also provides an opportunity for talks that 
can underscore the importance, in the modern world, of unencumbered trade for 
developing as well as fully industrialized nations. In the late 20th Century, 
development is not possible without a vigorous global trade and an open door to 
private investments. Furthermore, the citations could also encourage a more 
constructive response from the two nations in the new round of negotiation on 
the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT). Both India and Brazil have 
obstructed expansion of GATT. 
</P>
<P>
For the United States, the 1988 omnibus trade law also poses a problem because 
of the widespread recognition that the Super 301 provisions almost certainly 
violate GATT rules. Under the American law, the President is required to cite 
nations suspected of unfair trading practices and may impose sanctions if the 
problems are not corrected after 18 months of negotiations. That sort of 
unilateral action runs counter to the establishment of multilateral GATT 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's initial rejection of negotiations is disappointing. The American 
Administration had understood the sensitivity of Japan about making the list, 
but there was no way that Japan could be kept from the list. The imbalance in 
U.S.-Japanese trade accounts for almost half of the staggering U.S. trade 
deficit. Congress has been increasing its demands for action targeted on Japan 
because of the difficulties American exporters have had penetrating the 
Japanese market. The Administration could have drafted a list going beyond the 
supercomputers, satellites and wood products that were cited. The Japanese will 
be well advised to understand that, and to accept Bush's short list as a 
cordial invitation to meaningful talks, a useful opportunity for both nations.

'HOMELESSNESS IN SUBURBIA' AND SHEEN'S OFFER OF A SANCTUARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is to tell Sheen that I support his recent statements regarding the poor 
and the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Although I don't live in Malibu, I would say that if there were a hundred 
Martin Sheens in this part of the world we would really have a much gentler, 
kinder nation. Last October I saw him in the very first ranks of peaceful 
demonstrators to walk across the cattle guard at Mercury, Nev., in an attempt 
to stop nuclear testing. Several hundred men and women from all across the 
United States came to express their desire to stop nuclear testing and to draw 
attention to the enormity of the crime against humanity that nuclear testing 
is. 
</P>
<P>
That Sheen involves himself in such activities and in his other concerns for 
the ill-housed is testimony to the man's concern for the human condition. We 
who are well-fed, well-housed, etc., should take our hats off to him. 
</P>
<P>
How different the world would be if another Hollywood actor had been this 
concerned with the ill-clothed, the ill-fed, the ill-housed in this, the 
richest country in the world.

Nowhere in Tom Pettepiece's first-person account on being homeless ("Homeless 
in Suburbia: A Few Bad Turns, and You're Sleeping in Your Pickup," Editorial 
Page, May 13) does he make mention of looking for work, any kind of work in 
order to survive. Surely with "10 years of higher education," he didn't need 
help in filling out a job application form and he was capable of doing more 
than sponging off his friends and whining. A trip to the local Employment 
Development Department office might have solved all of his problems.

CHINESE STUDENTS PROTEST IN BEIJING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chinese government has fallen victim to student protesting. It is 
commendable that the citizens of this communist country are trying to achieve 
what our forefathers did for us over 200 years ago. The students say that they 
are protesting for "democracy" and "freedom" -- for better living conditions, 
for more dormitory space, for better food. These students are guilty of lacking 
every conceivable notion as to what democracy is. 
</P>
<P>
One student, appearing on the CBS "Evening News" with Dan Rather from Beijing, 
said that she graduated from high school as a chemistry student and then 
subsequently entered Beijing University (one of the best in China). She is 
halfway through with her studies and complained to Rather that the unviersity 
limits her freedom by not allowing her to change majors. She fails to 
understand her government has invested a lot of time and money into her 
education that could have been spent on someone else. It cannot be wasted on 
her changing her mind. In the U.S., everyone is given an opportunity for a 
college education, but not so in China; but for the few elite that do, it is 
free. 
</P>
<P>
The protesting students fail to realize that there is a price to pay for 
democracy and freedom, and it's not just of monetary value. Our country is 
paying that price in the drug problems of every city, especially our nation's 
capital; there is plenty of crime. The students don't even know what democracy 
is, and they are crying for it. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the students in Tian An Men Square are calling for the resignation of 
China's senior leader, Deng Xiaoping. It is ludicrous that they don't remember 
that only a decade ago Deng was able to bring reforms of modernization and 
relaxing of communist pressures against the people. Without such reforms, they 
would not be able to be protesting. 
</P>
<P>
The Education Commission should not stand for the petulance of these students.

CHINESE STUDENTS PROTEST IN BEIJING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During recent weeks, numerous analysts have predicted what will happen in 
China. When 2 million people marched in Beijing, it was predicted that changes 
toward democracy were inevitable. When martial law was declared, it was 
predicted that a dark period would be inevitable. When the 100 military 
officers opposed martial law, it was predicted that the hard-liners would fall. 
When 7 of the 8 army divisions supported Premier Li Peng, it was predicted that 
the hard-liners would take control. 
</P>
<P>
The predictions have not been correct. Why has the U.S. media been so 
inaccurate with their analyses and predictions? In my opinion, the complexity 
of the problem has been overlooked. All of the above predictions were made 
using a common-sense approach. But this is not how it works in China. 
</P>
<P>
I think that the strength of both the moderates and the hard-liners in the 
Chinese government has been greatly exaggerated. When martial law was declared, 
Li Peng and President Yang Shangkun were the only leaders willing to identify 
themselves openly as hard-liners. This week even Li Peng went on Chinese TV 
claiming that he was not responsible for calling in the troops. On the other 
side, (Communist Party general secretary) Zhao Ziyang was the only openly 
moderate along with (chairman of National People's Congress) Wan Li leaning 
towards Zhao without making his position clear. 
</P>
<P>
It appears that most of the people in the government are uncommitted to either 
side. 
</P>
<P>
It also appears that the complexity within the democratic movement has been 
overlooked. Analysts have been trying hard to find out if the goal of this 
movement is to overthrow communism, or to get rid of corruption and bureaucracy 
and make the existing socialism work better. The answer varies depending on 
which students you talk to. I don't think that there is an ultimate goal. 
</P>
<P>
But though these people have very different ultimate goals, their immediate 
goals are the same. This is the force that has united the people from all walks 
of life. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome of this struggle is undecided at the moment and will continue to be 
undecided regardless of which leader appears to be in control. At no time 
should we be overly optimistic, nor overly pessimistic.

We have expended hundreds of millions of dollars and millions of chest-puffing 
phrases resisting and speaking out against communism. We have sacrificed 
thousands of our young men in Vietnam and Korea; we have sold our soul and 
trashed our Constitution to supply the Contras in Nicaragua; we have toppled 
governments all over the globe to support drug-dealing dictators -- all to 
fight communism. Three decades ago, the Hungarian Freedom Fighters were 
brutally crushed by Soviet tanks because the U.S. lacked the guts to stand up 
and be counted in their struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Now millions of Chinese are standing up to their government, waving 
mini-Statues of Liberties and quoting from Jefferson and Lincoln while our 
President cowers behind microphones and makes feeble, wimpish noises, 
cautioning the Chinese students from going too far. 
</P>
<P>
Who does Mr. Bush speak for? Is he speaking for our boys who died in Korea and 
Vietnam? Is he speaking for America? Or is he speaking for Premier Li Peng and 
the Chinese Communist Party?

After reading, and re-reading many times Pettepiece's poignant article I came 
to the realization that most of us are only a few weeks away from joining the 
ranks of the homeless when unexpected adversity strikes. 
</P>
<P>
Bravo to Pettepiece for sharing his experiences. Also, best wishes for success 
in his literary career.

Pettepiece's article really angered me. What was this writer doing for five 
weeks while he waited for the commission check? Did he ever consider working at 
any job, even temporarily, to pay his immediate bills? If he had bothered to 
try, there are literally thousands of jobs available for someone who wants to 
work. This would temporarily give him money to buy at least the basics. 
</P>
<P>
I've been poor before but I have always found temporary jobs to get me through 
lean times. I have absolutely no empathy for Pettepiece. He should try working 
for a living!

SIGNIFICANCE OF CINCO DE MAYO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a graduate student of Chicano history, I felt compelled to write in response 
to Ray Chavira's comment regarding Cinco de Mayo ("Trouble at Cinco de Mayo 
Events Could Doom Future Festivals," by Michael J. Ybarra and George Ramos, 
Metro, May 9). Though I agree with his belief that the holiday has been 
commercialized and thus is a money-making opportunity for many businesses, I do 
not think he understands the true significance of the date. The following is an 
answer to Chavira's question: "What about the real reason for celebrating it?" 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the holiday is not celebrated in Mexico with the enthusiasm it is here 
in the United States; however, the date has been held in high regard in the 
Southwest since 1863, a year after the Battle of Puebla. The reason for this is 
that the Mexican community north of the Rio Bravo (Rio Grande) looked upon the 
victory of the small Mexican Army against the huge French forces as inspiration 
for their own fight against the injustices inflicted upon them by their recent 
American conquerors. 
</P>
<P>
The years from 1848 to 1900 were perhaps the harshest for Chicanos in the 
Southwest. It marked a period when the once-dominant Mexican community lost its 
economic, social and political power. 
</P>
<P>
Though much time has passed and many things have changed, the Mexican community 
in the United States still feels the effects of being a conquered people. This 
is not to say that many have not struggled and continue to labor for social 
equality. With this in mind, the events of May 5th should hold a special place 
in our history and continue to be a cause for celebration.

18 MORE WELLS WILL MONITOR RADIATION IN WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rockwell International and U.S. Department of Energy officials said Friday that 
18 additional ground-water monitoring wells will be installed by the end of the 
year in a portion of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory where nuclear research 
was conducted for nearly 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement follows an Energy Department report that identified areas of 
radioactive and chemical pollution on the site and called for more 
environmental tests. The California Regional Water Quality Board in Los 
Angeles, responding to the report, said additional monitoring wells will be 
required at the site three miles west of Chatsworth and two miles southeast of 
Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The report said more wells are necessary since inadequacies in the lab's 
ground-water monitoring system make it impossible to tell the full extent of 
chemical and radioactive pollution at the 2,668-acre complex. Currently, the 
company monitors 123 on-site wells. 
</P>
<P>
James Werner, a former consultant who worked on the report, is a scientist with 
the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. He said news of 
the additional wells is "encouraging, but meaningless unless they work with the 
regulatory agencies" in placing the wells where they would be most likely to 
detect pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell and Energy Department officials said Friday they intended to work with 
regulatory agencies in locating the new wells. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said Friday in an interview that the additional wells "should put to 
rest any fears" about pollution moving off the site. Steve Lafflam, 
environmental manager of the site, said the 18 wells will cost the Energy 
Department about $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
The lab, operated by Rockwell's Rocketdyne division in a rugged area of the 
Simi Hills, has been on the state Superfund cleanup list for several years 
because of high levels of trichloroethylene, or TCE, a chemical solvent, in 
ground water beneath the complex. Rocketdyne has been treating ground water in 
one part of the property where TCE has been found at levels of up to 11,000 
p.p.b., 2,200 times the amount that would be allowed in drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
The report acknowledged apparently for the first time that some radioactive 
contamination also exists in soil and structures from nuclear operations and 
spills. Energy Department officials said radioactively contaminated soil exists 
in an area known as the sodium burn pit and a sewage leach field where 
radioactive water has been spilled. They said the highest radiation level found 
so far has been 4,900 picocuries per gram of soil, or up to 190 times the 
natural background levels. 
</P>
<P>
Rocketdyne and Energy Department officials said pollution at the site poses no 
immediate threat to nearby residents. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1947 and 1986, nuclear research was conducted on a 290-acre portion of 
the site, part of which was leased by Energy Department. About 12 nuclear 
reactors operated there, including the first plant in the United States to 
provide nuclear-powered electricity to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
No nuclear work currently is being done at the site, although Rocketdyne plans 
to bid on contracts with Energy Department to recycle spent nuclear fuel rods, 
said R.J. Tuttle, manager of radiation and nuclear safety at the site.

SCHOOL RESUMES AMID HUGS, HARD WORDS AND A FEW AUTHENTIC NOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first class held for some schoolchildren Friday was creative writing. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the 1,500 Sepulveda Junior High School pupils who stayed home during 
the nine-day teacher strike were surprised to learn they needed notes from 
their parents to be readmitted to school early Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those who did not have written excuses in their pockets when they 
joined long lines in front of 18 attendance clerks managed to produce 
reasonable facsimiles by the time they reached the head of the queue. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have a note when I got here. But I've got one now," grinned 
ninth-grader Adam Bloom, 14. His excuse, scrawled on notebook paper, read: ". . 
. We didn't want him to get hurt during the conflicts involving the strike." 
</P>
<P>
Eighth-grader Kelly Brooks had a friend write a note for her as she waited in 
line. "I figured since there was a strike they knew why we were absent," said 
Brooks, 14. 
</P>
<P>
Josh Wisotsky, 13, who is a seventh-grader, insisted his excuse was real. 
"Joshua was absent because of personal business," read his note. 
</P>
<P>
When pressed by his friends, Wisotsky quipped: "I wanted it to be so broad that 
I could change its date and use it another time." 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen-year-old Peter Hart said his excuse was real too. "Please excuse 
Peter's absence due to my regard for his safety and in support of the 
teachers," stated the note signed by his mother. 
</P>
<P>
To the relief of many, officials decided not to check the authenticity of the 
583 notes handed in, said Cleone Jay, an assistant principal in charge of 
attendance at the Sepulveda campus. 
</P>
<P>
Not far from the students' lines, about 50 Sepulveda teachers lined up at the 
school's front gate to march onto the campus together when the 7:30 a.m. bell 
rang. 
</P>
<P>
Singing "Solidarity Forever," they piled into the main office to sign in and 
collect nine days worth of mail from their mailboxes. 
</P>
<P>
Returning teachers received hugs, cookies and coffee from school staff members. 
But they glowered at colleagues who had refused to strike with them. 
</P>
<P>
Those who failed to support the walkout will likely be snubbed, said Ron 
Bradshaw, an eighth-grade history teacher. "I guess they'll feel like 
outsiders. A lot of us will shine them on after this." 
</P>
<P>
Similar scenes -- and similar sentiments -- were evident at other San Fernando 
Valley schools. 
</P>
<P>
Students applauded when about 45 teachers marched back to El Camino Real High 
School singing the same song. Returning strikers made the same prediction about 
the 20 El Camino teachers who stayed during the strike. 
</P>
<P>
"We're angry," said math teacher Arthur Kohn, who is the United Teachers-Los 
Angeles union representative at the Woodland Hills campus. "It won't be normal 
for awhile. I think it was very shortsighted of the young teachers who didn't 
support us." 
</P>
<P>
At Saticoy Elementary School in North Hollywood, returning teachers said they 
were as mad at school administrators as they were at strikebreakers. 
</P>
<P>
They complained that Principal Sandra L. McGuern threatened disciplinary action 
against pupils who talked to strikers during the walkout, inspected a teacher's 
car after suggesting he was stealing books, refused to let picketing teachers 
use school restrooms and banned parents who supported the strike from coming on 
campus to check on their children's classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"When a sub hit a picketing teacher with a car and the teacher ended up on the 
hood, our principal called school police and reported that the teacher had 
jumped on the hood, even though she knows that teacher has an artificial hip 
and couldn't have jumped on a hood if she tried," said special education 
teacher Ros Markman, Saticoy's union representative. 
</P>
<P>
McGuern disputed the accusations, explaining that she only followed district 
guidelines in dealing with the strikers and controlling students during the 
walkout. She said she checked on the teacher taking books only after someone 
reported to her that "kids were having to carry heavy things" for him to his 
car. 
</P>
<P>
As for the picket-line incident involving a fourth-grade teacher who has taught 
for 35 years: "I called school police because she was reported by many staff 
people who said she was standing in front of cars," McGuern said. 
</P>
<P>
Striking second-grade teacher Marsha Schneider, who has taught 28 years at 
Saticoy and was welcomed back with children's hugs, admitted that the strike -- 
and its aftereffects -- will be hard on everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"But if everyone walks the extra mile, we'll make it," she said.

PANEL BACKS SPRINKLERS IN NEW BUILDINGS; 
</P>
<P>
BURBANK COUNCIL ASKED TO ENACT RULES FOR APARTMENTS, HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A city advisory board has recommended that the Burbank City Council require 
sprinkler systems in all new apartment buildings and single-family homes, and 
toughen requirements for sprinklers in new commercial developments. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's 3-2 decision by the Burbank Building and Fire Code Appeals Board 
came as a pleasant surprise to city fire officials, who had asked only that 
sprinklers be required in new apartment buildings of more than five units and 
in single-family homes that are difficult for firefighters to reach. 
</P>
<P>
But board members said the importance of protecting lives caused them to go 
beyond that request and require sprinkler systems in all new construction of 
multi- and single-family residences. 
</P>
<P>
The fire code now calls for sprinklers in all apartment buildings of more than 
15 units or more than three stories. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt strongly about the issues of safety, fire and loss of life," board 
member Philip Saleen said Friday. "If it saves one human life, how do you put a 
cost on that?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$4,000 Added Cost 
</P>
<P>
Saleen said the added construction cost to a 2,500-square-foot, single-family 
home would be about $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
The board also approved the Fire Department's request for sprinklers in all new 
commercial developments of more than 1,500 square feet, far below the existing 
10,000-square-foot threshold. Existing commercial sites that expand to 5,000 
square feet or more would have to install sprinkler systems, but retrofitting 
would not otherwise be required. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Gary Canfield said he voted against the proposal because he 
believes that the decision was made too quickly and that small businesses would 
bear the brunt of additional costs. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was a very quick decision on the part of the chairman without 
proper study," he said. "I don't know if it's up to local government to mandate 
residents to have sprinklers in their homes." 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said the cost of installing sprinklers in a new home would range 
from 90 cents to $2 per square foot, depending on the size of the home and 
whether it was part of a tract development or custom-built. Installation costs 
for apartment buildings would be about $2 per square foot, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Afford Additional Costs' 
</P>
<P>
"Apartment buildings are always built by speculators, and they can afford the 
additional costs," board chairman Sidney Giddens said. He also said the 
advantage of sprinklers is that they go off immediately, helping to prevent 
fires from spreading out of control. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Robert Bowne expressed surprise that the board went beyond the 
recommendations of the fire chief, and said he would have to study the issue 
before taking a position. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly it would add to the cost of anything affected," he said. "And there 
may be a legitimate reason for that; it may be appropriate. We need to look at 
what other cities are doing in this area." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council will consider the recommendation in about a month, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The cities of Agoura Hills and San Clemente require sprinklers in all 
residential construction, and the Glendale City Council is considering a 
similar proposal.

SAN DIEGO'S LOOK OF 'TODAY': BABY GOATS, JANE AND BRYANT, AND WILLARD SCOTT ON 
A BIKE

<P>
The scene: a circle of NBC production trailers in the Embarcadero Marina Park, 
next to Seaport Village, with the official "Today" show catamaran anchored 
nearby and a blimp floating overhead. Members of a roller skating troupe in 
black tights limber up. Sandra Bartosh, a financial planner dressed as an 
orangutan -- the Official Media Hostess for the Convention &amp; Visitors 
Bureau -- walks around, acting sort of orangutanish. Two baby Nubian ibex, on 
loan from the San Diego Zoo, nervously stand by the main stage, looking 
confused, apparently wondering why they weren't given any breakfast this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
The "Today" show has come to town. 
</P>
<P>
More important, Willard Scott is here. 
</P>
<P>
The few hundred spectators gathered in the park screamed when the paunchy, 
balding weatherman arrived. He worked the crowd like a master, slapping backs 
and signing autographs. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the best schmoozer I've ever seen," KNSD-TV (Channel 39) General Manager 
Neil Derrough said. 
</P>
<P>
Scott jumped on a miniature bicycle and donned a Coast Guard cap as the adoring 
crowd gathered 'round. Nearby, Mayor Maureen O'Connor, Union-Tribune Publisher 
Helen Copley and Padres owner Joan Kroc shared insights with each other. 
</P>
<P>
The three were guests on the show, taped Thursday afternoon for airing Friday 
morning, along with the ibex, the roller skaters and a few other things the 
show's producers consider unique to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Periodically, "Today" hits the road, bringing the show to the people, giving 
the program a fresh look and making kissy face with the local network 
affiliates. The San Diego stop was the last on a weeklong West Coast tour. 
Channel 39, the local NBC affiliate, had been making a big deal of giving away 
tickets to the broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
"It focuses a lot of attention on the affiliates," Channel 39 Program Director 
Penny Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
Uninterested in the relationship between a major network and its affiliates, 
the crowd was mainly on hand to see Willard. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like ('Today' co-host) Bryant Gumbel," said Anna Martinez of Yuma, 
Ariz., who was ready with video camera in hand an hour and a half before the 
taping was set to begin. "From watching the show, I don't like his attitude. 
Willard seems really down to earth." 
</P>
<P>
The producers acknowledge that a major reason for taking the show on the road 
is to get Scott out among the people. 
</P>
<P>
"I belong out here," Scott said, shortly after signing an autograph for Channel 
39 reporter Susan Farrell's mother. 
</P>
<P>
A few feet away, in a tiny mobile home, show co-host Jane Pauley ate lunch and 
studied her script. She has to do a little extra homework for the road editions 
of the show -- they don't use a TelePrompter on location. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like a field trip," she said. "Like going to Washington, D.C., when 
you're in high school." 
</P>
<P>
That morning, a local radio show had called her hotel room at 6 a.m. She hung 
up on them. At first, she said, she felt guilty about hanging up. But later she 
decided she didn't care. 
</P>
<P>
She glanced at the script, but didn't seem too worried about it. She was more 
interested in a card from a La Jolla man who claimed to be a distant relative. 
</P>
<P>
"The show is less dependent on my performance on the road," she said. "Most 
important is Willard. He's at least 50% of the show. Nobody works a crowd like 
Willard." 
</P>
<P>
Just a few minutes before the taping was set to begin, the production crew 
members, who were on the site at 5:30 a.m. -- a relatively late start for them 
-- were lounging around, looking rather disinterested. Except for a few sagging 
stages, which might cause cameras to jiggle, there have been few problems. 
</P>
<P>
The crew's one concern was getting Willard Scott to Sea World in time for his 
first weather report. But they were not extremely worried. This was not Real 
Time. It was on tape. Scott was doing tomorrow's weather today. 
</P>
<P>
"The other day, in San Francisco, he was supposed to get a cable car, and he 
didn't make it," Executive Producer Marty Ryan said. "We just put it in later. 
We go hard, but it's not quite the pressure of a live broadcast." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the audio crew milling about the stage were simply thankful that 
they had solved a pre-production noise problem. During technical rehearsals two 
weeks ago, there was a periodic blast of static from an unknown source. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done concerts, World Series and never seen anything like it," engineer 
Bruce Bodor said. 
</P>
<P>
The noise "hits" were caused by radar from passing Navy ships, it turned out. 
That solved, many of the 50 crew members were talking about where to party in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes before taping was to begin, Gumbel emerged from his trailer. He 
waved at a few fans, deflected attempts at conversation with a short "After 
work," and quickly made his way to one of several areas roped off for the 
taping. The San Diego Symphony was setting up a few feet away. 
</P>
<P>
The main stage had two small sets -- one for two people to sit, the other for 
four people -- with the bay and gleaming Marriott hotel in the background. A 
row of lights and cameras almost obscured the program's stars from the 
audience, who were left to view the taping on monitors set up around the area. 
</P>
<P>
Gumbel and Pauley took their positions to a round of applause. It was 1 p.m. on 
a sunny Thursday afternoon, but it was 7 a.m. on Friday as far as the 
production staff was concerned. 
</P>
<P>
Gumbel was cued to open the show. 
</P>
<P>
"We're about as far south as we can go," he said.

POET BEGUILES IN A SOMETIMES BUMPY SHOW

"Suppose the worst is true? That would mean the born-agains and the feminists 
are both right." 
</P>
<P>
That's what Holly Hughes says at one point in her 75-minute monologue, "World 
Without End." This funny, piquant and revelatory view of female sexuality and 
of parents trying to do the best they can is based on Hughes' kaleidoscopic 
memories of her own mother. It has its third and final performance at 8 tonight 
as part of Sushi gallery's Neofest. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a short, saucy, off-the-shoulder, deep-red satin cocktail dress, 
Hughes evokes an impression of both a mother, sexually ripe but repressed and 
even psychotic, and of the mother's sexually open, lesbian daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes is a beguiling poet, playing with "words like 15 gold bracelets sliding 
down the arm of a woman dancing in a French nightclub." 
</P>
<P>
"I should have brought a map," she says early on. "Do you mind getting lost?" 
No, we don't. Hughes is a terrific tour guide. Plus, there's Kate Stafford's 
staging and Lori E. Seid's lighting, which add vigorous, sensuous movement and 
color. 
</P>
<P>
Random and occasionally bumpy, the show is a journey through a tumultuous 
childhood. At times it is unclear to whom the character speaks -- the audience, 
an invisible date or perhaps her mother, when she recalls a childhood visit to 
a New Jersey Denny's: 
</P>
<P>
"There we were, hunched over the counter, lost in the smell of fresh Formica." 
What follows is an account of a mother eager to give her children something 
special for science class. But the result is a grisly episode. 
</P>
<P>
Spying a porcupine waddling across the parking lot, mom leaves the restaurant, 
goes to the car trunk, pulls out an ax, and while the other customers gape in 
amazement, hacks the friendly mammal to death and brings back a handful of 
bloody quills for her girls to take to school. 
</P>
<P>
It is a mixed bag of memories that spurred Hughes to begin writing "World 
Without End" after her mother's death. A recurring theme is the absence of a 
father at crucial childhood junctures, with responsibility for child-raising 
falling on the mother's shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes' childhood character asks her mother to "teach me French," a code word 
for sensuality and sexuality, which her mother possesses in abundance. Hughes 
is at her finest when her language turns to senses, feelings and emotions. 
</P>
<P>
Hitting one of her themes -- violence visited on women by men -- she tells of a 
man who strikes his wife so hard "the whole house cried." The woman lay in her 
"tears and blood on the shag carpet," apologizing and picking up an 
also-floored three-bean salad, bean by bean. 
</P>
<P>
An unstated possibility of incest is raised as the mother uses her own body to 
give the daughter a hands-on explanation of where babies come from. But Hughes 
seems more concerned for a society that has repressed women in their 
expressions of basic sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Hughes turns around the image of a sinful loss of innocence in the 
Garden of Eden. Life is not that simple, she says. Although the father in this 
piece is often away, he is there at his wife's death. When this aging couple, 
one at death's door, kiss, it is not a sweet peck but lusty and filled with 
life. 
</P>
<P>
In Hughes' landscape, the fruit of the forbidden Tree of Knowledge is not the 
downfall of men and women, but rather an apple, deep-red, ripe and juicy, grown 
to be eaten and savored. 
</P>
<P>
A New York playwright, Holly Hughes has written "The Lady Dick," "The Well of 
Horniness" and "Dress Suites to Hire," for which she received an Obie Award. 
</P>
<P>
"WORLD WITHOUT END" 
</P>
<P>
By Holly Hughes, presented as part of Sushi's Neofest festival of new arts. 
Directed by Kate Stafford. Original music by Sharon Jane Smith and Vincent 
Girot. Lighting, Lori E. Seid. Art direction, Christine Vlasak. Dramaturgy, 
Karen Crumley. With Holly Hughes. The final performance is at 8 tonight at 852 
E St., San Diego.

LAKERS TAKE TOUGHEST ROAD TO WIN, 110-107;

L.A. HOLDS OFF SUNS TO GRAB A 3-0 LEAD

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
That 29-point comeback victory in Seattle two weeks ago was memorable, no 
question. But to the Lakers, this win was their most challenging and most 
difficult to acquire, particularly because of the venue. 
</P>
<P>
Returning to the scene of three lopsided regular-season losses for Game 3 of 
the Western Conference finals Friday night, the Lakers fended off repeated 
Phoenix Suns' comebacks to win, 110-107, and take a three-games-to-none lead in 
the best-of-seven series. 
</P>
<P>
Winners of all 10 of their playoff games and only one victory away from a 
return to the National Basketball Assn. championship series, the Lakers are 
making it look almost too easy. 
</P>
<P>
So, in case anyone felt compelled to take this victory for granted, Magic 
Johnson reiterated the magnitude of Friday's accomplishment. After all, the 
Lakers had lost three games at Veterans Memorial Coliseum by an average of 18 
points. 
</P>
<P>
"This was definitely the toughest (playoff) win," Johnson said. "That and the 
last Seattle game are the ones I remember. This one was good because we hadn't 
done well here, and they would not give up." 
</P>
<P>
But the Lakers, who keep winning in seemingly every imaginable way, overcame a 
three-point deficit in the final 1:22 to hand the Suns a rare and somewhat 
stunning home-court loss. 
</P>
<P>
They did it with the outside shooting of forward James Worthy, who had 29 
points, the defensive prowess and surprising free-throw accuracy of Mychal 
Thompson and a half-court trap. 
</P>
<P>
It put the Suns on the verge of elimination when the teams meet here again for 
Game 4 Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
And, like the SuperSonics before them, the Suns face the ominous statistic that 
no team in NBA playoff history has rebounded from a 3-0 deficit to win a 
series. 
</P>
<P>
Things didn't look that bad for the Suns when they erased a 10-point Laker lead 
in the final seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Though still shooting poorly, partly because of the Lakers' trapping defense 
that Sun Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons later called a zone, the Suns took a 103-102 
lead when Eddie Johnson sank an off-balanced jump shot and converted the 
accompanying free throw with 1:50 to play. 
</P>
<P>
It was one of the few shots Johnson sank. He made five of 16 attempts, dropping 
his playoff shooting percentage to 29.5%. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, the Lakers called a timeout to plan their two-minute offense, 
which did not immediately kick in. Magic Johnson turned over the ball while 
driving the lane, and Sun forward Armon Gilliam scored after an offensive 
rebound to give the Suns a 105-102 lead with 1:22 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy, rebounding from a poor offensive performance in Game 2, pulled the 
Lakers within one point after making two free throws with 1:04 to play. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers then resumed their trapping defense with vigor. The best shot the 
Suns could get was a Tom Chambers jumper under duress. Worthy grabbed the 
rebound with 45 seconds left and, eight seconds later, Thompson was fouled. 
</P>
<P>
Only a 67% free-throw shooter in the playoffs, Thompson swished both attempts 
to give the Lakers a 106-105 advantage. As impressive as those clutch free 
throws were, they paled compared to Thompson's defensive play that followed. 
</P>
<P>
Rushing the ball upcourt, rookie Sun guard Dan Majerle drove toward the basket. 
He pulled up about 13 feet away for a jump shot. Thompson moved in and lightly 
swatted away the ball. The Lakers retrieved it, Thompson was fouled and he sank 
two more free throws for a 108-105 lead with 22 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to force him to take a shot he didn't want to," Thompson said. 
"I wanted to get in front of him. We are making the defensive plays. That's 
what is going to win it for us." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzsimmons called a timeout after Thompson's free throws, bringing in a lineup 
saturated with three-point specialists. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix eventually got the ball to its best three-point shooter, Eddie Johnson, 
but he passed to Majerle, who let it fly with 15 seconds left, and Orlando 
Woolridge grabbed the rebound away from Kevin Johnson, who promptly fouled 
Woolridge. 
</P>
<P>
Even more erratic a free-throw shooter than Thompson, Woolridge missed both 
attempts, giving the Suns renewed hope. After another timeout to set up a 
three-point shot, Majerle found himself momentarily open beyond the three-point 
line. 
</P>
<P>
But Majerle's attempt bounced wildly off the rim. Michael Cooper ran it down in 
the corner, was fouled with eight seconds to play and made both free throws for 
a 110-105 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Johnson was allowed to drive uncontested to the basket for a layup that 
only cut the Suns' losing margin to three points. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that, if it's close, we'll win it," Magic Johnson said. "We have that 
confidence. We don't get rattled. We just keep working until we get something 
that works." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' offense was erratic. They made only 48.8% of their shots. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy, however, found his shooting touch after failing to make even one jump 
shot in Game 2. On this night, he made 11 of 17 shots and added 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through the fourth quarter, when the Lakers built a 93-83 lead, Worthy 
sank three consecutive perimeter jump shots, the Suns opting to sag in the lane 
and dare Worthy to beat them from long range as Magic Johnson rested on the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
"I missed almost all my perimeter shots in Game 2," Worthy said. "But I just 
decided to keep shooting them. Tom was laying off me, so I really had no 
choice." 
</P>
<P>
But Worthy was not alone in leading the Lakers. Johnson had 20 points, 
including a one-handed three-point basket from just inside mid-court to end the 
first quarter. Johnson also had 11 assists and nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Support also came from Cooper, who had 16 points including four three-point 
baskets. Cooper's two three-point baskets within a two-minute span early in the 
third quarter helped the Lakers erase a 54-50 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
But it was defense that won this one for the Lakers. They limited the Suns to 
45.9% from the field. After making only two of 10 shots in the first quarter, 
Chambers finished with 26 points and eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hornacek scored 19 of his 21 points through the first three quarters, and 
Kevin Johnson had 15 of his 22 points in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"The best move Riley made was putting in the trap in the second half," Johnson 
said. "It got them out of their offense and kept the ball away from Kevin. It 
was a big key." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzsimmons thought so, too. But he also thought it was a blatant zone defense 
that the referees ignored. 
</P>
<P>
"They went into their zone defense in the middle of the third," Fitzsimmons 
said. "Part of the time, it was just a straight zone. The other was a so-called 
trap zone, so they could keep Kevin away from the basketball as much as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
"But we had our chances to win, and we missed a couple of opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
Which is the story of this series, as well as the other nine Laker playoff 
victories. They give teams brief hope, before snatching it away. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope we don't have to get it over like we got it over in Seattle -- 
being down 29 points," Riley quipped. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons was presented with the National Basketball 
Assn. coach of the year trophy in a pregame ceremony. Sun forward Tom Chambers 
made the presentation. "This has been my most enjoyable season, only because of 
Cotton Fitzsimmons," Chambers said. "It's been a great year. It's not over yet. 
This is a team of the future, but we've got a lot left to do this year." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Riley, who has never won a coach of the year award despite guiding the 
Lakers to consecutive league titles, said he felt Fitzsimmons deserved the 
honor. Fitzsimmons was the overwhelming choice in the media voting. "I think 
there were three coaches who really did a job this season -- Cotton, (Golden 
State's Don) Nelson and Chuck (Daly, of the Detroit Pistons)," Riley said. 
"What Cotton did to turn this franchise around is incredible."

PARRISH A MAJOR FORCE IN IMPROVED ANGEL PITCHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The scouting report on the California Angels' pitching staff has changed from 
last season, even though only two of the faces -- Bert Blyleven and Jim Abbott 
-- are new. The Angels aren't so wimpy now. 
</P>
<P>
Yankees pitching coach Billy Connors sees it: "Their overall look is more 
aggressive." And they're not the least bit afraid to use the inside edge of the 
plate, so watch out. Connors said they're throwing more heat, relying less on 
finesse. 
</P>
<P>
And the staff ERA reflects this brazen new approach. It's down from 4.32 last 
season to a league-leading 2.70. 
</P>
<P>
Although the staff is healthier with more experience this season, some people 
point to new Angels catcher Lance Parrish for the coming-right-at-you approach. 
He may not be the reason for the turnaround, but he is one reason. 
</P>
<P>
"I've tried to express to everybody that I'm a very big believer in pitching 
inside," said Parrish, sitting with crossword puzzle in hand at Yankee Stadium. 
"We've been around and around with that. Everybody is starting to see it's a 
vital part of the game. You can't get respect of the hitters unless you throw 
inside." 
</P>
<P>
Manager Doug Rader credits the pitchers themselves for the improvement, but 
appreciates the veteran catcher's approach. "It's always nice to know Lance 
likes that philosophy and that the pitchers adhere to it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
This winter, Parrish, 32, came over from Philadelphia the same way former 
Angels catcher Bob Boone departed California for Kansas City -- through free 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
Angels starter Mike Witt doesn't want any pro-Parrish comments to reflect badly 
on Boone. "Just as a change in scenery is good for a hitter, I think a change 
in catcher has helped this staff," Witt said. "Lance is a little bit more 
aggressive, not only in calling of games, but in his actions. I've had times 
when he's come out and chewed me. He's not afraid to say anything in any 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Parrish is as happy to be with the Angels as they are to have him. His two 
years in the National League after nine with Detroit weren't what he or the 
Phillies intended, and the fans never let him forget it. Billed as the answer 
to their catching prayers, Parrish hit below .250 both seasons with no more 
than 17 homers or 67 RBI either year. "I just ran into all kinds of problems," 
he said. "I was disappointed in the way I performed and the way the team 
performed. I didn't see the situation getting better. Everything was in 
turmoil." 
</P>
<P>
Although he hit a two-run homer off Rich Dotson in the Angels' win Wednesday 
night, Parrish is less worried about his offense (.248, five homers, 19 RBI) 
and more intent on his defense. "I'm more concerned with us winning ballgames. 
My No. 1 priority is to be a leader behind the plate. 
</P>
<P>
"People had a lot of questions about this pitching staff. It's nice to get that 
confident look back in their eyes. This has been an awful lot of fun."

COLANGELO FINDS ANOTHER WAY TO REBUILD SUNS QUICKLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

PHOENIX, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago, a simple curse would have been welcomed -- perhaps something 
like a bad call on a coin flip. The Suns encountered such misfortune in 1969 
when General Manager Jerry Colangelo said "heads" instead of "tails," and later 
had little choice except to say "Neal Walk" instead of "Lew Alcindor" in the 
college draft. 
</P>
<P>
Colangelo later recalled that after the flip, he was "stunned. I got in my car 
and drove around Phoenix for about three hours. After that, I came back to my 
office and said, 'Well, I've got to do it another way."' 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen years later, after the glory days had come and gone, Colangelo and 
the Suns again had to do it another way. This time, however, their task 
required more than mere luck. The 1986-87 season was the darkest in Suns 
history. Catastrophic events became the norm as the Suns were pummeled by 
defeats, drugs, death and disenchanted fans. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1987, Colangelo fired John MacLeod, who had coached the Suns 13 
1/2 seasons. During a six-year stretch that ended in 1983, the Suns had 
averaged 52 victories under MacLeod, who also once led the team to the NBA 
finals. But when they were in the midst of their third consecutive losing 
season, Colangelo decided a change was needed. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1987, James Edwards, Jay Humphries and Grant Gondrezick, who were on 
the Suns roster, and former Suns Garfield Heard and Mike Bratz were indicted on 
felony charges to possess and transfer narcotics. All had been implicated by 
then-Suns guard Walter Davis, who testified against them before a Maricopa 
County grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
And in August, 1987, Nick Vanos, a 24-year-old Suns center, was killed in a 
plane crash in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
"We hit rock bottom," Colangelo said. "We had to start all over again." 
</P>
<P>
The starting-over process took another year. In the 1987-88 season, the Suns 
had a 28-54 record, their worst since 16-66 in 1968-69, their first season as 
an expansion franchise. But after the 1987-88 season ended, the Suns completed 
the demolition and reconstruction of the franchise. Only guard Jeff Hornacek 
remained from the 14-man 1986-87 team. 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't all. Another coach, John Wetzel, also went. Cotton Fitzsimmons, who 
was a coach for five franchises in his 15-year career and whose record was 46 
games under .500, was hired. But only for an unspecified period. Paul Westphal, 
who had played for the Suns for five years, was hired as an assistant and named 
the "coach in waiting." And free-agent forward Tom Chambers, who had developed 
a reputation as a prolific but selfish offensive player, was given a five-year, 
$9-million contract and the designation as team leader. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns, indeed, had done it another way. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a plan," Fitzsimmons said with a straight face. "This thing was by 
design. It wasn't a hodgepodge. It wasn't pin the tail on the donkey. And it 
also wasn't by accident." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzsimmons will admit, however, that he was surprised the plan worked so 
quickly. The Suns became the eighth team in NBA history to improve by more than 
20 games in a season. They had a 55-27 record and finished only two games 
behind the Los Angeles Lakers. They have advanced to the conference finals, 
where they have lost the first two games. But Friday night and Sunday, they 
play Games 3 and 4 before Suns fanatics, who established franchise records for 
attendance: more than 500,000 total for the first time and 18 sellouts. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzsimmons was named Coach of the Year. Eddie Johnson won the Sixth Man Award. 
Kevin Johnson was named the Most Improved Player. Chambers made the All-Star 
team. Two years ago, the Suns were dirty. Now they are brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
"We have surprised a lot of people," Chambers said. 
</P>
<P>
And they have done it in a different way. Usually when a team improves 
dramatically, it is because of one player and usually that player is obtained 
in the draft. When the Celtics drafted Larry Bird in 1979, they improved 32 
games, from 29-53 to 61-21. When the Bucks drafted Alcindor, they improved 29 
games, from 27-55 to 56-26. 
</P>
<P>
But the Suns' 27-game improvement, third best in NBA history, was a combined 
effort, and it was not without luck. Part of the luck, however, was the result 
of hard work. The Suns were lucky that Gary Fitzsimmons had learned so much 
about basketball from his father. It was Gary Fitzsimmons, the Cavs' player 
personnel director who had worked as an assistant coach under Cotton with the 
Kings and Spurs, who drafted Kevin Johnson for the Cavs (Johnson can best be 
described as a younger Isiah Thomas with an afterburner). And it was Gary and 
Cotton who agreed in February, 1988, to do something to help each other, thus 
the huge trade of Johnson, Tyrone Corbin and Mark West for Larry Nance and Mike 
Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns also were lucky that unrestricted free agency occurred at precisely 
the right time. They were able to sign Chambers without giving up any draft 
picks or young players. But the Suns also were bold. They made Chambers an 
offer and gave him 15 minutes to take it or leave it. Chambers preferred to 
sign with Utah, Dallas, Houston or San Antonio. But he was so impressed that 
the Suns wanted him so badly that he signed. 
</P>
<P>
No one knew it at the time, but Chambers completed the rebuilding project.

HE FINALLY GAINS SPOTLIGHT, BUT STAYS IN RACE'S SHADOWS

<P>
Rich Vogler is one of those people who needed only 20 years to become an 
overnight sensation. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to ESPN's new "Thursday Night Thunder" series, thousands of viewers have 
discovered sprint car and midget auto racing -- and Vogler. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll walk into a store somewhere and I'll hear girls mumbling, 'Is that him? 
Isn't that Rich Vogler?' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprising, since little has happened in those types of racing the last 
decade or so that Vogler hasn't had a foot in. He has won the national 
championship five times since 1978, and the 1980 national sprint car title as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
So, obviously, Indy car owners are stumbling over their checkbooks in their 
haste to sign him up, right? 
</P>
<P>
Well, no, they're not, this no longer being 1963. And Vogler, for all of his 
winning, remains a 39-year-old midget-sprint car driver trying to, you should 
excuse the expression, crash the big time. 
</P>
<P>
Vogler will be racing here Sunday in the Indianapolis 500 -- he will be 
starting 33rd, that's last, for the second straight year -- but he also started 
Thursday night, in a sprint car show at Indianapolis Raceway Park, and Friday 
night, in a race for championship dirt-track cars at the Indiana State 
Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
So for Vogler, 500 or no 500, life goes on pretty much as usual. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't mean he lacks a flair for the dramatic. This year, for the 
second straight year, he made the field on the final day of qualifying after 
bumping a former winner. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, in a classic bit of high drama, it was Gordon Johncock who had to 
step aside for Vogler, after he had earlier bumped Vogler's original car. This 
year, Johnny Rutherford, who would have been starting his 25th consecutive race 
here, was victimized by Vogler, who once again was driving a car he hadn't 
intended to drive. 
</P>
<P>
Vogler, a bit of a traditionalist, wishes that Rutherford could be driving here 
Sunday, too, but. . . 
</P>
<P>
"That's just the way life is," Vogler said. "I didn't go out there with the 
idea of knocking J.R. out. I just went out to try to get in." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, nobody has to remind him how unfair racing can sometimes be. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like all my racing career, I've been setting records of all types," 
he said. "Maybe it's written somewhere that I'm supposed to start the most 
times here in the last row. This is three times in my five starts." 
</P>
<P>
But he is starting, and even that's a bit of an upset. When his own car came 
down with a severe attack of enginitis last Sunday, crew chief Mark Bridges put 
him in teammate Kevin Cogan's backup machine, a 1988 March with a Cosworth 
engine, at the last minute and wished him well. 
</P>
<P>
"The job he did was great," Bridges said. "He had virtually no time in the car. 
I told him to go out and get a feel for it, to go easy the first couple of 
(qualifying) laps but he said, 'No, I'm ready.' He wanted to go right out and 
qualify. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that was a bad decision but he did it and he was real calm about it. 
Calm and steady, real relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of race car drivers and then there are guys who drive race 
cars. He's in that category." 
</P>
<P>
Which brings up the question, once more: If Vogler's so good, why isn't he 
driving for one of the big-time teams? 
</P>
<P>
If it were still 1963, he probably would be, for in those days the progression 
for drivers was from midgets to sprint cars to Indy cars. A.J. Foyt, Parnelli 
Jones, Jim Hurtubise, almost everyone drove sprinters and midgets to Indy. 
</P>
<P>
But in the mid-'60s, the rear-engine revolution cast a new light on things. 
Suddenly, previously scorned road racers -- "sporty car drivers" -- were being 
courted, thanks to their experience in rear-engine cars. 
</P>
<P>
And in the late '70s, when Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) replaced the 
United States Auto Club (USAC) as the sanctioning body for all Indy car racing 
except the 500 here, the trend went from oval-track racing to road and street 
racing, another blow to oval-track drivers. 
</P>
<P>
This year, for instance, of the 14 CART-sanctioned events, only five are track 
races. 
</P>
<P>
That means that although an oval-track veteran might come in handy for 
Indianapolis and the few other track races, hiring him for an entire season of 
predominantly road races is not viewed as a prudent business decision. 
</P>
<P>
Vogler, who cut his teeth on oval-track racing, first in three-quarter midgets 
as a youngster, switching to the real thing when he was 19, simply got caught 
in the switches. 
</P>
<P>
"I happened to come around (the Speedway) just about the time the Indy series 
turned," he said. "I was brought up around oval-track racing, midgets. My dad 
had one before I was even born. We never went to a road race of any sort." 
</P>
<P>
None of which means that Vogler wouldn't like a shot at turning right, as well 
as left. 
</P>
<P>
"I got to make a buck and that's what I do when I win a midget race or a sprint 
car race," he said. "But if I could take off a couple of years and just go 
Super V racing, Formula Ford racing or something like that to get the road 
racing experience, (I would)," Vogler said. 
</P>
<P>
But, of course, even that probably wouldn't be enough. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't taken off work to hang around the Indy car races and be at the right 
place at the right time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Indy car series, you do have to go there with a pretty good sponsor and 
that's the way you get the sponsors, be at the right party and have the right 
guy take a liking to you, or the right company, thinking they can use you. 
</P>
<P>
"With me racing 80 times a year, trying to make a buck, I really don't have 
time to do that." 
</P>
<P>
So, most likely, Vogler will go on being a short-track star who nibbles around 
the edges of the big time, driving here and, he hopes, in the 500s at Michigan 
and Pocono. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a goal here he wants to accomplish. Although he has started four 
times here, he has never finished, crashing three times -- 2 1/2 times through 
no fault of his own, he said -- and retiring with mechanical problems the other 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"I know if I finish, I'll be up toward the front," he said. "Last year I was 
running fifth or sixth and I know if I could have finished, I would have been 
up there. 
</P>
<P>
"My expectation is to make it through the first lap -- that's the first thing 
-- and then finish the race." 
</P>
<P>
Then he can pack the family into the motor home and head out for a sprint car 
race. Surely there will be one somewhere on Monday.

MORNING BRIEFING: ESPOSITO, FIRED BY RANGERS, GETS RAKED OVER THE ICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Phil Esposito was voted into hockey Hall of Fame after a fine career with the 
Chicago Blackhawks, Boston Bruins and New York Rangers, but according to Helene 
Elliott of Newsday, he was ill-suited to serve as a general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott had this to say about the Rangers' fired GM: 
</P>
<P>
"Phil Esposito leaves behind a legacy of chaos and bankruptcy in the Rangers' 
organization. . . . He traded away chunks of the club's future in the 43 deals 
he made, and his disastrous pursuit and dismissal of Coach Michel Bergeron was 
only one example of his appalling lack of judgment. Surrounding himself as he 
did with yes-men advisers who owed him their jobs may have boosted his ego, but 
it did nothing to bring the Stanley Cup nearer. 
</P>
<P>
"When Esposito assumed the general manager job in July, 1986, the Rangers were 
coming off a season in which they had shocked the NHL by advancing to the 
playoff semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"Under Esposito's reign, they exited in the first round in 1987, failed to 
qualify for the playoffs in 1988 and a month ago were ushered out of the first 
round by the Pittsburgh Penguins in a four-game sweep that capped a complete 
collapse. His grandstand ploy of firing Bergeron with two games left in the 
regular season didn't save the Rangers' season or, ultimately, his own job. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate he wasn't fired sooner." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia: The record for the highest winning percentage in the National 
Basketball Assn. playoffs is .923. Which team set it, and in what year? 
</P>
<P>
Advice from an ex-coach: Rick Pitino, coach of the New York Knicks, has been 
offered the coaching job at Kentucky and is expected to make an announcement 
early next week. 
</P>
<P>
Al McGuire, former Marquette coach, thinks Pitino should accept the offer even 
though Kentucky was recently put on probation. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be the smartest move he ever made," McGuire said. "He'll have an 
extended honeymoon to settle in and get himself and his family adjusted. He's 
not going to be able to really do anything for three or four years, so he can 
just work on getting his horses (players) in, build the program back up and get 
re-established." 
</P>
<P>
Costas roast-to-roast: Bob Costas, at a roast for NBC football commentator Paul 
Maguire, said: "As you know, Paul is not a svelte guy. Once he was standing on 
a street corner wearing a blue suit and a yellow hat and three people stopped 
to drop off film." 
</P>
<P>
And: "Paul has made a tremendous impact in broadcasting. He is to the 
broadcasting profession what Oprah Winfrey is to pole vaulting." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The Philadelphia 76ers in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Gordie Howe, asked if he ever broke his nose playing hockey: "No, 
but 11 other guys did."

ASTAPHAN LISTS DRUGS TO BEAT TESTS; 
</P>
<P>
BEN JOHNSON'S DOCTOR NAMES MASKING AGENTS HE SAYS CONCEAL STEROIDS 
</P>

The doctor who supervised Ben Johnson's anabolic steroid program named eight 
drugs Friday that he said athletes can take to conceal their use of banned 
substances, including two that, if effective, could significantly increase the 
drug users' advantage over the testers in international sports. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying for the third day before the Canadian government's commission of 
inquiry into drug use by athletes, Jamie Astaphan said athletes who use 
steroids and other performance-enhancing substances are two years ahead of 
doping control laboratories in their knowledge of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
But if two of the substances named by Astaphan indeed do act as masking agents, 
Dr. Robert O. Voy, former chief medical officer for the U.S. Olympic Committee, 
said the athletes might already have won the fight. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to factrel and pergonol, Voy said by telephone from his Las Vegas 
sports-medicine clinic that it would be difficult to develop a test for them 
because they are naturally produced hormones. 
</P>
<P>
"If they've (athletes) gotten that sophisticated, we might be fighting a losing 
battle as far as testing is concerned," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Dr. Donald F. Catlin, executive director of the UCLA laboratory that 
conducts testing for the USOC, did not seem alarmed, expressing doubts about 
the effectiveness of factrel and pergonol as masking agents. To the contrary, 
he said he believes the two substances would be more effective as 
muscle-building agents. 
</P>
<P>
"If they are, in fact, agents that cut down on the excretion of steroids, they 
would present a problem for us," he said by telephone from his Westwood office. 
"But I don't understand the pharmacological rationale of calling them blocking 
agents. From everything I know, they would have the opposite effect. They're 
more like doping agents." 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging there is no test that can detect the two substances, Catlin said: 
"I don't think there's going to be any demand to develop one because there's no 
evidence to support the claim that they work as masking agents. Maybe Dr. 
Astaphan has done some studies." 
</P>
<P>
Astaphan, who has admitted supervising steroid programs for 14 Canadian track 
and field athletes and said he has worked as a consultant to 32 others from at 
least 15 countries, was not asked during his testimony Friday whether he 
experimented with the substances he classified as masking agents. He seemed 
reluctant to even name them until prodded by the inquiry's commissioner, 
Charles L. Dubin. 
</P>
<P>
"I assume you're not interested after your experience in prescribing steroids 
for athletes," Dubin said. 
</P>
<P>
"No," Astaphan said. 
</P>
<P>
"Then you're not giving away any trade secrets," Dubin said. "So let's hear 
it." 
</P>
<P>
After factrel and pergonol, Astaphan named six substances related to 
probenecid, which was placed on the International Olympic Committee's banned 
list in 1987 after it was purported to have been the masking agent of choice 
earlier that year in the Pan American Games at Indianapolis and track and 
field's world championships at Rome. Five of them, Astaphan said, are uricovac, 
urinorm, desuric, azubromin and anturan. 
</P>
<P>
Pausing dramatically before naming the sixth, Astaphan said, "This one is going 
to get me." 
</P>
<P>
He identified it as carinamide. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the golden boy of them all," he said. "That's the name I've given to 
it because: a) it's not detectable; b) it's not banned, and c) it blocks 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
"It's used in Europe for reasons like probenecid, when you're given a 
combination of antibiotics that you want to remain in the system a little bit 
longer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Catlin said he does not believe Astaphan's claims that carinamide is not 
detectable. He also said that it is banned, as are all compounds related to 
probenecid. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an old drug, developed before probenecid years ago," he said. "But it 
never got out to the clinical market in the United States because it had to be 
taken in high doses and didn't last very long." 
</P>
<P>
It is described as a "clandestinely produced" substance in the "Underground 
Steroid Handbook II," the most recent summary of performance-enhancing 
substances compiled by Dan Duchaine of Venice Beach. Duchaine is currently 
serving a prison sentence for charges related to steroid distribution. 
</P>
<P>
According to the handbook, carinamide was the most popular masking agent among 
track and field athletes at the Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"We have never seen a case of it," Catlin said. "I frankly don't know if we 
would have seen it if somebody had taken it. But I don't think it would present 
any serious problems to us as far as not being detectable. I would think we'll 
certainly look into this from the chemistry point of view to be certain we can 
find it. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything he's (Astaphan) said so far is just a variation on an old theme. I 
haven't heard anything that gives me any serious concern. My concern is for all 
the poor athletes taking this stuff."

ORIOLES' VICTORY PUTS THEM BACK IN FIRST PLACE

<P>
The Baltimore Orioles tease left-hander Jeff Ballard about his background, but 
they look forward to his turn to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Ballard, the hottest pitcher in the American League, threw another strong game 
Friday night at Cleveland and put the amazing Orioles back into first place in 
the East. 
</P>
<P>
Ballard held the Indians to seven hits in seven innings as the Orioles defeated 
the Indians, 5-2. The victory put the Orioles over .500 (22-21) and improved 
Ballard's record to 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Sheets drove in two runs with a home run and single, and the Orioles, who 
lost more than 100 games last year, stretched their winning streak to four 
games. 
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Ballard tied his victory total of last season when, as a 
rookie, he was 8-12. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles kiddingly ask Ballard how a youngster who grew up in Billings, 
Mont., where they don't even play high school baseball, and went to college at 
Stanford could be a success in major league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys dog me daily," Ballard laughed. "They say I'm just a country boy from 
the Ivy League of the West." 
</P>
<P>
Ballard, not an overpowering pitcher, just keeps the hitters off balance and 
gets them to hit the ball to his teammates. He is only the third Oriole pitcher 
to win eight of his first nine decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Not only does he have an earned-run average of 2.17, but he usually brings out 
the best in the Orioles' hitters, who have scored five or more runs in seven of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a simple formula," said Ballard, who has only 13 strikeouts in 60 
innings. "I let my teammates do the job on offense and defense." 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 4, New York 0 -- With so much pitching talent, the Athletics have been 
able to bring Todd Burns of Maywood along carefully. 
</P>
<P>
Out of necessity -- an injury to Storm Davis -- they were forced to start the 
25-year-old right-hander in this game at New York. 
</P>
<P>
Burns responded by limiting the Yankees to one hit in 6 2/3 innings. After 82 
pitches, they removed Burns (4-0), and Rick Honeycutt and Eric Plunk combined 
to shut out the Yankees the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
New York's only hit came when Rickey Henderson beat out a slow roller to third 
in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I caught a perfect game by Len Barker when I was with Cleveland," catcher Ron 
Hassey said. "Tonight I could call whatever I wanted and Todd was right there." 
</P>
<P>
Run-scoring doubles by Hassey and Tony Phillips helped Burns improve his 
lifetime record as a starter to 12-2. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 11, Chicago 3 -- Ballard's fast start has taken the limelight from some 
steady pitching by Jimmy Key of the Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
Ernie Whitt hit a three-run homer and a double to lead a 17-hit attack that 
made it easy for Key to improve his record to 6-2 in the game at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Former Dodger Shawn Hillegas (1-6) gave up 10 hits and seven runs in four 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 5, Minnesota 3 -- Rick Leach had three hits, including his first home 
run, and the Rangers overcame a shaky performance by Bobby Witt to win at 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Witt, who had lost four games in a row, made it through 5 2/3 innings to end 
his losing spell. He gave up four hits, but walked four and was in trouble 
continually. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 7, Milwaukee 2 -- Scott Bradley and Ken Griffey Jr. hit home runs at 
Milwaukee to lead the Mariners to an easy victory. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's three-run homer gave Seattle a 5-1 lead in the second inning to chase 
Don August (3-6). Griffey's home run was his seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Jackson pitched four strong innings in relief of starter Luis DeLeon, who 
improved his record to 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 6, Detroit 3 -- The Tigers only needed solid relief pitching for 
the last two innings at Kansas City, and they would have stretched their 
winning streak to four games. They didn't get it. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, trailing by 3-2 going into the eighth, the Royals rallied for four 
runs to pull it out. Pinch-hitters Bill Buckner and Mike Macfarlane each 
singled in a run, then Bo Jackson delivered a two-run single to clinch it. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was Mike Henneman, who retired the first two Royals in the eighth, 
then walked Jim Eisenreich, who came all the way home on Buckner's single. DAN

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
REDS LIKE THE VIEW FROM THEIR ROOMES, 10-8 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a league where pitchers have been in almost complete control, the division 
leaders got together Friday at Chicago and engaged in a slugfest. 
</P>
<P>
And, the game was decided when Rolando Roomes -- a former cricket player from 
Jamaica -- hit a two-run home run in the 12th inning to give the West-leading 
Cincinnati Reds a 10-8 victory over the East-leading Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
There were 27 hits in the game, with Roomes -- a virtual career minor leaguer 
before being called up by the Reds because of injuries to their outfielders -- 
getting three of them. 
</P>
<P>
There were a couple of other oddities, too. For one, Cincinnati reliever John 
Franco failed to hold a lead. An error in the ninth prevented the Reds' bullpen 
ace from getting his 16th save. 
</P>
<P>
And, the winning pitcher was supposed to be sitting out a two-game suspension. 
Rob Dibble, appealing the suspension for a bat-throwing incident earlier in the 
week, was allowed to pitch pending a hearing. He struck out five batters in two 
innings and improved his record to 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew our bullpen was short-handed. I figured it was better for me to be 
available now," Dibble said. "Maybe I won't be needed later." 
</P>
<P>
Roomes is an interesting story. He has been knocking around the minor leagues 
since he signed with the Cubs' organization in 1980. He usually hit well and 
with power, but had a problem with breaking pitches and struck out 35% of the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
He came to the Reds in an exchange of utility players after batting only 16 
times last year for the Cubs. The Reds had batting coach Tony Perez work with 
him during spring training, then sent him back to the minors. 
</P>
<P>
With Kal Daniels and Eric Davis hurt, they summoned Roomes. He might stay 
awhile. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony taught me to keep my right arm up in order to hit breaking balls and it's 
really paid off," Roomes, 27, said. "I'm learning to be patient." 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 3, Atlanta 0 -- Scott Terry (4-3), winless since April 27, held the 
Braves to two hits in seven innings and the Cardinals handed the Braves their 
sixth loss in a row and 11th in 13 games. The Braves have scored only 13 runs 
in the last 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
Willie McGee doubled in two runs in a three-run first inning. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 5, San Diego 0 -- Bryn Smith (5-1) pitched a six-hitter at San Diego, 
the Expos' third consecutive complete-game shutout. The Expos have not yielded 
a run in 28 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Andres Galarraga hit a two-run home run in the first inning and it made a loser 
of Dennis Rasmussen (2-5). 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 6, Philadelphia 1 -- After the Giants were shut out by Montreal 
in consecutive games, Scott Garrelts was hoping for any kind of offense when he 
faced the Phillies at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants scored early and often and Garrelts (3-1) went a strong seven 
innings, striking out eight. He gave up three hits. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 4, Pittsburgh 2 -- At Pittsburgh, Glenn Davis hit his 10th homer and 
Jim Clancy (2-4) won for the first time since he made his Astro debut April 8.

COLLINS AND BACH: BULLS' IMPROBABLE COACHING MATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER MAY, The Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
AUBURN HILLS, Mich. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the surface, they seem an improbable match. The young, energetic, 
impressionable head coach and the cool, elder assistant, a year shy of Social 
Security, with the cowboy boots and military mind. 
</P>
<P>
But it is a union of design and necessity, one of checks and balances that has, 
in time, crossed the normal boss-employee boundary to become something more. 
Something stronger. Something rare. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Collins, the coach, saw his father, Paul, die in January 1979. He believes 
he has found the next best thing in John Bach -- 26 years his senior -- whom he 
hired as an assistant in 1986 when he took over as the Chicago Bulls head 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I lost my own father, Johnny almost has become a second father to me," 
Collins said. "He has sort of become the guy who watches out for me. I'm very, 
very close to him." 
</P>
<P>
The hyperactive Collins, 37, has sometimes needed Bach's safety net, 
undoubtedly starting with the very first game in 1986 when Granville Waiters 
was the starting center. Since then, the Bulls have known plenty of adversity 
and frustration, and little of their present success, which has them tied 1-1 
with the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
"Doug can get so emotional at times that he seems to be totally drained," said 
Bach, who turns 64 July 10 and coached the Golden State Warriors from 1983-86. 
"You have to hang close to him because he needs someone to talk to and absorb 
the fears and disappointment. I feel that's my role, to be with him regardless 
of the hour. I think that's one reason our relationship has developed so well." 
</P>
<P>
Does he see himself in the role of surrogate father? 
</P>
<P>
"That's very flattering, but no," Bach said. "Uncle, maybe. Or older brother. 
But I knew Doug's father and I don't think I could ever be someone like that." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Collins, according to his son, was a lot like Bach. Or vice versa. The 
elder Collins was a political figure in the Benton, Ill., area, a county 
treasurer and sheriff who named his son, Douglas, after Illinois senator Paul 
Douglas. (Collins' full name is Paul Douglas Collins.) 
</P>
<P>
"My father was a very stoic man," Collins said. "After a game, it was always, 
'Nice game, son' and a handshake. That was all. I see a lot of my dad in 
Johnny. The tough-mindedness. The pussycat interior. And Johnny is the type of 
guy who'd do anything in the world for me. If I told him to rent a car and 
drive to Cleveland right now, he'd do it. And he wouldn't ask why." 
</P>
<P>
Says Collins, "Johnny is probably the most loyal man I've ever been around in 
my entire life. I don't know of anyone in the world I'd want with me more than 
him in a time of adversity because he sticks with you." 
</P>
<P>
Their paths crossed for the first time 17 years ago, when Bach already had 21 
years of coaching experience at Penn State and Fordham and had enjoyed a cup of 
coffee in the NBA with the Celtics in 1948-49 (and wore No. 17). Collins was a 
high-scoring, low-profile guard from Illinois State. 
</P>
<P>
The setting was the 1972 U.S. Olympic team tryouts. Collins easily made the 
team that Bach, as an assistant and Olympic Committee member, helped select. 
</P>
<P>
After the painful defeat in Munich to the Soviets -- a game Collins seemingly 
had won with two free throws -- the two drifted apart. Bach returned to Penn 
State. Collins went back to Illinois State and later to the NBA with the 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
Then, out of a job in 1986, Bach asked for an interview with the Bulls, who'd 
just hired Collins. 
</P>
<P>
"He absolutely blew me away with his organizational skills," Collins said. 
"I've never seen anyone like him. You talk about someone proud of his work. . . 
. " 
</P>
<P>
Collins quickly discovered Bach was something more than just an experienced 
hand. "He saw what didn't work for him at Golden State and he wanted to make 
sure it didn't happen to me," Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
And Bach quickly discovered that Collins, then 35, needed some guidance through 
the NBA minefield, someone to run interference between the coach and a referee 
or a dejected player or who knows what (a tall building? a sharp object?) after 
a particularly tough night. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, Collins said Bach provides a necessary dose of reality on a daily 
basis. While Collins was celebrating victories over the Cavaliers and Knicks, 
Bach already was looking ahead to the weightier task. 
</P>
<P>
"We call him Dr. Doom. After we beat Cleveland, he comes in the next day and 
says, 'OK, time to get on with it.' And after we beat New York, he did the same 
thing," Collins said.

HAWTHORNE TOPS ITS STATE RELAY RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Hawthorne High School boys' 400-meter relay team fell short of its goal of 
setting a national record, but for the second time within a week the Cougars 
broke the state record in the Masters track meet at Cerritos College Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne's time was 40.25, breaking the school's six-day-old state record of 
40.36, set last Saturday in the Southern Section 4-A Division finals. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his relay time, Cougar Coach Kye Courtney says that there is room for 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"We will break the record next week in the heats because tonight we had a bad 
exchange between Curtis (Conway) and Erik (Allen)," said Courtney, whose 
Cougars ran faster than USC did in winning last week's 400-meter relay in the 
Pacific 10 Conference meet. 
</P>
<P>
The top five finishers in each event Friday night qualified for next weekend's 
State meet. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne finished with nine event qualifiers overall, led by Conway, who won 
the 100 (10.66) and 200 meters (21.04) in addition to anchoring both relay 
teams to victories. The Cougars won the 1,600-meter relay in 3:13.43, with 
Conway running a 45.8 come-from-behind anchor split. 
</P>
<P>
Coley Candaele of Carpinteria was the only other boys' double individual 
winner, winning the 800 (1:51.58) and 1,600 meters (4:10.54). 
</P>
<P>
Angela Burnham of Oxnard Rio Mesa, the defending girls' 100 and 200-meters 
state champion, proved to be too strong for Pasadena Muir's Inger Miller in 
winning the 100 and 200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham, a senior, pulled away from Miller, a junior, down the stretch in both 
races to win in times of 11.52 in the 100 and 23.49 in the 200 meters. Both are 
the fastest times in the nation by a girl this season. 
</P>
<P>
Miller had a night of second-place finishes. Along with her sprint runner-up 
finishes (11.53 in the 100 and 23.84 in the 200 meters), she anchored the 
Mustangs to two seconds in relays. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' 400 relay, Hawthorne defeated Muir in a photo finish. Both teams 
were timed in 46.46. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1,600-meter relay, Rio Mesa won, 3:48.66 to 3:48.93.

Mark Rushlow's two run-scoring doubles led Hacienda Heights Wilson past 
Riverside Poly, 3-2, in a 5-A game at Wilson on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Rushlow's RBI doubles came in the first and fourth innings. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson (15-10-1), which finished third in the Sierra League, will play Long 
Beach Millikan on Tuesday.

<P>
Riverside Poly, the Citrus Belt regular-season champion, finished at 25-4.

Mammoth 14, Camarillo Christian 0 -- Danny Paranick pitched a no-hitter and had 
an RBI triple for Mammoth (11-9) in a small schools division game at Mammoth. 
</P>
<P>
Paranick is 11-2 this season. 
</P>

JOYNER-KERSEE TO RUN 400-METER HURDLES TODAY

<P>
Jackie Joyner-Kersee, the Olympic gold medalist in the heptathlon and long 
jump, is now looking for new worlds, or rather events, to conquer. 
</P>
<P>
The multi-event specialist has designated the 400-meter hurdles as her 
individual event of the year. 
</P>
<P>
She will make her season debut in that race today in the Bruce Jenner Bud Light 
track and field meet at San Jose City College. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner-Kersee is the co-American record-holder in the 100-meter hurdles at 
12.61 seconds. Now she's stretching out to the longer hurdles race. 
</P>
<P>
Even though she hasn't devoted much training time to the 400-meter hurdles 
previously, there are indications that Joyner-Kersee could be a top-ranked 
American if she has enough competition at that distance. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, while training for the Olympics in the heptathlon and long jump, she 
still managed to record a time of 55.74 to rank 10th among U.S. women in the 
400-meter hurdles. MAL FLORENCE

IMAX FILM MAKER AND HIS PURSUIT OF ACHIEVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In ballet there is no winning or losing. There is only the search for the 
impossible goal -- perfection. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bolshoi ballerina 
</P>
<P>
Nina Ananiashvili in "To the Limit." 
</P>
<P>
A rock climber scales the face of a treacherous cliff like a human fly. A skier 
hurtles down a slope at 60 m.p.h. A Russian ballerina leaps effortlessly into 
the air. Sweating and panting, speeding and soaring, the stars of the new 
giant-screen IMAX movie push themselves "To the Limit." 
</P>
<P>
Designed to explore how the human body works and proclaim its potential, the 
38-minute film opens today on the five-story-high screen at Mitsubishi IMAX 
Theater at the California Museum of Science and Industry. 
</P>
<P>
The movie's producer-director, Greg MacGillivray, had to meet a few challenges 
of his own, such as filming champion rock climber Tony Yaniro suspended 
thousands of feet up and making audiences feel as if they were racing down a 
hill like Olympian skier Maria Walliser. 
</P>
<P>
But getting to Moscow to film 26-year-old Bolshoi Ballet ballerina Nina 
Ananiashvili proved to be a nearly insurmountable obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a road fraught with tremendous red tape, almost endless red tape," 
MacGillivray said. The whole process took about 2 1/2 years for what resulted 
in less than 10 minutes of footage. 
</P>
<P>
MacGillivray, who has produced "To Fly," "Speed" and six other IMAX films, 
wanted to include ballet to broaden the $2.8-million film's scope beyond sports 
and science. "I wanted this to be about (the) pursuit of achievement in any 
endeavor," he said in his Laguna Beach office recently. Sequences that switch 
repeatedly from exacting rehearsal to polished performance at the Bolshoi 
Theatre are among those intended to show the effort required to excel in 
ballet, to make the difficult look easy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
MacGillivray selected Ananiashvili when the Bolshoi appeared here in 1987. He 
cited her arching leaps, later shot in slow motion, and the "joy and excitement 
about dancing in her eyes." He was also impressed by the rigorous Bolshoi 
training for which children must enter boarding school. Bolshoi dancer Irek 
Mukahamedov appears in the film as well, though the focus in on Ananiashvili. 
</P>
<P>
MacGillivray knew that working in the Soviet Union could lead to a bureaucratic 
bog, but he felt encouraged when the company's artistic director Yuri 
Grigorovich saw an IMAX movie for the first time in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Grigorovich came away insisting that the Bolshoi, whose name means "big" and a 
group that is widely considered one of the world's greatest ballet companies, " 
'must have IMAX!' " MacGillivray said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Soviet government approval wasn't forthcoming. Despite glasnost, "the 
main characteristic of the Russians is that no one wants to make a decision 
that's out of the ordinary or that they can be blamed for," he said. "We needed 
a letter of approval from the minister of culture and no one would ask him for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Finally however, the OK came with help from Occidental Petroleum chairman Dr. 
Armand Hammer, whose close ties to Soviet government officials helped rush 
American medical aid to Chernobyl during the 1987 nuclear-plant disaster. At 
Hammer's urging, the cultural minister wrote the approval letter. Hammer's 
documentary film operation later helped shoot the ballet sequence. 
</P>
<P>
Glitches continued to crop up during three weeks of filming in Moscow, 
MacGillivray said. For instance, a plan to shoot a full-company, fully costumed 
performance of the ballet "Don Quixote" fell through. Instead, Ananiashvili 
appears in short excerpts as Myrta, the queen of the Wilis from "Giselle," as 
Kitri, the lead in "Don Quixote," and as herself relaxing in Moscow's Red 
Square. 
</P>
<P>
Still, all went fairly well on the whole, he said. About 80 Soviet film and 
ballet technicians assisting his 10-member crew were warm and helpful, pledging 
to work as many hours as necessary to complete the job on time. And, while the 
film's material essentially confines itself to dance, there was no creative 
control or tampering from the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
"They looked at the script and said 'fine.' They had to approve (each site) we 
wanted to film, but never had any objection to anything we wanted to do. They 
even allowed us to shoot from the top of one of the highest buildings in 
Moscow. I don't think that would have been allowed several years ago. There was 
a whole new freshness about things. 
</P>
<P>
"It was absolutely fascinating to be there," said MacGillivray, 43, who has 
filmed in nearly every country. "Yes, the red tape was frustrating, but I'm 
certain it's always going to be the most interesting filming experience I'll 
ever encounter, especially having gone there now, with people opening up and 
feeling this new freedom."

FACES. . .: 'EVIL' LADY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD KLADY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It's fun to play a villain because there are no boundaries put on your 
conduct," says Joan Severance, the leggy, ruthless nemesis dogging Gene Wilder 
and Richard Pryor's trail in "See No Evil, Hear No Evil." 
</P>
<P>
Scarcely taking a breath, she adds, that it's "fun to do other things too." 
</P>
<P>
Along the 29-year-old actress's route to the screen she has managed to partake 
in many of those other interests. Severance left college to pursue a successful 
modeling career in Europe, operated a self-described "nouvelle Mex" restaurant 
and learned to play tenor saxophone. 
</P>
<P>
"Ironically, one of the best things that ever happened to me was coming in 
fourth in a beauty pageant. It shook me up not to win but it also pushed me on 
to challenge myself in a way I'd never done up to that point." 
</P>
<P>
She says that a healthy imagination has allowed her to blur the line between 
her fantasies and what she has been able to accomplish. The Texas native had 
initially aspired to a career as a veterinarian but discovered her ideas in 
genetics ran counter to the rules of nature. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to breed animals smaller and people looked at me like I was Dr. 
Frankenstein," she says. "But now I live out my fantasy by playing a 
veterinarian in 'Bird on a Wire.' I'm Mel Gibson's ex-lover and a sweet 
person." 
</P>
<P>
Severance first gained attention as a performer in television's "Wise Guy," 
playing the evil, manipulative Susan Profitt. She finds it curious that most of 
her roles have leaned toward the villainous but relishes the challenge. On "See 
No Evil" she jokes that just keeping a straight face around Wilder's and 
Pryor's antics was a major feat. 
</P>
<P>
The actress next does battle as Hulk Hogan's publicist in the forthcoming "No 
Holds Barred." 
</P>
<P>
"I've also finished a film for ABC about a woman who works for the government 
as a thief, and I'm writing something for myself that casts me as a female 
James Bond. It's getting a lot harder to keep my fantasies in check." LEONARD 
KLADY

ROURKE IN DISPUTE OVER 'HOMEBOY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mickey Rourke's latest movie, "Homeboy," has already reached some European 
markets but the actor is trying to prevent its release here in the United 
States, arguing in a suit filed Thursday that the film's producers failed to 
pay him and denied him creative control. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a contract," said Rourke's attorney Gerald Edelstein. "All we're 
trying to do is enforce it." Rourke plays a boxer in "Homeboy," which was 
filmed in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, also seeks $4 million in 
damages from producer Elliott Kastner and his Cinema International Corp. 
Kastner did not return calls Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Rourke contends that the producers failed to let him approve the film's final 
editing and music and violated a 1986 agreement by failing to pay him and his 
company $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
He also alleges the producers denied him him approval of where and when the 
movie initially will be distributed.

<TEXT>
<P>
Craig T. Nelson has been a very busy man this year. 
</P>
<P>
Though one of his more salient roles was as the beleaguered father in the 
original "Poltergeist," he has this year been seen in HBO's "Murderers Among 
Us: The Simon Wiesenthal Story," the Shelley Long feature "Troop Beverly Hills" 
and the yet-to-be-released "Turner and Hooch" with Tom Hanks. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson is working on a six-hour miniseries called "Desperadoes," about a Drug 
Enforcement Agency agent who was kidnaped and killed in Guadalajara, based on 
the book of the same name by journalist Elaine Shannon. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's ABC's "Coach," the Wednesday night sitcom just renewed by ABC. 
Nelson plays Hayden Fox, a football coach at a northern college who after 16 
years suddenly has to cope with being a father to his 18-year-old daughter who 
has enrolled at his school. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd done comedy early on with Barry Levinson and had lost that in the 
intervening years: People didn't know me as a comedian, so I decided to do a 
half-hour sitcom," says Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson along with Levinson used to write for Lohman and Barkley and they even 
had a stand-up routine. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done three or four heavies in a row. There's a close relationship between 
heavies and comedy though," he says. "And doing this show was like going back 
to live theater because you're getting ready for a week and then you have two 
shows on Friday and things get changed. I liked the pressure, I liked the risk 
and that's why I went into it. 
</P>
<P>
"I went into this show with no intention of it being a big hit, but for it to 
be a good show. The payoff may not be there, in terms of what everyone wants 
out of it, but it's already been there for me and that's more than enough." SUE 
MARTIN

SIMPLE STORIES OF POOR CHILDREN'S URGENT PLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Avert your eyes from the grimy figure sleeping in a doorway. Feel the frisson 
of fear induced by the sight of abject poverty. Could you ever end up like 
that? What would happen to your family? 
</P>
<P>
"America's Children: The Poorest in a Land of Plenty," airing Sunday at 10 a.m. 
on Channel 4, asks you to go beyond fear -- or pity or contempt -- and see the 
faces behind the poverty statistics. Particularly the youngest faces. 
</P>
<P>
Remarkable for its eloquent black-and-white still photographs by Pulitzer 
Prize-winner Eli Reed, the hourlong film, produced by the National Council of 
Churches as part of "The Promise of America II" series, profiles the lives of 
seven parents and their children in a struggle for survival with dignity. 
</P>
<P>
In clear, measured tones, narrator Maya Angelou ("I Know Why the Caged Bird 
Sings") offers an inexorable list of statistics, presented as poetry and pulpit 
exhortation. 
</P>
<P>
"Cry out in shame" is the program's repeated demand. 
</P>
<P>
We must feel shame that we allow 13 million children to live in poverty, 
Angelou tells us, and that the United States and South Africa are the only two 
industrialized nations out of 20 that don't provide comprehensive prenatal and 
child care. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, those profiled -- chosen from the West and East coasts, the 
Midwest and the South -- tell their stories simply. Teen-agers fear shabby 
clothes will earn them ridicule, a little girl wishes for a baby doll, a farmer 
grieves for his lost land, a woman can't have a necessary operation. 
</P>
<P>
One mother wants to reassure us that poor people are "OK" people, not threats 
of some kind. 
</P>
<P>
And these are the fortunate ones. They are being given a lifeline by a few 
church and community groups to help them climb out of the deepening pit of 
"dependency, crime and joblessness." 
</P>
<P>
Urgency, not subtlety, is the tone here: We can fix the problem, we are told, 
but if we ignore the plight of others it could be "the bankruptcy of all our 
dreams." LYNNE HEFFLEY

LITTLE FIRE IN HO-HUM 'THIRD DEGREE BURN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"He's not stupid, but he has a weakness. He's a fool for love, a sucker for an 
old-fashioned romance." 
</P>
<P>
That's how private eye Scott Weston (Treat Williams) is described in "Third 
Degree Burn" (Home Box Office, Sunday at 8 p.m.), and it's fairly accurate. 
</P>
<P>
Hired by a jealous husband (Richard Masur) to trail a beautiful young wife 
(Virginia Madsen) while she visits a desert spa, Weston falls into bed and into 
love with the woman. 
</P>
<P>
When the two of them return to Seattle, they resume their affair, nuzzling in 
public places without a second thought, even though both know full well how 
jealous the husband is. But then someone is murdered, followed by the usual 
complications. 
</P>
<P>
They're a bit too usual -- the script by Duncan Gibbons and Yale Udoff trods 
familiar territory. And, natch, in the tradition of film noir, the plot becomes 
fairly impenetrable as it nears its end. It's easy not to spill the beans on 
this one, for it's hard to figure out exactly where those beans are. 
</P>
<P>
Under Roger Spottiswoode's direction, Williams and Madsen do create some sizzle 
in their early scenes together. Yet the film's look is generally as 
conventional as its script. There's something perfunctory about the whole 
enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
At least the casting offers something unusual in the intriguing presence of CCH 
Pounder as Weston's ex-wife and continuing assistant, who happens to be black.

TEAM PENNING: SPEED, SKILL . . . AND HORSE SENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE K. SCHENDEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lynda and Jerry McDaniel look restless as they stand outside the Coto de Caza 
arena where they, along with teammate Mike Ask, just competed in the first 
go-round of a weekend team penning competition. They listen attentively for the 
results to be announced, because a win here brings their three-person team 
closer to the next day's finals. 
</P>
<P>
When you think of team sports, team penning probably doesn't immediately come 
to mind. The players don't run and there's no ball to throw, dribble or kick 
around. Even cross-trainer athletic shoes -- for the athlete who does it all -- 
are inappropriate. The players compete in Western hats, boots and jeans. The 
equipment includes saddles, aggressive horses and a corral. 
</P>
<P>
But team penning has all the components of more conventional sports: speed, 
skill, patience and the ability to outsmart a rather beefy opponent -- a cow. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Throwback to Branding Days 
</P>
<P>
"It goes back to the old days when they wanted to brand cattle," Jerry McDaniel 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Only in team penning, cowboys, cowgirls and cowkids forgo the branding iron and 
do it for fun, for the competition and, sometimes, for the money. Teams of all 
men, all women or both men and women drive or "cut" three cows (with identical 
numbers on their backs) out of a herd of 30 cattle and guide them into a pen. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't touch the cattle at all," rider Pat Siva says. "Neither the horse 
nor the rider can have any physical contact with the animals." 
</P>
<P>
How does a rider get the cattle's attention? 
</P>
<P>
"You holler a lot, that's what you do," says Siva, who rides on an all-women 
team in weeknight team penning competitions at Riverside Rancheros in 
Riverside. She describes team penning as being similar to cutting, but in 
cutting one rider dogs a single steer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Simple . . . or Disastrous 
</P>
<P>
"Team penning is much faster and with a whole herd," Siva says. "There are 
three of us dashing around to get three cows out. Done right, it looks simple. 
If the cows don't cooperate, it's disastrous." 
</P>
<P>
The penning begins when the riders cross the starting line. When the last cow 
is in the corral, a rider throws an arm into the air to stop the clock. A time 
of 40 seconds or less is usually good enough to place. 
</P>
<P>
Though anyone can participate in team penning, having a little horse sense is 
definitely an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're looking at a cow, you try to figure out which way it's going to go 
-- it helps to be psychic," Siva says, laughing. "When you're looking in the 
cow's eyes, you're wondering, 'Which way is that sucker going to go?' You've 
got to be there because these little guys (averaging about 400-500 pounds) run 
like the dickens." 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I enter the ring I get butterflies," Jerry McDaniel says, "and my 
horse knows it. The horse does too -- he swishes his tail and is all excited. 
But the minute you get galloping down the arena, it all goes away." 
</P>
<P>
There is some order to the action in the arena. McDaniel says most teams follow 
a simple strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"One person at a time will go into the herd and start cutting out their 
number," he says. "The holder (the third rider) will follow, keeping the other 
cows back. If you get more than four cows across the line, you're disqualified, 
so somebody has to stay in front of the herd." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Quick and the Cows 
</P>
<P>
It's not all that easy to persuade a 500-pound cow to abandon its friends. 
</P>
<P>
"They're pretty social," McDaniel says. "You have to shift (roles) real quick 
sometimes. The whole key to team penning is communication. You can have the 
best plan going -- as long as the cattle go along with it. Most of the time 
they don't, and you have to adapt." 
</P>
<P>
The frequency of team penning competitions and the growth of the Professional 
Team Penning Assn. and World Team Penning Assn. are evidence of a growing 
popularity for the sport. The McDaniels of Merced say they attend team penning 
competitions two or three times a month. 
</P>
<P>
"We've penned in snow, we've penned in hundred-degree weather, we've never 
called one off," says Lynda McDaniel, who also is secretary of the Professional 
Team Penning Assn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Action in Merced 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, Merced is hosting its annual team penning competition, at Merced 
Horsemen's Arena. That event benefits the Crippled Children's Society (in 9 
years more than $90,000 has been raised for the society), and coming up in June 
are team penning events in Santa Maria and Reno, and Fourth of July Weekend in 
Madera. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of action," Pat Siva says, explaining the interest in the sport, 
"and it's addictive, just like gambling. You think you're going to win next 
time for sure." 
</P>
<P>
Siva, a former trick rider and stunt double, whose teammates are a polo 
instructor and a former barrel racer, insists that team penning is not a sport 
only a rodeo professional can love. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry McDaniel agrees: "A lot of them are lifetime riders, but anybody who can 
ride a horse and can rein a horse can get involved in this sport." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
His Greatest Challenge 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel should know, he took up horseback riding only six years ago. And as a 
sergeant in the California Highway Patrol, McDaniel says in his 21 years on the 
force -- including time as a driving instructor -- nothing has touched the 
challenge of team penning. 
</P>
<P>
The popularity of the sport is quickly extending to other states, especially in 
the West, Lynda McDaniel says. As secretary, she sends out information that 
will help satellite areas establish sanctioned team penning events. 
</P>
<P>
Men and women compete in the open divisions, and there also are divisions for 
women, seniors, even children 12 and younger. 
</P>
<P>
"They have very competitive times," Lynda McDaniel says of the youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
"They do the same thing as the adults," Jerry adds. "They have the same 30 head 
of cattle, they have to cut three out and steer them into the pen. Of course, 
the up-and-coming kids are the ones who are going to be the competition down 
the road." 
</P>
<P>
How do you turn kids away from skateboards and video games and turn them on to 
team penning? 
</P>
<P>
"You put them on a horse," Jerry says confidently.

GARAGE SALES MAY YIELD TREASURES OF FORMER LIVES FOR BARGAIN(ED) PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER W. FREY

<TEXT>
<P>
Everything runs in cycles. Time becomes work, work becomes money, money becomes 
possessions and, after you acquire so many of them you don't have room to park 
your car anymore, possessions become a garage sale. 
</P>
<P>
In a city of 3.5 million people, that cycle reaches its peak for hundreds of 
people every weekend. A quantitative perusal of the current issue of the 
Recycler, item 247 . . . garage sales, will yield in excess of 300 ads placed 
by people who've finally reached the ultimate conclusion to one of life's 
equations that is never taught in math class: Storage volume divided by mass 
quantities of things you haven't used in years equals "get rid of it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Three Factors Should Be Considered 
</P>
<P>
And there are three catalytic factors in deciding to hold a garage sale instead 
of shoveling it all into boxes and calling your favorite charity to pick it up 
or just throwing it in trash. 
</P>
<P>
First, you paid a lot of money for that stuff, and you just can't bear to give 
it up without getting something in return. 
</P>
<P>
Second, if you approach it in the right frame of mind, holding a garage sale 
can be a social occasion with a good deal of entertainment value. 
</P>
<P>
And third, some people will buy absolutely anything. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the people who came in early this morning paid 50 cents for a 
3-year-old pair of leotards with holes in one toe," said Kathe Nolan, holding a 
co-venture garage sale with friend Brenda Rogers in the front yard of her Van 
Nuys home. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard the old saying that one man's treasure . . . but I'm still 
flabbergasted at what people will buy. Holding a weekend garage sale is a 
two-day lesson in human nature," she said. 
</P>
<P>
An essential tenet of that nature is that the early bird gets the good stuff -- 
and we do mean early. If you intend to start your sale at the civilized hour of 
10 a.m., plan on the first shoppers arriving an hour early. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prepare to Haggle 
</P>
<P>
And forget about eliminating the dickering and giving the whole affair a 
cut-and-dried retail flavor by attaching price tags on everything. Be prepared 
to haggle down to 5 cents on the dollar, especially later in the afternoon, or 
be prepared to spend Sunday evening hauling boxes back into the garage. 
</P>
<P>
"We advertised the sale as running from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m., but all the good 
stuff sold in the 45 minutes before we officially opened," said Julie Bisson, 
director of the Nurtury preschool that operates in the basement of the Sherman 
Oaks Methodist Church, and organizer of the school's annual yard sale. "With 
more than 30 families donating goods, we all had a great time and were able to 
raise more than $1,000 for the school," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"You might think that, because the sale was in the front yard of the church and 
all the items had price tags, people would tend to pay full price," Bisson 
said. "But they bargained just as hard as they would anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Although a small group of people make a living either holding or going to 
garage/yard/moving/estate/etc. sales, for most they are an occasional activity 
and some guidance would be beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tips for Buyers 
</P>
<P>
Advice to buyers is simple: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Look at the ads in the Recycler, the Penny Saver and other local 
publications to determine where and when sales are being held. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Use a map to plot an efficient route. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Get out and about early. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Carry cash in small denominations. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Drive a station wagon, pickup, van or 18-wheeler -- depending upon your 
propensity to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wear comfortable shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Make sure you've got someplace at home to store all the junk -- uh, 
treasure -- that you buy. 
</P>
<P>
"Finding a real bargain makes me feel good," said Janice Davis, a Van Nuys 
resident who admits to being a garage-sale junkie. 
</P>
<P>
"In the summer, every Saturday I go from one garage sale to the next, 8 to 10 a 
day," she said. "It gives me a chance to get out and meet people, and I'm able 
to buy a lot of things I need for a fraction of what they'd cost new." 
</P>
<P>
If you're on the selling end, there's a little more to do. For instance, you 
should check with the local police department or city clerk's office to see if 
a permit is required in your city. 
</P>
<P>
Next on the list is getting the word out. Letting as many people as possible 
know about your sale is the most critical step in a successful sale. 
Advertising in your local paper, or the Recycler, is an effective way to reach 
likely customers. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper ads will reach the garage-sale regulars, but to attract drive-by 
customers, large, easy-to-read signs posted around the neighborhood are a must. 
</P>
<P>
The next critical factor is to have enough merchandise on display to encourage 
people to stop. A few forlorn items sitting on a beach towel spread on the lawn 
isn't going to attract many buyers. Invite neighbors or other family members to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small Touches 
</P>
<P>
And there are other, seemingly small touches that can make for a more 
profitable sale. Be sure to have plenty of small change on hand, and your 
pricing policy should be to ask for more than you are actually willing to sell 
it for, with prices starting higher in the morning and slowly dropping as the 
afternoon goes by. 
</P>
<P>
If you have clothes for sale, make sure they're clean and display them on 
hangers, not in boxes. People tend to assume items sitting on the ground are 
less valuable. Group items together, such as electronic equipment, books, 
glassware and kids' toys. And the ever-popular "Everything in this box $1" is a 
good way to dispose of those myriad little items not worth bargaining over. 
</P>
<P>
If all this seems like more than you want to get involved in, there's 
professional help to be had. John Wilson is a garage sale "consultant," who, 
for a very reasonable fee, organizes and executes sales for charitable 
organizations and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, a collector himself -- especially of movie memorabilia -- gained some 
of his expertise as a salesperson at Catchall V, an antiques and collectibles 
store that is open every Friday and sometimes Saturday afternoons on Colorado 
Boulevard in Eagle Rock. He also assists exhibitors at paper and memorabilia 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
"The key to a successful garage or yard sale is to make it look and operate as 
much like an informal, outdoor store as possible," Wilson said. "Advertising, 
display and salesmanship are all part of the game, as is the degree of flair 
and energy you bring to the task. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing makes people feel better than getting a bargain," Wilson said, "but 
there's no reason the seller shouldn't get as much out of it as the buyers."

BANKER, MAYOR MET BEFORE CITY DEPOSIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR and GLENN F. BUNTING, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley met in his City Hall office with Far East National Bank 
Chairman Henry Hwang early last year while the mayor was serving as a paid 
adviser to the bank and Hwang was actively soliciting deposits from the city, 
newly obtained records show. 
</P>
<P>
The March 16, 1988, meeting came five days before the bank received a 
$1-million city deposit. The mayor has repeatedly insisted that he did not 
know, during the 12-month period he earned $18,000 as a foreign trade adviser 
to Far East National Bank, that the bank did business with the city. 
</P>
<P>
No details are known about the meeting, which was revealed in copies of 
Bradley's appointments calendar obtained by The Times on Friday. Hwang's office 
said he was unavailable for comment. Assistant City Atty. Charles Goldenberg, 
who is heading the city attorney's office investigation into Bradley's 
financial ties, declined comment late Friday. And a spokesman for the mayor 
said Bradley, too, would have no comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Returns $18,000 
</P>
<P>
Saying he had just learned of the city's relationship with Far East, Bradley in 
March of this year returned the $18,000, which he had earned as the only paid 
member of a bank advisory board from January through December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Records obtained earlier this month indicated that Bradley's office, at least, 
had been aware of a relationship between the city and Far East. They show that 
Bradley's office had received a request in January, 1988, from Hwang for city 
deposits, and that one of the mayor's aides then asked City Treasurer Leonard 
Rittenberg to prepare a response to Hwang's request. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley faces several investigations into various aspects of his finances, 
including the city attorney's probe for a possible conflict of interest 
concerning his employment by the bank. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor has made it clear that any questions regarding the exact contents of 
the inquiry will be deferred until after it is completed," William Chandler, 
spokesman for the mayor, said Friday. "Then he will answer any and all 
questions." 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 calendar shows that the mayor scheduled a half-hour meeting with Hwang 
beginning at 8:30 a.m. on March 16. The following Monday, March 21, the bank 
received a $1-million, one-year deposit from the city treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doing Business Since 1979 
</P>
<P>
City records show that Far East has been doing business with the city almost 
constantly since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
When a $1-million deposit matured on March 22 of this year, the city removed 
the funds. The following day, Hwang called Bradley to ask if the city had 
changed its policy of depositing funds in small and minority-owned banks, 
according to Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor then called City Treasurer Rittenberg to inquire about the policy. It 
was during this discussion, Bradley has said in earlier interviews, that he 
first learned that the city had deposits in Far East. 
</P>
<P>
The following day, Rittenberg personally directed a $1-million deposit to Far 
East and, several days later, an additional $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Rittenberg has maintained that neither Bradley nor the mayor's staff influenced 
his decision to deposit funds with the bank.

PAN PACIFIC FIRE BLAMED ON ARSONIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until the arrival of Mattie, Los Angeles arson investigators working the ruins 
of the historic Pan Pacific Auditorium were stumped. The place is so huge they 
did not know where to put vapor-detection equipment that must be no more than 
four inches from a source. 
</P>
<P>
But a few minutes after the 4-year-old black Labrador from Meriden, Conn., 
began sniffing the floor on Friday, investigators confirmed the presence of 
numerous spots showing evidence of flammable, volatile liquid. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Chief Donald O. Manning said during a news conference at the Beverly 
Boulevard site a few hours later that the pattern the dog identified helped 
arson investigators confirm what they had suspected: Wednesday's fire at the 
54-year-old Streamline Moderne arena was set deliberately. 
</P>
<P>
The chief said the finding is the first step in any attempt to solve the crime. 
A laboratory analysis using gas chromatography will take several days to 
identify the liquid used to start the fire, he said. 
</P>
<P>
And although officials now are convinced that the fire was the work of one or 
more arsonists, they have no identified suspects. Investigators continue to 
seek information about reports that several people were seen in the cavernous 
structure just before the fire started, the chief added. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, despite statements from elected officials that a $14.6-million plan 
for commercial restoration of the huge indoor arena should be abandoned, 
developer Joseph Kornwasser said he is "ready, willing and able" to keep the 
project alive even though that now means massive reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
The use of Mattie, who can detect the presence of 17 flammable liquids at 
levels far more faint than can electronic probes, was the first use on the West 
Coast of a dog specially trained to assist arson investigators, according to 
the fire chief. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had been skeptical about using such a dog but had been persuaded by 
her performance at Pan Pacific and now supports the request of arson 
investigators to get one of their own. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ferraro to Seek Funding 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Council President John Ferraro, who attended the news 
conference, said he intends to lobby the council Finance Committee for funding. 
</P>
<P>
Mattie's handler, Doug Lancelot, a Connecticut State Police trooper, said she 
is one of five specially trained dogs working with fire departments in the 
United States. He said that she has assisted in the investigation of more than 
200 fires and that laboratory analyses have confirmed her scentings about 75% 
of the time. 
</P>
<P>
He said her nose, which can detect flammable vapors in concentrations measured 
in parts per billion, is about 1,000 times more sensitive than electronic 
probes that can pick up vapor concentrations only in parts per million. 
</P>
<P>
Her presence at the Los Angeles fire site was in large part a result of the 
efforts of arson investigator Tony La Palio, who read about Mattie in a 
California magazine for arson investigators and began lobbying his superiors to 
find out more. 
</P>
<P>
"It took me six months to convince my boss," he said, adding that her 
performance Friday was the clincher. "There is nothing like seeing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of bringing the dog here, estimated at $1,000, will be paid by the 
U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms and Tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
Wrangling over the building's future continued. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we are concerned," developer Kornwasser said in an interview, "the 
project can still be rehabilitated. For us, the Pan Pacific was a real labor of 
love and it continues to be that. It is real sad that people don't view the Pan 
Pacific in its historical perspective." 
</P>
<P>
The county planned to restore the building, which was on the National Register 
of Historic Places, by installing an ice-skating rink, a rhythmic gymnastics 
facility, movie theaters, a food court, restaurants, a sporting goods shop, 
park offices and meeting rooms for community groups. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors had opposed the project, saying the entertainment-oriented 
development would bring crime, traffic, late-night noises, graffiti and parking 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
County Rent 
</P>
<P>
According to a preliminary agreement with the architectural and development 
team of Kornwasser &amp; Friedman/Goldrich &amp; Kest, the county was to get an 
estimated $3.8 million in rent in the first 10 years of the project; officials 
hoped the money would defray the cost of keeping up the state-owned park, which 
is administered by the county. 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro, Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky and Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Ed Edelman said Thursday in the wake of the fire that the plans to 
develop the Pan Pacific site should be scaled down. 
</P>
<P>
Kornwasser criticized the two city councilmen for pronouncing the 
county-sponsored project dead and added that he intends to work with county and 
state officials to see if he can revive the project.

NEW WAVE OF ASIANS IS MOVING BEYOND MONTEREY PARK IN THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ASHLEY DUNN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Norman Hsu remembers his first impressions of Monterey Park when he came to 
this country from Indonesia in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Bustling streets, Chinese shops, the sound of Mandarin and Cantonese being 
spoken on the street. Hsu was struck by its similarity to his hometown of 
Pancoran, a Chinese enclave in Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
But he also found relentless traffic, crime and a lack of peace among the races 
-- also reminders of life in Indonesia. He decided to settle about 10 miles 
east of there in Hacienda Heights instead. 
</P>
<P>
"Monterey Park and (nearby) Alhambra are like starting points for new 
immigrants," Hsu said. "But once they've settled down, they want to move on." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Migration 
</P>
<P>
After more than a decade of booming growth that transformed Monterey Park into 
the nation's first suburban Chinatown, a second migration of the Asian 
community in the San Gabriel Valley is now taking place. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Asians have followed in Hsu's footsteps in recent years, bypassing 
or leaving Monterey Park for the pastel-colored housing tracts and tree-lined 
streets of the eastern portion of the valley. 
</P>
<P>
Fueled by a desire to assimilate into American society or to avoid the 
congestion, racial tensions or skyrocketing housing prices in communities near 
Monterey Park, an increasing number of Asians are settling in an area eastward 
along the Pomona Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Of the estimated 180,000 Asians in the San Gabriel Valley, a quarter live along 
this 15-mile corridor, encompassing the cities of Walnut, Hacienda Heights, 
Rowland Heights and Diamond Bar, according to school enrollment figures, real 
estate brokers and community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The migration includes Koreans, Cambodians and Vietnamese, but the largest 
group appears to be Chinese from Taiwan, Hong Kong or China. 
</P>
<P>
"Monterey Park will always be the center, but living-wise, people are moving 
further away," said Fred Hsieh, a Chinese developer who is largely credited 
with sparking the boom in Monterey Park. "For anyone who can drive, there's no 
reason to stay anymore." 
</P>
<P>
The eastward migration has been followed by a blossoming of Asian businesses, 
community groups and cultural centers that have made cities such as Hacienda 
Heights (known as Ha Gang) or Walnut (known as Hu Tao Shi) as familiar to some 
in Taiwan as they are to Angelenos. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Super Supermarket 
</P>
<P>
Just last month, businessman Roger Chen and investors from Taiwan opened in 
Rowland Heights one of the largest Asian grocery stores in the nation -- an 
acre of splashing fish, pungent sauces and fresh produce. 
</P>
<P>
Korean acupuncture clinics and Chinese supermarkets dot Colima Boulevard, a 
major valley thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
On a hillside in Hacienda Heights, Fo Kuang Shan, Taiwan's preeminent Buddhist 
organization, opened an awe-inspiring monastery last year that is the largest 
in the Western Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
As the movement into the eastern reaches of the valley continues, small but 
discernible changes have occurred in Monterey Park and nearby Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we've reached the saturation point and we're growing very slowly," 
said Alhambra City Manager Kevin Murphy. "This isn't the hot place it used to 
be." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boom Is Over 
</P>
<P>
Asians now account for about half of Monterey Park's 64,600 residents, but 
school enrollment figures show that their numbers are growing at the slowest 
rate since the boom began in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone rushed in and now it's maxed out," said Anthony Woo, a bilingual 
specialist for the Garvey School District. "The word boom is over." 
</P>
<P>
Hsu, like others, said he was determined not to repeat his family's insular 
existence in Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
"Pancoran is like Monterey Park -- all the Chinese live together," he said. 
"When I came to this country, I didn't want to live in Monterey Park. I wanted 
to assimilate." 
</P>
<P>
So Hsu, 53, a postal worker, moved to a tract home in Hacienda Heights, where 
as recently as 1980 there were fewer than 200 Chinese families. Today, that 
community's local association of Chinese residents has more than 500 families 
as members. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buying Larger Homes 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, skyrocketing housing prices in Monterey Park also have made it 
tempting for some Asian residents to sell their homes and buy larger, more 
modern homes in the eastern San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Others have been forced to look east because they can no longer afford a house 
in Monterey Park and its neighboring cities, where the average home price 
pushed past $230,000 during the last six months, according to listings of home 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Frank Chin, a 34-year-old software engineer who brought his family 
to the United States from Vietnam, began looking for a house in Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
He envisioned a fixer-upper but was dismayed that two-bedroom homes were 
selling for more than $200,000. Chin ended up buying a new four-bedroom house 
in the Chino Hills area for $160,000. 
</P>
<P>
"For less money we got this house and you don't have to do anything to it," he 
said. "They used to say, 'Go west, young man.' Now, it's, 'Go east.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
School Enrollment 
</P>
<P>
In Walnut, the migration is illustrated by school enrollment statistics showing 
that the number of Asian students in the Walnut Valley School District has 
nearly tripled, from 847 to 2,391, since 1984 and has been increasing by about 
30% each year. Asians now make up about a fifth of the 11,553 students in the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
The concentration of Asian residents in the eastern San Gabriel Valley is still 
far below that of Alhambra and Monterey Park. And because there has been little 
commercial development accompanying the eastward migration, the movement has 
caused far less turmoil than in Monterey Park. But there have been sporadic 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
On the hillside above Hacienda Heights is the Hsi Lai Temple, a sprawling 
complex of red pillars and gold trim that looms over nearby tract homes like a 
vision from imperial China. 
</P>
<P>
Residents complained that the temple had no place in a residential 
neighborhood, but it was built anyway and it opened its gates last year. 
</P>
<P>
Some neighbors still bear a lingering bitterness over the project and the new 
Asian residents. "They don't want to mix, they don't want to become Americans," 
said Sharon Pluth, a community leader. "As an American, I feel a little strange 
in my own country." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Crimes 
</P>
<P>
A more disturbing phenomenon has been the appearance in the last year of new 
crimes in the eastern San Gabriel Valley that police are still struggling to 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Dennis Miller of the sheriff's station in Industry has saved a file 
of photocopied crime reports that he began compiling last May, when the first 
of a series of unusual crimes occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Around 10 p.m. one night, two men armed with pistols burst into a Hacienda 
Heights home, bound the hands of family members and threatened to kill the 
youngest child unless the family handed over its valuables. 
</P>
<P>
Both the victims and the robbers, who were never caught, were Vietnamese. There 
have been at least nine other similar residential robberies since May. 
</P>
<P>
"They've never picked a person without money and they've never picked a 
non-Asian," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Feel Threatened 
</P>
<P>
For some, like Monterey Park Mayor Barry Hatch, who has become a national media 
personality because of his table-thumping views on immigration, the changes are 
threatening. 
</P>
<P>
"The race of the Chinese has over a billion people and they're looking for a 
soft place to land," he said. "There's nowhere else but here. The whole valley 
is what they want." 
</P>
<P>
But for others, there is no grand design in the eastward migration. It is a 
movement in search of a better life that began in the Far East and has 
continued in this country. 
</P>
<P>
David Chen came to America a decade ago so his children could receive a good 
education. He is now a partner in an advertising company on Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
He has four cars in the driveway, two sons in college and, if he looks hard 
enough from the second floor, above the trees and rooftops, he can just catch a 
glimpse of a peak in the Puente Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"The American Dream?" he said. "I think I'm not too far away."

LURID TALE OF PRODUCER'S KILLING SPUN IN COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brash and flamboyant, New York theatrical producer Roy A. Radin considered 
himself a consummate showman. But the plot line that has unfolded during a Los 
Angeles court hearing into his brutal murder is turning out to be far more 
compelling than anything he ever staged. 
</P>
<P>
Tales of sex, drugs and high-flying Hollywood deal-making have swirled around 
the Radin case over the last two weeks, as prosecutors seek to prove that the 
rotund, 33-year-old producer became a victim of the treacherous world in which 
he lived. 
</P>
<P>
One witness testified that Radin, killed six years ago while negotiating over 
the rights to the film "Cotton Club," bought and consumed massive amounts of 
cocaine in the months leading up to his death. Another said Radin's alleged 
killers, three former bodyguards for pornography king Larry Flynt, bragged of 
shooting him so many times that he couldn't be identified. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tempestuous Relationship 
</P>
<P>
There have also been detailed descriptions of Radin's tempestuous relationship 
with Karen DeLayne (Lanie) Greenberger, 42, who is alleged in court testimony 
to be a cocaine trafficker, social climber and plastic surgery promoter accused 
of plotting the producer's death while the two were negotiating the "Cotton 
Club" deal with producer Robert Evans. 
</P>
<P>
And, if that weren't enough, there was even pathos this week as a star witness, 
former Radin assistant Jonathan Lawson, showed up appearing drunk, trembling 
and sobbing to the dismay of the judge. 
</P>
<P>
These events are being recorded by a battery of reporters, authors and 
producers who see the makings of a major story in the Radin case, especially if 
former Paramount Pictures chief Evans, 58, is implicated in the cocaine-murder 
scenario. The word around Judge Patti Jo McKay's courtroom, site of the 
preliminary hearing, is that there are already five motion picture deals in the 
works. 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the drama are the gray-haired, fashionably dressed and 
relaxed-looking Greenberger and her co-defendants, Alex L. Marti, William M. 
Mentzer and Robert U. Lowe. Lowe is fighting extradition from Maryland, but 
Marti and Mentzer shuffle into court with Greenberger each morning, alternately 
snickering and moping as the proceedings drag on. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say that the three guards kidnaped and murdered Radin on 
Greenberger's orders, shooting him in the head 13 times and dumping his body in 
a remote canyon near Gorman. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberger and Radin had become friends in early 1983 and Greenberger later 
helped Radin get his start in films by introducing him to Evans. But in 
testimony this week, Lawson said Radin and Greenberger had a falling out over 
drugs, money and Greenberger's role in the film. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sizable Drug Theft 
</P>
<P>
Lawson testified that on one occasion Radin stopped payment on a $4,000 to 
$5,000 check, written to Greenberger for cocaine, because the drugs made him 
ill; that Greenberger subsequently accused Radin of participating in a sizable 
drug theft from her home, and that Greenberger flew into a rage when Radin and 
Evans allegedly cut her out of the deal on the financing and production rights 
for the movie about the Cotton Club, the famed Harlem nightclub of the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
"Did she tell you this was important to her?" Greenberger's attorney, Edward 
Shohat, asked of the production deal. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Lawson answered. 
</P>
<P>
"And there was obviously emotion involved in the matter?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Lawson replied again. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Details of Agreement 
</P>
<P>
The agreement called for Radin to raise $35 million to finance the "Cotton 
Club" movie, Lawson testified. In return, Radin and Evans each would receive 
45% of the profits. The remaining 10% would go to a Puerto Rican banker 
instrumental in helping Radin raise money for the film. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, producer of "Chinatown" and "Marathon Man," appeared in court last week 
but refused to tell his version of events on grounds that his testimony might 
incriminate him. 
</P>
<P>
But Lawson said Radin and Greenberger argued bitterly over the deal. And for 
the first time in court, Lawson, a skittish, slightly built man who testified 
for two days before his breakdown, offered a detailed account of the events 
leading up to Radin's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Obsessed With Succeeding 
</P>
<P>
In his testimony and records filed with the court, the 275-pound Radin emerges 
as a slick and unsavory deal-maker who was obsessed with succeeding in 
Hollywood after producing a string of successful but unglamorous East Coast 
vaudeville-style shows. Greenberger is characterized as a woman who expected to 
make it big in the high-stakes movie production business by trading on her 
striking good looks, her drug connections and her forceful personality. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson said Radin and Greenberger's fateful encounter occurred Friday, May 13, 
when she demanded one last meeting on the "Cotton Club" contract. The former 
assistant said Greenberger made it clear that she expected a $50,000 finder's 
fee for introducing Radin and Evans. "There was also discussion of points and 
percentages in the production," Lawson testified. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dinner Arrangements 
</P>
<P>
Radin initially put her off, Lawson said, before they agreed to resolve their 
differences over dinner at La Scala in Beverly Hills. Radin arranged for 
Greenberger to meet him at his room at the Regency Plaza Suites Hotel on 
Hollywood Boulevard. Lawson implied that Radin feared being alone with 
Greenberger. He asked a close friend and associate, actor Demond Wilson of 
"Sanford and Son" fame, to wait outside the hotel with a gun and to 
surreptitiously follow them to the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson said the mood was friendly when Greenberger arrived at the hotel around 
8:30 p.m. But Lawson said Radin's carefully laid plans for the evening started 
unraveling when Greenberger insisted that they go to dinner in her limousine, 
rather than Radin's car. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lost in Traffic 
</P>
<P>
Lawson recalled that he nervously followed them downstairs and signaled for 
Wilson to trail the limousine as it pulled away from the curb. But another 
limousine pulled in behind the one carrying Greenberger and Radin, and Wilson 
lost them in traffic, according to Lawson. 
</P>
<P>
When he had not heard from Radin by 11 p.m., Lawson said he called La Scala, 
only to learn that Greenberger and Radin had not shown up. Then, when Radin 
still had not returned to the hotel by the next morning, Lawson said he called 
and left several messages for Greenberger. 
</P>
<P>
"I said in one of the messages that she had to call me within an hour or I was 
going to call the police," Lawson said. "I was going to blow the lid off the 
whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Report Filed 
</P>
<P>
Greenberger called back later that day, telling Lawson she and Radin had split 
up after arguing in the limousine. But a disbelieving Lawson eventually filed a 
missing-person report. 
</P>
<P>
Radin's decomposing corpse was discovered by a beekeeper a month later in a 
ditch. The case, however, remained open for five years because of a lack of 
evidence. The big break finally came when William Rider, a former supervisor of 
Flynt's bodyguards, told police that at least two of the men had admitted 
playing a role in Radin's murder. The suspects were arrested after police 
listened to conversations that Rider had secretly taped in which one of them, 
Lowe, said that the Radin "hit" had been financed by Greenberger and film 
producer Evans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plan Overheard 
</P>
<P>
Evans has denied this and Rider has yet to make an appearance in court. But 
Carl Plzak, another former Flynt bodyguard who was offered immunity, testified 
that he overheard the male defendants in the case making plans to "grab a fat 
pig and take him to the desert." 
</P>
<P>
In testimony that stretched over several days, the burly Plzak also said that 
Greenberger was present when bodyguard Mentzer later announced that Radin's 
body had been found. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me they had found the body of the producer they shot in the desert," 
Plzak said. Under further examination from Deputy Dist. Atty. Sally Thomas, 
Plzak then added: "She (Greenberger) was present when it was said. She was 
standing right next to us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legal Indiscretions 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to discredit Plzak, the defense attorneys asked if he had ever 
broken any laws. Among the legal indiscretions acknowledged by Plzak, who 
continually rubbed his eyes and sighed during his time on the witness stand, 
was the time he falsely reported that his car had been stolen. Plzak said the 
car had actually been taken to the desert and blown up by defendant Marti. When 
an attorney asked why, Plzak said: "He enjoyed blowing things up." 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary hearing is expected to last two more weeks.

LEGAL AIDE PLEADS GUILTY IN PROBE OF INSURANCE FRAUD 
</P>

<P>
A former office administrator for a Woodland Hills law firm pleaded guilty 
Friday to mail fraud and agreed to cooperate with federal authorities 
investigating a group of Los Angeles-area lawyers suspected of defrauding 
insurance companies of millions of dollars in legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen M. Monahan, 45, became the third target of the federal probe to agree 
to assist the government. She was accused of mailing an inflated bill from the 
office of attorney Alan Arnold to an insurance company in November, 1985. U.S. 
District Judge John Rhoades set an Aug. 21 sentencing date for Monahan, who 
pleaded guilty to a single count of mail fraud. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lawyers Investigated 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported last January that federal authorities are investigating at 
least a dozen lawyers from the San Fernando Valley, the Westside of Los Angeles 
and Beverly Hills who have appeared together repeatedly in cases in which 
insurers were obliged to pay their fees. 
</P>
<P>
Federal investigators and insurers contend that the lawyers conspired to 
prolong litigation and fatten their fees through various legal maneuvers, 
including filing spurious claims against each other's clients. Some of this 
litigation is still pending, including cases in San Diego, Orange and Los 
Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
According to the charge against Monahan, she was part of a scheme "to defraud 
the judicial systems of the United States and the state of California and 
numerous insurance companies." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Network of Attorneys' 
</P>
<P>
The fraud on the courts stemmed from the lawyers representing themselves as 
"independent attorneys, free from any conflict of interest," when in fact they 
were part of "a network of attorneys with interlocking financial and 
professional interests," according to the charge. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. George D. Hardy declined to say when more charges will be 
filed. He confirmed that Monahan's plea bargain, sealed by court order, 
requires her to assist the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Last February, Suzanne Rubin, former operator of a Reseda-based court reporting 
service, pleaded guilty to one mail fraud count and agreed to cooperate in the 
probe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agreed to Guilty Plea 
</P>
<P>
A third target, Studio City lawyer Marc I. Kent, has not been formally charged, 
but has agreed to plead guilty to two counts of mail fraud, Kent's lawyer and 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
No charges have been filed against the alleged mastermind of the scheme, 
attorney Lynn B. Stites, who divides his time between homes in Bell Canyon in 
Ventura County and Gstaad, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
In court papers, prosecutors have referred to Stites as "the organizing 
attorney," saying he had "a secret financial connection" with other lawyers in 
the group. Stites has refused interview requests.

IMMIGRANTS URGED TO TRY ONE MORE TIME FOR POLITICAL ASYLUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maria Ester Contreras, a 29-year-old immigrant who claims to have been tortured 
by the military in El Salvador, said she was furious when a U.S. immigration 
agent "laughed in my face and made fun of me" as she applied for political 
asylum. 
</P>
<P>
"The way they treated me was very bad," she said. "There was a total lack of 
respect." 
</P>
<P>
After her application was denied last year, she considered returning to El 
Salvador or perhaps living in Los Angeles as an illegal immigrant. But a 
federal judge's action gave new life to her asylum application. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Campaign Aimed at Immigrants 
</P>
<P>
Although Contreras has decided to seek political asylum a second time, 
representatives of the Central American Refugee Center and other immigrants' 
rights groups said they fear others may not. They announced a campaign Friday 
to encourage the immigrants to resubmit their applications and forget the "bad 
experiences" of their first interviews. 
</P>
<P>
"The message they've gotten is that they don't qualify for political asylum," 
said Linton Joaquin, an attorney with the refugee center. "It's important that 
they get the message that they can reapply." 
</P>
<P>
On May 15, U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. ordered a halt to 
deportation proceedings against Contreras and an estimated 23,000 other 
immigrants who had applied for asylum in Los Angeles in the last year. He also 
granted them the right to plead their case in a second interview. 
</P>
<P>
The action, effective over 90 days, was made in response to complaints from 
immigrants' rights groups that asylum applications by immigrants from war-torn 
Central America were being summarily denied by the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service after only cursory review. 
</P>
<P>
In a suit filed earlier this year, the National Center for Immigrants Rights 
alleged that immigrants applying for asylum had no access to interpreters 
during their interviews with INS officials. The suit further alleged that many 
interviews were conducted in only a few minutes, without giving the applicants 
any meaningful chance to argue that they faced persecution in their homelands. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Counseling Available 
</P>
<P>
Joaquin said the refugee center and other groups, including El Rescate and the 
Immigrants Rights Organization, will open their offices to counsel the 
immigrants about their rights in the wake of the judge's decision. Political 
asylum applicants have the right to bring witnesses to their interviews, to 
present documents supporting their cases and to request work permits, Joaquin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The judge's order affects those who have applied for asylum in Los Angeles 
since June, 1988, when INS officials created a task force in Los Angeles to 
deal with thousands of "frivolous" applications for asylum. The immigration 
officials argued that the applications were filed by immigrants who were 
fleeing their countries not because they were politically persecuted but 
because they sought to escape poverty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Interview Procedures 
</P>
<P>
Officials have denied that the task force processed the immigrants' 
applications unfairly. But at the judge's request, they submitted a plan 
earlier this month to change how asylum interviews are conducted. 
</P>
<P>
Pilar Luna, assistant regional counsel for the INS, said the plan includes 
provisions for a "permanent cadre of trained asylum examiners" and the 
preparation of a new procedures manual for officials who conduct the 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the new procedures, Contreras is still pessimistic about her chances. 
She said she was targeted for persecution in El Salvador apparently because of 
her brother's activities at a university in eastern El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not very hopeful, but I have to keep on fighting," she said. "I can't go 
back to my country. There's a war going on there."

FUNERAL HELD FOR LITTLE REFUGEE WHO FOUND DEATH INSTEAD OF FAMILY

<P>
When 8-year-old Alva Azusena Flores left war-torn El Salvador and came to the 
United States in August, she was in search of a family. 
</P>
<P>
Her father, a soldier in the Salvadoran army, was killed by guerrillas in 1981 
when she was a month old. The same year, her mother left Alva in the care of a 
grandmother and headed north to start a new life in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
On May 11, nine months after she arrived here to live with her mother, Alva's 
sexually abused, battered and burned body was discovered in a San Pedro park. 
Six days later, Alva's mother, Natividad Flores, 26, and her live-in boyfriend, 
Alejandro Lara, 29, of Mexico, were charged with murder in connection with the 
girl's death. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a modest Spanish-language funeral service was held for Alva at 
Ascension Catholic Church in Los Angeles. Her burial was paid for by officials 
of the Los Angeles City Attorney Victim Witness Assistance Program -- friends 
she never met in life. 
</P>
<P>
Among the two dozen neighbors and sympathizers who attended the funeral service 
was Alva's aunt, Theresa Flores, who wept through a sermon by Father Ed 
Sattinger on the mystery of life and death. 
</P>
<P>
"A seed must fall to the ground and die before it can bear fruit," Sattinger 
said, standing beside Alva's small, gray, wooden casket. "So too, we must die 
at our appointed hour in order to be raised again in his glory." 
</P>
<P>
An hour later, the little girl who came from the small agricultural coastal 
village of Usulutan, El Salvador, was buried at Holy Cross Catholic Cemetery in 
Culver City. There, Sattinger closed a prayer service by pressing a small metal 
cross into Theresa Flores' trembling palm. 
</P>
<P>
Gregoria Zapata was one of the sympathizers from her neighborhood south of 
downtown who came to lay bouquets from their own gardens on the tiny casket. 
</P>
<P>
"This is horrible," said Zapata, wiping tears from her eyes as she led her four 
children to the grave on a grassy knoll in a section of cemetery called Holy 
Innocents. "I watch my children much more closely now." 
</P>
<P>
Police investigators believe that Alva was never accepted by her new family, 
which included a 7-year-old sister and a 3-year-old brother born and reared in 
this country. Instead, she was treated as an outcast, shunned, screamed at and 
beaten almost daily, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors could recall only glimpses of the shy, slender girl who was kept out 
of school and rarely allowed outdoors. Sitting alone on the front porch steps 
of a modest triplex bungalow, her sullen expression drew no response but pity. 
</P>
<P>
"She had a such a pretty little face," recalled next-door neighbor Anjela 
Madero, 63. "But they hit her a lot." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'She Looked Sad' 
</P>
<P>
"I saw her once on the front porch steps," said neighbor Olivia Uribe, 19. "She 
looked sad, like she was scared." 
</P>
<P>
Flores and Lara, who operated a lunch truck business, were arrested largely on 
the basis of conflicting statements they made to police investigators, evidence 
collected at the park and at their home and preliminary autopsy results, 
authorities said. The two are being held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
Police investigators said information suggests that Alva was the victim of 
prolonged sexual and physical abuse that ended between 10 p.m. and midnight May 
10. That night, police believe she was beaten and strangled in the bathroom as 
her little sister, Silvana, stood nearby, said Los Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Ryan Rainey. 
</P>
<P>
Silvana and her little brother have been placed in protective custody, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"Both parents participated equally in the murder," Rainey said. "There were 
repeated blows to different parts of her body. Death was due to strangulation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doused With Gasoline 
</P>
<P>
A third person, Lara's 25-year-old brother, Martin Lopez, has been charged with 
assisting the couple by dousing Alva's body with gasoline as part of an attempt 
to cover up her identity, Rainey said. 
</P>
<P>
Flores, Lara and Lopez have pleaded not guilty to all the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Ben Gonzalez, officer in charge of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Child Abuse Unit, cited statistics showing a disturbing increase 
in child abuse in Los Angeles over the last year. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez said there were 4,921 reported incidents of child abuse committed by 
parents or guardians in 1988. By comparison, there were 4,260 such cases 
reported the year before. Responding to the increase, the Police Department has 
added five officers to the unit, for a total of 28. 
</P>
<P>
"Each child abuse case reported is a tragedy, if not to the family, to society 
in general," Gonzalez said.

POLLSTER FINDS 'POSITIVE FEELINGS' ABOUT THE BIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Americans have very "positive feelings" about the Bible, says a Glendale 
pollster whose national survey of adults this month showed that 73% agreed with 
the statement that "it is important for people to read the Bible." 
</P>
<P>
Six of 10 people interviewed by phone also agreed either strongly or moderately 
that the Bible "is the written word of God, and is totally accurate in all that 
it teaches," according to George Barna, president of the Barna Research Group. 
</P>
<P>
However, 57% of the respondents -- out of a representative sample of 602 adults 
-- admitted that they do not read it except at church services. That figure was 
slightly higher than the response to the same question from a similar survey in 
1987, Barna said. The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 4%. 
</P>
<P>
Only 10% believed that the Bible was "out of date," but 31% said that the Bible 
was "too difficult to understand" -- regardless of whether they were speaking 
of the 17th-Century King James Bible or other translations. Even among regular 
Bible readers, 24% said it was difficult to understand. 
</P>
<P>
"Until people see the Bible as a practical guidebook for their everyday 
existence, it will probably continue to remain on the shelf next to 'The 
Complete Works of William Shakespeare' and 'War and Peace,' " Barna said in 
announcing the results. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing wrong with people using it as a reference work," Barna said 
in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally come from a conservative Protestant philosophy that suggests part 
of our . . . relationship with God is knowing the Word," he said, adding that 
he questions whether one who occasionally reads the Bible could have "a growing 
relationship with God." JOHN DART

JEWISH-CATHOLIC RELATIONS SOURED; 
</P>
<P>
FEELINGS RUN HIGH ON NUNS AT AUSCHWITZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

OSWIECIM, Poland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nuns praying silently for the 4 million dead of Auschwitz have provoked a 
dispute that is souring relations between world Jewry and the Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish leaders outside Poland demand the removal of the small group of 
Carmelite nuns from a convent they established in 1984 in a warehouse attached 
to the former Nazi death camp. 
</P>
<P>
The Nazis are believed to have used the building beside the camp's outer walls 
to store the Zyklon-B gas, which killed at least 1 million Jews at Auschwitz. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Site Called Unique 
</P>
<P>
Jewish leaders say that by settling at Auschwitz the nuns have usurped a site 
unique in Jewish history, the most symbolic of all monuments to the Holocaust, 
in which a total of about 6 million Jews died. 
</P>
<P>
The church agreed in 1986 to move the nuns by last February, but work has not 
begun on a new convent planned to house them a few hundred yards away. 
</P>
<P>
A Jewish group canceled a meeting in Rome with Polish-born Pope John Paul II 
this month and demanded an "effective reply to tragic misunderstandings" over 
the convent. 
</P>
<P>
Father Stanislaw Musial, a Polish Jesuit priest who took part in negotiations 
on the dispute, said, "Our Jewish friends can be sure the convent will be 
transferred. It must happen soon because the issue could generate anti-Semitism 
in Poland." 
</P>
<P>
But Musial said work on the new convent could not start for months because land 
to build it on has not been bought. 
</P>
<P>
"The nuns must have a stable place to go to. They can't go from one temporary 
place to another. We can't just play with the nuns as if they were Ping-Pong 
balls," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Many Poles want the nuns to stay on in the building, known as "the old 
theater," arguing that it is outside the camp walls and that they pray for Jews 
and Catholic victims alike. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish leaders want Auschwitz to remain almost as it was when it was liberated 
in 1945, a unique symbol of the Holocaust and a silent tribute to millions of 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
They say that although the convent building is outside the camp walls, it was 
part of the camp because it was used to store the lethal gas. They are outraged 
by the wooden cross erected by the nuns just outside the camp wall near Block 
11 -- the "Death Block" in whose courtyard 20,000 people were shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a 23-foot high cross standing on the largest Jewish graveyard in 
history," said a spokesman for the World Jewish Congress in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The nuns, who belong to one of the strictest contemplative orders of the 
church, do not receive visitors and have made no comment. 
</P>
<P>
Local feelings are running high, and residents angered at criticism of the nuns 
sent a protest last month signed by 1,375 people to Slowo Powszechne, a 
pro-government Catholic newspaper in Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
Musial said there were no intentions to mislead the Jews and called for calm. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no plan to deceive the Jews. The Polish authorities are doing their 
best to carry out the decision (to build a new convent), but everything takes 
time," he said.

TIJUANA RACES TO REPAIR ITS AQUEDUCT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

A ruptured aqueduct that had threatened water supplies to this city of more 
than a million residents should be repaired by early today and a reduced flow 
should be reaching the city hours later, authorities said Friday. A hookup with 
San Diego, across the U.S.-Mexican border, was helping fill the void. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still an emergency situation, but the level of concern has been reduced 
considerably," said Miguel Ravelo, a spokesman for the state Public Service 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
However, Ravelo said that water supplies were not expected to return to normal 
until late Tuesday -- after the Memorial Day weekend, a major time for tourism 
here -- as the newly repaired aqueduct will have to be tested, filled, 
pressurized and sanitized. In the meantime, the city will continue to depend in 
part on other sources, including an emergency tie-in with San Diego water 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
Despite emergency declarations, officials said drinking-water supplies were 
never threatened, as most residents here, as in much of Mexico, rely heavily on 
bottled drinking water purchased from private distributors. The water from the 
aqueduct, although nominally purified, is used largely for non-drinking uses, 
such as washing and sewage flow. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Complaints 
</P>
<P>
Residents here, accustomed to breakdowns in the system, seem to take the lack 
of water with relatively few complaints. There was little evidence of panic or 
long lines at private water suppliers, although commercial sales of water were 
brisk. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in this city of about 1.5 million residents, wary of losing tourist 
income, have been downplaying the potential impact of the water shortage on 
visitors, noting that many hotels and restaurants have their own holding tanks 
with reserve capacity, or have the option of purchasing water. Tens of 
thousands of Americans and other tourists traditionally head for Tijuana and 
points south during the Memorial Day holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency began Wednesday morning, when an underground section of the giant 
aqueduct -- about six feet in diameter -- ruptured and began spilling water, 
prompting an eventual shutdown of the system. The aqueduct, which carries water 
from the Colorado River, supplies more than 90% of the city's non-drinking 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers from Mexico and the United States have been working non-stop to fix 
the breakage, and it is anticipated that the metal-reinforced concrete pipe 
will be completely repaired by about 3 a.m. Saturday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities called for conservation and opened a number of wells and several 
dozen state-owned trucks began distributing water, free of charge, to some of 
the hardest-hit neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, officials on both sides of the border arranged to reopen a hookup 
with the San Diego water system, which has been sending Tijuana as much as 13 
million gallons a day -- less than a third of that city's average daily 
consumption but still a significant flow. 
</P>
<P>
The trans-border hookup had previously been used to transport water to Tijuana, 
but was abandoned a decade ago when Mexican officials completed construction of 
a supply line from the Colorado River. The hookup will continue as long as 
needed, a San Diego official said. 
</P>
<P>
The water-sharing caused San Diego officials to call for residents to adopt 
voluntary conservation measures, such as limiting watering and vehicle washing.

CALIFORNIA ASSESSMENT TEST SCORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOW TO READ THE SCORES 
</P>
<P>
Districts are in boldface; individual schools are in light face. Two years of 
test results are given. The first line of numbers contains 1988-89 test 
results, while he second line refers to 1987-88 results. Scores for magnet 
programs, continuation schools and other schools with small enrollments have 
been omited. 
</P>
<P>
The scores are reported on a scale from 100 to about 400. The average scores 
statewide in 198-89 was 248 in reading and 256 in math. 
</P>
<P>
The "rank" that follows each score allows comparison to all other districts or 
schools statewide. All schools and districts are ranked on a scale of 1 to 99 
with a median rank of 50. Thus, for example, the Los Angeles County High School 
for the Arts has a rank of 98 in reading and 78 in math, which means it scored 
considerably higher than other high schools in the state in both areas. 
</P>
<P>
"SES" is a measure of a school's or a district's socioeconomic status. It is 
based on student reports of parents' education level. Each school and district 
is assigned a number ranging from 1 to 5, with 1 indicting parents who did not 
complete high school and 5 indicating those with advanced degrees. A 3 would 
mean that most parents in the school or district attended some college. 
</P>
<P>
"% LEP" is the percentage of students who are limited-English proficient, which 
means they are not native English speakers and are not yet fluent in English. 
The average California school has 6.3% LEP students. 
</P>
<P>
In some districts in which only one school is listed, the district and school 
averages may be different. The reason is that the district average included the 
scores of a large number of continuation school students. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SAMPLE READING QUESTIONS 
</P>
<P>
 Read the following autobiographical selection by Ernesto Galarza, and then 
answer the questions that follow it. You may look back at the passage as you 
answer the questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyhood in a Sacramento Barrio 
</P>
<P>
Our family conversations always occurred on our own kitchen porch, away from 
the gringos. One or the other of the adults would begin: Se han fijado? Had we 
noticed -- that the Americans do not ask permission to leave the room; that 
they had no permission to leave the room; that they had no respectful way of 
addressing the elderly person; that they spit brown over the railing of the 
porch into the yard; that when they laughed they roared; that they never 
brought saludos to everyone in your family from everyone in their family when 
they visited; that General Delibree was only a clerk; that zopilotes were not 
allowed on the streets to collect garbage; that the policemen did not carry 
lanterns at night; that Americans didn't keep their feet on the floor when they 
were sitting; that there was a special automobile for going to jail; that a 
rancho was not a rancho at all but a very small hacienda; that the saloons 
served their customers free eggs, pickles, and sandwiches; that instead of 
bullfighting, the gringos for sport tried to kill each other with gloves? 
</P>
<P>
I did not have nearly the strong feelings on these matters that Dona Henriqueta 
expressed. I felt a vague admiration for the way Mr. Brien could spit brown. 
Wayne, my classmate, laughed much better than the Mexicans, because he opened 
his big mouth wide and brayed like a donkey so he could be heard a block away. 
But it was the kind of laughter that made my mother tremble, and it was not 
permitted in our house. 
</P>
<P>
Rules were laid down to keep me, as far as possible, un muchacho bien educado. 
If I had to spit, I was to do it privately, or if in public, by the curb, with 
my head down and my back to people. I was never to wear my cap in the house and 
I was to take it off even on the porch if ladies or elderly gentlemen were 
sitting. If I wanted to scratch, under no circumstances was I to do it right 
then and there, in company, like the Americans, but I was to excuse myself. If 
Catfish or Russell yelled to me from across the street, I was not to shout 
back. I was never to ask for tips for my errands or other services to the 
tenants of 418L, for these were atenciones expected of me. 
</P>
<P>
Above all I was never to fail in respeto to grownups, no matter who they were. 
It was an inflexible rule; I addressed myself to Senor Big Singh, Senor Big 
Ernie, Senora Dodson, Senor Choree Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
We could have hung on the door of our apartment a sign like those we read in 
some store windows -- Aqui se habla Espanol. We not only spoke Spanish, we read 
it. From the Libreria Espanola, two blocks up the street, Gustavo and I brought 
novels for my mother, like Genoveva de Brabante, a paperback with the poems of 
Amado Nervo and a handbook of the history of Mexico. The novels were never read 
aloud; the poems and the handbook were. Nervo was the famous poet from Tepic, 
close enough to Jalcocotan to make him our own. And in the history book I 
learned to read for myself, after many repetitions by my mother, about the 
deeds of the great Mexicans Don Salvador had recited so vividly to the class in 
Mazatlan. She refused to decide for me whether Abraham Lincoln was as great as 
Benito Juarez, or George Washington braver than the priest Don Miguel Hidalgo. 
At school there was no opportunity to settle these questions because nobody 
seemed to know about Juarez or Hidalgo; at least they were never mentioned and 
there were no pictures of them on the walls.

<P>
KOREAN COMMUNITY LEADER NAMED TO PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ho Young Chung, 55, has been named to the Orange County Human Relations 
Commission by the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Chung, who owns an insurance agency in Buena Park, was appointed to a 2-year 
term to fill an at-large position. 
</P>
<P>
He is a founding member and former president of the Korean Chamber of Commerce 
of Orange County and of the Korean-American Lions Club. 
</P>
<P>
He has served as chairman of the Korean/American Assn. of Orange County and of 
the Koreatown Garden Grove Police Support Committee, and as vice chairman of 
the Orange County Minority Business Council. He was president of Korea Expo 
Inc., held in 1984 at the Anaheim Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
Chung graduated in 1958 from Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Korea with 
a degree in English. He received a master's degree in political science from 
Korea University in 1961 and a master of business administration from James 
Madison University in Virginia in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
The Human Relations Commission was created in 1971 to try to eliminate 
discrimination against any individual or group in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Six of the commission's 11 members are appointed by the Board of Supervisors, 
and five by the Orange County Division of the League of California Cities. 
</P>
<P>
Chung said he hopes to develop leadership within ethnic communities and to 
promote positive interaction between minority and majority populations. In 
particular, he proposed forming a multiracial group whose aim would be to help 
prevent crime by providing interpreters and other support services to local 
police.

PEOPLE: BUG-BUSTER HELPS MAKE COUNTY A SAFER PLACE TO PUT DOWN ROOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TYLER L. CHIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
J. Nicholas Nisson's job doesn't bug him. His job is bugs. 
</P>
<P>
As the only entomologist employed by the county agriculture commissioner's 
office, Nisson helps to detect insects that hitchhike on goods brought into the 
county from other states and countries and threaten crops. 
</P>
<P>
I "wouldn't trade it for anything," said Nisson, whose constant task is to 
preserve crops worth millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
One of the nastiest and most dangerous critters Nisson has helped to battle is 
a little brown beetle from Australia named the eucalyptus longhorn borer. First 
discovered in the United States in 1984 at an El Toro eucalyptus grove, the 
inch-long beetle has killed thousands of eucalyptus trees since then. 
</P>
<P>
By the time of its discovery, the beetle already was established in the county 
and probably had been for several years, Nisson said. It was too late to 
eradicate them, and the county's efforts then -- as now -- were limited to 
controlling or reducing their population, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The beetle is now part of the county's insect fauna and continues to affect 
eucalyptus trees that are old or weak, Nisson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Those types of insects are exotic pests. . . . They are the weeds of the 
insect world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Nisson, 32, doesn't want to perpetuate any prejudices against bugs in 
general. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is that the vast majority of insects are not considered pests," he 
said. "They're just another form of animal life. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because you see a bee fly in the yard, doesn't mean you have to get 
upset," he said. "Most insects you can live and get along with just fine." 
</P>
<P>
Even his wife "is becoming more and more tolerant" of insects. "I have 
enlightened her," he says jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people are ignorant of the insects in their back yard, and that is 
unfortunate," Nisson said. He also bemoans the fact that most people view bugs 
"as nothing more than insects and something repulsive to them." 
</P>
<P>
Nisson said his interest in insects began when he was a child and his parents 
owned an orange orchard in Tustin. He studied biology at Cal State Fullerton, 
receiving undergraduate and master's degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The fun of entomology, he said, is that the scientist is always discovering. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the years, (insects) have been a frontier in biology," he said. "There 
are so many of them that, as an entomologist, I will never see it all. There 
will always be something new." 
</P>
<P>
People columnist Herbert J. Vida is on vacation.

MARINES ARE SEEKING MISSING EXPLOSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station are looking for an explosive 
cartridge that fell from an aircraft Friday during a routine training flight. 
</P>
<P>
The cartridge, described as a silver cylinder about 1 inch long and 1 inch 
wide, has an explosive power similar to that of a blasting cap, according to a 
statement from the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
The cartridge is related to fireworks and other pyrotechnic devices, the 
statement said. Unlike a blasting cap, however, this cartridge would require a 
special electric charge to be detonated. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone finding the cartridge should call police and not try to move the device. 
The flight path of the aircraft was over mostly unpopulated areas of eastern 
and southern Orange County, northern San Diego County and Riverside County, the 
statement said.

A SCHOOL REMEMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Ana High School paid a pre-Memorial Day tribute Friday to its alumni who 
havegone on to serve in the U.S. armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
"It is with great honor that we respect and recognize the great contributions 
our students have made over the past 100 years," Andrew Hernandez, the school's 
principal, said before about 60 guests. 
</P>
<P>
Unveiled were two plaques honoring Santa Ana High students who fought in 
Vietnam and Korea. Former students who fought in one of America's four wars in 
this century were also honored. They included Fred Rosenbaum, a 92-year-old 
veteran of World War I, who attended the school from 1913 to 1915. 
</P>
<P>
Marine Corps Brig. Gen. David V. Shuter, commanding general of the El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station, was the keynote speaker at the 45-minute program. 
Shuter said that while Memorial Day means "barbecues, hot dogs, ballgames and . 
. . the Indy 500" for some people, "many civilians, and we in the military, 
demand that the sacrifices made, in war or in peacetime, are not made in vain." 
</P>
<P>
By holding the tribute, Shuter said, Santa Ana High was "refusing to allow 
their contribution to be dimmed by history." 
</P>
<P>
Five students who were either members of the school band or the Navy Junior 
ROTC unit -- including one student who fainted -- required treatment after 
standing in the sun during the program. None was seriously hurt, a school 
administrator said.

SUSPECT WHO WAS SHOT BY POLICE IS IDENTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE EMMONS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man shot dead by a Santa Ana motorcycle officer as he reportedly tried to 
evade arrest was identified by a police spokesman Friday as Paul Castro, 20, of 
Santa Ana. Police had been seeking Castro as a suspect in at least two armed 
robberies. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said police "had been looking for him pretty heavily" for at 
least 2 weeks when officers received a tip early Thursday evening that Castro 
was at an address in the 2000 block of West Civic Center Drive. Four uniformed 
officers were sent to the address, the spokesman said, and when Castro saw them 
pull up, he began to run and reach toward his waist. One officer fired twice, 
hitting Castro once in the back, police said. A knife was found on the body, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
During the search for Castro, police were advised that "he was armed and 
dangerous," Lt. Robert Chavez said, because tipsters had told officers that he 
carried weapons and that he would resist arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez said that the robberies Castro was believed to have committed involved 
threats with knives, small-caliber handguns and sawed-off shotguns. A warrant 
issued for Castro stated that he was suspected of armed robbery, assault with a 
deadly weapon, resisting arrest, auto theft, receiving stolen property and 
hit-and-run driving. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez said that, as is usual in the Police Department when an officer is 
involved in a shooting, the officer who shot Castro is on a 3-day paid leave 
during which he will be offered psychological counseling. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez declined to identify the officer or to say whether that officer has been 
involved in other shootings. 
</P>
<P>
An investigation into the shooting is continuing.

$45-MILLION COSTA MESA CENTER OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Costa Mesa City Council this week approved a plan to build a $45-million 
shopping and entertainment center downtown, despite the protests of several 
small-business owners who must move. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4 to 1 for the Mediterranean-style Triangle Square complex at 
Harbor and Newport boulevards. The council also voted to condemn the properties 
of at least 13 small businesses on the 4.5-acre site to make room for the 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Sandra L. Genis, the only member to vote against condemning the 
properties, argued that the small businesses are needed and should not be razed 
to benefit the city. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the business owners said the purchase and relocation offers made by 
Triangle Square Associates, co-developer of the project, were inadequate. 
Others argued that, after investing thousands of dollars in their businesses, 
they should not have to uproot themselves for an upscale shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the nicest stores we have, and I don't know where we would move 
and pay the rents we are paying now," said Mic Mead, owner of the six-store 
Adventure 16 Outdoor chain, whose Costa Mesa store is on Harbor Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said, however, that the new complex will improve the appearance 
of the city's downtown redevelopment area and compared the project to San 
Francisco's Ghirardelli Square. 
</P>
<P>
Officials also said the Triangle Square project will generate about $1 million 
in taxes annually. 
</P>
<P>
The 185,000-square-foot project will include two aboveground levels of shops 
and restaurants and a subterranean level that will include a supermarket. Also 
included in the plan is a 2,200-seat, eight-screen Cineplex-Odeon movie 
theater, the first in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that Triangle Square is the most significant and innovative retail 
development to be announced in Orange County this year," said Jerry Klein, a 
spokesman for Triangle Square Associates. 
</P>
<P>
Klein said he expects demolition to begin as early as this fall, with the 
complex completed by early 1991.

GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI: RAMS WON'T RUSH TO MEET BELL'S DEMANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gene Wojciechowski 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Memo to Ram running back Greg Bell: 
</P>
<P>
Purchase a roll of duct tape. Snip off a generous supply of said tape. Apply 
tape to mouth. Keep it there. Forever. 
</P>
<P>
Voila! -- a career saved. 
</P>
<P>
Bell, you see, has this itsy-bitsy problem, mainly, he thinks free enterprise 
is alive and well in the National Football League. He thinks if you finish 
fourth in the league in rushing, as Bell did last season, finish first in 
touchdowns, first in points scored, average more than four yards per carry and 
catch 24 passes, that you're entitled to a hefty raise. He thinks the Rams 
should place him among the league's elite runners -- just behind Eric 
Dickerson, Herschel Walker and Roger Craig -- and pay him accordingly. He also 
thinks the Rams are losing sleep over his recently declared contract holdout. 
</P>
<P>
Follow-up memo to Bell: 
</P>
<P>
Wake up and smell the unemployment line. The Rams could care less about your 
no-show status. Lose sleep? Not a wink's worth. 
</P>
<P>
As for free enterprise and fair market value . . . save it for your master's 
thesis, Greg. The next time Ram management will push for fair market value is 
the day Georgia Frontiere decides to sell the franchise. Until then, they've 
got you. 
</P>
<P>
You say you rushed for 1,212 yards in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams say they've got Gaston Green, the No. 1 choice that year, primed and 
ready for a 1,000-plus season. 
</P>
<P>
You say you've seen your share of college phenoms come and go. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams say that even if Green gags, they've still got a proven runner in 
Robert Delpino and another No. 1 choice, Cleveland Gary, waiting in the wings. 
</P>
<P>
You say the Rams should be more like the Raiders and not settle for second 
best. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams say the Raiders have missed the playoffs each of the past three 
seasons and have a 20-27 record to show for the Al Davis philosophy. Meanwhile, 
the Rams have advanced to the playoffs two of the past three years and own a 
26-21 record. 
</P>
<P>
You say you're worth about $950,000 per year, but you'll settle for 
blue-light-special numbers: about $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams say they'll give you a two-year deal that includes an annual salary of 
$400,000 and another $150,000 per season in incentive clauses. And that's only 
because they're in a good mood. 
</P>
<P>
Back and forth it goes. Point, counterpoint. But this much is known: Bell won't 
-- can't -- win this untimely battle against the Rams. He's fighting management 
with a rubber knife and a cap gun. The Rams have an arsenal that includes 
arrogance, draft choices galore, time and history. 
</P>
<P>
So what does Bell do? He barks into a stiff wind. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rams will consistently win 10, 11 games a season," Bell recently told The 
Times' Chris Dufresne. "But will you hear from them? For many years, the Rams 
have been eating half the pie. It takes a whole pie to fill you up." 
</P>
<P>
And only the slightest bit of indigestion to make the Rams burp Bell from their 
season plans. 
</P>
<P>
Bell, no matter how much the Rams downplayed his accomplishments in 1988, had a 
wonderful year. He gained those 1,212 yards despite getting 10 carries or less 
in three of the Rams' 16 regular-season games. He played hurt -- sort of a 
first for Bell. And when Coach John Robinson kept him on the bench at times, in 
favor of Charles White, Bell kept his mouth shut, perhaps the most remarkable 
achievement of all. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what?" he said at the time. "I try not to analyze the situation. If 
you get yourself in that situation, you probably do yourself more harm because 
you're frustrated when you're not getting in, or you're not doing the things 
that you want to do. I'll just leave the controversy alone and do what I do 
best, and that's to be prepared to play." 
</P>
<P>
Too bad he forgot his own best advice when determining his salary strategy for 
1989. Rather than walk softly, Bell talked loudly. And for publication, too, 
which is great for readers but lousy for building bridges of understanding with 
the people who sign his paycheck. The Rams were plenty steamed about Bell's 
comments, enough so that Robinson summoned the running back to the Rams Park 
offices recently for a closed-door lecture session. Bell reportedly left the 
meeting with powder burns on his ears. 
</P>
<P>
As a five-year veteran, Bell should know by now that the NFL is a strange place 
to earn a living. The laws of supply and demand are often suspended. 
Twenty-eight general managers control the fate of almost 1,000 players. League 
rules are such that players rarely can determine their own futures. Now add the 
peculiar idiosyncrasies of a team such as the Rams and you can better 
understand Bell's problem. 
</P>
<P>
Bell wants more money. Lots. The Rams, dealing from a position of power and 
experience, have said no. This leaves Bell with two choices: compromise or 
pout. 
</P>
<P>
Bell pouted and now might be on the verge of disappearing from the Ram active 
roster. He is the holdout that no one in Ram management seems to care much 
about. Truth is, the Rams didn't particularly want him in the first place; they 
took him off Buffalo's hands only after the Bills promised to pay part of his 
salary. And never once during the 1988 season did Robinson do cartwheels over 
Bell's touchdown parade. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams aren't hurting for running backs. Even if they were, history has 
taught us that the regime of Ram vice president John Shaw doesn't take kindly 
to blustery demands. Dickerson held his breath until his goggles fogged up, but 
it didn't get him a raise from the Rams. It did, however, get him sent to 
another team, which is Plan B, according to Bell. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with all this is that Bell isn't Dickerson. Not even close. Nor are 
the circumstances similar. Back then, Dickerson could claim he was the entire 
Ram offense. Bell can't even claim to be the opening-game starting halfback. 
</P>
<P>
Wide receiver Henry Ellard tried a contract holdout in 1986; it didn't work. 
Receiver Ron Brown announced his "retirement" after a negotiating stalemate 
with the Rams last year. He begged back later that season after an unsuccessful 
try at the U.S. Olympic track team. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike Brown, Bell can't run track. All he can do is bluff with five of the 
lousiest cards you've ever seen.

KENNEDY PROVES ITSELF TO NO. 1 LAGUNA HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kennedy High School, the patsy of the Empire League just three years ago, is 
getting plenty of respect these days. Friday, the Fighting Irish scored a 7-2 
victory over Laguna Hills in the quarterfinals of the Southern Section 3-A 
division in La Palma. 
</P>
<P>
The victory over the county's top-ranked team moved Kennedy (23-5) into the 
semifinals on Tuesday against Tustin (21-8) at a site to be determined today. 
Laguna Hills, which had won 21 of its past 22 games, ended the season at 24-5. 
</P>
<P>
Few could appreciate Kennedy's turnaround more than winning pitcher Greg 
Hansell, who allowed only four hits and struck out 10 to improve his record to 
12-1. Hansell also hit his second home run of the season and scored twice. 
</P>
<P>
Hansell has been a varsity member since he was a freshman and has grown with a 
program that struggled to win a total of nine games in 1986 and 1987. By 
qualifying for the semifinals, Kennedy has advanced farther than any other team 
in the school's 25-year history. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were freshmen, we knew someday we would get our chance," Hansell said. 
"It was really nice to get this win against Laguna Hills since they eliminated 
us last year. This team is like a train that's picking up speed." 
</P>
<P>
Hansell helped Kennedy get off to its third quick start in three playoff games 
by hitting a homer over the left-field fence in the second inning as Kennedy 
took a 2-0 lead. It marked the third consecutive playoff game in which Kennedy 
has opened with a two-run lead. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Scott Wood's two-run double staked Kennedy to a 4-0 lead in the third 
inning, and that was more than enough for Hansell, who dominated one of the 
county's best-hitting teams. Hansell benefited from double plays in the first 
two innings, then got stronger as the game progressed, striking out seven of 
the last nine batters he retired. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills avoided its second shutout when it scored two unearned runs in the 
sixth inning. The Hawks' three top hitters -- center fielder Chris Sheff, first 
baseman Rob Milo and catcher Mike Helm -- struggled against Hansell. Helm 
managed the only hit between the three, an infield single in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
"To shut down Sheff, Milo and Helm is quite an accomplishment," said Chris 
Pascal, Kennedy's coach. "They got a little frustrated and then started looking 
at a lot of strikes." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills hitters were caught looking at a third strike six times, a feat 
that Jack Hodges, Laguna Hills coach, credited to Hansell's mastery. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the best pitcher we've faced this year," Hodges said. "The 10 strikeouts 
was the highest total against us this year. As a hitter, you can't adjust when 
a guy's on like he was today. You just try to be as aggressive as possible and 
hope to make contact." 
</P>
<P>
Hodges led Laguna Hills to the 2-A division title in 1984 and compared Kennedy 
to his championship team. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very capable of winning the whole thing," Hodges said. "They've got 
good pitching and two or three guys in the lineup who can hurt you."

El Dorado High School's defense saved the game and its offense won it Friday 
when the Golden Hawks defeated Mater Dei, 4-2, in eight innings in a Southern 
Section 5-A baseball playoff game at Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
The save came from right-fielder Greg Fife, who made a running catch with the 
winning run on second to end the seventh and force extra innings. Given another 
chance, El Dorado scored two runs off Tony Pena, one of the best pitchers in 
Orange County, to win. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Nevin led off the eighth with a single up the middle. Bruce Petillo 
singled to right and Matt Luke singled home Nevin from second to put El Dorado 
ahead, 3-2. Fife added a sacrifice fly one out later. 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado reliever Jay Hassel (4-1) walked Rob Ickes to start the eighth, but 
retired the next three batters, two on strikeouts. Pena, who relieved starter 
Scott Corliss in the fourth, got the loss. Pena, who will be attending Arizona 
State on baseball scholarship in the fall, ends the season with a 12-2 record. 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado led, 2-1, going into the seventh when Lionel Hastings was walked by 
El Dorado starter Pete Janicki. Two outs later, Janicki walked No. 9 hitter 
Juan Zarate. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Carl followed with a single to center to drive in Hastings with the tying 
run. Janicki then was replaced by Hassel, who faced Jason Gill. 
</P>
<P>
Gill drove what looked like the game-winning hit down the right-field line, but 
Fife raced back and caught the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"The season was maybe a foot away from being over on that ball hit to right 
field," El Dorado Coach Steve Gullotti said. "I thought it was going to be a 
base hit." 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei Coach Bob Ickes also thought the game was about to end when Gill hit 
the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought the ball was over his (Nevin's) head," Ickes said. "I thought we 
were about to pull off another miracle. That was the big play of the game, 
there's no question." 
</P>
<P>
It was the ninth consecutive victory for El Dorado (21-8), which entered the 
playoffs as the second-place team out of the Empire League. El Dorado plays 
top-seeded Lakewood (25-3) in a semifinal game Tuesday at Blair Field in Long 
Beach. Lakewood defeated Fontana, 4-0, Friday. 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado opened a 2-0 lead, scoring single runs in the fourth and fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Moore struck out but reached on wild pitch to start the fourth. He later 
scored on a single by Luke, who had two hits and two RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Crosby Spencer singled to open the fifth and moved to second on a wild pick-off 
throw by Pena. He went to third on a sacrifice bunt by Dave Swearingen and 
scored on a sacrifice fly by Wayne Hefft. . 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei scored in the sixth on a double by Carl. He went to third on a passed 
ball and scored on a sacrifice fly by Gill. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei, the Angelus League champions and the fourth-seeded team, finishes 
the season 22-6.

SLOW-PITCHER, FAST-PITCHER ROUTINE DEFEATS ESTANCIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saugus High School Coach Doug Worley did his homework. 
</P>
<P>
Estancia, Saugus' opponent Friday, had reached the quarterfinals of the 
Southern Section 3-A baseball playoffs by virtue of late-inning rallies. Twice 
the Eagles trailed entering the sixth inning and both times they came back to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
So Worley aligned his pitching plan accordingly. Scott Warr, a left-handed 
off-speed pitcher, started and left after four innings with a two-run lead. 
Then came the heat, Roger Salkeld, whose fastball has been clocked in 90s. 
</P>
<P>
Salkeld allowed only two ground-ball singles and struck out seven batters in 
the final three innings as the Centurions advanced to the semifinals with an 
8-2 victory at Estancia. 
</P>
<P>
"In their first two games, it seemed like Estancia had been able to get the 
hang of those pitchers," Worley said. "We wanted to keep them off-balance, so 
we showed them two different types of pitchers today. The plan was to throw 
Warr four innings and Salkeld three." 
</P>
<P>
At first, it didn't appear that Warr (8-2) would hold up his part of the plan. 
After being handed a 4-0 lead in the top of the first, Warr barely survived the 
bottom of the inning. His first 10 pitches were balls and the second strike he 
threw was hit into right by Sean Nichols for a run-scoring single. 
</P>
<P>
But Warr settled down after the first and allowed only two more hits before 
turning things over to Salkeld. 
</P>
<P>
Salkeld, who is 11-0 with an 0.55 earned-run average, struck out the first two 
batters he faced. He gave up an infield single to Rob Nye, followed by 
ground-ball single to right field by Sean Nichols. 
</P>
<P>
He then struck out Bill Gomez to end the threat and breezed through the final 
two innings. Although his fastball never reached the 90 mile-per-hour level, it 
was consistently between 85 and 87, according to scouts in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we were going to see him, so we knew we were going to have to get our 
runs early," Estancia Coach Ken Millard said. "If we could get ahead of them, 
we had a chance." 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles got two in the first, but by that point they were already behind. 
The Centurions (21-4-2) scored four in the first off loser Gabe Javage (10-2). 
</P>
<P>
With runners on first and third and one out, J.B. Johnson singled to center to 
give Saugus a 1-0 lead. After a walk to Warr, Salkeld, who started at first 
base, grounded to shortstop Nye, but the Eagles were unable to turn the double 
play and the Centurions had a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Javage walked Trevor Rice to load the bases and then threw away a pick-off 
attempt which allowed two more runs to score. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles (21-6) scored two in the bottom of the inning on a single by Nye and 
a sacrifice fly by Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
The Centurions scored four runs in the top of the seventh, three on a home run 
by George Lopata, to take an 8-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
And by then, the game was in good hands . . . Salkeld's.

Dave Zeitler, coach of Mater Dei High School's cross-country and track and 
field teams for the past six years, said he has accepted a similar position at 
Santa Margarita High School.

Zeitler, who for the past two years has lived less than a quarter-mile from the

<P>
Zeitler, whose Mater Dei distance program has been a perennial power in the 
Angelus League, will coach the boys' cross-country program beginning next fall.

<P>
"It's kind of sad for me right now, because of all the connections I have (at 
Mater Dei)," Zeitler said. "But in my case, you have to see the logic in the

FIFTEEN-YEAR-OLD LITTLE LEAGUER WITH CEREBRAL PALSY REINSTATED AFTER OUTCRY

<P>
A 15-year-old Little League baseball player with cerebral palsy, who had been 
kicked off the team for violating an age rule, was reinstated Friday after the 
organization's national office intervened. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Little League baseball's for kids, and these adults just have to ruin 
the fun of it," said Judi Church, before it was decided that her son, Tucker, 
would be allowed to play in the Sharpstown Little League Pirates' last game of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker, who weighs just 56 pounds, was kicked off the team and his coach was 
forced to resign this week when another team competing for the same playoff 
spot complained about the player's presence on a team for 9- to 12-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Scott Davis said when he saw the 4-foot-9 youngster try out for the 13- 
to 15-year-old team, he knew he would not be able to make the cut. So Davis put 
him on the Pirates, a team composed of 9 to 12-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew the age rule, but in my heart I just couldn't see this kid not playing 
baseball," Davis said. "He loves it so much." 
</P>
<P>
After league officials forced Tucker and Davis off the team, the Little League 
national office in Williamsport, Pa., was flooded with calls about the matter 
Friday. Officials there ruled Tucker could play if he presented a doctor's note 
that said he would be safer playing on the team of younger boys. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker had such a letter but did not want to play because Davis was not going 
to be allowed to coach. Then, Sharpstown Little League president Lercy 
Simoneaux reinstated Davis. 
</P>
<P>
In the third inning, Tucker entered the lineup and struck out on five pitches. 
</P>
<P>
"I swung as hard as I could," Tucker said. who hits .167 and falls often. "I 
don't know what he threw me. I'm not sure I saw it." 
</P>
<P>
Tucker's team lost, 13-4. His teammates carried him off the field. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to know what we were doing to this poor kid, so I called the Texas 
state office and said we have to make this right," said Joe Losch, assistant to 
the president of Little League baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Little League district administrator Paul Goolsby received a complaint from 
another team competing for the same playoff spot and on Wednesday night threw 
Tucker off the team for violating the age rule. He also asked for Davis to 
resign as coach and indicated he wanted Davis banned from further coaching. 
</P>
<P>
"I knowingly broke their rules so I resigned right away," Davis said Thursday. 
"But what this is really about is adults who cared too much about winning."

DeShano, 54, disposed of his stock Oct. 15, 1984, the first trading day after 
executives at Carl Karcher Enterprises in Anaheim received a preliminary 
internal report showing a big earnings decline in the previous 4 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
By selling 1,725 shares of Karcher stock before news of the lower earnings was 
announced publicly and the stock price fell, DeShano avoided $7,107 in 
potential stock market losses, the government alleges. 
</P>
<P>
But DeShano, testifying in the fourth day of his trial on criminal 
insider-trading charges, said he had decided to sell his stock 2 to 3 weeks 
before he actually got around to calling his broker. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't relying on any confidential information of Karcher Enterprises once I 
made up my mind I was going to sell," he said. 
</P>
<P>
DeShano said he began considering a sale because he wanted to speed up the 
growth of his investments. That, he said, was why he discussed selling his 
stock in early October, 1984, with two company executives: George Cloward, 
Karcher Enterprises' controller, and Steve Kishi, director of international 
development. 
</P>
<P>
"If I believed the sale violated company policy, I wouldn't have done it," said 
DeShano, the company's director of general accounting. "I did not need the 
money." 
</P>
<P>
To win a conviction, the government must prove that DeShano had criminal intent 
and used material, non-public information to avoid a stock market loss. But if 
jurors believe that other Karcher executives assured DeShano that he could sell 
his stock before he saw the damaging financial report, it could weaken the 
government's case against him. 
</P>
<P>
DeShano, who made more than $53,000 in 1984, said he and his wife had been 
considering buying a cabin. And in September, he said, his son Daniel had asked 
to borrow $5,000. DeShano made the loan 3 1/2 months later. 
</P>
<P>
DeShano said that Karcher Enterprises had lost nearly $2 million in the final 
quarter of 1983 and that he had not sold any stock during that period. 
</P>
<P>
But under cross-examination from Assistant U.S. Atty. James Sanders, DeShano 
acknowledged that Karcher Enterprises' earnings had declined drastically during 
the first 2 months of 1984's fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"You knew that when you sold, and you didn't disclose it to anyone, did you?" 
Sanders asked. DeShano agreed. 
</P>
<P>
The criminal case stems from a civil suit filed last year by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission in which company founder Carl N. Karcher, 15 members of his 
family and DeShano were accused of avoiding market losses of at least $310,000 
in 1984 by selling securities before the earnings decline was made public. 
</P>
<P>
The civil case is pending against Karcher as well as six of his relatives and 
DeShano. DeShano is the only one who has been criminally charged. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony in the trial resumes next week.

SLIGHT CLOTHESTIME PROFIT FOLLOWS MARKETING SHIFT

Clothestime, an Anaheim-based retailer that underwent a major transformation to 
win back a market for its discount fashions, reported a slim profit of $82,000 
for its fiscal 1989 first quarter, which ended April 30. 
</P>
<P>
The profit contrasts with a loss of $819,000 in the year-earlier period. 
Revenue for the quarter increased 9% to $41.2 million, compared to $37.8 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the earnings indicate that a major change in Clothestime's 
marketing strategy may be proving successful. For years a success at selling 
fashions to 14- to 25-year-olds, Clothestime began to suffer as the size of 
that market declined in recent years. For fiscal 1988, the company recorded a 
loss of $2.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Clothestime, which operates 329 stores in 15 states, began 
stocking higher-quality, career-type apparel, and hired a new ad agency to 
bring women in their 30s into the stores. 
</P>
<P>
The company has reported sales gains in recent months, and for April, 
same-store sales increased by 38.5%. 
</P>
<P>
"The turnaround is still in its early phase, but this management has shown it 
can excel," said Thomas Tashjian, an analyst at Seidler Amdec Securities in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Investors apparently anticipated positive earnings news after reports from the 
company that store sales were up this spring. Within the last 2 weeks, the 
value of Clothestime stock has increased 40%. Friday, the stock closed at 
$10.25, up 87.5 cents in trading of 464,400 shares. The stock traded for less 
than $5 earlier this year.

FAMILY LIFE: HELPING FOSTER CHILDREN COPE AS INSTANT ADULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HOFMANN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You're a teen-aged foster child, and you've long since learned that life isn't 
easy. Not for you, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
You were removed from your parents' home because the problems there were so 
severe. You may have suffered physical or sexual abuse or the consequences of 
your parents' drug addiction. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, you've spent some time in shelters, been bounced from foster home 
to foster home, or maybe into a group home. Each time, you've adapted as best 
you could. 
</P>
<P>
But now you're about to face the biggest challenge of your life. On your 18th 
birthday, you will be legally transformed into an adult, whether you feel grown 
up that day or not. 
</P>
<P>
That means the state won't support you anymore, unless you're still finishing 
high school, so you'll have to get a job -- whatever you can qualify for with 
no experience and, at best, a high school education. Probably minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
Without the government subsidy, your foster family probably can't afford to 
keep you, so you'll need a place to live. Just your luck that Orange County is 
one of the nation's most-expensive housing markets. Even to get in the door, 
you'll probably need to come up with 2 months' rent and a security deposit. 
</P>
<P>
You'll need a car to get to and from your job. Don't forget car insurance -- 
health insurance, too. All told, you'll need a couple thousand dollars just to 
get started. 
</P>
<P>
Don't let it bother you that most of the other kids are going off to college. 
If you stash away some money, you may be able to take some night classes next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Good luck, kid. You're on your own now. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, by the way. Happy birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Similar scenarios are played out about 10 to 15 times a month in Orange County, 
according to Mike Nissen, one of the organizers of LEAP (Life Enrichment and 
Assistance Program), a private, nonprofit service set up by the county Child 
Abuse Council to help foster children as they become adults. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids are falling through the cracks," says Susan Scott, another of the 
organizers. "It's a very tough situation as to what to do with them. People are 
willing to help young children. But when they're over 18, they say, 'Let them 
go out and get a job. They can sling hamburgers at McDonald's.' 
</P>
<P>
"Well, some of them can, but others can't. And even if they can, they can't 
afford a place to live. In Orange County a lot of people, even if they're 
college-educated, still can't get an apartment on their own." 
</P>
<P>
The problem is compounded, says Scott, by the fact that "these most generally 
are not well-adjusted kids. They still have problems because of their 
backgrounds." 
</P>
<P>
"Some kids have more resources than others," says Glenda Mauer, who chairs the 
Child Abuse Council. But as a group, (former foster children) are very needy." 
</P>
<P>
Because the system stops keeping track of foster children after they become 
adults, there are no statistics on what happens to them. Nissen, a Newport 
Beach marriage, family and child counselor, says some end up living a nomadic 
existence, camping out on friends' couches for weeks at a time. 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is that some of them are living on the street somewhere," says Scott, 
also a marriage, family and child counselor in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Since LEAP was set up over a year ago, 15 young adults 18 to 21 years old have 
received some sort of assistance in setting up their lives. Some are former 
foster children; others come from various kinds of dysfunctional homes. 
</P>
<P>
Now the council hopes to expand the program to try to reach more brand-new 
adults in need, Nissen says. 
</P>
<P>
The program's goal is to help its clients become independent, says Mauer. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to carry on that dependency feeling," says Sheila Dobbs, the 
council's former chairwoman. LEAP concentrates on locating resources, but "they 
have to do all the follow-up and learn to see it through," she says. 
</P>
<P>
For example, LEAP paid for a suit of job-interview clothes for one client and 
helped another write and publish a classified ad seeking work. They found a 
doctor willing to treat a young uninsured man for a medical problem that had to 
be solved before he could get a job. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave him the doctor's name, but he had to follow up himself. And he did," 
Dobbs says. 
</P>
<P>
So far, LEAP hasn't been able to help any of its clients with housing, "and 
that's what they need most," Scott says. "We'd like to be able to give them 
their first and last months' rent, if they could show that they have a job and 
are responsible. But so far we haven't had much luck finding places for them to 
live." 
</P>
<P>
The program's funding comes from the council's $17,000 Thomas F. Riley 
Endowment Fund, named for the Orange County 5th District supervisor. All the 
money is from private sources. 
</P>
<P>
Each client is assigned a volunteer advocate who serves not as a parent but as 
an adviser in dealing with the realities of adult life. In some cases, that can 
be the former foster parent, Nissen says. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually the (former) foster parents are trying to help," he says. "But they 
just don't have the resources." 
</P>
<P>
The program is now being revamped, Mauer says, "so that we can get the services 
to young people more efficiently." 
</P>
<P>
So far, several major obstacles have prevented LEAP from helping more clients, 
Nissen says. Not only are most former foster children unaware of LEAP, but so 
are many social workers. "The key is letting them know we're here," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Some potential clients call LEAP only to be discouraged by the lengthy 
application form they must fill out to receive help. "I've had phone calls from 
people who say, 'I've heard about your program,' and I've sent them an 
application and never got it back," Scott says. "It is a fairly extensive 
questionnaire. But we can't be dispersing hundreds of dollars without knowing 
the background of the person we're giving it to, or how it will be used." 
</P>
<P>
Also, Nissen says, there's a shortage of volunteers to serve as advocates. "We 
need someone who's willing to ride along with the kid for about a year or two 
to help him get going." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the program's emphasis on independence lessens its appeal to 
some potential volunteers, he says. "A lot of people would rather deal with 
younger kids. The idea of having someone lean on you seems to appeal to people 
more than helping them become independent."

Location: West of Back Bay Drive, Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Information: (714) 640-6746. 
</P>
<P>
Description: Most of the shallow bay is exposed at low tide and consists of 
intertidal mudflats and an extensive salt marsh community of cordgrass, 
pickleweed, saltgrass, jaumea and the endangered salt marsh bird's beak. More 
than half the nation's breeding pairs of the endangered light-footed clapper 
rail make their home here. Stands of rush, cattail, tule and willow occur where 
freshwater runoff enters the bay and along portions of the channelized San 
Diego Creek. The reserve is used extensively by migrating shorebirds and 
waterfowl. 
</P>
<P>
Recreation: Biking and walking are allowed in the reserve on Back Bay Drive and 
along a bikeway. Birdwatching is a popular activity, especially in spring and 
fall. This month, the reserve became part of the new California Wildlands 
Program, and guided nature walks and other activities are now offered on a 
regular basis. Plans are under consideration to expand the reserve and 
construct a new nature center. 
</P>
<P>
Fees: No admission charge for the reserve. There is a $2 fee to take part in 
scheduled programs; annual passes are $10, which includes unlimited programs 
and admission to eight other California wild land areas. 
</P>
<P>
History: The naturally-protected lower bay has been used as a harbor since the 
late 1800s. Established in 1975 and managed by the state Department of Fish and 
Game, the ecological preserve protects 752 acres of productive wetland habitat 
in the upper bay. 
</P>
<P>
Mass transit: No direct bus access.

ON THE WATERFRONT: HARBOR IS NEWPORT'S HOTTEST NEW PICKUP SPOT

Interested in a free boat ride through Newport Harbor, or a day at the beach, 
followed by a free hot dog lunch at a waterfront restaurant? Well, all you have 
to do is become a trash collector for a day. 
</P>
<P>
Boatloads of volunteers are being recruited for Saturday, June 3, to ply the 
waters of Newport Harbor and fish for debris, while dozens more will roam the 
city's beaches lifting litter during the annual Clean Harbor Day. 
</P>
<P>
During last year's event, sponsored by the Marine Division of the Newport 
Harbor Area Chamber of Commerce, nearly 9 tons of trash were collected, 
according to Bill Von Henkle, Clean Harbor Day chairman. "The idea behind Clean 
Harbor Day is to pick up some of the debris along the waterfront and on the 
bay," he says. "We are looking for volunteers to be assigned to the various 
areas. The event is open to everyone. Most (volunteers) will be working on the 
beaches." 
</P>
<P>
The idea for Clean Harbor Day was dreamed up 10 years ago by Bill Hamilton, 
owner of the Cannery Restaurant and longtime member of the Chamber of Commerce. 
"The harbor is our most important physical asset, and it is important to all of 
us to maintain a clean and attractive environment. It is healthier for the 
people, the fish and the birds," he says. "I started Clean Harbor Day because I 
wanted to do something about litter." 
</P>
<P>
This year Hamilton, also an engineer and inventor, has added something new -- 
his own water-going version of a street sweeper. Called the Hamilton Water 
Rake, the new vessel, designed by Hamilton, will automatically rake up floating 
garbage and deposit it in bins aboard the boat. Currently, the city collects 
trash in the harbor daily using an 18-foot skiff staffed by a worker who uses a 
pool scoop. Following Clean Harbor Day, Hamilton will lend the water rake to 
the city, which will see how efficiently the new vessel works on a day-to-day 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the water rake, nearly a dozen other vessels will cruise the 32 
miles of waterways with volunteers picking up trash by hand. In the Back Bay 
area about 25 canoes and a half-dozen inflatables will navigate the shallow 
waters while volunteers carefully collect trash in the ecological preserve. "In 
the Back Bay area we have to be very careful this year because of the wildlife 
-- the ducks and other birds -- that are nesting there," Von Henkle says. 
</P>
<P>
Headquarters for Clean Harbor Day are at the Cannery Restaurant, 3010 Lafayette 
Ave., where cleanup crews will meet at 8 a.m., returning around noon for a free 
hot dog lunch and an awards ceremony. Von Henkle expects between 250 and 300 
volunteers this year. To sign up for a work detail, call the Newport Harbor 
Area Chamber of Commerce at (714) 644-8211. 
</P>
<P>
City officials involved in the job of trash collecting credit the annual Clean 
Harbor Day with helping draw attention to a daily problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Clean Harbor Day generates awareness," says Dave Niederhaus, the city's 
general services director. "People get right down there, and they can see the 
enormity of the problem we face every day. We pick up 10,000 tons of beach 
litter per year. That's an enormous amount of trash." 
</P>
<P>
The city's Marine Division collects 600 cubic yards of floating trash from the 
harbor each year. That's about four dump-truck loads each month, according to 
Ray Garver, marine safety lieutenant. 
</P>
<P>
"Clean Harbor Day helps by raising the public awareness that we do have 
debris," says Tony Melum, Newport Beach's tidelands administrator. "It 
sensitizes the residents around the bay and those who do not live on the water 
but who put things in storm drains that get washed down into the bay from 
inland areas." 
</P>
<P>
Portions of the storm drains in Tustin, Irvine, Santa Ana and Costa Mesa, in 
addition to Newport Beach, flow into the harbor, according to Tom Houston, a 
member of the Newport Beach Harbor Quality Committee. "So anything in the 
gutters -- animal droppings, grease and oil from automobiles, nonbiodegradable 
soaps -- all find their way into the bay," he says. "The fact is that people 
far from the harbor contribute to the problem, too, through the storm drain 
system. Someone in Turtle Rock, for example. His cigarette butt can end up in 
the harbor." 
</P>
<P>
Considering the large amount of trash that finds its way to the beaches and the 
bay, Tony Melum believes that Newport Harbor "is in pretty good shape. There 
are areas where we could improve, but based on the amount of use the harbor 
gets, it is not in that bad a condition. Depending on the tides and winds, some 
days it looks perfectly clean and other days there is a heavy concentration of 
debris." 
</P>
<P>
As for the quality of the water in the harbor, Houston says the Newport Beach 
Harbor Quality Committee is working "to try to develop methods and legislation 
to bring back the quality of the bay to the 1950s standards." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach resident Nancy Skinner and her physician husband, Jack, have been 
working for the past 6 years to help improve the quality of the harbor waters. 
Since 1984, the Skinners have been keeping tabs on the bacterial counts in 
Newport Bay. The bay is "relatively clean," she says. "We hope that the 
committee (she's also a member) work will make it even cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
"The Orange County Health Department tests it once a week. When you look at the 
reports you will see clean water at one site, then another reading at a 
different testing site. But most of the usual swimming spots are OK." 
</P>
<P>
If there are problems with contamination in swimming areas, those areas are 
posted, according to Bob Merryman, director of environmental health for the 
Orange County Health Department. But, in general, Merryman says: "The water 
quality of the harbor is safe to swim in." 
</P>
<P>
The long-term solution to improving the harbor's water quality lies in 
education, says Houston. "We need to understand (that) how we live affects the 
bay," he says. "We need to understand how animals behave, how plant nurseries 
operate 10 miles away, how boats are maintained and what waterfront business 
practices are." 
</P>
<P>
A brochure, developed by the Newport Beach Harbor Quality Committee offers the 
following suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
Boaters should remember that Newport Bay is a "no discharge" harbor and boats 
must have holding tanks or a certified marine sanitation device. 
</P>
<P>
Waterfront homeowners should never wash animal waste, plant clippings, paint, 
cement or other materials into the gutter in front of their homes and should 
use only biodegradable detergents when washing their cars. 
</P>
<P>
Inland residents should keep the gutters in front of their homes clean and free 
of toxic substances because runoff travels through the storm drains directly 
into the bay. 
</P>
<P>

Dunes Launch Reopens: Hundreds of boaters are expected to jam the Newport Dunes 
boat launching ramp, closed since Feb. 15 for reconstruction, when it reopens 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The ramp, the only public launch ramp in Newport Beach, will be open only on 
weekends from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. through the end of June, according to Kris 
Jamtaas, general manager of the Dunes. Afterwards, the ramp will reopen 7 days 
a week, 24 hours a day, Jamtaas says. Closure of the ramp was part of a 
$45-million renovation project that began around the first of the year at the 
1950s-style aquatic park. 
</P>
<P>
Launch fees at the Dunes are $7 on weekends and $5 on weekdays. For information 
call (714) 644-0510.
